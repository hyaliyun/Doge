He joined the Labour Party in 1909, and in 1913 became a full-time officer of the trade union. He also became involved in the Rochdale Trades and Labour Council, serving on its executive for five years. In 1919, McLean was elected as president of the Tramwaymen. During the year, the union merged into the United Vehicle Workers, which appointed him as its Lancashire organiser. In 1922, the union took part in a further merger, which formed the Transport and General Workers' Union, and McLean became an Area Passenger Transport Group Secretary, remaining in the post until he retired in 1942. He spent much of this period on the Joint Industrial Council for the industry, which he chaired for three years. McLean stood repeatedly for Rochdale Borough Council, but was never elected. At the 1931 UK general election, he stood in Liverpool Exchange, taking over 10,000 votes, and then at the 1935 UK general election he stood in Heywood and Radcliffe, managing 39.5% of the vote, but was not elected.

Bill 9 was passed on June 20, 2019. According to Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews, Bill 9 suspends and delays hearings related to wage arbitration for public sector workers until October 31, 2019 in order to allow time for the provincial government to study the August 2019 finance report of the MacKinnon panel. Bill 9 affects 180,000 public service employees in Alberta that are represented by unions in 24 collective agreements. The Alberta government set a goal of balancing the budget by 2022‚Äì2023. History Travis Toews, Minister of Finance and president of the Treasury Board, introduced Bill 9 on June 13, 2019 and its 1st reading was on the same day. Its 2nd reading was from June 17 to June 18. On June 18, Jason Nixon, who was named as Government house leader and Minister of Environment and Parks on April 30.According to The Star, Nixon announced in May 2019 that the new provincial government intended to \\"roll out 12 new pieces of legislation\\" between May and July of 2019. The 3rd reading was from June 19 to June 20. A closure of the third reading of the bill was forced by the provincial government in the early hours of June 20 and the bill was passed at 7:00 AM in the provincial legislature in Edmonton, Alberta. During the all-night session of third reading, at 11:30 PM on June 19, Kenney began distributing \\"bright pink earplugs\\" to his caucus to muffle the speech of MLAs who opposed the bill as it stood, including Edmonton-North West NDP MLA David Eggen who \\"spoke in favour of an NDP amendment to the bill.\\" Eggen said to the legislature, \\"I would beg an answer from the members opposite, although I can see that many of them are wearing bright pink earplugs that their premier is handing out to all of them right now. Probably many of them can't hear what I'm saying right now.\\" In her June 20 written statement Christine Myatt, Kenney's press secretary, said that it \\"was a harmless and light-hearted attempt to boost government caucus morale after being forced to listen to the NDP's insults, lies and over-the-top rhetoric for hours on end.\\" Government position On May 7, 2019, Kenney announced the formation of the MacKinnon panel with Janice MacKinnon as chair, as an \\"independent, non-partisan group of experts to conduct a deep dive into Alberta‚Äôs fiscal situation\\" in fulfillment of an election promise. Kenney has promised to balance the budget by 2022-2023. MacKinnon was the Finance Minister in Saskatchewan under the NDP Premier Roy Romanow in the 1990s. The MacKinnon panel, which includes Dave Mowat, who was formerly president of ATB Financial, Mike Percy who was formerly a dean at the University of Alberta, Kim Henderson, Bev Dahlby, and Jay Ramotar, is tasked with providing the report by August 15 that will provide guidelines for the fall 2019 provincial budget. In order to study the results of the report, Bill 9 was intended to delay bargaining with public sector unions until October 31 to incorporate the report's findings. On May 7, MLA Deron Bilous said \\"there is no way Kenney's government can balance the budget by 2022 while cutting corporate taxes and without slashing public services.\\" Opposition According to the Edmonton Journal, \\"[u] nion leaders have called the bill an \\"egregious attack\\" on the collective bargaining rights of 180,000 Alberta workers, including government employees, nurses, teachers, health professionals and others.\\" Those who opposed the bill, including the official opposition, the Alberta New Democratic Party, led by former-Premier Rachel Notley, were concerned that it would result in public sector contracts not being honoured by the province. The bill affects the contracts of teachers, nurses, \\"social workers, hospital support staff, prison guards, conservation officers, toxicologists, restaurant inspectors, therapists and sheriffs\\" and other public service employees. Unions By May 25, 2019, Phyllis Smith, Alberta Union of Provincial Employees (AUPE)'s independent arbitrator \\"ruled in favour of following the previously agreed upon terms of the collective agreement\\" and denied the UCP government's request to \\"delay wage-adjustment arbitration for tens of thousands of AUPE members\\". In 2018, AUPE members, Provincial Government Services, AHS General Support Services, and AHS Nursing Care, had \\"ratified collective agreements\\" which included \\"wage-adjustment arbitration to be held no later than June 30, 2019.\\" On May 13, Toews said that halting wage arbitration \\"for the final year of the current three-year contract\\" between the United Nurses of Alberta (UNA) and their employers‚ÄîAlberta Health Services, Covenant Health, Lamont Health Care Centre and the Bethany Group‚Äîwas \\"the responsible thing to do.\\" Toews would not confirm if the UCP government would \\"seek wage rollbacks.\\" According to a June 6 CBC report, the Alberta Labour Relations Board (ALRB) denied the United Nurses of Alberta (UNA)'s appeal to hear the UNA's application to reopen wage arbitration delayed by the UCP because the ALRB \\"lacks jurisdiction\\".

As well as having played an important role in the WRI from the 1980s, he had been an active contributor to the British pacifist magazine, Peace News. Howard Clark was born in Bath into a devout Methodist family and his father was a minister. He was a large, energetic man who suffered from nystagmus, otherwise known as ‚Äúdancing eyes‚Äù. He became a pacifist around the time he went to the University of East Anglia in 1968, where he met, and eventually married the daughter of a World War II conscientious objector. At university he was a member of the British National Council of the Fellowship of Reconciliation. On graduation he was offered a position as co-editor of Peace News, a job he held until 1976. In this time he helped to launch several campaigns and organisations including London Greenpeace, the British Withdrawal from Northern Ireland Campaign, and the Campaign Against the Arms Trade. In 1976 Clark left Peace News and moved to York, where he became a member the editorial collective of York Free Press, an alternative newspaper. He became an active campaigner against nuclear power, undertaking a solo cycle tour round all the UK nuclear power sites. In 1980 he moved to Bradford where he studied and worked as assistant to Michael Randle on the Alternative Defence Commission that produced the report, Defence without the Bomb. During this period that he also helped write the 1983 Peace News/Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament publication Preparing for nonviolent direct action. In 1985 he joined the WRI London office. In the early 1990s he travelled regularly to the Balkans to support the anti-war groups that had formed there. He became impressed with the civil resistance movement in Kosovo, which led to the publication of several works, such as Civil Resistance in Kosovo. In 1997 he became an Honorary Research Fellow of the Albert Einstein Institution in Cambridge, Massachusetts, founded by Gene Sharp. In the same year he resigned from his staff position with WRI but continued to be active with Peace News and the WRI executive. In 2006 he was elected Chair of WRI, and started teaching a postgraduate programme at a university in Spain. The following year he launched the website Civilresistance.info. In 2013 Howard Clark was awarded a PhD from Coventry University in recognition of his research and publications on Kosovo.

It is available for Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems. History mtPaint was originally written by Mark Tyler specifically for Linux operating systems, as a personal project for his own use. He evaluated existing graphics editors, but decided to write his own from scratch. Work was started on 7 August 2004 and the first public release was made on 13 September 2004. Of the development speed, Tyler noted, \\"This rapid development was only possible after I used and studied an excellent program call mhWaveEdit, written by Magnus Hjorth, in the Spring of 2004. As well as being an extremely good wave editing program, I also learnt many valuable lessons from this program.\\" One of the design aims was to produce a lightweight graphics editors that could be run on older hardware. As such the interface uses the GTK 1/2 toolkit. Other design goals included that it be fast, reliable and free software under the GNU General Public Licence to protect user freedom. The first release was version 0.23 and it featured an indexed palette system, but no RGB support. Following version 0.30 the program was ported to Microsoft Windows as Tyler personally wanted to use it on a Windows computer he had. The version number went directly from release 0.97 to 2.00, with no 1.00 series. Version 2.00 was released on 7 August 2005. Tyler explained the version numbering, \\"To go from version 0.97 to 1.00 would not have reflected the quantum leap in functionality due to the implementation of layer facilities.\\" Version 3.00 introduced channels with help from Dmitry Groshev, who did the work to implement the alpha (transparency), selection and mask channels. Groshev's coding was the first time that another developer's work had been directly written for mtPaint, although open source code from other projects had been incorporated previously. Version 3.00 also marked the start of a user manual for the program. Following 3.00 Tyler decided to leave the mtPaint and work on other software projects and Groshev became the maintainer. He continued to slowly add features and functionality, but through a slow cycle of releases. Version 3.40 was released on 30 December 2011 and remains the most recent release. mtPaint has been included as a default application with a number of Linux distributions, including all the LXDE versions of Lubuntu (18.04 LTS and earlier), Linux Mint as well as Puppy Linux. Features mtPaint running on Puppy Linux mtPaint running on Debian. mtPaint includes a range of features for creating drawings and editing photographs. These include: * Vertical and horizontal split views * Wide range of shortcut keys * 12 image clipboard * \\"undo\\" up to 1,000 times * Image zoom from 10% and 2000% * Languages: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Taiwanese), Czech, Dutch, English (UK), French, Galician, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish * Screenshot support * 100 layers * 81 brush shapes * User defined gradients * scaling and resizing images * rotating, including arbitrary rotation angles * effects including inverting, grayscale, isometric transformations, edge detect, sharpen, unsharp mask, soften, Gaussian blur, emboss and bacteria =File formats= mtPaint supports BMP, GIF, JPEG, LSS, PNG, TGA, TIFF, XPM and XBM formats for both loading and saving images. Reception Creating pixel art on mtPaint 3.40 mtPaint has been criticized for low discoverability of features, by users and even by the lead developer, Dmitry Groshev, who noted that its features, \\"may look opaque to users who do not like to read docs; but not everything in image processing can be made self-explanatory, particularly if one tries to keep the program small. Those features which aren't obvious, have explanations in the handbook; time spent looking them up will be well rewarded by not wasting time on learning things by trial and error.\\" Some users have written their own guides to make up for deficiencies in the official mtPaint Handbook. A 2015 review on Softpedia noted that the mtPaint GTK interface looks \\"outdated\\", but concluded, \\"although it hasn't been updated for a while and the interface could use some work in the graphical department, mtPaint features some pretty advanced options to help you manipulate images.\\" Reviewer Seth Kenlon praised mtPaint in 2017, writing, \\"what makes mtPaint great is that it specializes in pixel art, has a tiny footprint‚Äîthe application is about 391k, compiled (assuming Gtk is installed separately)‚Äîand it is designed to run efficiently on specs as low as 200MHz CPU with 16MB of available RAM.\\" Linux Experten noted, \\"due to its efficient design, it can run on older PC hardware (such as a 200mhz cpu and 32mb frame). It can edit indexed palette or 24 bit RGB images and offer basic painting and palette manipulation tools. It aims to be simple and easy to use.\\" A review in Top Best Alternatives praised mtPaint's \\"efficient and simple interface\\". A 2017 review by Martins D. Okoi for FOSSMint noted the infrequent releases of mtPaint, but praised its small memory footprint and advanced features. A 2020 review in Full Circle magazine concluded, \\"mtPaint is a very mature application ‚Äì with 15 years of development behind it. It is fast to use, and has enough features that many users will find it very useful for photo editing and making drawings.\\" See also * Comparison of raster graphics editors  References  External links * Category:2004 software Category:Free raster graphics editors Category:Raster graphics editors for Linux Category:Graphics software that uses GTK Category:Cross-platform free software Category:Free graphics software Category:Free multilingual software Category:Free photo software Category:Free software programmed in C Category:Raster graphics editors Category:Windows graphics-related software ","title":"MtPaint"},{"id":"61091461","text":"Block 216 is the working name of an under construction high-rise building in downtown Portland, Oregon, United States.

He played in the National Basketball League for the Oshkosh All-Stars in 1942‚Äì43, served as Presbyterian College's head men's basketball coach in 1950‚Äì51, but is perhaps most remembered for his twenty- five seasons spent as an assistant football coach for Auburn University between 1951 and 1975. Early life and playing careers A native of Gilbert, Minnesota, Lorendo attended Gilbert High School and lettered in football, basketball, and track. At 6'3\\" and 215 pounds, and of French-Canadian descent, Lorendo was a large man who was later written about resembling a viking. Utilizing this stature helped him play football, basketball, and track when he attended college. Some sources claim that Lorendo played football and basketball at Evelith Junior College (), the University of Northern Iowa (), and the University of Georgia (1946‚Äì1949). The only verifiable statistics and records, however, can trace him to his time at Georgia. Before Lorendo attended Georgia, he played one season of professional basketball for the Oshkosh All-Stars in the National Basketball League during 1942‚Äì43. A forward, he averaged 1.9 points per game. Lorendo then served in the Coast Guard in World War II; stops during his service included Pearl Harbor, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. When Lorendo enrolled at the University of Georgia in fall 1946, he joined the football, basketball, and track teams. In football he played wide receiver, where in 1949 he led the Southeastern Conference in receiving. He also appeared in three bowl games: the 1947 Sugar Bowl, 1948 Gator Bowl, and 1949 Orange Bowl. In spring 1950, he was chosen in the 1950 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers (11th round, 134th overall) but never played a game in the league. Coaching careers =Football= Once Lorendo's playing days were over, he accepted Presbyterian College's offer to coach football and basketball, starting in the 1950‚Äì51 academic year. He served as an assistant coach for the football team who finished with a 5‚Äì5 record in 1950. In March 1951, he received a phone call from Ralph \\"Shug\\" Jordan, Auburn University's newly-appointed head football coach. Jordan had been an assistant football coach and the head basketball coach at Georgia while Lorendo was attending as a student-athlete, and wanted Lorendo to join him on Auburn's football staff. Lorendo accepted, and he, his wife, and their newborn son relocated to Auburn, Alabama. Lorendo spent the next twenty-five seasons serving in various assistant coaching roles (1951‚Äì1975), and he earned a reputation as being tough yet fair. His coaching method was described as \\"old school\\" and he would punish players who he felt were not giving 100% effort in practice or games. Lorendo was later quoted as telling his players, \\"If I've been yelling and cussing at you in past seasons, it is only because you had a chance to help the team.\\" Lorendo's notable accomplishments as Auburn's assistant coach include coaching the wide receivers during the 1957 national championship year, as well as recruiting and coaching Pat Sullivan, an All-American and Heisman Trophy winner in 1971. =Basketball= In Lorendo's only year at Presbyterian, he served as the men's basketball team's head coach. They finished with a 17‚Äì9 overall record and won both the South Carolina Little Four regular season and conference tournament titles. The Minnesota State High School Coaches Association website also lists Lorendo as having coached Northome-Kelliher High School for one season, compiling a 6‚Äì16 overall record, but it does not state the specific season in which this occurred. Legacy Gene Lorendo's life was chronicled in a biography, Lorendo, written by sportswriter Kenneth Ringer (2015). He died on April 15, 2001 in Alpharetta, Georgia.

The previous elections were in November 1913 and the next annual all-Cardiff elections were to take place as normal on 1 November 1920. The election saw control of the council transfer from the Conservative Party to the Liberals. Background Cardiff County Borough Council had been created in 1889. Cardiff became a city in 1905. Elections to the local authority were held annually, though not all council seats were included in each contest, because the three councillors in each ward stood down for election in three-yearly rotation. The council consisted of 30 councillors who were elected by the town's voters and ten aldermen who were elected by the councillors. Ten seats were up for election in November 1919. Overview of the result Contests took place in all ten of the Cardiff electoral wards in November 1919. In addition to candidates standing under the Conservative, Liberal and Labour tickets, there were men standing from discharged soldiers' organisations, as Ex-Service men candidates. Press interest was also raised by a 'lady candidate' in the Roath ward, who was standing for the Women's Council. Mrs Janet Price Williams was unsuccessful in her bid to be Cardiff's first woman councillor. The election news was dominated by the successes of the Labour and Ex-Servicemen candidates in South Wales.

Biography ƒêorƒëe Maletiƒá was born at the Serbian Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire in a town Jasenovci in the Banat region (formerly known as Ra≈°ka/Rascia) on the first of March 1816 (Julian Calendar). In his place of birth and in Bela Crkva he received his early education in Serbian and in German, and in the gymnasia (high schools) of Oraovci and Sremski Karlovci under teachers who inspired him with an enduring love of contemporary literature, as we see from his translation of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's \\"Nathan the Wise\\" into Serbian, published when he had reached middle age. He went to Segedin as a student of philosophy and natural sciences. It appears that ƒêorƒëe Maletiƒá's studies were governed by a distinct interest. That was his aesthetical and artistic interest, which was developed under the care of Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá who often corresponded with him. The other person who influenced Maletiƒá was Jovan Had≈æiƒá (1799-1869). To the former, he owes his appreciation for the great circle of ideas which had been diffused by the teachings of Hegel, Fichte, and Schelling, while to the other latter an equal admiration for his poetical inspiration and philological polemics with Vuk. Each of these influences, which early in life must have been familiar to him, tempered and modified the other. He was uncertain at first which profession to choose and vacillated between diplomatic service, teaching, and literature. In 1839 Maletiƒá, who had mingled little in party politics, was appointed by Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá assistant to the Court Secretary at Kragujevac. The following year he was appointed City Hall secretary of Belgrade. He cared little for such work, regarding it simply as a distasteful means of livelihood, yet his experiments in writing did not encourage him to trust this for support. After a change in the dynasties in 1842, he was dismissed and went to live in Zemun. There he became a professor at a Lycee and an editor of a magazine called Podunav, from 1856 to 1858. He was appointed a director of a gymnasium in 1858 in Belgrade, where Maletiƒá and Vladimir Vujiƒá, a colleague, co-edited the Rodoljubac Magazine. ƒêorƒëe Maletiƒá first began writing poems in 1837 and having them successfully published in various magazines and almanacs. In 1844 Maletiƒá collected his poems in two volumes entitled \\"Tripobratima,\\" which almost immediately secured a wide circle of readers. To almost every new edition he added some fresh poems, all influenced by contemporary German models. Literary critic Jovan Skerliƒá wrote: \\".... ostaje djak nemaƒçkih pesnika ƒáiji je ƒçesto i rado prevodio....\\" He remained a student of German poets who he (Maletiƒá) often and gladly translated. He wrote two dramatic works -- \\" Apoteoza Velikom Karadjordju and Peodnica srbske slobode, ili srbski aiduci -- the former published in 1850 in Belgrade, the latter in 1863 in Karlovci. These, however, are unimportant in comparison with his Tri pobratima (The Three Bloodbrothers) and Pesme (Poems) in two volumes. As a lyric poet, Maletiƒá must be classed with the poets and writers of the rationalist period who soon joined the romantic school, for, like them, he found in the First Serbian Uprising of 1804, led by Karadjordje, the subject which appealed most strongly to his imagination. Maletiƒá wrote manly poems in defense of freedom, and in the diplomatic service, he played a distinguished part as one of the most vigorous and consistent of staff members. ƒêorƒëe Maletiƒá was not only a poet and a diplomat he was also an ardent student of the history of literature. In 1854 he published Teorija poezije (Theory of Poetry) and the following year Retorika (Rhetoric). He loved the theatre as well. Maletiƒá was also the author of Gracu za istoriju srpskog narodnog pozori≈°ta. The distinguished Serbian composer Kornelije Stankoviƒá (1831-1865) composed music for ƒêorƒëe Maletiƒá's drama \\"Precursor of Serbian Liberty or Serbian Highwaymen\\" (1856). As a literary historian, Maletiƒá holds a very high place. He approached history as a diplomat and confined himself to the periods and characters in which great political problems were being worked out: above all, he was a patriotic historian, and he never wandered far from Serbia.

He was initially employed by the Royal Textile Factory where he introduced new production methods and used Rubia plants to produce the red dye for the Royal Life Guards' gala uniforms. In 1777 he obtained a royal privilege to set up his own dye factory. It was situated in S√∏lvgade (No. 38, now known as the Holmblad House) but later moved to the corner of Gothersgade and Regnegade. The enterprise was after Jacob Holmblad's death in 1806 taken over by his son, Lauridz Holmblad (1770-1827), who had recently (1805) also founded a soap factory. He started Denmark's first real production of paint in 1819. L. P. Holmblad's Factory in Gothersgade The company was after Lauridz Holmblad's death in 1827 divided between his two sons. The soap factory was passed on to his eldest son, Jacob Holmblad (1791-1837) while his younger brother Carl Frederik Holmblad continued the paint factory under the name HOLMBLAD & Co. Jacob Holmblad's soap factory on the corner of Gothersgade and Regnegade was also involved in the productions of lacquer and playing cards. The company also established a glue factory and a marrow oil factory in Amager. L. P. Holmblad's oil mill and candle manufactory, built 1842-46. Painted by F.C.

In 1841, he established a production of whale oil. After his mother ceded the ownership to him in 1842, he also founded a candle factory, which was the first in Denmark to use stearin in the manufacture of candles. It was a great success and had to be expanded in 1847. In 1880, L. P. Holmblad moved their production of stearin candles to Blegdamsvej, where they had acquired O.F. Asp's candle factory which was expanded by Hans J√∏rgen Holm. The company also constructed a new factory in Amager in 1880. L. P. Holmblad was in 1919 acquired by Medicinalco and merged with O. F.

She was an active member of the WSPU and was imprisoned twice in Holloway Prison. In 2017, the Norfolk Museums Service made a successful appeal for information about her life. Fahey was born in Capri, Italy and was the daughter of sculptor Alfred Gilbert. Growing up she lived in Italy, Belgium and England. She married twice, divorcing her first husband and retaining custody of their child, which was unusual at the time. Trained as a masseuse, she served with the French Red Cross in World War I. She then qualified as a midwife, later moving to Hainford in Norfolk, where she lived with her second husband until her death in 1959.  Early life and family  Caprina Fahey was born Charlotte Emily Caprina Gilbert in Capri, Italy, on 13 September 1883. She was the youngest of five children. Her mother was Alice Jane Gilbert (1847‚Äì1916) and her father was Alfred Gilbert (1854‚Äì1934), sculptor of the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus, London. Among his other works, he also created the memorial to Henry Fawcett in Westminster Abbey, Fawcett having being married to Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett leader of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). Her parents were cousins and eloped to Paris in order to be married. From France they moved to Italy, before returning to England as Gilbert pursued his career. His bankruptcy in 1901 forced the family to move to Bruges and then later to return to England again. Fahey travelled by train to Belgium with her mother on 7 September 1901. Fahey would occasionally model for her father. He disapproved of her later activism as a suffragette, commenting in a letter in 2009 \\"Cappie a thumper of drums or a 'tootler' on Flutes and a banner waver in a rotten Cause!!!!\\" He later left her out of his will, although she did attend his funeral at Golders Green Crematorium.  Career  Fahey trained as a masseuse and married Alfred Edward Fahey in 1901, taking his name. Her husband was one of her father's assistants and a painter. Together they had a son called Dennis Mountiford Fahey in 1905, but Alfred then left her when the boy was six months old. She later sued Alfred for divorce and was given custody of Dennis; this was unusual for the times. Her husband died soon afterwards in 1907 and their son died at the age of 35 in Brighton, leaving his mother three grandchildren in Sussex. Fahey served with the French Red Cross as a masseuse during World War I, where she is thought to have met her second husband Edward Knight. Returning to Britain, she then trained as a midwife, qualifying in May 1917, and participated in the Women's Institute. Fahey and Knight moved to Rose Cottage, in Hainford, Norfolk during World War II. Fahey worked as an Air Raid Warden and they hosted at least one evacuee in wartime. They remained living there until Fahey's death.  Suffragette activism  From the mid 1900s onwards, Fahey became an active member of the Women's Social and Political Union (WPSU), took part in suffragette activism and appears on the Suffragette Roll of Honour recording those who served prison sentences for the cause. She joined the WSPU in 1908, and within two years became organiser for Middlesex. At the time she was living with Vera Wentworth in London. Fahey also helped at Longdown Farm, organising suffragette meetings in central Buckinghamshire, where she stayed in the summers of 1908 and 1909. Suffragette prisoners procession, 1909 Fahey was arrested in 1909, along with twenty six other suffragette campaigners who marched from Caxton Hall, Westminster and attempted to enter the House of Commons. She was sentenced for obstruction with Constance Lytton, Daisy Soloman, Rose Lamartine Yates and Sarah Carwin, receiving one month in prison. In November 1910, she was involved in the incident known as Black Friday and arrested again for stone-throwing, being sentenced to two weeks. Both Fahey's sentences were served in Holloway Prison, where she went on hunger strike. Fahey associated with local Norfolk suffragettes including Princess Sophia Alexandra Duleep Singh, Grace Marcon and Miriam Pratt. Fahey was imprisoned with Helen Watts and wrote praising her subsequent 90 hour fast in prison. By 1913, Fahey was asked to be a 'captain', leading one of twenty two groups of suffragette mourners along with Leonora Tyson, Elsa Myers, Eleanor Glidewell, and Dorothea Rock at the funeral procession of Emily Davison. Caprina Fahey was awarded the WSPU Hunger Strike Medal \\"for Valour\\" dated 14 March 1914 when she was arrested under the name Emily Charlton. and also used the name 'Charlotte Hay', Her medal also refers to the date 21 May 1914. It is now held in the Norfolk Museums Service (NMS) archive having been donated by her husband following her death.  Death and legacy  Fahey died at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital on 26 October 1959. Her funeral took place at the All Saints Church in Hainford on 29 October 1959. The Rose Cottage where she had lived became derelict and was eventually demolished in 1975. Some artefacts relating to Fahey's Votes for Women campaigning were recovered. Her legacy as a suffragette was not mentioned in her death notice, but her time in the Red Cross, as a state registered midwife and as an Air Raid ARP Warden and membership of the Women's Institute were recorded. In November 2017, the Norfolk Museums Service put out a public call for information on Fahey's life and legacy. The appeal led to more information about her life and a suffragette certificate given to her is now held in the museum. Fahey was also nominated for the Suffrage to Citizenship project organised by the Women's Local Government Society. In 2019, her medal was on display at a Quilters Guild event at Norwich Castle.

The museum was open from 1967 until 2009, at three locations in California and Missouri. History Rogers took the idea of building a museum after visiting the Will Rogers Museum in 1938 and finding it with few heirlooms. Rogers decided to start a collection of his own materials and upon retirement in the 1960s put them on display. Two prized and unique possessions of the museum were Trigger, Rogers' horse, and Bullet, Rogers' dog, in taxidermy. The Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum first moved within California in 1976 from Apple Valley to Victorville, where it stood for 27 years. Following the death of Rogers and Evans the museum moved in 2003 to Branson, Missouri. Struggling financially during a down-turn economy, the remaining family decided to close its doors on December 12, 2009. The majority of the collection was sold in July 2010 for $2.9 million, with Trigger and Bullet being purchased by a Nebraska-based TV network named RFD. The Autry National Center acquired key artifacts including newspaper clippings, Rose Parade programs, Roy Rogers Show memorabilia, sheet music, and the rare plastic saddle he used on Trigger. Another significant item that sold in auction was Rogers‚Äô 1964 Pontiac Bonneville for the price of $254,500. Artist Nudie Cohn, Rogers‚Äô tailor, outfitted the car with silver dollars, chrome-plated pistols, horseshoes, miniature horses and rifles, many of which were functional parts of the car such as door handles, switches and controls.

The crash involved an Aeroflot Avia 14. All 27 passengers and 5 crew on board were killed.  Aircraft  The aircraft had a serial number of 602107 and was released by Avia (Prague) on February 23, 1957. The passenger capacity of the cabin was 18 seats, although the aircraft was technically a cargo plane. The airliner was sold to the Soviet Union's Head Department of the Civil Air Fleet, where it received the registration number –°–°–°–†-L1617 and was sent to the Tbilisi Joint Aviation Division of the Georgian Territorial Administration of the Civil Air Fleet. In 1959, a re-registration was carried out, which changed the registration to CCCP-61617. According to one source, the airliner was converted into an Avia 14M (Il-14M) model at an unknown date. The total operating time of the aircraft was 11,682 hours.  Crew  * Pilot-in-Command ‚Äî Archil Alekseevich Heteshvili * Co-pilot ‚Äî Georgy Bely * Flight engineer ‚Äî Mikhail Zakharovich Suprunov * Radio operator ‚Äî Grigory Ovanesovich Akopyants  Accident  Aeroflot Flight 663 was a passenger flight from Tbilisi International Airport to Krasnodar International Airport. At 10:08, the flight landed at Kutaisi International Airport, its first stop. At 10:45, the flight departed from Kutaisi, and after 3‚Äì4 minutes, an altitude of 600 meters was reported. In response, the dispatcher instructed to follow the main route at an altitude of 1,500 meters, while monitoring the weather conditions. At 10:52 the aircraft was reported to continue to Sukhumi at an altitude of 1,500 meters. The flight took place between cloud layers in conditions of heavy precipitation, but the ground was still visible. After that, the crew did not contact or answer calls. After departing from Kutaisi, Flight 663 began to deviate to the right of the route. In the Khoni area, the crew unexpectedly encountered a severe thunderstorm, with the lower cloud limit being 300‚Äì400 meters, and the visibility not exceeding 3 kilometers. Despite bad weather, Heteshvili decided not to return to the airport or follow the roundabout through Poti, but instead try to bypass the thunderstorm on the right side of the mountains. Bypassing to the right, the plane was flying at an altitude of 900 meters when it hit a zone with heavy rain, which the radio operator reported to the ground at 10:52. At 10:53, the flight, 32 kilometers north-west of Kutaisi airport and 7 kilometers north of Gegechkori, crashed into the mountainside at 900 meters. The aircraft was completely destroyed and caught fire. All 32 people on board were killed. The total on board should have been 5 crew members and 24 passengers. But while studying the wreckage, three stowaway passengers were also found.  Cause  According to the weather forecast, a thunderstorm was expected on the main flight route, with stratocumulus and cumulonimbus clouds having a lower limit of 600‚Äì1000 meters and a horizontal visibility of 4‚Äì10 kilometers. The pilot knew that there was a thunderstorm on the main route from Kutaisi to Sukhumi, while on the roundabout (via Poti) weather conditions were good. A flight that left Kutaisi earlier determined that the main route to Sukhumi was impossible, therefore, requested permission to follow the detour route. However, the crew of Flight 663 did not receive this information before departure. This was probably caused by the fatigue of the pilot, who, at the request of the deputy chief of the airport, was delayed from the night shift and had been working for around 14 hours. At 10:38, the control tower was informed that cloud cover had dropped from 1100 to 450 meters, however, this information was not communicated to the crew of Flight 663 either. When the crew tried to circumvent the thunderstorm in the conditions of limited visibility, they did not notice that they were right on the mountains. The lack of visibility and communication resulted in the aircraft colliding with the mountain. According to the commission, the cause factors were: # The air traffic controllers allowed a visual flight at an altitude of 1500 meters in a mountainous area without meteorological conditions. # The air traffic controllers at Kutaisi airport did not prohibit the departure and did not warn the crew about the clouds, instead giving instructions to fly at an altitude of 1500 meters, an altitude dangerous during the weather conditions. # The pilot performed a visual flight, although in these weather conditions it was impossible, while below the safe altitude. # The deputy head of Kutaisi airport allowed the PM of the day shift to be two hours late for work, but when the day shift entered, he did not personally replace him, and therefore the RP of the night shift was forced to stay at work. In turn, the request for an RP of a day shift was delayed not by two, but by four hours, which further increased the working hours of the RP of a night shift.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades Range. The mountain is situated in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Mount Lago, to the north. Precipitation runoff from Robinson Mountain drains west into Robinson Creek, and east into Eureka Creek, which are both part of the Methow River drainage basin. The mountain is named for brothers James and Thomas Robinson who were settlers in the area in the late 1800s. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It comprises 423 verses divided into four chapters. Along with Brahma-siddhi of Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra, the Advaita-siddhi of Madhus≈´dana Sarasvatƒ´ and the I·π£·π≠a- siddhi of VimuktƒÅtman, it is considered to be one of the four most important works in the siddhi-literature tradition of Advaita, which comprises the stating of the essence of Advaita along with new facets brought out by defending the theology from rival schools. The text presents a mixture of metrical verses and sections of prose, known as sambandhakoti. The sambandhakoti are used for several purposes including to introduce the verses, to introduce problems for discussion, to state objections of opponent philosophers and to respond to objects and to explain connections between verses. Sure≈õvara himself makes it clear that sambandhakoti is not a commentary but an essential part of the original text. The text loosely follows the treatise Upade≈õa SƒÅhasrƒ´ of ≈öankara, particularly its 18th chapter. Contents The first chapter comprises 100 verses and primarily deals with the central theme of how ignorance of the true nature of the self is the source of bondage and how this can be rectified exclusively by knowledge of the self as opposed to via religious rites and other forms of action. The second chapter comprises 119 verses and is centered on distinction between the self and not-self, with primary focus on distinguishing the mind from the self. The third chapter, 126 verses, discusses the locus and content of ignorance as well as an in-depth analysis of the mahƒÅvƒÅkyam 'tat tvam asi' [\\"That you are.\\"] The fourth and final chapter, of 78 verses, focuses on summarizing the first three chapters and then on citing references for Sure≈õvara's ideas within the Advaita tradition, especially the canonical texts the Upade≈õa SƒÅhasrƒ´ of ≈öankara and the MƒÅ·πá·∏ç≈´kya-kƒÅrikƒÅ of Gau·∏çapƒÅda. It also discusses whether or not the individual who has attained self-knowledge is required to continue following scriptural injunctions and prohibitions. Origin of text There is a traditional story told about the origin of the treatise. It is said that originally ≈öankara wanted Sure≈õvara to write a metrical commentary upon ≈öankara's magna opus, his commentary on the Brahma S≈´tras. However, since Sure≈õvara was a recent convert to Advaita from the rival ritual-oriented theology P≈´rva Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ, ≈öankara's other disciples objected, concerned that Sure≈õvara could misinterpret the commentary. In the end, ≈öankara commanded Sure≈õvara to write an independent treatise on Advaita, which became the Nai·π£karmya Siddhi. Commentaries Two important commentaries on the text include the KlesƒÅpahƒÅrinƒ´ by Satchidanandendra Saraswati and the Candrika of J√±ƒÅnottama. Swamƒ´ ParamƒÅrthƒÅnanda Sarasvatƒ´, disciple of DayƒÅnanda Sarasvatƒ´, has conducted 251 talks on the text in English.

Most of his poetry was turned into song. He is also remembered for translating Shakespeare's \\"Midsummer Night's Dream.\\" Biography He was born in Belgrade, Serbia, on the 21st of February 1851, and educated at Belgrade's Grandes √©coles (the University of Belgrade) and Vienna's School of Telegraphy. During the Serbian-Turkish Wars he voluntarily enlisted as a telegraphist in the Serbian Military Headquarters. After the war, he spent much of his time in the Bohemian quarter of the old section of the Serbian capital called Skadarlija, socializing with friends, actors, poets, and artists. A government appointment was secured for him by his uncle. As a postal clerk and telegraphist, he had plenty of time to devote to his literary pursuits. He was never considered a popular writer, and the quiet grace of his style and his refusal to pander to the popular taste in the morals and incidents of his work may have disqualified him from popularity. His numerous travel writings, Sa Avale na Bosforu: putne bele≈°ke sa pohoda Beogradskog pevaƒçkog dru≈°tva (1897) and U Komisiji: svakojake slike i prilike iz mojeg bele≈ænika (1902) achieved a respectable following. He also translated several foreign dramas for the Serbian theatre, including Shakespeare's \\"Midsummer Night's Dream.\\" His companions and collaborators were Janko Veselinoviƒá and Stevan Sremac. The famous play \\"Djido\\" is one of several which he wrote with Janko Veselinoviƒá and‚Äîthe novelist (Veselinoviƒá) usually contributing the story and the dramatist (Brzak) the theatrical working up. Brzak also collaborated with Stevan Sremac on \\"Ivkova Slava\\" in adapting it for the theater. Literary critic Jovan Skerliƒá mentions Dragomir Brzak for his effort in \\"The History of Modern Serbian Literature\\" (Istorija nove srpske knji≈æevnosti). Brzak soon ranked with the two undisputed leaders of Serbian dramatic art -- Branislav Nu≈°iƒá and Milovan Gli≈°iƒá. He could not match the prolific power, the eloquent and moral vigor of the former (Nu≈°iƒá), nor the passionate conviction and powerful humor of the latter (Gli≈°iƒá), but Brzak was a master of clever and easy flowing dialogue. He adhered to Scribe's constructive methods, which combined the three old kinds of comedy‚Äîthe comedy of character, the manners and of intrigue‚Äîwith drama bourgeois, and blended the heterogeneous elements into a compact body and living unity. He ridiculed the vulgar and selfish middle-class and at the same time opened a wider field to social satire. Brzak struck a new vein by introducing a strong historical element in some of the dramatic romances. A series of melodramatic pageants (tableaux) from the national life, richly garnished with songs and dances, was a characteristic feature of the domestic repertoire, conjuring up the idyllic picture of the native land and alleviating the homesickness. Then came the motion to limit the musical performances to theatrical plays with singing, like \\"Djido\\", based on the story written by Janko Veselinoviƒá, but adapted for the stage by Brzak, with music by Slovenian composer Davorin Jenko, then living in Belgrade. The Serbian Singspiel approached the \\"singspiel\\" style of the German composer Carl Maria von Weber, though the Serbian storyline was influenced by the Russian school of the time. He is also known for shortening a popular patriotic song Oj Srbijo, mila mati. Brzak died in Belgrade on the 4th of March 1905. He was awarded Order of Osmanieh, Bulgarian Order For Civil Merit, Order of Prince Danilo I, Order of Saint Sava, Order of the White Eagle and Order of the Cross of Takovo.

AT&T; commissioned the launch of its AT&T; T-16 communications satellite ‚Äì originally ordered by satellite television provider DirecTV as the next satellite in its existing fleet prior to the acquisition of the company in 2015. The acquisition made AT&T; the largest provider of subscription television in the world, with 26 million subscribers in 2015; this has since decreased to 22.4 million subscribers in 2019. Eutelsat commissioned the launch of its Eutelsat 7C communications satellite, which provides 49 Ku band transponders for Sub-Saharan African digital television stations and capacity for several hundred channels in the region. The satellite also has optical communication capabilities for use by government services in Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia, with a steerable beam capable of reaching areas visible to the satellite in its geostationary orbit above Africa. Eutelsat 7C was manufactured by Maxar Technologies and its design, intended for a lifespan of 15 years, is based on the SSL 1300 satellite bus. Weighing , the satellite uses electric propulsion for orbit maintenance, which reduces the satellite's launch mass. Eutelsat 7C arrived at the Guiana Space Center on 31 May. AT&T; T-16 and Eutelsat 7C were the 601st and 602nd satellites launched by Arianespace.  Flight  The Ariane 5 ECA launch vehicle rolled out to Kourou's ELA-3 launch pad on 19 June 2019. It lifted off at 21:43:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on 20 June 2019, approximately two minutes before sunset during a launch window that lasted an hour and 47 minutes. The rocket's boosters and EPC first stage were expended in under nine minutes, while the ESC-A upper stage's HM7B engines burned for sixteen minutes; the EPC first stage intentionally crashed in the Gulf of Guinea, off the west coast of Africa. Following the conclusion of the burn, AT&T; T-16 separated from the ESC-A at 22:11 UTC, 28 minutes after the start of the flight, followed by the Eutelsat 7C's separation six minutes later, at 22:17 UTC. The flight lasted 34 minutes, and placed the satellites into a geostationary transfer orbit from which they will eventually be placed into geostationary orbit through their own propulsion. Eutelsat 7C was placed at 7¬∞ east, a position which allowed the satellite to serve its intended markets in Africa, Central Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Eutelsat 7C will continue in-orbit testing until the end of 2019, after which it will become fully operational.

Early life and career Scheffer-Boyadel was born on 25 March 1851 in Hanau. In 1870 he volunteered for service in the Franco-Prussian War. Afterwards, in 1871, he became a lieutenant in the Prussian Army. He was ennobled in 1890 and became a baron in 1906. He served on the Great General Staff, commanded a guards division and later a corps until he retired in 1913 at the age of 62. He was recalled to active service in the fall of 1914 and was given command of the newly organised XXV Reserve Corps which became a part of the 9th Army under August von Mackensen.  World War I  Between 12 and 16 November 1914 three corps of the Ninth Army completely smashed the left wing of the Russian 1st Army, Scheffer's corps attributing much to the success. During the fighting his corps managed to advance seventy-five miles in just five days. After breaking through the Russian defensive line Scheffer's corps continued towards ≈Å√≥d≈∫. His corps, together with a single division as reinforcements, arrived to an area to the east of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ by 21 November, which placed them behind the Russian 2nd Army which was organising the defense of that area. Soon he attacked the Russians from the rear. Reserves from Warsaw and elements of the 1st and 5th armies were quickly sent to help the defenders and approached from all sides. Now Scheffer was in a dangerous position, soon to be encircled by Russian troops approaching from all sides. The Germans were now around ~50.000 strong and heavily outnumbered by their opponents. About half of the Russian 2nd Army was sent to close the encirclement while the other half defended ≈Å√≥d≈∫ with their entrenchments. Scheffer continued to advance on ≈Å√≥d≈∫, posting major units to defend his rear but Russian resistance turned out be too formidable, he wasn't able to take ≈Å√≥d≈∫. By now about ~200.000 Russian troops were encircling his position, Mackensen told Scheffer by radio to extract his troops from their current position and try to escape back to German lines but that seemed not to be possible. The Russians by now were so sure of victory that they brought up trains from Warsaw to transport the expected prisoners. Scheffer decided to attack eastward, the direction the Russians would least expect. He took the Russians by surprise and broke through, he began his march north. The Russians failed to reestablish the encirclement. Fifteen miles from German lines Scheffer would inflict a decisive defeat on a Russian division. On 26 November Scheffer's corps took up positions in the German frontline once again. Scheffer's forces had lost ~4.300 men but inflicted at least three times as much on the four times larger Russian forces, he made it out with ~16.000 prisoners and 64 captured guns. T. Dupuy called it one of the greatest feats in military history, describing it as almost unbelievable. For this action Scheffer-Boyadel received the Pour le M√©rite on December 2, 1914.  Later life and death  He died on 8 November 1925 in Boyadel.

During the Extra Life 2017 fundraiser in November 2017, free excerpts from Xanathar's Guide to Everything were released as PDFs when different reward tiers were hit. The book was released on November 21, 2017. An exclusive edition with an alternate art cover by Hydro74 was pre-released to select game shops early in November 2017.  Reception  Xanathar's Guide to Everything won the 2017 Origins Awards for Best Role-Playing Game Supplement and Fan Favorite Role-Playing Game Supplement.https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d4db01d648a4e0001199c62/t/5d54143bc0ef3b0001c05d30/1565791295626/Origins+Awards+Winners+2018.pdf In Publishers Weekly's \\"Best-selling Books Week Ending December 4, 2017\\", Xanathar's Guide to Everything was #1 in \\"Hardcover Nonfiction\\". Publishers Weekly highlighted that the book \\"sold nearly 45,000 copies\\" as a new release. ICv2 underscored that these numbers originate from BookScan and include point of sale \\"data from most chains and online retailers, but not most [Friendly Local Game Stores]\\". Scott Thorne, for ICv2, highlighted two interconnected reasons for the high sale numbers: first, \\"WotC has a huge untapped market out there for D&D; player-targeted books and Xanathar‚Äôs Guide is the first 'official' [...] player-oriented book released by WotC in almost two years. With that level of pent-up demand, it is no surprise that sales of the book took most stores, and WotC, by surprise\\". And second, Amazon sale discounts since \\"unlike some other gaming manufacturers, which have started protecting the value and price of their books though a MAP, a customer can, when it comes back into stock, order Xanathar‚Äôs Guide from Amazon for $29.95, a 40% discount. One Amazon seller even has the book, as of this writing, listed at $19.30 with shipping, a whopping 61% off\\". In Polygon's review, Charlie Hall wrote \\"like Volo‚Äôs Guide to Monsters, which was released late last year, Xanathar‚Äôs has a narrator named Xanathar. He‚Äôs a beholder ‚Äî a multi-eyed, floating monster from D&D; lore ‚Äî who just happens to be a powerful crime lord in the city of Waterdeep. Think Jabba the Hutt, but with disintegration rays shooting out of its eyestalks. Nearly every page of the book is annotated with little quips and observations. Unfortunately, the humor of those narrative snippets fell flat for me. Xanathar‚Äôs voice, as applied in this book, feels a bit too modern. He sounds more like a cranky Redditor than a fantastical crime boss. Luckily, the bulk of the content in the book is outstanding. In my estimation, it‚Äôs the first must-have new book from Wizards of the Coast since the latest edition of the Dungeon Master‚Äôs Guide. [...] Up front, there are more than 30 new subclasses for players to choose from. They include some vital and popular builds from previous editions of the game, like the Cavalier and the Samurai. But they also include some brand new versions of classic character classes that will liven any newly-formed party. [...] Best of all, WotC has instilled all of these new subclasses with strong role-playing hooks. These aren‚Äôt just stat-blocks with new art, but rather inspirations for storytelling in and of themselves. That being said, most players will have no need for the remainder of the book. Chapters two and three are mostly for Dungeon Masters, and include a host of new tools and tables\\". Rob Wieland, for Geek & Sundry, wrote that \\"backgrounds in Fifth Edition offer a good place to start talking about the history of characters, but coming up with a full background for a character can be a little intimidating for someone that‚Äôs never done it before. Xanathar‚Äôs Guide has a few class-specific elements that can help like tables for a bard‚Äôs worst performance or the vice a rogue likes to indulge in, in between adventures. It also has a big section full of tables that determine important character details like siblings, upbringing and other points that can help sketch a character backstory during play. There‚Äôs a running gag that all D&D; characters are orphans that were born, grew up and became adventurers, but with this section, characters get a skeleton of a backstory to help shade how they react in play\\". Richard Jansen-Parkes, for the UK print magazine Tabletop Gaming, wrote that \\"in many ways the slightly unfocused air of XGtE is a reflection of how modern games ‚Äì both tabletop and digital ‚Äì are no longer static products, eternally fixed at version 1.0. It was clearly shaped by community feedback and directly addresses many of the questions and concerns that regularly crop up in Reddit threads and Twitter feeds. [...] In many ways, the fact that the new rules feel fun without seeming over-powered is perhaps the book‚Äôs biggest success of all. [...] There are a few things that appeal to the power gamers out there, but this is always going to be the case and none of them seem to make any existing abilities or characters completely obsolete. Indeed, plenty of the content doesn‚Äôt have any impact on the gameplay whatsoever, such as a guide for generating character backstories or long tables of random names for the DM to consult when players insist on speaking to everyone in the tavern. The best way to describe XGtE, perhaps, is that it upgrades your experience to D&D; 5.1. It‚Äôs a huge content update that tweaks things here and there, presented with all the usual top- notch design and writing work we‚Äôve come to expect from the D&D; team. Arguably some of the rules clarifications should be presented as errata or an update to the existing core books rather than requiring you to buy a new one, but when that‚Äôs the biggest complaint going you know you have a success on your hands\\". Rollin Bishop, for Comicbook, wrote that \\"though the supplement‚Äôs name does it no favors, it‚Äôs mostly a reprinted collection of an online article series with some added depth. Having it all in one physical place, however, is helpful. Even so, the game of D&D; technically only requires three books: the Player‚Äôs Handbook, the Dungeon Master‚Äôs Guide, and the Monster Manual. But if there‚Äôs a fourth book every tabletop group should pick up, it‚Äôs probably Xanathar‚Äôs. In terms of usefulness, Xanathar‚Äôs is arguably equally useful to both players and Dungeon Masters. The first and third chapter are heavily player focused while the middle chapter is specifically all about tools for the DM to use. That includes sections on sleep, random encounters, traps, and more. If you‚Äôre familiar with the Unearthed Arcana books from previous modern editions, this treads similar territory for 5th Edition. The question most groups will likely be asking themselves is whether the $49.95 MSRP is worth the sticker price\\".

William was added to his name when he was baptised in England. He spent many years in Trinidad before moving to Sierra Leone and later returning to England.  Biography  King Karikari, the son of Afia Kobi, ruled from 28 May 1867 until his abdication on 26 October 1874. After the 1874 war, the British imposed conditions on the Ashantis to take the sons of King Karikari to be educated in British culture and civilization. After the death of one of the sons from tuberculosis, Prince Kofi was taken to Trinidad in the West Indies as a place of safe exile. When he arrived in Trinidad, he was placed under the care of James Henry Collins, the headmaster of a boys school at Tranquillity, Port of Spain. His popular name was the \\"Black Prince\\". It is believed he socialized with the social elite. It is recorded that he was part of the festivities when two sons of the Prince of Wales, Princes Edward and George, visited the island. He designed a Victorian-style signal station (lighthouse) on top of the Fort George hills west of Port of Spain. He remained in Trinidad until 1886 and then moved to Sierra Leone. He was appointed as an interpreter to King Prempeh I during the king's stay in Sierra Leone on his way to exile in the Seychelles. He moved to England after his relationship with the Asante royals turned sour following the refusal of the royals to adopt the English language and as allegations were leveled at him for not speaking the Akan language properly. He later died in England. The memorial to his lighthouse stands 1,120 above sea level and was built by enslaved Africans.

One of the central axes of her work is the critical analysis of the media. Artistic career Concha Jerez studied piano at the Madrid Royal Conservatory, and in 1958‚Äì1959 she obtained a scholarship to Washington-Lee High School in Arlington, Virginia, where she became interested in political and social affairs. This led her to study for her licentiate in political science at the Complutense University of Madrid. In 1970 she decided to dedicate herself to visual arts, and held her first exhibition in 1973. As she began her career under the threat of censorship by the Franco regime, the role of the media, censorship, and self-censorship have often been present in her artistic work. In 1976 she presented her first large installation, Autocensura, still restricted to printed paper. In 1983 she exhibited the installation Retorno al comienzo at the Museo Vostell Malpartida. Later she opened the doors to the use of all kinds of new technological possibilities, such as video, interactive installations, photographs, and pure audio installations. Since then Jerez has focused her work on the field of performance art and on the development of the concept of installation as a work in situ, in large spaces, many of them combining the expressive resources of different media. She has been recognized as a member of Spain's first generation of conceptual artists. She began ' in the early 1980s. Her first video installation was centered around a staircase. It was presented at the First International Video Festival of Madrid held at the C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes in 1984. Later in the decade she was invited to perform an installation at the First Media Art Festival in Osnabr√ºck, Germany. Jerez has produced radio art pieces for several European stations. Since 1976 she has collaborated on numerous projects with the composer and multidisciplinary artist , with whom she presented Media Mutaciones at La Tabacalera in Madrid in 2015. This was a tour of their joint projects, covering work connected with the legacy of the 1970s and their current visual and sound practices. From July 2014 to January 2015, the Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo de Castilla y Le√≥n exhibited her Interferencias en los medios. In 2015, Jerez won the National Award for Plastic Arts \\"for her pioneering dimension in the use of technologies, for being representative of a generation of artists that has marked the transition from the analog era to digital culture, with her research, creations, and innovations\\" and her work in conceptual creation. Jerez was also a teacher at the University of Salamanca's from 1991 to 2011. Feminism and a generically left-wing stance are prominent within her work, as well as outside it. Jerez has been an organizer, co- organizer, and grassroots militant of various associations of women and artists, including the Asociaci√≥n de Mujeres en las Artes Visuales (MAV), which granted her an award in 2012 as a recognition of her career. In 2018 she participated in the collective exhibition organized by the CentroCentro, La NO comunidad, with the work Soliloquios cotidianos.

In his Media interaction during the campaign the lead actor Inaamulhaq, said that he feels that the idea of becoming a human hoarding was far better way than the hoarding on a pole. He believes that it was taken in a very positive way by the people as they had a yearning to ask questions about it, which spread the idea of peace between people, which is the central idea of Nakkash and that is why it is very crucial that the film like this reaches the viewers and teach the people of the country the way of love and accord between each other. Critical reception Nakkash Cast Inaamulhaq and Sharib Hashmi become Human Hoarding during unique promotion campaign In most of the reviews Nakkash was tagged as the 'Most Essential Film' of today's time. Here are few major reviews from critics- *Pallabi Dey Purkayastha from The Times of India wrote \\"In a nutshell, this drama on social issues ticks all the boxes of a progressive and offbeat movie\\" *National Film Award winning film critic, Saibal Chatterjee wrote at NDTV \\"Inaamulhaq's Film Has Its Heart In The Right Place\\" *Anna M. M.

Ka≈°ikoviƒá (Sarajevo, Ottoman Empire, 4 December 1861 - Sarajevo, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, 22 May 1927) was a Serbian writer, educator, editor of Bosanska Vila and a collector of folk songs. His editorial policies brought prestige and recognition to his journal in Sarajevo at the time when Bosnia and Herzegovina was under the Turkish and Austrian yoke. Biography He taught at Miss Irby Teachers‚Äô College, established in Sarajevo in 1869 by English Protestant humanitarian Adeline Paulina Irby. There he met Stoja Zdjelareviƒá and married her in 1886. Nikola T. Ka≈°ikoviƒá went on to become one of Bosnia and Herzegovina‚Äôs most important cultural figures. Under the auspices of the Serbian Teachers Association in Sarajevo in 1885, Ka≈°ikoviƒá and three other teachers at Miss Irby Teachers' College -- Bozidar Nika≈°inoviƒá (b. 1863), Nikola ≈†umonja (1865-1927) and Stevo Kaluƒëerƒçiƒá (1864-1948) -- founded the first Bosnian Serb literary-cultural journal, Bosanska vila (The Bosnian Muse) which was in circulation from 1885 until 1914.It rapidly became the most important journal in the country, as well as a leading cultural journal among South Slavs outside the region. Bosanska vila published folklore, poetry, short stories, translations and reported on Serbian cultural events from across the Balkans.The journal served as a forum of discussion about not yet attained goals of education and literary and artistic collaborative works by a new generation of writers, namely Aleksa ≈†antiƒá, Jovan Duƒçiƒá, Veljko Petroviƒá, Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá, Svetozar ƒÜoroviƒá, Petar Koƒçiƒá, Milan Prelog and others.As such, the people involved with the journal, particularly Nikola Ka≈°ikoviƒá, were constantly under the watchful eye of the authorities, monitored wherever they went. In 1887, Nikola T. Ka≈°ikoviƒá took over the duties of two previous editors Bozidar Nika≈°inoviƒá (1885-1886) and Nikola ≈†umonja (1886-1887), and retained the same position for the next 26 years, until the outbreak of World War I, thanks to the efforts of his wife Stoja Ka≈°ikoviƒá. When Nikola became ill and bed-ridden in 1891, Stoja Ka≈°ikoviƒá became the journal's (Bosanska Vila) acting editor-in-chief, moving the journal‚Äôs administrative headquarters from the Serb elementary schoolhouse to the Ka≈°ikoviƒá family residence. She also received assistance from an experienced administrator, Stevo Kaluƒëerƒçiƒá. But like other women of her time, her work went mainly unrecognized and it was Kaludjerƒçiƒá‚Äôs name that appeared on the 1891 masthead of each issue of the journal as editor-in-chief. After Nikola‚Äôs recovery the following year, Stoja continued to act as his trusted co-editor and collaborator, also contributing on occasion. Since a great number of subscribers lived in Belgrade, Nikola and Stoja were in correspondence with the intellectual crowd of that city, namely Milorad Pavloviƒá and Isidora Sekuliƒá.Stoja eventually did receive public acclaim for her cultural work. In 1910, historian and friend of the Ka≈°ikoviƒá couple, Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá presented a comprehensive history of Bosanska Vila in his address on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of its founding. Nikola and Stoja Ka≈°ikoviƒá received decorations from the governments of Serbia and Montenegro. Also, the couple received a laurel wreath which was presented by the Philanthropic Organization of Serbian Ladies (Kolo srspski sestara),as a gesture of their appreciation.

On 19 June 2019, Chennai city officials declared that \\"Day Zero\\", or the day when almost no water is left, had been reached, as all the four main reservoirs supplying water to the city had run dry. Two years of deficient monsoon rainfall, particularly in late 2017 and throughout much of 2018 had led to this crisis. Because tap water has stopped running, some families have been relying on alternative water sources such as distant, unreliable public water pumps, and costly private water tankers. Background Chennai is a city of over 8 million people, around the size of New York City, and is the fourth largest city in India.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/chennai-water-crisis-a-wake-up-call-for- indian-cities-66024 The city is an automotive engineering hub and contains many automotive factories that are built around the reservoirs of the city. Mismanagement of the city‚Äôs water resources and weak monsoons for the last four years reduced the city‚Äôs reservoirs to 0.1% of normal capacity in June 2019. Water became a valuable resource in Chennai and experienced exploitation as wealthier residents paid to dig deep bore wells on their land and sold water to other residents or businesses. This practice was allowed by the government and resulted in the groundwater aquifer to be drained dramatically at twice the level of annual recharge. Protests erupted over the Chennai government‚Äôs lack of action on the issue as water was no longer a basic human right in Chennai. The government also faced pressure on their management of the city‚Äôs four main reservoirs; Poondi, Cholavaram, Redhills and Chembarambakkam. Factories and infrastructure built in the catchments of these reservoirs were unregulated and therefore much of the rain that fell ended up in the ocean or used in excess by these factories. This further exacerbated the issue and limited the amount of water that entered the reservoirs for public consumption. Monsoon rains in 2019 have been more plentiful in years past and have raised the reservoir levels to around 30% capacity.http://www.futuredirections.org.au/publication/india-water-supply- agency-declares-chennai-water-secure/ Chennai has declared itself water secure because of the recent rains but concern remains about the future of water security in Chennai and many other Indian cities such as Bangalore which have similar regulation issues. An Indian government think tank predicted that 21 Indian cities will be out of groundwater by 2020, and the impact of future droughts in India brought upon by climate change will put the entire country at risk unless stronger regulations are put in place.thediplomat.com/2019/08/chennais-man-made-water-crisis/ Chennai has historically relied on annual monsoon rains to replenish its water reservoirs since the rivers are polluted with sewage. There are four reservoirs in the city, namely, Red Hills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam, with a combined capacity of 11,057 mcft. =Extreme drought= Three years of failed monsoon in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The 2018 northeast monsoon season was one of the driest ever recorded in Chennai, as only 343.7 mm of rain had fallen compared to an average of 757.6 mm, which was a 55% rainfall deficit. Additionally, the entire state of Tamil Nadu had recorded a 23% rainfall deficit in that season. A major heat wave in India from May to June 2019 further exacerbated the problem by evaporating any water still left in reservoirs. =Government mismanagement= Government mismanagement and unplanned construction has also been a factor to blame for this crisis. Impact Millions of people are without consistent access to water. A lack of rainwater and groundwater has left four of the reservoirs that supply the city completely dry. The inability to meet demand for water has forced businesses like hotels and restaurants to close. Water tankers from areas of Tamil Nadu unaffected by drought have been bringing water into some areas of the city. However, government tankers can take up to a month to appear after requested, so some families, wealthy residents, and business owners have opted to pay for costly private water tankers. The poor who live in slums do not have this option; a family in Chennai's slums may receive as little as of water every day compared to an average American household which uses of water a day. Many fights over water have also broken out as a result of the conflict. In one such conflict that occurred on 15 June 2019, a woman was stabbed and the perpetrator was turned in to the police. Now in 2020 Chennai is still not getting as much water. Water scarcity is still continuing in parts of the city.

The practice offered treatment for acute and chronic illnesses, preventive treatment, minor surgeries, labor, delivery, and abortion services through the 1960s.Ward, Jr., Thomas J. \\"Black Physicians in the Jim Crow South\\". Fayetteville, AR: The University of Arkansas Press, 2003 History The hospital was conceived by Dr. Edward L. Roberts and constructed by architect John R. Bingham in response to the Koch and Fowler city plan, which in 1928 proposed a redlined district for marginalized minorities.Simond, Ada. ‚ÄúHealthy Memories Savored by Retired Teacher-Therapist‚Äù. Austin American-Statesman, April 1, 1984 Robertson Hill District allotted a community where the American Black population of Austin could access schools, and medical services. The clinic closed following the death of Dr. Edward L. Roberts in 1967; the hospital was later transformed into a halfway-house for recovering addicts. Roberts Clinic, opened in 1937 by Dr. Edward L. Roberts, was the first medical facility in Austin with hospital rooms open exclusively for the treatment American Black patients. In the Jim Crow era, racial discrimination and segregation affected the quality of medical care American Blacks received in public health care facilities while American Black physicians were professionally-subordinated by white doctors. Proprietary clinics, like Roberts Clinic, that operated across the South from the 1930s-1950s provided American Black doctors professional autonomy to practice on patients who were treated without the humiliation of segregationist policies. As hospitals integrated in the 1950s and 1960s, these independent facilities closed. Roberts, a Meharry Medical College graduate, opened Roberts Clinic in a Central East Austin residential neighborhood in 1937. The two-story Colonial Revival building had a medical facility on the first floor, and the Roberts Family lived on the second floor. Until 1967, Dr. Roberts administered treatment for preventative, acute, and chronic illnesses; performed minor surgeries; and offered labor and delivery services for the city's American Black community. Roberts Clinic is listed in the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion A for Ethnic Heritage: American Black and Health/Medicine as an excellent local example of small proprietary medical clinics built by American Black physicians during the period of segregated medical practices in the United States. It is the only remaining example of this property type extant in Austin, Texas. Architecture Roberts Clinic was built approximately one mile from the Texas State Capitol. =Exterior= The 2-story brick structure has a projecting full-height centered gable, Georgian variants, and a white stucco portico that highlights the entrance. The secondary entrance is a glazed panel door with mail slot. =Interior= Historically, the Roberts Clinic first floor functioned as the medical clinic; patients entered through the east elevation to wait in the foyer. The rear wing, with exterior access only, is thought to have originally functioned as a laundry room.

The song was released on June 21, 2019 through Columbia Records, as the second single from the band's eighth studio album, Nine. It was written by bassist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist Matt Skiba, as well as producer John Feldmann, and songwriters Benjamin Berger, Ryan McMahon, and Ryan Rabin. Background Unlike the band's previous single, \\"Blame It On My Youth\\", \\"Generational Divide\\" uses a noticeably more aggressive and darker tone, while also being much shorter than most of the band's previous singles. The song is based on an argument Hoppus had with his son when driving him to the bus stop one morning before school. Afterwards, he went to the studio and wrote \\"Generational Divide\\" based on the fight. The theme of the song was \\"nothing changes if nothing changes.\\" In an interview with Kat Corbett at SiriusXM's Lithium, Hoppus also explained that the song's brief length was the result of it being trimmed from a three-minute song preceding it. Initially, \\"Generational Divide\\" was a longer song with a very different structure: it shifted between three-quarter time and four-quarter time, which Hoppus described as reminiscent of the Beatles' \\"She's Leaving Home\\". In the end, the group preferred the snippet towards its conclusion where it grew faster, and simply decided to clip that portion off and release it. Reception Many critics noted that the song was particularly short, but also praised it for the more aggressive direction. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone felt that the song \\"is a burst driving guitars and hardcore drums\\", while Chad Childers at Loudwire called it \\"a 'blink and you might miss it' cut\\". Additionally, Collin Goeman from Alternative Press pointed out Travis Barker's previous promises of returning to a sound more akin to the band's untitled album, calling it a \\"perfect illustration\\" of the statements. Music video The music video was directed by Kevin Kerslake, and released on the same day as the song. It depicts the band playing in a small room with the walls, floor, and ceiling plastered with concert flyers from other notable punk rock acts, including but not limited to: Bad Brains, Bad Religion, Descendents, The Misfits, Iggy Pop, Meat Puppets, Melvins, Mot√∂rhead, Fugazi, Cro-Mags, The Vandals, G.B.H., Youth of Today and Nirvana.

There is limited oversight over the Intelligence Bureau, and it conducts work in secrecy without the city council being informed of operations. The intelligence and counterterrorism bureaus fall under the domain of Intelligence and Counterterrorism Division, which is commanded by Deputy Commissioner John Miller.  Current subdivisions  = Intelligence Operations and Analysis Section (IOAS) = The IOAS is responsible for both collecting and analyzing data for counter-terrorism purposes. = Criminal Intelligence Section (CIS) = Similar to the IOAS, the CIS collects and analyzes data for counter-crime purposes. They also conduct the Field Intelligence Officer (FIO) program, where officers conduct intelligence work with narcotics, firearms, and other criminal investigations.  Former subdivisions  = Demographics Unit / Zone Assessment Unit = The Demographics Unit (later known as the Zone Assessment Unit) was a secret police intelligence division formed after the September 11 attacks to surveil Muslim-Americans. Police Spokespersons did not publicly acknowledge the unit until after the Associated Press revealed the organization through a Pulitzer Prize award-winning series of articles. The unit's techniques included eavesdropping on conversations held in public locations, gaining access to internet usage by Muslim groups on college campuses by claiming to be investigating narcotics or gang activity, and labeling entire mosques as terror groups in order to record sermons and spy on religious officials without specific evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Twenty-eight \\"ancestries of interest were monitored by the unit, ranging from Arab ethnicities like Palestinian and Syrian to heavily Muslim populations from former Soviet states such as Chechnya and Uzbekistan to Black American Muslims\\". It was noted by the ACLU that the NYPD \\"expressly excluded from its surveillance and mapping activities non-Muslims such as Coptic Christian Egyptians or Iranian Jews\\". In 2013, the Muslim American Civil Liberties Coalition (MACLC), along with Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) and Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) published a report that was critical of NYPD surveillance of their communities, and the Demographics Unit in particular. On April 15, 2014, the New York Times reported that the NYPD officially dismantled the Zone Assessment Unit (formerly known as the Demographics Unit). However, there is concern that the data gathered through the program is still being used today. in August 2012, the Chief of the NYPD Intelligence Division, Lt. Paul Galati admitted during sworn testimony that in the six years of his tenure, the unit tasked with monitoring Muslim-American life that had not yielded a single criminal lead. According to the NYPD, there were two specific instances where information from the Zone Assessment Unit was used. In the wake of the 2013 Boston bombing, NYPD deployed to areas inhabited by individuals from the Caucus region, which includes Chechens, both to ensure people in those neighborhoods were not victimized by retaliation and to ensure that the two perpetrators were not able to blend into the area. In another instance, after a leader of the Hazara community was killed by a Pakistan-based organization in Quetta, Pakistan, NYPD was able to respond in the Hazara community. https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/legal/defendants_brief_in_opposition_to_motion.pdf In 2018, the NYPD paid out a settlement to groups and persons that were surveilled and agreed to update their training and manuals and that it would not engage in surveillance predicated upon religion.

Johnny is introduced as the patriarch of the central Rose family and the former CEO of Rose Video, a video rental chain. His initial stories revolve around his attempts to rebuild his family's fortune and help them adjust to life in Schitt's Creek, a small town he bought as a joke birthday gift for his son, David, in 1991. In later seasons, Johnny's stories focus on his work as co-manager of the Rosebud Motel and his relationship with his family. The character was portrayed by actor and producer Eugene Levy, who created the series with his son, Dan Levy, for the series entire 80-episode run. His performance as Johnny has been widely praised, earning him four consecutive Canadian Screen Award nominations and one win in 2016 for Best Performance by an Actor in a Continuing Leading Comedic Role. In 2019, Levy received his first Primetime Emmy nomination for the role for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. He was also nominated in 2020, this time winning the award.  Role in Schitt's Creek  Schitt's Creek follows the lives of the once wealthy Rose family, who must relocate to the titular town after losing their fortune to a corrupt business manager. Introduced as the former CEO of Rose Video‚Äîa video rental chain‚Äîand head of the family, Johnny is an \\"entitled,\\" yet competent businessman determined to return the Roses to their former social standing. He initially helps and encourages his family to adjust to life in their new surroundings, but struggles to find his own place in the town. After a few misguided business ventures, he partners with motel clerk Stevie Budd (Emily Hampshire) to co-manage his new home, the Rosebud Motel. During his time in Schitt's Creek, Johnny's entitlement recedes, and his appreciation for his family and the local townspeople grows. He remains steadfast to his wife, Moira (Catherine O'Hara), throughout the series and becomes an enthusiastic supporter of his adult children, David (Dan Levy) and Alexis' (Annie Murphy), personal and professional successes. Johnny also grows closer to Stevie and town mayor, Roland Schitt (Chris Elliott), who, by the end of season five, have worked together to make the Rosebud Motel a successful business.  Character  = Creation = The character of Johnny Rose was created by Eugene Levy and his son, Schitt's Creek co-creator Dan Levy. While crafting Johnny and the rest of the Rose family, the Levys drew inspiration from wealthy American reality TV families portrayed on such shows as Keeping Up with the Kardashians and The Real Housewives franchise. Early incarnations of the character depicted Johnny as an incompetent man who ran a business with his two brothers. But as they further developed the series, the Levys believed the character needed more \\"credibility\\" as a businessman and a certain set of \\"executive skills\\" which would allow him to handle the financial crisis that befalls the Rose family. Intending for Johnny to be the \\"straight man\\" of the series, the elder Levy also drew more inspiration for the role from his own personality than he had for any of his previous characters. Catherine O'Hara helped further develop the character by setting the tone and overall dynamic for Johnny's relationship with his wife, Moira, after she secured the role. = Design = In contrast to his wife, Moira's, often over-the-top black and white wardrobe, Johnny's sense of style is more subdued. He is frequently clad in a \\"well-tailored\\" gray or black suit from designers like Hugo Boss and Ermenegildo Zegna. This serves as a reminder to the audience of Johnny's business background, as well as the wealth from which he came. = Personality = Johnny presents himself as the most \\"dependable,\\" realistic, and \\"easy- going\\" member of the Rose family. He approaches the family's current predicament with a business-like mentality and often provides logical advice to alleviate their various woes. His loyalty and affirming devotion also anchors the family, as things frequently threaten to spin out of control. Despite this, however, Johnny still \\"loses it himself all the time.\\" Whether it's his incredulous reaction to Alexis over-ordering his shipment of raw milk, or his exasperation at David misunderstanding what constitutes a tax write-off, Johnny maintains an underlying sense of \\"panic\\" over his family's lack of basic skills. Johnny is also frequently flummoxed by technology and new business techniques. These struggles include basic computer skills, such as navigating the Internet, and the use of social media to help grow one's business. He frequently falls back on his experience running Rose Video to help him navigate business dealings, even if those approaches are not the most up-to-date. = Critical reception = When Schitt's Creek premiered in 2015, many critics celebrated the return of Levy-O'Hara as a comedic duo. In an early review for The Hollywood Reporter, Whitney Matheson said much the show's \\"charm\\" is derived from seeing Levy and O'Hara portray \\"extreme, unsympathetic characters,\\" further arguing that only the seasoned professionals \\"could pull off the levels of deadpan required to convince us that, say, the parents can't remember their own daughter's middle name.\\" Brian Moylan of The Guardian called the series a nice \\"recipe for these two comedy vets to stretch their chops.\\" Moze Halperin of Flavorwire had a decidedly different reaction, calling Levy and O'Hara's performances \\"vacated\\" and \\"more actorly than comedic.\\" As the series progressed, critics reacted with far more praise. Vulture's Maggie Fremont declared Levy and O'Hara's characters the emotional \\"anchor\\" of the show, and Caroline Framke of Variety called the actor pairing a \\"reliable goldmine.\\" Critics also noted how Johnny Rose is a departure from most of Levy's previous roles. People Magazine's Gillian Telling said that rather than a \\"bumbling oaf or super-nerd,\\" Johnny Rose was \\"stronger\\" and \\"more confident.\\" Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair also called the role \\"against type\\" and Levy's portrayal smart and \\"surprisingly dashing.\\" The Guardian's Brian Moylan further appreciated the turn, saying the role let the actor be in \\"much finer form\\" than some of his previous roles. And Julie Miller, in a retrospective article on the character for Vanity Fair, declared Levy as Johnny Rose \\"may be the most brilliant of the actor‚Äôs nearly 50-year career‚Äîa masterclass in his deadpan gift.\\" = Accolades = For his work as Johnny Rose, Levy has been nominated for four consecutive Canadian Screen Awards for Best Performance by an Actor in a Continuing Leading Comedic Role, beginning in 2016. He subsequently won the award in 2016, beating out his on and off- screen son, Dan Levy. As part of the ensemble cast, the elder Levy also won two Canadian Screen Awards for Best Comedy in 2016 and 2019, with an additional nomination in 2017. In 2019, Levy received a Primetime Emmy nomination for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. In 2019, Levy and the Schitt's Creek cast were also honored with the ACTRA Award for Member's Choice Series Ensemble, an award for which they were also nominated in 2017 and 2018. The ensemble scored additional wins for TV Comedy of the Year and Unsung TV Show of the Year as part of the 2019 Dorian Awards. Other 2019 cast nominations included a GLAAD Award for Outstanding Comedy Series; a Critics Choice Award for Best Comedy Series; and a Television Critics Association Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy.

Background and events  From the 1933 Sergeants' Revolt onwards, Fulgencio Batista acted as an √©minence grise, making and undoing governments in Cuba. After eight years of government under the presidencies of Ram√≥n Grau (1944‚Äì1948) and Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s (1948‚Äì1952), Batista was one of the candidates in the 1952 election. However, as some of the polling put him in a distant third place, on March 10, 1952, just four months before the presidential election, Batista struck, claiming several unjustifiable reasons, using his position within the Army and being supported by some political sectors of the country. The coup itself was bloodless, but it attracted the attention and concern of most of the population. Batista overthrew President Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s, canceled the election and took control of the government as \\"Provisional President.\\" The United States recognized his government on March 27.This date is given in many sources although there is none that seemed to be clearly definitive. The closest is a recommendation from US Secretary of State Dean Acheson to President Truman on March 24 recommending recognition on that date:  Aftermath  Batista (whose rule was formalized after the 1954 general election) went on to rule the country until January 1, 1959, when he was forced into exile with his family (first to the Trujillo‚Äìruled Dominican Republic, then Corporatist Portugal and eventually Francoist Spain). Batista's exile marked the climax of the Cuban Revolution, which started on July 26, 1953 with the attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba, and saw Fidel Castro emerging as the new leader of Cuba.

Episodes feature interviews with notable climbers, conducted by host Chris Kalous. The podcast began publishing in 2011 and produces approximately two episodes per month.  History  The first episode of The Enormocast was released on December 9, 2011. Host and producer Chris Kalous, besides being a climber and writer, was a house painter who listened to podcasts to pass the time. He became interested in producing his own climbing-related podcast and leveraged his connections with friends and acquaintances in the climbing world to create the first set of episodes. The initial batch of episodes featured several notable climbers who Kalous personally knew, such as Steph Davis, a college acquaintance and mountaineer Hayden Kennedy. According to Kalous, a goal of the podcast was to \\"demystify climbing while simultaneously building its mythology.‚Äù Over time, the popularity of the podcast grew. According to Luke Mehall of The Climbing Zine, The Enormocast went from \\"an obscure show where the number of beers drank on air matched the listeners, to, dare I say, the most popular form of climbing media out there.\\"  Style and content  Each show, one or a few climbers sit for an approximately one hour long interview. Interviews are conducted in-person at a range of locations, with Kalous noting that, besides poor sound quality, \\"a face to face vibe is hard to match over distance.\\" According to Outside, \\"listening to Enormocast feels like being part of an exclusive club for climbers. The interviews get more personal than first ascents and bouldering grades.\\" Guests have included sport, traditional and ice climbers, as well as boulderers. Frequent topics have included mental strategies for climbing, the changing pathways for developing climbers with the advent of gyms and why people climb at all. Some interviews chronicle first person accounts of important moments or issues in recent climbing history. Shortly after his controversial bolt cutting actions on The Compressor route on Cerro Torre, Patagonia and subsequent arrest, with partner Jason Kruk, Hayden Kennedy discussed his rationale for doing so in a detailed interview on the podcast. Guest Sam Lightner Jr., then President of Friends of Indian Creek, a climbing advocacy organization, discussed issues of land access for climbers. The Enormocast served as a record of the life of Eric Bjornstad, author of Desert Rock and developer of many climbing routes, especially throughout the Southwestern United States, starting in the 1950s. Shortly after recording the interview, Bjornstad passed away. The podcast also conducted in depth interviews with other noted climbers from past climbing eras, like Lynn Hill and Henry Barber.  Reception  In 2016, Outside included it on a list of \\"eight best outdoorsy\\" podcasts. Climbing included it among \\"four favorite podcasts\\" in 2017, describing it as a \\"virtual campfire.\\" In 2019, TheClimbingGuy.com picked The Enormocast as the best climbing interview podcast, writing \\"Kalous examines the climbing lifestyle through subversive discussions and intriguing interviews with top climbers like Alex Honnold and Lynn Hill, as well as glorified tributes to rock warriors of the past.\\" Outside included the podcast in its 2019 list of 15 best outdoor- related podcasts, describing the show as \\"insidery and gossipy in the best sense.\\" In a review The Climbing Zine praised The Enormocast for bringing \\"freshness\\" to interviews with established figures in the climbing community, while also tackling \\"modern issues and challenges in the climbing world,\\" but noted that the show \\"has had its lows as well.

As a second-born son, he initially was called Sim√£o de Noronha, having only after the death of his father changed his name to Sim√£o Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara, by express determination of King Manuel I that the lineage and surname of the C√¢maras was to be kept by those governing the captaincy. His household was the second wealthiest in the country, surpassed only by that of the Dukes of Braganza. He became known as \\"the Magnificent\\" due to his liberality, opulent life, and generosity with which he repaid services done unto him; Gaspar Frutuoso says, in his nearly contemporary chronicle Saudades da Terra that \\"not a single person was ever denied anything from him, as he was of great and singular station, never setting aside what he had, and spending everything with great prudence in the service of his God and of his King.\\" =Papal embassy= Among the many displays of lavishness and greatness of Sim√£o da C√¢mara, the present he sent Pope Leo X in 1514, thanking him for the creation of the Diocese of Funchal, is particularly notable for its inventiveness; it was recorded by chronicler Jer√≥nimo Dias Leite. The offer was brought to the Pope by a large delegation of people dressed in dark velvet, in Portuguese fashion, led by Madeiran fidalgo Jo√£o de Leiria and Vicente Martins, a canon of Funchal Cathedral who delivered a speech in Latin before the pontiff. The delegation was presented by Manuel de Noronha, a prelate in Rome (later Bishop of Lamego) and the younger son of Sim√£o da C√¢mara himself. The gift was, along with an expensive Persian horse and many other products from the island, a miniature Apostolic Palace made out of sugar and real-size effigies of the Sacred College of Cardinals made in ‚Äîat that time, sugarcane was the primary resource of the island's economy, as sugar from Madeira attracted Genoese and Flemish traders and flooded the major European markets. =Donatary-Captain of Funchal= During his time as Donatary-Captain of Funchal, Madeira attained a great level of prosperity as an important trade hub. The growing importance and development of the town of Funchal, made it so it was raised to the status of city by royal charter on 17 August 1508. On 12 June 1514, a papal bull instituted the Diocese of Funchal. When King Manuel I appointed corregedor Diogo Taveira to investigate irregularities in the government of the captaincy, Sim√£o Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara felt this constituted an attack on his privileges and exemptions and decided to leave the country and settle instead in Castile in 1516. Midway through the voyage, once having landed in the Algarve, he heard that the Portuguese city of Asilah in Morocco was under siege by the Wattasid Sultan; he immediately went there with a reinforcement of seven-hundred men and was instrumental in the end of the siege. When he was in Seville, resuming his interrupted voyage, he received a letter from King Manuel I, recognising the importance of his assistance in the military victory in Asilah, hoping to repay him with further honours if he were to return to Portugal, which he did. In 1528, he abdicated from the captaincy of Funchal in favour of his son and successor, Jo√£o Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara. He retired to Matosinhos, near Porto in Mainland Portugal, where he died in 1530. His will determined that his mortal remains were to be taken to Madeira Island, to be interred near those of his parents and grandparents in the , in Funchal.

He was also a member of the Central Indonesian National Committee since 1945.  Early life  Basuki Probowinoto was born on January 19, 1917 in Tlogomulyo, Purwodadi, Central Java, Dutch East Indies. He was born from the father Mateus Rahmat and Rokayah. Since he was in school, Probowinoto frequently leaped class. After he finished his basic studies, he went on to the teacher's school in Purwodadi. After finishing his studies there, he entered the theological school. Prior to his entry in the school, he was requested to teach in schools of Purwodadi, and invited to preach in local churches. During his time in the theological school, his teacher, Professor Verkuyl, considered him as a nationalist thinker. Verkuyl stated that Probowinoto had a holistic approach, and considered him as a \\"religious man who is interested in nation-building and church development\\". After he finished his theological school, he went to Jakarta to serve in the Javanese Christian Church, which his teacher said \\"had urgent and complex matters\\".  Japanese occupation  During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Probowinoto was accused of cooperation with the Dutch. To cope with the accusation, Probowinoto maintained a good relationship with the Japanese, with the help of a Japanese reverend. The relationship was used to deliver evidence about the cruelty of the Japanese Army in Indonesia and to explain the position of Christianity during the occupation more objectively. With his connection, he managed to gather several Christian figures in Indonesia to form an organization for the independence struggle of Indonesia.  In the Javanese Christian Church  After the independence, Probowinoto was chosen as the General Secretary of the Javanese Christian Church. Under his leadership, the Javanese Christian Church implemented the \\"partnership in obedience\\" idealism by pairing Indonesian and Dutch workers as colleagues. These select foreign fraternal workers were able to supply technical leadership in education, social rehabilitation, and leadership training. More western women are attached to the operations of this church today than to any other church body in Indonesia. On the staff, or under appointment, are several from the Netherlands, England, the United States, the Philippines, New Zealand, and Australia.  Political career  = In the Indonesian Christian Party = Probowinoto was the delegate from the Javanese Christian Church during the meeting discussing the formation of the party on 9 November 1945. He was chosen as the chairman of the party on its first congress in Surakarta. He was chosen as the representative of Parkindo in the Central Indonesian National Committee since its third session on November 1945. After the dissolution of the committee in 1950, he was chosen as the member of the Regional People's Representative Council in Central Java and Salatiga, and later as a member of the Temporary People's Representative Council. He was the chairman of the Regional People's Representative Council of Salatiga, from 1951 until 1954.  Proposal as National Hero of Indonesia  Probowinoto was proposed as the National Hero of Indonesia by the Christian University of Satya Wacana and the Indonesian Communication Foundation in the symposium \\"Tracing the Roots of the Thoughts and Phenomenal Works of Reverend Basuki Probowinoto\\". Both organizations stated that they had made a recommendation to the government to make Probowinoto the National Hero of Indonesia. The consideration was due to his creation of the Christian Scouting, Satya Wacana Christian University, and his works that were made through the Javanese Christian Church and Indonesian Christian Party.

Mr. Settee became the school head in 1880. Boarding began on 1888. Accordingly, the name changed to Gordon Boarding School in 1889, and then to Gordon's Indian School in 1893, and then Gordon's Indian Residential School in 1926. On February 1, 1929, a fire destroyed the school building, and a replacement opened the following year. The church managed the school's affairs until 1946, when the Indian and Eskimo Welfare Commission took control, but continued to provide chaplains. Problems with a water supply and maintenance led to its being closed for much of the time between 1947 and 1953. The Canadian government began directly operating the school on April 1, 1969. The educational sector became the Gordon Day School while the dormitory became the Gordon Student Residence.

In South Korea, it was a society that could not guarantee Work life-balance historically and legally. But a few years ago in Korea, Warabel emerged as a neologism, changing the perception of people's work and keeping their basic rights. There are two major movements: Improving law and improving people's perceptions.  Work life-balance in Korea  Work‚Äìlife balance (ÏõåÎùºÎ∞∏) means work and life balance. Warabal (ÏõåÎùºÎ∞∏) is a newly coined term that has emerged as the tendency to value quality of life rather than annual salary increases. Rather than getting a high salary from a good company, he feels happy to enjoy his life with proper working hours and salaries. Recently, the so-called \\"life with evening,\\" which is described as \\"work & life Balance,\\" has become a basic human value. Warabel, which is favored by young people these days, has as much to gain as to lose. While you can get a communal life, such as family conversations, child care issues and family happiness, you have to give up much of your personal needs, such as salary and promotion at work. For an ideal world called Warabal to be realized, both welfare and basic income, the basic condition of human life, must be resolved.  Labor History of South Korea and the recognition process of Waravel  Through economic development in the 1960s, Korean society changed from an agricultural society to an industrial one. In the 1970s, export-oriented heavy and chemical industrialization achieved considerable growth. But this was a low-paying, long-time system, centered on labor-intensive industries. In other words, Warabal was not only not made in South Korean society, but it was also not recognized. After Jeon Tae-il died in Cheonggye Plaza on November 13, 1970, shouting, \\"We are not machines\\" and \\"Follow the Labor Standards Act,\\" the peace market was ordered to abide by the Labor Standards Act and the dream of forming a labor union was realized. The words 'we are not machines' prompted Jeon to reconsider who we are and think about the human rights of workers who are not protected by the law as well as workers. This incident was the beginning of South Korea's Warabal. In today's Korean society, Warabal is a satisfactory state of life that properly distributes energy and time to work and daily life, drawing a lot of attention from office workers. But still in Korean society, Warabal is incomplete. This is a natural response that the Korean society, which has been struggling with growth, has come up with after suffering low growth and job insecurity. In fact, Korea ranked 36th in the OECD's \\"Better Life Index\\" in 2016, the lowest among 38 countries. Recently, South Korea has been trying to raise awareness of Warabal. In 2018, mobile apps that can help Warabal have become popular in South Korea. According to a 2017 social survey released by the National Statistical Office last year, the highest percentage of respondents who were not satisfied with their leisure life after work was \\"economic burden.\\" As a result, PT (Personal Translation) training app and foreign language 1:1 private tutoring service are gaining popularity recently. Also, classes to develop your hobbies and talents after work are becoming popular. In 2019, the South Korean company has recently released products that automatically shut down its computers at the end of working hours and allow people to conveniently report to and from work via mobile apps. It will allow employees to use work hours more flexibly and comply with the legal working hours of up to 52 hours.  South Korean laws and policies regarding labor  These changes can also be confirmed in the 2017 social survey results The number of respondents who said families took precedence over work increased from 11.9 percent in 2015 to 13.9 percent in 2017, while those who said work was priority dropped from 53.7 percent in 2015 to 43.1 percent in 2017. It is expected that the shorter working hours will improve the quality of life for workers with the aim of not only creating new jobs but also realizing Wara Valley, which means work-life balance. However, not everyone is welcoming the reduction of working hours, which values Warabal. Many companies are concerned about labor shortages, rising labor costs, worsening profitability and falling competitiveness due to shorter working hours. But recently, companies have been conducting in-house campaigns to implement warabels. LS Mirae Institute each conducted \\"Family Happiness Camp ‚Äì Camp with Dad,\\" a two-day waravel program involving employees and primary and secondary school children. The Family Happiness Camp is a program where all family members, including fathers, mothers and children, participate in, coaching each other on childcare and education, writing letters to each other, making crafts, enhancing family intimacy and building harmony. Work‚Äìlife balance in South Korea (Warabal) is also closely related to various areas, such as women's jobs and child care. Women often have to quit their jobs if the work-life balance is not maintained. Therefore, policies for work- life balance include women's job policies and child care policies. As working mothers in Korea are suffering from child rearing and domestic labor while working, a vicious cycle of quitting their jobs or giving birth is taking place. According to the nation's women's participation in economic activities by age, with the exception of those under 0s and 60s and older, the employment rate of women in their 30s was the lowest at 60.1 percent, and the employment rate of women form M. Lowest in 30's and slowly recover. The reasons for career discontinuation are marriage (40.4%), pregnancy and childbirth (38.3%), family member Dol (12.9%), preschool child rearing (6.9%), and preschooler education (1.5%). = Labor Standards Act = The main points of the revised Labor Standards Act of 2018 are as follows: # Reduced from a maximum of 68 hours a week to 52 hours, including overtime and holiday work. # Maximum working hours for workers younger than 18 are reduced from 40 hours per week to 35 hours per week. # Making it mandatory for private companies to take paid holidays in legal holiday. # Businesses with fewer than 30 employees are temporarily admitted to special extended work - in the case of using workers with less than 30 employees at all times, the working hours may be extended to a range not exceeding 8 hours per week in addition to the extended working hours, upon written agreement with the worker's representative. = Politicies for women = # The pregnancy work hour reduction system: The new pregnancy work hour reduction system, established in 2014, is a system that requires users to allow female workers within 12 weeks of pregnancy or 36 weeks after their pregnancy to apply for two hours of work per day. Since March 2016, it has expanded to all workplaces regardless of the size of their businesses and has been in operation. # maternity leave: When the Labor Standards Act was enacted in 1953, maternity leave was introduced as a 60-day leave system, and as the vacation period was extended from 60 days to 90 days in November 2001, the expanded 30-day pay was started to be shared and paid from employment insurance. The maternity leave is available to all pregnant female workers who work at all workplaces with one or more employees.

It uses an interpolation formula to assign data to the bucket. A general interpolation formula is: Interpolation = INT(((Array[ i ] - min) / (max - min)) * (ArraySize -1)) Algorithm Interpolation sort (or histogram sort). It is a sorting algorithm that uses the interpolation formula to disperse data divide and conquer. Interpolation sort is also a variant of bucket sort algorithm. The interpolation sort method uses an array of record bucket lengths corresponding to the original number column. By operating the maintenance length array, the recursive algorithm can be prevented from changing the space complexity to O(n^ 2) due to memory stacking. The segmentation record of the length array can using secondary function dynamically declare and delete the memory space of the array. The space complexity required to control the recursive program is O(3n). Contains a two-dimensional array of dynamically allocated memories and an array of record lengths. However the execution complexity can still be maintained as an efficient sorting method of O(n + k). Array of dynamically allocated memory can be implemented by linked list, stack, queue, associative array, tree structure, etc. An array object such as JavaScript is applicable. The difference in data structure is related to the speed of data access and thus the time required for sorting.When the values in the ordered array are uniformly distributed approximately the arithmetic progression, the linear time of interpolation sort ordering is O(n). =Interpolation sort algorithm= #Set a bucket length array to record the length of the unsorted bucket.

If the maximum value is equal to the minimum value, the sorting is completed to stop Divide. #Set up a two-dimensional array as all empty buckets.

Applying the bucket sorting and dividing method, the array data is distributed into a limited number of buckets by mathematical interpolation formula, and the bucket then recursively the original processing program until the sorting is completed. Interpolation tag sort is a recursive sorting method for interpolation sorting. To avoid stacking overflow caused by recursion, the memory crashes. Instead, use a Boolean data type tag array to operate the recursive function to release the memory. The extra memory space required is close to 2n+(n)bits. Contains a two-dimensional array of dynamically allocated memory and a Boolean data type tag array. Stack, queue, associative array, and tree structure can be implemented as buckets. As the JavaScript array object is suitable for this sorting method, the difference in data structure is related to the speed of data access and thus the time required for sorting. The linear time Œò(n) is used when the values in the array to be sorted are evenly distributed. The bucket sort algorithm does not limit the sorting to the lower limit of O(n log n). Interpolation tag sort average performance complexity is O(n + k).

If the sorting is not completed, the [Divide function] is executed. #[Divide function] Find the maximum and minimum values in the bucket. If the maximum value is equal to the minimum value, the sorting is completed and the division is stopped. #Set up a two-dimensional array as all the empty buckets. Divide into the bucket according to the interpolation number. #After dividing into the bucket, mark the starting position of the bucket as a true value in the tag array. And put the items back into the original array one by one from all the buckets that are not empty. #Return to [Main Sort].

In- place Interpolation Tag Sort can achieve sorting by only N times of swapping by maintaining N bit tags; however, the array to be sorted must be a continuous integer sequence and not repeated, or the series is completely evenly distributed to approximate The number of arithmetical progression. The factor column data must not be repeated. For example, sorting 0~100 can be sorted in one step. The number of exchanges is: O(n), the calculation time complexity is: O(n), and the worst space complexity is O(n)bits. If the characteristics of the series meet the conditional requirements of this sorting method: \\"The array is a continuous integer or an arithmetical progression that does not repeat\\", the in-place interpolation tag sort will be an excellent sorting method that is extremely fast and saves memory space. In-place Interpolation Tag Sort Algorithm In-place Interpolation Tag Sort sorts non-repeating consecutive integer series, only one Boolean data type tag array with the same length as the original array, the array calculates the interpolation of the data from the beginning, and the interpolation points to a new position of the array. Position, the position that has been swapped is marked as true in the corresponding position of the tag array, and is incremented until the end of the array is sorted. Algorithm process: # Set an equal number of tag arrays to initialize to false values. # Visit the array when tag[i] is false, calculate the position corresponding to the interpolation=p. # Swap a[i] and a[p], let tag[p] = true. # The tour array is completed and the sorting is completed.

Without such tag bits, he concludes \\"it seems reasonable to conjecture that every algorithm will require for in-situ permutation at least O(n log n) steps on the average.\\" The In-place Interpolation Tag Sort is one of the sorting algorithms that the Donald Knuth professor said: \\"manipulate n extra \\"tag\\" bits...finding the cycle leaders, and in-situ permutations could easily be performed in O(n) time\\". Similar sorting method #Flashsort #Proxmap sort #American flag sort =Bucket sort mixing other sorting methods and recursive algorithm= Bucket sort can be mixed with other sorting methods to complete sorting. If it is sorted by bucket sort and insert sort, also is a fairly efficient sorting method. But when the series appears a large deviation from the value: For example, when the maximum value of the series is greater than N times the next largest value. After the series of columns are processed, the distribution is that all the elements except the maximum value fall into the same bucket. The second sorting method uses insert sort. May cause execution complexity to fall into O(n^2). This has lost the meaning and high-speed performance of using bucket sort. Interpolation sort is a way of recursively using bucket sort. After performing recursion, still use bucket sort to disperse the series. This can avoid the above situation. If you want to make the recursive interpolation sort execution complexity fall into O(n^2), it is necessary to present a factorial amplification in the entire series. In fact, there is very little chance that a series of special distributions will occur.

Early life  Bennetta Camille Bullock was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, one of the eight children of Rev. George Oliver Bullock and Rebecca Bullock. Her father was a prominent Baptist minister. The Bullock family moved to Washington, D.C. when Bennetta was young, and there she attended Dunbar High School and Howard University before she earned a Ph.D. in counseling psychology from Catholic University of America. Her dissertation title was \\"Background factors and adjustment: A study of the socio-economic and personal factors in the school and subsequent adjustment of a selected group of high school students\\". President Richard Nixon shakes hands with Walter Washington after his being sworn-in as Mayor-Commissioner of Washington, D.C. Bennetta Bullock Washington stands between her husband and Judge Edward A. Tamm.  Career  Washington taught in Baltimore and Washington before she moved into school administration. She served as principal of Cardozo High School from 1961 to 1964. She was director of the Cardozo Project in Urban Education, and served on the President's Commission on Juvenile Delinquency. From this work came her book, Youth in Conflict: Helping Behavior-Problem Youth in a School Setting (1963). Of her work with troubled students, she commented, \\"You have to learn how to handle hostility. You don't handle hostility with hostility. It takes receptivity and empathy ‚Äî don't say sympathy; that's maudlin and doesn't help at all.\\" As an education specialist, she was a member of John Lindsay's Advisory Panel on Decentralization of New York City Public Schools, in 1967, and was a professor of education at the City College of New York. She was Martin Luther King Scholar in Residence at Rutgers University in 1969. Beginning in 1964, Bennetta Washington was founder and director of the Job Corps for Women, a program of the U. S. Department of Labor, and in that role oversaw the creation of job training centers for young women throughout the United States. From 1970 to 1973 she was associate director, Women's Programs and Education, in the Manpower Administration of the Department of Labor. She retired from the Department of Labor in 1981. Washington's husband was Mayor- Commissioner of Washington, D.C. from 1967 to 1974, and mayor from 1974 to 1979. Bennetta Washington was considered the first lady of the District of Columbia during her husband's terms in office, and was a trusted adviser to the mayor. In 1968, she was invited to one of Lady Bird Johnson's lunch meetings of \\"Women Doers\\", joining singer Eartha Kitt and others to discuss juvenile delinquency and the Vietnam War. In 1969, she was honored by Wilson College with an honorary doctorate. In 1971, she was honored by the National Council of Negro Women, at the same ceremony honoring Shirley Chisholm, Barbara Watson, and Elizabeth Duncan Koontz. In 1975, Washington hosted a luncheon in honor of visiting first lady of Zambia, Betty Kaunda, at the Museum of African Art, attended by Cecilia Suyat Marshall, Roselyn P. Epps, Dorothy Height, Helen Elsie Austin, and other noted women in Washington. Washington was one of the participants in a recorded symposium, Kin & Communities, at the Smithsonian Institution in 1977, alongside Rosalynn Carter, Alex Haley, Hubert Humphrey, Margaret Mead, and Sidney Dillon Ripley.  Personal life  Bennetta Bullock married Walter Washington in 1941. They had a daughter, Bennetta Jules-Rosette, who became a sociology professor and a biographer of Josephine Baker.

Daley, Johan Kugelberg and Paul Major, and it was published by Sinecure Books in 2013. The book focuses on the music of the late 1950s to the early 1990s and presents the annals of the homemade records mini- industry of that era. The book forays into the subculture of homemade records and explores how the trend of vanity pressings emerged in this period as a way of outstanding works of music by artists with their own money. Much akin to the self-publishing industry, the subculture was based primarily on the belief of the artists that their music was outstanding and significant enough to reach the public even though their small-scale editions had very limited or no scope of distribution.  Background  The editors and authors of the book have engaged in a search and discovery of these editions in yard sales and thrift stores and even random places and attempted a chronicling of their histories. In an interview with the BBC about the book, Kugelberg talked about their work and their aim of unearthing \\"the music ‚Äì and the artworks ‚Äì created by Americans who may never have made it big ‚Äì but who at least made a record.\\" With these hidden artworks as the subject and context, the book delves into an extensive study of the subculture. Talking about their work, Michael P. Daley said in an interview with Vice that \\"it took over three years to make the actual book. However, the collectors whose archives we dug into have been amassing the contents for several decades.\\" He further added that they even dug through old newspapers and googled through old records to find possible links and thus creating chronologies for the found vinyl and works. It was through this process that they often ended up meeting the actual surviving performers, some of whom even helped in plugging the information gaps and provided insights. Daley recounted that the backstories for the vinyl often had different motives ‚Äì while some only aimed at popularity, others often used them for money laundering or as souvenirs for live performances. Enjoy The Experience: Homemade Records 1958‚Äì1992 also included a download code for the readers, which allowed downloading of selected tracks mentioned in the book.  Reception  The book has received much critical acclaim by stalwarts and critics in the field, and the publication news has been covered by sites like Esquire, Vice, BBC and more. In the media coverage of the book, Esquire magazine reports that the book has received much praise from film director Larry Clark. Sasha Frere-Jones, a music critic of The New Yorker, has also provided positive reviews on the book. Greg Beets of Austin Chronicle praised the book writing that, \\"Enjoy the Experience chronicles the golden age of private pressings with contagious aplomb.\\" Andrew Frisicano of Time Out Magazine praised the book concept and how it traces the stories behind the creation of those records and their creators along with the study of the recordings themselves.

Moriarty was O'Connor's political mentor and Martinelli worked as O'Connor's campaign manager when he ran for U.S. attorney. Political career =State representative= O'Connor began his political career in 1952 as a candidate for the Massachusetts House of Representatives seat in the 5th Hampden District. He finished first in the fourteen candidate Democratic primary, which was tantamount to election. =Mayor of Springfield= In 1957, O'Connor swept all 68 of the city's precincts to defeated 12-year incumbent Daniel B. Brunton for the Democratic nomination for mayor of Springfield. He then beat Republican C. Clement Easton 31,561 votes to 20,826 in the general election. At 32 years old he was the youngest mayor ever elected in city history. In 1959 he easily defeated Brunton in a primary rematch 21,975 votes to 6,630 and Republican Paul E. Affleck and Brunton, who ran as an independent, 39,409 votes to Affleck's 11,424 and Brunton's 1,910. During the campaign he received the endorsement of The Springfield Union, a Republican newspaper. During his tenure as Mayor, O'Connor oversaw a downtown road system and urban renewal project that received $3 million in federal funds. Due to these funds he was also able to lower the city's tax rate. In 1959 the University of Massachusetts' bureau of government research named Springfield \\"the outstanding city in the Commonwealth\\". =U.S. Senate campaign= On June 15, 1960, O'Connor announced he would challenge Governor Foster Furcolo for the Democratic nomination for United States Senate seat held by Leverett Saltonstall. Furcolo defeated O'Connor by a 3 to 1 margin at the Democratic State Convention, but O'Connor decided to remain in the race. In the primary, O'Connor upset Furcolo 48% to 39% with Edmund C. Buckley received the remaining 13%. O'Connor was able to sweep the western part of the state and top Furcolo by 10,000 in Boston. During the general election, O'Connor contrasted his youth to Saltonstall's age, calling him \\"yesterday's senator\\" and \\"The Late George Apley of Massachusetts politics\\" and attacked the senator for \\"fail[ing] to act for the working man\\". Saltonstall in turn criticized O'Connor's campaign for lacking substance. After refusing to debate O'Connor, Saltonstall stated \\"If my opponent would express his opinions of some of the vital national and international issues, I would then consider whether I would debate on these subjects or not\\". Saltonstall defeated O'Connor 1,358,556 votes to 1,050,725 to hold on to his Senate seat. =Defeat for reelection= A 1960 reassessment of all of real estate in the city led to a furor when 1/3 of the Springfield's homeowners saw increases over their 1959 tax. On October 11, 1960, 4,500 residents attended a meeting at Springfield Auditorium where members of the Board of Assessors attempted to explain the tax increase. Each member was booed off the stage before they could speak and O'Connor, who had no role in the property reassessment, failed to quiet the crowd and police were called in. O'Connor planned to cut 578 jobs from the 1961 budget in order to reduce the city's taxes, however he reversed this decision due to a lack of public support. In 1961, O'Connor faced eight challengers in the city's first non-partisian election. He finished first in the preliminary election with 34% of the vote. In the general election, attorney Charles V. Ryan upset O'Connor 28,999 (52%) votes to 26,271 (48%). Two weeks after O'Connor's loss, the city's percentage assessment system, which had been a major issue during the campaign, was declared unconstitutional by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. =County Commissioner= In 1980, O'Connor defeated incumbent Richard S. Thomas to win a seat on the Hampden County Commission. He was reelected in 1984, 1988, and 1992. =Run for district attorney= In 1990, Hampden County District Attorney Matthew J. Ryan, Jr. retired and O'Connor, his longtime friend, was seen as his favored successor. During the campaign, O'Connor tried to distance himself from the scandal-plagued Ryan by contrasting his liberal positions on the death penalty, affirmative action, and the war on drugs to those of the conservative Ryan. O'Connor spent $200,000 of his own and turned over have of his campaign fund to noted political consultant Joseph Napolitan. O'Connor pledged to only serve two terms, although according to The Boston Globe's Kevin Cullen, given O'Connor age, smoking habit, and recovery from a near-fatal illness several years before \\"even his friends say they would be surprised if O'Connor would or could serve more than one\\". O'Connor was seen as a co-front runner with William M. Bennett. Bennett, the more conservative candidate, was able to attract the majority of financial contributors and campaign volunteers, as well as endorsement from former federal prosecutors, Ryan's former assistants, and Judd Carhart, the president of the state district attorneys' association. The other two Democratic candidates Eugene J. Mulcahy and Michael T. Kogut, were described by Cullen as \\"credible candidates\\" who were \\"unable to raise a fraction of the money that O'Connor and Bennett have\\". The race ended up being close with Bennett winning by 513 votes. O'Connor finished in fourth place with 22% of the vote to Bennett's 27%, Kogut's 26%, and Mulcahy's 25%. O'Connor believed his defeat was due to Ryan's support of his campaign, explaining that \\"The people who supported Matty would ordinarily support me, but they didn't like my liberal positions and the liberals were suspicious of me because of my friendship with Matty.\\" Death On September 11, 1996, O'Connor died following a long illness. At the time of his death, O'Connor was running for reelection to the Hampden County Commission.

He was also the member of the Central Indonesian National Committee since 1947.  Early life  Melanchton Siregar was born on August 7, 1912 in Lumban Silo, Pearung, Paranginan, Humbang Hasundutan, North Sumatra, Dutch East Indies. When he was eight years old, he entered the Gouvernment Hollandsch Inlandsch School in Balige, the elementary school provided by the Dutch for local Indonesians. After finishing his elementary school, he went to the Christelijke Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs in Tarutung, the junior high school for Christians. He went to Java after his basic studies were finished. He studied in the Christelijke Hollands Indische Kweekschool (HIS) in 1935, and later in the Gouvernment Hoofdacte Cursus (GHS) in 1938. After obtaining diploma in the GHS, he went back to North Sumatra to fulfill his duty as the head of family, since his mother had died during his time in Java.  Career  In North Sumatra, he began his career by teaching at the Joshua Institute in Medan for several years. Then, he taught in the Christelijke HIS in Narumoda, and with several friends he established the Christelijke HIS for the Batak Christian Protestant Church in Sidikalang. Shortly afterwards, Siregar was called by the government to teach in the state school of Hollands Indische Kweekschool in Tebingtinggi. He taught there for four years until the Japanese came to Sumatra.  Japanese occupation  During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Siregar was asked to teach in the Tyu Gakko, equivalent of Junior High School in Japanese system, but shortly after, he was arrested and was put in custody alongside his Achmad Delui Rangkuti. He was convicted of being a spy and was sentenced to death, but he was freed and soon he taught again in the school.  Indonesian National Revolution = Career = After the independence of Indonesia, Siregar became the Director of Technical Institute of Pematang Siantar. Alongside his friends, Marnix Hutasoit, Philip Lumbantobing, and AMS Siahaan, Siregar established many schools in Pematang Siantar, such as General High School, Agricultural Institute, Teacher School, Economy Institute, and Technical Institute. The students were also soldiers, making the places as an instrument to develop fighting and intellectual skills. = Against the Dutch = During the Operation Product and Operation Kraai launched by the Dutch to invade North Sumatra, the North Sumatra branch of Indonesian Christian Party formed the Arrow Division. The division was headed by Siregar as a titular colonel, codenamed Partahuluk Raso (). Several personnel were originally his student or would become his student. Originally, the HQ of the division was in Pematang Siantar, but later moved to Muara. Together with his friend Bosar Sianipar, code named Mondar Mandir (), Siregar and him became one of the most wanted figures by the Dutch Army. The division was widely popular in Pematang Siantar due to the divisions' all out defense against the massive Dutch army that managed to broke through the fortifications of Medan Area Lembung. To eliminate Siregar, the Dutch Army twice bombed the division's HQ. The first one was in Pematang Siantar, which forced him and his division flee to North Tapanuli. The second one was in Lintongnihuta, where the Dutch alleged him to be. In reality, his division was in another place, the Sitio-Tio Cave, not far from Lintongnihuta. The purpose of the Arrow Division wasn't only to fight against the Dutch. The division also opened trade networks so that logistics for troops can be channeled smoothly. Other than that, the trade network was kept by Siregar as the lifeline for the villagers who rely on farming and agriculture to live. To fulfil the needs, Siregar kept markets nearby opened so that villagers can trade and stockpiled the commodities of the village. In his meantime, he also taught villagers around him. To fulfill the education needs, he recruited his ex-students to be the teacher. Due to his concurrent position as the head of the Simalungun Volksfront in 1946 and as the head of the Defense Body of East Sumatra and Sumatra, he frequently accompanied the military commander of Indonesia to negotiate with the Dutch Army.  Political career  = In the Parki = Siregar was originally from the Parki party, a party similar to the Indonesian Christian Party that was located in Sumatra. Siregar was one of the founders of the party, and became its second chairman. During his time in Parki, Siregar became the working member of the City Council of Pematang Siantar. Parki officially merged into Parkindo in its congress on Parapat from 10‚Äì20 April 1947. = In the Indonesian Christian Party =  Nomination as National Hero of Indonesia  Siregar was nomination as the National Hero of Indonesia at the 100th anniversary of his birth. The nomination was sent to the government on 2013 and 2015 by the committee of the 100th anniversary of his birth. In April 2016, the committee also sent a letter to the president about the title. The document relating to the nomination was processed through the government of Humbang Hasundutan and the government of North Sumatra, and later delivered to the President of Indonesia. The secretary of the committee, Ronald Sihombing, stated that the nomination was based on the accounts of historian, the stories of Siregar's friend, and from scholarly references. The nomination was supported by Try Sutrisno, the 6th Vice President of Indonesia.

It limited holders of FM licenses in cities of more than 100,000 who also held AM licenses to simulcasting no more than 50 percent of their AM signal on the FM station. The commissioners considered the excessive simulcasting wasteful and an impediment to the development of FM broadcasting. A year later, the FCC reaffirmed the rule, and, after a delay requested by broadcasters, set its effective date for October 1965; some stations were granted exemptions if they could demonstrate their simulcasting served the public good. Broadcasters generally resisted the rule at first, claiming it was overregulation that would impose considerable costs on stations for new personnel and equipment. It was challenged in court as a violation of the First Amendment and upheld in a decision written by future Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger. Later the FCC extended the rule's requirements to 75 percent original content on FM stations and its applicability to stations in cities of more than 25,000. The rule's implementation led to the rise of freeform radio in the late 1960s, where disk jockeys played whatever music they wanted without regard to genre or format, taking advantage of FM's higher sound quality and stereo capability. Most of their playlists tended toward rock of the era; in later years the canon of music and artists that developed evolved into the album- oriented and eventually classic rock formats. This growth often came at the expense of the classical music stations which had previously dominated the FM dial. By the late 1970s FM music stations had more listeners than their AM counterparts, even as they had largely moved away from their freeform roots, and in the 1980s the FCC repealed the rule to help AM stations, which had declined as FM grew. Background Since the advent of commercial radio broadcasting in the United States during the 1920s, broadcasters and listeners had lamented the problem of static on its AM signals, usually created by interference from electrical storms. Engineers began to work on developing technology to transmit and receive higher-frequency signals above 40MHz over great distances. By the mid-1930s, Edwin Howard Armstrong had developed frequency modulation (FM) technology that could propagate signals widely with no static at all. Several issues hindered FM's commercial establishment until the late 1940s. One was litigation over patents between Armstrong and RCA, Armstrong's former employer. RCA had chosen to invest heavily in television, another new technology. Regulatory disputes with the newly-created Federal Communications Commission and the intervention of World War II also played a role. Many FM stations soon had to shut down for lack of a market, despite the superior audio quality they offered, since listeners had to purchase FM- capable receivers. Armstrong's suicide in 1954 further adversely affected FM since he had financially supported Continental, one of the few FM networks at the time. alt=A small rectangular brown box with a metallic coppery top on a beige carpet. On its front are two dials and a tuner with a range between 88 and 108 FM's fortunes began to turn in the late 1950s with television's rapid growth and AM radio's increasingly crowded dial. Popular music formats replaced scripted radio programming and variety shows migrated to TV. This left broadcasters looking for new directions to expand their markets. In 1957 the number of applications for FM licenses increased for the first time in almost a decade, primarily in smaller markets that had run out of space for new television or AM channels. In larger markets, the proliferation of AM stations had led the FCC to restrict many of the newer ones to daytime-only to avoid interference; since the FCC did not require that restriction for FM radio, it was a logical place for broadcasters to go. The increasing popularity of stereophonic recordings also helped FM's growth. In 1952, New York City-area classical music station WQXR had hit on the idea of simulcasting on its AM and FM stations, with each carrying a different channel, so listeners could use two radios to create a stereo experience; other stations, mostly classical and jazz, followed the practice. Because the FCC frowned on that as a waste of spectrum, in 1961 it approved technical standards for wideband FM stereo broadcasting via the multiplexing capability of the higher frequencies and the first full-stereo wideband FM stations began broadcasting within months. Many existing FM stations still carried the same signal as their AM sister stations, assuming that FM was merely an added bonus for listeners who wanted the higher sound quality and were willing to pay for equipment to get it. Broadcasters at the time saw such little value in their FM stations that they gave advertising time away with purchases on their AM stations. Rule =Proposition, adoption and criticism= By 1963 the FCC was dominated by Kennedy administration appointees, led by chairman Newton Minow, who were interested in increasing competition in certain sectors of the radio market. That year the commission first discussed the possibility of restricting AM-FM duplication. While it had tolerated the practice initially since it allowed FM stations to get on the air, it now saw it as a waste of spectrum. The commissioners settled on a rule that limited AM stations licensed in cities of more than 100,000 people to no more than 50% duplication of their AM signal on an affiliated FM station. Duplication was defined as either the simulcasting of the signal or its rebroadcast within 24 hours. Stations had until August 1965 to comply. \\"[T]he broadcast of a single program by two channels is inefficient\\" the FCC explained in its 1964 annual report. \\"The Commission feels that this is a significant move toward the time when AM and FM will be regarded as component parts of a total aural service for assignment purposes\\" it said. It hoped also that it would \\"give new impetus to FM developments.\\" Many broadcasters resisted the new rule, citing the costs it would impose on them to hire air staff and find studio space for the additional FM content. In early 1965, the FCC extended the deadline for compliance two months, until October of that year, and announced that stations that could demonstrate their simulcasting served the public good would be exempted from the rule. Commissioner Kenneth Cox spoke in defense of the rule at the 1965 convention of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), the industry trade group. Generally, he said, duplication was \\"a luxury we can't afford\\". More specifically, he also pointed to the unfair advantage simulcast FM stations had over those that had no AM counterpart, since the former sold their advertising time at no additional charge to advertisers who bought time on the AM station. In response, Ben Strouse, president of Washington's WWDC-FM and chair of the NAB's FM committee, said that his market was already well served and that requiring additional programming would leave many stations pursuing market segments too small to support them, to the detriment of the industry and the FCC's good intentions. \\"[S]ometimes the love of a government agency can be the kiss of death\\" he warned. While praising the FCC's general support for FM, he said, the agency \\"loves [it] too much.\\" At least one broadcaster from a smaller market did not seem to mind. Oliver Keller, the president of WTAX in Springfield, Illinois, told The New York Times he welcomed the rule as serving the public interest. He was already offering different programming anyway on his AM and FM stations, telling the newspaper that the next day the former would be broadcasting live coverage of the Gemini 3 spaceflight launch while the latter would continue playing music. Almost 150 stations filed for exemptions; the FCC granted 30 of them on a long-term basis. Most were for stations whose AM signal was still restricted to the daylight hours. Two were for New York stations that broadcast in foreign languages and also had constraints on their programming. WHOM (now WZRC and WNYL-FM respectively), was a daytime-only station which broadcast in Spanish, and Yiddish-language WEVD, which shared its frequency with two other stations. Two stations in Puerto Rico were also granted long-term exemptions for purely technical reasons: their FM transmissions were the only way their signals could reach the entire island. An additional 12 stations were granted short- term exemptions for economic reasons, because they needed more time and money to get a separate FM service set up. =Legal challenge= By the beginning of 1967, after several additional delays and requests for exemptions, Section 73.242 of the FCC's code of regulations had been amended and the rule had taken full effect. Shortly afterwards, San Francisco's KKHI, one of the stations to which the FCC had granted a temporary exemption good through April of that year, appealed the denial of its application for a permanent exemption to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has appellate jurisdiction over administrative actions of federal agencies. KKHI also challenged the Non-Duplication Rule itself as being outside the FCC's authority and an unconstitutional infringement of its right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment. KKHI had sought its exemption primarily on the grounds that it was the only classical music station in the Bay Area. As evidence that the exemption was in the public interest, it introduced a survey of its listeners showing that they strongly supported continued simulcasting, especially since they liked to listen both at home and in their cars. Further, KKHI argued that the costs of compliance would be prohibitive and that it had the exclusive right to decide what programming to offer its listeners without the FCC's interference. It made an additional argument on procedural grounds, that the commission should have at least held a hearing before denying the exemption application. The circuit's chief judge, David L. Bazelon, was chosen for the panel that would hear the case. With him were E. Barrett Prettyman, a former chief judge of the court now on senior status, and Warren Burger, chosen several years later to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. It heard oral arguments in the case in November. In May 1968, the court handed down its decision. Unanimously, it held for the FCC. Burger wrote for the court that the commission had said that it would not consider exemptions based purely on a station's choice of programming alone, unless there was something exceptional about that programming as there was in the cases of WEVD and WHOM. Two other classical stations, New York's WQXR and Washington's WGMS, had applied for exemptions on the same grounds as KKHI and been denied, Burger noted, while KDFC, another San Francisco classical station, was granted its exemption since, unlike KKHI, it was daytime-only. \\"The major premise on which the rule was postulated ‚Äî wasteful frequency usage and loss of spectrum space\\", Burger continued, addressing the overreach argument, \\"was clearly the kind of judgment entrusted by Congress to the Commission.\\" The court did not find that the requirement for 50% original programming on the FM station seriously limited the station's programming choices, since it could easily tape and rebroadcast content from either station later. Burger also noted that KKHI's economic concerns had indeed been taken into account when the commission granted the extension until April 1967. When considering the procedural issue, Burger allowed himself some criticism of the commission, noting that given its explicit consideration of technical factors and programming as issues on which its decisions turned, it should have explicitly cited those considerations in promulgating the rule rather than refer to the nebulously defined public interest. But \\"[a]lthough it may well be that the rule could have been more precise, it is adequate and the Commission has given it a consistent interpretation.\\" The rule did not explicitly state that a hearing would be granted if desired, and \\"[i]n these circumstances we hold that the Commission acted within its discretion in refusing to grant a hearing\\" as KKHI had not shown that the FCC had not considered its reasons for desiring the exemption. Aftermath Many stations scrambled to find new staff to handle their FM-only broadcasts, and did not care about what they chose to play as long as it was enough to comply with the new rule and other FCC regulations. The newly hired staff were often young, recent college graduates who did not demand high salaries. Since the FM audience was generally older than the Top 40 AM audience, management gave DJs more independence in what they chose to play. On the air they chose to follow the example of freeform radio stations, where the disk jockeys could play whatever they wanted without a playlist defined by management. Some stations, such as San Francisco's KPFA, the first noncommercial FM station in the U.S., and Seattle's KRAB, had been freeform since even before the Non-Duplication Rule was adopted. While the freeform DJs' tastes were often fairly eclectic, including soul music, blues, jazz, and world music, their programming was dominated by contemporary rock. Artists closely associated with the counterculture had developed audiences from their live performances and from released recordings but many did not get played on Top 40 AM stations of the time, thus earning them the term \\"underground\\" music, which was also applied briefly to the FM stations that played it.Resource Interdependence, 173‚Äì74 Many freeform DJs played not just singles by those bands but album tracks, beginning what later became the album-oriented rock format. Adding to the natural advantage of FM's higher sound quality, the new stations also broadcast fewer commercials between songs. In San Francisco, Tom Donahue, a former Top 40 AM DJ who had written an article in the then-new Rolling Stone calling that medium dead, took over as program director at KMPX and expanded its freeform content from one overnight DJ's shift to the entire format. He paid particular attention to those bands coming out of the Haight-Ashbury hippie scene, such as the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, whose San Francisco Sound became the soundtrack for the 1967 Summer of Love. The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, also released that year, proved an ideal album for the new rock FM stations, which also included New York's WNEW and WPLJ, Chicago's WXRT, Detroit's WABX and WHFS in Baltimore. Freeform FM's DJs were, as their program directors had believed, more inclined to engage the audience as equals. Eschewing the frantic patter of their AM counterparts, they talked in conversational tones, avoided playing jingles, drops or talking over the music, and addressed the audience, sometimes even engaging in on-air telephone conversations with them. They grouped work they played by a common theme they would point out to the audience, and sometimes found segues between songs that demonstrated these connections. Their willingness to play longer and less accessible work in turn led bands to record more work in this vein, giving rise to the progressive rock of the early 1970s, which had in turn come from \\"progressive radio\\", another term for the new FM rock stations. The growth in FM programming and listeners also had an economic effect. In 1968 ABC began putting together an FM network. That same year, Philadelphia's WDVR became the first FM station to sell a million dollars in advertising. FM stations as a whole reported positive operating income for the first time. This growth continued into the early 1970s even as many of the freeform stations became more standardized and formatted in response to the increased investment. In 1973 FM once again reported an aggregate net positive operating income, and has continued to do so every year since. By the middle of the decade most new radios included the FM band, and in 1976, the year the FCC extended the rule to limit duplication to only 25% of content in cities of more than 25,000, car radios followed suit. Finally, in 1978, FM stations achieved a greater share of the national listening audience than AM;Sounds of Change, 138 in New York this shocked the city's radio community when all-disco WKTU, the former WHOM-FM whom the FCC had exempted from the rule initially, ended WABC-AM's long reign as the city's top-rated music station. One unexpected consequence of FM's ascendance was a decline in the number of the classical music stations that had been early adopters of the technology. While at first many had pleased their listeners, who expected the rule would create more space for classical on the air, by offering more classical programming on FM, they soon saturated what had always been a small segment of the total radio audience. To become profitable in the new environment, many had to change their formats, to the consternation of aficionados. In New York, this led to a listener backlash that forced WNCN to return to its classical format in 1975 after nearly a year as a rock station, WQIV, so named for its effort to broadcast in quadraphonic sound. Repeal In 1985, after one broadcaster, AGK Communications, proposed to the FCC that the hours between midnight and 6 a.m. be exempted from the rule, the commission responded by proposing to repeal the rule entirely. After taking comments, mostly from the NAB and broadcasters, the FCC repealed the rule in March 1986. The commission concluded the rule had long since accomplished its goal. The amount of FM stations had increased by almost a dozenfold in the two decades since it had gone into effect; FM stations now claimed nearly three- quarters of all radio listeners. \\"FM radio service is now fully competitive\\", the commission had said when proposing the repeal the year before. \\"In fact, we believe that for many AM-FM combinations it is now the case that the viability of the AM station depends on its association with a stronger FM facility.\\" Specifically, the FCC hoped that AM stations would now broadcast around the clock since they could depend on FM again to carry their stronger signal. It did not think many would do so, and while many broadcasters agreed there was no reason to return to full duplication, some said they hoped the repeal could help them strengthen now-struggling AM stations through this expansion of their broadcast hours. Several also believed the decision had always best been left to the market. Two companies that commented to the FCC on the proposed repeal opposed it. Osborn Communications worried that rather than help AM, it would result in the complete collapse of the medium as all listeners would prefer to hear a station's superior sound quality on FM whatever the content. Conversely, Press Broadcasting in turn feared that AM stations that duplicated an FM signal would have a competitive advantage over those that were independent of an FM station. By the time of the repeal, FM music stations had become as formatted and commercially driven as the AM stations had been at the time the rule went into force.Resource Interdependence, 169 Lee Abrams, an influential consultant, had developed the album-oriented rock format (\\"designed to sound unstructured, even if it was not\\", in one historian's words.) which narrowed down the FM rock playlist by focusing on popular albums, in the mid-1970s. By the 1980s this had been further reduced to classic rock, which largely treated the songs that had become audience favorites during the medium's less controlled era as an oldies playlist and largely avoided work by any newer artists.

In the course of this process, Romanians adopted a Latin-based alphabet to replace Cyrillic script and made lexical borrowings, mostly from French but also from Latin and Italian, in order to acquire the lexical tools necessary for modernization. This process created neologisms (for newly introduced objects or concepts), synonyms or made old some Slavic and other loanwords obsolete, strengthening some Romance syntactic features of Romanian. Re- latinization is part of the modernization period of the Romanian language, which led to the unification of the literary language based on the Wallachian idiom and the elaboration of the first academic normative works. Some linguistic research emphasize that the use of this term is inappropriate as it conflates the larger process of modernization of the language with the more extreme, and in the end unsuccessful, current of eliminating non-Latin influences, and, secondly, the term's lack of precision is susceptible to lead to confusion as the Latin character of the Romanian language had already been noticed since at least the 15th century. Background Geographical distribution of the four Eastern Romance languages in the early-20th-century Romanian is a Romance language with about 25 million native speakers. It is the official language of Romania and Moldova and has a co-official status in Vojvodina (in Serbia). Ethnic Romanians also live in Ukraine and Hungary. Significant Romanian diasporas developed in other European countries (especially in Italy and Spain) and in North America, Australia and Israel. Romanian is closely related to three other Balkan Romance languages, Aromanian (or Macedo-Romanian ), Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian, all descending from a common Proto-Romanian language. Romanian is divided into two main dialects, with a northern dialect spoken in Moldavia, northern Transylvania, Maramure»ô and Banat, and a southern dialect in Wallachia, but transitional variants also exist in Oltenia and Transylvania. The origin of the Romanians is still subject to scholarly debates. The core of the debate is the continuous presence of the Romanians in the lands now forming Romania north of the Lower Danube. Scholars who propose that the Roman province of Dacia Trajana (which existed to the north of the river for about 165 years) was an important venue of the Romanians' ethnogenesis accept the continuity north of the Danube, a theory also supported by scholars who consider that the origins of the Romanians included territories located not only in Dacia, but also in areas south of the Danube (which were under Roman rule for centuries). Scholars who refute these theories propose that the ethnogenesis of the Romanians started in the south-Danubian provinces and the Romanians' ancestors did not settle in the lands to the north of the Lower Danube before the 11th century. Romanian developed in territories which were isolated from other Romance languages for more than a thousand years. This geographic isolation gave rise to the development of a number of specific features. For instance, palatalized dental consonants (especially \\"z\\") replaced the non-palatalized consonants in verbs. The number of Romanian words directly inherited from Latin (about 1,550‚Äì2,000, depending on the source) is similar to the other Romance languages, and is low in comparison with Medieval Greek (which contained about 3,000 Latin roots). Romanian along with Spanish and Portuguese retained more archaic lexical items from Latin than other Romance languages, most probably due to their peripheral position. For instance, the classical Latin word for beautiful (formosus) can still be detected in Romanian frumos, Portuguese formoso and Spanish hermoso, but it was replaced by terms deriving from another Latin word, bellus in French (beau) and Italian (bello). Romanian shares linguistic features with the non-Romance languages of the Balkan Peninsula, which gave rise to the idea of a \\"Balkan linguistic union\\". There are some further common features of Albanian and Romanian. Scholars assume that Albanian was closely related to the likely Thracian or Thraco-Dacian substrate languages, whose Romanization gave rise to the development of Romanian, or descends from it. Slavic languages influenced the development of Romanian for centuries. Romanian borrowed hundreds of loanwords from Slavic languages and Slavic influence can be detected in Romanian phonology and morphology. Romanians also adopted Old Church Slavonic as the language of liturgy together with the Cyrillic sript. Flavio Biondo was the first scholar to have observed (in 1435) linguistic affinities between the Romanian and Italian languages, as well as their common Latin origin. When comparing Romanian with other Romance languages, linguists noticed its peculiarities which can be detected at all linguistic levels. In the early 19th century, the Slovene linguist, Jernej Kopitar, suggested that Romanian emerged through the relexification either of an ancient Balkan language or of a Slavic idiom, instead of directly developing from Vulgar Latin. Paul Wexler published a similar hypothesis in 1997. Linguist Anthony P. Grant writes that Wexler's hypothesis is not \\"completely convincing\\", stating that the \\"rise of Romanian still seems to be a case of language shift, analogous to the rise of English in England\\", with the Romanian substratum equivalent to British Celtic, the Balkan Latin stratum similar to Anglo-Saxon, and the South Slavic superstratum equivalent to the Norman French role. Due to the high ratio of Slavic loanwords, some scholars believed Romanian was a Slavic language. Linguist Posner attributed to Friedrich Diez, who was one of the first German scholars systematically studying Romance philology, the opinion of Romanian (\\"Wallachian\\") being a semi-Romance language in the early 19th century. In his Grammar of the Romance Languages (1836) Diez retains six languages of the Romance area which attract attention, in terms of their grammatical or literary significance: Italian and Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese, Proven√ßal and French. All six languages have their first and common source in Latin, a language which is 'still intertwined with our civilization' Harald Haarmann considers that any discussion about the position of Romanian within the Romance philology was definitely decided with the Grammar of Diez. After the publication of his Grammar of the Romance Languages, Romanian is always listed among the Romance languages . Schippel observes that since Friedrich Diez' Grammar, the Romance character of Romanian wasn't seriously doubted Werner Bahner concludes that ‚Äúsince the second half of the 19th century the Romance character of the Romanian has to be regarded as an absolutely certain knowledge‚Äù as ‚Äûfrom the outset Romanian was considered a Romance language‚Äù. As linguist Graham Mallinson emphasizes, \\"Romanian in its various forms retains enough of its Latin heritage at all linguistic levels to qualify for membership of the Romance family in its own right\\". The re-latinisation evolved differently in the Romanian-populated areas. In Wallachia and Moldavia from 1760 to 1820-1830 the lexical influence of French and New Greek was the most influential, while in the Banat and Transylvania the Romanian language adopted words mainly from Latin and German languages. After 1830 the French language became the main source of the borrowings. When derivations of the Latin type-words are taken into account, research shows that ‚Äûthe proportion of the resulting group in the total vocabulary of Romanian remains, with nearly 80% of types-words in the dictionaries, about the same from the texts of 16/17th centuries to present Romanian‚Äù, concluding that ‚Äúthe vocabulary of Old Romanian is as Romanic as the vocabulary of the modern Romanian language‚Äù Terminology Relatinization, as linguist Franz Rainer defines it, covers \\"not only borrowings from Latin at all its stages, including medieval and Neo- Latin, but also latinate formations taken from other European languages\\". This process can be detected during the history of all Romance languages. In Romanian scholarship, Alexandru Graur seems to have used the term relatinizare for the first time in an article in 1930, referring to the French influence on the development of the Romanian language. A year later, Sextil Pu»ôcariu proposed a new term, reromanizare, most probably because he wanted to cover both the direct borrowings from Latin and of the borrowings from Romance languages. In 1978, Alexandru Niculescu opted for the label occidentalizare romanicƒÉ (\\"Romance Westernization\\"), while Vasile D. »ö√¢ra described the process in 1982 as the \\"Latin-Romance direction in the modernization of the Romanian literary language\\". Linguist Maria Aldea emphasizes that the term reromanizare is not adequate to describe the linguistic process which has enriched the Romanian vocabulary with new words of Latin or Romance origin since the early 19th century. Ioana Moldovanu-Cenu»ôƒÉ emphasizes the differences between the \\"Roman Westernization\\", which took place in Moldavia and Wallachia under the influences of the Age of Enlightenment, and the \\"re- latinization\\" carried out by the representatives of the Transylvanian School and of the \\"Latinist current\\". Historian Ioan-Aurel Pop points out that the lack of precision of the terms may lead to confusion, because the Latin character of the Romanian language was already noticed in the 15th century, placing it in the group of Romance languages. Development =Transylvanian School and Latinist current= August Treboniu Laurian, the leader of the Latinist current in the 1870s Educated Romanians started to regard Latin and Italian as linguistic models already in the 17th century. For instance, the Italian loanword popor (from popolo, the Italian word for people) was borrowed in this century and added to the synonymous neam and norod (a Hungarian and a Slavic loanword respectively), both still in use. Scholars of the Transylvanian School were the first to make concerted efforts to eliminate certain non-Romance features of the language in the late 18th century. They were Greek Catholic (or Uniate) intellectuals tutored in Vienna and Rome who were determined to manifest the Latin origin of Romanian. They regarded the Romanians as \\"an island of Latinity in a Slav sea\\". Their activities contributed to the re-orientation of the Romanians' intellectual life towards Western Europe. These scholars promoted the use of Latin letters in place of Cyrillic script, but the writing system that they developed never won popularity. Their spelling system was primarily designed to demonstrate the Latin roots of the Romanian words, ignoring their contemporary pronunciation. For instance, they proposed that the Romanian words for fountain and land (modern Romanian f√¢nt√¢nƒÉ and »õarƒÉ) should be rendered by fontana and tiera. They decided to replace Slavic loanwords with terms of Latin origin, even trying to get rid of the Romanian word for and (»ôi), wrongly attributing a Slavic origin to it. They created portmanteau words, containing both Slavic and Latin roots, like rƒÉzbel from the Slavic loanword rƒÉzboi and the Latin term bellum (both meaning war). Scholars of this \\"Latinist school\\" (or \\"Latinist current\\") often spread extremist views in their works. In 1853, their leader, August Treboniu Laurian, started his History of the Romanians with the legendary founding of Rome in 753 BC. Laurian and Ioan Massim published the two volumes of their Dictionary of the Romanian Language and a glossary to it in the 1870s. They adopted a writing system which demonstrated the etymology of the words and purged the language of most non-Latin terms. The language that they promoted was artificial, bearing \\"only a vague resemblance to authentic Romanian\\". The Academic Society (the future Romanian Academy) had initially commissioned the publication of their dictionary, but their exaggerated attempts to purify the language \\"provoked laughter and permanently discredited the Latinist school\\", thus their work was the last publication of the Latinist current. =Wallachia and Moldavia= Wallachian and Moldavian writers who took a more conventional approach than the Transylvanian scholars were more successful. Re-latinisation reached its peak in Wallachia in the early 19th century, when Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu introduced large numbers of Italian neologisms. Subsequently, literary figures at Ia»ôi, in Moldavia, began borrowing from French, at the time the language of high European culture. In addition to direct borrowings from Romance languages, loan translations also appeared, although some of them could not survive. These were neologisms build as internal lexical formations, created by derivation of the Latin-inherited \\"root words\\" from the Romanian groundstock. For instance, the loan translations bƒÉrbƒÉtesc and femeiesc (from the Romanian words for man and woman respectively) soon vanished to give place to the loanwords masculin and feminin as labels for two grammatical genders. On the other hand, the loanwords futur (\\"future\\") and pasat (\\"past\\") could not take roots against the newly created synonyms viitor and trecut. Romance doubletsthe coexistence of inherited Latin terms and Romance loanwords descending from the same Latin rootbecame characteristic elements of Romanian vocabulary during this period. For example, the inherited words for tomb (morm√¢nt) and feeling (sim»õƒÉm√¢nt) co-exist with the Romance loanwords monument (\\"monument\\") and sentiment (\\"sentiment\\"). The spread of prefixes borrowed from other Romance languages and Latin also began in the 19th century. Certain prefixes were first directly inherited from Latin, but later their Latin root was also borrowed, thus \\"etymological doublets\\" appeared in Romanian. For instance, the prefix cu- descends from Latin con-, and the prefix strƒÉ- from extra-, but the original Latin prefixes are now widely used. Cyrillic script could only inadequately reflect Romanian phonemes. After the adoption of Romance loanwords, the use of the Cyrillic writing system became even more problematic, but a Roman script was introduced only gradually between 1830 and 1860. Initially a transitional writing system was introduced which retained certain Cyrillic letters for specific Romanian sounds. For instance, the Romanian mid central vowel (…ô) was represented by the Cyrillic letter \\"–™\\", and the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative ( É) by the letter \\"—à\\". A pure Roman writing system was introduced by law in the united Danubian Principalities in 1860. =Recent trends= Linguist Kim Schulte emphasizes that \\"the large number of words borrowed from other Romance languages over the last two centuries\\" gives Romanian vocabulary \\"a distinctly Romance appearance\\". Mallinson likewise concludes that due to the re-latinization process modern Romanian \\"has attained, if not necessarily retained, a high level of Romance vocabulary, though raw lexical statistics fail to give an adequate picture of precisely how much a Romance language it really is\\". He argues that some syntatic features also demonstrate how Romanian is \\"gradually returning to the Romance fold\\". The revival of the true infinitive and the gradual disappearance of use of reflexive verbs in impersonal passive situations are attributed by scholars to the influence of Western Romance languages. Romanian has a tendency to replace the -uri ending of plural of neuter (or rather ambigeneric) nouns with -e especially in written language. Words ending with -e most probably enjoy a higher status, because many of them were borrowed from Romance languages, according to Mallinson. Linguist Mioara Avram highlights the recent influence of English which, although a Germanic language, has an important Romance component of French origin, as well as numerous Latin etymological lexemes, and argues that contemporary English loans continue indirectly the old re-latinization or re-romanization process of the Romanian language.

Grant, the famous Union general in the American Civil War and the 18th president of the United States. She married Jesse Root Grant in Point Pleasant, Ohio, and was the mother of six children. Little is known about her private life, other than what can be discerned from general and public information. She rarely discussed her son with anyone while he was a general and a president, especially not the press. She was a devoutly religious woman, always reserved and unpretentious in her manner, and she is often considered by historians and others to have had a strong influence on her son Ulysses who shared similar qualities in character. Ancestry and early life Simpson's childhood home Hannah Simpson was born on her parents' farm on November 23, 1798, in Horsham, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,Vault, 1885, p. 135 where she grew up. From a family of four siblings, she was the second daughter and third child of John Simpson, Jr. and Rebecca SimpsonEdmonds, 1915, p. 17 who came from the Simpson family of Scottish Protestants. Her grandfather came to Philadelphia in 1762 and established a farm not far from the city. He fought with George Washington during the American Revolutionary War. He had a son, Hannah's father, who sold the farm in 1817 and moved to Ohio and bought a farm near the Ohio River, not far from Point Pleasant. Hannah was described by friends as slender, above average height, handsome, but not beautiful, with a serious, reserved and steadfast personality.Simpson, 2001, p.23Coyle, 2014, p. (highlighted) Mother of a general and president Hannah and Jesse Grant's home in Point Pleasant when Ulysses was born Hannah with husband Jesse Hannah married Jesse Root Grant on June 25, 1821, and settled into a modest, though attractive, house near the Ohio River in Point Pleasant, Ohio. They were much admired by the townspeople there.Thayer, 1885, p. 24 Together they had six children ‚Äì three boys and three girls.Bunting, 2004, p. 10 She gave birth to the first of her children, Ulysses, on April 27, 1822, about ten months after she was married. As firstborn children were traditionally received with wide family fanfare, deciding a name for her firstborn child became an involved family advent for Hannah. Her husband, Jesse, and other family members all had enthusiastic ideas for a suitable name, and subsequently weeks elapsed before a name was chosen.Simpson, 2014, pp. 2‚Äì3White, 2016, pp. 9‚Äì10} It was finally decided that a name would be chosen by means of a ballot, i.e.by placing names in a hat, a method that Hannah was not very comfortable with. Realizing, however, that her son would likely return home with out a name otherwise, Hannah acquiesced to the procedure.Thayer, 1885, p. 27 Hannah, being a loyal Democrat, suggested the name of Albert, after Albert Gallatin from her home state of Pennsylvania. Hannah's mother opted for Ulysses, after an ancient Greek hero, which Jesse seconded. Grant's step-grandmother Sarah Simpson, an educated woman who read French classical literature, also favored the name Ulysses.White, 2016, pp. 9‚Äì10} Finally, at a family gathering, the name Ulysses, was drawn from ballots placed in a hat. Jesse, wanting to honor his wife's father, declared the name for his son would thus be Hiram Ulysses, though he would always refer to him as Ulysses.Simpson, 2014, pp. 2‚Äì3 When Ulysses was eighteen months old, the family moved to Georgetown, Ohio.McFeely, 1981, pp. 5‚Äì6White, 2016, p. 9 Here Hannah gave birth to five more siblings: Simpson, Clara, Orvil, Virginia (known as Jennie), and Mary.Longacre, 2006, pp.6‚Äì7 In character, Ulysses was said to have resembled his mother more so than his father, deriving his good nature and calm disposition from her. However, Hannah, though always supportive, was not known as someone for a young boy to turn to for compassionate counsel in times of trouble, usually keeping her affections withdrawn.Waugh, 2009, pp. 13‚Äì14 Hannah and her husband helped to found the Georgetown Methodist Church, which began holding services in 1827.White, 2016, p. 19 Hannah earnestly had her family attend this church every Sunday.Waugh, 2009, p. 14 She was never known to argue or boast, and never gossiped about her neighbors or others. Her husband Jesse once bore testimony to her noble-like character, and said of her, \\"Her steadiness, strength of character have been the stay of the family through life\\".Vault, 1885, p. 129 During the Civil War her son Ulysses was sometimes criticized for his costly war-time tactics. While her husband Jesse often responded angrily with newspaper editorials, a devoutly religious Hannah remained calm and was confident with the idea that her son was protected by God in the business of saving the Union from what she regarded as a \\"terrible war\\".White, 2016, p. 225 When Ulysses was elected president in 1868, Hannah, not liking publicity and praise, was not present when Ulysses was sworn in as the 18th President of United States, and never visited the White House during his two terms as president. As she came from a family of Jacksonian Democrats, there was much political speculation about her noted absence.Chernow, 2017, pp. 630‚Äì631 There is only one known interview of her. During the presidency of her son Ulysses, she lived a detached life from him, though she was not estranged from him, as many had assumed.Chernow, 2017, p.919 Hannah's husband, Jesse, died on June 29, 1873, four years after their son Ulysses was sworn in as president in 1869. Often met with inquiries about her famous son, Hannah remained virtually silent about anything to do with Ulysses or the family for the duration of her life.Mcfeely, 1981, p. 388 Final days Hannah Simpson Grant When Hannah's husband, Jesse, died in 1873, she moved in with her daughter, Virginia, wife of Abel Corbin.McFeely, 1981, p.453 There is only one known news interview of Hannah which occurred in Jersey City sometime after President Grant's term in office. In response to an inquiry about when she expected to see her son, Ulysses, again, she replied, \\"Indeed, the newspapers seem to know more about it than we do; at least, so Mrs. Corbin says. For myself, I never read any paper but the Christian Advocate, published in Cincinnati.\\"The Ulysses S. Grant Homepage, 2016, Essay Some ten years later Hannah died on May 11, 1883, at the age of 84, at 12:30 in the afternoon, at her home at 582 Pavonia Ave in Jersey City. Up until that time she was considered in good health and her death came unexpectedly. On the morning of her death she was going about her usual business around the house, had read the newspaper and had conversations with her daughter, Mrs. Virginia Grant Corbin, the only other person in the house. At about noon, Hannah began to feel weak and faint and retired to her bed for rest. She continued to grow weak at an alarming rate, where her daughter, not knowing the seriousness of Hannah's condition, went for help a block away, and then sent a telegram notifying her sister, in Philadelphia. When she returned to the house, Hannah was incoherent and within minutes had stopped breathing. News of her death was telegraphed to General Grant, who made the necessary arrangements for her funeral. The funeral was held in Hannah's home with the Reverend Richard from the Simpson Methodist Church conducting the service.Chernow, 2017, p.919Obituary, May 11, 1883 At Hannah's funeral, not wanting to overshadow her memory with his fame, Ulysses advised the pastor that he should \\"speak of her only as a pure-minded simple-hearted, earnest, Methodist Christian ...\\", asking him to speak of her only, and to make no reference to himself, asserting his request by maintaining that Hannah had gained nothing by any position he had ever held.

In 2002 he was convicted of attempted murder after he stabbed his wife in a pizza parlor. While in jail he was awarded $311,000 in a civil suit related to his campaign for county commissioner. Political career In 1996, Kasparian ran for a seat on the Hampden County Commission. On September 11, 1996 one of the incumbents, Thomas J. O'Connor, died, which left Kasparian and the other incumbent, Richard S. Thomas, unopposed. In 1997 Kasparian and the commission pitched a proposal to the New England Patriots for a new stadium on a site in Agawam, Massachusetts. This was one of many proposals submitted after plans for a South Boston stadium fell through. On July 1, 1998 the Hampden County Government was dismantled and the commission was eliminated. Kasparian filed suit challenging the Massachusetts General Court's authority to dismantle counties, but the suit was dismissed. In 1998, Kasparian ran as an independent for the 8th District seat on the Massachusetts Governor's Council. He received 8% of the vote. In 1999 he finished fourth in the Agawam mayoral race with 1% of the vote. In 2000 he ran as independent for the Hampden district seat in the Massachusetts Senate. He lost to incumbent Linda Melconian 86% to 14%. Kasparian later moved to Yarmouth, Massachusetts and served on the town's finance committee. Legal problems During the 1996 county commissioner's race, Kasparian's criminal record was leaked to one of his opponents, Richard S. Thomas, who then turned it over to the Union-News. The record showed that since 1972, Kasparian had been charged 19 times, including charges related to an attack with a knife on a business partner that he had been acquitted of. Most of the charges had been dismissed, but he did receive a six-month suspended sentence in 1972 for fraudulently accepting $900 in welfare payments. Kasparian sued Thomas and two court officers for violating Massachusetts' state's Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) laws by leaking his criminal record. The case finally went to trial in 2014 and Kasparian was awarded $311,000. In 2000, Kasparian was jailed after judge William Abraskin found him in contempt of court. Kasparian had been ordered to make repairs an apartment building in Springfield, Massachusetts he owned as a result of a two-year court case. After Kasparian had failed to begin work despite racking up $2,100 in $100-a-day fines, Abraskin jailed him in order to get him to comply. On July 22, 2002, Kasparian met with his wife at an Agawam pizza parlor. During the meeting, Kasparian allegedly begged his wife not to divorce him before attacking her with a butcher knife he brought to the restaurant. On August 2 he was charged with attempted murder, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and domestic assault. He was found guilty and received a 12 to 15 year sentence. He was released from prison on January 6, 2016.

Prior to its reading in the State Senate, eleven Republican senators announced their intention to protest and walkout, preventing a quorum from being reached; in response, Governor Kate Brown dispatched state troopers to search for the senators. Proposal The cap and trade program was proposed by environmentalist lobbying coalition Renew Oregon and other environmental organizations, using the existing program in California as an example. If passed, the program would come into effect in 2021 with the goal of reducing emissions to 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035 and 80 percent below by the year 2050. The initial cap will be set at 25,000 metric tons of annual carbon emissions and is projected to raise $550 million in its first year. The program would reinvest revenues into environmentally friendly projects, including energy efficiency projects for utilities, a fund to transition jobs that would be affected by climate change, and low-carbon transportation projects, including support for mass transit and cycling. History and political debate House Bill 2020 was introduced on February 4, 2019, returning a previous cap and trade amendment that was deferred from the Clean Energy Jobs Bill in 2018. The Democrats had won a supermajority in both chambers of the Oregon state legislature in the 2018 elections, presenting a new opportunity to consider the plan alongside other environmental actions. The initial proposal was revised and rewritten several times, including a major amendment in late March, before passing the House on June 18. =Senate walkout= On June 20, 2019, eleven Republican senators announced their intention to leave the state in protest of House Bill 2020, preventing a quorum to vote on the senate floor. The following day, Governor Kate Brown dispatched state troopers to search for the absent senators and return them to the state capitol for the vote. The Oregon State Capitol was shut down on June 21 following an unsubstantiated threat from a right-wing militia group that was received by state police. On June 26, Reddit quarantined the subreddit /r/The_Donald, due to posts which advocated violence related to this walkout.

He is currently under contract will Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide. He is primarily known for his work for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, International Wrestling Revolution Group, Lucha Libre Elite, The Crash Lucha Libre, Impact Wrestling, Major League Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla as well as on the Mexican and independent circuit. His real name is not a matter of public record as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico. Professional wrestling career =Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (2012‚Äì2016)= In mid-2012 AAA introduced a new masked trio known as Los Inferno Rockers (Machine Rocker, Devil Rocker and Soul Rocker), a trio of masked, glam-rocker inspired wrestlers who resembled the rock band Kiss. It was later verified that the former Tito Santana was under the Soul Rocker mask. The trio was set up as the rivals of Los Psycho Circus (Psycho Clown, Murder Clown and Monster Clown), who at the time had been undefeated for years. They later introduced the tall Uro Rocker to the team, targeting Psycho Clown specifically. It was later revealed that Uro Rocker was supposed to be the main rival of Psycho Clown, but the wrestler playing the part hurt wrestlers he worked with and was quickly dropped from the group. The group lost to Los Psycho Circus at the 2012 Guerra de Titanes show, their first appearance at a major AAA show. 18 days later the trio wrestled International Wrestling Revolution Group's Los Oficiales (Oficial 911, Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro) in one of the featured matches on the Arena Naucalpan 35th Anniversary Show when the match ended in a double pinfall. In early 2013 Los Inferno Rockers finally defeated Los Psycho Circus, gaining some momentum in their ongoing feud. They repeated the feat at the 2012 Rey de Reyes show, seemingly escalating their feud towards a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the teams would put their masks on the line. The Apuestas match never happened and Los Inferno Rockers were soon diverted from Los Psycho Circus. In later 2013 Devil Rocker left AAA and was replaced by Demon Rocker to remain a trio. a member of the Los Inferno Rockers stable. The team was phased out throughout 2014, with Demon Rocker taking over the \\"La Parka Negra\\" character. By early 2015 Machine Rocker no longer appeared on AAA shows either.

Since October 2015 he has been Rector of the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences.  Life  Blechinger studied art history, ethnology, aesthetics and design theory in Munich and Wuppertal. He completed his master's degree at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich in 1989 with a thesis on the relationship between architecture and philosophy. In 1996 he received his doctorate at the University of Wuppertal near Bazon Brock with a thesis on the French philosopher Jacques Derrida. His work was published by Passages publisher Wien in 1997 under the title \\"Apophatik und Politik\\". At the beginning of the 1990s, Gerhard Blechinger recognized the increasing influence that rapidly developing electronic media would have on many areas of life. In addition to his work on his doctorate, he also ran an agency at the time that dealt with first-generation media products. In 1997, Heinrich Klotz, founder of the Centre for Art and Media Technology (ZKM), brought him to Karlsruhe as a representative for Expo 2000. In 1998 he became deputy director of the new media museum under Hans-Peter Schwarz and at the same time head of Medialab. Blechinger concentrated on expanding media production and research. The first prototypes for Web 3.0 applications were created in Blechingers Medialab at the end of the nineties. Following Hans-Peter Schwarz's appointment as Rector of the Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung und Kunst Z√ºrich (HGKZ), Blechinger followed him in 2000 as Vice Rector for Research, Development, Services and Technology Transfer. His task was to orient research in the field of design to the new technological possibilities and to advance the digitisation of the university. At the same time, Blechinger was also head of the IT department at the university and increased the technology budget by a factor of 100 during his seven years of activity. At times, the Zurich University of Art and Design raised up to 80% of Swiss research funds for universities of applied sciences. In 2004, Blechinger founded the \\"TRACE\\" research group together with the philosopher Heiner M√ºhlmann and Thomas Grunwald (linguist, neuroscientist and medical director of the Swiss Epilepsy Centre). The acronym \\"TRACE\\" means \\"Transmission in Rhetorics, Arts and Cultural Evolution\\" In close cooperation with the founding president Yun Jeduk (‚Ä† 2012) and in cooperation with several colleges and universities in Germany (TU M√ºnchen, RWTH Aachen, Filmhochschule Babelsberg), Blechinger was involved in the founding of the \\"Korean German Institute of Technology\\" from 2003 in a leading position. Horst Teltschik was the founding director of the institute. Blechinger received a professorship for media at KGIT 2007. In 2007, Blechinger founded the Institute for Design and Technology at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) and cooperated with technology and media partners such as Vodafone Pilot Development, Swisscom, Lucent, Alcatel, Pro7 and Ars Electronica. After leaving Switzerland in 2010, Blechinger and Thomas Langhanki founded the company \\"Experimental Game\\" in Berlin, where he was a member of the management during the founding phase. At the same time, he was a lecturer in media theory at the Macromedia University in Munich. In 2011, Blechinger became head of the Multimedia Art course at Salzburg University of Applied Sciences, specialising in Film, Animation, Media Design, Audio and Management and Producing. The \\"CHE Ranking\\", renowned in German-speaking countries, named Multimedia-Art the best course of studies in Austria in 2014. Also in 2014, the Salzburg Urstein Institute (SUI), which serves as the sponsoring company of the Berlin School of Sustainable Futures, University of Applied Sciences gGmbH, was founded by the Salzburg Urstein Institute (SUI). The state recognition as a private university pursuant to Section 123 of the Act on Higher Education in the State of Berlin (BerlHG) took place on 1 June 2018. The BSSF offers four Master's programmes that close an existing gap in the higher education landscape because they place sustainability, media, culture and society in the context of globalisation developments and digitisation.

Takagi. The film details the experiences of South Korean women who work in U.S. military camptown brothels, bars, or clubs, exposing how the South Korean government and U.S. military mutually benefit from the sexual exploitation of women.  Synopsis  The film documents the lives of Korean women working around military bases in both South Korea and the U.S. through one-on-one interviews, as well as through commentary from U.S. soldiers, U.S. and Korean academics, and individuals attempting to counteract the violent sexual exploitation specified by the film. While the Korean War ended in 1953, as of 1995, 37,000 U.S. military personnel were stationed in this region, where more than 27,000 women perform sexual labor in or around military camptowns. As one woman, Yang Hyang Kim, relays in the film, many poor women in South Korea sought work to help support their families and were sold into or tricked into working in the military sex industry ‚Äî trapped by debt, threat, or use of physical force. Poor economic circumstance is the primary reason Korean women work around U.S. bases. Professor Elaine Kim of the University of California, Berkeley explains in the film that there is very little room for social mobility in South Korea as well, especially for young women. Even when South Korean women are able to escape these conditions, Korean social norms cause many to face rejection from their families, feel shame, and potentially drive them to return to military camptown life. The South Korean government also exercises a considerable degree of control over which populations can access the bars and clubs around U.S. bases. The majority of Korean people cannot enter these spaces ‚Äî they are designated for non-citizens of Korea and the Korean women who \\"service\\" them. Women working in these conditions face further stigmatization due to the fact that only they, not the soldiers, are subject to testing for sexually transmitted diseases or infections. The film also portrays the abuse and neglect experienced by Korean women who date or marry U.S. soldiers. For women with interracial children resulting from sexual relations with U.S. soldiers, the social sphere is even more hostile. The Duraebang Community Center is one facility featured in the film which was opened to support camptown sex workers, including those who marry U.S. soldiers they meet while working in the camptowns. Alternatively, the USO Bride School is featured in the documentary as a facility that teaches Korean wives ‚Äî or soon to be wives ‚Äî of U.S. soldiers about American culture. The survivalist approaches and perseverance of South Korean women working in the military sex industry is also emphasized in the documentary. It covers protests and demonstrations organized by groups like the Duraebang Community Center, particularly highlighting the violent murder of Yoom Kum-Yi by U.S. soldier Kenneth Markle at Camp Casey, South Korea in Dongducheon. A similar justice campaign highlighted covers the wrongful sentencing of Chong Sun France, a Korean woman living in the U.S. whose youngest child died while unattended when she had to leave her two children to go to work in a Jacksonville bar. Compiling these battles for justice with personal testimonies from women who work or have worked around U.S. military bases, the film confronts South Korean and U.S. military policy and the intricate role both play in the forced exploitation of Korean women's sexual labor.  Production  The film was produced by Third World Newsreel.

Her first language (or dialect) is Swiss German. She has emigrated to the United States of America twice, in 1998 and again in 2015, but German remains the language in which she writes, and in which by 2018 more than twenty of her novels had been published. Biography Milena P√∂rtner was born on July 13, 1963 in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. Her father was the writer-playwright and dramaturge Paul P√∂rtner (1925-1984). Marlis P√∂rtner, her mother, is a psychologist who in her later years has also come to prominence as a successful author. And Milena Moser's brother, Stephan P√∂rtner, is an author too. She says she knew when she was 8 that she wanted to become a writer. She attended a middle school with a non-technical focus (Diplommittelschule) and went on to complete an apprenticeship for the book trade. After that she took a writing job with the Swiss broadcasting organisation before heading for Paris where she lived for two years. By now aged 21, it was while living in Paris that she wrote her first (35 years later still unpublished) novels. In the words of one source this was the start of a period during which she \\"collected rejection letters for six years\\". (More recently she has been identified as one of Switzerland's most successful writers\\".) By 1987 she was back in Z√ºrich. With her first husband, the book trader Ren√© Moser, she set up a low volume magazine \\"Sans Blague, Magazin f√ºr Schund und S√ºnde\\" (\\"... Magazine for Trash and Sins\\"). With a print run of 500 per edition, this became the vehicle for the publication of her first stories. She and / or her friends also created the \\"Kr√∂sus Verlag\\" (publishing business) so that she would be able to publish her books. In 1990 \\"Kr√∂sus Verlag\\" produced the first of her published novels, \\"Gebrochene Herzen\\" (\\"Broken Hearts\\"). Since that point Milena Moser has been able to support herself from her writing. With her next novel the memorably titled, \\"Die Putzfraueninsel\\" / \\"L'√Æle des femmes de m√©nage\\", she found a wider market, with 250,000 copies sold of the German edition alone. This became the first of her novels to appear in a French translation. In 1996 the German (formerly East German) film-maker Peter Timm produced a film version. In 1998, accompanied by her two sons and her second husband, the photographer Thomas Kern, she relocated to San Francisco. The decision to move was a spontaneous one, reached the previous year during a holiday in the States. During the eight years she spent in California she wrote three songs for the singer Michael von der Heide. \\"Bad Hair Days\\", \\"The postman died\\" and \\"Capuccino\\" later found their way onto von der Heide's album \\"Tourist\\", which appeared in 2000 and reached position 5 in the Swiss hit parade. (That makes it Michael von der Heide's most popular album to date.) Milena Moser returned to Switzerland in 2006. She now teamed up the (formerly East German) playwright-author Sibylle Berg and with her agent Anne Wieser to set up a \\"writing school\\". In a \\"writing workshop\\" in Aarau she started providing writing courses for the untutored, also offering her services as a \\"writing coach\\" in classes producing jointly authored pieces of work. While Moser concentrated on face-to-face teaching, her business partner Sibylle Berg placed her own focus on on-line tuition courses, available to German-language students unwilling or unable to make their way to Aarau. By March 2010 it was reported that 300 students had opted for these \\"virtual courses\\". In 2015, by now divorced from her second husband, she returned again to the United States and bought a house in Santa Fe, New Mexico where she settled down to live alone, devoting her time exclusively to her writing.

Since the 1910s appreciated by the Burgos Jaimistase.g. in 1916 the Burgos branch of Juventud Jaimista of Burgos acclaimed G√≥mez for ‚Äúoraci√≥n que como suya, super√≥ √° toda pondraci√≥n, tanto en doctrina como en elocuencia galana y convicci√≥n profunda‚Äù, Tierra Hidalga 01.06.16, available here and in 1931 once speaking in the Cortes on behalf of ‚Äúminor√≠a cat√≥lica navarra‚Äù,El Orz√°n 05.09.31, available here he was much closer to the Integrist breed of Traditionalism.Maldonado Jim√©nez 2015, p. 53 However, since 1932 he started to appear on Carlist ralliesLa Independencia 20.12.32, available here and in June accepted Don Alfonso Carlos‚Äô nomination to Consejo de Cultura, a Carlist board of pundits entrusted with guarding the Traditionalist doctrinal orthodoxy.Ferrer 1979, pp. 97-98 Still member of the Agrarian minority in the Cortes,two scholarly works on Partido Agrario clearly count G√≥mez among members of the Agrarian parliamentary minority (though not among members of the party itself), compare Gil Cuadrado 2006, pp. 117, 120, Maldonado Jim√©nez 2015, p. 175 and passim.

Sutton played first-class cricket for the South American cricket team in 1932, before serving in the Second World War with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. Toward the end of the war he fell seriously ill, dying just over a month before its conclusion. Life and military career Sutton was born at North Bierley in Yorkshire to Charles Evans Sutton and his wife, Annie Gertrude Sutton. He was educated at The Leys School. After completing his education, he moved to Valpara√≠so in Chile to help in his fathers company which was based in the city. Having played cricket for club teams in Chile, Sutton was selected to tour England with the South American cricket team in 1932, making a single first-class appearance on the tour against Sir J. Cahn's XI at West Bridgford. Batting once in the match, Sutton was dismissed for 10 runs in the South Americans first-innings by Denys Morkel. With his right-arm slow bowling, he bowled a total of five wicketless overs across the match. He played two minor matches for Chile against Argentina in 1938. Sutton later returned to England where he served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in the Second World War. He served as a seaman aboard the requisitioned trawler , which was sunk west of Ireland in March 1941. For his service aboard the ship, he was mentioned in dispatches in July 1941. He was promoted to the temporary rank of sub- lieutenant in June 1944. He fell seriously ill in 1945, dying at the Royal Hospital Haslar in Gosport in July 1945. He was buried there at the Royal Naval Cemetery.

He was one of the founders of the cities of Netanya and Ashdod and was a longtime mayor of Netanya. He was also among the key founders of the Israeli diamond industry and the Maariv newspaper. Early life Oved Ben-Ami, originally Oved Dankner, was born in Petah Tikva, in what was then Ottoman-ruled Palestine, in 1905 to Meir and Shoshana Dankner. He had eight siblings. His father was a farmer and artisan originally from Romania who was among the first inhabitants of Petah Tikva. His mother was an activist in the Bilu movement. Ben-Ami grew up in Petah Tikva where he received a religious education in a Talmud Torah in addition to a secular education. He was active in various Zionist youth organizations. Career In 1920, Ben-Ami became a correspondent for the Doar HaYom and Palestine Weekly newspapers at age 15. Two years later, he entered the board of Doar HaYom and at that time changed his name from Dankner to Ben- Ami. He covered the 1921 Jaffa riots, sending daily reports to Jerusalem on the rioting in Jaffa and Petah Tikva.◊¢◊ï◊ë◊ì ◊ë◊ü ◊¢◊û◊ô ◊ñ\\"◊ú, Netanya-Moreshet.org.il (Archived) He later switched from being a correspondent to writing analytical material on the development of Jewish settlements in Palestine. In 1922, he was the editor of two more periodicals. Ben-Ami was a member of the Bnei Binyamin Association, an organization active in Jewish settlement in Palestine. He became its regional secretary in Petah Tikva in 1922, and served as general secretary from 1924 to 1928, during which time it was active in the building of Kfar Aharon (now part of Ness Ziona) and Herzliya. Together with Itamar Ben-Avi, Ben-Ami traveled abroad to collect donations to fund Jewish settlement.https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1984/eirv11n04-19840131/eirv11n04-19840131_025-oved_ben_ami.pdf Together with Ben-Avi he traveled to the United States in 1928 to raise funds for the project of building Netanya and purchased the land on which the city was founded by Bnei Binyamin. Settlement of Netanya began in 1929. Ben-Ami headed the Netanya settlement council from 1929 to 1940, and officially became mayor after Netanya was granted local council status by the British Mandate authorities in 1940.https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias- almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/ben-ami-dankner- ovedhttps://www.netanya.muni.il/Eng/?CategoryID=1617 He served as mayor from 1940 to 1974, though not continuously. In 1929, Ben-Ami was elected chairman of the central committee of Bnei Binyamin. He was a member of the Palestinian delegations to the Sixteenth and Seventeenth World Zionist Congresses. He participated in the creation of the Jewish Agency and became a member of the Executive Committee of the World Zionist Organization. He was also one of the founders of the Hanotea company, which was established to raise money and acquire land for Jewish settlement. He also participated in the founding of the town of Even Yehuda in 1932. In 1937, he was a member of the delegation of Palestinian farmers to the Twentieth World Zionist Congress. Ben-Ami was one of the early founders of the Israeli diamond industry. In 1938, he invited the first two local diamond manufacturers, Asher Daskall and Zvi Rosenberg, who ran a diamond polishing business from Rosenberg's home in Petah Tikva, to open a polishing facility in Netanya, and after the proper funds were raised, the Ophir diamond polishing plant opened in 1939. It was the first diamond polishing factory in Palestine. During World War II, Ben-Ami traveled to London and persuaded De Beers to ship rough diamonds to Palestine.https://en.israelidiamond.co.il/wikidiamond/diamond-industry- figures/oved-ben-ami/https://en.israelidiamond.co.il/history-diamond- industry-30s/ He founded the Israel Diamond Manufacturers Association in 1940.https://en.israelidiamond.co.il/wikidiamond/diamond-industry- organizations/israel-diamond-manufacturers/ In August 1947, Ben-Ami was arrested by the British along with the mayors of Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan and a number of Revisionist Zionist leaders in the aftermath of the Sergeants affair, which had taken place in Netanya. He was held in Latrun detention camp and released in October.https://www.jta.org/1947/10/12/archive/palestine- jewish-leaders-meet-to-discuss-implementation-of-mobilization-plans After a group of journalists left Yedioth Ahronoth to found the Maariv newspaper in February 1948, Ben-Ami provided financial backing for the new newspaper.https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/maariv He became a major shareholder in Maariv, and headed its board. In 1956, the Israeli government approved the establishment of the city of Ashdod. Together with Philip Klutznick, Ben-Ami founded a company to carry out the city's construction. Ben-Ami influenced the city's design. Personal life Ben-Ami was married to Yaffa and had three daughters, Hannah, Nitza, and Liora. His daughter Liora was married to Eli Landau, who served as mayor of Herzliya. He died in 1988 at the age of 83. Streets in Netanya and Ashdod are named for him.

It served in Lincolnshire and Scotland on coastal defence and anti-smuggling duties until 1800. A second regiment, the Berkshire Provisional Cavalry was converted into fencible cavalry in 1799. Both regiments were disbanded in 1800, when a number of members transferred to a new Yeomanry Cavalry Troop at Wargrave. Windsor Foresters Fencible regiments were full-time troops, raised to serve in any part of Great Britain and Ireland for the duration of a war, releasing Regular Army units for overseas service. A large number were raised in 1794 during the French Revolutionary War.Fortescue, Vol IV, Pt II, pp. 889‚Äì90. The Windsor Foresters or Berkshire Fencible Cavalry were raised in Berkshire by Charles Rooke, who was appointed colonel on 1 May 1794, with Sir Nathaniel Dukinfield, Bt, as lieutenant-colonel. The regiment consisted of six Troops. Among the captains was Moses Ximenes of Bear Place, at Hare Hatch near Wargrave, whose younger brother David Ximenes, a half-pay captain in the Regular Army, was commissioned into the Foresters as a lieutenant in January 1795.Cormack.War Office, List of the officers.Ron McGuigan, Fencible Cavalry Regiments (of Light Dragoons) 1794‚Äì1799 at Napoleon Series. =Service= In May 1795 the regiment was stationed in Lincolnshire with regimental headquarters (HQ) at Lincoln and detachments at Gainsborough and Newark-on-Trent. By October that year it had moved to Piers Hill Barracks, near Edinburgh in Scotland. In the summer of 1796 the regiment camped at Musselburgh, about five miles from the barracks. An eye-witness recorded that the Windsor Foresters rode bay horses and that the regiment 'appeared to us as the perfection of light dragoons'. For the winter of 1796/7 the regiment moved to barracks at Perth, and by autumn 1797 HQ was established at Aberdeen, with Troops detached to Arbroath and Montrose. The regiment concentrated for camp near Aberdeen in the summer of 1798 before breaking up in October and the Troops returning to their former stations. The regiment did not camp in the summer of 1799, but in October it moved south to Duns in Berwickshire, with one Troop detached at Dunbar. During the winter of 1799/1800 the men were scattered between Duns, Dunbar and Haddington. As well as anti-invasion duties on the coast, much of the unit's service was spent on anti-smuggling duties in support of HM Customs. Service in the fencibles (who did not serve overseas) was popular, and the regiment succeeded in recruiting above its establishment strength. Although most of the original recruits probably came from Berkshire and the Home counties, Trooper Allen Mansfield (later a leading political activist) was enlisted at Cirencester.Nick Mansfield, 'Allen Davenport of the Windsor Foresters: Fencible Cavalry Trooper and Political Activist', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 98, No 392 (Spring 2020), pp. 33‚Äì40. In August 1798 the recruiting parties were working in Birmingham in Warwickshire, Rugeley in Staffordshire and Glasgow in Scotland. In mid-1798 the existing fencible cavalry regiments were numbered, the Berkshire becoming the 5th Regiment of Fencible Cavalry. Later the Berkshire Provisional Cavalry (see below) took over the title of Berkshire Fencible Cavalry. In March 1800 the fencible cavalry were disbanded. The 5th Regiment sold off its horses and the men were progressively discharged, some of them re-enlisting with Regular units, especially the 12th Light Dragoons at Maidstone. By May, Regimental HQ and the cadres of the Troops were at Berwick-upon-Tweed, moving via Leeds to Warwick, where the regiment completed its disbandment on 4 June.Fortescue, Vol V, p. 169. Berkshire Provisional Cavalry In November 1796 legislation was passed to create another body of home defence cavalry known as Provisional Cavalry. Like the Militia, these were raised by ballot if insufficient volunteers came forward, and were considered socially inferior by the Yeomanry and Volunteers.Fortescue, Vol IV, Pt I, p. 522.Mellor. The Berkshire Provisional Cavalry was raised on 17 January 1797 under the command of Lt-Col the Hon Charles Dundas, with six Troops:Tylden, Provisional Cavalry. * N Troop at Newbury * O Troop at Oakingham * A Troop at Abingdon * M Troop at Maidenhead * F Troop at Faringdon * R Troop at Reading (Other sources give the Troop HQs as Abingdon, Hungerford, Maidenhead, Newbury, Reading and Thatcham.) The regiment was embodied for full-time service at Newbury in August 1798 on the orders of the Earl of Radnor as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire and Colonel of the Royal Berkshire Militia. It marched to Bristol under the second-in- command, Major F.S. Stead, and later served at Trowbridge in Wiltshire. In August 1799 the provisional cavalry were placed on the same footing as the fencible cavalry and the regiment's designation was confusingly changed to Berkshire Fencible Cavalry (the original unit now being the 5th Fencible Cavalry, see above). The former provisional cavalry regiments were disbanded in March 1800, at which time part of the Berkshire unit was at Monmouth and part at Reading. On disbandment, Lt-Col Dundas, Maj Stead and some other officers were granted commissions in the Berkshire Yeomanry. Wargrave Rangers When the Windsor Foresters were disbanded, Capt Moses Ximenes sought permission to raise a 'Troop of Gentlemen Cavalry' (Yeomanry) in Berkshire. He offered to pay for its clothing and kit if the arms and accoutrements of the disbanded Windsor Foresters were transferred to it. Royal permission was granted through the Lord-Lieutenant and the Wargrave Rangers was formed, with Ximenes as captain. All the Yeomanry were stood down at the Treaty of Amiens, but when war was resumed in 1803 the Wargrave Rangers were reactivated and the officers received new commissions in April. In August Ximenes offered to raise and pay for a corps of volunteer infantry to be attached to the Troop, with wagons to travel in. It is not known if this proposal was taken up. Sir Morris Ximenes (as he had now become) retired from command of the Wargrave Rangers in March 1809 when he was appointed to a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 2nd Berkshire Local Militia, and Lieutenant William Soundby was promoted to succeed him. In late 1813, with the war drawing to a close, the independent Troops of Gentlemen Cavalry in Berkshire were invited to amalgamate with the 1st Berkshire Cavalry and the Wargrave Rangers was disbanded early in 1814, the officers having retired. However, the 1st Berkshire Cavalry (commanded by Lt-Col Dundas) maintained a Troop at Wargrave from 1817 to 1820, after which it may have joined the new Eastern Berkshire Cavalry.Tylden, Yeomanry. Uniforms and insignia The style of uniform of the Windsor Foresters followed that of the Light Dragoons in the Regular Army, but with a red coat instead of blue; the facings were dark blue and the officers' lace silver. The waistcoat and pantaloons were white. The headdress was a Tarleton helmet with black crest and plume, and the title 'WINDSOR FORESTERS' on the scroll. The officers' sword closely resembled the Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre, but with a plain white sword knot instead of the gold lace with scarlet stripe of the Regulars. The sword was carried in a black leather scabbard with steel mounts. Officers also wore a red cloak with white lining and dark blue cape, which was fastened with a silver metal clasp. The uniform of the Berkshire Provisional Cavalry was a green jacket with red facings and white cords, with green pantaloons. A waistcoat was also worn. The cap was leather with a feather. The regimental guidon was of scarlet silk, with a crown, rose and thistle in the centre and 'Dieu et mon Droit' beneath. In the 1st and 4th corners was the White Horse of Hanover, in the 2nd and 3rd was the lettering 'Berks. Prov. Y.C.' with a rose and thistle wreath on a green ground. The Wargrave Rangers wore a blue coat faced red with white lace or cords, conforming to the other Troops of Yeomanry Cavalry in Berkshire.

Iranian officials said that the drone violated their airspace, while U.S. officials responded that the drone was in international airspace. Both Iran and the U.S. differ on where the incident actually occurred. The incident occurred amid rising tensions between the two countries and nearly resulted in an armed confrontation. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a military strike against IRGC radar and missile sites before reversing the decision. Instead, the U.S. retaliated with cyber attacks on the IRGC's missile-control systems (which Iran says were firewalled), announced new sanctions against several important Iranians, and requested a closed-door UN Security Council meeting to address the regional tensions.  Background  The U.S. has been flying surveillance drones in support of maritime security and to spy on Iran for many years. To abide by international law, such flights must take place in international airspace. Aside from the frequent legal reconnaissance flights, Iran has protested what it alleges are violations of its sovereign air space. It has said that two U.S. spy drones crashed in Iran, a Shadow 200 (), which it said crashed inside Iran in Ilam Province on July 4, 2005, and a Hermes drone near Khorramabad, about inside Iran, on August 25, 2005. A later program of secret drone flights within Iranian airspace, run by the American Central Intelligence Agency, came to light following Iran's capture of a stealth spy drone inside Iranian territory on December 5, 2011. The program entailed frequently sending stealth drones into Iran. The drone involved in this incident was one of four Broad Area Maritime Surveillance- Demonstrator () RQ-4 Global Hawks built as predecessors to the MQ-4C Triton, and operated by the U.S. Navy. The drone is believed to be the largest drone in the entire fleet of the U.S military. An MQ-4C Triton has a price of $182 million (including costs). The flies at high altitude, but is not a stealth aircraft. It does not carry munitions.  Incident  Infra-red video of the RQ-4A shoot-down from the U.S. P-8 aircraftIranian Major General and IRGC commander Hossein Salami said that the drone took off at 00:14 local time from a U.S. military base south of the Persian Gulf and flying toward Chabahar. He alleged that, on its return journey, it violated the Iranian airspace near the Strait of Hormuz. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that the drone was at when it was targeted at 04:05 local time (23:35 GMT, June 19). These GPS coordinates put it at off Iran's coast, within the of its claimed territorial waters. According to Iran, the drone was struck by an Iranian-produced 3rd Khordad SAM located near Garuk, Hormozgan Province. However, citing a Pentagon official, Newsweek reported the missile as a Russian-origin S-125 Neva/Pechora. Iranian forces displayed sections of the drone, which the foreign minister stated had been retrieved from Iranian territorial waters. According to TIME, smoke from the drone was seen as shown in a video by the U.S military. Map of the flight path according to American claim, and an infra-red image of an apparent explosion taken on June 19, 2019 at 23:39:26 GMT. Provided by alt=The Iranian account of the drone's location at the time of the shoot-down is contested by the United States. The commander of United States Air Forces Central Command, Air Force Lieutenant General Joseph Guastella, said the \\"closest that the drone got to the Iranian coast was 21 miles.\\" Later, U.S. Central Command issued a map of the 's flight path, showing the attack position as several miles outside Iran's territorial waters. They also released an infra-red image of an apparent explosion destroying the taken from another aircraft at , off Iran's coast. The New York Times, citing a senior official in the Trump administration, reported that there were some doubts inside the administration about whether the drone and a Boeing Poseidon manned aircraft had indeed avoided Iranian airspace throughout their entire flights. Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of Aerospace Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said that the U.S. was warned twice about the infringement of Iran's territorial limit and stated: Hajizadeh also talked about the manned American P-8 plane over Iran's territory: An RQ-4 Global Hawk similar to that downed by Iran. Iranians stated that the had heeded warnings and moved further off the Iranian coast. The is a naval aircraft that the U.S. uses for surveillance that is equipped with weapons to destroy ships and submarines.The Times of Israel, June 21, 2019, \\"Top Iranian General: We Could Have Downed a US Plane with Crew of 35, But Didn‚Äôt; Head of IRGC Aerospace Force Says Army Deliberately Avoided Targeting Jet that Accompanied Drone, Claims 2 Warnings Were Given Before UAV Was Destroyed\\" Hours later, the Pentagon confirmed the presence of a Poseidon aircraft close to the incident. U.S. President Donald Trump later echoed Hajizadeh's statement regarding the : > There was a plane with 38 people yesterday, did you see that? I think that‚Äôs > a big story. They had it in their sights and they didn‚Äôt shoot it down. I > think they were very wise not to do that. And we appreciate that they didn‚Äôt > do that. I think that was a very wise decision.Trump: I'll be Iran's 'best > friend' if it acquires no nuclear weapons The Guardian On June 25, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev echoed the Iranian account, stating Russian military intelligence showed that the U.S. drone was shot down in Iranian airspace. Patrushev said that Iran \\"has always been and remains our ally and partner\\".  U.S. response  Alleged remnants of the RQ-4A drone. Image published by Tasnim News Agency = Aborted military response = Following the incident, President Donald Trump tweeted that Iran had made a \\"big mistake\\". The Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines of a \\"potential for miscalculation or misidentification\\" as numerous flights began to be diverted from the Tehran flight information region. The United States also requested a June 24 closed-door United Nations Security Council meeting to address the regional tensions with Iran, according to diplomats. Several hours later, The New York Times, citing \\"multiple senior administration officials involved in or briefed on the deliberations,\\" reported that Trump had ordered a retaliatory military strike on several Iranian radar and missile sites, but then withdrew the order. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and CIA Director Gina Haspel were reportedly in favor of a military response and objected to the reversal. Vice President Mike Pence initially supported limited military strikes but also agreed with the president's decision to halt them. Trump later confirmed that he aborted an attack, tweeting that he was in \\"no hurry\\" to attack Iran and halted his order \\"10 minutes before the strike\\" because it was only then that he learned that Iranian casualties were estimated to be 150 killed, which he said was \\"not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone\\". In an interview with NBC News, he expounded on his decision-making process, saying that though the strike package was \\"cocked and loaded\\", he had not given final approval to the operation and added that no warplanes were in the air before the reversal. He reiterated that he did not want war with Iran and was open to unconditional talks with Iranian leadership, but affirmed that they \\"can't have nuclear weapons\\" and warned that in the event of a conflict there would be \\"obliteration like you've never seen before\\". A June 22 article in The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed administration officials close to internal deliberations, reported that, privately, Trump bemoaned the cost of the downed drone - around $130 million (not including R&D;) - but said that it would pale in comparison in the eyes of U.S. citizens to potential Iranian casualties. One source said the collateral damage estimate of 150 killed came from the White House, not the Pentagon, which two others said guessed lower. The WSJ report also stated that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford cautioned against a strike, significantly influencing Trump's decision. In leaked diplomatic documents, UK ambassador to Washington Kim Darroch questioned Trump's claim that he had aborted the missile strike because it would have caused 150 casualties, saying it \\"doesn't stand up\\". \\"It's more likely that he was never fully on board and that he was worried about how this apparent reversal of his 2016 campaign promises would look come 2020\\". On June 23, Bolton warned Iran to not \\"mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness\\" and that \\"no one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East. Our military is rebuilt, new and ready to go.\\" Former Deputy Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Mick Mulroy said in an interview with Foreign Policy that it was important for Iran not to take a lack of action by the United States as an indicator of what will happen in the future. If they should directly attack U.S. forces, he would suspect that they wouldn‚Äôt see the same restraint. On June 27, a week after the incident, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein confirmed that U.S. drone operations in the region were continuing unabated despite the shoot-down. The day prior, he also downplayed the regional tensions, saying he did not see a \\"significant change\\" in the Iranian military's defensive posture or capabilities. = Cyber attacks and sanctions = On June 22, it was reported that Trump had approved cyber attacks intended to disable IRGC computer systems used to control rocket and missile launches the day of the shoot-down. The cyber strikes were in development \\"for weeks if not months\\" and handled by U.S. Cyber Command in conjunction with U.S. Central Command. It represented the first offensive show of force since Cyber Command was elevated to a full combatant command in May 2018. Also on June 22, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to U.S. industries that Iran was stepping up cyber attacks of critical industries ‚Äî particularly oil, gas and other energy sectors ‚Äî and government agencies, and have the potential to disrupt or destroy systems. On June 24, Trump announced new targeted sanctions against Iranian and Revolutionary Guard Corps leadership, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his office. IRGC targets included Naval commander Alireza Tangsiri, Aerospace commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh, and Ground commander Mohammad Pakpour. The sanctions also targeted the commanders of the IRGC Navy's five districts: Abbas Gholamshahi, Ramezan Zirahi, Yadollah Badin, Mansour Ravankar, and Ali Ozma'i. The sanctions largely freeze any assets under U.S. jurisdiction, block the targeted leaders from dollar-denominated transactions and bar international banks from moving money on their behalf. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions will block \\"literally billions\\" in assets and that Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif will also be sanctioned within the week. Zarif was later sanctioned on July 31. Also on June 24, Iranian Information and Communications Technology Minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi said the cyber attacks were firewalled: \\"They try hard, but they have yet to carry out a successful attack.\\" This followed a report in The New York Times, citing current and former officials, saying the Trump administration was urging U.S. military and intelligence officers to develop new methods for unconventional clandestine operations against Iran, to avoid using conventional military options.

In 1997 a small group of people who were part of the 1978 events contributed to planning the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Mardi Gras parade in 1998. This group became known as the 78ers and has led each year's Mardi Gras parade since 1998. History The first Sydney Mardi Gras was an evening street protest in support of gay and lesbian rights along Oxford Street in Sydney on 24 June 1978. The protestors were assaulted and thrown in gaol, with many affected by the trauma for years afterwards. The 78ers were amongst those who participated in the Mardi Gras and the protest at Darlinghurst and Central Police Stations on 25 June 1978, the protest at Central Court Sydney on 26 June 1978 where 300 protested outside the closed court in Liverpool Street and seven were arrested, the gay rights march from Martin Place to Darlinghurst Police Station on 15 July 1978 where 2,000 protested and 14 were arrested and the March down Oxford Street from the 4th National Homosexual Conference to Taylor Square and Hyde Park on 27 August 1978 with 300 participants and 104 arrests. Most of the charges against those arrested were eventually dropped and the New South Wales Summary Offences Act, which had given Police very wide powers to arrest people, was repealed in May 1979. In the days following the Sydney Morning Herald published the names, occupations and addresses of people facing charges. In 1997 a small group of people who were part of the 1978 events contributed to planning the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Mardi Gras parade in 1998. This group became known as the 78ers and has led each year's Mardi Gras parade since 1998.

Gerald Cantor Roof Garden of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The installation consists of two sculptures, Parapivot I and Parapivot II, each consisting of multiple steel frames which hold polished stone balls. Description Across the two pieces, there are nine balls, each made of marble and granite, sourced from nine different countries, including Brazil, Germany, India, Italy, Norway, and Sweden. Each of the balls, one of which weighs , is intended to signify one of the nine planets of the Solar System. The balls are held in place by supports in the steel frames. The installation is similar to We Come in Peace, the preceding installation by Huma Bhabha, in that they both relate to outer space. Alicja Kwade said that the skyscrapers in the landscape behind the installation were representative of capitalism and compared the associated people to gods. She said that the art was intended to \\"put planets on top of [these people]\\". She also said that the installation was meant to evoke thinking about the nature of the Earth. According to The New York Times, Kelly Baum said that Kwade was chosen for the commission because her work engaged with science, especially astrophysics and illusionism. Initially, the Met wanted Kwade to produce an item similar to WeltenLinie for the commission.  Critical response  Taylor Dafoe of Artnet News observed that Kwade's work was informed by \\"cosmic clarity\\" and \\"worldly wonder\\". Dafoe also noted that the sculptures were reminiscent of kinetic art, despite not having any moving parts. Zachary Small for Hyperallergic wrote that in the installation, Kwade captured \\"the universe‚Äôs unfathomable scope into a few frames\\" and engaged the tensions between art and science, as they relate to \\"objective truth\\". Jason Farago of The New York Times said, \\"Her sculpture makes use of optical tricks and careful positioning to evoke the instability, and the unknowability, of our place in the world.\\" He also wrote that the two sculptures engage flawlessly with the landscape of New York City and synthesize \\"sculpture, city and universe\\".

Born in Camberwell, in his youth, Merrion was a keen footballer. He left school at the age of fourteen and found work in a factory, but was sacked due to his focus on football. In 1920, he found work as a bricklayer, but suffered a serious illness in 1922. While recovering, he became interested in politics, joining the Labour Party, and also the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers. He won election to Enfield Borough Council, and served for periods as secretary and then chair of the Enfield Labour Party. In the run-up to World War II, Merrion was involved in constructing air raid shelters across London, and he was invited to speak about this on the radio. The BBC was trialing putting \\"ordinary people\\" on the radio, and Merrion was perhaps the most popular, thereafter featuring regularly on programmes including The Brains Trust, and even presenting a series of The Week in Westminster. At the 1950 UK general election, Merrion stood as a Labour Party candidate in Portsmouth South, with sponsorship from his union; he took 36.1% of the vote and was not elected. He then stood in Southend East in 1951, and Exeter at the 1955 UK general election, on both occasions increasing the party's vote share, but taking second place.

It was added to the Victorian Heritage Database on 15 October 1970. The house (museum) and garden are open to the public Wednesday to Sunday.  House  = Delhi Villa = Buda was built by a retired Baptist Missionary, Reverend James Smith, in 1861 and originally named Delhi Villa. The original design was a six-roomed brick house with an encircling verandah, based on the Indian Bungalow style. This was considered by Smith to be most suitable style of housing for the Australian climate. Within two years, Smith decided to return with his family to his missionary work in India and the house was put up for auction. = Ernest Leviny purchases Delhi Villa = The property was purchased in 1863 by successful businessman, Ernest Leviny. This became the marital home for Leviny and his second wife, Bertha Hudson, whom he married the following year and together they raised a family of ten children in the house. Leviny oversaw many changes and alterations to the house, particularly between the years 1890 ‚Äì 1900. It was around this time that the house was renamed Buda after the capital of Hungary, Budapest. = Buda today = The house we see today reflects Leviny's envisaged ‚Äògentleman‚Äôs villa‚Äô, a house befitting a successful Victorian businessman with its Italianate fa√ßade and surrounding 1.2 hectares of garden. Buda retains its ‚Äúparsley‚Äù green trims and shutters, characteristic of the country homes of Ernest Leviny's European origins. = Buda and the Leviny daughters‚Äô legacy = The Leviny family inhabited the house continuously for 118 years from 1863 to 1981 when the last surviving daughter, Hilda, died at the age of 98 years. After Ernest's death in 1905, the influence of the British Arts and Crafts style, embraced by his daughters, became more marked on the house interior. Evidence of this can be seen in interior fittings and colour schemes, handcrafted items, metalwork light fittings and embroidered soft furnishings, mostly made by the Leviny women to decorate their home. It was largely due to the foresight of last surviving sister, Hilda, that Buda was preserved as a house and garden museum when she sold the property to the Castlemaine Art Gallery in 1970. Her sisters, Mary and Kate, left a broader civic legacy through their involvement in establishing the Castlemaine Art Gallery in 1913, and assisting with the development of the gallery's fine collection of prints in the late 1920s.  Garden  This gold rush era home set on 3 acres of original established gardens has much to attract the keen gardener, as well as anyone wishing to step back in time and relax in the gentle surrounds of an historic country estate. The Buda garden is one of the most significant large nineteenth century, early twentieth century gardens surviving in Victoria. It is significant for the compartmentalised nature of the layout, relative intactness and for the survival of two notable garden buildings, the aviary and the former tennis pavilion.  Nursery  The nursery is open to the public every day.  Leviny family  The house is full of Ernest's and the daughters' artworks and light covers, one of the daughters even painted the cornice in one of the bedrooms. = Ernest Leviny = Ernest Leviny was born at Georgenberg, Hungary, in 1818 and trained as a silversmith and jeweller in Budapest. Arriving at Port Phillip, Melbourne, early in 1853, he went directly to the rich alluvial goldfields of Forest Creek, and the bustling new township of Castlemaine. There, he established a successful watchmaking and jewellery business in the Market Square. By 1863, he was able to retire from business and purchase Delhi Villa. In 1864, he married Bertha Hudson, bringing her to Castlemaine to settle at Delhi Villa. Leviny was a clock maker, goldsmith and silversmith. = Children = Ernest and Bertha had ten children between 1865 and 1883: four sons: Louis, Alfred, Ernest and Francis, and six daughters: Mary, Ilma, Beatrice (Kate), Gertrude, Bertha (Dorothy) and Hilda. Of their four sons, two died under the age of five years. The Leviny daughters were encouraged to pursue their artistic interests at a time when women were being given more opportunities to study art and take up careers. They worked across a range of media including painting, woodcarving, metalwork, needlework and photography. Each of the daughters was creative in some form of art or craft. * Mary, the eldest, had much to do in helping to run the household, and was a major contributor to making everyone's clothes, embroidering, smocking and decorating. * Hilda specialised in embroidery. * Gertrude specialised in woodcarving * Kate specialised in photography * Dorothy specialised in metal and enamel work  References  External links *Buda's website Category:Gardens in Victoria (Australia) Category:Historic house museums in Victoria (Australia) Category:Victorian architecture in Victoria (Australia) Category:Tourist attractions in Victoria (Australia) Category:Victorian Heritage Register ","title":"Buda (house)"},{"id":"61096516","text":"Vakivumuge Kurin is a Maldivian romantic drama television series developed for Television Maldives by Fathimath Nahula and Aishath Rishmy.

Developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) it provided information predicting crop viability in different locations and climatic conditions. It also served as a catalog of plants and plant growth characteristics.  History  Ecocrop first emerged in 1991 after planning and initial expert consultancies were completed concerning the development of a database. This system was developed by the Land and Water Development Division of FAO (AGLL) and was launched in 1992. The goal was to create a tool that can identify plant species for given environments and uses, and as an information system contributing to a Land Use Planning concept. In 1994, the Ecocrop database already permitted the identification of more than 1,700 crops and 12-20 environment requirements covering all of the agro-ecological settings of the world. Succeeding iterations of the database from 1998 to 1999 mainly involved improvements to the user interface. By the year 2000, the database included 2,000 species and 10 additional descriptors. This number was later expanded with the addition of 300 crop species. As of February 2020 the Ecocrop database hosted at fao.org is not accessible.  The Ecocrop model  K√∂ppen Map (Asia) The Ecocrop model determines a crop's suitability to a location by evaluating different variables. Specifically, the plant descriptors include category, life form, growth habit, and life span while environmental descriptors include temperature, precipitation, light intensity, K√∂ppen climate classification, photoperiodism, latitude, altitude, and other soil characteristics. The crop database is particularly useful if there is no alternative but to use environmental ranges. Once these inputs are determined, the system produces a suitability index as a percentage. The suitability index score is generated from 0 to 1 with the former indicating totally unsuitable while the latter indicates optimal or excellent suitability. The output also include separated suitability values for temperature and precipitation. As a prediction model, the Ecocrop algorithm yields data that are more generic than those produced by other models such as DOMAIN and BIOCLIM. The information is generic with respect to the nature of the requirements and is attributed to the lack of information concerning specific crops. Another limitation is that the results depend solely on bioclimatic factors and discounts other variables such as soil requirements, pests, and diseases. Ecocrop evaluates whether climatic conditions are adequate within a growing season for temperature and precipitation every month. It involves the calculation of climatic suitability based on rainfall and temperature marginal and optimal ranges.  Other uses  Aside from serving as a plant identifier, Ecocrop is also used for other purposes. For instance, it can assess the influence of future climate change on crop suitability. It can also be used to project crop yields using the database's information on optimal and absolute crop growing conditions (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation values, values that define temperature and precipitation extremes).

History  In 1996 Barough was working as a stylist when she had a dream that she was power walking the New York City Marathon in a bra to raise money for breast cancer causes. At the time she had never been involved in charity fundraising and had no connection to breast cancer and although she enjoyed walking she had never power walked before. However, she decided to act on the dream and, with a team of friends she walked the marathon that year raising ¬£25,000 for Breakthrough Breast Cancer. Two months later Barough found a lump in her breast while on a work trip to the United States and was diagnosed with cancer herself. She gave up her business in order to focus on treatment, undergoing a mastectomy, breast reconstruction, radiotherapy and injections of Zoladex. With the blessing of her surgeon she delayed surgery to take part in the London Marathon. But the next year, 1998, when a larger group wanted to join her, there were not enough places available so she decided to organise her own event the night before the official London Marathon finishing in Trafalgar Square just before the official marathon started. This evolved into The MoonWalk London, a mass fundraising event which takes place in London every spring. Since the first walk in 1996, over 370,000 women, men and children have taken part, raising over ¬£131 million for research into breast cancer and to improve the lives of people living with cancer. MoonWalks take place in London, Edinburgh and Iceland. MoonWalkers take part in city marathons including London, Paris, Berlin, Dublin and New York and other fundraising events include an Arctic Challenge back country skiing challenge in Swedish Lapland. During this time Barough gained expertise in power walking which led to the publication of her book, Walking for Fitness. She makes regular appearances in the media offering fitness advice and championing walking as a low impact way of achieving fitness without risking injury. Barough continues as Chief Executive of Walk the Walk at its headquarters in Woking, Surrey and is Event Director for all The MoonWalks.

The bridge was built in late Sasanian era on Karkheh River, parts of which constitutes the modern-day border of Ilam and Lorestan provinces. It is in length and about in width. It has the longest arch span among the ancient bridges in Iran. It is known by many experts as an engineering feat considering the time it was built, the material used and the floods it has withstood during its age of 1400 years. It is believed that the bridge was intentionally destructed by the Persian Army to stop or slow down the invasion of Arabs during the Muslim Conquest of Persia in the 7th century.  Location  The bridge passes Karkheh river, which is the confluence of Seymareh and Kashkan rivers. Nowadays, Seymareh and Karkheh indicate the eastern border of Ilam Province. It is 20 km east of Darreh Shahr, and 30 km from Pol-e Dokhtar, near the modern bridge.  Restoration  According to texts, the bridge was once restored by Vaali of Posht-Kooh about 200 years ago.

It enables customers to pay weekly for household and electrical goods.  History  The business was established on 30 October 2006 and stocks furniture, entertainment devices, appliances and technology. Brands sold include Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Hotpoint and Indesit. PerfectHome currently has approximately 250 employees and its head office is based in Birmingham. Customers who buy a product from PerfectHome on a pay weekly basis are entering a hire purchase agreement with the company. The company charges a representative APR of 69.5% APR to 119.9%. In 2011, American lease-to-own company Aaron's Inc bought a minority stake in PerfectHome, valuing the company at ¬£87m. In early 2018 PerfectHome saw interest from a number of potential buyers, and in June 2018 the business was sold to Brixworth Investments (UK) Ltd., an affiliate of Elliott Advisors (UK) Limited.  Industry regulator  In April 2014, the consumer credit industry saw a change in regulator from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). At that time, companies that held an OFT licence and registered for interim permission were allowed to continue carrying out consumer credit activities whilst their applications for FCA authorisation were considered. PerfectHome received FCA authorisation on 14 December 2017. In April 2019 the FCA introduced a pricing cap for the rent-to-own sector, with a new set of rules about pricing and the total cost of agreements. As an FCA-authorised business, PerfectHome adjusted its offering to reflect the new parameters.  TV Advertising  In 2016, PerfectHome launched a ¬£4m campaign featuring a talking cat, co-created with Wallace and Gromit creators Aardman Animations  ASA rulings  On 24 May 2016, PerfectHome broadcast a TV advert which was later challenged by the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA). A viewer argued that the advert didn't give the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) figure adequate prominence, as required. The ASA argued whether the advert, particularly the claim \\"style up the kitchen with big brand appliances\\", promoted the purchase of items on high- interest credit in an irresponsible manner. The investigation was upheld and the ASA confirmed that the advert had breached BCAP Code rule 1.2 (Social responsibility). In turn, the advert was removed from broadcast. On 25 October 2018, PerfectHome broadcast a TV advert which was later challenged by the ASA. A complaint highlighted that the advert used lyrics from the Fairground Attraction song 'Perfect': \\"It's got to be perfect, it's got to be worth it. Too many people take second best, but I won't take anything less. It's got to be perfect\\" while walking around a house that contained a number of high-value items such as an iPad, wireless headphones, an American-style fridge freezer, and a flat screen TV. The ASA argued whether the use of the lyrics combined with luxury items promoted the purchase of items on high-interest credit in an irresponsible manner.  Financial Conduct Authority redress programme  As PerfectHome worked towards FCA authorisation, the FCA advised the company that some of its historic practices did not meet the standards it expected as the new regulator of consumer credit firms. Processes around theft and accidental damage insurance, cancelled sales and a smaller number of affordability checks did fail some of its customers and were all stopped. In March 2018, PerfectHome agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) a package of redress totalling over ¬£2.1 million. This was made up of cash payments and balance write-offs for 37,000 customers.

The name of the style is Japanese and literally translates as Style of the Big Dipper, though is more commonly translated as Style of the North Star. The style uses a Japanese name to show respect to the origin country of the art. Practitioners of the style can be recognized by the logo of the style on their jujutsugi, a red inversed triangle. The style does not rely on physical strength and instead relies on speed, timing and \\"martial eye\\". The techniques of the style contain punches, kicks, throws, takedowns, jointlocks, chokes, pins, breakfalls, clinch fighting, ground fighting and weapon techniques. Sparring and training against both armed and unarmed opponents is also an important part of the style. Style seeks to keep the principles of the traditional Japanese martial art while making it more fitting with western culture. The style is good for both men and women. Roughly 40% of its practitioners are female. Niiniketo notes that women are often more technically proficient, where as men can easily fall back to relying on brute force. There are roughly 50 Hokutoryu schools around the world and the style has spread to several countries, including but not limited to: Russia, Belarus, Estonia, Iran, Ecuador, United States, Sweden and Norway. Most of the schools however are located in Finland.  Auvo Niiniketo  S≈çke Auvo Niiniketo, (born. 1954) (10. dan) \\"Father of Finnish Ju-Jutsu\\" has been training martial arts for most of his life, starting with boxing at the age of eight and winning the national youth championship in 1972 at 75KG and winning bronze in national championship in 1974. Niiniketo was introduced to Ju-Jutsu in Stockholm, Sweden, during a boxing trip, which immediately appealed to him, seeing it as a complete martial art. After ending his active boxing career, he started practicing Karate, finding its kicks to be particularly effective. Though he enjoyed kihon, it was kumite that appealed to him the most. Niiniketo later decided to start training Ju-Jutsu. Niiniketo received his first Ju-Jutsu belt ranks up to blue belt in Sweden, as Finland did not have a Ju-Jutsu dojo at the time. In 1977 he started the first Ju-Jutsu courses in Helsinki and soon after this he opened his first dojo in Helsinki, which was also the first Ju-Jutsu dojo in Finland. This was the founding of Hokutoryu. In 1978 Niiniketo met English senseis Richard Morris and Robert Clark from World Ju-Jitsu Federation and co-operates with them to this day. This co- operation initially led to Hokutoryu losing all of its belt ranks when switching to a new system but Hokutoryu made quick progress in the new system. In 1979, Niiniketo received his Ju-Jutsu black belt from Morris and Clark. During his time in Sweden, Niiniketo continued to cross-train in Karate and he ultimately won the Finnish national heavyweight championship in 1979. In 1980, Niiniketo brought kickboxing to Finland and started courses and building a national team for Finland. He works with kickboxing to this day and presents Finland at WAKO. In 2007, in Hokutoryus 30th anniversary celebrations, Niiniketo received the rank of 9. dan and the title of S≈çke from Richard Morris. In 2014, in his 60th birthday celebrations, Niiniketo received the rank of 10. dan in Hokutoryu Ju-Jutsu and 6. dan in kickboxing, making him the highest rank holder in both arts in Finland. In 2015, Niiniketo received the honorary title Councelor of Exercise from Sauli Niinist√∂, President of Finland.  Ranks  Hokutoryus rank system is based on the standard Japanese belt color rank system developed by Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç, founder of Judo. Rank system consists of ky≈´s (color belts), dans (black belts) and mons (junior color belts). On top of learning the required techniques, grading requires the jujutsuka to have spent a certain amount of time as their current belt rank, as well as having partaken in a certain amount of classes as their current belt rank. Grading also requires the jujutsuka to have participated in a certain amount of national training camps, though in their case, only the total amount of participations is required, rather than amount of participations as a certain belt rank. There are four national camps each year. Ranks include: * 6th ky≈´/mon, white, starting rank * 5th ky≈´/mon, yellow, no time, class or camp requirements but learning the techniques generally takes 2‚Äì3 months. * 4th ky≈´/mon, orange, requires six months and 40 class participations as a yellow belt and one national camp participation. * 3rd ky≈´/mon, green, requires one year and 110 class participations as an orange belt and three national camp participations . * 2nd ky≈´/mon, blue, requires one year and 110 class participations as a green belt and five national camp participations. * 1st ky≈´/mon, brown, requires one year and 110 class participations as a blue belt and seven national camp participations. Dan ranks go from 1 to 10 and rank holders generally use a black belt, though at higher dan ranks, red-and-black, red-and-white and red belts may be used. Holder of a black belt is generally known as a sensei. Higher dan ranks might have other titles as well such as shihan, hanshi or kyoshi. Even the 1st dan belt tests are highly demanding and roughly half fail the test. Black belt requires the jujutsuka to have spent at least 2 years as a brown belt and at least six years in the style in total and have some experience as an instructor of a class. One cannot apply to a black belt test themselves. Instead, their sensei must send an application to the S≈çke if they believe their student is ready for it. If one successfully completes a black belt test, they received the title of sensei.  Randori  Randori or free sparring is an important part of the style and a requirement in belt tests from green belt onwards. Randori in Hokutoryu is full-contact. The intention of a jujutsuka is to use powerful striking techniques to either knock the opponent out or weaken their defence so that they can be thrown or swept down and if necessary, finished with a jointlock or a chokehold. Randori consists of three parts: stand-up fighting, clinch fighting and ground fighting. Randori always starts with stand-up fighting after which the jujutsuka can move from one part to another. In stand-up fighting, the jujutsuka is free to use any Ju-Jutsu striking techniques against the torso. Punches or knee strikes to the head are not allowed but kicks are. Low kicks are allowed as long as they aren't straight kicks. Elbow strikes are not allowed to any part of the body. A grounded opponent may be attacked with a kick only if they have their knee on the ground. In clinch fighting, the jujutsuka may throw, sweep or takedown their opponent by using any technique provided it does not stress the neck or the spine. Jointlocks and chokeholds while taking the opponent down are not allowed but they are still allowed in clinch fighting as long as no attempts at a takedown are made while applying or trying to apply them. In ground fighting, twisting jointlocks on knees are not allowed under any circumstances. Other than that, any jointlock is allowed as long as it doesn't target the neck, spine or a small joint. Chokeholds are allowed, both ones which use ones own hands and ones which make use of opponents jujutsugi. Jujutsuka wear blue and red belts in randori to make it easier to tell them apart. = Prohibited behavior and techniques = The following are considered prohibited behavior and techniques: * Running away, intentionally falling down, showing fear, turning one‚Äôs back or pretending to be injured * Any unsportsmanlike conduct * Any comments or protests * Insults or inappropriate gestures and expressions * Head-butts * Punches to the head, throat, neck and upper shoulder area * Kicks to the throat and neck area * Strikes to the back, groin or directly to joints * Knee strikes to the head * Kicking the opponent on the ground while standing, unless the opponent has a knee on the ground * Downwards or sideways kicks with the heel of the foot while fighting on the ground * Straight kicks to legs, knees or ankles * Any attempted or actual throws, sweeps or takedowns while applying or trying to apply a jointlock or a chokehold * Jointlocks on the neck or spine * Any turning or twisting jointlocks which affects the knee joint * Pulling or twisting the opponents fingers * Pulling or tearing the opponents jujutsugi * Any use of unauthorized techniques * All jointlocks except those targeting the elbow joint in fights between less than 14-year olds * All chokeholds in fights between less than 16-year olds * Knockouts by kicks to the head in fights between less than 18-year olds = Rule categories = Rules are divided into Category A rules and Category B rules. The sparring rules themselves are essentially the same in both Categories but Category B features more protective equipment. Category A equipment includes groin protection and a gum shield. Women must also wear a female chest protector and a headguard, though some organizers may decide against using the latter. In addition to Category A rules, Category B also features elastic shin and instep guards and grappling gloves. In tournaments, all fights may be fought as Category B fights. All national, continental and international championship finals must be fought with Category A rules. = Weight classes = Hokutoryu contains 13 weight classes, seven for men and six for women. Male weight classes include -65 kg, -73 kg, -80 kg, -86 kg, -94 kg, -100 kg and +100 kg classes. Female weight classes include -52 kg, -60 kg, -66 kg, -72 kg, -78 kg and +78 kg classes.  Special types  In addition to standard Hokutoryu, the style also contains three special types: * Junior Ju- Jutsu: Made for children between 7 and 14. This type removes techniques which are seen as too dangerous for children, such as chokes, weapon techniques and most jointlocks. * Police Ju-Jutsu: Made for law enforcement and security guards. Main focus is on facing a violent person, seizing them and controlling them. As such, this type mainly uses techniques which are useful for controlling the opponent, such as wristlocks, as well as use of special equipment which are not used in standard Hokutoryu, such as handcuffs. Type is used by some police departments in Finland, such as Turku, where a group of police trains twice a week. * Military Ju-Jutsu: Made for soldiers. As such, it contains lethal techniques which are generally not used in other types of Hokutoryu, though many techniques cross-over with Police Ju-Jutsu. Military Ju-Jutsu is a part of training for cadets, military police and frogmen in the Finnish Defence Forces.

They mainly live in Mechelen and Antwerp (cities in Flanders). Assyrians also live in Li√®ge and Brussels. The majority of the Assyrian diaspora living in Belgium are of Turkish descent. They are from Bohtan (Beth-Qardu),Bohtan Neo-Aramaic Tur-Abdin and Hakk√¢ri.  History  The first Assyrians came to Belgium around 1980; mostly from Turkey. They were political immigrants due to the Turkish-Kurdish conflicts in Southeast Turkey. They left their houses and moved to Europe for a brighter future. The latest group of Assyrians immigrants come from Iraq and Syria. They began migrating after the first Gulf War. In the 1980s (as with other immigrants in Europe), nationalism started to develop among the Assyrians in Belgium. This was a huge step for oppressed Assyrians who had no hope or vision for the future. The Assyrian genocide played a major part to this negative mindset. The freedom that Assyrians received in the West triggered cultural, social, economic and linguistic projects. Assyrians from Belgium demonstrated to raise awareness about the Assyrian genocide (just like other Assyrians).  Current situation  Assyrians integrated into Belgian society while maintaining their cultural identity, supporting social events organized by Assyrian clubs. Assyrians in Belgium started projects to publish an Assyrian grammar book by Efrem Yildiz, organise trips with Association Assyro-Chaldeans Belgium, produce an Assyrian movie Akitu, represent Assyrians in the Belgian government (such as Elisabeth Okmen), and founding the Assyrian Belgian Youth (AJB). Municipal councillors of Assyrian descent took office in Brussels, Etterbeek, Li√®ge and Mechelen, including Ibrahim Erkan (Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Christian Democrats), Sandrine Es (Etterbeek, Liberal Party) and Ibrahim Hanna (Etterbeek, Christian Democrats). New Flemish Alliance councilman Melikan Kucam is featured in Mechelen aan de Tigris (Mechelen on the Tigris), a book by Flemish author August Thiry about Assyrian refugees from Hassana in the southeastern Turkish district of Silopi. Many Assyrians in Belgium belong to either the Chaldean Catholic Church or the Syriac Orthodox Church, with smaller numbers belonging to the Assyrian Church of the East. The first Assyrians mainly worked in factories or opened restaurants, but today, most attend university and work in all economic sectors.

Early life and education  Ronald Patrick Austin grew up in Maitland, New South Wales and was the oldest of five children. He entered the Redemptorist monastery in Mayfield, Newcastle at the age of 16 but left in 1951. He enrolled in the National Art School in Newcastle before moving to Darlinghurst, Sydney to enroll in the National Art School there.  Activism  Austin was an early member of the Campaign Against Moral Persecution (CAMP) group, an LGBTIQ rights activism group working to end discrimination against members of the LGBTIQ community, having joined in 1971. In 1978, this group were planning protests in support of LGBTIQ rights. From 21-27 May 1978, 900 people attended Sydney's first gay film festival at the Paris Theatre. One of the films, Word is Out, which included footage from the San Francisco Freedom Day Parade inspired Austin, a member of CAMP, with the idea of a street party which later became the first Mardi Gras in June of that year. The suggestion that the demonstrations should be a street party led to the first march on 24 June 1978. His friend Lance Gowland assisted with obtaining the permit, driving the truck and setting up the sound system. 53 people were arrested for participating. This event became a catalyst for a series of protests and led to the repeal in April 1979 of the NSW Summary Offences Act, under which the arrests had been made. The Mardi Gras became an annual event, and Austin marched in every parade for decades.  Death and legacy  Austin died on 13 April 2019 aged 90. The Mardi Gras Awards, given out annually, include the Ron Austin Award for Most Fabulous Parade Entry.

Biography  Kathryn Reed Altman was born to Richard Reed and Lois Cummings in Glendale, California on June 2, 1924. She died in Santa Monica, California on March 9, 2016.  Career  Altman completed high school at Hollywood High School. She then joined the musical revue Earl Carroll Vanities. She began her acting career as a swimmer in Million Dollar Mermaid (1952), that featured Esther Williams, the American swimmer and actress. During an acting appearance as a nurse in one of the television episodes of Whirlybirds in 1959, Kathryn Reed met the American film director Robert Altman, who was directing the series at that time. They married in 1959 and were married for 47 years, until his death in 2006. It was after their marriage that Kathryn Reed Altman shifted her focus from the pursuit of an acting career to an active and supportive role in facilitating her husband's film career and also to their children, which at that time were four. She had a daughter, Konni, from her first marriage to Tommy Pederson. Robert had three children from his previous two marriages: a daughter and two sons, Christine, Stephan, and Michael. They later had two sons together, Robert and Matthew. Altman would frequently travel to the locations of her husband's film sets that were located in various places around the globe, bring their children along with her. Altman became a prolific archivist watchfully documenting her husband's film career. She would frequently assist him on his films sets; although none of these roles were listed in the films' credits. She filled 32 photo albums with thousands of pictures of their professional and family related activities. Her documentation was the basis of her book Altman that was co-authored with Giulia D'Argnolo Vallan. In 1965 her husband made the short film The Kathryn Reed Story, for her as a birthday gift; which is now part the Robert Altman Collection at the University of Michigan's Special Collections Library. Altman had established this collection with the university. Altman continued to be very active well after her husband's death and became a featured speaker at various retrospectives of his work; attending special screenings in London, Venice, New York City and Los Angeles.

He was a novelist, playwright and best known for his profound influence on what was to become later the literary genres of science fiction and crime novels. He was the most widely read author during the second half of the nineteenth and the turn of the century, according to literary critic Jovan Skerliƒá. Unfortunately, science fiction and crime novel writing at the beginning of the 20th century was not considered a literary pursuit and as time passed he was forgotten until the 1970s when his works were revived. He was a contemporary of Jules Verne, Camille Flammarion, and H. G. Wells. Biography Lazar Komarƒçiƒá was born in a small village of Komartica, near the town of Pljevlja, Montenegro (then part of the Ottoman Empire), on the ninth of January 1839, to Milenko and Spasenija Komorica of Gornja Maoca in northeastern Bosnia. Turks killed Lazar's uncle and Milenko (Lazar's father) took revenge. He was captured and imprisoned in Pljevlja. After Milenko escaped, he took his wife and children and moved with kin in Valjevo. It was at this time that the family changed their surname to Komarƒçiƒá. In Valjevo Lazar started school, but his parents soon both died. He moved to Belgrade where he studied at the Grandes √©coles (University of Belgrade). A defining incident of Komarƒçiƒá's life was the Turkish bombardment of Belgrade in 1862 that left him without three fingers. An incident erupted at ƒåukur ƒçesma (ƒåukur Fountain) when Savo Petkoviƒá, a teenager, who was trying to get water at the fountain was shot and killed by a Turkish soldier which infuriated the citizens of Belgrade and erupted into a major conflict between Serbs and Turkish occupying forces. Belgrade was then bombarded from Kalemegdan. During that bombardment by Turkish artillery from Kalimegdan fortress, Komarƒçiƒá at twenty-three held his ground together with the rest of Serbian insurgents. A Turkish grenade exploded near him causing him to lose three fingers on his right hand. What became known as the ƒåukur Fountain conflict brought the intervention of the European Powers and the Turks were soon expelled from Belgrade. After receiving that wound Komarƒçiƒá decided to go into teaching, and from this time onwards he made writing his principal work. To help out his sister, he went to Crna Bara to buy and take over her business. After three or four years as a tavern keeper, he returned to Belgrade and began his literary career by contributing articles to a local journal, \\"Srbija.\\" He also wrote for \\"Zbor.\\" Eight of his novels were published at a time when Jules Verne, Camille Flammarion, and H. G. Wells were independently working on the same genre. His most popular novel \\"Jedna uga≈°ena zvezda\\" (One Extinguished Star) is heavily influenced by spiritism. Komarƒçiƒá, like most writers of his generation, was influenced by Rufina Noeggerath (1821-1908), the famous Finnish spiritist who was known affectionately as \\"Bonne Maman\\" in her day. Before the war of 1876, Komarƒçiƒá took a leading place among the most radical section of Serbian politicians as an opponent of the \\"opportunists\\" who continued the policy of Svetozar Markoviƒá. In 1875 he became an editor of \\"Zbor\\", and worked with varying success to bring about the revision of the sentences passed on the so- called socialists. Komarƒçiƒá descriptive powers were of the highest order, and his style, pure of all affectations and embellishments, is of singular force and suppleness. With all his limitations, he was as original a genius as Serbia produced during the turn of the century. He died at Belgrade on the ninth of January 1909. Works Cover of Komarƒçiƒá's Ancestors and Descendants Lazar Komarƒçiƒá position in Serbian literature is unique. There was nothing like his type of novel before his time. Komarƒçiƒá wrote in 1902 the first modern Serbian science fiction novel \\"Jedna uga≈°ena zvezda\\" (One Extinguished Star), and in collaboration with Dragutin Iliƒá, a drama entitled \\"Posle milijon godina\\" (A Million Years From Now, 1888). Interestingly, the first science fiction drama on this planet was performed in Belgrade and published in the magazine Kolo in 1889. Both the novel and the drama are now considered the foundation of Serbian science fiction literature, with occult influences. Also, Komarƒçiƒá wrote such popular novels as: * \\"Dragocena ogrlica\\" (An Expensive Necklace) in 1880, * \\"Dva Amaneta\\" in 1893, * \\"Prosioci\\" (Beggers, 1905), * \\"Jedan razoren um: i Zapisnik jednog pokojnika\\" (1908), * \\"Muƒçenici za slobodu\\", * \\"Pretci i potomci: istorijske slike iz postanja danasnje Srbije\\" (1905), * \\"Bezdu≈°nici\\" (Heartless Men, novel). Legacy His contribution to the genre as a writer, along with the novelists Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, he is one person in Serbia sometimes called \\"The Father of Science Fiction\\". In his honour, awards are presented to authors of the best science fiction work by the \\"Drustvo ljubitelja fanatstike 'Lazar Komarƒçiƒá'\\". This Belgrade sci-fi fan club \\"Lazar Komarƒçiƒá\\" continues to keep his name alive today.

According to one of its founders, Paul Buhle, the magazine was \\"born from the collapse of the New Left and hopes for a new beginning of a social movement, but also of left-wing thinking about culture\\". Cultural Correspondence was part of a wave of cultural criticism journals founded in the 1970s that addressed popular culture. Buhle and Dave Wagner were its founding editors. They had previously collaborated on Radical America, but after they moved to different locations, their letters to each other led to the idea for Cultural Correspondence. The journal was originally published in Providence, Rhode Island. Some of the early issues were also produced in collaboration with the Green Mountain Irregulars. Cultural Correspondence typically published leftist social commentary, with a particular emphasis on poetry, humor, and comics. Contributors to the magazine included: C. L. R. James, George Lipsitz, Edith Hoshino Altbach, Eva Cockcroft, and R. Crumb. In May 1981, Paul Buhle and James Murray met on the way to an anti-Reagan demonstration. Following the fourteenth issue of Cultural Correspondences initial run, Murray and Lucy Lippard collaborated with Buhle on a new series of Cultural Correspondence, as a project of Political Art Documentation/Distribution (PAD/D). After this, the magazine was published in New York. Around the same time in 1982, Cultural Correspondence also organized the Radical Humor Conference and Festival in New York, a conference of \\"Left-academic self-ridicule\\". The influence of PAD/D (with its interest in archiving and artistic activism) on Cultural Correspondence can be seen in the third issue of its new series, which deviated from the magazine's normal format by including a long directory of artistic political projects. That issue was titled We will not be disappeared!: Directory of Arts Activism. An archive of Cultural Correspondence issues is held in a digital repository by the Brown University Library.

He was the designer of the Brisch Classification, widely known and used in building and engineering. He became a British citizen in the 1940s. Edward G Brisch photographed in the 1940s (studio unknown)  Biography  Born in Lodz, Poland, he gained an Intermediate B.Sc. (Engineering) at the Technical University of Warsaw, then a diploma in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toulouse. He returned to Warsaw, where from 1926 to 1929 he was Assistant Chief Designer at the Ursus tractor factory, and was then appointed Works Manager of Citro√´n's Warsaw branch. He remained there until 1932 before taking on the role of Engineer in charge of Development of National Production at the Polish State Engineering Works.Brisch and Geoghegan (1957) p. 571 By now married, in 1934 he established an engineering consultancy in Warsaw, transferring soon afterwards to Paris, where he did some work for the British Army‚Äôs armoured vehicle operations. Returning to Poland in summer 1939 to visit his family, trapped there by the German invasion, he escaped to Riga in Latvia, but Latvia was to be occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. Unable to return to Paris, Brisch was urged by the British War Office and Vickers Ltd to come to England, but that journey proved extremely difficult. Sir Stafford Cripps, then British Ambassador in Moscow, helped to arrange his land and air journey from Riga to Rangoon in British Burma.Brisch (2018) introduction He left Riga in June 1941, scarcely a month before the German occupation, reaching Rangoon (by way of Chungking, wartime capital of China) in August 1941. Burma, in turn, was soon to be conquered by Japan, but he was able to continue his journey via Bombay in British India to Liverpool, a total of some 25,000 miles (40,000 km). Cripps‚Äô intervention had probably saved his life. He kept a record in Polish of this long and hazardous journey, of which the first seven pages have survived. They can now be read online in English translation.Brisch (2018) diary text He arrived in England with a lung ailment, contracted in Burma, and underwent an immediate pneumonectomy, but this left him prone to infections for the rest of his life. In late 1942 he joined the Department of Tank Design of the Ministry of Supply, and worked also during the war years for the War Office school of technology.New York Times (10 April 1960) p. 86 His first wife having died in the Warsaw Ghetto, he married his British nurse, Susan Rogers (1920‚Äì2018), in 1947. In the same year he founded in London a firm of consultants, E. G. Brisch and Partners. R. S. Geoghegan, with whom he had worked at the Department of Tank Design, was to join him in 1953.Brisch and Geoghegan (1957) p. 571 This was the most fruitful period of Brisch's life: his business activities extended to other countries in Europe and beyond. He established an American branch, first in Cleveland (1956) and later in Toledo, Ohio. The American firm had among its early clients the Owens-Illinois Glass Company, the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company, General Electric in Cleveland and the Underwood Company of New York.Brisch (2018) at end, citing obituary In 1957, Brisch moved his family from Oxshott in Surrey to settle in Toledo. Never robust following his lung surgery, he died of pneumonia in Toledo on 9 April 1960. His widow and three children moved back to Surrey in the same year.  The Brisch Classification  Brisch was a member of numerous British and American technical and management societies and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. He wrote several technical papers in his field. His great innovation was the development of a flexible machine-card inventory classification system, which was adopted by major companies in the US and Europe. His work drew some inspiration from the Universal Decimal Classification, used for classifying documents.Brisch (1948) The uniqueness of the idea lies in the nomination of a primary code (typically within nine main headings 00-80) attached to every ‚Äòpart‚Äô, based on its essential features (shape and dimension). A further, secondary, code (based on 81 two-digit numbers, representing concepts, which are divided, and can be used in any conjunction) is then bonded to the parent, determined by its process features (e.g. machining operation). Evolving with the advances of computing and digitisation, the system has spread roots in contemporary situations requiring complicated inventory management.Business DictionaryBusiness Professor The system had wide applicability. In 1955 Brisch published a paper on his classification in the newly established journal of the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux, ASLIB Proceedings.Brisch (1955) Sir Frank Francis, director and principal librarian at the British Museum, in the brief memoir that he contributed to The Times at Brisch's death, recalled frequent discussions on \\"expanding the methods [Brisch] had successfully developed for industry to the classification of documents and books. In the course of these discussions he elaborated a classification for music designed to make possible precise reference to documents illustrating many different aspects of a particular subject.\\"  Publications  * 1948 : \\"Adaptation of the U.D.C.

Biography Ljudevit Vuliƒçeviƒá was born out of wedlock on 30 September 1839 in Cavtat, at the time part of the Habsburg Empire. He was baptized Petar Jeronim but he became well known through his monastic name Ljudevit or Lodovico in Italian. He was raised by his Serbian Catholic mother Jelena Vuliƒçeviƒá, whose name he later embraced. In 1854 he entered the Franciscan Order and completed his high school education in 1856 before taking orders in Pankrac, at the Venetian Monastery where he was ceremonially tonsured. In Venice, he studied philosophy and theology. He returned in Dubrovnik in 1862 as an educated parish priest, only to soon be at odds with the Roman Catholic hierarchy of Dubrovnik. For a while he worked as a missionary in Skadar, Albania. Vuliƒçeviƒá's philosophical and religious essays and treatises were inspired by the idealism of Waldensian Church, to which he converted from Roman Catholicism. He left for Trieste where he decided to convert by joining the Chiesa Evangelista Valdesa (Waldensian Evangelical Church), an Italian Protestant denomination. During his stay in Trieste, Vuliƒçeviƒá took a part in early syndicalism in Italy and was a tutor for the young poet Aleksa ≈†antiƒá. In 1916 died in Naples as one of the noted ministers of the Chiesa Evangelista Valdesa and its original thinker. As he was highly respected and influential in his own country, the Serbian Government took charge of the funeral arrangements in Naples. He is considered to be one of the great masters of Serbian prose in the second half of the nineteenth century. His tomb bears the following inscription as directed by himself: Lodovico Vulicevic scrittore serbo predicatore dell Evangelo negli sviamenti del mondo trovo per la chiesa Valdese il Cristo sua rendenzione Translation: Serbian Author Lodovico Vuliƒçeviƒá, Preacher of the Evangel, who, among the conflicting paths of the world, found, through the Waldensian Church, Christ, his Redeemer.

She was initially a slave trader, and gradually shifted to growing peanuts with slave labour when the West African slave trade started to shrink in the 1830s. She exported peanuts to France via Gor√©e, introduced peanut cultivation in many parts of Guinea and became the likely biggest peanut-planter in Guinea. Her use of slave labour did cause conflicts between her and the British West Africa Squadron, who raded her plantations on Bolama in 1839, and Freetown, who drove her off Bolama in 1860; in the 1850s, she owned a third of all slaves in Guinea.

The Leicester and Leicestershire Amalgamated Hosiery Union was founded in 1885, and attempted to organise throughout the county. However, employers in Hinckley threatened members of the union with the sack, leading them to leave, and workers in the area remained unorganised. Pay and conditions in the Hinckley area became noticeably worse than in Leicester. In 1890, the union made another attempt to organise in the area and, following a nine-week strike, it succeeded, with pay immediately increased by up to 40%. By 1895, trade had worsened, and pay in Hinckley was cut. The local branch of the union was unhappy with this, and in 1897 it broke away, forming the Hinckley and District Hosiery Union. This initially had 900 members, of which 700 were women. Initially, it was successful at improving conditions, but from 1903 local companies began working together, and membership dropped, bottoming out at 300 in 1910. Trade unions across the UK recruited well during World War I, and this was very true of the Hinckley union, which grew to 950 members by the end of 1914, and 2,200 four years later. While the industry then began to decline, demand for seamless hose grew, and as Hinckley was famed for this product, employment grew, and membership of the union peaked at 6,000 in 1939. As a non-essential industry, this fell during World War II to 4,000, and the union became interested in a merger with other local hosiery unions. This was achieved at the start of 1945, with the formation of the National Union of Hosiery and Knitwear Workers. Clifford Groocock, the leader of the Hinckley union, was appointed as general secretary of the new union. General Secretaries :W.

History The professional theatre had been performed in Jamaica for the first time in 1733, but the first permanent theatre company was not installed until the British Theatre Company of John Moody, which came to Kingston in 1746 and given its first permanent theatre building in 'New Theatre' or King's Store on Harbour Street seven years later. This company, which was from 1749 managed by David Douglass, united with the Old American Company in 1758 and left for North America, and when it returned to Jamaica in 1774, the old building, having been in disuse for many years, was no longer regarded sufficient. The Old American Company successfully asked the colonial government for a new theater building, and the Kingston Theatre was inaugurated in the Parade area in 1775. Kingston Theatre was reportedly relatively small, but it played an important role as the island's main venue and as a part of the official representational life of the British Governor and the high society life of the Jamaican Planter aristocracy. It enjoyed success during the American Revolutionary War when performances were staged three to four times a week and the boxes of the theater were leased by the members of the planter elite. Old American Company left Jamaica for the United States in 1785, and the Kingston Theatre was used for concerts, circus performances, amateur theaters and other activities for the next years. In 1790‚Äì1803, it was managed by private owners. The building was expanded in 1814, and reportedly had 700 seats in 1821. Kingston Theatre again operated as a theater in 1812‚Äì1822, during which it enjoyed a period of great popularity. It did become somewhat notorious for the frequent fights which occurred, some of them with racial tensions. The theater operated again in 1827‚Äì29, and was otherwise employed for a number of different entertainments. In 1838, the building was deemed to be too decrepit and was deemed to be destroyed. It was succeeded by the Theatre Royal, Kingston, which was opened in 1840.

Description  The painting depicts the story from Ovid's Metamorphoses of the weaving contest between the god Athena and the mortal Arachne. In the original myth, Athena challenges Arachne and loses, but Athena punishes Arachne anyway for insulting the gods by not recognizing the divine source of Athena's artistic skill and for creating a more beautiful work than her own. In the background of the canvas hangs a partially-visible tapestry of Titian's The Rape of Europa which, according to Ovid's version of the story, was the theme of the tapestry woven by Athena during the conest with Arachne.  Influence  Rubens's Pallas and Arachne was copied by Juan Bautista Mart√≠nez del Mazo, the Spanish Baroque painter and son-in-law of Diego Vel√°zquez. Vel√°zquez positioned Mazo's copy of Pallas and Arachne behind him during his composition of Las Meninas, which he paired with another painting about different contest of the arts between gods and mortals (Apollo as Victor over Pan). The copy of Pallas and Arachne was then painted into the background of the scene in Las Meninas, which would go on to be one of the most recognized and analyzed canvases in the history of western art.Las Meninas: Is This The Best Painting In History?

Rocchi exhibited signs of weakness in his limbs since his childhood but was not diagnosed until he was eight with a disease (D.M.D.) that led to a progressive muscular decline. He struggled with his condition at first but a religious experience in his adolescence seemed to restore him from his struggles and a commitment to preach the Gospel message to all while using his own suffering to demonstrate the need for people to love more. Rocchi made pilgrimages to Lourdes and to Loreto where he came to know and correspond with its prelate Loris Francesco Capovilla. He was also close with several other priests and figures such as the journalist (and later politician) Ettore Masina and his diocesan bishop (later cardinal) Ersilio Tonini. The process for his beatification commenced in the 1990s in smaller steps that were undertaken in his diocese since 1991 to launch a formal cause. This formal activation came in 1992 and he became titled as a Servant of God. The cause took a decisive step forward on 3 April 2014 after Pope Francis signed a decree that named him as Venerable upon confirming that Rocchi had lived a life practicing heroic virtue. Life =Childhood= Luigi Rocchi was born on 19 February 1932 in the San Giovanni Addolorata Hospital in Rome as the first of three children to Francesco Rocchi (13.12.1906‚Äì30.7.1991) and Maria Pascucci (20.5.1910‚Äì???). His first home was in Via Assisi 29 in the Ognissanti parish where he received his baptism on 17 April 1932 from the parish priest Father Angelo Michaele Cominola in the names of \\"Luigi Pacifico Carlo\\". His grandmother relocated to Rome from Tolentino in order to help raise him. His paternal grandparents were Lorenzo Rocchi and Maria Pascolini and his maternal grandparents were Nazareno Pascucci and Augusta Pelliccioni. His father was born in Caldarola in the Macerata province and was married to Rocchi's mother on 30 November 1929. His siblings were Gabriella (b. 3 September 1938) and Alba (b. 26 May 1946). The Rocchi's ‚Äì when he was two in 1934 ‚Äì relocated to the industrial Tolentino area in the Macerata province where it was hoped that his father could find new work since his previous work at La Marchigiana failed resulting in workers out of a job. His father found work in Tolentino in the paper mill that Vincenzo Porcelli managed and worked there for over five decades before retiring (which he found difficult to adjust to). The Rocchi's lived first in a suburban area in an apartment and then in the central district close to the cathedral. In his small house in the Tolentino neighborhood he could see the church of Santa Maria Nuova out of one of the small windows. His mother (who was devout) was responsible for his religious upbringing and he valued this later in life as he would later write about; she would call him \\"Luigino\\" with affection. His maternal grandmother also helped to raise him in his childhood; he would later recall her often giving him pine nuts or dried figs from her apron pockets. Rocchi first demonstrated signs of muscular decline in 1936 and this became pronounced at his First Communion when his mother had to help him to the balustrade. In 1940 he was diagnosed with having a disease (D.M.D.) that would lead to progressive muscular decline that impeded motor and muscular functions. He had been sent first to the children's hospital in Ancona before being sent to Bologna where the diagnosis was made. He had to use a cane (and later two) in order to move and at fifteen he was using one when he fell from a flight of stairs. He was unharmed though attributed his fortune to \\"the intervention of the Madonna\\" as he told his mother who helped him. =Education= Rocchi entered into a state school in Tolentino in the Piazza Sant'Agnese (now the Piazza Don Bosco) and at that time the Fascist regime under Benito Mussolini mandated that all public school students be enrolled in the Giovent√π Italiana del Littorio. This included Rocchi around 1942 even though he had no particular liking for Fascism. He was an Introverted student and marginalized due to his being unable to do sports or things that the other students could do. He was noted for his discretion in language but was known to joke with others on occasion. He also attended catechism classes and his parish priest Primo Minnoni considered him among the best of his students with a particular flair for communication. He made his first confession in the week leading to the reception of his First Communion and then attended a retreat in order to prepare for the latter event. He made his First Communion on 8 September 1941. He completed school in June 1944 before making an effort to seek work and so tried tailoring. His health prevented him from holding an iron or using a sewing needle so he was forced to abandon this. He enrolled in middle school in 1947 in Tolentino and during this time was exempted from sports due to his condition and studied French as a foreign language class. Rocchi also fell often at school so much so that the dean had written a letter to his mother in 1951 asking that he be kept at home in order to prevent further accidents in what ended Rocchi's schooling. He tried to enroll in two other schools but was rejected on the account of his condition. His passion for reading books of all sorts enabled him to home-school himself and he read books on the natural sciences as well as genetics among other subjects. He suffered a setback in 1944 during a fire caused in an aerial bombardment towards the end of World War II that saw him too close to the blast zone which left him bald for the remainder of his life. He had been visiting the Rizzoli Hospital in Bologna at the time. In his adolescence he came into contact with members of the Catholic Action movement and later was registered to it alongside some few friends in the Oratorio di San Catervo. He also made pilgrimages often to Lourdes and Loreto due to his strong devotion to the Blessed Mother. =Religious experience= Rocchi also recalled a specific incident when he found an old broken crucifix that he fixed and cleaned and then Varnished with wood oil before hanging it up in his bedroom. He said that one night he was struggling with severe pain when he began speaking to Jesus Christ about his life and struggles which led to an immense light coming out of the crucifix and illuminating the room. This incident inspired him to accept his suffering despite his dislike of it and to transmit the messages in the Gospel to others to find God. This had transformed Rocchi from sadness and crisis to one of peace and a desire to do good for others and he would later reflect that \\"suffering made me realize that it is sweet to be loved\\". =Adulthood= People often came to see Rocchi at his home for brief catechesis lessons or for spiritual counsel or even just to give him their good wishes (it included his bishop and future cardinal Ersilio Tonini who often visited him). It made him a known figure in his hometown and the opposite of his childhood when his peers often mocked him for his weaknesses that he discerned became his strengths. He also knew and corresponded with Bishop (later cardinal) Loris Francesco Capovilla whom he would often speak with or see in Loreto. In the 1960s the Augustinian priest Angelo Alessandri visited him often to bring him the Eucharist and to hear his confession. Alessandri once even accompanied Rocchi on a pilgrimage to Loreto while his mother accompanied him on a pilgrimage to Lourdes in 1969. The Rocchi's relocated to a new home in Viale Vittorio Veneto 52 in the Santissimo Crocifisso parish in Tolentino. He relied on his parents to care for him during this time since he was unable to live alone and never married despite wanting to when he finished his education. In his life he wrote frequent letters but as his life went on could no longer use his arms and hands. To that end he had a device built that had a short pole attached to his mouth that he could direct so he could use touch the letters on his typewriter that became a permanent fixture in his room. Rocchi also became part of the Rete Radi√© Resch network that the journalist and politician Ettore Masina co-founded alongside the French liberation theologian Paul Gauthier. He also started writing articles for the Messaggero di Sant'Antonio in the 1970s until his death. In one such article in 1975 he said that \\"these are bestial times ... when God is excluded, the door is opened to the beast\\" in reference to unloving people and the need for people to love more. Rocchi heard a television report in 1971 detailing the disease he suffered from which prompted him to send a letter to his friend Gabriella Bentivoglio (whom he met in 1963) asking for relevant data on that television piece since he had the disease it referred to. Bentivoglio transmitted his letter to Ettore Masina ‚Äì a journalist from Rai 2 ‚Äì who contacted him with the data and asked Rocchi to join the network that he had co-founded. His reputation was noted in Tolentino and the wider Macerata region and he would often be referred to as the \\"saint in a wheelchair\\" which was a moniker given to him even after his death and which is still continued at present. =Declining health and death= He lived out his final month in an intensive care unit at the Ospedale Generale Provincale Macerata since 8 March 1979 due to a severe deterioration in his condition. He had fallen ill with bronchitis at the beginning of February prompting the doctor to refer him to the hospital for treatment. He had entered the emergency room with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress which prompted for him to be intubated and attached to an automatic respirator. This machine passed through his vocal cords rendering him unable to speak. The machine was removed and a tracheotomy was performed in order to improve his breathing though still prevented him from speaking. This forced him to use an alphabet list to compose words or messages to nurses or to his relatives and visitors; he also asked for a bell in case of emergencies. His nurse later recalled that Rocchi was an ideal patient because he cooperated with them. From 23 March he could no longer react or communicate with others and his condition became critical on 24 March. He died at around 10:00 pm on 26 March due to a cardio- circulatory arrest. His remains are interred in Tolentino. His friend Saulo Baroncia said after his death that Rocchi had \\"occupied a privileged place in paradise\\". Cardinal Angelo Comastri ‚Äì who developed a devotion to Rocchi while the Prelate of Loreto ‚Äì presided over an event in the Co-Cathedral of San Catervo di Tolentino to celebrate the news in 2014 that Rocchi's beatification process had advanced to the next stage. Loris Francesco Capovilla said that Rocchi was an \\"impeded man\\" but one who was \\"in the presence of the Lord\\" while Ettore Masina referred to Rocchi as a \\"sentinel of conscience and reason\\". Cardinal Ersilio Tonini would later mention that he could see Rocchi's love and passion for God while seeing how God guided his actions and words. Tonini recalled at a conference dedicated to him in 1992 that Rocchi disliked suffering but accepted it as a manner in which he could support others who suffered in similar circumstances. He had left around 1700 letters during his life. Beatification process The beatification process for Rocchi launched on 9 April 1992 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause) edict and titled Rocchi as a Servant of God. This edict therefore enabled for Rocchi's diocese to commence a diocesan investigation looking into his reputation for holiness and gathering documentation (such as his letters) and witness testimonies (from relatives or friends and so on). The diocesan process was opened in the Macerata-Tolentino- Recanati-Cingoli-Treia diocese on 17 October 1992 and was later closed on 22 April 1995 both under Bishop Francesco Tarcisio Carboni. The process moved to Rome where the C.C.S. was given control of the cause.

A number of species described from his collections have been named after him including Kalinowski's mastiff bat (Mormopterus kalinowskii ), Kalinowski's Oldfield mouse (Thomasomys kalinowskii ), Kalinowski's agouti (Dasyprocta kalinowskii ), and Kalinowski's mouse opossum (Hyladelphys kalinowskii }. Kalinowski was born in Okuniew where his father was a forester. He began to work for W≈Çadys≈Çaw Taczanowski at the Zoological Museum in Warsaw. His first collecting expedition sponsored by Count Konstanty Branicki (1824-1884) was into Kamchatka with Benedict Dybowski. He stayed on from 1883 after Dybowski returned and explored Japan and Korea. He collected numerous insects and birds. The specimens he collected were examined and found to be new species by the Russian entomologist General Oktawiusz Radoszkowski. Kalinowski returned to Warsaw in 1888 and was tasked by Taczanowski to collect in Peru. Here he met and married Maria Villamonte settling in Peru. He set up a hacienda \\"La Cadena\\" and continued to collect specimens and sent them to museums in Europe and America.

Svenska reformdr√§kter : kvinnokl√§der f√∂r en ny tid. Uppsala: Uppsala Universitet, Textilvetenskap. Libris 13941878 It was a part of the Victorian dress reform, and worked to reform women's dress toward a more healthy and comfortable one, including abolishing the corset. The movement attracted a lot of attention and achieved some success during its duration, such as making corsets unfashionable among school girls. History =Foundation= The views of the Victorian dress reform was made known in Sweden by the book Dress and Health, which was translated to Swedish under the name Reformdr√§gten (likely by Oscara von Sydow) with an introduction by Curt Wallis and Hanna Winge. In February 1885, Anne Charlotte Leffler held a speech on the subject in the women's club Nya Idun, and asked Hanna Winge to design a Swedish reform dress, and when this was done, Leffler became the first woman in Sweden to wear a reform costume. This created publicity, and in April 1886, a group of women founded the 'Svenska dr√§gtreformf√∂reningen' with the purpose of introducing and adapt the Victorian dress reform movement's ideas in Sweden. Many famous contemporary Swedish women were members of the Svenska dr√§gtreformf√∂reningen. Among the members where Anna Hierta-Retzius and Ellen Key, who acted as its first, temporary chairperson upon its foundation, until a permanent one could be elected. =Activity= The society was active in changing public opinion toward a more healthy dress for women by public lectures, articles and publications. It was given wide support by Scandinavian medical doctors, and Curt Wallis, Karolina Widerstr√∂m and Lorentz Dietrichson all wrote supporting articles which denounced particularly tight lace corseting as unhealthy. In 1889, queen Sophia invited the chairperson to an official audience and invited her to display the reform dresses designed by Augusta Lundin at Ulriksdal Palace, and afterward gave the society her formal support, which was publicized as a great success. =Impact= While no separate dress reform society was established in the other Nordic nations of Denmark, Finland and Norway, the women's movement in these countries was influenced by the Swedish dress reform society and was also active in the issue. The reform dress of the society was manufactured by Friends of Handicraft and by the studio of Augusta Lundin, who dressed her gofers in the reform dress. The reform dress in itself never managed to become popular, although a few radical women such as Calla Curman, Sonja Kovalevsky, Alfhild Agrell and Anna Boberg, wore the reform dress in public. However, the society did achieve some success in regard to the use of corsets on girls. In the 1890s, it was reported that the use of corsets within Swedish girl' schools had diminished markedly, as it was no longer regarded proper for a school girl to wear a corset. =Dissolution= In 1890, the association became a part of the Fredrika Bremer Association. It was considered a natural step for Swedish women's associations at the time to organize under the FBA, but it sorted as a separate entity under the FBA and continued to function independently. After 1896, however, the progressively more simple and comfortable fashion, the introduction of sportswear during cycling and the decrease in tight laced corset made the activity of the society diminish. In 1903, it was dissolved. ;Chairperson: * 1886-1889: Kerstin Bohman * 1889-1892: Marie-Louise Berg * 1892-1896: Gurli Linder See also * Rational Dress Society * National Dress Reform Association * Artistic Dress movement References Category:19th century in Sweden Category:1886 in Sweden Category:Feminist organizations in Sweden Category:1886 establishments in Sweden Category:1903 disestablishments in Sweden Category:1886 in women's history Category:19th-century fashion Category:Clothing controversies Category:History of clothing (Western fashion) ","title":"Swedish Dress Reform Association"},{"id":"61098939","text":"Bikaner ‚Äì Haridwar Express is also known as Gita Ganga Express is an Express train belonging to North Western Railway zone of Indian Railways that run between and in India.

Founded in 1967 by John van Hengel, St. Mary's was the first modern organization to operate using the food bank model, which spread throughout U.S. and the rest of the world. Today, St. Mary's is recognized as the world's first food bank. Since its creation, St. Mary's has expanded its operations to nine of Arizona's fifteen counties, distributing millions of pounds of food to the hungry each year. St. Mary's also operates its own food pantry, allowing people to get food directly from the warehouse. The organization additionally offers specialized programs apart from food banking, including after-school programs for children and career training for adults. St. Mary's is a member of Feeding America, a network of hunger-relief organizations also founded by van Hengel with the purpose of providing food to people across the country. Foundation and history Prior to founding St. Mary's Food Bank, John van Hengel lived in Phoenix and volunteered at St. Vincent de Paul Soup Kitchen. Van Hengel spent much of his time collecting food to supply the soup kitchen and donating the surplus to the homeless throughout the city. Eventually, he was introduced to a struggling mother of ten who used the food thrown out by grocery stores to feed her children. She expressed her desire for a place where unwanted food could be collected and given to the hungry, much like a bank collects and distributes money. After searching through dumpsters and noting that much of the discarded food was still edible, van Hengel decided to establish a \\"food bank\\" where unwanted food would be gathered in large quantities. St. Mary's Basilica of Phoenix loaned van Hengel $3,000 and provided him with an abandoned bakery to operate out of. With that, St. Mary's Food Bank was founded in 1967 and named after the basilica in honor of their contribution. St. Mary's began operating by developing partnerships with grocery stores, food producers, and social welfare organizations throughout Phoenix. By acting as a clearinghouse for these partner organizations, St. Mary's distributed over of food in its first year. That number increased to \\"about a million pounds of food\\" by the end of 1968, according to van Hengel. With limited financial resources, St. Mary's relied heavily on volunteers to operate, and focused on obtaining food rather than monetary donations. Guided by the motto \\"the poor we shall always have with us, but why the hungry?,\\" St. Mary's continued to attract more volunteers and partner agencies to its mission, allowing the food bank to expand its reach through Phoenix and other parts of Arizona. By 1975, the concept of food banking had gained popularity in other parts of the United States. Van Hengel was offered a federal grant to help spread the food banking concept across the country and left St. Mary's to form the organization known today as Feeding America. He returned to St. Mary's in 1982, while also working as a consultant for new food bank operations as the concept spread worldwide. St. Mary's continued operating in Arizona using the same model that was being adopted by organizations across the world. Today, St. Mary's is able to collect and distribute meals to more than 600 agencies statewide. The organization estimates that it will provide over 90 million meals to Arizonans in 2019, with the goal of providing 100 million meals to those in need by 2021. Programs Congressmember David Schweikert visiting St. Mary's Food Bank during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. =Food distribution= St. Mary's has over 600 partner agencies in nine different Arizona counties, including homeless shelters, food pantries, and dining halls. St. Mary's still operates using the traditional \\"warehouse\\" model of food banking, supplying their partner agencies with donated food. In addition to assuming the role of a traditional food bank, St. Mary's also runs its own food pantry, allowing people to get food directly from their warehouses. St. Mary's frequently offers \\"mobile\\" food pantries ‚Äì semi trucks filled with food products ‚Äì in various locations throughout Arizona. These mobile pantries normally run on regular schedules, but they have also been dispatched for special occasions. During the 2018‚Äì19 United States federal government shutdown, for example, St. Mary's held a mobile food pantry to provide food for local TSA employees who were working without pay. =Partnerships and support= Through their Hunger Heroes program,Hunger Heroes program St. Mary's has partnered with a wide variety of local and global companies who donate food, funding, and volunteers to the food bank. According to St. Mary's, it costs one dollar to provide seven meals for a single person, making fundraising a powerful tool in providing assistance to Arizonans. program Companies and organizations that have partnered with St. Mary's include: Many of St. Mary's partners also participate in special campaigns. The annual \\"Fight Hunger. Spark Change\\" is one such campaign, where Walmart employees work with local volunteers to distribute meals from mobile food pantries across the state. Additionally, Walmart and Sam's Club donate a predetermined amount of money to St. Mary's when customers buy select items in stores. In the 2018 campaign, St. Mary's received enough money to distribute 1.67 million meals across Arizona. =Children's feeding programs= Roughly one-in-four children in Arizona struggle with hunger. the state was ranked the fifth-worst in the U.S. for food insecurity. To combat this, St. Mary's has created programs to provide nutritious meals for children. The Kids Cafe is an after-school program where children can receive free meals while engaged in tutoring or recreational activities. This program provides roughly 6,000 meals daily to over 130 locations in Arizona. The program is also available during the summer, when children don't have access to the free meals they might receive at school. The Backpack Program partners with schools and community centers to distribute bags packed with a weekend's supply of food. These bags are given to children once a week with the goal of helping their entire family. Each bag contains enough food to supply three meals for a family of four. St. Mary's partners with over 100 schools and community centers to distribute 3,000 backpacks per week. =Community Kitchen= The Community Kitchen is a 12-week course where adults learn to work in the food-service industry while also developing career and professional skills. The program is intended to help those with barriers to employment develop the skills to become more self-sufficient, providing them with job placement support upon completing the course. =Arizona charitable tax credit= St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance is classified as a \\"qualifying charitable organization\\" by the Arizona Department of Revenue, meaning that residents can receive a tax credit for donations up to $800.

Early life Roy, as he was known, was born on 12 May 1885. He was the only child of Helen (n√©e Wyllie) Kennard (1856‚Äì1928) and Lieutenant Hugh Coleridge Downing Kennard (1859‚Äì1886) of the 1st Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, who married in 1883. After his father's death in 1886, his mother remarried to James Laurence Carew, an Irish nationalist politician and Member of Parliament, in 1896. His aunt, Meredith Sophia Frances Kennard, Lady Rawlinson, was the wife of Lt. Gen. Sir Henry Seymour Rawlinson, 2nd Baronet. In 1904, Jacques-√âmile Blanche painted a portrait of Roy \\"which captures him at the age of 19 as a young dandy, as he was renowned in fashionable society for his good looks.\\" His mother, a close friend of Oscar Wilde, reportedly strongly disapproved of the portrait of her son as a tall, slender man with long tapered fingers caused a \\"life-long rift\\" between his mother and Blanche and was not exhibited between 1908 and 1924. Roy, however, agreed to exhibit the painting as long as his name was not disclosed. Therefore, the portrait was exhibited anonymously in 1924 under the title \\"Le portrait de Dorian Gray\\". In 1909, his mother instigated the commission of the Oscar Wilde's tomb in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris by Jacob Epstein with her donation to Robert Ross. Kennard was educated at Eton College. Career On 11 February 1891, the then five-year- old Coleridge was created baronet of Fernhill in the County of Southampton. The baronetcy was originally intended for his grandfather and namesake Coleridge Kennard, co-founder of the Evening News and Member of Parliament for Salisbury from 1882 to 1885, who had died on 25 December 1890, before the patent was gazetted. His grandmother Ellen Georgiana Kennard had on 17 January 1892 been granted the style and precedence as if her husband had been created a baronet.Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition). New York: St Martin's Press, 1990. =Diplomatic career= After serving in the Grenadier Guards like his father, he joined the Diplomatic Service, serving between 1908 and 1919, in Italy, Persia, Sweden and Finland. Personal life Reportedly, while serving at the foreign office, he \\"became infatuated with the wife of James Frances Buckley, of Castle Gorford, in Carmarthenshire. After Kennard made his intentions of marriage known, in writing (and threatening suicide if she did not elope with him), Buckley and his wife divorced. While waiting for the statutory six-month period to expire, Mrs. Buckley went to Italy and Kennard went to Persia to serve as attach√© and third secretary under Sir George Head Barclay. While in Tehran, he met Barclay's daughter, Dorothy Katherine Barclay (‚Äì1953). Roy and Dorothy fell in love and when Mrs. Buckley travelled to Tehran to meet him, he refused to see her. As British Minister Plenipotentiary, who had authority over all British subjects in Persia, Sir George forced Mrs. Buckley to leave the country. Kennard married Dorothy on 5 April 1911, Dorothy, an author who published a book about her life in Roumania, was the only child of Barclay and his American wife, Lady Barclay, the former Beatrix Mary Jay Chapman. Dorothy's maternal grandfather was Henry Grafton Chapman Jr., who served as President of the New York Stock Exchange, and her uncle was noted writer John Jay Chapman. Her maternal great-grandfather was John Jay, the U.S. Minister to Austria-Hungary. Before their 1918 divorce, they were the parents of two sons: * Sir Lawrence Ury Charles Kennard, 2nd Baronet (1912‚Äì1967), who married Joan Liesl Perschke, daughter of William Thomas Perschke. * Sir George Arnold Ford Kennard, 3rd Baronet (1915‚Äì1999), a Lieutenant-Colonel of the 4th Queen's Own Hussars who married four times. On 21 July 1924, Kennard married for the second time to Mary Graham Orr-Lewis (d. 1931), the youngest daughter of Canadian businessman Sir Frederick Orr-Lewis, 1st Baronet and Maude (n√©e Booth) Orr-Lewis. After her father's death, her brother became the 2nd Baronet, and her sister, Helen Merryday Orr-Lewis, married Sir Albert Gerald Stern. Kennard died on 7 October 1948 and his eldest son became the 2nd Kennard baronet. Upon the death of his youngest son, the third Baronet, the baronetcy became extinct as there were no male issue. =Descendants= Through his son George, he was the grandfather of Zandra Kennard (b. 1941), who married Major John Middleton Neilson Powell in 1962 and is the mother of Edward Coleridge Cokayne Powell (b. 1964) and Louise Cecilia Powell (b. 1966).Edward Coleridge Cokayne Powell is the a father to Nikita Louise Powell and Daniel Peter George Powell.

Mississippi, No. 17‚Äì9572, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the use of peremptory challenges to remove black jurors during a series of Mississippi criminal trials for Curtis Flowers, a black man convicted on murder charges. Previously the U.S. Supreme Court held in Batson v. Kentucky that the use of peremptory challenges solely on the basis of race is unconstitutional.. This case examined whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied Batson to this case.. The Supreme Court ruled that Flowers' case fell under Batson, and the state inappropriately removed most of the potential black jurors during the trials. Case background Curtis Flowers was accused in 1996 of four murders in a furniture store in Winona, Mississippi. Since his arrest, Flowers has seen six separate jury trials. The first three trials ended with overturned convictions from the Mississippi Supreme Court on review, citing prosecutorial misconduct in all three trials, while the fourth and fifth ended in a mistrial. At issue throughout these trials was the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges to eliminate prospective African-Americans from the jury, leaving a solely white jury despite the population distribution near Winona being near 50% white, 50% African-American. Only by the fourth trial did two African-Americans sit on the jury, resulting in a hung jury. The sixth trial, held in 2010, found Flowers guilty of all four crimes, and he was sentenced to death. The jury here was formed from one African-American juror - the first one questioned by the prosecutor who subsequently used his remaining peremptory challenges to dismiss five additional African-American jurors. Flowers appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court again arguing on the peremptory challenges. The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the verdict. Flowers petitioned to the United States Supreme Court, who summarily remanded the case to the Mississippi Supreme Court and told the court to review the peremptory challenge under the Batson challenge established in the case Batson v. Kentucky. On review, the Mississippi Supreme Court still found against Flowers, ruling that the prosecutor was not racially biased in the use of peremptory challenges during Flowers' trial. One aspect that was argued in this retrial was the past behavior in the previous trials that Flowers' defense felt showed a clear racial discrimination pattern by the prosecution to remove African-American jurors from the jury, but which the Mississippi Supreme Court dismissed in their Batson analysis. Flowers re-petitioned to the US Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to the case in November 2018. The case was limited to the question of whether the Mississippi's oversight of the prosecution's past use of peremptory challenges in Flowers' prior trials was proper within the scope of the Batson challenge. Oral arguments were heard on March 20, 2019. Opinions =Majority opinion by Brett Kavanaugh= On June 21, 2019, in a 7‚Äì2 decision authored by Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Court held that the Flowers case clearly fell under Batson and the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in upholding the trial court's conviction. In its history of 6 trials prosecuting Flowers for murder, the previous 5 of which ended in mistrials or vacated convictions, the state struck 41 of the 42 prospective black jurors. Some of the selected white jurors had similar answers to struck black jurors and when the prosecutor was asked for explanations other than race for excluding the jurors, the prosecutor also gave inaccurate or provably false explanations for excluding black jurors. =Concurrence by Samuel Alito= Samuel Alito wrote a concurrence. Alito stated that he believes this was ‚Äúa highly unusual case‚Äù that was likely ‚Äúone of a kind.‚Äù Alito also stated that this was ‚Äúnot an ordinary case, and the jury selection process cannot be analyzed as if it were.‚Äù =Dissent by Clarence Thomas= Clarence Thomas wrote the dissenting opinion, which was joined in part by Neil Gorsuch, stating that they would have upheld Flowers‚Äô conviction. Thomas suggested that the prosecution's use of their peremptory challenge was appropriate as most of those dismissed knew of Flowers and his family and thus would be biased on a jury. Thomas‚Äô opinion suggests Batson v. Kentucky (1986), which forbids prosecutors from using race as a factor in making peremptory challenges in jury selection, was wrongly decided and should be overruled. Gorsuch, however, did not join the section of Thomas‚Äô opinion suggesting Batson should be overruled. Subsequent events State prosecutors officially dropped the charges against Flowers on September 4, 2020, with the state's attorney general's office stating that it would be nearly impossible to convict Flowers on any charges at this point due to the conflicts with the past court records being considered unusable leaving them with no new living witnesses.

The club was founded in 1948 and its football department existed until 1953. Like other sports clubs affiliated with the Volkspolizei, it was incorporated into the SV Dynamo in 1953, and would be reformed as SG Dynamo Potsdam. Football department =History= The SG Volkspolizei Potsdam was founded in 1948 as a sports club for the Volkspolizei, the East German People's Police. It was part of the Sports Association Sportvereinigung Deutsche Volkspolizei, the SV Deutsche Volkspolizei. The football team began to play in the Landesklasse Brandenburg in 1948, which at the time represented the top level of the East German football league system. It became one of the founding members of the second tier DDR-Liga in 1950. SG Volkspolizei Potsdam finished the inaugural 1950-51 DDR-Liga season as tied champions, but lost the deciding match and the qualification for the DDR-Oberliga against the tied team BSG Anker Wismar by 1‚Äì2. SG Volkspolizei Potsdam player Gerhard H√§nsicke became the top scorer of the 1950-51 DDR-Liga season with 18 goals. SG Volkspolizei Potsdam was severely weakened by player delegations and finished the 1951-52 season on seventh place. Five players had been delegated to Dresden in 1950, to help form the nucleus of SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden. Among the players delegated to Dresden were Herbert Schoen, Johannes Matzen and G√ºnter Schr√∂ter. All three would later become successful players in Dynamo Dresden and play internationally for the East Germany national football team. The SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden was formed as an ideologically acceptable side in replacement of SG Friedrichstadt. SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden would later be known as Dynamo Dresden. The team of SG Volkpolizei Potsdam was subsequently delegated to Berlin in March 1953. The team and the place in the DDR-Liga would be taken over by SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Berlin in the middle of the 1952-53 season. The sports association SV Deutsche Volkspolizei became SV Dynamo on 27 March 1953 and all sports clubs affiliated to SV Deutsche Volkspolizei became part of SV Dynamo. The football department of SG Volkspolizei Potsdam was then joined with SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Berlin as SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Berlin became SG Dynamo Berlin. The sports club itself would continue as SG Dynamo Potsdam, with departments in various sports, such as rowing, rugby, chess and athletics. Its department in rowing would become a designated center of excellence, which came to foster several Olympic gold medalists, such as J√∂rg Landvoigt and Bernd Landvoigt. =Stadium= The home ground of SG Volkspolizei Potsdam was the Ernst- Th√§lmann-Stadion in central Potsdam. The stadium was built in 1948-1949 and named after communist leader Ernst Th√§lmann, who was executed in Buchenwald in 1944. The stadium was build on the grounds of the Lustgarten, next to the adjoining Potsdam City Palance. The Lustgarten had been heavily damaged by air raids in World War II. The construction was carried out by members of the Volkspolizei, members of SG Volkspolizei Potsdam and volunteers. War debris from Potsdam was partially used for the building of the ramparts. The stadium had bleachers, a covered grandstand, technical facilities, a grass court and a 400 m cinder track. The stadium was the first major sports facility built in Germany after World war II. The Ernst-Th√§lmann-Stadion would later be used by SG Dynamo Potsdam and BSG Turbine Potsdam, and was the home ground of Potsdamer Kickers in the 1990s. The stadium was demolished in 1999, and the Lustgarten was rebuilt in 2001 in accordance with its historical shape. =Seasons= { class=\\"wikitable float-right\\" - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#dfdfdf\\" !

Clark, as an alternative to the more commonly used hydrazine monopropellant for use in spacecraft's attitude control and thruster systems. It was derived from an earlier, similar formulation which came to be called Cavea-A, which showed less promise due to its excessively high melting point. Once ignited it is highly energetic, achieving temperatures up to 5000¬∞ and thus a specific impulse of around 280https://archive.org/stream/nasa_techdoc_19730064061/19730064061_djvu.txt seconds. Cavea-B is considerably denser, more stablehttps://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/327866.pdf and less toxic than hydrazine, and offers a much superior performance than that of other relatively safe monopropellants such as cold thrusters. A drawback, however, is that using it is somewhat more complicated: Igniting Cavea-B involves mixing it with another substance, such as UDMH, with which it is hypergolic. Though once ignited the reaction is self-sustaining, it does require an additional substance to act as an starter. By comparison regular hydrazine simply commences its violent decomposition on contact with a catalyst bed or mesh of a metal such as iridium,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Hydrazine#section=Decomposition and thus can easily be stopped and started as many times as necessary. At the time it was considered beneficial to find a monopropellant whose decomposition was more energetic, and thus provided more thrust per unit mass, than the traditionally used hydrazine. This would mean that reaction control systems and thrusters for orbital maneuvers on spacecraft could be made lighter by requiring less reaction mass. This would permit, for the same amount of propellant, longer operation times on low earth orbit and for spacecraft intended to work on higher orbits, that a certain payload could be carried into those higher orbits by spacecraft that are lighter and thus cheaper to launch. Ultimately, however, Cavea-B and the high energy monopropellants that were researched alongside it were not adopted by NASA or other actors in the spacecraft industry, largely due to concerns about a self-sustaining reaction continuing into the propellant tank and detonating the contents. Hydrazine continues to be the most commonly utilized monopropellant in spacecraft as of 2019.

The company targets the British market with small quantities of distinctive wines including vintage-dated ports, late bottled vintage port (LBV), finest reserve and the wines known as \\"Churchill's Estates\\" which developed to include 10- and 20-year-old tawny ports. Origins Churchill's port ageing in small oak casks Churchill's Port was founded in 1981 by John (Johnny) Graham and his two brothers Anthony and William of the Graham's Port family who have produced wine from the Douro Valley for over 200 years. He arrived in Oporto in 1973 and since his family had sold their family port business to the Symington Family Estates three years earlier, he began his career in the port business by working for Cockburn's Port House, eventually becoming a director by the age of 28. Unable to use the family name, he founded a new company named \\"Churchill Graham, Lda\\", after his wife Caroline Churchill. It was the first Port company established for 50 years. He also worked for Taylor's and rented their lodge in Vila Nova de Gaia, where their port is stored. By 1999, sourcing the best grapes became a problem following the death of wine maker Borges de Sousa, who had given Churchill the first pick of grapes from their vineyards for almost 20 years. As a result, Churchill's looked to buy their own vineyard. Rather than look to the north bank of the Douro, where their previous grapes had been sourced, they purchased a 100-hectare property, Quinta da Gricha, on the south bank adjacent to Roriz in the Cima Corgo. They then bought the 12-hectare Quinto do Rio in the Torro valley. Range of wine Port ageing in a large wooden vat Eleven vintages have been declared since its first in 1982. Churchill's range includes vintage-dated ports and vintage port from the Quinto do Rio in the Torro valley, finest reserve, and the wines known as \\"Churchill's Estates\\" which developed to include 10 and 20-year old tawny ports. They also offer a white port. Production To avoid the bitterness of broken pips, they use traditional methods of production, such as grape treading with feet. Natural fermentation is employed and in addition, they use only small amounts of brandy. Aimed at the British market, Churchill's have been noted for their small quantities of characteristic wines. Since its first year of production, Churchill's has declared 11 vintages. Other activities Johnny Graham's son Max, later founded Churchill's Port House, at 26 Greek Street, London.

Background  Porter was born in High Wycombe in 1981 and received an MA in History of Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Prior to his writing career, Porter managed the Chelsea branch of Daunt Books and won the Bookseller of the Year Award in 2009. He was Editorial Director at Granta and Portobello Books until 2019.  Works  Grief is the Thing with Feathers is a hybrid of prose and poetic styles about a crow who visits a grieving family of a Ted Hughes scholar and his two young boys. It draws heavily upon Hughes's Crow: From the Life and Songs of Crow and its title is derived from Emily Dickinson's \\"Hope is the thing with feathers\\". In 2016, Grief won the Sunday Times PFD Young Writer of the Year Award, the Books Are My Bag Readers' Award for fiction, and the International Dylan Thomas Prize. It has also been shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award and the Goldsmiths Prize for experimental writing. Reviewing for The Guardian, Sarah Crown writes that the book \\"is heartrending, blackly funny, deeply resonant, a perfect summation of what it means to lose someone but still to love the world ‚Äì and if it reminds publishers that the best books aren‚Äôt always the ones that can be pigeonholed or precised or neatly packaged, so much the better\\". It has been translated into twenty-seven languages. Grief is the Thing with Feathers was adapted into a play of the same name, directed by Enda Walsh and starring Cillian Murphy, which premiered in Dublin on 25 March 2019 and has been performed in London and New York. In an interview, Porter details the experience of adapting Grief for the stage: \\"[w]ith both Cillian and Enda, the goal was to make the production as true as it could be to the book. There were no changed endings or swapping one feature for another\\". Cillian Murphy won an Irish Times Theatre Award for \\"Best Actor\\" for his performance as the grieving father. The play was a New York Times Critic's Pick, with Ben Brantley writing that the performance \\"beautifully evoke[s] the way in which the whole world seems apocalyptic after a personal tragedy\\". On 5 March 2019, Porter's second book Lanny was published by Faber and longlisted for the Wainwright Prize 2019 and Man Booker Prize 2019, and has shortlisted for the Gordon Burn Prize 2019. Faber describe Lanny as \\"a story about a family whose village is peopled by the living and the dead. It‚Äôs a story about a boy with a gift for friendship and the traces of enchantment he leaves in the closely woven lives around him\\". The book examines rural English community life and childhood myth in response to social division and ecological crisis. The book is set to be adapted into a film starring Rachel Weisz.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 28, 2019. It was written by Steven Davis and directed by Tyree Dillihay; its guest voices are David Herman as Mr. Frond and an announcer, John Michael Higgins as Doug Wheeler, David Wain as Courtney Wheeler, Brian Huskey as Regular Sized Rudy and a costumer, and Thomas Middleditch as Alex Papasian. In this episode, the Wagstaff School students participate in a mandatory mile run while some of them escape from it on bicycles to get free ice cream. Meanwhile, Bob and Linda try to get discount tickets for the Wharf Art Center.  Plot  At school, it is announced that all students of grades four to eight have to participate in a mile run on Friday which is also free ice cream day at a local parlor. Louise Belcher (Kristen Schaal) comes up with a plan to cut the run by bike riding to the ice cream shop. Courtney Wheeler has the idea of tracking the slowest runner ‚Äì Large Tommy ‚Äì by using a cat's collar with a built-in GPS tracker and an app on her cell phone. Louise, her brother Gene (Eugene Mirman), Regular Sized Rudy, Courtney and Alex Papasian agree to hide their bikes in some bushes near the school building. On Friday, the five children bike ride to school and stash their bicycles. They put the collar in Tommy's hydration pack before starting to run. Once out of sight of the teachers, they fetch their bikes and ride to the ice cream parlor. Mr Frond spots Gene after his bike chain comes off, and makes Gene run the whole mile next to Large Tommy. Louise, Rudy, Alex and Courtney arrive at the ice cream shop and get one free cone each. Louise decides to give Gene a cone made of their leftovers and carries it while they are riding back. After she gives her brother his cone, Courtney's father Doug stops him and Tommy because he located the collar and thinks his cat is in Tommy's backpack. Courtney convinces him that the cat is at home but Mr. Frond catches the four cycling students and says that they actually have to run the full mile on Saturday while Gene and Tommy finish their run. At the restaurant, Bob (H. Jon Benjamin) and his wife Linda (John Roberts) call the Wharf Art Center in order to buy discount tickets for a show named Cake 2. Their regular customer Teddy (Larry Murphy) tries to help them and later manages to get two tickets.  Reception  Alasdair Wilkins from the A.V. Club marked the episode with a \\"B+\\", saying it works well \\"that Gene doesn‚Äôt really make any choices once Mr. Frond catches him and forces him back into the race. He‚Äôs got to run, so he runs, and he would have stopped if Large Tommy hadn‚Äôt convinced him that stopping at all would spell catastrophe. He does absolutely end up deciding for himself that he wants to finish the race, but this isn‚Äôt something the episode has to dig deep inside Gene to justify. Instead, he just goes with the flow long enough that he then realizes he wants to keep doing it, even if that means delaying ice cream or getting back up after Mr. Wheeler stood in his and Tommy‚Äôs way or just generally trying hard at something for once.\\" He also wrote that \\"one of the basic building blocks of comedy is surprise. It‚Äôs not easy for Bob‚Äôs Burgers to manage that so deep into its run, but this is where all the subtle tweaks to the established status quo offer great little opportunities for gags. Louise is still riding an adult‚Äôs bike at long last, and she‚Äôs still way too self-consciously proud of her every little accomplishment, to the point that even Rudy comments on it.\\" Steven Davis received a nomination for the Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 72nd Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode.

She is the Scientific Director of the Intramural Research Program at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. She was a professor and epidemiologist at University of California, San Francisco.  Education  N√°poles completed a bachelor of arts at Pomona College. She obtained her Ph.D. and M.P.H. degrees from the University of California, Berkeley.  Career  Beginning in 2001, N√°poles was a Professor and behavioral epidemiologist in the Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) for 27 years, where she served as the Director of the UCSF Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC). CADC is an NIA-funded Resource Center for Minority Aging Research that provides pilot study funding and intensive mentoring to underrepresented early stage investigators focused on aging, minorities, and health disparities. She taught health disparities research methods for over 10 years. She assumed the position of Scientific Director of the Intramural Research Program at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) in November 2017. She is the first Latina named to the position at the National Institutes of Health.  Research  N√°poles' research program has focused on eliminating health inequalities related to cancer treatment and survivorship, self-care behaviors and physician-patient communication. Her goal is to develop effective socio-behavioral interventions to address these disparities, while contributing to the advancement of scientific methods for their study. Much of her work has utilized community- based participatory research methods to maximize the relevance and utility of her research for end-users. She uses integrated quantitative and qualitative (mixed) research methods to explore mechanisms of health disparities and develop measures and interventions. Her research falls into three interrelated categories: 1) cancer control in underserved populations; 2) interpersonal processes of care; and 3) health disparities research methods. She has published over 75 journal articles. = Cancer control research in underserved populations = N√°poles' work in this area has spanned the cancer care continuum, studying disparities in relevant lifestyle factors, utilization of cancer early detection examinations, treatment disparities, and survivorship. Working with multiple community groups, she has developed a program of research on cancer survivorship among Latinos and other low-income groups. This work has identified a sense of self-efficacy in managing one's cancer, spirituality, and family support as important protective factors among Latina breast cancer survivors. This work has included community-based RCTs of a peer-delivered cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention they developed for urban and rural Latinas with breast cancer called Nuevo Amanecer that improved quality of life and reduced depressive and somatic symptoms. She is developing and testing mHealth plus health coaching interventions to improve symptom management among ethnically diverse, low-income cancer survivors through cognitive-behavioral stress management, physical activity, and survivorship care planning. Her work in this area contributes to addressing ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in cancer survivorship, a grossly understudied area of research. = Interpersonal processes of care (IPC) in diverse populations = She co-developed a conceptual framework and patient survey to assess the quality of the IPC that includes the perspectives of diverse patients. This work is facilitating studies of associations between IPC and disparities in technical processes and outcomes of health care. She expanded this work by developing a conceptual framework and measures of clinicians' cultural sensitivity and has developed clinician-reported measures of the quality of interpretation that were used to compare various modes of language interpretation. She developed new measures of patient-reported quality of communication related to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and found that these scales, which assessed clinicians' explanations of CRC risks and screening tests, elicitation of patients' CRC screening barriers, and responsiveness to patients' CRC screening concerns, were associated positively with colorectal cancer screening among Latino general medicine patients. She analyzed audio-taped encounters of limited English-proficient patients and their clinicians to assess the extent and clinical significance of errors in interpretation and found that errors occur frequently in these encounters, and more often in ad-hoc than professional in-person and professional video- conferencing interpreted visits. These studies have expanded our measures of patient-centered care (one of the six domains of quality of care identified by the Institute of Medicine), and suggest interventions to reduce ethnic disparities in health care processes and outcomes. = Health disparities research measures and methods = Her work seeks to advance research methods for effective engagement of ethnically diverse communities in clinical research, including translation of evidence-based behavioral interventions in diverse communities. These studies address the effectiveness of recruitment and retention methods, measurement issues when comparing self-reported health measures across and within diverse ethnic groups, development of new survey measures to test mechanisms that might explain disparities, and critical reviews of methods for translation of evidence-based programs into ethnically diverse communities. These articles constitute important methodological resources for health disparities researchers.

The song is featured in the motion picture Widows directed by Steve McQueen (director) and centered on four women forced to pull off a robbery to pay a large criminal debt left behind by their late husbands. The film, which was adapted from the UK crime series of the same name, stars Viola Davis, Daniel Kaluuya, and Robert Duvall. Along with the songs by Sade and Nina Simone (\\"Wild Is the Wind\\"), the official soundtrack to Widows features an original score written by Hans Zimmer. Background The song is Sade's second soundtrack contribution in 2018. Earlier that year, her song \\"Flower of the Universe\\" appeared in the Disney film A Wrinkle in Time. That track marked the singer's first new song since 2011. According to a press release, director Steve McQueen had conversations with Sade about the movie and asked her to write a song about \\"loss and survival\\". In his interview to Los Angeles Times he stated that \\"Sade is an incomparable talent and incredible artist who so rarely releases new material, but luckily the original series of Widows had deeply resonated with her.‚Äù Reception Chris DeVille of Stereogum commented \\"The Big Unknown\\" [...] is a song that puts Sade‚Äôs myriad imitators to shame ‚Äî a minor-key ballad that manages to land some heavy emotional blows despite its impeccably tasteful lite production.\\" Lars Gotrich of NPR wrote \\"But as Sade does, \\"The Big Unknown\\" bottles a sadness that is both overwhelming and resolute, determined to make the world right, but understands that grief forever breaks our bodies and souls.\\" RJ Frometa of Vents Magazine mentioned \\"Commanding high praise from all genres of the global musical landscape, Sade continues to redefine and remain culturally relevant.\\" Dominiq Robinson of AXS noted \\"[The song] radiates melancholy vibes as Sade's warm voice floats over slow-tempo piano chords and heavy bass. The drums appropriately take a backseat to the vocal and melody tracks allowing Sade to emote the somber lyrical content of one attempting to withdraw themselves from slipping into the depths of depression and mental anguish. The song intensifies throughout the chorus, with the help of clashing of cymbals, string progressions, electric guitar harmonies, and punchy piano melodies. Towards the end of the track, Sade displays her vocal range bringing the song to a beautiful climax before it ultimately ends back in a bleak atmosphere.\\" Track listing References External links * Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Sade (band) songs Category:Songs written by Sade Adu Category:2010s ballads Category:Soul ballads ","title":"The Big Unknown"},{"id":"61099790","text":"Lampersdorf may refer to the following places: *in the Czech Republic: **Lampersdorf, the German name for Lampertice, a village in Trutnov District *in Poland: **Lampersdorf, the German name for Grodziszcze, ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie County, a village in ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie County **Lampersdorf, the German name for Zabor√≥w, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, a village in Lubin County ","title":"Lampersdorf"},{"id":"61099797","text":"Edwin Merrill \\"Ned\\" Cushing (September 7, 1830 - December 7, 1903) was a musician, auctioneer, and coroner in Staunton, Virginia.

Description The book documents how teachers tend to stop students from enjoying reading by mainly focusing on tests. Gallagher believes that students should be both readers and critical thinkers of what they are reading. However, Gallagher criticizes both extremes of the approaches to teaching reading. The term readicide is defined as the \\"systematic killing of the love of reading, often exacerbated by the inane, mind-numbing practices found in our schools.\\" A large portion of the book details how Gallagher teaches the activity of reading to his students.

History  The protests began on June 20, 2019, in front of the Parliament of Georgia. The protests launched after Sergei Gavrilov (Russian: –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ì–∞–≤—Ä–∏–ª–æ–≤), a Communist Party member of the Russian Duma who was visiting through the Interparliamentary Assembly on Orthodoxy, sat in a chair reserved by protocol for the Head of Parliament. He delivered a speech in Russian extolling the Orthodox brotherhood of Georgia and Russia. Earlier that week, Gavrilov had voted in favor of the independence of Abkhazia. Following Gavrilov's actions, the Georgian opposition, mainly members of the European Georgia and United National Movement, blocked the speaker and called for protests that demanded the government's resignation. As night fell, Georgian law enforcement used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters. Approximately 240 demonstrators were injured during the clashes with police and 305 protesters were arrested. At least two people experienced eye injuries and loss of vision due to rubber bullets, according to Giorgi Kordzakhiya, director of Tbilisi's New Hospital. The government accused protesters of attempting to storm the parliament building. Protests continued on next days demanding the resignation of government officials responsible for police actions, including the MIA of Georgia Giorgi Gakharia, and introduction of fully proportional election system instead of the existing semi-proportional. Protests calmed down after on June 24 the head of the ruling Georgian Dream Party, Bidzina Ivanishvili, partly satisfied demands of protesters by announcing a change to the electoral system. However, minor protests continued demanding the resignation of Giorgi Gakharia. Major protests renewed on November 13 after the Georgian Dream failed the promised electoral reform. On November 18, 20,000 people gathered in the center of Tbilisi demanding the resignation of government. Protesters blocked entrance to parliament and prevented legislative session from taking place. Riot police dispersed protests using water cannon, resulting in injury of 4 protesters and 2 policemen. On November 25 police had to use water cannon again in order to clear the parliament entrance, leaving 3 protesters heavily injured.  Results Following the protests of June 20‚Äì21, 2019, Irakli Kobakhidze, Georgia's Chairman of Parliament, announced his resignation. After mass demonstrations on June 24 in Tbilisi, the head of the ruling Georgian Dream Party, Bidzina Ivanishvili, announced a change to the electoral system from a mixed to proportional representation for the 2020 elections and lowering the vote barrier for parties. United National Movement MP Nika Melia was released on bail he was charged with organizing, managing or participating in group violence, during the protests. Reactions Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree to suspend passenger flights carrying Russian citizens from Russia to Georgia, effective July 8. Russia's Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-being increased quality controls on Georgian wine and mineral water, seen as linked to the escalation in tensions. President Salome Zourabichvili shortened her visit to Belarus to attend the opening ceremony of the 2019 European Games and to meet with President Alexander Lukashenko following the beginning of the protests. In an interview with Euronews, Zourabichvili called for a \\"de-escalation\\" in the situation while also blaming Russia for stirring up a \\"fifth column\\" in the country that is loyal to Moscow. Russian Prime Minister Dimitry Medvedev denied these claims by saying it is a \\"distortion of reality\\".https://www.euronews.com/2019/06/22/georgia-s-president-calls-for-de- escalation-after-unrest Zourabichvili also called on Russian tourists affected by the travel ban to keep coming to Georgia because \\"They love Georgia\\" and that \\"politicians must solve the problems\\". Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized her remarks as \\"ultra-extremist\\" in a statement on June 25. On June 26, Nika Melia, an opposition leader was charged with organizing and inciting group violence. In July 2019, Russia denounced an expletive-laden attack on Vladimir Putin by Georgian TV host Giorgi Gabunia during a broadcast on Rustavi 2. On 8 September, Giorgi Gakharia became Prime Minister of Georgia. Between 14 and 25 November several Georgian dream MPs left the party, including 3 Conservative Party members consisting of: Zviad Dzidziguri, Gia Bukia and Nino Goguadze, Paata Kvijinadze remained in Georgian Dream however didn't leave the Conservatives, while Ruslan Gajiev defected to the Green Party and Mukhran Vakhtangadze to Georgian Dream proper. other MPs who left the party were: 1 member of the Green Party - Giorgi Begadze, along with 9 others, including ‚Äì Tamar Chugoshvili, Tamar Khulordava, Mariam Jashi, Irina Pruidze, Dimitri Tskitishvili, Zaza Khutsishvili, Giorgi Mosidze, and Sofio Katsarava.
