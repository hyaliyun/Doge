They are associated with Edexcel GCSE. Types of strategies * Forum Theatre - The actors either create a planned improvisation or create a piece spontaneously, as it is performed the audience can either stop the action to suggest changes or take over from the actors on stage to change the direction of the performance. Quite often this is used as an exploration tool rather than as a piece of theatre for performance. A theme or key moment/decision can be explored to its fullest. *Thought Tracking - Whilst in role, the character speaks out to the audience about what that character is thinking, feeling, doing etc. *Still Image - Also known as a \\"freeze frame\\" or \\"tableau\\" or \\"snapshot\\" or \\"qais\\", this is when all the characters on stage stop still. Can be used if a narrator wishes to speak to the audience whilst something is happening on stage. *Hot Seating - A character is interrogated by the audience. Normally used as an \\"in class\\" activity, this allows the audience to find things out about a character, and requires the actor playing the character to think about what he/she is doing, feeling, etc. *Cross Cutting - When time in a scene changes to show what happens before or after a scene. *Narrating - A character, normally called the \\"Narrator\\", will speak out to the audience about what is going on in the plot *Marking the moment - Key moments in the performance are highlighted either through a freeze frame, or a change in light or some sound by using slow motion, noises etc.. *Role-play - A role-play is what you do when you're pretending to be another person and using your imagination to speak, think and even feel like that character. http://www.edexcel.com/quals/gcse/gcse09/drama/Pages/default.aspx.iliketrains.pleasedonthurtmeagain See also * Acting * Alternative theatre * Black light theatre * Culinary theatre * Illusionistic tradition * List of theatre personnel External links  References  Category:Drama ","title":"Explorative strategies"},{"id":"11568844","text":"Rev.

After 19 years with the Dodgers, Scherger joined the Cincinnati Reds organization in 1967. He managed the Florida State League's Tampa Tarpons and the Reds' Florida Instructional League team in both 1967 and 1968. Cincinnati farm director Sheldon \\"Chief\\" Bender placed Scherger in charge of their minor league spring training camp in 1969. During the season, he led their rookie-level Gulf Coast League Reds and continued to lead the winter league team as well. When Sparky Anderson, a former teammate of Scherger, was named manager of the Reds for the 1970 season, Scherger was hired as bench coach. He continued with Cincinnati under Anderson for nine years, later serving as first base coach and at third. During that time, Cincinnati won five National League West Division titles, four National League pennants, and two World Series. Reds general manager Dick Wagner dismissed the entire coaching staff after the 1978 season. Scherger was then assigned to the Double-A Nashville Sounds of the Southern League. He led the team to win the league championship and was selected to coach the 1979 Southern League All-Star team. He returned to Class A Tampa in 1980, and led the Double-A Waterbury Reds of the Eastern League in 1981. In 1982, he managed the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians of the American Association. The Indians won the championship, and Scherger won the Sporting News Minor League Manager of the Year Award. Scherger joined the Reds' major league staff after the 1982 season. He continued as bench coach for manager Russ Nixon for four years until retiring after the 1986 season. He was described by former Reds' star and manager Pete Rose as the \\"smartest baseball mind in the world\\". He briefly returned to manage Nashville, now at Triple-A in the American Association, in 1988, but retired for good after only one game.

This book, like the other books that Palin wrote following each of his seven trips for the BBC, consists both of his text and of many photographs to illustrate the trip. All of the pictures in this book were taken by Basil Pao, the stills photographer who was part of the team who did the trip (Basil Pao also produced a book, Inside Sahara, containing many more of his pictures). This trip involved traveling all around and through the Sahara Desert, starting and ending at Gibraltar. The book contains 13 chapters: Gibraltar, Morocco, Algeria, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Niger, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Gibraltar. The reason Algeria is featured three times is that the trip first cut through part of western Algeria, then later up through south, central and eastern Algeria, and finally on the return trip followed the Mediterranean coast of northern Algeria. Some of these countries are huge; for example, Algeria is four times the size of France or three times the size of Texas. The Sahara Desert is roughly the same size as the United States, and the trip covered 10,000 miles (16,000 km.) and took three months. The book is presented in a diary format; Palin starts each section of the book with a heading like \\"Day Forty-Two: Djenne\\". However, not all days are mentioned, a result of this trip being broken up into shorter trips, a fact that is not mentioned in the TV programme.  Audio edition  This book was released as an audio book, read by Palin himself, allowing the listener to hear his wit and charm, and his ability to do accents. Two versions of the audio book exist, an abridged version that lasts 6 hours and a difficult-to-find unabridged version that lasts 9 hours 52 minutes.

Married twice, she and her second husband founded the Gilbertine monastery of Chicksands in Bedfordshire.  Life  A daughter of Aubrey de Vere II and Adeliza de Clare, Rohese married twice. Her first husband, Geoffrey de Mandeville II, became Earl of Essex in 1140 and Rohese thereafter was styled countess. Earl Geoffrey rebelled against King Stephen late in 1143. Rohese's whereabouts during his rebellion are unknown; their eldest son seems to have been sent to Devizes, a stronghold of the supporters of the Empress Matilda, while their second son may have been sent to the court of the count of Flanders. When Earl Geoffrey died an excommunicate rebel in 1144, his widow remarried swiftly. Her second husband, Payn de Beauchamp, lord of Bedford, had opposed King Stephen in the 1130s. The couple founded a double monastery at Chicksands, Bedfordshire, for nuns and canons of the Gilbertine Order. They had one son, Simon de Beauchamp II. Countess Rohese was widowed a second time in 1155 or early 1156 and gained the guardianship of her minor son. When he was near his majority, Countess Rohese and Simon converted St. Paul's, Bedford, from a house of canons secular to one of regular canons and moved them to Newnham, Bedfordshire.Victoria County History: Bedfordshire, v. 1, 378 n.7. According to the Walden Chronicle, when the countess's eldest son, Geoffrey de Mandeville III, earl of Essex, died in 1166, his men decided to take his body for burial at Walden Priory in Essex, founded by his father. Countess Rohese was at Chicksands Priory when a member of the entourage escorting the earl's body arrived to inform her of her son's death. He suggested that she send knights to seize the earl's body for burial at Chicksands.\\"Book of the Foundation of Walden Abbey\\", ed. D. Greenway and L.Watkiss (Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1999), pp. 38-41. The countess rejected that suggestion, but when she later attended her son's funeral at Walden, she seized altar goods and other objects that her son had donated to Walden and gave them instead to Chicksands.\\"Book of the Foundation of Walden Abbey\\", pp. 44-47. The countess almost certainly spent the remainder of her life at Chicksands Priory. She witnessed a charter of her son Earl William in 1170, the last evidence of her life which can be dated, and when she died she was buried in the Chicksands chapter house and honored as the priory's foundress.John Leland, Itinerary vol. 5, 150 Rohese, countess of Essex, is sometimes confused with another, contemporary 'Countess Rohese,' who was the wife of Gilbert de Gant, Earl of Lincoln.

It is a registered trademark of CrossFit, Inc., which was founded by Glassman and Lauren Jenai in 2000. CrossFit is promoted as both a physical exercise philosophy and a competitive fitness sport, incorporating elements from high-intensity interval training, Olympic weightlifting, plyometrics, powerlifting, gymnastics, girevoy sport, calisthenics, strongman, and other exercises. It is practiced by members of thousands of affiliated gyms, roughly half of which are located in the United States, and by individuals who complete daily workouts (otherwise known as \\"WODs\\" or \\"workouts of the day\\"). CrossFit has been criticized for allegedly causing people to suffer from unnecessary injuries and exertional rhabdomyolysis, a possible life- threatening breakdown of muscle from extreme exertion. History Greg Glassman and Lauren Jenai founded CrossFit, Inc. in 2000. The company was conceived a few years earlier in 1996 as Cross-Fit. The original CrossFit gym was in Santa Cruz, California, and the first affiliated gym was CrossFit North in Seattle, Washington; there were 13 by 2005, and in 2016 there were more than 13,000. Coaches associated with CrossFit include Louie Simmons, John Welbourn, and Bob Harper. Glassman obtained complete control over the company after a divorce with Jenai, who tried to sell her share in the company to an outside party after the divorce settlement, but Glassman bought it with a $16 million loan from Summit Partners. On June 24, 2020, following the outcry after Glassman's comments regarding the killing of George Floyd it was announced that he was selling the company to Eric Roza, a Colorado based CrossFit box owner and former CEO of Datalogix. Roza announced he would be assuming the role of CEO after the conclusion of the sale in July. Overview American kettlebell swing Kipping pull-up CrossFit is a strength, conditioning, and overall fitness program consisting mainly of a mix of aerobic exercise, calisthenics (body weight exercises), and Olympic weightlifting. CrossFit, Inc. describes its strength and conditioning program as \\"constantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity across broad time and modal domains,\\" CrossFit aims to develop fitness in what the company deems to be the ten components of physical fitness: cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance, accuracy. Hour-long classes at affiliated gyms, or \\"boxes\\", typically include a warm-up, a skill development segment, the high-intensity \\"workout of the day\\" (or WOD), and a period of individual or group stretching. Some gyms also often have a strength-focused movement prior to the WOD. Performance on each WOD is often scored and/or ranked to encourage competition and to track individual progress. Some affiliates offer additional classes, such as Olympic weightlifting, which are not centered around a WOD. CrossFit gyms use equipment from multiple disciplines, including barbells, dumbbells, gymnastics rings, rope climbs, pull-up bars, jump ropes, kettlebells, medicine balls, plyo boxes, resistance bands, rowing machines, and various mats. CrossFit is focused on \\"constantly varied, high-intensity, functional movement,\\" drawing on categories and exercises such as calisthenics, Olympic-style weightlifting, powerlifting, Strongman-type events, plyometrics, body weight exercises, indoor rowing, aerobic exercise, running, and swimming. CrossFit programming is decentralized, but its general methodology is used by thousands of private affiliated gyms, fire departments, law-enforcement agencies, and military organizations, including the Royal Danish Life Guards, as well as by some U.S. and Canadian high-school physical-education teachers, high-school and college sports teams, and the Miami Marlins. Alt URL A 2014 statistical analysis showed that 50% of CrossFit participants were male and 50% were female. CrossFit's growing interest internationally has created a spike in Olympic weightlifting interest in the United States. Business model CrossFit, Inc. licenses the CrossFit name to gyms for an annual fee and certifies trainers. Besides the standard two-day \\"Level 1 Trainer Course\\", specialty seminars include gymnastics, Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, running and endurance, rowing, kettlebells, mobility and recovery, CrossFit Kids, CrossFit Football, and self-defense and striking. Other specialized adaptations include programs for pregnant women, seniors, and military special operations candidates. Affiliates develop their own programming, pricing, and instructional methods. Many athletes and trainers see themselves as part of a contrarian, insurgent movement that questions conventional fitness wisdom. In addition to performing prescribed workouts, they follow CrossFit's nutrition recommendations, adopting a paleo and/or zone diet. CrossFit makes use of a virtual community Internet model. The company says this de-centralized approach shares some common features with open source software projects and allows best practices to emerge from a variety of approaches, a contention that is disputed by some competitors and former affiliates. , there are over 15,000 CrossFit affiliates in over 150 countries. CrossFit Games The \\"CrossFit Games\\", directed by Dave Castro, have been held every summer since 2007. Athletes at the Games compete in workouts they learn about only hours beforehand, sometimes including surprise elements that are not part of the typical CrossFit regimen. Past examples include a rough-water swim, a softball throw, and a pegboard climb. The Games are styled as a venue for determining the \\"Fittest on Earth,\\" where competitors should be \\"ready for anything.\\" In 2011, the Games adopted an online qualification format, facilitating participation by athletes worldwide. During the five-week-long \\"CrossFit Open\\", one new workout is released each week. Athletes have several days to complete the workout and submit their scores online, with either a video or validation by a CrossFit affiliate. Since the Open is available to any level of athlete, many affiliates encourage member participation and the number of worldwide participants can be in the hundreds of thousands. From 2011‚Äì18, the top CrossFit Open performers for individuals and teams in each region advance to the regional events, held over the following two months around the world. Each regional event qualifies a specified number of its top finishers to send to the Games. The Games include divisions for individuals of each gender, co- ed teams, and a number of Masters and Teenage age groups. Since 2019, regionals have been discontinued and individual athletes qualify by either being the national champion in the Open, finishing in the top 20 worldwide in the Open, winning a CrossFit-sanctioned event, or by invitation. In 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemic the Games format was significantly altered for 2020 CrossFit Games: the event is separated into two parts, with the first part consisting of a remote competition that included 60 athletes: the top 20 women and top 20 men from the Open leaderboard, along with the 10 women‚Äôs and 10 men‚Äôs qualifiers from Sanctionals. The top five finishers (both for male and female competition) will participate in a final in-person event in Aromas, California, scheduled for October 19 through October 25. For the 2020 event there were no teams, masters, or teens events.https://games.crossfit.com/article/two-stage-format- announced-2020-crossfit-games/games 2020 CrossFit Games Announces New Online + In-Person Format  Certifications  There are four levels of CrossFit coach certification. To open a CrossFit affiliated gym, it only requires a coach to be certified to level one. Level One (CF-L1) is the introduction level, where participants attend a group weekend class, talk about the basic methodology and fundamentals of CrossFit, and learn how to conduct their own classes. They go over techniques and how to adjust them for those who cannot perform them. After completing the Level One training course, one should be confident in conducting a class, scale workouts accordingly for athletes, and hold CrossFit to its standards. In the second level, training goes deeper into the mechanics of the movements and how to be leaders and communicate with other students. In the Level Two course, participants learn about athletic capacity and are evaluated as a trainer in groups. To earn the Level Three certificate, a coach one must complete 1,500 hours of active fitness coaching and become CPR certified. To maintain the certification, Level 3 coaches must obtain 50 continuing education units every three years. To earn the Level Four certificate, the highest level currently recognized by CrossFit, Inc., the coach must record several years as a Level Three and pass a test.  Criticism  =Injury= The risk of injury associated with CrossFit training has been a controversial question since the program's popularity began to climb in the early 2000s. Critics have accused CrossFit, Inc. of using dangerous movements and inappropriate levels of intensity, and allowing underqualified individuals to become CrossFit Trainers. In response to these criticisms, CrossFit, Inc. claims, ‚ÄúCrossFit is relatively safe even when performed with poor technique, but it is safer and more effective when performed with good technique.‚Äù CrossFit, Inc. also claims the risk of injury can be reduced by properly scaling and modifying workouts, a concept taught on its website and at the CrossFit Level 1 Trainer Course. CrossFit supports this position by citing three academic surveys of CrossFit participants. These surveys calculated injury rates between 2.4 and 3.1 injuries per 1000 hours of training, which CrossFit argues is consistent with or below injury rates found in \\"general fitness training.\\" A study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research entitled \\"Crossfit-based high intensity power training improves maximal aerobic fitness and body composition\\" followed 54 participants for 10 weeks of CrossFit training. The study said that \\"...a notable percentage of our subjects (16%) did not complete the training program and return for follow-up testing.\\" \\"The authors said \\"This may call into question the risk-benefit ratio for such extreme training programs...\\" Out of the \\"10 of the 11 participants who did not complete the study have provided their reasons for not finishing, with only 2 mentioning injury or health conditions that prevented them from completing follow-up testing.\\" =Lawsuit by Cross Fit, Inc. against the NSCA= In 2014, CrossFit, Inc. filed a lawsuit against the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) for publishing this study, alleging the data was false and \\"intended to scare participants away from CrossFit.\\" The NSCA denies CrossFit, Inc.'s allegations but issued an erratum acknowledging that the injury data were incorrect. In September 2016, the District Court ruled in favor of CrossFit Inc.'s claims that the injury data were found to be false, but not that the NSCA was commercially motivated or that the publishing of the study was defamatory as the NSCA no longer stood behind the study. In February 2017, CrossFit filed for sanctions against the NSCA after one of the NSCA's witnesses admitted to falsifying statements during deposition. In May 2017, the Court issued 17 issues sanctions against the NSCA, writing that the organization did have a commercial motive to falsify the data, had published the false data knowingly to disparage CrossFit, and had misled the public with their erratum. CrossFit was awarded $74,000 in legal fees and allowed to continue investigating the NSCA. If the neutral-party analysis of the NSCA servers turns up any further misconduct, CrossFit may file an amended complaint for further sanctioning and compensation for lost revenue. In May 2019, CrossFit, Inc. contacted the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine with a demand for the retraction of another paper, published in the journal earlier that month. The paper states that CrossFit participants ‚Äúare more likely to be injured and to seek medical treatment compared with participants in traditional weightlifting‚Äù, a finding that CrossFit, Inc. claimed to be based on scientific errors and material from retracted or mis-represented studies. =Exertional rhabdomyolysis= The relationship between CrossFit and exertional rhabdomyolysis has been a subject of controversy for the company. Some medical professionals have asserted that both the CrossFit methodology and the environment created by CrossFit trainers put athletes at high risk for developing rhabdomyolysis. A man successfully sued his uncertified CrossFit trainers and was awarded US$300,000 in damages, after he suffered from rhabdomyolysis after performing a CrossFit workout on December 11, 2005, at Manassas World Gym in Manassas, Virginia, under the said trainers' supervision. CrossFit, Inc. was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit. CrossFit, Inc. does not dispute that its methodology has the potential to cause rhabdomyolysis. The company states that exertional rhabdomyolysis can be found in a wide variety of sports and training populations and argues that its critics have conflated CrossFit's high awareness of rhabdomyolysis with high risk. One CrossFit spokesman stated that \\"ESPN's report on the 53 deaths in US triathlons from 2007 to 2013 should have put the issue to rest.\\" Since May 2005, CrossFit, Inc. has published several articles about rhabdomyolysis in the company's CrossFit Journal. Three of the articles are included in the CrossFit Manual provided to all prospective trainers. CrossFit, Inc. has also been criticized for having a \\"cavalier\\" attitude towards rhabdomyolysis by promoting a character known as \\"Uncle Rhabdo\\" (a cartoon clown dying in a dramatic fashion‚Äîhooked up to a dialysis machine, with his kidneys and intestines falling on the floor). In response to this criticism, Greg Glassman stated \\"We introduced (Uncle) Rhabdo because we're honest and believe that full disclosure of risk is the only ethical thing to do.\\" = Social media controversies = CrossFit, Inc. has been variously criticized and praised for its unorthodox approach to social media. This approach has included publishing articles and tweets about non-fitness topics (including politics, philosophy, and poetry) as well as directly interacting with other social media users and critics of the company's program. On June 4, 2014, CrossFit uploaded a \\"parody video to their Facebook page\\" of Jesus, featuring concepts such as the \\"Holy Trinity of exercise\\". Yasmine Hafiz wrote in The Huffington Post that some \\"viewers are outraged at the disrespectful use of a Christian symbol\\", with one user asking \\"on what planet is it comical or encouraged to mock someones belief?\\" In June 2018, CrossFit fired its chief knowledge officer, Russell Berger, after Berger disparaged the LGBT community on Twitter. Berger's tweet followed the closure of a CrossFit location in Indianapolis due to the backlash it faced after cancelling a special LGBT Pride Month workout. Berger wrote on Twitter \\"As someone who personally believes celebrating \\"pride\\" is a sin, I'd like to personally encourage #CrossFitInfiltrate for standing by their convictions and refusing to host an @indypride workout. The intolerance of the LGBTQ ideology toward any alternative views is mind-blowing.\\" The tweet triggered angry responses denouncing Berger as a bigot and pressuring CEO Glassman for him to be fired; Berger was first placed on unpaid leave, but was later fired by Glassman, who publicly condemned Berger. In May 2019, CrossFit shuttered its Facebook and Instagram accounts, which had 3.1 million and 2.8 million followers respectively. On the company's homepage, the announcement stated that CrossFit was concerned about user privacy and security in the wake of \\"well-known public complaints about the social-media company that may adversely impact the security and privacy of our global CrossFit community.\\" The company also cited theft of intellectual property and Facebook's collusion with \\"food and beverage industry interests\\" as reasons for deactivating its social media accounts. On June 6, 2020, the founder of CrossFit Greg Glassman tweeted, \\"It's: FLOYD-19\\" in response to a tweet from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington that states, \\"racism and discrimination are critical public health issues that demand an urgent response.\\" Glassman's tweet was widely panned; many CrossFit-affiliated gyms around the world responded by ending their affiliation, and Reebok also announced that they would end their corporate association. Glassman also hosted a criticized Zoom call with Crossfit gym owners where he propounded conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and claimed that George Floyd had been killed as part of an elaborate cover-up of counterfeiting unrelated to racism. On June 9, 2020, Glassman resigned as CEO then two weeks later announced he had put the company up for sale.

Worcestershire, was an English Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1726 to 1746. Biography Winnington was the second, but eldest surviving, son of Salwey Winnington of Stanford Court, Member of Parliament for Bewdley, and his wife Anne Foley, daughter of Thomas Foley, MP, of Witley Court, Worcestershire. He was grandson of Sir Francis Winnington, who had been Solicitor General in the 1670s. He was educated at Westminster School and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1713. He was admitted to Middle Temple in 1714. Winnington entered Parliament at a by-election on 31 January 1726 as a Tory Member of Parliament for Droitwich, but very soon after became a Whig and supported the Administration. He was returned unopposed again in 1727 and 1734. At the 1741 returned for Droitwich and also elected in a contest for Worcester (a more prestigious constituency), and he chose to sit for Worcester in what turned out to be his last Parliament. A supporter of the Prime Minister Robert Walpole, Winnington was made a Lord of the Admiralty in 1730, and served as a Lord of the Treasury from 1736 to 1742; in 1741 he was made a Privy Counsellor and became Cofferer of the Household. When Henry Pelham became Prime Minister in 1743, he appointed Winnington Paymaster General of the Forces, the post he himself had held in the previous administration (although unlike Pelham, Winnington was not accorded a seat in the Cabinet); he held this post for the remaining two-and-a-half years of his life. Winnington purchased the shares of the elder sisters in the family estate of Stanford (which his grandfather Sir Francis had acquired for the family through his second marriage), and in 1674 he bought the leasehold interest under the crown of the manor of Bewdley. Family In 1719, Winnington married Love Reade, daughter of Sir James Reade, Bt. of Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire. They had no children. Winnington became the lover of Etheldreda Townshend in 1742 and it was said that she was the one in charge. The Stanford Court estate subsequently passed to his cousin who became Sir Edward Winnington, 1st Baronet. The Elizabethan mansion of Stanford Court was burnt on 5 December 1882, and the valuable books and manuscripts in the old library were destroyed. cites Hist. MSS. Comm. 1st Rep. app. pp. 53‚Äì5. Stanford Court was rebuilt and remained the family seat until sold by Sir Francis Winnington, 6th Baronet in 1949.

It is divided into three zones that each have their own level of protection. * Zone-A, Integral Reserve - Fully closed for all disturbing activities, including scuba diving, bathing, fishing and shipping. Only scientific research, emergency services and trips organised by the management board are allowed in the area. * Zone-B, General Reserve - The zones directly surrounding the integral reserves. Most activities are allowed as long as they adhere some basic limitations; e.g. no motor sailing faster than five knots, no anchoring or mooring. Fishing activities are limited to residential fishing with line and rods. * Zone-C, Partial Reserve - The remainder of the reserve adheres mostly the same limitations as the general reserve but with a less stringent regime. Motor sailing is limited to ten knots. The Capo Rizzuto area encompasses roughly 13,500 hectares of open water, bordering 37 km of coastline.

He was the last moneyer of the Derby Mint and the principal founder of Derby School. Life Walkelin is believed to have been born in about 1135, the son of Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Earl of Derby and his wife, Margaret Peverel. In 1162, he married Goda de Toeni (born about 1141), the daughter and heiress of Robert de Toeni of Eggington in Derbyshire, and settled in the county. They had at least two children, Margery (born about 1165) and Isabel (born about 1172). According to some reports, Walkelin died in 1190 at the Siege of Acre, Jerusalem. Others place his death at Oakham Castle in Rutland, although this probably refers to his second cousin, Walkelin de Ferrers, the lord of Oakham. Derby School The ancient Derby School may have been first established by William de Barb√¢ Aprilis and Walter Durdant, Bishop of Lichfield, in the reign of Henry II.

Hosts and symptoms Sorghum field in Germany Peronosclerospora sorghi has a broad host range, particularly plants in the sorghum family. These host plants include Sorghum bicolor, or sorghum, Sorghum sudanense, or Sudan grass, and Sorghum palepense, or Johnsongrass. Its hosts also include Pinnisetum glaucum, or pearl millet, and Zea mays, or maize. When maize plants are infected as seedlings, the first symptom to appear is chlorosis of the leaves. As the plant grows, it often shows stunting, and necrotic lesions begin to form on the leaves. As the leaves continue to grow, a white, downy growth may develop in the necrotic lesions, especially on the underside of the leaves. This downy growth is the result of the production of conidia and conidiophores under the proper environmental conditions.Plantwise. Sorghum and maize express very similar symptoms. In sorghum, chlorosis of the seedlings is very common after infection. As the leaves get older, they can express white striping, which eventually leads to the necrosis of the white striped tissue. When the leaves die, they begin to become shredded in appearance, similar to hail damage. This symptom is associated with the production of oospores in the leaf tissue.A.S. Kutama, B.S. Aliyu, and A.M. Emechebe. A Survey of Sorghum Downy Mildew in Sorghum in the Sudanosahelian Savanna Zones of Nigeria. Bayero Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences, 2(2): 218-222. Dec, 2009 If sorghum plants are young and produce conidia on their leaves, this type of infection often leads to the death of the plant. If the sorghum plants are older, the pathogen will often produce oospores in the leaves. Plants are usually capable of surviving this type of infection and will survive until maturity. The disease may cause the tassels and ears of maize plants to develop improperly or not form at all. This also occurs within the panicle of the sorghum plant. Key factors in diagnosing downy mildew on maize and sorghum caused by Peronosclerospora sorghi include chlorosis of the leaves, followed by white streaking of the leaves. The leaves could also have a white, downy growth on the underside of the leaf blade. The white streaked areas of leaves become necrotic over time, leading to a shredded leaf appearance. In the maturing plant, the reproductive structures do not form properly or do not form at all. This leads to a sterile plant. Disease cycle Personosclerospora sorghi has a polycyclic disease cycle. It is capable of causing secondary infections of susceptible hosts throughout the growing season. Its resting structures, the structures that allow the pathogen to overwinter, are the oospores. These oospores are produced in the infected plants from the previous growing season. They are often disseminated by wind. The oospores can overwinter in the soil and in the debris on the surface of the soil. The oospores have very thick walls, which makes them capable of surviving in the soil for years under many different weather conditions.Richard A. Frederlksen. Sorghum Downy Mildew in the United States: Overview and Outlook. Plant Disease Vol. 64 No. 10. Oct, 1980. It is also possible for oospores and mycelium to overwinter in the seeds of maize. The mycelium infects the scutellum of the seed. The oospores and mycelium that are present in the seed often lose their viability when the seeds are dried, but under the right circumstances, it is possible for these infected seeds to become a source of inoculum, infecting the maize plant as it grows. Infection of the seed itself often occurs with the plant that produced the seed had been infected later in development.V.O. Adenle and K.F. Cardwell. Seed Transmission of Maize Downy Mildew (Peronosclerospora sorghi) in Nigeria. V.O. Adenle and K.F. Cardwell. Plant Pathology (2000) 49, 628-634. The oospores are the main source of the primary inoculum of this disease. They are present in the soil when the host seedlings are germinating. The oospores then infect the roots of the seedlings. This type of infection is a systemic infection of the plant. The pathogen grows throughout the plant, infecting the leaves as they grow, leading to chlorosis. The chlorotic leaves develop white streaks. These white streaks are the location of oospore production. This only occurs in plants that were systemically infected as a seedling. When the oospores become mature, the white streaks on the leaves turn brown and become necrotic. These necrotic areas become shredded over time, which is how the mature oospores are disseminated. The spores are carried by the wind, and they become the source of inoculum in subsequent generations.C.H. Bock, M.J. Jeger, B.D.L. Fitt, and J. Sherington. Effect of Wind on the Dispersal of Oospores of Peronosclerospora sorghi from sorghum. Plant Pathology (1997) 46, 439-449. As the pathogen continues to develop in the host plant, there may also be production of conidia on the leaf surface. It is the conidia and the conidiophores that cause the white, downy growth on the undersides of the leaves. Conidia develop quickly and are released from their conidiophores within five hours of maturation. After they are released, they are wind disseminated. If the conidia land on mature host plants, they infect and cause local lesions on the leaves. These lesions do not systemically infect the plants, and there is little overall damage from them. If the conidia land on a plant that is only a few weeks old or less, the plant is susceptible to systemic infection by the conidia. The conidia can be the main cause of the infection if they are being produced on a host plant that is in the same area as other susceptible host plants that are just emerging from the ground.C.H. Bock, M.J. Jeger, L.K. Mughogho, E. Mtisi, and K.F. Cardwell. Production of conidia by Peronoslcerospora sorghi on sorghum crops in Zimbabwe. Plant Pathology (1998) 47, 243-251. Environment Peronosclerospora sorghi requires warm temperatures and high humidity for it to prosper. Oospores are usually the primary inoculum, and they are found in the soil. The soil must be moist to ensure proper germination of the oospores. Soils that have had little tillage will often stay damp longer than highly tilled soils and harbor oospores in the rooting zone of the host plant, which leads to an increased chance of infection. If the same host is grown in the same area year after year, the oospores may continue to build up in the soil, providing more primary inoculum for every following year.CIMMYT. Maize Doctor. Sorghum Downy Mildew. http://maizedoctor.cimmyt.org/en/component/content/article/284-sorghum-downy- mildew. There may be production of conidia if the environment is suitable. Conidia are produced when there has been rain, because moisture is a key factor in their production. Rain or high humidity causes leaf wetness, which is the optimal environment for the pathogen to produce the conidia. A normal temperature range for production is 55-75 degrees Fahrenheit. If these conditions are present, there will be innumerable conidia disseminated by the wind. The conidia is a source of secondary inoculum. If susceptible plants are being grown in the same area as these infected plants, the disease can spread rapidly as the conidia infect the surrounding susceptible plants. Management A combination of chemical, genetic, and cultural methods are used to control sorghum downy mildew. A number of single-gene sources of resistance have been found, and many resistant varieties are commercially available. However, new pathotypes of the fungus continue to evolve to overcome different sources of host plant resistance.Frinking, et al. The Epidemiology, Variability And Control Of The Downy Mildews Of Pearl Millet And Sorghum, With Particular Reference To Africa. Plant Pathology 47.5 (1998): 544-569.Isakeit, T., and J. Jaster. Texas has a New Pathotype of Peronosclerospora Sorghi, the Cause of Sorghum Downy Mildew. Plant Disease 89.5 (2005): 529. Seed treatments with the systemic fungicides metalaxyl and mefenoxam have been widely used to prevent systemic infections of Sorghum Downy Mildew. Metalaxyl, which inhibits protein synthesis in the pathogen, can also be applied as a foliar spray. In Texas, use of these two fungicides, in conjunction with the use of resistant hybrids, made the disease a minor problem until one of the pathotypes endemic in the region evolved resistance to both chemicals. A variety of cultural controls are effective against sorghum downy mildew. In areas where oospores are the principal source of inoculum, such as in the United States, crop rotation is an effective strategy, as oospores will be stimulated to germinate by both host and non- host crops, but will not be able to infect plants apart from corn, sorghum, and Johnson grass. Flax (Linum usitatissimum) is an example of a trap crop that is used to reduce the amount of oospore inoculum in the soil, before planting a susceptible crop like sorghum or maize. Deep tillage also reduces the amount of oospores surviving in the soil and therefore the incidence of the disease. In areas where conidia are the principal source of inoculum, such as in most of the tropics, early planting can be effective in avoiding secondary infections. This is because an early crop will be able to avoid infection from conidia produced by later infected crops in the region. For inoculum that survives in seeds, drying to less than 20% moisture is effective in killing the pathogen. Importance Sorghum bicolor is one of the most important cereal crops around the world, ranking fifth in production behind corn, rice, wheat, and barley.FAOSTAT. ProdSTAT. A significant proportion is grown in developing countries in tropical and subtropical regions, where it is a staple for both human and animal consumption, as opposed to in the United States where it is overwhelmingly used for animal feed.Kamala, V., et al. Sources of Resistance to Downy Mildew in Wild and Weedy Sorghums. Crop Science 42.4 (2002): 1357-60. In many of the areas where sorghum is a staple crop, in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, access to agricultural technology is poor and yields are low as a result. This makes control of sorghum downy mildew especially important, as infections can dramatically reduce yield further. Peronosclerospora sorghi causes the most significant yield reduction in corn and sorghum when plants are infected systemically. Models from the United States have demonstrated a direct relationship between incidence of systemic infection and yield loss. Sorghum downy mildew has been reported in 44 countries. It is endemic in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where it causes severe reductions in corn and sorghum yield. In corn, losses due to the disease are estimated to range from 15-20% in Uganda, and epidemics have caused losses from 10 to 100% in Zaire.

Besides Ubick, it had a revolving membership while they performed as a backing band to Big Daddy Kane from 2008 to 2012. As a studio artist, Connie Price and the Keystones have released original recordings across three albums, two EPs and a number of singles.  Career  In 2004, Connie Price put out an EP, Blood's Haul, on the Stones Throw imprint Now Again with UK drummer Malcom Catto, and that same year the instrumental album Wildflowers was released featuring members of Funk Inc., Poets Of Rhythm and L.A. Carnival. A second EP, Sticks & Stones, was released in 2005, a collection of live performances, a b-side, and a dub remix of the first cut from the LP. Three years later, Connie Price and the Keystones put out the Tell Me Something album on Ubiquity Records, which featured guest appearances from Percee P, Ohmega Watts, Wildchild, Soup/Zaakir from Jurassic 5, Aloe Blacc and Freestyle Fellowship's Myka Nyne among others. From 2007 to 2009, Connie Price & the Keystones became one of two main backing bands on Scion's Live Metro series. In 2014, Connie Price and the Keystones digitally released four songs under the title \\"Lucas High EP\\", a tribute to Euro jazz-funk session man Doug Lucas, who helped create the sound for some rare studio instrumental bands and jazz-funk concept groups, including Chakachas, Superfunkydiscotheque, Plus, JJ Band, S.S.O. Orchestra, and Mombasa. The EP also featured Zach Lucas, son of the late jazz funk composer and trumpet player. Following the positive response to the Lucas High sound on the EP, producers Dan Ubick and Matt Fife remastered the original four tracks with Dave Cooley and expanded the session to a full LP release called Lucas High with seven new originals (A Man Called Horse Records). Lucas High featured a studio sound of CP&K;'s heavy hitting ensemble led by bandleader Dan Ubick, and accompanied by some of the most prolific artists from the golden age of hip hop, including Big Daddy Kane, Talib Kweli, Brand Nubian, M.O.P., Imani and Brown of The Pharcyde with DJ Rhettmatic, Soup and Marc 7 of Jurassic 5, Brother J of X-Clan, Wildchild of Lootpack, Llgl Tndr. This was along with a roster of powerful female artists including Macy Gray, Rapsody, the Lady of Rage, Nini Monore and Jovi Rockwell.

Ovulinia petal blight First reported in the 1930s on the Belgian-Indica hybrids, petal blight can attack most azaleas under favorable weather conditions. Infected flowers first exhibit small spots, about 1 mm in diameter, which appear water-soaked. The spots enlarge rapidly and become very slimy, causing entire petals to become slimy and limp, usually within 2‚Äì3 days after initial infection. Infected areas of flowers soon become tan or light brown, and eventually entire flowers turn prematurely brown. Infected flowers dry and generally cling to the plant longer than uninfected flowers do. One to 20 (commonly two to five) small, black sclerotia (a fungal resting stage) form on an infected flower 6‚Äì8 weeks later. They appear first as small white areas on the dried petals and slowly become dark as they mature. Caused by the Ovulinia azaleae fungus, the disease develops during periods of moist weather at flowering time. Early- and late-flowering cultivars or species tend to escape the disease. The fungus overwinters as sclerotia on diseased petals adhering to plants, on the soil surface, or in leaf mulch under the bushes. At the beginning of the host's blooming period, the sclerotia germinate and in 3‚Äì5 days give rise to small stalked, cup-shaped fruiting bodies filled with spore sacs, which are discharged with sufficient force that they strike the lower blooms above the sclerotia or are carried in air currents to nearby blooms on adjacent plants. The rate of infection is higher when periods of frequent precipitation and warm weather coincide with flowering. Heavy dew or extended periods of misty weather are particularly favorable. Low temperatures at the beginning of the flowering period and dry conditions toward the end of it most likely reduce the infection potential. Spraying the infested soil with fungicides and removal of the leaf litter beneath infected plants have not been reliable methods of disease control. Sprays applied at or just before bud opening have offered the best means of control. In general, sprays of triadimefon or benomyl applied at weekly intervals throughout the flowering period have controlled the blight and inhibited sclerotium formation. Making sure diseased or disease-carrying plants are not introduced into the growing area reduces the disease potential.http://azaleas.org/index.pl/azdiseasetext.html See also * List of azalea diseases * List of rhododendron diseases References Category:Fungal plant pathogens and diseases Category:Ornamental plant pathogens and diseases Category:Sclerotiniaceae Category:Fungi described in 1940 ","title":"Ovulinia azaleae"},{"id":"11569259","text":"Sclerotinia ricini is a plant pathogen infecting poinsettias.

Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK‚Äôs director, said that the awards recognise the \\"pivotal role of the UK media industry in informing and shaping public opinion\\" and pays tribute to their \\"often dangerous work\\". The awards acknowledge the creativity, skills and sheer determination that it takes to get the news out in an educational and engaging way. In particular, these awards highlight the unique relationship that exists between Amnesty International and the media. Sir Trevor McDonald explained the inextricably linked nature of this relationship: \\"Amnesty persists where journalism leaves off. We visit these scenes and then move on. Amnesty has the virtue of sticking with the story and making sure the truth comes out.\\"[3]  History  Amnesty International has always championed the importance of media in exposing human rights abuses. Amnesty itself began as a media story. In 1961, Peter Benenson, the founder of Amnesty, was so enraged that two Portuguese students were jailed for seven years for toasting to freedom during the autocratic regime of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, that he wrote a letter to The Observer. His \\"Appeal for Amnesty\\" letter called for the release of six political prisoners from around the world. It began: \\"Open your newspapers - any day of the week ‚Äì and you will find a report from somewhere in the world of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government. The newspaper readers feel a sickening sense of impotence. Yet if these feelings of disgust all over the world could be united into common action, something effective could be done\\" Amnesty began with a sentiment expressed through the media and to celebrate the unique relationship Amnesty shares with the media industry, the Amnesty International UK Media Awards were launched in 1992.  Purpose of the awards  Amnesty believes that by recognising excellence in human rights journalism, journalists and commissioners will be encouraged to increase the quality and quantity of their human rights coverage. Good quality media coverage is important as highlighted by Aung San Suu Kyi, Burmese pro-democracy leader, at the 2011 awards ceremony because it is \\"through the media that the rest of the world gets to hear about what we have to undergo\\".[53] In addition to honouring journalists, Lindsey Hilsum, the Channel 4 News International Editor who was the host of the 2014 awards, emphasises that the Amnesty Awards play a very important role in encouraging editors to allow journalists to cover more obscure stories that are far away and expensive. She said that when: ‚Äúyou point out that you won an Amnesty Award for a similar story a couple of years ago. It makes editors think that they will get some sort of kudos from this, and that it matters within the industry. So I think it‚Äôs tremendously important and I think Amnesty is doing a tremendous job by giving us these awards so that we can use them to say: ‚ÄòYes, we‚Äôve got to carry on reporting human rights, it really matters‚Äô.\\"[54] However, more specifically as pointed out by Amy Mackinnon, 2012 winner of the student award and a current journalist: \\"The Amnesty International UK awards are a heartening reminder that, in the right hands, journalism can be a potent force for good.\\"[50] Awards = Categories = Categories for the 2013 awards are: * TV News * Digital * Features * Photojournalism * National Newspapers * Radio * Nations & Regions * Gaby Rado Memorial Award * Documentaries * Student Human Rights Reporter =Gaby Rado Memorial Award= The Gaby Rado Memorial Award, first awarded in May 2004, recognizes a journalist who has been covering national or international human rights stories in broadcast or print media for less than five years. The award was established with the help of the family, friends and colleagues of the journalist Gaby Rado, who was found dead in Iraq in 2003. He had been the recipient of three Amnesty Media Awards: in 1996 for a series of reports on Bosnia/Srebrenica, 1998 for coverage of the Muslim minority Uighurs in north- western China and 2002 for his \\"moving account of the human cost of the atrocities committed in the Balkan Wars\\". =Student Human Rights Reporter Award= The Student Human Rights Reporter Award was started in 2010 and first awarded in 2011. Initially the award was run with The NUS (National Union of Students) and The Mirror newspaper. The award is now run in conjunction with the NUS, and The Observer. The award is open to students in further and higher education, with the prize allowing them to work with sponsors to develop real- world reporting and writing experience for two weeks. In 2013 the top prize was a fellowship with the US-based Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting and a $2,000 travel grant to cover an under-reported topic of ones choice.  Entry criteria  Each year there is a call for submissions focusing on the areas of human rights work encompassed by Amnesty's mission, which is \\"to protect individuals wherever justice, fairness, freedom and truth are denied\\". Entries must have been originally published or broadcast in the year preceding the closing deadline. There is an entry fee to help Amnesty cover the cost of administering the awards. The full criteria is available in the Media Awards section of the Amnesty International UK website, and are detailed on the entry form sent out each year around four months before the ceremony.  The ceremony  The ceremony is held annually in central London and is attended by around 400 guests, including politicians, celebrities, and prominent figures in the UK media industry.

Wharton was born in Philadelphia, January 12, 1757, the son of Joseph Wharton, a successful merchant. At an early age he left his studies, and was apprenticed to a hatter. He entered the counting-house of his brother Samuel, a Philadelphia merchant, but he spent much of his time in outdoor sports, and until 1818 was president of the famous fox-hunting club of Gloucester, New Jersey that was organized in 1766. In 1790 he became a member of the Schuylkill Fishing Company, a social club, of which he was president 1812‚Äì1828. Political career Wharton was a member of the Philadelphia city council from 1792 till 1795. In 1796 he was made alderman of that city, and in the same year quelled a riot among sailors who had organized themselves into a body and demanded higher wages. After reading the riot act, he requested they disperse, and, being received with shouts of defiance, Wharton ordered each of his men \\"to take his man,\\" and the sailors were captured and imprisoned. He quelled the Walnut Street Prison riot in 1798 and also took part in suppressing others. He was elected mayor of Philadelphia sixteen times between 1798 and 1824. After serving two one-year terms, 1798‚Äì1800, he declined nomination in 1800. He served three more terms, 1806‚Äì1808 and 1810‚Äì1811, then on being re-elected in 1811, he declined to serve. Subsequently, he served nine more terms, 1814‚Äì1819 and 1820‚Äì1824. His 14 years of service and 16 elections to the office make him the longest-serving and most-elected mayor in Philadelphia's history. Military service Wharton became a member of the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry in 1798 and served as its captain from 1803 to 1811. In 1810, the six troops of cavalry in the city were organized into a regiment, of which Wharton was elected colonel. Later, he was elected brigadier-general of the state militia. He was vice-president of the Washington Benevolent Society, of which he was an original member. Wharton married Salome Chancellor. He died in Philadelphia, March 7, 1834. He was buried at Friends Western Burial Ground at 16th and Race Street in Philadelphia.

At the , Lockington had a population of 808. History For over 26,000 years, the Dja Dja Wurrung, Taungurung and Yorta Yorta people had made the area around Lockington their home. Prior to early settlement, these groups were the primary custodians of the land, maintaining it whilst also practising their culture upon it. The first trace of European settlement can be traced back to the 1840s when it was owned by squatters under lease-hold tenure. At the time the whole area surrounding the present location of Lockington, an area made up of approximately 42,000 hectares, was known as Pine Grove and was owned by John Hunter Patterson. This land would go on to be sub-divided into East and West in 1864. The East was owned by Myles Patterson, who went on to sell it to Hugh and Robert John Glass in 1867. The East went on to switch ownership two more times, first going to Adam Burness in 1867 and then to W.J. Clarke in 1871. The West part of the division in 1864 was owned by W.H. and J.H Robertson, who went on to sell it to Blackwood and Ibbotson in 1867. By 1876 it was owned by J.H. Wheeler. With the discovery of gold and the Victorian Gold Rush occurring in the 1850s, many people came to Pine Grove in hopes of finding their fortune. However with the gold rush subsiding in the 1860s, unemployment within the area rose drastically leading to multiple requests by locals to the state government to allow for farming. With the approval for farming being granted, there was another influx of people into Pine Grove in 1873. This in turn also led to the majority of Aboriginal tribes around the area to disappear. 3 years later the Lockington Post Office was opened on 2 May 1876 as originally being called Pannoobamawm. With the expansion of farming in the area, challenges around water supply would commonly be present, despite the creation of dams which in turn led to wells becoming an important source of water. As the area continued to grow, new schools were established but were moved around depending on the number of children in the specific districts. After the severe drought of the 1890s in Victoria, there were multiple attempts to create irrigation schemes for the state. Whilst construction of the first system would not begin until 1902, the Victorian government had made it one of their top priorities, passing legislation in 1904 to help support the constructions. Despite this effort it wouldn't be until 1911 that Pine Grove would get its first irrigation system. In a few years after the construction of the irrigation system, the Elmore to Cohuna railway was completed in 1915 to help facilitate economic growth in Pine Grove. With the train station being named Bamawm and the post office having the name Pannoobamawm, rail authorities requested a list of names to be submitted to them to help create an official name for the township. The locals of the area eventually suggested the town be named after William Lockington, a prominent Jesuit priest in the early 20th century. With no other places holding such a name, Lockington was officially gazetted in 1921. The Town today Lockington has one pub, a school, three churches and a small range of shops. The district features an extensive network of irrigation channels and these are said to feature the giant \\"Loch Ness yabby\\". Together with its neighbouring township Bamawm, Lockington has an Australian Rules football team (Lockington Bamawm United) competing in the Heathcote District Football League which won consecutive premierships in 2011/2012/2013/2014, led by coach Kahl Oliver, captained by the Lockington legend Nathan O‚ÄôBrien.

Early Jewish presence in the region  Due to other Jewish presence near Sudan, such as in Elephantine, Abyssinia, and Yemen, there is a possibility that there were Jews in the region earlier than the fifteenth century. However, David Reubini (1490 -1540), is thought to be the first Jewish traveler to the region.  Beginnings of the community  There was a small Jewish presence of eight families in 1885 living in Omdurman in Sudan, under Turkish and Egyptian rule. The origins of these families and how they settled in Sudan is largely unknown. They were free to practice Judaism until the rebel leader Muhamed Ahmed Ibn Abdulla El-Mahdi seized control of Sudan from its Ottoman-Egyptian rulers in 1885 and the community was forcibly converted to Islam. In September 1898, General Kitchener and 20,000 Anglo- Egyptian troops including a young Winston Churchill entered Omdurman and regained control of the Sudan. The country became an Anglo-Egyptian condominium and with this new political status it began to economically flourish. The railway line built by the British from Cairo to Khartoum (originally for the military campaign) became particularly important for opening up a previously long and difficult route for traders, including many Jews.  The main community  After Anglo-Egyptian rule had been established, six of the formerly Jewish families chose to revert to Judaism. They were quickly joined by many more Jewish families who saw the economic opportunities of the developing country. Beginning in approximately 1900, Jews from all over the Middle East and North Africa began to arrive in Sudan via Cairo and settle along the Nile in the four towns of Khartoum, Khartoum North, Omdurman and Wad-Medani. Predominantly small-time merchants of textiles, silks and gum, their businesses soon began to flourish. The Jewish community of Khartoum was first officially organized in 1918. By 1926 the small synagogue they had quickly erected had been replaced by a brand new, self-funded building and several of its members owned large, successful business. Despite the fact that the Jewish community as a whole was split between Khartoum, Khartoum North and Omdurman, it was incredibly tight-knit. A single mohel and shochet served the entire community and at the centre of the social scene was the bustling Jewish Social Club (sometimes referred to as the Jewish Recreational Club). At its peak, between 1930 and 1950 the Jewish community in Sudan numbered between 800 and 1000 people.  Decline  In 1956, Sudan gained independence and hostility towards the Jewish community began to grow. From 1957 many members of the community began to leave Sudan for Israel (via Greece), America and European countries - primarily Britain and Switzerland. In 1967 after the Six Day War, anti-Semitic attacks began to appear in Sudanese newspapers advocating the torture and murder of prominent Jewish community leaders. By 1970 almost all of the Jewish community had left Sudan.  The desecration of Jewish cemetery  In 1975 an air-transfer of some of the human remains from the Jewish Cemetery in Khartoum was organized by several prominent members of the community and reburial was arranged in Jerusalem after reports of desecration and vandalism occurring there. The bodies were moved and reburied at the Givaat Shaoul Cemetery in Jerusalem. As of 2005 there were at least 15 Jewish graves left in the Jewish Cemetery at Khartoum. However, in recent years even these have been desecrated and the site was used as a dumping ground for used car parts. In the last year efforts have been made to preserve and clean up the cemetery. The Synagogue was sold and demolished in 1986 and a bank now occupies the site.

It is the type of the genus Irpex. Irpex lacteus is considered a polypore, but depending on growth conditions it can also produce a hydnoid hymenophore. Due to this variability and abundance of the species it has been described as a new species to science numerous times and subsequently has an extensive synonymy. The complete genome sequence of Irpex lacteus was reported in 2017. Irpex lacteus is a white-rot fungus that inhabits mainly angiosperm branches and trunks.Gilbertson RL, Ryvarden L (1986) North American polypores 1, Abortiporus to Lindtneria. Oslo, Fungiflora. It is one of the most common wood-rotting fungi for instance in urban North America. It is inedible.

The school is widely known as by its initial \\"SGI\\" and the students of St. George's Institution are called Georgians for boys and Georgianas for girls. It was founded by a group of La Salle brothers from Penang as a Catholic boys' school. The school is surrounded by four roads, Station Road (front), Barrack Road (behind), Cross Street No. 9 and Cross Street No. 10. The school motto is, Honor Virtutis Praemium which means honour is the reward of virtue. History On 4 March 1914, Brother James Joseph Byrne visited the town Taiping, Perak. He suggested to the then British Resident of Perak, Sir Reginald George Watson (1913‚Äì1919), for the establishment of a Catholic school for boys. His request was approved by the Perak State Government, and a piece of land nearby the hospital was granted. The land was donated by the Kwa Family, one of the wealthy Chinese families of the town. In 1914, the foundation stone was laid by the then Acting Resident of Perak, Oliver Marks, and the opening ceremony was attended by prominent European families and Malay rulers where most of them comprised from the State Council Members and the social elites in Perak. The school was completed in 1915, with 7 teachers, 49 students and 6 classes, housed together in the original three-storey building. The St. George's main building was designed by a colonial architect from Penang, in the mixture of Neo-Grec and Neo-Romanesque architecture, with two wings and a main porch in front (facing the Station Road). The charming building is still standing today and serves as the school's front facade. The first Director of the school was Brother James Gilbert who served as the director and principal in the first year of its establishment (he later returned to serve another term in 1923). The school was run by La Sallian missionaries from all around the world, however it received partial financial assistance from the State Government. After Malaya gained independence from the British Government in 1957, the school continued on as a missionary school with limited funding from the government though it was staffed with teachers from the Education Department. As from 2006, the school is funded 95% by the Ministry of Education of Malaysia. During World War II, along with other schools in the town, St. George's was closed down. It was converted into the headquarters for the Kempetai. The rumoured brutality and torture committed by the Japanese military police during the tenure of the school is a source of ghostly legends commonly circulated by the students even today. The Lassalian brothers were placed under house detention, old boys of the school during this period time risked their lives to assist the detained missionaries. The school reopened at the end of the war along with other schools, such as SMK King Edward VII, St. John's Institution, SMK Victoria Institution and St. Michael's Institution. The Brothers' quarters The Brothers' quarters were occupied at the first and second floor of the main building right wing. In the immediate post-war and pre-war the second floor was divided into three sections. Near to the chapel stairs was the largest section when the Brothers, numbering about a dozen, had their desks, with the Director's desk in the far centre. This was the study room for the Brothers. The second section was the fitted dining room for the Brothers. At the end was a narrow section were the table-boy (a Hainan) laid out the food, where the food brought up from the kitchen. The small kitchen was situated where the bicycle shed today. After the changes of Directorship, the large first section was sub-divided as the number of Brothers had decreased. The study room was split into a common recreation room. During the Japanese Occupation in Malaya, the Japanese demolished the Brothers' dorms at the second floor. When the Japanese surrendered to the British in 1945, Brother Dennis and Brother Casimir rebuilt the cubicles, about 14 in numbers. After the end of the last school Director, Rev. Bro. Charles Levin, the Brothers' Quarters were left vacant for years. In 2000, the school authorities renovated the Brothers' Quarters to expand the number of classrooms. In 2001, the renovations were completed and housed the Sixth Former students. The first floor was transformed into computer rooms.

The later models have large over-sized trigger guards and Picatinny rails for mounting a wide range of sights and scopes. They come in stainless steel or with a Parkerized finish. Characteristics The Springfield Armory M6 Scout is virtually identical to the original M6 Aircrew Survival Weapon. The Scout is also made of stamped sheet steel, with a forged steel removable barrel assembly. The barrel assembly is connected to the stock/action group by means of a removable hinge pin. Whether folded or disassembled, the overall length for storage is approximately 18.5 inches which is the length of the barrels. Unlike nearly all other firearms, there is no \\"furniture\\" on the Scout like a butt stock or a forearm. The only parts which are not steel are the rubber butt plate and cheek rest. Aircrew were instructed to wrap the barrels with parachute cord as a field expedient fore-stock.http://www.oldjimbo.com/survival/v-shrake/m6.html The M6 Survival System The Scout has a rifle barrel mounted above a .410 shotgun barrel, this is known as a superposed \\"over-under\\" design. Its upper rifle barrel is chambered for .22 Long Rifle or .22 Magnum, in addition to the .22 Hornet used by the USAF M6. The Scout comes with iron sights and the later models have Picatinny rails for mounting a wide range of sights and scopes. The original USAF M6 stock held 9 rounds of .22 Hornet ammunition and four .410 shells, and the Scout holds 12 rounds of .22 Hornet and 4 shotgun shells. For the rim-fire models, the stock holds 15 rim-fire cartridges and four shotgun shells. One other unique feature of the M6 is the \\"squeeze-bar trigger.\\" Intended for use by aircrew who might be downed in any type of weather and terrain, the trigger, hammer and barrel latch are designed to be easily operated while wearing heavy gloves or mittens. To this end, the USAF M6 was the only firearm issued to American armed forces which had no trigger guard. The amount of pressure needed to release the sear, combined with the practice of keeping the hammer uncocked unless preparing to fire, was considered sufficient to counter any risk of accidental discharge.

Purpose  The Rothensee boat lift was originally envisaged as part of a larger project. The lift is at the Eastern end of the Mittellandkanal, it was intended that this canal would cross the Elbe on an aqueduct and then be connected to the Elbe-Havel Canal by a double boat lift at Hohenwarthe. The Rothensee lift is about 500m from the junction of the Elbeabstiegcanal and the MittellandKanal lowering boats to the level of the Elbe. The Rothensee lift was completed in 1938 but as a result of the Second World War the aqueduct and Hohenwarthe lift were not constructed. As part of a German re-unification transport project the Elbe aqueduct was completed after a 60 year delay, however two shaft locks were built instead of the proposed Hohenwarthe lift. For 60 years, therefore, the Rothensee lift, which was originally intended to allow passage just from the Mittellandkanal to the Elbe carried all the navigation traffic from the West German industrial centres to West Berlin. In 2001 the parallel Rothensee ship lock which allows the passage of bigger ships was completed making the lift redundant.  Technology  The boat lift overcomes a normal water level difference of 16 metres, however, changing water levels on the Elbe causes this to vary between 11 and 18 metres. The trough moves between levels in 3 minutes. A boat can pass through the lift in 20 minutes. Approximately 70 ships with a maximum displacement of 1,000 tonnes pass through the lift daily. The dimensions of the caisson are 85 x 12.2 x 2.5 meters. Boat lift trough The Rothensee boat lift utilizes floats in float chambers in a similar manner to that at Henrichenburg. In this case only two float chambers were needed. The lift follows the patented plans of Rudolf Mussaeus. The trough is 85 metres long and 12.2 metres wide and is supported on two 36 metre long 10 metre in diameter cylindrical floats submerged in two 60 metre deep float chambers. The floats are internally sub- divided into three separate chambers. Each of these chambers is filled with air compressed to a pressure appropriate to its depth in the float chamber in order to prevent implosion. The floats provide buoyant lift equivalent to 5,400 tonnes, enough to balance the weight of the trough and its load of water and ship. The trough is set in motion using four worm geared shafts, 27.3 metres long and 42 centimetres in diameter moved by eight 44 kW electric motors. Because the trough and its load are in equilibrium with the floats only the friction opposing the troughs movement needs to be overcome by the motors. A complete lift can be achieved using less than 500 kW of power. To the right of one of the geared shafts This method of construction was selected because a standard lock was not technically possible over this height difference at the time. This method also saved the cost of back pumping lost water. Today 110 million m¬≥ of water are back pumped for the parallel ship lock each year. The overall height of the lift measured from the base of the underground float chambers to the upper cross beams is 97.21 metres. The water depth in the trough is usually 2.5 metres.  History  The building of the boat lift was a major engineering achievement. To build the lift 225,000 cubic metres of earth were moved and 55,000 cubic metres of concrete were needed. In order to dig the pits for the two 60m deep float chambers the ground was frozen to a temperature of -40 degrees celsius in order to prevent a possible collapse of the excavation. It took 4 months for the temperature to be lowered by the correct amount. In the neighbourhood of the boat lift a company owned housing estate, the Schiffshebewerk Estate was built. In the first 50 years of its existence 730,000 lifts were completed. In the years 1980 and 1981 an 18-month-long general overhaul was completed. It was at this time that it received its green coat of paint.  The lift today  Despite the completion of the parallel locks in 2001 the lift is still in use. The German Federal audit office, aware of the lift's current loss making status will probably bring about the lift's closure in the near future.

A plant pathogen, it causes red heart rot, a red discoloration on conifers, particularly spruces or Douglas-firs. Fruit bodies are produced on dead wood, or sometimes on dead branches of living trees. They are a thin leathery crust of the wood surface. Fresh fruit bodies will bleed a red-colored juice if injured, reflected in the common names bleeding Stereum or the bleeding conifer parchment. It can be the host of the parasitic jelly fungus Tremella encephala. Taxonomy The species was first described scientifically by Albertini and Schweinitz in 1805 as Thelephora sanguinolenta. Other genera to which it has been transferred throughout its taxonomical history include Phlebomorpha, Auricularia, Merulius, and Haematostereum. The fungus is commonly known as the \\"bleeding Stereum\\" or the \\"bleeding conifer parchment\\". Description The fruit body of Stereum sanguinolentum manifests itself as a thin (typically less than 1 mm thick) leathery crust on the surface of the host wood. Often, the upper edge is curled to form a narrow shelf (usually less than 10 mm thick). When present, these shelves can be fused to or overlap neighboring shelves. The surface of the fruit body consists of a layer of fine felt-like hairs, sometimes pressed flat against the surface. The color ranges from beige to buff to dark brown in mature specimens; the margin are lighter- colored. Fresh fruit bodies that are injured exude a red juice, or will bruise a red color if touched. The fruit bodies dry to a greyish-brown color. The spores are ellipsoid to cylindrical, amyloid, and typically measure 7‚Äì10 by 3‚Äì4.5 ¬µm. Stereum sanguinolentum can be parasitized by the jelly fungus Tremella encephala. Symptoms Stereum sanguinolentum is a basidiomycete that causes both brown rot and white rot on conifers. The primary symptom is the red streaking discoloration. White rot basidomycete causes an extensive decay resulting from wounds, logging extractions; bark peeking, or branch pruning. Stereum sanguinolentum forms territorial clones while spreading by vegetative growths between spatially separated resource units; Armillaria spp, Heterobasidion annosum, Phellinus weirii, Inonotus tomentosus, and Phellinus noxius all work with Stereum sanguinolentum to attack the host. The combinations of these pathogens work together to form territorial clones that can cover up to several hectares and survive for hundreds of years while infecting trees. White rot causes a gradual decrease in cellulose as the decay continues to affect the tree. The white rot fungi consume the segments of cellulose that are released during the decay as quickly as they are produced. White rot is also known as ‚Äúwound rot of spruce‚Äù and is when the spores create open wounds on the host. In Brown Rot, the cellulose is degraded. The rapid decrease in cellulose chain length implies that the catalyst that facilitates the depolymerization readily gains access to cellulose chains. Life cycle Stereum sanguinolentum is an amphithallic basidiomycete. Monospore intrabasidiome pairings are always compatible when reproducing making it easy for the fungus to spread. The monobasidiospore and trama isolates are plurinucleate and bear clamp connections and are often dikaryotic. Basidiospores are heterokikaryotic indicating that they are amphithallic. The mycelia that spreads the fungi grow from the heterodikaryotic spores that originate from the basidiospores. Either mating between homokaryons originating from the monokaryotic basidiospores or by the parasexual process results in recombination. Stereum snaguinolentum is an extremely fast colonizer of newly dead or wounded conifer sapwood. Being amphithallic allows this cycle to have selective advantages upon such organisms by enhancing survival and dispersal. Dispersal occurs by basidiospores only and the most common way they are dispersed in this cycle is wind blown dispersal. The wind blown basidiospores are produced parthenogenically which is reproduction from an ovum with out fertilization. In white rot, the infection occurs from spores landing near the wounds or the transmission of mycelial fragments by wood sap. The rot extension spreads extremely fast in the first years after infection but spreads even quicker if the injuries are at the root collar are infected rather than the stem. Habitat, distribution, and ecology Stereum sanguinolentum can be parasitized by the fungus Tremella encephala The fungus causes a brown heart rot, resulting in wood that is a light brown to red-brown color, and dry, with a stringy texture. A cross-section of infected wood reveals a circular infection around the center of the log. It enter opens wounds of plants caused by mechanical damage or by grazing wildlife. Fragments of mycelia can be spread by wood wasps (genus Sirex). The rot spreads up to per year. It has also been recorded on balsam fir, Douglas fir, and western hemlock. The fungus is widespread in distribution, and has been recorded from North America, Europe, east Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. Management Prevention of the halos caused by Stereum sanguinolentum can be accomplished by carefully harvesting trees assuring no injuries occur. If injuries occur, treat the wounds with wound dressing.

Cyrtostylis orchids often form dense colonies of genetically identical plants. They have a single heart-shaped leaf and a thin flowering stem with pale coloured insect-like flowers. The lateral sepals and petals are similar in size and colour but the labellum is shelf-like and conspicuous with two prominent glands at its base. Description Orchids in the genus Cyrtostylis are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs, usually with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and one or two tubers. They often form dense colonies of cloned plants. There is a single green, heart-shaped, ground-hugging leaf at the base of the flowering stem. The thin flowering stem bears one to a few flowers with the column at the top. The flowers are usually pale coloured with an erect dorsal sepal and spreading lateral sepals and petals. The petals and sepals are narrow lance-shaped and about as long as each other and the dorsal sepal. The labellum is stalkless, oblong and about as long as the sepals and petals with two bead-like glands and two ridges along its length. The column is curved with wings and is about half as long as the labellum. Orchids in this genus are similar to those in Acianthus but lack the long appendage on the ends of the sepals and petals of that genus. The lateral sepals differ from the petals in Acianthus. Taxonomy and naming The genus was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown in his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. He described Cyrtostylis reniformis at the same time, making it the type species. The name Cyrtostylis is derived from the Greek words cyrtos meaning 'curved' and stylos, 'pertaining to the style', referring to the curved column found in all members of this genus. The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families lists five species of Cyrtostlyis but Australian authorities list six. The difference lies in the interpretation of Cyrtostylis huegelii which the Checklist considers a synonym of Cyrtostylis reniformis var. huegelii. * Cyrtostylis oblonga Hook.f.

It is one of the six Vedangas, or ancillary science connected with the Vedas that developed .James Lochtefeld (2002), \\"Jyotisha\\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A‚ÄìM, Rosen Publishing, , pages 326‚Äì327 This field of study was concerned with fixing the days and hours of Vedic rituals. Hindu astrology from the 3rd century BCE was greatly influenced by Greek tradition,. But the concept of Vedanga predates Greek contact, and there have also been later independent developments. Hindu astrology as it stands today is inherently a study of karma, which gives it a very different foundation compared to Greek astrology. In addition to this, the predictive techniques such as Dashas (planetary and sign-based time periods), Vargas (harmonic divisions of the horoscope) are not that evolved in Greek astrology. Etymology Jyotisha, states Monier-Williams, is rooted in the word Jyotish which means light, such as that of sun or moon or heavenly body. The term Jyotisha includes the study of astronomy, astrology and the science of timekeeping using the movements of astronomical bodies. It aimed to keep time, maintain calendar, and predict auspicious times for Vedic rituals. History According to David Pingree, the field of timekeeping in Jyotisha may have been \\"derived from Mesopotamia during the Achaemenid period\\", but Yukio Ohashi considers this proposal as \\"definitely wrong\\". Ohashi states that this Vedanga field developed from actual astronomical studies in ancient India. Other scholars dismiss various arguments of Pingree and K. S. Shukla points out a controversy by showing Pingree‚Äôs incorrect amendations to the manuscript of the YavanajƒÅtaka, which Pingree believed to be highly corrupted.Bill Mak (Kyoto University), The transmission of Greek astral science to India reconsidered - Critical remarks on the contents and the newly discovered manuscript of the YavanajƒÅtaka. Institute for Research in Humanities, 2012.10.27. The texts of Vedic Jyotisha sciences were translated into the Chinese language in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, and the Rigvedic passages on astronomy are found in the works of Zhu Jiangyan and Zhi Qian. Timekeeping as well as the nature of solar and lunar movements are mentioned in Vedic texts. For example, Kaushitaki Brahmana chapter 19.3 mentions the shift in the relative location of the sun towards north for 6 months, and south for 6 months. Texts The ancient extant text on Jyotisha is the Vedanga-Jyotisha, which exists in two editions, one linked to Rigveda and other to Yajurveda. The Rigveda version consists of 36 verses, while the Yajurveda recension has 43 verses of which 29 verses are borrowed from the Rigveda. The Rigveda version is variously attributed to sage Lagadha, and sometimes to sage Shuci. The Yajurveda version credits no particular sage, has survived into the modern era with a commentary of Somakara, and is the more studied version. The Jyotisha text Brahma-siddhanta, probably composed in the 5th century CE, discusses how to use the movement of planets, sun and moon to keep time and calendar. This text also lists trigonometry and mathematical formulae to support its theory of orbits, predict planetary positions and calculate relative mean positions of celestial nodes and apsides. The text is notable for presenting very large integers, such as 4.32 billion years as the lifetime of the current universe. The ancient Hindu texts on Jyotisha only discuss time keeping, and never mention astrology or prophecy. These ancient texts predominantly cover astronomy, but at a rudimentary level. Technical horoscopes and astrology ideas in India came from Greece and developed in the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE. Later medieval era texts such as the Yavana-jataka and the Siddhanta texts are more astrology-related. Discussion The field of Jyotisha deals with ascertaining time, particularly forecasting auspicious day and time for Vedic rituals. The field of Vedanga structured time into Yuga which was a 5-year interval, divided into multiple lunisolar intervals such as 60 solar months, 61 savana months, 62 synodic months and 67 sidereal months. A Vedic Yuga had 1,860 tithis (, dates), and it defined a savana-day (civil day) from one sunrise to another. The Rigvedic version of Jyotisha may be a later insertion into the Veda, states David Pingree, possibly between 513 and 326 BCE, when Indus valley was occupied by the Achaemenid from Mesopotamia. The mathematics and devices for time keeping mentioned in these ancient Sanskrit texts, proposes Pingree, such as the water clock may also have arrived in India from Mesopotamia. However, Yukio Ohashi considers this proposal as incorrect, suggesting instead that the Vedic timekeeping efforts, for forecasting appropriate time for rituals, must have begun much earlier and the influence may have flowed from India to Mesopotamia. Ohashi states that it is incorrect to assume that the number of civil days in a year equal 365 in both Hindu and Egyptian‚ÄìPersian year. Further, adds Ohashi, the Mesopotamian formula is different from the Indian formula for calculating time, each can only work for their respective latitude, and either would make major errors in predicting time and calendar in the other region. According to Asko Parpola, the Jyotisha and luni-solar calendar discoveries in ancient India, and similar discoveries in China in \\"great likelihood result from convergent parallel development\\", and not from diffusion from Mesopotamia.Asko Parpola (2013), \\"Beginnings of Indian Astronomy, with Reference to a Parallel Development in China\\", History of Science in South Asia, Vol. 1, pages 21‚Äì25 Kim Plofker states that while a flow of timekeeping ideas from either side is plausible, each may have instead developed independently, because the loan-words typically seen when ideas migrate are missing on both sides as far as words for various time intervals and techniques. Further, adds Plofker, and other scholars, that the discussion of time keeping concepts are found in the Sanskrit verses of the Shatapatha Brahmana, a 2nd millennium BCE text. Water clock and sun dials are mentioned in many ancient Hindu texts such as the Arthashastra. Some integration of Mesopotamian and Indian Jyotisha-based systems may have occurred in a roundabout way, states Plofker, after the arrival of Greek astrology ideas in India. The Jyotisha texts present mathematical formulae to predict the length of day time, sun rise and moon cycles. For example, :The length of daytime = \\\\left(12 + \\\\frac{2}{61}n \\\\right) muhurtas :where n is the number of days after or before the winter solstice, and one muhurta equals of a day (48 minutes). > Water clock > A prastha of water [is] the increase in day, [and] decrease in night in the > [sun's] northern motion; vice versa in the southern.

The novel was first printed in 1996, but has been reprinted a number of times since. The novel was selected by Publishers Weekly as one of the best mysteries of the year, nominated for the 1996 Hammett Prize, and won the 1997 Arthur Ellis Award for 'Best Novel'. Plot When last seen alive, sixteen-year-old Deborah Harrison was on her way home from school. Her friend Megan thinks she saw the shadowy figure of a man behind Deborah as they waved goodbye on the bridge, but the fog was so thick that evening she can‚Äôt be sure. Not long after, Deborah‚Äôs body is found in the local cemetery. The murder terrorises the wealthy enclave of St Mary‚Äôs, Eastvale, and because Deborah was the daughter of a prominent industrialist, high-flying new Chief Constable Jeremiah \\"Jimmy\\" Riddle puts pressure on Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his team to catch the killer without delay. And soon, partly thanks to the work of new boy Detective Inspector Barry Stott, it looks as if they have done. But Banks is not convinced. While the community breathes a collective sigh of relief and turns into a lynch-mob, Banks examines the loose ends: a vicar, accused of sexually harassing a refugee worker, who lies about his whereabouts at the time of the murder; his straying wife; a schoolteacher with a dark secret; the accused‚Äôs vindictive ex-girlfriend; a teenage thug who has threatened Deborah and her family with violence. And then there are Deborah‚Äôs own family secrets. With each new piece of information, a different pattern is formed, until Banks is forced to incur the wrath of Jimmy Riddle if he hopes to solve the case. Original story Robinson wrote a short story Innocence in 1990, about Terry Reed who was accused then cleared of the murder of a schoolgirl. Robinson next wrote an entire novel from Reed‚Äôs point of view, which was turned down by his publisher. He then thought it might work better with DI Banks, and rewrote the novel as Innocent Graves with DI Banks and Reed as Owen. The short story Innocence was published in Not Safe After Dark (1998); see Introduction to the collection. Adaptation When the story was adapted for television, it was heavily edited and was noted for not bearing much resemblance to the original book. For example, the murder victim was now known as Ellie Clayton; Ellie was last seen leaving her local theatre group, rather than her school; her body was found a popular beauty spot at Valley's Edge, rather that in the local cemetery; Ellie's father is an internet entrepreneur, rather than an industrialist; and the suspects are her father's business partner, her father, her on-off one-man crime spree boyfriend; and her theatre tutor; rather than a vicar, his wife, or an ex-girlfriend of the accused. The episode was also heavily reminiscent of DC Ken Blackstone's actions, rather than Jimmy Riddle.

It is situated at the western end of the wide Cephissus valley, at the foot of the mountains Giona and Oeta. It is 3 km northwest of Gravia, 19 km north of Amfissa and 23 km south of Lamia. The Greek National Road 27 (Damasta - Amfissa - Itea) passes southeast of the village. The railway from Athens to Thessaloniki passes east of the village, with the nearest railway station at Bralos, 4 km east. Kastellia has an area of app. 37,468 acres (151,630 m¬≤) and an average altitude of 450m. The ground is semi-highland consisting of: (1) 8,914 acres of cultivated land, (2) 11,368 acres of partial-forestry land, (3) 13,925 acres of forestry quality land. The remainder is allocated for housing and roads. The population has been steadily decreasing. The 1928 census found 1,066 inhabitants. By 1961 it had fallen to 827. By 1991 it had dropped to 779 and the latest census, in 2011, counted only 523. History After the Trojan War the Dorians settled in the area of present Kastellia, and founded the cities Erineus, Boium, Cytinium and Pindus. In 1835, after the Greek War of Independence, Kastellia became a part of the municipality of Erineos, named after the ancient city. This municipality, part of the Parnassida Province, had 2,253 inhabitants. In 1872 the municipality was renamed to Dorieis. The municipality was dissolved on August 29, 1912 (under Law 4057/1912) and Kastellia became an independent community, with the settlement of Chlomos. In 1997 under the Capodistrian Plan, the former communities Apostolias, Gravia, Kaloskopi, Kastellia, Mariolata, Oinochori, Sklithro and Vargiani were merged into the new municipality of Gravia. Kastellia today Kastellia The town has a modern community hall where the ground floor serves as the offices of the town council and the upper floor has been converted to a six room hostel to host students and tourists. A community clinic has been constructed at a site donated in 1972 by K.I. Drosopoulos. It provides low-cost health care to local residents and also serves as the doctor‚Äôs residence. The nearest lyceum (middle school) and gymnasium (secondary school) are in Gravia. Because of the limited agricultural activity, an agricultural and fiduciary association is being housed in a large stone building which is also used as a repository. In 1910, it operated as the mutual association, a co-op which insured against crop and livestock loss. In Chlomos it ran the Rural and Cattle Association for the same purpose. Livestock farming is limited to flocks of sheep, goats and cattle. East of town there is a modern pig farm. There are many professional craftsmen, such as carpenters, steelworkers, electricians and plumbers. Commercial facilities include supply yards of building materials and earthmoving machinery as well as a modern unit for processing timber. For entertainment purposes there are coffee houses, cafeterias and taverns. A large number of Kastellians live in Athens, Piraeus, Lamia, Thessaloniki, Amfissa, and Larissa, as well as abroad (mainly in America and Australia). Despite the fact that the population is shrinking, a large number of new houses are being built and many older homes are being refurbished. Cultural associations The Progressive Association \\"Kastellia\\" which is based in Athens, was founded in 1950. Its membership is composed of Kastellians who live outside the area. The association publishes a newspaper The Kastelliotika Nea with news and events related to the town and those who have left. In each of the last 15 years the association has organized a ceremony where the young people from Kastellia who succeed in the Pan-Hellenic Examinations receive a commemorative diploma and a monetary reward. The association was founded by Ioannis Moscholios. By a decision of the Amfissa Court (#297/87), the founding statute of the Kastellia Cultural Association was approved. Its main aims are: (1) The study and protection of the natural environment of Kastellia. (2) The rediscovery and promotion of the town's cultural heritage. (3) Improving the cultural level of the population. The cultural association organizes many cultural events in Kastellia.

Becoming Jane Austen was first published in hardcover by Hambledon Continuum in 2003.

He was elected to a second and final term as a judge of the court (ending 31 October 2012) and re-elected as a section president in 2004. He was a vice-president of the court from 19 January 2007 to 3 November 2011. In July 2011, he was elected to succeed Jean- Paul Costa as President of the court on 3 November 2011. His term on the court ended on 31 October 2012, and he resigned as a Justice of the High Court on 1 November 2012. =Other appointments= Bratza was appointed as President of the British Institute of Human Rights Advisory Board in February 2013, a member of the Advisory Board of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law, a member of the Editorial Board of the European Human Rights Law Review and a member of the Advisory Board of the European Human Rights Association.http://www.bihr.org.uk/about-us/advisory_board In June 2007, he received the degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, from the University of Glasgow. In 2014, Bratza became an ambassador for Toynbee Hall. It marked a return to the East London charity, where he had volunteered at its Free Legal Advice Centre during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 2018, Bratza became a member of the Executive Committee of the International Commission of Jurists, having served as a Commissioner since 2013.

H. Foulkes, Jane Abercrombie and Norbert Elias as a learned society to study and promote the development of Group Analysis in both its clinical and applied aspects. The first regular weekly seminars were given by Foulkes in 1952. Members of the Society come from different countries and from many fields and disciplines, including psychology, sociology, medicine, nursing, social work, counselling, education, industry, architecture, anthropology and theology. The following individuals were Founder Members: Dr. James Anthony, Dr Patrick De Mare, the Hon. W. H. R. Iliffe and S. H. Foulkes. They were joined from the beginning by Mrs M. L. J. Abercrombie, Dr Norbert Elias and Miss E. T. Marx. The Society, which has charitable status, is a learned society and a non- profit organization, has been holding regular scientific meetings and organizes various workshops, including an annual one in January. A triennial European symposium is held at various European locations. An annual S. H. Foulkes lecture for a wider public has been held in London since 1977; the lectures are published in the journal Group Analysis.Pines, Malcolm (ed) (2000). The Evolution of Group Analysis. International Library of Group Analysis, Jessica Kingsley. Background After the Second World War, and after the experiments in treating soldiers by group methods at Northfield Hospital near Birmingham, a circle of colleagues interested in furthering their understanding of groups and how to apply group psychotherapy met regularly with Foulkes. In 1971, leading members of the Society set up the Institute of Group Analysis, which became responsible for training, including an intensive qualifying course that leads to membership of the Institute. Training activities now take place at various British centres as well as on the Continent of Europe, with strong informal links with the London Institute. The Society publishes a journal, Group Analysis, published by Sage. Foulkes was the first editor, and he continued to devote much energy to it until 1975, when he handed over the editorial role to an old colleague and co-founder of the Group-Analytic Society, Patrick de Mar√©. Under Foulkes and de Mar√© it remained a very informal publication, with a large correspondence section. It has since developed into a more formal academic publication. A newsletter, Group Analytic Contexts, is directly descended from \\"Group Analysis International Panel and Correspondence\\" (GAIPAC) that was first edited by Foulkes in 1967 in order to establish dialogue between a wide international network. It then became the Bulletin of the Group Analytic Society and was edited by Elizabeth Foulkes, the widow of S. H. Foulkes, after his death. She passed on the editorship to Dr. Ronald A. Sandison in 1988. In 1993 Anne Harrow and Sheila Thomson took over the editorship of the society newsletter, now called Group Analytic Contexts. The newsletter provides a forum for shorter and more informal communications between Group Analytic Society members from across the world and is increasingly integrated with the closed e-mail Forum for Society members. Contexts reports on the activities of GAS and the work and opinions of members. The Society works through a number of sub-committees and provides: * The Journal: Group Analysis, containing papers, book reviews and international correspondence. * The International Newsletter: Group Analytic Contexts, with news, theoretical and clinical articles, reports and correspondence.

The novel was first printed in 1999, but has been reprinted a number of times since. The novel is widely acclaimed as Robinson's best, a large step forward in ambition from previous books, and this was reflected in its critical and commercial response. The novel was nominated for the 1999 Hammett Prize, was shortlisted for the American Edgar Award and won the 2000 Anthony Award for 'Best Novel'.  Research on the period  After researching the Second World War for In a Dry Season, Robinson wrote two short stories set in wartime (1940s) Yorkshire involving Frank Bascombe a \\"special constable in the war\\" and veteran of the First World War: Missing in Action and In Flanders Fields, which were published in Not Safe After Dark. A third story \\"Cornelius Jubb\\" in The Price of Love involves \\"Constable Bascombe\\", although he could not use the full name \\"Frank Bascombe\\" in the collection for copyright reasons; see Introduction and Afternotes to the collections. Location of setting With its setting in Yorkshire, England, the name of the lost village \\"Hobb's End\\" and other local references, it was always suggested that Robinson based the location on the real life lost village of \\"West End\\", the ruins of which lie under Thruscross reservoir (also in Yorkshire). Robinson himself confirmed this in a podcast he recorded for Yorkshire Water in 2007, eight years after the novel was first published. During exceptionally dry summers, the remains of West End have been exposed as the reservoir dries up, just as the fictional Hobb's End is in this novel.

Background Most of the first dozen novels focused on crimes investigated by Banks. In the 1999 novel, In A Dry Season, Banks and his wife, Sandra, are separated and eventually divorce. The character of Detective Sergeant (subsequently Detective Inspector) Annie Cabbot makes her first appearance as a member of Banks' team. Subsequent novels have a sub-plot about the on-off romance between Banks and Cabbot. A colleague of Banks from his time in London, Detective Superintendent (later Chief Superintendent) Richard \\"Dirty Dick\\" Burgess, is another perennial character who appears in many of the novels. Initially hostile to Banks when they first met, they become good friends over time and have established a natural (if still slightly edgy) rapport by the early 21st century.

During this time, his scalps included Scott Newman (his maiden first-class wicket), Adam Hollioake, James Benning, Darren Bicknell, Jason Gallian, Russell Warren, Mark Richardson (New Zealand touring side), Michael di Venuto, Jonathan Moss and Jehan Mubarak (Sri Lankan touring side). Linley moved to Sussex in 2005, ostensibly as a 'prize' after winning the London County Cricket Club 'search for a star' competition, although rumour has it the contract had already been agreed previously. It did not prove to be a happy pairing. There were few opportunities for Linley in Sussex's championship winning side and his appearances were restricted to the second XI, the tourists game (Sri Lanka) and the Twenty20 challenge. Linley then made the occasional appearance for Middlesex Second XI and had an extended run with Surrey second XI in 2008 including a five-wicket haul (seven in the match) against Kent. He played for Surrey in the final two Twenty20 group matches of the 2009 season but was wicketless in both.

Orbital dynamics Blue sky catastrophe is a type of bifurcation of a periodic orbit. In other words, it describes a sort of behaviour stable solutions of a set of differential equations can undergo as the equations are gradually changed. This type of bifurcation is characterised by both the period and length of the orbit approaching infinity as the control parameter approaches a finite bifurcation value, but with the orbit still remaining within a bounded part of the phase space, and without loss of stability before the bifurcation point. In other words, the orbit vanishes into the blue sky. Applications of blue sky catastrophe in other fields The bifurcation has found application in, amongst other places, slow-fast models of computational neuroscience. The possibility of the phenomenon was raised by David Ruelle and Floris Takens in 1971, and explored by R.L. Devaney and others in the following decade. More compelling analysis was not performed until the 1990s. This bifurcation has also been found in the context of fluid dynamics, namely in double-diffusive convection of a small Prandtl number fluid. Double diffusive convection occurs when convection of the fluid is driven by both thermal and concentration gradients, and the temperature and concentration diffusivities take different values. The bifurcation is found in an orbit that is born in a global saddle-loop bifurcation, becomes chaotic in a period doubling cascade, and disappears in the blue sky catastrophe.

For most of this article the pathogen will be referred to as C. gloeosporioides. This pathogen is a significant problem worldwide, causing anthracnose and fruit rotting diseases on hundreds of economically important hosts. Laid out here is an overview of some of the most important aspects of this pathogen. Hosts and symptoms C. gloeosporioides has an extremely broad host range, causing anthracnose disease on a variety of crops such as cereals and grasses, legumes, fruits, vegetables, perennial crops, and trees. It has been observed as infecting harvested durian of the species Durio graveolens. Although the species is so broad in susceptible hosts, some studies are suggesting C. gloeosporioides has sub-populations specific to each host.Nelson, C. Scot \\"Mango Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides)\\" University of Hawaii at Manoa cooperative extension service. Aug. 2008 The symptoms can vary from host to host, but tend to manifest as water soaked, sunken spots on fruit that turn necrotic as the disease progresses, and small dark lesions on leaves. Using mangoes, one of the most economically important hosts, as an example, fruit symptoms manifest late in the season as infected fruit ripens to maturity. At this point fruit develops large, sunken areas of decay that are dark brown to black in color. Occasional fruit cracking can also occur when linear necrotic lesions develop into deep cracks through the epidermis that can extend down into the pulp of the fruit. Because symptoms remain unseen before ripening, plants that appear healthy upon picking can become quickly riddled with disease in storage or transport. Mango leaves exhibit symptoms as small, angular, brown/black lesions that enlarge as the disease progresses. Again, these symptoms vary from host to host, but mangoes serve as a decent example for the general symptomatology of this pathogen. In chestnuts, disease symptoms may also be called blossom end rot. Browning of the chestnut burs at the blossom end may be a first sign in August. At harvest time, blackening of pointed end of the chestnut shell and kernel indicates infection. The extent of blackening can be variable. It can range from a barely visible black tip of the kernel to the whole nut being black. Parts of the nut kernel with no color change remain edible.Greg Miller, Blossom End Rot of Chestnut: A Small Problem Becomes a Big Problem, The Chestnut Grower, Winter 2017 Regardless of host, C. gloeosporioides produces several signs useful for diagnosis. When observed under a dissecting microscope acervuli can often be spotted if the diseased tissue has recently been under sporulating conditions. These acervuli will appear orange to pinkish in color, due to the masses of conidia being produced on the surface, and will have black, hair-like, setae spiking out in several directions. Under a compound microscope conidia appear ovoid in shape. On certain hosts the teleomorph of this pathogen (G. cingulata) readily produces perithecia full of asci. When cultured on potato dextrose media, this species can appear gray, orange, or pink in color, and will often exhibit concentric rings of growth radiating from the center. C. gloeosporioides can also be identified by PCR if the required resources are available. Importance Because this species has such an extraordinary host range its economic impact is somewhat nebulous when considering all hosts at once. Looking specifically at some of the more economically important hosts proves this pathogen is a huge problem for growers all over the world. For strawberries produced in China, C. gloeosporioides, along with Colletotrichum acutatum, and Colletotrichum fragariae cause up to 80% of plant loss in strawberry nurseries, and over 40% of yield loss in field. In just these two examples this pathogen is causing millions of dollars in losses. When the species' entire host range is considered the economic impact cannot be overstated. There is, however, current research suggesting that due to the variability of C. gloeosporioides among hosts, this pathogen should be split into different species or at least different formal species designations. Phylogenetic analysis of C. gloeosporioides isolates sampled from across the broad host range shows enough genetic variation to suggest a need for more specific classification among this species. Work is being done to provide a modern classification system for what is being called the \\"C. gloeosporioides complex\\". Depending on the results of this research it is possible the blame for economic loss currently being placed on C. gloeosporioides will be split between several newly characterized species within this complex. Disease cycle The disease cycle is impacted by which form of the pathogen (teleomorph or anamorph) you find on the host. This distinction affects how the pathogen overwinters or survives periods without a susceptible host. If the sexual stage (teleomorph) is present, the pathogen sexually reproduces to form ascospores inside of asci, and subsequently packed into perithecia. This method provides genetic variation and the convenience of perithecia which can act as a survival structure. If only the asexual stage (anamorph) is present the pathogen must survive inside of infected plant tissue or on an alternate host. Once environmental conditions are met (<95% humidity, 25‚Äì28 ¬∞C), the ascospores are ejected and infected plant tissue sporulates. Ascospores infect directly, while the infected plant tissue produces acervuli which produces masses of conidia on conidiophores. These conidia are disseminated by rain splash or wind onto new infection courts such as leaves, young fruit, or blossoms.Sharma M, Kulshrestha S. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides: An anthracnose causing pathogen of fruits and vegetables. Biosci Biotechnol Res Asia 2015;12(2) Upon infection the pathogen continues to produce conidia throughout the season resulting in a polycyclic disease cycle. Once the host plant starts to senesce the teleomorph form of the disease (G. cingulata) will start to sexually produce ascospores in perithecia to restart the cycle. Pathogenesis C. gloeosporioides is a hemibiotroph, meaning it lives part way between the biotrophic and saprophytic lifestyles. The pathogen prefers a living host, but once the host tissue dies, or the pathogen finds itself surviving in the soil without a host, it can switch to a saprophytic lifestyle and feed off of dead plant material. Under correct environmental conditions, if a C. gloeosporioides conidium lands upon a susceptible host it will first produce an appressorium. This specialized structure allows the pathogen to penetrate the host cuticle and cell wall through the production of a penetration peg. After penetration, the pathogen produces infection vesicles which invaginate the cell membrane, and drain nutrients from the plant. Later in the pathogen's life cycle when the host's infected fruit or foliar flesh dies, the pathogen switches to the saprophytic life cycle to feed off of the dead tissue. Environment This pathogen grows best at temperatures between 25‚Äì30 ¬∞C, a humidity >95%, and a pH range of 5.8 to 6.5. Pathogenesis can occur at a temperature range as broad as 20‚Äì30 ¬∞C. Acervuli release spores only when an abundance of moisture is present, so C. gloeosporioides is inactive during the dry season. Direct sunlight, extreme temperatures on either side of the optimum range, and low humidity can all cause spores to become inactive. These three factors can either be extreme enough to cause spore inactivation single-handedly, or work in concert to have the same effect. Management Control methods can vary depending on hosts, but there are some general cultural practices that can be very useful for managing this pathogen. Because C. gloeosporioides spores are spread by rain splash, avoiding overhead irrigation can be helpful. If the operation is small enough the grower might want to consider an overhead covering to avoid rainfall all together. Pruning and thinning out of vegetative material can provide extra airflow, preventing high moisture conditions necessary for disease propagation. Also, to insure a healthy crop to begin with, growers should propagate using only certified, disease free stock.Coates, Lindy, Tony Cooke, and Leif Forsberg. \\"The Biology and Management of Colletotrichum Diseases in Production Nurseries.\\" Nursery Production Plant Health & Biosecurity Project. Horticulture Australia, n.d. Web. 7 Dec. 2016. To prevent post-harvest storage rot, fruit are often subjected to hot water dips or wax coatings. While these methods have been shown to decrease disease incidence, they are not a very efficacious solution for the prevention of post-harvest C. gloeosporioides infection. In terms of chemical control, broad spectrum, protectant fungicides such as chlorothalinil or mancozeb can be applied at the beginning of the growth season to prevent infection. Frequently once fruit have begun to grow, any further fungicide applications simply mask symptoms until post-harvest. During post-harvest treatment, harvested fruit are often coated with fungicides such as phenols or benzimidazoles to further protect against storage rot, especially on fruit being shipped overseas.Pandey, Ashutosh, L.

Sited at Marine Park along the Navesink River, the festival was in operation between 1987 and 2016. Organized during some of this time by the non-profit Jersey Shore Jazz & Blues Foundation, the festival typically ran from Friday late afternoon through Sunday late afternoon, and according to varying estimates attracted some 80,000 to 150,000 people over the three days.\\"Jazz fest kicks off summer\\", Asbury Park Press, May 31, 2007.

History Music was presented on the main Marina Stage as well as the smaller Harbor Experience or Riverfront Stage. Beginning in the late 2000s, a third stage showcased local and youth artists. Numerous vendors of foods and wares surrounded the music area, which was a short stroll from Red Bank's Broad Street center. The event grew out of, and then somewhat co-existed with, the International Food Festival, which had been in operation since around 1980 with the purpose of showcasing the efforts of local restaurants while featuring some music as well.Karen DeMasters. \\"Music as Close as Boards or the Beach\\", The New York Times, May 14, 2000.

The novel was published to much acclaim, and was shortlisted for the 2003 Gold Dagger for Best Crime Novel of the Year. Plot summary It is Holy Week in Seville ‚Äì Semana Santa, the Easter week of passion and processions. A leading restaurateur is found bound, gagged and dead in front of his television set. The self-inflicted wounds tell of the man's struggle to avoid the unendurable images he has been forced to watch. When confronted by this horrific scene the normally cool and dispassionate homicide detective, Inspector Jefe Javier Falc√≥n, is inexplicably afraid. He looks into the victim's ruined face and asks himself: 'What could be so terrible?' The investigation into the restaurateur's turbulent life sends Falc√≥n trawling through his own past and the ferociously candid journals of his late father, a world-famous artist. Painful revelations churn up Falc√≥n's unreliable memory and more killings push him to the edge of terrifying truth. And he realizes that this is not just the hunt for an all-seeing murderer who knows his victim's secret lives, but also the search for Falc√≥n's own missing heart.

The group, which consisted of over one hundred people, centered on Hans Steinbr√ºck, an escaped concentration camp prisoner. Its members included young people, including teens active in the local Edelweiss Pirates group, escaped detainees from forced labor camps, and Jews. On November 10, 1944, thirteen members of the group were publicly hanged in Cologne. Background Largely destroyed by Allied bombings, the district of Ehrenfeld, Cologne was a sanctuary for enemies of the Nazi regime, including escaped prisoners, forced laborers, deserters, and Jews. Steinbr√ºck, who escaped from a concentration subcamp in Cologne in July 1943, came to Ehrenfeld and met a woman who took him in. He began to stockpile weapons and foodstuffs in the cellar of a bombed-out house and stayed in close contact with escaped forced laborers, Communists, and criminals, with whom he did business, fencing stolen goods. His nickname was \\"Black Hans\\".Klas Ewert Everwyn. \\"'Edelwei√üpiraten' u. a.\\" (\\"Edelweiss Pirates and others\\") Die Zeit Online (Nov. 11, 1994) Retrieved April 1, 2010 \\"Die Ehrenfelder Steinbr√ºck-Gruppe fliegt auf\\" Cologne Museum official website. Retrieved April 1, 2010 The cellar also served as temporary shelter for Jews, deserters and others who had gone into hiding. Ruins from bombing, Cologne, 1943 In the summer of 1944, a number of young people, including teenagers, came into contact with Steinbr√ºck. Although being 23 and quite young himself, Steinbr√ºck could easily function as a father figure for some due to the massive rise in the number of orphans in those years. Some of the teenagers had already been Edelweiss Pirates and they began to form a core group around Steinbr√ºck. The activities of the group began to gain momentum. They stole food and vehicles and sold goods on the black market. Later, they bought guns. As the group expanded, so did the number and scope of the thefts. One particular heist was the Butterraub, the butter robbery. The first time, they stole a few quintals of butter, selling it afterward on the black market for 12,000 reichmarks, at a time when the average wage was 50 reichmarks a week. The second time, they stole 26 quintals of butter and got 123,000 marks for it. Several people, mostly Communists, but also some young people, left Steinbr√ºck over this because the activity drew attention and they felt Steinbr√ºck's behavior was reckless, increasing the risk of arrest.  Denouement and conclusion  During a general identification check on September 29, 1944, an army patrol was informed about the group's cellar warehouse. The patrol searched the basement rooms and confiscated numerous weapons. Steinbr√ºck and a Russian forced laborer were able to escape, but the next day, the criminal police searched the apartment where Steinbr√ºck had been staying, arresting the woman whose place it was. Two Jewish women who were in hiding in the building were also arrested. In order to arrest the fugitives, the police posted a guard in front of the house. On the run, Steinbr√ºck met a deserter, Roland Lorent, who had just killed a local Nazi leader and was also looking to hide. The two teamed up and conceived a plan to go on a \\"Nazi hunt\\". They stole bicycles and gathered weapons. They collected a few teenaged members of the group and went to get Cilli, Steinbr√ºck's girlfriend, but without having investigated the situation at her place. When they got there, they found a police guard. Both Steinbr√ºck and Lorent opened fire, seriously injuring the guard. A member of the SA, riding toward them on a bicycle, was also killed, as was a man wearing boots, who they assumed was a Nazi. Later, they went to an embankment by the train tracks to wait. While there, they fired into a group of people, killing a member of the Hitler Youth. That evening, they tried to steal some explosives, but the guard on duty foiled their efforts. On October 3, 1944, Lorent was arrested. On October 8, 1944, the Gestapo began arresting members of the group, and finally, Steinbr√ºck as well. By October 15, they had had made 63 arrests, including 19 teenagers. Of those, thirteen German males, including several teenagers, were executed without trial in a public hanging next to the Ehrenfeld train station on November 10, 1944. Steinbr√ºck described the goals of his group to the Gestapo as, > He and his accomplices would have done everything possible to end the war as > soon as possible to the detriment of Germany. This is the reason we had the > weapons cache. The factories necessary to the war effort and train routes > were to be blown up, to bring the front closer. The most recent members of > our hard-scrabble club knew of these plans and supported them.  List of the executed  Steinbr√ºck and twelve of his followers were executed without trial on November 10, 1944, in front of hundreds of curious onlookers. Among the victims were six teenagers, members of the Edelweiss Pirates: * Hans Steinbr√ºck, born April 12, 1921, age 23 * G√ºnther Schwarz, born August 26, 1928, age 16 * Gustav Bermel, born August 11, 1927, age 17 * Johann M√ºller, born January 29, 1928, age 16 * Franz Rheinberger, born February 22, 1927, age 17 * Adolf Sch√ºtz, born January 3, 1926, age 18 * Barthel Schink, born November 25, 1927, age 16 * Roland Lorent, born March 12, 1920, age 24 * Peter H√ºppeler, born January 9, 1913, age 31 * Josef Moll, born July 17, 1903, age 41 * Wilhelm Kratz, born January 6, 1902, age 42 * Heinrich Kratina, born January 15, 1906, age 38 * Johann Krausen, born January 10, 1887, age 57  Legacy  A plaque in Ehrenfeld honors the memory of those executed there on October 25, 1944, and November 10, 1944.

It is used to treat onychomycosis (fungal infection of the toe- and fingernails). Amorolfine 5% nail lacquer in once-weekly or twice-weekly applications has been shown in two studies to be between 60% and 71% effective in treating toenail onychomycosis; complete cure rates three months after stopping treatment (after six months of treatment) were 38% and 46%. However, full experimental details of these trials were not available and since they were first reported in 1992 there have been no subsequent trials. It is a topical solution for the treatment of toenail infections. Systemic treatments may be considered more effective. It is approved for sale over-the-counter in Australia, Brazil, Russia, Germany and the UK, and is approved for the treatment of toenail fungus by prescription in other countries. It is not approved for the treatment of onychomycosis in the United States or Canada, but can be ordered from there by mail from other countries.It can readily be verified that Curanail is advertised on websites such as US Amazon.com, shipped from abroad.

Constantine's football career started during World War II. He served in the Grenadier Guards, playing for local team Ashton National in his spare time. In 1944 he received an offer of a professional football contract at Rochdale. Three months later he joined Manchester City, playing his first Manchester City match in September 1945. At this time competitive league football was still suspended, though the FA Cup took place. Constantine scored 4 Cup goals and 25 in the Football League North to be the club's highest scorer in 1945‚Äì46. When competitive league returned in 1946, Constantine scored 12 goals in 18 games, including a hat-trick against Millwall. Injuries then limited his first-team opportunities, and he was transferred to Bury, where he scored 14 goals in 32 matches. In the 1948 close season he signed for Millwall in a part exchange deal which saw Bob Kelly go to Bury. He made his debut against Port Vale on 21 August 1948, and subsequently played for Millwall for four seasons, finishing as the club's top goalscorer in three of them. One of the most outstanding games Constantine played for The Lions was on 23 October 1948 against Notts County at The Den where a crowd of 46,000 had gathered to watch the great Tommy Lawton. Millwall and Constantine played brilliantly and won the game 3 - 2 with Constantine netting a brace. The newspaper headlines the following day read: \\"Constantine Shows Lawton How To Head.\\" He made 153 appearances for The Lions, scoring 80 goals, and is fifth on Millwall's all-time leading scorer list. Constantine remained a Millwall supporter, and was a regular in the Duke of Albany pub, in New Cross where he mixed freely with The Lions fans, sharing a joke and happily signing autographs until his death which was due to stomach cancer in 1998.

It honored musical achievement of 2007 in which albums were released between October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2007. The primary ceremonies were televised in the US on CBS; however, as has become the custom, most of the awards were handed out during a pre-telecast portion of the show held at the Los Angeles Convention Center and broadcast on XM Satellite Radio. Two nights prior to the show Aretha Franklin was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year. The year's big winner was Amy Winehouse: the 24-year-old singer had recently entered a drug rehabilitation program and did not come to Los Angeles. American officials initially refused her a work visa; they reversed the decision, but by then it was too late for her to make the trip from the UK. She became the fifth female solo artist to get five awards in one night, alongside Lauryn Hill, Norah Jones, Alicia Keys, Beyonc√© and later, Alison Krauss and Billie Eilish. The golden anniversary of the Grammys and NARAS was noted in references and performances throughout this year's ceremony. Alicia Keys was the evening's opening musician, singing and playing piano alongside archived video and audio of Frank Sinatra. Other collaborative performances linking contemporary and past musicians included Beyonc√© with Tina Turner, Rihanna with The Time, classical pianist Lang Lang with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and inaugural Grammy winner Keely Smith with Kid Rock. Special recognition of the musical contributions of The Beatles also featured.

Douglas Fir are used as Christmas trees and the aesthetic value can be decreased from R. pseudotsugae. The symptoms first appear as small yellow spots on current season needles in the fall/winter. In the spring the discolored areas on the needle expand and can spread to the whole needle, however bands of discoloration are often formed.

Signs of Rhabdocline pseudotsugae include apothecia that mature below epidermis where swelling is visible. These fruiting bodies are present on the underside of needles. In spring a split develops and exposes the orange brown surface of fungal body. Infection New infections start in the spring or early summer and conditions that cause prolonged needle wetness promote heavier outbreaks.Hagle, Susan K., et al., A Field Guide to Diseases & Insect Pests of Northern & Central Rocky Mountain Conifers, \\"{deadlink} Rhabdocline Needle Cast,\\"United States Forest Service, 2003, p. 112.

The fungus Rhabdocline pseudotsugae have apothecia that are normally first produced on the under side of the needles, but it's not uncommon to find them on the top surface too. They are first produced as rounded cushions and as the epidermal layer ruptures, a brown elongated disc is exposed. Needle drop occurs after the ascospores are discharged, normally resulting in only a one year life span for the fungus. Disease cycle Fruiting bodies mature in May/June on one year old needles. In high humidity the mature pseudothecia on the underside of the needles openOregon State Forest Disease Management Notes. https://www.oregon.gov/ODF/Documents/ForestBenefits/rhabdoclineneedlecast.pdf..

Once the pseudothecia turns dark brown, usually in June or July, spore production is done for the year. Needles that contain these fruiting bodies are cast from late spring to summer. Management The most ideal method of control/management is using resistant varieties. Resistant varieties include Shyswap and Pillar Lake, while Santa Fe, Silver Creek and Coville are only moderately resistantAdmin. ‚ÄúRhabdocline Needle Cast.‚Äù Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment, UMassAmherst, 8 Mar. 2018, https://ag.umass.edu/landscape/fact-sheets/rhabdocline-needle- cast.. Cultural control methods such as pruning unhealthy infected shoots and removing severely infected trees are common. It is important not to prune when foliage is wet and to sterilize tools by dipping in denatured alcohol for 3 minutes after shearing infected plantations. Trees should also be sheared in healthy plantations first to avoid contamination of these plantations by workers' clothing and equipment. Douglas-Fir also require full sun and if planted in a shaded area it can encourage needle blight development. Planting trees in dispersed rows, removing lowest canopy and avoiding cover planting reduces air flow which reduces high moisture conditions that promote infectionForestry Service.

Chemical control such as fungicides is common, but coverage of all canopy parts is required. Fungicides that can be used include copper hydroxide, copper sulfate, copper salts of fatty and / or rosin acids, mancozeb and thiophanate-methyl. It is also recommended that the trees be sprayed with chlorothalonil at 2 1/2 pounds per 100 gallons of water in hydraulic spray equipment or 5 1/2 pounds per 100 gallons in high-pressure mist blower. The first application should be made as soon as the trees start to break bud. Treatment should be repeated two to three times a week for two to three week intervals.

These three Caribbean brothers, hit musicians, authors, among others, of the global tube Cuba decide to open Le Baiser Sal√© and make it a Caf√©-Concert where you could have a drink while listening to a live band. A few months later, the formula changed with the only group that played every night gave way to a weekly program, quickly implemented by the current programmer Maria Rodriguez. These are the real beginnings of the JazzClub Le Baiser Sal√©. To develop the mixed music of creation and to go beyond the framework of the traditional jazz club, these were the objectives of the program of the Baiser Sal√© from January 84. It is a succession of groups much more jazz with a clear orientation towards jazz fusion, while called jazz rock, and a marked predilection for mixed music. From these crazy years will remember all the musician's exceptional talent spent in this small room that served as a springboard and that we now meet in the largest international festivals; from Richard Bona to Ang√©lique Kidjo via Monica Passos, Ultramarine, Les √âtoiles, Sylvain Luc, Rido Bayonne, Leni Stern, Thierry Eliez, Etienne Mbapp√©, Mario Canonge, Nguyen Le and many others, the list is long of those who heated our walls and our stage. It is the pride of Le Baiser Sal√© that having encouraged so many talents by betting on their then unknown names and it is our passion and pleasure to continue on this path so rewarding that sees the birth and recognition of the talents of tomorrow. It is also often during our jam sessions on Monday orchestrated by the percussionist Fran√ßois Constantin that many young instrumentalists find the opportunity to be noticed by the \\"sizes\\" and other old wolves who always prowl to the new musical sensations, and it is often around a glass that group projects are born after memorable oxen. Here, everything is allowed, jazz club yes, but not forgetting that jazz is born of miscegenation, all the experience is good and the programming gives pride to mixtures of culture, the only requirement required of the musicians: to ensure. Here musicians are free to create, to invent, to associate music that does not meet, to mix names that do not know each other, to try out groups from which magic can be born, it's here that CHIC HOT was born, ULTRAMARINE too.

The club was founded in 1896 as Cliftonville and was one of the founding members of the Ulster Hockey Union. The 1st XI currently plays in the Ulster Senior League. The first reported match was played against North Down at Comber in November 1896 where an eight-goal to nil loss was recorded. In 2018, the club changed its name to CIYMS. Grounds The club's origins lie in the Cliftonville area of north Belfast. The club played games at Solitude before finding a permanent home with the Cliftonville Cricket Club at the Cliftonville Cricket Ground on the other side of the Cliftonville Road. In late August 1972, the clubhouse was burned and looted during civil unrest. Physical intimidation prevented the members from entering the grounds. The club sought help without success from local and government authorities, in the hope that the club could be protected and assisted in the continue playing hockey and cricket at the ground. As a result, the club abandoned the ground and took up a nomadic existence.Belfast News-Letter The first grounds used in exile were the Girls' Model School pitches at Dunkeld Gardens. In 1981, the club moved to Boucher Road Playing Fields. Then, in 1986, the Boucher Playing Fields were closed and Cliftonville moved to the Queen's University pitches until taking over the tenancy of Belfast YMCA all-weather pitch at Bladon Drive in 1987. In 1992, the decision was made that all 1st XI home games would be played on the artificial pitch at the Olympia Leisure Centre.

The system is modular and can be mounted on almost any wheeled or tracked vehicle. It has for instance been demonstrated mounted on an M113 armoured personnel carrier. Normally the same vehicle carries both the main sensor and the main effector of the system. However, thanks to the systems modularity, it can also be delivered in a split configuration with one vehicle carrying the main sensor and several other vehicles carrying the missiles. The main sensor is Saab's (formerly Ericsson Microwave System) HARD AESA air search 3D radar with an instrumented range of 20 km or an Infra-red search and track, depending upon the customer's specifications. The effector is the latest version of the Saab Bofors Dynamics RBS 70 surface-to-air missile, called Bolide. The missile is a laser guidance beam riding short range missile equipped with a highly effective proximity fuze. It is supposed to be effective against cruise missiles. Each unit is equipped with four ready-to-fire missiles and an optical day and night sight to continually point the laser beam at the target. This means the system makes use of ACLOS type of guidance. Since the laser receiver is located at the back of the missile the system is practically immune to jamming but the method can be hampered by very low-visibility atmospheric conditions. Finland placed the first order in August 2002. The Finnish systems are mounted on Sisu Nasus (four units) and Mercedes-Benz Unimog 5000 L/38 4x4s (12 units).

He played for the New York GiantsGannon, Jack. 1981. Deaf Heritage‚ÄìA Narrative History of Deaf America, Silver Spring, Maryland: National Association of the Deaf, p. 271 (PDF ) and Cleveland Bronchos and was one of the key pitchers on the Giants' National League championship teams of 1904 and 1905. In 1901, his first full season in the major leagues, Taylor led the National League by pitching in 45 games and ranked second in the league with 37 complete games. In 1904, he won 21 games for the Giants, and in 1906 his 2.20 earned run average was the lowest on a pitching staff that included Baseball Hall of Famers Christy Mathewson (2.97), and \\"Iron Man\\" Joe McGinnity (2.25). Taylor was the only successful deaf pitcher in Major League Baseball and was regarded, along with Dummy Hoy, as a role model and hero in the American deaf community in the early 20th century.Gannon, Jack. 1981. Deaf Heritage‚ÄìA Narrative History of Deaf America, Silver Spring, Maryland: National Association of the Deaf, pp. 291-294 (PDF )(PDF )(PDF ) In the 1900s, Taylor was reported to be the highest paid deaf person in the United States. He was also known as the comedian of the Giants teams, waving a lit lantern when an umpire refused to call a game due to darkness and coaching at third base in rubber boots when an umpire refused to call a game due to rain. In 2000, author Darryl Brock wrote the historical novel Havana Heat about Taylor's experience in professional baseball. The book won the Dave Moore Award in 2000 as the \\"most important baseball book\\" published that year.Elysian Fields Quarterly website  Early years  Taylor was born in Oskaloosa, Kansas in 1875. He was the son of Arnold B. Taylor, a farmer, and his wife, Emaline (Chatman) Taylor. At the time of the 1880 United States Census, Taylor was living in rural Jefferson County, Kansas with his parents, two older brothers, and two older sisters. Some accounts indicate Taylor was born deaf. However, at age four, Taylor was not listed as being \\"deaf and dumb\\" or otherwise handicapped in the family's U.S. Census record.Census entry for Arnold B. Taylor and family, including Luther H.

Taylor continued to live at the Kansas School for the Deaf through his high school years. He was a pitcher for the school baseball team and also participated in boxing.

Semi-pro and minor league baseball  After leaving the Kansas School for the Deaf, Taylor began playing semi-pro baseball with a team in Nevada, Missouri. He then played at Lincoln, Illinois, and with minor league teams in Wabash, Crawfordsville, Danville and Terre Haute, Indiana. In 1897, he played for a minor league team in Mattoon, Illinois. He played for the Shreveport Tigers of the Southern League in 1898 and 1899. In 1900, Taylor began the season playing for Albany, New York. At the time of the U.S. Census in June 1900, Taylor was residing at a boarding house in Albany; his occupation was listed as a printer.Census entry for Luther Taylor, age 24, born in Kansas.

Major League Baseball  = First stint with Giants = In August 1900, Taylor was called up to the major leagues to play for the New York Giants. He made his major league debut on August 28, 1900. In his first game for the Giants, five Boston players tried to take advantage of Taylor's deafness by trying to steal third base. Interviewed in 1942, Taylor recalled with pride, \\"I nailed each one. I walked over to (Herman) Long, the last man caught, and let him know by signs I could hear him stealing.\\" Appearing in 11 games for the 1900 Giants, Taylor compiled a 4‚Äì3 record with a 2.45 earned run average. In his second season in the major leagues, Taylor was a workhorse for the 1901 Giants. He led the National League with 43 games started and by appearing in a total of 45 games. He also ranked second in the league with 37 complete games, innings pitched, and 1,518 batters faced. Despite maintaining a respectable 3.18 earned run average, Taylor played for a weak-hitting Giants team that finished 7th out of 8 teams in hits and runs produced. With the absence of run support, Taylor finished the season with a win-loss record of 18‚Äì27. His 27 losses in 1901 is tied for the second most given up by any pitcher in Major League Baseball during the 20th century (trailing Vic Willis's 29 losses in 1905). = Cleveland Bronchos = In March 1902, Taylor signed for more money with the Cleveland Bronchos of the American League. He recalled that American League teams were \\"waving big money at us\\" in the winter before the 1902 season. Taylor appeared in four games for the Bronchos, all as a starter. Despite a 1.59 earned run average, Taylor again suffered from a lack of run support and compiled a record of 1‚Äì3 in Cleveland. = Second stint with Giants = In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman to persuade Taylor to return to the Giants. Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was pitching and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing. Taylor recalled: > Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching > mound he kept talking to me with his fingers. I kept shaking my head \\"No\\", > and Frank kept boosting the money. Soon, I nodded my head \\"Yes\\", and that > night I was on my way back to New York with Frank. Taylor appeared in 26 games for the 1902 Giants and had 22 complete games. Taylor's 7‚Äì15 record for the 1902 Giants was again the result of playing for a remarkably weak-hitting team, as the 1902 Giants finished in last place in runs, hits and batting average. Even Christy Mathewson, who was Taylor's teammate on the 1902 Giants, registered a losing record in 1902 with an earned run average of 2.12 that was only marginally better than Taylor's. In 1903, John McGraw took over as the manager of the Giants. McGraw quickly turned the Giants into one of the best teams in the National League, with Taylor, Mathewson, and Iron Man Joe McGinnity as his pitching stars. Taylor had his most successful season in 1904. With strong support from a Giants team that finished first in the National League in runs and hits, Taylor compiled a 21‚Äì15 record in 1904. He was among the National League leaders that year with 21 wins (4th), five shutouts (3rd), 1.033 walks plus hits per inning pitched (5th), 136 strikeouts (6th), and a .991 fielding percentage (2nd). In 1905, Taylor helped lead the Giants to their second consecutive National League pennant. Taylor appeared in 32 games and compiled a record of 16‚Äì9 with a 2.66 earned run average. Taylor was scheduled to pitch in the third game of the 1905 World Series, but the game was cancelled because of rain, and Christy Mathewson pitched with an extra day of rest when the Series resumed. (Mathewson pitched three complete-game shutouts in the 1905 World Series.) Although the Giants fell short of a third consecutive pennant in 1906, Taylor had another strong year, compiling a 17‚Äì9 record and a 2.20 earned run average. His earned run average that year was the lowest on a pitching staff that included Hall of Famers Christy Mathewson (2.97) and Joe McGinnity (2.25). Taylor also ranked 6th in the National League with a .654 winning percentage in 1906. In 1907, Taylor went 11‚Äì7 with a 2.42 earned run average and a 1.117 walks plus hits per inning pitched. He pitched his final major league season in 1908, compiling an 8‚Äì5 record with a 2.33 earned run average. = Minor leagues = Taylor's baseball card from his time on the Bisons (T206 set) In February 1909, Taylor was sold to the Buffalo Bisons in the Eastern League. He won 32 games for Buffalo in 1909 and 1910 and played in the minor leagues from 1909 to 1915. In his final season of organized baseball, he compiled an 18‚Äì11 record for the Utica Utes in the New York State League. = Overall record = In nine seasons in the major leagues, Taylor compiled an overall win-loss record of 116‚Äì106 and 767 strikeouts. He threw 237 complete games and 21 shutouts. He had a career earned run average of 2.75 and a career walks plus hits per inning pitched of 1.267. = Deafness = Taylor was born profoundly deaf and communicated on-field with his teammates in sign language. He is credited with helping to expand and make universal the use of sign language throughout the modern baseball infield, including but not limited to the use of pitching signs. According to Sean Lahman in his biography of Taylor, \\"The Giants didn't just add Taylor to their roster; they embraced him as a member of the family. Player-manager George Davis learned sign language and encouraged his players to do the same. John McGraw did likewise when he took over as Giants manager in July 1902.\\" In Lawrence Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Taylor's teammate, Fred Snodgrass, recalled: > We could all read and speak the deaf-and-dumb sign language, because Dummy > Taylor took it as an affront if you didn't learn to converse with him. He > wanted to be one of us, to be a full-fledged member of the team. If we went > to the vaudeville show, he wanted to know what the joke was, and somebody > had to tell him. So we all learned. We practiced all the time. During his eight seasons in Major League Baseball, Taylor's success won acclaim in the deaf press, including The Silent Worker, and he became a role model and hero for the deaf community. An article in The Saturday Evening Post noted that \\"wherever Taylor goes he will always be visited by scores of the silent fraternity among whom he is regarded as a prodigy.\\" On May 16, 1902, Taylor pitched against Dummy Hoy in Cincinnati, Ohio. The occasion was reported to be \\"the first and only time two deaf professional athletes competed against one another.\\" When Hoy came to bat for the first time, he signed to Taylor, \\"I'm glad to see you.\\" Hoy collected two hits off Taylor, but Taylor got the win as the Giants beat the Reds 5‚Äì3. Taylor's nickname, \\"Dummy\\", was commonly applied to \\"deaf and dumb\\" baseball players in the late 19th and early 20th century. Dummy Dundon and Dummy Hoy were the first professional baseball players to receive the appellation. Others include Dummy Deegan, Dummy Leitner, Dummy Lynch, Dummy Murphy and Dummy Stephenson. Although he accepted the nickname in his playing days, Taylor noted in a 1945 interview that he and Dummy Hoy did not care for the nickname: \\"In the old days Hoy and I were called Dummy. It didn't hurt us. It made us fight harder.\\" Taylor's popularity led to an outcry in the deaf press against the use of the nickname. Alexander Pach wrote an editorial in The Silent Worker in which he protested: \\"The highest salaried deaf man in the United States is the much heralded Dummy Taylor‚ÄîI say Dummy only to serve to show how contemptible the epithet looks.\\" Taylor was inducted into the American Athletic Association of the Deaf Hall of Fame in 1953. He was also inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2006. = Reputation for clowning = Taylor also developed a reputation as the clown on the Giants' team of the 1900s. In April 1905, The New York Times wrote about Taylor's efforts to maintain a light atmosphere in the Giants' locker room. The Times described Taylor's post-shower wrestling matches with Frank Bowerman and his displays of the Japanese martial art, jiu- jitsu, adding: > The \\"Dummy\\" is always smiling. No matter whether in the dressing room or on > the practice field he is the clown of the crowd. If a joke is told he makes > Bowerman repeat it to him with his fingers. Then he emits a cacophonous > cackle that passes for a laugh. \\"It is a good thing Taylor can't tell > stories\\", remarked McGraw one morning, \\"or I never should be able to get any > work out of you fellows.\\" On one occasion, Taylor disagreed with the decision by umpire Bill Klem not to call the game as darkness fell. Taylor returned to the clubhouse and came back onto the field wearing a fireman's oilskin and holding a lit lantern above his head. Klem yelled at Taylor to get off the field, but Taylor could not hear and continued with his antics until Klem finally called the game. Honus Wagner later wrote about a game in which the Giants were complaining about the umpire's refusal to suspend a game due to rain. Wagner wrote, \\"So Dummy Taylor, one of the Giant pitchers, went out to the third base coaching lines in his hip boots and a raincoat. Then the umpire did get mad. He chased Taylor out of the park, and it was funny to see Dummy trying to explain to him that he shouldn't be ejected.\\" Taylor later recalled that the umpire, Johnston, \\"not only chased me, but declared the game forfeited to the other club.\\" Giants' manager McGraw kept Taylor in the dugout when he was not pitching to distract the opposing pitcher. Taylor was able to emit a \\"rattling shriek\\" just as the opposing pitcher was about to release a pitch. Teammate Mike Donlin compared the noise to the \\"crazed shrieking of a jackass.\\" Taylor biographer Sean Lahman wrote: \\"Umpire Charlie Zimmer once got so irritated with the shrill sound that he ejected Taylor, perhaps the only instance of a deaf player being tossed for being too noisy.\\" Taylor was also ejected from a baseball game by an umpire \\"for cursing him out in sign language.\\" According to some accounts, the umpire was Hank O'Day, who knew sign language. After Taylor's tirade, O'Day reportedly stepped in front of the plate and signed the following comments back at Taylor: \\"Listen, smart guy ... I've spent all my spare time this past week learning your language. You can't call me a blind bat any more. Now, go take a shower ... you're out of the game.\\" Aside from sign language, Taylor would let it be known that he disagreed with an umpire's call by holding his nose and spinning the second finger of his other hand near his temple, demonstrating his belief that the ump was screwy. In June 1905, umpire Hank O'Day ejected Taylor for hand gestures that he interpreted to be an accusation that \\"I had wheels in my head.\\" A press account described the scene: > He strode angrily toward O'Day, and the grandstand observed a lightning > movement of the hands. Mystic symbol followed mystic symbol, and the crowd > kept guessing, what it meant. Suddenly O'Day, too, strode forward and > majestically waved Mr. Taylor from the field. Still frantically making > rotary movements around his temples, \\"Dummy\\" dawdled away.\\" John McGraw recalled an occasion when he, too, was cursed out by Taylor: \\"In sign language, Dummy consigned me to the hottest place he could think of‚Äîand he didn't mean St. Louis.\\" Taylor was also an accomplished juggler and would often put on \\"a grand juggling act\\" in front of the Giants' dugout to amuse the fans.  Later years  After his retirement from baseball, Taylor returned to Olathe and the Kansas State School For the Deaf, where he worked as a teacher and coach. He also served as an umpire from 1915 to 1920, working games for the House of David and Union Giants. As of January 1914, he was the physical director at the Kansas School for the Deaf. At the time of the 1915 Kansas State Census, he was living in Olathe with his wife, Della M. (Ramsey) Taylor.Census entry for Luther H. Taylor, age 39, and Mrs. Della M. Taylor, age 33. Ancestry.com.

Taylor subsequently moved to Iowa where he worked as a coach at the Iowa School for the Deaf. At the time of the 1925 Iowa State Census, he was living at the Iowa School for the Deaf in Lewis Township, Pottawattamie County, Iowa.Census entry for Luther H. Taylor. Ancestry.com. Iowa State Census Collection, 1836‚Äì1925 [database on-line]. In 1927, several newspapers reported Taylor had died. Taylor issued a statement from his home in Iowa, emphatically denying he was dead. Taylor's statement resulted in headlines in papers across North America such as, \\"'Dummy' Taylor Denies being Dead.\\" It turned out Taylor had been confused with another deaf baseball pitcher, Lyman \\"Dummy\\" Taylor. At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Taylor was still living at the Iowa School for the Deaf. His occupation was listed as a coach, and he was listed as living with his wife, Della M. Taylor, a teacher at the school.Census entry for Luther H. Taylor and Della M. Taylor. Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Lewis, Pottawattamie, Iowa; Roll: 678; Page: 4B; Enumeration District: 45; Image: 871.0. Taylor later was employed at the Illinois School for the Deaf in Jacksonville, Illinois. When he was interviewed in 1942 for a feature story in The Sporting News, Taylor was employed as a coach and \\"house father\\" at the Illinois School for the Deaf. One of Taylor's pupils, Dick Sipek, went on to play baseball for the Cincinnati Reds. Having outlived his first wife, Della, who died in 1931, and second wife Lenora Borjquest, Taylor married for the third time to Lina Belle Davis from Little Rock, Arkansas in August 1941. Taylor also continued to be involved with professional baseball into the 1950s, umpiring local baseball games and doing scouting work for the Giants. In August 1958, Taylor died at Our Savior's Hospital in Jacksonville, Illinois. He was buried with his first wife, Della, at Prairie City Cemetery in Baldwin City, Kansas. He was the last surviving member of the 1905 World Champion New York Giants.  Cultural references  Taylor is used as the narrator and hero of Darryl Brock's fictional account of his later life, Havana Heat.

According to the 2016 Australian census, Burrawang's population was 361. Map with streets named It is situated high on a hill, 760m above sea level, midway between two reservoirs, the Wingecarribee and the Fitzroy. History Wool classing and sorting at the shearing sheds of Burrawong, circa 1900. At the time of white settlement in New South Wales, the Wadi Wadi tribe of Aborigines occupied the Burrawang (Yarrawa) area. The British naval surgeon Charles Throsby (1777‚Äì1828), became a settler in the colony in 1802 at the age of 31 and from 1804 served in the colonial medical establishment in the Newcastle area until 1809. He, along with his 58-year-old assistant Joseph Wild were mapping what is now known as the Moss Vale and Sutton Forest area and were commissioned to find an overland route from there to Jervis Bay as well as to plan and oversee the construction of a road to Goulburn Plains. Throsby became the first landowner in what is now the Southern Highlands area in 1819 developing a cattle station which is now a museum open for public inspection called Throsby Park just off the Illawarra Highway in Moss Vale. This extremely capable pioneer became a member of the Legislative Council in 1825. Surveyor Robert Hoddle and a gang of convicts cut a bridle path down the escarpment in 1830 as part of a track joining Cowpastures (Camden) to Kiama and Gerringong. Sometime during this era the natural attributes of the Yarrawa Brush region came to their attention with its exotic rain forest and rich volcanic soil. This later became public knowledge and in 1859 the first land grant was issued in what is now the pretty hamlet of Wildes Meadow (a derivative of the name Wild‚Äôs meadow). In 1865 the first post office was established at Burrawang, which was named after the native palm once plentiful in the area. Shortly thereafter came the first school, originally an Anglican establishment, which in 1876 was replaced by the first public school at the ‚ÄòOld School House‚Äô (now a private residence). In what is now Church Street the three churches were established around this time; Catholic 1875, Anglican 1886 and Presbyterian in 1888 (now a residential dwelling). Major industries at the time included dairying, potatoes, vegies plus flour and timber milling. Burrawang also had a newspaper; the Burrawang Herald and the hall boasted an active social calendar including an annual ball. Burrawang remained the major development in the Yarrawa Brush for some years but Robertson took over sometime in the late 1880s with the advent of a more direct road to Moss Vale the neighboring development of Robertson started to overtake as the key settlement in the region. Once Macquarie Pass was opened in 1898, Burrawang became somewhat isolated. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 361 people in Burrawang. 80.1% of people were born in Australia and 88.1% of people spoke only English at home. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 31.1%. Mythology of the Burrawang Bunyip There is a swamp outside the town that is home to the legendary Burrawang Bunyip. It is said to roam around at night. It is rumoured to kill cattle and if anyone wanted to capture the bunyip, it will disappear.

In common parlance, the term often relates to charges in respect of personal current accounts or checking account. These charges may take many forms, including: * monthly charges for the provision of an account * charges for specific transactions (other than overdraft limit excesses) * interest in respect of overdrafts (whether authorised or unauthorised by the bank) * charges for exceeding authorised overdraft limits, or making payments (or attempting to make payments) where no authorised overdraft exists Much of the following discussion relates to the UK personal current account market. Monthly account charges Banks may charge their customers a fixed monthly charge for the provision of the account. In the UK, this was not common practice until the 1990s when banks began to introduce this type of bank charges as a means of product differentiation - often offering additional services bundled with the bank account itself (e.g. travel insurance, mobile phone insurance, preferential rates on other products). Charges for specific transactions Until the 1980s, most banks in the UK charged for all transactions. A number of newer entrants to the personal current account market took a \\"no fees whilst in credit\\" approach, leading very rapidly to a situation where no bank could compete with others without offering the same deal. While the loss of income incurred was, to some extent, covered by the interest earned on carrying balances in current accounts, the banks' profitability on personal current accounts was severely impacted by this change in the charging structure. In turn this led to the banks' increased use of charges for exceeding overdraft limits as a means of generating their required level of profitability. Interest in respect of overdrafts Most banks charge interest to their customers in respect of overdrafts. It is common to charge differentially for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, with unauthorised overdrafts often bearing an interest rate two or three times higher than authorised ones. In order to gain customers from competitors, banks will sometimes offer introductory 0% or low interest rates on authorised overdrafts, together with generous initial overdraft limits. As part of the development of the personal current account market in the UK, certain banks have altered their overdraft charging structure to a fixed daily charge, irrespective of the size of the overdrawn balance. Charges for exceeding authorised overdraft limits As banks' income from transaction charges declined, due to the \\"free banking\\" that had become the de facto standard in the UK personal current account market and the banks' income from carrying balances fell due to declining interest rates, banks sought to increase the profitability of their businesses by significantly increasing the charges levied for exceeding authorised overdraft limits, or when customers make payments (or attempt to make payments), including direct debits, cheque payments or standing orders, where no authorised overdraft limit exists. Typically banks charged in the region of ¬£25 to ¬£39 for transactions in breach of an authorised overdraft limit, irrespective of the size of the transaction or the degree by which the limit was exceeded. These charges are commonly referred to as penalty charges, although penalty charges are explicitly forbidden under the law. Many individuals were able to retrieve money paid in such fees through the Magistrates' Courts on these grounds. However this has since been halted by the decision in the case OFT v Abbey. The High Court and Court of Appeal rules that these charges were not penal in nature, and the Supreme Court further ruled that they cannot be regulated by the Office of Fair Trading.  Transfer redirection charges  A Redirection of Transfer charge is included in bank charges and are only required on specific transfer occasions only. A redirection fee is a bank charge that is only paid to a bank when a mistake is made by another bank and a sum of amount is transferred into a wrong bank account in another bank. This may occur between continents, countries or states. A redirection fee is often expensive when required as the bank requiring this may not have legal rights to freeze the account the funds are mistakenly transferred into. It may also require urgent attention depending on the banking rules of the country and it takes a period of 30‚Äì45 minutes for a redirected transfer to be completed. This is normally caused in a Bank Wire Transfer, Telegraphic Transfer also known as Telex Transfer (T/T) and most times, local bank to bank transfer. A redirection fee is only needed to be paid to the bank the funds are in and the bank will have to redirect the transfer to its correct destination. Most banks calculate this type of bank charge according to the amount in question. A Redirection of Transfer charge is very important subject for the all banks. This is play vital role during the Transfer. These charges are apply by the all types of Banks. There is also include Nationalized Bank.

Murrill 1905) is a fungal plant pathogen that causes tree disease commonly known as \\"red ring rot\\" or \\"white speck\\". This disease, extremely common in the conifers of North America, decays tree trunks, rendering them useless for lumber.Red Ring Rot - Field Guide to Insects and Diseases of AZ and NM Forests It is a rot of the heartwood. Signs of the fungus include shelf-shaped conks protruding from the trunks of trees. Spores produced on these conks are blown by the wind and go on to infect other trees.Decays Formal management of this disease is limited, and the disease is controlled primarily by cultural practices. Red ring rot is an important forest disturbance agent and plays a key role in habitat formation for several forest animals.  Hosts and symptoms  Red ring rot is common in North America. The pathogen Phellinus pini is widely spread in the temperate zone in the Northern Hemisphere. It infects a wide range of coniferous trees, including jack pine, lodgepole pine, Sitka and white spruce, Douglas-fir, balsam and true fir, western hemlock, and tamarack.Red Ring Rot.Forest Disease Management Notes. It attacks both heartwood and sapwood and causes white pocket trunk rot. The basidiocarps (fruiting body), conks, are the most apparent signs on infected trees. The conks are perennial, usually gregarious, imbricate, and shelve-shaped, about 3 inches wide. The tops of conks are reddish brown to blackish with concentric furrows; the underside is yellow-brown, while for growing conks, the undersurface and margin of growing conks is a bright yellowish-brown with large irregular pores. White pockets usually develop where the conks develop, but the decay may extend 4 ft above and 5 ft below a conk. Decay tends to occur at the base of stem, but may also develop into large roots. In the early stage of decay, the affected wood becomes reddish to purplish in color. A cross section of the affected wood shows a well-defined ring. In advanced stages of decay, small, spindle-shaped white pockets are formed due to the degradation of lignin by P. pini. The white pockets are mostly hollow and delignified and contain white residual cellulose. Advanced decay has solid brown wood between white, spindle-shaped pockets. On Engelmann spruce P. pini is the most common pathogen to Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and causes the largest decay columns. There is red staining in the early stages and tends to develop along the annual rings. The decay can be identified with white pockets and punk knots (a slight swollen, resinous knot) and conks. Decay usually occurs mostly in the basal stem and may extend to roots. In cross section pini rot forms concentric rings in the heartwood.  Disease cycle  As other Polypores, basidiospores are produced on the underside of the conks and are spread by wind. These wind-blown spores are the initial inoculums of the red ring rot. Once they land on a suitable small wound or twig stub, the spores may germinate and the mycelia grow into the inner wood and cause infection. P. pini produces only one type of spores, basidiospores, which is also a type of sexual spores and the fungus overwinters as mycelium in diseased trees or dead trees. When decay is sufficient to provide enough resources, a new conk may be produced. Time from infection to conk production may be 10‚Äì20 years or more. These conks are perennial and the disease cycle can be repeated with spores produced by the new conks. Phellinus pini fruiting bodies.  Environment  There are several conditions that favor disease development and spread. Heart rot fungi, including P. pini, enter trees as mycelium or basidiospores through branch stubs, tree stumps, damaged roots, dead branches, and wounds in general and go on to infect the heartwood of the tree. Fire and cutting operations cause the most common points of entry for the fungus. Moist environments also facilitate fungal growth. Spores blown by the wind land and germinate on wounds, so in managed forests, care should be taken to prevent any injury to trees during harvest or other activities. This disease is most common in the Pacific Northwest, where cool wet weather greatly facilitates the pathogen.  Management  In most cases, complete elimination of red ring rot is not an objective, and some control is achieved by cultural practices. Since red ring rot is generally only a significant loss factor in very old stands, damage can be limited by managing stands to younger ages. Younger trees, if infected, are usually able to add new growth at a faster rate than that of decay. If a marketable tree is infected, it should be salvaged before disease progression significantly influences its value. Infected trees in public areas should be checked and removed if red ring rot disease has rendered them potentially dangerous (trees weakened due to heart rot are more likely to fall). Where timber management is the focus, infected trees should be removed. A reduction in rotation age should be considered if decay is frequent to minimize losses. Injuries to healthy trees should be avoided during logging to prevent new infections. During harvest, treating tree wounds and stumps with antagonistic fungi has led to considerable success in controlling decays and rot. After tree harvest, further discoloration and decay is controlled by treating wood with a chlorophenate fungicide or organic mercuric, in addition to drying the wood. Wood that may later be in contact with soil or other moist surfaces must be treated with a wood preservative.  Importance  Red ring rot is one of the most common and destructive heart rot pathogens in the Western United States. In Engelmann spruce it is the most common type of fungal decay and causes the largest decay columns of all the fungal heart rots, rendering the tree useless for harvesting. It is a particularly important disease in lodgepole pine and subalpine fir as well. Studies have shown that 64% of all defects in these three species were caused by Phellinus pini. It has been estimated that over three-fourths of the total 17% of decayed, overmature Douglas-fir is the Pacific Northwest were in decline due to red ring rot. Apart from the economic impacts of this disease, red ring rot decay may lead to mechanical failure of live trees, which may cause a potential hazard in recreational or public areas. It is also important to note the potentially positive ramifications of this fungus. P. pini and other trunk rot fungi serve an important role in forest ecosystems as disturbance agents, and play a key role in accelerating stand development. P. pini and other forest pathogens have been shown to be instrumental in facilitating Douglas-fir growth in the western US. Additionally, decayed trees, rotting from the inside-out, serve as important habitat to cavity-nesting birds and mammals. In the southeastern United States, this fungus is important for the nesting of the red-cockaded woodpecker. The species is not edible.

Overview Symptoms of fungal infection are readily recognized when timber is cut because a brown stain will appear on the butt cut. In early stages it will be just a spot in the heart wood, but as the disease advances it will extend most of the way around the heart wood, and in extreme cases may result in a hollow stump. Usually it is not observed more than a few feet above ground level.

Grove Music Online  Biography  Weigl was born in Vienna, the son of a bank official who was also a keen amateur musician. Alexander Zemlinsky took him as a private pupil in 1896. Weigl went to school at the Franz-Joseph-Gymnasium and graduated from there in 1899. After that, he continued his studies at the Vienna Music Academy, where he became a composition pupil of Robert Fuchs, and also enrolled at the University of Vienna, studying musicology under Guido Adler, with Anton Webern as his classmate. At the Vienna Hofoper between 1904 and 1906 he served as a rehearsal conductor for Gustav Mahler. In 1930 he was appointed professor of theory and composition at the University of Vienna, where he succeeded Hans Gal. When the Nazis occupied Austria in 1938, Weigl's music could no longer be performed. He emigrated to the United States of America, together with his second wife, the composer and music therapist Vally Weigl (n√©e Pick), and their son. There, he obtained a number of increasingly important teaching posts: at the Hartt School of Music, at Brooklyn College, at the Boston Conservatory and, from 1948 on, at the Philadelphia Academy of Music. Weigl often appeared as a soloist and also played four-handed with his wife. He died in New York after a prolonged battle with bone marrow cancer. Weigl's music, which was admired by Mahler, Schoenberg and Strauss, shows the influence of Brahms, with an emphasis on polyphony. His works include six symphonies,Karl Weigl: Symphonies 4 and 6, reviewed by MusicWeb, several concertos, chamber music pieces including eight string quartets, many songs (lieder in the tradition of Wolf and Mahler) and solo piano works.Karl Weigl: Leider and Chamber Music, reviewed by MusicWeb His only opera, Der Rattenf√§nger von Hameln, premiered in Vienna in 1932.http://opera.stanford.edu/composers/W.html  Works (Selection) = Symphonies = * Symphony No. 1 in E major, Op. 5 (1908) * Symphony No. 2 in D minor, Op. 19 (1922) * Symphony No. 3 (1931) * Symphony No. 4 in F minor (1936) * Symphony No. 5, \\"Apocalyptic Symphony\\" (1945) * Symphony No. 6 in A minor (1947) = Orchestral works = * Der 71.

The complex adjoins the right, southern bank about downstream of the Weir Hotel. The complex is two locks, old and new, and a narrow concrete divide, which are downstream of the original lock built in 1812. The older, hand-operated, was originally built in 1856, seldom used. The newer was opened in 1927 by Lord Desborough. Rollers and a slope adjoins for the portage (hauling) of small boats. The lock adjoins Sunbury Lock Ait. The lock has three associated weirs, upstream. The main weir is between Sunbury Lock Ait and Wheatley's Ait (north); the latter has two other weirs, one is a small part-time storm weir. History The earliest major weir locally was built in 1789 specifically to divert water to create a deeper channel for navigation. Other such weirs locally were in place since medieval times because of many shoals and flats in the Sunbury, in the period of Old London Bridge (1209-1831) which caused much silting downstream the river locally had minor tidal effects. The first plan for a lock was in 1805 with an ambitious lock cut. A modified scheme in 1809 resulted in the first lock, later removed, built close to the footbridge to Sunbury Lock Ait, where its lock house of the same year survives. The associated long cut above the lock expanded a natural channel beside the island known as Church Island and the lock was opened in 1812. The lock had become dilapidated by 1852 and the arrival of water companies planning major water extraction from the section of the river below the lock added an incentive for rebuilding it. The lock was moved downstream and opened in 1856; a new lock house was built.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles In 1927 a second lock was added at Sunbury, which was opened by Lord Desborough, then president of the Thames Conservancy.

This saprobic fungus causes white rot. Taxonomy The fungus was originally described by French botanist Jean Bulliard in 1785 as Boletus unicolor, when all pored fungi were typically assigned to genus Boletus. William Alphonso Murrill transferred it to Cerrena in 1903. The fungus has acquired a long and extensive synonymy as it has been re-described under many different names, and been transferred to many polypore genera. Description Pore surface magnified Cerrena unicolor has fruit bodies that are semicircular, wavy brackets up to 10 centimeters (4 in) wide. Attached to the growing surface without a stalk (sessile), the upper surface is finely hairy, white to grayish brown in color, and in zonate‚Äîmarked with zones or concentric bands of color. The surface is often green from algal growth. The pore surface is whitish in young specimens, later turning gray in maturity. The arrangement of the pores resembles a maze of slots; the tubes may extend to 4 mm deep. The spore print is white. When a female wasp of the genus Tremex bores into wood near these fungi, spores will become trapped in the wasp's ovipositor. The spores are carried with the wasp's eggs and will eventually germinate where the eggs are placed. As the spores germinate and form a mycelium, the wasp's eggs will hatch, and the newly-born larvae eat the mycelium. The wasp species Tremex columba requires C. unicolor to grow, as without the interaction, the larvae will die. However, after these eggs are laid, the parasitic wasp genus Megarhyssa will lay its own eggs within the eggs of the Tremex wasp. The larvae of Megarhyssa, when hatched, proceeds to eat the larvae of Tremex, helping control the population of Tremex. Spores are elliptical in shape, smooth, hyaline, inamyloid, and have dimensions of 5‚Äì7 by 2.5‚Äì4 ¬µm. Ecology Cerrena unicolor causes canker rot and decay in paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum). The fungus has a wide distribution, and is found in Asia, Europe, South America, and North America. It is inedible to humans. Applications Cerrena unicolor has been identified as a source of the enzyme laccase. This enzyme has potential applications in a wide variety of bioprocesses.

A plant pathogen, it causes a white rot of injured hardwoods, especially willows. The fruit bodies are semicircular and tough, have a concentrically zoned brownish upper surface, and measure up to in diameter. The whitish underside turns gray-brown as the fruit body ages, but bruises pink or red. It is found all year and is common in northern temperate woodlands of eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. The species was first described from Europe in 1791 as a form of Boletus, and has undergone several changes of genus in its taxonomic history. It acquired its current name when Joseph Schr√∂ter transferred it to Daedaleopsis in 1888.  Taxonomy  Daedaleopsis confragosa was first described scientifically under the name Boletus confragosus by English naturalist James Bolton, in his 1791 work An History of Fungusses, growing about Halifax. He reported finding specimens on old trees near Fixby Hall, and having specimens sent to him from Darlington. The species has been shuffled between several genera in its taxonomic history: Daedalea by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801; Trametes by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst in 1844; Polyporus by Paul Kummer in 1871; Stigila by Otto Kuntze in 1891; Lenzites by Patouillard in 1900; Agaricus by William Alphonso Murrill in 1905; and Ischnoderma by Ivan Zmitrovich in 2001. It was transferred to its current genus, Daedaleopsis, by German mycologist Joseph Schr√∂ter in 1888. D. confragosa is the type species of the genus Daedaleopsis. Several varieties have been described. L. Ljubarskii published var. bulliardi and var. rubecens in 1975. Both of these varieties were published invalidly are not considered to have independent taxonomic significance: variety rubescens is folded into synonymy with the main variety, while variety bulliardi is now considered synonymous with Trametes suaveolens. Variety tricolor, proposed by Appollinaris Semenovich Bondartsev and Rolf Singer in 1953, is now the independent species Daedaleopsis tricolor. Bondartsev described the form sibirica in 1953, but this is also no longer independent. The polypore has acquired several vernacular names, including \\"thin-maze flat polypore\\", \\"thin walled maze polypore\\", \\"blood-stained bracket\\", and \\"blushing bracket\\". The latter name refers to its characteristic bruising reaction. James Bolton referred to it as the \\"rugged boletus\\". Description Bruising reaction on pore surface The shelflike or bracketlike fruit body is fan-shaped to semicircular, and typically measures in diameter, and up to thick. Its upper surface is broadly convex to flat, dry, smooth to somewhat hairy, and usually has concentric zone lines. Its color ranges from reddish brown to brown to grayish, sometimes becoming blackish in maturity. The cap surface may have an umbo at the point of attachment to the substrate. Fruit bodies are leathery to corky when moist, but become hard and rigid when dry. The flesh is white to pinkish to brownish and tough. The underside of the fruit bodies features tiny pores measuring about 0.5‚Äì1.5 mm in diameter. They are white to tan to brown, but will develop pinkish or reddish tones if bruised. Pore shape is highly variable, ranging from circular to elongated, to mazelike, to gill-like. The tubes are up to long. The fruit body lacks a stalk, as the shelf attaches directly to the substrate. The inedible fruit bodies have no distinctive odor and a slightly bitter taste. The spore print is white; spores are cylindrical, smooth, and measure 7‚Äì11 by 2‚Äì3 Œºm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have a shape ranging from cylindrical to club-shaped, and dimensions of 20‚Äì40 by 3‚Äì5 Œºm. The hymenium features numerous hyphidia (modified terminal hyphae), which measure 2‚Äì3 Œºm. The hyphal system of Daedaleopsis confragrosa is trimitic, meaning that there are three types of hyphae in the fruit body: skeletal hyphae, which provide structural support, are thick walled, measuring 3‚Äì7 Œºm in diameter; generative hyphae, responsible for new growth, can be either thin- or thick-walled, may contain clamps, and measure 2‚Äì6 Œºm; binding hyphae, thick-walled and much branched, are 2‚Äì5 Œºm. The polypore is used in ornamental paper making, whereby the fruit bodies are pulped, pressed, and dried to produce sheets with unusual textures and colors. =Similar species= Cerrena unicolor (formerly Daedalea unicolor) is a common polypore species with a mazelike pore surface that can resemble D. confragosa. It can be distinguished by its thinner fruit bodies, a black line in the flesh, and the way that the tubes often break into irregular flattened teeth in maturity. Daedalea quercina, common on oak, has a larger fruit body up to in diameter and thick, and its pore surface is more distinctively labyrinthine (maze-like). It causes a brown heart rot, where carbohydrates are removed from the inner heartwood, leaving brownish, oxidized lignin. Ecology and distribution Daedaleopsis confragosa is a lignicolous fungus that produces a decay of sapwood. It causes white rot, a type of wood decay in which lignin is degraded and cellulose remains as a light-colored residue. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups, sometimes in tiers, in the wounds of living trees. Its preferred host is willow, but it has also been found on birch and other hardwoods. Fruiting usually occurs from June to December, but the hard shelves can persist year- round. In North America, the species is most common in eastern locales, but rare in western regions. It is common in Europe, and is one of the 100 most common fungi in the United Kingdom. Its European range extends east to the Urals. In Asia it is widely distributed, having been recorded from China, western Maharashtra (India), Iran, and Japan. The fruit bodies are popular among fungus-loving beetles. In a Russian study, 54 species from 16 families in the Coleoptera complex were recorded using the fungus; the most common were Cis comptus, Sillcacis affinis (Ciidae), Tritoma subbasalis, Dacne bipustulata (Erotylidae), Mycetophagus multipunctatus, M. piceus (Mycetophagidae), and Thymalus oblongus (Trogossitidae). Bioactive compounds The triterpenes 3Œ±-carboxyacetoxyquercinic acid, 3Œ±-carboxyacetoxy-24-methylene-23-oxolanost-8-en-26-oic acid, and 5Œ±,8Œ±-epidioxyergosta-6,22-dien-3Œ≤-ol (ergosterol peroxide) have been isolated from D. confragosa. Lectins from D. confragosa, tested against rabbit and human erythrocytes, were determined to have anti-H serological specificity. Analysis of the lipid and fatty acid composition revealed that D. confragosa contains 20.1% total lipids (mg/g dry weight), 32.9% neutral lipids, 53.8% phospholipid, and 13.3% glycolipids. An analysis of hydroxy fatty acid content showed that D. confragosa contains, as a percentage of total fatty acids, 0.02% 7-hydroxy-8,14-dimethyl-9-hexadecenoic acid and 0.01% 7-hydroxy-8,16-dimethyl-9-octadecenoic acid.

Named after Bohemian nobleman and Austrian general Joseph Radetzky von Radetz (1766-1858), it is most notable as part of the history of Bulgaria as the ship which revolutionary and poet Hristo Botev and his band bloodlessly hijacked and used to reach Kozloduy, Bulgaria. On 29 May 1876, after the ship left the port of Bechet, the Bulgarian revolutionaries, who had boarded her from different ports disguised as gardeners, forced the captain Dagobert Engl√§nder to change course and transport the band to the Bulgarian port of Kozloduy, from where they would attempt to organize an anti-Ottoman uprising as a follow-up to the already crushed April Uprising of the same year. Botev sent the following message to the crew and the passengers: The captain wrote of Botev's \\"civility, energy and temperament\\", and agreed to transport the band to Kozloduy. Upon arriving in Bulgaria, the revolutionaries dropped on their knees and kissed the earth, saying goodbye to the captain and the passengers, who saluted them by waving his peaked cap. The Radetzky was decommissioned in 1918 and destroyed in 1924, although most of its relics were preserved, such as the flag with a coat of arms, a seal, the original licence, etc., which were handed by Adolf Engl√§nder, a brother of the captain, to Boris III of Bulgaria. Between 1964 and 1966, On the occasion of the 90th anniversary of Hristo Botev's death, money was collected by 1,200,000 Bulgarian pupils on the initiative of the journalist Lilyana Lozanova, and the steamship was reconstructed based on the original design and technical data given by the ship's dyer Kir√°ly J√≥zsef. The reconstructed Radetzky was officially opened as a museum ship on 30 May 1966 at Kozloduy. It is a composite of a 1953 soviet paddle tug, and pieces of the original Radetzky saved in 1918. The steamship Radetzky is a national relic of Bulgaria. A village in Sliven Province bears its name, Radetski, and national writer Ivan Vazov wrote a poem based on the events of May 1876, which is today a popular patriotic song called Still White Danube Undulates.

In 1985 the film won a UNICEF Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. With more than 1.5 million admissions it was one of the most successful Dutch films of that year. Two years later, an extended version of the film was turned into a four-episode TV series. Storyline Ciske, nicknamed the rat, grows up in 1930s Amsterdam as a street-kid bereft of parental love; because his seaman father Cor is largely absent, he is forced to live with his mother Marie who abuses him. Ciske has been expelled from a few schools till he joins Master Bruis' class; Bruis manages to win Ciske's trust and make him feel at ease. Meanwhile, Cor begins a relationship with laundry lady Aunt Jans, fuelling Ciske's hope of a better future than at home with his mother. Marie refuses to cooperate in a divorce, not to mention Bruis' application for guardianship. Instead she chooses to destroy a present (a copy of Gulliver's Travels) that Ciske got from his one friend Dorus who was terminally ill. Ciske retaliates by grabbing a knife and stabbing his mother to death. Ciske is sentenced to detention, struggling to survive among elder inmates. Upon his release, everyone has gone off him; even Aunt Jans, by cancelling her wedding because she does not want to build a future on someone else's loss.

This was the first album by a jazz singer to be recorded without accompaniment or overdubbing. Background When McFerrin's album was released in 1984, it was exceptional for several reasons. The use of computers, synthesizers, and electronics in music was on the rise while McFerrin relied solely on his voice. One of the songs on the album is called \\"I'm My Own Walkman\\". He fit in the tradition of bebop vocalists for whom sound dominated lyrics and who imitated the sounds of saxophones and trumpets. But like Al Jarreau, he went beyond them by imitating all the instruments: drums, bass, flute, horns, guitar. He thumped his chest with his hands for percussive effects. He was the first jazz singer to sing while inhaling in addition to exhaling. He gave concerts as a soloist without instrumental accompaniment. His vocal styles varied, too, sometimes within one song in which he sang improvised lines with quick changes in register, falsetto, pops, grunts, while maintaining melody, harmony, and rhythm. One should also note his range. He is the son of an opera singer. He was voted Best Male Vocalist in DownBeat magazine in 1984 and 1985.

P. schweinitzii is a polypore, although unlike bracket fungi the fruiting body may appear terrestrial when growing from the roots or base of the host tree. The fruiting bodies, appearing in late summer or fall, commonly incorporate blades of grass, twigs, or fallen pine needles as they grow. As these fruiting bodies age, the pore surface turns from yellow to greenish yellow, the top becomes darker, and the flesh becomes harder and more wood-like. The effect, impact and significance of infection by this fungus is rooted in the fact that it causes brown rot, which degrades the cellulose. Thus there is a loss of tensile strength which often leads to brittle fracture near the stem base, even at a fairly early stage of decay. Decay initiated above ground can lead to branch snap or breakout. P. schweinitzii is native to North America and Eurasia, and has been identified as an exotic species in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. It is not edible. As its common name suggests, the dyer's polypore is an excellent natural source of green, yellow, gold, or brown dye, depending on the material dyed and the mordant used. P. schweinitzii is named after Lewis David de Schweinitz, a Pennsylvania-born Moravian minister and important early American mycologist.

It is inedible due to its tough texture. It is also a plant pathogen infecting plane and mango trees. Description Pycnoporus sanguineus is used for both industrial and medicinal purposes throughout the world. A pigment extracted from the caps called cinnabarin is used in textile industries for the partial and complete de-colorization of certain dyes. Other industrial uses of this species include testing methods for wood treatment products and enzymes used in bio-remediation for the breakdown of crude oils. Traditional medicinal uses were first utilized by natives in surrounding areas of this species. Medicinal uses of P. sanguineus help relieve symptoms of the following diseases: arthritis, gout, styptic, sore throats, ulcers, tooth aches, fevers, and hemorrhages. P. sanguineus also displays numerous anti-bacterial properties against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeroginosa, S. typhi, and S. aureus by inhibiting specific metabolic pathways. Currently, P. sanguineus is being used in medicine for the absorption of certain heavy metals contained within the blood stream.

With a small drainage area with no major feeders, Trekanten is located in a park furnished with an artificial bathing beach and various planted-out fish species. In the early 1980s, potable water was begun to be poured into the lake while water from the bottom of the lake was pumped out, operations resulting in a significant reduction in levels of phosphorus but which failed to affect levels of nutrients and oxygen depletion in bottom layers. Levels of lead and copper are among the highest documented in any lake in Stockholm.Trekanten Whilst the lake flora and fauna is roughly representative for Stockholm, the lake forms a natural link between the bays √Örstaviken and Vinterviken.  Catchment area  Along the shores of the lake is a park created on a flat terrain. Leading up to Nybohov on the southern side of the lake is a fault bluff with pines and deciduous trees, including hazel. On the eastern shore is a bathe next to the Liljeholmen metro station, a bus terminal, the light rail Tv√§rbanan, newly added flats, and some older buildings. Several residential areas surround the lake, including Gr√∂ndal.Vattenprogram, p 14.3-14.4 About 30% of the catchment area is settled land and two major traffic routes passes through the area. = Environmental influence = In an old industrial area north of the lake is a timber trade, the only remaining polluting operation in the catchment area. About 60 kg of phosphorus is brought to the lake annually, of which more than half is released from lake sediments and the rest is derived from surface runoff (also contributing some 260 kg of nitrogen). Historically, the lake was flanked by small scale industries such as tanneries, dye, and creosote works and until the early 1960s sewage and overflow water was guided into the lake. During the past 20 years, however, airing of bottom layers coupled with addition of potable water have improved the state of the lake. While the affected terrain has been restored since the operations were discontinued, in 1997 low levels of arsenic and increased levels of DDT were documented. Though stormwater from parts of the traffic route Essingeleden has been redirected elsewhere, water from a 300 metres long viaduct used by some 1200,000 cars daily is still brought into the lake via a water treatment plant lessening oil levels with some 10 per cent and heavy metals with 9-14 per cent. Water from 200 metres of the Liljeholmsv√§gen traffic route (45,000 vehicles/day) is still led untreated into the lake. Thus, while surrounding blocks of flats are believed to contribute with most of the phosphorus and nitrogen, an estimated fourth of the zinc brought to the lake is believed to come from car tyres and about 18 per cent from settlements, while copper roofs, formerly abundant around the lake but mostly replaced by asphalt today, are thought to cause most of the copper.  Flora and fauna  Lake Trekanten viewed from Liljeholmen. In late summer, phytoplankton stock is dominated by green algae paired equal levels of diatoms, cyanobacteria, and a species of eutroph carapace flagellate (Ceratium hirundinella). Several of the blue green algae present in the lake are potentially poisonous and, notwithstanding non-alarming levels, therefore carefully monitored near the bathe. Lacking soft and shallow bottom areas near the shore, the lake contains only commonplace vegetation, save for the population of crack willow and the hybrid between white willow and bay willow found on the southern shore. Aquatic plants are dominated by white waterlily, amphibious bistort, and occasional curled pondweed (uncommon to Stockholm).Vattenprogram, p 14.6 An inventory of lake bed fauna in 1997 produced a list of only 29 species/taxa including most common species, mostly freshwater gastropods, fireflies, and leeches but no beetles. A rotenone treatment in 1986 didn't affect the populations of crucian carp and signal crayfish still dominating the fauna. Perch was introduced shortly after the treatment, and northern pike and roach is believed to have found their way into the lake by themselves. Crucian carps are decimated by trawling annually and the population of roach has increased considerably since 2001. Carp, rainbow trout, and signal crayfish have been planted-out. In early summer the lake is home to a number of birds including thrush nightingale, common chaffinch, garden warbler, and blackcap. Other birds common to Stockholm, such as mallard, Eurasian coot, tufted duck, and great crested grebe, are found by the lake, while heron visit the lake and common merganser fish here during winters. No amphibians have been documented by the lake.

The school serves a portion of Timberwood Park.\\"2010 CENSUS - CENSUS BLOCK MAP: Timberwood Park CDP, TX\\" (Archive). U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on August 26, 2016.\\"HS Boundaries 2015-2016.\\" North East Independent School District. Retrieved on August 26, 2016. In 2013 Reagan was ranked fifth on Children at Risk's ranking of the top 10 high schools in Greater San Antonio. History San Antonio, like many Sun Belt cities, experienced explosive growth in its suburbs beginning in the early 1990s. This growth was particularly evident in affluent areas formed by people moving to the city. In Stone Oak and Sonterra north of Route 1604 and between the Blanco Road and US-281 corridors, this rapid growth caused severe overcrowding at nearby Winston Churchill High School. At the time Churchill was the farthest- north school in the North East Independent School District, and its student population grew to 3,400 at a school designed for not more than 2,500. The district recognized this problem, and included an allocation to build a new high school in the area as a part of its 1997 bond issue. The property for the school was purchased from descendants of rancher William Classen prior to passage of the bond issue. After voters approved the bond issue, construction began on the campus. Spaw Glass was the general contractor for the project. The name \\"Ronald Reagan\\" was chosen by future students of the school (those currently in attendance at other North East schools) from a list selected by the district's Board of Trustees. A spirit committee selected the mascot \\"Rattlers\\" from three finalists and chose green, silver, and black as the school colors. As construction nearing the end, problems with the tiling in some classrooms led to the discovery of a previously unknown spring under the foundation of the building. This caused cracks and potentially long-lasting damage to the brand new school. Despite this, Reagan opened to much fanfare in August 1999, although constructions issues related to the underground spring prevented use of some classroom facilities well into the school's first year. The opening of Lady Bird Johnson High School in 2008 relieved overcrowding at Reagan as San Antonio's population continued booming in the early part of the 2000s.Reagan High School Map (Archive).

Retrieved on August 26, 2016. Organization Like most NEISD high schools, Reagan is organized into departments, each with an instructional dean or department head who oversees and organizes the activities and efforts of that department and reports to the administrative staff. Each department in turn consists either of a teacher who oversees a class schedule, or a sub-department (in the case of athletics, fine arts and foreign language), which can be made up of one or more teachers. Each class has an elected group of class officers with the student council senate presiding over the entire student body. =Academics= Classes are graded on a 100-point grading scale, and the grades students earn over their four-year high school career contribute to their ultimate class ranking. The 100-point grade is then converted to a four-point scale grade which appears on their high school transcripts. Special weights are attributed to classes based on their rigor. Advanced placement (AP) courses are weighted with a 29% increase in GPA, while pre-AP (honors) courses are weighted with a 15% increase in GPA. Less rigorous courses might actually count against the student. NEISD does not award competitive honors to students ‚Äì any student earning a GPA of 100 or higher is a summa cum laude graduate. In some schools, this can lead to a very large number of summa cum laude graduates (as many as 170) as a result of large graduating class sizes and the extra weight given to advanced placement classes. Cum laude, magna cum laude and summa cum laude awards are given based on the student's 100-point scale GPA upon graduation. Band The Ronald Reagan High School Marching Band has been in existence since the school was opened. The band has been placed in the finals at every regional entered since the opening of the school until 2009 under the direction of Levi Chavis. In 2009, the Reagan band missed BOA Arlington regional finals for the first time since they began competing on the BOA circuit. Not only does the Ronald Reagan Marching Band compete in the Texas University Interscholastic League marching competition held every other year, it also enters annually in various Bands of America events including the regionals in Arlington, Texas, and Houston, Texas, the Super Regional in San Antonio, as well as the Grand National BOA competition held in Indianapolis, Indiana. The band placed second in 2003 and 2005, eleventh in 2002 and 2012, and seventh in 2016. The band also participated in nationals in 2007, making semi-finals but missing finals. In 2006, Reagan tied for third in the state of Texas at the UIL State Marching Contest Finals. In 2012, Reagan placed third at the UIL State Marching Contest Prelims, and in 2014 the band placed 5th in the state. In 2018, the band placed second at BOA Super Regional San Antonio with their astounding show ‚ÄúLoop‚Äù. They are currently under the direction of Dan Morrison. The band has been selected to march in the 2018 Rose Parade in Pasadena, California and the 2019 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. In 2019, the band was crowned the BOA San Antonio Super Regional Champion with their record-breaking show, \\"Secret World\\".

The song features the characters Max Detweiler and Baroness Elsa Schr√§der, with Captain Georg von Trapp joining in later. It was first performed by Marion Marlowe, Kurt Kasznar and Theodore Bikel. Summary Captain von Trapp anticipates the German annexation of Austria, and argues with Elsa and Max about how to respond to the Nazis, who have begun to overrun the country. While the Captain holds Austrian nationalist views and believes he must stand up to the Nazis, Elsa and Max say there is nothing anyone can do, and that the Captain should be flexible and make the Nazis think that he is on their side. The song shows the three's different motivations and clashes of egos, and becomes a song about Max and Elsa trying to convince Georg to forget about everything going on around him and just to think about himself. The song's circular melody parallels its circular argument. In the end, Georg decides he cannot marry a woman with no political convictions. The \\"political dispute [was essentially replaced] with a solely personal and individual squabble\\". The song is a turning point in the musical for Captain von Trapp, marking the point where he breaks off his relationship with Elsa, leaving him free to marry Maria. The song was not used in the film adaptation, where instead the engagement is called off because Elsa is too rich and powerful, wanting an extravagant life in Vienna, and the Captain, who has fallen in love with Maria, wants a simple life in the country. Significance \\"No Way to Stop It\\" is one of only two numbers in the play in which Max and Elsa sing. Along with \\"How Can Love Survive?\\", which was also cut from the film, it is the only number that addresses her relationship with the Captain. The satiric, cynical number, which is about \\"amoral political compromising\\" (and in fact an anti-protest song), is theorised by Broadway Musicals: A Hundred Year History to be the first-ever rock song to be introduced to a Broadway musical. The book cites its similarity to songs by the Kingston Trio from around that time. The song, along with \\"How Can Love Survive\\" was cited in The Oxford Companion to the American Musical: Theatre, Film, and Television as an example of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"wry sense of sophistication\\". The American Musical and the Formation of National Identity compares the song to \\"So What?\\" from Cabaret, in that they both \\"articulate [the] general sense of indifference among many constituencies that would eventually allow the Third Reich to expand its influence beyond the point of return\\". Both these songs include the theme of obsessive circular motion in order to create a sense of inevitability. In the case of \\"No Way to Stop It\\", the lyrical motif is the orbit of various satellites, and by the end of the song, it is implied that \\"I\\" is the centre of the universe. As a result of \\"No Way to Stop It\\" and the duet \\"How Can Love Survive\\" (in which the Captain and the Baroness \\"attempt to work out their competition and the complexities of a dually rich marriage\\") being cut from the film, class and political tensions are eliminated, secondary characters become less complex, and Maria and the children become most of the film's focus. Broadway Musicals: A Hundred Year History refers to the song as a \\"gem\\". Cambridge Guide to American Theatre described both No Way to Stop It and How Can Love Survive? as having \\"ironic wit\\". Lyrics You dear attractive dewy-eyed idealist, Today you have to learn to be a realist. You may be bent on doing deeds of derring-do, But up against a shark, what can a herring do? Be wise, compromise. Compromise, and be wise! Let them think you're on their side, be noncommittal. I will not bow my head to the men I despise! You won't have to bow your head, just stoop a little. Why not learn to put your faith and your reliance, On an obvious and simple fact of science? A crazy planet full of crazy people, Is somersaulting all around the sky. And every time it turns another somersault, Another day goes by. And there's no way to stop it, No, there's no way to stop it. No, you can't stop it even if you tried. So, I'm not going to worry, No, I'm not going to worry, Every time I see another day go by. While somersaulting at a cockeyed angle, We make a cockeyed circle 'round the sun. And when we circle back to where we started from, Another year has run. And there's no way to stop it, No, there's no way to stop it, If the earth wants to roll around the sun. You're a fool if you worry. You're a fool if you worry, Over anything but little number one. That's you! That's I! And I! And me! That all absorbing character. That fascinating creature. That super special feature, Me! So every star and every whirling planet, And every constellation in the sky, Revolves around the center of the universe, That lovely thing called, I. And there's no way to stop it. No, there's no way to stop it, And I know, though I cannot tell you why (sigh). Just as long as I'm living, Just as long as I'm living, There'll be nothing else as wonderful as I. I! I! I! Nothing else as wonderful as I!

As Hutcheson later wrote in The Spirit of the Garden: In 1900 she entered MIT's new landscape architecture program at age 29, where she studied for two years before leaving without degree in 1902. She subsequently designed the grounds of several residential estates near Boston, most notably Frederick Moseley's large Newburyport estate, 1904-1906 (now Maudslay State Park), and the garden at Alice Mary Longfellow's house (now the Longfellow House‚ÄìWashington's Headquarters National Historic Site) in Cambridge. She also was the landscape architect for the Poplar Hill and Welwyn estates in Glen Cove, New York. After Hutcheson's marriage in 1911, she retired from commercial practice but she began to landscape her own garden (5 acres) on the couple's farm in Chester Township, New Jersey. Its overall design was influenced by classical Italian gardens, featuring a pond enclosed by native plants, vegetable garden, flower borders, orchards, all√©es, and farm buildings. This farm, with garden, is now preserved as the Bamboo Brook Outdoor Education Center. With In 1935 she was named a fellow in the American Society of Landscape Architects, the third woman to receive this distinction. Although Hutcheson executed dozens of commissions, including gardens at Bennington College and Billings Farm (now the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park), most of her works have been lost.

Acid Westerns subvert many of the conventions of earlier Westerns to \\"conjure up a crazed version of autodestructive white America at its most solipsistic, hankering after its own lost origins\\". Origin of the term The term \\"Acid Western\\" was coined by film critic Pauline Kael in a review of Alejandro Jodorowsky's film El Topo, published in the November 1971 issue of The New Yorker. Jonathan Rosenbaum expanded upon the idea in his June 1996 review of Jim Jarmusch's film Dead Man, a subsequent interview with Jarmusch for Cineaste, and later in the book Dead Man, from BFI Modern Classics. In the book, Rosenbaum illuminates several aspects of this re-revisionist Western: from Neil Young's haunting score to the role of tobacco, to Johnny Depp's performance, to the film's place in the acid-Western genre. In the chapter \\"On the Acid Western\\", Rosenbaum addresses not only the hallucinogenic quality of the film's pace and its representation of \\"reality\\", but also argues that the film inherits an artistic and political sensibility derived from the 1960s counterculture which has sought to critique and replace capitalism with alternative models of exchange.Rosenbaum, Jonathan (2000). Dead Man. London: Cromwell Press. In the traditional Western, the journey west is seen as a road to liberation and improvement, but in the Acid Western, it is the reverse, a journey towards death; society becomes nightmarish. History of the genre Rosenbaum used the term \\"Acid Western\\" to describe a \\"cherished counterculture dream\\" from the 1960s and 1970s \\"associated with people like Monte Hellman, Dennis Hopper, Jim McBride, and Rudy Wurlitzer, as well as movies like Greaser's Palace; Alex Cox tapped into something similar in the 1980s with Walker.\\" The Western pictures of Hollywood director William A. Wellman may have been an early influence on the genre. The Ox-Bow Incident (1943) and Yellow Sky (1948) feature characters that are forced to step out of society and take a stand against it. Yellow Sky in particular set up many elements that director Monte Hellman picked up two decades later. Monte Hellman's cult film The Shooting (1966) could be consideredMaltin Leonard (1994). Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia. A Plume/Penguine Book. the first Acid Western. The film stars Will Hutchins, Warren Oates and a young Jack Nicholson, and was anonymously financed by Roger Corman. The Shooting subverts the usual priorities of the Western to capture a sense of dread and uncertainty that characterized the counterculture of the late 1960s. Hellman quickly followed up with Ride in the Whirlwind (1966). Screenwriter Rudolph Wurlitzer is considered \\"the individual most responsible for exploring this genre, having practically invented it himself in the late '60s and then helped to nurture it in the scripts of others\\", such as McBride's Glen and Randa, Hellman's Two-Lane Blacktop, Cox's Walker, and Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. Wurlitzer worked on the script of Gone Beaver, which Rosenbaum describes as \\"a visionary script\\" for Jim McBride. It was an extremely ambitious big-budget Western about early American trappers and Indians, for which a virtually invented language of ‚Äútrapper talk‚Äù was devised. The film was aborted one day before production.Biskind, Peter (1998). Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex- Drugs-and-Rock-'n'-Roll Generation Saved Hollywood. New York, NY: Simon & Schuster. Wurlitzer's unproduced 1970s screenplay Zebulon inspired Jarmusch's Dead Man. Wurlitzer later transformed his script into the novel The Drop Edge of Yonder. Rosenbaum calls Dead Man a \\"much-delayed fulfillment\\" of the Acid Western, \\"formulating a chilling, savage frontier poetry to justify its hallucinated agenda.\\" More recently, Jan Kounen's Blueberry from 2004 was cited as an example of the genre.https://www.thevelvetvox.com/2016/11/24/acid- western-zoekt-visioen/ Example filmography *The Shooting (1966) *Ride in the Whirlwind (1966) *El Topo (1970) *The Hired Hand (1971) *Captain Apache (1971) *Greaser's Palace (1972) *Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973) *Walker (1987) *Dead Man (1995) *Wild Bill (1995) *Blueberry (2004) *The Murder of Hi Good (2012) *Day of the Stranger (2020) References Category:Western (genre) films by genre ","title":"Acid Western"},{"id":"11570615","text":"Governor-General Abraham Patras Abraham Patras (22 May 1671 ‚Äì 3 May 1737) was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 11 March 1735 until 3 May 1737. He was born in Grenoble of a refugee French Huguenot family. In 1685, his family fled to the Netherlands. Early career Patras first took a job in the offices of an Amsterdam merchant named Nathani√´l Gauthier (a fellow Huguenot), but he left for the Indies aboard the Hobree on 4 January 1690, where he is described as a soldier in the employ of the Enkhuizen branch of the Dutch East India Company. In 1691, he sought a change of career and got a temporary post as an agent in Batavia. In 1695 he became assistant/secretary to the Chinese estates-management administration in Ambon Island. In 1698 he was put in charge of children and matrimonial matters. He married in 1699 to a daughter of an official of the Judicial Council in Ambon. His wife died on the 16 December 1700. His only daughter also died young. =Rising through the ranks= Patras was nominated to the Council of Justice in 1700, and in 1703, he went to work as under-secretary (onderkoopman) for the Governor of the Moluccas Islands. In 1707, he became the Head (opperhoofd) of the trading post at Jambi, where his headquarters were attacked. Although severely wounded in the back, he survived. He was merchant, then Chief Factor in Palembang in 1711. In 1717, he was promoted to Chief Merchant (opperkoopman) and Office holder (gezaghebber) of the west coast of Sumatra. It was 1720 that saw him promoted to Inspector General of Accounts for the Dutch East Indies (visitateur-generaal van Nederlands-Indi√´). In 1721, he was sent as an envoy to Jambi. In 1722, he was appointed deputy-overseer of goods coming in and out of the castle at Batavia. In 1724, he got the very lucrative post of Head of the Dutch Bengal trading post. In 1731, he was appointed as extraordinary (i.e. co-opted) member of the Council of the Indies. Governor-General On the 10 March 1735 on the death of Governor-General Dirck van Cloon, Patras very surprisingly was nominated Governor-General. He had never been a full member of the Council of the Indies, so this was a first, and was caused by him slipping through as a compromise candidate following a stalemate in the voting. He was not keen to take on the post in these circumstances, but agreed to do so until a better candidate could be found. On 11 March 1735 he was nominated interim Governor-General, a decision which was approved by the Directors of the East India Company. During his short period of office, no significant decisions were made. Although he was a competent leader and had built up a great deal of practical knowledge of the territories, his age (at 64) probably ensured that he was not a very powerful Governor-General. He died two years after his appointment during the night of 3 May 1737. He was buried in Batavia on 6 May 1737. The governor-generalship was taken over by Adriaan Valckenier. Anthony Patras Anthony Patras (1718-1764), born in Geneva, was a nephew of governor Abraham Patras. In 1734 Anthony arrived in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. When his uncle died the young man inherited his immense fortune, the collection of books, and art. In 1738 he married a daughter of Isaac van Schinne, an opperhoofd in Deshima and member of the Council of India.Vliet, P. van der (1996) Onno Zwier van Haren, p. 100; After the 1740 Batavia massacre he returned to Holland. In 1743 he tried to become a member of Sloten's vroedschap, which refused to appoint him. After two years he suddenly became burgomaster of the Frisian town, succeeding Onno Zwier van Haren. He was a States General representative for this small city until his early death. (In Wijckel he bought which was built for Menno van Coehoorn.) Patras died early and probably hardly lived in his new mansion, nowadays known as Lange Voorhout Palace. His widow was forced to sell the property in 1778.R.

Hills House, also known as the Hills‚ÄìDeCaro House, is a residence located at 313 Forest Avenue in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois. It is most notable for a 1906 remodel by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in his signature Prairie style. The Hills‚ÄìDeCaro House represents the melding of two distinct phases in Wright's career; it contains many elements of both the Prairie style and the designs with which Wright experimented throughout the 1890s. The house is listed as a contributing property to a federal historic district on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and is a local Oak Park Landmark. Since construction, the home has undergone many changes. During the 1906 remodel, the original late 19th century Stick style structure was moved and essentially completely rebuilt. Alterations carried out between 1912 and 1965 obscured some of Wright's intended design. In 1976, a major fire destroyed or damaged much of the house. The house was immediately reconstructed and partially restored. This was furthered by another partial restoration by the current home owners. As a result of the remodels, the house today bears the work of at least four different architects. The house remains a private residence, but it is occasionally opened for special tours. Early history =Frank S. Gray House (1883‚Äì1900)= In 1883, Dr. William Cunningham Gray commissioned architect Charles C. Miller to build the house which would eventually become the present Hills‚ÄìDeCaro House on two lots along Forest Avenue.‚Ä† Gray was a prominent professional writer and publisher and was the grandfather of famed Prairie School architect, William Gray Purcell. The three-story, Stick style home featured tall sash windows topped by bracketed hoods, a covered porch which extended across the front fa√ßade, and flared gables filled with decorative, fan-shaped trusses (Historic photo of the exterior prior to 1906). The first and second floor each contained four principle rooms around a stair hall in the northeast corner. Dr. Gray sold the house to his son Frank Sherwood Gray, but William Gray was again the owner by 1898. =Relocation and remodel (1900‚Äì1907)= Diagram showing the development of the Moore estate and moving of the Gray house. Two years later in 1900, the Gray house changed hands again. It was purchased by attorney Nathan Grier Moore, the owner of the large residence on two lots to the immediate north. As stated in his autobiography, Moore intended to remodel the adjacent house as a future wedding present for his eldest daughter, Mary. Frank Lloyd Wright, whom Moore had previously contracted to design his own house in 1895 (see also Nathan G. Moore House), was soon commissioned to carry out the redesign work. The 1900 date on an early set of architectural drawings indicate that Wright began work on the project immediately. However, any thought of construction would have to wait, as complications with the land title delayed the total transfer of the property until 1903. (Subpage: \\"Gray family house\\") In 1905, Moore acquired another house to the south of the Gray house which had been previously owned by D.L. McDaniels. This final purchase expanded Moore's Forest Avenue frontage to 250 feet (72.6 m), and was the last necessary piece of his plan. The following year, Moore had the McDaniels house demolished. The Gray house moved south and rotated counterclockwise ninety degrees to take its place. Once it was sited in its present-day location, Wright assigned draftsman Barry Byrne to oversee the remodel of the home. Wright's design Wright's design for the repositioned home ‚Äì now in its third revision ‚Äì utilized the Gray home foundation and framing for several walls and floors but otherwise entirely engulfed the original building. The existing stair hall was retained and extended to serve as the central circulation spine for the first and second levels. As a result of turning the structure during the move, the hall was made to traverse the lot from side to side, or from north to south. This unusual orientation inconspicuously placed the front door halfway down the north elevation instead of directly facing the street. The first floor hall was divided into three sections; a small vestibule inside the entrance was followed by a narrow passageway lined by French doors on one side which terminated in an open space with broad doorways into each of the home's principle rooms. Of these, the living room, library and kitchen were carved out of the original house, while a rear addition housed a dining room and pantry. Two staircases ‚Äì one a wide, open, public stair in the central hall, and the other a narrow, winding, and closed service stair ‚Äì connected the first and second floors. The second floor contained five bedrooms around a single hall bathroom. A finished third story, accessed by the tight service stair, contained two servant bedrooms and a second bathroom. All in all, the remodeling and expansions brought the house to a gross floor area of approximately 1800 square feet (170 m2) on the first floor 1600 square feet (150 m2) on the second. Refer to set of Wright floor plans The interior rooms were finished in keeping with the Prairie style. Walls and ceiling were plastered with ample oak trim throughout on both surfaces. Floors in most rooms were also of oak. Large Roman brick fireplaces dominate the living room and master bedroom. As with most of his houses, Frank Lloyd Wright designed several built-in furnishings, including oak radiator covers, bookshelves in the library and living room, and a china cabinet with glass doors in the dining room. The bay window and pagoda-style dormer are prominent elements of the east fa√ßade of the Hills‚ÄìDeCaro House. On the exterior, Frank Lloyd Wright traded the dual-pitched, cross-gable roof in the Stick style for a more distinctive dual-pitched hip roof with deep eaves and thick wood fascia boards. The form and style of the roof exemplified Wright's Japanese influence, and has been likened to the design of Asian pagodas. The unique design was furthered by a tierred surface of cedar shingles created by furring strips under every fifth row. Three dormers ‚Äì one each on the east, south, and west fa√ßades ‚Äì were likewise faced in shingles and were topped by the same flared, double-pitched roofs. Existing and new walls, alike, were covered in uniform, lightly textured, pale stucco from the ground up to ‚Äì and including ‚Äì the eave soffit. A continuous canted ledge of painted redwood stretched around the house below the second floor windows. Additional redwood trim was employed in rectangles to wrap around each corner on the second floor. All windows and doors in the home were fashioned in leaded glass with nickel caming. The unvarying glass pattern was a variation of the typical Prairie muntin bar design and consisted of a frame of narrow rectangular and trapezoidal panes surrounding a single large glass pane. Wright arranged most windows into one of two ensembles ‚Äì one for each floor ‚Äì to unify his design. In five locations on the first floor, double casement windows or full length French doors were flanked by two more isolated, narrow casements. All openings on the second floor were composed of paired casements topped by a single transom light. A cantilevered, rectangular bay, which formed a focal point on the second level of the street (east) elevation, contained a band of four such three-piece windows and was subtly bookended by two deeply inset casements. The remodel brought ample exterior space to the house. Matching porches extended into the front and rear yard on either side of the north-facing, vertical entry and stair tower. Both porches were terminated in a broad stair between elongated planting piers. Aside from additional planters below the living room window and outside the stairway window, the yard was simply landscaped. Refer to historic photograph A low concrete wall topped by a similarly short wrought iron fence was incorporated sometime after construction to enclose the yard along the south and east lot lines. This fence continued along the eastern edge of Nathan Moore's property to the corner of Forest Avenue and Superior Street. The sidewalk at the front entrance was demarcated by Roman brick piers topped by glass-globed light fixtures. The yard additionally featured an original ticket booth from the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition which Moore had purchased and relocated to the site. Hills ownership and alterations (1907‚Äì1965) Although construction was completed sometime in late 1906 or early 1907, Nathan Moore's daughter did not move in right away. In fact, Mary was not wed to lawyer Edward Rowland Hills until January 1908. Instead, two successive families rented the house from Moore. The Hills resided at 335 Superior Street, a house located north of the Moore House until sometime in 1911 or 1912. Mary Hills was not particularly fond of her wedding gift. First, Wright was not commissioned to design furniture for the Hills; according to their eldest of five sons, John Moore Hills, they felt that \\"it was their house and they would furnish it for their own taste and comfort.\\" Sibling Nathan Grier further related that his mother found the entire house too \\"stern and austere\\" and she immediately hired neighborhood architect Henry Fiddelke to make alterations. Over the next eight years, the rear kitchen wing was extended with the addition of a pantry and breakfast room (c. 1912), the rear porch was enclosed with glass (c. 1917), a second bathroom was inserted above the kitchen, and a small second floor balcony was enlarged and covered to form a sleeping porch. The space under the rear porch was excavated to form a children's playroom and billiards room. Most notably, the second floor front (east) bay window ‚Äì which was initially split between two bedrooms ‚Äì was reconstructed as two separate bay windows in 1915. In later alterations, the cedar shingle roof was replaced by asphalt shingles which failed to replicate the distinctive tiered pattern. Also, the front porch was expanded and piers on either side of the front steps were replaced by simple iron handrails. (see floor plans at right for details on the alterations) When Nathan Moore had split his property in 1910, he deeded the southern 60 feet (18.3 m) of his original of Forest Avenue frontage to his daughter. Since the two yards remained contiguous, the fact that the dividing lot line was tight up against the side of the Hills House posed no problem. However, in 1946, Nathan Moore died and his estate passed to the Hills family. Mary and Edward sold the Moore house the next year, but retained an additional 40 feet (12.2 m) of land to provide space for a side yard and garden north of their home. Following her husband's death in 1953, Mary Hills continued to reside in the house until she sold it and moved to an apartment in 1965. Fire and reconstruction (1975‚Äì1977) In 1975, Tom and Irene DeCaro purchased the house and began a diligent restoration with the aid of architect John Tilton. However, work was abruptly halted in 1976 when a fire devastated much of the structure. Cleaning fluids and paint fumes ignited by an electric sander on the second floor were determined to be the cause of the blaze. Irene DeCaro was injured in the fire when she returned to the burning home to search for her pet cat. The entire second and third floors were completely destroyed and the first floor was badly damaged. Despite the extensive destruction, several of the first floor built-in furnishings and both fireplaces survived the fire. Following a neighborhood fundraiser in May 1976, Mr. and Mrs. DeCaro resumed their extensive reconstruction. The restoration returned the front elevation to its 1906 design yet retained most alterations made by the Hills towards the rear, including the enclosed porches and enlarged kitchen wing. In cases where blueprints differed from historic photographs, the owners chose to follow Wright's plans. For instance, the main chimney was known to have always been exposed brick, yet was stuccoed in the reconstruction per Wright's original plans. Inside, some changes were made to accommodate the DeCaro's modern lifestyle. On the main level, an updated kitchen replaced the breakfast room and pantry. On the second floor, several walls were moved to widen the hallway and to create a master suite in place of two front bedrooms (see post- reconstruction plans at right). On the third floor tight servants quarters were exchanged for a single bedroom suite. For their part in the restoration, the Oak Park Landmarks Commission voted in 1977 to rename the completed structure as the Hills-DeCaro House. Recent years (1977 to present) The rear (west) face of the home showing the 2009 yard renovations. Several alterations made by the Hills are also visible. Following the DeCaros, the house passed through three owners before it was purchased by Mark and Sallie Smylie in 2001. The Smylies hired Von Dreele-Freerksen Construction for restoration and remodeling work of the interior and exterior. On the interior, the modern kitchen and main floor bath were remodeled to match the style of the other ground floor rooms. In the basement level, the floors were lowered to increase ceiling height and stone foundation walls from the 1884 house were re-exposed. Outside, previous owners had installed a wood band below the first floor to match the ledge on the second floor, had capped some of the exterior planters, and had again replaced the cedar roof with asphalt shingles. All of these historically inaccurate modifications were reversed. Additionally, trim and stucco were sampled to reveal the original exterior colors. The determined paint scheme consisted of off-white stucco and wood trim in dark \\"creosote\\" brown. On January 7, 2002, the Hills-DeCaro House was declared a landmark by the Village of Oak Park. The residence had already been listed as a contributing property to the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District. In early 2009, the Smylies embarked on their most significant exterior project. Records at Taliesin showed plans for a long pergola and pavilion which would have spanned between the Nathan G. Moore House conservatory and the northwest corner of the Hills-DeCaro House backyard. Further research yielded a period photograph which proved the structure's existence. Subsequent digging uncovered the limestone foundation for the pavilion. The Smylies and Von Dreel-Freerksen set about recreating the pavilion and the first section of the pergola (the portion which falls within the property lines of the Hills DeCaro House). Roman bricks for the new construction were matched to remnants found near the buried foundations. As part of the project, a large modern garage built in 1978 was replaced by a smaller, more historically sympathetic garage. Comparison to other Wright works George W. Smith House shown above. The Hills-DeCaro House is most significant for its architecture which represents the transition and integration of Wright's early experimental style and his mature Prairie style. Among features which reference his earlier designs are the windows; instead of the elaborate, geometric art-glass patterns which Wright first introduced in the Frank W. Thomas House, Wright employs simpler leaded frames with clear glass. The design is most similar to that of the Robert G. Emmond House or the wood muntin configuration of the Thomas H. Gale House, two of Wright's first works. Additionally, the house has a finished basement and attic, both of which Wright would avoid whenever possible following the development of his Prairie house. Elements which are purely Prairie in style include the extensive use of stucco contrasted with dark wood banding. Several later works, such as the Stephen M. B. Hunt House and Robert W. Evans House share similar detail work and employ the same rectangular frames at each corner. The horizontal emphasis created by this banding, as well as the deep overhangs and window groupings is also a hallmark of the Prairie style. The arrangement of rooms in the first floor of the Hills House and extended porches are evocative of the pinwheel shape found in the Ward W. Willits House, Darwin D. Martin House and other works. As Wright broke away from the conventional, rectangular floor plans with the development of his Prairie homes, the hidden entrance also became more common and can be found in nearly every one of his Prairie houses. One component which epitomizes the transitional nature of the Hills- DeCaro House is the dual-pitched, Japanese inspired roof which recalls similar roof designs for the Harry C. Goodrich House and George W. Smith House, both completed ten years prior. However, the cantilevered eaves of the Hills-Decaro house are even deeper ‚Äì stretching 5.5 feet (1.67 m) on the upper story ‚Äì and the fascia is even thicker than those of its early predecessors. When paired with the unique, stepped shingle pattern, these adjustments further accentuate the Prairie style horizontality of the house. Other Wright house remodels in Oak Park *1894 Dr. H. W.

The protein encoded by this gene is involved in binding lipopolysaccharide with Toll-Like Receptor (TLR4).  Function  The MD-2 protein appears to associate with toll-like receptor 4 on the cell surface and confers responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thus providing a link between the receptor and LPS signaling. That is, the primary interface between TLR4 and MD-2 is formed before binding LPS and the dimerization interface is induced by binding LPS.  Structure  MD-2 has a Œ≤-cup fold structure composed of two anti-parallel Œ≤ sheets forming a large hydrophobic pocket for ligand binding.  Interactions  Lymphocyte antigen 96 has been shown to interact with TLR 4. When LPS binds to a hydrophobic pocket in MD-2, it directly mediates dimerization of the two TLR4-MD-2 complexes. Thus, MD-2 form a heterodimer that recognizes a common pattern in structurally diverse LPS molecules. These interactions allow TLR4 to recognize LPS. LPS is extracted from the bacterial membrane and transferred to TLR4-MD-2 by two accessory proteins, LPS-binding protein and CD14, to induce innate immune response.

This tale is to Balochistan what Romeo and Juliet is to English-speaking lands. The story mirrors the life of the Baloch heroes and their emotions and philosophical ideas (God, evil, predestination). The hero of the story Sheh Mureed (or Shaih Moreed) and the heroine Hani are symbols of pure and tragic love. The story dates back to the 15th century, which is considered to be the heroic age of Balochistan and the classical period of Balochi literature. Characters =Sheh Murid= Sheh Murid was the son of Sheh Mubarak, the chief of the Kahiri tribe. At that time when a man was known for his arts, Murid was famous as having mastered the art of swordsmanship, horsemanship, and archery. For his skills and braveness he was ranked the highest in the army of Mir Chakar Khan Rind, the chief of the Kahiri army. Murid's bow made of steel was so heavy that he was known as the \\"Lord of the Iron Bow\\", because none but he alone could draw and shoot arrows from it. =Hani= Hani was the daughter of the Rind noble Mir Mandow; mandwani rind it is clear from epic poems she is further mentioned as Dinar, some say she was Murid's cousin. Hani was a paragon of loyalty and devotion. Everyone knew her for her good character and chastity. Hani was engaged to Sheh Murid and had been a childhood friend of Murid. Story One day when Mir Chakar and Sheh Murid were returning from a day of hunting, they stopped at the town where their fianc√©es lived. Since a Muslim Balochistani Baloch woman traditionally never appears before her betrothed before the wedding, Mir Chakar and Sheh Murid decide to visit each other's fianc√©es. Sheh Murid went to Mir Chakar's fianc√©e, who brought him clean water in a silver bowl. Murid, dying of thirst, drank the entire bowl in a single gulp and became sick. However, when Mir Chakar went to Hani, Sheh Murid's fianc√©e, she brought him clean water in a silver bowl in which she has placed dwarf palm leaf, properly washed. The chief was surprised by the pieces of straw, but he drank the water with care in order to avoid swallowing the straw. When he departed he found Murid vomiting and sick. Murid told him that the water had made him ill because he drank a lot of water on an empty stomach. Now Mir Chakar realized that Hani had acted wisely by putting pieces of straw in the water. Some time later, Mir Chakar organized a gathering where poets put forward poetry of heroes. At the height of the revelry Mir Chakar asked the nobles to make vows on which they must pledge their lives. Every chief at the gathering made a vow. Mir Jado swore that he would chop off the head of anyone who touched his beard at the assembly of nobles. Then Bibarg vowed that he would kill anyone who kills Hadeh. He was followed by Mir Haibitan who vowed that if anybody's camel joined his camel-herd he would never give it back. At last came the turn of Sheh Murid, who, madly in love with Hani, pledged that if anyone asked for anything in his possession on his wedding day, he would give it. Later on, Mir Chakar vowed that he would never tell a lie for the rest of his life. He was true to his word: He never in his lifetime after that was found to have lied. Mir Chakar tested Mir Jado's word by asking his young son to touch his father's beard during an assembly of nobles. The young boy innocently did as he was told, Mir Jado turned his face and moved the boy hoping no one noticed. However Mir Chakar encouraged the boy to repeat the action. the boy grabbed his father's beard once more. The entire assembly became silent and looked towards Mir Jado. Will he be true to his word? Full of wrath, Jado unsheathes his sword and smites the head of his innocent son in the presence of all the Rind nobles. Mir Chakar also tested Bibarg and Haibitan, finding them true to their word. Now it was time to test Sheh Murid. Murid hosted a festive gathering on his wedding and invited renowned poets to entertain the audience. And at the close of the festivities, Sheh Murid, was ready to depart with his possessions. Mir Chakar asked for Hani. Sheh Murid was shocked; he thought that he would have asked for his bow, which was a unique bow and he was a very good marksmen with a strong bow. He was known as The Lord Of The Iron Bow. With a heavy heart and much sadness he told Mir Chakar to take Hani. The unexpected demand distressed him greatly, and Murid realized that he had lost Hani. If he did not keep his vow he would be mocked and future generations would have contempt for his name. Soon after the annulment of Murid's engagement with Hani, she was soon married to Mir Chakar. But Murid was so shaken by this turn of events that he abandoned his former life and passed the days and nights in worship of Allah. He also composed poems eulogizing Hani's beauty and openly expressing his passionate love for her. The scandalous news of Murid's love for Mir Chakar's wife became the talk of every household in Balochistan. His father Sheh Mubarak tried to advise him, he composed a poem in Baluchi of the advice that his father gave him and the response to the advice. The poem in Baluchi is as follows: Baluchi :mani shehey mubarak gwashee :bellow mureed gumraheeya, :gumraheeya be raheya :pa chaakare mahay janna. :pa dosti dosta e nahay :jaan ahay pashentagay, :hani sha kour-ka geptagay :zay chond-dilla cho beetagay. :man jawab tarentaga, :peeray pitto cho gwashtaga, :wati meeray pito cho gwashtaga, :shai abaee shai kabaee, :agay takay bibiten hat-tali :pahoukana hancho dost mani, :shalwaray bonday darr kutain :janay darre pakko kutain, :lenchan wati jattay, :hanga mano gah-bo- waton gah-be-waton English :My Shai mubarak says, :O Mureed leave your aloofness, :Aloofness without purpose direction(purpose), :For chakars beautiful wife, :In the assemblies you are not amongst your friends, :You are like a walking corpse, :Hani's love has blinded you, :How will you carry on in this way, :I replied, :I advised my elderly father, :I advised my respected father, :O most honoured father, :O most esteemed, :If you were in my place likewise, :You would have left all your friends, :And stopped going to assemblies and noble gatherings, :You would have lost your mind, :And not be aware of how you dressed, :You would have clapped your hands, :On your lap and be, :In your own world, :At least i am sometimes with it :And sometimes not with it. =Departure and return= Sheh Murid then decided to leave the country and visit unknown lands across the seas. He followed a group of mendicants going to perform their pilgrimage at the holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Arabia. As tradition has it, Sheh Murid remained in Arabia for 30 years a long time during which time he truly became a mendicant and lived the life of an ascetic. After spending years away, he returned to Sibi in shabby clothes with his hair hanging down to his waist. In the company of a band of beggars he passed himself off as an anonymous mendicant begging for alms at the palace of Mir Chakar Khan Rind. The maidservant gave bowls filled with grain to each mendicant, but when she presented this food to Murid, she saw that Murid's eyes were fixed upon Hani. Hani recognised him at once but held herself back as to not arise suspicions, but Chakar saw a sparkle in her eyes. =Recognition of Sheh Murid= As a favorite pastime of the Chakarian age, the Rind nobles gathered for an archery competition. During the contest, the nobles noticed the curiosity and interest of Murid, the leader of beggars. At first the Rind nobles treated him with a certain amount of disdain on account of his shabby appearance, laughing at him and asking how a mendicant clad in tattered clothes could bend a bow and hit a target. They gave him a bow and arrow. He bent the bow but it could not bear the power of his arms and broke into pieces. They gave him another one, which he also broke. After he broke the third bow the Rind nobles grow a bit suspicious that he might be Sheh Murid. They sent someone to fetch Murid Khan's bow, which was made out of steel and was called jug (yoke) because of its form and weight. The epic tells us that this famous weapon had been tossed in a pen for sheep and goats after the \\"master of the iron bow\\" had departed and it had no owner to care for it. Because of its weight and toughness, it was useless in the hands of anyone else. When it was turned over to him, Sheh Murid caressed and kissed it, gently touching the strings as if they belonged to a sacred instrument; he scrutinized every inch. Then, as a master archer, he rolled up his beggar's mantle, bent the bow with great skill, and shot three arrows from it, passing one through the hole left by the previous one. The Rind's suspicion that this beggar was in fact Sheh Murid was confirmed after the trial of the bow. The Rind nobles stopped Murid and a servant was sent to ask Hani for Murid's distinguishing signs and marks, which she would know because they had played together as children. Hani told of a sign on the upper left thigh, which her bracelet had made, and another one behind the eyebrow. When the Rinds checked the signs, they at last recognized Sheh Murid. =Union and departure to unknown world= Although Mir Chakar married Hani, he was unable to consummate the marriage. Whenever he approached Hani, he would freeze as if paralyzed. For years he carried on this way and realised that Hani can never truly be his. When he found out that Sheh Murid had returned, he yold Hani that Sheh Murid was a great man and deserved her, so he divorced her and told her she was free to go to Sheh Murid. Hani, who had not forgotten her first and only love, decided to go to him, she told him that Mir Chakar had realised his mistake and has now freed her so that they (i.e. Sheh Murid and Hani) could be together. But Sheh Murid told her that he had now reached a different level and cannot step down from that level to take her she was a means by which he had reached closer to Allah. He took leave of her. On the following day Murid visited his father's camel herd, chose a white she-camel, mounted her, and disappeared from mortal eyes. He has become the immortal saint of the Baloch, and the common belief among the Baloch is that: ta jahan ast, Sheh Murid ast (Until the living world, Sheh Murid remains immortal.)

Function  IRF3 is a member of the interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF) family. IRF3 was originally discovered as a homolog of IRF1 and IRF2. IRF3 has been further characterized and shown to contain several functional domains including a nuclear export signal, a DNA-binding domain, a C-terminal IRF association domain and several regulatory phosphorylation sites. IRF3 is found in an inactive cytoplasmic form that upon serine/threonine phosphorylation forms a complex with CREBBP. This complex translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of interferons alpha and beta, as well as other interferon-induced genes. IRF3 plays an important role in the innate immune system's response to viral infection. Aggregated MAVS have been found to activate IRF3 dimerization. A 2015 study shows phosphorylation of innate immune adaptor proteins MAVS, STING and TRIF at a conserved pLxIS motif recruits and specifies IRF3 phosphorylation and activation by the Serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1, thereby activating the production of type-I interferons.

It was fought between the Clan Munro and the Clan Mackintosh (Chattan Confederation) on the south bank of the Beauly Firth at Clachnaharry, on the outskirts of Inverness. Background The Clan Munro were returning home after a cattle raid in Perthshire. On their return, an amount of \\"road collop\\" or passage money was demanded by the Clan Mackintosh, as was the custom in the Scottish Highlands. There was a dispute over the amount and a battle took place. Accounts of the battle The earliest account was written by Sir Robert Gordon (1580‚Äì1656) in 1630. Gordon's account states that the Mackintosh chief was killed. The Mackintosh's own account, which was written later in 1679 states that the chief of Mackintoshes was not present and was not killed at Clachnaharry, and only that the chief's grandson was present. Most later accounts appear to have been based on Gordon's original account. =17th century manuscripts= Sir Robert Gordon (1630) Sir Robert Gordon's account states that John Munro Tutor of Foulis was travelling home from the south of Scotland towards Ross. He fell at variance with some of the inhabitants of Strathdale between Saint Johnstone and Atholl who abused him. When Munro returned home he gathered all of his followers. He then singled out three hundred and fifty of the best and ablest men and went back to Strathardle to which he laid waste, spoiled, killed some of the people and carried away their cattle. On his return home he passed by the Isle of Moy and Mackintosh (chief of Clan Chattan) sent to him craving some of the spoils as was the custom. Gordon states that John Munro offered a reasonable portion, which Mackintosh through evil counsel refused to accept and would have no less than half of the whole booty. John Munro would not hearken or yield and continued on his journey home. Mackintosh then gathered all of his forces and followed John Munro who he overtook at Clachnaharry, beside Inverness, hard by the ferry of Kessock. Gordon states that Munro perceiving Mackintosh sent fifty of his men home to Ferindonald with the spoil and encouraged the rest to fight. There ensued a cruel conflict where Mackintosh was killed along with most of his company. Divers of the Munros were also killed and John Munro was left for dead on the field. Munro was taken by Lord Lovat to his house where he was cured of his wounds and was from then on known as John Baclamhach because his hand was mutilated. From this John Munro the Munro of Milntown family are descended\\". Wardlaw Manuscript (1674) James Fraser wrote the Wardlaw manuscrit in about 1674. Fraser states that in 1378 John Monroe was traveling home from Edinburgh and while resting in a meadow in Strathardle, the owners of the meadow cut off the tails of his horses. John Munro having returned home to Ross mustered the Monores and singled out 350 of the most resolute men. Monroe returned to Strathardle and carried away their strongest cattle such as horse, oxen and cows, and killed some of the men who resisted them. Monroe then returned home. However, while passing the Isle of Moy, Mackintosh, chief of Clan Chattan challenged Monroe for some of the cattle, as was the passing custom. The Wardlaw Manuscript implies that the Monroe Laird of Foulis was present and that he advised that a share of the booty should be given to Mackintosh. However, the cattle which Monroe of Milntown offered Mackintosh was not enough and Mackintosh would accept no less than half. Monroe continued on his journey and sent 50 of his men with the cattle into Fraser, Lord Lovat's country. Then Monroe with his 300 remaining men pitches on a litel levell near Clachniharry, taking advantage of the ground convenient for fighting. There ensued a most bloody battle between the Monroes and Mackintoshes, where in the first engagement the Laird of Mackintosh fell and his brother and second son were slain with him, with the prime part of his host and were defeated. Diverse of the Monroes were also killed but carried the day. It was computed that the Mackintoshes lost 200 men and the rest fled. John Monro was wounded and left among the dead but was found the next day by a woman and taken to Lovat where he was cared for. He was afterwards known as John Bach-klawach because one of his arms was mutilated. According to Fraser's Wardlaw Manuscript after the battle of Clachnaharry, John Munro who was wounded was cared for by the Frasers of Lovat, and that laid the foundation of kindness between the Frasers and Munros to this very day. Mackintosh of Kinrara (1679) Clan Mackintosh tartan in the Clan Munro exhibition at the Storehouse of Foulis Mackintosh of Kinrara states that in 1454 an unexpected contest sprung up between Malcolm Mackintosh, grandson of the chief of Mackintosh and John Munro, tutor of Foulis. Mackintosh states that a very keen contest followed in that John Munro was returning from a tour in the south and that a dissension took place between him and the inhabitants of Strathardle who loaded him with great abuse. Intent on revenge John Munro returned home and implored the assistance of his friends. At the head of two hundred chosen men he advanced with speed to Sthrathardle ravaged the country and carried off the herds of cattle. On his return at the River Findhorn he meets Malcolm Mackintosh by accident who demanded some of the plunder. John Munro offered Mackintosh twenty-four cows and a bull, which Mackintosh rejected, insisting on no less than one third. John Munro then proceeded on his way giving none. Mackintosh of Kinrara's account states that Malcolm Mackintosh then communicated to his friends and commanded the inhabitants of Petty and Lochardil to follow John and obstruct his passage until he, with his men of Strathnairn, shall have come up. They overtook John at Clachnaharry. John sent forty men off with the booty and encouraged the rest to fight in which a fierce conflict ensued. Mackintosh of Kinrara's account states that a few fell on each side. He goes on to say that John Munro was almost slain and left among the dead but Lord Lovat took care of his recovery. From John descended the family of Milntown. Mackintosh of Kinrara's account states that Malcolm Mackintosh was not present at the battle and that the same Malcolm Mackintosh later married Janet Munro, sister of John.Mackintosh of Kinrara. (1679). A Chronicle of the Family of Mackintosh to 1680. =19th century publications= John Anderson (1825) John Anderson states that the Munros, a distinguished tribe in Ross were returning from the south of Scotland when they passed by Moyhall, the seat of MacKintosh, leader of the Clan Chattan. Mackintosh demanded a share of the booty or road callop payable to a chief for travelling through his land, which was acceded to but the Mackintoshes met the proposal with contempt. The Munros, pursuing their journey, forded the river Ness a little above the Islands, and dispatched the cattle they had plundered across the hill of Kinmylies, to Lovat's province. Their enemies met them at the point of Clachnaharry and they immediately joined in battle. Anderson states that after and obstinate struggle Mackintosh was killed and that John Munro was left for dead on the field, and from the loss of his arm he was known by the name of John Baclamhach. Anderson goes on to say that the Munros were not long in retaliating and having collected a sufficient force, they marched in the dead of night for the Isle of Moy where the chief of MacKintosh resided. By the aid of some planks which they had carried with them, and now put together, they crossed to the Isle, and glutted their thirst for revenge by murder or captivity of all the inmates. William Anderson (1863) William Anderson says that John Munro whilst returning from Edinburgh had the tails of his and his servants' horses cut off while sleeping in a meadow in Strathardle. In revenge John Munro returned home and selected 350 of his best men and returned to Strathardle which he spoiled, killed some of the inhabitants and carried off their cattle. On his return, while passing the castle of Moy the laird of Mackintosh sent a message to him demanding some of the spoil. Anderson goes on to say that this was customary among the Highlanders when a party drove cattle so taken through a gentleman's land, and the part so exacted was called a Staoig Ratliaid or Staoig Crtich that is, a road collop. Munro offered Mackintosh a reasonable share of the booty but Mackintosh would accept no less than half. This Munro refused and drove off the cattle. Shaw states that Mackintosh collected his clansmen and pursued Munro and came up with him at Glach-na-haire (Clachnaharry), near Inverness. Munro perceiving this approach sent fifty of his men home with the cattle and that in the ensuing contest, Mackintosh and the greater part of his men were killed. Several of the Munros were also killed and John Munro himself was left for dead on the field of battle. Lord Lovat had him carried to his house where he was cured of his wounds. One of his hands was so mutilated, that he lost the use of it, on which account he was afterwards culled John Bac-Lniinh, or Ciotach. Anderson states that the Munros had the great advantage of the ground, by taking up a position among rocks, from which they annoyed the Mackintoslies with their arrows\\"... Mackintosh-Shaw (1880) According to Alexander Mackintosh- Shaw, writing in 1880, the account of the feud given by John Anderson in his history of the Frasers (1825) is far from being in harmony with the account given in the Mackintosh of Kinrara manuscript from 1679. Mackintosh-Shaw states that the Kinrara manuscript shows that it was not the chief of Clan Mackintosh who led the pursuit of the Munros but the chief's grandson who was also named Malcolm Mackintosh. This Malcolm was the son of the chief's youngest son Gillichallum who had been killed at the Battle of Craig Cailloc against the Clan Cameron in 1441. According to Mackintosh-Shaw the Kinrara manuscript suggests that the younger Malcolm's actions were taken without the chief's concurrence and that the chief was certainly not killed, nor present at the Battle of Clachnaharry. John Munro having offered Malcolm Mackintosh 24 cows and a bull, Mackintosh would accept no less than half and Munro continued on his journey having given non. Mackintosh sent his forces to attack John Munro, but according to the Kinrara manuscript Malcolm Mackintosh did not arrive until the battle was over and \\"went away sorrowful for what had come to pass through his hastiness\\". According to Mackintosh-Shaw the loss was equal on both sides. He goes on to state that the alleged retaliation by the Munros which included passage through Inverness which was a town always favourable to the Mackintoshes as well as through the most thickly populated part of Mackintosh country, is scarcely credible. Shaw (1882) Shaw states that in 1454 a shameful and bloody conflict happened between the Mackintoshes and the Munros. Shaw states that John Munro, tutor of Foulis was on his return from Edinburgh and that he rested in a meadow in Strathardle where the owner of the meadow cut off the tails of John's and his servant's horses. John Munro then returned with three hundred and fifty men, spoiled Strathardle and drove away their cattle. While passing Loch Moy Mackintosh sent to ask a Stike Raide-Staoig Raithid- or Stick Criech-Staoig Crech that is, a Road Callop; a custom among the Highlanders, that when a party drove away spoil through a gentleman's land they should give him part of the spoil. Munro then offered what he thought was reasonable but Mackintosh demanded more and pursued the Munros at Clachnaharry, near Inverness. Shaw states that they fought desperately and that many were killed on each side including the Laird of Mackintosh, and that John Munro was wounded and afterwards called John Bacilach. Shaw states that the Munros had the great advantage of ground by lurking among the rocks; whilst the MacKintoshes were exposed to their arrows. Clachnaharry Monument \\"Munro\\" \\"Chattan\\" The Clachnaharry Battle Monument marks the clash between the Munroes and the Mackintoshes (Clan Chattan). The monument was built by Major Hugh Robert Duff in 1821. The monument did once include a tall column about 40 ft to 50 ft high, but it fell over in gales in 1951. One side of the monument reads \\"Munro\\" and the other side reads \\"Chattan\\" facing the two clans respective territories.

Ryan. The act gave the President authority \\"to prohibit the transportation in interstate and foreign commerce of petroleum... produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted... by any State law.\\" The act was named after Senator Tom Connally. It revived the provisions of Section 9 (c) of the NIRA and added procedural safeguards, which, the Supreme Court argued, were constitutional. Ostensibly enacted to protect the industry from \\"contraband oil,\\" it was mainly a way of cartelizing the industry to stabilize falling prices. The new law reestablished the NIRA's original provision that violators would receive a maximum jail sentence of six months but also increased the maximum fine penalty from $1000-which was enacted in the NIRA- to $2000. Though the legislation was intended to expire on June 16, 1937, it was maintained afterwards as a permanent law. There was some debate as to the law's effects on the transport of other fuels such as coal and timber, and many independent oil producers vehemently opposed the government regulations. In 1937, four federal courts upheld the Connally Act, which was later administered by the Federal Petroleum Board, also created by the law, within the Department of the Interior.

(CCCC) is a majority state- owned, publicly traded, multinational engineering and construction company primarily engaged in the design, construction and operation of infrastructure assets, including highways, bridges, tunnels, railways (especially high-speed rail), subways, airports, oil platforms, and marine ports. CCCC has been a contractor for numerous Belt and Road Initiative projects.  History  CCCC's predecessors can be traced back to the Qing Dynasty, when the Junpu Engineering Bureau was established in 1905. The company was officially formed in 2005 by the merger of China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) and China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), which focus on transportation infrastructure and marine infrastructure, respectively. In 2006, the company listed shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, followed by a listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2012. The company has numerous subsidiaries including John Holland Group, which is an Australia-based construction company focused on infrastructure, and Friede & Goldman, which engineers offshore vessels for the oil and gas industry. In 2009, the World Bank Group debarred CCCC for eight years due to fraud on highway projects in the Philippines. In that year, the company allegedly transferred $19 million to Teodorin Obiang, son of the President of Equitorial Guinea, according to a 2013 US asset- forfeiture case. In 2010, one of CCCC's subsidiaries, China Habour Engineering Company, won the contract to build the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port. In 2018, Bangladesh banned the China Harbour Engineering Company, a CCCC subsidiary, after attempted corruption to win a highway tender. CCCC is active in dredging projects in areas under dispute in the South China Sea, highway- building in Xinjiang, and building naval logistics installations at Gwadar Port.

History Walthamstow Hall was founded in 1838 and is one of the oldest all-girl independent schools in the country. It was founded as an inter-denominational mission school and home for the daughters of Christian missionaries. It provides an 'all-through' education with a Junior School for girls aged 3‚Äì11 and a Senior School for girls aged 11‚Äì18. The school is named after the village of Walthamstow where it was founded. In 1838 the village was five miles from London. It moved to the site in Holly Bush Lane, Sevenoaks on 17 May 1882. The Junior School moved to its present site in Bradbourne Park Road following the closure of St Hilary's School in 1992. In 1838 five little girls sat on five wooden stools made for them at the opening meeting of the school and home for missionaries' daughters in Marsh Street, Walthamstow. Mrs Foulger was a founder and benefactor of the school and created the first band of helpers to set up the school and care for the children of missionaries working in remote places including India and China. The school was the first of its kind in the country and daughters of all evangelical missionaries were received, including the Church Missionary Society until it opened its own school. In 1837 the year before the school was founded, Victoria became queen and her position and character did much to help their cause. The 19th Century was a ground-breaking century for the recognition and education of young women. Pioneers of female education were a hard-headed, hard-working, idealistic and common sense group of middle-class, Christian women. Subjects taught included reading, writing, accounts, English, history, geography, and Latin. Languages and sciences were considered important as girls were expected to enter the missionary service in later years. Male students were sent to The School for the Sons of Missionaries (founded in 1842 by Mr Foulger in Walthamstow, Dr Bell's in Stockwell in 1852, to Blackheath in 1857 and then Eltham College in 1912) set up under similar circumstances. In 1873 three Walthamstow Hall pupils were entered for the Cambridge Examination for the first time. Two passed and one with honours. The next year, a student called Mary Wallis received Lady Goldsmith's Latin Prize, a distinction attained by only 15 girls in England. Between 1841 and 1878 girls who left Walthamstow Hall went on to live challenging lives: 57 became teachers, 37 were wives of ministers or missionaries, 18 became missionaries, 8 went into clerical work, 4 became nurses, 3 became doctors, 1 became a milliner, one a school matron and one a wood engraver. From just five girls in 1838 the school expanded rapidly and despite many building extensions and leasing of the adjoining property it was obvious that the site was just not big enough. The school continued to grow and the waiting list ever increased. Walthamstow was no longer a country village as the railway had arrived. 10 years later it was decided to move to Sevenoaks. Mrs Foulger's daughter Emily, who many year later married the physician Philip Henry Pye-Smith, lived in Sevenoaks, and found a suitable site for the building of the new school. The architect was Edward C Robins (the same firm which built Caterham School in 1880). The foundation stone was laid at Sevenoaks on 26 June 1878 by the Rt Hon W E Forster MP. Four years later in 1882 the building was completed and the school community moved in. The same year the girls moved into their new Sevenoaks home, two whole classes were sent up for the Cambridge examinations. Throughout its history girls have gone on to make their mark on the world. Leavers in the late 19th century gained places and scholarships at universities. Some were the first women admitted to universities which historically had only ever admitted young men. The school was recognised in 1903. Girls had been taking the Cambridge Examinations but Miss Hare invited an inspection by the University of London so that their examinations could be taken instead. This evolved to become one General School Examination. In 1904 the Gymnasium then called the 'Play-Room' was opened in the same year that day-girls were first admitted after much consideration. Miss Hare had the burden of responsibility for the welfare and safety of the girls during the war years. As a result, the hardships which ensued made it possible for Walthamstow Hall and Eltham College, in a similar circumstance, to make a Joint Church Appeal for ¬£10,000 in 1921. They had the backing of the two Missionary Societies and the funding was received the following year. To ensure the future, negotiations were entered into with the Board of Education for the receipt of a Government Grant. Miss Ramsay was appointed as Miss Hare's successor in 1922. Miss Ramsay was keen to encourage extra curricular and cultural activities and even today the school holds a 'Ramsay Occasion' in her memory when a distinguished lecturer from the world of the Arts/Media is invited. From 1940 to 1945 Walthamstow Hall was in the battle zone of the Second World War. Miss Ramsay's spirit and cheerfulness belied the stresses and strains of her responsibility. On the night of 21 September 1940 when the new laboratory, craft rooms and old gymnasium were destroyed by bombs and damage caused to the whole school she remained undaunted, and as a result so too did the staff and 37 boarders who were in residence! Luckily no one was hurt. During this time Sevenoaks was in a reception area and the school became a clearing home for evacuees, first for mothers and babies. It also became an Air Raid Wardens' Post and members of staff shared a rota night fire-watching. During school-time raids, lessons and exams went on in the trenches which had been built in the grounds, the children sitting on their bunks. The flying bombs posed the greatest menace and there were many false alarms! One speech day took place partly underground until the skies cleared. Miss Ramsay arranged to evacuate the Junior Boarders and younger day girls to Attingham Park near Shrewsbury (shared temporarily with girls from Egbaston Girls School in Birmingham) near to where Miss Blackburn taught, and arranged regular three weeks' visits with specialist teachers dispatched to supervise the work. They moved to Pontesford House, 9 miles from Shrewsbury and stayed there until 1944. Nothing got in the way of the girls' education, not even the war! V.E. Day celebrations in 1946 were enjoyed and the school's close links with France re-established much to the delight of Miss Ramsay. The first French Assistante to be appointed since the war was celebrated with a French play in which Miss Ramsay had a starring role. Later that year she retired and was succeeded by Miss Emmeline Blackburn, one of Miss Ramsay's old scholars. In 1968 the headmistress reported to the governors that the Ordinary Level results were 'phenomenal' and in 1971 Oxbridge places were achieved in Geography, Medicine, French and German, History, English (2), Biology and French and Latin. This was a rough indication of standards. At this time the Governors were considering the provision of further accommodation for the Sixth Form and in 1970, Brentor, a house in Vine Court Road was officially opened as a Sixth Form Centre and renamed E. B. H. in honour of Miss Blackburn who was about to celebrate 24 successful and dedicated years as headmistress. In 1976 The Friends and Parents of Walthamstow Hall was launched (FPWH). The association has provided The Friends and Parents' Bursary Scheme since then. To this day no girl who can benefit should be prevented from attending for financial reasons. The buildings and grounds were developed steadily during the 1970s with generous gifts from an Eltham Old Boy, Mr Dudley Witting who made possible the development of a new suite of language rooms and major developments at the Junior School. Extensive fund-raising made possible the building of The Eric Salmon Wing, opened in 1975, which houses art studios, teaching suites, ICT and Junior Careers. This was named after the much respected chairman of the governors who served the school for many years. The last development during Miss Davies' custodianship was the building of the squash courts opened in 1984. One of the major benefits for these improved facilities was the development of the curriculum. Computer Studies became a firm addition in 1979 thanks to the improved facilities and equipment. Improvements to facilities in all departments continue to this day with an ongoing development plan which has similarities to the Forth Bridge! Responding to the demands of an ever-changing society the development in Careers Education has been a priority. It is now very sophisticated with multimedia tools, conferences, workshops and specialist conventions forming part of school life. Girls have many opportunities to sample the experience of work in the 'real world' armed with a thorough knowledge of what is expected of them. Work experience was introduced in 1984 for upper four (Year 9) and in 1987 a special link with Liberty's was created which provided management placements. Girls are still enjoying this valuable experience and travel widely to pursue valuable career experiences. Language students visit Germany and France to stay with 'exchange' families whilst they work for local businesses. The school's aims have always been to produce a balanced and rounded education with a timetable which offers a full spread of subjects for all pupils until the end of the Year 9. Chosen subjects for IGCSE are studied in Years 10 & 11 culminating in students achieving high grades in ten or more subjects. 'Twilight GCSEs' have been offered since 1995 offering girls the opportunity to study for additional IGCSEs such as Art and Ancient Greek after school in Years 10 and 11. A combination of four A Levels/Cambridge Pre-U is the norm in Sixth Form. Students are not restricted by pre-determined subject blocks. There is an extensive extra-curricular programme with many clubs enriching the academic curriculum. During the 1970s the link with the Voluntary Service Unit was strengthened. Founded jointly with Sevenoaks School in 1964. In 1989 the Ship Theatre was opened by Sir Geraint Evans. 'The Ship' is a purpose-built performing arts building which houses a theatre with 'thrust' stage and seating for 199, as well as practise and 'green rooms' for both music and drama departments. 'The Ship Festival' was held to commemorate the opening and has taken place every five years since. The theatre was refurbished to commemorate the school's 175th anniversary in the summer of 2013. Progress and improvement continue with great enthusiasm reflecting the spirit of adventure of those early missionaries who set sail for distant climes. Despite the passing of 169 years since its foundation, some things remain constant. The Christian ethos of the school is never far from the day's agenda, and girls elect the organisations and events they wish to support each term. In addition, the Christian Fellowship group is run by the girls with a lively programme of visiting speakers for those who would like to attend. Studying at Walthamstow Hall puts the foundations in place for successful, fulfilling lives in the 21st century. Girls with a Walthamstow Hall education behind them are confident that they have the knowledge, skills and experiences to excel in a competitive world. Headmistresses Mrs Foulger was a founder and benefactor of the school in 1838. Mrs Pye-Smith was succeeded by her own daughter and niece who also gave much of their lives to the care and responsibility of the girls ensuring the continuity and high standards of Mrs Foulger's vision. Miss Unwin's strict Victorian formality gave way to a more natural and spontaneous style under Miss Millar as Principal for two years until Miss Hare took over. Miss Hare as headmistress in 1901 and remained for 21 years. She reorganised the timetable and made more time for exercise and after school activities. Lessons were confined to the mornings and girls' health greatly improved. Miss Ramsey became headmistress in 1922 until 1946. Miss Emmeline Blackburn Miss Davies came as headmistress in 1970 after five years as principal of a government college in Nigeria for which she received an MBE. She stayed for thirteen years and oversaw some major changes both to the status of the school but also its physical development. In 1984 Mrs Lang became headmistress. An Old Girl of the school and a graduate of St Anne's College, Oxford, she was the first headmistress to be married and to have daughters. In 1988 the school celebrated its 150th year with a Service of Thanksgiving in Westminster Chapel. During Mrs Lang's tenure, the school gained its Ship Theatre (1989), a new Sixth Form Centre and Library. Mrs Jill Milner took over from Mrs Lang in 2002 and, like her predecessor, was a graduate of St Anne's College, Oxford. Mrs Milner was the first headmistress to be the parent of a Walthamstow Hall pupil. Before joining Walthamstow Hall, Mrs Milner held senior posts at Tonbridge Grammar School for Girls. Mrs Milner's headship oversaw major development of the school site including the Science Block (2004), a new swimming pool complex (2008) and new facilities for Drama, Music, Design and Technology. In her final term, the Lang Sixth Form Centre opened. Miss Stephanie Ferro became headmistress in January 2018. She continues the new tradition of being an alumna of St Anne's College, Oxford. All of the headmistresses' pictures are placed in the school dining hall. School motto The school's motto is Non Palma Sine Pulvere. The school jewels On the day that the ship theatre opened, Mrs Lang opened her front door and on the door step was a little box. She opened the little box and in it was a brooch of a ship (the school emblem). Mrs Lang called the brooch the school jewels and wanted it to be passed down from headmistress to headmistress. Traditions * There are 14 prefects with silver badges dating back to the start of the school. There are also 12 House Captains, a Music Captain and a Library Captain. Both Prefects and House Captains are elected by the students and teachers. The head girl and deputy head girls are chosen from the prefect and house captain vote. The current headgirl is Scarlett Goffin. Her deputies are Michela Cullum and Frances Shoobridge. * The prefects and house captains sit on stage behind the headmistress during prayers. * The Year 13s throw a party for the new Year 7s in their first term. * The six houses: Chartwell, Penshurst, Quebec, Montreal, Down and Knole all compete in house music, lacrosse and netball, tennis and rounders and athletics. * House points are given to girls who excel in subjects, do well in homework, for good behaviour, or when a teacher feels it necessary. These points are added up and awards are given to the girl with most points. * The House Cup is awarded at the end of each year to the house with the most points. * A note book is handed down from the outgoing head girl to the new head girl each year, containing useful advice on the role. * Speech day and prize giving is at the end of the summer term. Years 11, 12 and 13 are all expected to attend with their parents, who hear speeches from notable speakers, the headmistress and the outgoing head girl. Prizes are given to girls who have excelled in certain subjects over the years. Leavers ceremony The leavers ceremony is for the upper sixth to share their wisdom and secrets to the rest of the school. One student revealed that her mother had written one of her geography essays because she could not understand why her daughter was getting C's and D's. Her mother to her astonishment had received an Unclassified! After secrets are revealed the crossing over of the sixth form takes place. One by one a sixth former rises walks towards the headmistress and hugs her then sits down on the other side of the room. When a prefect crosses over she takes off her badge, hands it to the headmistress, hugs the headmistress, hugs the new prefect and sits down in the new prefects seat. The headmistress gives the badge to the new prefect and the new prefect sits in the old prefects' seat.

The city of Bristol began supplying municipal drinking water in 1858. To inform the public about the new water supply, Robert Lang made a proposal though the Bristol Times that public drinking fountains be constructed. Lang began the \\"Fountain Fund\\" in January 1859 with a donation of one hundred pounds. By 1906, there were more than 40 public drinking fountains throughout the city. In 1872, Alderman Thomas Proctor commissioned the firm of George and Henry Godwin to build the fountain to commemorate the 1861 presentation of Clifton Down to the City of Bristol by the Society of Merchant Venturers. Commemorative plaque The three-sided fountain is done in Gothic Revival style. The main portion is of limestone with pink marble columns and white marble surround. The commemorative plaque is of black lettering on white marble; the plaque reads, \\"Erected by Alderman Thomas Proctor, of Bristol to record the liberal gift of certain rights on Clifton Down made to the citizens by the Society of Merchant Venturers under the provision of the Clifton and Drudham Downs Acts of Parliament, 1861, whereby the enjoyment of these Downs is preserved to the citizens of Bristol for ever.\\" The fountain bears the coat of arms for the city of Bristol, the Society of Merchant Venturers and that of Alderman Thomas Proctor. The fountain was originally situated at the head of Bridge Valley Road. It became a sight impediment to modern auto traffic in the later 20th century. The fountain was moved to the other side of the road, closer to the Mansion House in 1987. After the move, it underwent restoration and was re-dedicated on 1 May 1988. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building since 1977.

The new settlement was called Andreasdorf (Andrew's village) probably because of the chapel being consecrated to St. Andrew. In the later epoch, the name of the village was changed to Kos. According to the date inscribed into the central arch, St. Andrew's church was finished in 1409. A Gothic chapel was part of the church. The interior of the chapel was painted with unique wall paintings which are now mostly destroyed. Modern era In the region of Prievidza, there is a mining industry of lignite and brown coal which influences the environment in the area. The chapel was situated in one of the affected parts of the village and was endangered. That is why the representatives of the regional restoration atelier of the Monumental institute in Bansk√° Bystrica decided to save this historical building. A unique transportation in Slovak history was planned and the 400 tonne chapel was transported using a wheeled transporter borrowed from Germany on December 6, 2000.

Wilson Company, 1977 Early life As a child Williams played several instruments. He received his formal education from N. Clark-Smith at Tuskegee University. By his late teens he had settled on clarinet, and soon afterwards formed the first of many bands he was to lead over the coming years. Career From 1919 to 1923 he led his own band before moving to Chicago and joining Ollie Powers. In 1923 he formed a new group in order to back the variety act Dave and Tressie and traveled to New York with them in 1924. There he led a trio in Albany as well as a band that played at the Rosemont Ballroom. In 1926 Williams formed the Royal Flush Orchestra. The popular hot jazz outfit held residency at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom for most of its life and recorded on the Victor, Vocalion, Gennett, Okeh, Brunswick, Champion, and Harmony labels. Williams, Frank Marvin, and Perry Smith supplied vocals. The flamboyant Williams typically performed wearing a white suit and top hat. During this time he recorded many of his own compositions such as Friction, Here 'Tis and his highest selling record, Hot Town. In 1928 Williams traveled to Chicago where he temporarily fronted Dave Peyton's band at the Regal Theatre. Calling the group Fess Williams and His Joy Boys, he recorded two sides with them for Vocalion Records. The Royal Flush Orchestra continued to operate in his absence, and in 1929 he returned to New York to resume his duties. The Royal Flush Orchestra recorded its last side in 1930. Williams remained active as a bandleader, but as the decade progressed his sound became outdated. He fell out of favor with the public and eventually retired from performing full-time to sell real estate. He continued to lead bands periodically during the 1940s and beyond. James P. Johnson, Fess Williams, Freddie Moore, Joe Thomas 1948. Photography by William P. Gottlieb. Playing style Williams played in a style reminiscent of Ted Lewis only less smoothly. He also specialized in the style of Gas Pipe Clarinet which is when the instrument is used to produce all kinds of honks, growls, squeaks and effects that sounded like animal noises, laughter or other sounds you would not expect to hear from a clarinet. He was also a fine exponent of slap tonguing, and utilized circular breathing. This is shown off in his composition Playing My Saxophone. The Town Hall Concert Williams came from‚Äîand fathered‚Äîa musical family; his brother Rudolph was a saxophonist and clarinetist, his sons Rudy and Phil were both saxophonists, and his daughter Estella was a pianist and vocalist.

It is on the west bank of the Snake River and the north bank of Pine Creek, downstream of a feature of the Snake River known as The Oxbow. Copperfield Park, managed by Idaho Power, occupies the former town site. The Geographic Names Information System also lists Copperfield as a variant name for Oxbow, Oregon. Early history According to the historian Lewis McArthur, the town was formed in the late 1890s as \\"Copper Camp\\", and was inhabited by prospectors of the local copper ore; However, the Oregon writer Stewart Holbrook asserted that \\"there was no copper in Copperfield\\", and that the community \\"had one purpose; namely, to cater to the uninhibited appetites of more than two thousand men who were engaged on two nearby construction projects.\\"Holbrook, Stewart. \\"The Affair at Copperfield\\", reprinted in Wildmen, Wobblies and Whistle Punks (Corvallis: Oregon State University Press, 1992), p. 74 Copperfield was platted around 1898, along a Northwest Railway Company line that never developed. Soon the locality was known as \\"Copperfield\\" and a post office established in 1899. The population grew to 1,000 by 1910 because two tunnels were being dug near The Oxbow by the local railroad company and by the predecessor of the Idaho Power Company. This railroad activity was described as a \\"brawling railroad construction camp\\" during this period by Barbara Ruth Bailey. Martial law As Holbrook describes it, \\"early in 1913 the construction jobs began to peter out. Fewer men were employed. Competition for the remaining trade became stiff. The saloon keepers began feuding.\\"Holbrook, p. 74 With stories of arson, the town acquired a reputation for lawlessness. When the county authorities failed to get control of the situation, Governor Oswald West announced he was sending his secretary, Fern Hobbs, with a signed declaration of martial law to clean up the place. The locals, who had been led to believe she was travelling alone, were surprised by state militia who had accompanied Hobbs and enforced martial law on the town after she read the declaration to its inhabitants. A few months after Hobbs' intervention, a fire \\"of unknown origin destroyed a block or two of the jerry-built structures. No saloon ever reopened.\\"Holbrook, p. 81 Ghost town There were two more fires, and then the post office closed in 1927, essentially turning Copperfield into a ghost town. In 1965, however, the community of Oxbow was founded near the site of Copperfield when the Idaho Power Company was building the Oxbow Dam. The former site of Copperfield is now a park run by Idaho Power.

It is located in the Sant Mart√≠ district, bordering Eixample, at the junction of three of the city's most important thoroughfares: Avinguda Diagonal, Avinguda Meridiana and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes. Currently it serves largely as a roundabout of elevated highways. However, beginning in the early 2000s, and as of 2007, revamping project for Gl√≤ries has started, which is aimed to give the square a new role in Barcelona and revitalize the northern districts of the city, under the name 22@. These plans supplement other large- scale plans in Sagrera and the F√≤rum area. The first installment of this project was the construction of the controversial Torre Agbar skyscraper.  History  The Cerd√† plan, c. 1850. Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries is the large square in the centre. Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries, which was then well outside the city, was originally featured in the mid-19th-century Cerd√† plan for Barcelona, intended as a large public square in a new city centre, but it remained sparsely developed, turning into one of Barcelona's major road and railway junctions. Eventually the railways were closed or went underground, and around 1990 the road junction was reshaped into the current large elevated roundabout with a park at its centre, with pedestrian access beneath the roads. In March 2016, ongoing excavations as part of the area's redevelopment uncovered extensive remains of el Rec Comtal, an important aqueduct possibly dating back to Roman times, which until the mid-20th century brought water from the Bes√≤s river to the city.  Current uses  Large portions of the square are occupied by parking lots and its central area is surrounded by concrete walls, part of the not very aesthetic elevated highways. The rest of the square hosts a shopping centre (the Centre Comercial Gl√≤ries), a secondary school (IES Salvador Espriu), and the Torre Agbar. The square also serves as the venue for one of the city's most renowned traditional open-air marketplaces, Els Encants Vells.  Els Encants  The new Encants market Since 1928, Gl√≤ries has been the location of one of Europe's oldest open-air flea markets, known as els Encants Vells or Fira de Bellcaire, which is said to date back to the 14th century, and operates four days a week. The market was formerly housed on an area of land at the north-western side of the square, but as part of the redevelopment of the area a new development has been built at a site at the south-western end of the square, consisting of a multi-level construction to provide covered walkways, modern facilities for the traders, and parking for customers.  The project  Gl√≤ries and its immediate area is planned to become a park with a multitude of services including a public library, a major underground train station (served by RENFE and Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya), a public clinic, a sports centre as well as a museum of design. Integration with other buildings already completed in the area (Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, L'Auditori and Mercat dels Encants) is a key component of proposed redevelopment. Furthermore, the three major thoroughfares that cross Gl√≤ries partially laid underground to make room for open green space.

Born in Kingston, Ontario, he separated from his family at a young age, spending many years in the United States as an itinerant circus musician. He was a performer on piano, calliope, and alto horn. His circus associations on record include: Mighty Haag Circus, Downie & Wheeler Circus (1912); Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus (1922); Sells-Floto Circus (1923); and Ringling Bros & Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows (1924-26). He was with Robbins Bros. Circus (1928‚Äì29) whence his Robbins Bros. Triumphal March arose, and Miller Bros. 101 Ranch Wild West Show, and Walter L. Main Circus (1930‚Äì31). Hughes worked as composer and arranger for the Waterloo Music Company of Waterloo, Ontario, from 1932-1935. At other times, Hughes worked as arranger in the Whaley, Royce and Cundy- Bettoney publishing houses. According to his own account, Hughes wrote band music in the USA for much of his life, under various pen names, including Arthur Wellesley and H W Arthur. In his 70s, Hughes returned to Kansas, which he considered his home. It is reported that he died in an indigent ward in a New York City hospital in 1950.

It opened in 1858, at first without a connection to the main line at Rhyl, but this was provided in 1862. At Denbigh the line later connected to other lines. Although the area became popular with holidaymakers in the 1920s and later, the line never realised its potential, and it closed to passengers in 1955, and completely in 1968. Conception The Chester and Holyhead Railway completed its main line in 1850. There was a considerable area of agricultural land south of the line, towards Denbigh, and a number of schemes were put forward to serve the area. The C&HR; found itself short of funds to complete its main line, so it was left to independent promoters to put a scheme forward. This proved to be the Vale of Clwyd Railway, which was authorised by Parliament on 23 June 1856. Contracts for construction were awarded to David Davies and Thomas Savin.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 575Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1976, , pages 65 to 68 Opening The Vale of Clwyd Railway The line was in length, built as a single line with space on the formation for double track later. Construction was fairly rapid, and the line opened on 5 October 1858, for passengers and goods. There were four trains each way every weekday. The Denbigh station was a temporary structure, and the permanent building opened in December 1860. Stations were at Foryd, Rhuddlan, St Asaph, Trefnant and Denbigh. A VoCR director, Whitehall Dod, had the right to stop trains adjacent to his estate at Llannerch, a mile north of Trefnant, until December 1871 when that right expired.Baughan refers to this on page 67 as Nannerch, but he is confusing the name with a station between Mold and Denbigh. Llannerch is properly referred to by Rear, page 57. There was also a siding for a brickworks at the locality. The siding was extended during World War II for use in connection with an army stores depot.John Peile, Biographical Register of Christ's College, 1505 to 1905, volume II, Cambridge University Press, 1913, page 382Bill Rear, From Chester to Holyhead: the Branch Lines, Oxford Publishing Company, Hersham, 2003, , page 57 Getting to Rhyl, and Foryd In 1860 the Company sought powers to enter Rhyl station with their trains; the station was on the main line, now controlled by the London and North Western Railway. The LNWR was agreeable, but demanded reciprocal running powers to Denbigh, obviously an unequal trade. The deal did not go ahead. Hugh Robert Hughes of Kinmel Hall owned land at Foryd beach and a pier there, from which he operated steamers. He had hoped that the Vale of Clwyd Railway would run to his pier and make connections there, but this would have involved crossing the Chester and Holyhead Railway main line, and that company objected, chiefly because they feared competing steamer traffic to Liverpool from Hughes' pier. However the VoCR had laid a temporary branch siding to the beach from their Foryd station, for the purpose of acquiring track ballast. Hughes took possession of the branch siding, saying that he would use it for ordinary railway purposes, and connecting with the VoCR at Foryd station. The C&HR; forcibly ejected Hughes' men from the branch line, but Hughes secured an injunction in his favour, and the short branch was operated as a full railway to and from the pier. The feared steamers to Liverpool operated in connection. However the steamer operator discovered that the VoCR was negotiating with the LNWR to lease the line to the larger company; other internal hostilities surfaced, and the VoCR was riven with dissension. Connecting to other lines Denbigh was not destined to be a terminus; a south-eastward railway, the Denbigh, Ruthin and Corwen Railway was authorised on 23 July 1860; coupled with the Vale of Llangollen Railway and a Corwen extension, a viable route from Ruabon was likely to be created. At this time there was every likelihood of the Great Western Railway reaching Rhyl, an important regional centre, via the lines from Ruabon via Llangollen and Corwen. For some time this seemed inevitable, but in time the GWR lost interest and the scheme was not pursued.Baughan, page 68 On 30 June 1862 the extension sought by the pier owner Hughes was passed in Parliament; now the VoCR could legally reach the beach and a new pier, and a proper junction with the C&HR; line (now under LNWR control) could be made. Goods traffic started in the latter half of 1864, and (after some difficulty) the extension was passed for passenger operation, but this was never acted on.Baughan, page 72 Train services In December 1862 the Oswestry newspaper reported that additional passenger services would be provided by attaching passenger coaches to goods trains: > much increased accommodation, making‚Ä¶ six trains daily between Rhyl and > Denbigh and five between Ruthin and Rhyl... the Company do not of course > guarantee exact time with the goods trains, having made these arrangements > at the request of several inhabitants... in the Vale.Oswestry Advertiser, > December 1862, quoted in Baughan, page 74 In 1864 the LNWR was formally authorised to work the VoCR line (as they had been doing informally) and the company was absorbed by the LNWR by Act of 15 July 1867.Baughan, pages 74 and 75 1895 passenger train service Bradshaw's Guide for 1895 showed the train service: there were six trains each way between Denbigh and Rhyl, calling at all stations. Most of the trains made reasonable connections at Denbigh.Bradshaw's Rail Times for Great Britain and Ireland: December 1895, reprint, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2018, After 1923 At the beginning of 1923, the railways of Great Britain were grouped into one or other of four new large companies, under the Railways Act 1921. The LNWR was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway. Seaside holidays were increasingly popular, and the North Wales coast was an attractive destination. The passenger trains service was augmented accordingly, and seventeen trains ran each way daily in the summer in the 1930s.Baughan, page 79 Nevertheless the line remained a rural outpost, and use of the line declined: it was closed to passengers on 19 September 1955 and completely from 1 January 1968. Today, the tracked remains intact as far as St Asaph before the line is severed by the North Wales Expressway. From Rhuddlan to Denbigh, the line has been built on.

It first opened in 1858 as part of the Vale of Clwyd Railway, and afterwards under the auspices of several different companies. The station closed to passengers on 19 September 1955, some seven years after nationalisation. History The railway at Rhuddlan opened on 5 October 1858 as part of the Vale of Clwyd Railway, which connected with the station at Rhyl railway station for the Chester and Holyhead Railway. At opening, Rhuddlan station had a single platform on the east side of the line. While there was a passing loop for trains, this did not have a platform for a second train to stop. The station building was brick built, while a goods store on the platform was constructed out of wood. The platform storage was increased in 1879, when a second room was built. Access was provided by the road towards Abergele, which passed over the tracks south of the station via a railway bridge. There were steps down from the bridge directly onto the platform for foot passengers, while a side road was constructed for vehicles. There was a near disaster in June 1921 when a car came off the bridge and went down a steep bank, ending a few feet short of the platform just prior to the arrival of a train. The London and North Western Railway took control of the Vale of Clwyd Railway in 1864, and absorbed it into its services on 15 July 1867. They were absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1924. When nationalisation took place in 1948, the station formed part of British Railways London Midland Region. The station was host to a LMS caravan from 1934 to 1939. Camping coaches were also positioned here by the London Midland Region from 1955 to 1968, most years there were four coaches, but only three in 1957 and 1958 and just two in 1955. It closed to passenger services on 19 September 1955. Trains continued to pass through the station until the line was closed on 1 January 1968, with the track lifted shortly afterwards. Site today The station was demolished and only some fence posts and steps down from the road bridge remain.

A LLWAS master station polls each remote station every system cycle (nominally every ten seconds) and provides prevailing airport wind averages, runway specific winds, gusts, may set new wind shear alerts or microburst alerts and reset countdown timers of elapsed time since the last alert. By airline rules, pilots must avoid microbursts if warnings are issued by an automated wind shear detection system, and must wait until a safe time interval passes, to assure departure or landing conditions are safe for the performance of the airframe. Pilots may decide whether to land (or conduct a missed approach) after wind shear alerts are issued. LLWAS wind shear alerts are defined as wind speed gain or loss of between 20 and 30 knots aligned with the active runway direction. \\"Low level\\" refers to altitudes of or less above ground level (AGL). Arriving aircraft on descent, generally within six nautical miles of touchdown will fly within this low level, maintaining a glide slope and may lack recovery altitude sufficient to avoid a stall or flight-into-terrain if caught unaware by a microburst. LLWAS microburst alerts are issued for greater than 30 knot loss of airspeed at the runway or within three nautical miles of approach or two nautical miles of departure. Microbursts in excess of 110 knots have been observed. Each LLWAS equipped airport may have as few as six or as many as thirty-two remote stations. Each remote station uses a tall pole with anemometer and radio-telecommunication equipment mounted on a lowerable ring. Remote station wind measurements are transmitted to a master station at the Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), which polls the remote stations, runs wind shear and gust front algorithms, and generates warnings when windshear or microburst conditions are detected. Current observations and warnings are displayed for approach controllers in the terminal radar approach control facility (TRACON) and for local and ground controllers in the air traffic control tower. Air traffic controller (ATC) users at local, ground and departure positions in the ATCT relay the LLWAS runway specific alerts to pilots via voice radio communication. Recent wind shear alerts may also feature in radio broadcasts by the automated terminal information system (ATIS). LLWAS wind shear and microburst alerts assist pilots during busy times on final approach and on departure, often when heavy traffic, low ceilings, obstructions to vision, and moderate to heavy precipitation add to the difficulty in determining in just a few seconds whether mounting wind and weather hazards should be risked or avoided. Related activities in the United States The original LLWAS system (LLWAS I) was developed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 1976 in response to the 1975 Eastern Air Lines Flight 66 windshear accident in New York and the findings of Project NIMROD by Ted Fujita. LLWAS I used a center field anemometer along with five pole mounted anemometers sited around the periphery of a single runway. It was installed at 110 FAA towered airports between 1977 and 1987. Windshear was detected using a simple vector difference algorithm, triggering an alarm when the magnitude of the difference vector between the center field anemometer and any of the five remotes exceeded 15 knots. The LLWAS II deployment included software and hardware upgrades to the existing LLWAS I to improve the windshear detection and reduce false alarms. Between 1988 and 1991, all of the LLWAS I systems were upgraded to be LLWAS II compliant. Windshear deployment studies conducted from 1989 through 1994 determined at which LLWAS-II sites weather exposure justified upgrade to a weather radar (Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) or Weather Systems Processor (WSP)) an LLWAS Network Expansion (LLWAS-NE) or LLWAS- Relocate/Sustain (LLWAS-RS) upgrade, singly or in combination. By 2005 all LLWAS-II had been decommissioned for one of these replacement wind shear detection systems or for two in combination. The LLWAS-NE added the ability to cover more than a single runway, using up to 32 remote stations to provide runway specific alerts for parallel and crossing runways at ten large airports in combination with TDWR. The LLWAS-RS further upgrades service at 40 remaining LLWAS-2 operating sites (not justified for a radar solution) to employ LLWAS-NE algorithms and extend service life by 20 years, in part by adding ultrasonic anemometers with no moving parts. The LLWAS-RS program began in response to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation of the USAir Flight 1016 accident at Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1994. From that accident, a determination was made that LLWAS-II must regain and retain its original capability, often degraded by tree growth and airport construction such as hangars that obstruct or deflect wind near LLWAS remote station sensors.

Early life Fleming was born as Edward Heddy Jr. in Santa Paula, California, the only child of Edward and Mildred (Anderson) Heddy. Born with a club foot, he needed crutches to get around and was often severely beaten by his father. At the age of eight, he attempted to kill his father with a gun, which jammed. He left home shortly after, first to Los Angeles, and then to Chicago, where he lived roughly and associated with gangsters, doing odd jobs for them to make money. At the age of 11, after being wounded in a gunfight between some gangsters and hospitalized, he was returned home to his mother, who had recently divorced. During the Depression, he dropped out of school and worked at various jobs until he joined the Merchant Marine, before joining the United States Navy in 1942 for World War II. He served as a Seabee in a naval construction battalion. He received severe facial injuries during a bet in which he was attempting to lift a weight and had to undergo extensive plastic surgery to reconstruct his forehead, nose, and jaw. Before this, Fleming had always thought himself \\"ugly\\" and considered the incident a \\"wonderful balance of values.\\"Eric Fleming- Rawhide Star, actor, trivia.ellenthorp.com; accessed May 1, 2018. After his facial reconstruction, he returned to Paramount Studios, where he had been working as a construction worker, grip, and carpenter. He made a bet with an actor that he could do a better audition. He lost the bet and it cost him $100 and \\"I lost a lot of pride too, which hurt but the $100 hurt worse.\\" Upon deciding that acting had cost him $100, and acting would get it back, he entered acting classes at the studio in the evenings. Fleming's acting debut came in a road company production of Happy Birthday. He appeared on stage in Chicago and in a number of successful Broadway plays, including the musical Plain and Fancy. He began acting in television shows about the same time. Fleming then moved to Hollywood and starred in several low-budget films, including Fright, Curse of the Undead, and the cult classic Queen of Outer Space. Rawhide In 1958, the 6-foot, 3¬Ω-inch () Fleming landed the starring role as trail boss Gil Favor in Rawhide. Set in the 1860s, Rawhide portrayed the challenges faced by the men of the cattle drive from San Antonio, Texas, to Sedalia, Missouri. Producer Charles Marquis Warren called on the diary written in 1866 by trail boss George C. Duffield to shape the character of Favor: a savvy, strong, and fair leader who persevered and got the job done.The Legend of Rawhide ‚Äì The Katy Depot, Sedalia Missouri The top-rated Western, with co-stars Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, and Paul Brinegar, ran from 1959 to 1966. Fleming and Eastwood more or less rotated in playing the lead from week-to-week, but the former was always billed first. Fleming also co-wrote two Rawhide scripts‚Äî\\"Incident of the Night on the Town\\" (season three, episode 29) and \\"A Woman's Place\\" (season four, episode 25). Fleming, Wooley (trail scout Pete Nolan), James Murdock (Wishbone's clumsy meal assistant Mushy), Robert Cabal (wrangler Hey Soos), and Rocky Shahan (drover Joe Scarlet) were all dismissed by Ben Brady during Rawhide‚Äôs summer 1965 hiatus prior to shooting the eighth season. The recently installed sixth executive producer of Rawhide had been tasked with revitalizing the series and reversing declining ratings. Fleming boasted to TV Guide that \\"CBS fired me because they were paying me a million dollars a year\\" (only $220,000 to be exact).\\"Rawhide Star Eric Fleming Had the Roughest and Most Rugged Life of Any TV Star\\", MeTV (Weigel Broadcasting). Retrieved March 4, 2020. With Eastwood promoted against his better judgment to trail boss, the cattle drive limped on for 13 episodes before CBS chief William S. Paley preemptively axed it that December.\\"I Used to Watch Rawhide As a ...\\", TV Guide (CBS Interactive). Retrieved March 4, 2020. Another cancellation factor, according to Eastwood, was that \\"Rawhide had been the network's only show to get a rating on Friday night, so they switched us to Tuesday opposite a show with the same type of male audience, Combat!\\" (ABC's gritty World War II drama involving the Western Front). The Glass Bottom Boat and Bonanza Fleming rebounded with a supporting role as a suave spy in The Glass Bottom Boat, a Doris Day comedy vehicle, and also guest-starred in three episodes of the number-one rated, family-themed NBC Western Bonanza alongside Michael Landon (as Little Joe Cartwright) and action director William Witney. Effective as the sadistic Wes Dunn in the titular \\"Peace Officer\\" from season seven, Fleming was brought back by series creator David Dortort for the subsequent season to star as honorable Mormon rancher Heber Clauson in \\"The Pursued\\", a two-parter exploring religious persecution and intolerance. The first installment was aired only four days after Fleming‚Äôs untimely demise.\\"Eric Fleming\\", Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Retrieved May 7, 2017. High Jungle and death Fleming signed to topline High Jungle, an adventurous two-part episode of the short-lived MGM Television-ABC Off to See the Wizard anthology also intended for theatrical distribution in Europe. Six weeks into the location shoot in Peru, Fleming and co-star Nico Minardos were in a dugout canoe that overturned in the Huallaga River. Minardos managed to swim to safety. Fleming was swept away by the current and drowned on September 28, 1966, at age 41, leaving behind fianc√©e Lynne Garber. High Jungle remains lost, but photographs survive.

Inca cuisine originated in pre-Columbian times within the Inca civilization from the 13th to the 16th century. The Inca civilization stretched across many regions, and so there was a great diversity of plants and animals used for food, many of which remain unknown outside Peru. The most important staples were various tubers, roots, and grains. Maize was of high prestige, but could not be grown as extensively as it was further north. The most common sources of meat were guinea pigs and llamas, and dried fish was common. Foods There were also several types of edible clay, like pasa, which was used as sauce for potatoes and other tubers, and chaco, something used by the poor or religiously devout. As in the rest of Central and South America, chili peppers were an important and highly praised part of their diet.Coe p. 179-180 =Vegetables= The people of the Andes developed hundreds of varieties of potatoes. Most of them are still unknown in the rest of the world. The Inca realm stretched north-south, encompassing a great variety of climate zones. In Peru in particular, the mountain ranges provide highly varied types of growing zones at different altitudes.Coe p. 169-170 The staples of the Incas included various plants with edible tubers and roots like potato and sweet potato, in hundreds of varieties. Slightly over 4,000 types are known to Peru and were domesticated in the region since middle to early 3000 B.C. There was also oca (oca), which came in two varieties, sweet and bitter. The sweet variety could be eaten raw or preserved and was used as a sweetener before the arrival of sugar made from sugar cane. Similar to oca in purpose, paiko (Dysphania ambrosioides), was a part of Inca diet for flavoring and edible leaves. Coe p. 181 Species of the Chenopodium family in the Inca cuisine were Chenopodium pallidicaule, also known as ca√±ihua, and Chenopodium quinoa, or quinoa, due to their ability to survive in the high altitudes of the Andes. Quinoa has grown popular in the modern world beyond the Andes due to its adaptability, nutritional value, and many uses.Jacobsen p. 168 Another high-altitude plant in Inca cuisine is Lupinus mutabilis, also known as tarwi or chocho. High in protein, this plant was often eaten with chilis and onions after being carefully treated, since improper treatment can leave the crop poisonous. Like chocho in protein count, Ahipa (Pachyrhizus ahipa) was another crop in Inca cuisine. It grows rapidly and has a high yield rate of the tubers that was cherished for its sweet taste like water chestnuts.Foster p. 100 Another tuber consumed in the Andes was Tropaeolum tuberosum, also known as mashua and a√±u in Quechua, due to its resistance to droughts and frost. It specially prepared and cooked to bring out the flavor that was desired as it was very bitter before doing so. So much so that it was considered an aphrodisiac and given to the Inca soldiers during campaigns to make them forget about their spouses. Coe p. 184 Other roots that could be found in the Inca cuisine were the maka (Lepidium meyenii) and the yac√≥n (Polymnia sonchifolia). Maka was capable of surviving in the coldest and highest areas of the Andes, thus giving it high value. Yac√≥n was documented to be similar to a turnip in texture but was very sweet and kept well, making them popular on sea voyages. Coe p. 185 The insipid, starchy root ullucu, and arracacha, something like a cross between carrot and celery, were, like potatoes, used in stews and soup. Achira, a species of Canna, was a sweet, starchy root that was baked in earth ovens. Since it had to be transported up to the power center of Cuzco, it is considered to have been food eaten as part of a tradition. Although the roots and tubers provided the staples of the Inca, they were still considered lower in rank than maize (Zea mays).Coe pp. 180-183 It has been found that the Inca conquered lands were often transitioned from potato fields to maize fields, more than likely due to it being the main ingredient of chicha. Several species of seaweed, such as Porphyra, Durvillaea antarctica, and Ulva lactuca were part of the Inca diet and could be eaten fresh or dried. Some freshwater algae and blue algae of the genus Nostoc were eaten raw or processed for storage. In post-colonial times it has been used to make a dessert by boiling it in sugar. Pepino, a refreshing and thirst-quenching fruit, was eaten by common folk, but scorned by \\"pampered folk\\" and were considered difficult to digest.Coe pp. 181-190 Another fruit that was available to the Incas was the passion fruit (Passiflora spp.) which was actually named so by the Spanish conquistadors and explorers due to the claim that the flowers of the plan contained the symbols of the passion of Christ. The fruit itself is like a pomegranate as they both have a mass of seeds covered by juicy flesh. A fruit that was described as an interesting snack available in the Andes during the time of Inca Empire was the paqay (Inga feuillei), or the guaba, which was known for it sweet, spongey substance that covers it seeds.Coe p. 188 A lesser valued fruit within Inca cuisine was the lucuma (Lucuma bifera) which was difficult to consume and had little flavor. Opposite to the lucuma in popularity, due to their tender texture and the sweet juice they produce, were the almonds within Caryocar amygdaliferum of the Chachapoyas. They were luxury goods for many generations as many have been found within early tombs of the region. The various fruits and vegetables of the Incas allowed for a diversity in flavor to be introduced to the world when the Spanish explored South America, creating so many new possibilities for those in the world of the culinary arts. =Meats= Two modern Peruvian dishes of cuy meat Peoples of the Altiplano had two large domesticated animals: llamas and alpacas. They were kept for their wool and used as pack animals that were often used in large caravans. The llama in particular was highly valued, and a white llama adorned in red cloth with gold earrings would often go before the Inca ruler as a royal symbol. Animals were believed to represent various gods depending on what color they had and were sacrificed in great number and the blood was used as a ritual anointment. The control over the sacred animals was very rigorous. Shepherds had to preserve every last part of any animal that died and present a full animal to the Inca or risk severe punishment. Among the food products made from the Peruvian camelids was sharqui, strips of freeze- dried meat, the origin of modern-day jerky. Another meat for royalty was that of the lizards known as Dicrodon holmbergi. It would be trapped as it attempted to consume the pods of Prosopis juliflora. After being trapped, it would be paralyzed and cooked until it was easily skinned. Afterwards, it was cooked for another ten minutes in heated sand and ashes then gutted, thus making it to be consumed immediately or preserved for up to a year.Coe pp. 213 The meat of the common folk was the cuy, guinea pig. They were domesticated by 2000 BC and were easy to keep and multiplied rapidly. Guinea pigs were often cooked by stuffing them with hot stones. The entrails would often be used as an ingredient in soups along with potatoes, or made into a sauce. They could also be used for divination, which later brought them into disfavor by the Catholic Church.Coe p. 171-175 The Incas hunted game including the wild camelids vicu√±a and guanaco, whitetail deer, huemul deer and viscacha, a kind of chinchilla which was hunted with lassos. Hunting rights were controlled by the state and any meat would go into the state warehouses for storage. In massive royal hunts, hunting teams would force huge herds into enclosures, and there are reports of several thousand animals being caught in a single great hunt, including puma, bear, fox and deer.Coe p. 176-7 One mainstay of the Inca army and the general population was dried fish. Limpets, skates, rays, small sharks of the genus Mustelus, mullets and bonito were among the fish caught off the Peruvian coast. Other sea creatures like seabirds, penguins, sea lions and dolphins were eaten, as were various crustaceans and chitons, mussels, chanque (an abalone-like animal). Like other American peoples, the Inca ate animals that were often considered vermin by many Europeans, such as frogs, caterpillars, beetles, and ants. Mayfly larvae were eaten raw or toasted and ground to make loaves that could then be stored.Coe p. 177-8 The power of the Inca Empire was mighty and one of the most impressive and the advocation for storage and preservation of foods is one of the many factors that allowed for such success. Food preparation Cooking was often done by putting hot stones in cooking vesselsCoe p. 175 and there was extensive use of the huatia, a type of earth oven and the paila, an earthenware bowl. The Inca often got through times of food shortage because they were able to preserve and store many of their crops. It is estimated that at any given time in Incan history, there were three to seven years worth of food in the state warehouses. In the high elevations of the Andes, the Inca people would begin the process of making chu√±o by setting out potatoes and similar tubers out in the dry days and cold nights would freeze-dry them in a matter of days. The farmers would help the process by covering the crops to protect them from dew, and by stomping on them to release the excess water quickly. This tradition has carried on through generations as the Q‚Äôero people of Peru make chu√±o a staple of their diet to survive in the harsh environment of the highlands that they call home. In addition to fruits, vegetables and roots, the Inca also preserved meat by drying and salting it, making for complete nutritional stores. The English word jerky comes from the Quechua term ch'arki, used to primarily to refer to the sun-dried meat of the llama. For the preparation of the meats within Inca cuisine, a popular and efficient method was to dry various fish and meats. They would dry these meats for storage in the warehouse of the Inca Empire by various methods of food drying, including allowing the meats to dry by sunlight or, especially in the highlands, by freeze-drying.Coe p. 179 These food preservation techniques, combined with their far-reaching road system, allowed the Inca Empire to withstand droughts and to have the means to feed a standing army.Popenoe et al. 1989 To reward such feats, the Inca empire practiced the ritual use of chicha. Chicha can be made from a variety of ingredients depending on the region and/or nation and can come in a variety of came come in a variety of colors such as red, yellow, or even gray. The type of chicha that was held with high esteem amongst the Incas was the chicha made with maize. An extremely potent form of this type of chicha is known as sora, which is prepared in differing ways such as burying the maize in the ground until sprout or chewing the maize. Whichever it way it was done, the maize would then be cooked and strained through cloth with clean water making a brew of chicha.Coe p. 204 After the brewing process and the chicha was ready for consumption, it would consumed in vessels that made of varying materials such silver and gold. However, perhaps the most interesting were the ones made of wood known as keros, which often have elaborate designs and bold colors. Quinoa, a staple plant of the Incas, was used in various ways. The leaves were often used for stews and soups. Quinoa was also used as a substitute maize in the production of chicha. The seeds were often toasted then pulverized to make various types of bread.Coe p. 182  See also  * Peruvian cuisine * Bolivian cuisine * Chilean cuisine * Ecuadorian cuisine * Muisca cuisine Notes References *Coe, Sophie D.

In some English-language Bibles, the word is transliterated as ezob. The Septuagint translates the name as ·ΩïœÉœÉœâœÄŒøœÇ hyssop, and English translations of the Bible often follow this rendering. The Hebrew word ◊ê◊ñ◊ï◊ë and the Greek word ·ΩïœÉœÉœâœÄŒøœÇ probably share a common (unknown) origin.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, 1989, s.v. hyssop In the Bible, ezov is described as a small plant found on or near walls,1 Kings 4:33 with an aromatic odour.Numbers 19:6Jewish Encyclopedia Maimonides, Saadia Gaon and earlier Jewish commentators identified ezov with za'atar,Based on the Judeo-Arabic translation of the word in the works of Rabbi Saadia Gaon (in his Tafsir, a translation of the Pentateuch, Exo. 12:22), David ben Abraham al-Fasi (in his Hebrew-Arabic Dictionary of the Bible, known as \`KitƒÅb JƒÅmi ø al-AlfƒÅ·∫ì\`, vol. 1, s.v. ◊ê◊ñ◊ï◊ë), Rabbi Jonah ibn Janah (Sefer HaShorashim - Book of the Roots, s.v. ◊ê◊ñ◊ë - aleph, zayn, bet), Maimonides (in his Mishnah Commentary, Nega'im 14:6) and Nathan ben Abraham I in Mishnah Uktzin 2:2. The problems with identification arise from Jewish oral tradition where it expressly prohibits Greek hyssop, and where the biblical plant is said to have been identical to the Arabic word, zaatar (Origanum syriacum), and which word is not to be associated with other ezobs that often bear an additional epithet, such as zaatar farsi = Persian-hyssop (Thymbra capitata) and zaatar rumi = Roman- hyssop (Satureja thymbra). See: The Mishnah (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, s.v. Negai'im 14:6 (p. 696); Parah 11:7 (p. 711). which may refer to various local herbs, including marjoram, oregano and thyme, which have aromatic and cleansing properties, grow wild in Israel, and can easily be bunched together to be used for sprinkling. The book of John in the New Testament (written in Koine Greek) mentions that hyssop was used, along with vinegar, to alleviate the thirst of Jesus, during his Passion. Matthew and Mark mention the occasion but refer to the plant using the general term Œ∫Œ¨ŒªŒ±ŒºŒøœÇ (k√°lamos), which is translated as \\"reed\\" or \\"stick.\\" Origanum has short stems and some scholars say it would have been too short to reach the mouth of Jesus during crucifixion.Catholic Encyclopedia A number of scholars have proposed that ezov is the caper plant (Capparis spinosa), which the Arabs call azaf. A modern herbal: Hyssop The caper is native throughout the Mediterranean Basin, and considered to have cleansing properties. Ritual use Caper plant The Israelites used ezov in the Passover ritual when they were enslaved in Egypt, according to the Hebrew Bible and Old Testament, to sprinkle lamb's blood on the door posts and lintels of the slaves' quarters in which they lived, so that GodExodus 12:23 would pass over them as he slew the first-born of the Egyptians.Exodus 12:22 The Israelites used ezov more regularly for other rituals when they had settled in Israel. It was used in the ritual for cleansing from leprosyLeviticus 14:4-7, 14:49-51 and for ritual purification.Numbers 19 In Psalms, the sprinkling of ezov is used metaphorically to refer to purification of the heart.Psalm 50 (septuagint numbering), Psalm 51 (masoretic numbering) The Roman Catholic Church and some sects interpret ezov as hyssop and have adopted the biblical practice of sprinkling with water to ritually cleanse objects, including churches and people, in a ritual termed aspersion during the Asperges.

Spencer's debut first-class match came in the 1993 County Championship, though he only played one further match before signing for Western Australia in time for the 1994 Sheffield Shield. Western Australia finished in third place in the league during Spencer's season at the club. Just three months after the end of the competition, he played once again in the County Championship, though he made little impact in the four games in which he played and Kent finished the season in midtable as Spencer dropped out of the county game with back trouble, but not before Sir Vivian Richards rated Spencer as the fastest bowler he had ever faced.Robin Smyth; Recalling Duncan Spencer, the cricketer who lived fast and bowled even faster; 16 September 2016 After six years out of the Western Australian side, he returned to play six one-day matches for WA in the 2000/01 season and after the last of these matches, he returned a positive drug test to the anabolic steroid nandrolone. He was found guilty and suspended from all competitive cricket for 18 months. Spencer claimed that it was taken to relieve the pain caused by chronic back injuries.John Polack; Spencer outed for eighteen months; 19 April 2001 Spencer returned to sign for Sussex at the age of 34, signing for the start of the 2006 County Championship season. However, Spencer played just one County Championship match following his return, moving to Minor Counties outfit Buckinghamshire during the second half of the season. Spencer was on the losing side of the 2006 Minor Counties Championship final. Throughout his career, he played as a lower-order batsman, particularly during his matches in England.

They are popular in Christian countries because of their derivation from the name of one of the first Christian saints, Catherine of Alexandria. Origin and meaning The name originated from the Greek or (, ), which is of uncertain etymology. The earliest known use of the Greek name is in reference to Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The theory that the name comes from Hecate, the name of the Greek goddess of magic, is regarded by the editors of the Oxford Dictionary of First Names as unconvincing.Patrick Hanks and Kate Hardcastle, eds., Oxford Dictionary of First Names, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 154. In the early Christian era it came to be associated with the Greek adjective (), meaning \\"pure\\", leading to the alternative spellings Katharine and Katherine. The former spelling, with a middle a, was more common in the past and is currently more popular in the United States than in Britain. Katherine, with a middle e, was first recorded in England in 1196 after being brought back from the Crusades. Also, to be considered because of the phonetic and meaning similarities, is the ancient Hebrew female name Keturah, Hebrew: ◊ß÷∞◊ò◊ï÷º◊®÷∏◊î - Ktura - in general understanding, most likely meaning incense. (With 'Keturah' then meaning \\"lighted incense with its smoke rising upward to God\\".) According to the scriptures [Genesis 25: 1  4 and 1 Chronicles 1: 32  33 ] Keturah was the woman who became the subsequent wife of the Biblical patriarch Abraham after the death of his first wife, Sarah. [See Keturah.] It is debatable whether she was a concubine or a free woman, as Sarah was dead and Keturah had never been previously mentioned.  Popularity and variations  = English = In Britain and the U.S., Catherine and its variants have been among the 100 most popular names since 1880. The most common variants are Katherine, Kathryn, and Katharine. The spelling Catherine is common in both English and French. Less-common variants in English include Katheryn, Katharyn, Kathryne, Katherin, Kathrine, Catharine and Cathryn. refers to 1912-2011: the order is Kathleen (rank 33), Catharine (rank 40), Katharine (42), Kathryn (72), for 2011 the order is Katherine (61), Catherine (161), Kathryn (237), Kathleen (632). Kathleen or Cathleen, an Anglicized form of the Irish form Caitl√≠n, has become established in the US among people with no Irish background, but is less popular in England and Wales. The form Karen, of Danish origin, is now often considered an independent name in English. Diminutives include Katie, Katy, Kate, Kathy, Kathe, Kath, Kay, Kat, Katya, Katyusha, Kitty, Kit, Kasia and others. = Other languages = *ŒëŒπŒ∫Œ±œÑŒµœÅŒØŒΩŒ∑ (Ekaterini, Aikaterini) (Greek) *Akaterina

It faces the town of Chertsey and is the fifth-lowest of the forty-four locks along the non-tidal course of the river. Owing to a course alteration both banks at the site of the lock have been since medieval times in Surrey. Stone-built Chertsey Bridge built in 1785 is 210 m south (downstream) of the lock. The lock was built by the City of London Corporation in 1813, lengthened in 1893 and again in 1913. The lock adjoins a small thin island created in its building accessible by boat that connects Chertsey Weir. History Upstream lay shallows known to ground boats, Laleham Gulls; to resolve this, proposals including the building up of banks, a weir and lock were made. The land was surveyed for a lock in 1793, producing a Bill which was disallowed by parliament. An 1805 proposal followed for a cut along the length of Laleham, with a pound lock at the lower end; it was resisted by local landowners. A proposal was authorised by parliament in 1810 a short way upstream which Lord Lucan, owner of the manor of Laleham, asked to have modified to be out of view of his home which he expended monies in building and redesigning, hosting in the same era the temporarily ousted Portuguese monarch, Laleham Manor House (later apartments in a listed building). A new Act in 1812 authorised the downstream site where building was implemented. The lock was opened in 1813 and the lock-house on the left bank completed. The lock was lengthened in 1893 and again in 1913.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles The lock was built with two compartments.

His feast day in the calendar of saints of the Coptic Church is February 12. Life He was born in Farshut, near the modern city of Hiww.Coquin, Rene-Georges and Martin S.J., Maurice. \\"Farshut\\", Coptic Encyclopedia, Vol.4, Macmillan, New York, 1991 His parents, who were Christians and locally important figures, died when Abraham was twelve. The next year, Abraham tried unsuccessfully to persuade his sister to retain her virginity. Thereafter, Abraham left to join the monastery of Pachomius. This monastery was at the time under the direction of Pshintbahse. There Abraham devoted himself to trying to achieve the monastic ideals. Abraham was elected abbot of the monastery on the death of Pshintbahse. Shortly thereafter, Justinian I requested that Abraham be brought to Constantinople, in an attempt to bring those monks who still rejected the decision of the Council of Chalcedon into communion with the greater church. The exact time of this event is unknown, but it is believed to have been between 535 and 548. Abraham brought with him four monks. Upon arrival, Justianian summoned them and informed them that they would either accept the decision of the Council or lose their positions. Abraham refused to entertain the idea, and was removed as archimandrite.Goehring, James E., Politics, Monasticism, and Miracles in Sixth Century Upper Egypt: A Critical Edition and Translation of the Coptic Texts on Abraham of Farshut, Mohr Siebeck, 2012, p. 38 Theodora tried to persuade Justinian to change his mind, seemingly to no avail. Abraham himself stated in a letter to his monks that he preferred to remain in exile rather than subscribe to a faith contrary to that of Athanasius. Abraham did return to Egypt, however, possibly due to persuasion from Theodora. Pancharis had been appointed to replace Abraham as archimandrite at Pbow. Abraham first went to the monastery of Shenoute, where he made a copy of the Rule. Then he set up a new monastery at Farshut with two other monks from the monastery of Moses. The new monastery contained a well and a garden. The number of monks grew, however, making it necessary for the buildings to be expanded. He also founded a convent of nuns at roughly the same time. Late in life, Abraham received a vision in which Pachomius, Petronius, and Shenouda the Archimandrite appeared to him, informing him of his upcoming death. Some people have suggested that this Abraham might be identical to the Abraham of Scetes commemorated in the same calendar on January 4. References Further reading *Holweck, F. G.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  Description  The Manitou Island Light Station consists of a skeletal steel light tower with associated keeper's house,Manitou Island Light Station form the state of Michigan, retrieved 8/19/09 outbuildings, and various walkways and foundations. The tower base measures square at the base and is high. The base supports a high skeletal tower, atop which is a cast iron ten-sided watch room and ten-sided lantern. A circular staircase covered with iron and lined with wood provides access to the watchtower. The original lens was a Third Order Fresnel Made by Le Paute of Paris and had six separate panels, each with a bull's eye prism. The current lens is also a Third Order Fresnel, with four panels inscribed P. Barbier and Co., Paris. The keeper's house is a ten-room, two-story frame structure on a stone foundation. It is sided with asbestos shingles (likely from the 1930s) and shingled with asphalt. The interior still has some original doors and woodwork, but much of the wall material and flooring are modern additions.  History  The first lighthouse on Manitou Island was a rubble-stone towerNATIONAL HISTORIC LIGHTHOUSE PRESERVATION ACT APPLICATION TO OBTAIN LIGHT STATION PROPERTY, Keweenaw Land Trust, Inc built in 1850. In 1861, the current light replaced it (one of three built that year with iron structure by the West Point Foundry in New York; the other two were De Tour Reef and Whitefish Point lights, the latter of which still stands and it and Manitou are the oldest iron skeletal light towers on the Great Lakes); the keeper's house was built the same year. A fog signal was added in 1871, and buildings to house it in 1875. These signals were refurbished in 1899. In 1895, an oil house was added, in 1901 a boathouse, and in 1930 a concrete fog signal building was constructed, replacing the earlier one. It is the oldest iron skeletal light tower on the Great Lakes. The light was automated in 1978, and is still in use as a navigational aid. In 2004, the Keweenaw Land Trust acquired the light from the United States Government, along with surrounding land, under the auspices of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act.Manitou Island Light Station Preserve from the Keweenaw Land Trust, retrieved 8/19/09 The area is open to the public, and is available for camping, rock collecting, hiking, boating, sea kayaking, fishing, and sightseeing.

When a variation of the official seal is applied to wristwatch movements, the Geneva Seal is the quality seal of the Watchmaking School of Geneva and it has an official purpose as defined by the law. The term is often mistakenly translated from the French as the \\"Geneva hallmark\\", as the word poin√ßon means \\"punch\\" and is the word used for hallmark. However, a hallmark is an official mark attesting to the fineness of a precious metal object. In this context the German translation of hallmark, which is \\"stempel\\" or \\"stamp\\" may be helpful to foster an understanding of and distinguish the terms. The motif of the Geneva Seal is the seal of the Canton of Geneva. This becomes evident when one translates its name from the German. As the reader may recall the official languages of Switzerland are German, French, Italian and Romantch (used in that order). But this issue about the translation is still a matter of debate because the term used by Timelabhttp://www.timelab.ch/en is the \\"Hallmark of Geneva\\". (Timelab is an organization which is composed of a centre for certifications (Hallmark of Geneva, COSC, Sport time-keeping) and a centre for Research and Development.) The Geneva seal in horology (watches), is a certification reserved for wrist watch movements made in the City or Canton of Geneva.

Precision testing, though not mandatory, is an option in the inspection process. Post Tenebras Lux (after the darkness, light) the Seal of the Canton of Geneva which is used as the mark for the Poin√ßon de Gen√®ve. General overview of the Geneva Seal The Geneva Seal is the quality seal of the City and Canton of Geneva. It is a certification reserved for wrist and pocket watch movements made in the City or Canton of Geneva. Although it is concerned mainly with the finishing and decoration of the watch movement, it is considered a high accolade in the industry. Precision testing, however, is an option in the inspection process. Among the Geneva watchmakers who regularly submit their movements for the Geneva Seal certification are: Cartier, Chopard, Roger Dubuis, Vacheron Constantin, Louis Vuitton and Ateliers deMonaco. This quality seal has been authorized since the enactment of the enabling regulation in 1886. Pursuant to the law only watches may carry the seal. The seal is concerned with the quality and finishing of the watch movement, however, it does not address the precision of the timekeeping mechanism. The seal is awarded to watches only after an \\"official examination\\" to discern whether the watch movement possesses all the required characteristics required for the accolade. The characteristics require, at a minimum, that the watch was made in or made on commission by a qualified Genevoise craftsman from the City or Canton of Geneva. A somewhat similar certification, the Qualit√© Fleurier or Fleurier Quality, which was begun on June 5, 2001, includes precision testing. Participants in this certification process include: Bovet Fleurier, Chopard, Parmigiani Fleurier and Vaucher Manufacture Fleurier. The law =The enabling statute= There are actually two pieces of legislation concerning the Geneva seal. The first is entitled Loi sur le contr√¥le facultatif des montres (law on the voluntary inspection of watches [from Geneva]). This is the enabling statute. I 1 25 - Loi sur le contr√¥le facultatif des montres =The specific regulations= The second piece of legislation is entitled R√®glement sur le contr√¥le facultatif des montres de Gen√®ve (Regulations for the Voluntary Inspection of Watches from Geneva); these are the regulations setting out the criteria for the award of the seal. These laws have undergone revisions since their initial enactments. The latest revisions were in January 1994.I 1 25.08 - R√®glement sur le contr√¥le facultatif des montres de Gen√®ve The methodology of the inspection system =The Office of Inspection at the School of Watchmaking= The methodology of the voluntary inspection requires that the watches are submitted to the Geneva Watchmaking School. The \\"Office for the Voluntary Inspection of Watches from Geneva\\" has, as a matter of law, been located at the school since the inception of the seal. =Background of the inspectors= In order to avoid the appearance of impropriety the inspectors must be Swiss citizens, must take an oath to discharge the duties of their office with fidelity and must not have any conflicts of interest, i.e.: they must not trade in watches. These obligations on the inspectors serve to warrant the proper conduct of the inspections and the awarding of the seals. The key points of the enabling statute The original enabling statute, Loi sur le contr√¥le facultatif des montres (Law on the Voluntary Control of Watches), was enacted on November 6, 1886, and was amended on May 27, 1891, November 15, 1958, and December 9, 1959. It established, in the canton of Geneva, an office for the voluntary inspection of the watches from Geneva at the School of Horology to examine and mark watch movements. In general, the watches may be marked if following an examination, they are recognized to have all qualities of good workmanship likely to ensure a uniform rate and durability and whose work, at a minimum was done on commission by workmen living the canton of Geneva. The actual regulations, requirements or criteria are contained in another piece of legislation. These regulation contain the 12 criteria required for a movement to obtain the seal. In the text of the regulation, dated December 22, 1993, effective January 6, 1994, the requirements or specifications are set forth. Only mechanical watch works which were assembled and regulated in the city or canton of Geneva may be submitted; the manufacturer must certify this fact. There are twelve (12) criteria for the quality of all components and their finishing. The workmanship of all of the movement's components, including those of complications must meet the requirements of the office of optional inspection. Only upon fulfillment of all the criteria may the watch receive the seal. The translated text of the Specific Regulations for Geneva Seal Watch Movements December 22, 1993 (effective January 6, 1994) Rules on the Voluntary Inspection of Watches from Geneva The COUNCIL of STATE of the Republic and canton of Geneva, considering the law of November 6, 1886, instituting in the canton an office of voluntary control of the watches from Geneva; considering its regulation of this day concerning the organization of the office of voluntary control of the watches of Geneva, decrees: Rules on the Voluntary Inspection of Watches from Genevahttp://www.timelab.ch/sites/default/files/Admission-conditions- Criteria-1.pdf _Compare_ Official translation =Art. 1 Admission requirements= 1 The mechanical movements of watches constructed in accordance with the best practices of the watch industry and whose construction is in conformity with the directions given to the controller to set the minimum level required for good workmanship are punched. 2 It is required that the assembly and adjustment are carried out in the canton of Geneva. The guarantee of work carried out is attested by a signed form by the submitter or manufacturers. This form must accompany the movements presented for inspection. 3 Movements carrying the punch of Geneva must be numbered. =Art. 2 Doubtful Cases= The superintendents assist the inspector in the case of dubious watches presented for inspection =Art. 3 Technical Requirements= 1 The good workmanship of all the parts of the caliber, including those of the additional mechanisms, must be in conformity with the requirements of the office of voluntary inspection of the watches from Geneva. Steel parts must have polished angles and their visible surfaces smoothed down. Screw heads must be polished, with their slots and rims chamfered. ;Jewelling 2 The entire movement must jeweled with ruby jewels set in polished holes, including the going train and escape wheel. On the bridge side, the jewels must be olive-drilled Montres/Watches: Terms of Art : ¬´mi-glace¬ªwith polished sinks. The jewel of the center wheel on the main plate is not required. By way of clarification, a friction bearing (jewel) cut with a olive profile is one where the inside surface is rounded or beveled at the top and bottom of the hole providing a reservoir for lubricating oil. ;Regulating Systems 3 The hairspring should be pinned in a grooved plate with a stud having a rounded collar and cap. Mobile studs are permitted. 4 Split or fitted indexes are allowed with a holding system except in extra-thin calibers where the holding system is not required. 5 Regulating systems with balance with radius of variable gyration are allowed insofar as they meet the conditions of article 3, subparagraph 1. ;Wheels 6 The wheels of the going train must be chamfered above and below and have a polished sink. In wheels 0.15 mm thick or less, a single chamfer is allowed on the bridge side. 7 In wheel assemblies, the pivot shanks and the faces of the pinion leaves must be polished. ;Escapement 8 The escape wheel has to be light, not more than 0.16 mm thick in large calibers and 0.13 mm in calibers under 18 mm, and its locking-faces must be polished. 9 The angle traversed by the pallet lever is to be limited by fixed banking walls and not pins or studs. ;Shock Protection 10 Shock protected movements are accepted. ;Winding Mechanism 11 The ratchet and crown wheels must be finished in accordance with registered patterns. ;Springs 12 Wire springs are not allowed. =Art. 4 Personnel in charge of inspection= The controller and his agents are only in charge of punching. They must comply to the decisions of the oversight commission. =Art. 5 Punching= 1 The punch is affixed on the mainplate and one of the bridges, except if that is a technical impossibility. The site can vary according to the caliber. 2 By exception, it can be affixed on a finished movement. =Art. 6 Requirements for obtaining a rate bulletin= 1 At the request of the manufacturer, a rate bulletin can be obtained in complement to the Geneva seal. 2 Criteria of obtaining a rate bulletin are defined according to the NIHS standard 95-11 ( a/k/a ISO 3159) for chronometers. 3 These bulletins are obtained through the Geneva office of COSC. =Art. 7 Chronometers= The watches having successfully undergone the rate tests can claim the title chronometer. =Art. 8 Rescinding Clause= The regulations on the voluntary inspection of watches from Geneva, of April 5, 1957, is repealed. =The name Geneva on watch dials= Apart from the Geneva Seal, some watches carry the name Geneva or Gen√®ve on their dials. The use of the name Geneva on a watch dial is governed by the Bureau de contr√¥le des Montres de Gen√®ve. To wear this badge, a watch must be a Swiss watch and at least one of the major operations in fabrication‚Äî either assembly of the movement or insertion of the movement into the case‚Äî must have been performed in the Swiss canton of Gen√®ve so that at least 50% of the total cost of production is incurred there.

The local racing track, Pannonia-ring is a testing circuit of Ducati. In 2008 Michael Schumacher tested a Superbike there. The village was first recorded in 1346 under the name Azzunfalva. By then it was already an important ferry point on the River R√°ba, and in later centuries also gained military strategic importance. Wooden bridges were constructed here, which were replaced by an iron bridge in the 19th century. The iron bridge was destroyed during World War II and the present bridge was built in the late 1960s. The village's first known lord was J√°nos L√∂k√∂s, who was stripped of his land and cattle in the 14th century. The forfeited properties were passed into the hands of the Kun originated Ost family, whose descendants were the later Osttfys. Besides them, the Csornai family, the T√∂r√∂k family from Enying, the Zichy family and the Vidos family all owned properties here, primarily gained through their marriage relationship with the Osttfys. The Osttfy- prefix in the village's name no doubt refers to the early landlords, but the origin of the latter part (asszonyfa: literally ‚Äûthe lady‚Äôs village‚Äù) has two interpretations. According to one it refers to the property right of a queen, and to the other it was to memorialize the Virgin Mary. The validity of the latter interpretation was reinforced by a 1758 source, which mentions the existence of a miracle-making icon of the Virgin brought here from Sopron County in 1620. The village had an old castle, which was built around 1250 in the marshy land at the confluence of the River R√°ba and the stream L√°nka. At the time of Ferenc Ostffy it was known under the name Snake Stone Castle (K√≠gy√≥k≈ë-v√°r). The castle was pulled down by the Garai family on the grounds that Ferenc Ostffy had revolted against King Zsigmond. Today what remains of the castle is known as Csonkav√°r.

The Roman Catholic Church with romanesque details History The village is first mentioned in charters in 1271 with the name: Byk. The church was built in the 12th century, so the village is even older. In 1461 the name of the village is Poss. Vinchefalwa Byk. The name corresponds to the old Vinczl√≥falva-Bik, which is now called Fels≈ë-B√ºkk. In the 15th century there were three Bik villages (Als√≥-B√ºk, Mank√≥-B√ºk and Fels√∂-B√ºk). The B√ºki Family was the landowner. Their descendants were the Mank√≥b√ºki Horv√°th, Mank√≥b√ºki Balogh and the Fels≈ëb√ºki Nagy families. P√°l Fels≈ëb√ºki Nagy was a famous member of the Hungarian House of Representatives in the 19th century. Other notable landowners were the Counts Cseszneky who bought Als√≥b√ºk in the 16th century.  Sightseeing  The cityhall =Baths= In the autumn of 1957, an investigation was made to establish the presence of oil in the region, but a hot water spring was found. The town built a baths in 1962. Later the water became a medical water and a new baths was erected in 1972 for all year use of the hot water baths. Around the bath several camp sites, hotels, boutiques, pensions and restaurants were built and in 1992 the 'recreation park' was opened as well. Today the bath in B√ºk is the second largest medicinal bath in Hungary. One of the most well known hotels in B√ºk is the Birdland Resort & Spa, which was awarded the Best Hungarian Wellness Hotel in 2007. =√Årp√°d age church= The church was devoted to the patrician of St Caliman, built in the 13th century. Later restored in gothic style (in 1408), and its tower was rebuilt in 1658. Between 1732 and 1757 the whole church building was renewed in baroque style. The murals are from this period. The virgin Mary Column is from the 18th century. =Old palace of the Fels≈ëb√ºki Family= The old palace of the Fels≈ëb√ºki Family was founded around 1790 by P√°l Fels≈ëb√ºki Nagy. Originally it was formed in the so-called coptic style. Later, in 1880 it was renewed in eclectic style.

The New York School of Applied Design building was built in 1908 and is now a landmarked building. The school became the New York Phoenix School of Design in 1944 when it merged with the Phoenix Art Institute, and in 1974, it merged with the Pratt Institute to form the Pratt-New York Phoenix School of Design. History =Early years= The school, originally located at 200 West 23rd Street, was established in 1892. The founder and driving force of the school, Ellen Dunlap Hopkins, was involved in the academic program, fund-raising among wealthy individuals, management, and administration. Design drawings for silk fabric exhibited at the New York School of Applied Design for Women; the instructor was Miss Johnstone. Unique at its time for providing advanced education to working class women, its purpose was that \\"of affording to women inspiration which may enable them to earn a livelihood by the employment of their taste and manual dexterity in the application of ornamental design to manufacture and the arts.\\" The school provided courses in illustration, book cover design, interior design, wallpaper and textile design, architecture, and a wide range of other art and design courses. The school, with an extensive art library, taught historic art and design classes for the students first two years at the school. It employed Henry L. Parkhurst of Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company to teach book cover design, Paul de Longpr√© taught watercolor flower painting, and Daniel Carter Beard taught animal drawing. The school arranged for the sale of artworks by graduates and students. Its original directors were James Carroll Beckwith of the Art Students League of New York and the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Reverend Dr. John Wesley Brown of Saint Thomas Church, lawyer and statesman Elihu Root, and Ellen Dunlap Hopkins. Its later supporters included John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan, and Adolph Lewisohn. Within two years of operation, two of its students were the first women to join the New York Sketch Club and a student was the first woman to have her work presented with male architects at the Architectural League. The school outgrew its rented quarters and rented additional space an adjacent building. Harvey Wiley Corbett, an architect and instructor at the school ran the Atelier Corbett and the school's architectural department, based upon the principles that he learned at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in France. When it was clear that a new building was needed, he engaged his students to work on the plans for the building, some paid at scale wages. =1908 landmark building= The New York School of Applied Design building, located at 160 Lexington Avenue on the northwest corner of Lexington Avenue and East 30th Street, is a neoclassical building of terra cotta, brick, and stone. The five-story building, built in 1908 and 1909, was designed by architect Harvey Wiley Corbett of the firm Pell & Corbett, and funded by J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller. The front entry on 30th Street has a double-paneled doorway and paneled spandrel, above which is a cornice and then a five-paned transom. Alongside the doorway are pilasters. The high ashlar base includes a bas-relief frieze made from casts of the Parthenon frieze held in the Elgin Marbles collection of the British Museum. Architectural features include ionic columns, a terra cotta entablature with classical moldings, and a terra cotta cornice with ornate acanthus scrolls and palmettes. On the fifth floor is a skylit studio. The steep gabled roof is made of tin and galvanized iron. By 1977, there had been no major changes to the original building design. At the time it was criticized in an Architecture magazine article as \\"drastically modern\\". Part of the frieze on the Lexington Avenue side of the building The building, which faces 30th Street, was designated a New York City Landmark in 1977 for its \\"special character, special historical and aesthetic interest and value as part of the development, heritage and cultural characteristics of New York City.\\" p.85 The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 16, 1982. In 1986, the building no longer housed an art school. The building, purchased by Altro Health and Rehabilitation Services, was used as vocational training center. Touro College purchased the building in 1990 or 1991. In 1992, the building underwent a $750,000 renovation, led by the architectural firm Lemberger Brody Associates, and became the school's Lexington Avenue campus, It has ten classrooms, a library, two reading rooms, and a laboratory. The building retains its oversized windows and skylights. Classes began in September 1992. Touro sold it in 2006 to Lexington Landmark Properties. It is now the site of Dover Street Market, having undergone an architectural project that reflects the design aesthetics of founder Rei Kawakubo, which was implemented by architect Richard H. Lewis. Within the interior of the building, is a glass elevator, three 60-foot pillars, and art installations. =Ongoing activities= By 1910, there were 4,000 women who had attended the school. Beginning that year, there was an affiliation with Columbia University that allowed the school's students to take courses at Columbia for two years, and then enroll in Columbia. The affiliation continued until 1912 when the Atelier Columbia was established; Atelier Corbett was a forerunner of this organization. Austin W. Lord was also an instructor of architecture courses. In 1915, architect James Monroe Hewlett and Anne Dornin where architecture instructors. For her role with the school, Dunlap Hopkins was awarded the Michael Friedsam Gold Medal. The citation stated, \\"Courageous leader in the education of women, student of the arts and friend of the artists, sympathetic teacher of young designers destined to improve by their work and their ideas the standards of art in industry, founder of the New York School of Applied Design and for 45 years its guide and counselor, devout adherent of the belief that the might of the fine design will make the right of successful industrial art.\\" She died in 1939. Architect Harvey Wiley Corbett eventually became President of the school in 1938, a position he held until his death in 1954. =Alumni= * Ruth Maxon Adams * Isabel Bishop * Rosina Cox Boardman * Bessie Marsh Brewer * Minna Citron * Mary Gannon and Alice Hands, cofounders of Gannon and Hands * Minetta Good * Dorothy Grider * Martha Brookes Hutcheson * Hildreth Meiere * Eugenie Shonnard * Nina Spalding Stevens Organizational changes =New York Phoenix School of Design= The school reincorporated as the co-educational New York Phoenix School of Design in 1944, after merging with the Phoenix Art Institute that was founded in 1925. =Merger with Pratt Institute= In 1974, the New York Phoenix School of Design merged with the Pratt Institute to form the Pratt-New York Phoenix School of Design, which offered three-year certificate programs in art and design at least into the late 1970s. In 1979, it was renamed the Pratt Manhattan Center. In 1986, the building was sold and it was no longer used as an art school. Records are archived at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.

Majorana syriaca (also Origanum maru, although this primarily refers to a hybrid of O. syriacum), bible hyssop, Biblical-hyssop, Lebanese oregano or Syrian oregano, is an aromatic perennial herb in the mint family, Lamiaceae. Etymology The plant may be called za'atar by association with its use in an herb-spice mixture. In Modern Hebrew, it is called ezov, and it may have been the ezob of Classical Hebrew.Based on the Judeo-Arabic translation of the word in the works of Rabbi Saadia Gaon (in his Tafsir, a translation of the Pentateuch, Exo. 12:22), Nathan ben Abraham I in Mishnah Uktzin 2:2, Rabbi Jonah ibn Janah (Sefer HaShorashim - Book of the Roots, s.v. ◊ê◊ñ◊ë - aleph, zayn, bet), and Maimonides (in his Mishnah Commentary, Nega'im 14:6). In many English translations of the Bible, ezov is rendered as hyssop, hence the common name for bible hyssop, believed to be a different plant generally identified with Hyssopus officinalis. The problems with identification arise from Jewish oral tradition where it expressly prohibits Greek hyssop, and where the biblical plant is said to have been identical to the Arabic word, zaatar (Origanum syriacum), and which word is not to be associated with other ezobs that often bear an additional epithet, such as zaatar farsi = Persian-hyssop (Thymbra capitata) and zaatar rumi = Roman-hyssop (Satureja thymbra) and zaatar mani = Calamint (Calamintha incana).The Mishnah (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, s.v. Negai'im 14:6 (p. 696); Parah 11:7 (p. 711). Description In habitat in the West Bank mountains Origanum syriacum grows to a height of 1 meter. The plant is pollinated by bees. Flowers are small and white or pale pink. Distribution Origanum syriacum is native to the Middle East. In Egypt, Origanum syriacum subsp. sinaicum is a very rare plant that grows on stony ground in Sinai Peninsula including the coastal Mediterranean strip. From the conservation point of view it is an endangered plant. Use It is a preferred primary ingredient in the spice mixture za'atar. So precious is this herb that in the Levant, Arabs will send out foraging parties to gather it. Origanum syriacum is harvested in the wild for use in preparing za'atar, a mixture of dried herbs, sesame and sumac for flavoring and garnish. However, it has recently entered cultivation due to high levels of demand.

In the case of ships and aircraft, the advent of Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation has enabled craft to follow navigational paths with such greater precision (often of the order of plus or minus 2 meters), that, without better distribution of routes, coordination between neighboring craft and collision avoidance procedures, the likelihood of two craft occupying the same space on the shortest distance line between two navigational points has increased. Research Robert E. MacholMachol, Robert E., Interfaces 25:5, September‚ÄìOctober 1995 (151-172), page 154., an American engineer who worked with the FAA, attributes the term \\"navigation paradox\\" to Peter G. Reich, writing in 1964,Reich, Peter G., \\"A theory of safe separation standards for air traffic control,\\" RAE Technical Reports Nos. 64041, 64042, 64043, Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, United Kingdom. and 1966,Reich, Peter G., \\"Analysis of long-range air traffic systems: Separation standards‚ÄîI, II, and III,\\" Journal of Navigation, Vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 88-96; No. 2, pp. 169-176; No. 3, pp. 331-338. who recognized that \\"in some cases, increases in navigational precision increase collision risk\\". He further notes \\"that if vertical station-keeping is sloppy, then if longitudinal and lateral separation are lost, the planes will probably pass above and below each other. This is the ‚Äònavigation paradox‚Äô mentioned earlier.\\" Russ Paielli wrote a mid-air collision simulating computer model centered on Denver, ColoradoPaielli, Russ A., \\"A Linear Altitude Rule for Safer and More Efficient Enroute Air Traffic,\\" Air Traffic Control Quarterly, Vol. 8, No. 3, Fall 2000.. Paielli notes that aircraft cruising at random altitudes have five times fewer collisions than those obeying discrete cruising altitude rules, such as the internationally required hemispherical cruising altitude rules. At the same vertical error, the prototype linear cruising altitude rule tested produced 33.8 fewer mid-air collisions than the hemispherical cruising altitude rules. Paielli‚Äôs model, made in 2000, corroborated an earlier 1997 model by PatlovanyPatlovany, Robert W., \\"U.S. Aviation Regulations Increase Probability of Midair Collisions,\\" Risk Analysis: An International Journal, April 1997, Volume 17, No. 2, Pages 237-248. showing that zero altitude error by pilots obeying the hemispherical cruising altitude rules resulted in six times more mid-air collisions than random cruising altitude. Similarly, Patlovany‚Äôs computer model test of the Altimeter-Compass Cruising Altitude Rule (ACCAR) with zero piloting altitude error (a linear cruising altitude rule similar to the one recommended by Paielli), resulted in about 60% of the mid-air collisions counted from random altitude non compliance, or 10 times fewer collisions than the internationally accepted hemispherical cruising altitude rules. In other words, Patlovany‚Äôs ACCAR alternative and Paielli‚Äôs linear cruising altitude rule would reduce cruising midair collisions between 10 and 33 times, compared to the currently recognized, and internationally required, hemispherical cruising altitude rules, which institutionalize the navigation paradox on a worldwide basis. The ACCAR alternative to the hemispherical cruising altitude rules, if adopted in 1997, could have eliminated the navigation paradox at all altitudes, and could have saved 342 lives in over 30 midair collisions (up to November 2006) since Patlovany's risk analysis proves that the current regulations increase the risk of a midair collision in direct proportion to pilot compliance.Patlovany, Robert, W., \\"Preventable Midair Collisions Since 26 June 1997 Request Denied for Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) 28996 Altimeter-Compass Cruising Altitude Rule (ACCAR),\\" Preventable Midair Collisions Since 26 June 1997 Request Denied for Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) 28996 Altimeter- Compass Cruising Altitude Rule (ACCAR) The Namibian collision in 1997, the Japanese near-miss in 2001, the √úberlingen collision in Germany in 2002, and the Amazon collision in 2006,Langwiesche, William, \\"The Devil at 37,000 Feet\\", Vanity Fair, January 2009 are all examples where human or hardware errors doomed altitude-accurate pilots killed by the navigation paradox designed into the current cruising altitude rules. The current system as described by Paielli noted as examples of other safety critical systems, nuclear power plants and elevators are designed to be passively safe and fault tolerant. The navigation paradox describes a midair collision safety system that by design cannot tolerate a single failure in human performance or electronic hardware. To mitigate the described problem, many recommend, as legally allowed in very limited authorized airspace, that planes fly one or two miles offset from the center of the airway (to the right side) thus eliminating the problem only in the head-on collision scenario. The International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) \\"Procedures for Air NavigationAir Traffic Management Manual,\\" authorizes lateral offset only in oceanic and remote airspace worldwide.Werfelman, Linda, \\"Sidestepping the Airway,\\" AeroSafety World March 2007, pages 40-45, Flight Safety Foundation . However, this workaround for the particular case of a head-on collision threat on a common assigned airway fails to address the navigation paradox in general, and it fails to specifically address the inherent system safety fault intolerance inadvertently designed into international air traffic safety regulations.[4] To be specific, in the cases of intersecting flight paths where either aircraft is not on an airway (for example, flying under a \\"direct\\" clearance, or a temporary diversion clearance for weather threats), or where intersecting aircraft flights are on deliberately intersecting airways, these more general threats receive no protection from flying one or two miles to the right of the center of the airway. Intersecting flight paths must still intersect somewhere. As with the midair collision over Germany, an offset to the right of an airway would have simply changed the impact point by a mile or two away from where the intersection actually did occur. Of the 342 deaths since 1997 so far caused by the lack of a linear cruising altitude rule (like ACCAR), only the head-on collision over the Amazon could have been prevented if either pilot had been flying an offset to the right of the airway centerline. In contrast, ACCAR systematically separates conflicting traffic in all airspace at all altitudes on any heading, whether over the middle of the ocean or over high-density multinational-interface continental airspace. Nothing about the Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) system design addresses the inherent vulnerability of the air traffic system to expected faults in hardware and human performance, as experienced in the Namibian, German, Amazon and Japanese accidents.[5] See also *Air traffic control *Air traffic controller *Gol Transportes A√©reos Flight 1907 *Law of unintended consequences References Category:Air navigation Category:Air traffic control Category:Decision-making paradoxes ","title":"Navigation paradox"},{"id":"11571909","text":"G√≥r is a village in Vas county, Hungary.

Along with Bleddyn Williams, Matthews formed a centre partnership which is regarded as one of the finest in the game. He was also a devastating tackler, once described as \\"a cross between a bulldozer and a brick wall\\". Matthews won 17 caps for Wales and six with the British Lions, though his career was curtailed by the Second World War. Matthews was a general practitioner by profession and travelled with the 1980 Lions on their tour of South Africa as the team doctor. Early history Born in Bridgend, South Wales in 1920, Matthews attended Bridgend County School before matriculating to the Welsh National School of Medicine. From a youth he was a keen sportsperson, and in 1937 he won the Welsh AAA junior 220 yards title.Hignal (2007) p. 112 A year later, after spending three seasons in the Welsh Secondary Schools rugby team, he played in a senior Wales trail, at just eighteen years old. In 1939 he came second in the Senior Men's AAA 100 yards and third in the 220 yards. Second World War With the outbreak of the Second World War, Matthews applied to join the Royal Air Force, but was required to train as a doctor at the Welsh School of Medicine. Matthews was later commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps. Bleddyn Williams, an RAF trainee and later Matthew's centre partner for Wales, played with Matthews for the first time whilst stationed in South Wales. The duo were part of a South Wales team that faced an Ack Ack XV in 1942. Williams was later switched to and trained as a glider pilot, attached to the Glider Pilot Regiment. Whilst stationed at RAF St Athan air base in the Vale of Glamorgan in 1943, Matthews fought future world champion Rocky Marciano in an amateur boxing match. Marciano famously ended his career having won every professional match he fought in, but Matthews held him to a draw. Rugby career Before winning his first cap, Matthews took part in five Victory Internationals for Wales, including the win over France in which he was captain.Hignal (2007) p. 113 Matthews played 17 Tests for Wales and six for the British and Irish Lions on their 1950 tour of New Zealand and Australia.Jack Matthews. lionsrugby.com He was the team doctor for the 1980 British Lions tour to South Africa, and was a medical doctor by profession. Matthews played centre for Wales and Cardiff ‚Äì forming one of the greatest midfield pairings Wales has ever had with Bleddyn Williams. Personal life After the war, Matthews married Valerie and the couple went on to have two sons, Peter and Robin. Valerie died in 1996. Later life Matthews continued his connection with sport after retiring from playing rugby. He maintained links with boxing, becoming the medical officer to the Welsh Boxing Association. He was also chosen to be the medical doctor for the 1980 British Lions tour of South Africa. Despite his close links with rugby, Matthews showed an uncompromising stance in his views on how the game should be played. In 2004 he publicly attacked Sir Clive Woodward's coaching methods before the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. In the 1981 Queen's Honours Birthday List, he was awarded the OBE. In 2009, Matthews suffered a severe stroke that left him speechless. He died in July 2012, aged 92.

Moore House, also known as the Moore-Dugal Residence, is a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The house was built one block south of Wright's home and studio at 333 Forest Avenue in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois. It was originally completed in 1895 in the Tudor Revival style at the request of client Nathan Moore. Wright obliged his client's wishes, but long after disliked the house for its adherence to historical styles. A 1922 fire gave Wright the opportunity to redesign the house. The structure was completely rebuilt above the first or lowest floor in a manner in keeping with Wright's other works of the late 1910s and early 1920s. While the new design stayed evocative of Tudor architecture, the house was heavily ornamented by details of Sullivanesque, Mayan, and other exotic origins. Wright's second scheme remains largely intact today and the house continues to be a private residence despite a brief period as a tour home. History In 1886, Nathan Grier Moore bought a small, wood-framed house on a 50 feet by 150 feet lot at the southwestern corner of Forest Avenue and Superior Street. Moore had been born in 1853 in Cherry Tree, Pennsylvania and had attended law school in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He had recently been hired into the office of Chicago attorney John P. Wilson. However, Moore chose to reside in Oak Park with his wife Anna and first daughter Mary (born in 1883) instead of Chicago. The couple's second daughter, Marjorie, was born in 1889 while they lived in their first Oak Park house.‚Ä† =First Wright design= Nathan Moore purchased the neighboring lot to the south in 1891 after the previous house on that site had been destroyed by fire. He soon announced his intention to build a new home on his expanded property. Frank Lloyd Wright accounted in his autobiography that Moore had been approached by many architects, including Norman S. Patton, before Wright himself was asked to design the project in 1894. Mr. and Mrs. Moore reportedly traveled to Wright's newly opened downtown Chicago studio in the Schindler Building to request his services rather than simply calling at the emerging architect's house across the street. Moore had apparently not come to Wright in admiration of his design style. According to Wright, he proclaimed that \\"I don't want you to give us anything like the house you did for Winslow\\" referring to the recently completed house that Wright had designed for William Winslow in River Forest, Illinois. \\"I don't want to go down backstreets to my morning train to avoid being laughed at.\\" Moore then proceeded to show Wright pictures of English half-timber buildings as inspiration for the proposed dwelling. Wright was apprehensive to design a house in a historical style, but he accepted the commission because of his financial obligations to his family (as he said, his \\"three children were now running around the streets without proper shoes\\"). First Moore House as viewed from Forest Avenue (photograph taken in 1900) The first plan proposed a remodel of the home Moore had bought in 1886. Plans changed and the existing structure was instead moved three lots west to front Superior Street. This made way for the construction of a three-story Tudor Revival house which was completed in 1895. The three story structure was built tight against the northern lot line which allowed for maximum yard space to the south. Walls on the main floor were faced in golden-tan Roman brick while the upper floors were finished in typical, dark-stained half timbering over light stucco. A steep, gabled roof and two slender, tall, brick chimneys topped off the composition. The main house was symmetrically proportioned with few exceptions ‚Äì including the chimneys and window openings flanking the Superior Street entrance. A garage connected the residence to a garden house at the northwestern corner of the property. Wright also designed a matching stable building across an alley to the southwest. The interior was paneled in dark wood yet was amply lit by bands of diamond-patterned, leaded casement windows which opened the rooms up to the south garden. Inside also featured eight fireplaces, each with unique custom surrounds. (See more period images of the first Moore House). Nathan and Anna Moore \\"were delighted with the house.\\" Unfortunately the same cannot have been said for Wright. He came to regard the design with embarrassment and admitted that his \\"heart wasn't in it.\\" His decision caused further regret after he was asked on more than one occasion to devise similar Tudor inspired houses for other clients. Like his mentor and former employer, Louis H. Sullivan,; Sullivan saw historical architecture as a result of culture, rather than a series of styles. He thus believed that modern architecture should represent the ideas of the current era rather than replicate the past. Wright considered the copying of historic styles to be \\"uncreative\\" and completely contrary to American freedom. Even so, Wright managed to work a few interpretive deviations into the design of the Moore House. These included a broad, south-facing porch complete with brick end piers, Sullivanesque details on the balustrades, and his signature bowl-shaped urns. \\"It was the first time...an English, half-timbered house ever saw a porch,\\" Wright stated and further conceded that \\"the porch was becoming to the house.\\" =Property expansion and Edward R. Hills House= Soon after the new house was finished, Moore resumed the expansion of his property. In 1900 he bought the house on a 100 ft wide lot to the south from prior owner William C. Gray. That same year, Wright was rehired to remodel this recent purchase for Moore's eldest daughter. Actual construction waited until yet another house was acquired south of the former Gray house in 1905. This last house had been owned by a Mr. and Mrs. D.L. McDaniels. With an estate that now measured 250 feet by 150 feet, Moore was able to demolish the McDaniels house and move the Gray house south where it was subsequently refurbished and enlarged. The house, along with 60 ft of Forest Avenue frontage, was deeded to Mary and her husband Edward Rowland Hills in 1910 (see also Edward R. Hills House). =Fire and second Wright design= thumb Nathan G. Moore House viewed from the corner of Superior Street and Forest Avenue. In the early morning of December 23, 1922, an electrical fire destroyed the third floor and caused significant damage to the lower floors of the Nathan G. Moore House. At the time, Wright was engaged in the construction of several projects in California, but he accepted Moore's request to design the reconstruction and appointed Charles E. White, Jr. as local coordinator. Within a year the house was again ready to be occupied. While Wright took this opportunity to completely redesign the house, he retained the essence of the Tudor style. The foundations as well as most of the first floor walls and south porch were retained. A slate roof and masonry chimneys were rebuilt in almost identical form to the originals, but Wright chose to leave out the second floor walls. The new roof sat directly on the first floor, thus making the entire structure significantly shorter. The pitched roof of the previous porch was traded for a second floor terrace with two open lightwells to the porch below. This second house was more imbued with integral ornament than the first. A simple, first floor bay window in the east elevation was exchanged for one with a Gothic motif. Each side featured paired lancet windows and a facing of intricately adorned terracotta. While half- timbering was limited to the peaks of three gables, the remaining surfaces were replaced by banding of terracotta and heavily carved, geometrically patterned wood. In these details, Wright not only drew inspiration from English Tudor, but also from Mayan architecture and the elaborate, organic style of Louis Sullivan. The result showed similarities to other Wright designs of the period, including Midway Gardens (1913), the Imperial Hotel (1915‚Äì23), the Hollyhock House (1917‚Äì1921), and the four textile block houses (1923). The stables and garden house, which both survived the fire and retained original detailing, serve as a comparison between the styles of the earlier and later designs. =1946 to present= On August 16, 1946, Nathan Moore died; his house and property were left to Mary Hills. The Hills did not keep the estate, but instead sold it the following June to Milton J. and Mary Summerville. During the transaction, the Hills retained the southern 40 feet of land to expand their own narrow lot. The home's most recent owner was Robert Dugal, who opened the house for seasonal public tours. However, these tours ceased operation in 2001 due to the progression of his Friedreich's ataxia disease. Mr Dugal died in 2020.

This term is only used by Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidim, as other Hasidim have a tish or a botteh. It may consist of explanations of general Torah subjects, with an emphasis on Hasidic philosophy, relating of Hasidic stories, and lively Hasidic melodies, with refreshments being served. It is regarded as a time of great holiness. Farbrengens are public events open to non-Hasidim as well. Occasions when farbrengens are held Farbrengens are usually held on Shabbos, Yom Tov, or an auspicious day in the Hasidic calendar such as a birthday or Yom Hillula of one of the Chabad Rebbes, or a day in which one of the Chabad Rebbes was released from prison. Because of the emphasis on inspiration, self-examination and the making of new resolutions common at farbrengens, they are also often held in preparation for events related to teshuvah, such as on Thursday (in preparation for the Shabbos, whose letters can be rearranged to spell teshuvah, ), Rosh Chodesh (which has similar qualities to Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur), or similar days. According to the instructions of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson it is also customary for Chasidim to hold a farbrengen with their friends on their birthday, and Rabbi Schneerson encouraged all Jews to do so. A farbrengen is also held on the occasion of one's engagement and wedding. Thus, farbrengens are held often. The goal of the farbrengen is to inspire one to grow in his spirituality. =Chabad holidays= Farbrengens are typically held on the following Chabad holidays: *1 Kislev *10 Kislev *19 Kislev *5 Teves *22 Shvat *11 Nissan *3 Tammuz *12-13 Tammuz Niggunim At farbrengens it is customary to sing Hasidic melodies known as niggunim (singular: niggun). Chabad tradition contains many hundreds of such tunes, both slow and soul-stirring, and fast and lively. The goal is for the niggun to inspire and open the hearts of the participants. Zemiros are not sung. Wishing l'chaim All attending wish lechaim (blessings of life) to one another. The reason for the l'chaim is to open the hearts of the participants to be inspired to want to change, and internalize what is being spoken at the farbrengen. In addition, since the farbrengen often includes discussion about very sensitive matters, with pointed criticism, alcohol is consumed in order to lessen the tension amongst the participants. However, it is only meant to be drunk sparingly, as Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson forbade drinking more than four shot glasses of alcohol (\\"l'chaims\\") for anyone under the age of 40. Formats All Farbrengens include songs (a niggun) and speech, the speaker taking breaks for song. Generally speaking, there are three possible formats for a farbrengen: * The Rebbe (most recently Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson at 770 in Brooklyn, New York) would sit at the head, speak in Yiddish, lead a wordless melody, and then answer the L'chaim, a toast (on small cups of kosher wine), as it was offered by each person in the room. He made eye contact, nodded, and then moved along the sea of faces to the next person.A Rabbi's Complicated Relationship With Judaism, The Jerusalem Post, June 6, 1994 It is not customary for Chabad Rebbes to distribute their shirayim (, leftovers) to those assembled, and thus this gathering is never referred to as a tish. * A mashpia or similar community leader leads the farbrengen in a public setting, such as at the synagogue. The role of the speaker is to educate and transmit a Chasidic educational message to the participants. * Several Hasidim gather together to discuss matters of divine service in a very intimate, serious, individualised, but informal way. There is no main speaker. Meaning of a farbrengen The Alter Rebbe related that a \\"note fell down from the Heavens,\\" containing the following: \\"What a Hasidic farbrengen can achieve, even the angel Michoel cannot achieve\\".Igros Kodesh of the Previous Rebbe, Vol. 3, page 413. However, in popular speech, most chasidim attribute the saying to Rav Hillel Paritcher. This power stems from the idea that when God, regarded as our father, sees that His children are sitting together in unity and love, He is then aroused with a desire to fulfill all their requests, even those of which they would not be worthy via normal means, such as via the advocacy of Michoel, the defending angel of the Jewish people. Indeed, Chasidic tradition includes many stories of people who were saved by taking part in a farbrengen and being thereby blessed. Farbrengen literally means \\"get together\\". It is called this name so the evil inclination will be fooled to think that this is just like any other get together and will not be on guard and try to get the person to ignore the inspiration of the gathering. There is a Chabad Chasidic saying \\"when two get together to talk of their spiritual failings, it is two Godly souls vs. one animal soul.\\"Hayom Yom, 20 Tevet. The reasoning is, the Godly souls are selfless and are more than happy to unite and help each other in the spiritual failing at hand. However, the animal soul is innately selfish and thus each animal soul will not join forces. Thus, at a farbrengen, when Chassidim get together to inspire one another, they have the help of each other's Godly souls, greatly out-numbering the animal souls.

It is in the Papahaua Ranges, around 33 kilometres by road north of Westport, via SH67 from Westport to Karamea. The history of Millerton bears some resemblance to that of Denniston, being a town that lived from and for the coal that was mined in the Ranges. Millerton has a population of approx 30-40. It was classified like Denniston as a ghost town in the 1970s but has had a resident population for several decades. It is possibly New Zealand's only populated hilltop township. Millerton, c.1910 Millerton settlement Mining and incline Despite its elevation of 300 metres being considerably lower than that of Denniston (600 metres), the steep grade between the coastline and Millerton still meant that the coal was difficult to get down from the hilltop to the coastal railway near sea level. The Westport Coal Company built the Millerton Incline in 1891Solid Energy and the Millerton Mine began production in 1896. Mining at Millerton ended in the late 1960s, as it largely did at Denniston. The Millerton Incline was a narrow gauge () incline consisting of two parallel sets of tracks on which the coal tubs ran, being hauled by rope. Remnants of tracks, trucks, bath house and other installations are still visible. The Millerton Incline was a significant engineering achievement for its time, and the remains of this incline and its infrastructure are more accessible than those of the more famous Denniston Incline. The Millerton Incline was used to convey tubs of coal from the mines around the Millerton area to the bins at Granity, which were once the largest coal loading bins of wooden construction in New Zealand. The bins no longer exist, but the incline remains and can still be seen today. Further images of Millerton, its ropeways and incline, can be accessed via the 'External links' below. The Hon. William McIntyre from Millerton was a member of the Legislative Council from 1921 until he died in 1949, and was known as the Father of the Upper House. A miner from Scotland, he (with his brother) set a record for the coal mined in one shift at the Millerton Mine. With the Denniston and the smaller Millerton mining operations having ended, the nearby Stockton coalfield is continuing the tradition of West Coast coal. Solid Energy New Zealand has planned to extend the life of the Stockton mining area by opening up the old Millerton Mine workings, albeit as an open cast pit. Community The Millerton football (soccer) club, known as the Millerton All Blacks, were twice runners-up in the Chatham Cup, New Zealand's knockout football competition, in 1932 and 1933. Millerton had its own Lodge of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes (Lookout Lodge No 127 of the R.A.O.B. NZ Constitution of the Grand Lodge of England). The Lodge was opened in 1950 and closed sometime in the mid-1980s. Tourism Tourists often venture further up the West Coast north of Westport. Originally there was a narrow, steep and winding road to the township, but the steeper section of road has been closed and diverted, going directly to Stockton via 'The Grand Canyon'. Access is now off the new upper road section and is signposted, entering the township via the original road from the north-eastern end of the town. This 'old' road continues through the town and west towards the historic Millerton Incline, the portal and dam (part of an inclined rail system that took coal down to Granity). There are some extensive views here across the rainforest to the coast and north towards the Karamea headland. The closed section of old road can be walked down as far as the Millerton 'Granity Creek' Bridge, from which there are a series of waterfalls to be viewed. There is parking at either end of this walking section. The local community offers maps and information at the local community hall (in the township). There are several short walks in and around Millerton with historic sites and scenic views. The bathhouse walks are additional trails in this area, and the Bathhouses themselves are of historic value also. A creek formed the reservoir dam where the coal miners used to come and bathe after a long day mining, and remnants of the pipework which flowed with hot water heated by the mines still remains at the site. In the township area one can see the mine sites and the incline brake head. References External links *G Parkhouse (Firm). G Parkhouse (Firm, Westport): Millerton, N.Z.

For the purposes of this list, inventions are regarded as technological firsts developed in India, and as such does not include foreign technologies which India acquired through contact. It also does not include technologies or discoveries developed elsewhere and later invented separately in India, nor inventions by Indian emigres in other places. Changes in minor concepts of design or style and artistic innovations do not appear on in the lists. Inventions =Construction, Civil engineering and Architecture= *Iron pillar of Delhi: The world's first iron pillar was the Iron pillar of Delhi‚Äîerected at the time of Chandragupta II Vikramaditya (375413).Balasubramaniam, R. (2002) The pillar has attracted attention of archaeologists and materials scientists and has been called \\"a testament to the skill of ancient Indian blacksmiths\\" because of its high resistance to corrosion. * Stepwell: Earliest clear evidence of the origins of the stepwell is found in the Indus Valley Civilisation's archaeological site at Mohenjodaro in PakistanLivingston & Beach, 20 and Dholavira in India.The Lost River by Michel Danino. Penguin India 2010 The three features of stepwells in the subcontinent are evident from one particular site, abandoned by 2500 BCE, which combines a bathing pool, steps leading down to water, and figures of some religious importance into one structure. The early centuries immediately before the common era saw the Buddhists and the Jains of India adapt the stepwells into their architecture. Both the wells and the form of ritual bathing reached other parts of the world with Buddhism. Rock-cut step wells in the subcontinent date from 200 to 400 CE. Subsequently, the wells at Dhank (550625 CE) and stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850950 CE) were constructed.Livingston & Beach, page xxiii * Stupa: The origin of the stupa can be traced to 3rd-century BCE India.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). Pagoda. It was used as a commemorative monument associated with storing sacred relics. The stupa architecture was adopted in Southeast and East Asia, where it evolved into the pagoda, a Buddhist monument used for enshrining sacred relics. Hanuman and Ravana in Tolu Bommalata, the shadow puppet tradition of Andhra Pradesh, India * Squat toilet: toilets platforms above drains, in the proximity of wells, are found in several houses of the cities of Mohenjodaro and Harappa from the 3rd millennium BCE.Rodda, J. C. and Ubertini, Lucio (2004). The Basis of Civilization - Water Science? pg 161. International Association of Hydrological Sciences (International Association of Hydrological Sciences Press 2004). India's urban civilisation is traceable to Mohenjodaro and Harappa, now in Pakistan, where planned urban communities existed 5,000 years ago. From then on, the ancient Indian architecture and civil engineering continued to develop and grow. It found manifestation in the construction of temples, palaces and forts on the Indian peninsula and the neighbouring regions. In ancient India, architecture and construction as Sthapatya Kala known literal translation of which the art of constructing (some) means. Achieved during the period of Kushan Empire and Maurya empires, the Indian architecture and construction in regions such as Baluchistan and Afghanistan. Statues of Buddha were cut and covers entire mountain walls and cliffs, like Buddhas of Bamiyan, Afghanistan. mixed over a period of time, the construction of ancient Indian art and Greek styles and spread to Central Asia. On the other hand took the Buddhism Indian style of architecture and construction in countries such as Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, China, Korea and Japan. Angkor Wat is a living testimony to the contribution of Indian civil engineering and architecture of the Cambodian Khmer heritage in the field of architecture and construction. In mainland India of today there are several wonders of the ancient India's architectural heritage, including World Heritage sites like Ajanta, Ellora, Khajuraho, Mahabodhi Temple, Sanchi, Brihadisvara Temple and Mahabalipuram = Metrology = * Ruler: Rulers made from Ivory were in use by the Indus Valley Civilisation in what today is Northwestern India and Pakistan prior to 1500 BCE. Excavations at Lothal (2400 BCE) have yielded one such ruler calibrated to about 1/16 of an inch‚Äîless than 2 millimetres.Whitelaw, page 14 Ian Whitelaw (2007) holds that 'The Mohenjodaro ruler is divided into units corresponding to 1.32 inches (33.5 mm) and these are marked out in decimal subdivisions with amazing accuracy‚Äîto within 0.005 of an inch. They correspond closely with the \\"hasta\\" increments of 1 3/8 inches traditionally used in South India in ancient architecture. Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units.'Whitelaw, page 15 Shigeo Iwata (2008) further writes 'The minimum division of graduation found in the segment of an ivory-made linear measure excavated in Lothal was 1.79 mm (that corresponds to 1/940 of a fathom), while that of the fragment of a shell-made one from Mohenjodaro was 6.72 mm (1/250 of a fathom), and that of bronze-made one from Harappa was 9.33 mm (1/180 of a fathom).' The weights and measures of the Indus civilisation also reached Persia and Central Asia, where they were further modified.Iwata, 2254 * Weighing scale: The earliest evidence for the existence of weighing scale dates to 2400 BCE‚Äì1800 BCE in the Indus valley civilisation prior to which no banking was performed due to lack of scales. *Crescograph: The crescograph, a device for measuring growth in plants, was invented in the early 20th century by the Bengali scientist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose.Geddes, pages 173176 * Incense clock: The incense clock is a timekeeping device used to measure minutes, hours, or days, incense clocks were commonly used at homes and temples in dynastic times. Although popularly associated with China the incense clock is believed to have originated in India, at least in its fundamental form if not function.Schafer (1963), pages 160161Bedini (1994), pages 6980 Early incense clocks found in China between the 6th and 8th centuries CE‚Äîthe period it appeared in China all seem to have DevanƒÅgarƒ´ carvings on them instead of Chinese seal characters. Incense itself was introduced to China from India in the early centuries CE, along with the spread of Buddhism by travelling monks.Bedini (1994), page 25Seiwert (2003), page 96Kumar, Yukteshwar (2005), page 65 Edward Schafer asserts that incense clocks were probably an Indian invention, transmitted to China, which explains the DevanƒÅgarƒ´ inscriptions on early incense clocks found in China. Silvio Bedini on the other hand asserts that incense clocks were derived in part from incense seals mentioned in Tantric Buddhist scriptures, which first came to light in China after those scriptures from India were translated into Chinese, but holds that the time-telling function of the seal was incorporated by the Chinese. =Metallurgy and manufacturing= * Crucible steel: Perhaps as early as 300 BCE‚Äîalthough certainly by 200 BCE‚Äîhigh quality steel was being produced in southern India, by what Europeans would later call the crucible technique. In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in a crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon. Close-up of Wootz steel, pioneering steel alloy matrix developed in India. *Wootz steel: Wootz steel is an ultra-high carbon steel and the first form of crucible steel manufactured by the applications and use of nanomaterials in its microstructure and is characterised by its ultra-high carbon content exhibiting properties such as superplasticity, high impact hardness and held sway for over a millennium in three continentsa feat unlikely to be surpassed by advanced materials of the current era. Archaeological and Tamil language literary evidence suggests that this manufacturing process was already in existence in South India well before the common era, with wootz steel exported from the Chera dynasty and called Seric Iron in Rome, and later known as Damascus steel in Europe.Srinivasan 1994Srinivasan & Griffiths Reproduction research is currently being undertaken by various scientists like Dr. Oleg Sherby and Dr. Jeff Wadsworth and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have all done research, attempting to create steels with characteristics similar to Wootz, but without success J.D Verhoeven and Al Pendray attained some success in the reconstruction methods of production, proved the role of impurities of ore in the pattern creation, and reproduced Wootz steel with patterns microscopically and visually identical to one of the ancient blade patterns. * Seamless celestial globe: Considered one of the most remarkable feats in metallurgy, it was invented in India in between 1589 and 1590 CE.Kamarustafa (1992), page 48 Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern metallurgists to be technically impossible to produce metal globes without any seams, even with modern technology. * Tube drawn technology: Indians used tube drawn technology for glass bead manufacturing which was first developed in the 2nd century BCE. * Tumble polishing: Indians innvoted polishing method in the 10th century BCE for mass production of polished stone beads. * Diamond drills: in the 12th century BCE or 7th century BCE, Indians not only innovated use of diamond tipped drills but also invented double diamond tipped drills for bead manufacturing. * Diamond cutting and polishing: The technology of cutting and polishing diamonds was invented in India, Ratnapariksha, a text dated to 6th century talks about diamond cutting and Al-Beruni speaks about the method of using lead plate for diamond polishing in the 11th century CE. =Computers and programming languages= *J Sharp: Visual J# (pronounced \\"jay-sharp\\") programming language was a transitional language for programmers of Java and Visual J++ languages, so they could use their existing knowledge and applications on .NET Framework. It was developed by the Hyderabad-based Microsoft India Development Center at HITEC City in India.S Prasanna, Microsoft's VJ#.Net is made in India , Express Computer, 29 July 2002 ‚Äì invalid link ! *Kojo: Kojo is a programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) for computer programming and learning.

B. Lal, India 19471997: New Light on the Indus Civilization * India ink: Known in Asia since the third millennia BCE, and used in India since at least the 4th century BCE. Masi, an early ink in India was an admixture of several chemical components.,Banerji, page 673 with the carbon black from which India ink is produced obtained by burning bones, tar, pitch, and other substances.Gottsegen, page 30.Smith, J.

Bose's revolutionary demonstration forms the foundation of the technology used in mobile telephony, radars, satellite communication, radios, television broadcast, WiFi, remote controls and countless other applications. *Fibre optics: Named as one of the 7 'Unsung Heroes' by Fortune Magazine, Dr. Narinder Singh Kapany, is widely recognised as the 'Father of Fibre Optics' for his pioneering work in fibre optics technology. *Shearing Interferometer: Invented by M.V.R.K. *Murty, a type of Lateral Shearing Interferometer utilises a laser source for measuring refractive index. *Mysorean rockets: One of the first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rockets were deployed by Tipu Sultan's army, ruler of the South Indian Kingdom of Mysore, and that of his father Hyder Ali, in the 1780s. He successfully used these iron-cased rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo- Mysore Wars. The Mysore Rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo- Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, and were soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.Roddam Narasimha (1985), Rockets in Mysore and Britain, 17501850 A.D. , National Aeronautical Laboratory and Indian Institute of Science\\"Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three- quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Hyder Ali's son, Tippu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.\\" - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). rocket and missile. The Great Stupa at Sanchi (4th-1st century BCE). The dome shaped stupa was used in India as a commemorative monument associated with storing sacred relics. * Shampoo: The word shampoo in English is derived from Hindustani chƒÅmpo (‡§ö‡§æ‡§Å‡§™‡•ã ),chƒÅmpo (‡§ö‡§æ‡§Å‡§™‡•ã ) is the imperative of chƒÅmpnƒÅ (‡§ö‡§æ‡§Å‡§™‡§®‡§æ ), \\"to smear, knead the muscles, massage the head and hair\\" and dates to 1762. A variety of herbs and their extracts were used as shampoos since ancient times in India. A very effective early shampoo was made by boiling Sapindus with dried Indian gooseberry (aamla) and a few other herbs, using the strained extract. Sapindus, also known as soapberries or soapnuts, is called Ksuna (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Å‡§£)kSuNa, Sanskrit Lexicon, Monier-Williams Dictionary (1872) in ancient Indian texts and its fruit pulp contain saponins, a natural surfactant. The extract of Ksuna, creates a lather which Indian texts identify as phenaka (Sanskrit: ‡§´‡•á‡§®‡§ï),phenaka, Spoken Sanskrit, University of Koeln, Germany leaves the hair soft, shiny and manageable. Other products used for hair cleansing were shikakai (Acacia concinna), soapnuts (Sapindus), hibiscus flowers,Rahman, , Oxford University Press, , page 145Tamil Nadu Medicinal plants board ritha (Sapindus mukorossi) and arappu (Albizzia amara).Tamil Nadu Agricultural university ‚Äì Albizzia amara Guru Nanak, the founding prophet and the first Guru of Sikhism, made references to soapberry tree and soap in 16th century.Khushwant Singh, Hymns of Guru Nanak, Orient Longman, Washing of hair and body massage (champu) during a daily strip wash was an indulgence of early colonial traders in India. When they returned to Europe, they introduced their newly learnt habits, including the hair treatment they called shampoo.Virginia Smith (2007), Clean: A History of Personal Hygiene and Purity, Oxford University Press, * Toe stirrup: The earliest known manifestation of the stirrup, which was a toe loop that held the big toe was used in India in as early as 500 BCEChamberlin (2007), page 80 or perhaps by 200 BCE according to other sources.Hobson (2004), page 103Woods & Woods (2000), pages 5253 This ancient stirrup consisted of a looped rope for the big toe which was at the bottom of a saddle made of fibre or leather. Such a configuration made it suitable for the warm climate of most of India where people used to ride horses barefoot. A pair of megalithic double bent iron bars with curvature at each end, excavated in Junapani in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh have been regarded as stirrups although they could as well be something else.\\"16.17.4: Stirrups\\". Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology (Vol. 1). Edited by Amalananda Ghosh (1990). page 336 Buddhist carvings in the temples of Sanchi, Mathura and the Bhaja caves dating back between the 1st and 2nd century BCE figure horsemen riding with elaborate saddles with feet slipped under girths.Azzaroli (1985), page 156Addington (1990), page 45Barua (2005), pages 1617 Sir John Marshall described the Sanchi relief as \\"the earliest example by some five centuries of the use of stirrups in any part of the world\\". In the 1st century CE horse riders in northern India, where winters are sometimes long and cold, were recorded to have their booted feet attached to hooked stirrups. However the form, the conception of the primitive Indian stirrup spread west and east, gradually evolving into the stirrup of today. =Genetics= *Pseudomonas putida: Indian (Bengali) inventor and microbiologist Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty created a species of man made micro organism to break down crude oil. He genetically engineered a new species of Pseudomonas bacteria (\\"the oil-eating bacteria\\") in 1971. United States Supreme Court granted Chakrabarty's invention patent even though it was a living species. The court ruling decreed that Chakrabarty's discovery was \\"not nature's handiwork, but his own...\\" The inventor Chakrabarty secured his patent in 1980(see Diamond v. Chakrabarty) =Games= * Chaturanga: The precursor of chess originated in India during the Gupta dynasty (c. 280550 CE).Murray (1913)Forbes (1860)Jones, William (1807). \\"On the Indian Game of Chess\\". pages 323333Linde, Antonius (1981) Both the Persians and Arabs ascribe the origins of the game of Chess to the Indians.Wilkinson, Charles K (May 1943)Bird (1893), page 63 The words for \\"chess\\" in Old Persian and Arabic are chatrang and shatranj respectively ‚Äî terms derived from catura·πÖga in Sanskrit,Hooper & Whyld (1992), page 74Sapra, Rahul (2000). \\"Sports in India\\".

Chess: Ancient precursors and related games. This game was introduced to the Near East from India and became a part of the princely or courtly education of Persian nobility. Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders and others carried it to the Far East where it was transformed and assimilated into a game often played on the intersection of the lines of the board rather than within the squares. Chaturanga reached Europe through Persia, the Byzantine empire and the expanding Arabian empire.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2007). Chess: Introduction to Europe. Muslims carried Shatranj to North Africa, Sicily, and Spain by the 10th century where it took its final modern form of chess. * Kabaddi: The game of kabaddi originated in India during prehistory.Alter, page 88 Suggestions on how it evolved into the modern form range from wrestling exercises, military drills, and collective self-defence but most authorities agree that the game existed in some form or the other in India during the period between 1500 and 400 BCE. * Ludo: Pachisi originated in India by the 6th century.MSN Encarta (2008). Pachisi. The earliest evidence of this game in India is the depiction of boards on the caves of Ajanta. A variant of this game, called Ludo, made its way to England during the British Raj. * Snakes and ladders: Vaikunta pali Snakes and ladders originated in India as a game based on morality.Augustyn, pages 2728 During British rule of India, this game made its way to England, and was eventually introduced in the United States of America by game-pioneer Milton Bradley in 1943. * Suits game: Kridapatram is an early suits game, made of painted rags, invented in Ancient India. The term kridapatram literally means \\"painted rags for playing.\\" Paper playing cards first appeared in East Asia during the 9th century. The medieval Indian game of ganjifa, or playing cards, is first recorded in the 16th century. =Cloth and Material production= * Button: Ornamental buttons‚Äîmade from seashell‚Äîwere used in the Indus Valley Civilisation for ornamental purposes by 2000 BCE.Hesse, Rayner W. & Hesse (Jr.), Rayner W. (2007). Jewelrymaking Through History: An Encyclopedia. Greenwood Publishing Group. 35. . Some buttons were carved into geometric shapes and had holes pierced into them so that they could be attached to clothing by using a thread. Ian McNeil (1990) holds that: \\"The button, in fact, was originally used more as an ornament than as a fastening, the earliest known being found at Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley. It is made of a curved shell and about 5000 years old.\\"McNeil, Ian (1990). An encyclopaedia of the history of technology. Taylor & Francis. 852. . Nepali Charkha in action * Calico: Calico had originated in the subcontinent by the 11th century and found mention in Indian literature, by the 12th-century writer Hemachandra. He has mentioned calico fabric prints done in a lotus design.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). calico The Indian textile merchants traded in calico with the Africans by the 15th century and calico fabrics from Gujarat appeared in Egypt. Trade with Europe followed from the 17th century onward. Within India, calico originated in Kozhikode. * Carding devices: Historian of science Joseph Needham ascribes the invention of bow-instruments used in textile technology to India. The earliest evidence for using bow-instruments for carding comes from India (2nd century CE). These carding devices, called kaman and dhunaki would loosen the texture of the fibre by the means of a vibrating string. * Charkha (Spinning wheel): invented in India, between 500 and 1000 CE. * Chintz: The origin of Chintz is from the printed all cotton fabric of calico in India.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). chintz The origin of the word chintz itself is from the Hindi language word ‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç (chitr), which means an image.HƒÅ·πá·∏çƒÅ (1998), page 133 * Muslin: The fabric was named after the city where Europeans first encountered it, Mosul, in what is now Iraq, but the fabric actually originated from Dhaka in what is now Bangladesh. In the 9th century, an Arab merchant named Sulaiman makes note of the material's origin in Bengal (known as Ruhml in Arabic). Single roller cotton gin, in use * Palampore: ‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡§Æ‡§™‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç (Hindi language) of Indian originEncyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). interior design was imported to the western world‚Äînotable England and Colonial America‚Äîfrom India.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). crewel workEncyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). quilting In 17th-century England these hand painted cotton fabrics influenced native crewel work design. Shipping vessels from India also took palampore to colonial America, where it was used in quilting. * Prayer flags: The Buddhist s≈´tras, written on cloth in India, were transmitted to other regions of the world.Barker, page 13 These sutras, written on banners, were the origin of prayer flags. Legend ascribes the origin of the prayer flag to the Shakyamuni Buddha, whose prayers were written on battle flags used by the devas against their adversaries, the asuras.Beer, page 60 The legend may have given the Indian bhikku a reason for carrying the 'heavenly' banner as a way of signyfying his commitment to ahimsa.Wise, page 1112 This knowledge was carried into Tibet by 800 CE, and the actual flags were introduced no later than 1040 CE, where they were further modified. The Indian monk Atisha (9801054 CE) introduced the Indian practice of printing on cloth prayer flags to Tibet. * Single roller cotton gin: The Ajanta Caves of India yield evidence of a single roller cotton gin in use by the 5th century.Angela Lakwete: Inventing the Cotton Gin: Machine and Myth in Antebellum America, The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003, , p. 5 This cotton gin was used in India until innovations were made in form of foot powered gins.Baber (1996), page 56 The cotton gin was invented in India as a mechanical device known as charkhi, more technically the \\"wooden-worm-worked roller\\". This mechanical device was, in some parts of India, driven by water power.Baber (1996), page 57 =Wellbeing= * Indian clubs: The Indian club‚Äîwhich appeared in Europe during the 18th century‚Äîwas used long by India's native soldiery before its introduction to Europe.Todd, Jan (1995). From Milo to Milo: A History of Barbells, Dumbells, and Indian Clubs. Accessed in September 2008. Hosted on the LA84 Foundation Sports Library. During the British Raj the British officers in India performed calisthenic exercises with clubs to keep in physical condition. From Britain the use of club swinging spread to the rest of the world. * Yoga: Yoga as a physical, mental, and spiritual practice originated in ancient India. * Meditation: The oldest documented evidence of the practice of meditation are wall arts in the Indian subcontinent from approximately 5,000 to 3,500 BCE, showing people seated in meditative postures with half-closed eyes. Discoveries * Cashmere: The fibre cashmere fibre also known as pashm or pashmina for its use in the handmade shawls of Kashmir, India.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). cashmere. The woolen shawls made from wool in Kashmir region of India find written mention between the 3rd century BCE and the 11th century CE.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). kashmir shawl. However, the founder of the cashmere wool industry is traditionally held to be the 15th-century ruler of Kashmir, Zayn-ul-Abidin, who employed weavers from Central Asia. * Cotton cultivation: Cotton was cultivated by the inhabitants of the Indus Valley Civilisation by the 5th millennium BCE4th millennium BCE.Stein (1998), page 47 The Indus cotton industry was well developed and some methods used in cotton spinning and fabrication continued to be practised till the modern industrialisation of India.Wisseman & Williams (1994), page 127 Well before the Common Era, the use of cotton textiles had spread from India to the Mediterranean and beyond.The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. cotton. * Indigo dye: Indigo, a blue pigment and a dye, was used in India, which was also the earliest major centre for its production and processing.Kriger & Connah (2006), page 120 The Indigofera tinctoria variety of Indigo was domesticated in India. Indigo, used as a dye, made its way to the Greeks and the Romans via various trade routes, and was valued as a luxury product. * Jute cultivation: Jute has been cultivated in India since ancient times. Raw jute was exported to the western world, where it was used to make ropes and cordage.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). jute. The Indian jute industry, in turn, was modernised during the British Raj in India. The region of Bengal was the major centre for Jute cultivation, and remained so before the modernisation of India's jute industry in 1855, when Kolkata became a centre for jute processing in India. * Sugar refinement: Sugarcane was originally from tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia, with different species originating in India, and S. edule and S. officinarum from New Guinea. The process of producing crystallised sugar from sugarcane was discovered by the time of the Imperial Guptas,Adas (2001), page 311 and the earliest reference of candied sugar comes from India.Kieschnick (2003) The process was soon transmitted to China with travelling Buddhist monks. Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in 647 CE, for obtaining technology for sugar-refining.Kieschnick (2003), page 258 Each mission returned with results on refining sugar. =Mathematics= { class=\\"wikitable Unicode\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:100%;\\" align=right - ! rowspan=2  Number System ! colspan=10  Numbers - ! 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Tamil  ‡≥¶  ‡Øß  ‡Ø®  ‡Ø©  ‡Ø™  ‡Ø´  ‡Ø¨  ‡Ø≠  ‡ØÆ  ‡ØØ - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Gurmukhi  o  ‡©ß  ‡©®  ‡©©  ‡©™  ‡©´  ‡©¨  ‡©≠  ‡©Æ  ‡©Ø - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Oriya (Odia)  ‡≠¶  ‡≠ß  ‡≠®  ‡≠©  ‡≠™  ‡≠´  ‡≠¨  ‡≠≠  ‡≠Æ  ‡≠Ø - ! style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\"  Bengali  ‡ß¶  ‡ßß  ‡ß®  ‡ß©  ‡ß™  ‡ß´  ‡ß¨  ‡ß≠  ‡ßÆ  ‡ßØ - ! style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\"  Assamese  ‡ß¶  ‡ßß  ‡ß®  ‡ß©  ‡ß™  ‡ß´  ‡ß¨  ‡ß≠  ‡ßÆ  ‡ßØ - !style=\\"font- size: 75%;\\" Devanagari  ‡•¶  ‡•ß  ‡•®  ‡•©  ‡•™  ‡•´  ‡•¨  ‡•≠  ‡•Æ  ‡•Ø - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Gujarati  ‡´¶  ‡´ß  ‡´®  ‡´©  ‡´™  ‡´´  ‡´¨  ‡´≠  ‡´Æ  ‡´Ø - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Tibetan  ‡º†  ‡º°  ‡º¢  ‡º£  ‡º§  ‡º•  ‡º¶  ‡ºß  ‡º®  ‡º© - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Brahmi - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Telugu  ‡±¶  ‡±ß  ‡±®  ‡±©  ‡±™  ‡±´  ‡±¨  ‡±≠  ‡±Æ  ‡±Ø - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Kannada  ‡≥¶  ‡≥ß  ‡≥®  ‡≥©  ‡≥™  ‡≥´  ‡≥¨  ‡≥≠  ‡≥Æ  ‡≥Ø - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Malayalam  ‡µ¶  ‡µß  ‡µ®  ‡µ©  ‡µ™  ‡µ´  ‡µ¨  ‡µ≠  ‡µÆ  ‡µØ - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Burmese  ·ÅÄ  ·ÅÅ  ·ÅÇ  ·ÅÉ  ·ÅÑ  ·ÅÖ  ·ÅÜ  ·Åá  ·Åà  ·Åâ - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Khmer  ·ü†  ·ü°  ·ü¢  ·ü£  ·ü§  ·ü•  ·ü¶  ·üß  ·ü®  ·ü© - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Thai  ‡πê  ‡πë  ‡πí  ‡πì  ‡πî  ‡πï  ‡πñ  ‡πó  ‡πò  ‡πô - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Lao  ‡ªê  ‡ªë  ‡ªí  ‡ªì  ‡ªî  ‡ªï  ‡ªñ  ‡ªó  ‡ªò  ‡ªô - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Balinese  ·≠ê  ·≠ë  ·≠í  ·≠ì  ·≠î  ·≠ï  ·≠ñ  ·≠ó  ·≠ò  ·≠ô - !style=\\"font- size: 75%;\\" Santali  ·±ê  ·±ë  ·±í  ·±ì  ·±î  ·±ï  ·±ñ  ·±ó  ·±ò  ·±ô - !style=\\"font-size: 75%;\\" Javanese  Íßê  Íßë  Íßí  Íßì  Íßî  Íßï  Íßñ  Íßó  Íßò  Íßô } The half-chord version of the sine function was developed by the Indian mathematician Aryabhatta. Brahmagupta's theorem (598668) states that AF = FD. * Zero, symbol: Indians were the first to use the zero as a symbol and in arithmetic operations, although Babylonians used zero to signify the 'absent'. In those earlier times a blank space was used to denote zero, later as the blank created confusion in more complex documents a dot was used to denote zero, first used in a Bakhshali manuscript. The usage of the zero in the Bakhshali manuscript was dated from between 3rd and 4th centuries, making it the earliest known usage of the symbol. * Quadratic equations: Indian mathematician derived the quadratic formula used for solving quadratic equations. * AKS primality test: The AKS primality test is a deterministic primality-proving algorithm created and published by three Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur computer scientists, Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena on 6 August 2002 in a paper titled PRIMES is in P.Crandall & Pomerance (2005), pages 200201 Commenting on the impact of this discovery, Paul Leyland noted: \\"One reason for the excitement within the mathematical community is not only does this algorithm settle a long-standing problem, it also does so in a brilliantly simple manner. Everyone is now wondering what else has been similarly overlooked\\".Crandall & Papadopoulos (2003), page 2 * Finite Difference Interpolation: The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta presented what is possibly the first instance (p.111) of finite difference interpolation around 665 CE. * Algebraic abbreviations: The mathematician Brahmagupta had begun using abbreviations for unknowns by the 7th century. He employed abbreviations for multiple unknowns occurring in one complex problem. Brahmagupta also used abbreviations for square roots and cube roots. *Seshadri constant: In algebraic geometry, a Seshadri constant is an invariant of an ample line bundle L at a point P on an algebraic variety.The name is in honour of the Indian mathematician C. S. Seshadri. * Basu's theorem: The Basu's theorem, a result of Debabrata Basu (1955) states that any complete sufficient statistic is independent of any ancillary statistic.Nitis (2000), page 325Boos & Oliver (1998) *Rolle's theorem: BhƒÅskara II is credited with knowledge of Rolle's theorem although it is named after Michel Rolle who described with insufficient proof and was later proved by cauchy.R.C. Gupta, Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Westen Cultures, p. 156. * Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo√®ve theorem: Also known as the Karhunen‚ÄìLo√®ve theorem. The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo√®ve theorem is a representation of a stochastic process as an infinite linear combination of orthogonal functions, analogous to a Fourier series representation of a function on a bounded interval. Stochastic processes given by infinite series of this form were first considered by Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi.. * Brahmagupta‚ÄìFibonacci identity, Brahmagupta formula, Brahmagupta matrix, and Brahmagupta theorem: Discovered by the Indian mathematician, Brahmagupta (598668 CE).Plofker (2007), pp. 419436Joseph (2000), page 306 * Chakravala method: The Chakravala method, a cyclic algorithm to solve indeterminate quadratic equations is commonly attributed to BhƒÅskara II, (c. 1114 ‚Äì 1185 CE)\\"Bhaskaracharya II\\". Students' Encyclopedia India (2000). (Volume 1: Adb Allah ibn al Abbas ‚Äì Cypress). p. 200. Kumar (2004), page 23Singh, Manpal (2005), page 385 although some attribute it to Jayadeva (c. 950~1000 CE).Plofker (2007), page 474 Jayadeva pointed out that Brahmagupta's approach to solving equations of this type would yield infinitely large number of solutions, to which he then described a general method of solving such equations.Goonatilake (1998), page 127 ‚Äì 128 Jayadeva's method was later refined by BhƒÅskara II in his Bijaganita treatise to be known as the Chakravala method, chakra (derived from cakra·πÉ ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ç) meaning 'wheel' in Sanskrit, relevant to the cyclic nature of the algorithm.Baber (1996), page 34 With reference to the Chakravala method, E. O. Selenuis held that no European performances at the time of BhƒÅskara, nor much later, came up to its marvellous height of mathematical complexity.Rao K. A. (2000), page 252 *Magical Indian Math discovery: Numbers 495 and 6174. The Indian mathematician Dattaraya Ramchandra Kaprekar discovered the number 6174 is reached after repeatedly subtracting the smallest number from the largest number that can be formed from any four digits not all the same. The number 495 is similarly reached for three digits number. * Hindu number system: With decimal place-value and a symbol for zero, this system was the ancestor of the widely used Arabic numeral system. It was developed in the Indian subcontinent between the 1st and 6th centuries CE. *Decimal mark: The practice of using a decimal mark is derived from the decimal system used in Indian mathematics.Reimer, L., and Reimer, W. Mathematicians Are People, Too: Stories from the Lives of Great Mathematicians, Vol. 2. 1995. pp. 2222. Parsippany, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc. as Dale Seymor Publications. . * Fibonacci numbers: This sequence was first described by Virahanka (c. 700 CE), GopƒÅla (c. 1135), and Hemachandra (c. 1150), as an outgrowth of the earlier writings on Sanskrit prosody by Pingala (c. 200 BCE). * Law of signs in multiplication: The earliest use of notation for negative numbers, as subtrahend, is credited by scholars to the Chinese, dating back to the 2nd century BCE.Smith (1958), pp. 257258 Like the Chinese, the Indians used negative numbers as subtrahend, but were the first to establish the \\"law of signs\\" with regards to the multiplication of positive and negative numbers, which did not appear in Chinese texts until 1299. Indian mathematicians were aware of negative numbers by the 7th century, and their role in mathematical problems of debt was understood.Bourbaki (1998), page 49 Mostly consistent and correct rules for working with negative numbers were formulated,Britannica Concise Encyclopedia (2007). algebra and the diffusion of these rules led the Arab intermediaries to pass it on to Europe., for example (+)√ó(-)=(-),(-)√ó(-)=(+) etc. * Madhava series: The infinite series for œÄ and for the trigonometric sine, cosine, and arctangent is now attributed to Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1340 ‚Äì 1425) and his Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics.Goonatilake (1998), page 37Amma (1999), pp. 182183 He made use of the series expansion of \\\\arctan x to obtain an infinite series expression for œÄ. Their rational approximation of the error for the finite sum of their series are of particular interest. They manipulated the error term to derive a faster converging series for œÄ.Roy (1990) They used the improved series to derive a rational expression,104348/33215 for œÄ correct up to eleven decimal places, i.e. 3.1415926539214.Borwein (2004), page 107Plofker (2007), page 481 Madhava of Sangamagrama and his successors at the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics used geometric methods to derive large sum approximations for sine, cosine, and arctangent. They found a number of special cases of series later derived by Brook Taylor series. They also found the second-order Taylor approximations for these functions, and the third-order Taylor approximation for sine.Bressoud (2002)Plofker (2001)Katz (1995) * Pascal's triangle: Described in the 6th century CE by Varahamihira and in the 10th century by Halayudha, commenting on an obscure reference by Pingala (the author of an earlier work on prosody) to the \\"Meru-prastaara\\", or the \\"Staircase of Mount Meru\\", in relation to binomial coefficients. (It was also independently discovered in the 10th or 11th century in Persia and China.) * Pell's equation, integral solution for: About a thousand years before Pell's time, Indian scholar Brahmagupta (598668 CE) was able to find integral solutions to vargaprak·πõiti (Pell's equation):Puttaswamy (2000), page 416Stillwell (2004), pages 7273 \\\\ x^2-Ny^2=1, where N is a non-square integer, in his Br√¢hma- sphu·π≠a-siddh√¢nta treatise. * Ramanujan theta function, Ramanujan prime, Ramanujan summation, Ramanujan graph and Ramanujan's sum: Discovered by the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan in the early 20th century.Berndt & Rankin (2001) * Shrikhande graph: Graph invented by the Indian mathematician S.S. Shrikhande in 1959. * Sign convention: Symbols, signs and mathematical notation were employed in an early form in India by the 6th century when the mathematician-astronomer Aryabhata recommended the use of letters to represent unknown quantities.Bell (1992), page 96 By the 7th century Brahmagupta had already begun using abbreviations for unknowns, even for multiple unknowns occurring in one complex problem. Brahmagupta also managed to use abbreviations for square roots and cube roots. By the 7th century fractions were written in a manner similar to the modern times, except for the bar separating the numerator and the denominator. A dot symbol for negative numbers was also employed. The Bakhshali Manuscript displays a cross, much like the modern '+' sign, except that it symbolised subtraction when written just after the number affected. The '=' sign for equality did not exist. Indian mathematics was transmitted to the Islamic world where this notation was seldom accepted initially and the scribes continued to write mathematics in full and without symbols.Bell (1992), page 97 *Modern elementary arithmetic: Modum indorum or the method of the Indians for arithmetic operations was popularised by Al-Khwarizmi and Al-Kindi by means of their respective works such as in Al-Khwarizmi's On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals (ca. 825), On the Use of the Indian Numerals (ca. 830) as early as the 8th and 9th centuries.They, amongst other works, contributed to the diffusion of the Indian system of arithmetic in the Middle-East and the West.The significance of the development of the positional number system is described by the French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace (17491827) who wrote: > \\"It is India that gave us the ingenuous method of expressing all numbers by > the means of ten symbols, each symbol receiving a value of position, as well > as an absolute value; a profound and important idea which appears so simple > to us now that we ignore its true merit, but its very simplicity, the great > ease which it has lent to all computations, puts our arithmetic in the first > rank of useful inventions, and we shall appreciate the grandeur of this > achievement when we remember that it escaped the genius of Archimedes and > Apollonius, two of the greatest minds produced by antiquity.\\" * Trigonometric functions : The trigonometric functions sine and versine originated in Indian astronomy, adapted from the full-chord Greek versions (to the modern half-chord versions). They were described in detail by Aryabhata in the late 5th century, but were likely developed earlier in the Siddhantas, astronomical treatises of the 3rd or 4th century.Pingree (2003): J. J. O'Connor and E.F. Robertson (1996). Trigonometric functions . MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive Later, the 6th-century astronomer Varahamihira discovered a few basic trigonometric formulas and identities, such as sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1. *Formal systems: Panini is credited with the creation of the first Formal System in the world. =Medicine= Cataract in the Human Eye‚Äîmagnified view seen on examination with a slit lamp. Indian surgeon Susruta performed cataract surgery by the 6th century BCE. * Ayurvedic and Siddha medicine: Ayurveda and Siddha are ancient systems of medicine practised in South Asia. Ayurvedic ideas can be found in the Hindu text (mid-first millennium BCE). Ayurveda has evolved over thousands of years, and is still practised today. In an internationalised form, it can be thought of as a complementary and alternative medicine. In village settings, away from urban centres, it is simply \\"medicine.\\" The Sanskrit word ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§É (ƒÅyur-veda·∏•) means \\"knowledge (veda) for longevity (ƒÅyur)\\". Siddha medicine is mostly prevalent in South India, and is transmitted in Tamil, not Sanskrit, texts. Herbs and minerals are basic raw materials of the Siddha therapeutic system whose origins may be dated to the early centuries CE. * Cataract surgery: Cataract surgery was known to the Indian physician Sushruta (6th century BCE). In India, cataract surgery was performed with a special tool called the Jabamukhi Salaka, a curved needle used to loosen the lens and push the cataract out of the field of vision. The eye would later be soaked with warm butter and then bandaged. Though this method was successful, Susruta cautioned that cataract surgery should only be performed when absolutely necessary. Greek philosophers and scientists traveled to India where these surgeries were performed by physicians.Finger (2001), page 66 The removal of cataract by surgery was also introduced into China from India.Lade & Svoboda (2000), page 85 *Ancient Dentistry: The Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 BCE. An IVC site in Mehrgarh indicates that this form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead crafters. * Cure for Leprosy: Kearns & Nash (2008) state that the first mention of leprosy is described in the Indian medical treatise Sushruta Samhita (6th century BCE).Kearns & Nash (2008) However, The Oxford Illustrated Companion to Medicine holds that the mention of leprosy, as well as ritualistic cures for it, were described in the Atharva-veda (15001200 BCE), written before the Sushruta Samhita.Lock; Last & Dunea (2001), page 420 * Plastic surgery: Treatments for the plastic repair of a broken nose are first mentioned in the Edwin Smith Papyrus, a transcription of an Ancient Egyptian medical text, some of the oldest known surgical treatise, dated to the Old Kingdom from 3000 to 2500 BCE. Plastic surgery was being carried out in India by 2000 BCE.MSN Encarta (2008). Plastic Surgery . The system of punishment by deforming a miscreant's body may have led to an increase in demand for this practice. The surgeon Sushruta contributed mainly to the field of plastic and cataract surgery. The medical works of both Sushruta and Charaka were translated into Arabic language during the Abbasid Caliphate (750 CE). These translated Arabic works made their way into Europe via intermediaries. In Italy the Branca family of Sicily and Gaspare Tagliacozzi of Bologna became familiar with the techniques of Sushruta.Lock etc., page 607 * Lithiasis treatment: The earliest operation for treating lithiasis, or the formations of stones in the body, is also given in the Sushruta Samhita (6th century BCE). The operation involved exposure and going up through the floor of the bladder.Lock; Last & Dunea (2001), page 836 * Visceral leishmaniasis, treatment of: The Indian (Bengali) medical practitioner Upendranath Brahmachari (19 December 1873 ‚Äì 6 February 1946) was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for his discovery of 'ureastibamine (antimonial compound for treatment of kala azar) and a new disease, post-kalaazar dermal leishmanoid.'Nobel Foundation (2008). The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 19011951 Brahmachari's cure for Visceral leishmaniasis was the urea salt of para-amino-phenyl stibnic acid which he called Urea Stibamine.Upendra Nath Brahmachari: A Pioneer of Modern Medicine in India. Vigyan Prasar: Government of India Following the discovery of Urea Stibamine, Visceral leishmaniasis was largely eradicated from the world, except for some underdeveloped regions. *Angina pectoris: The condition was named \\"hritshoola\\" in ancient India and was described by Sushruta (6th century BCE). =Mining= * Diamond mining and diamond tools: Diamonds were first recognised and mined in central India,Hershey (2004), page 22Malkin (1996), page 12 where significant alluvial deposits of the stone could then be found along the rivers Penner, Krishna and Godavari. It is unclear when diamonds were first mined in India, although estimated to be at least 5,000 years ago.Hershey (2004), pages 3 & 23 India remained the world's only source of diamonds until the discovery of diamonds in Brazil in the 18th century.Thomas (2007), page 46Read (2005), page 17Lee, page 685 Golconda served as an important centre for diamonds in central India.Wenk, pages 535539 Diamonds then were exported to other parts of the world, including Europe. Early references to diamonds in India come from Sanskrit texts.MSN Encarta (2007). Diamond. Archived 1 November 2009. The Arthashastra of Kautilya mentions diamond trade in India. Buddhist works dating from the 4th century BCE mention it as a well-known and precious stone but don't mention the details of diamond cutting. Another Indian description written at the beginning of the 3rd century describes strength, regularity, brilliance, ability to scratch metals, and good refractive properties as the desirable qualities of a diamond.Dickinson, pages 13 A Chinese work from the 3rd century BCE mentions: \\"Foreigners wear it [diamond] in the belief that it can ward off evil influences\\". The Chinese, who did not find diamonds in their country, initially used diamonds as a \\"jade cutting knife\\" instead of as a jewel. * Zinc mining and medicinal zinc: Zinc was first smelted from zinc ore in India. Zinc mines of Zawar, near Udaipur, Rajasthan, were active during early Christian era. There are references of medicinal uses of zinc in the Charaka Samhita (300 BCE).Craddock (1983) The Rasaratna Samuccaya which dates back to the Tantric period () explains the existence of two types of ores for zinc metal, one of which is ideal for metal extraction while the other is used for medicinal purpose.Biswas (1986), page 11 India was to melt the first derived from a long experience of the old alchemy zinc by the distillation process, an advanced technique. The ancient Persians had also tried to reduce zinc oxide in an open stove, but had failed. Zawar in Tiri valley of Rajasthan is the first known old zinc smelting site in the world. The distillation technique of zinc production dates back to the 12th century CE and is an important contribution of India in the world of science. =Sciences= Bengali Chemist Prafulla Chandra Roy synthesised NH4NO2 in its pure form. A Ramachandran plot generated from the protein PCNA, a human DNA clamp protein that is composed of both beta sheets and alpha helices (PDB ID 1AXC). Points that lie on the axes indicate N- and C-terminal residues for each subunit. The green regions show possible angle formations that include Glycine, while the blue areas are for formations that don't include Glycine. *Gravity: Aryabhata first identified the force to explain why objects do not spin out when the earth rotates, Brahmagupta described gravity as an attractive force and used the term gurutvƒÅkar·π£a·πá for gravity.* Aryabhata was the one who first developed a heliocentric model of solar system, where the planets spin on their axes and follow orbits around the Sun while the moon revolving around the earth in epicycles. * Ammonium nitrite, synthesis in pure form: Prafulla Chandra Roy synthesised NH4NO2 in its pure form, and became the first scientist to have done so. Prior to Ray's synthesis of Ammonium nitrite it was thought that the compound undergoes rapid thermal decomposition releasing nitrogen and water in the process. * Ashtekar variables: In theoretical physics, Ashtekar (new) variables, named after Abhay Ashtekar who invented them, represent an unusual way to rewrite the metric on the three-dimensional spatial slices in terms of a SU(2) gauge field and its complementary variable. Ashtekar variables are the key building block of loop quantum gravity. * Atom: One of the remarkable scientists of ancient India was Kanada, who is said to have developed the atomic theory centuries before John Dalton was born. He speculated the existence of Anu or a small indestructible particles, similar to an atom. He also explained that Anu can have two states ‚Äì absolute peace and a state of movement. He wrote that atoms of the same substance combined with each other and in a specific manner to form synchronised dvyanuka (diatomic molecules) which then generated tryanuka (triatomic molecules). * Bhatnagar-Mathur Magnetic Interference Balance: Invented jointly by Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar and K.N. Mathur in 1928, the so-called 'Bhatnagar-Mathur Magnetic Interference Balance' was a modern instrument used for measuring various magnetic properties. The first appearance of this instrument in Europe was at a Royal Society exhibition in London, where it was later marketed by British firm Messers Adam Hilger and Co, London.Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar . Vigyan Prasar: Government of India. * Bhabha scattering: In 1935, Indian nuclear physicist Homi J. Bhabha published a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A, in which he performed the first calculation to determine the cross section of electron-positron scattering. Electron-positron scattering was later named Bhabha scattering, in honour of his contributions in the field.Penney (1967), page 39 * Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics, condensate: On 4 June 1924 the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose mailed a short manuscript to Albert Einstein entitled Planck's Law and the Light Quantum Hypothesis seeking Einstein's influence to get it published after it was rejected by the prestigious journal Philosophical Magazine.Rigden (2005), pages 143144 The paper introduced what is today called Bose statistics, which showed how it could be used to derive the Planck blackbody spectrum from the assumption that light was made of photons.Fraser (2006), page 238 Einstein, recognizing the importance of the paper translated it into German himself and submitted it on Bose's behalf to the prestigious Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik. Einstein later applied Bose's principles on particles with mass and quickly predicted the Bose-Einstein condensate.Dauxois & Peyrard (2006), pages 297298 *Boson: The name boson was coined by Paul DiracNotes on Dirac's lecture Developments in Atomic Theory at Le Palais de la D√©couverte, 6 December 1945, UKNATARCHI Dirac Papers BW83/2/257889. See note 64 to p. 331 in \\"The Strangest Man\\" by Graham Farmelo to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose. In quantum mechanics, a boson (, entry \\"Boson\\" ) is a particle that follows Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics. Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions.Carroll, Sean (2007) Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe, Guidebook Part 2 p. 43, The Teaching Company, \\"...boson: A force-carrying particle, as opposed to a matter particle (fermion). Bosons can be piled on top of each other without limit. Examples include photons, gluons, gravitons, weak bosons, and the Higgs boson. The spin of a boson is always an integer, such as 0, 1, 2, and so on...\\" * Braunstein-Ghosh-Severini Entropy: This modelling of entropy using network theory is used in the analysis of quantum gravity and is named after Sibasish Ghosh and his teammates, Samuel L. Braunstein and Simone Severini. * Chandrasekhar limit and Chandrasekhar number: Discovered by and named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983 for his work on stellar structure and stellar evolution. . Subrrahmanyan Chandrasekhar discovered the calculation used to determine the future of what would happen to a dying star. If the star's mass is less than the Chandrasekhar Limit it will shrink to become a white dwarf, and if it is great the star will explode, becoming a supernova * Galena, applied use in electronics of: Bengali scientist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose effectively used Galena crystals for constructing radio receivers.\\"Indian Scientists\\" (November 2004), Science Popularisation and Public Outreach Committee, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. The Galena receivers of Bose were used to receive signals consisting of shortwave, white light and ultraviolet light. In 1904 Bose patented the use of Galena Detector which he called Point Contact Diode using Galena.Sarkar (2006), page 94 * Helium: The French astronomer, Pierre Janssen observed the Solar eclipse of 18 August 1868 from Guntur in Madras State, British India. He discovered the first evidence of helium as a bright yellow line in the chromograph of the Sun * Mahalanobis distance: Introduced in 1936 by the Indian (Bengali) statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis (29 June 1893 ‚Äì 28 June 1972), this distance measure, based upon the correlation between variables, is used to identify and analyze differing pattern with respect to one base.Taguchi & Jugulum (2002), pages 67 * Mercurous Nitrite: The compound mercurous nitrite was discovered in 1896 by the Bengali chemist Prafulla Chandra Roy, who published his findings in the Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal.\\"Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray\\" , Viyan Prasar, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. The discovery contributed as a base for significant future research in the field of chemistry. * Ramachandran plot, Ramachandran map, and Ramachandran angles: The Ramachandran plot and Ramachandran map were developed by Gopalasamudram Narayana Iyer Ramachandran, who published his results in the Journal of Molecular Biology in 1963. He also developed the Ramachandran angles, which serve as a convenient tool for communication, representation, and various kinds of data analysis.Ramakrishnan (2001) * Raman effect: The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008) reports: \\"change in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by molecules. The phenomenon is named for Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, who discovered it in 1928. When a beam of light traverses a dust-free, transparent sample of a chemical compound, a small fraction of the light emerges in directions other than that of the incident (incoming) beam. Most of this scattered light is of unchanged wavelength. A small part, however, has wavelengths different from that of the incident light; its presence is a result of the Raman effect.\\"\\"Raman effect\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008) * Raychaudhuri equation: Discovered by the Bengali physicist Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri in 1954. This was a key ingredient of the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems of general relativity.Naresh (2005) =Space= *Lunar water: Although the presence of water ice on the moon has been conjectured by various scientists since the 1960s, inconclusive evidence of free water ice had also been identified. The first incontrovertible evidence of water on the moon was provided by the payload Chace carried by the Moon Impact Probe released by Chandrayaan-1 in 2009, confirmed and established by NASA. *Earth's orbit (Sidereal year): The Hindu cosmological time cycles explained in the Surya Siddhanta(c.600 CE), give the average length of the sidereal year (the length of the Earth's revolution around the Sun) as 365.2563627 days, which is only a negligible 1.4 seconds longer than the modern value of 365.256363004 days. This calculation was the most accurate estimate for the length of the sidereal year anywhere in the world for over a thousand years. * Periodicity of comets: Indian astronomers by the 6th century believed that comets were celestial bodies that re-appeared periodically. This was the view expressed in the 6th century by the astronomers Varahamihira and Bhadrabahu, and the 10th-century astronomer Bhattotpala listed the names and estimated periods of certain comets, but it is unfortunately not known how these figures were calculated or how accurate they were. * Saha ionisation equation: The Saha equation, derived by the Bengali scientist Meghnad Saha (6 October 1893 ‚Äì 16 February 1956) in 1920, conceptualises ionisations in context of stellar atmospheres.Narlikar (2002), page 188 *Quasi-normal modes of black holes: C. V. Vishveshwara discovered the quasi-normal modes of black holes.Vishveshwara, C.V., Nature, 1970, 227, 936 These modes of black hole vibrations are one of the main targets of observation using the gravitational wave detectors. Innovations * Iron working: Iron works were developed in India, around the same time as, but independently of, Anatolia and the Caucasus. Archaeological sites in India, such as Malhar, Dadupur, Raja Nala Ka Tila and Lahuradewa in present-day Uttar Pradesh show iron implements in the period between 1800 BCE‚Äî1200 BCE. Early iron objects found in India can be dated to 1400 BCE by employing the method of radiocarbon dating. Spikes, knives, daggers, arrow-heads, bowls, spoons, saucepans, axes, chisels, tongs, door fittings etc. ranging from 600 BCE to 200 BCE have been discovered from several archaeological sites of India.Marco Ceccarelli (2000). International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms: Proceedings HMM Symposium. Springer. . pp 218 Some scholars believe that by the early 13th century BCE, iron smelting was practised on a bigger scale in India, suggesting that the date the technology's inception may be placed earlier. In Southern India (present day Mysore) iron appeared as early as 11th to 12th centuries BCE; these developments were too early for any significant close contact with the northwest of the country.I. M. Drakonoff (1991). Early Antiquity. University of Chicago Press. . pp 372 In the time of Chandragupta II Vikramaditya (375413 CE), corrosion-resistant iron was used to erect the Iron pillar of Delhi, which has withstood corrosion for over 1,600 years. =Computer science and Programming= *Simputer: The Simputer (acronym for \\"simple, inexpensive and multilingual people's computer\\") is a self-contained, open hardware handheld computer, designed for use in environments where computing devices such as personal computers are deemed inconvenient. It was developed in 1999 by 7 scientists of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, led by Dr. Swami Manohar in collaboration with Encore India, a company based in Bangalore. Originally envisaged to bring internet to the masses of India, the Simputer and its derivatives are today widely utilised by governments of several Indian states as part of their e-governance drive, the Indian Army, as well as by other public and private organisations. *Backus-naur form: In computer science, Backus‚ÄìNaur form or Backus normal form (BNF) or Panini Backus form is a notation technique for context-free grammars, often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats, instruction sets and communication protocols. They are applied wherever exact descriptions of languages are needed: for instance, in official language specifications, in manuals, and in textbooks on programming language theory.The idea of describing the structure of language using rewriting rules can be traced back to at least the work of PƒÅ·πáini (who lived sometime between the 7th and 4th century BCE). Ingerman suggests that the Backus Normal Form be renamed to the PƒÅ·πáini-Backus Form, to give due credit to PƒÅ·πáini as the earliest independent inventor. The name PƒÅ·πáini Backus form has also been suggested in view of the fact that the expansion Backus normal form may not be accurate, and that PƒÅ·πáini had independently developed a similar notation earlier. His notation to describe Sanskrit word structure notation is equivalent in power to that of Backus and has many similar properties. =Linguistics= *Formal grammar: In his treatise Astadhyayi, Panini gives formal production rules and definitions to describe the formal grammar of Sanskrit. In formal language theory, a grammar (when the context is not given, often called a formal grammar for clarity) is a set of production rules for strings in a formal language. The rules describe how to form strings from the language's alphabet that are valid according to the language's syntax. A grammar does not describe the meaning of the strings or what can be done with them in whatever context‚Äîonly their form. =Metrology= *Standardisation: The oldest applications and evidence of standardisation come from the Indus Valley Civilisation in the 5th millennium BCE characterised by the existence of weights in various standards and categories as well as the Indus merchants usage of a centralised weight and measure system. Small weights were used to measure luxury goods, and larger weights were used for buying bulkier items, such as food grains etc.Kenoyer, 265 The weights and measures of the Indus civilisation also reached Persia and Central Asia, where they were further modified.In the third millennium BCE the Indus measuring system was further developed in the ancient regions of Iran and Afghanistan  Iwata, 2254. > A total of 558 weights were excavated from Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and Chanhu- > daro, not including defective weights. They did not find statistically > significant differences between weights that were excavated from five > different layers, each about 1.5 m in thickness. This was evidence that > strong control existed for at least a 500-year period. The 13.7-g weight > seems to be one of the units used in the Indus valley. The notation was > based on the binary and decimal systems. 83% of the weights which were > excavated from the above three cities were cubic, and 68% were made of > chert. *Technical standards: Technical standards were being applied and used in the Indus Valley Civilisation since the 5th millennium BCE to enable gauging devices to be effectively used in angular measurement and measurement in construction.Baber, 23 Uniform units of length were used in the planning and construction of towns such as Lothal, Surkotada, Kalibangan, Dholavira, Harappa, and Mohenjo-daro. The weights and measures of the Indus civilisation also reached Persia and Central Asia, where they were further modified. Shigeo Iwata describes the excavated weights unearthed from the Indus civilisation: See also * Timeline of Indian innovation * Nalanda University * History of science and technology in India * Timeline of historic inventions References Bibliography * Adas, Michael (January 2001).

It is high but appears higher because of its great isolation and high prominence. It is a prominent feature in many of the views from the northern Lake District on a clear day. It is surrounded by a host of satellites, including Long Fell, Maidenpap and Bainloch Hill. The slopes of Criffel feature the upland vegetation of heather, bog cotton and blaeberry and are inhabited by skylarks. Loch Kindar sits at the foot of the hill. A new path to the summit is currently finishing construction. https://www.visitscotland.org/news/2020/dumfies-and-galloway-rtif-criffel-path  Etymology  Triangulation station and Douglas's Cairn, Criffel The name Criffel is recorded in 1273 as Crufel. The second element, -fel, is either Older Scots or Northern Middle English fell or Old Norse fjall 'mountain'. Because Old Norse fjall had been borrowed into Middle English by the twelfth century, it is not possible to determine whether or not the name was coined by Scandinavian speakers. There have been a number of proposals for the etymology of the first element. The name is recorded as Crofel in 1319 and in 1330 as Crefel. (Drummond also gives the form Crafel in 1330; it is not clear if this refers to the same source.) In 1892 Johnston proposed Gaelic crich 'boundary' + Icelandic fell in Place-Names of Scotland. However, by the second edition of 1903 he thought a derivation from Icelandic kryfja 'to split' was more probable. In the third edition in 1934 this is the only derivation offered. Mills also takes the name to be Old Scandinavian kryfja + fjall but adds that the first element is 'doubtful'. In 1930 Maxwell proposed Scandinavian kraka fjall 'raven's or crow's hill' or Lowland Scots Craw Fell. William J. Watson rejected a derivation from kraka fjall on the grounds that it would develop into a form like Crackel. Geoffery Barrow suggested that Criffel incorporates the name Cro, which also appears in Desnes Cro, the name of a deanery located between the rivers Nith and Urr. Here Cro represents the Gaelic word for sheepfold.

In this audio recording, he also cited White's \\"exquisite drawings,\\" works of art in themselves, in addition to their role as working design sketches. Douglas Colby, expert on theater design, tells the story of accompanying White to a performance of Fall River Legend several years ago. He said, \\"The distinguished costume designer Patricia Zipprodt approached the urbane, monocled gentleman I was accompanying, my friend Miles White, and introduced him to her guests as 'God.' One understood what she meant,\\" Colby concluded. This information appears in the Playbill booklet distributed at the March 20, 2000 Memorial Service. As reported in The New York Times, Mary C. Henderson in her book Theater in America, mentioned that Miles White's designs were inspired by the dance and the circus. \\"His costumes are constructed to move with the performer's body, not an easy feat,\\" she wrote.

In addition to his status as a founder of behavioral pharmacology, he made significant contributions in the areas of drug abuse and treatment, space exploration, and human research ethics.  Early life and education  Brady was born in New York City in 1922 and attended school in the Catholic parochial school system in Brooklyn, New York. He began his undergraduate studies in 1940 at Fordham University, receiving a bachelor of science degree in 1943. =Military service= While at Fordham, Brady joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and following graduation, Brady attended officers‚Äô training school. Brady was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant and infantry platoon leader in the U.S. Army and served in World War II in the European Theater. At the close of the war, Brady was assigned to the 317th Station Hospital in Wiesbaden, Germany, a former Luftwaffe hospital that had been designated as the Neuropsychiatric Center of the European Command. There, despite having no training in psychology or psychiatry, Brady served as the Chief Clinical Psychologist for two and a half years, teaching himself how to conduct psychological assessments from German texts. =Graduate studies= Continuing his military service as a Captain, Brady engaged in doctoral studies in the Department of Psychology at the University of Chicago under advisor Howard Hunt. Hunt was a former student of influential behaviorist B.F. Skinner at the University of Minnesota. Skinner and his functional analysis of behavior became an important influence on Brady, who used animal models throughout his career. Brady‚Äôs dissertation research on conditioned emotional responses in rats demonstrated that conditioned anxiety responses could be eliminated through electroconvulsive shock and set the stage for later work on pharmacological agents such as reserpine that were emerging at the time as possible tools for psychiatric intervention. Brady received his doctorate in psychology in 1951.  Career  =Walter Reed Army Research Institute= Following his completion of the doctoral degree, Brady was assigned to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 1951, retaining his Army commission. Due to his background in animal model research, Brady was subsequently hired as the head of the newly established Department of Experimental Psychology in the Walter Reed Army Research Institute. With the ability to recruit talented scientists fulfilling their military service obligations to his laboratory, Brady established one of the first multidisciplinary physiological psychology (an early term for neuroscience) research programs in the country. Collaborators included behavior analysts such as Murray Sidman, Richard Herrnstein, and John Boren, neuroscientists Larry Stein, William Stebbins, Eliot Valenstein, Walle Nauta, and Robert Galambos, as well as neurophysiologist John W. Mason and neurosurgeon Robert. W. Porter. This pulling together of researchers from different backgrounds was characteristic of Brady‚Äôs unitary vision of behavior analysis, neuroscience, and biology as aspects of the same scientific discipline that were separated only by their focus on different variables. During this time, Brady‚Äôs research group continued work on the conditioned emotional response in animal models using rats and primates, conducting studies on the effects of tetraethylammonium, amphetamine, reserpine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), Nembutal, and Benzedrine. Brady‚Äôs paper on reserpine led to considerable interest from pharmaceutical companies concerned with exploring the behavioral effects of pharmacological compounds for commercial use. As a result, Brady consulted with several of these companies, who set up labs, often led by Walter Reed alums, that adopted test procedures developed at Walter Reed. Brady also conducted one of the first studies of subcortical electrical brain self- stimulation in animals and authored a paper on ‚ÄúUlcers in ‚Äòexecutive‚Äô monkeys‚Äù, that provided evidence for the relationship between intermittent schedules of emotional stress and physical symptomology. This paper and its use of primate subjects caught the attention of Wernher von Braun, paving the way for Brady‚Äôs work with the space program. =University of Maryland= In addition to his research program at Walter Reed, in 1957, Brady joined the faculty of the Psychology Department at the University of Maryland, College Park and became the director of the Psychopharmocology Laboratory, established with the help of a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health, the first they awarded in behavioral pharmacology. Early additions to the lab at College Park were Charles R. Schuster and Travis Thompson, who would go on to co-write the first textbook in behavioral pharmacology. As detailed in a 1961 Science paper, Schuster, Thompson, and Brady developed a procedure with rhesus monkeys that allowed the monkeys to intravenously self-administer a saline solution through lever pressing behavior. Later they would extend the self- administration procedure to the testing of drug abuse liability which would become a major focus of Brady‚Äôs laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. =Involvement in the Space Program= Due to Brady‚Äôs experience working with primates, Wernher von Braun of the U.S. Army Ballistics Agency solicited the help of Brady in training primates to provide data for the first live organism sub-orbital spaceflights initiated by the U.S. Brady and his collaborators, mainly Murray Sidman, who developed the avoidance procedure which would eventually take his name, trained rhesus monkeys to press a lever at specific time intervals to avoid an electric shock. If the lever was pressed within the time interval, no shock was received. In 1959, Able and Baker, two of the trained monkeys, were able to endure a 10,000 mile per hour suborbital flight in the nose cone of a Saturn rocket while successfully completing the pre- launch avoidance tasks and were safely recovered. Brady also took part in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) animal pretest flights for Project Mercury. Brady and other behavioral analysts from Walter Reed and the University of Maryland trained a number of chimpanzees to complete simple timed tasks in response to stimuli such as flashing lights and sounds. Successful completion of the task resulted in reward with a banana pellet, while failure resulted in electric shock. Ham, one of the trained chimps, successfully completed a sub-orbital flight in 1961, with his in-flight task performance similar to his previous performance on earth, providing evidence that simple tasks could be performed during space-flight. That year, Enos, another trained chimp, successfully completed a flight into earth‚Äôs orbit and was successfully recovered, though the behavioral analysis test malfunctioned during the flight. In addition to his work with primates, Brady and his research team established a continuously programmed human residential laboratory at the University of Maryland and later the Programmed Environmental Research Center at Johns Hopkins, that simulated conditions of prolonged human habitation in confined spaces, similar to those that would exist in prolonged space travel. =Johns Hopkins University= In 1970, Brady retired from the US Army at the rank of colonel and accepted an appointment at Johns Hopkins University Medical School in Baltimore as a professor of Behavioral Biology. At Hopkins, Brady continued the use of animal drug self- administration procedures, this time to test the abuse liability of drugs. Brady developed a procedure to test the relative reinforcing strength of a drug, which provided evidence for their potential for abuse. In this procedure, animals were trained to provide a specific response (e.g. push a lever) to receive an infusion of a drug. A progressive ratio schedule was then used, continually increasing the number of times the behavior would have to be performed to determine how many times the animal would perform the behavior to receive the drug, until a break point was reached in which the animal would no longer perform the behavior. This procedure allowed Brady and other researchers to rank order the addictive potential of drugs. The more times an animal would perform the behavior before reaching a break point, the more reinforcing the drug was, and the more liable the drug was to be abused. Brady also utilized a drug substitution procedure, in which he tested whether animal subjects could discriminate between an initial training drug and a second test drug. If the animals provided the same behavioral responses to the test drug as the training drug, it could be supported that the drugs have similar subjective effects as well as abuse potential. These procedures were influential outside of Brady‚Äôs lab, and were eventually adopted by the World Health Organization in 1978 to test the addiction risk of new medications worldwide. Brady‚Äôs work in this area also helped illustrate how drugs are powerful reinforcers, amending basic theories of addiction and contributing to the development of modern approaches to substance abuse treatment. =Research Ethics= Brady served as a member of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects that authored the landmark Belmont Report in 1978, which became the basis for Institutional Review Board ethics rules at research institutions nationwide. To the commission, Brady contributed a radical behaviorist perspective on ethics as consisting of two components: values, or what people say is important to them, and morals, the practices that society rewards and punishes.  Honors and awards  Over the course of his career, Brady amassed considerable professional honors and awards including: President of the Society for Behavioral Medicine, President of the Society for Behavioral Pharmocology. Bioastronautics Research Award for Outstanding Contributions to the space program. Member, Life Sciences Panel, President‚Äôs Science Advisory Committee (1961‚Äì1963); Chairman, National Institutes of Health Study Section (1972‚Äì1976, 1979‚Äì1984, 1989‚Äì1994); Chairman, National Academy of Sciences Committee on Problems of Drug Dependence (1981‚Äì 1983); Associate Chairman, National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1974‚Äì1979); Member, Committee on Space Biology and Medicine, National Academy of Sciences (1984‚Äì1988);Member, NASA and National Institutes of Health Scientific Advisory Committee on Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1995); Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award, American Psychological Association (1992); President, Society of Behavioral Medicine (1979); and Distinguished Scientific Service Award, Association for Behavior Analysis (1996).

Known variously as Chas, Chuck, or \\"Dinny\\" Dinsmore, he was born in Toronto, Ontario, where he played for the amateur Toronto Aura Lee Juniors hockey team and the Toronto Argonauts football team, before eventually playing pro hockey for the Montreal Maroons. The 1924‚Äì25 NHL season was the first for both the Maroons and the Boston Bruins, and on December 1, 1924 Charles earned the first goal ever scored against the Bruins (the Bruins won the game 2-1). He won the Stanley Cup in 1926. He left the game in 1928 to take a job as a bond trader. But in the middle of the 1929-30 NHL season, he asked the Maroons about getting his old job back because he said the stock market did not offer the same thrills as playing in the NHL. Montreal team officials told him that they had no more money in the budget to sign another player, but Dinsmore was insistent and struck a deal by signing a contract to play for the Maroons which would pay him one dollar for the remaining nine games.Toronto Daily Star, March 26, 1930; p. 10.

Its current leader is Rifaat Eid.  Origins  Ali Eid in 2008 The ADP traced back its origins to an earlier leftist students' organization called the Alawite Youth Movement ‚Äì AYM (Arabic: ÿ≠ÿ±ŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ®ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸàŸä  Harakat al-Shabab al-Alawiyya) or Mouvement de la Jeunesse Alaouite (MJA) in French, originally formed in 1972 at Tripoli by Ali Eid, a former teacher. As its name implies, the AYM drew its support from the Shia Alawite minority sect of Lebanon, even receiving the personal backing of Rifa'at al- Assad,\\"Rifaat founded the Red Knights in northern Lebanon in the early 1970s and they were eventually instrumental in helping Yasser Arafat to slip by sea to Tripoli in 1983...\\"Naharnet Syria‚Äôs vice-president at the time and himself a member of that sect. During the early war years, the AYM kept itself outside the LNM-PLO alliance, but in 1977‚Äì78 the movement joined the Patriotic Opposition Front ‚Äì POF (Arabic: ÿ¨ÿ®Ÿáÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿßÿ±ÿ∂ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸàÿ∑ŸÜŸäÿ©  Jabhat al-Muearadat al-Wataniyya), a pro-Syrian multiconfessional coalition of Lebanese notables and activists founded in Tripoli by the MP Talal El-Merhebi (elected in 1972), Souhale Hamadah, Rashid Al-Muadim, George Mourani, and Nassib Al-Khatib, with Ali Eid being elected vice-president of the new formation. However, internal disagreements soon led to the dissolution of the alliance at the early 1980s, when Eid and some of its ex-coalition partners went to form in 1982 the ADP, choosing the Sunni Muslim lawyer Nassib Al-Khatib as their first Secretary- General, later replaced by Ali Eid in 1985. In the process, the AYM was absorbed into the new party and became its youth branch.  The ADP in the civil war 1982‚Äì1990  Widely regarded as a Syrian-backed proxy force, the ADP and its Red Knights' battled several Tripoli-based factions hostile to Damascus' presence in Lebanon, in particular the Sunni Islamic Unification Movement ‚Äì IUM ()\\"Sporadic fighting in Tripoli between the Alawite ADP forces and anti-Syrian Sunni Moslem groups has continued throughout the 1980s. Open conflict between the ADP and anti-Syrian Sunni groups broke out in the streets of Tripoli in 1981‚Äì82, largely in response to the conflict in Syria between the Sunni majority and the Alawites who constitute the ruling elite. \\"\\"Hashem Minqara: Free at Last\\" (September 2000) since 1981‚Äì82, which they suppressed with the help of the Syrian Army, the pro-Syrian Syrian Social Nationalist Party and Ba'ath Party factions and the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) in 1985‚Äì86.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 171. The ADP/ARK also joined the LNRF (Jammoul) guerrilla alliance in September 1982 to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and later its successor, the wider Syrian-sponsored Lebanese National Salvation Front (LNSF) in July 1983 against the American-backed government of President Amin Gemayel. In 1988‚Äì1990 they accepted the Taif Agreement and supported the parliament-based provisional government of Selim al-Hoss against General Michel Aoun's military interim government. = Military structure and organization = The ADP raised in July 1981 with Syrian support its own militia,O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 110. the Arab Red Knights ‚Äì ARK () or Red Knights for short.

Commanded by Ali Eid the ARK initially aligned just 500 militiamen,Makdisi and Sadaka, The Lebanese Civil War, 1975‚Äì1990 (2003), p. 44, Table 1: War Period Militias. but subsequently grew to 1,000 well-armed male and female fighters, organized into infantry, signals, medical and Military Police 'branches', plus a motorized corps made of gun-trucks or 'technicals'. The latter consisted of UAZ-469 light utility vehicles, CJ-5 and CJ-8 jeeps,Neville, Technicals: Non-Standard Tactical Vehicles from the Great Toyota War to modern Special Forces (2018), p. 9. Santana 88 Ligero Militar jeeps, Land-Rover series II-III and Toyota Land Cruiser (J40) light pickups equipped with heavy machine-guns, recoilless rifles and Anti-Aircraft autocannons. The ADP/ARK operated mainly in northern Lebanon, with its main stronghold in the adjacent Alawite-populated Jabal Mohsen, a sub-urban strategic high ground area overlooking the whole city of Tripoli though they also claimed to control some of the Alawite villages of the Akkar District right up to the Lebanese-Syrian border. Illegal activities and controversy By the mid-1980s, allied with the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) Popular Guards' militia, the Red Knights also controlled the city‚Äôs commercial harbour and oil refinery ‚Äì the second largest deep-waters port of Lebanon ‚Äì in collusion with the director of Tripoli‚Äôs harbour Ahmad Karami and corrupt Syrian Army officers. The National Fuel Company (NFC) headed jointly by businessmen Maan Karami (brother of late prime-minister Rachid Karami) and Haj Muhammad Awadah, run in the behalf of the ADP and LCP a profitable fuel smuggling ring that stretched to the Beqaa Valley.  The post-war years  After the end of the civil strife in October 1990, the ADP was disarmed and its leader Ali Eid was elected in 1991 to the newly established Alawite seat in the Lebanese Parliament. Prior to this, no Alawite had been elected to the Lebanese parliament. The Party seems to have revised its traditional pro- Syrian stance in the 1990s, in favour of a moderate, cautious neutralist posture in the current sphere of Lebanon‚Äôs internal politics. In 2005 it was rumoured that Rifa'at al-Assad was reviving the Red Knights militia in Tripoli.\\"President Bashar Assad's exiled uncle, Rifaat Assad, is reactivating his \\"Red Knights\\" dissident organization in Alawite-populated regions surrounding the northern port city of Tripoli after the downfall of Syria's 29-year control of Lebanon, An Nahar reported on Sunday.\\" It rearmed during the 2007 Lebanon conflict, after it was revealed that the Islamist group Fatah al-Islam had planned to attack the Alawites of Tripoli. It was active during the 2008 Lebanon conflict, now led by Ali Eid's son Rifaat, being between 1,000 and 2,000 men strong. During the 2008 conflict, where Sunnis and Shias fought throughout Lebanon, Rifaat said in an interview: \\"We're the most convenient targets, the stand-in for Hezbollah, our problem can only be solved when the Shiites and Sunnis solve theirs.\\" As many as 9,000 Alawites fled their homes during the conflict. Despite years of operating freely a militia throughout Tripoli, the Lebanese Army later severely cracked down on the ADP's military wing starting in April 2014. This forced most militants to surrender to the Internal Security Forces (ISF) and led the group's leaders/commanders to flee in order to avoid the possibility of life in prison. Syrian Civil War During the Syrian civil war, spillover from that conflict has led to further tensions between the ADP and neighbouring Sunni IUM militants. On 29 March 2014, Rifaat and Ali Eid Left Lebanon to Syria. And on April 10, 2014, the Lebanese Military Investigative Judge Riyad Abu Ghayda issued an arrest warrant in absentia for the pro-Assad figure Rifaat Eid and 11 of his associates over their alleged involvement in clashes on the northern city of Tripoli. Abu Ghayda‚Äôs warrants are based on articles in the Penal Code that could lead to the death penalty.

Source: USGS Copper mining in the United States has been a major industry since the rise of the northern Michigan copper district in the 1840s. In 2017 the United States produced 1.27 million metric tonnes of copper, worth $8 billion, making it the world's fourth largest copper producer, after Chile, China, and Peru. Copper was produced from 23 mines in the US. Top copper producing states in 2014 were (in descending order) Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, and Montana. Minor production also came from Idaho, and Missouri. As of 2014, the US had 45 million tonnes of known remaining reserves of copper, the fifth largest known copper reserves in the world, after Chile, Australia, Peru, and Mexico.Mineral Commodity Summary - U.S. Geological Survey - January 2018 Copper in the US is used mainly in construction (43%) and electric equipment (19%). In 2014, the nation produced 69% of the copper it used, relying on imports from Chile, Canada, Peru, and Mexico for the remaining 31%. Copper mining activity increased in the early 2000s because of increased price: the price increased from an average of $0.76 per pound for the year 2002, to $3.02 per pound for 2007.D.R. Wilburn, \\"Exploration review,\\" Mining Engineering, May 2008, p.47. A number of byproducts are recovered from American copper mining. In 2013, American copper mining produced 28,500 metric tons of molybdenum, worth about $700‚Äì$800 million, which was 47% of total US production.Molybdenum US Geological Survey, Minerals Yearbook 2013. In 2014, copper mining produced about 15 metric tons of gold, worth $600 million, which represented 7% of US gold production.Gold US Geological Survey, Commodity Updates, 2015 Other byproducts of the copper extraction process included silver, and minor amounts of rhenium and platinum- group metals. Sulfuric acid is recovered at copper smelters.US Geological Survey, Sulfur, Minerals Yearbook, 2012. Ore grades Average grade of United States copper ore, and of concentrating ore (data from USGS) From the start of copper mining in the Michigan copper district, ore has been divided into two classes. The rock with higher copper content was smelter ore, also called direct shipping ore, and required no treatment before going to the smelter. The rock with less copper was called milling ore, or concentrating ore, and required crushing and separation of ore minerals from the waste rock to produce copper concentrate, which was sent to the smelter. Because metallic minerals have higher specific gravities than most gangue (waste) minerals, concentrating the milling ore was done in various gravity classifiers. The early Michigan copper mines used buddles. Later copper mining used improved gravity-classification machinery, including jigs, vanners, and Wilfley tables. A revolutionary development in American copper mining took place when mining engineer Daniel Cowan Jackling conceived of mining the huge but low-grade copper ore body at Bingham Canyon, Utah, using steam shovels in a big open pit. Steam shovels had previously been used in the iron mines of the Mesabi Range, in Minnesota, but had not been used in copper mining. Jackling incorporated the Utah Copper Company in 1903, and in 1906 began excavating. From the start, the Bingham Canyon Mine was one of the leading copper- producing mines in the world, and returned a good profit mining ore with less than two percent copper.Horace J. Stevens, The Copper Handbook, v8 (Houghton, Mich: Horace Stevens, 1908) 1377‚Äì1381. Mining by open-pit model using large- scale mechanization was copied by other US mines, in Ely, Nevada (1908), Santa Rita, New Mexico (1910), and Ajo, Arizona (1917). The entire output of these mines was low-grade milling ore. The open-pit mining of porphyry copper deposits was adopted worldwide. In the 1910s and 1920s, copper mills adopted the froth flotation method, which had been developed in Australia. Whereas the old gravity methods of concentration, using jigs and Wilfley tables recovered 60 to 80 percent of the copper in the ore, froth flotation recovered 90 to 95 percent.George J. Young, Elements of Mining, 4th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1946) 3. The Bingham Canyon mill installed froth flotation in 1918. Large- scale mining of low-grade orebodies became predominant, and the amount of direct-shipping ore mined fell drastically in the first half of the 20th century, and by 1960, the contribution of direct-shipping ore was insignificant. Improvements in low-cost mining and ore processing allowed the average ore grade of milling ore to decline. Smelters There are three operating copper smelters in the United States.World copper smelters, US Geological Survey, published 2002, accessed 21 June 2016. * Grupo Mexico, Hayden, Arizona , Grupo Mexico, accessed 18 July 2018. * Rio Tinto, Garfield, Utah , Rio Tinto, published 28 February 2017, accessed 18 July 2018. * Freeport McMoRan, Miami, Arizona , Freeport McMoRan, published 2 April 2017, accessed 18 July 2018. The United States is a net exporter of copper ore and copper concentrate. In 2015, out of 1.25 million metric tons of recoverable copper metal extracted from mines, 320,000 tons of copper were exported in the form of ore and concentrate, to be smelted and refined elsewhere. By state =Alabama= The Stone Hill mine (also known as the Woods mine) was discovered in 1874, and worked 1874 to 1879, and 1896 to 1899. Production was hampered by poor transportation. The ore is massive and disseminated sulfides in hornblende schist of Precambrian or Paleozoic age. Principal ore minerals are chalcopyrite and sphalerite, which occur with pyrrhotite, pyrite, and quartz. Two other copper prospects, the Johnston prospect and the Smith prospect, are nearby, but it is not known that any copper was produced from them.Gilbert H. Espenshade (1963) Geology of some copper deposits in North Carolina, Virginia, and Alabama, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1142-I, p.I42-I46. =Alaska= The Kennecott Concentration Mill, the mines are in the mountains to the east Alaska is not currently a significant copper producer. Russian explorers discovered copper on the Kasaan Peninsula of Prince of Wales Island in southeastern Alaska about 1865. Mining began in the period 1895‚Äì1900, and continued until shortly after World War I. Copper is present as chalcopyrite, occurring with magnetite, pyrite, garnet, epidote, diopside, and hornblende, in replacement deposits in greenstone. Gold and silver were recovered as byproducts.L.A. Warner, E.N. Goddard, and others (1961) Iron and copper deposits of Kasaan Peninsula, Prince of Wales Island, Southeastern Alaska, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1090. Copper was discovered at Prince William Sound in 1897. Deposits were associated with pillow basalts alterered to greenstone. The basalts are interbedded with slate and greywacke, faulted, and intruded by granitic rocks. The principal mines were the Beatson-Bonanza mine at Latouche and the Ellamar mine, which accounted for 96% of the copper produced. Other mines were the Midas mine near Valdez, the Threeman mine, and the Fidalgo-Alaska mine at Port Fidalgo, Alaska. Mining began in 1900, and continued until 1930. Total production was 96,000 tonnes of copper.Fred H. Moffit and Robert E. Fellows (1950) Copper Deposits of the Prince William Sound District, Alaska, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 963-B. Historically, the largest copper mining district in Alaska was the Nizina district, the principal mines of which (Erie mine, Jumbo mine, Bonanza mine, Mother Lode mine, and Green Butte mine) were at Kennecott, Alaska, four miles north of McCarthy. The copper is present as chalcocite in veins and irregular replacements in the Triassic Chitistone Limestone. Some silver was also produced as a byproduct.Don J. Miller (1946) Copper Deposits of the Nizina District, Alaska, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 947-F. The mine at Kennecott gave rise to Kennecott Copper Corporation, which outlasted the mine, and is still a major mining company. The deposit was discovered in 1900, and once a railroad connection was built, the mine operated from 1911 to 1938, after which Kennecott became a ghost town. The town is now a National Historic Landmark. The Pebble Mine is a proposed copper-gold-molybdenum mine. The deposit is a large porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum deposit, and if developed would be a major producer of those metals. =Arizona= The Morenci Mine currently produces the most copper of any mine in North America. Azurite- Malachite specimen from Bisbee, Arizona Arizona has been a major copper producer since the 19th century. In 2006 Arizona was the leading copper- producing state in the US, producing a record $5 billion worth of copper.Arizona Mining Association: Copper, the star of Arizona , accessed 6 April 2009. Over 60% of the newly mined copper in the U.S. comes from Arizona. When copper traded for an average of $3.30/pound, copper production generated nearly $5 billion for Arizona's economy in 2006 and $5.5 billion in 2007. The first mineral to be mined in Arizona was, as in many other regions, gold. Silver was also prominent, in the cities of Tubac and Superior. However, Arizona would most prominently be known for its copper, which would eventually become known as one of Arizona's Five C's or resources.COPPER: THE FOUNDATION OF AMERICA'S 48TH STATE The first copper strike by an Anglo was by Henry Clifton, in the area now known as Clifton, in 1864. No claim was staked there because of threat of Indian attack. In 1870, Robert Metcalf staked a claim there, then sold controlling interest to Henry and Charles Lesinsky. They later formed the Longfellow Copper Mining Co. in Las Cruces, New Mexico. They set up camp and called it Clifton. Clifton later became one of the largest copper mining communities of Arizona. This new use of copper resulted in the boom of one of Arizona's greatest resources. By 1910 Arizona produced more copper than any other state in the nation. It would eventually fuel many of its political struggles as well. The Bisbee and Jerome Deportations in 1917 represent how factory workers and factory owners were pitted against each other.Bisbee, Arizona library At Mule Canyon, south of Tombstone, Arizona, in 1877, a soldier chasing Apache Indians found copper at Bisbee. The Copper Queen Mine and neighboring Atlanta Claim became the Warren District. With the great contribution of the Warren District, Arizona led the nation and still leads it in copper production. The United Verde copper mine at Jerome, Arizona, was financed by eastern capitalists. However, the rich surface ore soon played out. W. A. Clark, who had obtained his fortune at Butte, purchased 99% of the stock of the United Verde Mine. Ultimately it yielded copper, silver, and gold totaling $410,000,000. W. A. Clark was the owner of the richest, individually owned copper mine in the world. After the mines closed Jerome was reborn as an artist community. 12 active copper mines in Arizona directly employ nearly 10,000 workers, not including contractors and sub- contractors. Half of Arizona's copper is mined in Morenci. An additional nine copper mines are expected to begin production in the coming years. The Resolution Copper Project, near Superior, is expected to provide 25% of the U.S. demand for copper after it begins production.Arizona Geology: Blogspot =California= Copper was first discovered in California in 1840, in Los Angeles County. The mine, at Soledad, produced a small amount of copper in 1854.Horace J. Stevens (1909) The Copper Handbook, v.8, Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, p.176. The Napoleon mine at Copperopolis in Calaveras County opened in 1860, and was so productive that it ignited a boom in other copper- mining properties from 1862 to 1866. The boom stimulated development of copper mines along the Foothill copper belt, a 250-mile long zone of copper deposits in the Sierra Nevada foothills, running from Butte County in the northwest to Fresno County in the southeast. Production nearly ceased after 1868 when the shallow oxidized ore was exhausted, and the deeper sulfide ores were found to be poorer in gold and silver.A. Robert Kinkel and Arthur R. Kinkel Jr. (1966) Copper, in Mineral Resources of California, California Division of Mines and Geology, Bulletin 191, p.141-144. The Foothills belt yielded 91 thousand tonnes of copper and 23 thousand tonnes of zinc. Most California copper production came from the West Shasta district in northern California. Gold prospectors discovered the copper deposits of Shasta County in 1848, but no metal was produced until 1879, when some silver was produced from the Iron Mountain Mine. The copper was in massive sulfide deposits in the Devonian Balaklala Rhyolite. The principal mines were the Iron Mountain Mine, Mammoth Mine, and the Balaklala Mine. Copper production began in 1894, and continued off-and-on until 1976. Total production was 320 thousand tonnes of copper, 93 million pounds of zinc, 36 million troy ounces of silver, and 520,000 ounces of gold. The district also produced pyrite for sulfuric acid.Bruce Geller, West Shasta, California, Mining Record (Denver), 27 July 1983, p.4. The Island Mountain mine in Trinity County operated from 1915 to 1930, and produced 4100 tonnes of copper, 140,000 ounces of silver, and 8,600 ounces of gold. The orebody is a massive sulfide deposit of pyrite, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite along a shear zone in the Franciscan Formation.Fenelon F. Davis (1966) Economic Mineral Deposits in the Coast Ranges, in Geology of Northern California, California Division of Mines and Geology, Bulletin 190, p.320. At the northern end of the Sierra Nevada, in Plumas County, the Walker, Engels, and Superior mines together produced more than 140 thousand tons of copper.William B. Clark (1966) Economic mineral deposits of the Sierra Nevada, in Geology of Northern California, California Division of Mines and Geology, Bulletin 190, p.209. The Engels Mine produced 117 million pounds of copper ore and was the largest copper mine in California. The Pine Creek mine near Bishop in Inyo County produces some copper as a byproduct of tungsten mining. =Connecticut= Connecticut is home to the first successful copper mining by Europeans in what is now the United States.The Higley Copper and Copper Mining in Connecticut - Geology.com A copper deposit was discovered in the present town of East Granby, Connecticut in 1705, and German metallurgists from Hanover were imported to reduce the ore to copper metal.James A. Mulholland (1981) A History of Metals in Colonial America, University, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, p.43-45. The mine was shut down in 1725, and the property served as a prison from 1773 to 1897.New Gate Prison - East Granby Historical Society =Maine= Copper mines operated in Hancock County near Blue Hill and Sullivan, from 1877 to 1884.Horace J. Stevens (1909) The Copper Handbook, v.8, Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, p.181. The Harborside mine, near Brooksville mined copper and zinc from an open pit from 1968 to 1972. The underground Black Hawk mine near Blue Hill produced copper, zinc, and lead from 1972 to 1977.Mine History - State of Maine =Maryland= Copper mines operated in Maryland from colonial times until the 1850s, in three mining districts. The most productive was in Frederick County, in a belt of chalcopyrite ore in schist and limestone stretching from New London to Libertytown. The most productive mine was the Dolly Hyde mine. Another district contains chalcopyrite, chalcocite, and bornite, in a fault zone that runs 25 miles in slate from Sykesville to Finksburg in Carroll County. The Bare Hills district in northwest Baltimore County contained a copper-bearing vein in hornblende gneiss.Horace J. Stevens (1909) The Copper Handbook, v.8, Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, p.181-182 =Michigan= Native Americans mined copper from small pits on the Keweenaw Peninsula of northern Michigan as early as 3000 BC.James A. Mulholland (1981) A History of Metals in Colonial America, University, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, p.41-42. In the American era, the first successful copper mine, the Cliff mine, began operations in 1845, and many others quickly followed. The last major copper mine in Michigan, the White Pine mine, shut down in 1995, after unsuccessfully applying for a permit to convert the underground mine to an in-situ leaching operation. =Minnesota= Polymet Mining Corp. has proposed a large open-pit copper-nickel mine of its Northmet orebody in St. Louis County, Minnesota. The company has applied with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and with the US Corps of Engineers for the required permits. Present plans call for the mine to produce 72 million pounds (33 thousand tonnes) of copper annually, along with nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium, and gold.\\"Northmet project ahead of the pack in Minnesota polymetallic resource rush,\\" Engineering & Mining Journal, January /February 2008, p.4-6.\\"New Minnesota mining projects remain on track despite economy,\\" Mining Engineering, July 2009, p.31. Franconia Minerals Corp. is exploring three copper-nickel platinum deposits in St. Louis and Lake Counties. Like the Northmet deposit, the deposits are in the Duluth Complex.William R. Yernberg, \\"New projects highlight Minnesota's mining industry,\\" Mining Engineering, July 2008, p.38. \\"New Minnesota mining projects remain on track despite economy,\\" Mining Engineering, July 2009, p.31-32. =Missouri= Missouri has produced small amounts of copper from Franklin, Madison, and other counties since 1837. A copper mine started in 1863 near Cornwall in Madison County.Horace J. Stevens (1909) The Copper Handbook, v.8, Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, p.191. Copper is recovered as a byproduct of lead mining in the Lead Belt of southeastern Missouri. =Montana= The Berkeley Pit, Butte, in May 1984 In 2006, Montana was the fourth-largest copper-producing state in the country. Butte, Montana was once the nation's most prolific copper-mining district. Miners first came to Butte in 1864 to mine placer gold. Hard rock silver mining began in 1874, then rich copper veins were discovered in 1882. The district quickly switched from silver to copper, and by 1887, Butte was the leading copper-producing district in the United States. The Anaconda Copper Mine was the world's most productive copper mine from 1892 through 1903, and intermittently for years thereafter.Horace J. Stevens (1908) The Copper Handbook, v.8, Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, p.1457, 1466 Open-pit mining began at the Berkeley Pit in 1955; the Berkeley Pit has been inactive for years, and continues to fill with acidic water. Through 1964, Butte produced 7.3 million tonnes of copper, 2.2 million tonnes of zinc, 1.7 million tonnes of manganese, 380 thousand tonnes of lead, 645 million troy ounces of silver, and 2.5 million ounces of gold.Charles Meyer and others (1968) Ore deposits at Butte, Montana, in Ore Deposits of the United States, 1933‚Äì1967, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, p.1376. The only remaining active copper mine at Butte is the Continental pit, operated by Montana Resources LLP. Some copper is also produced by Troy unit silver mine in the northwest corner of the state, and by two platinum mines in the Stillwater igneous complex: the Stillwater mine and the East Boulder project.R. McCulloch, Montana, Mining Engineering, May 2007, p.93-95. =Nevada= Drilling blast holes at the Robinson copper mine, Ely. The first commercial copper mining district in Nevada was at Yerington in Lyon County. The Ludwig Mine opened in 1865, but the district produced only modest amounts of copper until a railroad was built to the district in 1911, and a smelter built in 1912 at nearby Thompson. The Anaconda Copper Mine produced from an open pit from 1918 to 1978. The copper ore bodies are contact metamorphic replacement deposits in limestone. Production through 1921 was 39 thousand tonnes of copper. The largest copper producer in Nevada has been the Ely district (also called the Robinson district) in White Pine County. A Native American showed mineralization to prospectors in 1867, and the district started in a small way as a lode gold producer. A railroad link in 1906 made it economically possible to start large scale open pit mining of the large porphyry copper deposits, and the first copper was produced in 1908. Mining was halted in recent years due to low copper prices, but the open pit was reopened in 2004 by Quadra Mining Ltd. In 2007, the mine produced 121 million pounds (55 thousand tonnes) of copper, plus byproduct molybdenum. Newmont's Phoenix mine in Lander County produced 6.2 million pounds (2800 tonnes) of copper in 2007, as a byproduct of gold mining.J.L. Muntean and D.A. Davis, \\"Nevada,\\" Mining Engineering, May 2008, p.105. =New Jersey= New Jersey was the site of one of the first attempts to mine copper in what is now the United States. Copper ore was discovered about 1712 in what is now North Arlington, and the Schuyler Copper Mine extracted ore and shipped it in casks to the Netherlands. The success of the Schuyler mine led to more prospecting and discovery of more deposits.James A. Mulholland (1981) A History of Metals in Colonial America, University, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, p.39. In the 1750s, colonists tried to mine copper at the Pahaquarry Copper Mine in Warren County. The copper occurs as chalcocite, bornite, covellite, cuprite, and malachite, in quartzite of the Silurian High Falls Formation.H.R. Cornwall (1943) Pahaquarry Copper Mine, Pahaquarry, N. J., US Geological Survey, Open-File Report 45-9. =New Mexico= The El Chino is an open-pit copper mine near Silver City, New Mexico The Santa Rita mine in southwest New Mexico was the first copper mine in what is now the western United States. Spaniards began mining copper there about 1800. The district still produces copper, from the large Chino Mine open pit. Native Americans had mined turquoise associated with the copper deposits at present-day Tyrone in Grant County, New Mexico. Modern mining followed the discovery of turquoise and copper by American prospectors in 1870. The first copper was shipped from the Tyrone district in 1879.Elliot Gillerman (1964) Mineral deposits of western Grant County, New Mexico, New Mexico Bureau of Mines & Mineral Resources, Bulletin 83, p.42. Some copper has been produced from three deposits in sandstone of the Triassic Chinle Formation in the Nacimiento Mountains near Cuba, New Mexico. The copper is present as sulfides (most commonly chalcocite) and malachite associated with organic material; some native silver is also present.Lee A. Woodward and others, Strata-bound copper deposits in Triassic sandstone of Sierra Nacimiento, New Mexico, Economic Geology, January -February 1974, p.108-120. New Mexico is currently the nation's number-three copper-producing state. Copper is produced from two large open-pit porphyry copper operations in Grant County: the Chino Mine and the Tyrone mine. Both mines are owned and operated by Freeport-McMoRan. In 2007, the two mines produced 249 million pounds (113 thousand tonnes) of copper, as well as 13 thousand ounces of gold and 209 thousand ounces of silver.S. A. Lucas Kamat, New Mexico, Mining Engineering, May 2008, p.109-111. =New York= A copper mine operated at Canton, St. Lawrence County in the 19th century.Horace J. Stevens (1909) The Copper Handbook, v.8, Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, p.198. =North Carolina= Copper was discovered at the Ore Knob deposit in the northwest part of the state in the early 1850s, and mining began in 1855. The ore is massive sulfide and disseminated ore in mica schist and gneiss, and amphibole schist and gneiss. The principal ore mineral is chalcopyrite, which occurs with pyrrhotite and pyrite, The mine operated until 1883, then worked sporadically until large-scale mining began in 1957. The mine closed for good in 1962. Total production was 31,000 tonnes of copper, 9,400 ounces of gold, and 145,000 ounces of silver.Arthur R. Kinkel Jr. (1967) The Ore Knob Copper Deposit North Carolina, and Other Massive Sulfide Deposits of the Appalachians, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 558. =Oklahoma= Copper was mined at Creta from 1965 to about 1975. The ore 2% to 4.5% copper as chalcocite replacement grains in an 8-inch (20 cm) thick bed of grey shale in the Permian Flowerpot Shale. The ore also carried some silver, as stromeyerite.Hagni, Richard D., \\"The Replacement Character of Copper-Silver Mineralization in the Permian Flowerpot Shale and Wellington Sandstone Formations of Oklahoma\\" - Department of Geology and Geophysics, Univ of Missouri-Rolla - Geological Society of America - March 24, 2003 Copper and silver occur in a sandstone roll-front-type deposit in the Wellington sandstone of Permian age at Paoli, Garvin County, Oklahoma. About 1900, several wagon loads of ore were shipped from the deposit.P.N. Shockey and others, (1974) Copper-silver solution fronts at Paoli, Oklahoma, Economic Geology, v.69, n.2, p.266-268. =Oregon= The leading copper-mining district in Oregon was the Homestead district in Baker County, which produced 6400 tonnes of copper, 35,000 ounces of gold, and 256,000 ounces of silver. The most important mine was the Iron Dyke.R.G. Bowen (1969), Copper, lead, and zinc, in Mineral and Water Resources of Oregon, Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, Bulletin 64, p.123. The Waldo-Takilma district in Josephine County produced 3200 tonnes of copper. Large mines included the Waldo Mine and the Queen of Bronze Mine. The Keating district in Baker County produced 450 tonnes of copper. =Pennsylvania= In 1724 Pennsylvania colonial governor William Keith made the first attempt to mine copper in Pennsylvania. His mine, in York County, failed within a short time. By 1732 the Gap mine in Lancaster County was operating, owned by shareholders including Gouverneur Morris and Thomas Penn. The mine shut down due to water problems about 1755.James A. Mullholland (1981) A History of Metals in Colonial America, University, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, , p.49-50. The mine reopened as a nickel mine about 1850, and produced some byproduct copper along with the nickel until it shut down in 1893.Horace J. Stevens (1908) Copper Handbook, v.8, Houghton, Michigan: Horace Stevens, p.200. =Tennessee= Mining machine parts and tools scattered about the Burra Burra Mine site, Ducktown, Tennessee The Copper Basin, located in the extreme southeastern corner of Tennessee in Polk County, was the center of a major copper-mining district from 1847 into the 1970s. The district also produced iron, sulfur and zinc as byproducts.Maurice Magee (1968) Geology and ore deposits of the Ducktown district, Tennessee, in Ore Deposits of the United States 1933‚Äì1967, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, p.207-241. The copper was discovered in 1843 by a prospector, presumably panning for gold, who found nuggets of native copper. The first shipment of copper ore was taken out on muleback in made in 1847. More than 30 mining companies were incorporated between 1852 and 1855 to mine copper at Ducktown. Development was speeded by a road built in 1853 connecting the area with Cleveland, Tennessee. The first smelter was built in the Ducktown district in 1854. Mining ceased when Union troops destroyed the copper refinery and mill at Cleveland, Tennessee in 1863. Mining resumed in 1866, and continued until 1878, when the mines had exhausted the shallow high-grade copper ores. In 1889, the Ducktown Sulphur, Copper, Gold and Iron Company bought the properties, and began producing copper and iron from the deeper high-sulfide ores, which previous companies were unable to work successfully. The ores were treated by open roasting in which the ore was piled in large stacks with alternating layers of wood, and burned. The method released large quantities of sulfur dioxide, which killed much of the vegetation in the immediate area. Open roasting was replaced by pyrite smelting in 1904, and the smelters began recovering the most of the sulfur in the form of sulfuric acid rather than releasing it to the atmosphere. Froth flotation was added in the 1920s. The Burra Burra Mine in Ducktown is now home to a museum dedicated to the interpretation of the region's copper mining history. =Texas= Texas has never been a major copper-mining state. Small amounts of copper were mined from Permian redbeds in Archer and Foard counties of north-central Texas in the 1860s and 1870s. Copper was produced in connection with silver mining in Culberson County in west Texas from 1885 to 1952. =Utah= Bingham Canyon Mine in 1942 In 2006, Utah was the nation's number two producer of copper. The Bingham Canyon Mine southwest of Salt Lake City has been one of the world's largest copper producers for more than 100 years. The mine, owned and operated by Kennecott Utah Copper (a division of Rio Tinto Group), is a large open pit in a porphyry copper deposit. (The Bingham Canyon Mine and the Chuquicamata copper mine in Chile each claim to be the largest open-pit mine in the world.) It continues to be a major source not only of copper, but also of molybdenum, gold, and silver. The value of metals produced in the year 2006 alone was $1.8 billion.R.L. Bon and K.A. Krahulec, \\"Utah\\", Mining Engineering, May 2007, p.116-120. Bingham Canyon Mine, southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in 2005 Constellation Copper's Lisbon Valley copper mine in San Juan County, southeastern Utah began mining in 2005, and produced its first copper in 2006.Lisbon Valley Copper Mine: Utah, United States - Constellation Copper Corp. The copper deposit is in sandstones of the Dakota Sandstone and Burro Canyon Formation. The primary copper mineral is chalcocite, which is thought to have been deposited from solutions ascending through the Lisbon Valley Fault. Above the water table, chalcocite has been oxidized to malachite, azurite, tenorite, and cuprite.\\"Constellation Copper Corporation: Resource Estimate Centennial Deposit - SRK Consulting - February 2006 - (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document) On November 30, 2007, Constellation announced that it would stop mining in 2008, because of unexpectedly low copper recovery. The company will continue to recover copper by heap-leaching already-mined ore as long as profitable.\\"Constellation stops mining at Lisbon Valley Copper,\\" Engineering & Mining Journal, December 2007, p.10.Peterson, Jodi. \\"Death of a mine\\" High Country News, February 18, 2008 Constellation officially declared bankruptcy and is currently insolvent, but copper mining efforts were resumed in August 2009 under new management with the help of financing from Renewal Capital, a subsidiary of PartnerRe, and has been producing approximately 35,000 pounds of copper a day since the restart. Mining occurs solely in one mid-sized open pit named the Centennial pit, and the primary ores are malachite, azurite, and chalcocite. The mine employs approximately 140 people as of February 2012. CS Mining purchased the assets of the bankrupt Western Utah Copper Company/Copper King Mining Corporation in 2011 and has applied for the required permits to restart the mining at various sites previously held by WUCC. After receipt of the permits, mining and milling activities are expected to start in the second half of 2012 with open-pit mining and flotation mill processing near Milford. At the time the assets were acquired by CS, the measured, indicated and inferred resources were approximately 600 million pounds of copper; plus gold, silver, and magnetite. Utah History to Go: Copper mining, the king of the Oquirrh Mountains =Vermont= A number of copper mines operated in Orange County from 1809 to 1958.Johnsson, Johnny. \\"South Strafford‚Äôs Elizabeth Copper Mine: The Tyson Years, 1880‚Äì1902\\" - Vermont History - Vermont Historical Society - Vol. 70, Nos. 3 & 4; Summer/Fall 2002 - pp. 130‚Äì152. - (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document) At least five copper mines operated along a belt 20 miles long and oriented NNE-SSW. Until the opening of the Michigan copper district in 1844, Vermont was the leading copper-producing state. The ore was chalcopyrite with pyrite and pyrrhotite in sericite schist host rock.Stevens, Horace J. (1908). The Copper Handbook, v.8, Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, p.17. The Elizabeth deposit was discovered in 1793 and started mining in 1809 as the first copper mine in the state; it was also the last copper mine to operate in the state when it closed in 1958.The Legacy of the Elizabeth Mine - The Center for Environmental Health Sciences at Dartmouth - (c/o Dartmouth College) The Elizabeth mine is now a federal Superfund site due to acid mine drainage.\\"Elizabeth Mine Superfund Site Cleanup Alternatives Fact Sheet\\" - EPA - (c/o Dartmouth College) - June 2006 - (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document) =Virginia= The Virginian mining district in Halifax and Charlotte Counties in southern Virginia produced about 750,000 pounds of copper from numerous mines. Copper-bearing quartz veins occur in greenstone schist along a narrow belt stretching four miles NNE-SSW from Keysville on the north to Virgilina on the North Carolina border. The Barnes mine is reported to have produced some copper in the early 18th century, but the major productive era for the district was the late 19th century to 1917.Virginia Minerals, Volume 22-Number 3 - Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy - August 1976 - (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document) The Toncrae deposit near Floyd was mined for iron (from the gossan) from about 1790‚Äì1850. Copper was mined from 1854‚Äì1855, 1905‚Äì1908, and 1938‚Äì1947. The deposit is a massive sulfide, composed mainly of pyrrhotite and magnetite. The main copper ore minerals are chalcocite and covellite.Gilbert H. Espenshade (1963) Geology of some copper deposits in North Carolina, Virginia, and Alabama, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1142-I, p.I36-I41. =Washington= Miner operating a pneumatic drill by candlelight in the United copper mine, Stevens County, Washington, in 1909. The Tubal Cain mine on the Olympic Peninsula operated from 1902 to 1906. The Holden mine, in Chelan County, operated from 1938 to 1957. The townsite is now used as a Lutheran retreat center and is open to the public. The process of cleaning up the remains of the old mine is ongoing. The Chewelah district in Stevens County produced 1.7 million troy ounces (53 tonnes) of silver and 5,000 metric tons of copper from quartz-carbonate veins. Chalcopyrite is the principal ore mineral. The deposits are hosted in shear zones in argillite of the Precambrian Belt Supergroup.Allen V. Heyl and others, Silver, in United States Mineral Resources, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 820, p.594-595 =Wisconsin= Copper was discovered one mile northeast of Mineral Point in Iowa County of southwest Wisconsin in 1837 or 1838. The deposit was mined until 1842, then intermittently through 1875, producing an estimated 680 tonnes of copper.Geology of Wisconsin, v.2, (1877) Wisconsin Geological Survey, p.741. Copper was discovered in 1843 at what became known as the Copper Creek mine near Mount Sterling in Crawford County, southwest Wisconsin. About 5500 pounds (2.5 tonnes) of copper were produced from the deposit between 1843 and 1852.David D. Owen, Report of a Geological Survey of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota, (Phila.: Lippencott, Grambo, 1852) 53‚Äì55 The Plum Creek copper mine, also in Crawford County, was discovered near Wauzeka in the 1850s, and mined in 1860 and 1861. Both the Copper Creek and Plum Creek deposits are in limestone.Geology of Wisconsin, v.4, (1882) Wisconsin Geological Survey, p.69-71. Douglas County, in the northwest corner of the state, was heavily prospected in the 19th century for native copper deposits in Keweenawan-series rocks, similar to deposits found in Keweenawan rocks in Michigan. A number of mines were started, but none proved profitable.Roland Duer Irving (1883) The copper-bearing rocks of Lake Superior, US Geological Survey, Monograph 5, p.251. The copper deposit of the Flambeau mine was discovered in 1969 1.5 miles south of Ladysmith in Rusk County, and produced from an open pit from 1993 to 1997. Total production was 160 thousand tonnes of copper, 3.3 million ounces (100 tonnes) of silver, and 330 thousand ounces (10 tonnes) of gold. Kennecott reclaimed and revegetated the site to specifications of a state-approved reclamation plan, finishing in 1999.Flambeau Reclaimed - Flambeau Mining Company The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources continues long-term vegetation and groundwater monitoring of the site to assure that the reclamation was done successfully.\\"Reclaimed Flambeau Mine\\" - Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources - May 01 2006 =Wyoming= The Encampment district in Carbon County produced 24 million pounds of copper in a brief spurt of activity from 1899 to 1908.Frank W.

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Lancashire until 2018. Brown made his first-class debut in 2006 and his list A debut the following year. Between 2005 and 2007, Brown played 15 Youth One Day Internationals. In 2011, Brown scored his maiden centuries in first-class and list A cricket and debuted for Lancashire in twenty20s. Career =Early career and youth internationals= He was one half of his home town team's youngest opening partnership when he opened on 31 May 2003 for Atherton Cricket Club's First XI.Youth Opens The Way For Atherton 1st XI Brown's career with Lancashire stretches back to 2003, when, as a 15-year-old, he made his Second XI debut in a defeat against Somerset Second XI. In 2005 Brown moved to Northern and helped them to their Premier League championship success that year. He moved again for the 2007 season to Milnrow,Kark Brown leaves Northern for Milnrow following career advice to gain experience as a nominated club professional. Brown has played twelve Youth One-Day Internationals,List of Youth ODI's making a top score of 109 in one such match.England Under-19s vs. India Under-19s He has been awarded the Man of the Match trophy on two occasions for the England Under-19 team, once thanks to a speedy half-century,England Under-19s vs. Malaysia Under-19s and secondly thanks to a one-man batting onslaught in a rain-affected defeat against the Indian Under-19 squad, the match in which he scored his maiden century.England Under-19s vs. India Under-19s On 11 May 2006, Brown made his first-class debut. The match was against Durham University and, alongside veteran Iain Sutcliffe, he opened the batting for Lancashire. He scored 2 and 32. It was the only match Brown played for Lancashire's first team that year. The next year, he made his list a (one-day) debut; playing against Worcestershire on 22 April 2007, he came in at the fall of Lancashire's first wicket and was dismissed for one run. Brown has struggled to cement a regular place in the Lancashire side, and between 2006 and 2009 he played just seven first-class matches, scoring 156 runs with a high score of 40, and five one- day appearances, managing 72 runs with a highest score of 41. Struggling to force his way into Lancashire's batting line-up in 2009 ‚Äì made up of the likes of Tom Smith, Paul Horton, Mal Loye, Mark Chilton, V V S Laxman, and Francois du Plessis ‚Äì Brown was a regular in the top order of Lancashire's second team which progressed to the final of the Second XI Championship and the semi-final of the Second XI Trophy. He played just two first team matches for Lancashire in 2009, scoring 40 runs from 4 innings. In the last innings of England's 2010 Test series against Bangladesh he took a catch standing at wide mid-off claiming the wicket of Mushfiqur Rahim off Steven Finn's bowling, one of many substitute fielding appearances that day. After scoring 56 for Lancashire's first team against West Indies A in a 50-over friendly, Brown make his first 40-over appearance of the season in a Clydesdale Bank 40 group tie against the Unicorns. After Lancashire bowled the Unicorns out for 143 Brown scored a career-best of 65 not out in their run chase which resulted in Lancashire winning with 144/1. In the seven one-day matches Brown played in the 2010 season, he scored 286 runs at an average of 47.66, including his first three half-centuries in the format. =Breakthrough= Playing against Oxford Marylebone Cricket Club University in Lancashire's opening match of the 2011 season, Brown scored his maiden first-class half-century, beating his previous highest score of 40. His innings of 72 was surpassed in the next match when Brown scored 114 against Sussex to help Lancashire to victory in their first match of the 2011 County Championship. During the course of an innings of 85 against Worcestershire in August, Brown passed the landmark of 1,000 first- class runs. Brown batted alongside Steven Croft to win the final County Championship match of the season on 15 September against Somerset and in doing so winning the competition outright for the first time since 1934. The season ended with Brown scoring 795 first-class runs with an average of 31.80 (26 innings), 309 List A runs with an average of 44.14 (9 innings) and 240 Twenty20 runs with an average of 30.00 (9 innings). The performance meant he was named Lancashire's Young Player of the Year, an award for the club's under-24s. On the back of his performances for Lancashire, Brown was included in the 13-man England Development squad. Personal life Brown is an avid supporter of Bolton Wanderers Football Club.

Early life She was born in LiepƒÅja, Courland, in 1898 under the name of Liliya Ginzberg (Lilija Ginzberga), and she lived there until 1914. After studying law in Moscow, she became a member of the Menshevik party. In 1923 she emigrated to Berlin where she married Samuel Estrin. The couple professed to be Mensheviks, then changed to being Leninists and Left Oppositionists. After the Nazis rose to power, in 1933, they moved to Paris. (Her CIA dossier shows that she came directly to Paris from Moscow not from Berlin as she claimed.) In Paris Lilia found work as a secretary for Boris Nicolaevsky at the International Institute of Social History, and she befriended Trotsky's son Lev Sedov, working with him on the Trotskyist journal, Bulletin of the Opposition. She appeared to be the sole support for her husband and his relatives. \\"I work like an ox,\\" she wrote to Natalia Sedova, \\"from early morning to late into the night, and I am content. My job (with the Institute) is interesting. After it, I work for the Bulletin and other (Trotskyite) matters which keep me up until one o'clock at night. At seven in the morning I am up again . . . I need no Sundays, no respite. I am a dynamic person, I need action.\\" When NKVD agents broke into the Institute and stole Trotsky's papers, on 6 November 1936, a number of Trotskyists began to suspect that she, along with Mark Zborowski, were NKVD agents. After Lev Sedov died in a Paris hospital under mysterious circumstances in March 1938, his mistress accused Lilia of being an NKVD agent and causing his death. But Lilia was able to convince Trotsky that both she and Zborowski were the innocent victims of NKVD slanders. United States After moving to the United States, Lilia married David Dallin, a Menshevik and Russian historian. The defector Alexander Orlov revealed to both of them in 1955 that Mark Zborowski was an NKVD agent, and he suspected that Lilia was also an agent, a theme he repeatedly stressed in his CIA debriefings. Orlov also claimed that David Dallin had been a paid Soviet agent in Berlin in the 1920s, controlled by Boris Bazarov and relaying information to the Soviets from a source inside the German Foreign Ministry. Lilia appeared in March 1956 before a Senate Subcommittee to publicly denounce Zborowski and to describe her role in the Trotskyist faction. In 1972 a CIA historian produced a classified report which dispensed with allegations and named Lilia as an NKVD agent, though no new evidence was revealed in the report which had not otherwise been available twenty years earlier. The CIA declassified the report in 1994. The release of the Venona material exculpated Lilia. She is named in decrypts from May to August 1944, with regard to her involvement in the Victor Kravchenko defection, and a reading of these documents clearly indicates that she was not a Soviet agent.

The Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program treats it as part of the Santorini volcano. The 1650 explosion, which occurred when the accumulating cone reached the surface, sent pyroclastic flows across the sea surface to the shores and slopes of Santorini, where about seventy people and many animals died. A small ring of white pumice that formed was rapidly eroded away by wave action. The volcano collapsed into its caldera, triggering a tsunami that caused damage on nearby islands up to 150 km distant.Ref. University of Rhode Island: Kolumbo; Fouqu√© 1879 The highest parts of the crater rim are now about 10 m below sea level. In 2006, sea floor pyroclastic deposits from the two Aegean explosions were explored, sampled and mapped by an expedition by NOAA Ocean Explorer, equipped with ROV robotics. The crater floor, averaging about 505 m below the sea surface, is marked in its northeast area by a field of hydrothermal vents and covered by a thick bacterial community, the 2006 NOAA expedition discovered. Superheated (measured as hot as 224 ¬∞C) metal-enriched water issuing from the vents has built chimneys of polymetallic sulfide/sulfates to a maximum height of 4 m, apparently accumulated since the 1650 event.

It is based on the 1937 play of the same title by Clifford Odets. Plot Young, promising violinist Joe Bonaparte (William Holden) is in financial difficulties and decides to earn money as a boxer, though he will risk hand injuries. His father, Mr. Bonaparte senior (Lee J. Cobb), wants his son to continue developing his musical talent and buys him an expensive violin for his 21st birthday. But Joe persuades the almost bankrupt manager Tom Moody (Adolph Menjou) to let him try his hand at boxing and wins match after match. When his conscience starts bothering him and he questions his decision to enter boxing, Lorna Moon (Barbara Stanwyck), Moody's girl, is dispatched to convince him to keep fighting. Gangster Eddie Fuseli (Joseph Calleia) tries to get a piece of the action and buys Moody's share, turning the formerly sweet Joe into a hard-hearted boxer. Joe enters the semi-final match against Chocolate Drop (James 'Cannonball' Green) determined to win, but when he knocks out his opponent in the second round, killing him, both his and Lorna's attitudes change. He retires from boxing and returns with Lorna to his father and his music. Cast William Holden and Lee J. Cobb in Golden Boy The cast included: * Barbara Stanwyck as Lorna Moon * Adolphe Menjou as Tom Moody * William Holden as Joe Bonaparte * Lee J. Cobb as Mr. Bonaparte * Joseph Calleia as Eddie Fuseli * Sam Levene as Siggie * Edward Brophy as Roxy Lewis (credited as Edward S. Brophy) * Beatrice Blinn as Anna * William H. Strauss as Mr. Carp * Don Beddoe as Borneo James \\"Cannonball\\" Green plays Chocolate Drop, Joe's final opponent, in an uncredited role. Production In 1938, Columbia purchased the rights to Odets' play for $100,000, intending to produce a film starring Jean Arthur and directed by Frank Capra. Actors considered for the role of Joe Bonaparte included John Garfield, who played Joe in the play, Elia Kazan, Richard Carlson, and Tyrone Power. However, director Rouben Mamoulian expressed interest in Holden after seeing his screen test, and convinced Columbia to purchase 50 percent of Holden's contract from Paramount Pictures. Golden Boy was Holden's first starring role and jumpstarted his career. The producers were initially unhappy with Holden's work and tried to dismiss him, but Stanwyck insisted that he be retained. Thirty-nine years later, when Holden and Stanwyck were joint presenters at the 1978 Academy Awards, he interrupted their reading of a nominee list to publicly thank her for saving his career. In 1982, Stanwyck returned the favor during her acceptance speech for an Honorary Oscar at the 1982 Academy Award ceremony, saying of Holden, who had died in an accident a few months earlier: \\"I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish\\".video: \\"Barbara Stanwyck's Honorary Award: 1982 Oscars\\", Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences via Youtube.com; accessed November 12, 2016.Robert Osborne, \\"TCM ‚Äì Golden Boy\\" via Youtube.com; accessed November 12, 2016. Playwright Clifford Odets was reportedly displeased at the many changes made in the film from his original play, partly due to the Motion Picture Production Code and partly to the rewritten ending. Whereas the play ended with Joe and Lorna deciding to escape their problems and being killed in a car accident, the film closes with Joe and Lorna deciding to return to Joe's home together. The climactic boxing scene was filmed on location at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Accolades The score by Victor Young was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Adaptations On January 7, 1940, Stanwyck performed a parody of Golden Boy on The Jack Benny Program.Jack Benny on the Old Time Radio Network The 1947 film Body and Soul was partly based on Golden Boy. Identification of murder suspect Irving \\"Gangy\\" Cohen, one of the alleged hitmen employed by the Murder, Inc. organized crime syndicate, was identified by chief prosecution witness Abraham Levine when Levine attended a screening of Golden Boy and spotted Cohen in one of the ringside crowd scenes. Following the murder of racketeer Walter Sage in 1937 in the Catskills, Cohen had fled to California and obtained bit parts in films. Cohen was brought to trial and acquitted on June 21, 1940.Big Gangi Cohen Cleared of Murder; Slaying Was One of 57 Laid to Syndicate in Brooklyn, The New York Times, June 22, 1940, p. 34.

Frog jumping contests are held in small communities scattered around the United States, as part of the folk culture. Frog jumping was made famous in a short story \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" by Mark Twain. An event, inspired by the Twain story, has been held annually in Angels Camp, in California's Calaveras County, since 1928, with other events held in Indiana, Ohio, Washington, Maine, Missouri, Louisiana, New York, Wisconsin, and also in Manitoba, Canada. With 4,000 contestants in 2007, the Calaveras County contest has imposed strict rules regulating the frog's welfare, including limiting the daily number of a frog's jumps and mandating the playing of calming music in their enclosures. Entering specimens of the California red-legged frog in the competition, since it is an endangered species, is illegal. (It is also illegal, and likewise considered poor sportsmanship, for any competing frog to be weighted down by any means, as the frog in the Twain story was by the stranger who cheated in the contest as described.) Participants entering the longest-jumping frog were to win a $750 prize, or $5,000 if their frog were to break the 1986 record of , set by \\"Rosie the Ribeter\\".

During his career he accumulated 27 goals and 51 assists for a total 78 points. Giesebrecht was widely regarded by fellow players and NHL coaches as one of the most promising rookies in the league at the time. He scored a hat trick in the first period of the first game he saw on-ice action with the Red Wings, and scored the game-winning goal against the Chicago Black Hawks that advanced the Red Wings to the 1941 Stanley Cup Finals. Despite his early promise, World War II brought Giesebrecht's professional hockey career to an end. He chose to leave the Red Wings, volunteering for the Canadian Army. He was deployed to the European theatre as a corporal in the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division and saw action in France, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. Giesebrecht opted not to return to professional hockey at the conclusion of the war, deciding instead to return to his hometown of Petawawa, Ontario, where he ran his family's business until his death in 2006. Playing career Giesebrecht's junior career began at the age of 16 with the Ottawa St. Malachy's of the Ottawa City Junior Hockey League (OCJHL), with whom he played for the 1933‚Äì34 season, skating in 15 games and scoring 6 goals and 11 assists for 17 points. The following season, he divided his times between the OCJHL's Ottawa Senators, the Pembroke Lumber Kings of the Ontario Valley Junior Hockey League (OVJHL) and the Pembroke Falcons of the Northern Ontario Hockey Association (NOHA). Giesebrecht spent the 1935‚Äì36 season back with the OVJHL's Pembroke Lumber Kings. Giesebrecht broke into the amateur leagues with the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. He skated with the Yellow Jackets for the 1936‚Äì37 season, scoring 12 goals and 18 assists for 30 points in 47 games. He began the 1937‚Äì38 season with the Detroit Pontiacs of the Michigan Ontario Hockey League, with whom he led the league in scoring prior to turning pro. Gus Giesebrecht, left, and Byron McDonald as members of the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets in 1937.Near the end of the 1937‚Äì38 season, Giesebrecht began his professional career with the Pittsburgh Hornets of the International-American Hockey League (IAHL). He returned to the Hornets (then the farm team for the Detroit Red Wings) for the start of the 1938‚Äì39 season. By December 1938 Giesebrecht was being called up to play for the Red Wings. Placed on a line with Hall of Famer Syd Howe, Giesebrecht distinguished himself as a rookie centre for the Red Wings in February 1939 when he scored three goals in the first period in a 7‚Äì3 victory over the New York Americans. He skated in 28 games with the Red Wings that season, tallying 10 goals and 10 assists for 20 points in regular season play. Giesebrecht also joined the Red Wings for the playoffs, netting 2 assists in 6 games. Giesebrecht began the 1939‚Äì40 season with the Red Wings, but found himself sent down to their farm teamthe IAHL's Indianapolis Capitalsafter scoring only 4 goals and 7 assists in 30 games. He tallied 10 goals and 9 assists for 19 points in 21 games during regular season play with the Capitals and skated in 5 playoff games, scoring 4 goals and 1 assist. Giesebrecht returned to the Red Wings for the 1940‚Äì41 season, scoring 7 goals and 18 assists in 43 games, including the opening goal in a 2‚Äì1 victory over the Chicago Black Hawks on \\"Jack Adams Night,\\" a tribute to long-time Red Wings manager Jack Adams. He faced the Black Hawks again in the Stanley Cup semi-final round, scoring the game-winning goal in sudden-death overtime that eliminated the Black Hawks and sent the Red Wings to the finals. They were ultimately defeated by the Boston Bruins in four straight games. The 1941‚Äì42 season again found Giesebrecht splitting his time between the Red Wings and their farm team Indianapolis Capitals (in the newly renamed American Hockey League). He spent the majority of the season in Detroit, netting 6 goals and 16 assists in 34 games, and seeing a 2-game call-up for the Stanley Cup finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Giesebrecht found the championship that had eluded him his entire professional career, however, with the Capitals, scoring 1 goal and 3 assists in 10 games to defeat the Hershey Bears and win the Calder Cup. Giesebrecht's professional career came to an untimely end in 1942 when he volunteered for the Canadian Army during World War II. He served as a corporal in the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, Ordnance Field Park. His unit landed at Normandy one month after D-Day, and saw action in France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Germany. He turned down an offer from Jack Adams to return to the Red Wings at the end of the war, and instead worked at his family business and played senior hockey. Giesebrecht died on December 27, 2006 and was buried in Calvin United Cemetery, Pembroke Ontario.

Within Connecticut, US 5 proceeds north from New Haven and passes through Meriden and Hartford towards Springfield, Massachusetts. US 5 begins at exit 5 of I-91 northeast of Downtown New Haven, heading north through the suburbs of New Haven. It crosses the Quinnipiac River in North Haven, shifting eastward to a different road. US 5 continues north through the town of Wallingford before entering the city of Meriden. North of Meriden, it becomes a four-lane divided highway known as the Berlin Turnpike, where a long overlap with Route 15 also begins. US 5 continues through the southern suburbs of Hartford along the Berlin Turnpike, shifting just south of the city line to the Wilbur Cross Highway, a limited access highway. The Wilbur Cross Highway bypasses downtown Hartford and crosses the Connecticut River on the Charter Oak Bridge into East Hartford. From here, US 5 exits the Wilbur Cross Highway and runs along a four-lane, divided surface road to South Windsor before returning to a two-lane road the rest of the way to the Massachusetts state line in Enfield. US 5 roughly follows the route used by the Upper Boston Post Road, an early colonial highway for transporting mail between New York City and Boston. The route was first improved in 1798 as the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike, which ran in a nearly straight line between the court houses of New Haven and Hartford. In 1922, the Upper Boston Post Road corridor was designated as Route 2 of the New England road marking system, crossing to the east of the Connecticut River in Hartford before continuing north to the Massachusetts state line. In 1926, Route 2 was redesignated as U.S. Route 5. Several realignments have been made in the cities of New Haven and Hartford with the opening of several expressways in these areas. Because it is closely paralleled by Interstate 91 between New Haven and Hartford, US 5 serves mainly as a secondary route today. Route description =New Haven County= US 5 begins on State Street at exit 5 of Interstate 91 in New Haven. State Street continues southwest into downtown as a local, unnumbered street. US 5 starts out as an undivided four-lane road becoming two lanes just before crossing into Hamden. State Street continues north through Hamden and the industrial section of North Haven, closely paralleling the Amtrak railroad tracks on the west side of the Quinnipiac River. It has an interchange with Route 40 in this area. US 5 then turns right at the intersection with Bishop Street in North Haven and crosses the Quinnipiac River, the railroad tracks, and I-91 (at exit 11) overlapped with Route 22 on a four-lane wide road. The bridge ends at a four-way intersection where US 5 turns left on Washington Avenue, Route 22 continues straight on Clintonville Road, and Route 103 begins on the right along Washington Avenue. The four-lane Washington Avenue runs through the commercial areas of North Haven still paralleling the railroad tracks, crosses under I-91 (at exit 12) and continues into Wallingford as South Colony Street. At the town line is the Wharton Brook State Park just north of which is a short expressway connector (Wharton Brook Connector) to I-91 (at exit 13). South Colony Street narrows to two lanes within the Wallingford town center. After crossing Center Street (Route 150) near the Wallingford train station, the road becomes North Colony Street and heads out of the town center. The road crosses Route 68 at a grade- separated junction about two miles (three km) later, followed by a series of junctions about half a mile (0.8 km) apart each: an interchange with the Wilbur Cross Parkway (at exit 66), a split to the left where Route 71 begins and a merge from the left where Route 150 ends. South end of the overlap between Route 15 and US 5. US 5 is signed as an unnumbered exit indicating \\"To I-691, Route 66 At the merge with Route 150 just before the town line, US 5 then follows South Broad Street (the alignment of the old Hartford and New Haven Turnpike) into the city of Meriden. South Broad Street becomes Broad Street after the intersection with Hall Avenue as it passes by the eastern part of the city, avoiding the downtown area. Past Olive Street, the road becomes divided with a wide grassy median. At the north end of the divided section, it has an intersection with East Main Street, the main east-west business route through the city. About north of East Main Street, US 5 has an interchange with I-691 (at exit 8). At the intersection with Brittania Street, the road becomes North Broad Street, which climbs up on a slope as it meets with the north end of the Wilbur Cross Parkway. The northbound roadway overpasses the Parkway and then merges onto it from the right. This is the beginning of a overlap with Route 15. Southbound at the beginning of the Parkway, US 5 is signed as an exit (with no number) from the main roadway. North Broad Street continues north from the merge as a divided 4-lane arterial road for another up to the Berlin town line, where the road becomes the Berlin Turnpike. =Hartford County= North end of the Route 15-US 5 overlap on the Wilbur Cross Highway US 5 and Route 15 run for along the Berlin Turnpike within the towns of Berlin, Newington, and Wethersfield. The Berlin Turnpike is mostly a four-lane divided arterial road with some six-lane sections and is the alignment of the old Hartford and New Haven Turnpike. In Berlin, it has an interchange with the Route 9 expressway. In Wethersfield, Routes 5 and 15 leave the Berlin Turnpike to travel along the Wilbur Cross Highway, an expressway bypass along the south of downtown Hartford. The Wilbur Cross Highway runs through Wethersfield and Hartford, then crosses the Connecticut River into East Hartford on the Charter Oak Bridge. Just prior to the river crossing in Hartford, the Wilbur Cross Highway runs parallel to and interconnects with I-91 near the vicinity of Brainard Airport. Just after the crossing, US 5 exits from the Wilbur Cross Highway on exit 90, ending the long overlap with Route 15. US 5 continues north to East Hartford center along Main Street. From East Hartford northward to the Massachusetts state line, US 5 runs along the east bank of the Connecticut River. Main Street in East Hartford is mostly a 4-lane divided highway. It crosses under I-84 about north of the split with Route 15 with access to the westbound direction only. Main Street continues through the town center, intersecting (and briefly overlapping) U.S. Route 44. North of the town center, US 5 leaves Main Street to go on Ellington Road (via a short segment of King Street) until the South Windsor town line, where the road becomes known as John Fitch Boulevard (still a four-lane divided arterial road). About half a mile (0.8 km) further north, US 5 has an interchange with I-291 (at exit 4) that also includes access to Route 30, the main road to the South Windsor town center. John Fitch Boulevard continues through the rest of South Windsor, passing through the village of East Windsor Hill near the East Windsor town line. After crossing into the town of East Windsor, the roadway becomes two lanes wide with auxiliary left turn lanes and is known as South Main Street. It intersects with Route 191 (Phelps Street), which leads to the East Windsor town center. About half a mile (0.8 km) north of this junction, US 5 leaves Main Street to go on Prospect Hill Road, bypassing the Warehouse Point area. There is also a partial interchange with I-91 in this area (at exit 44). Just south of the Enfield town line, US 5 intersects with Route 140, which crosses the Connecticut River into the town of Windsor Locks and Bradley International Airport. In Enfield, the road becomes known as King Street, crossing over I-91 with a full interchange (Exit 46). As it approaches the town center, the road becomes known as Enfield Street. It has a grade-separated intersection with Route 190 in this area. Just before going across the state line, US 5 crosses over I-91 again (at exit 49) and becomes Longmeadow Street as it enters the town of Longmeadow, Massachusetts. History The Upper Boston Post Road was established in 1673 between New York and Boston via New Haven, Hartford, Springfield, and Worcester. From New Haven to Hartford, it ran at various times via Middletown (now roughly Route 17 and Route 99) and via Meriden (now very roughly US 5). North of Hartford, the road remained on the west side of the Connecticut River, following the general path of present Route 159.S. Jenkins, The old Boston Post Road, (G.P. Putnam and Sons, New York and London, 1914) Along this route between New Haven and Hartford, the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike was chartered in 1798 and opened in 1799, beginning at Grove Street in New Haven and leaving on Whitney Avenue, passing via Meriden and Berlin, and entering Hartford on Maple Avenue. This was one of the first turnpikes to be built on a straight line rather than along existing roads.Frederic James Wood, The Turnpikes of New England and Evolution of the Same Through England, Virginia, and Maryland, 1919, pp. 349-351, 386-387 In the 1910s, Connecticut and Massachusetts adopted a system of marking major roads by colors. The route from New Haven to Springfield, crossing the Connecticut River at Hartford, was marked with blue bands, signifying a major north-south route. This route crossed the Quinnipiac River in New Haven, heading north along an old road (now Route 103 and US 5) to Tracy, crossing the turnpike and running through downtown Meriden on Old Colony Road, Cook Avenue, and Colony Street. It then used the turnpike alignment from Lamentation State Park into Hartford. From East Hartford north to Springfield, another older road was used.Porter E. Sargent, A Handbook of New England, 1916, pp. 65, 106-130 New England Route 2 shield When the New England road marking system was adopted in 1922, Route 2 was assigned to a route from New Haven north via Hartford and Springfield towards Sherbrooke, Quebec. This route followed the older blue-banded route from New Haven north to Hartford. At Hartford, Route 2 crossed the Connecticut River on the Bulkeley Bridge and ran north from East Hartford to Springfield on the east side of the river.New York Times, Motor Sign Uniformity, April 16, 1922, page 98Rand McNally, Tydol Trails: New England Trails Road Marking System and Color Band Routes, 1922 U.S. Route 5 was designated in 1926 along the Route 2 alignment. Between 1926 and 1932, U.S. Route 5 and Route 2 were co-signed throughout the length of the route.Automobile Legal Association Green Book, 1931/32 edition, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1931) In the 1932 state highway renumbering, the Route 2 designation was removed, leaving only the US 5 designation. Only a small number of changes have been made since then, the most prominent being in the cities of New Haven and Hartford. US 5 initially used Temple Street, Whitney Avenue, Edwards Street and upper State Street in New Haven, beginning at U.S. Route 1 (Chapel Street).Automobile Blue Book, Vol. 1, 1927 (Automobile Blue Books Inc., New York, 1927). By the 1940s, it had been moved onto a bypass of the downtown area, consisting of Edwards Street, Hillside Place, Munson Street, Henry Street, Sherman Avenue, Winthrop Avenue, and Davenport Avenue, ending at US 1 west of downtown. At the time, it still crossed the river on Middletown Avenue; the route leaving to the north on State Street was signed as an alternate route.U.S. Geological Survey, New Haven, 1943/1947 The main and alternate routes were swapped by the mid-1950s, and US 5 was sent down East Street to US 1. (The alternate is now Route 103.) The old bypass became extensions of Route 80 and Route 10,U.S. Geological Survey, New Haven, 1949/1954 but is now unnumbered. The final changes truncated US 5 to I-91 when I-91 opened in 1966 in New Haven,\\"Rte. I-91 opened in to New Haven\\", Hartford Times, 1966-01-06 and relocated US 5 to the new Route 22 Connector across I-91 in North Haven in 1973, leaving the old route on Broadway as unsigned State Road 729.National Bridge Inventory Database: Structure No. 2648 In Hartford, the original alignment of US 5 entered the city on Maple Avenue and made its way to the Bulkeley Bridge via Main Street, Central Row, and Columbus Boulevard. The route was shifted slightly eastward to Wyllys Street and Columbus Boulevard by 1941.Connecticut Department of Transportation, 1941 official highway map The opening of the Charter Oak Bridge and Hartford Bypass on September 5, 1942New York Times, Hartford Opens Charter Oak Span, September 6, 1942, page 30 led to US 5 bypassing downtown Hartford on its current alignment; U.S. Route 5A, an alternate route on the west side of the Connecticut River to Springfield, was extended south along Main Street to the beginning of the bypass.U.S. Geological Survey, Hartford North, 1943/1945 In the early 1940s, several sections of US 5 in the Hartford area were upgraded to four-lane boulevards. The Berlin Turnpike segment was reconstructed as a divided four-lane highway, with several segments also straightened out. In East Hartford and South Windsor, a new four-lane divided highway, John Fitch Boulevard, was also constructed. Both of these roadways opened in 1942. In 1948, Route 15 was designated on the Berlin Turnpike and Hartford Bypass segments of US 5 in order to connect the Merritt Parkway and Wilbur Cross Parkway to the Wilbur Cross Highway, providing a continuous high-speed route between New York and Massachusetts.Larry Larned, Route 15: The Road to Hartford, (Arcadia, 2002) Special designations Many sections of various state highways in Connecticut have commemorative designations for various veterans organizations or groups, as well as military servicemen and Connecticut State Troopers killed in the line of duty. In the case of U.S. Route 5, most of its non-expressway alignment except for the Berlin Turnpike has been given a commemorative designation by the Connecticut General Assembly over the years. The following segments of U.S. Route 5 have such designations: *The portion from the Hamden-North Haven line to Devine Street (SR 720) in North Haven is also known as the \\"Korean War Veterans Chapter 204 Memorial Highway\\". *The portion from Devine Street (SR 720) to Bishop Street in North Haven is also known as the \\"VFW Post 10128 Memorial Highway\\". *The Route 5/22 connector between State Street and Washington Avenue in North Haven is also known as the \\"Officer Timothy W. Laffin Memorial Highway\\". Timothy Laffin was a North Haven Police officer who lost his life in a motor vehicle accident while pursuing a wanted suspect. *South Colony Street in Wallingford, running from the North Haven-Wallingford line to Route 150 in Wallingford center, is also known as the \\"American Legion Shaw-Sinon Post 73 Memorial Highway\\". *South Broad Street from the northern Route 150 junction in Wallingford to the Meriden town line is also known as the \\"VFW Connecticut Ladies Auxiliary Highway\\". *The portion from the I-84 junction in East Hartford to the East Windsor-Enfield line is also known as the \\"Purple Heart Highway\\".

He was the first Cambridge professor to win widespread recognition as a mechanical engineer, and first set the scientific study of vowels on a respectable foundation, but is now best remembered for his extensive architectural writings, including a four-volume treatise on the architecture of the University of Cambridge. Biography Willis was born in London, a grandson of Francis Willis, studied in 1822‚Äì1826 at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, from which he received his B.A., and in 1827 was ordained deacon and priest. In 1828 and 1829 he published two early papers on the mechanics of human speech, namely \\"On vowel sounds, and on reed-organ pipes\\" and \\"On the Mechanism of the Larynx\\". In 1830 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. From 1837‚Äì1875 he served as Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy at Cambridge, and from 1853 onwards he was a lecturer in applied mechanics at the government school of mines. In 1843 Willis became a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute, in 1855 served as vice president of the Paris Exposition, and in 1862 received the Royal Gold Medal in architecture. He died of bronchitis in 1875 at Cambridge, where his papers are archived at the Cambridge University Library. Even before attending college, Willis invented an improvement to the harp pedal and in 1821 published An attempt to Analyze the Automaton Chess Player. He later invented the odontograph (1837) which became widely used, and the cymograph (1841) which did not. In 1841 he published his Principles of Mechanism, and in 1851 A System of Apparatus for the Use of Lecturers and Experimenters in Mechanical Philosophy, as well as many works on medieval architecture and the mechanical construction of English cathedrals, notable for his incisive decompositions of these structures' functional and decorative aspects. He willed his manuscript on the Architectural History of the University of Cambridge to his nephew John Willis Clark who completed it. Willis's theory of vowel production assumed a close correspondence between vowel production and the production of musical notes using an organ: the lung acted as a bellows, the vocal folds acted as the reed, and the mouth cavity acted as the organ pipe. Different vowels corresponded to mouth cavities(/organ pipes) of different lengths, which were independent of the properties or vibrations of the vocal folds(/reed). Willis's 1830 paper \\"On vowel sounds, and on reed-organ pipes\\" is usually given as the reference for this theory, and is often contrasted with Wheatstone's \\"harmonic\\" theory of vowel production. Russell devotes two chapters to the discussion of these two theories in his 1928 book on The Vowel, and Willis and Wheatstone figure prominently in the discussion of vowel theories given by Tsutomu Chiba and Masato Kajiyama in their 1941 book of the same name (Tokyo: Tokyo-Kaiseikan). Confusion with Robert Willis (1799‚Äì1878) The work of Willis on acoustics is often mistakenly attributed to Robert Willis (1799‚Äì1878). This is for instance the case in Beyer's Sounds of Our Times (1998). Sometimes, it is the other way round, and Thierry Mandoul's Entre raison et utopie: l'Histoire de l'architecture d'Auguste Choisy (2008) gives the dates (1799‚Äì1878) for our Willis who worked in architecture.

Early life and work Virz√¨ was born in Livorno, Italy in 1964, as the son of a Sicilian police officer in the Carabinieri and a former singer. After spending his early childhood in Turin in the north of Italy, Virz√¨'s family moved back to Livorno where he grew up in the working class area of \\"Le Sorgenti\\". As a small boy, he started to cultivate his lifelong passion for literature: Mark Twain and Charles Dickens were among his favourite authors and their classic \\"coming of age\\" novels would later serve as a model for his screenplays. As a teenager, Virz√¨'s versatility was already in evidence as he threw himself into writing, directing and acting in plays for drama companies in Livorno. He formed an artistic partnership with his schoolmate Francesco Bruni, who would later become his trusted co-screenwriter. For a time, Paolo attended Literature and Philosophy classes at Pisa University and shot some short films and a few longer features that have since vanished in the annals of time. He then left Livorno for Rome, where he studied screenwriting at the historic Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia film school, graduating in 1987. His teachers included prestigious film director, Gianni Amelio and the screenwriter of some of the greatest Italian movies of all time, Furio Scarpelli: Scarpelli was to play a crucial role in Virz√¨'s life, becoming his mentor and his guide, his \\"maestro\\" in other words. Paolo co-wrote with Scarpelli the screenplay for Giuliano Montaldo‚Äôs Tempo di uccidere, based on the novel by Ennio Flaiano and starring Nicolas Cage. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s, he also co-wrote the screenplays of Turn√® (On Tour) (1990) directed by Gabriele Salvatores, Condominio (1991) directed by Felice Farina and Centro Storico (1982) directed by Roberto Giannarelli. He also worked with the famous Neapolitan writer Raffaele La Capria on a TV movie A Private Affair directed by Alberto Negrin and adapted from the novel Una questione privata (A Private Affair) by Beppe Fenoglio, starring young British actor and star of Room with a View, Rupert Graves. Career Virz√¨ made his directorial d√©but in 1994, with La bella vita, originally titled Dimenticare Piombino (Forgetting Piombino) after the Tuscan city the film is set in. Virz√¨'s first feature film stars Sabrina Ferilli and Massimo Ghini, and tells the story of a love triangle set against the backdrop of the irreversible identity crisis of the Italian working class. The movie was presented at the 1994 Venice International Film Festival and won the Ciak d‚Äôoro prize, the Nastro d'Argento (Silver Ribbon) award and the prestigious David di Donatello Award in the \\"Best New Director\\" category. With this d√©but, Paolo revealed his exceptional talent in directing actors and in mixing drama with humor. In his next film Ferie d'agosto (1995), featuring a stunning cast (Silvio Orlando, Laura Morante, Ennio Fantastichini, Sabrina Ferilli and Piero Natoli), the island of Ventotene sets the scene for a feud between two families on holiday. In this comedy, Virz√¨ reflects on the political revolution that took place in Italy after the introduction of the majority electoral system, Silvio Berlusconi's entry into politics and the subsequent transformation of a country called to choose between one of two opposed political formations. Ferie d'agosto won the David Award for Best Film of the year. Ovosodo (Hardboiled Egg) (1997), named after a neighbourhood in Livorno, is one of Virz√¨‚Äôs most personal films. The lead role is played by Edoardo Gabbriellini, one of the new Italian film talents discovered by Virzi. Despite of its strong ties to local accents and lifestyle, Ovosodo received wide acclaim from critics and audiences alike: the jury of the Venice International Film Festival presided over by Jane Campion, awarded Paolo Virz√¨ the Jury Grand Prix. In 1999, Virz√¨ directed Baci e abbracci (Kisses and Hugs), a blend of fable, social comedy and a Christmas tale √† la Dickens. Yet its most obvious reference is to Gogol‚Äôs The Inspector General that had already inspired Luigi Zampa‚Äôs Anni ruggenti in 1962. Baci e abbracci is an ensemble piece about a group of ex-factory workers who try to start up an ostrich farm in the middle of Tuscany. In this movie, Virz√¨ once again portrays Italian provincial society seduced by the irresistible appeal of modernity. His younger brother, Carlo Virz√¨, who plays the frontman of a band called \\"Snaporaz\\", is in fact the author of the music of several of Virz√¨‚Äôs films and made his own film d√©but in 2006 with L‚Äôestate del mio primo bacio, written and scripted by Paolo. The financial troubles of Vittorio Cecchi Gori, producer and distributor of Virz√¨'s first films, slowed down the making of My Name Is Tanino (2002). Shot between Sicily, Canada and the United States, the shooting of the film was beset with difficulties: the screenplay written by Virz√¨, Francesco Bruni and the writer Francesco Piccolo had to be rewritten several times during the filming to counter financial cutbacks. The main actor was once again a newcomer, Corrado Fortuna, who plays a young man who escapes from his native Sicily to go to the United States in pursuit of the American dream. Virz√¨'s next feature, Caterina va in citt√† (Caterina in the Big City) (2003), is dedicated to Rome, a city loved and hated by the director, with its enthralling discoveries and its bitter set-backs. Young newcomer Alice Teghil plays the part of Caterina, a naive, provincial girl with a candid and disoriented view of the world. The film's young heroine is flung from the quiet town of Montalto di Castro into the Roman labyrinth, because her father ‚Äì a frustrated small town intellectual engagingly played by Italian film and TV star, Sergio Castellitto ‚Äì decides to move to the big city. Margherita Buy won the David di Donatello and the Nastro d'Argento awards for Best Supporting Actress in 2004 in the role of Caterina's mother, while Alice Teghil won the Guglelmo Biraghi award. N (Io e Napoleone) (Napoleon and Me) (2006), adapted from the novel by Ernesto Ferrero, is Virz√¨‚Äôs attempt at combining the Italian style comedy genre, with a historic period piece. The film focuses on the relationship between intellectuals and power and the 19th century plot is peppered with allusions to the present day: the parallel between Napoleon and Silvio Berlusconi is at times quite explicit. N features an international cast starring Elio Germano (assigned his first starring roles by Virz√¨ and winner of Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2010), Monica Bellucci and Daniel Auteuil. Virz√¨‚Äôs next project, the ensemble piece Tutta la vita davanti, is one of his most scathing and bitter films. In this grotesque comedy with its apocalyptic vision of the world of work, the real main issue of the movie set in a call center, is the theme of insecurity: in jobs, in love, in life. The cast sees Isabella Ragonese as the determined and plucky protagonist, Sabrina Ferilli (in an unusual role for her) and Micaela Ramazzotti. The film won a clutch of awards, including the Silver Ribbon and the Italian Globo d‚Äôoro for Best Film, the Ciak d‚Äôoro for Best Film and Best Director, as well as many prizes awarded to the actors of the movie: Sabrina Ferilli (Ciak d‚Äôoro, Silver Ribbon, Globo d‚Äôoro), Isabella Ragonese (Guglelmo Biraghi prize as Best Newcomer of the Year) and Micaela Ramazzotti (Kin√®o Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role). In October 2008, the Annecy Cin√©ma Italien awarded Paolo Virz√¨ the Sergio Leone Award in recognition for his overall career achievement. In August of the same year, Virzi and his film crew returned to his hometown of Livorno to shoot L‚Äôuomo che aveva picchiato la testa, a documentary about local singer-songwriter Bobo Rondelli. The film was produced by Motorino Amaranto, the film production company Virz√¨ founded in 2001. Again with production companies Motorino Amaranto and Indiana Production and once more in Livorno, in 2009 Virz√¨ shot La prima cosa bella (The First Beautiful Thing), released in Italy on 15 January 2010. The film stars Micaela Ramazzotti, Valerio Mastandrea, Claudia Pandolfi and Stefania Sandrelli ‚Äì the protagonist of films such as Bertolucci‚Äôs The Conformist and Pietro Germi‚Äôs Divorce, Italian Style. The film tells the story of the Michelucci family, from the 1970s to the present day: the central character is the stunningly beautiful Anna, the lively, frivolous and sometimes embarrassing mother of Bruno and Valeria. Everything begins in the summer of 1971, at the annual summer beauty pageant held at Livorno‚Äôs most popular bathing establishment. Anna is unexpectedly crowned ‚ÄúMost Beautiful Mother‚Äù, unwittingly stirring the violent jealousy of her husband. From then on chaos strikes the family and for Anna, Bruno and his sister Valeria, it is the start of an adventure that will end only thirty years later. Bruno ends up living in Milan after managing to escape from Livorno and his mother. He will return to his hometown at the end of the film to be at his mother‚Äôs side during her very last days. The film received 18 nominations for the David di Donatello Award in 2010, winning three prizes for Best Screenplay (by Paolo Virz√¨ with Francesco Bruni and Francesco Piccolo), for Best Actress (Micaela Ramazzotti) and Best Actor (Valerio Mastandrea). In July 2010, La prima cosa bella won 4 Silver Ribbon awards: Director of the Best Film of the Year (Paolo Virz√¨), Best Actress Micaela Ramazzotti and Stefania Sandrelli, Best Screenplay Paolo Virz√¨, Francesco Bruni, Francesco Piccolo) and Best Costume Design to the Oscar winner Gabriella Pescucci. The film attended many prestigious international film festivals: Open Roads, New York; Shanghai International Film Festival; Annecy Cin√©ma Italien Film Festival; NICE Italian Film Festival, San Francisco. The European Film Academy shortlisted Paolo Virz√¨ for the Best European Director award. In September 2010, the Italian Film Industry Association (ANICA) selected La Prima Cosa Bella as Italy's Official Academy Award Entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards. On 9 November 2010, La prima cosa bella opened the Cinema Italian style Film Festival in Los Angeles. In January 2011, the film was presented at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. La prima cosa bella was the Italian Oscar nomination as Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards, but it didn't make the final shortlist. In October 2012, Every Blessed Day, his tenth feature film was released in Italy. Loosely based on the novel La generazione by Simone Lenzi (who is also the lead singer and composer of the alternative rock band Virginiana Miller), the film follows the lives of Guido and Antonia, played by Luca Marinelli and the singer-songwriter Thony, and their attempts to start a family. In 2013, Virz√¨ was appointed director of the 31st Torino Film Festival. His tenure was marked by a 30% increase in attendance. In January 2014, Human Capital, Virz√¨'s eleventh feature film was released in Italy. The movie, an adaptation of the novel by the American writer Stephen Amidon, uses the financial crisis as its backdrop but more broadly raises the question of values, monetary and intangible, in the modern world. The film was acclaimed by the public and the critics, but was also the object of controversy when politicians from the ultra-conservative Lega party objected to the portrayal of the Brianza region of northern Italy where the film is set. At the Tribeca Film Festival, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi won Best Actress for her leading role as the high-society housewife Carla Bernaschi. The film went on to receive 19 nominations for the 2014 David di Donatello awards, winning seven, including best film. The film also won a number of other major Italian awards including six Nastri d'Argento, four Ciak d'Oro, and the Globo d'Oro for best film selected by members of the international press. Human Capital was chosen as the official Italian entry for best foreign language film at the 2015 Academy Awards. In 2016, La Pazza Gioia (Like Crazy) was released, with Micaela Ramazzottii and Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi as lead actresses. Virz√¨ described the film as \\"a stroll outside a treatment center for women with issues in the open-air mental asylum known as Italy\\". The film premiered as part of the Directors‚Äô Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, and 400 copies were later distributed in Italian theaters starting from 17 May 2016. Italian critics welcomed it very favorably. Fabio Ferzetti in Il Messaggero, wrote: ‚ÄúOne of this season‚Äôs most beautiful Italian films -and not only this season‚Äôs‚Äù. The critic then praised both the ‚Äúextraordinary alchemy of the protagonists‚Äù who give themselves ‚Äúwithout reservations to the characters, yet always maintain perfect control‚Äù and the script, ‚Äúwhich condenses entire worlds in a single one-liner, offering non-trivial food for thought in the slew of misunderstandings between these two women, who represent two irreconcilable Italies‚Äù.Il Messaggero, Fabio Ferzetti La Pazza Gioia won 5 Nastri d‚ÄôArgento and obtained an impressive 17 David di Donatello nominations, winning five prizes including the Best Film Award and the Best Director Award. In July of the same year, Paolo Virz√¨ started principal photography for The Leisure Seeker, which has completed post-production. His new film, entirely shot in the United States, stars Donald Sutherland and Helen Mirren. It is freely adapted from the eponymous novel The Leisure Seeker by Michael Zadoorian. The script was co-written by Francesca Archibugi, Francesco Piccolo, Stephen Amidon, and Virz√¨ himself. It is the story of Ella and John, of their escape from the care of doctors and their now adult children. He is scatterbrained yet strong, she is full of ailments but razor- sharp ‚Äì they give each other the gift of an adventure on the roads of America, from Massachusetts to Key West, on board their old camper.

There were initially twelve dioceses, rising to fourteen by 380. The term diocese comes from the , which derives from the (Œ¥ŒπŒøŒØŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ) meaning \\"administration\\", \\"management\\", \\"assize district\\", or \\"group of provinces\\". Historical development =Tetrarchy (286-305)= The division of the empire into Praetorian prefectures and dioceses after the first reorganisation under the Tetrarchy. Two major reforms to the administrative divisions of the empire were undertaken during the Tetrarchy. The first of these was the multiplication of the number of provinces, which had remained largely unchanged since the time of Augustus, from 48 at the beginning of Diocletian's reign to around a hundred by the time of his abdication. The multiplication of the provinces was probably undertaken for military, financial, and economic reasons. It brought the governor closer to the cities which were responsible for the collection of taxes. It also limited the power of the governors and the autonomy of the cities. At the same time, the status of the provinces was regularised. Egypt lost its unique status and was divided into three provinces, while Italia was 'provincialised' - the numbered regiones established by Augustus received names and were governed by correctores. The distinction between senatorial and imperial provinces was abolished and hitherto, all governors were appointed by the Emperor. In order to compensate for the weakening of the provinces and to maintain the link between the Imperial centre and the individual provinces, the dioceses were created as a new territorial subdivision above the level of the province. The empire was divided into twelve dioceses. The largest of these, the Diocese of the East, encompassed sixteen provinces. Each diocese was governed by an agens vices praefectorum praetorio (Acting Representatives of the Praetorian Prefects) or simply Vicar (vicarius), under the Praetorian prefect, although some provinces were governed directly by the Praetorian Prefect. These vicars had previously been ad hoc representatives of the prefects, but they were now made into permanent, regularised positions and . The vicar controlled the provincial governors (variously titled as consulares, correctores, praesides) and heard appeals of cases decided at the provincial level (parties could decide whether to appeal to the vicar or the praetorian prefect). The provinces governed by proconsuls (Africa and Asia) remained outside the vicars' jurisdiction,. as did the cities of Rome and Constantinople, which were governed by a Praefectus urbi instead. The vicars had no military powers. Troops stationed in the dioceses fell under the command of a comes rei militaris, who was directly under the control of the magister militum and was in charge of the duces who had the military command of individual provinces. Many modern scholars date the introduction of the dioceses to AD 296-297. A passage of Lactantius, who was hostile to Diocletian because of his persecution of the Christians, seems to indicate the existence of vicarii praefectorum in the time of Diocletian: Thus Lactantius refers to the vicarii praefectorum as being active already in Diocletian's time. Other sources from Diocletian's reign mention one Aurelius Agricolanus who was an agens vices praefectorum praetorio active in Hispania and condemned a centurion named Marcellus to be executed for his Christianity, as well as an Aemilianus Rusticianus, who is considered by some scholars to have been the first vicar of the Diocese of the East that we know of. Lactantius also mentions one Sossianus Hierocles as an ex vicario active in the East in this period. Septimius Valentio is also attested as agens vices praefectorum praetorio of Rome between 293 and 296. However, these sources do not prove that these vicarii or agentes vices were already in charge of dioceses with a well-defined and stable territory. Septimius Valentio in particular was definitely the commander of the Praetorian Guard during a period when the Praetorian Prefect was absent from the city, but was not in charge of Italia Suburbicaria. According to Zuckerman, the establishment of the dioceses should instead be dated to around AD 313/14, after the annexation of Armenia into the Roman empire and the meeting of Constantine and Licinius in Mediolanum.Zuckerman, Travaux et Memoires 14, Melanges Gilbert Dagron, 2002. The matter remains controversial. =Constantinian reforms (326-337)= Emperor Constantine. The administrative division of the empire into prefectures and dioceses. The map shows the western section of Illyricum as part of Italia, which only occurred in AD 395. From 310, Constantine I was one of the Augusti of the Empire and from 324 he was the sole ruler of the whole state. During his reign, he carried out many crucial reforms creating the administrative and military organisation of the empire which would last until the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Regionalisation of the Praetorian Prefectures The principal territorial reform undertaken by Constantine, as part of a process of trial-and-error, was the 'regionalisation' of the Praetorian prefecture. Hitherto, one or two Praetorian prefects had served as chief minister for the whole empire, with military, judicial, and fiscal responsibilities. The political centralisation under Constantine, which culminated in the reunification of the whole empire under his rule, resulted in an \\"administrative decentralisation.\\" A single emperor could not control everything, so between 326 and 337, Constantine progressively transformed the 'ministerial' Praetorian Prefect into a 'regional' Prefect, in charge of a specific territory which contained several dioceses and was called a 'Praetorian Prefecture' ('). These Praetorian Prefects had authority over the Vicars and Provincial Governors. Paul Petit argues that the dioceses \\"themselves prefigured to some degree\\" the regional praetorian prefectures. Thus, the creation of the praetorian prefectures reduced the utility of the dioceses. The direct link between the prefects and the governors bypassed the Vicars and caused their power to decline; they increasingly became agents carrying out the will of the Praetorian Prefects. However, despite their decreased importance, the vicars played an important role in the court hierarchy - Constantine raised them to the rank of clarissimi (between the consulares and the proconsulares). Creation of the  The other reason for the weakening of the vicars was the regular dispatch of comites, who outranked the vicars and probably had the role of inspecting their conduct. Territorial adjustments It was probably Constantine in 312 who transformed the agens vices prefectorum praetorio of Rome, which had been the commander of the troops stationed in the City when the Praetorian Prefect was absent since the Severan period, into the civil vicar of Italia Suburbicaria, as partof his demilitarisation of the City after his victory over Maxentius. Thus, under Constantine, the diocese of Italia was split into the two vicariates of Italia Suburbicaria in the south and Italia Annonaria in the north, under the administration of the vicarius urbis Romae and the vicarius Italiae respectively. Italia Suburbicaria and Italia Annonaria were not de jure dioceses, but vicariates within a single Italian diocese, as the Laterculus Veronensis and the Notitia Dignitatum show. Constantine I also divided the diocese of Moesia into the dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia in 327. Under Emperor Valens (364-378), the Diocese of Egypt was split out of the Diocese of the East. The Notitia Dignitatum indicates that at some point, the Diocese of Gaul was suppressed and incorporated into the diocese of the Septem Provinciae. According to the Notitia Dignitatum, the dioceses of Dacia and Illyricum did not have vicars, but were governed by the Praetorian Prefect of Illyricum directly. Before its suppression, the Diocese of Gaul also seems to have been directly administered by the Praetorian Prefect of Gaul. In fact, according to Jones, the diocese in which each Praetorian Prefect was based was generally under their direct control, except for the Diocese of Thrace, which was administered by a vicarius Thraciarum even though the Praetorian Prefect of the East had his seat in the diocese. The title of vicar was used in all provinces except for the Diocese of the East, which was governed by a comes Orientis and Egypt, which continued to be governed by a Prefect. =Subsequent evolution= The successors of Theodorus made few changes to the administrative subdivisions of the Empire. A few provinces were further subdivided. For example, the provinces of , Galatia, Palestina, and Thebais were split in two. At the beginning of the 6th century, the province of Aegyptus was also split in two. A separate Vicariate of the Long Walls was created in Thrace by Anastasius I (491-518). Fall of the western Roman empire Around the end of the 5th century, the majority of the dioceses of the Western Roman Empire ceased to exist, following the establishment of the Barbarian kingdoms. There is no evidence that the Franks and Burgundians maintained the Roman provincial system; the Visigoths and Vandals did maintain the provinces (governed by rectores or iudices), but not the dioceses or prefectures. In Italia, Odoacer and then the Ostrogothic kings, particularly Theoderic, basically retained the Roman provincial system, including the Praetorian Prefecture of Italia and the two vicariates of Italia Annonaria and Italia Suburbicaria, as well as the various provinces that they contained. When Theoderic conquered Provence in 508, he also re-established a Diocese of the Gauls, which was promotted to the rank of Prefecture with a capital at Arelate two years later. This Praetorian Prefecture was abolished in 536, during the reign of Vitiges, after the cession of Provence to the Franks. The rationale behind Odoacer and Theoderic's maintenance of the Roman provincial system was that they were officially viceroys of the Roman emperor in Constantinople, for whom Italia nominally continued to form part of the Roman empire. The civilian offices, including the vicars, praesides, and Praetorian Prefects, continued to be filled with Roman citizens, while Barbarians without citizenship were barred from holding them. According to Cassiodorus, however, the authority of the vicarius urbis Romae was diminished: in the 4th century, he no longer controlled the ten provinces of Italia Suburbicaria, but only the land within forty miles of the City of Rome. Justinian's reforms Mosaic from the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, depicting Justinian In 535-536, Justinian decided to abolish the dioceses of the East, Asia, and Pontus; their vicars were demoted to simple provincial governors. For example, the comes Orientis (vicar of the East) became the title of the governor of Syria I, while the vicars of Asia and Pontus became governors of Phrygia Pacatiana and Galatia I respectively, with the title of Comes Iustinianus and civilian and military powers. In May 535, Justinian abolished the vicariates of Thrace and the Long Walls, in order to improve the defence of the Long Walls by ending the continuous conflicts between the two vicars. He entrusted the administration of the diocese of Thrace to a praetor Iustinianus with civilian and military powers. A year later, in order to improve the efficiency of provisioning troops garrisoned in Thrace, a new prefecture was introduced, the Prefecture of the Islands, which was governed by a quaestor exercitus (Quaestor of the army) based in Odessa. This prefecture contained the provinces of Moesia II, Scythia Minor, Insulae (the Cyclades), Caria, and Cyprus. In 539, Justinian also abolished the diocese of Egypt, splitting it into five independent circumscriptions (groups of provinces) governed by duces with civilian and military authority, who were direct subordinates of the Praetorian prefect of the East. The Prefect of Egypt, formerly in charge of the whole diocese, was renamed the dux augustalis, and left with control over only the provinces of Aegyptus I and Aegyptus II. Essentially, the modifications to the provincial system carried out by Justinian were motivated by the desire to end the conflict between civilian and military officials, and thus moved away from Diocletian's principle of completely separating civilian and military power. In this, according to J. B. Bury, Justinian anticipated the introduction of the themes in the 7th century. Morevoer, by abolishing the dioceses, Justinian attempted to simplify the bureaucracy and simultaneously decrease the state's expenses, noting that the vicars had become superfluous, since their courts of appeal were used ever less frequently and the provincial governors could be directly controlled by the Praetorian Prefect, by means of the so-called tractatores. Some of Justinian's decisions were subsequently revisited. In fact, thirteen years after the reforms of 535, in 548, Justinian decided to re-establish the diocese of Pontus due to serious internal problems. The vicar of Pontus was also given military powers, in order to effectively oppose the brigands that infested the region. In the same period, five provinces of the former diocese of Asia which had become infested with brigands (Lycaonia, Pisidia, Lydia, and the two Phrygiae), were placed under the jurisdiction of a biocolytes (preventor of violence), in order to maintain order in the region. The jurisdiction of this official was reduced to just Lycaonia and Lydia in 553, since the other three provinces had been pacified. Novel 157 of AD 542, concerning Osroene and Mesopotamia is addressed to the Comes Orientis, suggesting that the northern part of the former diocese of the East remained under the authority of the Comes Orientis in this period. Furthermore, it seems from the fact that a Vicar of Thrace is again attested in 576, it also seems that the diocese of Thrace was revived at some point - perhaps even under Justinian. When Africa and Italia were reconquered, Justinian established Praetorian prefecture of Africa, while the Praetorian Prefecture of Italia returned to Imperial hands after the Gothic War. The whole territory of the Empire in Africa, which had been the Diocese of Africa in the 4th and 5th centuries, was thus promoted to the rank of Prefecture. It was not divided into dioceses. It is unlikely that the Praetorian Prefecture of Italia was subdivided into two vicariates again in the Byzantine period. The authority of the two Italian vicars was definitely much reduced compared to the 5th century.. The successors of Justinian continued his policy of concentrating civilian and military power in the hands of a single individual. Maurice (582-602) transformed the old Prefectures of Italia and Africa into Exarchates governed by an Exarch, who held both civilian and military authority. The vicars and other civilian officials seem to have lost most of their importance to the exarchs and their subordinates, but did not disappear until the middle of the 7th century AD. After 557, there is no record of vicarii in Italia, but two agentes vices of the Praetorian Prefect of Italia with their seats in Genova and Rome are mentioned in Pope Gregory I's letters. These Italian agentes vices are no longer attested after the first half of the seventh century. Disappearance In the seventh century, as a result of the establishment of the first themes (military districts governed by a strategos with military and civilian authority) and the invasions of the Arabs and Slavs, the Praetorian Prefectures of the East and of Illyricum disappeared. The last certain attestation of a Praetorian Prefect of the East is in 629, while Illyricum survived to the end of the 7th century, but without any effective power since the majority of the Balkans, aside from Thessaloniki, had fallen under the Slavs. Thus the Prefect of Illyricum was renamed the Praetorian Prefect of Thessaloniki. In the same period, the dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia finally disappeared as a result of the loss of almost all their territory. However, the Taktikon Uspenskij which was written at the beginning of the 9th century, mentions a Praetorian Prefect of Constantinople and Proconsuls (anthypatoi) of the themes, which suggests that the Praetorian Prefecture of the East continued to exist even though it had lost most of its earlier powers and had only a few judicial functions. If the dioceses lost their fiscal functions during the 6th and 7th centuries, it may be that they were replaced by new groupings of provinces under the judicial administration of a Proconsul (anthypatos). The provinces continued to exist under the themes until the second half of the 9th century. Organisation =Vicars= The vicarius was a high official appointed by the Emperor and accountable only to him. The position was held by equites who were given the rank of perfectissimus (before the egregii and after the eminentissimi).See G. Bloc, L'Empire romain. √âvolution et d√©cadence, Flammarion, Paris, 1922, vol. II, chapter 2. Thus, in rank, the vicars were inferior to the governors of the senatorial provinces (the consulares), although they had to exercise political authority over them. Ren√© R√©mond suggests that this paradox was resolved by promoting vicars whose dioceses contained provinces with senatorial governors to the rank of clarissimus, but there is no evidence for this. Initially, the powers of the vicars were considerable: they controlled and monitored the governors (aside from the proconsuls who governed Asia and Africa), administered the collection of taxes, intervened in military affairs in order to fortify the borders, and judged appeals. They were not under the control of the Praetorian Prefect, but only to the Emperor himself. Appeals of their legal decisions went straight to the emperor. The vicars had no real military role and had no troops under their command, which was a significant novelty compared to the Augustan provincial system. This was intended to separate military and civilian power and thus prevent rebellions and civil wars.

Though his work spanned five decades, he is perhaps best remembered as the creator of the ITV drama series The Gentle Touch (1980‚Äì84). Life and career Feely was born into a middle-class industrial family of Irish descent in Liverpool. After leaving school, he entered Liverpool's Jesuit College where he studied English and psychology. Upon completion of his university studies, he decided to go into journalism, and got a job with a small local newspaper in Middlesbrough. However, he quickly outgrew the publication, and moved to London where he secured a position in the faster-paced world of Fleet Street, joining the editorial staff of the Sunday Graphic. Around this time he began to write submissions for film scripts; film director Alfred Hitchcock purchased the rights to one of his scripts in 1955, entitled Heartbeat. Feely ventured into television in 1959, writing several episodes of the police detective series No Hiding Place. Following this, in 1961 he wrote two episodes for the first series of The Avengers. He then moved on to other popular shows of the time, including The Saint and Thunderbirds. In the mid-1960s he became story editor for Armchair Theatre and Mystery and Imagination, produced by ABC (later by Thames Television). Feely was also instrumental in bringing James Mitchell's Callan to the small screen, for which he is credited as associate producer. He joined the British subsidiary of Paramount Pictures in 1967, and was partly responsible for ensuring the production of If.... (1968), directed by Lindsay Anderson. Following this, Feely went on to become a co-director of Everyman Films (with Patrick McGoohan and David Tomblin). The company's principal production was allegorical/science-fiction series The Prisoner (1967‚Äì68), for which Feely also wrote two episodes. In the 1970s he worked on shows such as The Persuaders!, Arthur of the Britons, The Protectors, UFO, Space: 1999, Thriller, Within These Walls, and The New Avengers. He also adapted the Henry James novel Affairs of the Heart for television in 1974. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he also wrote episodes for the BBC detective series Shoestring and Bergerac, as well as episodes of The Dick Francis Thriller: The Racing Game for ITV. However, the series for which Feely is perhaps best remembered is the ITV police drama The Gentle Touch, which he created and for which he wrote several scripts. The series was a ratings hit, running for five seasons from 1980 to 1984, and was the first British police series with a female lead character (Det. Inspector Maggie Forbes, played by Jill Gascoine). In 1985, Feely created the Gentle Touch spin-off series C.A.T.S. Eyes, about a team of female private investigators who covertly work for the British Home Office, which ran until 1987. Also in the 1980s, he co-wrote the screen adaptation of Judith Krantz's novel Mistral's Daughter, which was produced as a US television mini-series in 1984, as well as adapting two of Barbara Cartland's novels for television: A Hazard of Hearts in 1987, and The Lady and the Highwayman in 1989. Aside from his work as a screenwriter, Feely also penned several novels including Number 10: Private Lives of Six Prime Ministers, which also became an acclaimed drama series in 1983. One of his last novels, Limelight, was awarded New York's Book of the Year prize. Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London Feely died on 13 August 2000, aged 72.

Club career Dunn, born in Glasgow and nicknamed \\"ginger\\" due to the colour of his hair, started his senior career in 1920 when Hibernian signed him from his local Junior side St Anthony's. He stayed eight years with the Edinburgh club (304 matches, 103 goals in the Scottish Football League and Scottish Cup) helping them to consecutive Scottish Cup finals in 1923 and 1924, although he collected a runners-up medal on each occasion. Dunn joined Everton immediately after his Wembley escapades and played with the Merseyside club for the next 7 seasons. He won a Second Division championship and Football League championship with the Toffees in consecutive seasons (1931 and 1932) and was part of their FA Cup winning side of 1933, scoring in the final itself. After scoring 49 goals in 155 matches for Everton, he left Goodison Park in 1935 for Exeter City, becoming the Grecians record signing in the process. He joined Runcorn the following year before retiring into a coaching role. International career In 1925, Dunn earned his first selection for the Scottish national team, playing in a 3‚Äì1 defeat of Wales at Tynecastle. He gained a further 4 Scotland caps while with Hibs, the most memorable being the last, against England at Wembley in 1928. Dunn was a late inclusion in the side for the British Home Championship match, having missed selection for the preceding international trial match between home-based and Anglo-Scots. The entire Scotland forward-line measured 5 foot 7 or less and it was widely expected that the bigger, stronger English side would overpower their Scottish opponents. Dunn and his colleagues thought otherwise and raced to a surprise 5‚Äì1 victory, a record Scottish win at Wembley. The victory was widely celebrated in Scotland and the team was later somewhat mythologised as the Wembley Wizards. While at Everton, Dunn gained one further cap, again against Wales.

Founded in 2000, it is a member of Vanderbilt Student Communications. Originally published only online, The Slant published a new print edition monthly during the school year April 2016, after which it switched back to an online format. As a print publication, the magazine distributed approximately 60,000 total copies on campus throughout the year. Pranks The magazine's content and staff pranks have often led to controversy at Vanderbilt. On March 11, 2003, The Slant ran a complete mock-up of The Vanderbilt Hustler entitled The Vanderbilt Huslter, with the headline \\"GEE DEAD,\\" referring to then-Vanderbilt Chancellor Gordon Gee. The hoax received some attention from national media, including an appearance on the Drudge Report. Gee's office responded to the hoax by releasing a photo of him holding a copy of the fake issue (with Gee smiling). Despite Gee's good humor about the prank, the ensuing controversy led to the removal of The Slants editor-in-chief from his post for inappropriately expropriating the Hustler's news racks in violation of Vanderbilt Student Communications regulations. Gee discussed the hoax in his 2003 commencement speech and even Laura Bush mentioned the prank in her commencement speech in 2006. In the spring of 2006, The Slant created a fake poster for Rites of Spring, Vanderbilt's annual outdoor music festival. The posters, hung around campus, falsely claimed that Ben Folds would be headlining the festival. The Hustler published the erroneous news as fact and was then forced to retract the announcement in its next issue. In an ironic twist, Ben Folds, who had previously been approached by Rites planners and was apparently unaware of the prank, soon thereafter agreed to headline the festival, forcing the Hustler to once again announce a Ben Folds-anchored lineup. On Friday, November 16, 2007, the final day before Thanksgiving Break, Slant staff members placed signs on the doors of dozens of classrooms across campus, informing students that their respective classes would instead be meeting in the Furman lecture hall for the day. As students from several different classes confusedly entered the same room, they were greeted with a breakfast of doughnuts, orange juice, and a screening of A Charlie Brown Christmas. On Thursday February 5, 2009, The Slant ran a second The Vanderbilt Huslter, this time with a headline reading \\"Goodbye Greek life: Greek Life to be Kicked off Campus in Fall 2010\\". Although coming out on a Thursday, a day on which The Hustler does not usually print, and being put in The Slant newspaper racks, the paper still fooled many students. Unlike its last issue, no one was fired over the issue of \\"The Huslter\\" put out under editor-in-chief Brendan Alviani. There were several clues in the 2009 version of The Huslter, including several obviously ridiculous stories, \\"Thes Lant\\" being announced as a possible opener for Vanderbilt's annual \\"Rites of Spring\\" music festival, the Slant editorial staff's presence on the editorial board, fake advertisements, and a straight out admittance on page 4 in the opinion section's \\"Verdict\\": \\"As you may have guessed by now, the Slant published a DAMN good Hustler.\\" Overall the issue was well received and although some members of the Greek community were upset, most people appreciated the humor.

It is situated at , some 702 metres above sea level. The municipality has an approximate population of just over 2,000.. The town sits in the Sierra de Mont√°nchez, a small mountain range rising above the plains of Extremadura. Its elevated position has earned it the nickname \\"the balcony of Extremadura\\". The town's economy relies principally on agriculture. It is one of the main centres in Spain for the production of jamon iberico, and also produces wine. History Although there is evidence of prehistoric settlement, , the first major residents were the Romans, who founded the town in the 1st century AD. Moorish invaders captured the town in 713, taking advantage of its strategic location in the mountains to build a castle, which still dominates the village today. The town reverted to Christianity in 1230, when it was taken by Alfonso IX. The castle was updated at this time, but continued to form an important defensive line.

Upbringing and family Morrison was the son of an innkeeper from Middle Wallop in Hampshire. He married Mary Anne, daughter of Joseph Todd, a London draper business and quickly made it one of the most profitable in the world. His children included Alfred Morrison, a notable art collector (see The Morrison Triptych), who was High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1857; Charles of Basildon Park and Islay; Alfred of Fonthill (Wiltshire), the father of Major James Archibald Morrison of Fonthill and Basildon; Frank of Hole Park (Kent) and Strathraich (Ross); and Walter of Malham Tarn, (Yorkshire). The politician James Morrison, son of Alfred, was a grandson. Career Morrison began his career working in a London warehouse. Effort eventually secured him a partnership in the general drapery business in Fore Street, London of Joseph Todd, whose daughter he married. The firm became known as Morrison, Dillon & Co, and later was converted into the Fore Street Limited Liability Company. Morrison worked to small margins, with a rapid circulation of capital, his motto being \\"small profits and quick returns\\". He made a fortune, much of which went to buying land in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Wiltshire, Yorkshire, and Islay in Argyllshire, an island he purchased for nearly ¬£¬Ωm in 1854. In his Life and Correspondence, Robert Southey records how he saw Morrison at Keswick in September 1823. He was then worth some ¬£150,000 and was on his way to New Lanark on the Clyde. He intended investing ¬£5,000 in Robert Owen's philanthropic community \\"if he should find his expectations confirmed by what he sees there\\". From his arrival in London, Morrison was associated with the Whig Party in the city. In 1830, he entered Parliament as member for St Ives Cornwall, which he helped to partially disfranchise by voting for the Great Reform Bill. In 1831, he secured a seat at Ipswich, for which he was again elected in December 1832. He was, however, defeated there on the 'Peel Dissolution' in January 1835. On an election petition, Fitzroy Kelly and Robert Adam Dundas, the members, were unseated and Morrison, with Rigby Wason, headed the poll in June 1835. At the succeeding dissolution, in July 1837, Morrison remained out of parliament and, in the following December, on the occasion of a by-election for a vacancy at Ipswich, he was defeated in a contest with Joseph Bailey. In March 1840, he re-entered the House of Commons as member for the Inverness Burghs and was again returned unopposed in the general election of 1841 but, on the dissolution of 1847, in poor health, he finally retired. In the 1830s, Morrison established the American trading company, Morrison, Cryder & Co., and invested heavily in the railway industry both in the United States and in France. On 17 May 1836, he made an able speech on moving a resolution urging the periodical revision of tolls and charges levied on railroads and other public works. In 1845, he moved similar resolutions and, again in March 1846, when he finally succeeded in obtaining a select committee for the better promoting and securing of the interests of the public in railway acts. His draft report, not altogether adopted, was drawn with great skill and many of its principles were adopted in subsequent legislation. An entirely self- educated man, Morrison built up a large library. He was likewise collected pictures by the Old Masters, Italian and Dutch, together with the English school of painters. It was a \\"collection of a very high class\\". Morrison housed his collection in his London house in Harley Street, and at Basildon Park in Berkshire which, by 1842, had completely replaced the Pavilion at Fonthill (Wiltshire) as his favoured country estate. It included works by Constable, Da Vinci, Hogarth, Holbein, Poussin, Rembrandt, Reynolds, Rubens, Titian, Turner, Cuyp, Jan Steen, Murillo and Van Dyck.

This lactam was first synthesized by Iwao Ojima. The organic synthesis is an illustration of asymmetric synthesis via a chiral auxiliary. The reaction centers around an imine - lithium enolate cycloaddition. In order to ensure the correct stereochemistry (the phenyl group and the silyl ether must adopt a cis configuration) in the Œ≤-lactam a chiral auxiliary is used in the enolate synthesis. The enolate synthesis starts from glycolic acid. The hydroxyl group is protected by a benzyl group and the carboxylic acid is activated by reaction with thionyl chloride to the acid chloride. The acid chloride reacts with the chiral auxiliary trans-2-phenyl-1-cyclohexanol. The benzyl group is then removed and replaced by a TES silyl ether by reaction with triethylsilyl chloride. Reaction with phenyllithium affords the enolate. Ojima lactam I The imine synthesis is a reaction of hexamethylene silazane with phenyllithium to a strong amide base followed by a condensation reaction with benzaldehyde. Ojima lactam II Both imine and enole intermediate join in a cycloaddition reaction followed by an intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution of the amine with expulsion of the chiral auxiliary to the cis-lactam.

Thomas Jones (1810 - 16 September 1849) was a Welsh Christian missionary, who worked among the Khasi people of Meghalaya and Assam in India and of Bangladesh. He recorded the Khasi language in Roman script, and the inscription on his gravestone calls him \\"The founding father of the Khasi alphabets and literature\\". In 2018, the state government announced that 22 June, the date of Jones's arrival at Sohra, would be celebrated as \\"Thomas Jones Day\\" every year in the state of Meghalaya. Biography Thomas Jones, born in 1810, was a carpenter's son from Berriew (Aberriw), Montgomeryshire, Wales. He became a Calvinistic Methodist minister in 1840 and shortly afterwards set out for India, with his wife Anne. After their arrival in Calcutta, Anne gave birth to a child, who did not survive. The couple went on into the Khasia Hills, Meghalaya, with the aim of converting the Khasi people to Christianity. Thomas Jones succeeded better than the missionaries whom William Carey had sent to the hills in the 1830s. Jones's skills in carpentry and other crafts were valued by the Khasi community, and he learned their language by living among them. He opened a missionary school, and began preaching to the local people in their own language, with such fluency that they could not but marvel. In 1842 he produced a Khasi Reader, and translated a Welsh-language work, Rhodd Mam, into Khasi; these were the first books written in the Khasi language. He also compiled a Khasi alphabet and dictionary. In 1846 Anne Jones died in childbirth, and Thomas Jones married Emma Cattell, an act which got him into trouble with the Missionary Society 'as she was only fifteen years old'. A son, Thomas Cattell Jones, was born posthumously. A failed attempt to set up his own mission at Pomreng led to further difficulties with the authorities, who abandoned him in 1847. As a result of his criticisms of a local industrialist, Henry Inglis, Jones was forced to leave the area. He contracted malaria, of which he died on 16 September 1849. He is buried in the Scottish Cemetery at Calcutta. References Sources * Nigel Jenkins, Gwalia in Khasia (1995) * D.

Early life Ali Eid was born in Tabbaneh, Tripoli, Lebanon. The eldest son of Youssef Eid, a wheat dealer and his wife Amoun Eid. He began his studies at Tripoli Boys School (TBS), also known as the American School in Tripoli. In the summer he would study at the place of Sheikh Khoder in Tabbaneh, he always excelled in his studies coming first in his class. Political career In 1960 Ali Eid decided to continue his studies in United States of America, majoring in Biochemistry. Ali Eid was known amongst his peers for his patriotism, revolutionary spirit, and enthusiasm towards justice. Ali Eid returned to Lebanon in 1960, and attended the American University of Beirut (AUB) and majored in Political Science & Public Administration (PSPA). During his studies and time in Beirut, he discovered that the political structure of the Lebanese system deprived the people of his religious sect, Alawites, of their rights at any level. In 1972 Ali Eid began his political life after he founded (The Alawite Youth Movement), and his alliance with the late Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad. In 1977 Ali Eid and a group of friends founded The Front Opposing Patriotism party. Its founders were Souhale Hamadah (General Secretary) Ali Eid as (Vice president), Rashid Al-Mukadim, George Mourani, and Nasib Al-Khatib. In 1982 The Front Opposing Patriotism was resolved and The Arabic Democratic Party was founded with Ali Eid being the general secretary. In 1989 he was hit by a catastrophe, the death of his son Zoulficar due to an unexploded bomb from the Lebanese civil war. Ali Eid was appointed to newly established Alawite seat in the Lebanese Parliament in 1991 as a deputy, which was created following the Taif Agreement.\\"Alawite from Tripoli, Ali Eid was appointed to the newly-established Alawite seat in 1991.\\" He was the general secretary of the Arab Democratic Party in Lebanon, and though he and his party were pro-Syrian during the Lebanese Civil War, he and other Lebanese Alawites have since become more neutral due to the involvement of the Syrians in him losing the Alawite Parliament Seat to the late Alawite Deputy Ahmad Habous in 1996.\\"Former Tripoli MP Ali Eid, who ran in the 2000 elections on former Premier Omar Karami's list, said: 'The Allawite sect was never granted any privileges during Syria's 29-year presence. Their regime is secular, not sectarian like here, and thus for them it is not logical to distinguish any specific sect.\\" In 2010, explosives were found near his home in Jabal Mohsen, Tripoli, and subsequently dismantled. In March 2015, Eid's brother Bader was assassinated in the village of Kuweikhat in Akkar. Death On 25 December 2015, it was announced that Eid had died in Damascus, Syria at the age of 75.

His research focuses on the design of large-scale database management systems, the protection of their content, often using knowledge- based techniques. After his formal retirement he focused on valuation methods for intellectual property and intellectual capital. Early life and education Gio Wiederhold was born June 24, 1936 in Varese, Italy. He graduated C.Ae. cum laude in Aeronautical Engineering from the TMS Technicum in Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1957. From 1957 to 1958 he did graduate work at the Technische Hogeschool in Delft. He emigrated to the United States in 1958. Since 1966 he has been married to Voy Yat Jew. Early career He worked on computations of short-range missile trajectories at NATO's Air Defense Technical Center (SADTC) in Wassenaar near The Hague in 1958. From 1958 to 1961 he worked at IBM's service bureau. Projects at IBM included developing numerical methods for computing the power (specific impulse) of solid rocket fuel combustion in 1959, and inserting alphabetic I/O capability into FORTRAN compilers to allow output of chemical equations in 1960. In 1962 at the University of California, Berkeley he developed an incremental compiling technology, with a flexibility close to interpreted code, while running at high speed. He also received and completed coursework at UC Berkeley. In 1965 he developed similar techniques for the Stanford University Medical School. The next year he worked on real-time data-acquisition control and data analysis using coupled computers for clinical research, and in 1970 on transposed storage (now termed a Column-oriented DBMS) for databases for very- high speed on-line analytical processing, also at the medical school. From 1973 through 1976 he did graduate work at the University of California, San Francisco, with his Ph.D. thesis titled \\"A Methodology for the Design of Medical Database Systems\\". An extensive study of computerized ambulatory health care systems, appeared as an appendix to his dissertation. Stanford In 1976 Wiederhold joined the faculty of Stanford University. He integrated knowledge base technology exploiting artificial intelligence concepts to provide intelligent and efficient access to databases which he called KBMS. He authored a text book on quantitative aspects of database management systems, first published by McGraw-Hill in 1977. A second edition was published in 1983. In 1995 the copyright was transferred to Wiederhold, who published an expanded version of the book in 2001. He also published a book on file organization for databases in 1987. From 1991 through 1994 Wiederhold served as a program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). He initiated the DARPA Intelligent Integration of Information (I3) program. A visible component is the Digital Library effort, which was delegated to National Science Foundation; the research has opened up new Internet application fields, and funded projects such as Google . His articles on the data semantic interoperability are at the origin of the modern service- oriented architecture and the success of XML. he was named a fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics in 1984, a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in 1991, and fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1995. Later career Wiederhold's career included: * Rapid presentation of database information for personal computing at VisiCorp (1982). * Model-based transformation of relational database information into object-oriented representations (1986). * The architectural concepts leading to mediators (1990). * The development of a very-high-level Megaprogramming language for software composition in 1992. * A means to protect outgoing private information in practical databases used for collaboration in 1995. * Means to integrate projections into the future into information systems‚ÄîSimQL in 1996. * An approach to scalable semantic interoperation via an ontology algebra in 1998. * A method to value software intangibles based on balancing initial and maintenance efforts to allocate income in 2005. In 2001 he retired to be an emeritus professor of computer science with courtesy appointments in medicine and electrical engineering. Since then he has been consulting through MITRE corporation with the U.S. Treasury on assessing the values of intellectual property exported from the U.S. as part of offshoring. He authored and coauthored more than 400 published papers and reports on computing and medicine and served as the associate editor or editor-in-chief of ACM's Transactions on Database Systems (TODS) from 1982 to 1992. Major books were Database Design, McGraw-Hill, 1977 and 1982 and Valuing Intellectual Capital, Springer 2013. In June 2011, Wiederhold was awarded an honorary doctorate by NUI Galway. Wiederhold and his wife Voy developed historical exhibits in Stanford's Computer Science Building in cooperation with the Computer History Museum in Mountain View.

During World War II, the legal basis for this detention was under Presidential Proclamation 2526, made by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt under the authority of the Alien Enemies Act. With the US entry into World War I after Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, German nationals were automatically classified as \\"enemy aliens.\\" Two of the four main World War I-era internment camps were located in Hot Springs, N.C. and Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia.The U.S. Confiscated Half a Billion Dollars in Private Property During WWI, America‚Äôs home front was the site of internment, deportation, and vast property seizure, Smithsonian Magazine Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer wrote that \\"All aliens interned by the government are regarded as enemies, and their property is treated accordingly.\\" By the time of WWII, the United States had a large population of ethnic Germans. Among residents of the United States in 1940, more than 1.2 million persons had been born in Germany, 5 million had two native-German parents, and 6 million had one native-German parent. Many more had distant German ancestry. During WWII, the United States detained at least 11,000 ethnic Germans, overwhelmingly German nationals. The government examined the cases of German nationals individually, and detained relatively few in internment camps run by the Department of Justice, as related to its responsibilities under the Alien Enemies Act. To a much lesser extent, some ethnic German US citizens were classified as suspect after due process and also detained. Similarly, a small proportion of Italian nationals and Italian Americans were interned in relation to their total population in the US. The United States had allowed immigrants from both Germany and Italy to become naturalized citizens, which many had done by then. In the early 21st century, Congress considered legislation to study treatment of European Americans during WWII, but it did not pass the House of Representatives. Activists and historians have identified certain injustices against these groups. Unlike Italian Americans and Japanese Americans, German Americans have not received an official apology for these events.

The same regulations and registration requirements were imposed on females on April 18, 1918.Arnold Krammer, Undue Process: The Untold Story of America's German Alien Internees (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 1997), 14 Some 6,300 such aliens were arrested. Thousands were interrogated and investigated. A total of 2,048 (0.8%) were incarcerated for the remainder of the war in two camps, Fort Douglas, Utah, for those west of the Mississippi, and Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, for those east of the Mississippi.Krammer, Undue Process, 14-5 A New York City Police officer fingerprinting a German in 1917 The cases of these aliens, whether being considered for internment or under internment, were managed by the Enemy Alien Registration Section of the Department of Justice. From December 1917 this section was headed by J. Edgar Hoover, then not yet 23 years old.Ann Hagedorn, Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919 (NY: Simon & Schuster, 2007), 327‚Äì8 Among the notable internees were the geneticist Richard Goldschmidt and 29 players from the Boston Symphony Orchestra.New York Times: \\"Dr. Muck Bitter at Sailing,\\" August 22, 1919, accessed January 13, 2010 Their music director, Karl Muck, spent more than a year at Fort Oglethorpe, as did Ernst Kunwald, the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.Harold Schonberg, The Great Conductors (NY: Simon and Schuster, 1967), , 216‚Äì222 One internee described a memorable concert in the mess hall packed with 2000 internees, with honored guests such as their doctors and government censors on the front benches, facing 100 musicians.

The crews were first treated as alien detainees and then as prisoners of war (POWs). In December 1914 the German gunboat Cormoran, pursued by the Japanese Navy, tried to take on provisions and refuel in Guam. When denied what he required, the commanding officer accepted internment as enemy aliens rather than return to sea without sufficient fuel. The ship's guns were disabled. Most of the crew lived on board, since there were no housing facilities available. During the several years the Germans were detainees, they outnumbered U.S. Marines in Guam. Relations were cordial, and a U.S. Navy nurse married one of the Cormoran's officers. As a result of U-boat attacks on U.S. shipping to Europe, the U.S. broke off diplomatic relations with Germany on February 4, 1917. U.S. officials in Guam then imposed greater restrictions on the German detainees. Those who had moved to quarters on land returned to the ship. Following the U.S. declaration of war on Germany in April 1917, the Americans demanded \\"the immediate and unconditional surrender of the ship and personnel.\\" The German captain and his crew blew up the ship, taking several German lives. Six whose bodies were found were buried in the U.S. Naval Cemetery in Apra with full military honors. The surviving 353 German service members became prisoners of war, and on April 29 were shipped to the U.S. mainland.New York Times: \\"Blow up Cormoran, Interned Gunboat,\\" April 8, 1917, accessed March 30, 2011; Robert F.

They constructed a complex commonly known as the \\"German village\\", with painted one-room houses and fenced yards made from scrap lumber, curtained windows, and gardens of flowers and vegetables, as well as a village church, a police station, and cafes serving non-alcoholic beverages. They rescued animals from other ships and raised goats and pigs in the village, along with numerous pet cats and dogs.Popular Science Monthly: \\"A German Village on American Soil\\", v. 90, January‚ÄìJune 1917, 424‚Äì5, accessed April 1, 2011 On October 1, 1916, the ships and their personnel were moved to the Philadelphia Navy Yard along with the village structures,Great Lakes Recruit: \\"The German auxiliary...\\", vol. 4, no. 11, November 1918, accessed April 1, 2011 which again became known locally as the \\"German village.\\" In this more secure location in the Navy Yard behind a barbed wire fence, the detainees designated February 2, 1917, as Red Cross Day and solicited donations to the German Red Cross.New York Times: \\"Neutral Ships Held Here,\\" February 3, 1917, accessed March 30, 2011 As German-American relations worsened in the spring of 1917, nine sailors successfully escaped detention, prompting Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels to act immediately on plans to transfer the other 750 to detention camps at Fort McPherson and Fort Oglethorpe in late March 1917,New York Times: \\"Ten Interned Men Made their Escape,\\" March 21, 1917, accessed March 30, 2011 where they were isolated from civilian detainees.New York Times: \\"Germans Interned at Georgia Forts,\\" March 28, 1917, accessed March 30, 2011. More than 400 from the Wilhelm went to Fort McPherson, and the rest to Fort Oglethorpe. Following the U.S. declaration of war on Imperial Germany, some of the Cormoran's crew members were sent to McPherson, while others were held at Fort Douglas, Utah, for the duration of the war. World War II In the 1940 US census, some 1,237,000 persons identified as being of German birth; 5 million persons had both parents born in Germany; and 6 million persons had at least one parent born in Germany. German immigrants had not been prohibited from becoming naturalized United States citizens and many did so. The large number of German Americans of recent connection to Germany, and their resulting political and economical influence, have been considered the reason they were spared large- scale relocation and internment. Shortly after the Japanese strike on Pearl Harbor, some 1,260 German nationals were detained and arrested, as the government had been watching them.Franca Iacovetta, Roberto Perin, and Angelo Principe, Enemies Within: Italian and Other Internees in Canada and Abroad, (University of Toronto Press, 2000), , p. 281 Of the 254 persons not of Japanese ancestry evicted from coastal areas, the majority were ethnic German. During WWII, German nationals and German Americans in the US were detained and/or evicted from coastal areas on an individual basis. Although the War Department (now the Department of Defense) considered mass expulsion of ethnic Germans and ethnic Italians from the East or West coast areas for reasons of military security, it did not follow through with this. The numbers of people involved would have been overwhelming to manage. A total of 11,507 people of German ancestry were interned during the war, comprising 36.1% of the total internments under the US Justice Department's Enemy Alien Control Program. By contrast, an estimated 110,000‚Äì120,000 Japanese-Americans were forcibly relocated from the West Coast and incarcerated in internment camps run by the US War Department's War Relocation Authority. By the outbreak of World War II, the Nazi party's foreign countries organization (NSDAP/AO) sought to organize German citizens abroad, and managed to enroll between 3% and 9% of the German nationals in the Americas. Though it was disappointed by this low participation, by promoting public activities of uniformed members, the NSDAP/AO gained a perception of being more influential than it was in fact. Inaccurate and fearful United States media reports contributed to a public perception of high feeling for the Nazis among German nationals in the Americas. =Deportation of Germans from Latin America= In addition, the US accepted more than 4,500 German nationals deported from Latin America, detaining them in DOJ camps. During the early years of the war, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had drafted a list of Germans in fifteen Latin American countries whom it suspected of subversive activities. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the US demanded deportation of these suspects for detention on US soil.Adam, 181 The countries that responded expelled 4,058 people.Thomas Adam, ed., Transatlantic Relations Series. Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History: A Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia. Volume II (2005), , 181 Some 10% to 15% were Nazi party members, including approximately a dozen who were recruiters for the NSDAP/AO, which acted as the overseas arm of the Nazi party. Just eight were people suspected of espionage.Adam, 182 Also transferred were some 81 Jewish Germans who had fled persecution in Nazi Germany and found refuge in Latin America. Many of the Germans had been immigrants and residents of Latin America for years, some for decades. In some instances, corrupt Latin American officials took the opportunity to seize the property of Germans. Sometimes financial rewards paid by American intelligence led to a person's identification as German and expulsion. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico did not participate in the program. The following territories set up their own detention facilities for enemy aliens of Axis nations: Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cura√ßao, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru and Venezuela, as well as in the Panama Canal Zone. The U.S. internment camps that held Germans from Latin America included: *Texas Crystal City Kenedy Seagoville *Florida Camp Blanding *Oklahoma Stringtown *North Dakota Fort Lincoln *Tennessee Camp Forrest Some internees were held as late as 1948.Toobin, Jeffrey, \\"After Stevens\\", The New Yorker, 43‚Äì44, March 22, 2010. =Studies and review = Since the late 20th century, detainees from the DOJ camps began to work to gain recognition of their trials. US citizens of ethnic European groups (German and Italian) which had been considered enemy aliens during the war, and some of those aliens argued that their civil rights had been violated and asked for reparations. In 2005, activists formed an organization called the German American Internee Coalition to publicize the \\"internment, repatriation and exchange of civilians of German ethnicity\\" during World War II. It is seeking U.S. government review and acknowledgment of civil rights violations.German American Internee Coalition: \\"About Us\\" , accessed April 4, 2011 The TRACES Center for History and Culture, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, travels the United States in a \\"bus-eum\\" to educate citizens about treatment of foreign nationals in the U.S. during World War II.\\"Vanished: The German internment BUS-eum comes to Marshall\\", Marshall Democrat News, April 2007, accessed 7 June 2011 Legislation was introduced in the United States Congress in 2001 to create an independent commission to review government policies on European enemy ethnic groups during the war.

The self-styled 'Lord', nicknamed \\"Fast Eddie\\" came to prominence in the late 1980s as the organiser of the controversial Gatecrasher Balls for wealthy teenagers. After being convicted of tax offences in 1990, he started on a second career as a property developer. He claimed to have acquired a substantial fortune but also attracted controversy for his business practices such as the way he acquired the former High Commission building of Sierra Leone in London, during the country's civil war. From 2005 to 2009 he was the \\"ringmaster\\" of a series of advance-fee fraud schemes that defrauded dozens of individuals out of millions of pounds. He was arrested and charged in December 2009 and was convicted in September 2011 along with five other defendants, receiving a jail sentence of seven years and eight months. Davenport was released from prison early in 2014 due to health concerns. Early life Davenport was born in Kensington, London to Dublin-born Ormus Neville Talbot Davenport (13 November 1904 ‚Äì 17 December 2002),http://s3.amazonaws.com/historypie_devel/class/files/902/original/worfield%20graves%202,16918,0.pdf a wealthy restaurateur, and his second wife, Hendon-born Jean (n√©e Gorrie). His half-brother from his father's first marriage, John Geoffrey Davenport (born September 1931), was a banker and director of the cargo airliner MK Airlines from 1992 to 2003. He grew up in Fulham, and was educated at Frensham Heights School, Surrey, then moved on to Mander Portman Woodward, an exclusive South Kensington crammer. It was during his time there that he started organising parties. At the age of 15 he began selling clothes on Portobello Road before making a career organising parties, first at his home and later in nightclubs. By the time he was 21 he had set up Gatecrasher, a company organising parties in country houses for public school teenagers. He also bought up and ran several London nightclubs, including SW1 in Victoria (Pacha London).  Gatecrasher Balls  In September 1986, aged 20, Davenport co- founded Gatecrasher Ltd with Jeremy Taylor. The company organised parties for teenagers at country houses such as Longleat and Weston Park, which were attended by up to 10,000 party-goers at any one time and at the height of their success were generating ¬£1,000,000 a year. The idea behind the balls was to enable wealthy teenagers at single-sex boarding schools to meet the opposite sex and drink large amounts of alcohol. As one reveller put it, \\"I'm here to get drunk and get laid\\". The balls gained a reputation for debauchery, with one newspaper calling them the scene of \\"Unbridled lust among upper-class Lolitas and public school Lotharios.\\" The balls ceased to be held after an HM Customs & Excise audit found that Davenport had substantially underpaid his Value Added Tax bill. Davenport was found to have understated his tax returns by ¬£24,672 by falsely claiming that only ¬£3.50 of the ¬£14 entry fees for the Gatecrasher Balls was liable for VAT; the remaining ¬£10.50 was supposedly for raffle tickets, a magazine subscription and postage. The prosecution described this as a \\"cheat\\" and Davenport admitted breaching VAT rules. Convicted for tax evasion, he was sentenced in November 1990 to nine months in jail. Asked by Tatler magazine how he coped with two weeks in prison, Davenport said in 2006: \\"Boring. There aren't many parties there.\\" The sentence was reduced on appeal to a nine-month suspended term for tax fraud. He later attributed his legal problems to his being \\"incredibly naive about things like VAT.\\" In the aftermath of his conviction, Gatecrasher Ltd ceased trading.  Business  Following the success of the Gatecrasher Balls, Davenport turned his attention to the club sector in 1991. His ventures included joint ownership with Piers Adam of the SW1 Club (now known as Pacha), and The Conservatory based in Derby. After selling the clubs, he established a high-end pawnbroking business with offices in Bruton Street, Mayfair, to pawn expensive jewellery and luxury cars. After acquiring the manorial title of the village of Gifford in Shropshire, he began to call himself \\"Lord Edward\\", though he is not a member of the peerage. He claimed to own 25 buildings in the West End of London worth an estimated ¬£100 million, controlled through a Monaco-based company called the Davenport Trust, as well as property in Monaco and Thailand. According to Davenport, his business method is \\"buying leases on loss-making properties, returning them to a profit and then selling them.\\" A BBC investigation reported that tenants would pay their rent to one of Davenport's temporary companies, which would then pay the owner of the building. He was accused by the BBC of increasing tenants' rents at short notice and evicting them if they did not agree to the new terms, but he denied the claims, calling them \\"very far-fetched.\\" In 2006, his home was raided by police and Department of Trade and Industry investigators looking into his links with two property companies that collapsed owing millions of pounds. He avoided legal action on that occasion, although action was taken against an audit firm. In 1998, Davenport and two other men were charged after running up an ¬£18,000 bill at the luxury Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland during a five-day New Year party. The three were said to have posed as aristocrats. They denied the charges, which were later dropped, but Davenport failed to turn up in court and claimed that he had suffered kidney failure and could not travel because he was receiving dialysis. =33 Portland Place= 33 Portland Place In 1996, Davenport was introduced to Professor Cyril Foray, the former Foreign Minister and High Commissioner of Sierra Leone, during that country's civil war. Davenport entered into negotiations with the Sierra Leone government in order to refurbish the country's London embassy, 33 Portland Place, built in 1775 by Robert Adam and valued at ¬£5 million. He acquired a lease on the building for ¬£50,000 but eventually claimed the property as his private residence. The government of Sierra Leone took legal action against Davenport in London in 1999, but the case was eventually settled with no clear victor. The British government offered to purchase a new building for the Sierra Leonean High Commission, leaving Davenport with the remainder of the lease. In 2005 a Nevis-based company, Portland Place (Historic House) Ltd, acquired the freehold of the building for ¬£3.75 million. A UK company, with an identical name, Portland Place (Historic House) Ltd, is registered at 33 Portland Place with assets and turnover listed as nil. The property was regularly hired out for tango and pole-dancing lessons and parties, leading to many complaints from neighbours. In 2005, the Sunday Mirror reported that orgies were being held at Davenport's mansion. In July 2006 Westminster City Council issued an enforcement order directing Davenport to cease using the property for \\"commercial and non-residential purposes\\" but this was essentially ignored and unauthorised use continued. Davenport has also hired out the building for high-profile events, including exhibitions, films and photography shoots for figures such as Kate Moss, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. All Visual Arts used it for a Frieze Art Fair exhibition titled Vanitas: The Transience of Earthly Pleasures in 2010 and singer Amy Winehouse used it to shoot the video for her hit song Rehab. In April 2010, the house doubled as Lionel Logue's clinic in Oscar-winning film The King's Speech starring Colin Firth. A number of porn films were also reportedly shot there. In July 2010, following a party at 33 Portland Place, Westminster City Council brought a legal action against Davenport charging him with breaching a noise abatement order. The case was dismissed by Judge Purdy at Westminster City Magistrates Court, and Davenport was awarded ¬£28,000 in costs. Later that month Westminster City Council brought an action at the High Court charging that Davenport's use of the property breached planning permission. The council reported that Davenport had filled a small pool with 1,000 litres of cognac.Swimming pool at Georgian mansion 'filled with alcohol for party-goers to row across' The Daily Telegraph 14 July 2010 Davenport was found to have breached the 2006 enforcement notice and a High Court judge issued a permanent ban on the use of the house for non-residential purposes. In April 2011 Davenport lost an appeal against the injunction. =Patrick Cox= In 2008, Davenport purchased the fashion label of celebrity shoe designer Patrick Cox for ¬£2.6 million. Following the sale of his business, Cox remained on the board. However, Cox was later forced to close his store and make his staff redundant when the deal broke down in acrimonious circumstances. According to another board member, Robert Lee, the ¬£2.6 million promised by Davenport never turned up and his representative Peter Riley did not attend a single board meeting. Lee alleged that Davenport had tried to make licensing deals abroad using the Patrick Cox name without the board's approval or the right to do so, and had removed assets from Cox's studio in Chelsea. Davenport denied the allegations, saying that \\"everything he does is within the legal framework.\\" Advance fee fraud In late 2005 Davenport acquired an existing shelf company and renamed it as Gresham Ltd ‚Äì a name similar to, but wholly unconnected with, the well-known wealth management company Gresham Financial ‚Äì which he used as a vehicle for advance fee frauds. Gresham was falsely presented as a long-established, wealthy and prestigious firm with a prospectus claiming that it had been involved in the commercial loans market since 1958. The company promoted itself through glossy brochures and advertisements in the Financial Times. Between 2005 and 2009, Davenport and several co-conspirators promised to finance over 50 commercial loans, targeting construction projects in several countries. Businesses were asked to pay large sums for \\"deposits\\", \\"verification fees\\", \\"loan guarantees\\" and \\"due diligence\\". The company's records noted payments of ¬£4.5 million from prospective borrowers. Ten of the largest prospects were promised loans of ¬£500 million but, like the rest, received nothing. In one case reported by the Financial Times, a fee of ‚Ç¨830,000 was charged as a \\"security deposit\\". The value of the fraud was said by prosecutors to be at least ¬£12 million. Victims included Elizabeth Emanuel, who lost her savings after being promised a ¬£1 million loan. An Indian businessman paid ¬£285,000 to finance a ‚Ç¨183 million loan but suffered \\"crippling losses\\" of ¬£825,000 after no money arrived, leaving him owing ‚Ç¨11 million. In October 2009 Gresham was liquidated after companies secretly controlled by Davenport petitioned to have it wound up. He continued the advance fee fraud through another newly acquired shelf company, Cutting and Company (Investments) Ltd, which had been established in 1930 and had been dormant since about 2000. Cutting was portrayed to the public as a restructuring expert. Davenport sought to keep his distance from the fraud by using aliases such as \\"James Stewart\\" or \\"James Stuart\\". However, he was exposed when fire regulators recognised \\"James Stewart\\" as Davenport from photographs on his own website and informed the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). Two months later, at the start of December 2009, SFO investigators and police raided 19 commercial and residential properties in London, Surrey, Cheshire and Derbyshire and arrested six people. Davenport was charged with conspiracy to obtain money by deception, conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and money laundering. He was also accused of carrying out a \\"price ramping\\" fraud on a ¬£2.4 million property in central London to artificially increase its price at auction. The property, an office building at 80 Paul Street in the City of London, was said to have been sold for ¬£700,000 more than its market value due to a false claim made about a lease supposedly guaranteed by Gresham Ltd. The SFO also said that it was investigating allegations of a rent fraud involving Gresham. Also accused were David McHugh, an accountant; David Horsfall, Davenport's solicitor, Peter Riley, a Gresham director; Richard Kirkup (also known as Richard Stephens), who had been convicted in 2004 of a previous advance fee fraud; and Borge Andersen, Davenport and Riley were remanded in custody to Wandsworth Prison while the others were released either on bail or without charges. =Trial and conviction= In June 2011, the SFO brought 11 cases against Davenport in Southwark Crown Court, though prosecutors said that these represented only a fraction of the true scale of the fraud, as there were at least 51 victims in the UK, Austria and India. Davenport was also charged with a separate ¬£8 million fraud and money laundering scam. The three-month trial concluded in September 2011 with Davenport, Riley and Andersen each convicted on a single count of fraud. The other charges against Davenport were left to lie on file. Horsfall, McHugh and Kirkup pleaded guilty. Davenport was found to be the \\"ringmaster and guiding mind\\" behind the fraud, while Riley was described as \\"an accomplished conman\\" and a skilful liar who \\"strung along borrowers on a huge scale with bare-faced lies\\". Both men were sentenced to seven years and eight months' imprisonment, banned from becoming company directors for 10 years and ordered to pay compensation and legal costs. Andersen, who was described as being \\"generally perceived as the most articulate and plausible of the fraudsters\\", was sentenced to 39 months. On 11 November 2011, Horsfall was sentenced to 17 months for fraud by false representation, while McHugh and Kirkup received four years and two months and three years and eight months respectively for conspiracy to defraud. McHugh was revealed to have been convicted of 40 offences since 2000. He had falsely claimed to be a lawyer and accountant and also produced false company accounts for Gresham, while Kirkup posed as a surveyor to carry out expensive assessment visits to the sites of planned building projects. Horsfall admitted writing a letter that falsified how much money Gresham had. Reporting restrictions were imposed at the start of the trial but were lifted in October 2011 after Horsfall, the final defendant, pleaded guilty. According to Gresham's accounts, Andersen received ¬£159,564, Riley ¬£695,407, and Davenport ¬£773,000, but a further ¬£349,025 went missing and could not be traced. However, SFO investigators are reported to have found that Davenport has few assets in his name and went to great lengths to distance himself from the fraud; Judge Testar commented, \\"He did not leave very many footprints in the snow himself.\\" In November Karen Todner challenged the decision of Judge Testar to impose a Compensation Order of ¬£1.9m, in addition to the ¬£12m Confiscation Order already imposed on Davenport. The Court of Appeal accepted those representations and Davenport's Confiscation Order was reduced by ¬£1.9m. Both orders were settled and the Court Service returned Davenport's money forthwith. Davenport was subsequently released from prison on compassionate grounds, due to serious illness. =Reactions= Sentencing Davenport, Riley and Andersen, Judge Peter Testar said: \\"This was a professional, sophisticated fraud which had a grave impact on its victims, decent honest people.\\" He commented: \\"The stress and anxiety these people suffered were enormous and their lives have been grievously affected by this fraud. Some of them will never recover from that ... It was a professional and sophisticated fraud which had a great impact on the victims and each of these two defendants [Davenport and Riley] had a significant role to play.\\" Judge David Higgins, who sentenced the remaining defendants, said: \\"Not one penny was ever produced by the conspirators, who simply put the fees etc in their pockets. The harm done to the victims was substantial, including bankruptcy, unemployment and at least one personal breakdown.\\" The Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Richard Alderman, hailed the convictions as a major success for the SFO and commented: \\"This was a proactive investigation that stopped a sophisticated criminal enterprise in its tracks. The time taken from the commencement of the investigation to trial was a little over fifteen months and demonstrates the SFO's commitment to reducing the time taken to bring cases before the Crown Court.\\" Following his conviction, Davenport issued a statement expressing his \\"shock and dismay\\" at the verdict. He said: \\"This is a matter that I have denied throughout and have already lodged an appeal against this conviction at the Royal Courts of Justice (ref 201103357D3); detailed grounds of appeal have been drafted and filed by my legal team... I will continue to make every effort to prove my innocence and I look forward to my case being considered by the Court of Appeal and being able to clear my name.\\" Following his release from prison in 2014, Davenport successfully appealed against a Confiscation Order he was forced to pay after being convicted of fraud in 2011. After his release, Davenport reportedly became involved in property deals with a Chinese business partner and started looking to buy a film studio. =Confiscation proceedings= Confiscation proceedings against Davenport began on 19 June 2013. According to prosecutors, he had made ¬£34.5 million through his fraud schemes, though Davenport has argued that he should only repay ¬£8 million. Alleged largest single element was the purchase of 33 Portland Place building, which the prosecution has said was obtained through fraud. In October 2015 Davenport returned to the Court of Appeal, claiming he had been the victim of ‚Äúdouble counting‚Äù by the SFO in its Confiscation and Compensation Order. The SFO said it had recovered more than ¬£13 million from Davenport to satisfy the orders, but Davenport's solicitor Karen Todner argued that he had already paid too much in confiscation and compensation. Todner told the Court of Appeal that although Davenport might have benefited from ¬£12 million fraud, he had been made to repay nearly ¬£14 million. SFO lawyers disagreed with the sentiment and said Davenport's appeals should be dismissed however Court of Appeal subsequently accepted Todner's appeal lodged on Davenport's behalf and the Order was set aside.

The brand's distillery in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, was built in 1910 with Spanish Mission-style architecture, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The company's warehouse for aging and bottling operations is in Cox's Creek, Kentucky. The brand and its products have evolved and transformed since the company's founding in the late 19th century, and especially since the firm's acquisition at the beginning of the 21st century. History By some accounts, the brand was founded by Rufus Mathewson Rose and was probably named in honor of him, his brother Origen, and their two sons. However, several different stories have been told about the name's origin. Owner Kirin Brewery does not mention Rufus M. Rose in its version of the history, and refers instead to Paul Jones Jr. as the founder of the brand.Four Roses Bourbon History page on Four Roses brand website. The company says the brand name was trademarked in 1888 by Jones, who claimed it had been produced and sold as early as the 1860s. The brand's distillery in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, was built in 1910 with Spanish Mission- style architecture, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was originally called the Old Prentice distillery and was owned by J.T.S. Brown. It was designed by Joseph & Joseph Architects, a firm with a history that has spanned more than a century in distillery design. The brand was purchased by Seagram in 1943. Around the end of the 1950s, Seagram discontinued the sale of Four Roses bourbon within the United States in order to focus on sales of blended whiskey, although it introduced other brands of straight bourbons in the 1960s and 1970s, such as Benchmark and Eagle Rare. Four Roses Kentucky straight bourbon marketing was shifted to Europe and Asia, which were rapidly growing markets at the time. In the United States during this period, the Four Roses name was used on a blended whiskey, made mostly of neutral grain spirits and commonly seen as a sub-par brand. Four Roses continued to be unavailable as a straight bourbon in the US market until late 1994, a period of nearly 40 years. In 1999, Four Roses brand ownership passed from Seagram to Vivendi/Universal, then in 2001 to Pernod Ricard and Diageo before being purchased by The Kirin Brewery in 2002. Kirin discontinued the sale of blended whiskey to focus exclusively on Four Roses Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey. The brand's master distiller during 1995‚Äì2015 was Jim Rutledge, who had started working for Seagram in 1966. The previous master distiller was Ova Haney. Since Rutledge's retirement in 2015, the master distiller has been Brent Elliott, who had worked with Rutledge for the preceding 10 years. Elliot is originally from Owensboro, Kentucky, and has a degree in chemistry from the University of Kentucky. In April 2019, the Four Roses distillery completed a $55 million expansion project that coincided with the official launch of Small Batch Select the first permanent addition to the distillery's bourbon lineup in 12 years. The distillery's expansion project began in 2015 and resulted in the ability to double production capacity. The expansion project invested $34 million into the Four Roses distillery in Lawrenceburg, and $21 million at the Warehouse & Bottling facility in Cox's Creek. At the distillery, Four Roses added two new buildings and equipment, including a new column and doubler still and more fermenters. With the duplicate column and doubler still, production capacity is scheduled to increase from 4 million to 8 million proof gallons, enough to fill more than 130,000 barrels per year (). The Louisville-based architecture firm Joseph & Joseph designed the original distillery in 1910, and modeled the new buildings after the existing Spanish mission-style structures. Products The company distills ten separate bourbons using two mash recipes and five yeast strains. From combining these ten bourbons, the Four Roses distillery creates their standard bourbon. The single barrel bottlings are made with only one of those ten bourbons. The brand's regular bottlings are: *Four Roses Bourbon: 80 U.S. proof; sold in U.S., Europe and Japan *Four Roses Small Batch: 90 proof; sold in U.S. and Europe *Four Roses Single Barrel: 100 proof; sold in U.S., Europe, and in small volumes in Japan *Four Roses Small Batch Select: 104 proof; aged at least six years; non-chill-filtered; sold in U.S. *Four Roses Black: 80 proof; sold in Japan *Four Roses Super Premium: 86 proof; sold in Japan The company also produces special limited-production commemorative releases. These are often non-chill-filtered and bottled at barrel proof. The Four Roses distillery has also produced Bulleit Bourbon for the Diageo beverage conglomerate.

During a stay in Tournehem, a castle near Saint-Omer in the north of modern-day France, Erasmus encountered an uncivilized, yet friendly soldier who was an acquaintance of Battus, Erasmus' close friend. On the request of the soldier's pious wife, who felt slighted by her husband's behaviour, Battus asked Erasmus to write a text which would convince the soldier of the necessity of mending his ways, which he did. The resulting work was eventually re-drafted by Erasmus and expanded into the Enchiridion militis Christiani.The Greek word encheiridion has the double meaning of 'manual' and 'dagger', which gives the title a military connotation. The Enchiridion is an appeal on Christians to act in accordance with the Christian faith rather than merely performing the necessary rites. It became one of Erasmus' most influential works.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits scrub and open woodland. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. Measuring in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to advertise territories and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied. The position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to European or American robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the songbird infraorder Passerida. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of insects and spiders. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity. Taxonomy The red-capped robin was described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, having been collected in the northern Spencer Gulf in South Australia. They named it Muscicapa goodenovii,[245] and placed it among the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.Boles, p. xv. The specific epithet goodenovii honours the Reverend Samuel Goodenough, Bishop of Carlisle and first treasurer of the Linnean Society. The red-capped robin was later moved to the genus Petroica. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words petros 'rock' and oikos 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.Boles, p. 66. Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as \\"red robins\\", as distinct from the \\"yellow robins\\" of the genus Eopsaltria. It is not closely related to the American robin or the European robin; however, it is named after the European robin. Molecular research (and current consensus) places the red-capped robin and its relatives‚Äîthe Australian robin family Petroicidae‚Äîas a very early offshoot of the Passerida, or \\"advanced\\" songbirds, within the songbird lineage. No subspecies are recognised, and the only geographic variation recorded in plumage is a tendency for females from more arid regions to have paler plumage.Higgins et al. p. 664. Testing of the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of Australian members of the genus Petroica suggests that the red-capped robin's closest relative within the genus is the scarlet robin. Officially known as the red-capped robin, it has also been referred to as redhead, redcap, robin red-breast or red-throated robin. Kuburi is a name used in the Kimberley. Across southwestern Australia, it was known as menekedang by the local indigenous people. In the Arandic languages spoken in Central Australia, the red-capped robin is known as ak-arl-atwe-rre-ye meaning \\"the head that they hit\\" from an ancient myth of it being hit on the head and bleeding. Description alt=A small red and black plumaged bird is perched on a branchlet against a background of small bare branchlets in a tree. The smallest of the red robins, the red-capped robin is long with a wingspan of , and weighs around 7‚Äì9 g (0.25‚Äì0.31 oz). Males and females are of similar size. It has longer legs than the other robins of the genus Petroica. The male has a distinctive scarlet cap and breast. Its upperparts are jet- black with white shoulder bars, and its tail is black with white tips. The underparts and shoulder are white. All colours are sharply delineated from one another.Higgins et al. p. 649. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown above with a reddish tint to the crown, and paler underneath with dark brown wings and pale buff wing-patch. Some females have a reddish tint to the breast. Both sexes have a small, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. Immature birds initially resemble the female;Boles, p. 93. it is only with their second moult, which takes place at around a year of age that males adopt their distinctive adult plumage.Higgins et al. p. 661. The red-capped robin moults once a year, after the breeding season, which takes place between December and April.Higgins et al. p. 662. alt=A small bird with pale brown plumage and reddish tint to chest and cap is perched on a twig against a background of small bare branchlets in a tree. Two red keto-carotenoid pigments, canthaxanthin and adonirubin, are responsible for the redness in the red-capped robin's plumage. The birds are unable to synthesize these compounds themselves, and hence need to obtain them from their food. Carotenoids are costly to metabolise, and are also required for use in immune function, hence red-capped robins need to be in good condition to have enough left for use in red feathers. This makes red plumage a good advertisement to prospective mates. A 2001 field study at Terrick Terrick National Park in Victoria found that males, which had greater reproductive success and were in better condition, moulted into a brighter plumage the following year. However, male age and condition at the time were more likely to predict mating success for the following breeding season. Adult males can breed at one year of age, and may do so while yet in non-breeding plumage, but they are less successful at reproducing at this age. The oldest recorded age is 5 years and 7 months for a bird banded near Beverley, Western Australia, in 1990. A variety of calls have been recorded, described as 'tinkle' and 'blurt' songs. These are similar across mainland Australia but distinct on Rottnest Island; on the isolated island, birds rarely linked successive songs. This species may be confused with the related flame robin (P. phoenicea) and scarlet robin (P. boodang), but the male can be distinguished by its red crown (white in the other two species) and smaller size; furthermore, the male flame robin has dark grey rather than black upperparts.Higgins et al. p. 650. Female and immature birds are harder to distinguish, but can be differentiated by the reddish tinge of the crown and whiter underparts. Distribution and habitat Red-capped Robin in New South Wales The red-capped robin is found across Australia, except for Tasmania, Cape York, the Top End, and most of the Kimberley (there have been occasional sightings in the southernmost parts). Offshore populations exist on Rottnest Island, as well as Greenly and Pearson Islands off the Eyre Peninsula,Boles, p. 85. but it is not found on Kangaroo Island. Although widespread, it is uncommon in many areas; it is rare east of the Great Dividing Range, in coastal regions in the south of the continent, and in the northern parts of its range‚Äîit is seldom encountered north of 20¬∞S.Higgins et al. p. 652. Its movements are generally poorly known, particularly outside the breeding season. It is sedentary in much of the southern parts of its range, although the red-capped robin is a spring and summer visitor to the Nullarbor Plain and Adelaide region in South Australia, and central Victoria. It is a winter visitor in the northern parts of its range. The red-capped robin prefers more arid habitat than its relatives, and inhabits drier areas, while the scarlet robin occupies wetter forests, where they co-occur. The red-capped robin's preferred habitat is dry Acacia, Callitris, or mixed scrubland or woodland, dominated by such species as mulga (Acacia aneura), Georgina gidgee (Acacia georginae), raspberry jam (Acacia acuminata), black cypress-pine (Callitris endlicheri), white cypress-pine (C. columellaris), and slender cypress-pine (C. preissii) with understory shrubs, such as Cassinia, hop-bush (Dodonaea), emu bush (Eremophila), and spinifex (Triodia).Higgins et al. p. 651. =Threats= The species has generally fared badly with human change to the landscape. Once common on the Cumberland Plain in Sydney's western suburbs, it has now almost disappeared from the Sydney Basin. It has also disappeared from the vicinity of Rockhampton in Queensland, and declined on Rottnest Island, and in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. Field studies in small patches of remnant vegetation indicate reduced survival rates there. The feral cat is known to prey on the red-capped robin, and several bird species, including the Australian raven (Corvus coronoides), grey shrike- thrush (Colluricincla harmonica), grey butcherbird (Cracticus torquatus), and white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus) raid nests and take young.Higgins et al. p. 660. There is one record of a brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris) feeding on an egg. Predation is the commonest cause of nest failure. Behaviour Eulo in southwestern Queensland The red-capped robin is generally encountered alone or in pairs, although groups of up to eight birds‚Äîa mated pair and their young‚Äîmay be seen in autumn and winter.Higgins et al. p. 655. The species may join mixed-species flocks with other small insectivorous passerines; species recorded include the willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), rufous whistler (Pachycephala rufiventris) and black-faced woodswallow (Artamus cinereus) in Queensland, and the chestnut-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza uropygialis), buff-rumped thornbill (A. reguloides) or inland thornbill (A. apicalis) in Western Australia. The red-capped robin typically perches in a prominent location low to the ground, often flicking its wings and tail. It is very active and does not stay still for long.Higgins et al. p. 656. The female has been reported as being fairly tame, while the male is more wary of human contact.Boles, p. 90. The red-capped robin is territorial during the breeding season; the area occupied has been measured between 0.25 and 1.2 ha (0.6‚Äì3 acres). A pair lives and forages within their territory before dispersing in autumn. The male proclaims ownership by singing loudly from a suitable perch at the territory boundary, and confronts other males with a harsh scolding call should they make an incursion. Two males have been seen to face one another apart, flicking wings and manoeuvring for position in a threat display, while the female is incubating her eggs. Both sexes also react to the playback of song recordings. The male will also defend against incursions by male scarlet robins, and conversely avoid foraging in the latter species' territories. Most juvenile red-capped robins are unable to live in territories occupied by adult birds, and need to travel to find unoccupied land; the furthest dispersal recorded to date has been , from Terrick Terrick National Park across farmland to Gunbower National Park in northern Victoria. =Breeding= The breeding season takes place over five months from August to January with up to three broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by rubbing his body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone. The nest is a neat, deep cup, made of soft dry grass and bark. Spider webs, feathers, and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork, or sometimes a mistletoe bush. It may be decorated with lichen and camouflaged to blend in with its surroundings. Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish, and splotched with dark grey-brown, are laid on consecutive days, with each egg measuring . Females alone develop brood patches and incubate, although both sexes feed the young. The male will keep lookout either on the nest or perched on a nearby branch, rather than brood, while the female is foraging; and both parents will feed young and dart off quickly, if there are predators in the vicinity.Higgins et al. p. 657. Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, and there is some evidence that extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and covered only by a thin layer of down. By seven days, they are stretching wings and preening, and at two weeks they are able to fly. Parents feed young for at least three weeks after leaving the nest, and have been recorded giving them spiders, and insects, such as flies and moths. Males take over feeding young when females begin renesting for the next brood. In a field study near Cooma, in southern New South Wales, fledglings were observed to disperse from the natal territory after four to six weeks for a single-brood year; and fledglings dispersed in less than a week from the territory of a pair that raised two broods in the season. The long breeding season and multiple broods therein are an adaptation to mild climate and high levels of predation. Despite this, on average, only two young are successfully fledged per year. The brush cuckoo (Cacomantis variolosus), pallid cuckoo (C. pallidus), Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis), and black-eared cuckoo (C. osculans) have been recorded as brood parasites of the red-capped robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own.Boles, p. 86. Red-capped robins have been observed to be particularly aggressive in driving Horsfield's bronze- cuckoos from their territories in Terrick Terrick National Park in a field study, and no nests were found parasitised there. =Feeding= The diet consists of insects and other small arthropods. One study of red-capped robin faeces conducted near Kambalda, Western Australia, revealed 96% of their diet was made up of beetles, while ants made up the remainder. Other prey recorded include spiders, and insects such as grasshoppers, including the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera), adult and larval butterflies and moths, including geometer moths, dragonflies and damselflies, mantises, antlions, true bugs, including chinch bugs of the family Lygaeidae and shield bugs, various types of beetles, earwigs, and flies such as blow-flies and horse-flies. The red-capped robin mostly pounces on prey on the ground, although it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. Less often, it gleans (takes prey while perched) in low-lying vegetation, almost always less than above the ground.Higgins et al. p. 654. The prey is most commonly on the ground when caught, although airborne insects are sometimes taken. A low branch may be used as a vantage point in hunting.

Bedaux was friends with British royalty and Nazis alike, and was a management consultant, big game hunter and explorer. Early years Charles Bedaux was born in the Charenton-le-Pont commune of Paris, France.Steven Kreis, 'Charles E. Bedaux' in American National Biography online Little is known about his early life but his brother Gaston later recorded that in 1903, Charles dropped out of Lyc√©e Jean-Baptiste-Say in Paris where he had been studying engineering. Charles worked a series of menial jobs before befriending Henri Ledoux, a successful pimp from the infamous Pigalle district. The mysterious Ledoux apparently taught Bedaux lessons on proper dress, confidence and street-fighting, but was murdered in 1906.Gaston Bedaux, La Vie Ardente de Charles Bedaux (1959) What is verified is that in 1906, Charles moved to the United States, where he became a United States citizen, married, and had a son, Charles Emile Bedaux (1909‚Äì1993).

Of Bedaux's business empire, Bedaux Britain was particularly lucrative. Here, the Bedaux Unit was so successful that it was copied by industrial firms such as Rowntree's of York (a corporate member of the Taylor Society), Mander Brothers of Wolverhampton, and influential consultancies including Urwick, Orr & Partners. Indeed, Bedaux Britain formed the basis for all four of the 'Big Four' European consultancies in the postwar period: Associated Industrial Consultants (AIC), Urwick, Orr & Partners (UOP), Production-Engineering (P-E) and PA Consulting (PA).Patricia Tisdall, Agents of Change: The Development and Practice of Management Consultancy (London: Heinemann, 1982).Matthias Kipping, 'Consultancies, Institutions and the Diffusion of Taylorism in Britain, Germany and France, 1920s to 1950s', Business History (1997) PDF from Taylor & Francis onlineMichael Ferguson, The Rise of Management Consulting in Britain (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002) In focusing on factory floor and office efficiency issues, the 'Big Four' Bedauxist consultancies were successful across Western Europe until the 1960s, when they were largely overtaken by U.S. consultancies such as McKinsey & Company, whose efforts were in higher-value activities such as strategy and restructuring.'Christopher D. McKenna, The World's Newest Profession: Management Consulting in the Twentieth Century (Cambridge: CUP, 2010). Cambridge University Press The Bedaux Canadian Sub-Arctic Expedition The Bedaux Canadian Sub-Arctic Expedition was the grand title Bedaux gave to the expedition he formed to cross the wilderness of Northern British Columbia, Canada in 1934. Mostly, the expedition was a publicity stunt, but it was also formed to test out the new Citro√´n half-track cars that were being developed by Bedaux's friend Andr√© Citro√´n. Key points in the trip were filmed by Academy Award winning cinematographer from Hollywood, Floyd Crosby, who would later be praised for his work on High Noon. Also along for the trip were several dozen Alberta cowboys and a large film crew.Jay Sherwood, Bannock and Beans: A Cowboy's Account of the Bedaux Expedition (2009) summary To map the route of the expedition, the Canadian government sent along two geographers, Frank Swannell and Ernest Lemarque. The expedition started off at Edmonton, Alberta on 6 July 1934 and their goal was to travel 1500 miles to Telegraph Creek, British Columbia. Much of the trip would have to be made through regions that were relatively uncharted and had no trails. The party failed to reach their destination and the original movie was never made, but in 1995, Canadian director, George Ungar,George Ungar on IMDb produced a television biography of Bedaux incorporating Crosby's footage of the expedition, The Champagne Safari (1995).'The Champagne Safari (1995) on IMDb entry Charles Bedaux hosted the Windsors' wedding in his Ch√¢teau de Cand√©. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor Bedaux purchased the sixteenth-century Ch√¢teau de Cand√©, in France, and lived there with his American second wife, the former Fern Lombard (1892‚Äì1972), a daughter of lawyer James Lombard of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The couple purchased the ch√¢teau in 1927 and renovated it, completing work in 1930. On 3 June 1937, Charles and Fern Bedaux hosted the wedding of Wallis Warfield and Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor at the ch√¢teau. Bedaux later arranged the couple's visit to the Third Reich, where they publicly met the F√ºhrer, Adolf Hitler. The Duke and Duchess's U.S.A. tour The next stage of the trip, the United States, was called off due to labor union, press and public outrage at Bedaux's involvement. He was quickly demonized in the media around the globe. Specifically, the Baltimore Federation of Labor publicly attacked the 'emissaries of dictatorships or uniformed sentimentalists' and called the Bedaux System a 'vicious adaptation of the Taylor System'. From then on, commentators conceptually linked Bedaux and his B system with fascism, and Taylor's remaining supporters, particularly those in the Taylor Society, distanced themselves from Bedaux. The fiasco prompted many employers using the Bedaux System, and those derived from it, to change its terminology to more neutral and administrative language. This goes some way to explain why historical research into the enduring influence of the Bedaux System and its Bedaux Unit has been reported as difficult to undertake.Craig R. Littler, 'The Bureaucratization of the Shop-Floor: the Development of Modern Work Systems' (PhD thesis, London School of Economics, 1980), Vol. 2. Second World War activity When Paris was occupied by the Germans during World War II, Bedaux became acquainted with leading Nazi and Vichy figures. After the fall of France in 1940, he was appointed as an economic advisor to Vichy and the Reich. Bedaux's wife, Fern, and her sister, Eve Duez (Mme Louis S Duez), were interned briefly in Paris during the war but were soon released through their connections to the German government in France.\\"My attention was drawn to a woman who was sitting on the edge of a cot with an ermine wrap around her feet. She was passing around a five-pound box of chocolates to her friends. I learned that she was Mrs. Charles Bedaux, at whose chateau the Duke of Windsor married Mrs. Simpson. Mrs. Bedaux said in a very loud voice that she did not expect to be with us long, and that she was waiting for Otto Abetz, Nazi fifth columnist in France before the war and the new Nazi Ambassador to France, to come and get her and her sister released. Next morning a group of French collaborationists, obviously personages high in treachery, arrived with an important German in uniform. They were very respectful to Mrs. Bedaux, helped her pack her things, and out she swept, while the rest of us were enraged at this exhibition of the power of social and political influence.\\" From The House Near Paris: An American Woman's Story of Traffic in Patriots by Drue Tarti√®re and M R Werner, Simon & Schuster, 1946, page 105. In 1941, Bedaux experimented with a political-economic system of his own invention, Equivalism, in Roquefort, Vichy France. Recent research has shown that the experiments amounted to tinkering which locals hardly noticed.Yves Levant & Marc Nikitin, 'Charles Eug√®ne Bedaux (1886‚Äì1944): ‚Äòcost killer‚Äô or Utopian Socialist?' Accounting, Business & Financial History (2009) Taylor & Francis online Also in 1941, in France, there was a violent coal strike over the Bedaux System in the Nord and Pas de Calais in May and June.Richard Vinen, 'The French Coal Industry during the Occupation' The Historical Journal Vol. 33, No. 1 (1990) Bedaux's German connections were not restricted to Occupied France. In October 1941 he was designated by the sabotage branch of the Abwehr (Abwehr II) to command a covert mission to Persia (Iran) to capture the refinery at Abadan from his former client, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and protect it from Allied bombardment prior to a planned German military invasion of Iraq and Persia.The sheer scale of such an operation would have been enormous, especially since Bedaux contemplated the ‚Äúsanding-up‚Äù (and subsequent ‚Äúde-sanding‚Äù) of not only the Abadan refinery, but also the Mosul oilfield, as well as the 483 km of pipeline between them, not to mention other infrastructure in southwestern Persia. The proposal was indeed first regarded by the Abwehr planners as a ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù plan, and it looked as if it would not gain acceptance. However, Bedaux persisted and succeeded in getting the plan submitted to a panel of experts who, after meticulous examination, pronounced it technically feasible. The scheme was ultimately cancelled by the Abwehr for various reasons. Those that concerned Bedaux himself were: (1) his expertise was confined strictly to his 1938 survey of the refinery, and he knew even less about Persia than the Persians knew about him; (2) Bedaux's age, poor health, lack of military training and experience, lack of petroleum-engineering qualifications, and inability to speak either Persian or German made him a poor choice as commander; (3) Bedaux's inappropriate, grandiose demands, such as being given the full rank of general. By the end of 1942, however, strategic events (e.g. the Second Battle of El Alamein and the Battle of Stalingrad) had rendered the operation unworkable, and Bedaux was dropped by Berlin. The countersabotage plan then became obsolete, though it looked suspicious when Bedaux was later investigated by the FBI and MI5. Despite Bedaux's cultivation of relationships with various Abwehr and Nazi Party officials, declassified National Archives and Records Administration records indicate that Bedaux did not have dealings with the upper echelons of the Party or with officials of the Sicherheitsdienst (SS Security Service). Bedaux's arrest and suicide On 13 January 1943 Bedaux was in Algeria allegedly supervising the construction of a German pipeline when he and his son were arrested by the Americans. He was kept in custody without charge for a year. Bedaux was eventually flown to the US, and, awaiting charges of trading with the enemy and treason, committed suicide using an overdose of barbiturates while in FBI custody in Miami, Florida. His death featured prominently in the contemporary media,'Bedaux Legendary as Mystery Man' New York Times, 20 February 1944 New York Times online archive particularly an influential New Yorker biographical trilogy by Janet Flanner.Brenda Wineapple, Gen√™t: A Biography of Janet Flanner (1992) University of Nebraska Press Here, Flanner attacked the Bedaux System and Bedaux Unit as not differing 'much from the old Frederick Winslow Taylor shop- management system of the nineties' despite Bedaux's verbose claims to originality. Posthumous reputation The circumstances of Bedaux's death and his posthumous influence remain subjects of research inquiry.http://historyguide.org/author1.html Despite his contemporary prominence in the media, and in business and consultancy circles, Bedaux did not feature alongside such figures as F.W. Taylor, Hans Renold and Charles Myers in the Making of Scientific Management trilogy by Lyndall Urwick and E.F.L. Brech.Lyndall Urwick and E.F.L. Brech, The Making of Scientific Management II: Management in British Industry (London: Management Publications Trust, 1949) available at Archive.org He was also not present in Urwick's comprehensive management prosopography The Golden Book of Management.Lyndall Urwick, The Golden Book of Management: A Historical Record of the Life and Work of Seventy Pioneers (1956) It remains controversial as to why. It has also been suggested that, in an attempt to restore Bedaux's reputation, the French government awarded Bedaux a posthumous L√©gion d'honneur on the grounds that he had actually hampered the Germans and guarded Jewish property. More recent research has been unable to prove the existence of this award. A street in Tours, the Avenue Charles Bedaux, was named after Bedaux from 1966-2018.https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/societe/tours-l-avenue-therese- voisin-honore-desormais-une-resistante-a-la-place-du- collabo-1541929915https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2jJYOixPko Charles Bedaux (1886-1944) grave The Ch√¢teau de Cand√© is open to public visitors and is themed around the Duke and Duchess's 1937 wedding. Many of Bedaux's possessions are on display there. Bedaux in popular culture Bedaux's most famous depiction in interwar culture was as a crackpot inventor in Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times who presents a 'Beddoes' or 'Billowes' 'Feeding Machine' to Chaplin's employer. The malfunctioning contraption was then demonstrated on a restrained and tormented Chaplin.Mauro F. Guill√©n, Models of Management: Work, Authority, and Organization in a Comparative Perspective (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1994). In addition, the 'Bedaux belt' featured in George Orwell's Inside the Whale, alongside other items and people, such as Hitler and Stalin, which Orwell saw as indicative of the dark side of the period. Following his death in 1944, Bedaux features by name in Upton Sinclair's 1945 novel Dragon Harvest. Bedaux also appears as a thwarted efficiency expert, Monsieur Bedou of Ratio Ltd., in Pierre Boulle's Sacrilege in Malaya (1951).http://www.prrb.ca/issues/prrb-issue06.pdf Conspiracy theories Several conspiracy theories surround Bedaux's life and death. They usually situate Bedaux as a conduit between the Nazi and British elites, who facilitated important events in World War Two such as the fall of France and the alleged murder of Heinrich Himmler by British intelligence operatives.Martin Allen, Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies (London: Macmillan, 2000)Martin Allen, The Hitler/Hess Deception: British Intelligence's Best-Kept Secret of the Second World War (London: HarperCollins, 2003)Martin Allen, Himmler's Secret War: the Covert Peace Negotiations of Heinrich Himmler (London: Robson, 2005) These stories stem both from contemporary sensationalist media stories following Bedaux's well- publicised suicide and in publications which followed the FBI's release of the Bedaux files in the early 1980s.Peter Allen, The Crown and the Swastika: Hitler, Hess, and the Duke of Windsor (London: Hale, 1983) Google BooksCharles Higham, Trading with the Enemy: an Expos√© of the Nazi-American Money Plot 1933-1949 (London: Hale, 1983) Goodreads These claims have been subject to recent investigation.Ernst Haiger, 'Fiction, Facts, and Forgeries: the ‚ÄúRevelations‚Äù of Peter and Martin Allen about the History of the Second World War' Journal of Intelligence History Vol. 6 (2006) Journal of Intelligence History Between 2005 and 2008 this issue was compounded by the discovery that key elements of Martin Allen's Hidden Agenda trilogy were based on twenty-nine forgeries located in the UK National Archives.Ben Fenton, 'Lies And Secrets' Financial Times, 3 May 2008 Financial Times online'The 29 Fakes Behind a Rewriting of History' The Guardian, 5 May 2008 The Guardian online'Forgeries revealed in the National Archives' The Sunday Times, 4 May 2008 The Sunday Times onlinehttps://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16525https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listenagain/listenagain_20050702.shtml These forged papers explicitly implicated Bedaux high in the elite echelons of the Third Reich.

A veteran of World War I, he was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. Mummert surrendered to the Soviets in May 1945 and died in a prisoner of war camp five years later. Biography Born in Saxony, Mummert volunteered for the army of Imperial Germany in 1914, upon the outbreak of the First World War. He was commissioned a reserve leutnant (lieutenant) two years later and was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd Class, a Prussian decoration. He left the army after the end of the war but in 1936 he joined the Heer (Army) branch of the Wehrmacht. Initially posted to the 11th Infantry Regiment as a leutnant, Mummert transferred to 10th Cavalry Regiment in 1938 with the rank of Rittmeister (captain of cavalry). In 1939, he was appointed commander of AA.256, an Aufkl√§rungsabteilung (reconnaissance unit) attached to an infantry division. =World War II= Mummert participated in the Wehrmacht's early campaigns of World War II and by mid-1940, he had been awarded the Iron Cross as well as a Clasp to the Iron Cross, both awards instituted by Nazi Germany. In January 1942, having been promoted to major, he was awarded the German Cross in Gold. Later that year he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Mummert later led the 14th Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion of the reformed 14th Panzer Division, the original having been destroyed in the Battle of Stalingrad. His leadership style often saw him on the frontlines with his infantry and engaged in close combat, and he received several badges in recognition of this; the Panzer Badge and Close Combat Clasp, both in bronze, as well as the Tank Destruction Badge for Individual Combatants. He was given command of the 14th Panzer Division's 103rd Panzer Grenadier Regiment in January 1944. Promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel), he was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross. Nine months later, and now an oberst (colonel), he briefly led the 14th Panzer Division as its temporary commander. In October 1944, he was awarded the Swords to the Knight's Cross, the 107th recipient of this award. In January 1945, Mummert took command of the newly formed Panzer Division M√ºncheberg and was promoted to generalmajor (equivalent to the rank of brigadier general in the United States Army) on 1 February. His new unit, which was beginning to assemble in the area west of Berlin, was a division in name only and had relatively few armoured vehicles. It was activated in March 1945 and dispatched to the Eastern Front and defended Soviet attempts to cross the Oder River. It later fought in the Battle of Seelow Heights and had to gradually withdraw into Berlin and was engaged in fighting around the Zoobunker and the Tiergarten. Following the destruction of the last of his division's tanks near the Brandenburg Gate, Mummert was wounded on 1 May. Despite this he remained in command until his surrender to the Soviets on 4 May. After the war, he was held in a prisoner of war camp in Russia where he died in 1950.

It was fought by the Clan Cameron against the Clan Mackay and the Clan Munro. Contemporary evidence Little is known of the events concerning the Battle of Achnashellach as there is little contemporary evidence to support it. However the Clan Munro records that \\"Sir William Munro of Foulis was sent to Lochaber on the King's business and was killed in an engagement between the Camerons and MacKays at a place called Achnashellach in 1505\\". Aside from this there is little evidence of the battle, however it is Clan Cameron tradition that they defeated a joint force of Munros and Mackays. Accounts of the battle =17th and 18th century manuscripts= Alexander Munro of Obsdale (c.1600 - 1649) Alexander Munro who was a cadet of the Munro of Obsdale branch of the Clan Munro wrote a birth brief to Charles I of England in the 17th century which mentions his ancestor William Munro of Foulis and states that he was killed by treachery. This birth brief was published in Alexander Mackenzie's History of the Munros of Fowlis in 1898 and states: William Munro of Foulis, plainly a knight most valiant for leading an army at the command of the King against certain factious northern men, he perished by treachery. Andrew Munro of Coul (1717) Andrew Munro of Coul wrote an MS History of the Munros in about 1717 which was published in 1805 in the book Chronological and Genealogical Account of the Ancient and Honorable Family of the Fowlis. This has a brief account of the skirmish stating that Munro was killed by Cameron and that: the house was surrounded and refused to surrender. =19th century publications= Memoirs of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel (1842) The memoirs of Ewen Cameron of Lochiel (d.1719) were published in 1842 and in the author's introduction chapter, which gives a history of the Clan Cameron, the following is mentioned regarding the feud between the Camerons against the Mackays and Munros during the chiefship of Ewen Cameron of Lochiel (d.1546). Besides the other wars wherein Locheill was engaged, he had also a ruffle with the Barron of Rea, Chief of the Mackays, a people living many miles north of Lochaber. What the quarrall was, I know not, but it drew on an invasion from the Camerons, and that ane engagement wherein the Mackays were defeated, and the Laird of Foules, Chief of the Monros, who assisted them, killed upon the spot. Donald Gregory (1881) Donald Gregory's (d.1836) book History of the Western Highlands and Isles of Scotland from AD 1493 to AD 1625 which was published in 1881, with quoted source, gives an insight into the circumstances in Scotland, in the years prior to the battle: A.D.1502: A commission was afterwards given to the Earl of Huntly, the Lord Lovat, and William Munro of Fowlis to proceed to Lochaber and let the King's lands of Lochaber and Mamore, for the space of five years, to true men. At the same time, the commissioners had strict instructions to expel all broken men from these districts, which, in the state of affairs at that time, was equivalent to an order to expel the whole population. Similar directions were given relative to the lands forfeited by MacLeod of Lewis. Alexander Mackenzie (1898) Alexander Mackenzie wrote an account of the Battle of Achnashellach in his book History of the Munros of Fowlis in 1898. Mackenzie quote's Gregory's book for the events of 1502 as already mentioned above, and the Lochiel Memoirs also given above. Sir William is said to have been killed in the prime of his life, in 1505, at a place called Achnashellach or Achnaskellach, in Lochaber, by Ewen \\"MacAlein Mhic Dhom'huill Duibh\\", XIII. of Lochiel, in a raid which is thus described in Lochiels Memoirs. Besides the other wars wherein Lochiel was engaged, he had also a ruffle with Baron of Reay, Chief of the MacKays, a people living many miles north of Lochaber. What the quarrel was I know not, but it drew on an invasion from the Camerons, and that an engagement wherein the MacKays were defeated and the Laird of Fowlis, Chief of the Munros, who assisted them, was killed upon the spot. In 1502 a Royal Commission had been given to the Earl of Huntly, Thomas fourth Lord Lovat, and Sir William Munro of Fowlis, to proceed to Lochaber and let the King's lands of Lochaber and Mamore for the space of five years to true men, and this is what probably led to the raid and the collision with the Camerons in which Sir William was slain. =20th - 21st century publications= John Stewart of Ardvorlich (1974) John Stewart of Ardvorlich wrote a brief account of the events surrounding the Battle of Achnashellach in his book The Camerons, A History of Clan Cameron, without quoting a source: There is tradition that the Clan Cameron took part in an expedition to the country of the Mackays in Sutherlandshire and that they defeated a joint force of Munros and Mackays but the object of this enterprise is not clear. Sir William Munro of Foulis was Justiciary and Lieutenant of Inverness and the Earldom of Ross. In 1505 he was killed by \\"Ewen McAllan Vicoldui\\" at Achnashellach. As Ewen MacAllan (Cameron) had supported the rebellion of Donald Dubh in 1503 and as Achnashellach is only 12 miles from the Castle of Strome in Lochalsh, which he was constable, it seems likely that Ewen was acting in support of Donald Dubh when Munro was killed. Alister Farquhar Matheson (2014) Clan Cameron tartan in the Clan Munro exhibition at the Storehouse of Foulis Alister Farquhar Matheson writing in 2014, but with no quoted source gives more details of the battle. According to Matheson the Earl of Huntly, who was James IV of Scotland's commander in the north, called on his deputy, Sir William Munro of Foulis to lead a punitive expedition against the rebel MacDonalds of Lochalsh. The Mackays of Strathnaver demonstrating their loyalty to the king, joined Sir William Munro's force. There is also a tradition that the Clan Sutherland contributed a regiment as the Earl of Huntly's son, Adam was married to Elizabeth, the heiress to the earldom of Sutherland. Ewen Cameron, chief of Clan Cameron was hereditary constable of Strome Castle on behalf of the MacDonalds and he gathered a force to protect the lands of MacDonald of Lochalsh. Matheson tradition is that one of Cameron's officers was Alasdair MacRuairidh, chieftain of the Clan Matheson North who crossed the narrows of Loch Carron with men from Fernaig and Strathascaig and joined the gathering of armed rebels. Cameron marched to the eastern borders of Lochcarron, at Achnashellach where the valley of Carron begins to narrow into Glen Carron which is steeper sided. At this location he laid an ambush to such good effect that William Munro's army was put to flight and Munro himself was slain in the action. This defeat was however only a temporary set back for Huntly's campaign and soon Strome Castle's garrison was forced to surrender. Aftermath William Munro of Foulis left two sons, Hector and William. The eldest, Hector Munro took over as chief and had extensive lands confirmed to him by King James V of Scotland at Stirling and was made the Royal Lieutenant of Western Ross-shire as his father was before him. Hector Munro, I of Erribol who was a cadet of the Munros of Foulis was made constable of Strome Castle for the MacDonalds of Glengarry. Previously, Ewen Cameron had been constable of Strome Castle for the MacDonalds of Lochalsh. Ewen Cameron was executed in 1546.

Brady.Brady, J. V. (1958). Ulcers in executive monkeys. Scientific American, 199(4), 95-100. Method of the experiment In an early version of the study, Brady placed monkeys in 'restraining chairs' and conditioned them to press a lever.Brady, J. V., Porter, R. W., Conrad, D. G., & Mason, J. W. (1958). Avoidance behavior and the development of duodenal ulcers. Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 1(1), 69‚Äì72. They were given electric shocks every 20 seconds unless they pressed the lever during the same time period. This study came to an abrupt halt when many of the monkeys died from perforated ulcers. To test this Brady used a yoked control monkey. He placed an 'Executive Monkey' in the restraining chair, which could press the lever to prevent the electric shock. The yoked monkey had no control over the lever, leaving only the 'Executive' with the psychological stress of pushing the lever. Results After 23 days of a continuous 6 hours on, 6 hours off schedule of electric shocks, the executive monkey died. Brady then tried various schedules, but no monkeys died from this. He then returned to the original 6 on, 6 off, and tested the stomachs of the Executives and found that their stomach acidity was greatest during the rest period. The greatest danger occurred when the sympathetic arousal stopped and the stomach was flooded with digestive hormones. This was a parasympathetic rebound associated with the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which led to the development of ulcers in the Executive monkeys. In all the variations of the experiment, no yoked control monkey ever developed an ulcer. This suggests that the ulcers were a symptom of the excessive stress induced by having control. Hans Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome proposes a similar effect in the Exhaustion phase.

During the interview, she asked pressing questions about the works of Berlusconi's administration, often interrupting the Prime Minister's statements, which annoyed him to the point that he stood up and left the room halfway through the program, thus cutting short the interview. The political control board of RAI accused Annunziata of violating the Par Condicio, since that law states the interviewer should keep to a neutral stance during political interviews. She resigned from her job as executive editor of RAI in protest for Berlusconi's conflict of interest.

It was part of the Transit City proposal announced March 16, 2007, to be operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). It was expected to cost approximately $675 million, with construction to begin in 2012, and an expected opening in 2016. It would have been the fifth of the seven Transit City lines to be complete after the Sheppard East, Finch West, Waterfront West, and Eglinton lines. Ridership was estimated to be 21.2 million trips in 2021. Mayor Rob Ford cancelled the line after taking office in December 2010.Mayor Rob Ford: ‚ÄúTransit City is over‚Äù Toronto Life December 1, 2010 While LRT lines on Sheppard East, Finch West, and Eglinton were revived through a new agreement between the City of Toronto and Metrolinx, the Don Mills LRT was not included. The 925 Don Mills Express bus follows a similar routing to the proposed LRT. The Don Mills LRT is still included in Metrolinx's regional transportation plan The Big Move under the 15-year horizon. Metrolinx has also completed a detailed benefits case analysis for the Relief Line, exploring the potential of constructing a subway instead of the Don Mills LRT to Don Mills station. Route layout According to initial Toronto Transit Commission planning, the Don Mills LRT line would run for 17.6 km between Steeles Avenue and Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth. The LRT would operate via Don Mills Road from the north, and then turn east along Overlea Boulevard through the community of Thorncliffe Park. South of Thorncliffe Park, the TTC was examining three different alignments for the LRT to connect to the Line 2 subway, prior to cancellation of the project:UrbanToronto forums - TTC: Jane LRT - Post #880309 * Pape Avenue, via the Leaside Bridge, to station; * Broadview Avenue, via the Leaside Bridge, to station; * Bayview Avenue, via Millwood Road and Southdale Drive, to station. The Big Move proposes that the Don Mills LRT run along Pape Avenue to Pape station. It also proposes that the LRT stretch north past Steeles Avenue, along Leslie Street to Highway 7 in York Region. =Proposed stops/stations= The TTC did not indicate specific stops at the time of planning. The Big Move indicates that the line would intersect mobility hubs at Eglinton, , Steeles, and Highway 407, and facilitate transfers to the Eglinton Crosstown line, Line 4 Sheppard, the Sheppard East LRT, an LRT or BRT line on Steeles, the 407 Transitway, and the Highway 7 Rapidway. =Relief Line= The Don Mills LRT is proposed to connect to the Relief Line (formerly Downtown Relief Line) at Line 2, which is proposed to help reduce current and projected congestion in downtown Toronto. Metrolinx, the City of Toronto, York Region and the TTC partnered on the Yonge Relief Network Study (YRNS) in 2015, which examined options for providing relief on the Yonge line. This included three different versions of the Relief Line, and a surface LRT similar to the Don Mills LRT. The YRNS found that a subway between downtown and Sheppard Avenue would provide the most effective relief on the Yonge line. Pursuing this option would truncate the LRT south of Sheppard, and replace it with a subway.

He was the president of the Pontifical Council for the Family (1981-1983), a prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (1974 and 1983) and the fifth Archbishop of Melbourne, serving from 1967 to 1974. Early years Knox was born in Bayswater, Western Australia. He was a son of Irish‚Äìborn John Knox and his wife Alice Emily, n√©e Walsh. Attending Catholic schools in Perth, Knox applied to the archdiocese to study for the priesthood, but was rejected because it was cheaper to recruit and educate priests in Ireland. He successfully applied to become a priest at the Benedictine Territorial Abbey of New Norcia and completed his secondary schooling at St Ildephonsus' College before entering the seminary in 1936. By September that year, he transferred to the Pontifical Urbanian Athenaeum in Rome. Ordained priest on 22 December 1941, he pursued postgraduate studies, obtaining doctorates in theology (1944) and canon law (1949). Unable to return to Australia during World War II, he had been assigned to Propaganda College staff, becoming a vice-rector in 1945. He served as a staff member of the Vatican Secretariat of State from 1948 until 1950. He was also a staff member of Vatican Radio for a year between 1949 and 1950 and appointed to the rank of monsignor on 22 July 1950. He was Secretary to the Apostolic Delegate in Japan from 1950 until 1953. Episcopate Pius XII appointed him Titular Archbishop of Melitene and apostolic delegate in British Africa on 20 July 1953. He was consecrated in November that year in Rome by Cardinal Celso Costantini. He was Internuncio in India and apostolic delegate in Burma and Ceylon from 1957 where he was involved with the expansion of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity. He attended the Second Vatican Council in Rome. On 13 April 1967, with no direct pastoral experience, Knox was appointed as the fifth Archbishop of Melbourne. Following decrees of the Second Vatican Council, in 1970 Knox approved the extension of St Patrick's Cathedral's sanctuary into the transept crossing to provide the space required for the reformed liturgical rites. The new sanctuary worked admirably for the many ceremonies of the 40th International Eucharistic Congress held in Melbourne in February 1973. Knox reorganised the structure of the archdiocese, establishing four regions headed by auxiliary bishops, the creation of 12 archdiocesan departments headed by episcopal vicars as well as the establishment of a Senate of Priests and other advisory bodies. During his episcopacy as archbishop, Knox was also instrumental in the creation of the Melbourne College of Divinity and later, some of the constituent parts which became the Australian Catholic University. Cardinal On 5 March 1973, Paul VI named Knox Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Vallicella. In early 1974, Knox was appointed prefect of both the Congregations for the Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and took up his appointment in March of that year in Rome. On 1 July 1974 his resignation of the pastoral episcopacy of Melbourne was accepted. By 1975 Knox had merged both congregations. He was appointed in 1973 as president of the Permanent Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses. In 1978, he took part in the August and October conclaves which elected both John Paul I and John Paul II respectively. In 1981, John Paul II appointed Knox as the inaugural president of the reconstituted Pontifical Council for the Family, replacing the Pontifical Committee for the Family. In 1982 his health declined and in May 1983 he became seriously ill with a circulatory problem. He died, aged 69, on 26 June that year in Rome and was buried in the crypt of St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne. A 1974 portrait of Knox by Melbourne artist Paul Fitzgerald is held by the cathedral.
