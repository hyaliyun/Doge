He was a battalion commander and the third man in the military dictatorship after D√©si Bouterse and Roy Horb. He was known as \\"the executioner of Fort Zeelandia\\". Life Like D√©si Bouterse, Bhagwandas was educated in the Netherlands where he rose to sergeant and was trained at the Royal Military School in Weert. He then went to work in the Dutch military. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, he returned with a number of other Surinamese soldiers to work for the new Surinamese Armed Forces (Dutch: Surinaamse Krijgsmacht) (SKM). Coup d'√©tat Along with fifteen others, Bhagwandas took part in a coup d'√©tat (the Sergeants' Coup) in Suriname on 25 February 1980. Discontent had increased among the general public, so Bhagwandas suggested taking action stating, at a meeting of the military in early December, that it was necessary to do something drastic to save the \\"revolution\\". Over the following days it was decided to arrest a number of opponents of the military dictatorship. Bhagwandas was in charge of the arrests and the internment of these individuals in Fort Zeelandia. December murders The December Murders of fifteen objectors to the new regime took place over the period between 7‚Äì9 of December, 1982. Reportedly after the arrests, Bouterse went to his office and gave Bhagwandas the order to bring him the captives one by one. Bhagwandas was reported to have been present when Bouterse made the decision to execute each of the captives and was himself involved in the execution of at least two of the hostages who were then carried out by Bouterse. When Bouterse suggested that one of the hostages be spared, (trade unionist Fred Derby), it was Bhagwandas who disagreed, stating that they should all be killed. He was also present at the remaining executions which took place on the inner courtyard of the barracks. Football coach Bhagwandas left the military in the mid- eighties and became involved with the Surinamese Football Association (Dutch: Surinaamse Voetbal Bond) (SVB). The Andr√© Kamperveen Stadion, named after Andr√© Kamperveen, a prominent Surinamese football player, sports administrator, politician and businessman, murdered in the December murders, is where Bhagwandas took the position of coach of the Suriname national football team in 1989. In 1993, Voetbal International published an article about the Surinamese football coach. Henri Does of the Surinamese organization SAWO wrote the following: Translation: Declaration and death Henri Behr, brother of murdered journalist Bram Behr, visited Bhagwandas in his house shortly before he died in 1996, and Bhagwandas admitted to having been involved in the murder of his brother. According to Behr, Bhagwandas stated that Bouterse himself was present, and that he had murdered Surendre Rambocus and Cyrill Daal. Behr secretly recorded part of the conversation, and turned the tape over to the (now deceased) chairman of the Surinamese human rights organization OGV (Organisatie voor Gerechtigheid en Vrede - Organization for Justice and Peace). The tape has since been lost. Bhagwandas died of cancer in 1996.

Sleeping habits Syrian hamsters have a sleep cycle that lasts about 10 to 12 minutes. In the laboratory, Syrian hamsters are observed to be nocturnal and in their natural circadian rhythm they wake and sleep on a consistent schedule. In all kinds of laboratory settings hamsters do 80% of their routine activities at night. Hamsters are most active early in the night, then become less active as the night passes. A study of Syrian hamsters in the wild found that they were active in the daytime, which is a surprising difference from behavior in the laboratory. The sleeping behavior of wild hamsters is not well understood. Reproduction The female Syrian hamster has anatomic features that are unique from other animals. They mature between 8-10 weeks of age and have a 4-day estrous cycle. Female Syrian hamsters show mate preference before they engage in copulation by displaying vaginal marking, known to solicit males. She often chooses to mate with an alpha male, who will flank mark (a scent-marking behaviour associated with aggression and competition) more frequently than any subordinate males present. Male offspring are at higher risk than female offspring of enduring effects from maternal social stress. In the presence of a dominant pregnant female, subordinate pregnant female hamsters have the ability to reabsorb or spontaneously abort their young (most often males) in utero. The subordinate females produce smaller litters overall, and any male offspring they do produce will be smaller in size than those that were produced by the dominant female. After a mother hamster gives birth, normal behavior from the mother in the postpartum period can include establishing a maternal bond with the babies, the mother being aggressive to protect the babies, or infanticide in rodents of the mother to her young. The male Syrian hamster has a requirement for both hormonal cues and chemosensory cues in order to engage in copulation. Further, the integration of steroid cues (i.e. testosterone) and odour cues (relayed through the olfactory bulb) is crucial for mating. It has also been shown that within the medial amygdala, the anterior and posterior regions work together to process the stimuli (odors), showing that their mating behaviour relies on the main olfactory system's communication to nuclei in the amygdala regions. Their behaviour has demonstrated this phenomenon, as they are attracted to the odor of female hamster's vaginal discharge. Males have even demonstrated mounting behaviour on other males who are scented with the female vaginal discharge. When one male and two females are placed in the same environment, the male is likely to engage in copulation with both females as it provides him with a reproductive advantage. In all observed scenarios where there was one male and two females, he did not demonstrate preference for either female and engaged in copulation with both the females present. There has been no reproductive disadvantage to the female when another female is present, other than decreased stimulation as compared to a one-male one-female situation. Interactions with others Syrian hamsters acquire learned helplessness when they are bullied a few times by larger animal. Syrian hamsters can regain lost confidence when some time passes without experiencing bullying. Interactions between male and female Syrian hamsters are influenced by the estrous cycle - in addition, their behaviour changes over the course of the 4-day cycle. Parameters for interactions that have been studied include sniffing, approaching, leaving, and following each other (male/female pair). Specific to the male hamster, his response to the female can be measured by mounting behaviour, intromission and ejaculation. Under semi-natural conditions, the mating behaviours of male and female hamsters were observed during the 4-day period of estrous. When they were allowed free interaction, females displayed lordosis in their own living area 93% of the time, where after 60 minutes of copulation the male would be driven out by the female while she retrieved his food supply and forced him into a corner farthest away from her nest via displays of aggressive behaviour. When a Syrian hamster is introduced to a stranger hamster in its own cage, they perform a standard sequence of acts and postures (also known as a fixed action pattern) that are agonistic by nature. It has been observed that one hamster becomes the dominant and the other becomes submissive, as shown by their posture. The stranger hamster was observed to be the dominant in the majority of situations, and the resident hamster was the submissive.  Feeding behaviour  Food-anticipatory activity (FAA), meaning increased locomotion due to restricted feeding schedules (often found in laboratory settings), is a behaviour seen in many rodents. The Syrian hamster is one of only few exceptions to this activity. It has been found that the arcuate nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, and dorsomedial nucleus are all involved in the presence of FAA, and that Syrian hamsters in the laboratory do not demonstrate FAA because of the presence of light and the typical light cycles used in experiments. In a study of their food-hoarding behaviour, Syrian hamsters were given a limited access to food and expected to consume more in each sitting than they typically would. Instead, they exhibited hoarding behaviour where they took the food during the given time period and continuously ate the food that they hoarded as though they were on a free-fed schedule. This allowed them to maintain typical body weight, and mimic the adaptive feeding strategies they may use in their natural habitats. Females have shown signs of anorexia and anxiety when separated from social interactions. Social separation of hamsters has a bias toward females, thus providing a model for the differences between sexes when experiencing anorexia and anxiety in their adulthood.  Laboratory behaviour  Although most all hamsters display wire- gnawing behaviour in all laboratory cage sizes, it has been shown that the more restricted the cage size, the more their gnawing behaviour increases.K Fischer, SG Gebhardt-Henrichand & A Steiger (2007). Behaviour of golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) kept in four different cage sizes. Animal Welfare. Additionally, hamsters in smaller cages used the roof of their house as a platform more often than those in a larger cage which may suggest that they are trying to create more space for themselves within their cage. In another study, the bedding depth of hamsters and its influence on their stress and wire-gnawing behaviour was tracked by assigning 3 groups different bedding depths - 10 cm, 40 cm, and 80 cm. This is due to the natural instinct that laboratory rodents have to dig. Hamsters who had the 10 cm deep bedding showed significantly more wire-gnawing than any others, and the 80 cm deep bedding group demonstrated no wire-gnawing behaviour. This research demonstrates the importance of having enough bedding for the hamsters to indulge their natural tendencies and have enough material to dig. The behaviour and responses of Syrian hamsters have been observed and tested for a variety of medical-related studies as well, such as the development of the palate and incidence of cleft palate, the influence of retinoic acid on physical malformations in fetuses, immune responses to diseases like hookworm, and the effects of ingesting ethanol solution on liver composition and fatty acid accumulation.

It trains and organizes an interprofessional network of care providers and trainees - doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physician assistants and others. It is inspired by what a 2009 report by the Network for Excellence in Health Innovation (NEHI) described as a crisis in primary care delivery: an increased demand on primary care by older, sicker patients and decreased supply of primary care practitioners. Evidence shows primary care provides better care at lower cost, yet when compared to medical specialty disciplines it is funded less in the United States than any other developed country. Primary care providers are generally overworked and underpaid compared to specialists, and many are disillusioned. This has resulted in fewer and fewer students choosing primary care training, and many providers retiring early or switching careers. In response, PCP offers a community for primary care providers, trainees and faculty to connect and support each other. It provides relational leadership development training and coaching for building health care teams, improving primary care delivery and organizing for change. PCP focuses on students and trainees through its network of over 50 chapters at health professions institutions around the country. Chapters initiatives range from launching student-run free clinics, to changing curriculums, to organizing their local primary care community. PCP partners with Jeffrey Brenner‚Äôs Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers and the Association of American Medical Colleges on the Interprofessional Student Hotspotting Project, an initiative providing teams of health professions students with the knowledge and opportunity to work with high-risk patients to improve their care.  Media coverage  In 2010, PCP president and co-founder Dr. Andrew Morris-Singer discussed on CNN the crisis in primary care and what is being done to address it. PCP‚Äôs role in the creation of Harvard Medical School‚Äôs Center for Primary Care - which included a series of town hall meetings with hundreds of attendees - was described in a Harvard Gazette article. In 2011, PCP was featured in the American College of Physicians‚Äô IMpact Newsletter as a ‚Äúnew national organization dedicated to engaging local communities to promote primary care, innovate in care delivery and prepare the next generation of leaders in primary care‚Äù by ‚Äúbuilding a grassroots network of advocates who share the vision of a health care system built on a robust foundation of primary care.‚Äù In 2012, President Morris-Singer wrote a blog post for KevinMD.com calling for a primary care ‚Äúworkforce surge,‚Äù and another for the Health Care Blog on revitalizing the primary care training ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù through a multifaceted approach to overcome the financial, academic, cultural and political challenges. He was also featured in a New York Times article on initiatives encouraging students to consider primary care careers. Representing PCP, in 2013 Dr. Morris-Singer was a panelist for a Congressional briefing on primary care. PCP was also featured in 2013 articles on the primary care crisis by the Associated Press and the Association of Health Care Journalists. In 2014, MedPage Today published a piece about Primary Care Progress‚Äô grassroots efforts, while the Atlantic‚Äôs story ‚ÄúWhy I‚Äôm Becoming a Primary Care Doctor‚Äù included insight from President Morris-Singer on the stigmatization of primary care careers. New England Public Radio highlighted the work of PCP in two 2015 pieces about the future of primary care.

Mathis Company, of Camden, New Jersey Hull #124, and measures 172 feet long.http://shipbuildinghistory.com/shipyards/small/mathis.htm She is a rare surviving example of a \\"bell boat,\\" a ship controlled from the engine room with telegraph signals sent from the bridge.What's a bell boat? The tanker shipped various fuel products along East Coast and was at center of United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., a pivotal 1975 Supreme Court decision in maritime law after she ran aground in Rockaway Inlet in 1968. She was in active service until 1994.

She was one of the best two-year-old fillies of her generation in Britain in 2011 when she was unbeaten in three races of increasing importance. After winning a minor race on her debut she won the Group Two May Hill Stakes and the Group One Fillies' Mile. In the following spring she finished last when fancied for the 1000 Guineas after which she failed a drug test. She never raced again and was retired from racing. Background Lyric of Light is a bay mare with a white star and snip and three white socks bred in the United Kingdom by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley. Her sire, Street Cry was a top- class performer on dirt who won the Dubai World Cup in 2002 before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other progeny included Zenyatta, Street Sense, Shocking, Whobegotyou and Winx. Her dam Suez showed good form in a brief racing career, winning the Dick Poole Fillies' Stakes and finishing second in the Cheveley Park Stakes from three starts in 2004. She was a granddaughter of Reprocolor, a broodmare whose other descendants have included Opera House and Kayf Tara. During her racing career, Lyric of Light raced in the colours of Godolphin and was trained by Mahmood Al Zarooni. Racing career =2011: two-year-old season= On her first racecourse appearance, Lyric of Light was ridden by Mickael Barzalona when she was one of eleven fillies to contest a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 26 August. Starting at odds of 6/1 she tracked the leaders before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Diala with the favourite Shada in third. Two weeks later the filly was moved up in class and distance for the Group Two May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse, with Frankie Dettori taking over from Barzalona. She was made the 9/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Fallen For You, Regal Realm (winner of the Prestige Stakes) and Samitar (Albany Stakes). She was held up towards the rear of the eight-runner field before beginning to make progress three furlongs from the finish. Lyric of Light took the lead a furlong out but hung to the right in the closing stages before staying on to win by a neck from Fallen For You. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into possible interference between the winner and the runner-up but allowed the result to stand. After the race Dettori commented \\"She's only run the once and there was a big crowd here today. When I went for her she went right and I tried to steer her as much as I could without interfering with [William Buick on Fallen For You]. She's got a lot of class and won with her ears pricked. Mahmood's liked her and this was a big jump from her maiden, but the signs are she's good filly\\". Zarooni stated that the filly would be moved up to Group One level for her next start mentioning the Prix Marcel Boussac and the Fillies' Mile as likely targets. Lyric of Light made her third and final appearance of the season in the Group One Fillies' Mile on good to firm ground at Newmarket on 23 September. With Dettori again in the saddle she was made the 2/1 favourite with Fallen For You and the Roger Varian-trained Firdaws joint-second choices on 3/1 and Samitar being the best-fancied of the other five runners. Samitar went to the front from the tart with Lyric of Light, as at Doncaster, being held up at the back of the field before beginning to make ground just after half way. The favourite moved alongside Samitar a furlong out and the pair drew away from the opposition, with Lyric of Light gaining the advantage in the final strides to win by a head. Firdaws was four and a half length back in third, just ahead of the outsider Salford Act. Zarooni commented \\"I don't think she liked the ground ‚Äì Frankie felt she wasn't happy on it and it was only because she is a good filly that she won.\\" Dettori, who celebrated with a flying dismount, said \\"She's a superstar of a filly and only does what she has to do. She got very unbalanced coming down into the dip, but I managed to collar Jamie (Spencer) in the last 50 yards. I had a good idea my head was in front, but you never know until the judge calls your number\\". =2012: three-year-old season= Lyric of Light made her three-year-old debut in the 199th running of the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket on 6 May and started the 8/1 fourth favourite behind Maybe, Mashoora (Prix Imprudence) and Moonstone Magic (Fred Darling Stakes). After racing in mid-division she weakened badly from half way and was eased down by Dettori to finish last of the seventeen runners behind Homecoming Queen. The filly was officially disqualified after a post-race urine test revealed traces of the banned painkiller Propoxyphene. Al Zarooni later was given an eight-year ban for multiple doping offences. Lyric of Light never raced again and was retired from racing at the end of the year to become a broodmare for Darley Stud.

Alderney and Sark are separate dependencies of the Crown within the Bailiwick of Guernsey, whose legislatures‚Äîthe States of Alderney (Les Etats d'Aurigny) and Chief Pleas of Sark have the power of primary legislation. Alderney and Sark have their own legal systems which, whilst very similar to Guernsey's and having the same origins, do differ in significant aspects, such as inheritances. The States of Guernsey however, may only legislate for Alderney and Sark with consent - there is no freestanding power so to do. This is normally only done when it is necessary to enact legislation for matters that are common to the Bailiwick as a whole (such as financial regulation or the transposition of UK and European legislation into the domestic law of all three jurisdictions). Examples of this are the Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law and the Human Rights (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law. Guernsey has almost complete autonomy over internal affairs and certain external matters. However, the Crown - that is to say, the UK Government - retains an ill-defined reserved power to intervene in the domestic affairs of any of the five Crown Dependencies within the British Islands \\"in the interests of good government\\". The UK Parliament is also a source of Guernsey law for those matters which are reserved to the UK, which are defence and foreign affairs. An example of such a law is the Immigration Act 1971.  Sources of law  Derived by the customary power of the monarch to lay down the law. In Guernsey's case the monarch is the successor to the dukes of Normandy. = Royal Charters = The Royal Charters, going back to 1341 set out the rights and privileges of the people in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. = Law enacted in Guernsey =  Orders in Council  The deliberative assembly of the States of Guernsey () is called the States of Deliberation (). The Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff preside in the assembly. After a draft law has been made public, the members of the States discuss the proposed Projet de Loi, which is the equivalent of a UK Bill or a French projet de loi, and a Law is the equivalent of a UK Act of Parliament or a French loi. A draft Law passed by the States can have no legal effect until formally approved by Her Majesty in Council and promulgated by means of an Order in Council. Laws are given the Royal Sanction at regular meetings of the Privy Council in London, after which they are returned to the Islands for formal registration at the Royal Court. Sanction can be delayed for years, or refused, however rules have developed over the centuries to avoid a constitutional crisis. There is a proposal that the Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey should be granted the power of Royal Assent to enable laws to be granted approval within six weeks if no objection was raised rather than refer every law to London. \\"At present there is a situation where Channel Island law-making depends, ultimately, on the UK government of the day, unelected by the islands.\\"  Ordinances  The States also make delegated legislation known as Ordinances (Ordonnances) and Orders (Ordres) which do not require the Royal Assent. Commencement orders are usually in the form of Ordinances. Since 1948 Ordinances no longer have a one-year time limit, they are permanent.  Statutory Instruments  Secondary legislation, such as laws relating to rubbish collection and data protection laws. = Legislation imposed on Guernsey =  Acts of Parliament  Certain laws affecting Guernsey can be imposed on Guernsey by the United Kingdom government and are registered as Guernsey laws to extend them to the Bailiwick. Examples include the Landmines Act 1998 ( becoming the Landmines Act 1998 (Guernsey) Order 2000) and the Police Act 1997. There have been many cases in history of Guernsey simply not registering Parliamentary laws which has the effect of nullifying them. Convention requires Parliamentary laws to (a) not go beyond the prerogative powers over the Islands and (b) should be consonant with aspects of modern law. In many cases it is logical to take Parliamentary legislation and if useful and applicable to the Bailiwick, mirror it, or adopt it with few, if any, changes into a Guernsey law, such as the Civil Aviation Act 1946 (through the Civil Aviation Act (Extension to the Channel Islands) Order, 1947). Since 1967, when the United Kingdom applied for membership of the European Economic Community, the UK made it plain that certain laws passed by European Union bodies would apply to Guernsey, through the United Kingdom connection. Negotiations on terms were concluded in 1971 resulting in the European Communities (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1973 allowing EU regulations to have immediate effect in Guernsey. Additional effects on Guernsey followed the Treaty of Maastricht,1992, the Treaty of Amsterdam,1997, the Treaty of Nice, 2001 and the Treaty of Lisbon, 2004. Amongst other matters, the Bailiwick has fiscal autonomy, but has accepted European human rights in 1971. Whilst it is a strong constitutional convention that the UK does not normally legislate for the Crown Dependencies without the explicit consent of their Governments, in law it does have the power to do so. This may be done in two ways. Historically, Acts of Parliament might have been expressed to extend to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man on the face of the Act, but nowadays the practice would be to provide that the UK Government can extend the provisions of an Act to the Channel Islands (and the Isle of Man) by Order-in-Council or by ministerial order. (There is only one example of the British Parliament legislating for a Crown Dependency in modern times (i.e. since the Statute of Westminster) which was the imposition by the Wilson Government of the Marine, &c.;, Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967 (a UK Act) to the Isle of Man and its incorporation to Manx Law without the consent of Tynwald (the Isle of Man's Parliament). It would seem this power quite likely exists in the case of Guernsey similarly, but it has never been tested.  History of Guernsey law  The original laws have origins in Roman Law, a uniform law, which spread by way of naturalisation in the immense empire. With the decline of the empire, Frankish Law being applied by the 9th century. The arrival of Viking invaders in the 10th century brought out law based more on custom. Custom is a source of law in the Guernsey legal system. It can be described as \\"the product of generally accepted usage and practice.‚Äù Many rules of customary law have crystallised to such an extent through repeated acknowledgment that they are accepted as law, almost without argument. = Early laws = The earliest law is probably the \\"Clameur de Haro\\" in the Channel Islands. It is, supposedly, an appeal to Rollo who ruled Normandy and the Channel Islands from 911-927 and is a form of injunction to stop someone who is damaging private land. The most recent case of this being used was the case of Gillingham -v- Noone where a Clameur de Haro was registered by the Court of Alderney at a special sitting on Saturday 28 January 2017. King John from De Rege Johanne Guernsey seal arms of Bailiwick King John, who reigned from 1199 to 1216, lost the English- controlled territories in Normandy in France following the 1204 Siege of Ch√¢teau Gaillard, the remaining Norman lands being the Channel Islands. King John promised the islands independence and the right to continue governing themselves after they confirmed their allegiance to the English Crown. Agents of the Crown called bailiffs would enforce the laws and run the courts, one in Jersey and one in Guernsey; the areas under the authority of these bailiffs were called bailiwicks. In 1259 at the Treaty of Paris the English King Henry III renounced the claim to Normandy that was under the control of the King of France; this excluded the Channel Islands, which were controlled by the English throne. Attempts to change the government, law and independence have been made over the centuries, a constitutional struggle started as the Islands insisted on wanting Norman law. This struggle involved Edward I (1272-1307), Edward II (1307-1327) and Edward III (1327-1377), and are linked to an invasion of Guernsey in 1294 which took several years before the French were expelled. Another attempt in 1336 and yet another in 1338 resulted in both the improved training of the militia and a Royal Charter of 1341 confirming the Islands' constitution, this Charter being ratified by successive sovereigns. The ratification by Elizabeth I of 1560 set out in detail the rights of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. A seal granted to the Channel Islands in 1279 and to each of Guernsey and Jersey in 1304 have become symbols of Guernsey's separate identity from both Jersey and the United Kingdom. = Customary law = The customary law of the Duchy of Normandy is particularly influential as a source of law. Norman law developed in two main epochs: the \\"Ancienne coutume\\" (1199‚Äì1538) and the \\"Coutume reform√©e\\" (1538‚Äì1804).  Ancienne coutume  The earliest Norman law was based on oral tradition and repeated practices in feudal society. The earliest known written account of the ancienne coutume of Normandy is the Tr√®s-ancienne coutume, first set down in Latin manuscript around 1199 to 1223. It was translated into French, probably in about 1230. The second, dating between 1235 and 1258 and called Grand Coutumier, comprised 125 articles setting out all matters including jurisdiction, judicial officers, various ducal rights (such as wrecks and treasure trove), various forms of feudal tenure, legal procedure and remedies, succession law, criminal law and punishment, various forms of civil dispute, possession actions, other forms of court action and prescription. It was this law that formed the basis of customary law until 1583. The Grand Coutumier in Guernsey started to diverge from the French version as local customs were added to it.  Coutume Reform√©e of Normandy  In 1454, Charles VII of France issued orders that all the customary laws of France should be \\"redacted\\", in other words set out systematically and approved under royal authority. The Duchy of Normandy was the last part of France to comply with this order, but the new text was eventually prepared and received royal approval in 1585 by Henry III of France. The setting out in writing of the previous French common laws provided a basis of understanding for the Courts of Guernsey. At the same time that France was consolidating its laws, Elizabeth I enquired about the laws and duties of the Channel Islands. The commissioners to Guernsey found certain faults, resulting in the laws being defined and L‚ÄôApprobation des Lois being published. L'Approbation itself became Guernsey law by an Order in Council dated 27 October 1583. There were areas missed out and faults in this publication which were pointed out over the next century. = Influence of English and French law = One of the four French laws, canon law, seems to have been restricted after the Guernsey Martyrs were burned at the stake in 1556 for their Protestant faith and the death of Queen Mary two years later. The Ecclesiastical Court was revived in 1662 and still operates today. Contract law was influenced by French law in the 18th century and then English law in the 19th century. The French revolution of 1789 resulted in the Code Civil of 1804, which saw the end of French customary law. It has had some influence on Guernsey. Some fields of Guernsey law, such as negligence and administrative law, are heavily influenced by English common law, especially during the 19th and 20th centuries. Laws affecting new areas, such as data protection or driving licences, tend to follow English law. = Influence of European law = Certain aspects of membership of the United Kingdom in the European Union apply to the Crown dependencies, by association of the United Kingdom's membership. The Islanders have no right of vote in the European Parliament, or in any of the United Kingdom Parliaments. The European Communities (Implementation) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 1994 gives Guernsey the right to implement provisions in European laws as it was decided that the laws of the Islands' neighbours should be taken into account. Having accepted the European human rights laws, The Human Rights (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2000 was passed to allow people to claim their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights in the Island courts and tribunals, instead of having to go to the European Court in Strasbourg. = Language = French was the only official language of the Bailiwick, until 1948 when it changed to English. Some laws kept the old language for longer, for instance, all deeds for the sale and purchase of real estate in Guernsey were written in French until 1971. = Alderney = Alderney enjoys full autonomy in law (except in matters of foreign affairs and defence, as the other Channel Islands); however, in 1948 Alderney adopted a new constitution which created a fully elected government and changed the courts. Under the terms of an agreement (known as \\"the 1948 Agreement\\") entered into between the Government of Alderney and the Government of Guernsey, certain matters were delegated to Guernsey. These are known as \\"the transferred services\\" which include policing, customs and excise, airport operations, health, education and social services. In return for the cost of providing the transferred services, Guernsey has been permitted by Alderney to levies various taxes and duties on Alderney at the same rate as in Guernsey.  Judiciary  The head of the judiciary in Guernsey is the Bailiff, who, as well as performing the judicial functions of a Chief Justice, is also the head of the States of Guernsey and has certain civic, ceremonial and executive functions. The Bailiff's functions may be exercised by the Deputy Bailiff. The posts of Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff are Crown appointments. = Jurats = Sixteen Jurats, who need no specific legal training, are elected by the States of Election from among Islanders. They act as a jury, and also as judges in civil and criminal cases. The Jurats fix the sentence in criminal cases. They also undertake a number of other duties. First mentioned in 1179, there is a list of Jurats who have served since 1299. = Judicial appointments = The Bailiff is, ex officio, a Judge of the Court of Appeal and the Court's president. He also sits as a single judge or presiding over a sitting with Jurats. The Deputy Bailiff undertakes judicial work and acts in situations when the Bailiff is not present. = Law Officers = The Law Officers of the Crown are responsible for criminal prosecution work and for providing legal advice to the Crown, ministers and other members of the States of Guernsey. H.M. Procureur and the junior H.M. Comptroller hold office through Royal Warrants and both are Law Officers of the Crown. H.M. Procureur responsible to provide legal advice to the Island Government. H.M. Greffier and H.M. Sherriff provide specific duties to the Courts of recording and enforcing.  Courts   Guernsey legal profession  Advocates, have right of audience to represent clients in all courts. The qualification route is normally through obtaining a Bachelor of Laws degree in England, then a qualification as a Solicitor or Barrister in England and Wales, followed by vocational training, passing Guernsey Bar exams and then obtaining a Certificat d‚ÄôEtudes Juridiques Fran√ßaises et Normandes from Caen University. Solicitors and Notaries have no rights of audience.  Laws  Guernsey normally passes between 30 and 50 new laws, or amendments to, or repeals of, laws each year.  Legal aid  Legal aid, provided by the Guernsey Legal Aid Service, can provide access to free or reduced cost legal advice in criminal and civil cases.  Other  The fastest law passed was almost certainly one in 1940, during German occupation, when, to avoid a Guernsey individual being prosecuted for saying something derogatory against the occupying Germans before a German military court, a law was passed within days and the person involved was prosecuted for an offence that had not been against the law when the crime was committed.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Talbot House is located on the west side of US 1 in East Machias, just south of its junction with Maine State Route 191. It is a three- story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof and clapboard siding. The steep portion of the mansard roof is finished in wood shingles, and is studded with round-arch dormers. The cornice is modillioned, and the building corners are pilastered. The main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by an elaborate flat-roof porch. Windows are framed by decorative bracketed and gabled surrounds. The windows flanking the main entrance are narrow tripled sash, with a similar doubled French door above the entrance. Other windows are more conventionally sized sash, although projecting sections on the sides have narrow windows on the sides. The house was built in 1874 for James Talbot, one of the area's leading lumber manufacturers and shipbuilders. It was designed by Portland architect James A.

It is reputedly the oldest pub in the town. The Garrick is located along Stratford's Historic Spine.  History  It has been an inn within the current Elizabethan, half-timbered building since 1718. An earlier medieval building on the same site was also used as an inn. The precise date of the construction of the current building is not known. However, it is considered to be 1596 with parts dating back to the 14th century, making it one of the oldest buildings in Stratford-upon-Avon. It is Grade II* listed, a listing for properties which 'are particularly important buildings of more than special interest.' Restoration of the property took place in around 1912, when a brick front added in about 1800, was replaced. Restoration also took place in 2005. It was previously called The Greyhound, as well as The Reindeer, before its name was changed to The Garrick Inn after the actor David Garrick in 1795. It is thought that a bout of plague may have started within the original inn in 1564 after a weaver's apprentice, Oliver Gunn, died of the disease there. The phrase 'hic incepit pestis' which translates as 'here begins the plague' were written in Gunn's burial entry. However, it is unclear whether these words were added to the burial register in order to indicate the local plague outbreak starting at this location. It is also claimed that the pub is haunted.

September 2015, p. 8. and grew up in Berlin. After the end of the Second World War he studied Political Sciences at Baltimore for a year in 1950/51 before returning to West Germany where he studied Jurisprudence at Frankfurt and Marburg. He received his doctorate in International law from Marburg in 1956. An early post qualification job was as an assistant to Ludwig Erhard, at that time still better known as a celebrity-economist than as a politician. He switched his focus to Criminal justice, and in 1967 received his habilitation (academic qualification) from Hamburg University for work on the legal status of detainees and the prison system in transition. The work, which was supervised by Rudolf Sieverts, was subsequently published as a book, and supported reforms to the German penal system which Sch√ºler-Springorum promoted, with some success, during the next couple of decades. In 1967 Sch√ºler-Springorum took a professorial post at G√∂ttingen University. By the time he left, in 1971, he was being described as G√∂ttingen's \\"Prisons expert\\" (\\"Strafvollzugs-Experte\\"). 1971 was the year in which he transferred to Hamburg. He moved again in 1975, this time to Munich University where he held the teaching chair in Criminology, Youth Justice and Prison matters (\\"Kriminologie, Jugendstrafrecht und Strafvollzug\\"). He retired from Munich in 1993, the year of his sixty-fifth birthday, and was succeeded in the professorship by Heinz Sch√∂ch. In the summer term of 1996 he took the \\"Otto von Freising\\" visiting professorship at the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt- Ingolstadt. In parallel with his work as a law professor, Horst Sch√ºler- Springorum engaged in various activities that promoted more directly the ideas set out in his 1969 book \\"Strafvollzug im √úbergang\\" (\\"Prison Policy in Transition\\"), which gained traction internationally and through which Germany's subsequent Rehabilitation as an objective of imprisonment strategy is anchored. His more recent book, \\"Kriminalpolitik f√ºr Menschen\\" (\\"Criminal Justice Policy for Human Beings\\", 1991), moved forward public discussion of decriminalisation more generally. As a Youth lawyer he became involved with the National Association for Youth Courts and Legal Youth Support (\\"Deutsche Vereinigung f√ºr Jugendgerichte und Jugendgerichtshilfen\\" / DVJJ), serving between 1962 and 1968 as the Association's chief executive, and then as its Chairman till 1986.

She chaired the committee which investigated and made recommendations for accreditation standards for preschool education and which were adopted in the State Board of Education Codes in 1954. She was the first Distinguished Professor of Rhode Island College and both the first residence hall and a Professorship at the school are named in her honor. She was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 1969. Biography Mary Dahood was born on 14 September 1899 in Syria to Hadla Dahood. Her family immigrated to New York in 1904, but soon after, her mother was widowed and placed Mary, her middle child into an orphanage called Rock Nook Home for Children. During her teens, Florence (n√©e Tucker) and Job Thorp, prominent citizens of Westerly, Rhode Island became Dahood's guardians. The Thorps had three other children, Elliott, who would become a Brigadier General and was MacArthur's chief of counter-intelligence during World War II; Walter and a daughter, Elsie. By 1917, Dahood was teaching school in the Tomaquag Valley of Washington County, Rhode Island. Her mother, Hadla, who had been unsuccessful in annulling the Thorp‚Äôs guardianship, arrived at the school and tried to take Dahood back to Brooklyn to work at the boardinghouse she operated. Hadla was arrested for attempted kidnapping, but charged with creating a disturbance. After the incident, the Thorps took measures to permanently become Dahood's family. They adopted her around 1920 and she took the name of Mary Tucker Thorp. Career In 1926, Thorp accepted a teaching position at Rhode Island College of Education (RIC) and simultaneously worked on her own education, earning her bachelor's degree in education in 1929. She went on to complete a Master of Education from Boston University in 1932, with a thesis entitled Objective Studies Showing Need for Giving Instruction in Use of Geography Tools. Thorp was promoted to president of the Henry Barnard School at RIC in 1936 and the following year, in September 1937, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Thorp earned her Doctor of Education in 1943 from Boston University and became the first distinguished professor at RIC. In 1947, Thorp headed a committee to establish accreditation standards for nursery schools and institutions teaching very young children. The report took two years to compile, but became the basis for the code adopted by the State Board of Education for Rhode Island in 1954. She was a prominent speaker on education, child development and health, speaking at women‚Äôs groups, nursing colleges, PTA meetings and various civic organizations. In 1961, the first residence hall on RIC campus was dedicated and named in her honor. Thorp retired from the college in 1962 but continued her community services. In 1963, she served as the vice president of the Rhode Island Tuberculosis and Health Association and the following year became president, a post she held through the end of the 1960s. Thorp also served as a representative to the White House Conference on Children and Youth. She received the Roger Williams Medal from the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce and a commendation from Brown University for her community service involvement. Thorp was also inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 1969. Thorp died on 27 October 1974. She bequeathed a trust to the Rhode Island College for the Mary Tucker Thorp College Professorship, which is an annual award honoring teaching or scholarship excellence.

Background On 27 July 1941, a Yugoslav Partisan-led uprising began in the area of Drvar and Bosansko Grahovo. It was a coordinated effort from both sides of the Una River in the territory of southeastern Lika and southwestern Bosanska. It succeeded in transferring key NDH territory under rebel control. Incident Parishioners of the Catholic parish in Drvar went on a pilgrimage near Knin on 26 July 1941. The massacre occurred in village of Trubar, 18 km from Drvar, where Chetnik rebels stopped a train on Vaganj station and separated pilgrims who were returning from Knin on 27 July. Murdered pilgrims, among whom was a German Roman Catholic priest, Waldemar Maximilian Nestor, were thrown into the pit of Golubnjaƒça. Shortly afterwards massacres occurred in surrounding villages.}} Some sources cite over 300 fatalities, yet many of the bodies that were thrown into deep caves, have yet to be fully exhumed. One of the witnesses of the massacre was a Partisan, Stevo Babiƒá, who wrote that a group of rebels had executed train passengers at Golubnjaƒça. According to Croatian scholar Blanka Matkovich, the Yugoslav Partisans were responsible for the massacre. Exhumation The Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina announced in November 2015 that exhumations of bodies from the pit of Golubnjaƒça were carried out and that these are the bodies of pilgrims killed in July 1941. Bodies were buried in priests' tomb in Banja Luka. Franjo Komarica, Bishop of Banja Luka, requested from the Office an investigation of the crime.

It was flown only briefly but led to a second design with similar features. Design and development Early aircraft designers appreciated that whilst low take-off speeds required wings with high lift, high camber sections, more symmetric, low camber sections produced less drag at speed. One solution was to make a wing sufficiently flexible chordwise that the section could be altered in flight. This was the approach taken by Adolphe Lachassagne; his AL 3 was the first French monoplane with such a wing. Details of the profile changing mechanism for the AL 3 are sparse, though each two spar wing was in two parts, a forward rigid metal structure and a rear flexible wooden structure. Both were fabric covered. On the later Lachassagne AL 5 the leading edge ahead of the forward spar was rigid but rotatable and the AL 3 may have had a similar feature. Its \\"minimum incidence\\" could be altered from 2¬∞ to 5¬∞. Apart from the camber-changing system the two wings were unremarkable; they were rectangular in plan, with a low aspect ratio of only 4.3, each joined low down onto the fuselage. On each side a pair of near-parallel struts braced the wing from the spars beyond half span to the upper fuselage. Very short and broad balanced ailerons were mounted at the tips. The AL 3 had a flat-sided fuselage with rounded decking, built around ash longerons and covered with plywood. The pilot sat in an open cockpit between the wing spars. It was initially powered by an Darracq flat twin engine, mounted with its cylinder heads exposed for air-cooling. This, like parts of the fuselage and its landing gear were not new; Lachassagne was not well funded. At the rear the trapezoidal tailplane had, like the wings, a rigid forward part and a camber changing rear section, though the latter had a wider range of angular movement than the wing and carried the elevators. The vertical tail was conventional, with a triangular fin and an unbalanced, round topped and straight edged rudder which reached down to the keel, working between the elevators. The AL 3's elderly track undercarriage seen from ahead formed a splayed M-form set of rigid, longitudinally wire braced struts. The large diameter wheels were mounted on half axles, hinged at the centre of the M and joined to its outer members by rubber shock absorbers. A tall tailskid protected the rudder. The AL 3 took a long time to build, partly for financial reasons. Though it was entered into a 1923 event, it was not completed until 1925. It flew just before Christmas 1925, even though the Darraq engine was underperforming. By mid March 1926 the Darraq had been replaced by an Anzani engine of similar power presented to Lachassagne by the Association Fran√ßaise A√©rienne in January to enable his work on the AL3 to continue. On 20 March 1926 AL 3 flew with this engine for the first time. Testing of the effects of camber changing began the next day; the Al 3's handling was good over a speed range of around but about a week later it was badly damaged when its wire braced undercarriage collapsed on landing. Despite the short testing period, Lachassagne felt the flight trials had demonstrated that the variable camber approach worked so, rather than rebuild the AL 3, he decided to build a development, the AL 5.

Early life  Born on September 29, 1995, Baker was born in Germantown, but grew up in Bartlett, Tennessee. She learned to play on her father's guitar, and attended Arlington High School as well as Middle Tennessee State University, where she studied audio engineering and later majored in literature with a double minor in Spanish and secondary education before leaving school to tour full-time. She returned to campus in the fall of 2019 to complete her degree. Music =Style= Baker has met critical acclaim for her performances and songwriting, described as emotively cathartic, as well as a fresh take on folk music. Her album Sprained Ankle has been described as featuring pared-back fragile songs, while Turn Out the Lights features more developed song structures while retaining the raw emotion of its predecessor. =Career= In 2010 Baker co-founded the band The Star Killers, who renamed themselves Forrister in 2015. During her first year at MTSU, she began writing songs on her own, often in the university practice rooms late at night. With her friend Michael Hegner, she recorded an EP at Spacebomb Studios, which she self-released in the winter of 2014 on Bandcamp. The EP became the studio album Sprained Ankle in October 2015. Sprained Ankle topped many 2015 year-end lists and its success led to features in The New Yorker and The New York Times. Baker performing at Rough Trade NYC in 2016 On March 7, 2016, Baker performed in an NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert. During that set she referenced a new song, \\"Sad Song #11\\", which was later retitled \\"Funeral Pyre\\" and released as a single, with \\"Distant Solar Systems\\" as the b-side. Baker contributed the song \\"Decorated Lawns\\" to the Punk Talks winter compilation Jingle Yay, released on December 1, 2016. Baker has opened for artists including Death Cab for Cutie, Conor Oberst, The Decemberists, Belle & Sebastian, Paramore, The Front Bottoms, and Manchester Orchestra. In 2017 she was signed to Matador Records, releasing a 7-inch single of the songs \\"Funeral Pyre\\" and \\"Distant Solar Systems\\". An LP, Turn Out the Lights, recorded by engineer and producer Calvin Lauber at Tennessee's Ardent Studios - with help from Sorority Noise's Cameron Boucher, was released on October 27, 2017. On October 28, 2017, Baker made her national-television debut on CBS This Morning and on January 3, 2018, she made her late-night debut on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. In 2018, Baker formed the supergroup Boygenius with Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus, both of whom she had toured with previously. The group released three songs in August of that year and subsequently announced an EP and accompanying tour. The EP, self-titled boygenius, was released on October 26, 2018.

Originally self-released on Bandcamp as an EP, the album was re-released in October 2015 on 6131 Records.  Development  The songs on Sprained Ankle were written by Baker when she was a student at MTSU. She thought that they didn't \\"fit the vibe of Forrister\\" and didn't intend to release them as an album while writing. Her friend, Michael Hegner, had free time at MTSU's studio and offered to record her songs. They made a demo, Hegner liked it, and they kept working together. In the summer of 2014, they decided to take a road trip to Spacebomb Studios in Richmond, Virginia where Hegner was interning to record it. In an interview with The Blue Indian, Baker said that \\"it was recorded really sparsely and efficiently to get the most out of the time there, which contributed to the way the songs come across.\\" The songs ‚ÄúVessels‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrittle Boned‚Äù were later recorded by her friend, Toby Landers and added to the album. The record was first released as an EP on Bandcamp in the winter of 2014. Its first cover art was designed by Baker and a friend. People started sharing the record, then Baker toured it and sold CDs. 6131 Records liked her work and decided to sign her. The record was taken down from Bandcamp on advice from Baker's label so it could be mastered and formally released.  Composition  Sprained Ankle has been described by Stereogum as a \\"collection of humbly rendered folk songs\\". Critical reception  The mastered versions of the songs \\"Sprained Ankle\\" (title track), \\"Something\\", and \\"Brittle Boned\\" premiered in advance on NPR's All Songs Considered, Stereogum, and Nylon respectively. Sprained Ankle was re-release in October 2015 through 6131 Records. The Sabyn Mayfield-directed music video for \\"Sprained Ankle\\" was released on October 26. It charted on Billboards Heatseekers Albums at number 25 for the week of November 14. Gabriela Tully Claymore from Stereogum wrote the songs were \\"unabashedly explicit, and Sprained Ankle discusses depression, substance abuse, and general crises of faith in detail.\\" On the guitar playing, Ian Cohen of Pitchfork wrote that \\"[Baker is] a minimalist, playing bassy clusters of melodic thirds, flicking silvery harmonics, [and] palm-muting chords.\\" It was recorded in a way that Adam Kevil from Consequence of Sound considers to be a simple format, \\"[Baker] alone, singing and playing acoustic guitar directly into the microphone, sometimes in a single take\\".

Developed between about 1850 and 1915, Scott Farm is a well-preserved farm and orchard complex of that period. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history Scott Farm is set on more than of rolling hills in southeastern Dummerston, a rural community in southeastern Vermont. The main farmstead is located on the southwest side of Kipling Road, consisting of a c. 1850 house along with a cluster of agricultural outbuildings, now mostly concerned with the production and processing of apples. Most of the farmstead buildings date to the between about 1911 and 1967. Just south of the complex are three ponds, impounded by concrete dams built about 1909 and renovated in 1975. Remote buildings on the property include another farmhouse (c. 1845) on the west side of Dutton Farm Road, and two early 20th-century cottages. Portions of the land that makes up Scott Farm were probably cleared in the early 19th century, and used at subsistence levels. In 1845 Rufus Scott purchased the land that now makes up the core of the farm, building the Greek Revival farmhouse about 1850, and the Cow Barn in 1862. He operated a dairy farm at first, gradually diversifying the operation to include other activities. Apple trees were planted on the property by 1870, with forty trees producing fruit in 1880. Scott's farm was purchased in 1908 by Francis Holbrook II, a Boston lawyer, who proceeded to develop the farm as an apple orchard. He purchased the adjacent Dutton Farm in 1913. In 1995 Holbrook's heirs gave the farm to the Landmark Trust, a preservation organization that also owns nearby Naulakha, Rudyard Kipling's home. Scott Farm hosts The Stone Trust, a non profit dedicated to preserving traditional dry stone walling techniques.

Philanthropic partners of the Institute include The Rockefeller Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, Open Society Foundations, and local and federal government agencies. Mission ISLG's work focuses on solving local and national policy issues surrounding criminal justice, fiscal policy, and inequality. This work is based on a growing acknowledgement that government cannot tackle huge societal problems alone and without data. Prior to joining ISLG, Mr. Jacobson was encouraging elected officials to use data to inform policy decisions. He co-authored a thought piece recapping public and safety trends that occurred during the Bloomberg administration and challenges the next mayor would face in this area when he/she took office. The piece titled, \\"A Mayoral Agenda for Justice and Safety in New York City,\\" noted that NYC's crime rates were on the decline. But the decline coincided with the highly unpopular and controversial policing tactic of stop and frisk. Mr. Jacobson noted that these tactics were creating distrust within communities and widespread anti-police sentiment. It would be up to the next mayor, Mr. Jacobson argued, to maintain low crime rates while simultaneously understanding if these police tactics were responsible for the drop in crime. Equality indicators ISLG has undertaken development of a tool that measures inequality levels in U.S. and international cities, the Equality Indicators. New York City was the pilot site for this tool. After an 18-month data collection and analysis process, NYC's score was released in October 2015. In October 2016 and in each year thereafter, ISLG will release a change score which will indicate whether inequalities are increasing or decreasing. To date, this is the most comprehensive tool of its kind as it focuses on how 12 disadvantaged groups (e.g. racial minorities, LGBTQ, people with disabilities) fare in economy, education, health, housing, justice, and services. This work is consistent with the agenda of NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has made stamping out inequality a platform of his administration. Criminal Justice Investment Initiative In late 2014, ISLG was hired as a technical assistance consultant by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for its Criminal Justice Investment Initiative (CJII). As part of this initiative, approximately $250 million of asset forfeiture funds will be awarded to organizations that focus on improving public safety and increasing the overall fairness of the criminal justice system. These types of programs range from prevention-oriented programs built around early intervention for those at risk of becoming criminals to programs that work with victims of crime and that evaluate the effectiveness of specific projects and initiatives. They dovetail with President Obama's national initiative on criminal justice reform. The President asked the Department of Justice to look closely at mandatory minimum sentencing for non-violent drug offenders, the practice of solitary confinement, giving the incarcerated job training while they serve time, and re-evaluating the death penalty. Cost-benefit analysis ISLG is applying cost-benefit analysis to juvenile justice interventions to determine their feasibility within pay for success contracts. Because the cost of crime is ostensibly high and increasing, ISLG seeks to contribute to the justice landscape by illuminating programs that are effective and that provide short and long term cost savings to organizations and government. Currently, ISLG is partnering with the National Council on Crime and Delinquency to conduct a Pay for Success feasibility assessment of three juvenile justice programs in the U.S. The interventions range in type from prevention for at risk youth to court processing and alternatives to detention. ISLG is looking at individual and programmatic population data as well as financial data to assess if the benefits of each program outweigh their opportunity costs. For adults, ISLG evaluates criminal justice practices like pre-trial detainment or jail through a lens of cost benefit analysis. When those accused of crimes await trial in jail as opposed to paying bail, they are removed from family, work, and education. Pre-trial detainees await disposition of felony charges an average of 95 days. This is an expensive proposition. In a New York Times blog on this issue, Mr. Jacobson proposed NYC could save $125 million if case processing times were improved and those accused of crimes did not need to spend excessive amounts of time in jail. In the future, ISLG seeks to expand its cost benefit analysis expertise into other areas such as welfare, health, education, and transportation. Safety and Justice Challenge ISLG is a partner in the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's Safety and Justice Challenge Initiative, which aims to reduce jail populations nationwide-as well as racial and ethnic disparities in those populations-through two phases of work. During the first phase, the Foundation awarded grants to 20 jurisdictions to create plans that will reduce their local jail populations through fairer, more effective criminal justice practices and policies. In Phase II, ten of those jurisdictions will receive a second round of funding to implement their reform plans. ISLG serves as the national intermediary for the initiative, providing oversight on project management and design, and is also responsible for monitoring the performance of participating jurisdictions throughout the life of the initiative.

It was restored to its original condition in 2001, and Los Angeles magazine described it as \\"a tiara of light atop our beautifully restored Los Angeles City Hall.\\" City officials now occasionally put the beacon into operation for special occasions such as the year-end holidays.  History  In an article of September 1, 1927, during construction of the hall and less than four months after the historic solo trans-Atlantic flight of Col. Charles Lindbergh, the Los Angeles Times marked the beginning of the Lindbergh Beacon project with: The beacon began operation on the first night of the City Hall's three-day dedication gala of April 26‚Äì28, 1928. In two articles during April 1928, the Los Angeles Times indicated that: The Times recounted that: Only six months after the Lindbergh Beacon began operations an associate of Lindbergh was quoted, indirectly, as saying that the beacon was \\"a great mistake\\" and that rotating beacons should only be used near airports. In May 1931, by order of the Department of Commerce, the rotating white beacon was replaced with a directional red beacon pointing to the nearest airport. Immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor the City Hall's beacon was turned off and continued dormant until after the war. It was briefly reactivated in 1947 and then removed and put in storage. Beginning in 1992 the red Lindbergh Beacon was put on display at the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport, LAX. Beginning in the late 1990s, the beacon was restored and reinstalled as part of the City Hall's $299 million renovation and seismic upgrade. In September 2001, with the building work compete, it was planned to relight the beacon but the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington delayed the reactivation until later in the year. During December 2001, the Lindbergh Beacon's white beam again swept across the city. After giving due notice to airways authorities, the Lindbergh Beacon, in its original configuration, can today be activated as requested by city authorities.  Early aids to navigation  Between 1923 and 1933, as an aid to aerial navigation, the US Post Office and the Department of Commerce constructed a nationwide network of airway beacons. These beacons provided a rotating white light which appeared to flash one tenth second every ten seconds. Just below the white beacon a set of red or green course lights pointed along each airway route. The original white Lindbergh Beacon rotated six times each minute like the white beacons of the federal network. As restored, the white Lindbergh Beacon rotates at ten times per minute. The characteristics of the second red beacon atop the City Hall may or may not have matched the characteristics of the national network's red course lights.  Commemorative plaque  Los Angeles City Hall's 27th floor observation deck has a bronze commemorative plaque titled \\"The Lindbergh Beacon\\" that reads as follows: > The beacon on top of the Los Angeles City Hall was turned on by President > Calvin Coolidge from the White House during the City Hall dedication > ceremonies April 26, 1928. The light was gratefully dedicated to Charles A. > Lindbergh for his contribution to the advancement of aviation and in > commemoration of man's first transatlantic solo flight from New York to > Paris on May 20, 1927. Press Photographers Association of Greater Los > Angeles. The plaque must have been put in place after this professional group was founded in 1936.  Huell Howser's television programs  During the period 1992‚Äì2001, the television personality Huell Howser broadcast, on PBS, three programs related to the history of the Lindbergh Beacon. Each successive program built on the previous programs. His first broadcast in 1991 stirred interest in the historical beacon including on the part of city's mayor, Tom Bradley. The second program in 1992 shows details of the \\"rediscovered\\" device and its display as a red, rotating beacon at LAX. The third program in 2001 shows the re-installation of the beacon, with a white beam, on the very top of the city hall. It was lifted by helicopter and then bolted in place by a technician. Based on research from other sources the Howser programs are quite accurate. Early in the first program some of the comments by Delmar Watson may not be true. The original white beacon was not directional; it rotated. Also the original beacon was not \\"too bright\\"; it was the wrong color. Contemporary sources indicate the Department of Commerce wanted a red beacon pointing to the nearest airport which at the time was in Glendale. With a red filter the beacon may not have rotated at all. The Howser video gives the viewer many details about the beacon itself: searchlight configuration, canted upward, cylindrical shape roughly three feet in diameter, single electrical bulb, flat cover-filter in front of the bulb, and‚Äîbehind the bulb‚Äîa curved mirror, likely parabolic.

Mandell practiced law before moving into family business in real estate development. In addition, he has been active in multiple state and national government bodies, including the Florida Environmental Regulation Commission, the Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority and the President's Export Council. Mandell was a major donor to the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and supported the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016. In 2019, President Trump appointed Mandell to the Board of Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Early life Mandell was born in Miami, Florida in 1947, the son of Lester N. Mandell and Sonia (Margolis) Mandell. He received a bachelor's degree in advertising from the University of Florida in 1969. In 1972, Mandell received his Juris Doctor degree from University of Florida's Fredric G. Levin College of Law. He graduated from Harvard Business School's Owner/President Management Executive Program in 2000. Career Following law school in 1972, Mandell worked as a lawyer in Punta Gorda, Florida. He was partner in the firm Wotitzky, Wotitzky, Mandell, Batsel, Wilkins and Frohlich and left active practice in 1983. He is peer-evaluated as \\"AV\\" (preeminent) in Martindale-Hubbell's legal listing. Mandell began work as a laborer at his father's Central Florida real estate development business, Greater Construction Corporation, in 1984. Greater Construction named Mandell president of the company in 1989 after his father became chairman. Robert Mandell and four partners bought the company from Lester Mandell in 1998, and the company was later renamed Greater Homes. Mandell served as the company's chairman and CEO until national homebuilder Meritage Homes Corporation bought it in 2005, after which he served as president of Meritage Homes of Central Florida. Additionally, Mandell was chairman and CEO of Greater Properties Inc., a commercial real estate development firm. In addition to those roles, Mandell has served on boards, commissions and authorities in the private and public sectors. In 1987 Republican Gov. Bob Martinez named Mandell to the Florida Environmental Regulation Commission, where he served as chairman until 1990. Martinez then appointed Mandell to the Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority, where he served from 1990 to 1995, held the chairman and vice chairman posts, and was known for reducing tolls and successfully pushing Florida's E-Pass electronic toll collection system. He has served on the boards of Florida Hospital in Orlando, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in LaJolla, and Vermont Studio Center, among others. Mandell sits on the advisory board of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the board of directors for Human Rights First and the Wilson National Cabinet of the Wilson Center. President Barack Obama named Mandell to the President's Export Council in 2010. Ambassadorship President Barack Obama nominated Mandell as the U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg in June 2011. As with other political appointees who have not previously served in such posts, several media outlets noted that Mandell had no diplomatic experience and had been a prominent fundraiser for Obama; Mandell donated $30,000 to Obama's campaign and $50,000 to his inauguration committee in 2008. Mandell raised more than $200,000 for the 2008 Obama campaign and was one of two dozen bundlers that were nominated for ambassador positions. Mandell's confirmation hearing took place in September, and the U.S. Senate approved his nomination by voice vote on October 18, 2011. Mandell was sworn in on October 25, 2011. He presented his credentials on November 16, 2011. When Mandell arrived in Luxembourg, he filled the post left vacant following the resignation of Seattle venture capitalist Cynthia Stroum. Mandell's tenure was notable for the founding of the Luxembourg Forum, meetings between United States Supreme Court justices and judges of the European Court of Justice, with the goal of identifying and working on legal issues where cooperation can provide a mutual benefit. In addition, during Mandell's ambassadorship the embassy worked with the government of Luxembourg to create a quarterly forum of U.S. business leaders, business leaders in Luxembourg, and officials of Luxembourg's government, with the intent of exploring opportunities for U.S. companies to expand in Luxembourg. Mandell resigned his ambassadorship in February 2015, saying it was time for him and his wife to return to private life in the U.S. On February 12, Luxembourg Grand Duke Henri honored Mandell by naming him a Commander of the Order of the Oak Crown an award that recognizes individuals for exceptional civil and military services. Later career After leaving his ambassadorship, Mandell continued to serve on the board of directors of Human Rights First and joined the Council of American Ambassadors. In 2016, he was a prominent supporter of Hillary Clinton for president. In March 2019, Mandell was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting by President Trump and confirmed by the Senate. He also serves on the Board of Directors of the bi-partisan think tank Center for a New American Security.

He is the author of three books, which focus on East-Central Europe, Germany and Britain during World War I. His most recent book, The Fortress: The Great Siege of Przemysl was praised by The Times newspaper as a \\"masterpiece\\". His previous book, Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary at War, 1914-1918, won numerous awards. Currently Watson is Professor of History at Goldsmiths, University of London. Education In 2000, Watson received his Bachelor of Arts (hons) degree in Modern history from Exeter College, Oxford. He began his doctoral degree in 2001 at Balliol College, Oxford, and completed in 2005. From 2005 to 2008, he was a Clare Hall, Cambridge Research Fellow. For three years, starting in 2008, Watson was a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Cambridge. In 2010, he was a College Research Associate at St. John's College, Cambridge. Watson was a Marie Curie Intra-European Fellow at the University of Warsaw in Poland from 2011 to 2013. Career Watson's first book, Enduring the Great War; Combat, Morale and Collapse in the German armies (1914‚Äì1918), began as his doctoral thesis in October 2001. It was published by Cambridge University Press in 2008. The book focuses on the psyche of German and British soldiers in World War I and attempts to understand how they were able to fight for all those years. In 2006, it was awarded the Fraenkel Prize from the Institute of Contemporary History and Wiener Library. In August 2014, Watson's second book, Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary at War (1914‚Äì1918) was published. To write the book, he spent two years researching archives in Poland, Germany, and Austria. His reason for writing the book was to better understand the war from the perspective of the Central Powers' leaders and their peoples; how they were able to endure suffering and commit crimes that would later lead to \\"even greater horrors of totalitarian dictatorship, a second world war and genocide\\". The book received many accolades. It was awarded The Sunday Times 2014 History Book of the Year, the 2015 Distinguished Book Award from the Society for Military History, and the 2015 British Army Military Book of the Year. On 23 March 2015 Watson was awarded the second annual 2014 Guggenheim- Lehrman Prize in Military History, and received $50,000. The award is given to the best book in the field of military history published during the previous calendar year. During a ceremony on 14 May 2015, Watson received the Wolfson History Prize for Ring of Steel. Along with this prize, Watson was also awarded ¬£25,000. The Fortress: The Great Siege of Przemysl, Watson's most recent book, was released in October 2019. This is the story of the First World War's longest siege, and of the opening of the brutal tragedy which befell East-Central Europe during the twentieth century. It follows a ragtag Habsburg garrison of old soldiers desperately defending Central Europe from Russian invasion, and recounts the vicious fighting, starvation and anti- Semitic ethnic cleansing which began in the region already in 1914. Watson has written for The New York Times, Times Higher Education, and History Today. He has been interviewed for BBC Radio programs, \\"World War One\\" and \\"Good Morning, Scotland\\", and appeared on the German Channel's documentary, \\"The Search for the Lost Sons. One Hundred Years of the First World War\\".

Unlike Blue, Ladies is focused on simple 32 key sound samples such as \\"ah\\". Due to every instance using a voice selection option, it is possible to build up the vocals to create a choir of sounds using the five vocals. The package comes as a \\"lite\\" or \\"full\\" version, with the difference being that Teresa is absent in the lite version. The package has also been updated to version 2 since original release. The updated version contains double the amount of articulations as the original. An upgrade was offered to those who bought the first version free. The update was done with fresh recordings from the original singers. *Realivox - Blue: This is a classical style singer pack with a solo female vocalist. In contrast to the \\"Realivox Ladies\\" product, Blue is a more complex package with advanced features. Her vocal is complex with 12,000 samples with 32 samples per sound covering two and a half octaves of singing vocal result, while closing consonants have 192 samples for certain sounds such as \\"t\\". All six vowels contain legato results, this is also included for humming sounds sound as \\"mm\\". She also contains polyphonic legato capabilities. She is designed to be a go-between vocal and has realistic tones. The samples are combined to build words, with the transition between the sounds being almost invisible. She was released on May 26, 2014. Reception Richard Leiter, at Keyboard magazine, commented that both products give an uncanny realistic result that had a \\"effortless\\" learning curve. He, however, commented that singers like Adele need not worry about the package's results. He felt the product was best suited for solo lines and backup singers, offering a product at the price that would cost more to do the same effort with real singers for a single vocal recording session.

The film stars Lucy Hale, Kathryn Prescott, Alexandra Shipp, Awkwafina, Austin Butler and Michaela Watkins. It was released on April 20, 2018, by Netflix. Plot Lily, Chloe, Amelia, and Rebecca are in their second-to-last year of high school at a junior prom. One night Chloe's brother Thomas takes Lily out onto the field where she tells him that she can not imagine leaving. The two are about to kiss when Rebecca and the others tell them that their limo has arrived. Lily drops Rebecca and Amelia off at home and then takes Chloe to meet Thomas in the mountains. The three go their separate ways and then Thomas is killed in a car crash on the way home. At the funeral, Chloe hugs her mom crying as Lily remains silent. One year later the girls are in their last year of high school. They arrive at the school stoned again. Lily talks with Noah about prom when their teacher tells them to go to class (not realizing it is his class). Chloe and Lily walk down the halls recalling how many times they have walked it. Lily then arranges multiple parties at various houses and then makes jokes about Mr Bemis. When the girls get back to the car they discover their Donkey Kong shaped bong named \\"Donkey Bong\\". Amelia reveals to Rebecca that her parents are getting a divorce and that she does not think they see her as anything more than an extent of their ego. Lily and Chloe go to see their drug dealer friend Biff who reminds them of Thomas's favourite marijuana strain ‚Äúcough‚Äù. Lily argues with the principal about what she is good and bad at doing. Chloe walks out onto the field remembering the previous year and plays Thomas's last voice message when Sam consoles and asks her to prom. Noah serenades Lily in an attempt to ask her to prom but fails. Lily and Chloe talk in the car when Rebecca barges in and tells them that a goth girl caught her pleasuring herself to her teacher, Bemis after she encountered him in the library. The girls then go to a house party. Noah arrives and attempts to apologise to her by offering her a joint and then proceeds to make out with her. Lily walks back into the house (unaware that Chloe has just been accepted into NYU) and smokes out of a makeshift garbage bag bong. The cops arrive when the girls find Rebecca in the bathroom and make fun of her after a bathroom incident. Lily and Sam sell prom tickets the next day when Lily finds out that Liv was traumatised. She tells her that James got her in trouble when he wrote a dirty joke on an essay. After she scolds James, Noah texts her and she goes over to his house where they both engage in oral sex. The next day Noah's ex threatens her to stay away from him and knocks over a goal keeper. The girls go to another house party when Chloe tells Lily she got into NYU but wants to go to UCSB. Lily does not take it well and begins freaking out; she goes to a room with a boy, Mike from another school who rapes her. Chloe, Rebecca and Amelia all ditch Lily who then waits outside alone until a taxi comes. Lily sits in the cab crying all the way home. The next morning the girls all go over to Lily's house shortly after which she flips out at Amelia and Rebecca for not telling her about Chloe's acceptance letter. The girls all then start badmouthing Lily after which she walks away. Chloe stops her and tries to tell her that she is being selfish for wanting her to be friends with people who did not know Thomas before he died. Lily continues to be stubborn, forcing Chloe to walk away. An angry Lily drives down the street with a flashback of Thomas playing in her head but stops when she sees Rebecca at a coffee shop with her potential roommate and mocks them until a police officer comes up to her. Trying to ask her why she is illegally parked, he then notices Donkey Bong in the back. Lily panics until the officer tells her that he would not ruin her life forever but that he is going to mess it up for at least a week. Lily is forced by her mum to smash Donkey Bong. Lily argues with her mum who tries to force her to smash the bong but after Lily walks away she does it herself and continuously swears. The girls all dodge Lily's calls, leaving her alone. Noah tries to talk to Lily but she remains stubborn, forcing him to walk away. James talks to Lily who realizes she has been selfish. Lily's mum talks to her dad and tells him to come to her graduation if he cares. Chloe has flashbacks of her and the girls. Lily arrives at prom alone and eventually goes to the bathroom and cries. Rebecca talks to Bemis while Lily has a flashback of her and Thomas out on the field confessing that they love each other and it is not just a fling. Lily regrets doing what she did and apologises to Chloe for being intense about Thomas. Lily tells her that the pain will never go away but that she can not mourn what she could‚Äôve been. The two make up and go back inside. Lily apologises to Amelia and Rebecca. The girls all go back inside and Chloe kicks Mike in the balls. Noah's girlfriend breaks up with him and walks off angrily. Sam takes a picture of the girls who then bury the remains of Donkey Bong who was smashed like Jon Bong Jovi, Sean Bongery and Bong Connery. Lily gives her graduation speech in front of her friends, then in front of the entire school and then it voice overs after her graduation. Bemis arrives and claims his real name is ‚ÄúImmanuel‚Äù. Noah congratulates Lily on her graduation speech and the two kiss. Lily gets a photo taken with her brother and her sister. Amelia then notices that her brownies (which she spiked with marijuana) were consumed by Rosa, who comments on how huge their heads are.

Titus Hutchinson (born April 29, 1771, Grafton, Massachusetts; died August 24, 1857, Woodstock, Vermont) was an American lawyer, politician, and judge in the state of Vermont. He served on the Vermont Supreme Court from 1825 to 1833 and as Chief Judge from 1831 to 1833. Early life Hutchinson was the youngest of ten children of the Reverend Aaron Hutchinson of Grafton, Massachusetts. The family moved to Pomfret, Vermont in 1776, where a number of them became prominent citizens. His oldest brother Aaron (1754-1843) graduated from Harvard in 1770 and was a successful lawyer; Alexander (1764-1853) served in the Revolution and became Vermont State Auditor; another brother, Oliver (1768-1800), was a successful merchant. Although his education had been quite irregular and informal, at 19 Hutchinson decided to quit farming and go to college. He began to study with his father and learned his Latin grammar in 4 weeks, and by the summer of 1792 he was ready to enter college as a junior, which he did at Princeton, graduating in 1794. After studying law with his brother Aaron, he was admitted to the bar in 1798.History of Woodstock, Vermont, by Henry Swan Dana, New York: Houghton and Mifflin, 1889, p. 470-4 Career After opening a law office in his home in Woodstock, Vermont in 1799, Hutchinson had a successful practice. In 1801 he was appointed postmaster and held that office for three years; in 1803 he was appointed State's Attorney for Windsor County, and he served until 1813. Between 1804 and 1825 he represented Woodstock in the legislature nine times. In 1810 he became one of the Trustees of the University of Vermont. Hutchinson served as United States Attorney for Vermont from 1813 to 1821. In 1824 he was a candidate for U.S. Senate, coming in third. In 1825 he was selected by the legislature to serve as an Associate Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. In 1831, he succeeded Samuel Prentiss as Chief Justice, and John C. Thompson was named to the Associated Justice position vacated by Hutchinson. He served as Chief Justice until 1833. Hutchinson was probably removed from his position on the Vermont Supreme Court due to his involvement with the Anti-Masonic Party. He was almost elected United States representative in 1833, winning the highest vote total in the general election and the first runoff, but losing in the second runoff to Horace Everett. Hutchinson became involved with the abolitionist Liberty Party and was their candidate for governor of Vermont in 1841; he received 6% of the vote and deprived the other candidates of a majority, sending the election to the state legislature. He ran on the Liberty ticket for United States representative three times (in 1843, 1844, and 1846), receiving as much as 15% of the vote and twice forcing a runoff election by depriving Whig Jacob Collamer of a majority. Hutchinson served as a presidential elector twice, for John Quincy Adams in 1824 and William Henry Harrison in 1836.History and Description of New England: Vermont, Austin Jacobs Coolidge and John Brainard Mansfield, Boston: Austin J.

Trial, acquittal and subsequent lawsuit  In 2004, Deutsch, Oded Golan and two others were indicted in a Jerusalem court on charges of forgery. The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) claimed that the four were part of a forgery ring that had been operating for more than 20 years, misleading collectors of biblical artifacts into purchasing modern-day forgeries. In 2012, Deutsch was acquitted of all charges, with the presiding judge severely criticizing the Israeli police's handling of the evidence.

The character of the reserve is defined by flooded gravel pits and wet grassland, providing an excellent habitat for large variety of wetland flora and fauna. The site forms part of the larger Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Protection Area.Irthlingborough Lakes and Meadows: About Us. Retrieved 30 December 2015. It is situated in close proximity to several other Wildlife Trust nature reserves, such as Higham Ferrers Pits, Wilson's Pits and Ditchford Lakes and Meadows, significantly improving the benefit for wildlife by creating joined- up protected landscapes. It is adjacent to Stanwick Lakes, a reserve managed by the Rockingham Forest Trust. History Originally water meadows and agricultural fields straddling both sides of the River Nene, the site has been transformed significantly in recent history. The first such intervention was the construction of the Northampton to Peterborough Railway, which opened in 1845. During its construction, ironstone was discovered in the Nene Valley. Following the outbreak of World War I, in 1916, the Ebbw Vale Mining Company commenced operations, producing around 6000 tons of ore per week.Irthlingborough Lakes and Meadows: Heritage: Iron Ore Mining. Retrieved 30 December 2015. The most recent and most impactful intervention on the landscape began in the 1970s, with the large scale extraction of sand and gravel along the Nene Valley. An electric conveyor belt was constructed following the now disused railway line to transport the material to a processing plant at nearby Stanwick Lakes. By the time operations ceased in 2002, more than 1.5 million tons of aggregate had been extracted from the area. The pits were then allowed to flood, creating the present day series of lakes and channels.Irthlingborough Lakes and Meadows: The Lakes and Scrapes. Retrieved 30 December 2015. In 2012, with help from a Heritage Lottery Fund grant and public donations, the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire purchased the neglected site. It is now the focus of some of the trust's most important work as part of the Nene Valley Living Landscapes conservation scheme. To maximize the reserve's benefit for wildlife and biodiversity, numerous improvement works have been undertaken. These include the creation of new islands and removal of willow and electricity pylons.Northamptonshire Telegraph: Living Nene Project sees Irthlingborough Lakes and Meadows transformed.

Management A variety of different management techniques are being used to maintain and bolster the reserve's benefit for wildlife. Within the wetland areas, ditches are periodically cleared, scrub is removed and trees copsed to maintain the open nature of the gravel pits.

After retiring, the two put together an idea to create a product which would allow athletes to keep their feet warm, dry and comfortable at all times during the games and developed an exterior shoe product called dryfeet that is rolled over soccer, football or rugby boots and significantly reduces the weight of the shoes during wet and cold conditions during games and training. The Company has since produced several lines of clothing, such as HauteD, Aggression, BioSkyn Apparel and Barefuta. In 2016 the Company has signed several deals with Brazilian football clubs, such as Atletico Mineiro and Fluminense and have acquired four manufacturing factories in Brazil.  Sponsorship  In 2016 it was announced that Dryworld reached the deal to sponsor Brazilian soccer clubs Fluminense, Goi√°s and Atl√©tico Mineiro. Goi√°s was the first club to officially present the kit and wear it during competitive games.

It begins at a spring complex in the Cascade Range on Pumice Flat in the Umpqua National Forest and flows north into the North Umpqua in Kelsay Valley, upstream of Lemolo Lake. Evidence suggests that nearby Thirsty Creek has an underground connection to the Spring River and that underground connections from other sources exist. Hydrology The underground water feeding the springs emerges along the contact between glacial deposits and ash-flow deposits that form the bedrock. Although Spring River and other nearby spring-fed streams are short, their total water contribution to the North Umpqua is significant, especially during dry months. Thirsty Creek is a perennial stream that flows on the surface upstream of Spring River but sinks underground about before reaching it. Even so, it appears likely to researchers that it is part of the same watershed and contributes to the Spring River flow. Evidence also suggests that below- surface connections from elsewhere feed into Spring River.

Caruso's multifaceted conglomerate comprises five performance companies, a dance conservatory, a fitness program, and a dance movement therapy system, all under the auspices of the Bodiography brand. The alliance of organizations under her leadership include a production syndicate titled M-Train Productions, a fully functional multipurpose dance studio and performance space in her Movement Factory, the dance conservatory Bodiography Center for Movement, an affiliation with an academic institution of higher learning at La Roche University where she chairs the Performing Arts Department, and a publication known as the Arts Inclusive. All the encompassing entities led by Ms. Caruso's vision are known for their commitment to health and wellness in the arts and their championing of positive change in communities regionally and globally.  Personal life  Caruso is married to Dr. Alan Russell. Dr. Russell is the Vice President of Biologics at Amgen. Caruso has five step-children.  Early Training  Maria Caruso grew up in Rural Valley, PA, outside of Pittsburgh. Caruso's mother and father split when she was young, and dance soon became a therapeutic outlet for her. Luba Takamoto was Maria's first influential teacher. Working with Takamoto instilled the academic value of dance in Caruso. Maria then studied at Sue Hewitt Dance Studio in Indiana, PA, and Hewitt became another of Maria's early mentors. Caruso graduated high school early, at age 16, and continued her education as a BFA student in Florida State University‚Äôs dance program. While studying at Florida State, Maria began to mature and no longer fit the traditional ballet body stereotypes. Anjali Austin, one of Maria's professors, became her mentor at FSU and helped her through this period. This inspired Caruso to later open a school that would serve the needs of dancers with non-stereotypical ballet bodies. After graduation from FSU and returning to Pittsburgh, Caruso earned a master's degree in professional leadership from Carlow University.  Dance performance career  Caruso's performance career includes work with artists such as Anjali Austin, Ilana Suprun Clyde, Ze‚Äôeva Cohen, Lynne Taylor Corbett, Johan Renvall, and James Martin. Upon retirement from dancing with Bodiography in 2015, Caruso traveled the world with her solo work and continues to do so to date. In 2017, she created her first full- length mixed genre solo concert, titled Phoenix Rising, where she worked to incorporate genres of dance that she had never performed, such as hip-hop, lindy hop, and art installation, along with modern, contemporary, and ballet works. In 2018, Caruso was honored to receive a license from Martha Graham Resources to perform Martha Graham‚Äôs iconic Lamentation solo, for which she has continued to perform on select solo tours. This same year, she also premiered another solo show, titled Metamorphosis, at the Karmiel Dance Festival in Israel. Her performances of both were met with critical acclaim and she continues to tour with the work internationally. She has also reengaged with Bodiography performing lead roles with her company during thecompany‚Äôs home season and on tour.  Acting Career  Caruso had her acting debut in 2020 playing a leading role, Connie Scuccifuffio, in Anthony J Wilkinson's My Big Gay Italian Midlife Crisis, directed by Sonia Blangiardo.  Bodiography  Caruso founded Bodiography in New York City in 2000. The company was relocated to the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Squirrel Hill at the historic site of Gene Kelly‚Äôs dance studio in 2001 and is home to a professional contemporary ballet company ballet company, a sister company in Charlotte, North Carolina, a company of retired artists in BCB3, a pre- professional company in BCB2, fitness and wellness programs, a dance injury clinic in partnership with UPMC Health Plan, and a dance conservatory with an accredited college preparatory program in collaboration with La Roche University. Bodiography Contemporary Ballet, now called Maria Caruso‚Äôs Bodiography, presents a multi-genre movement vocabulary including modern, jazz, and pedestrian movement solidly supported by the classical ballet technique. The teaching and performing artists of Bodiography engage in a full performance and tour season while maintaining educational outreach engagements at Bodiography Center for Movement, La Roche University, and a variety of public and private schools and arts education institutions in the region. Caruso's creation of the Bodiography¬Æ Fitness and Strength Training System is based on a system of compounding exercises with the utilization of multiple props in a mat based class. The program has found great success particularly on the east coast of the United States. With over 100 trained instructors in a variety of fitness and dance environments, the fitness system assists in spreading the company's over arching message of dance being an inclusive art form. Beyond the national reach of the program, the Bodiography¬Æ Fitness and Strength Training System classes can be found in many places in the Pittsburgh area, and Caruso‚Äôs fitness video is available to the world having launched in June of 2019. The creation of the Bodiography¬Æ Dance Movement Therapy System is based on the extraction of human emotion as a means of creative expression. Through the use of a choreographic algorithm, Caruso's system works to create movement structures and phrases based on the thoughts, feelings, and ideas of individuals with shared experiences. The movement therapy system is currently being utilized in a variety of hospitals, schools, and behavioral health programs across the US through certified facilitators.

McKinley, a Republican and former Governor of Ohio, defeated the joint Democratic and Populist nominee, William Jennings Bryan, as well as minor- party candidates. McKinley's decisive victory in what is sometimes seen as a realigning election ended a period of close presidential contests, and ushered in an era of dominance for the Republican Party. McKinley was born in 1843 in Niles, Ohio. After service as an Army officer in the Civil War, he became a lawyer and settled in Canton, Ohio. In 1876 he was elected to Congress, and he remained there most of the time until 1890, when he was defeated for re- election in a gerrymandered district. By this time he was considered a likely presidential candidate, especially after being elected governor in 1891 and 1893. McKinley had incautiously co-signed the loans of a friend, and demands for repayment were made on him when his friend went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893. Personal insolvency would have removed McKinley as a factor in the 1896 campaign, but he was rescued from this by businessmen who supported him, led by his friend and political manager, Mark Hanna. With that obstacle removed, Hanna built McKinley's campaign organization through 1895 and 1896. McKinley refused to deal with the eastern bosses such as Thomas Platt and Matthew Quay, and they tried to block his nomination by encouraging state favorite son candidates to run and prevent McKinley from getting a majority of delegate votes at the Republican National Convention, which might force him to make deals on political patronage. Their efforts were in vain, as the large, efficient McKinley organization swept him to a first ballot victory at the convention, with New Jersey's Garret Hobart as his running mate. McKinley was a noted protectionist, and was confident of winning an election fought on that question. But it was free silver that became the issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voters that free silver would be harmful, and once that had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley stayed at home in Canton, running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in his campaign. Supported by the well-to-do, urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the Electoral College. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep the Republicans in power most of the time until 1932. Background William McKinley William McKinley was born in Niles, Ohio in 1843. He left college to work as a teacher, and enlisted in the Union Army when the American Civil War broke out in 1861. He served throughout the war, ending it as a brevet major. Afterwards, he attended Albany Law School in New York state, and was admitted to the bar in Ohio. He settled in Canton, Ohio; after practicing law there, he was elected to Congress in 1876, and except for short periods served there until 1891. In 1890 he was defeated for re- election, but he was elected governor the following year, serving two two-year terms. In the latter part of the 19th century, Ohio was deemed a crucial battleground state; taking its electoral votes was thought essential for a Republican to win the White House. One way of, hopefully, assuring victory there was to nominate a son of Ohio. Between 1865 and 1929, every Republican president who first gained his office by election (that is, rather than succeeding on the death of his predecessor) was born in Ohio. Deadlocked Republican conventions in 1876, 1880, and 1888 turned to men born in Ohio, and in each case the nominee won the presidency. Thus, any successful Ohio Republican was a plausible president. One of McKinley's rivals among the Ohio contenders was Governor Joseph B. Foraker, but Foraker's light dimmed when he was defeated for a third two-year term in 1889. There were strong factional conflicts within the Ohio Republican party; one source of bitterness was the 1888 Republican National Convention. Ohio Republicans had endorsed the state's senior senator, John Sherman, for president. This was Sherman's third attempt at the Republican nomination; among his supporters were Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna, and Governor Foraker, whom Hanna had to that point strongly supported. After repeated balloting, Sherman did not get close to the number of delegate votes needed to nominate, and when rumors swept the convention that the party's 1884 nominee, former Maine senator James G. Blaine, might enter the race, Foraker expressed willingness to support Blaine. This dealt a serious blow to Sherman's candidacy by showing division in his home state, and the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was Ohio-born and went on to be elected. McKinley had received some delegate votes, and his action in refusing to consider a candidacy while pledged to support Sherman impressed Mark Hanna. The industrialist was outraged at Foraker and abandoned him. McKinley and Hanna shared similar political views, including support for a tariff to protect and encourage American industry, and in the years following 1888, Hanna became a strong supporter of McKinley. Duke Tobacco Company considered him a presidential possibility that year and issued a card for him.alt=A cigarette card bearing a colour image of a politician, denoted to be \\"William McKinley Jr of Ohio\\"; the grey-haired man's head points to the left with a neutral expression. Revenue from tariffs was then a major source of income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential election had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue only‚Äîthat is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for gerrymandering him out of his seat. Sometime between 1888 and 1890, McKinley decided to run for president, but to have a realistic chance of attaining that goal, he needed to regain office. Foraker's ambition then was the Senate‚Äîhe planned to challenge Sherman in the legislative election to be held in January 1892‚Äîand he agreed to nominate McKinley for governor at the state convention in Columbus. McKinley was elected, and Sherman narrowly turned back Foraker's challenge with considerable help from Hanna. Harrison had proven unpopular even in his own party, and by the start of 1892, McKinley was talked about as a potential presidential candidate. McKinley's name was not offered in nomination at the 1892 Republican National Convention, where he served as permanent chairman, but some delegates voted for him anyway, and he finished third behind Harrison (who won a first ballot victory) and Blaine. Hanna had sought support from delegates, but his and McKinley's strategy is uncertain, due to lack of surviving documents. According to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, \\"McKinley's behavior at the convention supports the idea that he liked the attention but was not ready for a campaign\\". According to McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan, many delegates \\"saw in [McKinley] their nominee for 1896\\". Gaining the nomination =Preparing for a run= Puck magazine cartoon shows the Republicans following the path of the gold standard which President Grover Cleveland (right) has blazed. McKinley, wearing a large black hat, walks behind Hanna (in red). Harrison was defeated in the November 1892 election by former president Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, who returned to the White House in March 1893. President Harrison left office proclaiming the nation's prosperity, but in May, amid economic uncertainty that caused many people to convert assets into gold, the stock market crashed, and many firms went bankrupt. The depression that ensued became known as the Panic of 1893. Among those who became insolvent in 1893 was a McKinley friend, Robert Walker. McKinley had co-signed promissory notes for Walker, and thought the total to be $17,000. Walker had deceived McKinley, telling the governor that fresh loans were renewals of old ones, and the total indebtedness, for which McKinley had made himself liable, was over $130,000. That sum was beyond McKinley's means, and he planned to resign and earn the money as a lawyer. He was rescued by Hanna and other wealthy supporters, who raised the money to pay the loans. According to McKinley biographer Kevin Phillips, the governor's backers \\"paid off the cosigned notes so that McKinley‚Äîby now, the probable next president‚Äîdid not need to go back to practicing law\\". The public sympathized with McKinley for his financial trouble, and he was easily re- elected as governor in late 1893. At that time, the United States, for all practical purposes, was on the gold standard. Many Democrats, and some Republicans, felt that the gold standard limited economic growth, and supported bimetallism, making silver legal tender, as it had been until the passage of the Coinage Act of 1873. Doing so would likely be inflationary, permitting holders of silver to deposit bullion at the mints, and receive payment for about twice the silver's 1896 market value. Many farmers, faced with the long decline in agricultural prices that persisted through the first half of the 1890s, felt that bimetallism would expand the money supply and make it easier to pay their debts. Cleveland was a firm supporter of the gold standard, and believed the massive amounts of silver-backed currency issued pursuant to the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 had helped crash the economy. In 1893 he forced through the act's repeal, outraging western Democrats such as Nebraska Congressman William Jennings Bryan. The Democratic Congress in 1894 passed the Wilson‚ÄìGorman Tariff, significantly lowering many rates from the McKinley Tariff of 1890. The economy did not improve in 1894, and other Cleveland actions, such as federal intervention to halt the Pullman strike, further split his party, The 1894 election campaign saw the Democrats divided, and the electorate further split by the new People's Party (or Populists), which had emerged from the agricultural discontent. There were more demands for McKinley to speak than he could possibly fulfill. Campaigning throughout the eastern half of the country on behalf of Republican candidates, and venturing even to New Orleans in the Democratic Solid South, McKinley spoke to large, enthusiastic crowds as often as 23 times in a day. According to his biographer Margaret Leech, \\"McKinley's fervor was irresistible to his audiences. He was better than a spellbinder. He was a vote-getter. The whirlwind campaign of the Governor of Ohio was a sensation of the autumn.\\" The 1894 elections saw the Democrats suffer the greatest losses by a majority party in congressional history, as the Republicans again took control of both houses. =First modern primary campaign= McKinley's close friend and adviser Mark Hanna The outcome of the 1894 elections made it increasingly likely that a Republican would be the next president. At the time, the presidential nominating process started much later than it subsequently would, and McKinley, in quietly organizing his campaign with Hanna's aid in the early months of 1895, was alone among the candidates in acting so early. Other potential Republican candidates were former president Harrison, incoming Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine, Iowa Senator William B. Allison, and several state favorite sons, such as Illinois Senator Shelby Cullom. If former president Harrison entered the race, he would immediately become a major contender, and uncertainty over his status hung over the race in 1895. At the time, unless there was an incumbent elected Republican president, the nomination was generally not decided until the convention, with state political bosses and delegates exacting a price for their support. A candidate's efforts to gain the nomination did not begin until shortly before the state delegate conventions in the spring of the election year, where fights over the makeup of the delegation often focused on who would be on it, rather than who delegates would support. McKinley and Hanna decided on a systematic nationwide effort to gain the nomination, employing what onetime presidential adviser Karl Rove‚Äîauthor of a 2015 book on the 1896 race‚Äîcalled \\"the first modern primary campaign\\". To devote himself full-time to McKinley's presidential campaign, Hanna in 1895 turned over management of his companies to his brother Leonard, and rented a house in Thomasville, Georgia, expressing a dislike for Cleveland's winters. He was joined there by William and Ida McKinley in early 1895. The location was a plausibly nonpolitical vacation spot for McKinley, and also permitted him to meet many southern Republicans, including blacks. Although southern Republicans rarely had local electoral success, they elected a substantial number of delegates to the national convention. McKinley and Hanna hosted many southern Republican leaders in Thomasville, subsidizing those who did not have the money to come, and made many converts. The governor also traveled in the South; in Savannah at the end of March 1895, he became the first presidential hopeful in American history to address an audience of blacks when he spoke at an African American church. By the time he left Thomasville, he had gained the support of the majority of likely southern delegates; Platt wrote mournfully in his autobiography that Hanna \\"had the South practically solid before some of us awakened\\". In giving attention to national affairs, McKinley neglected his home front in Ohio, and when the Republican state convention met in Zanesville in May 1895, it proved to be controlled by the resurgent Foraker, who sought the Senate seat to be filled by the Ohio General Assembly in January 1896. That convention endorsed McKinley for president and Foraker for Senate, and nominated Foraker supporters for state and party offices, including Asa Bushnell to succeed McKinley as governor. McKinley realized that it would be risky to have a faction hostile to the presidential candidate within his home state, and sought an alliance, campaigning for Bushnell and for a Republican legislature that would send Foraker to Washington. The voters chose Bushnell and gave the state Republicans a large majority in the legislature. In January 1896, Foraker was overwhelmingly elected (to take office in March 1897), and McKinley gained Foraker's agreement to support him for president, assuring party political peace at home. Iowa Senator William B. Allison was a contender for the 1896 Republican presidential nomination. During 1895, Hanna journeyed east to meet with the political bosses there, including Pennsylvania Senator Matthew Quay and Thomas C. Platt of New York. He returned to report that the bosses were willing to assure McKinley's nomination in exchange for a pledge to give them control over patronage in their states and a promise in writing that Platt would be Treasury Secretary. McKinley was unwilling to deal, seeking a nomination without strings, and Hanna, though noting that this made his task much harder, undertook to get it. McKinley decided on a theme for his nomination campaign, \\"The People Against the Bosses\\". With Hanna's aid, McKinley found talented men to run the state organizations, who would in turn find locals to ensure McKinley triumphed at the series of conventions that would elect delegates to the June 1896 Republican convention in St. Louis. Notable among these appointments was Charles G. Dawes in Illinois, a young banker and entrepreneur who had recently moved to Chicago from Nebraska, where he had known Congressman Bryan. In trying to organize Illinois for McKinley, Dawes faced the enmity of the local Republican bosses, who preferred to take a delegation to St. Louis that would support Senator Cullom until the bosses made the right deal. McKinley left office as governor in January 1896. In February, Harrison made it clear that he would not seek a third nomination. Hanna's operatives immediately organized Harrison's home state of Indiana for McKinley with a haste that the former president privately found unseemly. By early 1896, the Reed and Allison campaigns were beginning to form themselves, but they had little luck in Indiana. McKinley challenged his rivals everywhere except in states, such as Iowa, that he deemed had serious candidates like Senator Allison. The favorite son candidacies of Minnesota Senator Cushman K. Davis and former Nebraska senator Charles F. Manderson fell victim to the McKinley forces, well-financed by Hanna, who took their states away from them. McKinley was disliked by the American Protective Association, an anti-Catholic group angered that as governor he had appointed to office members of that faith. Their wide pamphleting caused Hanna to act against falsehoods that his candidate was a Catholic. According to historian Stanley Jones in his account of the 1896 campaign, \\"another feature common to the Reed and Allison campaigns was their failure to make headway against the tide which was running toward McKinley. In fact, both campaigns from the moment they were launched were in retreat.\\" In March and April 1896, state conventions in Ohio, Michigan, California, Indiana, and other states elected delegates to the national convention, instructed to vote for McKinley. In New England, McKinley made inroads into Reed's regional support, as New Hampshire proclaimed no preference between the Speaker and McKinley, and the Vermont convention expressed support for McKinley. The Ohioan was not successful everywhere; Iowa remained loyally behind Allison, Morton won a majority of the New York delegation, and the bosses were successful in denying McKinley in New Mexico Territory and Oklahoma Territory. The contest was still undetermined going into the April 29 Illinois state convention, with the McKinley forces led by Dawes against the local bosses. McKinley gained most of Illinois' delegates, giving him a sizable lead, and influencing remaining state conventions to jump on his bandwagon. McKinley remained well ahead when the state conventions concluded, leaving his opponents' only hope the Republican National Committee (RNC), which would make initial rulings on which delegates would be seated; there were contested seats or rival delegations in several states, and rulings against McKinley could still deprive him of a first-ballot majority. When the RNC met in mid-June, just prior to the convention, McKinley was easily victorious in almost all cases. =Republican convention= The 1896 Republican National Convention convened at the Wigwam, a temporary structure in St. Louis, on June 16. With most credentials battles settled in McKinley's favor, the roll of delegates drawn up by the RNC heavily favored the Ohioan, though Reed, Allison, Morton and Quay remained in the race. The credentials report served as a test vote, which the McKinley forces won easily. Hanna, who was a delegate from Ohio, was in full control of the convention. Louis Dalrymple cartoon from Puck magazine, June 24, 1896, shows McKinley about to crown himself with the Republican nomination. The \\"priests\\" are Hanna (in green) and Congressman Charles H. Grosvenor (red); H. H. Kohlsaat is the page holding the robe. Many westerners, including Republicans, were supporters of free silver. McKinley's advisors had anticipated there would be strong feelings about the currency question, and pressed the candidate for a decision on what the party platform should say on the subject. McKinley had hoped to avoid this issue; his surrogates had presented him as firmly for the gold standard in the East, where support for that policy was strong. Western supporters, who often favored silver, were told he was sympathetic to the bimetallic cause. In the following years, several McKinley associates, including publisher H. H. Kohlsaat and Wisconsin's Henry C. Payne, took credit for including an explicit mention of the gold standard in the platform's currency plank (for they deemed it vital to the Republican victory in November), but it was not inserted in the draft until Hanna consulted with McKinley by telephone. The silver Republicans from the West were led by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller, who drafted a plank promoting free silver, only to see it voted down in the drafting committee, and in the full Platform Committee. Teller was determined to have the full convention vote on his language, although it was certain he would lose as most Republican delegates favored the gold standard. The debate was held on June 18. After Teller's minority report was voted down and the gold plank adopted by an overwhelming majority, 23 delegates, including Teller and his Senate colleagues Frank Cannon of Utah and Fred Dubois of Idaho, walked out of the convention and thus left the Republican Party. Amid a tumultuous scene, an angry Hanna was seen standing on a chair, shouting at the departing men, \\"Go! Go! Go!\\" Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, wanting the convention to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded to the presidential nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate the unity of the Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles. Garret Hobart of New Jersey, McKinley's running mate This left the question of the vice presidential candidate. McKinley had offered the second place on the ticket to Reed, who had refused it. Platt wanted Morton, who had been vice president under Harrison; the New York governor did not want it, and McKinley did not want him. It was usual at that time for major-party tickets to have one candidate from Ohio or Indiana, and the other from New York, but with that state having supported Morton for the nomination, putting a New Yorker on the ticket would be an unmerited reward. RNC vice chairman Garret Hobart was from Paterson, New Jersey, near to New York City. He was a businessman, lawyer, and former state legislator, and was acceptable to Hanna and other Republican backers while being popular among party activists. Several days before the convention, McKinley chose him as running mate, though no announcement was made. At the convention, Hobart expressed surprise in a letter to his wife, but his selection had been strongly rumored and buttons with his name and McKinley's seen in St. Louis. Delegates ratified the selection of Hobart, nominating him on the first ballot. General election campaign =Getting an opponent= In the days after the Republican convention, McKinley remained in Canton. Hanna had been elected chairman of the RNC during the convention; he established campaign headquarters in Chicago, in the electorally-crucial Midwest, appointed an executive committee and began to organize the campaign, which as chairman was his responsibility. McKinley oversaw the activities of Hanna and other key managers, and addressed delegations of workers who came to visit him. He met with Hobart, who came to Canton on a brief visit on June 30, 1896, and who joined his running mate in speaking to a crowd of visitors. In his speeches, McKinley concentrated on tariffs, which he expected to dominate the campaign, and gave short shrift to the currency question. As McKinley awaited his opponent, he privately commented on the nationwide debate over silver, stating to his Canton crony, Judge William R. Day, \\"This money matter is unduly prominent. In thirty days you won't hear anything about it.\\" The future Secretary of State and Supreme Court justice responded: \\"In my opinion in thirty days you won't hear of anything else.\\" At the time McKinley was nominated, it was not clear who his Democratic rival would be. Cleveland's opponents within his party had mobilized into an organized effort to take over the Democratic Party and pass a platform supporting free silver. The platform was deemed of highest priority, and only once that fight was won was a candidate for president to be considered. Despite this resolution, several Democrats sought the nomination, with the foremost being former Missouri representative Richard P. Bland and former Iowa governor Horace Boies. Others either seeking or spoken of for the nomination included South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, and former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan. alt=A man in his thirties wearing a dark suit holds his hands together in front of him as he looks to his right. In the background can be seen the stars and stripes. Dawes had known Bryan in Nebraska, and predicted that if the former congressman got to address the convention, he would use his skills as a speaker to stampede it to a nomination. McKinley and Hanna mocked Dawes, telling him that Bland would be the Democratic choice. The 1896 Democratic National Convention opened in Chicago on July 7, with the silverites in full control; they drafted a platform supporting free silver. The final speaker during the debate on the platform was former congressman Bryan, who with Dawes in the gallery delivered a speech decrying the gold standard that to Democrats, according to Phillips, was \\"messianic‚Äîa call to arms\\". Dawes deemed his friend's Cross of Gold speech magnificent, though with \\"pitiably weak\\" logic, but it won Bryan the presidential nomination, and Phillips noted that the address \\"unnerved Midwestern Republicans, mindful of their own distrust of the East, and threw a weighty stone into the quiet pool of June GOP electoral assumptions\\". When journalist Murat Halstead telephoned McKinley from Chicago to inform him that Bryan would be nominated, he responded dismissively and hung up the phone. Bryan's nomination briefly gratified the Republicans, believing that his selection would lead to an easy victory for McKinley. In those days when the presidential campaign did not begin in earnest until September, Hanna had planned a vacation while McKinley anticipated a quiet summer. The Republicans were caught by surprise by the wave of enthusiasm that Bryan's speech and nomination caused, and scuttled these plans; as Hanna wrote to McKinley on July 16, \\"the Chicago convention has changed everything\\". =Fundraising and organization= McKinley, (lower right) running his campaign from the library of his Canton home Hanna quickly realized that the currency issue struck an emotional chord in many Americans, and decided on a campaign to persuade the voter that \\"sound money\\", the gold standard unless modified by international agreement, was much preferable to bimetallism. Such propaganda would not be cheap, as before the age of television and radio, the most effective way of reaching the electorate was through the written word, and through public speakers who would address meetings on behalf of the candidate. This would take money, and Hanna undertook to secure it from his corporate connections. As Hanna began his fundraising efforts in late July, the Populists met in St. Louis. Faced with splitting the silver vote, they chose to endorse Bryan, beginning their dissolution as a party. Large sums had to be spent quickly, and Hanna energetically built a businesslike campaign. Bryan's surge contributed to a sense of crisis that enabled Hanna to make peace in his party, eventually uniting all behind McKinley with the exception of some Silver Republicans. But as the campaign began operations, and began them on a huge scale, money was short. Hanna initially spent much of his time in New York, where many financiers were based. He faced resistance at first, both because he was not yet widely known on the national scene, and because some moneymen, although appalled at the Democratic position on the currency issue, felt Bryan was so extreme that McKinley was sure to win. Others were disappointed New York Governor Morton was not the presidential nominee, but their support became warmer as they came to know McKinley and Hanna. Reports of Bryan support in the crucial Midwest, and intervention by Hanna's old schoolmate, John D. Rockefeller (his Standard Oil gave $250,000), made executives more willing to listen. After a gloomy August for the campaign's fundraising, in September, corporate moguls \\"opened their purse strings to Hanna\\". J. P. Morgan gave $250,000. Dawes recorded an official figure for fundraising of $3,570,397.13, twice what the Republicans had raised in 1892, and as much as ten times what Bryan may have had to spend. Dawes' figure did not include fundraising by state and local committees, nor in-kind donations such as railroad fare discounts, which were heavily subsidized for Republican political travelers, including the delegations going to see McKinley. Estimates of what Republicans may have raised in total have ranged as high as $16.5 million. From his house on North Market Street in Canton, McKinley ran his campaign, with telephone and telegraph at his disposal. Hanna was busy meeting with executives to extract funds, and delegated much of the day-to-day policymaking to others, most prominently Dawes, who was a member of the campaign executive committee and was responsible for distributing much of the money that Hanna raised. Payne was nominally in charge of the Chicago office, but Dawes, a member of the McKinley inner circle, had more influence. Pamphlets were sent from Chicago in carload lots across the country. The campaign spent almost $500,000 on printing alone, which Stanley Jones, in his account of the 1896 campaign, estimated paid for hundreds of millions of pamphlets. The campaign paid for hundreds of speakers to stump on McKinley's behalf. Efforts were made to keep expenses down; Dawes insisted on competitive bidding, and most of his top-level hires were business associates, not political operatives. Others prominent in the Chicago office included Charles Dick, the secretary of the organization and later a senator. =Front porch campaign= From the moment he was nominated, McKinley was beset by supporters coming to Canton to hail him, hoping to hear him give a political speech. McKinley remained in Canton, available to the public every day but Sunday, continuously from his June nomination until Election Day in November, excepting one trip in July to give previously arranged nonpolitical speeches in Cleveland and at Mount Union College. He also took one weekend of rest in late August. The need to greet and speak to supporters made it difficult for McKinley to get campaign work done; one political club interrupted his conference with Hobart in late June. McKinley complained that his time was not being well managed. Bryan's announcement, after gaining the Democratic nomination, that he would undertake a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him. Hanna especially urged his candidate to hit the road. McKinley decided against this, feeling that he could not outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant stump speaker, and that he would be foolish to try. \\"I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to think when I speak.\\" Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people. The front porch campaign that McKinley decided on was a natural extension of the pilgrimages to Canton by McKinley devotees that were already occurring. After a few initial stumbles, things settled into routine by mid-September. While any group could visit McKinley by writing in advance, his campaign arranged for many of them, and they came from towns small and large. If possible, the group's leader was brought to Canton in advance to confer with McKinley on what each would say; if not, the group would be met at the Canton railroad station by a McKinley representative, who would discuss what would be said with the group's leader. There were parades every day in Canton that campaign season, as the groups marched through the bunting-draped streets, escorted by a mounted troop known as the McKinley Home Guards, who saw to it that groups arrived at the McKinley residence on a prearranged schedule. There, the group leader would deliver his remarks, and McKinley would deliver a reply often prepared in advance. Afterwards, there might be refreshments or the opportunity to shake hands with McKinley, before the delegation was escorted off for their return journey to the railroad station. If it rained, the meetings took place in one of several indoor venues. A delegation at the front porch of Republican presidential candidate William McKinley in Canton, Ohio, October 1896; McKinley, just right of center, holds a top hat. William McKinley home, Canton, Ohio (published 1914) Bicycling was the latest craze in the United States in 1896, and among those who came to salute McKinley was a brigade of bicyclists, who pulled images of McKinley and Hobart behind their vehicles, and performed tricks as they went to see their presidential candidate. The people of Canton joined in enthusiastically, and restaurants and souvenir venders expanded their operations. A popular source of keepsakes was the wood of McKinley's front porch or fence, whittled as supporters listened, and the blades of his lawn, when not trampled underfoot, made later appearances in scrapbooks. In between delegations, McKinley entertained visitors; future Secretary of State John Hay, a major backer, came to Canton reluctantly, not relishing the crowds, but wrote \\"he met me at the [railroad] station, gave me meat & took me upstairs and talked for two hours as calmly & serenely as if we were summer boarders in Bethlehem, at a loss for means to kill time. I was more struck than ever with his mask. It is a genuine Italian ecclesiastical face of the XVth Century.\\" With his campaign ill-financed, Bryan was his own greatest asset, and traveled to 27 of the 45 states, logging , and in his estimated 600 speeches reached some 5,000,000 listeners. McKinley did not match those numbers, speaking 300 times to 750,000 visitors, but in remaining at home, he avoided the fatigue of Bryan's exhausting tour. The Republican was better able to provide fresh material for the next day's newspapers without making gaffes; Bryan made several. According to R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 campaign, \\"The Front Porch Campaign was a remarkable success.\\" =Issues and tactics= Bryan's nomination caused defections and divisions in the Republican party; many farmers in the Midwest, even in McKinley's Ohio, found the inflation it was expected free silver would cause to be attractive, as it would make it easier to repay debts. Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe for the Republicans. William and Ida McKinley (to her husband's left) pose with members of the \\"Flower Delegation\\" from Oil City, Pennsylvania, before the McKinley home. Although women could not vote in most states, they might influence male relatives and were encouraged to visit Canton. By early in August, the McKinley campaign had decided upon a strategy: appeal to labor and established farmers. McKinley, on the urgent advice of his advisers, by the middle of that month had decided that the currency question must be addressed immediately, and the campaign machine began the process of generating millions of publications and sending hundreds of speakers into the field. The pamphlets contained quotes or articles from McKinley, members of Congress, and financial experts on why a bimetallic standard would be ruinous to the country. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the New York City Police Commission, recalled seeing boxcars full of paper being dispatched when he visited the Chicago headquarters in August. For the benefit of those who did not read English, there were pamphlets in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Yiddish, German, Polish, Norwegian, Italian, Danish, and Dutch. Pre-written articles were sent to periodicals, and the campaign paid for friendly newspapers to be sent to thousands of citizens across the country for the duration. Five million families received McKinley campaign materials on a weekly basis. Among the surrogates sent out on McKinley's behalf was newspaper editor Warren G. Harding, paid to make speeches across Ohio. The future president made a positive impression and three years later was elected to the Ohio State Senate, beginning his political rise. On his front porch, McKinley urged sound money, though he never ceased to promote protectionism to support American industry. Horner noted, \\"the campaign effectively linked both gold and protectionism with patriotism.\\" McKinley felt that he could not campaign entirely on the money issue, as many midwestern Republicans who supported silver considered protection the major issue of the campaign, and would stay with the party if it promoted tariffs. These issues were given different emphases sectionally: in the East and South, the money issue was stressed most strongly, while tariffs were given more attention in the Midwest. McKinley had little support in the mining-dominated Rocky Mountain states, where even most Republicans were for silver and Bryan. On the Pacific coast, where there was strong silver sentiment, but where McKinley had some hope of winning, the tariff was made the major issue. McKinley soothed ruffled feathers of party bigwigs by mail and in person. Though former president Harrison refused to tour, he gave a speech in New York where he railed against free silver, stating, \\"the first dirty errand that a dirty dollar does is to cheat the workingman\\". The public was closely following the campaign, and the Republican efforts had their effect. In September, polls showed the midwestern states leaning Republican, though silver-supporting Iowa was still close. McKinley's running mate, Hobart, continued to look after his law practice and business interests, and was apparently a major contributor to the Republican campaign. He helped to run the New York office, gave some speeches from his own front porch in Paterson, and in October went on a short campaign tour of New Jersey, though he was a reluctant public speaker. Hobart was much stronger for the gold standard than was McKinley, and made clear his views in his speeches. Homer Davenport's portrayal of the McKinley‚ÄìHanna relationship William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal was hostile to McKinley throughout the campaign; prior to the Republican convention, Alfred Henry Lewis accused Hanna of acting on behalf of a syndicate, controlling McKinley. During the general election campaign, the Democratic newspapers, especially the papers owned by Hearst, attacked Hanna for his supposed role as McKinley's political master. These articles and cartoons have contributed to a lasting popular belief that McKinley was not his own man, but that he was effectively owned by the corporations, through Hanna. Homer Davenport's cartoons for the Hearst papers were especially effective in molding public opinion about Hanna, who was often depicted as \\"Dollar Mark\\", in a suit decorated with dollar signs (a term for which \\"dollar mark\\" was a common alternative). McKinley's 1893 personal financial crisis allowed him to be convincingly depicted as a child, helpless in the hands of businessmen and their mere tool in the 1896 campaign. Hearst and the Journal gave $41,000 to Bryan's campaign, one of the largest the Democrats received, but that amount was dwarfed by the sums raised by Hanna. September saw Maine and Vermont go heavily Republican in their state elections, meaning the Northeast was likely safe for McKinley. Early in that month, dissident Democrats, who favored the gold standard and President Cleveland's policies, formed the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats, meeting in Indianapolis. The nomination of Illinois Senator John M. Palmer for president and former Kentucky governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for vice president meant Bryan would have to overcome an electoral split in his party. Hanna applauded the selection, and predicted it would get large numbers of votes. There was no chance Palmer would win the election, and Hanna saw to it that the Gold Democrats were aided with quietly-provided funds. The Midwest was the crucial battleground, and both parties poured in their resources, with Bryan spending most of his time there, as did Hanna. McKinley and Hanna began to sense that the flood of materials and speakers on the silver question had had their effect in the Midwest. Dawes began to slow the flow of pamphlets against silver, and set loose a flood of material favoring McKinley's tariff policies. Events favored the Republicans: wheat prices rose considerably in the final weeks of the campaign, lessening the enthusiasm of farmers for free silver. The Democrats alleged that Republicans were coercing workers into voting for McKinley on threat of losing their jobs; Hanna denied it, and offered a reward for evidence, that was not claimed. To Bryan's outrage, Hanna called for a \\"Flag Day\\" for the final Saturday, October 31, as the campaign again sought to link support for McKinley to patriotism, a theme echoed by the candidate as he addressed his final delegations. Hundreds of thousands marched through the streets of the nation's cities in honor of the flag; New York City saw its largest parade since 1865. Election day was November 3; on its eve Hanna and Dawes predicted overwhelming victory. Election Stanley Jones wrote of the 1896 campaign: Voters cast their ballots on November 3, and that evening gathered in cities and around telegraph offices. In places like New York, the results were projected by stereopticon onto the sides of newspaper buildings. The election was considered by many to be the most crucial since 1860, and large numbers of voters followed the returns all night. McKinley cast his ballot early, going with his brother Abner to the polling place, and met Hanna for lunch. That evening, McKinley sat in his library as the returns came in by telegraph. It was quickly apparent that McKinley was leading, and by midnight he had pencilled the figure \\"241\\" on a pad, the number of electoral votes of states that were certain, enough for victory. Hanna wired from Cleveland to Canton, \\"The feeling here beggars description ... I will not attempt bulletins. You are elected to the highest office of the land by a people who always loved and trusted you.\\" Map showing the results of the 1896 campaign, with electoral votes won noted; states won by McKinley are in red. McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest, and broke into the border states to win Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and West Virginia. He won North Dakota, and came close in South Dakota, Kansas, and in Bryan's Nebraska. McKinley was also successful in California and Oregon. McKinley won with 7.1 million votes to Bryan's 6.5 million, 51% to 47%. The electoral vote was not as close: 271 for McKinley to 176 for Bryan. McKinley increased the Republican vote by 2,000,000 from Harrison's defeat in 1892, though Bryan also increased the Democratic total. Bryan had hoped to sweep the rural vote and make inroads on urban labor, but he was not successful. McKinley became the first Republican candidate to win in New York City, and won in its rival city of Brooklyn as well. He lost only one city with a population of over 45,000 in the Midwest, and won many rural counties in crucial states. Although Bryan won all states south of Kentucky and from Texas east, McKinley won most urban centers there. Irish immigrants generally remained loyal to the Democratic Party, but McKinley's promises of sound money attracted German-Americans who were appalled by Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans had long been Democratic; efforts by that party to rebut McKinley, including circulating a statement by Bismarck in support of bimetallism, were ineffective. Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association had for him. Appraisal Karl Rove saw several reasons for McKinley's triumph. McKinley campaigned on big issues, the tariff and sound money. The candidate went after Bryan's strongest issue, silver, arguing that bimetallism would harm Americans and hit the working class hardest. McKinley's theme was that it was morally wrong to debase the currency; he linked his stand for sound money with the tariff and with patriotism, appealing to crucial voter blocs who gave McKinley the biggest victory in a presidential election since Grant in 1872. He reached out to immigrants and urban factory workers, recognizing their importance in a changing America. And to implement these strategies, McKinley, with Hanna's aid, created a larger, more organized campaign structure than had previously been seen in presidential campaigns. Jones noted, \\"The Republican Party, under the skillful leadership of McKinley and Hanna, produced a combination of votes which gave it the victory in 1896 and which promised Republican ascendency for many years in the future.\\" The 1896 presidential race is often considered a realigning election, when there is a major shift in voting patterns, upsetting the political balance. McKinley was supported by middle-class and wealthy voters, urban laborers, and prosperous farmers; this coalition would keep the Republicans mostly in power until the 1930s. McKinley's wooing of the Midwest would pay ample dividends in the years to come, as it remained solidly Republican in most years until 1932. Williams suggested that McKinley's campaign of education of the voter through speakers and literature brought him victory, but with a cost to the close identification between voters and the political parties that was typical in the 19th century. Voter turnout was almost 80 percent in 1896, about average for presidential elections in the late 19th century, but then dropped substantially and remained at lower levels as voters, who once participated in rallies and torchlight processions for candidates, were distracted by radio and by professional sports. Nevertheless, later campaigns tried to recapture the magic of 1896; Warren G. Harding conducted his own front porch campaign in 1920, even borrowing the flagpole from McKinley's old front yard. William D. Harpine, studying McKinley's rhetoric during the front porch campaign, argued that McKinley's campaign was in some ways ahead of its time, \\"even in the age of broadcasting, most candidates for nationwide office embark on a campaign tour. In 1896, long before the advent of broadcasting, McKinley accomplished the same purpose as a modem candidate, and did so without making a campaign tour.\\" The visits of the delegations to the McKinley home in Canton constituted a series of media events that McKinley used to get his speeches into the newspapers. In speaking from his front porch, McKinley was not principally addressing the delegations, but the many Americans who would not visit Canton, and who would read the speeches in newspapers. Williams agreed, \\"the remarkable Front Porch Campaign used modern technology to bring 750,000 visitors to his small hometown and dispatched his message nationwide.\\" Rove, while an advisor to Texas Governor George W. Bush during the 2000 election campaign, often spoke of the parallels he saw between McKinley and his 1896 campaign, and the 2000 election, going so far as to fax copies of books on McKinley. The media took the parallels further than Rove intended, making comparisons between him and Hanna, hinting that Rove controlled Bush like it was said Hanna controlled McKinley. Williams also saw the lasting effect of McKinley's 1896 campaign, \\"a new approach to campaigning, the educational or merchandising style, continues to mold campaigns today, as does McKinley's focus on message, Hanna's use of money, and Dawes's reliance on efficiency and education ... more than a century later, Americans and their political leaders can still learn from the events of the 1890s, whose lessons echo down the years today.\\" Harpine saw McKinley's personal touch as key to his successful race: Results (a) Includes 222,583 votes as the People's nominee. (b) Sewall was Bryan's Democratic running mate. (c) Watson was Bryan's People's running mate.

Enclosure There are some different recommendations for what cage size is appropriate for hamsters. HSS (Hamster Society Singapore) recommend a minimum unbroken floor space of 4000 cm2 (620 in2) for Syrian Hamsters.Hamster Society Singapore While TVT (Tier√§rztliche Vereinigung f√ºr Tierschutz) recommend you give Syrian Hamsters as much space as you can and at minimum 100 cm x 50 cm x 50cm (L x W x H) which is a floor space of 5000 cm2 (775 in2). Tier√§rztliche Vereinigung f√ºr Tierschutz e.V., Merkblatt Nr. 156 - Heimtiere: Goldhamster (Stand: 2014), pets: golden hamster, Housing BMEL ( Bundesministerium f√ºr Ern√§hrung und Landwirtschaft, the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture) like TVT also recommend a minimum of 5000 cm2 (775 in2) for Syrian Hamsters.Bundesministerium f√ºr Ern√§hrung und Landwirtschaft, the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Haltung von S√§ugetieren, 15.4.1 Enclosure requirements The bedding should not be pine, cedarwood, soft wood, or corn cob shavings because those have been known to cause respiratory problems. Corn Cob shavings do not pose a threat to a hamster's respiratory system, but instead pose a threat to their weight, for this bedding is edible, and some hamsters enjoy nibbling it. That increases the risk of obesity. Paper-Based bedding is much a safer alternative. The cage should also include an exercise wheel. The wheel must be an appropriate size for the hamster. For Syrian hamsters, a diameter of 9 inches is a minimum (studies have found that they prefer 14 inches. The running surface cannot be wire or mesh because that can cause bumblefoot.) Silent spinner wheels are a good alternative. The cage should also provide a sheltering structure for sleeping; this can be as simple as an opaque tube closed at one end. Environment Hamsters should experience light for 12‚Äì16 hours a day. Among other health effects, daily exposure to light influences the estrous cycle of females and hamsters thrive with regular light. Hamsters prefer humidity levels of 40-60%.This is the same as the human comfort level. Breeding hamsters prefer a room temperature between and , whereas hamsters who are not breeding prefer between and . Hamsters prefer quiet rooms and become stressed when sudden noise disturbs them. Diet Syrian hamster eating corn In the wild hamsters are omnivorous but mostly eat plants. For domesticated hamster researchers design diets to maximize growth, breeding, milk production in mothers, and the maintenance of health in adult hamsters. The diet of the hamster is less studied than the diet of other laboratory rodents. A typical nutrient recommendation for a hamster diet is 17-23% crude protein, 4.5% crude fat, and 6-8% crude fiber. Hamster diet must include Vitamin E. Vegetables which are good for hamsters include cucumber, carrots, celery, kale, and lettuce (however iceberg lettuce isn't good for a hamster). Apples are an appropriate fruit to offer. Domestic hamsters begin to eat food pellets when they are 7‚Äì10 days old. Every day adult hamsters eat 7-15 grams of the food. Food should not only consist of pellets, so a mix of seeds and other hamster-safe ingredients is best. Treats are not important to hamster's health but will increase their trust in you if hand-fed. Treats such as sunflower seeds and yogurt drops are great for hamsters; though do be aware that yogurt drops must only be given at most once a week because of the amount of sugar in them. Any more than once a week is too much sugar for a hamster. Hamsters will drink up to 10ml of water for every 100g of hamster bodyweight. Nursing mother hamsters will want extra water. It can be difficult to provide fresh water to hamsters in a water dish because they are likely to soil the dish with bedding and need it changed twice daily. Water bowls are very easy to clean, and have a very natural drinking angle. Water bottles in cages must be positioned at a height which the hamster can reach without stretching. Hamsters hoard their food, and will carry it from where they find it to a hiding place. They seem to not care whether their food is served in a dish or placed on their floor. Uneaten fresh vegetables should be removed after a day or so to prevent rotting. Handling Holding a Syrian hamster Hamsters that are frequently and gently handled will learn to respond peacefully to being handled. However, enforcing trust by taming is very important. When hamsters bite, they bite in front of them. A typical hamster-holding technique is to grasp the hamster from above around its belly with a thumb and the third finger. With two hands, a hamster may be cupped and held while left free to walk on the palms. Sleeping hamsters often bite when disturbed. Allow a hamster several days to become familiar with its new home, and you. Then, gently offer it treats, which it will shortly take from your palm, beginning its willingness to be handled. It is important for a pet‚Äôs safety that owners know hamsters will jump from any platform without regard for height or consideration for their wellbeing. Hamsters are less likely to bite a bare hand than a gloved one. If a hamster seems like it might bite, but must be handled, it may be collected by allowing it to explore a can or jar. Exercise wheels TVT (Tier√§rztliche Vereinigung f√ºr Tierschutz) recommend wheels should be at least 30cm for Syrian Hamsters, since smaller diameters lead to permanent spinal curvatures, especially in young animals. They also recommend a solid running surface because rungs or mesh can cause injury.Tier√§rztliche Vereinigung f√ºr Tierschutz e.V., Merkblatt Nr. 62 - Heimtierhaltung, Tierschutzwidriges Zubeh√∂r (Stand: Jan. 2010), II.

Domestication In the first ten years after the 1930 start of the domestication of the Syrian hamster, 70 scientific articles were published based on Syrian hamster research and 6 of those were concerned caring for hamsters.Magalhaes 1968, p. 15 narrates the history by saying there were six, then references them as follows:  * Beitr√§ge zur Biologie, insbesondere Fortpflanzungsbiologie des Hamsters (Cricetus cricetus L.).

In the book Abdel-Samad claims Islam is over its peak. If root cause, he points to the contradiction that contemporary Muslims do consume the material achievements of modern society, but on a spiritual plane they are not open to much of associated concepts such as freedom, equality and religious criticism in modern society. Moreover, Muslims in the West are largely financially economically dependent on Western social order but despise the underlying moral values. The gap between Islam and society grows and loses its relevance. Adbel-Samad sees a solution in what he called a \\"post-Koran discourse\\" a religious-ethnical Islamic revival, but not literally on the Qu'ran word.

It is a unit in the United States National Research Council. Their mission is \\"to evaluate and to report on scientific, technological, and ethical use of animals and related biological resources, and of non-animal alternatives in non-food settings, such as research, testing, education, and production of pharmaceuticals\\". * Their core values are:  ILAR supports the responsible use of animals in research, testing, and education as a key component to advancing the health and quality of life of humans and animals.  ILAR promotes high-quality science and humane care and use of research animals based upon the principles of refinement, replacement, and reduction (the 3Rs) and high ethical standards.  ILAR fosters best practices that enhance human and animal welfare by organizing and disseminating information and by facilitating dialogue among interested parties. An important influential factor to the formation of the ILAR was scientist Paul Weiss by holding a conference on Animal Procurements in July 1952. After the conference, the organization was recommended in November 1952 as the Institute of Animal Resources. In 1953, the Institute of Animal Resources was formally established under the NRC Division of Biology and Agriculture. In 1956 it became the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources. The ILAR website contains a variety of resources, including current news, resources, event information and highlights. The institute is a part of the Division on Earth and Life Studies and continuously has studies in progress on their website that one can look into and research. Their current study in progress is called \\"Assessment of the Care and Use of Dogs in Research Funded by or Conducted at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\\". The Institute of Laboratory Animal Research also has a successful journal that started over 50 years ago in 1953. The most current published journal is the 57th volume and is currently being published by the Oxford University Press. The newest volume is called \\"Models of Viral-Induced Carcinogenesis and Oncolytic Viruses\\" The volume discusses different cancer forms relating to a variety of different animals. The ILAR also puts on workshops and one can look up previous workshops on their website. In addition to the workshops they also put on events. You can find information on upcoming and previous events they have had on their website. In 2011 the American Psychological Association criticized ILAR's 8th edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals for seeming like a list of requirements rather than guidelines.

In April 2014, Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (sourced from Lake Huron and the Detroit River) to the Flint River. Officials failed to apply corrosion inhibitors to the water. As a result, lead from aging pipes leached into the water supply, leading to extremely elevated levels of the heavy metal neurotoxin and exposing over 100,000 residents to elevated lead levels. A pair of scientific studies proved that lead contamination was present in the water supply. The city switched back to the Detroit water system on October 16, 2015. It later signed a 30-year contract with the new Great Lakes Water Authority on November 22, 2017. On January 5, 2016, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency in Genesee County, of which Flint is the major population center. Shortly thereafter, President Barack Obama declared a federal state of emergency, authorizing additional help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Between 6,000 and 12,000 children were exposed to drinking water with high levels of lead. The water supply change was also the cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the county that killed 12 people and affected another 87. Four government officials‚Äîone from the city of Flint, two from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), and one from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)‚Äîresigned over the mishandling of the crisis, and one additional MDEQ staff member was fired. Fifteen criminal cases have been filed against local and state officials in regard to the crisis, but only one minor conviction has been obtained, and all other charges have been dismissed or dropped. An extensive lead service pipe replacement effort has been underway since 2016, with innovative techniques such as machine learning being used to predict the number and location of lead pipes. In early 2017, some officials asserted that the water quality had returned to acceptable levels, but in January 2019, residents of Flint and surrounding suburbs as well as officials still expressed doubt about the cleanliness of the water. There were an estimated 2,500 lead service pipes still in place as of April 2019. As of August 31, 2020, 26,106 excavations of water service lines had been performed, resulting in the replacement of 9,734 lead pipes and the confirmation of 16,372 copper pipes. As of August 13, 2020, the city has inspected 91% of Flint homes for lead pipes, but still has 2,500 more to go. It expects to finish replacing lead pipes by November 30, 2020.Flint mayor announces new deadline to replace lead water service lines Michigan Radio, August 13, 2020 On August 20, 2020, the victims of the water crisis were awarded a combined settlement of $600 million, with 80% of that amount going to the families of children affected by the crisis.Youngest Flint water crisis victims to get 80 percent of historic $600 million settlement The Flint Journal via MLive.com, August 20, 2020  Timeline  Governor Rick Snyder and his administration were widely blamed for the decisions that led to the crisis, with numerous people calling for his resignation.

Chlorine, which kills microbes responsible for the disease, also reacts with heavy metals like lead and iron. High levels of lead and iron in Flint's water may have been responsible for the decreased amount of chlorine available. * March 12 ‚Äì Data from MDEQ Quality shows the spike in samples from Flint elementary schools that tested above 15 ppb of lead, the threshold under the EPA Lead and Copper Rule. * March 26 ‚Äì A study published in The Journal of Pediatrics shows blood lead levels in Flint children ages 5 and younger hit an all-time low in 2016. * April 2 ‚Äì A new study by the MDEQ reports that elevated lead levels were found in 4 percent of final water samples from Flint Community Schools. One school's results show lead levels at 100 ppb, six times the federal action level. * April 6 ‚Äì The state announces the distribution of free bottled water in the city is ending. Water distribution centers will close over the next few days, although water and replacement cartridges will still be available. In response, Mayor Weaver says the city plans to sue the state so it can continue. The program was funded through a $450 million federal loan, which had not run out. Michigan planned to end the distribution since tests of Flint's water show low lead levels. The distribution continues until the supply runs out. * April 7 ‚Äì Hundreds of Flint residents flee to water bottle distribution centers to gather remaining free water bottles. Residents are still worried about drinking water from taps, since not all of the pipelines have been switched. * April 12 ‚Äì A federal judge approves a $4.1M settlement to be used to test Flint children for lead poisoning. * April 13 ‚Äì The Natural Resources Defense Council announces the results of tests of 92 homes with lead service lines show the 90th percentile for lead is 4 ppb. * April 23 ‚Äì Flint resident LeeAnne Walters is awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize for her role in exposing the water crisis. * April 26 ‚Äì The EPA approves a $1.9 million grant to Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards for nationwide research of lead contamination in drinking water, to ensure of the safety of future generations. The grant will be used to help people where there is a suspicion of lead being in their drinking water but government officials are not acting on it. This project is said to target Michigan and Louisiana initially, and then it will branch out to other areas. * May 10 ‚Äì Mayor Weaver announces that Nestle will donate 1.6 million bottles of water (100,000 bottles of water per week) until September 3, 2018. Water will be available to Flint residents at distribution centers throughout the city. * May 16 ‚Äì Flint Department of Public Works Director Robert Bincsik sends a letter to the EPA saying there are still 14,000 lead service lines in the city, 15% more than previous projections. * May 27 ‚Äì Jordan Chariton Reports, the YouTube channel and reporting website, releases an investigative piece on TruthDig showing that the science and data used to declare the water safe in Flint were suspect. The report is featured on the May 31, 2018, episode of the Thom Hartmann Program. * June 14 ‚Äì Michigan enacts the strictest law in the United States for lead in drinking water, imposing a limit of 12 ppb, as opposed to the federal limit which is 15 ppb. This is projected to be achieved by 2025. * June 15 ‚Äì George Krisztian, an assistant director of MDEQ's Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance, says that Flint's 90th percentile for lead was 6 ppb in the first six months of the year, up since the state stopped bottled water deliveries to the city in April. The MDEQ also says it is ready to turn the testing program back over to the city. * July 11 ‚Äì Elon Musk states on Twitter: \\"Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.\\" * July 30 ‚Äì The MDEQ announces that in June and July 2018, of the 420 filtered water samples from Flint Public Schools tested, 100 percent were below 15 ppb of lead, and more than 99 percent met the 5 ppb bottled water standard. * August 21 ‚Äì NRDC and several local groups participate in a hearing regarding two major issues: whether the city can defend its lead service line inventory methods and whether the city should be required to install home water filters immediately following service line replacements to mitigate lead spikes in drinking water. *September 24 ‚Äì The mayor's office reports that a total of 15,031 pipes have been excavated at homes in Flint. This includes service lines to 7,233 homes that have been identified as lead and/or galvanized steel which have been replaced, including 1,005 homes newly discovered in 2018. * September 28 ‚Äì A report by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services says the Genesee County Health Department failed to help 85% of children diagnosed with high blood lead levels in 2016. *October 5 ‚Äì Elon Musk donates approximately $480,000 to the Flint school system to pay for UV filtration devices in all 12 schools; installation is expected to be completed by January 2019. *December 26 ‚Äì In a published interview, governor- elect Gretchen Whitmer pledges to restore free water distribution to Flint residents. =2019= On her first day in office, Governor Gretchen Whitmer directed state employees to immediately report to their department or agency director any threat to public health or safety. * January 2 ‚Äì In her first act as governor, Whitmer signs an executive directive requiring state employees to immediately report to their department or agency director any threat to public health or safety, an action inspired by the decisions made by her predecessor's administration that led to the water crisis. * January 4 ‚Äì Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel offers Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy the job of special prosecutor on the Flint water crisis criminal cases, succeeding Todd Flood. Worthy accepts the job on February 21. Flood is reassigned as special assistant attorney general on February 25, while several other attorneys join the prosecution teams. On April 29, Flood is fired by Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud, who claims he failed to \\"fully and properly\\" pursue potentially important evidence in criminal cases tied to the Flint water crisis. * February 18 ‚Äì A report posted online by the MDEQ says the 90th percentile for 51 high-risk homes tested in Flint from May through December 2018 was 4 ppb of lead‚Äîless than half the current federal and future state action level. * March 28 ‚Äì The March 2017 settlement is amended to require the city to replace thousands of lead service lines and return to using the machine learning model. By June 2019, the lead pipe hit rate rises to 60-70% for the excavations. * April 23 - Status Coup, an independent investigative reporting network co-founded by Jordan Chariton and Jenn Dize, releases the documentary Flushing Flint, which claims that the water testing by MDEQ was manipulated by MDEQ staff taking water samples after flushing running water from taps for several minutes before taking the samples, contrary to normal procedures for water testing for copper and lead, and by MDEQ staff telling residents that they should take water samples after flushing running water from their taps for several minutes. This would clearly contravene the EPA guidance that samples taken must be \\"first-draw samples at taps in homes/buildings\\". *May 30 ‚Äì A new study by Virginia Tech professors Marc Edwards and Sid Roy published in the peer-reviewed journal Water Research relies on years of data from routine measurements of metals in Flint's sewage sludge, showing a connection between rising levels of lead in city waste, blood lead levels in children and use of the Flint River as a water source. * June ‚Äì The researchers responsible for developing the machine learning model, Eric Schwartz and Jake Abernethy, form BlueConduit, a for-profit, social venture aimed at leveraging data science and machine learning to find and remove lead pipes around the country. *June 3 ‚Äì The government-issued phones of 65 state officials, including former Governor Snyder, are seized in a criminal investigation into the crisis. * June 13 ‚Äì Attorney General Nessel announces that charges will be dropped against eight people and investigations will be restarted in the scandal. * July 31 ‚Äì The city fails to meet its self- imposed deadline to replace all service lines and defaults to its legally binding deadline of January 1, 2020. * October 10 ‚Äì The EPA proposes updates to the Lead and Copper Rule, which has remained relatively unchanged since 1991. * December 31 - After falling short of a mandate to submit lead level testing results of at least 60 homes, the city asks for an extension to June 30, 2020, to do so. = 2020 = February 21 ‚Äì To date 25,042 water service lines have been excavated, resulting in the replacement of 9,516 lead pipes and the verification of 15,526 existing copper pipes. * April 16 ‚Äì An article is published giving details of evidence of corruption and a coverup by Governor Snyder and his \\"fixer\\" Rich Baird, and stating that the statute of limitations on some of the most serious felony misconduct-in-office charges will expire on April 25, 2020. Michigan state authorities deny that a deadline is approaching and say that criminal prosecutions will follow. * June 25 ‚Äì BlueConduit releases the Flint Service Line Map, which allows users to look at the probability that a particular residence is connected to a lead service line and see the progress of replacement efforts. Background Some water service lines in Flint were installed between 1901 and 1920. As with many other municipalities at the time, all of the service lines from the cast iron water mains to end users' homes were constructed of lead, because it was relatively inexpensive and easy to work. Lead from the pipes can leach into the water, especially if certain contaminants are present. However, the water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, where Flint had obtained its water since 1967, had been treated well enough that the leaching from the lead pipes was at levels considered acceptable by state and federal environmental protection agencies. There are an estimated 43,000 service lines in the city; these include 3,500 lead lines, 9,000 known galvanized steel lines, and 9,000 unknown service lines. Lead exposure across the U.S. has fallen dramatically since the 1980s, but no blood-lead level is considered completely safe. Children under age five, and especially infants and unborn children, bear the greatest risk of deleterious and irreversible health outcomes. From 2012 to 2016, the CDC set a \\"reference level\\" of 5 micrograms per deciliter (¬µg/dL), in order to target for case management the 2.5% of young American children with the highest blood-lead levels. At 45 ¬µg/dL, chelation therapy is considered. Among the many ways lead can enter a modern American's bloodstream is through lead plumbing. Acidic water makes it easier for the lead found in pipes, leaded solder, and brass faucets to dissolve and to enter a home's drinking water. Therefore, public water treatment systems are legally required to use control measures to make water less acidic. Plumbing that contains lead is often found in buildings constructed in the 1980s and earlier. Financial emergency From 2011 to 2015, Governor Snyder appointed four emergency managers to control Flint's finances. After 2015, the city continued to receive financial guidance under the lesser oversight of a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. Transition to a new water source In 2011, Genesee County initiated the switch to the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA); the KWA would supply water to both Genesee County and Flint. On March 25, 2013, the purchase of per day from the KWA was approved by the Flint City Council. The KWA informed the council that they could dig to Lake Huron (the new water supply) in 30 months using a bored tunnel. Ed Kurtz, Flint's emergency manager, along with Mayor Dayne Walling and Flint City Council, approved the action and awaited the State Treasurer's approval. Following this decision, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) negotiated with Flint officials by offering to restructure water payments. Flint refused, insisting that KWA was the best water supplier. DWSD argued that Flint could not spend more money on a new water system and that Lake Huron's system was more efficient. On April 1, 2013, DWSD demanded that the state deny Flint's request, as it would start a water war, which would essentially hurt DWSD. This press release also provided an option for Flint: the sale of raw, untreated water. Drain Commissioner Wright of Genesee County accused the DWSD of media negotiation and then replied, \\"It would be unprecedented for the state to force one community to enter into an agreement with another, simply to artificially help one community at the other's expense ... this is exactly what the [Detroit Water and Sewerage Department] is arguing ...\\" On April 15, 2013, State Treasurer Andy Dillon approved the water purchase contract with the KWA. Emergency Manager Kurtz signed the KWA water purchase agreement the following day. On April 17, the DWSD delivered its one-year termination notice after Flint rejected their last offer. The DWSD expected that Flint would reimburse the investments for the water system that benefited regional customers. Flint and Genesee County rejected such responsibility but indicated their willingness to purchase pipelines. In April 2014, to save about $5 million in under two years, Flint started treating water from the Flint River instead of purchasing Lake Huron water from Detroit. Previously, the Flint River was the backup water source. In June 2014, Flint's Emergency Manager Darnell Earley finalized the sale of a section of water pipeline to Genesee County for $3.9 million. This pipeline fed DWSD water into the county, and after the KWA pipeline was active, would service the eastern part of the county as well. By December 2014, the city had already invested $4 million into its water plant. On July 1, 2014, Earley gave operational authority to Mayor Dayne Walling over two city departments, including Public Works. It was later reported that by not adding a corrosion inhibitor, Flint was going to save about $140 per day. Early water contamination After the permanent switch to the Flint River, city residents began complaining about the color, taste, and odor of their water. In August and September 2014, city officials detected levels of coliform bacteria, so residents were advised to boil their water. MDEQ determined that cold weather, aging pipes, and a population decline were the cause of this bacteria. According to Stephen Busch, an MDEQ district supervisor, the city took appropriate measures to limit a recurrence. General Motors (GM) made the first complaint about the corrosivity of the water. GM stopped using Flint water in October 2014, after reporting that the water was corroding car parts. General Motors requested to switch back to the DWSD water source, which was later approved by city officials. Prior to August 2014, additional chlorine had been added to eliminate bacteria from the Flint River. This is likely the cause of a spike in trihalomethanes, unsafe chlorine byproducts, in one of eight water locations. Long-term exposure to these chemicals has been linked to cancer and other diseases. Following this test, the MDEQ placed Flint on violation notice but did not reveal the information to residents until January 2015. The employees of the Flint Public Library declared the water undrinkable after noticing that it was discolored, despite the city's claim that the water was safe. Since 2014, the library has provided safe water for the public alongside the state's most prominent bottled water provider. January and February 2015 tests showed that the city water met all health and safety standards. Nevertheless, the DWSD offered to reconnect Flint, waiving a $4 million connection fee, but was declined by Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose. MDEQ officials indicated that there is no \\"imminent threat to public health,\\" as the nature of the issue was \\"communicated poorly.\\" = Return to Detroit water = In March 2015, Flint voted to switch back to the DWSD. This vote was motivated by residential complaints and recommendations from Veolia North America to prevent the city from further violating the Safe Drinking Water Act. Ambrose disagreed with the reintroduction of the Detroit water source. Ambrose argued, \\"Flint water today is safe by all Environmental Protection Agency and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality standards, and the city is working daily to improve its quality.\\" In August 2015, it was found that local organizations observed that high concentrations of chloride caused the water to be orange and that the water contained high levels of lead. The lead levels were caused by the omission of orthophosphate treatments, which led to excessive pipe corrosion. Consequently, the three organizations, \\"... delivered more than 26,000 online petition signatures to Mayor Dayne Walling, demanding the city end its use of the Flint River and reconnect to the Detroit water system.\\" Flint's water supply was switched back to DWSD in October 2015. Subsequently, Flint started adding additional orthophosphate to the water to rebuild the pipe lining. On October 8, 2015, Snyder requested that Michigan legislators contribute $6 million of the $12 million for Flint to return to Lake Huron water. The city of Flint would pay $2 million, and the Flint-based Charles Stewart Mott Foundation would pay $4 million. Jim Ananich, the State Senator representing Flint, demanded that the state refund the $2 million to the city. Ananich also requested further emergency funding from the state and long-term funding to address the effects of the lead contamination. On March 2, 2016, Michigan declared that returning to the Detroit water system must be approved by the state. When approved, the city was granted an emergency loan of $7 million. On September 27, 2016, Flint officials announced that the city will continue to use Detroit water until a new stretch of pipeline is constructed and the Flint River is tested and treated by the KWA. From August 2015 to November 2016, median water lead levels began to go down again depending on the type of water service pipes each home had. In homes with copper pipes, the median water lead level dropped from 3.0 micrograms per liter (¬µg/L) to <1 ¬µg/L; galvanized steel service lines dropped from a median water lead level of 7.2 ¬µg/L to 1.9 ¬µg/L, and lead service lines dropped from a median water lead level of 9.9 ¬µg/L to 2.3 ¬µg/L. 1 ¬µg/L is equivalent to 1 part per billion. On December 9, 2016 the MDEQ reported that more than 96 percent of water samples in Flint residencies were below the EPA lead threshold of 15 ppb. On March 15, 2017, the Genesee County Water and Waste Services Advisory Board voted to construct a new pipeline; it would be a , connector to the KWA pipeline. The pipeline would allow the treatment of raw Lake Huron water, so the city of Flint could continue to buy pre-treated water from the Great Lakes Water Authority. The $12 million project will allow Flint to remain a customer of the GLWA until at least 2019. Lead exposure findings In January 2015, a public meeting was held, where citizens complained about the \\"bad water.\\" Residents complained about the taste, smell, and appearance of the water for 18 months before a Flint physician found highly elevated blood lead levels in the children of Flint. During that time period, MDEQ had insisted the water was safe to drink. A study by Virginia Tech researchers (see section below) determined that the river water, which, due to higher chloride concentration, is more corrosive than the lake water, was leaching lead from aging pipes. Mozhgan Savabieasfahani, an environmental toxicologist based in Ann Arbor, said this level of lead exposure is comparable with what the Iraqi people have experienced since the U.S. occupation in 2003. While the local outcry about Flint water quality was growing in early 2015, Flint water officials filed papers with state regulators purporting to show that \\"tests at Flint's water treatment plant had detected no lead and testing in homes had registered lead at acceptable levels.\\" The documents falsely claim that the city had tested tap water from homes with lead service lines, and therefore the highest lead- poisoning risks; however, the city did not know the locations of lead service lines, which city officials acknowledged in November 2015 after the Flint Journal/MLive published an article revealing the practice, using documents obtained under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. The Journal/MLive reported that the city had \\"disregarded federal rules requiring it to seek out homes with lead plumbing for testing, potentially leading the city and state to underestimate for months the extent of toxic lead leaching into Flint's tap water.\\" In a report released on March 1, 2016, 37 of the 423 recently tested sentinel sites had results above the 15 ppb limit. Eight of the samples exceeded 100 ppb. A 2017 study showed that significantly more samples exceeded the 15 ppb limit in the voluntary or homeowner-driven sampling program whereby concerned citizens decided to acquire a testing kit and conduct sampling on their own (non-sentinel sites). Studies See Education and research section for later studies. = Hurley Medical Center study I (2015) = Mona Hanna- Attisha led the first Hurley Medical Center lead poisoning study. On September 24, 2015, Hurley Medical Center in Flint released a study led by Mona Hanna- Attisha, the program director for pediatric residency at Hurley Children's Hospital, confirming that the proportion of infants and children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had nearly doubled since the city switched from the Detroit water system to using the Flint River as its water source. Using hospital records, Hanna-Attisha found that a steep rise in blood-lead levels corresponded to the city's switch in water sources. The study was initially dismissed by MDEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel, who repeated a familiar refrain: \\"Repeated testing indicated the water tested within acceptable levels.\\" Later, Wurfel apologized to Hanna-Attisha. The team's study appears in the February 2016 issue of American Journal of Public Health. Hanna-Attisha's research found that the average proportion of Flint children with elevated blood-lead levels (above five micrograms per deciliter, or 5 √ó 10 grams per 100 milliliters of blood) rose from 2.4% (2013, before the change in water source) to 4.9% (2015, after the change in water source). In areas where water lead levels were considered high at ‚â• 15 ppb, which is the maximum amount of lead allowed in water per the Safe Drinking Water Act Lead and Copper Rule, the average proportion of Flint children with elevated blood-lead levels rose from 4% to 10.6%. Michigan Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program data agree an increase occurred, suggesting an increase from 2.2% of children (May 2013 ‚Äì April 2014) to 3.0% (May 2014 ‚Äì April 2015). Hanna-Attisha's data were taken from hospital laboratory records for children less than five years old. Hanna- Attisha's sample numbers were large, both for the pre-switch and post-switch time periods and for Flint children (1,473) and for children not exposed to Flint water (2,202). Demographics were meaningfully different among the two groups. In terms of race, 24.4% of the children outside of Flint were African American, while 76.8% of the children in areas of high water lead levels (‚â• 15 ppb) were African American, and 67.0% of the children in areas of lower water lead levels (< 15 ppb) were African American. Children outside of Flint had a younger average age (1.86 years) compared to areas inside Flint (2.04-2.09 years). Socioeconomic status also represented a meaningful difference with children inside of Flint being more disadvantaged than those children who lived outside of Flint. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that elevated lead levels in children's blood was correlated with elevated lead levels in Flint water. Because lead screening is not completed for all children, such data may be skewed toward higher-risk children and thus overestimate lead exposure, especially in non‚Äìhigh-risk areas. Hanna-Attisha and Flint resident LeeAnne Walters were awarded PEN America's Freedom of Expression Courage Award on May 16, 2016. = Hurley Medical Center study II (2018) = In June 2018 the Journal of Pediatrics published a much expanded study of blood lead levels measured at Hurley Medical Center. The original 2015 study of Hurley records involved a total of 1,473 children \\"younger than 5 years\\" whose address could be mapped to a site inside Flint in two pre/post 8.5 month periods. The 2018 study, led by Hern√°n F. G√≥mez, involved 15,817 children \\"aged ‚â§ 5 years\\" over the 11-year period 2006‚Äì2016. Data for 2012‚Äì2016 were available from center's Epic EMR system; records for earlier years were scrounged from legacy systems. The results show an increase in the fraction of children with elevated lead blood levels immediately pre/post the water switch (from 2.2% to 3.7%); invoking a Bonferroni correction, G√≥mez argues the change is not statistically significant. These results are consistent with a CDC report which found that the fraction of \\"all children under age 6\\" with elevated lead blood level \\"was nearly 50 percent higher after the switch to Flint River water.\\" The striking result of G√≥mez et al. however is that during the 11-year period, the \\"crisis years\\" are actually the third and fourth lowest years for lead blood levels. That is, the upward blip during the water switch sits on a rapid declining curve (presumably because of the many lead mitigation projects that have been initiated nationally) so that blood lead levels during the crisis are actually lower than those two years earlier. = Virginia Tech water study = Marc Edwards led the first Virginia Tech Flint water study. In September 2015 a team from Virginia Tech arrived in Flint. Led by Marc Edwards, an expert on municipal water quality, the team came to perform lead level testing on the Flint water supply, working under a National Science Foundation grant. Edwards had been contacted by Flint resident LeeAnne Walters, whose family suffered from extreme health problems almost immediately following the switch to the Flint River water. Walters had attempted to act locally, but she was repeatedly ignored by city, state, and EPA officials. The study found that Flint water was \\"very corrosive\\" and \\"causing lead contamination in homes\\". It concluded in its report that \\"Flint River water leaches more lead from plumbing than does Detroit water. This is creating a public health threat in some Flint homes that have lead pipe or lead solder.\\" Edwards was shocked by the extent of the contamination, but even more so by the inaction of the proper authorities after being made well aware of the contamination. Edwards and his team found that at least a quarter of Flint households had levels of lead above the federal level of 15 ppb and that in some homes, lead levels were at 13,200 ppb. Edwards said, \\"It was the injustice of it all and that the very agencies that are paid to protect these residents from lead in water, knew or should've known after June at the very very latest of this year, that federal law was not being followed in Flint, and that these children and residents were not being protected. And the extent to which they went to cover this up exposes a new level of arrogance and uncaring that I have never encountered.\\" Edwards' team created a website called \\"Flint Water Study\\", with the main purposes of informing, and creating support for, Flint residents during the crisis. The site also summarized study results and became a comprehensive public database for all information related to the study. On January 11, 2016, the Virginia Tech research team led by Edwards announced that it had completed its work. Edwards said, \\"We now feel that Flint's kids are finally on their way to being protected and decisive actions are under way to ameliorate the harm that was done.\\" Edwards credited the Michigan ACLU and the group Water You Fighting For with doing the \\"critical work of collecting and coordinating\\" many water samples analyzed by the Virginia Tech team. Although the labor of the team (composed of scientists, investigators, graduate students, and undergraduates) was free, the investigation still spent more than $180,000 for such expenses as water testing and payment of Michigan Freedom of Information Act costs. A GoFundMe campaign has raised over $116,000 of the $150,000 needed for the team to recover its costs. On January 27, the city of Flint retained Edwards to monitor the city's water testing efforts. On March 1, 2016, the Virginia Tech team was given $80,000 from an EPA grant to re-test the lead levels in 271 Flint homes. On August 11, 2016, Kelsey Pieper, a member of Edwards' research team, said 45 percent of residents that collected samples in July for the lead testing program had no detectable level of particulate lead in their water supply. She added the study yielded a lead reading of 13.9 ppb, just below the federal action level of 15 ppb. However, Pieper acknowledged the sampling, which was conducted by volunteer residents, does not fulfill the testing requirements of the federal Lead and Copper Rule. State testing of the most-recent six month monitoring period, which began January 1 and complied with Lead and Copper Rule regulations, showed a 90th percentile lead reading of 20 ppb, which exceeds the federal action level. Roughly 93 percent of samples from the third round of expanded state sentinel site testing showed results below the lead action level. Edwards called the results the \\"beginning of the end\\" of the public health disaster associated with the water crisis. On December 2, 2016, Edwards said lead was not detected in 57 percent of 154 Flint homes tested in November 2016 ‚Äì up from 44 percent in July 2016. He also advised people to continue using filters. = Other test results = On January 24, 2017, the MDEQ told Mayor Weaver that the lead content of Flint water had fallen below the federal limit. The 90th percentile of lead concentrations in Flint was 12 ppb from July 2016 through December 2016‚Äîbelow the \\"action level\\" of 15 ppb. It was 20 ppb in the prior six-month period. On the next day, Flint spokeswoman Kristin Moore said that anywhere from 18,000 to 28,000 homes in the city still needed service lines replaced, and that the city was planning to complete 6,000 homes per year through 2019. On March 7, 2017, MDEQ reported that Flint water sampled in February registered below the federal threshold for lead with 90 percent of samples at or below 8 ppb. February's water tests marked the seventh straight month in which city water was below the action level. February's testing also showed 95.8 percent of samples taken at homes at risk of high lead levels were at or below 15 ppb. On June 9, 2017, the MDEQ reported their May 2017 testing showed 90 percent of Tier I samples at or below 6 ppb of lead with 93.1 percent of the samples at or below 15 ppb. On April 23, 2019, Status Coup released the documentary Flushing Flint which claimed that the water testing conducted by MDEQ was falsified by MDEQ staff taking water samples after flushing running water from taps for several minutes before taking the samples, contrary to normal procedures for water testing, and by MDEQ staff telling residents that they should take water samples after flushing running water from their taps for several minutes. This would clearly contravene the EPA guidance that samples taken must be \\"first-draw samples at taps in homes/buildings\\". These claims cast doubt on the MDEQ reports of improvements in water quality over previous years. Possible link to Legionnaires' disease spike On January 13, 2016, Snyder said that 87 cases of Legionnaires' disease, a waterborne disease, were reported in Genesee County from June 2014 ‚Äì November 2015, resulting in 12 deaths (two more people later died from the disease). Although the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) said that there is no evidence of a clear link between the spike in cases and the water system change, Edwards stated the contaminated Flint water could be linked to the spike. In a second report released January 21, state researchers had still not pin-pointed the source of the outbreak. The next day, an official at McLaren Regional Medical Center in Flint confirmed that there was a spike in Legionella cases in Flint and elsewhere in Genesee County, but noted that there was \\"no definitive data to support that McLaren Flint is the source of exposure for any patient testing positive for the Legionella antigen.\\" The family of one of the people who died of Legionnaires filed a $100 million lawsuit against McLaren. The Flint Journal obtained documents via the Michigan Freedom of Information Act on the Legionnaires' outbreak and published an article on them on January 16, 2016. The documents indicated that on October 17, 2014, employees of the Genesee County Health Department and the Flint water treatment plant met to discuss the county's \\"concerns regarding the increase in Legionella cases and possible association with the municipal water system.\\" By early October 2014, officials at MDEQ were aware of a possible link between the water in Flint and the Legionnaires' outbreak, but the public was never informed, and the agency gave assurances about water safety in public statements and at public forums. An internal email on January 27, 2015, from a supervisor at the health department said that the Flint water treatment plant had not responded in months to \\"multiple written and verbal requests\\" for information. In January 2015, following a breakdown in communication between the city and the county on the Legionnaires' investigation, the county filed a FOIA request with the city, seeking \\"specific water testing locations and laboratory results ... for coliform, E-coli, heterotrophic bacteria and trihalomethanes\\" and other information. In April 2015, the county health department contacted the CDC, and in April 2015 a CDC employee wrote in an email that the Legionnaires' outbreak was \\"very large, one of the largest we know of in the past decade and community-wide, and in our opinion and experience it needs a comprehensive investigation.\\" However, MDHHS told the county health department at the time that federal assistance was not necessary. Emails obtained by Progress Michigan in February 2016 indicate Snyder's office knew about the outbreak since March 2015, despite Snyder's claim he was only informed in January 2016. On March 11, 2016, Governor Snyder ordered an investigation of the MDHHS regarding the outbreak. On February 16, 2017, the CDC discovered the first genetic links between city water and patients diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County. \\"The presence of Legionella in Flint was widespread,\\" said Janet Stout, a research associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a national expert on the disease. \\"The (laboratory) results show that strains (of the bacteria) were throughout the water system.\\" Virginia Tech researcher Amy Pruden published a study that found Legionella levels up to 1,000 times higher than normal tap water in Flint, and said finding a patient whose clinical isolates‚Äîor bacteria‚Äîmatched the McLaren water sample without having been hospitalized there \\"suggests that same strain may have been elsewhere.\\" On March 10, 2017, affidavits filed by experts in court supported the conclusion that Flint water was connected to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak. Janet Stout wrote in an affidavit: \\"(It) is my opinion to a reasonable degree of probability that the source water change and the subsequent management of the municipal water system caused conditions to develop within the municipal water distribution system that promoted Legionella growth and dispersion, amplification, and the significant increases in cases of Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County in 2014 and 2015.\\" J. David Krause, director of Forensic Analytical Consulting Services, and Hung K. Cheung, a doctor specializing in environmental and occupational medicine agreed with her claims. On February 5, 2018, a study published in the journals Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and mBio concluded that the 2014-2015 outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Flint was caused by low levels of chlorine which, at higher levels, would have made it difficult for bacteria to replicate. Because chlorine reacts with heavy metals like lead and iron, high levels of both in Flint's water may have been responsible for the decreased amount of chlorine available. On December 4, 2019, research institute KWR from the Netherlands published the results of their re-investigation of the outbreak in Environmental Health Perspectives. They found evidence for three sources: strong evidence for exposure to a Flint hospital in 2014 and 2015 for 42 of 86 confirmed cases, and weaker evidence for exposure to city water at home or living in the proximity of a specific cluster of cooling towers, both only in 2014. Each source could be associated with only a proportion of cases. They concluded that focus on a single source may have delayed recognition and remediation of other significant sources of L. pneumophila and provided recommendations to improve Legionella prevention. Inquiries, investigations, resignations, and release of documents One focus of inquiry is when Snyder became aware of the issue, and how much he knew about it. In a July 2015 email, Dennis Muchmore (Snyder's chief of staff) wrote to a Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) official, \\"I'm frustrated by the water issue in Flint. I really don't think people are getting the benefit of the doubt. These folks are scared and worried about the health impacts and they are basically getting blown off by us (as a state we're just not sympathizing with their plight).\\" In a separate email sent on July 22, 2015, MDHHS local health services director Mark Miller wrote to colleagues that it \\"Sounds like the issue is old lead service lines.\\" These emails were obtained under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act by Virginia Tech researchers studying the crisis and were released to the public in the first week of January 2016. In October 2015, it was reported that the city government's data on lead water lines in the city was stored on 45,000 index cards (some dating back a century) located in filing cabinets in Flint's public utility building. The Department of Public Works said that it was trying to transition the data into an electronic spreadsheet program, but as of October 1, 2015, only about 25% of the index card information had been digitized. On October 21, 2015, Snyder announced the creation of a five-member Flint Water Advisory Task Force, consisting of Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and Chris Kolb of the Michigan Environmental Council (co-chairs) and Matthew Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Lawrence Reynolds of Mott Children's Health Center in Flint. On December 29, 2015, the Task Force released its preliminary report, saying that MDEQ bore ultimate blame for the Flint water crisis. The task force wrote that the MDEQ's Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance adopted a \\"minimalist technical compliance approach\\" to water safety, which was \\"unacceptable and simply insufficient to the task of public protection.\\" The task force also found that \\"Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable.\\" The task force also found that MDEQ has failed to follow the federal Lead and Copper Rule. That rule requires \\"optimized corrosion control treatment,\\" but MDEQ staff instructed city of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion control treatment (CCT) would not be necessary for a year. The task force found that \\"the decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the contamination of the Flint water system.\\" The Flint Water Advisory Task Force's final report, released March 21, 2016, found the MDEQ, MDHHS, Governor's office, and the state-appointed emergency managers \\"fundamentally accountable\\" for the crisis, saying the people of Flint were \\"needlessly and tragically\\" exposed to toxic levels of lead and other hazards. The task force's findings prompted the resignation of MDEQ director Dan Wyant and communications director Brad Wurfel. Flint Department of Public Works director Howard Croft also resigned. On January 8, 2016, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said that it was investigating. A month later, they said they were working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the EPA's Office of Inspector General, the EPA's Criminal Investigation Division, and the Postal Inspection Service on the investigation. The EPA \\"battled Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality behind the scenes for at least six months over whether Flint needed to use chemical treatments to keep lead lines and plumbing connections from leaching into drinking water\\" and \\"did not publicize its concern that Flint residents' health was jeopardized by the state's insistence that such controls were not required by law\\". In 2015, EPA water expert Miguel A. Del Toral \\"identified potential problems with Flint's drinking water in February, confirmed the suspicions in April and summarized the looming problem\\" in an internal memo circulated on June 24, 2015. Despite these \\"dire warnings\\" from Del Toral, the memo was not publicly released until November 2015, after a revision and vetting process. In the interim, the EPA and MDEQ engaged in a dispute on how to interpret the Lead and Copper Rule. According to EPA administrator Susan Hedman, the EPA pushed to immediately implement corrosion controls in the interests of public health, while MDEQ sought to delay a decision on corrosion control until two six-month periods of sampling had been completed. Meanwhile, Wurfel called Del Toral a \\"rogue employee\\" for his whistle-blowing efforts. Marc Edwards, who investigated the lead contamination, wrote that Del Toral had made a \\"heroic effort\\" that was stymied by the EPA and MDEQ spending months \\"wrangling over jurisdiction, technicalities and legalities.\\" In an interview with the Detroit News published on January 12, 2016, Hedman said that \\"the recommendation to DEQ (regarding the need for corrosion controls) occurred at higher and higher levels during this time period. And the answer kept coming back from DEQ that 'no, we are not going to make a decision until after we see more testing results.'\\" Hedman said the EPA did not go public with its concerns earlier because (1) state and local governments have primary responsibility for drinking water quality and safety; (2) there was insufficient evidence at that point of the extent of the danger; and (3) the EPA's legal authority to compel the state to take action was unclear, and the EPA discussed the issue with its legal counsel, who only rendered an opinion in November. Hedman said the EPA discussed the issue with its legal counsel and urged the state to have MDHHS warn residents about the danger. On January 21, Hedman's resignation (effective February 1) was accepted. Assessments of the EPA's action varied. Edwards said that the assessment in Del Toral's original June memo was \\"100 percent accurate\\" and criticized the EPA for failing to take more immediate action. State Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich, Democrat of Flint, said, \\"There's been a failure at all levels to accurately assess the scale of the public health crisis in Flint, and that problem is ongoing. However, the EPA's Miguel Del Toral did excellent work in trying to expose this disaster. Anyone who read his memo and failed to act should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\\" Del Toral later told The Flint Journal, \\"I was stunned when I found out they did not have corrosion control in place. In my head, I didn't believe that. I thought: That can't be true ... that's so basic.\\" He also confirmed that unfiltered Flint water is still unsafe to drink, and did not know when that would change. On January 15, 2016, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced that his office would open an investigation into the crisis, saying the situation in Flint \\"is a human tragedy in which families are struggling with even the most basic parts of daily life.\\" To oversee the his office's probe, Schuette appointed Todd Flood as special prosecutor and Andrew Arena as chief investigator, who lead a team of nine full-time investigators. At a media roundtable in February 2016, Flood said that the investigation could result in involuntary manslaughter charges, if there was gross negligence leading to a death. Critics have questioned the objectivity of the investigation. In his annual State of the State address on January 19, 2016, Snyder announced that he would release all of his emails from 2014 and 2015 regarding the crisis. The following day, the governor's office released 274 pages of emails. The New York Times summarized, \\"the documents provide a glimpse of state leaders who were at times dismissive of the concerns of residents, seemed eager to place responsibility with local government and, even as the scientific testing was hinting at a larger problem, were reluctant to acknowledge it.\\" Later that month in a class action lawsuit related to the crisis, Snyder and the MDEQ were served subpoenas for the release of additional emails dating back to the beginning of 2011. Emails highlighted by Progress Michigan in January 2016 indicate that Michigan state officials were trucking in bottled water to some of their own employees stationed in Flint as early as January 2015 in regards to the unsafe levels of trihalomethanes. On January 22, 2016, two MDEQ employees (Liane Shekter Smith, former chief of the department's Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance; and Steve Busch, former district supervisor in the division) were suspended, pending an investigation, as a result of questions regarding actions related to water testing in Flint. In response, Snyder said, \\"Michiganders need to be able to depend on state government to do what's best for them and in the case of the DEQ that means ensuring their drinking water is safe. Some DEQ actions lacked common sense and that resulted in this terrible tragedy in Flint. I look forward to the results of the investigation to ensure these mistakes don't happen again.\\" Smith was fired on February 5, 2016. On January 25, 2016, the Genesee County Commission approved a request from Genesee County Prosecuting Attorney David Leyton for $25,000 to conduct an investigation into the crisis. The money will be used to hire two special prosecutors. On February 12, 2016, Governor Snyder released additional emails between his office and the MDEQ which about the Legionnaires' outbreak. On February 26, Snyder's office released several thousand more emails regarding the crisis that date back to 2011. An additional batch of emails was released on March 10. On March 4, 2016, a report released by the Michigan Auditor General's office called the MDEQ's Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance \\"not sufficient\\" in its oversight of the state's Community Water Supply Program. On July 13, 2016, the Mackinac Center for Public Policy sued MDEQ over the department's 121-day delay in responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests surrounding Flint, including a request for all emails from Shekter-Smith and Bush from 2013 through 2015 containing the word \\"Flint\\" and a list of \\"any employees transferred, reassigned, or suspended as a result of the Flint water issues.\\" The case was settled in November 2017, with a joint statement saying in part, \\"The parties also note there are circumstances for which the FOIA currently lacks certainty when documents must be provided. This lack of clarity can foster litigation over what response times are reasonable.\\" On April 16, 2020, an article was published giving details of evidence of corruption and a coverup by Snyder and his \\"fixer\\" Rich Baird, and stating that the statute of limitations on some of the most serious felony misconduct-in-office charges would expire on April 25, 2020. Responses from Michigan state authorities denied that a deadline was approaching and said that criminal prosecutions would follow. Legislative hearings =Federal= On January 14, 2016, U.S. Representative Brenda Lawrence formally requested congressional hearings on the crisis, saying: \\"We trust our government to protect the health and safety of our communities, and this includes the promise of clean water to drink.\\" The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform began their hearings on the crisis on February 3. U.S. Representative Dan Kildee from Flint gave an opening statement. The first witnesses were EPA acting deputy assistant administrator Joel Beauvais, Marc Edwards, new MDEQ Director Keith Creagh, and Flint resident LeeAnne Walters (who alerted EPA water expert Miguel A. Del Toral to the problem). On March 15, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee examining the Flint water crisis revealed the EPA, state, and municipal officials attempted to fix the situation behind the scenes according to hearing witness and former EPA regional administrator, Susan Hedman, who cited legal and enforcement challenges as the causes for her actions. Ex-Emergency Financial Manager Darnell Earley, Former Fint Mayor Dayne Walling, and Professor Marc Edwards also testified on that date's hearing. Governor Snyder and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy testified before that committee on March 17. On February 10, 2016, a separate committee, the U.S. House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, held a hearing on the crisis in which Hurley Medical Center pediatrician Mona Hanna-Attisha; Yanna Lambrinidou, president of Parents for Nontoxic Alternatives, an environmental health group; Flint schools Superintendent Bilal Kareem Tawwab; Eric Scorsone, an expert in local government finances from Michigan State University, and Mayor Karen Weaver testified. On April 13, 2016, the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy and Energy Subcommittee on Health held a joint hearing on the crisis in which Keith Creagh of MDEQ, Nick Lyon from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and Mona Hanna-Attisha of Hurley Medical Center testified. =State= On February 23, 2016, the Michigan State Legislature started a committee to investigate the crisis. On March 1, one of its members, Senator Jim Ananich of Flint, introduced a resolution that would grant state lawmakers probing the Flint water crisis subpoena power over the governor's office, which is immune to the state Freedom of Information Act. The committee's first hearing was on March 15, 2016. On March 29, 2016, the state's Joint Committee on the Flint Water Public Health Emergency held a hearing on the crisis in Flint during which residents and local experts testified. State of emergency and emergency responses =Local= Mayor Karen Weaver declared the city to be in a state of emergency on December 15, 2015. On December 15, 2015, Mayor Weaver declared the water issue as a citywide public health state of emergency to prompt help from state and federal officials. Weaver's declaration said that additional funding will be needed for special education, mental health, juvenile justice, and social services because of the behavioral and cognitive impacts of high blood lead levels. It was subsequently declared a countywide emergency by the Genesee County Board of Commissioners. Starting on January 7, 2016, Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell had work crews of offenders sentenced to community service begin delivering bottled water, water filters and replacement cartridges, primarily to residents living in homes built between 1901 and 1920, whose plumbing systems were most likely leaching lead into the water. The next week, he ordered his department to begin using reverse 911 to advise homebound residents on how to get help. On January 10, Mayor Weaver stressed to residents that it was important to also pick up the testing kits, as the city would like to receive at least 500 water test samples per week. On January 12, officers from the Michigan State Police and Genesee County Sheriff's Department started delivering cases of water, water filters, lead testing kits and replacement cartridges to residents who needed them. The American Red Cross has also been deployed to Flint to deliver bottled water and filters to residents. On January 14, it was announced Mona Hanna-Attisha will lead a Flint Pediatric Public Health Initiative that includes experts from the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, Hurley Children's Hospital, the Genesee County Health Department, and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to help Flint children diagnosed with lead poisoning. =State= On January 5, 2016, Governor Snyder declared Genesee County to be in a state of emergency. On January 6, Snyder ordered the Michigan Emergency Operations Center, operated by the Michigan State Police Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division, to open a Joint Information Center to coordinate public outreach and field questions from the residents about the problems caused by the crisis. The State Emergency Operations Center recommended that all Flint children under six years old get tested for lead levels as soon as possible, either by a primary care physician or the Genesee County Health Department. They also advised residents to call the United Way to receive additional help if needed. On January 11, Snyder signed an executive order creating a new committee to \\"work on long-term solutions to the Flint water situation and ongoing public health concerns affecting residents.\\" On January 13, Snyder activated the Michigan Army National Guard to assist the American Red Cross. On January 27, Snyder announced the establishment of the new 17-member Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee to \\"make recommendations regarding the health and welfare of people exposed to lead, study Flint's water infrastructure and determine potential upgrades, review Flint Water Task Force recommendations, and establish ways to improve communication between local and state government.\\" On March 2, Snyder announced the state would partner with the employment agency Michigan Works! Association to hire 81 Flint residents to work at water distribution sites throughout the city. On March 21, Governor Snyder released a 75-point relief plan for addressing the crisis, which includes programs in the fields of health and human services, education, water supply and infrastructure replacements, and jobs and economic development. On April 6, the state began offering up to $100,000 in grant money from the Disaster and Emergency Contingency Fund to local governments affected by the water crisis. On March 16, 2017, Governor Snyder created the Child Lead Exposure Elimination Commission and appointed Mona Hanna-Attisha of Flint's Hurley Medical Center, Rebecca Meuninck of Ann Arbor, deputy director of the Ecology Center; Paul Haan of Grand Rapids, executive director of the Healthy Homes Coalition of West Michigan, Inc.; and Lyke Thompson of Ann Arbor, director of the Center for Urban Studies at Wayne State University as its members. \\"Eliminating the risk of child lead exposure will require the coordination and expertise of people across all sectors,\\" Snyder said in the announcement. \\"Creating this permanent commission will help advance the strategies recommended to better protect Michigan children from lead exposure.\\" On the same day, Governor Snyder said will lower Michigan's \\"action level\\" from 15 ppb to 10 ppb. Snyder sent $28 million to Flint for supplies, medical care, and infrastructure upgrades and later budgeted an additional $30 million to Flint to provide water bill credits of 65% for residents and 20% for businesses. Another $165 million for lead pipe replacements and water bill reimbursements was approved by Snyder on June 29, 2016. On January 6, 2017, Snyder signed a bill that accelerated the public notice requirement for lead in drinking water to three business days, from the previous time of 30 days. =Federal= On January 9, 2016, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent two liaison officers to the Michigan Emergency Operations Center to work with the state to monitor the situation. On January 15, Snyder asked President Obama to grant a federal emergency/major disaster designation for Genesee County, seeking federal financial aid for emergency assistance and infrastructure repair in order to \\"protect the health, safety and welfare of Flint residents.\\" The following day, Obama signed an emergency declaration giving Flint up to $5 million in federal aid to handle the crisis. FEMA released a statement that said: > The President's action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, > Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster > relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and > suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to provide > appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under > Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to protect property and > public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe > in Genesee County. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to > alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures, > limited to direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent federal > funding. This emergency assistance is to provide water, water filters, water > filter cartridges, water test kits, and other necessary related items for a > period of no more than 90 days. After Snyder's request for a \\"Major Disaster Declaration\\" status was turned down, FEMA Administrator W. Craig Fugate wrote a letter to Snyder saying that the water contamination \\"does not meet the legal definition of a 'major disaster'\\" under federal law because \\"[t]he incident was not the result of a natural catastrophe, nor was it created by a fire, flood or explosion.\\" In response, Snyder asked Obama for emergency funding under FEMA's Individuals and Households Program, which provides housing assistance and replacement of personal property. He will also ask for money and emergency protective measures, according to the release. On March 3, 2016, Governor Snyder filed a second appeal for federal help to replace lead pipes and provide medical support and supplies for affected residents which said the estimated economic impact of the Flint water crisis is beginning to exceed $140 million. FEMA rejected his request again on March 16. The EPA issued a Safe Drinking Water Act Emergency Order and took over collecting and testing of water samples, while ordering state agencies to send them previously collected data, on January 21. A week later they advised residents to continue using water filters and drink only bottled water. On February 12, the USDA extended their nutrition programs for Flint children diagnosed with high blood lead levels. On the next day, Governor Snyder asked for additional help from Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program for affected Flint children. The Department of Health and Human Services granted his request on February 18, providing an additional $500,000 in Medicaid expansion for affected Flint children and pregnant women. On March 3, a waiver request to include pregnant women and people up to 21 years of age was approved. On March 1, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans to expand its Head Start Program to more Flint children affected by the crisis. On March 23, the U.S. Department of Labor announced up to $15 million in National Dislocated Worker Grants will help provide temporary jobs to assist with Flint's water crisis recovery. About 400 temporary jobs at water distribution centers throughout the city will be created through the grant. The workers will take the place of the Michigan National Guard soldiers who have been in place since January. On March 25, 2016, the EPA and FEMA extended the federal emergency until August 14, 2016. The state took over the emergency response after that date. A $170 million stopgap spending bill for repairing and upgrading the city of Flint's water system and helping with healthcare costs was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on December 8, 2016. The Senate approved it the next day. $100 million of the bill is for infrastructure repairs, $50 million for healthcare costs, and $20 million to pay back loans related to the crisis. Criminal prosecutions = 2016 = On April 20, 2016, criminal charges were filed against three people in regards to the crisis by Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette. Former MDEQ employees Michael Prysby and Stephen Busch are charged with misconduct in office, conspiracy to tamper with evidence, tampering with evidence, a treatment violation of the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, and a monitoring violation of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act; former city water plant operator Michael Glasgow was charged with willful neglect of office, a misdemeanor, and felony tampering with evidence. On May 4, 2016 Glasgow accepted a plea deal with prosecutors, admitting to filing false information about lead in Flint water and agreeing to cooperate in other prosecutions. Exactly a year later, the case against Glasgow was dismissed, with prosecutors acknowledging his cooperation and the fact that he was the person who reported the crimes of his colleagues to the MDEQ. On July 29, 2016, Schuette charged six additional people with crimes in the crisis, three from MDEQ and three from the MDHHS. From MDEQ, Liane Shekter-Smith was charged with misconduct in office and willful neglect of duty; Adam Rosenthal was charged with misconduct in office, conspiracy to tamper with evidence, tampering with evidence, and neglect; Adam Cook was charged with misconduct in office, conspiracy to engage in misconduct in office, and neglect of duty. From the MDHHS, Nancy Peeler, Corinne Miller, and Robert Scott were charged with misconduct in office, conspiracy to commit misconduct in office, and willful neglect of duty. MDEQ and MDHHS released a joint statement later that day indicating Peeler, Scott, Cook, and Rosenthal had been suspended without pay. Miller retired in April and Shekter-Smith was fired in February. The cases were consolidated for preliminary hearing purposes on August 9, since the same witnesses were to testify against all defendants. On September 14, 2016, Miller pleaded no contest to the neglect of duty charge and agreed to testify against the other defendants. She was later sentenced to a year probation, 300 hours of community service, and fined $1,200. On December 20, 2016, Schuette filed false pretenses, conspiracy to commit false pretenses, willful neglect of duty and misconduct in office charges against former Emergency Managers Darnell Earley and Jerry Ambrose; and false pretenses and conspiracy to commit false pretenses charges against former Flint Utilities Administrator Daugherty Johnson and former Flint Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft. On November 28, 2017, Daugherty Johnson pleaded no contest to failing to furnish water documents to a Genesee County Health Department employee investigating a possible connection between Flint water and Legionnaires' disease outbreaks. Charges were dismissed in 2018 because of his cooperation with prosecutors. = 2017 = On June 14, 2017, Schuette announced new involuntary manslaughter charges‚Äî15-year felonies‚Äîagainst MDHHS Director Nick Lyon, former Flint emergency manager Darnell Earley, former Flint Department of Public Works director Howard Croft, former Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Office of Drinking Water chief Liane Shekter-Smith and MDEQ District Supervisor Stephen Busch. Also charged was Eden Wells, chief medical executive of MDHHS, who faces allegations of obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer. Lyon was also charged with a single count of misconduct in office after being accused of having received notice of the Legionnaires' outbreak at least a year before informing the public and the governor, while Wells is also accused of threatening to withhold funding to the Flint Area Community Health and Environment Partnership unless the partnership ceased its investigation into the source of the Legionnaires' outbreak. On October 9, 2017, Wells was charged with involuntary manslaughter and misconduct in office. On December 20, 2017, Adam Rosenthal pleaded no contest to a public records charge, a one-year misdemeanor, which was officially dismissed on September 27, 2018, following his cooperation in other prosecutions. = 2018 = On August 20, 2018, District Court Judge David Goggins found probable cause for a trial for two cases of involuntary manslaughter that were linked to Legionnaires Disease against Michigan's Health Director, Nick Lyon. On December 26, MDEQ employees Michael Prysby and Stephen Busch pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in exchange for their testimony against other defendants. =2019= On December 18, 2019, the cases against former MDEQ employees Steven Busch and Michael Prysby were dismissed by a Genesee County judge. =2020= On January 8, 2020, a Genesee County judge dismissed a misdemeanor charge of disturbance of a lawful meeting against Liane Shekter-Smith. On April 16, 2020, an article was published giving details of evidence of corruption and a coverup by Governor Snyder and Rich Baird, and stating that the statute of limitations on some of the most serious felony misconduct-in-office charges would expire on April 25, 2020. Responses from Michigan state authorities denied that a deadline was approaching, and said that criminal prosecutions would follow. Civil lawsuits As of February 21, 2019, a total of 79 civil lawsuits have been filed in regards to the crisis. = 2015 = On November 13, 2015, four families filed a federal class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Detroit against Governor Snyder and thirteen other city and state officials, including Mayor Walling and Darnell Earley, who was in charge of the city when the switch to the Flint River was made. The complaint alleges that the officials acted recklessly and negligently, leading to serious injuries from lead poisoning, including autoimmune disorders, skin lesions, and \\"brain fog.\\" The complaint alleges that the officials' conduct was \\"reckless and outrageous\\" and \\"shocks the conscience and was deliberately indifferent to ... constitutional rights.\\" The case was dismissed on February 3, 2017, with the judge stating his court has lack of subject-matter jurisdiction in the matter. Their attorneys filed an appeal on February 6. The legal doctrines of sovereign immunity (which protects the state from suit) and official immunity (which in Michigan shields top government officials from personal liability, even in cases of gross negligence) resulted in comparatively few lawsuits being filed in the Flint case, and caused large national plaintiffs' law firms to be reluctant to become involved with the case. = 2016 = On January 14, 2016, a separate class-action lawsuit against Snyder, the state of Michigan, the city of Flint, Earley, Walling, and Croft was filed by three Flint residents in Michigan Circuit Court in Genesee County. This suit targets lower-level officials who (under Michigan law) do not have immunity from claims arising from gross negligence. A separate suit was filed in January 2016 in the Michigan Court of Claims against the governor and state agencies; that suit alleges violations of the state constitution. In Michigan, the Court of Claims is the only court with subject-matter jurisdiction over claims against the state and its subdivisions. A federal lawsuit filed on January 27, 2016, seeks the replacement of all lead service lines in Flint at no cost to residents following claims city and state leaders violated federal laws designed to protect drinking water. It is also asking the court to force city and state officials to provide safe drinking water to Flint residents and require them to follow federal regulations for testing and treating water to control for lead. On February 2, 2016, a class action lawsuit in U.S. District Court was filed on behalf of Beatrice Boler, a Flint mother of two, Flint pastor Edwin Anderson with his wife, Alline Anderson, and a company, Epco Sales LLC. against Snyder, the MDEQ, two former state appointed emergency managers and Mayor Walling that seeks more than $150 million in refunds and compensation for damages for \\"water that was extraordinarily dangerous, undrinkable and unusable.\\" It was dismissed on April 19, 2016, after the judge ruled the allegations fall under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which prevents challenges to the law being ruled on in U.S. District Court and states they must be addressed by the EPA, and the case should be re-filed in the Michigan Court of Claims. Also on February 2, a lawsuit was filed in Michigan Circuit Court on behalf of four Genesee County residents who contracted Legionnaires' disease during the Flint water crisis, including one woman who died seven days after entering the emergency room with a headache. The suit names McLaren Regional Medical Center and several MDEQ officials as defendants. Lawyer Geoffrey Fieger represents the plaintiffs. On February 8, 2016 the parents of a two-year-old girl diagnosed with high blood lead levels filed a lawsuit in federal court, naming as defendants the city of Flint, the state of Michigan, Snyder, Earley, and Walling. The case was dismissed on February 7, 2017, with the judge citing his court has a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On March 3, 2016, a lawsuit was filed in state court by LeeAnne Walters, the Flint mother who informed the EPA water expert Miguel Del Toral of the health problems her family experienced after the water switch, against multiple corporate entities and three current and former government employees for their role in the city's water crisis. On March 7, 2016, another class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of seven residents alleging that tens of thousands of residents have suffered physical and economic injuries and damages. It argues officials failed to take action over \\"dangerous levels of lead\\" in drinking water and \\"downplayed the severity of the contamination.\\" On March 8, 2016, a federal class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of 500 county inmates against the Genesee County Sheriff's Department in regards to the water quality at the Genesee County Jail. The suit seeks only an injunction that will order the sheriff's department to continue to serve inmates only bottled water and dry food that doesn't require water to prepare. On March 24, the City of Flint filed a notice of intent sue in the Court of Claims against the State of Michigan, the MDEQ and four MDEQ employees for their mishandling of the crisis. A week later, Mayor Weaver said she has no intentions to proceed with a lawsuit, and the move is to \\"protect the future interest of the city.\\" On March 25, a federal lawsuit filed by the ACLU asked for an order requiring water to be delivered to homes of people without access to transportation or who are physically disabled. The case was settled a year later for $87 million (with an additional $10 million in reserve), which will be used to replaced 18,000 lead pipes by 2020. On April 6, 2016, a class action lawsuit brought by 15 Flint residents accused Governor Snyder and several state agencies and government officials of being in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in regards to the crisis. On May 18, 2016, the NAACP sued the state of Michigan and Governor Snyder, seeking compensation for property damages, pain and suffering damages, emotional distress damages and medical monitoring for Flint residents and businesses. On June 22, 2016, the Michigan Attorney General's Office filed a civil suit against engineering firms Veolia North America and Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam (LAN) who were hired to consult Flint water plant officials after the switch to the Flint River in April 2015. The lawsuit accuses Veolia and LAN of professional negligence and public nuisance. Veolia is also accused of fraud. Veolia called the accusations \\"baseless, entirely unfounded and [appearing] to be intended to distract from the troubling and disturbing realities that have emerged as a result of this tragedy,\\" and then added, \\"In fact, when Veolia raised potential lead and copper issues, city officials and representatives told us to exclude it from our scope of work because the city and the EPA were just beginning to conduct lead and copper testing.\\" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel amended the complaint on April 12, 2019, stating the companies \\"made multiple missteps by designing water treatment measures that made the water corrosive. Those failures ultimately resulted in bacterial problems in Flint's water, potentially dangerous disinfectant byproducts, the corrosion of the city's water distribution system, and high lead levels.\\" On May 28, 2019, Veolia denied responsibility for the crisis, instead blaming state and location officials for the crisis, and filed a motion for summary disposition on that date. In November 2019, a Genesee County judge dismissed four of the plaintiff's five charges against Veolia and LAN. On June 27, 2016, Flint residents Shari Guertin, on behalf of her minor child, and Diogenes Muse- Cleveland, filed a lawsuit accusing several officials of violating their \\"bodily integrity\\" by exposing them to lead-contaminated water and hiding it. The defendants are city and state officials including former Flint Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft, former emergency managers Darnell Earley and Gerald Ambrose and former DEQ officials Liane Shekter-Smith, Stephen Busch, Michael Prysby and Bradley Wurfel. Several charges in the case were dismissed by the original trial court on June 5, 2017. The charges were re-instated by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals on January 4, 2019. On November 15, 2016, Chief Judge Richard B. Yuille, Circuit Court of Genesee County, entered a Case Management Order, wherein he appointed attorney Corey Stern, of Levy Konigsberg, L.L.P., \\"Lead Counsel\\" for all plaintiffs maintaining claims in the Circuit Court of Genesee County for personal injuries and property damage sustained as a result of the Flint Water Crisis. Attorney Wayne B. Mason, of Drinker, Biddle & Reath, L.L.P., was appointed \\"Lead Counsel\\" for the Defendants. Judge Yuille called for a small number of lawsuits related to the Flint Water Crisis to serve as bellwethers, cases that will be fully developed and tried to verdict with the idea that they will help attorneys in other cases evaluate whether to settle or take their cases to trial. = 2017 = On January 30, 2017, a class action lawsuit with over 1,700 plaintiffs against the EPA seeking $722.4 million was filed, charging them with a violation of section 1431 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which states, \\"upon receipt of information that a contaminant that is present in or likely to enter a public water system or an underground source of drinking water, or there is a threatened or potential terrorist attack or other intentional act, that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, the EPA Administrator may take any action she deems necessary to protect human health\\". = 2020 = Two of the lawsuits had reached the Sixth Circuit Appeals Court; in both cases, the Court rejected the city officials' claims of immunity to allow the cases to continue. The Sixth Circuit asserted the citizens had a right to remedy since the officials' decision to switch water sources in 2014 harmed the citizens' Constitutional right to \\"bodily integrity\\". The officials had petitioned to the Supreme Court of the United States on the question of immunity, but in January 2020, the Supreme Court declined to hear either case, allowing both cases to proceed at the lower court. Infrastructure repairs and medical treatment =2016= On January 7, 2016, Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said that estimates of the cost of fixing water infrastructure in Flint, such as aging pipes, range from millions up to $1.5 billion. These figures encompass infrastructure alone, excluding any public health costs of the disaster. DEQ interim director Keith Creagh said that estimation of total costs would be premature. However, in a September 2015 email released by Snyder in January 2016, the state estimated the replacement cost to be $60 million, and said it could take up to 15 years to do. On January 18, 2016 the United Way of Genesee County estimated 6,000‚Äì12,000 children have been exposed to lead poisoning and kicked off a fundraising campaign to raise $100 million over a 10‚Äì15 year span for their medical treatment. On January 27, 2016 Mona Hanna-Attisha started a fundraiser for the $80,000 needed for the medical treatment of Flint children affected by lead poisoning. Meridian Health Plan of Detroit has agreed to donate up to $40,000 in matching funds to the Community Foundation of Greater Flint for long-term needs Hanna-Attisha expects to arise from the lead issue. At his annual State of the State address on January 19, Snyder apologized again, and asked the Michigan Legislature to give Flint an additional $28 million in funding for filters, replacement cartridges, bottled water, more school nurses and additional intervention specialists. It also will fund lab testing, corrosion control procedures, a study of water-system infrastructure, potentially help Flint deal with unpaid water bills, case management of people with elevated lead-blood levels, assessment of potential linkages to other diseases, crisis counseling and mental health services, and the replacement of plumbing fixtures in schools, child care centers, nursing homes and medical facilities. The Michigan House Appropriations Committee passed the bill the next day, while the Senate approved it on January 28. Snyder signed it the next day. On January 21, 2016 President Obama gave an $80 million loan to Michigan for infrastructure repairs, but the amount going to Flint is uncertain. On January 28, 2016 Democratic U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters and Representative Dan Kildee proposed an amendment to pending federal energy legislation to add the special appropriation of up to $400 million to replace and repair the lead service lines in Flint and $200 million more to create a center for lead research in Flint. They also said the state could choose to match up to $400 million for its share of infrastructure repairs in Flint. The newly amended bill was rejected by the Senate on February 4. A new $220 million bill to address the crisis was proposed in the U.S. Senate on February 24. At a news conference on February 9, 2016, Flint mayor Karen Weaver said that the city would remove and replace all of the city's 15,000 water service lines containing lead piping. Work was expected to begin in March 2016. The project will receive technical advice from the Lansing Board of Water and Light, which removed over 13,000 lead pipes in Lansing, Michigan. Lansing mayor Virg Bernero volunteered to provide the assistance. Weaver appointed Michael C.H. McDaniel, a retired National Guard brigadier general, to oversee the group leading the project, the Flint Action and Sustainability Team (FAST). The city government hopes to complete the project within a year, using 32 work crews, with priority given to the most at-risk households. The project is expected to cost $55 million, and the funding sources are not yet secured, but the city plans to seek it from local, state, and federal sources. The crews began working on March 4. On February 16, 2016 the state hired Flint-based engineering firm Rowe Professional Services to begin the process of locating, removing, and eventually replacing lead pipes in the highest risk areas of Flint. On February 18, 2016 the state gave Flint a $2 million grant that will go towards replacing lead service lines. On March 6, 2016 Union Labor Life Insurance Company donated $25 million for lead pipe replacements in the city. On July 18, 2016 city council approved a $500,000 contract with three companies for the second phase of lead pipe replacements: WT Stevens, and Johnson & Wood were awarded $320,000 contracts to do no more than 50 homes each. Goyette was awarded $619,500 to tackle replacing lead lines at 150 Flint homes. The city is using $25 million in funding approved by the Michigan legislature in June that was allocated for replacing Flint lead tainted pipes for Fast Start's third phase which will replace infrastructure at an estimated 5,000 homes in Flint. On October 10, 2016 city council approved contracts to replace pipes at 788 more homes before winter. The third phase will be funded using a portion of $25 million approved by the Michigan Legislature in June that was allocated for replacing Flint lead tainted pipes for Fast Start's third phase, which will replace infrastructure at an estimated 5,000 homes in Flint. Goyette will be paid $1,663,300.60 for replacements at 260 addresses in city wards two, six and eight. WT Stevens will be paid $2,306,384 for replacements at 488 addresses in city wards three, four, eight and nine. On October 17, 2016 the second phase of the program was completed on 218 homes. The project was completed by WT Stevens Construction Inc., Johnson & Wood Mechanical, and Goyette Mechanical. By November 22, 2016, the total number of homes with new pipes was 460. Flint's water service line records were largely unreliable, meaning the city could not say how many lead pipes existed, nor where they were. The City therefore started using a machine learning model to prioritize excavations starting in September 2016. Researchers from the University of Michigan developed this predictive model, using utility and parcel-level data to develop a more accurate service line inventory and calculate the probability that a given service is connected with a lead line. As pipes are dug up and more data is gained, the model updates accordingly and yields more accurate results. Using the model to prioritize excavations throughout 2016 and 2017 yielded a hit rate of about 80%. A University of Michigan study, conducted by the same researchers responsible for developing the machine learning model, was released on December 1, 2016, stating a total of 29,100 pipes, from all parcels regardless of occupancy, were estimated to be lead. This was based on a representative sample taken of the city's water service lines (approximately 200 homes) using Hydrovac method, which revealed the problem was more extensive than the city anticipated. After the report, the city's estimates of lead/galvanized jumped from 10-20% to about 50%. =2017= On January 19, 2017, an engineer at the Flint Water Plant said the facility is in need of $60 million worth of upgrades, which wouldn't be finished until well into 2019. On February 7, 2017, another report said the cost would be $108 million. On February 6, 2017, the Genesee Intermediate School District received $6.5 million for the Early On Genesee program to provide free evaluations to as many as 5,000 children up to 5 years old facing possible lead-related developmental delays from the state of Michigan. On March 17, 2017, Flint received a $100 million grant from the EPA for water infrastructure repairs. On June 30, 2017, the Genesee County Health Department's Healthy Start Program received $15 million to provide health and social services for people who have had or are at risk for lead exposure stemming from Flint water crisis. =2018= In January 2018, the city contracted a private consulting firm, AECOM, to take over water service line excavations and consequently stopped using the machine learning model. During 2018, 10,531 excavations were performed, yielding a hit rate of only 15%. On March 26, 2018, a U.S. federal court mandate requires the city to return to using the machine learning model to prioritize excavations. As a result, the hit rate has steadily increased since early 2019 and is now close to 70%. Long term effects of lead poisoning Childhood lead exposure causes a reduction in intellectual functioning and IQ, academic performance, and problem-solving skills, and an increased risk of attention deficit disorder, aggression, and hyperactivity. According to studies, children with elevated levels of lead in the blood are more likely as adults to commit crimes, be imprisoned, be unemployed or underemployed, or be dependent on government services. While changes in IQ may appear small from the elevated blood levels, it has been estimated that each increase in an IQ point raises worker's productivity by 1.76‚Äì2.38%, and that the economic benefit for each year of 3.8 million 2-year-old children could be from $110 to $319 billion. In addition, early-life exposure to lead may increase risk of later-life neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, and this risk is likely to persist into late life long after lead has been removed from the body. A 2014 study by researchers at Risk Science Center at the University of Michigan, completed before the Flint water crisis came to light, estimated the annual cost of childhood lead exposure in Michigan at $330 million ($205 million in decreases in lifetime earnings, $105 million in additional criminal justice system expenditures, $18 million in health expenditures to diagnose lead positioning and lead-linked attention deficit disorder), and $2.5 million in additional special education expenditures. Because the developmental effects of lead exposure appear over a series of years, the total long-term cost of the Flint water crisis \\"will not be apparent in the short term.\\" However, the cost is expected to be high. Philippe Grandjean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, an expert in the effects of environmental pollution on brain development, said that \\"when calculated from the loss of lifetime income, the societal costs from lead exposure (across the United States) reach billion-dollar amounts.\\" Political responses =Federal government= President Barack Obama sips filtered Flint water following a roundtable on the crisis at Northwestern High School on May 4, 2016. Dan Kildee, the Democratic party congressman in the House of Representatives representing the Michigan 5th district which includes Flint, along with Republican Michigan Representative Fred Upton, sponsored H.R. 4470, the Safe Drinking Water Act Improved Compliance Awareness Act, which would ensure that the public promptly learns of excessive lead levels in their drinking water by setting forth how and when states, EPA, and public utilities communicate their findings. It has passed the House, but has yet to be passed by the Senate. Among the Michigan congressional delegation, only Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Cascade Township, opposed federal aid for Flint. Amash opined that \\"the U.S. Constitution does not authorize the federal government to intervene in an intrastate matter like this one.\\" In December 2016, President Barack Obama signed Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016 (co-sponsored by Debbie Stabenow in the Senate) which earmarked $170 million to address the Flint water crisis. The first $100 million was released in March 2017, by the US Environmental Protection Agency after President Trump had taken office. President Donald Trump's plan to fix the crisis in Michigan has been folded into his federal infrastructure plan. Trump's infrastructure plan proposes $1 trillion in spending on new infrastructure by offering corporations who invest in infrastructure projects tax credits, with the corporations investing approximately $167 billion. This plan would require a return of 9‚Äì10% to investors to remain feasible. This plan has no direct reference to or specific proposal for the crisis in Flint and as of his election he has not proposed a direct federal intervention. Dan Kildee, the Democratic party congressman in the House of Representatives representing the Michigan 5th district which includes Flint, re-introduced on July 10, 2019 a bill in the House, originally introduced in 2017, as HR 3677, the National Opportunity for Lead Exposure Accountability and Deterrence Act (NO LEAD) of 2017. Tammy Duckworth, Democratic Senator for Illinois, announced on the same day, July 10, 2019, the introduction of a bill in the Senate as S. 2086, the National Opportunity for Lead Exposure Accountability and Deterrence (NO LEAD) of 2019. The nearly-identical bills aim to help ensure drinking water across the USA is safe from lead and copper contamination, and would update the Lead and Copper Rule, lowering the lead action level from 15 parts per billion (ppb) currently, to 10 ppb by 2020 and 5 ppb by 2026. The bill would also create a lead-service-line inventory to help monitor contaminated service lines and ensure the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) develops a universal testing protocol to make sure the entire lead service line is replaced if water contamination is detected, as partial replacement does not eliminate the risk of contamination. =State legislature= On January 4, 2016, citing the Flint water crisis, Michigan Representative Phil Phelps, Democrat of Flushing, announced plans to introduce a bill to the Michigan House of Representatives that would make it a felony for state officials to intentionally manipulate or falsify information in official reports, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. On March 2, House Democratic leader Tim Greimel called on Governor Snyder to resign, due to his \\"negligence and indifference\\" in his handling of the Flint water crisis. Also on that date, State Democratic Party Chairman Brandon Dillon called for Michigan Treasurer Nick Khouri to resign due to his role in a loan agreement from April 2015 that blocked Flint from switching back to the Detroit system. =2016 presidential election= Donald Trump On January 19, 2016, then-Republican-candidate Donald Trump said, \\"It's a shame what's happening in Flint, Michigan. A thing like that shouldn't happen.\\" After clinching the Republican nomination, Trump visited Flint on September 14, 2016 and toured the water plant and a Flint church, where he promised to fix the water crisis, and in a brief speech there, he blamed NAFTA for General Motors' abandonment of Flint and the area's subsequent ongoing recession caused by it, saying, \\"It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint. That's terrible.\\" Hillary Clinton Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton repeatedly mentioned the crisis during her campaign, saying: \\"The people of Flint deserve to know the truth about how this happened and what Governor Snyder and other leaders knew about it. And they deserve a solution, fast. Thousands of children may have been exposed to lead, which could irreversibly harm their health and brain functioning. Plus, this catastrophe‚Äîwhich was caused by a zeal to save money at all costs‚Äîcould actually cost $1.5 billion in infrastructure repairs.\\" In a subsequent interview, Clinton referred to her work on lead abatement in housing in upstate New York while a U.S. Senator and called for further funding for healthcare and education for children who will suffer the negative effects of lead exposure on behavior and educational attainment. The crisis was also the catalyst for a town hall style debate in Flint between Clinton and Democratic rival Bernie Sanders on March 6, 2016, two days before the Michigan Presidential primary election. It was hosted by CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon. Both candidates called for Governor Snyder to resign during the event. = 2020 presidential election =  Donald Trump  On January 16, 2020, Trump re-tweeted a story by conservative website The Daily Caller which claims that $390 million of state funds allocated to Flint in 2019 for the crisis recovery were improperly used, adding, \\"This is a total disgrace, but just another reason that I‚Äôm going to win Michigan again!\\". The article's accusations have been denied by the state's budget director.Trump criticizes Flint‚Äôs use of water crisis emergency funds MLive.com, January 17, 2020  Joe Biden  In early September 2020, Republican former Governor Rick Snyder endorsed Democratic candidate Joe Biden for president. Liberal Flint-born filmmaker and activist Michael Moore, angry about the endorsement, devoted a podcast episode to this issue. Other responses =Lead poisoning and aging infrastructure problems in other cities= An investigative report by Reuters released December 19, 2016 found nearly 3,000 areas in the United States with lead contamination rates at least double those in Flint. The Trump Administration blocked publishing a federal health study on the nationwide water-contamination crisis. The water disaster called attention to the problem of aging and seriously neglected water infrastructure nationwide. The Flint crisis recalled recent lead contamination crises in the tap water in various cities, such as the lead contamination in Washington, D.C. drinking water (2001), Columbia, South Carolina (2005); Durham and Greenville, North Carolina (2006); Jackson, Mississippi (2015); and Sebring, Ohio (2015). The New York Times notes, \\"Although Congress banned lead water pipes 30 years ago, between 3.3 million and 10 million older ones remain, primed to leach lead into tap water by forces as simple as jostling during repairs or a change in water chemistry.\\" Inadequate regulation was cited as one reason for unsafe lead levels in tap water and \\"efforts to address shortcomings often encounter push- back from industries like agriculture and mining that fear cost increases, and from politicians ideologically opposed to regulation.\\" The crisis called attention to a \\"resource gap\\" for water regulators. The annual budget of the EPA's drinking water office declined 15% from 2006 to 2015, with the office losing over 10% of employees, and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators reported in 2013 that \\"federal officials had slashed drinking- water grants, 17 states had cut drinking-water budgets by more than a fifth, and 27 had cut spending on full-time employees,\\" with \\"serious implications for states' ability to protect public health.\\" In the aftermath of the water crisis, it was noted that elevated blood-lead levels in children are found in many cities across Michigan, including Detroit, Grand Rapids, Muskegon, and Adrian. Although statewide childhood lead-poisoning rates have dramatically declined since the removal of lead from gasoline, certain areas of the state (particularly low-income areas with older housing stock) continue to experience lead poisoning, mostly from lead paint in homes built before 1978 and lead residue in dust and soil. Lead abatement efforts are slow. = Reforming the Lead and Copper Rule = The water crisis in Flint, Michigan has made it apparent that reform needs to be made nationwide to improve water infrastructure. Michigan, as the center of the water crisis, has since strengthened its Lead and Copper Rule, making it the strongest advocate against lead contaminated water in the country. The new Lead and Copper Rule in Michigan requires that all lead contaminated pipes be replaced within the next twenty years. In 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency suggested the first change to the Lead and Copper Rule in almost three decades to set more strict protocols for when lead is identified in water. After the crisis in Flint, Michigan, Trump‚Äôs administration created a new set of regulations that would allow states to react more effectively and in a faster manner in the event of a public health crisis. These changes, proposed in amendments to the Lead and Copper Rule, still allow lead water lines to service communities, which has drawn a lot of criticisms from the public. This new proposal highlighted four changes in the Lead and Copper Rule, a rule that previously has not been revised in years. The proposed revisions consist of: * Requiring water systems to create a database of where the lead pipes are located, and when the water running through the pipes reaches lead levels greater than 15 parts per billion, the problem must be investigated and fixed. * Create an alert when water samples reach 10 parts per billion so that communities can determine how to lower the lead levels in the water before it reaches 15 parts per billion. * Require water systems to alert customers within a one-day period if their water sample tests higher than 15 parts per million. * Require water systems to replace water service lines to a home if they are contaminated with lead, and if the homeowner chooses to replace the piping. Every year thereafter, the water system must replace three percent of the lead contaminated water system. However, critics are calling for the replacement of all lead service lines in communities; a project that would cost billions of dollars, which was not a part of the proposed amendments to the Lead and Copper Rule. The problem with the current Lead and Copper Rule is that it allows states to test their own water systems. This can cause problems because the water systems in individual homes affect the quality of the water there. Therefore, water pipes could be contaminated and never get tested, or the test results are never reported. Since the crisis in Flint, the Environmental Protection Agency has called for more aggressive replacement of contaminated pipes, as well as improved education so people know to test their water. The crisis in Flint spurred the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) to test water systems across the nation for possible contaminants. The study showed that every state in the country had areas which tested positive for matter that could be harmful to human health. This highlights the sheer number of violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act, of which the Lead and Copper Rule is a part of. These violations could be positive results of contaminated water, failing to test water and water systems, and the failure to report contaminated water systems to the proper authorities. =Accusations of environmental racism= 2017 Climate March protester holds up an anti-Rick Snyder sign on the Flint water crisis Civil rights advocates characterized the crisis as a result of environmental racism (Flint's population is 56.6% African American per the 2010 census), a term primarily referring to the disproportionate exposure of ethnic minorities to pollution as a result of \\"poverty and segregation that has relegated many blacks and other racial minorities to some of the most industrialized or dilapidated environments.\\" Columnist Shaun King, for example, wrote that the crisis was \\"a horrific clash of race, class, politics and public health.\\" Flint residents themselves have identified racism as a contributing factor to the crisis. In a qualitative study done by The Center for Research on Ethnicity, Culture and Health (CRECH) at the University of Michigan, researchers investigated Flint youth's perceptions of the Flint Water Crisis. The young Flint residents, with 93% identifying as black, were asked questions regarding the socioeconomic factors that attributed to the crisis. In these interviews, themes of race, genocide, and oppression became apparent as youth expressed opinions on how their \\"poor Black city\\" was stigmatized and deprioritized by those in power. Researchers noted that these results can help academics study the racialized mental trauma and stress among youth who experienced the Flint water crisis. The Michigan Civil Rights Commission later reiterated this belief in a 138-page report titled \\"The Flint Water Crisis: Systemic Racism Through the Lens of Flint\\". Its writers said of it, \\"Policy makers, government leaders, and decision makers at many levels failed the residents of Flint,\\" said Agustin Arbulu, Director of the Michigan Department of Civil Rights. \\"By not challenging their assumptions, by not asking themselves the tough questions about how policy and decisions play out in different communities, especially communities primarily made up of people of color, those decisions and actions ‚Äì or in some cases, lack of action ‚Äì led to the tragedy taking place in Flint.\\" \\"We strongly believe that the actions that led to the poisoning of Flint's water and the slow response resulted in the abridgement of civil rights for the people of Flint,\\" said Arthur Horwitz, co-chair of the Commission during the time of the investigation. \\"We are not suggesting that those making decisions related to this crisis were racists, or meant to treat Flint any differently because it is a community of color. Rather, the response is the result of implicit bias and the history of systemic racism that was built into the foundation of Flint. The lessons of Flint are profound. While the exact situation and response that happened in Flint may never happen anywhere else, the factors that led to this crisis remain in place and will most certainly lead to other tragedies if we don't take steps to remedy them. We hope this report is a step in that direction.\\" The Governor's office responded: \\"Some findings of the report and the recommendations are similar to those of the (Flint Water Advisory Task Force and) the legislative panel and the Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee,\\" said Gov. Rick Snyder spokeswoman Anna Heaton. \\"The Governor takes the reporting of each of these panels very seriously, and appreciates the public input that was shared.\\" The findings were no surprise for State Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich. \\"The presence of racial bias in the Flint water crisis isn't much of a surprise to those of us who live here, but the Michigan Civil Rights Commission's affirmation that the emergency manager law disproportionately hurts communities of color is an important reminder of just how bad the policy is. Now is the time to address this flawed law,\\" Ananich said. He went on to say, \\"The people of Flint deserve the same level of safety, opportunity and justice that any other city in Michigan enjoys\\". =Media responses= On October 8, 2015, the editorial board of the Detroit Free Press wrote that the crisis was \\"an obscene failure of government\\" and criticized Snyder. On December 31, 2015, the editorial board of the MLive group of Michigan newspapers called upon Snyder to \\"drop executive privilege and release all of his communications on Flint water,\\" establish a procedure for compensating families with children suffering from elevated lead blood levels, and return Flint to local control. Some of the most important reporting on the crisis was conducted by investigative reporter Curt Guyette, who works not for a news organization but for the American Civil Liberties Union's Michigan Democracy Watch Project. The work of Guyette and the ACLU was credited with bringing the water contamination to public light. MSNBC host Rachel Maddow has extensively reported on the water crisis on her show since December 2015, keeping it in the national spotlight. She has condemned Snyder's use of emergency managers (which she termed a \\"very, very radical\\" change \\"to the way we govern ourselves as Americans, something that nobody else has done\\") and said, \\"The kids of Flint, Michigan have been poisoned by a policy decision.\\" Maddow visited Flint and hosted a town hall with government officials and other involved experts on her show on January 27. On October 5, 2017, Maddow won an Emmy Award for the special. In February 2018, \\"Jordan Chariton Reports\\", the YouTube channel and reporting website, released an investigative piece on TruthDig showing that the science and data used to declare the water safe in Flint, Michigan was suspect. This report was later featured on the Thom Hartmann Program.. On April 23, 2019 Status Coup, an independent investigative reporting network co-founded by Jordan Chariton and Jenn Dize, released the documentary Flushing Flint which claimed that the water testing by Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) was falsified by MDEQ staff taking water samples after flushing running water from taps for several minutes before taking the samples, contrary to normal procedures for water testing, and by MDEQ staff telling residents that they should take water samples after flushing running water from their taps for several minutes. This would clearly contravene the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance that samples taken must be \\"first-draw samples at taps in homes/buildings\\". On April 16, 2020, an article was published giving details of evidence of corruption and a cover-up by former Governor Rick Snyder and his \\"fixer\\" Rich Baird, and stating that the statute of limitations on some of the most serious felony misconduct-in-office charges would expire on April 25, 2020. The article was published by Vice News, written by Jordan Chariton and Jenn Dize, the co-founders of Status Coup, with photos by Brittany Greeson. Responses from Michigan state authorities denied that a deadline was approaching, and said that criminal prosecutions would follow. =Groups= In January 2016, a coalition of local and national groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), filed suit seeking federal court intervention to secure access to safe drinking water for the people of Flint, Michigan. In November 2016, a federal judge ordered the implementation of door-to-door delivery of bottled water to every home without a properly installed and maintained faucet filter. In March 2018, a settlement was reached that required the City to replace thousands of lead service lines and return to using the predictive model. In June 2019, the University of Michigan researchers responsible for developing the model, Jake Abernethy and Eric Schwartz, founded BlueConduit, a company aimed at leveraging data science and machine learning to find and remove lead pipes in other municipalities. Retired Brigadier General Michael C.H. McDaniel, who was appointed by Flint Mayor Karen Weaver to serve as program manager for the lead service line replacement programs in Flint, joined BlueConduit as Director of Government and Customer Services. The watchdog group Common Cause called upon Snyder to release all documents related to the Flint water crisis. The governor's office is not subject to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. The hacktivist group Anonymous released a YouTube video calling for the arrest of Snyder. =Prominent figures= Michael Moore, a Genesee County native and director- producer of several movies related to Flint, called for Snyder's arrest for mishandling the water crisis in an open letter to the governor, writing, \\"The facts are all there, Mr. Snyder. Every agency involved in this scheme reported directly to you. The children of Flint didn't have a choice as to whether or not they were going to get to drink clean water.\\" A spokesman for the governor called Moore's call \\"inflammatory\\". Later, after hearing of the Legionnaires' outbreak, Moore termed the state's actions \\"murder\\". Speaking to reporters in Flint, he emphasized that \\"this was not a mistake ... Ten people have been killed here because of a political decision. They did this. They knew.\\" Moore also criticized Barack Obama's trip to Flint, where he drank water, \\"disappointing.\\" In a post on her Facebook page, environmental activist Erin Brockovich called the water crisis a \\"growing national concern\\" and said that the crisis was \\"likely\\" connected to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak. Brockovich called for the U.S. Environment Protection Agency to become involved in the investigation, saying that the EPA's \\"continued silence has proven deadly.\\" On January 16, 2016, the Reverend Jesse Jackson met with Mayor Weaver in Flint and said of the crisis, \\"The issue of water and air and housing and education and violence are all combined. The problem here obviously is more than just lack of drinkable water. We know the problems here and they will be addressed.\\" Jackson called Flint \\"a disaster zone\\" and a \\"crime scene\\" during a rally at a Flint church the next day. Jackson, in conjunction with the group Concerned Pastors for Social Action, held a major national march in Flint on February 19 to address the water issue, as well as inner city violence and urban reconstruction. On January 18, Nontombi Naomi Tutu, daughter of Desmond Tutu, said in a speech at the University of Michigan‚ÄìFlint, \\"We actually needed the people of Flint to remind the people of this country what happens when political expediency, when financial concerns, overshadow justice and humanity.\\" On January 24, actor and clean drinking water advocate Matt Damon called for Snyder's resignation. On March 7, actor Mark Ruffalo, head of the group Water Defense, visited Flint and called for more federal aid in the emergency and Snyder's resignation while saying, \\"It's an absolute outrage, it's a moral indecency.\\" Water Defense conducted studies on Flint water in the spring of 2016, claiming it is still unsafe for bathing or showering. Their findings were disputed by Virginia Tech water expert Marc Edwards on May 31, 2016. In the third episode of the Adult Swim comedy series Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace, Charles Carroll (member of the group of YouTube comedians \\"Million Dollar Extreme\\") delivers a monologue where he describes how viewers can recreate the contaminated water in Flint. In his monologue, the right wing-leaning Carroll discusses the concept of tyrannicide with costars Sam Hyde and Andrew Ruse and claims that the situation in Flint is a situation where the violent murder of Republican leadership in the state of Michigan would be justified. On April 28, 2018, Michelle Wolf was the featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. Wolf's last line in her speech was \\"Flint still doesn't have clean water\\", referring to the by then long-running man-made water crisis in the city of Flint, Michigan. =Education and research= University of Michigan-Flint During its winter 2016 semester, the University of Michigan‚ÄìFlint offered a one-credit, eight-session series of public forums dedicated to educating Flint residents and students on the crisis. University of Michigan-Ann Arbor The University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) committed to spending $100,000 to research the crisis and possible ways to address it. Wayne State University study Wayne State University in Detroit is leading a separate study with five other schools focusing on the Legionnaires' outbreak called the Flint Area Community Health and Environment Partnership. On October 9, 2017 they released their preliminary analysis, which showed approximately 10 percent of all homes on the Flint municipal water system had chlorine levels less than 0.2 mg/L when measured at the kitchen faucet (bypassing filters when present) after five minutes of flushing. West Virginia University/University of Kansas study On August 7, 2017, West Virginia University published a study validating the correlation between the intake of lead contaminated water and the increase of fetal deaths along with miscarriages during November 2013 to March 2015. The study was led jointly by Daniel Grossman of West Virginia University and David Slusky of the University of Kansas. The data was constructed over the course of two years focusing on the city of Flint and how the data differs among neighboring cites in Michigan. Data shows that after the city switched the water source to the Flint River, fetal deaths rose 58% among women aged 15‚Äì49 compared to control areas. William Paterson University/University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Study On November 6, 2017 a retrospective cohort study was published in the Journal of Public Health Policy regarding birth weight outcomes in Flint in the early stages of the water crisis.The study was completed using birth data from 2005 to 2015 to assess the birth weights of infants born before and after the Flint, Michigan, water supply was changed. Low birth weight was defined as a birth weight less than 2,500 grams. Beginning with January 2014 conception dates, the Flint, Michigan, population saw the incidence of low birth weight infants increase from 13.3% to 15.7%. Further analysis, using other counties as controls with similar demographics during the same time period, were then assessed in order to prove these lower birth weights did not happen by chance. Overall, birth weight in Flint was found to be 48.9 grams less than the control group with a statistically significant 1.53% increase in incidences of low birth weight. The study also analyzed the effects of race in regards to changes in birth weights. White mothers saw a 71-gram reduction in birth weight, resulting in a 2.73% increase in low birth weight infants. There were not any statistically meaningful differences among African American infants. There were likely not enough control counties to properly assess African American birth weights separately. The main limitation of the study was that infants of Flint were compared to infants of other counties. Also, the birth weights after the climax of the crisis were not assessed to see if they bounced back to pre- crisis weights. Increased lead consumption and stress were hypothesized to be reasons behind the increase in low birth weights, but there were likely many additional confounding factors. Wayne State University, Department of Communication Study In a study published in the journal Communication Studies, researchers conducted a survey on the crisis communications methods used during the Flint water contamination by looking at media use between different racial groups. The results were accordant with past research, where racial minorities generally utilized more interpersonal and social connections as informational resources in comparison to their white counterparts. Additionally, the study found that \\"In almost every category pertaining to health effects and other topics related to the Flint water crisis, African American respondents wanted additional information at higher levels than White respondents.\\" Lastly, researchers found that Instagram was widely used by African-American residents to receive crisis information. The results from this study can further inform government agencies on how to effectively communicate with African-American communities, and use new social media platforms like Instagram to disperse important crisis information. =Other possible causes and responses= The crisis highlighted a lack of transparency in Michigan government; the state is one of just two states that exempts the governor's office from state freedom-of-information legislation. A number of commentators framed the crisis in terms of human rights, writing that authorities' handling of the issue denied residents their right to clean water. Some have framed it as the end result of austerity measures and given priority over human life. Jacob Lederman, for example, contends that Flint's poisoned water supply, in addition to high crime rates, devastated schools and crumbling infrastructure, can be attributed to neoliberal economic reforms. Robby Soave, writing in Reason magazine, said that administrative bloat in public-sector trade unions was to blame for the crisis: \\"Let's not forget the reason why local authorities felt the need to find a cheaper water source: Flint is broke and its desperately poor citizens can't afford higher taxes to pay the pensions of city government retirees. As recently as 2011, it would have cost every person in Flint $10,000 each to cover the unfunded legacy costs of the city's public employees.\\" \\"Flint was a government-made disaster from top to bottom. Private companies didn't run the system or profit from it,\\" Shikha Dalmia wrote in Reason magazine. The crisis brought the National Water Infrastructure Conference to Flint in early March 2017. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and Flint Mayor Karen Weaver spoke on the first day. Marc Edwards spoke there two days later. On April 20, 2017 Stephen Estes- Smargiassi, director of planning and sustainability at the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, told a forum on lead water contamination at the Harvard School of Public Health that a chain-reaction of failures, including those by the financial managers, allowed the water crisis to develop as long as it did. He stated \\"What happened in Flint? Well, a firestorm of things that went wrong. (Flint) changed (its) source water, didn't do a good job on corrosion control in their treatment\\", and added \\"They had, about half of the homes had lead service lines. Money was more important to the emergency manager than people were. That's pretty clear from the evidence,\\" and later went on to say, \\"State regulators could have picked up on this, but fell down on the job, maybe worse than that. We'll see what happens to those who were indicted. And the federal regulators could have picked up the problem, but didn't until quite late. All of those things, that firestorm of events, resulted in really awful water quality.\\" Prevention Failed infrastructure and economic decline resulted in the toxic levels of lead in the city's water supply. A corrosive water source was introduced \\"into an aging water system without adequate corrosion control.\\" Per Larry Clark, Sustainable Performance Solutions LLC, consulting professionals such as \\"professional engineers, licensed plumbers, or water-treatment specialists\\" could have had a positive impact on the outcome. In addition to professional consultation, EPA reform would help prevent another Flint water crisis. Current water-testing techniques can underestimate water lead levels because sampling is sometimes concentrated on neighborhoods with known low lead levels or lead-free pipes. EPA reform could enforce rules that \\"ensure that all cities get an early warning when lead levels rise to the danger point.\\", said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). Upholding the Clean Water Act passed in 1972 would have prevented an outbreak of lead poisoning in Flint. This act \\"established the basic structure for regulating pollutant discharges into the waters of the United States\\". The EPA has also updated its standards and created six goals for improving the drinking water of the nation. This plan was created in November 2016 to decrease the amount of pollution in water. Using point-of-use (POU) devices could prevent lead exposure. A study at the University of Arizona, Tucson used the Flint, Michigan water crisis to illustrate the economic benefits of utilizing three specific POU devices, which included reverse osmosis, activated carbon, and distillation. Many factors such as \\"POU device costs, lead absorption from water, and economic losses associated with reduced IQ\\" were taken into account to determine the cost-benefit of each device. The study found that the water lead level breakeven points for reverse osmosis, activated carbon, and distillation were 7.31 ¬µg/L, 3.73 ¬µg/L, and 12.0 ¬µg/L, respectively. The cost-benefit was analyzed as a 70-year (lifetime) duration, which is much longer than the Flint water crisis, but these POU devices could still serve to be a valuable tool in preventing the consumption of water- soluble lead in the future. Using predictive models could be another invaluable way to help prevent another crisis like the one in Flint. Many municipalities across the country have outdated or incomplete records on their water service line materials, and governments have finite resources to identify and fix the problem of lead lines. In Flint, it is clear that a data- driven approach allowed public money to be spent more efficiently in ways that directly align with public health protection. Because the public (utility- owned) portion of service lines is buried under roads and sidewalks, it is expensive to verify pipe materials. Depending on the verification method, it can range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars per home. Flint spent more than $20 million on unnecessary excavations when it ignored model predictions in 2018, instead of targeting homes with the highest likelihood of having a lead service line. This could have been largely avoided with the continued use of the machine learning model developed in 2016. Indirect mental health impact As the water crisis unfolded, residents experienced considerable anxiety over the physical and mental health impacts of lead poisoning on both adults and children, stress, and anger and political leaders. Some adults felt guilty about giving children contaminated water, and in some cases family members stopped visiting. Some residents related the water crisis to depression and even thoughts of suicide; some sought treatment for mental breakdowns. The state government gave a $500,000 grant to the Genesee Health System for free counseling in addition to sending state mobile crisis teams and expanding Medicaid programs for affected residents. Volunteer social workers arrived from across the state, and the United States Public Health Service offered training. A study from the University of Michigan provided evidence that demonstrated an association between the Flint water crisis and sleep conditions. Surveys were offered at every opportunity, including by mail, email, social media, and in-person events to as many Flint, Michigan residents as possible. 834 respondents from September 30, 2015 to September 28, 2016 were included in the analysis. In the survey, respondents had to rate the quality of their tap water (taste, smell, appearance), rate the quality of their sleep, list the duration of sleep in a typical night, and fill out basic demographics. The study found that a lower perceived quality of tap water was associated with lower sleep quality and a shorter duration of sleep. Donations of water and money As of September 8, 2017, the Ruth Mott Foundation and the Community Foundation of Greater Flint had directed a combined $33,480,494 to various programs to aid both children and adults affected by Flint's water crisis. This total reflects donations from many celebrities, groups and organizations. The money has gone to fund not only immediate aid for the Flint crisis (such as bottled water distribution), but also to build community organizations and infrastructure in Flint; however, it has not gone to repairing the Flint water system, which remains the responsibility of local and state governments. The Ruth Mott foundation says much of their work is going towards helping Flint's children, in the form of programs for health, nutrition, and education. =Celebrity and corporate donations= The Flint water crisis has attracted a substantial amount of philanthropic support from a wide variety of individuals and organizations, with donations often focused on bottled water or money.

The company was established in 1877 by engineer Birdsill Holly when he formed a central steam heating system to heat multiple surrounding buildings in an immediate city area. The company was reorganized in 1882 to become the American District Steam Company (ADSC). It did research and development on central station heating systems and franchised municipal steam heat districts to cities. ADSC developed into the largest and most important company in the United States for the distribution and sale of heat and power from steam.  History  Holly Company, circa 1880 District heating (\\"animated\\" demo) Birdsill Holly, mechanical engineer and inventor of water hydraulics devices, began working on a district steam system using a central boiler system in 1876 in Lockport, New York. He was well known as an inventor and used his reputation to try to attract investors to develop out a steam heating technology, but failed. He was confident in his concepts of this, so used his own money to experiment with. He began by constructing a underground line of half inch (1.3 cm) insulated wooden piping across his property. The pipe was laid from his barn below the ground to his farmhouse. He used a boiler to heat up water to produce steam. The steam from the boiler was pumped through the pipes and collected at a mechanical distributor device in the attic of his house. From there the steam went to various heating coils. The used steam then was sent back to the boiler by return piping and reheated to be used again. Holly then connected an adjoining house making his first \\"district\\" consisting of a barn and a neighbor's house after successfully achieving the transfer of heat at his own property using steam distribution. The following year he constructed an experimental central steam heating plant in Lockport. The system of of supply and return pipes were on Locust, Genesee, and Walnut Streets. They sent heat to several surrounding homes, stores and office buildings. This heating system had a method of using energy efficiently and was better than individual boilers then in use to heat a building. This new technology attracted the attention of certain investors that were willing to take the risk of developing it. Holly, with these investors, then formed the Holly Steam Combination Company in 1877 with a capital stock of $25,000. It was the first central station for district heating using steam. The company bought out the patents that Holly had on this steam heating system. The company then established franchises for heating plants in cities and towns across the United States. The marketing plan was for a sales representative of the company to visit a certain town or city and to present the system to town merchants and bankers. If they wanted the system, a city municipal subsidiary would then be formed and bonds sold to the residents. From the money generated, steam generating boilers and pipe-line systems would be installed to heat the downtown buildings. The Holly heating systems first used wood insulated pipe and the steam was distributed using high duty pumping engines. Holly continued to improve on the system and had 50 patents by 1882. By 1888 he obtained over 150 patents refining steam heat techniques and methods of distribution. In the 1880s Holly had installed some three dozen city district steam systems in the United States and Canada. Some of these cities were Chicago, Brooklyn, New York, Buffalo, St. Louis, Cleveland, Detroit, Toronto and Montreal. He also installed his heating systems in factories, orphanages, asylums, and universities. The first electric company to become interested in his system was the Brush Swan Electric Light Company of Auburn, New York, which in 1885 put one in operation. By 1894 the Holly steam systems had been installed in more than 2000 towns and cities throughout the United States and Canada. thumbAmerican District Steam Company general offices and works in 1911 North Tonawanda, New York  Demise  The Holly Steam Combination Company was reorganized in 1882 and became the American District Steam Company (ADSC). This new company bought out the patent rights of the Holly Company and Holly's additional inventions he had recently made in the previous five years. The company, besides franchising municipal steam heat districts, did research and development on central station heating systems. New York City obtained a franchise contract from ADSC for the New York Steam Company, which developed into the largest and most important company in the United States for the distribution and sale of heat and power from steam.

With around of alpine ski runs and of cross country runs, it is the largest ski resort in Serbia. Among other features, it has night skiing run and artificial snow system covering most of the resort. Kopaonik has mild winters with high levels of snowfall, and on average about 200 sunny days annually with 160 days covered with snow. Kopanik ski resort is being considered as one of the best ski resorts in Eastern Europe, with outstanding beginner and lower-intermediate terrain for skiers. Festivals There is an annual music festival \\"Big Snow\\" held from 23 to 29 March in the area of ski resort. The festival gathers international reggae, jazz and electronic music performers. The ski resort has a \\"Snow Park\\" for extreme skiers and snowboarders. The park has expanses of grassland, forests composed of a variety of tree species, beauty spots, and river gorges. The snow blanket lasts a long time on this mountain and there are favorable conditions for the expansion of winter tourism there. Transportation Kopaonik ski resort is well-connected with the main transport routes in Serbia. It is linked with the Ibar highway, It is located (two-hour drive) from the international airport Ni≈° Constantine the Great Airport and (four-hour drive) from the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. The recently open Morava Airport near Kraljevo is much closer to this ski resort (102 km, 63 mi, approximately, hour-and-half-drive by Ibar highway). However, it is only in its early development phase, although it is expected that this aerodrome will serve as the main hub for Kopaonik in the future.Infokop: \\"Avionom preko 'Morave' do Kopaonika\\" Also, a public heliport is located in a military base north of the resort.

In 1803, Yashwant Rao Holkar invaded Pune and deposed his adoptive brother Peshwa Baji Rao II. Subsequently, Holkar set up an ad-hoc council nominally headed by Amrut Rao, and ran the Peshwa's government in his name. Holkar also installed Amrut Rao's son Vinayak Rao as the Peshwa to strengthen the legal status of his government, because Vinayak had been adopted by the widow of the deceased Peshwa Madhav Rao II. However, Baji Rao sought assistance from the British East India Company  Early life  Amrut Rao was born around 1770. He was adopted by Raghunath Rao, the Maratha Peshwa who allied with the British East India Company in 1775. However, the British later signed the Treaty of Salbai (1782) with Raghunath's rivals among the Marathas, and acknowledged Madhav Rao II as the Peshwa. Raghunath Rao died a year later in 1783, and his family was kept in confinement by the Peshwa's minister Nana Fadnavis. His wife Anandi Bai, his sons Baji Rao II and Chimaji Rao II, and his adopted son Amrut Rao were all kept imprisoned at Kopargaon until 1793. Subsequently, they were moved to Anandwali (in Nashik), and in April 1794, they were confined to the Shivneri fort. After the death of Peshwa Madhav Rao II, Nana Fadnavis and the powerful nobleman Daulat Rao Scindia installed Amrut Rao's adoptive brothers ‚Äî first Chimaji Rao and then Baji Rao II ‚Äî as titular Peshwas in quick succession. After Fadnavis' death, Daulat Rao Scindia held the actual power, while Baji Rao II was a puppet Peshwa.  Conflict with Daulat Rao Scindia  The widows of Daulat Rao Scindia's predecessor Mahadji Scindia fought with him for control of the Scindia court. In 1798, Scindia decided to transfer the widows to Ahmednagar, and keep them in confinement there. However, Muzaffar Khan, an officer loyal to the ladies, rescued them near Koregaon Bhima, when Scindia's men were moving them to Ahmednagar. Khan took the widows to Amrut Rao, who happened to be near Koregaon Bhima. Amrut Rao granted them protection. On the night of 7 June 1798, Scindia sent five infantry battalions under the command of a French officer ‚Äî Captain Du Prat, to retrieve the widows. However, Amrut Rao's army forced Scindia's men to retreat. Scindia then started negotiations, offering the ladies a chance to select their residence. Amrut Rao arrived near Pune to meet Scindia on behalf of the ladies. He set up his camp on the banks of the Mula river, near the Khadki bridge. Scindia's father-in-law and general Sarji Rao Ghatge (also known as Sarjerao) led two battalions to the riverside, on the pretext of maintaining order at the local Muharram procession. But his men opened fire at Amrut Rao's camp, with 25 cannons. As Amrut Rao's troops dispersed, Ghatge's force attacked them and pillaged their camp. The widows then fled to Kolhapur.  Holkar's occupation of Pune  On 25 October 1802, Daulat Rao Scindia's rival noble Yashwant Rao Holkar invaded Pune, defeating the joint forces of Scindia and Peshwa Baji Rao II, in the Battle of Hadapsar. After taking control of Pune, Holkar decide to install a titular Peshwa at Pune. While the office of the Peshwa no longer held the actual power, an act of dislodging the Peshwa would be met with opposition by other Maratha nobles. Therefore, Holkar sent for Baji Rao's brother Amrut Rao, who was in Junnar. Amrut Rao arrived in Pune with his son Vinayak Rao, who had been adopted by Yasoda Bai, the widow of Baji Rao II's predecessor Peshwa Madhav Rao II. Holkar set up an ad-hoc council headed by Amrut Rao, and ran the Peshwa's government in his name. He also attempted to give a legal status to his new government at Pune by appointing Vinayak Rao as the new Peshwa. On 13 March 1803, Holkar left Pune, leaving Amrut Rao with 1,000 soldiers. Meanwhile, Baji Rao II had fled to Vasai, and had sought assistance from the British. Yashwant Rao Holkar and Amrut Rao unsuccessfully tried to obtain British support for their government. But the British signed the Treaty of Bassein with Baji Rao on 31 December 1802. In 1803, the British dispatched an army led by Arthur Wellesley to capture Pune and restore Baji Rao II as the titular Peshwa under British authority. Amrut Rao was forced to flee Pune with Holkar's men. As Wellesley advanced towards Pune, he received news that Amrut Rao had plundered the city, and that Holkar had ordered his general to burn down the city before leaving it. However, by the time he reached the city on 20 April 1803, he found the city to be safe. The British restored Baji Rao II as a titular Peshwa on 13 May 1803, this time under British control.  After fleeing Pune  Holkar had left his European officer William Linn√¶us Gardner as a liaison officer (actually a spy) in Amrut Rao's camp. After being forced to flee from Pune, Amrut Rao felt betrayed by Holkar, who had left him with a small force against the mighty British. As a result, Amrut Rao imprisoned Gardner. Subsequently, he summoned Gardner and suggested that they both join Holkar's rival Scinda, with Gardner serving as a trainer for Amrut Rao's soldiers. Gardner laughed at the proposal, which enraged Amrut Rao. At one point, Amrut Rao's soldiers bound him to the muzzle of a cannon. However, they did not actually execute him, since he was a valuable prisoner: as one of Holkar's best officers, he could be offered to Scindia. While Amrut Rao was on his way to meet Scindia, Gardner managed to escape from his custody. Meanwhile, the British general Arthur Wellesley opened correspondence with Amrut Rao. Wellesley saw him as a valuable ally, who could turn into a dangerous opponent if antagonized. Amrut Rao had joined Holkar reluctantly, and saw little sense in fighting against the British. Consequently, the two parties decided to negotiate, although Peshwa Baji Rao II considered Amrut Rao his enemy and was not happy with the rapprochement. On 14 August 1803, Amrut Rao signed an agreement with the British. He agreed to abandon all claims over the Peshwa's office and to remain friendly with the British. In return, he would receive an annual pension of 7 lakhs annually from the Company with a jagir in Banda district. He took up his residence at Karwi. He and his descendants governed the Tiroha (Kirur) estate of the Bundelkhand Agency. There, he became well known for his religiousness and charity. He once freed all the persons imprisoned in Benares for debt, by paying off their debts. Amrut Rao died on 6 September 1824, at Secrole near Benares. His son and successor Vinayak Rao died childless in 1853. Vinayak's adopted sons Narayan and Madho joined the 1857 uprising after the Company ceased their pension. The revolt was crushed: Narayan Rao died a prisoner, while Madho Rao was allowed to remain a landlord in consideration of his young age at the time of the uprising.

Information and awareness outreach includes door-to-door campaigns and water literacy training. Infrastructure projects include rooftop rainwater harvesting, check dams, water storage tanks, recharge wells and ponds, biosand filters, and wastewater disposal structures. The foundation supports rejuvenating traditional wells as a more sustainable alternative to tube wells. These interventions help dry villages become water sufficient. In 2014, the foundation won the Millennium Alliance Award for Outstanding Work on Pressurized Recharge Wells for Creating Fresh Water Pockets in Saline Ground Water Areas. The technology was recognized in September 2015 at the United Nations Solutions Summit as one of 14 \\"innovative\\" projects profiled that provide \\"breakthrough solutions\\" to help meet sustainable global development goals. S M Sehgal Foundation engineers designed a biosand filter that was more effective than previous versions in treating water contamination at the household level.Ahmed, Khusnuma Parween, \\"Germ-free research: JalKalp model to provide safe drinking water,\\" Rural Marketing Magazine, 30 January 2016. The filter operates without electricity and is effective against E.coli, total coliforms, turbidity, and iron contamination. The technology integrates germicidal properties of copper with conventional filtration. Sehgal Foundation technical experts collaborate with other NGOs, government bodies, and educational institutions to prepare for monsoon harvesting. = Agriculture = The agricultural development program promotes sustainable farming practices to improve soil health and crop yield, use water efficiently, empower women farmers, and enhance farmers' income. The foundation sponsors demonstration plots and training on a crop-specific package of practices. Exposure tours, farmers‚Äô meetings, and field days showcase methods of composting, vermicomposting, drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, the effective use of microorganisms for quality manure. Information communication technology (ICT) provides voice messages to farmers on crop and livestock management. Partnership projects of differing lengths with farmer groups vary by crop, strategy, location, and beneficiary. Native plants are planted in catchment areas and around check dams, ponds, and school boundaries. The foundation's crop improvement research unit housed in Hyderabad at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) is recognized as a Scientific and Industrial Research Organization by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India.

Legal literacy camps train citizens to use systems to obtain their rightful entitlements.\\"Legal Literacy Projects: Clinical Experience of Empowering the Poor in India\\", in Frank S. Bloch (ed.), The Global Clinical Movement: Educating Lawyers for Social Justice, New York, 2010. A training initiative begun in 2009 in collaboration with Jindal Global Law School, called Good Governance Now! (Sushasan Abhi!), brings justice to marginalized people in India's most \\"backward\\" districts. In 2014, the foundation created a telephone hotline for citizens to receive guidance on addressing concerns to government departments and village-level institutions. The Sushasan Abhi team works with and educates communities and panchayats to promote sanitation and eliminate open defecation in keeping with Swachh Bharat Mission (clean India campaign). Awareness is raised about government schemes and entitlements so that villagers are empowered to claim their rights.  Community Radio  In 2012, the foundation launched a community radio station in Ghaghas village in Mewat, Haryana. Alfaz-e-Mewat (Voice of Mewat) FM 107.8 provides call-in programs for discussion of village issues and government programs. Educational and entertainment programs and children's programs are developed and shared in collaboration with other community radio stations. Community members are broadcasters and reporters. Informational programs address farm practices, sanitation and health issues, conservation and environmental awareness, rural governance, and the empowerment of women and girls. In areas without radio signals, villagers listen and participate by calling a toll-free number.

He has been the Archbishop of Barcelona since the end of 2015. On 28 June 2017, Pope Francis raised him to the rank of cardinal in 2017. On 3 March 2020 was elected President of Episcopal Conference of Spain.  Biography  Omella was born in the village of Cretas in the province of Teruel, Aragon, where both Castillian and Catalan are spoken. One of his sisters still lives there, while the other died at a young age. The village priest prepared him to enter the seminary of Zaragoza. He studied at education centres for missionaries in Leuven and Jerusalem as well. On 20 September 1970 he was ordained a priest. He then worked for the church in Zaragoza and in Zaire. Pope John Paul II appointed him auxiliary bishop of Zaragoza on 15 July 1996 and he was consecrated a bishop on 22 September by El√≠as Yanes Alvarez, Archbishop of Zaragoza. John Paul II named him bishop of Barbastro-Monz√≥n in 1999. He held the posts of Apostolic Administrator of Huesca and of Jaca from 2001 to 2003. In 2004 he was named bishop of Calahorra and La Calzada-Logro√±o. He has been a member of the Commission of Social Ministry of the Spanish Episcopal Conference since 1996 and president of that commission from 2002 to 2008. He is serving another term as president from 2014 to 2017. On 6 November 2014, Pope Francis appointed him a member of the Congregation for Bishops. According to El Periodico, Omella engineered the early retirement of Manuel Ure√±a Pastor as Archbishop of Zaragoza in November 2014. On 6 November 2015, Pope Francis appointed Omella Archbishop of Barcelona. He was installed there on 26 December. On 21 May 2017, Pope Francis announced plans to make him a cardinal at a consistory scheduled for 28 June 2017. El Diario said the appointment made clear that Pope Francis's representatives in Spain were not the conservatives recently elected to head the Spanish Episcopal Conference, but Omella and Carlos Osoro, the Archbishop of Madrid whom Francis made a cardinal in 2016. It noted that Omella's appointment to the Congregation for Bishops positioned him to influence the future of church leadership in Spain. It cited as well his pastoral letters on social issues and ties to , which focuses on the problems of developing nations. The consistory was held on 28 June as scheduled. Following the Catalan independence referendum in 2017 the Catalan government suggested that Omella and the Abbot of Montserrat should act as mediators between the region and Spanish authorities. Francis made him a member of the Congregation for Bishops and of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura on 23 December 2017. Omella is the co-author, with Miguel Pothoes Mombiela and Jos√© Mar√≠a Navarro, of La aurora de Calanda, una antigua instituci√≥n, published in 1991.

String is used to tie, bind, or hang other objects. It is also used as a material to make things, such as textiles, and in arts and crafts. String is a simple tool, and its use by humans is known to have been developed tens of thousands of years ago.Susan Toby Evans, David L. Webster, Archaeology of Ancient Mexico and Central America: An Encyclopedia (2013), p. 812. In Mesoamerica, for example, string was invented some 20,000 to 30,000 years ago, and was made by twisting plant fibers together. String may also be a component in other tools, and in devices as diverse as weapons, musical instruments, and toys. Two pieces of string under a light microscope  History  String was used in prehistoric times to make fire, as part of a drilling tool called the bow drill, which makes fire by friction, as well as fishing lines, nets, clothing, shelter making materials, bow string, sutures, traps, cordage, and countless other uses. Bow drills were used in Mehrgarh between the 4th and 5th millennium BC. Similar drills were found in other parts of the Indus Valley Civilization and Iran one millennium later. In Roman times, the same principle also was used widely in drilling for purposes of woodworking and dentistry. Macram√© comes from a 13th-century Arabic weavers‚Äô word migramah meaning ‚Äúfringe‚Äù. This refers to the decorative fringes on camels and horses which help, amongst other things, to keep the flies off the animal in the hot desert regions of northern Africa. One of the earliest recorded uses of macram√© style knots as decoration appeared in the carvings of the Babylonians and Assyrians. Fringe-like plaiting and braiding adorned the costumes of the time and were captured in their stone statuary.  Types  There are many types of string, adapted to many uses. Here are some examples: = Twine = Twine is a light string or strong thread composed of two or more smaller strands or yarns twisted, and then twisted together. More generally, the term can be applied to a cord. Natural fibres used for making twine include cotton, sisal, jute, hemp, henequen, and coir. A variety of synthetic fibres are also used. = Yarn = Yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, suitable for use in the production of textiles, sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, and ropemaking. Thread is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or machine. Modern manufactured sewing threads may be finished with wax or other lubricants to withstand the stresses involved in sewing.Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: Textiles, 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, , p. 203 Embroidery threads are yarns specifically designed for hand or machine embroidery.  Thread  Thread is a type of yarn used for sewing. Thread is made from a wide variety of materials. The following table lists common materials, a general description and what they are supposed to be good for. If your machine will sew with the thread, any thread can used for just about any purpose. This is very useful for someone who is trying to learn sewing. However, it should be remembered that where a thread is stronger than the material that it is being used to join, if seams are placed under strain the material may tear before the thread breaks. Garments are usually sewn with threads of lesser strength than the fabric so that if stressed the seam will break before the garment. Heavy goods that must withstand considerable stresses such as upholstery, car seating, tarpaulins, tents, and saddlery require very strong threads. Attempting repairs with light weight thread will usually result in rapid failure, though again, using a thread that is stronger than the material being sewn can end up causing rips in that material before the thread itself gives way. = Bowstring = A bowstring joins the two ends of the bow stave and launches the arrow. Desirable properties include light weight, strength, resistance to abrasion, and resistance to water. Mass has most effect at the center of the string; of extra mass in the middle of the string slows the arrow about as much as at the ends.Design and Construction of Flight Bows - a supplement to \\"The Design and Construction of Composite Recurve Bows\\" by John Clark. Ausbow Industries, not dated Traditional materials include linen, hemp, other vegetable fibers, sinew, silk, and rawhide. Almost any fiber may be used in emergency. = Drawstring = Hoodie with drawstring A drawstring (draw string, draw-string) is a string, cord, lace, or rope used to \\"draw\\" (gather, or shorten) fabric or other material. The ends of the drawstring may be tied to hold it in place (and/or simultaneously close an opening). Alternately, the drawstring may be kept drawn using a cordlock. Typically, the drawstring is loose when not being used, and tightened when needed during use. = Pullstring = A pullstring (pull string, pull-string), pullcord (pull cord, pull-cord), or pullchain (pull-chain, pull chain) is a string, cord, or chain wound on a spring-loaded spindle that engages a mechanism when it is pulled. It is most commonly used in toys and motorized equipment. More generally and commonly, a pullstring can be any type of string, cord, rope, chain, or cable attached to an object in some way used to pull or mechanically manipulate part of it. = Shoestrings = Shoelaces, also called shoestrings (US English) or bootlaces (UK English), are a system commonly used to secure shoes, boots and other footwear.They typically consist of a pair of strings or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as aglets. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks on either side of the shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to open wide enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot within the shoe. = Strings on musical instruments = In music, a string is the vibrating element that produces sound in string instruments such as the guitar, harp, piano (piano wire), and members of the violin family. Strings are lengths of a flexible material that a musical instrument holds under tension so that they can vibrate freely, but controllably. Strings may be \\"plain\\" (consisting only of a single material, like catgut, nylon, or steel). \\"Wound\\" strings have a \\"core\\" of one material, with an overwinding of other materials. This is to make the string vibrate at the desired pitch, while maintaining a low profile and sufficient flexibility for playability. The invention of wound strings, such as nylon covered in wound metal, was a crucial step in string instrument technology, because a metal-wound string can produce a lower pitch than a catgut string of similar thickness. This enabled stringed instruments to be made with less thick bass strings. On string instruments that the player plucks or bows directly (e.g., double bass), this enabled instrument makers to use thinner strings for the lowest-pitched strings, which made the lower-pitch strings easier to play. On stringed instruments in which the player presses a keyboard, causing a mechanism to strike the strings, such as a piano, this enabled piano builders to use shorter, thicker strings to produce the lowest-pitched bass notes, enabling the building of smaller upright pianos designed for small rooms and practice rooms. = Tennis strings = In tennis, the strings are the part of a tennis racquet which make contact with the ball. The strings form a woven network inside the head (or \\"hoop\\") of the racquet. Strings have been made with a variety of materials and possess varying properties that have been measured, such as dynamic stiffness, tension retention, thickness (gauge), string texture (shape of the string), and rebound efficiency.String Selector 2010, Racquet Sports Industry Magazine  Further uses and applications  = Chalk line = A chalk line or chalk box is a tool for marking long, straight lines on relatively flat surfaces, much farther than is practical by hand or with a straightedge. It is an important tool in construction and carpentry, the working of timber in a rough and unplaned state, as it does not require the timber to have a straight or squared edge formed onto it beforehand. A chalk line draws straight lines by the action of a taut nylon or similar string that has been previously coated with a loose dye, usually chalk. The string is then laid across the surface to be marked and pulled tight. Next, the string is then plucked or snapped sharply, causing the string to strike the surface, which then transfers its chalk to the surface along that straight line where it struck. = Cloth = A textile or cloth is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres (yarn or thread). Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, or other material to produce long strands. Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or felting. = Clothes line = A clothes line or washing line is any type of rope, cord, or twine that has been stretched between two points (e.g. two sticks), outside or indoors, above the level of the ground. Clothing that has recently been washed is hung along the line to dry, using clothes pegs or clothespins. Washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall, and are frequently located in back gardens, or on balconies. Longer washing lines often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing. = Bead stringing = Bead stringing is the putting of beads on string. It can range from simply sliding a single bead onto any thread-like medium (string, silk thread, leather thong, thin wire, multi-stranded beading wire, or a soft, flexible wire) to complex creations that have multiple strands or interwoven levels. The choice of stringing medium can be an important point in the overall design, since string-type mediums might be subject to unwanted stretching if the weight of the beads is considerable. Similarly, certain bead types with sharp edges, such as hollow metal beads or some varieties of stone or glass, might abrade the string and cause the strand to eventually break. = Knot tying = A knot is a method of fastening or securing linear material such as string by tying or interweaving. It may consist of a length of one or several segments of string, twine, cord, strap, rope, or even chain interwoven such that the line can bind to itself or to some other object (the \\"load\\"). = Macram√© = Macram√© or macrame is a form of textile-making using knotting rather than weaving or knitting. Its primary knots are the square knot (a variant of the reef knot) and forms of \\"hitching\\": full hitch and double half hitches. It was long crafted by sailors, especially in elaborate or ornamental knotting forms, to decorate anything from knife handles to bottles to parts of ships. = Plumb bob = A plumb bob, or plummet, is a weight, usually with a pointed tip on the bottom, suspended from a string and used as a vertical reference line, or plumb-line. It is essentially the vertical equivalent of a \\"water level\\". = String art = String art, or pin and thread art, is characterized by an arrangement of colored thread strung between points to form geometric patterns or representational designs such as a ship's sails, sometimes with other artist material comprising the remainder of the work. Thread, wire, or string is wound around a grid of nails hammered into a velvet-covered wooden board. Though straight lines are formed by the string, the slightly different angles and metric positions at which strings intersect gives the appearance of B√©zier curves (as in the mathematical concept of envelope of a family of straight lines). Quadratic B√©zier curve are obtained from strings based on two intersecting segments. Other forms of string art include Spirelli, which is used for cardmaking and scrapbooking, and curve stitching, in which string is stitched through holes.  String figures  A string figure is a design formed by manipulating string on, around, and using one's fingers or sometimes between the fingers of multiple people. String figures may also involve the use of the mouth, wrist, and feet. They may consist of singular images or be created and altered as a game, known as a string game, or as part of a story involving various figures made in sequence (string story). = String toys =  Astrojax  Astrojax is a toy consisting of three balls on a string. One ball is fixed at each end of the string, and the center ball is free to slide along the string between the two end balls. Inside each ball is a metal weight. The metal weight lowers the moment of inertia of the center ball so it can rotate rapidly in response to torques applied by the string. This prevents the string from snagging or tangling around the center ball.  Yo-yo  A yo-yo (also spelled yoyo) is a toy which in its simplest form is an object consisting of an axle connected to two disks, and a length of string looped around the axle, similar to a slender spool. It is played by holding the free end of the string known as the handle (usually by inserting one finger into a slip knot) allowing gravity or the force of a throw to spin the yo-yo and unwind the string (similar to how a pullstring works), then allowing the yo-yo to wind itself back to one's hand, exploiting its spin (and the associated rotational energy). This is often called \\"yo-yoing\\". First made popular in the 1920s, yo- yoing remains a popular pastime of many generations and cultures. It was first invented in ancient Greece. = Weaving = Weaving is a method of textile production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth. Other methods are knitting, felting, and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling. (Weft or woof is an old English word meaning \\"that which is woven\\".) The method in which these threads are inter woven affects the characteristics of the cloth. Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them. A fabric band which meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including tablet weaving, back-strap, or other techniques without looms.

Founding JPT was founded in the second half of the 1950s, following the banning of PGT after the overthrow of Jacobo √Årbenz.Revista D. La JPT, esa desconocida Unlike the previous √Årbenz-era PGT youth wing, the Democratic Youth Alliance, the JPT was formed as an explicitly communist organization. JPT built a strong presence at universities and high schools. Guerrilla struggles The Cuban Revolution had profound impact on the militants of JPT. In 1962 the PGT leadership gathered a group of JPT members in Cuba. The Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) were formed, its first fighters were JPT members who had obtained scholarships to study in Cuba and who had started guerrilla warfare training there (without the blessing of the PGT leadership). In 1965 JPT and PGT took part in forming the Edgar Ibarra Guerrilla Front (FGEI), under the umbrella of FAR and based in Sierra de las Minas. In 1965 PGT dissolved JPT and 1966 the party included a number JPT leaders in the PGT leadership. When FAR and PGT parted ways in 1968 a major share of the erstwhile JPT members followed FAR rather than the mother party. In December 1969 PGT set up a Special Commission to reactivate the JPT under its control, but in the immediate years after the PGT-FAR split JPT was largely marginalized. In the following years, a majority of guerrilla leaders in Guatemala were ex-members of JPT. In particular, many guerrilla leaders had been recruited to JPT through its high school organizations. Student activism JPT members were influential in Frente, which emerged as a dominant student organization in San Carlos University in the mid-1970s. Frente won control over the University Students Association (AEU) in 1976 and the successor organizations of Frente held sway in AEU until 1985. Dissolution PGT again decided to dissolve JPT in 1981.

The filly began her racing career by finishing fourth to Legatissimo in a seven furlong maiden race at Galway Races on 29 July. At the Curragh on 23 August she started 11/10 favourite for a similar event over one mile but after leading for most of the way she was overtaken and beaten three quarters of a length by her stable companion Found. Eight days later she turned out again for the Listed Flame of Tara Stakes over the same course and distance. She led until the final furlong before being overtaken and finished third behind Jack Naylor (a filly despite her name) and Legatissimo. In September the filly was dropped back in class for a maiden race over one mile at Gowran Park and started the 8/13 favourite against fifteen opponents. Together Forever tracked the leaders before taking the lead two furlongs out and drew away from the field to win \\"easily\\" by five lengths. Together Forever moved back up to Listed level for the Staffordstown Stud Stakes over one mile at the Curragh on 12 October. Starting the 11/10 favourite she took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish, repelled a challenge from her stablemate Cocoon and won by three lengths. Five days after her win at the Curragh, Together Forever was sent to England to contest the Group One Fillies' Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. The Rockfel Stakes winner Lucida started favourite ahead of the Dick Poole Fillies' Stakes runner up Marsh Hawk and the May Hill Stakes winner Agnes Stewart with Together Forever fourth choice in the betting at odds of 7/1. The other three runners were Forte from the Ralph Beckett stable and the Godolphin pair Good Place and Winters Moon. O'Brien positioned the filly before behind the pacemakers before moving up to take the lead approaching the final furlong at which point the early leader Marsh Hawk was engaged in a \\"barging match\\" with Lucida. Together Forever kept on well in the closing stages and won by half a length and a short head from Agnes Stewart and Winters Moon.https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/88073/belardo-among- juvenile-standouts-at-newmarket Explaining the filly's improvement, Joseph O'Brien said \\"In the early part of the season we made use of her massive stride in her maiden and it just didn't seem to work. Then at Gowran I tucked her in and got her to relax and I felt a turn of foot that I hadn't felt before and she's done nothing but improve since. I think she has plenty of pace and there is no reason why she couldn't start at a Guineas and go on to an Oaks\\". =2015: three-year-old season= Although Together Forever was expected to contest the 1000 Guineas the filly bypassed the race and made her three-year-old debut in the Musidora Stakes (a trial race for The Oaks) over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse on 13 May. Ridden by Ryan Moore she chased the leaders and stayed on well in the straight but failed by a head to overhaul the favourite Star of Seville. In the 237th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse on 5 June the filly started 9/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Legatissimo, Jack Naylor and Lady of Dubai. After reaching second place in the straight she was badly hampered and finished seventh behind her stable companion Qualify. Seamie Heffernan took the ride when the filly contested the Irish Oaks at the Curragh on 18 July. In a change of tactics Together Forever went to the front soon after the start and opened up an eight length advantage over her rivals. She faded in the straight however, lost the lead a furlong out and finished fourth behind Covert Love. PedigreeTogether Forever is inbred 3 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree.

The population had increased to 607 people in 1920 the census. According to conditions in that time growth of population is one of the rare villages. It is the reason of Muslim population who live together with non-Muslim population in other villages to flee to in higher safe places from the pressures of the gangs.

Its offices are located at 3909 Rush Mendon Road in Mendon, New York, The Sentinel is published by Sentinel Publications, a division of Pandamensional Solutions Inc. The first issue of the Mendon-Honeoye Falls-Lima Sentinel was published on March 23, 1989 and has been published weekly on Thursdays since. The Sentinel is a member of the New York Press Association. History Founded in March 1989 as the Mendon-Honeoye Falls-Lima Sentinel by Shirley Arena and Christopher Carosa, the paper took the place of the Honeoye Falls Times and Lima Recorder both of which ceased publication on January 12, 1989 and were merged with the Honeoye Lake Courier and Livonia Gazette to form the Town & Country Gazette. The Honeoye Falls Times had served the Mendon-Honeoye Falls area since 1888, while the Lima Recorder had served the Lima area since 1869. The Town & Country Gazette abruptly stopped publication on March 23, 1989 when its owner, Downtown Magazine, Inc., filed Chapter 11. Richard A. Gagliano, who published the Town & Country Gazette, had previously purchased the Honeoye Falls Times, Lima Recorder, and other area newspaper from Dorotha Bradley in 1987. In mid-January 1989, Arena, who had spent five years working for the Honeoye Falls Times, and Carosa, who previously published two newsletters and was currently a Managing Director at Manning and Napier Advisers, Inc., met to discuss forming a new newspaper to replace the now folded Honeoye Falls Times and Lima Recorder. In a little more than eight weeks, the two founders went from an idea to setting up a full-fledged publishing outfit using what was then new desktop publishing technology, making the Mendon-Honeoye Falls-Lima Sentinel one of the first print papers to use such an advanced electronic system. The first issue of the Sentinel was eight pages and was mailed for free to five thousand households in the Honeoye Falls-Lima Central School District. Arena wrote the \\"Heard on the Street\\" column and Carosa, who, ironically once led his high school classmates to walk out of their Advanced Placement English class in an impromptu \\"strike\\", penned a \\"homespun\\" column called \\"The Carosa Commentary\\". According to published reports, readers were delighted with this first issue: \\"The response was phenomenal,\\" Carosa was quoted as saying, \\"People were writing notes on their checks saying 'great idea.' People were calling us for ads.\\" At the time the annual subscription rate was $12.50 a year and individual issues cost 35 cents. The original advisory board for Sentinel Publications was Robert Borsching Sr., Leslie Edgecomb III, Judith Farrar, Elliot Frank, Dr. James Frenck, Rev. Charles Latus, J. Arnold Leckie, Everett Lewis, Johanna O'Brien, Pat Reynolds, Jim Robeson, Ken Schreib, John Stanwix, Richard Walker, Rick West, Pete Yendell, and Robert Young. In the mid-1990s, Carosa sold his share of the Sentinel to Arena, who continued to operate the newspaper until her death in April 2009. From 2009 to 2015, Michael Shellman, Arena's grandson, owned and operated the weekly newspaper. In December 2015, Pandamensional Solutions Inc., a publishing firm located in Mendon, purchased the Mendon-Honeoye Falls-Lima Sentinel and began operations in January 2016. With the exception of Shellman, the current staff was retained. Betsy Carosa, the wife of Christopher Carosa, is the President/Owner of Pandamensional Solutions, Inc. and the owner of the Sentinel. Christopher Carosa returned as Publisher, although he continues to manage and operate Carosa Stanton Asset Management, LLC and the Bullfinch Fund, firms he started using seed money from the proceeds of his original sale of the Sentinel to Arena.

The narrow bridge lies on the A6 road, and until the opening of the M6 motorway, it was a notorious bottleneck. It is still controlled by traffic lights. The bridge crosses the old county boundary between Cumberland and Westmorland and is one of the oldest bridges in the county still in daily use. It was built in 1425 after the Bishop of Durham, Thomas Langley, offered indulgences to anyone contributing towards its construction, and it was widened in 1875. It is a slightly humpbacked three-arched bridge made of grey sandstone with alterations in red sandstone. The solid parapets include pedestrian refuges above the pillars. Like the village, the bridge stands partly in Yanwath and Eamont Bridge parish and partly in Penrith. In December 2015, the bridge was declared unsafe and closed to traffic, following severe flooding caused by Storm Frank.

The invasion stalled in the face of Iranian resistance, but not before Iraq captured more than 15,000 km2 of Iran's territory. This invasion led to eight years of war between Iran and Iraq. After President of Iran Abolhassan Banisadr declared Iran was not following the 1975 Algiers Agreement and neither had Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, on 17 September Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced that Iraq abrogated the 1975 Algiers Agreement and intended to exercise full sovereignty over the disputed Shatt al-Arab river in response to Iranian violations of the treaty. On 22 September, Iraqi aircraft bombarded ten airfields in Iran to cripple the Iranian air force on the ground. Although this attack failed, the next day Iraqi forces crossed the border in strength and advanced into Iran in three simultaneous thrusts along a front of some 400 miles (644 km). Of Iraq's six divisions that were invading by ground, four were sent to Khuzestan Province, which was located near the border's southern end, to cut off the Shatt al-ArabCalled Arvand Roud () in Iran and Shatt al-Arab() in Iraq from the rest of Iran and to establish a territorial security zone. The invasion's purpose, according to Saddam, was to blunt the edge of Iranian Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini's movement and thwart his attempts to export Iran's Islamic Revolution to Iraq and the Persian Gulf states. Saddam hoped that by annexing Khuzestan, he would send such a blow to Iran's prestige that it would lead to the new government's downfall, or, at the very least, end Iran's calls for his overthrow. He also wanted to elaborate his standing in the Arab world and among Arab countries. Saddam expected the local Arabs of Khuzestan to rise against the Islamic government. However, these objectives failed to materialize, and the majority of local Iranian Arabs fought alongside Iranian forces. Iraq's purpose Saddam's primary interest in war may have stemmed from his desire to right the supposed \\"wrong\\" of the Algiers Agreement, in addition to finally achieving his desire of annexing Khuzestan and becoming the regional superpower. Saddam's goal was to replace Egypt as the \\"leader of the Arab world\\" and to achieve hegemony over the Persian Gulf. He saw Iran's increased weakness due to revolution, sanctions, and international isolation. Saddam had invested heavily in Iraq's military since his defeat against Iran in 1975, buying large amounts of weaponry from the Soviet Union and France. By 1980, Iraq possessed 200,000 soldiers, 2,000 tanks and 450 aircraft. Watching the powerful Iranian army that frustrated him in 1974‚Äì1975 disintegrate, he saw an opportunity to attack, using the threat of Islamic Revolution as a pretext. The Shatt al-Arab waterway on the Iran‚ÄìIraq border A successful invasion of Iran would enlarge Iraq's petroleum reserves and make Iraq the region's dominant power. With Iran engulfed in chaos, an opportunity for Iraq to annex the oil-rich Khuzestan Province materialized. In addition, Khuzestan's large ethnic Arab population would allow Saddam to pose as a liberator for Arabs from Persian rule. Fellow Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (despite being hostile to Iraq) encouraged Iraq to attack, as they feared that an Islamic revolution would take place within their own borders. Certain Iranian exiles also helped convince Saddam that if he invaded, the fledgling Islamic republic would quickly collapse. Prelude In 1979‚Äì80, Iraq was the beneficiary of an oil boom that saw it take in US$33 billion, which allowed the government to go on a spending spree on both civilian and military projects. On several occasions, Saddam alluded to the Islamic conquest of Iran in promoting his position against Iran. For example, on 2 April 1980, half a year before the war's outbreak, in a visit to Baghdad's al-Mustansiriya University, he drew parallels to Persia's defeat at the 7th century Battle of al-QƒÅdisiyyah: > In your name, brothers, and on behalf of the Iraqis and Arabs everywhere we > tell those Persian cowards and dwarfs who try to avenge al-Qadisiyah that > the spirit of al-Qadisiyah as well as the blood and honor of the people of > al-Qadisiyah who carried the message on their spearheads are greater than > their attempts.Speech made by Saddam Hussein. Baghdad, Voice of the Masses > in Arabic, 2 April 1980. FBIS-MEA-80-066. 3 April 1980, E2-3. E3 In 1979‚Äì1980, anti-Ba'ath riots arose in the Iraq's Shia areas by groups who were working toward an Islamic revolution in their country. Saddam and his deputies believed that the riots had been inspired by the Iranian Revolution and instigated by Iran's government. On 10 March 1980, when Iraq declared Iran's ambassador persona non-grata, and demanded his withdrawal from Iraq by 15 March, Iran replied by downgrading its diplomatic ties to the charge d'affaires level, and demanded that Iraq withdraw their ambassador from Iran. In April 1980, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr and his sister Amina Haydar (better known as Bint al-Huda) were hanged as part of a crackdown to restore Saddam's control. The execution of Iraq's most senior Ayatollah caused outrage throughout the Islamic world, especially among Shias. In April 1980, Shia militants assassinated 20 Ba'ath officials, and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was almost assassinated on 1 April; Aziz survived, but 11 students were killed in the attack. Three days later, the funeral procession being held to bury the students was bombed. Iraqi Information Minister Latif Nusseif al- Jasim also barely survived assassination by Shia militants. The Shias' repeated calls for the overthrow of the Ba'ath party and the support they allegedly received from Iran's new government led Saddam to increasingly perceive Iran as a threat that, if ignored, might one day overthrow him; he thus used the attacks as pretext for attacking Iran that September, though skirmishes along the Iran‚ÄìIraq border had already become a daily event by May that year. Iraq soon after expropriated the properties of 70,000 civilians believed to be of Iranian origin and expelled them from its territory. Many, if not most, of those expelled were in fact Arabic-speaking Iraqi Shias who had little to no family ties with Iran. This caused tensions between the two nations to increase further. Iraq also helped to instigate riots among Iranian Arabs in Khuzestan province, supporting them in their labor disputes, and turning uprisings into armed battles between Iran's Revolutionary Guards and militants, killing over 100 on both sides. At times, Iraq also supported armed rebellion by the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran in Kurdistan. The most notable of such events was the Iranian Embassy siege in London, in which six armed Khuzestani Arab insurgents took the Iranian Embassy's staff as hostages, resulting in an armed siege that was finally ended by Britain's Special Air Service. According to former Iraqi general Ra'ad al-Hamdani, the Iraqis believed that in addition to the Arab revolts, the Revolutionary Guards would be drawn out of Tehran, leading to a counter-revolution in Iran that would cause Khomeini's government to collapse and thus ensure Iraqi victory. However, rather than turning against the revolutionary government as experts had predicted, Iran's people (including Iranian Arabs) rallied in support of the country and put up a stiff resistance. =Border conflicts leading to war= By September, skirmishes between Iran and Iraq were increasing in number. Iraq began to grow bolder, both shelling and launching border incursions in disputed territories. Malovany describes the Iraqi Army's seizure of the Zayn al-Qaws enclave, near Khanaqin (by 6th Armoured Division, 2nd Corps); the Saif Sa'ad enclave (10th Armoured Division) and the Maysan enclave between Shib and Fakkeh (1st Mechanised Division, 3rd Corps).Malvany, Wars of Modern Babylon, 2017, 104-7. Iran responded by shelling several Iraqi border towns and posts, though this did little to alter the situation on the ground. By 10 September, Saddam declared that the Iraqi Army had \\"liberated\\" all disputed territories within Iran. It should be carefully noted that Malovany, an ex-Israeli intelligence analyst writing years later, said the enclaves were not completely seized until 21 September.Malovany, 2017, 106. With the conclusion of the \\"liberating operations\\", on 17 September, in a statement addressed to Iraq's parliament, Saddam stated: > The frequent and blatant Iranian violations of Iraqi sovereignty...have > rendered the 1975 Algiers Agreement null and void... This river [Shatt al- > Arab]...must have its Iraqi-Arab identity restored as it was throughout > history in name and in reality with all the disposal rights emanating from > full sovereignty over the river...We in no way wish to launch war against > Iran. Despite Saddam's claim that Iraq did not want war with Iran, the next day his forces proceeded to attack Iranian border posts in preparation for the planned invasion. Iraq's 7th Mechanised and 4th Infantry Divisions attacked the Iranian border posts leading to the cities of Fakkeh and Bostan, opening the route for future armoured thrusts into Iran. Weakened by internal chaos, Iran was unable to repel the attacks; which in turn led to Iraq becoming more confident in its military edge over Iran and prompting them to believe in a quick victory. Operation Mehrabad Air Base in Tehran after Iraqi forces attacked Tehran on 22 September, 1980 C-47 Skytrain =Air Attack= Iraq launched a full-scale invasion of Iran on 22 September 1980. The Iraqi Air Force launched surprise air strikes on ten Iranian airfields with the objective of destroying the Iranian Air Force, mimicking the Israeli Air Force in the Six-Day War. The attack failed to damage Iranian Air Force significantly: it damaged some of Iran's airbase infrastructure, but failed to destroy a significant number of aircraft: the Iraqi Air Force was only able to strike in depth with a few MiG-23BN, Tu-22, and Su-20 aircraft. Three MiG-23s managed to attack Tehran, striking its airport, but destroyed only a few aircraft. =Ground Invasion= The next day, Iraq launched a ground invasion along a front measuring in three simultaneous attacks. Of Iraq's six divisions that were invading by ground, four were sent to Khuzestan, which was located near the border's southern end, to cut off the Shatt al-Arab from the rest of Iran and to establish a territorial security zone. The other two divisions invaded across the northern and central part of the border to prevent an Iranian counter-attack. Northern Front On the northern front, the Iraqis attempted to establish a strong defensive position opposite Sulaymaniyah to protect the Iraqi Kirkuk oil complex. Central Front On the central front, the Iraqis occupied Mehran, advanced towards the foothills of the Zagros Mountains, and were able to block the traditional Tehran‚ÄìBaghdad invasion route by securing territory forward of Qasr-e Shirin, Iran. Southern Front Location of Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province in Iran Two of the four Iraqi divisions which invaded Khuzestan, one mechanised and one armoured, operated near the southern end and began a siege of the strategically important port cities of Abadan and Khorramshahr. The other two divisions, both armoured, secured the territory bounded by the cities of Khorramshahr, Ahvaz, Susangerd, and Musian. Iraqi hopes of an uprising by the ethnic Arabs of Khuzestan failed to materialise, as most of the ethnic Arabs remained loyal to Iran. The Iraqi troops advancing into Iran in 1980 were described by Patrick Brogan as \\"badly led and lacking in offensive spirit\\". The first known chemical weapons attack by Iraq on Iran probably took place during the fighting around Susangerd. First Battle of Khorramshahr On 22 September, a prolonged battle began in the city of Khorramshahr, eventually leaving 7,000 dead on each side. Reflecting the bloody nature of the struggle, Iranians came to call Khorramshahr \\"City of Blood\\" (, '). The battle began with Iraqi air raids against key points and mechanised divisions advancing on the city in a crescent-like formation. They were slowed by Iranian air attacks and Revolutionary Guard troops with recoilless rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and Molotov cocktails. The Iranians flooded the marsh areas around the city, forcing the Iraqis to traverse through narrow strips of land. Iraqi tanks launched attacks with no infantry support, and many tanks were lost to Iranian anti-tank teams. However, by 30 September, the Iraqis had managed to clear the Iranians from the outskirts of the city. The next day, the Iraqis launched infantry and armoured attacks into the city. After heavy house-to- house fighting, the Iraqis were repelled. On 14 October, the Iraqis launched a second offensive. The Iranians launched a controlled withdrawal from the city, street by street. By 24 October, most of the city was captured, and the Iranians evacuated across the Karun River. Some partisans remained, and fighting continued until 10 November. Iran's defense and counter attack Iranian Northrop F-5 during Iran‚ÄìIraq War Though the Iraqi air invasion surprised the Iranians, the Iranian air force retaliated with an attack against Iraqi military bases and infrastructure in Operation Kaman 99 (Bow 99). Groups of F-4 Phantom and F-5 Tiger fighter jets attacked targets throughout Iraq, such as oil facilities, dams, petrochemical plants, and oil refineries, and included Mosul Airbase, Baghdad, and the Kirkuk oil refinery. Iraq was taken by surprise at the strength of the retaliation, as Iran took few losses while the Iraqis took heavy defeats and economic disruption. The Iranian force of AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships began attacks on the advancing Iraqi divisions, along with F-4 Phantoms armed with Maverick missiles; they destroyed numerous armoured vehicles and impeded the Iraqi advance, though not completely halting it. Iran had discovered that a group of two or three low- flying F-4 Phantoms could hit targets almost anywhere in Iraq. Meanwhile, Iraqi air attacks on Iran were repulsed by Iran's F-14 Tomcat interceptor fighter jets, using Phoenix missiles, which downed a dozen of Iraq's Soviet- built fighters in the first two days of battle. Ali Khamenei (right), the future Supreme Leader of Iran, in a trench during the Iran-Iraq war. The Iranian regular military, police forces, volunteer Basij, and Revolutionary Guards all conducted their operations separately; thus, the Iraqi invading forces did not face coordinated resistance. However, on 24 September, the Iranian Navy attacked Basra, Iraq, destroying two oil terminals near the Iraqi port Faw, which reduced Iraq's ability to export oil. The Iranian ground forces (primarily consisting of the Revolutionary Guard) retreated to the cities, where they set up defences against the invaders. On 30 September, Iran's air force launched Operation Scorch Sword, striking and badly damaging the Osirak nuclear reactor near Baghdad. By 1 October, Baghdad had been subjected to eight air attacks. In response, Iraq launched aerial strikes against Iranian targets. Iraqi advance stalls The people of Iran, rather than turning against their still-weak Islamic Republic, rallied around their country. An estimated 200,000 fresh troops had arrived at the front by November, many of them ideologically committed volunteers. Though Khorramshahr was finally captured, the battle had delayed the Iraqis enough to allow the large-scale deployment of the Iranian military. In November, Saddam ordered his forces to advance towards Dezful and Ahvaz, and lay sieges to both cities. However, the Iraqi offensive had been badly damaged by Iranian militias and air power. Iran's air force had destroyed Iraq's army supply depots and fuel supplies, and was strangling the country through an aerial siege. On the other hand, Iran's supplies had not been exhausted, despite sanctions, and the military often cannibalised spare parts from other equipment and began searching for parts on the black market. On 28 November, Iran launched Operation Morvarid (Pearl), a combined air and sea attack which destroyed 80% of Iraq's navy and all of its radar sites in the southern portion of the country. When Iraq laid siege to Abadan and dug its troops in around the city, it was unable to blockade the port, which allowed Iran to resupply Abadan by sea. Iraq's strategic reserves had been depleted, and by now it lacked the power to go on any major offensives until nearly the end of the war. On 7 December, Hussein announced that Iraq was going on the defensive. By the end of 1980, Iraq had destroyed about 500 Western-built Iranian tanks and captured 100 others.Tucker, A. R. (1988).

The mural, which featured a large ear of corn with the word \\"HOOSIER\\" spelled out in the center in yellow on a white background, occupied the southern wall of the six- story apartment building. The mural was part of the renovation of the apartment complex, which opened on 11 December 1972.  Description  The mural measured approximately 75 feet wide and was painted in a matter of a week in August 1972. Mayer wanted to not only brand the new building as \\"The Hoosier,\\" but was employing the white paint on the wall in an effort to reflect light into the interior of the rooms. The mural was designed to help re-brand the Davian building into the \\"Hoosier Apartments.\\" a project that was completed by Woollen Associates in 1972. The \\"Hoosier Apartments\\" were designed to be apartments for Indianapolis elderly citizens. The mural was a feature element for the redesigned apartment building, which included a new urban park.  Historical information  This mural was the first example in the city of \\"super graphics,\\" which was becoming a way to refresh the visual appearance of buildings in urban settings. Woollen Associates was so in favor of the design that the firm itself paid for part of the painting. This mural, along with Roland Hobart's 1973 Untitled, Milton Glaser's 1974 Color Fuses which surrounds the Minton-Capehart Federal Building, and James Mcquiston's 1975 The Runners in downtown Indianapolis were hailed in August 1975 as adding a \\"delightful touch of color and imaginativeness to urban settings.\\" The mural was removed in the 1980s leaving practically no trace of its existence.

Led by Khun Narin, the group is known locally for their impromptu improvisational performances situated at backyard parties and parades. The group comprises a constantly rotating line-up of native musicians of varying ages, from children to elderly men. Khun Narin were discovered via YouTube when music producer Josh Marcy happened upon videos of their live performances. With his assistance, they released their first album, titled Electric Phin Band, on August 26, 2014.

The channel belonged to Thai phin player Beer Sitthichai, who had been recording and uploading videos of Khun Narin since late 2010. The group was locally respected and known to perform at parties. A video of the group performing \\"Zombie\\" by The Cranberries piqued Marcy's interest and he contacted Innovative Leisure Records. Innovative Leisure shared Marcy's interest in the band's music and paid for his plane trip to find them. After arriving in Thailand, Marcy contacted Peter Doolan, an American living in Bangkok who was an admirer of the group and had contact with them. Josh Marcy recorded an improvised live session of Narin Phin to serve as the content for the album Electric Phin Band, which was released on August 26, 2014 by Innovative Leisure Records. Critical response was very favorable and the band was lauded for their skilled and lively performances. The group followed up that release in 2016 with the release of II, issued by Innovative Leisure Records. Musical style The music of Khun Narin is grounded on Thai and Laotian melodies informed by garage music and psychedelic rock. Critics have noted a resemblance to the music of Konono N¬∫1 and Incredible String Band. Despite comparisons, the group claims to have had little exposure to more widely celebrated rock acts.

The church complex is composed of the main church, a parish hall, and a manse. The current complex at 54th Avenue, between Seabury Street and Queens Boulevard, is the fifth church complex built for the congregation. The congregation was founded in 1652 and was originally housed in a building that it shared with other congregations. In 1669, the town of Newtown (later Elmhurst) erected a new building for the churches. The congregation became part of the Presbyterian Church in 1715 and built a structure that was demolished during the American Revolutionary War. A second building, called the Old White Church, was erected in 1791 and remained standing until 1928. The congregation moved to its current building when it was completed in 1895. The manse was built in 1907. Both the church building and manse were moved in 1924 when Queens Boulevard was widened, and the parish hall was built in 1931. The current church building is a Late Gothic Revival style, granite and brownstone church with a steep slate gable roof. It features three large pointed arched windows and an square bell tower. The parish hall is a Collegiate Gothic-style brick building with a slate roof. The manse is a -story frame residence. The church complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. History =Initial buildings (c. 1652‚Äì1715)= Elmhurst was established in 1652 as the town of Middleburgh, an outpost of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam. The town's leaders had intended it to be a religiously diverse settlement. Soon after Middleburgh's establishment, a town building was erected to serve as both a community and religious building; it was on what is now Dongan Street near Broadway. Use of this building was shared by various religious denominations: the Church of England, the Dutch Reformed Church, the Presbyterians, and the Quakers. After the English gained control of New Amsterdam in 1665, they renamed Middleburgh to \\"Newtown\\"; subsequently, Newtown became part of Queens County in 1683. In 1669, the town planned to build a new church for all of these denominations on a \\"small gore of land\\" near Grand Avenue and Queens Boulevard, donated by Ralph Hunt, a prominent citizen of the town. According to the town records, the new building was to cost forty pounds, half in corn and half in cattle. The building was enlarged by contractors John Coe and Content Titus in 1694. The next year, Newtown purchased a house and from Samuel Coe for use as a parsonage. The Church of England became the Province of New York's official religion after the passage of the Ministry Act of 1693. As a consequence of the act, the parish of Jamaica was extended to cover the towns of Flushing and Newtown. Subsequently, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) became responsible for appointing the parish's Anglican rectors, who generally served multiple congregations at the time. During the same period, New York's provincial governor, Lord Cornbury, refused to let any pastor preach in the province if they dissented from the Church of England. However, after he was recalled in 1708, the Presbyterian congregation was allowed to choose its own new pastor, the Rev. Samuel Pumroy, who lived in the church farm parsonage. =Separate building (1715‚Äì1776)= On September 15, 1715, the congregation applied for membership in the Presbyterian Church. The congregation was admitted to the Presbytery of Philadelphia, and at the time, had eight members in full communion. In 1717, the congregation united with others in Jamaica and Setauket to form the Long Island Presbytery. Jonathan Fish, a parishioner, had deeded land near the present church site to the \\"dissenting Presbyterian congregation of Newtown\\" so the congregation could replace its dilapidated church building. The congregation received title to the land in March 1716. A church building was erected, though it was not completed until 1741; it had a spire with a bell suspended at the top. At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, most of Newtown's inhabitants were Loyalists who sided with the British. The Presbyterian Church of Newtown, like many other American Presbyterian congregations of the time, were Patriots who sympathized with American independence. The church created a \\"Committee of Correspondence\\" to communicate with the Continental Congress. A copy of the United States Declaration of Independence was read on the church steps in 1776, some days after independence was declared on July 4. Following the Battle of Long Island in August 1776, Newtown was occupied by the British, and public worship at the church was suspended. Several young Loyalists sawed off the church's steeple in the middle of the night. The British removed the pews and converted the church building into a jail. To insult the Presbyterians, the British left the pulpit in the street as a horse-hitching post. They subsequently destroyed the entire church building and reused the wood to build huts for their soldiers. Records show that some of the timber was sold for $250. =Old White Church (1791‚Äì1928)= Old White Church Only five of the original congregants remained in Newtown after the war; the others had been captured or killed, or had fled Newtown. The Reformed Church of Newtown let the Presbyterians use their building for the time being. The First Presbyterian Church of Newtown was legally incorporated in 1784. A new church building was erected under the ministry of the Rev. Peter Fish, who became stated supply pastor in 1785. The cornerstone was laid in 1787, and the new church was dedicated in 1791. At this time, a bell made by Gerit Bakker was placed in the belfry. This building, later called the Old White Church, was a two-story white-painted wood frame building on the north side of Hoffman Boulevard (present-day Queens Boulevard). A manse was built in 1821, and an adjacent plot of land for the church's cemetery was donated the next year. The church building itself was enlarged in 1836. Further renovations were undertaken during the ministry of the Rev. John P. Knox (1855‚Äì1882). This remodeling involved replacing the square-back pews and the windows. This building continued to be occupied by the congregation until 1895. At that time, the congregation moved to its current building, and the old building became a Sunday school. An annex to the Old White Church was built in 1909. The cemetery continued to accept burials until 1906. The Old White Church's manse was relocated to 53rd Avenue and Seabury Street, a block northwest of the current church, apparently in the mid-1920s. The Old White Church burned in 1928 when the belfry caught fire, presumably following a lightning strike. = Current church (1895‚Äìpresent) = left  Construction and early years  John Goldsmith Payntar, a wealthy merchant from Newtown and a member of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, died in August 1891. In his will, he left $65,000 for the construction of a new church building. Payntar stipulated that the building be \\"an exact copy\\" of Cherry Valley's Presbyterian Church in Cherry Valley, which Payntar had \\"greatly admired\\". Of his bequest, $35,000 was reserved for construction, of which some $4,000 was spent on the spire, $5,000 on the fence, and various other expenses for furnishings. Another $5,000 of Payntar's bequest was dedicated to general upkeep of the church yard. Additional funds were used to construct a stained glass window in Payntar's memory. A monument to Payntar and his family was also erected in the church yard. Frank A. Collins designed the new church while Hopkins & Roberts were the contractors. Construction started on the building in July 1893, and it was dedicated in May 1895. The new structure was built on the south side of Hoffman Boulevard, across the street from the old one. The congregation erected another building east of the bell tower, which was used by the Christian Endeavor organization as a meeting hall. The pastor at the time, the Rev. Jacob Mallmann, resigned five months afterward as a result of a dispute over the maintenance of the new church building. During the late 1890s, Newtown was renamed Elmhurst and became part of the City of Greater New York. Elmhurst started being developed as a commercial and residential neighborhood. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that the congregation grew by 104 members from 1896 to its 250th anniversary in 1902. The church's trustees agreed to build a new manse in 1905, and it was completed by 1907. The church paid Collins $200, likely in conjunction with designing the manse, which ultimately cost $5,000.  Relocation and later history  Seen from across Queens Boulevard Queens Boulevard was developed in the early 20th century, incorporating the former Hoffman Boulevard and connecting Elmhurst to the Queensboro Bridge to Manhattan. The city government formed a commission in 1912 to expropriate land and compensate property owners. In the First Presbyterian Church of Newtown's case, the city offered to either buy and raze the church building or pay the congregation $35,000 for relocation; the congregation chose the latter. The agreement was made in 1917, but no action was taken until 1922. Walter Kidde and Company were hired to move the church on rollers at a cost of $87,000. Beginning in February 1924 and continuing until late that year, the current church was moved south. The 1907 manse was also relocated to Seabury Street and 54th Avenue, behind the church building. The steeple was taken down and the stones stored for later reassembly, though this never happened. The Christian Endeavor building was demolished because the congregation hoped to build a larger social hall. In 1930, the church's chapel was condemned for the construction of the Independent Subway System's Queens Boulevard Line, whose Grand Avenue‚ÄìNewtown station contained an entrance directly outside the church. The church hired Meyer & Mathieu to design a new parish house, which was built by Charles R. Krieg Inc. in 1931 at a cost of $75,000. The city was to compensate the church for the acquisition, but the compensation was delayed. Instead, the church paid for the parish house by taking out a $60,000 mortgage in 1930; the mortgage was paid off five years later when the city compensated the church. At the time, it was the church's only debt in its 283-year history, and the church celebrated by burning the mortgage papers. Commercial developers offered the church a $1,000,000 offer for its building in 1951, but the offer was rejected. The following year, U.S. president Harry S. Truman sent a message to the church for its 300th anniversary. The old church cemetery's land was sold in 1958; the corpses were disinterred and moved to the Cemetery of the Evergreens. By the early 1980s, Elmhurst was becoming increasingly populated by immigrants, and the First Presbyterian Church of Newtown had parishioners who had immigrated from 40 countries. Despite this, the church's then-pastor, the Rev. Charles Sorg, continued to conduct services entirely in English, saying that this would unite immigrants with a single language and \\"enable people to accommodate themselves into the American scene\\". To celebrate the church's 350th anniversary in 2003, the congregation planted two trees of Newtown Pippins, a type of apple that had first been grown in a nearby orchard in the 17th or 18th century. The church was deemed eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2012, and was listed on the NRHP the next year. Design The church complex is oriented northeast to southwest along the southeastern side of 54th Avenue between Seabury Street and Queens Boulevard. The main facade of the church faces Queens Boulevard to the northeast, outside the entrance to the New York City Subway's Grand Avenue‚ÄìNewtown station. The manse, a -story frame residence, faces Seabury Street to the southwest. A parish hall is at the church's rear, facing southwest. =Church= The present church building was designed by Frank A. Collins and built in 1895. It was intended as a replica of Cherry Valley, New York's English Gothic style Presbyterian Church. The church building is a stone structure measuring . It has a facade of gray granite with specks of ashlar, as well as brick. There are quoins made of brownstone on all of the building's corners, as well as a string course between the windows of the northwestern facade (which faces 54th Avenue).  Exterior  The main entrance contains a central arched doorway. Brownstone jambs on either side of the door rise to a pointed brownstone pediment. On this surround are the words \\"Payntar Memorial\\", after John Goldsmith Payntar. The church building has stained glass windows designed by the partnership of Benjamin Sellers and William J. Ashley, although a single window was commissioned from A. Passage. The main facade facing Queens Boulevard shows the Ascension of Jesus, with a smaller window to either side. The northwestern elevation contains windows that look into the aisle of the nave, as well as the clerestory windows above them. There are five bays; each of these bays has one pointed arch on the lower section of the facade, which are all surrounded with brownstone, and three windows on the clerestory level. A pointed arch with a recessed wooden door is on the left (northern) side. The southeastern elevation is similar to the northeastern one, except that the right (northern) side has a concrete facade, and the left (southern) side contains sections of brick. The southwestern elevation is made of brick and has one arched window to the left and one door to the right. The southern corner of the church building is attached to the parish hall. Projecting from the eastern corner of the church is a square tower high and wide. It contains buttresses with brownstone quoins at each corner. The tower has a belfry with a bell made by Gerit Bakker in the Netherlands in 1788. Originally the church building had a \\"great stone\\" spire reaching . However, it was disassembled when the church was moved in 1924.  Interior  Inside, the walls are made of plaster with wooden wainscoting and trusses, while the floors are made of wood. A narthex at the northeast side of the building separates the main entrance from the nave. A gallery balcony runs along the front (northeast side) of the nave. The narthex and nave are separated by three doorways: a double door to the nave's center aisle and a single door to each of the two side aisles in the nave. A staircase on the building's northern corner connects to the gallery, and another on the eastern corner leads to the gallery and belfry. At the gallery, there are two doors leading to the balcony, where there are three full-width rows of pews. Within a recess are three smaller rows, illuminated by the three stained-glass windows along the main facade. A rectangular nave takes up much of the space in the church building. The nave contains 16 rows of pews, split by a center aisle. There is a chancel and choir loft in the back (southwest side) of the nave. This chancel includes a wooden platform with a wooden altar, screen, four chairs, and lectern. A marble baptismal font and wooden pulpit are also in the chancel. The interior also contains a choir room in the basement. It was built with steam and gas service, an innovation when the current church was erected. The church has two organs: one built by Ernest M. Skinner in 1907 and another built by the Wicks Organ Company in 1940. =Manse= Manse, as seen from Seabury Street The manse, which dates from 1907, is a nine-room, -story L-shaped house along Seabury Street to the southwest, near the corner with 54th Avenue. It serves as the pastor's residence. As originally built, the manse had a main entrance with Ionic-style pilasters and a portico with a pediment. A porch with columns ran around the manse, and there was a keystone above the rounded dormer window on the main facade. The porch was removed sometime between 1923 and 1925. The facade is clad with green wooden siding with several windows on all four sides; the northeast and southwest elevations contain double- and triple-width windows, while the northwest and southeast elevations contain only single-width windows. The northeast elevation contains a small foyer. It is topped by a hip roof, with a brick chimney above the center and a dormer window projecting above the second floor on the southwest and southeast sides. The interior has wood trimmings and neoclassical decorative detail. There is a vestibule inside the main entrance, as well as a hallway lit by a chandelier. Stairs go to the second floor and the basement. The first floor has a central hall that leads to a kitchen, three rooms with fireplaces, and a restroom; most of the flooring is made of parquet wood. The second floor has several closets, a pastor's office, two other rooms, and a restroom. Stairs lead to the attic, which contains the dormer windows on the southwest and southeast elevations. =Parish house= Parish house The parish house, also called the social hall, is a two-story Collegiate Gothic-style building erected in 1931 by Charles R. Krieg Inc. It is connected to the southwestern facade of the church and faces southwest toward Seabury Street. The parish house has a gable roof made of slate, a steel-and-concrete frame, and a brick facade above a stone base. The main double door on Seabury Street has a stone surround and an inscription identifying it as the Church House. The facade's decorative details include quoins made of limestone, surrounds around the door and window openings, and casement windows. The southeastern elevation has seven bays, while the northwestern elevation has a door and four bays; these bays are separated by brick buttresses capped with stone. The visible portion of the northeastern elevation is clad with brick. A vestibule, accessed from the main entrance, connects to the parish house's upper story. The upper floor contains a communal space with stage and basketball court, which could be used as an auditorium or a gymnasium, and there is a kitchen beside the stage. The lower story has six classrooms, a kitchen, a \\"church parlor\\" with a fireplace and beamed ceiling, locker rooms, and restrooms. These facilities are used for clubs, Sunday school classes, and other activities at the church.

It was designed by Melrose & Fenwick and built in 1921 by Melrose & Fenwick. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Finch Hatton War Memorial was erected on 19 November 1921, and it is possible that it may never have been officially unveiled. It was erected at a cost of which was paid for by public subscription. The stone memorial was designed and produced by Melrose and Fenwick of Mackay and honours the 16 local men who fell in the First World War. Later additions honour the 7 who fell in the Second World War. The erection of the memorial was made possible through the combined efforts of two towns, Finch Hatton and Netherdale. The initial development of Finch Hatton was in the mid 1900s as the terminus of the Pioneer Valley railway line. The town further developed when the Cattle Creek sugar mill opened in 1906. A supporting infrastructure of schools, theatres and halls was established, as well as residences for both workers and management. The town became the main centre of the Pioneer Valley hinterland and by the 1920s was the third largest township (after Mackay and Sarina) in the region. Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60 000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word \\"cenotaph\\", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means \\"empty tomb\\". Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they paid the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the soldier statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects. Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair. Although there are many different types of memorials in Queensland, the digger statue is the most common. It was the most popular choice of communities responsible for erecting the memorials, embodying the Anzac spirit and representing the qualities of the ideal Australian: loyalty, courage, youth, innocence and masculinity. The digger was a phenomenon peculiar to Queensland, perhaps due to the fact that other states had followed Britain's lead and established Advisory Boards made up of architects and artists, prior to the erection of war memorials. The digger statue was not highly regarded by artists and architects who were involved in the design of relatively few Queensland memorials. Most statues were constructed by local masonry firms, although some were by artists or imported. Melrose and Fenwick the makers of the Finch Hatton memorial, were a monumental masonry firm established in Townsville in . They were a large firm with branches throughout Northern Queensland. They enjoyed continued success into the late 20th century, only going out of business in the early 1980s. The pedestal of this monument is of an unusually ornate style. The impetus for the design is not known; however it is probably a result of regional tastes and preferences.  Description  The First World War Memorial is situated in Finch Hatton facing the Mackay-Eungella Road. The memorial rises to a height of and comprises a pedestal surmounted by a digger statue. The sandstone memorial sits on a base step with picked stone faces, margined and chiselled. Surmounting this are two larger steps with chamfered corners. The lower of these two steps has a diaper pattern, margined and chiselled on all faces. The upper step is smooth faced and is capped with cyma recta mouldings. The pedestal rises from this base and is in two parts. The lower part consists of a recessed square section with small barley twist columns at each corner. The square section continues above a shallow cornice and is capped by a series of curvilinear inverted steps. Surmounting this is a second section, smooth-faced with recessed panels on each face and stop-chamfers to each corner. This is capped by a further series of inverted steps which are arched over recessed panels. Standing on a small block above this is the digger statue. The soldier statue stands with his head bowed and hands crossed over a rifle which is in the reversed position. A tree stump is located behind the statue for support.  Heritage listing  Finch Hatton War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. Erected in 1921, the memorial at Finch Hatton demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through the use of appropriate materials and design elements. As a digger statue it is representative of the most popular form of memorial in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. This particular memorial is of aesthetic significance for its high level of workmanship and design. The pedestal displays a pattern and design which is uncommon in war memorials in Queensland. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a combined effort of two towns, it has a strong association with the communities of both as evidence of the impact of a major historic event. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It also has special associations with monumental masons Melrose and Fenwick as an example of their work.

Written by Alan Fennell and directed by Desmond Saunders, it was first broadcast on ATV Midlands on 2 December 1965. Set in the 2060s, the series follows the exploits of International Rescue, an organisation that uses technologically-advanced rescue vehicles to save human life. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, founder of International Rescue, and his five adult sons, who pilot the organisation's main vehicles: the Thunderbird machines. In \\"The Uninvited\\", Thunderbird 1 crashes in the Sahara Desert after being shot down by three unidentified aircraft. Two archaeologists rescue Scott, but one good turn deserves another, and later on, Scott finds himself rushing back to the desert when the pair become entombed in the lost pyramid of Khamandides. Plot Scott Tracy (voiced by Shane Rimmer) is returning to Tracy Island in Thunderbird 1 when he is suddenly attacked by a group of unidentified fighters. Thunderbird 1 is damaged and crash-lands in the Sahara. On Tracy Island, Jeff (voiced by Peter Dyneley) dispatches Virgil, Brains and Tin-Tin (voiced by David Holliday, David Graham and Christine Finn) in Thunderbird 2 to rescue Scott. In the desert, archaeologists Wilson and Lindsey are returning to their base camp after a fruitless expedition when they come across the shot-down Thunderbird 1. Stopping their all-terrain truck and supply trailer, they treat Scott's injuries until Thunderbird 2 arrives. Later, with Scott convalescent and Thunderbird 1 repaired by Brains, Wilson and Lindsey reveal that they were searching for the lost pyramid of Pharaoh Khamandides. The International Rescue team head back to Tracy Island the next day. Wilson and Lindsey resume their journey, but frustration gets the better of Wilson. Driving too fast, he causes the coupling between the truck and the trailer to snap. The trailer rolls down a slope and explodes, destroying nearly all of the men's food, water and fuel and damaging their radio. They use the truck's remaining fuel to travel to a waterhole 40 miles away but arrive to find it bone-dry. As a last, desperate resort, the men use the failing radio to send out a distress call to International Rescue. On Thunderbird 5, Alan Tracy (voiced by Matt Zimmerman) has just relieved John (voiced by Ray Barrett) as space monitor when he picks up Wilson and Lindsey's faint transmission. Jeff dispatches Scott in Thunderbird 1 to find and rescue the men. In the desert, Lindsey spots a mysterious object on the horizon ‚Äì the lost pyramid of Khamandides. Using the last of their fuel, the men drive up to the pyramid. As Lindsey deciphers hieroglyphs on the side ‚Äì hailing Khamandides as \\"Lord of the Eternal Fountain\\" ‚Äì a block rises up to form an entrance to the interior. The men proceed but find themselves entombed when the block falls back into place. Deeper inside, they find mounds of treasure. They also discover that the Eternal Fountain is real and drink from it. Scott arrives at the pyramid and follows Wilson and Lindsey through the one-way door. Lindsey, traumatised by his recent experiences, accuses of Scott of trying to steal his new-found riches and pulls a gun on him. A shootout between Lindsey and Scott ensues. Scott loses his gun but is saved by the arrival of two armed men, who blast Lindsey's gun out of his hand, knocking him out. The strangers conduct Scott, Wilson and the unconscious Lindsey to the pyramid's control centre in a monorail car. This journey takes them over a refinery where men in gas masks are using a highly toxic and explosive gas to refuel fighters identical to those that shot down Scott. Jeff is concerned by Scott's lack of contact and dispatches Virgil and Gordon (voiced by David Graham) in Thunderbird 2 to investigate. Seeing Thunderbird 2s arrival, the pyramid's inhabitants prepare to attack it with ground-to-air missiles, but before these are launched Wilson punches one of the guards to the floor and Scott, having taken back his gun, shoots several others. A stray bullet hits a control panel, causing the missiles to launch but detonate harmlessly in mid-air. Scott and Wilson take the monorail back to the entrance, with Scott shooting at the refinery workers as they go. The gas is inadvertently released into the refinery, starting a series of explosions. Scott, Wilson and Lindsey, who has just regained consciousness, reach the entrance to find it open and quickly lift off in Thunderbird 1. Thunderbird 1 and Thunderbird 2 clear the area just before the final explosion destroys the pyramid. Production \\"The Uninvited\\" was the fifth episode of Thunderbirds to be produced. Originally filmed in late 1964 as a 25-minute episode, in January the following year it was extended to 50 minutes to satisfy AP Films' sponsor Lew Grade, who had been impressed with the pilot episode and ordered that all episodes of Thunderbirds be re-written to fill a one-hour timeslot. The additional material for \\"The Uninvited\\", which had originally been titled \\"Desert of Danger\\", consists of the shoot- down of Thunderbird 1, the rescue of Scott and the character's subsequent recovery on Tracy Island. The filming of these new scenes coincided with the production of \\"Desperate Intruder\\" and \\"30 Minutes After Noon\\". Actor Matt Zimmerman, who voiced Lindsey, fondly remembers the dialogue recording for this episode: \\"I had to yell and scream, 'Hahaha! You won't take me alive, Tracy!' We had a lot of fun doing that one.\\"Bentley 2005, p. 19. Although the script refers to the pyramid tribe as \\"the Zombites\\", they remain unnamed in the episode itself. The Zombite fighter aircraft are re-dressed versions of the WASP fighters that appear in Stingray.Bentley 2005, p. 68. This episode marks the first appearance of Grandma Tracy. The model of Wilson and Lindsey's desert truck would later appear in \\"The Mighty Atom\\", \\"Martian Invasion\\" and \\"Cry Wolf\\". The Thunderbird 3 launch sequence is recycled from \\"Sun Probe\\". Broadcast and reception First broadcast on 2 December 1965, \\"The Uninvited\\" was transmitted as the tenth episode of Thunderbirds for both the series' original run on Associated Television and the majority of 1960s repeat runs. A number of scenes were omitted from the two-part version that was shown in some UK regions. =Critical response= Series co-creator Sylvia Anderson describes \\"The Uninvited\\" as \\"good fun but a little too adventurous for our puppet cast\\", though she praises the episode's special effects. Writing for Panini UK, Chris Bentley comments positively on \\"The Uninvited\\", stating that it \\"entertainingly re-shapes the series' format, illustrating the potentially wide variety of stories that can be told within the International Rescue framework.\\" He also commends the episode's use of action. Marcus Hearn, author of Thunderbirds: The Vault, has mixed views on the episode. He describes the final battle with the Zombites as being \\"staged in the explosive style of the 1960s James Bond films\\" but questions Lindsey's fit of homicidal rage against Scott, which he considers to be \\"out of character\\". Hearn also criticises the Zombites as villains, noting that their hostility and motives for living underground are never explained. He suggests that the plot concerning the quest for a lost pyramid would not have looked out of place in an episode of Stingray. Tom Fox of Starburst magazine gives \\"The Uninvited\\" a rating of five out of five, calling it a \\"quality episode\\". He praises the setting as well as the Zombites, whom he describes as \\"hilarious\\" and \\"hardly your average bunch of pyramid-dwelling undead\\". In other media A comic strip adaptation of \\"The Uninvited\\" was serialised in issues 12 to 14 of Thunderbirds: The Comic in 1992. It was reprinted in the comic album Thunderbirds: Shock Wave later that year. \\"The Uninvited\\" was included in the 2004 DVD release The Best of Thunderbirds ‚Äì The Favorite Episodes.

It was initially built but was substantially rebuilt in 1918 . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 January 1997.  History  The association of the South Sea Island community with this site began in 1892 when the Colonial Sugar Refining Company donated land from their Homebush holding for a community meeting house. The Pioneer Valley lay within the southern section of the Kennedy land district. While pastoral land in the Leichhdart and Port Curtis districts was opened for settlement in the early 1850s, the Kennedy was not opened for selection until November 1859. The first settlers established large runs across the entire Pioneer Valley. By the late 1860s pastoral holdings dominated the district although some land was utilised for agriculture around the township of Mackay. Twenty years later agriculture, particularly sugar growing, had superseded pastoralism in the valley. Pastoralism declined because sheep were affected by footrot and spear grass and there were no local markets for cattle. Several of the early settlers, struggling to maintain their pastoral holdings, experimented with sugar cane on the rich soil of the valley. The burgeoning sugar cane industry was greatly assisted by the opening of markets in Europe after sugar supplies were cut during the American Civil War. A further impetus was the establishment of steam powered mills in the district in 1868. By 1878 was under cane in the valley. Indentured Melanesian labour was used to run the plantations and mills. Over 62,000 Pacific Islanders were contracted as indentured labourers in Queensland between 1863 and 1904. The everyday lives of these indentured labourers was controlled by Europeans, particularly in the area of education. South Sea Islanders mostly received their education through the Mission School System, developed by Christian churches throughout the district. These mission schools, established away from the parent church, taught Christianity using full time missionary and Melanesian lay teachers. The school combined religious education with general education. Older people attended Sunday services, baptisms and other church services and were taught to read and write at night classes. The Homebush Mission Hall was established by the Presbyterian Church on land donated by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company at Homebush. The building, which had been constructed of corrugated iron and timber stumps, supplied by the trustees, looked on to the mill road, which ran along the tramline to the combined road and tramline bridge over Sandy Creek. The Mission Hall officially came under the trusteeship of Frederick Culverhouse, a butcher of Sandy Creek near Homebush, of Neil Petersen, a farmer of \\"Marseille\\" (sic), Homebush and Frank James Stevens, a farmer of \\"Colston Vale,\\" Homebush on 28 June 1892. Trusteeship of the hall did not pass to the South Sea Islander community until 1992. An anti-Asian/Islander immigration movement, which had its foundations in the mining fields of southern Australia in the 1850s, had grown in strength and general acceptance by the late nineteenth century. The introduction of various pieces of legislation made the White Australia Policy a fact in law by the beginning of the twentieth century. Specific legislation in 1901 and 1903 restricted the immigration of labourers from the Pacific Islands. A Queensland royal commission in April, 1906 reported on the number of South Sea Islanders to be deported by the end of 1906, while, at the same time, amendments were made to the Federal Pacific Islander Labourers Act to discontinue further immigration from the islands of the Pacific. In North Queensland, South Sea Islander political activists formed the Pacific Islanders Association in May 1901 to protest against the deportation of members of the community. Deportation meant that people who had lived in Australia for many years would be sent back to their country of birth leaving family behind. The Pacific Islanders Association was active for several years with meetings and protest gatherings held in locations such as the Homebush Mission Hall. In the 1918 Mackay cyclone the Mission Hall was severely damaged, almost to the point of total demolition, and was later rebuilt, to face the Homebush Road, with mostly original material and with donations from trustees, Stevens and Petersen, and with a small sum from the Homebush Mill. For the next five decades the Mission Hall served the local community as a place of worship, social gatherings, weddings, Sunday school, picnics, meetings and other entertainment. The regularity of church, Sunday school and social gatherings decreased over the years, as the local population changed. By the 1970s the hall was no longer in use, and had become dilapidated. In recent years the hall has again become a focus for the local South Sea Island community and is a part of their cultural revival. Many of these people received Sunday schooling there, looking upon the building with great affection and pride. On 13 January 1992, the hall came under the trusteeship of the Australian South Sea Islander United Council. One of the trustees, Cristine Andrew, has been instrumental in having the building conserved.  Description  Side view, 2005 The Homebush Mission Hall is a single-storey building of timber and corrugated iron, located a few kilometres to the east of the village of Homebush, about south of Mackay. It is situated on the western fringe of a small cluster of cottages and surrounded by canefields. Triangular in shape, the site fronts the Homebush-Eton Road along its northern boundary, and has a cane tram line running parallel to its diagonal boundary to the south-east. The hall is nestled towards the rear corner of the site, and faces north-east. The site is flat and grassed, with a scattering of mature eucalypts and new plantings, and marked by a fence of bush timber posts. The building is a simple rectangular form (about ), with a projecting entry porch. The gabled roof is corrugated iron, with a lean-to roof over the porch. The walls to the body of the hall are also clad in corrugated iron, and punctuated by four tall, narrow windows to each side. These four-pane windows are horizontally pivoting, and retain some of their early hardware. Centred within the gable at each end is a panel of timber louvres to vent the roof space. The hall is low-set, with timber stumps to the perimeter, and steel posts to the remainder. There are timber steps to the porch and the rear door. The entry porch is open, and clad in weatherboards and timber lattice. In the wall sheeting behind the porch is a V-shaped cut, being evidence an earlier porch had a gabled form. There are also two windows, matching those of the sides, to the front wall, one each side of the double entry doors. The interior is a single room, with the timber wall and roof framing exposed. The floor is of narrow (about ) hardwood boards. The rear door is boarded and braced, and retains some original hardware. To the far end is a raised timber platform, used as the sanctuary for the church services. Beside the building is a corrugated steel water tank and timber stand. Also on the site is a empty outside \\"thunderbox\\" toilet (reputedly from the Sarina Mission), some log seats and a corrugated steel toilet block.  Heritage listing  Homebush Mission Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 January 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Homebush Mission Hall is an important historical feature in the development, both socially and economically, of the North Queensland region through its strong association with the South Sea Islander labour force which was instrumental in the establishment of the sugar cane industry, particularly in the Mackay District. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although similar examples were once common through the region, it is now a rare example of community meeting place of simple vernacular construction methods using timber and corrugated iron. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is also recognised by the broader community for its landmark and rude picturesque qualities. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Mission Hall is strongly associated with the Islander community as a meeting place for religious, social, cultural, educational and community activities for over a century and particularly as a centre for protest meetings against deportation in the first decade of this century. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The hall continues to be an important part of Islander community life and the recent major conservation works on the hall is evidence of the continuing significance of this building to the South Sea Islander community of the region.

Wind power in Uruguay generates a rapidly growing proportion of the country's electricity mix. Overall, the majority of Uruguayan electricity generation is derived from hydroelectric sources. In 2016, the country‚Äôs total installed wind power capacity surpassed 1,000 MW. As of 2016, this figure comprised 17 percent of the country‚Äôs overall electricity generation, marking a sudden increase in the overall share from the 2 percent all alternative renewable energy sources made up in 2012. In July 2018 UTE, the country's power plants and transmission administrator, announced that record electricity demand was being met entirely by renewable sources, of which wind power comprised 34 percent. The national government has supported this nascent but fast-moving wind power transformation by providing a policy environment of incentives like feed-in tariffs and utility-scale bidding. The former helped incentivize small-scale installations, while the latter enabled large-scale projects.  Background  In 2008, the Uruguayan government set a target of 15% joint participation in the national electricity grid by a number of alternative renewable sources, namely biomass, wind power, and mini-hydro. Wind power alone far surpassed that proportion in the several years following the setting of that goal. Electricity generation auctions, first put forward in 2006, have been a primary vehicle for larger-scale deployment of mini-hydro and wind power deployment over the past decade. Some analysts have credited Uruguay's ability to leverage UNDP funding to create reliable policy frameworks that would eventually encourage greater standalone private investment in the sector.  Wind power in regional electricity trade  Its proximity to Argentina and Brazil make for relatively easy electricity trade between the countries, and in 2016 Uruguay began exporting excess wind power generation to neighboring Argentina. The two countries' state-operated utilities had previously sold electricity bilaterally, but the 2016 wind power sales marked the first Uruguayan-Argentine electricity trade between private companies. Meanwhile, along the Uruguayan border with Brazil, wind power projects are being approached through a binational partnership with Brazilian utility Eletrobras.

The large sanctuary can accommodate more than 600 people. Parish history Nave and altar Ceiling detail In 1857 there were a few scattered Catholic families in and around the village of Austin. On November 2, 1857, Father Michael Prendergast of Winona visited settlers in the Austin area and offered them Mass at the home of Thomas Gibson. In May of the following year he repeated his visit and again in November 1860. In 1861, Austin was transferred to the jurisdiction of the pastor of Faribault. Fr. George Keller then paid periodical and regular visits to Austin and the work of organization took definite form. Under this supervision the building of the first church of the Austin mission was begun in 1863. St. Augustine's Parish was officially established in 1866, when the first church building was completed. Fr. John McDermott, the first resident pastor, arrived in June 1867. In June 1868, the Most Rev. Thomas Grace, Bishop of St. Paul, visited the parish, dedicated the new church (initially known as St. Austin's), and administered the sacrament of Confirmation to a group of children and adults. The Church of St. Augustine that stands today was erected to near completion under the supervision of Fr. Daniel O'Sullivan. Bishop Joseph Cotter officiated at the laying of the cornerstone on April 24, 1894. Fr. O'Sullivan died on June 21, 1896, and the church was completed under the direction of his successor, Fr.

It continued to grow and function successfully, with enrollment of 120 students in 1890. However, the school was closed in 1893 due to the financial burden involved in constructing the new church. In 1909 during the pastorate of Fr. Devlin, the Columbus school, a three-story brick building, was erected to meet the needs of the congregation and was staffed by the Sisters of St. Francis of Rochester. In the 1920s St. Augustine High School was added to the parish plant. St. Augustine High School was expanded in 1951 and renamed Pacelli High School in 1957 in honor of Pope Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli. Also in 1957, the Columbus school was torn down and St. Augustine's Elementary School constructed in its place.

Membership was estimated to be about 10,000 persons, including many former military officers. Juvenile supporters could join the Young Vikings (Jungwiking) youth wing. Leaders of the group included former Marinebrigade Ehrhardt founder Hermann Ehrhardt and his deputy, Commander Eberhard Kautter. Many leaders of other banned or controversial right-wing organizations used membership in the Viking League as a way of keeping continuity for their causes. For example, this included later Nazi Reich Health Leader Leonardo Conti, who had founded the anti-semitic newspaper Kampfbund in 1918. The young Horst Wessel joined the group in late 1923. On 9 January 1924 a group of about 20 members of the Viking League lead by Edgar Julius Jung were responsible for the murder of the Pfalz separatist Heinz- Orbis. The stated aim of the League was the establishment of a new German military dictatorship and modification of the Treaty of Versailles by armed means. This included targeted provocation intended to incite workers to take action and provide the pretext for a coup. When these preparations became known to the federal government in 1926, the Viking League was banned in Prussia and other areas. After the dissolution of the League at the end of April 1928, many Viking League members continued their activities in related organizations such as Der Stahlhelm or the Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA).

It was aimed at eradicating communist guerrilla forces operating in zones occupied by the United Nations forces. The operation involved two Korean Army divisions, the Capital Division and the 8th Division, several regiments of the Korean National Police, a ROKAF squadron of Mustang fighter-bombers, and about sixty United States experts. The operation was under the command of General Paik Sun Yup. The operation's particular priority was the mountainous area of Jirisan. Before the operation, the guerrillas were allegedly responsible for harassing nearly a third of UN forces and conducting regular attacks on roads and railways used by them. After the operation, the guerrilla forces were greatly weakened, although a resurgence remained a threat until the end of the war. Background In 1951, a large number of communist guerrilla groups, ranging in size from a few hundred to several thousand, were operating in territory supposedly controlled by UN forces and were attacking roads and railways, sniping at UN forces, and raising funds from local inhabitants. These guerrilla bands were particularly active in the Jirisan mountains, although sniping and guerrilla activity had been reported even in the capital, Seoul. Local anti-communist militias formed to fight back, sometimes engaging in savage reprisals against villages deemed to be supporting the guerrillas. Outcome After the operation, communist guerrilla forces were greatly weakened, although thousands of Republic of Korea police had to remain in the area, supported by up to 11,000 local militia known as the Young Volunteers, in order to prevent the resurgence of the remaining guerrilla forces, who may have numbered about 3,000. According to Republic of Korea records, 5,800 guerrilla fighters were killed and 5,700 were captured. U.S. records claim 9,000 guerrillas were killed, while some sources estimate as many as 10,000.

Biography Silahdar was from Hama in central Syria, but his government career was made in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. He replaced Sulayman Pasha al-Adil as governor of Damascus and his appointment marked the permanent end of a trend whereby local rulers or non-local rulers who made their careers in Syria, such as the al-Azm family or Jazzar Pasha and his mamluk heirs in Acre, were appointed to the governorship.Douwes 2000, p. 58. During his first days as governor, Silahdar faced a rebellion by the jannisary commander of the Citadel of Damascus, Ali Agha al-Baghdadi, who refused to accept Silahdar's authority. After a siege of several days, Ali Agha surrendered, was executed and the remaining rebellious jannisaries were allowed to leave the city unharmed.Douwes 2000, p. 108. In 1813, Silahdar commissioned the Kurdish Dalat cavalry commander of Hama, Mullah Isma'il, to oversee that year's tax collection tour in the province.Douwes 2000, p. 117.

A plant press is a set of equipment used by botanists to flatten and dry field samples so that they can be easily stored. A professional plant press is made to the standard maximum size for biological specimens to be filed in a particular herbarium. A flower press is a similar device of no standard size that is used to make flat dried flowers for pressed flower craft. Specimens prepared in a plant press are later glued to archival-quality card stock with their labels, and are filed in a herbarium. Labels are made with archival ink (or pencil) and paper, and attached with archival-quality glue. Construction Filled plant presses arranged on a gas-fired heater, with air circulation upwards through the layers A modern plant press consists of two strong outer boards with straps that can be tightened around them to exert pressure. Between the boards, fresh plant samples are placed, carefully labelled, between layers of paper. Further layers of absorbent paper and corrugated cardboard are usually added to help to dry the samples as quickly as possible, which prevents decay and improves colour retention. Layers of a sponge material can be used in order to prevent squashing parts of the specimens, such as fruit. Older plant presses and some modern flower presses have screws to supply the pressure, which often limits the thickness of the stack of samples that can be put into one press. History Luca Ghini (1490‚Äî1556) Italian physician and botanist, created the first recorded herbarium, and is considered the first person to have used drying under pressure to prepare a plant collection. William Withering English botanist, geologist, chemist and physician wrote popular books on British botany, and by describing the screw-down plant press (and the vasculum) he brought it to the attention of amateur naturalists in Britain around 1771.

The bill authorizes $1.1 trillion in spending, as well as $700 billion in tax breaks. The bill provides funding to the federal government through September 30, 2016. History The bill began as a $78 billion spending bill for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, one of the twelve subcommittees of the US Senate Committee on Appropriations. The bill first passed the US House of Representatives on April 30, 2015, by a vote of 255-163, largely along party lines. President Obama threatened to veto the legislation as written, in line with his earlier statements opposing spending bills not preventing the automatic spending cuts due to budget sequestration. The bill remained in the US Senate for several months, deliberately stalled by Senate Democrats. The Senate voted on the bill on November 10, 2015, passing it unanimously, 93-0. Facing a possible government shutdown on September 30, 2015 (the end of fiscal year 2015), Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2016 hours before the deadline, funding the government until December 11. As the new December 11 deadline approached, Congress actively negotiated a wider omnibus bill built on top of the original bill. Congress passed two additional temporary extensions, pushing the deadline back to December 16, and then to December 22. The bill entered into law on December 18, 2015. The bill ended up largely as a compromise between centrist Republicans and moderate Democrats; the scope of the bill's spending was heavily criticized by the conservative wing of the Republican Party. Provisions The bill provides general spending for most of the US federal government. The bill included a larger than expected $19.3 billion in funding for NASA. Tax cuts included delaying implementation of taxes on premium health care plans, as well as upcoming taxes on medical devices. Unrelated policy riders included ending a 40-year- old ban on US exports of crude oil. The bill also included the provisions of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, information sharing cyber-security legislation.

The walk has been devised so that it can be walked in its entirety or as thirteen smaller walks. It has been described as having sufficient places of worship on the route for it to be used as a walk of pilgrimage. History The Wilberforce Way was devised as a tribute to mark the bicentenary of the abolition of the British Transatlantic Slave Trade in the 1807 Act of Parliament introduced by Hull born William Wilberforce. The route was first published in 2007 and written by John Eckersley. The route uses waymarkers that have the name with a picture of a broken chain on a black and white disc. Route This section is sourced from UK GPS routes and Ordnance Survey Landranger Maps. =Hull to Beverley= The route starts at The Deep in the Old Harbour district of Hull. It crosses the River Hull on the nearby footbridge and goes along the riverside path to the North Bridge where it re-crosses the river and joins the cycle path on Spive Street and heads north as far as Chamberlain Road. Here the path returns to the riverside and follows it all the way to Skidby Landing where it heads inland and joins the Beverley Road out of the city boundary. At Thearne the path turns to follow the Beverley and Barmston Drain, a small waterway, as far as Figham before returning to the main road. In Beverley, the path passes the Minster and St Mary's Church. It winds it way through the outskirts to join the Hudson Way, a disused rail trail along the former York to Beverley Line, close to the A1035. In Beverley the route crosses or follows the following Hiking Routes: Minster Way, Haunted Way, East Riding Heritage Way and Hutton Hike. =Beverley to Market Weighton= The Way diverts off the Hudson Way at Cherry Burton, passing the Church of St Michael and All Angels. It exits the village via Etton Road towards Etton crossing the old railway bridge over the Hudson Way before rejoining the disused railway line. The Way diverts along the Yorkshire Wolds Way into the village of Goodmanham and follows it into Market Weighton. In the town centre the route swings around All Saints Church before heading north towards the A614. =Market Weighton to Pocklington= The Way crosses the A164 and into the village of Londesborough, passing All Saints Church. It then passes through the hamlets of Nunburnholme and Kilnwick Percy before joining the Chalkland Way and heading east into Pocklington. The town is home to Pocklington School that William Wilberforce attended from 1771-76. The route heads south out of the town after the Church of All Saints. =Pocklington to York= The route follows the Pocklington Canal as far as the point it crosses the B1228 at which point it joins the road through Sutton-Upon-Derwent. The route crosses the River Derwent just outside Elvington, but skirts the village rather going through it as it merges with the Jorvic Way as far as Wheldrake. The route heads north out of the village, crossing over the A64 and into the Heslington suburb of York at the University. The route then heads west across Walmgate Stray and the A19 (Fulford Road) to the east bank of the River Ouse. The final leg along the river ends at Lendal Bridge where it turns towards its terminus at York Minster. Images File:The Deep. Hull.jpgThe Deep.

View of Kavousi Kastro looking east from the Institute for Aegean Prehistory Study Center for East Crete in Pacheia Ammos (2014). The location of the archaeological site is indicated by a circle; the location of Kavousi Vronda is indicated by a star.Situated on a steep and rocky peak at an elevation of 713 m above sea level in the northern foothills of the Thripti Mountains, the site overlooks the Gulf of Mirabello and the northern Isthmus of Ierapetra. ‚ÄúKastro‚Äù (‚ÄúCitadel‚Äú or ‚ÄúCastle‚Äù) is a local toponym; the ancient name of the site is unknown. The Kastro is best known as a defensible ‚Äúrefuge‚Äù settlement of the ‚ÄúGreek Dark Ages‚Äù, inhabited from the early 12th to the mid-7th centuries BCE. Most of the visible architectural remains on the site belong to the Late Geometric‚ÄìEarly Orientalizing phases of occupation (8th to 7th centuries BCE). History of the site View of Kavousi Kastro and Kavousi Vronda, looking south-southwest from the archaeological site of Azoria (2012). Investigations by the Kavousi Project have demonstrated that a settlement on the Kastro was occupied continuously from its foundation early in the Late Minoan IIIC period (12th century BCE), through the Protogeometric (10th century BCE), Geometric (9th-8th centuries BCE) and Orientalizing (7th century BCE) periods, after which the site was abandoned.Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1992; Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1995; Coulson, Haggis, Mook, and Tobin 1997; Mook and Coulson 1997; Coulson 1998; Mook 1998; Mook 2011. Its long sequence of continuous occupation and stratified remains of architecture, floor surfaces, fills, and ceramic deposits provide important insights into domestic activities, architecture, and social organization of a community throughout the entire Early Iron Age, but before the transition to larger urban centers in the Archaic period (6th century BCE), such as at nearby Azoria. Archaeological research View of Kavousi Kastro, looking east from the summit of Kavousi Vronda (2002). The site was briefly explored in 1900 by the American archaeologist Harriet Boyd [Hawes], who discovered 13 rooms of what she thought was the house of ‚Äúan early chieftain‚Äù, but now interpreted as multiple, separate house complexes spread across several terraces.Boyd 1901; Coulson 1998. The Kavousi Project, directed by Geraldine C. Gesell (University of Tennessee), Leslie Preston Day (College of Wooster; later, Wabash College), and William D.E. Coulson (University of Minnesota; later, American School of Classical Studies at Athens), cleaned the site in 1982 in preparation for balloon photography for The Aerial Atlas of Ancient Crete.Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1985; Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1992, figs. 16.2‚Äì4. Additional surveying of the site in 1983 provided positive indications that the settlement was much more extensive than previously thought. Full-scale excavations under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the 24th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of the Greek Archaeological Service, and with permission from the Greek Ministry of Culture, were conducted at both Kavousi Kastro and Kavousi Vronda from 1987‚Äì1990 and in 1992, followed by site conservation from 1993 to 1996, and study from 1990 to 2003.Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1988; Gesell, Coulson, and Day 1991, Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1995; Coulson, Haggis, Mook, and Tobin 1997.

In World War I Mitsui fought at the Battle of Vimy Ridge and led 35 Japanese Canadians in the Battle of Hill 70. He attained the rank of sergeant and was awarded the British War Medal, Military Medal, and Victory Medal. Following the war, he served as president of British Columbia Branch No. 9 of the Royal Canadian Legion and pressed for the rights of Japanese Canadians. During World War II he and his family had their property confiscated and suffered Japanese Canadian internment, despite Mitsui's status as a decorated veteran of the First World War. He was a guest in 1985 at the ceremony in Vancouver's Stanley Park for the relighting of the lamp on the Japanese Canadian War Memorial; the lamp had been extinguished in 1942. He was the oldest surviving Japanese- Canadian veteran of World War I when he died. Biography Masumi Mitsui was born on 7 October 1887 in Kokura, Fukuoka Prefecture, in Japan. His grandfather had been a samurai. Mitsui emigrated to Canada in 1908, where he worked at first as a waiter at the Union Club in Victoria, British Columbia. He developed a strong command of English and drew notice for his leadership skills. =World War I= World War I broke out in 1914. The federal government was reluctant to accept recruits from ethnic minorities; the Cabinet of Canada rejected a battalion of 171 volunteers the Canadian Japanese Association had trained in early 1916, in which Mitsui had taken part. Strong feelings against Asian immigrants in British Columbia led to widespread discrimination, and even Anti-Oriental Riots of 1907. The province accepted few Japanese volunteers, but neighbouring Alberta posed fewer barriers; the majority of Japanese-Canadian recruits travelled from British Columbia to enlist in Alberta. Mitsui travelled in 1916 to Calgary to enlist with the 192nd Overseas Battalion. He later stated he enlisted because he \\"believed that it would be for the benefit of Canada and for the benefit of Japan\\". Mitsui embarked for Britain on the RMS Empress of Britain that October and was posted to the 9th Reserve Battalion on 25 January 1917. He and six other Japanese-Canadian recruits arrived at the front in France on 5 March 1917 as part of the 10th Battalion, CEF. They suffered racial discrimination at first, but Mitsui stated that in battle \\"there was no time for such behaviour\\". He fought at the Battle of Vimy Ridge and later was wounded in battle that 28 April. The Japanese-Canadian platoon of the 10th Battalion, CEF, Mitsui at the far left To deal with the poor English of many of the Japanese recruits, they were placed under the command of the bilingual Mitsui. He led 35 Japanese Canadians in the Battle of Hill 70, only five of whom survived. During the battle Mitsui retrieved a Lewis machinegun and brought it back to use against the enemy. He received the British Military Medal for leadership, bravery in battle, and assistance to the wounded on the battlefield there. He also received the British War Medal and Victory Medal. After the war ended Mitsui led his platoon in December 1918 across the Rhine into Cologne. Mitsui's command had suffered heavy deaths and casualties and he wrote of feeling \\"very depressed\\" after the death by machinegun fire of his friend Kumakichi Oura. Mitsui refused to discuss his experiences of the war after it ended. He was honourably discharged on 23 April 1919 with the rank of sergeant. =Between the wars= The Canadian Legion, a veteran's organization, was founded in 1925, and the following year Japanese-Canadian veterans established British Columbia Branch No. 9\\\\. The branch petitioned for Japanese-Canadian rights, such as the right to vote, for which it gained the unanimous backing of the Canadian Legion in 1930. The branch made Mitsui its president in 1931. Mitsui and other members travelled to Victoria to promote the Provincial Elections Act, which would extend suffrage to Japanese-Canadian war veterans in British Columbia. Their campaigning led to the passage of the bill by a single vote in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. =World War II and internment= Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 brought the United States into World War II, and the attack on Hong Kong the next day brought Britain and the Commonwealth to war with Japan. Mitsui wrote the Minister of National Defence on behalf of Japanese-Canadian veterans pledging \\"their unflinching loyalty to Canada as they did in the Last Great War\\". Nevertheless, existing anti-Japanese discrimination only increased as Japan became a war enemy, exacerbated by reports of the brutality of the Japanese forces in Hong Kong. Japanese Canadians were labelled enemy aliens and suspected of spying for the Empire of Japan. The Canadian government declined Mitsui's offer of military service. A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent of their property and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment for the duration of the war. The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value. The RCMP took Mitsui and his daughter Lucy to Hastings Park for registration as an enemy alien. Mitsui wore his military medals and when the registering official asked him, \\"What can I do for you, Sarge?\\", Mitsui responded, \\"What are you doing to me? I served my country. You've taken everything away from me. ... What are the good of my medals?\\" He scattered his medals on the floor and table, and refused to wear them thereafter when they were returned to him. He and his family were detained in a facility in Greenwood, British Columbia. Mitsui later stated, \\"I had complete confidence in the government that they wouldn't be doing anything to me because of being a veteran.\\" All the family could later retrieve was a samurai sword Mitsui's son George had buried. =Later life= The Japanese Canadian War Memorial in Vancouver's Stanley Park, erected in honour of Japanese Canadians who served in World War I In 1946 Mitsui and the other remaining 33 Japanese-Canadian veterans of World War I petitioned the Canadian government to restore their civil rights, but the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act passed in 1945 only increased the restrictions. Interned Japanese Canadians were given the option of repatriation to Japan or relocation east of the Rocky Mountains; Mitsui opted to move with his family to Southern Ontario. After staying in a hostel in Toronto they moved to a peach farm in St. Catharines before settling in Hamilton. On Remembrance Day each year Mitsui dressed himself in his uniform and medals and stayed at home, refusing to take part in public services. Mitsui was a guest at the ceremony to relight the lamp on the Japanese Canadian War Memorial in Vancouver's Stanley Park on 2 August 1985; the lamp had been extinguished in 1942. The 98-year-old Mitsui stated in an interview: \\"I've done my last duty to my comrades. They are gone but not forgotten.\\" He was the last surviving member of the 228 Japanese-Canadian veterans of World War I when he died on 22 April 1987. Personal life Mitsui and his wife Sugiko had four children: two girls, Lucy and Amy; and two boys, George (the eldest) and Harry (the youngest). During the war, the girls were sent to Alberta, where they went to school, George went to Ontario, and only Harry stayed with his parents. Mitsui bequeathed his medals to his grandson David, who wore them to an exhibit dedicated to the Japanese-Canadian veterans of World War I at the Calgary Highlanders Museum on 12 March 1994.

It was built in 1959. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 August 1999.  History  The Koumala War Memorial was erected in 1959. The dedication date of the memorial is Friday 18 April 1958. Funds for the memorial were raised by public subscription, arranged by the Koumala sub-branch of the RSL. The memorial was erected in honour of those who served in all wars and particularly honours the six local men who made the supreme sacrifice in honour of their country during the Second World War. Six small trees have been planted by the school children with each tree representative of one the six men. Temporary plaques displaying the names were placed beside each tree with the intention to replace them with more permanent plaques at some later stage.  Description  The Koumala War Memorial is situated in a reserve next to the Koumala State School, facing Bull Street. The reserve is surrounded by a low chain wire fence with white painted metal frames. The setting in which the memorial is located is barren apart from new plantings of \\"Ned Kelly\\" Grevilleas, and a flagpole which stands directly behind the memorial. The memorial is constructed of white painted concrete and comprises a double stepped base from which rises an obelisk on a square plinth. The front face of the plinth features a plaque with a commemorative statement from the citizens of the Koumala district. The obelisk is surmounted by a small Latin cross.

It was built before 1939. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2010.  History  The Mount Martin cane lift is situated near the locality of the same name in a rural area west of the city of Mackay. Mackay is the regional centre of one of Queensland's main sugar cane growing areas. One of the top two sugar producing regions in the state, it produces about a third of the sugar in Queensland. Sugar cane is a major crop in Queensland; the state produces nearly all of the nation's sugar. The cane lifts formed part of the process of transporting bundled whole stalks of harvested sugar cane from the farms to the sugar mill. They were rendered obsolete by the universal adoption of \\"chopper\\" harvesters from the 1960s. Sugar cane was first introduced to Australia in 1788 with the arrival of the First Fleet. In 1821, Port Macquarie under the command of Captain Allman became Australia's first cane-growing area. In Queensland, the successful cultivation of sugar cane was established in 1864 at Redland Bay by Captain Louis Hope who erected Queensland's first sugar-crushing mill on the banks of Hilliard's Creek (now Ormiston) about south-east of Brisbane. Cane growing was tried at Bowen in the Whitsunday Region in 1864 but continued there only until 1869, when it became clear that the climate was too dry. In the Pioneer Valley the first grower in the Mackay region was John Spiller. He arrived in Mackay in 1865 as a would-be squatter without capital but with cane brought from Java which he planted on the north bank of the Pioneer River. In June 1867 he produced the first sugar in the region. The incipient cane growing industry was given impetus in 1864 with the enactment of the Sugar and Coffee Regulations, introduced by the government to encourage northern settlement. This enabled lessees to obtain plots of up to at a reasonable cost. Spiller and John Crees selected two blocks that became the Pioneer Plantation and built a primitive mill. T H Fitzgerald began a commercial plantation, Alexandra, in 1866 and with J Ewen Davidson set up a steam-powered mill that produced of sugar in 1868. With these facilities a sugar boom began: small growers brought their cane for crushing to the Alexandra mill and acreage under cane expanded rapidly. Cane growers pushed back the graziers and by 1870 five mills were established. By 1872 Mackay mills produced 40 per cent of the total Queensland sugar production and 37 per cent of its rum. Seventeen mills were established along the Pioneer River before 1875, most in 1872 and 1873. Another 12 including Farleigh, Habana, Homebush, and Marian were established between 1881 and 1885, then North Eton and Racecourse in 1888, Plane Creek began at Sarina in 1896 and in 1906 Cattle Creek Mill at Finch Hatton started operations. Where crops were near the main railway line, cut cane was transported from field to mill via rail wagons. However, in cases where the crops and mills were remote from the railway, many mills established extensive tram networks for transporting harvested cane. The railway and tram networks continue to be used together with road transport. From at least as early as the 1890s, cane lifts at tram or railway sidings were used to transfer bundles of cane onto rail or tram wagons. Cane was initially harvested as whole stalks by hand and, later, by whole stalk mechanical harvesters. The cane was cut close to the ground and then the top foliage was cut off. It was transported to the mill as whole stalks. A frequent practise was to lay temporary tramlines into the field so that tram wagons could be loaded with cut cane close to where the harvesting took place. Where this practise was not followed, the cane was loaded onto a horse-drawn wagon or motorised vehicle. This was done by hand until the introduction of mechanised loaders in the mid-20th century. The wagon or vehicle transported the cane to the nearest siding where the bundles of cane were transferred onto a tram or rail wagon using the cane lifts. Many lifts were on private property, others on railway land at sidings. In many cases sugar mills paid for the construction of the lifts and cane farmers repaid the money at a predetermined cost per ton of cane sent to the mill. The lifts took different forms. F W Bolton, the manager of Farleigh Mill, is credited with introducing the \\"traverser\\" type by 1891. This consisted of an overhead travelling winch which traversed a horizontal beam supported by two posts. The cane was laid flat on a sling in a dray which was driven under the winch. The winch was used to hoist the bundle of cane which was traversed about two metres and lowered into a tramway wagon parked next to the dray. The lift was praised at the time for greatly reducing loading times and enabling the cane to be packed more densely. Apparently this type of lift was widely adopted but there are no known examples extant in the Mackay area. A similar configuration, possibly a modification of the traverser type, comprised two posts supporting a horizontal beam with a fixed pulley. These were predominantly used with tram wagons. As with the traverser the tram track passed under the horizontal beam. The wagon or truck containing the cane stalks was driven along the tram tracks to a position beneath the horizontal beam. The bundle of cane was hoisted, then the truck was driven out and its position taken by the tram wagon into which the cane was then lowered. The Mount Martin lift is an example of the derrick type. This type featured a boom fixed by a pivoting coupling to the bottom of a mast. The boom was held in a diagonal attitude to the mast by hinged horizontal beam extending from the top of the mast to the end of the boom. The boom swung in an arc and the lifting hook was lowered from the end of the horizontal beam. A ladder was typically fitted to the mast to permit access to the top of the derrick for maintenance purposes. Ladders could be wooden rungs fastened directly to the side of the mast or complete ladders with steel rungs and side rails. Derrick type lifts were in use by 1893. They were used mostly to load cane into main line railway wagons. Albert John Wellman Fudge, a carpenter, is credited by some with inventing the derrick type lift. Fudge was a British immigrant who moved to Mackay in the 1890s. It is claimed that Fudge built over one hundred cane lifts for most district mills. His work was said to have been carried on by Harry Penny until the introduction of chopper harvesters. A variety of methods were used to power the hoist. It was common to use a horse hitched to a pole fixed to a rotating drum. This system was later adapted for use with a motor. From World War II, trucks were also used. Power was transferred via a set of rollers positioned in the ground so that they would engage with the wheels of the truck carrying the cane. The Mount Martin lift was located close beside the railway branch line to Kungurri, opened in 1911. It was designed to transfer cut cane onto rail wagons. Several lifts originally existed at this location and a number of other derricks were erected at other sidings along the line. The extant lift dates to prior to 1939. In 1968, Marian Mill, the main user of the line, shifted to road transport because of the high cost of rail transport relative to road. This led to the closure of the branch line in 1970 and the lifting of the rails. A cane tramway presently runs along the old rail easement close to the lift. Cane lifts became redundant after the widespread introduction of chopper mechanical harvesters. Mechanical harvesting was attempted with little real success from the late 19th century. The development of mechanical harvesters accelerated from World War II. The first harvesters cut the cane as whole stalks. This meant that the labour- intensive task of bundling whole cane stalks and loading them continued. From the early 1950s, mechanical loaders alleviated this problem to some extent. The introduction of chopper harvesters solved the loading problem. These harvesters chop the cane stalks into short lengths or billets. The billets are ejected from the harvester directly into bins towed by motor vehicle alongside the harvester. The bins are towed to the rail siding where they are transferred onto tram or rail wagons. Alternatively, the billets are tipped into bins on the wagons. By the mid-1960s, chopper harvesters had almost completely superseded whole stalk harvesters. The extant cane lifts probably all predate this time and some could date to the late 19th century.  Description  The Mount Martin cane lift is situated at the locality of the same name on the southern side of the Mirani-Mt Ossa Road. Mount Martin is located west of Mackay. The lift is near a tram track in an area where there are extensive fields of sugar cane. The lift stands between high. Its main components are a single upright wooden mast, a wooden boom and a horizontal beam assembly. The horizontal beam assembly consists of two coupled timber beams. The boom is fixed via a hinged coupling to the bottom of the mast. The horizontal beam is fixed via a hinge to the top of the mast and the end of the boom, holding the boom in a diagonal attitude to the mast. Pulley wheels are fixed to the horizontal beam assembly so that the wheels turn between the coupled wooden beams. A wheel is fitted to each end of the beam. Steel cable runs through the pulley wheels. A hook is suspended at the end of the cable. A steel ladder is fitted to the side of the mast and a safety rail runs almost the full length of the horizontal beam. The lift is located in an open grassy paddock adjacent to a cane field.  Heritage listing  Mount Martin Cane Lift was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Mount Martin cane lift is one of a group of lifts in the Mackay region, one of Queensland's oldest and most productive sugar cane growing areas. Historically, sugar has been one of the State's most important agricultural commodities. The lifts are important in demonstrating the evolution of the industry in that they provide evidence of how harvested cane was transported before the introduction of mechanical chopper harvesters. Sugar cane was originally harvested and transported to mills as whole stalks. The lifts were used to hoist bundles of stalks into tram or train wagons. They became redundant after the universal adoption of chopper harvesters from the 1960s. The Mount Martin lift dates to before 1939. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Mount Martin cane lift is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. The lifts took two basic forms: a derrick with a swinging boom, and a horizontal beam supported by two upright posts. The lift at Mount Martin is a highly intact example of the derrick type and includes pulley wheels, cable, hook and access ladder. The ladder is a typical feature of this type of lift and was fitted to permit access to the top of the derrick for maintenance purposes.

It contained 12,824 character head entries, organized by the 540-radical system of the Shuowen Jiezi. In the history of Chinese lexicography, the Zilin followed the Shuowen Jiezi (121; with 9,353 character entries) and preceded the Yupian (c. 543; with 12,158 entries). Text L√º Chen compiled the Zilin to supplement the Shuowen jiezi, and included more the 3,000 uncommon and variant Chinese characters. Yong and Peng (2008: 186) describe the Zilin as a \\"more influential character dictionary\\" than the Shuowen jiezi. L√º Chen's younger brother L√º Jing (ÂëÇÈùú) was also a lexicographer, who compiled the Yunji (ÈüªÈõÜ; \\"Assembly of Rimes\\"; c. 280). Other than their dictionaries, little is known about either brother. The title Zilin, translated as \\"Forest of Characters\\" (Zhou and Zhang 2003: 72) or \\"The Character Forest\\" (Yong and Peng 2008), combines z√¨ Â≠ó \\"character; script; writing; graph\\" and l√≠n Êûó \\"forest; woods; grove; group; collection of literary works; many; numerous\\". Titles of several Japanese dictionaries adapted this rin Êûó \\"forest\\" metaphor, such as Daijirin (Â§ßËæûÊûó; \\"Great Forest of Words\\", 1988) and Dai Kangorin (Â§ßÊº¢Ë™ûÊûó; \\"Great Forest of Chinese\\"; 1992). History The Zilin was popular in the Northern and Southern dynasties period (420‚Äì589), when \\"lexicography in China entered the stage of exploration and development. There were more new dictionary types coming into being and discoveries were waiting to be made in format and style, in mode of definition, and in phonetic notation.\\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 275). During the Liu Song dynasty (420-479), Wu Gongceng (Âê≥ÊÅ≠Êõæ) from Yang Province compiled the first commentary to the Zilin, the Zilin yinyi (Â≠óÊûóÈü≥Áæ©; \\"Pronunciations and Meanings in the Zilin\\") in 5 volumes. Jiang Shi (Ê±üÂºè) was a renowned calligrapher and epigraphist during the Northern Wei (386‚Äì535) dynasty. His biography in the Book of Wei (554) history included the Lunshu biao (Ë´ñÊõ∏Ë°®; \\"Memorial on Calligraphy\\"; 514), in which Jiang Shi described the Zilin. When Prince of Yiyang (r. 349-350) was enfeoffed at Rencheng (‰ªªÂüé) commandery (present-day Yanzhou District), L√º Chen presented the Zilin in 6 volumes. > It generally follows the example of the [Shuowen jiezi]. It cites > extensively and identifies and differentiates ancient characters, characters > of the zhou style, odd characters, and characters easily confusable. Its > writing style is the standardized official script of the Han Dynasty. It > has, to a large extent, captured the essence of xiaozhuan. (tr. Yong and > Peng 2008: 186) Zh√≤uw√©n (Á±ÄÊñá; \\"Large Seal Script\\") and xi«éozhu√†n (Â∞èÁØÜ; \\"Small Seal Script\\") were archaic forms of Chinese calligraphy. Thus, the Zilin followed the Shuowen jiezi format of giving the head character entry in Small Seal Script and the definition in clerical script. The Northern Qi dynasty (550-577) scholar Yan Zhitui's (581) Yanshi jiaxun (È°èÊ∞èÂÆ∂Ë®ì; \\"Family Instructions of the Yan Clan\\") referred to the usefulness of consulting the Zilin. After accompanying the Emperor on a tour, Yan Zhitui wanted to look up the origins and archaic pronunciations of two obscure place names, but could not find the answers in any books, until he checked the Zilin and Yunji character dictionaries (Yong and Peng 2008: 186). Yan Zhitui also referred to L√º Chen (without the Zilin title) in stressing the importance of character dictionaries (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 186-187). \\"Words and characters are fundamental. For students nowadays, they rarely have a better knowledge of characters: when they read the Five Classics\\" they follow the civil official Xu Miao rather than the lexicographer Xu Shen, \\"and when they practice writing fu-poems,\\" they believed in the Chuci poet Qu Yuan's interpretations but neglected L√º Chen's. The Book of Sui (636), the official Sui dynasty (581‚Äì618) history, \\"Biography of Pan Hui\\" (ÊΩòÂæΩ) criticized the Cangjiepian and Jijiupian character primers and Shuowen jiezi and Zilin character dictionaries and praised the Shenglei and Yunji rime dictionaries. > Previous works like Three Cang Primer [‰∏âËíº] and The Instant Primer [ÊÄ•Â∞±] have > merely retained some texts and quotations; those like An Explanatory > Dictionary of Chinese Characters [Ë™™Êñá] and The Character Forest [Â≠óÊûó] only > focus on differentiating the form and structure of characters.

(76, tr. Yong and Feng 2008: 161) The Book of Sui \\"Bibliography\\" section includes L√º Chen's Zilin in 7 volumes and Wu Gongceng's Zilin yinyi (Â≠óÊûóÈü≥Áæ©) in 5 volumes. Up through the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907), the Zilin \\"was considered as important as the Shuowen jiezi, but it was later lost (McNair 1995: 264). Yan Yuansun (È°èÂÖÉÂ≠´; d. 732), the Tang author of Ganlu Zishu \\"Lexicon for Seeking a Salary\\", used the Zilin as a source for determining the zheng Ê≠£ \\"correct\\" (suitable for government examinations) forms of characters. The Fengshi wenjianji (Â∞ÅÊ∞èËÅûË¶ãË®ò; \\"Master Feng's Record of Knowledge\\"; c. 770), written by the Tang dynasty scholar Feng Yan (Â∞ÅÊºî), described the Zilin in a list of early Chinese dictionaries (2, cf. Yong and Feng 2008: 244). During the Jin dynasty, L√º Chen sought out unusual characters and compiled the Zilin in 7 volumes, following the [Shuowen jiezi system of] 540 radicals, it included 12,824 characters. Among all the Shuowen jiezi-based dictionaries, L√º Chen's was the most beneficial. The last remaining copies of the Zilin were lost before the Song dynasty (960-1279). The Book of Song (1493) only mentions this dictionary once. A discussion of different vehicle types (18, Á¶Æ‰∫î) quotes the Zilin that a p√≠ngchƒì (ËªøËªä; \\"curtained carriage\\") had cloth curtains but no rear yu√°n (ËΩÖ; \\"(cart/carriage) shaft\\"), while a zƒ´chƒì (ËºúËªä; \\"ancient covered wagon\\") had a rear shaft. During the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), scholars collected surviving fragments of the Zilin and quotations in other books. For example, the Kangxi Dictionary (1716) quotes its definitions and pronunciations over 180 times. Ren Dazhuang (‰ªªÂ§ßÊ®Å; 1738-1789) compiled the 8-volume Zilin kaoyi (Â≠óÊûóËÄÉÈÄ∏; \\"Examining the Lost Zilin\\") in, and Tao Fangqi (Èô∂ÊñπÁê¶; 1845-1884) compiled the Zilin kaoyi buben (Â≠óÊûóËÄÉÈÄ∏Ë£úÊú¨; \\"Supplement to Examining the Lost Zilin\\").

Planned as a Mach 2-class aircraft, the I-7 was the second of a series of three experimental fighter aircraft from the Mikoyan- Gurevich design Bureau. Like the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-3, the I-7 was to be one of the components of the automated Uragan-1 then under development by protivovozdushnaya oborona strany (PVO Strany) (English transition: Anti-Air Defence of the Nation), the Soviet defense system. The Uragan (Hurricane) defense system was similar to the American Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system. Both systems used ground acquisition and tracking radar data that was fed into a computer control center that remotely guided the interceptor aircraft (or missiles) up to and including weapon final aim and/or weapon release, and then in the case of an aircraft, return the aircraft back to base and landing. A pilot was on board the remotely controlled interceptor, but was there only as a backup in case of failure in the remote control system. In the mid/late 1950s the PVO sent requirements to many of the aircraft design bureaus for an aircraft suitable for the Uragan systems. Several of the bureaus, including Mikoyan-Gurevich, developed a series of aircraft proposals to meet those requirements. MiG‚Äôs proposal was the I-3, which evolved into the I-7 and finally the I-75 experimental aircraft. The I-3 was to use the Klimov VK-3 afterburning bypass turbojet, the first soviet- designed afterburning bypass engine. The technically advanced VK-3 engine was not found reliable and did not meet the required power, and its troublesome development ended with cancellation of the project. The sole I-3 aircraft was rebuilt with the more reliable Lyulka AL-7E/F afterburning turbojet engine, a project that required considerable modifications to the fuselage, as the new engine was larger. The reworked airframe was quite different from the I-3, and was designated as the I-7.http://ruslet.webnode.cz/technika/ruska- technika/letecka-technika/ai-mikojan-ami-gurjevic/i-7u/ The I-7 was later involved in a landing accident and became the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-75 when the airframe was modified to accept the more powerful Lyulka AL-7F-1 engine. Development In the summer of 1956 it was evident to the Mikoyan-and- Gurevich Design Bureau OKB-155 that the Klimov VK-3 engine would never be available, due to developmental problems that led to its eventual cancellation. The existing I-3 airframe was used to create the I-7 series of aircraft. Work began on the redesign of the aircraft to take a Lyulka AL-7E/F turbojet engine as used on the contemporary Sukhoi Su-7. The Lyulka AL-7 engine was a less complex and more dependable engine, as it did not have a bypass system. The AL7 engine was larger than the VK-3, and airframe modifications were made to accommodate it. The airframe was significantly lengthened in the process, marking the transition from the MiG-19 family of aircraft to the MiG-21. Design The I-7U was a supersonic interceptor aircraft of all-metal construction with a mid-mounted swept wing and swept tail. =Fuselage= The long slender fuselage had a circular cross-section through the full length, except in the wing joint area where space was added for landing gear storage. The air inlet at the front the fuselage contained a very long center-body cone with a change in angle partway along its length making it a very sophisticated 3-shock mixed-compression inlet design that is optimized for speeds of more than Mach 2.0. The adjustable dielectric spike contains the search radar antenna. The air inlet duct splits into two elliptical cross-section ducts aft of the spike, routing intake air around the sides of the pressurized cockpit. A semicircular duct along the top of the dorsal spine of the fuselage, extending from the rear of the cockpit enclosure to the vertical fin, carries electrical and fluid lines around the engine compartment. Four fuel tanks are located ahead of the engine. A fifth fuel tank is located aft of the engine, surrounding the exhaust outlet pipe. Two additional fuel tanks were placed inside the central bay of the wing, and two drop tanks could be mounted on pylons located under the central part of the fuselage. The entire fuselage aft of the wing, along with the complete tail, was removable as a single unit for access to the engine. Once the aft fuselage was removed, it was easy to replace or adjust the engine. The aft fuselage ended with a circular adjustable exhaust nozzle. =Cockpit= The single-seat pressurized cockpit also contained the avionics equipment. The cockpit was enclosed with a two-part transparent blue-tinted canopy consisting of a front- hinged tilting front part and a fixed rear part. The front part of the canopy served as a blast shield that protected the pilot from high velocity air when ejecting at supersonic speeds. Cockpit armor protection weighed 59.8 kg and consisted of bulletproof glass in the front hinged front part of the canopy, an armor plate at the front and armored backrest and headrest at the rear. =Wing= The 55¬∞ swept wing had a slight negative camber, and was fitted with a pair of aerodynamic fences to prevent the spanwise flow of air away from the wing roots. The leading edge of the wing incorporated a pair of PVD leading edge slats. Flaps and ailerons were mounted on the trailing edge of the wing. The outer flaps were aligned with the trailing edge forward sweep and the inner flaps were perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body. =Tail= The tail surfaces consisted of one swept vertical surface and a pair of swept horizontal surfaces, which had zero camber. The adjustable horizontal stabilizer was attached to the sides of fuselage, at about the same height as the wing. The rudder top was made of a dielectric material, and served as a cover for the radio antenna. The airplane had a wide lower elongated fin with a rounded profile, and contained one pair of air brakes. Additional air brakes were on the lower middle part of the fuselage, at the roots of the wing leading edge. =Landing gear= The landing gear was a retractable nosegear type. The nose landing gear retracted into the forward part of the fuselage in a bay ahead of the air duct divider. The main landing gear wheels remained somewhat vertical as they retracted toward the fuselage. This allowed the wheels to retract into the side of the fuselage, alongside the engine, as the landing gear strut retracted into a horizontal opening in the bottom of the wing. =Weapons= All weapons were mounted in the wing root. There were two 30 mm Nudelman-Rikhter NR-30 cannon with 80 rounds each, and four ZP-4 retractable rotary launchers each with four type ARS-57 57 mm rockets. =I-7U comparison to the I-3U= The I-7U was very similar in appearance to the I-3U, but with many significant differences. * The I-7U was a larger and more powerful aircraft. * The I-7U inlet lip was sharper with a larger center-body. * The I-7U used a more modern single-antenna radar in place of the dual-antenna radar. * The I-7U main landing gear wheels stowed vertically in the fuselage adjacent to the engine rather than horizontally in the wing. * The I-7U quarter-chord wing sweep was reduced from 60 degrees to 57 degrees, retaining the wing fences, but at the new sweep angle. The wing- mounted cannon and missile armament of the I-3U was retained. Early reports of the I-7U which recorded a top speed of Mach 1.2 was surprisingly poor, as the design speed was expected to be close to the very similar Sukhoi S-1. In fact the aircraft was considerably faster than recorded, but instrument problems in its very short test career prevented the maximum speed from being properly measured. The I-7U's Lyulka AL-7E engine was changed to the AL-7F resulting in the I-7K. The I-7K first flew in January 1959 and was capable of flight at Mach 2.35. The I-7 prototype, I-7P and I-7K designs were followed by the I-7SF all-weather interceptor, but this version, like the others, was not ordered into production. Operational history On 21 June 1957, the sole prototype I-7U suffered damage when the starboard landing gear strut failed as the aircraft landed on its 13th flight. After repair, the test program was resumed but came to an end after only six more flights. After 19 flights, the last in February 1958, the 1-7U was rebuilt into the 1-75 prototype interceptor. Variants ; I-7P : I-7 unarmed prototype ; I-7U : Modification of the I-7 prototype into one of the automated PVO type Uragan-1 system components. Almaz pulse doppler radar and armament was 2 x NR-30 cannon with 80 rpg, and four type ZP-4 telescoping rotary rocket launchers in the wing roots, each with four x ARS-57 57 mm rockets. ; I-7K : Modification of I-7U weapon system. The major change was the type Almaz-3 radar with two short-range command-guided K-6 missiles. The cannon armament was unchanged. The single aircraft was not completed. ; I-7SF :All-weather interceptor. Design study only, none built.

The harbor at the Port of Mtwara was deepened during the colonial times by the British in 1948-1954, and a railway line was built connecting the port, as part of the Tanganyika groundnut scheme. Due to the failure of the scheme the port immediately lost value and the railway line was removed. The port was functional but underutilized for many years due to poor transport infrastructure,TPA, TPA Ports, Mtwara However, in the years of 2010-2011 the increased activity in oil and gas natural resources energy exploration caused a surge on operations.The Economist - Tanzania‚Äôs gas boom - The Mtwara Rockefellers The Mtwara port is also an integral part of the Mtwara Development Corridor project and has recently saw major upgrades. The port also has a special economic zone attached to it and In December 2015 Alistair Freeports Limited injected $700,000 to upgrade the Export processing zone around the port area. Operations The port has historically handled very little cargo due to the lack of large industries in the area. The major export out of the port has always been cashew nuts. The Port has a quay wall of 385m and can handle two ships and one ocean ship at once. Previously the port could only dock ships of length up to 175m however with recent renovations in 2015, the port could dock a 209m ship in February 2015. The port handles 400,000 metric tonnes of cargo annually and constitutes to less than 5% of the total countries cargo movement, however, the government plans to upgrade the port drastically to facilitate trade in the southern part of the country.

The infrastructure around the port is currently being development to help facilitate more cargo to be handled at the port. The port is destined to be an alternative cargo gateway for cargo bound for southern Tanzania, Malawi, Eastern Zambia and Northern Mozambique. Furthermore, for the success and growth of the major coal and iron mining projects such as the Mchucuma Iron Mine and the Liganga mine they need to be able to handle high capacity bulk loads to facilitate exports through the port.

It was built between 1852 and 1872 by Pierre Bardou, one of the founders of the JOB cigarette paper company, then transformed in the 1890s into an elegant mansion by his son-in-law Jules Pams, a politician and amateur art-lover. It illustrates the artistic taste of the wealthy bourgeois at the turn of the 20th century. Today the building is owned by the city of Perpignan, and is only occasionally open to the public. Origins Pierre Bardou (1826‚Äì92) and his father Jean Bardou founded the JOB cigarette paper company, whose name is taken from Jean Bardou's initials. Pierre Bardou bought several houses in Perpignan on the Rue √âmile Zola between 1852 and 1872, where he built workshops lit by a magnificent skylight adjacent to his home, which was enlarged to become a mansion. In practice the factory and the private space were not clearly separated. Pierre's wife, L√©onie Amiel, died in 1871 leaving three children. His sister-in-law, Henriette Amiel, moved into the mansion on 18 rue Saint-Sauveur in Perpignan to care for them. In 1888 the politician Jules Pams married Jeanne Bardou. Jeanne was Pierre Bardou's youngest child, and would inherit the property. The Pams' lived in the house. While Pierre Bardou was an enthusiastic collector of \\"curiosities\\", Jules Pams was an enlightened amateur and patron of contemporary art, and in effect became Bardou's artistic adviser. Development After Pierre Bardou-Job died in 1892 Pams commissioned the architect and designer L√©opold Carlier to remodel the mansion to his taste. The renovation in 1894‚Äì97 added gold, marble and onyx throughout, with marquetry furniture. The paintings were by Paul Gervais, a fashionable artist at the time. Gervais decorated the casinos in Monaco and Nice and the Capitole in Toulouse. His paintings celebrate seductive women, love, and the virtues of civilization. The Pams' were childless, but Henriette Amiel stayed in the house and looked after Pierre Michel Bardou (1887‚Äì1937), son of Jeanne's brother Justin Bardou (1860‚Äì1930). The \\"H√¥tel Pams\\" became the social focus of the wealthy elite of the city. Jules Pams used the left wing as his private house and the right wing for receiving visitors. By the turn of the 20th century the H√¥tel Pams was a large private museum, rivaling Perpignan's public Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts Hyacinthe Rigaud. Jules Pams was administrator of the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts. Pams' wife Jeanne died in 1916. In 1918 he married again, to Marguerite Holtzer. Pams died in 1930. In 1946 Marguerite sold the building to the city of Perpignan. On 8 June 1989 part of the building was designated a monument historique. The protected parts are the interior court, vestibule, stairwell, facades, roofs and interior decoration by the architects L√©opold Carlier and Viggo Dorph-Petersen, and the painters Paul Gervais and Henri Gervex. As of 2015 it was being used for offices and as a conference center. The H√¥tel Pams is generally closed to the public apart from the Visa Pour L'Image exposition in the first two weeks of September, and the European Heritage Days, also in September. Building The building has a square plan, with two floors above the ground level and an attic. There are eight window bays on the main street facade, with rectangular frames on the first two levels and curved bays on the second level. Each bay on the second level opens onto a private balcony. Due to the sloping ground, the rear of the first floor above the street entrance opens onto a ground-level inner court lined on two sides by a portico with alternating Ionic columns and sections of wall. Above one side of the inner court there is a long gallery lit by seven bays with semi-circular arches. In the center of the inner court there is a marble nymph signed Bastet (1896). In the main court a ceramic frieze with floral decoration on the wall provides a background to a bronze statue of a young flute player. Inside, the entrance hall and grand stairway are richly decorated. Above the hall is a cupola lit by a large conical lantern. On the first and second floors painted panels alternate with doors and windows. The first floor panels depict allegories, while those on the second floor depict maritime scenes, perhaps connected with the shipping activities of the Pams family.

It is rated at a staggering 270 watts per channel into 8 ohms. However, in the September 1978 issue of Audio Magazine, Leonard Feldman did a spec test on the SX-1980 and concluded that the rating of 270 watts per channel was too conservative. He stated in his report: > Though the new [IHF mandated] \\"Dynamic Headroom\\" measurement is specified in > dB, it should be mentioned that based upon the short-term signal used to > measure the 2.3 dB headroom of this amplifier, it was producing nearly 460 > watts of short-term power under these test conditions! At an official rating of 270 watts per channel into 8 ohms with a 2.3 dB dynamic headroom, this makes the SX-1980 Pioneer's most powerful receiver, as well as being one of the most powerful receivers ever manufactured in the world, to date. The SX-1980 is 22 inches wide, 19.5 inches deep, and 8.25 inches high; weighing . The case, like the Pioneer HPM-100, has a fine-grain, walnut veneer finish. It has massive heatsinks on the back to dissipate the immense heat the receiver can build up. The receiver had 12 Field Effect Transistors (FETs), 11 Integrated Circuits (ICs), 130 transistors and 84 diodes. Its retail price in 1978 was US$1295.00. According to the CPI inflation calculator, that would equate to about $3,700 in 2015. The SX-1980 is known for its total harmonic distortion (THD) rating of less than 0.03% at rated power, much less than the 1-10% commonly used today. The build quality is also higher than average. The unit compares favorably in side by side tests with newer large receivers. With a rated power consumption of 1400 volt- amperes or nearly 1000 watts, it would consume a fair amount of the power a standard 15-amp, 120-volt (North America) circuit can safely deliver. From the owner's manual: > The adoption of a single-stage differential amplifier with low-noise dual > transistors, a current mirror load and a 3-stage Darlington triple SEPP > circuit provides a bumper power output of 270 watts + 270 watts (20 Hertz to > 20,000 Hertz with no more than 0.03% THD) which is extremely stable.

He was the former economic advisor to the Russian government. He is a younger son of Nikolai Shamalov, a co-owner of Rossiya Bank. Shamalov is a vice-president of Sibur holding. Early life and education Shamalov is the younger son of Nikolai Shamalov. Shamalov was educated at Saint Petersburg State University, where he obtained a degree in jurisprudence. Career Shamalov became an industry leader in 2012 when the owners of Sibur promoted him from Vice President of Business Administration to Deputy CEO. He was given a 4.3% stake in the company. With the help of a loan from Gazprombank, Shamalov purchased an additional 17% of Sibur from Gennady Timchenko, owner of Sibur, for roughly $2.2 billion. In April 2017, Bloomberg reported that Shamalov sold his shares of Sibur that he purchased from Timchenko to Leonid Mikhelson, the other owner of Sibur.

This song is about what actually 'goes down in the kitchen', a deeper look into Crybaby's family life.\\"Tali Jaqueline, \\"Melanie Martinez Slips Into Surrealist Mayhem in Arresting 'Sippy Cup' Video\\", SPIN, July 30, 2015 The song is composed in G minor.Musicnotes.com Music video Martinez further explores the character of Cry Baby and her home life in \\"Sippy Cup\\", showing just how serious her parents' problems are. No matter how much her mother tries to hide her alcoholism, Cry Baby knows that she is hiding liquor in her sippy cup. When the drunk mother sees her husband with another woman, she ties both of them up, murders them, and covers the bodies up with a bloody sheet. Cry Baby then walks in on the crime scene; shocked and overwhelmed by the sight, she begins to panic. Her mother puts her to sleep and when she awakens, Cry Baby is chained to her own bed. To cover up the murder, her mother drugs her so she would forget the gruesome memory. Charts {  - ! Chart (2015) !

Flooding has been known to occur along the stream. Course Luphers Run begins on a large ridge in Beaver Township. It flows north-northwest for several tenths of a mile before receiving an unnamed tributary from Bear Spring on the right. The stream then continues flowing north-northwest for more than a mile before reaching the bottom of the ridge. At this point, it turns northwest for a few tenths of a mile and enters Beavertown. In Beavertown, the stream turns north-northwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing US Route 522 and reaching its confluence with Kern Run. Luphers Run joins Kern Run upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Luphers Run is designated as an impaired waterbody. The cause of the impairment is nutrients and organic enrichment/low dissolved oxygen. The likely source of the impairment is municipal point source discharges. Additionally, the headwaters of the stream are impacted by acid deposition and low pH.

For the production of the prints, Turner created the etchings for the prints, which were worked in mezzotint by his collaborating engravers. The original models for the printmakers to follow were mainly in sepia watercolour, sometimes with elements in pencil and other media, and are now in Tate Britain as part of the Turner Bequest.

It is an erect shrub with narrow, sticky, pointed leaves and densely hairy light to dark lilac-coloured flowers. Description Eremophila coacta is an erect shrub usually growing to about high and wide. The younger stems are sticky with resin which gradually dries to a brown and flaky layer. The leaves are clustered near the ends of the stems and are linear, mostly long and about wide, sticky and hairy at first but becoming glabrous when mature. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a stalk long which, like the leaves is resinous at first. There are 5 lance-shaped, pointed green to purple sepals, long which grow to as the flower matures. The sepals are glabrous on their outer surface but densely hairy with prominent transparent glands on the inner surface. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is light to dark lilac-coloured and densely hairy while the inside of the tube is densely woolly. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from July to September and is followed by fruits which are dry, woody, oval to cone-shaped and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock about north-west of Ashburton Downs. The specific epithet (coacta) is a Latin word meaning \\"felted\\" referring to the surface of the petal tube. Distribution and habitat Eremophila coacta occurs in the area between Ashburton Downs, Mount Vernon and Paraburdoo in the Gascoyne and Pilbara biogeographic regions where it grows in laterite and shale soils on ironstone hills and along creek lines. Conservation status Eremophila coacta is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

The property was nominated for being one of Washington County's few remaining 19th-century farmsteads. Description Charles Spangenberg's farm originally constituted . The farm buildings are clustered together on a lot on top of a knoll. Only the three oldest buildings date to Spangenberg's occupancy: the farmhouse, a barn, and a granary. The house was constructed of limestone in 1871. It has three stories plus a walkout basement, having been built into a slope. At their base the walls are thick and taper to . In recent years the house has been expanded with a new wing, a garage, and dormers for additional headroom in the attic. The two-story granary was constructed around 1875. A larger barn for the Spangenbergs' horses and dairy cattle was built around 1887. Both are timber-framed structures with board-and-batten siding, on limestone foundations. The barn was also built into a slope, providing walk-in access both to the level for livestock and the level for hay storage. Additional farm structures were constructed in the first half of the 20th century, including a chicken coop, ice house, wind-powered water pump, milk house, privy, and smoke house. As of 2015 a pump house built around 1925 and a steel silo constructed in 1940 still stood on the property. History Charles Spangenberg was an early pioneer of the Woodbury area and acquired title to in 1869. With his brother FrederickSources do not clarify whether this is the same individual associated with the Frederick Spangenberg House in Saint Paul, Minnesota. he began building a house, quarrying limestone from bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River and hauling it with a team of horses and a stone-boat. Charles and his family lived in the house's foundation until construction was complete in 1871. The Spangenbergs mostly grew potatoes and grain, the usual produce of the area's farms. The property remained in the family until 1901, when it was sold to the Czikalla family. They built a number of additional structures and shifted primarily to dairy farming. The property stayed in the Czikalla family for over a century, changing hands for only the third time when it was put up for auction in 2008.

Miharvans were shunned by the followers of Guru Arjan who derogatively labelled them Minas (‡®Æ‡©Ä‡®£‡©á) meaning \\"scoundrels\\", and declared as one of the five Panj Mel that a Sikh must avoid by Guru Gobind Singh. Miharvan Sikhs emerged as major sect which ran in parallel to Guru Arjan and his official successors.Page 170, The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies, Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech They controlled Amritsar and Harmandir Sahib built under Guru Arjan for much of the 17th century. History In Miharvan literature, Prithi Chand was a devout follower of Guru Arjan who helped the Sikh cause and was the rightful successor of Guru Arjan. After the arrest and execution of Guru Arjan by Mughal emperor Jehangir, unofficial associates in the commune made the eleven year old Guru Hargobind the next Guru and began vilifying Prithi Chand. In contrast, some historic sources allege that Prithi Chand was a mean person who challenged Guru Arjan, who tried to poison his son Guru Hargobind and helped the Mughal officials arrest then execute Guru Arjan. They began to apply the offensive term Mina, meaning a \\"deceitful, charlatan, hypocrite\\", to Miharvan Sikhs. They say this term emerged after Guru Ram Das nominated his younger son as the next Guru, instead of the elder son. The elder son Prithi Chand protested this decision. Sikhs in the commune split, some supporting Guru Arjan, others Prithi Chand. The latter group were considered hostile.Page 41, Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed, Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair Some scholars avoid using the derogatory term for them, and call them the Miharvan sampraday (meaning \\"Miharvan commune\\") or Sikhan da chotta mel (\\"Sikh sect that lived for a short while\\"). They were a major parallel Sikh sect in the 17th century in addition to the orthodox Sikhs, but not the only one. Other sub-traditions of Sikhism included the Hindali Sikhs who followed Baba Hindal. All of these Sikh sects produced a variety of competing Sikh literature that is of historic importance to Sikh studies. Miharvan Sikhs emerged in a period of religious persecution and inner dispute within the Sikh tradition on the appropriateness of violence and non-violence in the pursuit of religious freedoms and spiritual matters. According to Hardip Syan and Pritam Singh, Miharvans emphasized more of the non-militant approach of Guru Nanak and earlier Gurus in theological pursuits, while the Guru Hargobind followers pursued the \\"miri- piri\\" approach and began militarizing the Sikh tradition to resist the Mughal persecution. The Miharvans sect is nearly extinct. Miharvan Guru lineage Miharvans accept the authority of first five Gurus (as recognised by mainstream Sikhs) but subsequently have their own lineage. The Gurus recognised by Miharvans are: # Guru Nanak # Guru Angad # Guru Amardas # Guru Ramdas # Guru Arjan # Guru Prithi Chand # Guru Miharvan (Manohar Das) # Guru Harji Literary contributions Miharvans, also called the Miharban Sikh tradition, created significant literature about 16th and 17th century Sikhism. However, as outcasts from other Sikhs, the literature is not a part of the Khalsa approved historic texts of Sikhism. They are credited with the authorship of Janamsakhis (about the first four Gurus) but the Khalsa considers them corrupted texts. According to some scholars such as Ahluwalia, Prithi Chand's copious literary compositions as a devotional poet and pen name of \\"Nanak\\", \\"Jan Nanak\\" or \\"Nanak Das\\", were a reason that pressured Guru Arjan to compile and release an official version of the Adi Granth. Guru Arjan hoped to prevent a competing version of scripture confusing his Sikh followers. The Miharvan tradition launched by Prithi Chand continued to compose poems dedicated to God, which they believed was in the tradition of Guru Nanak. The Islamic historians of the Mughal era recorded the conflict and contest between the Miharvan and the followers of Hargobind, such as in the Dabistan-i Mazahib.

It was decommissioned in 1900, converted to a transport and renamed Piedrabuena. It was the sixth ship of the Argentine Navy named after the Paran√° river; its name was chosen by President Sarmiento.  Design  Paran√° was a steam corvette rigged as a barque, with a steel hull covered in wood planks. She was powered by a 475 HP compound steam engine with two cylindrical boilers, driving a 2-paddle Bevis-type propeller. It could reach a speed of under sail and steam, or under steam only. Her main battery, as built, was composed of four Vavasseur mounted guns, mounted one at the front of the funnel, another behind it, and one per side. As refitted in 1879, it included one (bow) and two (one per side) Armstrong guns. Paran√° was upgraded at nearly the same time as its sister ship Uruguay, so the same armament is presumed was installed.  History  Paran√° was ordered in 1872 as part of the so-called \\"Sarmiento‚Äôs Squadron\\", authorized by the Naval Law of 1872 to enhance the Argentine Navy after its performance in the Paraguayan War. Construction was contracted at a cost of ¬£ 32,000 to the shipyard of Laird Brothers, at Birkenhead; together with her sister ship Uruguay. She was ferried to Argentina by a British crew, departing Birkenhead in April 1874 and arriving in Buenos Aires at the end of that month; being commissioned into the Argentine Navy on 2 May 1874. Her first commander was Sargento Mayor de Marina Ceferino Ram√≠rez, who was removed from its command when the crew joins the September 1874 Revolution. After the failure of the revolution, Paran√° was surrendered in the Uruguayan port of Maldonado, and returned to Argentina in late November 1874. Between 1876 and 1877 Paran√° is assigned to Asunci√≥n del Paraguay, commanded by Captain Augusto Lasserre. From 1878 to 1884 she sails several times to the Patagonia, with a trip to R√≠o de Janeiro in July‚ÄìDecember 1882. In 1879 she is refurbished, including changing her armament. Between April and November 1884 she participates in the Argentine expedition to the South Atlantic to implement the Boundary Treaty of 1881, which concluded with the possession of Ushuaia on 12 October. She returned to Buenos Aires in late November 1884. From 1885 to 1889 she performs various tasks in the Paran√°, Uruguay and de la Plata rivers, including hydrographic survey. In 1894 she is repaired and modernized, including replacement of the boilers. During 1895, 1897 and 1898 is assigned to transport duties; and in 1899 is disarmed. In 1900 she was reclassified as a transport ship and renamed Piedrabuena.

Froment (born 1 October 1930) is professor emeritus of chemical engineering at the University of Gent, Belgium, and research professor of Texas A&M; University. Froment's career and influence bridges the gap between academic kinetic and chemical reaction engineering studies, and application of that fundamental science to problems of industrial relevance.  Education and acclaim  Froment achieved his chemical engineering degree in 1953 from the University of Gent. He continued his graduate education at the University of Gent serving as an assistant to Professor Goethals; he earned his Ph.D. in chemical engineering in 1957. Following his degrees, he spent the next two years internationally starting with a year with Professor Schoenemann at the Institute for Chemical Technology in Darmstadt, Germany. The following year, Froment obtained a fellowship from the Belgian-American Educational Foundation enabling a year at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he worked with Professors Olaf Hougen, K.M. Watson, and C.C. Watson on catalytic kinetics and the modeling of catalyst beds. = Tenure at University of Gent = In 1959, Froment returned to the University of Gent as associate professor. In 1968, he was promoted to full professor and director of the Laboratorium voor Petrochemische Techniek until 1996, when he became emeritus professor of the University of Gent. During his time at Gent, Froment's objective was from the very start of his career to design or simulate industrial catalytic reactors using mathematical models, based on sound theoretical background and adequate experimentation. Froment has contributed continuously and with great authority in developing more mechanistic, and therefore more realistic models, involving more and more the detailed transformations of both the fluid molecules and the catalytic surface. A difficult problem relates to the transport inside the particle, and this has actively been addressed by Froment since the 1980s when the catalyst particle was still dealt with as a single pore or at best as a pseudocontinuum. Froment was aware of the need to retain the network topology on the modeling, in particular when pores can be blocked by metals or coke deposition. Froment has been a pioneer in the rationalization and modeling of catalyst deactivation by coke formation. He studied this phenomenon on the three levels : the active site (or clusters thereof), the particle (a network of pores that can be blocked by coke), and the reactor. This led him to apply, at the forefront of the development, Bethe and percolation networks to the description of mass transport and reaction inside catalyst particles, instead of the description in terms of a tortuosity factor. Another major area where Froment has been active is thermal cracking for olefins production, an operation of tremendous industrial importance, providing the key building blocks for the petrochemical and chemical industries. Froment started research in this area already in 1959, stressing the derivation of accurate kinetic data from experimentation in tubular flow reactors and developing the equivalent reactor volume concept introduced by Hougen and Watson. Continuing this work through the decades led to more advanced and detailed reaction kinetics integrated within reactor models with transport phenomena. This impressive effort, combining heat transfer and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics calculations, has led to the most advanced furnace models in use today. = Tenure at Texas A&M; = Various universities in the US were interested in hiring him upon his retirement from the University of Gent. He finally opted to join Texas A & M University, where he had several friends, as \\"research professor\\" so that he could concentrate on research and a few seminars for graduate students. Between 1999 and 2015 he directed 9 Ph.D. students and a number of postdocs from all over the world. His research concentrated on the application of the Single Event concept, which he had developed in Belgium, to the complex refining processes such as FCC, hydrocracking, alkylation and petrochemical processes such as MTO (methanol- to-olefins) and oligomerization. Since 2015 he concentrated on the kinetics and design of the Fisher-Tropsch process  Commitment to excellence in teaching  Froment has established a record of excellence for instruction of chemical engineering and reaction engineering. His dedication to teaching has led him all over the world as a visiting professor at other Belgian universities, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (1967‚Äì77) and Universite Libre de Bruxelles (1967‚Äì69), and at Yale University (1969), University of Houston (1973 and 1981), Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahia Blanca, Argentina (1977), University of Buenos Aires, Argentina (1981), Universidad de Salta (since 1983), University of Santa Fe, Argentina (1983), and University of Stanford (1984). He also was an adjunct professor at University of Delaware (1980‚Äì85). = Textbook: Chemical Reactor Analysis and Design = In collaboration with his co-author, Dr. Kenneth Bischoff, Froment published his highly influential textbook entitled, \\"Chemical Reactor Analysis and Design,\\" in 1970. A second edition was published in 1990, followed by a third edition in 2010. The textbook has been utilized around the world in the instruction of chemical reaction engineering within chemical engineering curricula. The impact of the textbook has been attributed to the extensive background of Froment and Bischoff, which provides context into the connections between the macro- and micro-scale phenomena of transport and reaction engineering.  Service to Chemical Reaction Engineering  Gilbert Froment has been active in professional organizations and supportive of the chemical reaction engineering community. He is the founder of the Chemical Engineering Section of the Koninklijke Vlaamse Ingenieursvereniging and a member of the Working Party on Chemical Reaction Engineering of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering since 1966 and of the Working Party of the Use of Computers in Chemical Engineering since 1968. He has organized many congresses such as those on ‚ÄúCatalyst Deactivation‚Äù and ‚ÄúLarge Chemical Plants‚Äù. He chaired ISCRE-14 in Bruges, Belgium. Froment has also been active as an editor. He was co-editor of Chemical Engineering Science from 1965 until 1996 and of Chemical Reaction Engineering Reviews since 1971 and was a member of the editorial boards of Bulletin des Societes Chimiques Belges, Applied Catalysis, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Chemical Engineering Reviews, Revista Latino-Americana de Ingenieria Quimica, and Energie Primaire.  Academic accomplishments  With over 70 Ph.D. students and over 300 scientific publications, Gilbert has had a significant impact on the science and the practice of Chemical Reaction Engineering. Froment has been widely recognized, in Belgium and abroad, for his role as an educator and a scientist. He has received the Frederick Swarts Award for Applied Chemistry of the Royal Belgian Academy (1958), the National Alumni Award of the Belgian University Foundation (1966), the Prix Cornez de la Province du Hainaut (1976), and the R. H. Wilhelm Award in Chemical Reaction Engineering from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (1984). He received a Doctor of Science Honoris Causa degree from Technion, Haifa, Israel (1984), and was elected a member of the Acade¬¥mie Royale Belge des Sciences d‚ÄôOutremer in 1981 and a member of the Koninklijke Academie van Belgie, Class of Science, in 1988. In 1999, he was awarded the Villermaux-medal of European Federation of Chemical Engineering. In 2007, Froment was awarded the Neal R.

She served as the First Lady of Pennsylvania from 1963 to 1967 during the administration of her husband, William Scranton, the 38th Governor of Pennsylvania and 1964 U.S. presidential candidate. She focused on housing and community affairs issues in Northeast Pennsylvania after her tenure as Pennsylvania's First Lady. Mary Scranton was the first woman to serve on the boards of trustees for both the University of Scranton and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Scranton, who served on Caltech's board of trustees from 1975 to 1989, was placed in charge of the university's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a NASA facility. She defended the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and successfully secured federal funding for the laboratory against budget cuts by the Reagan administration during the 1980s. Jet Propulsion Laboratory remains an important component of the U.S. space program to the day, in large part due to Mary Scranton's defense of its programs during that era. Biography =Early life and career= Scranton was born Mary Lowe Chamberlin on April 27, 1918 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to William Lawson Chamberlin and Margaret Lowe Chamberlin. She graduated from Scranton Country Day School and the Masters School, a private boarding school located in Dobbs Ferry, New York. In 1940, Chamberlin received her degree from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Chamberlin married her childhood neighbor, William \\"Bill\\" Scranton, on July 6, 1942, when she was 24 years old. The Scranton family was the namesake her hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Mary Scranton was working as a research analyst for the Army Air Force's Intelligence Service, based in Washington D.C., at the time of her marriage. She also served as a nurses' aide for the Red Cross later during the war. Mary and William Scranton had one daughter and three sons, including William Scranton III, who would serve as Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1987. The family lived in Glenburn, Pennsylvania, north of the city of Scranton. =Pennsylvania First Lady and 1964 presidential campaign= Mary Scranton supported her husband's congressional, gubernatorial and presidential campaigns. Bill Scranton was elected Governor of Pennsylvania in 1962, making his wife the state's First Lady from 1963 to 1967. Scranton, a moderate-to-liberal Republican governor, ran for President of the United States in 1964 as a progressive alternative to Barry Goldwater, a conservative U.S. Senator. Scranton lost the Republican nomination to Goldwater, though Mary Scranton campaigned actively on his behalf. Jack Gould, a New York Times reporter and television critic who covered the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, praised Mary Scranton's contributions to the campaign and her televised appearance at the convention, writing \\"If the Republican meeting produced one particularly videogenic personality it was Mrs. Mary Scranton. The mixture of exceptional forcefulness and attractiveness registered with far greater power on the home screen than her husband's predilection to subtlety and understatement. Mrs. Scranton's championing of her husband to the very end invited an emotional involvement on the part of the viewer that somehow the governor never quite secured.\\" Another New York Times story on Mary Scranton, published in June 1964, called her a \\"campaign star\\". First Lady Mary Scranton opposed an idea to relocate the official Pennsylvania Governor's Residence to a proposed penthouse apartment, which would have been located within the old Executive Office Building, which was the original home of the State Museum of Pennsylvania until 1964, on the grounds of the Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex. Scranton argued that no First Lady would want to reside in an apartment without a play area or grass for their children (though the building was surrounded by Capitol Park). Officials scrapped the idea for the Governor's apartment due to Mary Scranton's opposition to the plan. Instead, Bill and Mary Scranton resided at an official residence at Fort Indiantown Gap during the tenure in Harrisburg. The house at Fort Indiantown Gap is now the residence of the Lieutenant Governor. =Career= Mary Scranton welcomed the end of her role as Pennsylvania First Lady in 1967, when her husband left office after one term. In a 1972 story for the Associated Press, Scranton explained, \\"When it was over, I realized that I had the golden opportunity of having everything cleared away for me, of being released from all honorary titles and associations...Those four years in Harrisburg were a stage of growth in which we learned talents we can put to use here.\\" She focused on housing and industrial development in her hometown of Scranton during the 1960s and 1970s. The housing and industrial sectors in the Scranton area had been in decline since the Great Depression of the 1930s, as the mining industry had collapsed. Mary Scranton co-established Scranton Neighbors, which worked to improve the quality of housing in the city of Scranton. New housing developments were constructed through the organization, including the Midtown Apartments, which are still located near the intersection of Adams Avenue and Olive Street in Scranton. Mary Scranton became the president of Friendship House, a local organization which provides services for children with autism and behavioral problems. In April 1970, Mary Scranton became the first woman appointed to the board of trustees of the University of Scranton. The University of Scranton later awarded her an honorary degree in 1977. In 1975, Scranton was appointed to the board of trustees for California Institute of Technology, becoming the first woman to be named to Caltech's board. A trustee from 1975 to 1989, Scranton became the chairperson of the committee which oversaw the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a federally funded research and development center which is managed by Caltech on behalf of NASA. Scranton defended the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and its programs against steep funding cuts by the Reagan administration during the 1980s. She successfully lobbied Congress and to secure federal funds for the Laboratory, which kept its programs funded and relevant. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory remains an important component of NASA's space program today due to Scranton's oversight during the 1980s. Later life Scranton and husband resided at the Casa Dorinda retirement community in Montecito, California, near Santa Barbara, for the last eight years of her life. They also maintained a home in Waverly, Pennsylvania. Her husband, former Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton, had died in 2013 following 71 years of marriage. Mary Scranton died from complications of Alzheimer's disease at the Casa Dorinda retirement community in Montecito, California, on December 26, 2015, at the age of 97. She was survived by her four children - Susan Scranton Dawson, former Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania William Scranton III, Joseph C. Scranton, and Peter K. Scranton - and their families. Governor Tom Wolf ordered flags be lowered to half staff in Scranton's honor until January 3, 2016.

It has been performed by several musical artists and theatrical entertainers, including Lydia Thompson, who featured the song in her traveling operetta Bluebeard. Though Leybourne is best known for his composition \\"The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze\\", the comedic lyrical content and catchy melody of \\"If Ever I Cease to Love\\" became tremendously appealing in New Orleans. Since the first Rex parade in 1872, the tune has been ceremoniously played to the krewe's figurehead, Rex, who bears the title \\"King of Carnival\\" in New Orleans. Background Leybourne had begun his career in England's northern music halls in 1866. Dressed in formal wear, his performing style helped advance the popularity of entertainers known as Lion comiques who parodied upper-class swells. His 1867 compositions \\"Champagne Charlie\\" and \\"The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze\\" furthered the concept of music hall in England and are considered Leybourne's greatest artistic successes. In 1871, he penned \\"If Ever I Cease to Love\\", with early editions of the sheet music crediting the tune simply as a \\"comedic song\\". The song featured a nonsensical chorus that forewarns the listener \\"If ever I cease to love, if ever I cease to love / May fish get legs and cows lay eggs / If ever I cease to love\\", which soon became open to other interpretations. Theatrical entertainer Lydia Thompson, while performing on the English music hall circuit, was amused by \\"If Ever I Cease to Love\\", and adapted it into her operetta, Bluebeard. Thompson's act was spectated by Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia, fourth son of Tsar Alexander II, as she and her troupe, \\"The British Blondes\\", embarked on a US tour in 1872. The Grand Duke had been traveling across the east coast and Midwest of the US since the fall of 1871 in reciprocation for the 1867 visit to Russia made by Admiral David Farragut. Notorious for engaging in several scandalous affairs, Alexandrovich took a liking to Thompson after a private dinner party, and attended several more shows to see the performer. The burlesque troupe capitalized on the rumors of the two's supposed relationship, effectively boosting attendance for the latter half of their touring schedule. All the while, the School of Design was formed to add an organized daytime parade on Mardi Gras Day to complement the established Mystick Krewe of Comus, which had held an annual nighttime parade and ball for over a decade since its founding in 1856. Well aware of the Thompson and Alexandrovich gossip, the School of Design invited the Grand Duke to their newly established parade, and fabricated a story that his arrival signaled a continuation of his romantic relationship with Thompson. In reality, Alexandrovich's had his eyes set on actress Lotta Crabtree who was involved in a traveling company performing the play \\"The Little Detective\\". In 1872, the School of Design selected \\"If Ever I Cease to Love\\" as the royal anthem to be played for their appointed monarch, Rex, a position which is considered to be one of the highest honors in the City of New Orleans (a different individual is selected every year to reign as Rex and bear the title \\"King of Carnival\\" for that year's festivities). Already, the composition was in popular demand among the city's populace for its lighthearted premise, and interpretations by several writers, including columnists in the New Orleans Picayune. In contrast to initial reports, the song was not performed for the Grand Duke's arrival, but rather for the king, Rex, and has become the tradition ever since. The Russian national anthem was played, instead, for Alexandrovich.

For the symmetric case (asymmetry parameter Œ∫ = 1), the distribution becomes a wrapped Laplace distribution. The distribution of the ratio of two circular variates (Z) from two different wrapped exponential distributions will have a wrapped asymmetric Laplace distribution. These distributions find application in stochastic modelling of financial data.  Definition  The probability density function of the wrapped asymmetric Laplace distribution is: : \\\\begin{align} f_{WAL}(\\\\theta;m,\\\\lambda,\\\\kappa) & =\\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f_{AL}(\\\\theta+2 \\\\pi k,m,\\\\lambda,\\\\kappa) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{e^{-(\\\\theta-m)\\\\lambda\\\\kappa}} {1-e^{-2\\\\pi\\\\kappa\\\\lambda}}- \\\\dfrac{e^{(\\\\theta-m)\\\\lambda/\\\\kappa}} {1-e^{2\\\\pi\\\\lambda/\\\\kappa}} & \\\\text{if } \\\\theta \\\\geq m \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[12pt] \\\\dfrac{e^{-(\\\\theta-m)\\\\lambda\\\\kappa}} {e^{2 \\\\pi \\\\lambda\\\\kappa}-1}- \\\\dfrac{e^{ (\\\\theta-m)\\\\lambda/\\\\kappa}} {e^{-2\\\\pi\\\\lambda/\\\\kappa }-1} & \\\\text{if }\\\\theta where f_{AL} is the asymmetric Laplace distribution. The angular parameter is restricted to 0 \\\\le \\\\theta < 2\\\\pi. The scale parameter is \\\\lambda > 0 which is the scale parameter of the unwrapped distribution and \\\\kappa > 0 is the asymmetry parameter of the unwrapped distribution. Characteristic function The characteristic function of the wrapped asymmetric Laplace is just the characteristic function of the asymmetric Laplace function evaluated at integer arguments: :\\\\varphi_n(m,\\\\lambda,\\\\kappa)=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2 e^{i m n}}{\\\\left(n-i \\\\lambda/\\\\kappa \\\\right) \\\\left(n+i \\\\lambda\\\\kappa \\\\right)} which yields an alternate expression for the wrapped asymmetric Laplace PDF in terms of the circular variable z=ei(Œ∏-m) valid for all real Œ∏ and m: : \\\\begin{align} f_{WAL}(z;m,\\\\lambda,\\\\kappa) &= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\varphi_n(0,\\\\lambda,\\\\kappa)z^{-n} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] &= \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\pi(\\\\kappa+1/\\\\kappa)} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\textrm{Im}\\\\left(\\\\Phi (z,1,-i \\\\lambda\\\\kappa )-\\\\Phi \\\\left(z,1,i \\\\lambda /\\\\kappa \\\\right)\\\\right)-\\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi } & \\\\text{if }z e 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[12pt] \\\\coth(\\\\pi\\\\lambda\\\\kappa)+\\\\coth(\\\\pi\\\\lambda/\\\\kappa) & \\\\text{if }z=1 \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} where \\\\Phi() is the Lerch transcendent function and coth() is the hyperbolic cotangent function. Circular moments In terms of the circular variable z=e^{i\\\\theta} the circular moments of the wrapped asymmetric Laplace distribution are the characteristic function of the asymmetric Laplace distribution evaluated at integer arguments: :\\\\langle z^n\\\\rangle=\\\\varphi_n(m,\\\\lambda,\\\\kappa) The first moment is then the average value of z, also known as the mean resultant, or mean resultant vector: : \\\\langle z \\\\rangle =\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2 e^{i m}}{\\\\left(1-i \\\\lambda/\\\\kappa \\\\right) \\\\left(1+i \\\\lambda\\\\kappa \\\\right)} The mean angle is (-\\\\pi \\\\le \\\\langle \\\\theta \\\\rangle \\\\leq \\\\pi) : \\\\langle \\\\theta \\\\rangle=\\\\arg(\\\\,\\\\langle z \\\\rangle\\\\,)=\\\\arg(e^{i m}) and the length of the mean resultant is : R=\\\\langle z \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda ^2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\kappa ^2}+\\\\lambda^2 \\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\kappa ^2+\\\\lambda ^2\\\\right)}}. The circular variance is then 1 ‚àí R  Generation of random variates  If X is a random variate drawn from an asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD), then Z=e^{i X} will be a circular variate drawn from the wrapped ALD, and, \\\\theta=\\\\arg(Z)+\\\\pi will be an angular variate drawn from the wrapped ALD with 0<\\\\theta\\\\leq 2 \\\\pi. Since the ALD is the distribution of the difference of two variates drawn from the exponential distribution, it follows that if Z1 is drawn from a wrapped exponential distribution with mean m1 and rate Œª/Œ∫ and Z2 is drawn from a wrapped exponential distribution with mean m2 and rate ŒªŒ∫, then Z1/Z2 will be a circular variate drawn from the wrapped ALD with parameters ( m1 \\\\- m2 , Œª, Œ∫) and \\\\theta=\\\\arg(Z_1/Z_2)+\\\\pi will be an angular variate drawn from that wrapped ALD with -\\\\pi<\\\\theta\\\\leq \\\\pi.

Overview The book suggests that the rapid integration of digital technologies, communications and markets, has accelerated the velocity at which events unfold ‚Äì and generates momentum on a massive scale (Big Mo). Roeder warns, 'As our world becomes more efficient and automated, there is less ‚Äòfriction‚Äô to slow the momentum, which can lead to catastrophic results.‚Äô The book examines the impact of Big Mo on finance, media, politics, wars, religion and science. Roeder, an ex-executive at UBS, bank, argues that momentum played an instrumental role in the Global Financial Crisis, and that it distorted decision-making in the lead up to the second Iraq War. He suggests that momentum ‚Äòhas become the zeitgeist of our time‚Äô Key concepts :*The momentum effect has recently become more powerful and pervasive, driven by rapid advances in technology and the integration of global systems. :*When momentum increases to a critical level, it creates a Big Mo effect that is self perpetuating and difficult to slow down or stop. :*Paradoxically, organisations and networks that are highly integrated and efficient are most susceptible to Big Mo. This is because momentum feeds on internal efficiency to accelerate and magnify its impact ‚Äì there is little ‚Äòfriction‚Äô to slow it down. Hence, the global financial system ‚Äì which is now highly integrated and driven by automated computer-based trading systems (algorithms) ‚Äì is particularly vulnerable to the momentum effect. :*The momentum-driven environment causes people and organisations to become ‚Äòswept up in the flow‚Äô. It also encourages people to behave opportunistically, with less regard for the longer-term consequences of their actions. As Roeder explains, ‚ÄòThey become ‚Äòmomentum surfers‚Äô who are willing to ride the wave rather than question its direction.‚Äô Reception The Big Mo was described by the Financial Times as ‚ÄòA compelling book that journeys seamlessly from finances to the Iraq war, from oil prices and climate change to religion and pop culture in an effort to explain how we behave and why we are so easily led.‚Äôhttp://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a2fa4a8c-39fc-11e0-a441-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3vs5lm3rj The Australian broadcaster Phillip Adams, wrote, ‚ÄòIn our personal, political and economic lives we seem to be swept along by circumstances. Our attempts to change direction are doomed. The Big Mo explains why.‚Äôhttp://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/why-momentum- rules-our- world/2975654http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/australiatalks/live- simply-connect-less/3015768 The Guardian‚Äôs Steven Poole criticized the book for 'overstretching the Newtonian-physics analogy'.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/05/steven-poole- nonfiction-choice-reviews Steven Matcham, writing in The Australian, said, ‚ÄòSpeed and size define the events of our age.

From 1935 to 1969 it supplied news and feature photos to magazines, especially Life and, later, Sports Illustrated. Formation The agency was founded in New York City at 250 Park Avenue in November 1935 by Leon Daniel and Celia Kutschuk. It pre-dates the more famous Magnum (begun in 1947). Born in the Ukraine, Kutschuk had studied photojournalism at Rhine University, and both had worked as picture editors at the Associated Press office in Berlin, which was headed by American Louis Lochner from 1928 until 1941, when Germany and the United States declared war and Lochner was held and then deported as an enemy alien. Jewish employees were sacked, and many fled Europe.\\"Leon started his career as a picture editor for the Associated Press office in Berlin. He was cofounder of Pix Publishing in New York, an independent agency mainly supplying photographs to magazines and newspapers, it was dissolved in 1969.\\" 'Obituary Leon Daniel,' The New York Times, December 31, 1974. European roots PIX acted as an intermediary between √©migr√© photographers and the American magazine and newspaper market, profiting from the development of photojournalism in the USA in the 1930s onwards.Estelle Blaschke, Photography and the Commodification of Images: from the Bettmann Archive to Corbis (1924‚Äì2010), th√®se de doctorat de l'EHESS, sous la direction d'Andr√© Gunthert et Michel Poivert, 2011, 280 p. As many of the photographers for PIX were naturalized American citizens, they were not allowed in the war theaters during WWII, so they stayed home and covered the home front, though during the Korean War and Cold War, Ed Feingersh produced striking reportage. The photographers The first-signed photographers of the agency were Alfred Eisenstaedt and Georg Karger. Eisenstaedt (1898‚Äì1995) was the best-known member of PIX and until the 1950s credited his work to PIX, Inc. He left PIX about 1957 over a royalty disagreement. Robert Capa and Cornell Capa were also briefly associated with PIX (Cornell worked as a printer in the laboratory). German George Karger (1909‚Äì1973) left banking for a career in stage photography. Jerry Cooke (b. Yuri Kutschuk, 1922‚Äì2005) was the nephew of Celia Kutschuk and initially worked in the agency darkroom before becoming a photographer and producing work for Life, Fortune, Collier's, Time, Sports Illustrated and European publications. Lawrence Fried (1926-1983), a World War II veteran, worked steadily as a photo-journalist for The Saturday Evening Post, The New York Times, Vogue, Collier's, and Parade Magazine with over 70 covers for Newsweek. He was the recipient of the Photographer of the Year award by the Overseas Press Club, the Outstanding Service to ASMP award and the Benjamin Franklin Award. Eileen Darby (Lester) (1916 ‚Äì April 21, 2004) worked in the PIX darkroom from 1937, in the same way as Cornell Capa, but from 1939 started photographing for the agency, which sent her on theatrical assignments, since players and producers were used to female photographers, and she subsequently founded her own agency, Graphic House, in 1941. Other PIX photographers included Hans Knopf (1907‚Äì1967), Ed Feingersh, Bob Schwalberg, Lawrence Fried, Bob Henriques, Garry Winogrand, and George Zimbel.  Cessation  PIX was dissolved in 1969 with the rise of television which displaced the big picture magazines and most of its members moved their business to other picture agencies. Legacy An archive of PIX photos was amassed by Emil Klinsky (1899‚Äì?), the bulk of which is now at the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), and the remainder at Spaarnestad Photo in The Hague, Netherlands.

The goal of this operation was to capture the Panamanian air force, headquartered at the airport, and to close the airport to traffic coming into Panama. The capture of Torrijos Airport was executed by the US Army rangers of 75th Ranger Regiment. Background The US had developed a three-stage plan to capture Torrijos Airport to the mission: to isolate Objective Bear (the main terminal), to eliminate enemy resistance, and to prevent the Panama Defense Force (PDF) from interfering with Operation Just Cause. The Company C could rely on fire support consisted of an AC-130 \\"Spectre\\" gunship and AH-6 attack helicopters. The American plan called for the AC-130 was to clear three .50-caliber machine gun positions and a ZPU-4 anti-aircraft position at the airport, while the AH-6s neutralised the PDF guard tower. left Initially, U.S. intelligence indicated that there were very few people in the main terminal at H-Hour. However, two international flights had just landed at the airport, which was still fully operational. As a result of this, there were actually 398 civilians in the airport rather than the few dozen that the Americans had expected to find. In addition, to this intelligence failure the PDF's 2nd Company was on alert and was patrolling in and around the airport terminal buildings. Aftermath On the morning of 20 December 1989, at approximately 7am, the Ranger company was able to linked up with units from the 82nd Airborne Division. The prisoners, detainees, and confiscated documents and weapons were turned over to the military police company commander of the 82nd Airborne Division. During the course of the operation to capture the airport only 2 rangers were wounded. Where as 5 PDF soldiers were killed and 21 were captured.

It provides the logistic support to the Indian Navy units deployed in the Northern Arabian Sea, including along the International Maritime Boundary Line with Pakistan.  History  INS Sardar Patel is the second naval base in Gujarat after INS Dwarka, which is near Okha. The name Sardar Patel has been chosen to signify the role of India‚Äôs Iron Man Vallabhai Patel, the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India. The base was commissioned on 9 May 2015 by Anandiben Patel, the Chief Minister of Gujarat. The commissioning ceremony was attended by Admiral RK Dhowan, Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral SPS Cheema, Flag Officer Commanding‚Äìin‚ÄìChief, Western Naval Command, senior naval officers and other dignitaries of the state government. Cmde BR Prakash, VSM who is the Naval Officer-in-Charge (Gujarat, Diu & Daman) is the first Commanding Officer of INS Sardar Patel.  Objective  After the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai, the Indian Navy was entrusted the responsibility of a lead agency to coordinate coastal and offshore security requirements and also augment naval presence in sensitive areas. Gujarat is a front line maritime state of India with the longest coastline of 880 nautical miles, besides sharing 532 km of land border with Pakistan. Over the preceding decade, there has been a significant growth in the maritime infrastructure along the coast of Gujarat. Many ports have come up along the coastline, which collectively handle 300 million tons of cargo annually, constituting approximately 30 per cent of the total cargo handled in the ports of India. In addition, there are 12 single point moorings (SPMs) in the Gulf of Kutch, through which about 120 million tons of crude oil is supplied to various refineries on the coast and in the hinterland, constituting 71 per cent of the oil import into the country. The creation of considerable infrastructure along the coastline makes them vulnerable from sea, not only during hostilities but also during peacetime. The commissioning of INS Sardar Patel at Porbandar enables the Navy to augment its infrastructure and organisational effectiveness in Gujarat. It will improve coordination and synergy with other maritime agencies.

Born into a ranching family, he drove cattle and ranched in New Mexico before acquired a ranch in Sherman County, Texas. He founded local banks in Texas and New Mexico, and he was tried but acquitted on suspicion of faulty loans. He retired in San Antonio, Texas. Early life William Baxter Slaughter was born in 1852 in Freestone County, Texas. His father, George Webb Slaughter, was a Baptist minister from Mississippi and early rancher in Texas. His mother was Sarah Mason. One of his brothers, C.C. Slaughter, became known as the \\"Cattle King of Texas.\\" Another brother, John Bunyan Slaughter, was also a large rancher. Slaughter grew up in Palo Pinto County, Texas. During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, he helped his father provide beef from their ranch to the Tonkawa, a Native American tribe who were aligned with the Confederate States Army. Career Slaughter went on a cattle drive to Jefferson, Texas with his brother C.C. in 1867. Two years later, in 1869, he drove cattle on the Chisholm Trail with another brother, Peter. The two men drove cattle all the way to Abilene, Kansas. In 1870, he drove 1,600 head of cattle to Kansas City, Kansas. On his way in Red Fork, Oklahoma, Slaughter and his retinue encountered members of the Osage Nation, but they quickly became friendly. In 1877, Slaughter invested in steers with his brother John. The two brothers drove the cattle to Kansas, where they sold it annually. Later, they moved to a ranch near McDonald Creek in Crosby County, Texas. They sold it in 1883, and William moved to a ranch in Sierra County, New Mexico. (Meanwhile, his brother John moved to a ranch in Socorro County, New Mexico.) However, they did not own the land and a shootout occurred between the Slaughters's cowboys and cowboys hired by Solomon Luna, another rancher, on October 30‚Äì31, 1884. William was wounded in the fight. When Luna sued the brothers, he won the lawsuit. Meanwhile, William ranched in New Mexico and drove cattle to Nebraska and Wyoming annually until 1894. He was associated with the American Valley Cattle Company of New Mexico in 1895. Meanwhile, in 1889, Slaughter began acquiring rangeland in Sherman County, Texas. The town of Coldwater, which served as the county seat of Sherman County from 1889 to 1891, was on his ranch. Later, they moved the county seat to Stratford, Texas, which was named after Stratford Hall, Confederate General Robert E. Lee's family plantation. Slaughter lost his election run for Sherman County judge to Dudley H. Snyder (John Wesley Snyder's brother) in 1900. When the latter died in 1901, Slaughter was appointed as judge. By 1905, Slaughter moved to Dalhart, Texas and opened a bank. Later, he opened another bank in Texline, Texas. In 1914, he co-founded the Bankers' Trust Company, a US$5-million bank, with his brother C.C. Meanwhile, he served as the president of the Mercantile National Bank of Pueblo. In 1916, he was sued by 30 customers over faulty loans. Slaughter was acquitted, but his brother C.C. acquired most of his cattle and ranches, and paid back his debtors. Personal life Slaughter married Anna McAdams in 1877. They had a son, Coney C. Slaughter, born in 1878. Slaughter was a Baptist. He invited Baptist preachers George Washington Truett and James Bruton Gambrell to speak to the cowboys on his ranches. Slaughter retired in Dallas, Texas, before moving to San Antonio, Texas, where he was an active member of the Trail Drivers' Association. Death Slaughter died on March 28, 1929 in San Antonio, Texas. He was buried in Pino Pinto, Texas. His son was jailed for embezzlement at the Leavenworth Penitentiary until 1930, and he committed suicide in 1932.

On 20 December US paratroopers launched a surprise attack against the Panamanian Army at Rio Hato, the largest PDF military base, approximately seventy miles south of Panama City. The objective of the attack was to capture the PDF garrison at the base, secure the airfield runway, and seize Manuel Noriega's beachside house. The Battle left At H-hour two F-117A stealth fighter-bombers delivered two 2,000-lb. precision bombs in an attempt to stun and confuse the PDF garrison of two heavily armed infantry companies defending the airfield. Instead of landing at their targets both bombs set off nearby waking the garrison. The PDF 6th and 7th Rifle companies numbered at 520 troops in all. In addition to this the 7th company was known to be a \\"part of Noriega's best trained and most loyal forces\\". Thirteen C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, having flown nonstop from the United States, parachuted in two battalions of rangers from a dangerously low altitude of 500 feet. The paratroopers suffered casualties when they received fire in the air and a dozen were injured while landing. Gathering quickly in the darkness, two companies of rangers fanned out to isolate the airfield, cut the Pan-American Highway running through it, and seize a nearby ammunition dump. Meanwhile, another company attacked a nearby NCO academy complex and yet another struck the two PDF companies deployed to defend the airfield. The fighting turned into a ferocious exchange of fire, with the ground fire of the rangers heavily reinforced by support from an AC-130 \\"Spectre\\" gunship and several attack helicopters. The contested buildings fell in room-to-room fighting following a liberal use of grenades and automatic rifles at close ranges. The Battle of Rio Hato Airfield in total, went on for roughly five hours, by which time the rangers had secured Rio Hato, as well as Noriega‚Äôs lavish beach house nearby. However, in one case of mistaken identity, a US attack helicopter mistook a squad of rangers for a group of PDF and fired, killing two rangers and wounding four rangers. Casualties The U.S military lost 4 killed, 18 wounded, and 26 injured in the jump. At Rio Hato, the PDF lost 34 soldiers killed, 362 captured, and a huge inventory of weapons abandoned. Around 200 PDF soldiers managed to flee into the countryside and evade capture.

It is situated on the border between Russia and Finland at about the midpoint from south to north. The park is located in the Republic of Karelia, 30 km north of the town of Kostomuksha. The Kalevala, an epic poem of Finnish and Karelian oral folklore, was drawn from this region. The traditional people of the area include the Sami people and the Karelians. Topography The territory of the park is on the southeast of the Baltic Shield, which contains the oldest rocks in Europe (3 billion year-ol Precambrian crystalline granites, gneisses, and similar), covered by a very young layer (20‚Äì30 meters) of glacial deposits. During the recent Pleistocene glaciation, heavy continental ice sheets scoured and depressed the region, leaving as they melted a flat landscape of lakes and rivers. The western portion of the park is mostly flat (and generally waterlogged) forest, while the eastern section has more hills and ridges; the altitude in the park ranges between 105 meters and 278 meters. Due to the valuable mineral profile, mining is the main industry in the area, with logging also important. The park records 250 streams, and 400 lakes. Only about 100 of the lakes has an area greater than 10 hectares. The cover of the park is 85% forest, 9% marsh, and 6% lakes and rivers. The wetland systems are complex, and peat underlies much of the territory, in parts reaching a depth in some bogs of 6 meters. The forest are mostly pine, with about 10% spruce, and some small stands of birch and aspen on the sites of former farms. Kalevalsky National Park borders (green), Finnish border (purple) Climate The climate of Kalevalsky is Subarctic climate, without dry season (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate (Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1‚Äì3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ). The number of days with snow cover is 170-180; the number of frost-free days is 80‚Äì95 days. Ecoregion The terrestrial ecoregion of Kalevansky is Scandinavian and Russian taiga (WWF ID#608), a region characterized by coniferous forests taiga. The freshwater ecoregion is classified as \\"Barents Sea Drainages\\" (FEOW ID#407), characterized by migratory species, low levels of endemism, and high numbers of species introduced by humans. FEOW notes that \\"The fish fauna is formed from immigrants of Atlantic and Siberian origins with only a weak assemblage of primary freshwater European species; thus, a \\"mixed\\" nature of the fish fauna is its main distinguishing feature\\".

He is currently the Secretary General of the International Organisation of the Muslim Brotherhood and the spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood in the West. He became the acting general leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in September 2020.  Early years  Ibrahim Munir Mustafa was born on 1 June 1937 in Giza, Egypt. His full name is Ahmed Ibrahim Munir Mustafa. He joined the Muslim Brotherhood at an early age and was sentenced to life imprisonment in Egypt in the 1950s following the attempted assassination of the Egyptian leader Gamal Abd al-Nasser. Mustafa was released in 1975 and left for the Persian Gulf region and moved to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. He applied for political asylum which was granted.  United Kingdom  Since Mustafa arrived in the United Kingdom he has become active in Muslim Brotherhood activities not only promoting the causes of his own movement but also more general Islamic causes. He was a director at the Islamic charity Human Relief International, the Takaful Trust and The Renaissance Foundation in the 1990s. In an interview with Asharq al-Awsat in 2011 he said that he had not visited Egypt since 1987. The activities of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and the International Organisation of the Muslim Brotherhood are coordinated from the Muslim Brotherhood office at Cricklewood Broadway in London. From the Cricklewood Broadway office the Muslim Brotherhood also publishes its weekly Arabic language newsletter Risalat al- Ikhwan of which Ibrahim Munir Mustafa is the general supervisor and his deputy Mahmoud El-Abiary the chief editor.  2010 Court Case  In 2010 then Egyptian Attorney General Abdul Magid Mahmoud referred a case against Muslim Brotherhood leader abroad to the State Supreme Security Emergency Court for trial. One of the defendants in the case was Ibrahim Munir Mustafa. He was previously acquitted by lower courts in Egypt in a case known as the Global Network. Among the charges were money laundering and raising funds abroad for an outlawed group. Mustafa was tried in absence and was convicted to a sentence of 5 years in jail. In a response to the sentence by the Egypt court Mustafa said that \\"he respected the Egyptian judiciary but the regime obliged him to do so, noting that international justice is sufficient to prove his innocence and he denies any false accusations fabricated by the Egyptian regime.\\" Within a day of the sentence in Egypt Ibrahim Munir Mustafa had appealed that sentence before a British court which was going to hear his case within a month. \\"I was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on charges of money laundering before a state security court emergency on Saturday\\". He also pointed out that \\"he would resort to the international court of justice to prove his innocence.\\" With all the strict regulations on money transfers he said it was difficult to launder money from the UK to Egypt, according to Mustafa.  Erbakan Funeral in 2011  In early March 2011, former Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan died and was buried in Istanbul. The burial of Erbakan brought a large delegation of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood to Istanbul and included former Supreme Guide of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Mahdi Akef, Mahmoud Ezzat, Saad El-Katatni, Ayman Aly, Youssef Nada and also Ibrahim Munir Moustafa and his deputy Mahmoud El-Abiary.  Mustafa since the ouster of Egyptian President Morsi  Since the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat which ousted Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi the London office of the Muslim Brotherhood has become the de facto headquarters for the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood outside Egypt, with Ibrahim Munir Mustafa in a leading position. Since the Muslim Brotherhood lost power in Egypt the position of Mustafa has become more visible. On 17 July 2013, Mustafa wrote an Op-Ed in Asharq al-Awsat where he claimed that Morsi's ouster was in fact a military coup. Also on social media Ibrahim Munir Mustafa can be seen attending many demonstration in London organised by different organisations often close to the Muslim Brotherhood under the umbrella the UK Anti-Coup Alliance often showing the Rabia sign.  Jenkins Report on the Muslim Brotherhood  In April 2014 British Prime Minister David Cameron commissioned an internal review of the Muslim Brotherhood, including its origins, ideology, record in and out of government; and its organisation and activities in the UK and abroad. The investigation started earlier. In June 2014 Ibrahim Munir Mustafa was to meet with Sir John Jenkins who led the U.K. government's review of the Muslim Brotherhood. Mustafa said about the review: \\"Regardless of the outcome of the review, we will adhere to our principles ‚Äì and the main one is acting peacefully,\\" he added. \\"We will abide by British law, but history will judge this action. I expect this review will clear the name of the Brotherhood. But if the result is negative, we will deal with it legally.\\" In the released findings of the review of the Muslim Brotherhood by the U.K. government, Mustafa is not mentioned by name but it is clear that the review team spoke with him. \\"The most senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood permanently resident in the UK told the review team that he coordinated some Muslim Brotherhood international activity, but not Muslim Brotherhood activity in this country.\\"  Acting general leader of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood  In August 2015, Ibrahim Munir Mustafa denied reports that had surfaced in Egyptian and Arab newspapers that he had become the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood's new deputy Supreme Guide and acting Supreme Guide. He released a statement: \\"I stress that Dr Mahmoud Ezzat is still the deputy supreme guide and acting supreme guide. With regards my being assigned the duties of the deputy supreme guide, I had been tasked with this some time ago and it is not new.\\" On 4 September 2020, he was appointed as the acting general leader of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood after Ezzat was arrested.

The school was founded in 1983. Girls' College is a member of the Association of Trust Schools and the Head is a member of the Conference of Heads of Independent Schools in Zimbabwe. History The Girls' College Trust was formed in September 1982 for the purpose of establishing a private, multi-racial, interdenominational secondary school for girls in Bulawayo. In January 1983, Girls' College opened with an initial enrollment of seventy-five Form One pupils and six teachers with Ross Fuller as the headmaster of the institution. The school is located at what was the Queens Court residential hotel, which had closed down in 1982. The introduction of Forms Two and Three took place in May 1983 and the first sitting for Cambridge O level examinations at the school was in November 1984. The Sixth Form was introduced in 1985 with the first sitting for Cambridge A level examinations. Girls' College grew in terms of enrollment and infrastructure. The Ross Fuller Hall was opened in 1991, surrounding residences were bought and turned into hostels. A building across the road from the main school premises was acquired and named Palmer House with the purpose of establishing commercial classes. Another building, adjacent to Palmer House was constructed for art and IT subjects. Tennis courts and a swimming pool were also constructed. A 'Garden of Remembrance' was also built on the main school premise to commemorate teachers and pupils who had died. Mr Fuller retired in 2003 and was succeeded by Mrs Hazel Vorster. Upon her resignation in 2007, she was temporarily replaced by Mr Todd until Mrs Ross was ready to take her place as headmistress in 2008.

It was a sugarcane plantation, with 101 African slaves by 1860. In December 1863, during the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865, Confederate States Army General John B.

University of Nebraska Press, 1994, p. 176. After the war, paid laborers were supplemented by convicts. For example, in 1876, Hawkins employed 37 convicts. In the wake of the invention of barbed wire, the plantation gradually became a cattle ranch. Wells and trails were built throughout the ranch. Most cattle are a crossbreed of Hereford and Brahman cattle. In 1919, Hamill and Associates conducted a test to determine whether oil existed on the ranch, but drilling did not continue. Orbit Petroleum operated gas wells on the ranch for several years. Gas wells were shut in by the Texas Railroad Commission as a result of Hurricane Rita in 2005, and they were reopened in 2007.

The protein is a copper-containing primary amine oxidase enzyme. Function Copper amine oxidases catalyze the oxidative conversion of amines to aldehydes and ammonia in the presence of copper and quinone cofactor. This gene shows high sequence similarity to copper amine oxidases from various species ranging from bacteria to mammals. The protein contains several conserved motifs including the active site of amine oxidases and the histidine residues that likely bind copper. It may be a critical modulator of signal transmission in retina, possibly by degrading the biogenic amines dopamine, histamine, and putrescine.

She is the first, and to date, only woman to serve in either position. Published in 2014 by Random House Australia, My Story reflects on various personal aspects of her life and career, including her own analysis of the people and key players of the Rudd- Gillard Governments (2007‚Äì2013).  Summary and themes  My Story covers much of Gillard's political career as the Federal Parliamentary Member for Lalor from 1998 to 2013. The autobiography's focal point is Gillard's rise to power within the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Parliament, as the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia following the 2007 federal election, and her tumultuous tenure as Prime Minister following the 2010 Australian Labor Party leadership spill against Labor leader and then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Her memoir, analyses her achievements and recognises the failures of the Gillard Government. Gillard is critical of Rudd and his supporters for what she believed was their constant undermining of her prime ministership which led to two unsuccessful leadership challenges throughout her tenure, followed by a successful leadership spill in June 2013, which saw her ousted as Prime Minister and replaced by Rudd. The Liberal‚ÄìNational Coalition, led by then- Opposition Leader Tony Abbott also received criticism for their \\"hostile\\" and \\"negative\\" approach to opposition; Gillard detailed her motivations and reactions towards to the 2012 Misogyny Speech she delivered, in which she accused Abbott of sexism and misogyny. The memoir is split into two sections. The first section, entitled \\"How I Did It\\", comprises the circumstances in how she challenged Rudd for the leadership of the Labor Party, as well the issues she faced during her governance. The second and longer section of the autobiography, \\"Why I Did It\\", details her life and the policy achievements of her government. Since its release in 2014, Gillard has released new editions of My Story, as to encapsulate related events which had since occurred post her prime-ministership, such as the leadership spills within the Liberal Party of Australia, which saw the demise of Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the election of Malcolm Turnbull as leader of the Liberal Party, and Prime Minister of Australia in September 2015.  Reception  The 504-page political memoir was released in September 2014 by Random House, almost a year‚Äìand‚Äìa‚Äìhalf after Gillard's departure from Australian politics. The former Governor-General of Australia Quentin Bryce (2008‚Äì14) launched My Story at an event that was attended by various Labor party figures, including Gillard's former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan, Greg Combet, Craig Emerson, Tanya Plibersek, Kate Ellis, Tony Burke; in addition to former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and former state premiers, Anna Bligh (Queensland), John Brumby (Victoria) and Kristina Keneally (New South Wales). Gillard's memoirs sold 5,000 copies during its first week, according to Random House. In response to Gillard's criticism of his leadership and his conduct following the 2010 leadership challenge, Rudd released a statement. In it, his media spokeswoman said, \\"Consistent with the past, Mr Rudd has no substantive comment to make on Ms Gillard's latest contribution to Australian fiction...The Australian people have long reached their own conclusions about Ms Gillard's relationship with the truth ‚Äì from the coup to the carbon tax. They have also reached their own conclusions on Ms Gillard's continuing efforts to reconstruct a justification after the event for her actions in June 2010, by trying to dress up personal political ambition as some higher purpose for the party and the government.\\" In the book, Senator Nick Xenophon was said to have been '\\"infamously excluded from university for a period as punishment for stuffing a ballot box full of voting papers he had somehow procured\\", which was denied by Xenophon. In February 2015, Random House issued a public apology to Xenophon and paid a confidential cash settlement. Xenophon continued to request a personal apology from Gillard. On 6 August 2015, Gillard published a personal apology to Xenophon in a number of Australian newspapers. The book has received generally favourable reviews, with The Conversation noting \\"For those looking for a tell-all confession of the life and loves of Julia Gillard, My Story will disappoint. For readers seeking Gillard's views of the first Rudd government and the rise and fall of her own government, there is plenty of meat here.\\" Feminist and writer Anne Summers praised the autobiography for its knowledge on the mechanisms of government in a review with The Australian, \\"As a primer on how government works, My Story is on a par with the cabinet diaries of Clyde Cameron, Peter Howson, Neal Blewett and Gareth Evans. It's as comprehensive, but more personal, than [Prime Minister John Howard's] Lazarus Rising.\\" In 2015, Gillard's memoir was shortlisted for the category of 2015 Biography of the Year by the Australian Book Industry Awards. My Story was the highest selling politics-related book in 2014, selling 62,000 copies.

It is owned and managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire.Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire: Rothwell Gullet. Retrieved 31 December 2015. The reserve is composed of an old ironstone quarry and a grassland area. It is well known for the swathes of hart's-tongue fern that cover the damp bottom of the gullet. Wildlife Rothwell Gullet contains two primary habitat types, grassland and woodland. When quarrying of the site ceased, the gullet was left and natural succession has since created a dense woodland. Owing to the damp nature of the exposed rock faces in the bottom of the gullet, it has become colonised by hart's-tongue fern. To the west of the gullet, a grassland area surrounded by scrub and hedgerows supports a variety of plants including meadow vetchling and hop trefoil. Management The woodland area is thinned to maintain structural diversity and encourage ground flora. Grazing of livestock during the autumn and winter removes excess vegetation in the grassland area and prevents scrub encroachment.

Jardim has served under four out of six Prime Ministers of Cura√ßao. Before becoming Minister Jardim was secretary general of the Ministry of Finance between October 2010 and April 2012. Early life and career Jardim was born on 24 April 1973 on Cura√ßao. He completed his vwo-education at the Radulphus College in 1991. He studied general economics and obtained a degree in 1996 and a further post-doc degree in 2007. In 2012 Jardim earned a PhD in Economics from the Instituto Superior de Economia e Gest√£o, at the Technical University of Lisbon. He wrote his thesis on the relationship between the restructuring of state finances and the informal economy. After his initial studies Jardim worked for the Banco de Portugal and later the Directorate of Finances of the Netherlands Antilles. He held different functions there and eventually became director. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles he became secretary general of the Ministry of Finance of Cura√ßao. As the Netherlands cleared most of the country's debt at independence the country started with a blank slate. George Jamaloodin became the Finance Minister in the cabinet of Gerrit Schotte and had to deal with issues as pensions, costs of healthcare and education and the number of civil servants which were a threat to the country's future financial position. In his capacity as secretary general Jardim advised Jamaloodin but felt that his advice was not heard. Jardim cited refusing to see that Cura√ßao was heading to bankruptcy as Jamaloodin's biggest flaw. Discontent with the approach to the finances of the country Jardim resigned as secretary general in April 2012. Political career Shortly after his resignation, the Netherlands indicated to Cura√ßao that it needed to fix its budget for the coming year and the government of Schotte fell. Jardim was asked to join the cabinet of interim Prime Minister Stanley Betrian as Finance Minister, which he agreed to. The cabinet was sworn in on 29 September 2012. On 31 December 2012 the cabinet of Daniel Hodge was installed, in which Jardim was the only minister to return from the Betrian cabinet. After the interim period of the Hodge cabinet Jardim continued in the same position in the cabinet of Ivar Asjes, and was sworn in on 7 June 2013. After the one year mark of the Asjes cabinet several members of the Estates of Cura√ßao were in general unhappy with the results made, Eug√®ne Cleopa of the majority Partido pa Adelanto I Inovashon Soshal and opposition member Armin Konket of the Party for the Restructured Antilles both praised Jardim for bringing the country's finances back on track. When Earl Balborda resigned as Minister of Traffic, Transport and Urban Planning in March 2015, Jardim took over his post in an interim capacity. After Prime Minister Asjes resigned in August 2015 he was succeeded by Ben Whiteman, Jardim continued as Minister of Finance. He was reappointed in the second Whiteman cabinet on 30 November. Jardim was Minister on the behalf of Glenn Sulvaran, an independent member of the Estates of Cura√ßao who formerly belonged to the Party for the Restructured Antilles. Jardim was replaced by Kenneth Gijsbertha in the Hensley Koeiman cabinet which was installed on 23 December 2016. Policies For the 2012‚Äì2013 period under the two interim-cabinets it was clear that the country's finances needed to be improved. Under Jardim the country raised the age of retirement from 60 to 65, raised pension premiums. An income-dependent healthcare premium was introduced. It furthermore saw a tax-increase on luxury and harmful goods. Apart from these measures Jardim intended to introduce stimuli to the economy. In August 2015 a redesign of the sales tax was planned.

Based in Perth, his work often mixes with his interests in music, travel and volunteering. Seng frequently collaborates with English singer Passenger, serving as his tour photographer on seven tours between 2012 and 2015, as well as directing many of his music videos. Seng has also toured with American band Matchbox Twenty and Australian folk singer Stu Larsen. His personal photographic work has seen him traveling to both Tanzania and Iceland twice. Seng has held four solo exhibitions ‚Äî Portraits of Tanzania (2011), Alltervatn (2013), Spirit of the Masaai (2014) and The Space Between (2015) ‚Äî and a collaborative exhibition, Parallels (2016), with Perth-based artist Amok Island. Seng received international media coverage in December 2014 after a prank video, in which he walked around a music festival disguised as American DJ Steve Aoki, went viral. In 2013, Seng was a finalist in the Propel Youth Arts Award category at the 2013 WA Youth Awards. Seng competed in season four of Australian Survivor, which began airing in late July 2017. Early life Seng was born in the rural Western Australian mining town of Newman. His father, Kim, is Malaysian and his mother, Alice, is a Christmas Islander of Chinese descent. The family moved to Mandurah when Seng was three years old. He attended primary and high school at Frederick Irwin Anglican School, graduating in 2005. After high school, Seng began studying law at the University of Western Australia (UWA) but found it did not fit his creative nature and soon switched to an arts and commerce degree. From 2008 to 2011, Seng worked in a range of roles at St George's College, the residential college he was living at, including Arts Representative on the College Club Committee, Student Director of Music and as an Arts Tutor in 2011. Career Although Seng always had an interest in photography, he never had any formal photography education. Seng began his photography career in 2009 while he was the music editor and writer for Pelican, the UWA student newspaper. While filling in the media accreditation form for the West Coast Blues & Roots Festival, Seng surreptitiously ticked the box for a photographer's pass even though he was only supposed to be there as a writer. Seng borrowed a friend's camera and researched how to take photos on the Internet. The photos turned out decently, leading Seng to buy his own camera and continue pursuing photography. Seng soon found photography could further his interests in music, travel and volunteering. Seng says he \\"fell in love with the idea of capturing the beauty of the world on film\\" while volunteering at a school in Nepal in 2009. In 2009, Seng also started a marketing internship at the Perth International Arts Festival, allowing him to photograph events and begin to get his work noticed. Seng frequently collaborates with English singer Passenger, both as his tour photographer and director of many of his music videos Since 2012, Seng has served as a tour photographer for a number of musicians and bands. Seng has been the tour photographer for English singer Passenger on seven tours between 2012 and 2015. In 2013, Seng toured with American rock band Matchbox Twenty on their Australian tour. An ebook, Going North, was released featuring Seng's photographs and written accounts of the tour experience. He also toured with Australian folk singer Stu Larsen on his 2014 European tour. In addition to music photography, Seng has also directed many music videos for Passenger, as well as music videos for Emma Stevens, Stu Larsen and Patrick James. In October 2014, Seng's photo of an Amity Affliction concert in Perth won the 2014 Monster Children Photo Comp in the music category, winning him $5,000. In April 2015, a short film directed by Seng to promote North Queensland won a competition run by Tropical North Queensland Tourism, winning a $20,000 prize package. In 2013, Seng was a finalist in the Propel Youth Arts Award category at the 2013 WA Youth Awards. He placed 32nd in the 2017 Australia's Top 50 Influencer Awards. Seng was the subject of an episode of the ABC program On Assignment which was released on ABC iview in September 2015. He was also featured in a video released in March 2017 promoting the Microsoft Surface Book. =Photography exhibitions= In 2011, Seng travelled to Tanzania to volunteer at a school and orphanage. On the weekends, Seng would visit various villages and photograph candid portraits of the Maasai people. The photographs formed his first solo exhibition, Portraits of Tanzania. Seng travelled to Iceland in 2012 to take aerial photographs of the country's volcanic river systems. He hired a two-seater plane and photographed out the plane's window. \\"Every time I wanted to open the window my body disagreed. Opening the window meant pain. It meant a rush of cold air coming in. [‚Ä¶] So by the end I had to psych myself up and really pick my moments,\\" Seng said of the experience. The photographs were showcased in 2013 at Seng's second solo exhibition, Alltervatn. In 2013, Seng returned to Tanzania to help film a short documentary about the orphanage and shoot more portraits, this time focusing on the Maasai children. The portraits were featured in 2014 at Seng's third solo exhibition, Spirit of the Maasai. The documentary, My African Home, won the award for Best Documentary Short at the 2015 Winter Los Angeles Movie Awards. While in Tanzania, Seng also tracked down the Maasai people he had photographed two years earlier and presented them with canvas prints of their earlier selves. Seng returned to Iceland in 2015 to take a series of self-portraits against the country's landscape. Seng said the portraits explore \\"the sense of feeling both significant and totally insignificant simultaneously in the presence of nature's grandeur.\\" The series of 12 photos formed his fourth solo exhibition, The Space Between. In December 2016, together with Perth-based artist Amok Island, Seng held his first collaborative exhibition, Parallels. The exhibition featured Seng's aerial photographs of Rottnest Island's coastline, alongside Amok Island's interpretations of the photos as minimal, geometric paintings. =Other projects= Since 2013, Seng has participated in the Perth Fashion Festival's annual Windows of the City competition which sees Perth creatives partnered with a local business to create a store window display. In 2013, Seng worked with artist Annabelle Gordon on a paper cut display for the Sneaky Monkey Cafe at Raine Square. For his 2014 window display for Telstra's Hay Street store, titled Perth24 ‚Äî A Portrait of the City, Seng spent 24 hours taking 300 portraits of people on the streets of Perth. In 2015, Seng created a photo installation for The Flour Factory, a bar on Queen Street. In 2014, Seng created The Hidden Sound, a planned series of music gigs where the artist and venue remained secret until the last minute. Australian singer-songwriter Kate Miller-Heidke performed the first gig in August 2014. Seng received international media coverage in December 2014 after a prank video he uploaded to YouTube and Facebook went viral. The video depicts Seng walking around the Stereosonic music festival in Perth disguised as American DJ Steve Aoki, whom Seng is occasionally mistaken for. Festivalgoers are seen calling out Aoki's name and taking photos with Seng and Seng is shown dancing in the crowd while the real Steve Aoki is performing on stage. Aoki saw the video and the following weekend, at the Melbourne Stereosonic, Seng and Aoki conducted another prank, with Seng dressed up as Aoki and Aoki posing as his photographer. In May 2015, following earthquakes in Nepal, Seng raised $10,000 for the Australian Red Cross by fulfilling various requests from individuals and businesses over a 24-hour period including taking photos, giving a talk to photography students and streaking through Hay Street in the Perth CBD. Seng competed in season four of the reality game show Australian Survivor, which was filmed in Samoa and began airing on 30 July 2017. He was the 13th contestant voted out, making it to day 36. Seng said \\"It was so surreal, to be involved as a player on this show that I've been watching for years and years. It was really great, but it was really brutal as well, and that's what I loved.\\" Personal life Since 2015, Seng has been dating Rebecca Williams, a former Miss Universe WA finalist.

It was first published in January 2015; the English translation by Richard Dixon appeared in November 2015. It is a satire of the tabloid press,Terry Eagleton, Times Literary Supplement, 4 December 2015 set in Italy in 1992. Plot summary The story is told by Colonna, a hack journalist, now in his fifties, and a loser. He is hired by Simei to work on a newspaper called Domani (Tomorrow) that will never be published. The venture is financed by Commendator Vimercate, who owns a television channel, a dozen magazines and runs a chain of hotels and rest homes. The declared aim of the newspaper is to reveal the truth about everything, to publish all the news that‚Äôs fit to print \\"plus a little more,\\" but Commendator Vimercate‚Äôs true interest lies elsewhere. His \\"zero issues\\" will be seen by powerful figures high up in the world of finance and politics who don‚Äôt want the truth to be revealed. They‚Äôll put pressure on Vimercate to close down the newspaper and, in return, will allow him into the inner sanctum of power. Colonna meets the other members of the editorial staff: Braggadocio used to work for a scandal magazine called What They Never Tell Us; Cambria spent his nights as a hack reporter hanging around police stations; Lucidi probably works for the secret service; Palatino has spent his career working on puzzle and crossword magazines; Costanza was a sub-editor for various newspapers until they grew so large that no one bothered any longer to check what was being printed; lastly, Maia Fresia worked on a celebrity romance magazine. Colonna is befriended by Braggadocio, a paranoid who sees conspiracies all around him. He tells Colonna he is investigating a story about Mussolini that would sell a hundred thousand copies of Domani. He has a theory that Mussolini managed to avoid being killed during the last days of World War II‚Äîthe corpse strung up in Milan was a double, the real Mussolini was smuggled away by Church authorities and spent his final years in Argentina (or perhaps behind the walls of the Vatican) waiting for a Fascist coup that might restore him to power. At the same time, Colonna starts a romantic relationship with Maia, who is a smart and sharp-witted but eccentric young woman, and Braggadocio suspects she may have autism. Eco‚Äôs plot is woven around a succession of events from the final days of the Second World War to the terrorist attacks of the 1970s, with references to many figures from the past seventy years of Italian history: fascists and partisans, presidents and prime ministers (Aldo Moro, Francesco Cossiga, Giulio Andreotti), popes (John Paul I and John Paul II), bankers (Michele Sindona, Roberto Calvi, Cardinal Marcinkus) and secret organizations (Special Operations Executive, CIA, Operation Gladio and the Red Brigades).

Similar in scope to the first 1614 C√°ida da Praia earthquake that destroyed most of the community, this second event is noted for the systematic process to assistance, document and catalogue the events of the tragedy. History The earthquake began on the morning of 12 June 1841, and was centred in the Ramo Grande area of the island of Terceira. The numerous earthquakes persisted throughout the day, and lead to intense rumbling on 13 June, resulting in the destruction of buildings and forcing people from their homes in Praia and nearby parishes. The 1641 catastrophe was already vivid in the minds of most, perpetuated by the Romantic prose of Francisco de Segura, and the townsfolk were already helped by innovative decrees issued by King Philip II after the events of the earlier tragedy. Still, on the morning of 14 of June, new earthquakes resulted in further destruction. Around 3:25 on the morning of 15 June, a violent earthquake caused the destruction of Praia and in Fontinhas, with general damage in eastern and northeast of Terceira, around Vila de S√£o Sebasti√£o and Agualva. From the beach until Cruz do Marco, a fissure opened-up, marking the fault that existed. The most damage occurred in Fontinhas, a parish where most of the buildings were affected. Relief efforts Since most of the townsfolk had abandoned their homes, there were no deaths, but hundreds of buildings were damaged in Santa Cruz, Fontinhas, Lajes, S√£o Br√°s, Vila Nova, Agualva, Cabo da Praia, Porto Martins, Fonte do Bastardo and S√£o Sebasti√£o. F√©lix Jos√© da Costa J√∫nior, then secretary to the civil governor and the man responsible for providing assist to the victims of the disaster, eventually wrote Mem√≥ria Hist√≥rica do Horr√≠vel Terramoto de 1841, wherein he described the circumstances and affects on the parishes of the Ramo Grande region from the earthquake: *S√£o Sebasti√£o ‚Äî town erected in 1503, situated a mile from the sea, and two leagues and a half east of the city of Angra do Hero√≠smo. There are 252 homes and 1511 souls: there are 14 houses that were ruined, and 154 with serious damage, principally those that are on the northeast frontier. The Matriz church became cut, along the presbytery, and the three branch hermitages also suffered. *Fonte do Bastardo ‚Äî in this parish, that has 146 homes and 639 souls, walls are rare, that have not be demolished, presents six houses totally ruined, and 32 gravely damaged. The house of the Reverend Vicar, the best there, and constructed two years earlier received a violent concussion in the right side, from the port of Praia, that fell to the left. The Church suffered some damage. I observed that the arch of the altar was faltering, and it was that the impulse, that could open a door, between the principal sacristy and the minor sacristy. *Cabo da Praia ‚Äî situated a league south of Praia, which has 205 homes and 962 souls, presented five houses in ruin, and 70 gravely damaged. The Church suffered great damage in the tower, which fell; and the walls of the cemetery were totally destroyed. *Lagens ‚Äî There are 577 homes and 2663 souls. There 12 houses that were totally ruined, and 60 with grave damage. The church, with the concussion opened a few cracks in its walls, had its nave greatly weakened, and belltower cracked. The hermitage of Rem√©dios appeared to be slashed. Almost all the divisionary walls were down. *Fontinhas ‚Äî There are 242 houses and 1066 souls. There 137 houses that were totally ruined, and 88 com great ruined. The demolition of the buildings, due to the position that they fell, show that the great concussion came from the northeast, and that the vertical shock affect the foundations. *Vila Nova ‚Äî There are 247 houses and 1203 souls; and presented three houses totally in ruin, and 81 with grave ruins: almost all the chimneys, in their majority, fell. The church also suffered, as with the hermitage of Ajuda, which belong to the majorat of the Baron of Noronha. *Agualva ‚Äî There are 267 houses, 1186 souls. There were two houses in total ruin, and 30 gravely ruined. The belltower of the church inclined to the north. Above Outeiro do Filipe many of the divisionary walls fell, as I observed on 4 July, when I crossed those fields to examine the roads. By 1836, the archipelago of the Azores was divided into three districts, due to this politico-administrative reorganization resulting from the Liberal Reforms there were new bodies that emerged to assist in causes of emergency, and specifically, natural disasters common in the Azores.Jo√£o (1991), p. 227 Aftermath When the town of Praia and surrounding parishes were ruined by the earthquake, management of the disaster and reconstruction was already secured by the Administrator-General of the district of Angra do Hero√≠smo, Jos√© Silvestre Ribeiro, and by administrative officials of the Civil Governor.Costa J√∫nior (1841)Monjardino (1844)Arquivo dos A√ßores (1981), p.5Arquivo dos A√ßores (1981), p.454‚Äì461Arquivo dos A√ßores (1982), p.9Arquivo dos A√ßores (1982), p.434‚Äì437 In order to handle the calamity, Jos√© Silvestre Ribeiro created a network of commissions at the parish-level, so-called Comiss√µes de Soccorros, presided by their respective parish priest, with rigorous instructions from a central Comiss√£o dos Soccorros. The parameters for the reconstruction were defined by change and innovation: :What is needed is that the town of Praia should become better constructed then before...what is desired is that one day they should say, If here passed a genie of destruction, then afterward there came hands of goodwill and constructive, that built from the ruins buildings, that become more beautiful and solid...That, to turn the most famous and more regular the notable town of Praia, provide better direction to its roads, or repair whatever deffect, then before known, it was necessary to make a few expenses, then the Commission will not hesitate...Monjardino (1844), p.2/3 The Commission then ordered that the construction of houses of straw should desist, a characteristic that was common at the time and that produced a poor, melancholy skyline. From this point forward, the characteristic tiled rooftop became the norm in the region. At the same time, the Commission issued instructions on the form and style to be applied in the reconstruction of the buildings; there were provisions stating that buildings should be symmetrical, uniform and proportional along each road, repairing errors in construction that had perpetuated in the village, including squares, roads and homes. In order to guarantee financial resources, Jos√© Silvestre Ribeiro requested funds from the municipal councils of his district (on the islands of Terceira, Graciosa and S√£o Jorge) in addition to soliciting assistance from the districts of Ponta Delgada and Horta. The philanthropic movement extended to the Portuguese capital and many of the districts in the Kingdom, where small commissions were created to collect funds to assist the village.Costa J√∫nior (1841), p.23Monjardino (1844), p.1‚Äì2 For this mobilization, Praia da Vit√≥ria itself contributed to its own cause: national elites considered the town a national monument and sacred land for the Liberal cause.Costa J√∫nior (1841) p.38 Cultural societies and recreational groups extended the network, linking the Terceirense town to various groups in Europe and Brazil, who also sent contributions.Costa J√∫nior (1841), p.38 A 20 February 1844 report published the public projects completed on public buildings and houses, classifying them as to the economic condition of their residents (poor and less disadvantaged) and the type of intervention (new building or repairs). Thirty-three homes constructed of straw were constructed in tile.Monjardino (1844), p.79‚Äì80 Between 1841 and 1845, there a social change, resulting in rebuilding, change and innovation after the earthquake, organized by the district powers, that articulated the pleas for help to the archipelago, national government, European powers and Brazil.

The road is almost entirely above 2000 metres altitude and so is only open from June 1 to October 31. It runs along the ridge that separates the Val Chisone and Susa valley and passes several mountain passes between these valleys including Colle dell'Assietta (2,474 m), Colle Blegier (2,381 m), Colle Costa Piana (2,313 m), Colle Bourget (2,299 m) and Col Basset (2,424 m). The road was built in the late 1800s for military purposes, and the ruins of forts still remain. Today, some farmers use the road to access their land, but the primary use is by tourists, particularly people on touring motorbikes and mountain bikes. The surface is rough dirt and rock and is generally only wide enough for one vehicle.

From left to right: justice, trade, church, and construction. Portrait of the Capitouls Named by Writ of Parliament, 28 November 1622, by Jean Chalette. Capitol's chapel. The Chateau Narbonnais in the 19th century. The capitouls, sometimes anglicized as capitols, were the chief magistrates of the commune of Toulouse, France, during the late Middle Ages and early Modern period. Their council and rule was known as the Capitoulate (). They were suppressed in 1789 amid the French Revolution. Name The officials were originally known as consuls () but were christened \\"capitouls\\" in 1295 as part of an effort to connect Toulouse with the greatness of such cities as Rome, Constantinople, and Jerusalem. Rival councils In addition to the Capitoulate, Toulouse housed the rival Parliament, General Council, Town Council, and Council of Sixteen. Each included the reigning capitouls, but only as associate or junior members. The Parliament of Toulouse (') was established by King Charles VII in 1420. and put on a permanent basis in 1444. It was nominally restricted to the nobility, although positions could be purchased via an annual fee known as the paulette. Members () were exempt from gabelles, city property taxes, and tithes; exempt from billeting of troops; and exempt from any legal proceeding except those within the Parliament itself. It also served as a bastion of Catholicism and, after 1548, was charged with operating the town's chambre ardente, which persecuted Protestant \\"heretics\\". It also built up an influential body of lawyers ( and ) around its operations. The General or Common Council () was formed of a large body of notables, including representatives of the Catholic archdiocese, the major local chapters, and university, several lawyers, townsmen, and the present and former capitouls. In the 16th century, this made up almost eighty men but this changed over time: by the 17th century, the church and tradesmen had been almost removed from representation. Meanwhile, the Parliament went from having no representation in 1550 to eight members including the First President in 1556 to being forbidden to meet without the members of Parliament present in 1578. It was thenceforth usually directed by the First President of the Parliament. A remnant of the medieval commune's general assemblies, it was typically limited to ceremonial hearings and oversight of the capitulary election. It was restructured and given greater importance during the 1778 reform of Toulouse's civic government. The Town Council () was a smaller number of townsmen and capitouls who met more often to oversee the Capitoulate. The Council of Sixteen () was formed of the present year's eight capitouls and the previous year's eight as well. It also met regularly in the 16th century. Election The capitouls were elected annually from the city's eight districts, also called \\"capitoulates\\". Between the 14th and late 17th centuries, the election of the capitouls took place in November and December of each year. On November 23, each outgoing capitoul proposed six candidates. An assembly of former office holders halved this list to 24. The town's viguier and seneschal then selected the eight who took their oath of office on December 13. Backroom negotiation and bribery were commonplace. Following the 1562 riots, the elections were closely controlled by the Parliament and in 1661 Louis XIV's appointee Gaspard de Fieubet secured the perpetual right to name the capitouls from his position as First President of the Parliament. In 1683, the king began to appoint the capitouls from a slate of candidates provided by the city. By 1701, the position was broadly venal, with prospective capitouls required to provide loans of at least 10,000 livres to the city upon their \\"election\\"; in 1734, a royal edict made four of the positions explicitly venal, \\"commissioned\\" offices that were purchased from the king. Another edict in 1746 established eight permanent \\"titular\\" () capitouls, pairs of which rotated in office each year with the six other capitouls, which were \\"elected\\" by the king from the town's slate of nominees. History The Toulousians claimed that their liberties predated the Kingdom of France, having been bestowed by the Roman emperor , and that the capitouls represented a direct continuation of the consuls of the Roman Republic. The town annals described their dignity as arising from \\"halting their own business, suspending their commerce, abandoning all particular affectations and putting aside their cherished projects in order to augment the Republic, following the precepts of Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon and other philosophers.\\" In fact, the municipal government of Toulouse grew from the assembly permitted by Count Raymond V in 1152. His successors confirmed the council and permitted the open election of its members by the town's citizens. Any free citizen over 25 was eligible. The city and borough of medieval Toulouse The medieval donjon of the Toulousian Capitol in the 19th century. Initially, the council consisted of six men from the city () of Toulouse proper, bound by its old Roman walls, and six from the borough () of tradesmen which had developed around St-Sernin. After the 1215 union of these two settlements, the twelve positions were divided among twelve capitoulates, six in each half. The districts of the old city were La Daurade, the Old Bridge (), and La Dalbade near the Garonne; St-√âtienne around the bishop's cathedral; St-Pierre & St- G√©raud around the count's palace; and St-Romain around the town hall. Those in the borough were named for the church of St-Pierre-des-Cuisines and for their adjacent gates into the old town: Arnaud Bernard, Las Crosses, Matabovis, Pousonville, and Villeneuve. The commune received many privileges from its counts during the 12th century: its capitouls formed the city's principal court, established market rules and tax exemptions, and maintained the town's drainage. Even the counts' vicars occasionally submitted to the Capitoulate's jurisdiction. Most of these powers were lost following the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in the 13th century, particularly after the ascension of the Capetian Alphonse of Poitiers as count of Toulouse and his succession by King Philip, who imposed seneschals over his new territories. The election procedure was revamped by King Philip III in 1283, when he provided that each outgoing capitoul was to provide a list of three potential replacements to the seneschal, who would choose one or‚Äîin the event he disapproved of them all‚Äînominate his own man. The new capitouls were then to swear their vows and pledge loyalty to the king on the steps of the old comital palace. The municipal annal for 1453, including a portrait of the year's capitouls, their coats of arms, and the dove of the Holy Spirit inspiring them. Below, a sketch of medieval Toulouse. The Capetians accepted the need to preserve some local traditions, and the capitouls were charged with presenting lists of Toulouse's privileges and laws, which the king then accepted or rejected. The town's new charter preserved the right for citizens to elect a town council of 24 \\"capitouls\\"; this number was subsequently reduced to eight by the 15th century. Major decisions of the town‚Äîincluding legal and economic questions‚Äîwere decided by the Capitoulate, as well as the patronage attendant on their control of more than a hundred civic positions. In the late 13th century, the capitouls regulated the town's guilds, with the power to nominate and depose their bailiffs. They also directed the town's 400 or so ward heelers (). In October 1283, Philip III accepted that the capitouls would administer civil justice within the city and its surrounding seneschalty; questions of canon law continued to be determined by the bishop's court and some oversight was given to the king's seneschal, but the capitouls' deliberations were normally free of interference by the king's judges. They secured the city's grain supply, which frequently brought them into conflict with the large landowners represented in the Toulouse Parliament. The capitouls also purchased freedom from royal taxation and an exemption from royal garrisons within the town walls,. liberties confirmed by in 1495. They participated in the city's general processions, mass parades through the town organized for the high holy days, various civic occasions, and at times of collective danger. The outgoing capitouls were also responsible for drafting the town annals (), an account of municipal affairs during their year in office. These records, also known as the Twelve Books (), began their first entry‚Äîthat for the year 1296‚Äîwith a Latin poem translated in Turning as: As the office was ennobling after 1459, it was attractive to many of the city's middle and lower upper class. The Capitoulate was closed to the king's officers and, while it was intended to represent the city's nobles, lawyers, and merchants, in practice the merchants were largely shut out of office after the mid-16th century. The trappings of nobility enjoyed by the capitouls included a red and black silk ermine gown and exemption from prosecution for both the office holder and his son. In the early 16th century, the Capitoulate curtailed prostitution, oversaw poor relief, organized the local militia into a permanent force, established a health board to fight plague outbreaks, and directed rebuilding from the devastation of the Hundred Years' War and a massive fire in 1463. In 1505, they took the town's nine hospitals out of church hands and placed them under a single civil administration. In 1514, they opened another hospital, the St-Sebastian, to quarantine and care for plague victims. In 1518 and 1519, the town's archives were recopied and preserved. A new bridge was thrown across the Garonne and the H√¥tel de Ville completely refurbished. A 1562 portrait of the capitoul Jean Alies in his robes of office. Several royal edicts confirmed the Capitoulate's jurisdiction and, in 1554, they won the right to oversee all cases of heresy within the city walls. However, during an outbreak of plague in 1557, the Parliament interfered with the regular method of electing capitouls, causing much resentment. By 1561, nearly every aspect of municipal government‚Äîrevenue, expenditure, administration, education, and defense‚Äîwas disputed between the two bodies. A shortfall owing to war taxes and the town's firma burgi led to rival proposals to sell Catholic or Protestant church properties. To reduce the Parliament's power, the capitouls ended lifetime positions in the municipal government, opening them all to annual election. In 1562, the first year, many of these went to members of the Reformed Church. The Reformers also held a majority of that year's seats on the town council. The attempt of the capitoul Pierre Hunault, sieur de Lanta, to seize the town hall and inner city set off the 1562 Toulouse Riots, whose aftermath saw the entire slate of elected capitouls replaced by a Catholic gang named by the Toulouse Parliament. Duke of Montmorency at the Toulouse Capitol on 30 October 1632. The town annals subsequently cease to speak of the town's \\"municipal republic\\" and Parliament generally increased its control over the city thereafter. In 1578, the capitouls were forbidden to appear before the members of Parliament in the town's general processions. During a \\"shoving match\\" over which body should stand beside the eucharist during the Pentecostal procession of 1597, the capitouls were \\"manhandled, thrown onto the ground, and trampled\\". The capitouls were placed in inferior positions at official functions: in 1644, a reviewing stand was demolished because it did not permit sufficient distance between the members of Parliament and the capitouls. At the death of Archbishop Montchal in 1651, the capitouls were even forbidden from any participation in his funeral. Individual members of Parliament also regularly made a point of insulting the capitouls at public and private functions. In the mid-17th century, Cardinal Mazarin and briefly restored much of the Capitoulate's autonomy, even giving it the right to take some cases to the Parliament of Bordeaux rather than its local rivals, as part of an attempt to secure its alliance during the Fronde uprising. After the restoration of order, however, the First President of the Parliament, Gaspard de Fieubet, was able to use his connections to the royal court to first name his lackeys as the capitouls for 1660 and then, in 1661, to directly appoint the annual capitouls in perpetuity. As Intendant of Languedoc, Nicolas de Lamoignon placed his own men as capitouls and oversaw an overhaul of Toulouse's municipal government in the 1680s and '90s. He noted that prior to his actions each capitoul routinely apportioned the town's alms \\"to his shoemaker, to his baker, and to other artisans, while the true poor receive nothing\\"; that they shirked responsibilities such as policing that offered little personal honor; and that they underpaid Toulouse's contribution to the taille and forced the city into indebtedness by exempting themselves and friends from local taxation. His changes functioned briefly but floundered: His independent police lieutenant was purchased by the city in 1699 for 220,000 livres and he was obliged to accept the practice of hiring capitouls who were willing to supplement the city's funds with personal loans, as with those who assisted in making up for a grain shortage around 1710. Subsequent intendants were similarly forced to accept nominees of the archbishop, the parliamentary presidents, and other important nobles of the realm, even when such candidates did not so much as visit the city, let alone perform the responsibilities of their office. The capitouls were present at the laying of the foundation stone of the Garonne lock of the Canal du Midi near Toulouse in November, 1667. present Capitol, dating to the 1750s. The supervision of the royal intendant reduced the Capitoulate's control over municipal jobs considerably in the 18th century. In 1747, grain riots forced the capitouls to permit royal troops to enter the city freely for the first time. The edicts of 1764 and '65 which implemented the Laverdy Reforms were specially excluded from application in Toulouse through a dispensation secured by the Parliament. In 1765, King Louis XV fired the then incumbent Capitoul over the trial of Jean Calas, sentenced to death and broken on the wheel - which the King ruled to have been a grave miscarriage of justice. In the 1770s, a series of anonymous broadsides thoroughly condemned the conduct of the Capitoulate and was successful in securing an arr√™t from the royal council in June 1778. The reform consisted of four parts: * The capitouls were no longer to represent separate districts of the city; * A Consistory Chief () was created, to be appointed by the king and charged with oversight of the capitouls; * The capitouls were to be specifically proportioned among the town's classes, with two nobles, two former capitouls, and four townsmen; and * The overlapping councils of the municipal government were recast.

It was built in 1886 by Sohmer & Co., and is a six-story, \\"L\\"-shaped, Rundbogenstil / Romanesque Revival style brick building. The corner features a clock tower with a copper trimmed mansard roof. The building was expanded about 1906‚Äì1907. It was converted to residential usage starting in 2007. Note: This includes See also: The building was designated as a New York City individual landmark in 2007 for its role in the history of New York City's piano manufacturing industry. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.  History  Hugo Sohmer - founder of Sohmer & Co. - relocated his manufacturing premises from 149 East 14th Street in 1886 after building a new land-mark building on the Astoria coast of East River. He had founded the company few years earlier together with his partner Joseph Kuder from Vienna, who was also a former Steinway and Sons employee. The new building of Sohmer & Co was designed by Berger & Baylies architecture firm. Entering in piano building business in NY in the end of 19th century was not a hard thing to do as there were many skilled emigrants coming from Europe (mostly Germany) and the demand for the instrument was growing fast. The building was expanded by Baylies & Co architecture firm in 1906‚Äì7. After 1924 year's collapse of piano industry Sohmer's production rates fell. In the time of Great Depression parts of the building were leased out to other manufacturers. However the company survived the Great Depression and maintained production in its Astoria factory till 1982 when the grand son of Hugo Sohmer sold the company to Pratt-Read company - producers of piano pieces and furniture. The plant was then relocated to Ivoryton, Connecticut, and the building sold to Adirondack Chair Company. Between 2007 and 2013, the building was converted for residential use with new penthouse additions above the sixth floor. Currently Sohmer pianos are produced in Korea. = Piano building tradition in New York = There were almost no pianos in the US until 1771 when Thomas Jefferson required a forte piano ordered to him from Europe. That triggered larger trend among wealthy Americans to purchase the instrument. In less than 10 years there were already few local piano manufacturers in Philadelphia and New York. However pianos remained rare instruments and as estimated in 1790s there were only 26 pianos in Boston all of which were made in London. In the first third of the 18th century Boston was leading American piano manufacturing center, but it was soon outraced by Philadelphia, nearly followed by New York. By the 1840s New York started to gain its national importance as center of culture and commerce. But only after the wave of German immigrants who arrived in 1850s the city became leading piano building center in America. The most notable German immigrant probably was Heinrich E. Steinweg (later he changed his name to Steinway and his name became the synonym to the instrument). Among them also Hugo Sohmer arrived in the US in 1863. In these years piano building took off in New York. Soon piano was the second most household appliance after kitchen. In the turn of the century piano experienced boom age. It was an important household part of a middle class Americans. There was a widespread belief that it helped to \\"cultivate the women\\" of its age. Consequently, it was played by mostly females. In 1870 there were 1 piano in every 1540 Americans, but in 1910 there were already 1 piano in every 252 Americans. This shows the great development speed of the industry. New York was by far the greatest piano building center in the US with ~170 of total 270 US piano factories located there. However, by 1924 the industry fell apart mostly due wide spreading of much cheaper and smaller radios. Radio industry rose from around 190 000 in 1923 to almost 5 million in 1929. In the same time American piano industry shrank from 160 to 36. Nowadays there is only one major piano factory in NYC - Steinway and Sons and several antique piano restoration workshops.  Architecture  This building is one of the most prominent in the coast of Astoria on the East River. The building is specially distinguished by its mansard roofed clock tower over the top of its impressive scale. Designed by Berger & Baylies architecture firm this 6 story L-shaped factory building was a typical wealthy factory of New York' s piano manufacturing scene. It is built in red bricks and designed in German Romanesque Revival Style or Rundbogenstil. Characteristic to this style was the usage of curved edges and surfaces on the roof. Thus segmentally-arched brick lintels. Band courses surmount the first, second and fifth floors. This factory building is one of the few surviving factories in Queens. It represents many characteristics of 19th century factory building. typically to the age these principles were always rooted in functionality and practical needs. According to architecture historian Betsy Hunter Bradly \\"the aesthetic bases of American Industrial building design was an ideal of beauty based on function, utility and process\\". Basic characteristics of Sohmer factory - its narrow width and L-shaped plan was due to the need for natural light as the factory was built before the advent of electric lighting. The need for good light for the interior dictated the narrow shape of the floor plan, but the land plot size did not let to build it in I shaped formation. thus L-shape was chosen. Often factory buildings were in I, L, U, H, E configurations. Flat roofs were also a practical need for a factory. They were mostly used after 1860s. It was due to the fire safety. Flat roofs let to eliminate the attic space - a place that could get dusty and easily catch on fire. Bricks were used for factory walls because they were the most fire resistant material. Brick work decorations was a popular method of livening up large wall surfaces - displaying dogtoothing, recessed panels, channeling, pilasters, corbelling were among most popular forms of decorative brickwork. Positioning the building on the edge of the street let the owners of the factory preserve larger back side space away from public eyes, thus buildings well organized and regular facade was the only public face of the company. The physical aesthetics played important role in marketing the company. Factory's image was used on letterheads, catalogs, business directories and in advertisements. Typically they were bird's eye views of the factory with smoke coming out of the chimneys thus rendering image of energy, dynamics and organization of the work. The building's prominent location on the river front also served as an attraction of new customers. It was seen from long distances, even from across the East River. As the Sohmers were producing product for popular consumption it was important that his factory was seen by as many people as possible, thus this location served not only as a display for inhabitants of Manhattan, but also those who passed by on the boats. The building served excellent as an eye catcher because of its scale and proportions. But the most focal point of the building of course remained the clock tower elevating above the 2 wings of the factory. This clock tower remains the most significant feature of the building. It is also most elaborately decorated part of the building. Mansard roof with curved dome is covered with decorations expressing this as the most focal part of the building. From the corner side the building was seen the best thus architects have chosen to express this part of it the most. For factories usually most decorated parts were entrances and clock towers. The clock towers had their roots in cupolas of New England Mills. Clocks organized the daily lives of local community. It was long before the affordable watch had made its first appearance, when need for strictly organized daily rhythm was established. By late nineteenth century clock was one of the main tool to organize the daily lives of New Yorkers. Living synchronized was becoming a necessity. They delivered this function to the network of public clock towers, factory whistles and bells. But clock tower was more than that. it was also a fire sealed staircase for factory that prevented the fires to spread vertically in the building. Thus tower was not only aesthetically most prominent place in the factory, but also most socially important and functional one.  Architects  The architecture firm in their short existence run by Bruno W. Berger and Franklin Baylies designed many commercial and residential buildings around New York. Bruno W. Berger had previously worked with several other partners, whereas Franklin Baylies had just started his career. The firm was established in the beginning of 1880s, but exact year is unknown. That includes several warehouses and store-and-loft buildings in Tribeca and around its historical district. Firm mostly designed in neo-Grec style, thus Rundbogenstil Sohmer piano factory building was unusual for them. However, it was their largest assignment. In 1890 both architects established their own practices and Berger & Baylies ceased to exist. It is believed that the extension of Sohmer factory in 1906-7 was assigned to Franklin Baylies' firm.

First established in the country in 1995, during the era of the Fourth Caliphate, the Community represents an estimated 2% of the country's Muslim population, corresponding to approximately 13,000 people. History Relief map of Guinea-Bissau The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Guinea-Bissau was first established in 1995. However, it has not had an easy beginning since its founding. Only six years later, on August 20, 2001, the then president of Guinea-Bissau, Kumba Ial√°, ordered the closure of Ahmadi mosques and mission houses, and called for the expulsion of Ahmadi Muslim missionaries of foreign Pakistani origin, to leave the country within a period of \\"48 hours\\". In a meeting held with 500 Muslim leaders in the country, the president accused Ahmadi Muslims for interfering with the nation's politics and for creating misunderstanding and instability within the Muslim populations. In response to the decision, Sory Djalo resigned from his post as the religious affairs advisor to the president. In response to the president's decision, the Community appealed at Bissau's Regional Court, one of the nine regional courts in the country. The court found that the decision made by the president to have violated the nation's constitution which guarantees religious freedom and which prohibits dissolution of religious groups without a prior court approval. As a consequence, the decision was declared void and unconstitutional. Despite this, the Community was still banned. In January 2005 the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was permitted to resume its religious activity, only to be banned once again two months later, in March. The reason attributed to this decision was a dispute in Gab√∫ city between Ahmadis and non-Ahmadi Muslims which resulted in the injury of four Ahmadi Muslims. A year later, in 2006, the Community once again appealed the government's decision to ban its religious activity. Once again, the government granted the Community the right to practice its faith openly. Since 2006, there have been no reports of discrimination against Ahmadi Muslims, governmental or otherwise.

The -story Italian Renaissance-style main building and two-story annex were both built in 1923‚Äì1924 and designed by the Ballinger Company. A three-story rear addition was added in 1930. The building is made of granite, limestone, and brick. It features a granite-block terrace with granite balustrade, limestone arched entrance, and an elaborate cornice made of architectural terracotta. Lodge 878 was once was the largest such lodge in the Eastern United States, with 28 inn rooms, bowling alleys, game rooms, ladies' and gentlemen's lounges, and a bar. A statue of an elk is outside the Queens Boulevard entrance. From its completion in 1924 until the late 20th century, Lodge 878 was extremely influential in Queens politics, with up to 6,600 members in the 1960s. The members were mostly white and male. In the late 20th century, Lodge 878 saw declining membership amid Queens' changing demographics, and the building was rented out for other events. The Elks sold its main building to New Life Fellowship Church in 2001, but it continues to meet in the annex as the Brooklyn Queensborough Elks Lodge. The building is a New York City Designated Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Description  The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks' Lodge 878 building was designed by the Ballinger Company in the Italian Renaissance Revival style. It is composed of the -story main building at 82-10 Queens Boulevard; a two-story annex to the east at 82-20 Queens Boulevard; and a three-story rear addition to the south of the main building. Elks Lodge 878 occupies a land lot on the south side of Queens Boulevard, between Simonson and Goldsmith Streets. The main building is on the western side of the block, nearer Simonson Street. The lodge's annex is on the east side of the block toward Goldsmith Street, while the rear addition faces south in the direction of Grand Avenue. The lodge and annex each occupy one land lot, but they only take up half of their respective lots, with the remainder being used as parking areas. An electronic sign is at the western end of the block, at the corner of Queens Boulevard and Simonson Street. At the time of Lodge 878's construction, the architecture of fraternal organizations' buildings varied drastically. Many lodges built at the time were designed as freestanding structures that acted as monuments, and Elks Lodge 878 was one such example, being highly visible from Queens Boulevard. The main building's facade contained many Italian Renaissance details, including a rusticated limestone facade on its first floor; balustrades; entablatures; and decorative elements such as cornices. Lodge 878 had amenities such as a swimming pool, banquet hall, gym, bowling alley, lodge room, and residential suites for members; it once had a barber shop and restaurant as well. Decorations related to the Elks are prevalent inside, including elk reliefs on the building's doorknobs. = Main building = Elk statue outside the main building The main building is three and a half stories, with a raised basement. It has a U-shaped floor plan. The structure measures , with the longer side facing Simonson Street.  Facade  The facade consists of granite at its base, rusticated limestone on the first floor, and brick with limestone ornament on the upper floors. The main elevation on Queens Boulevard, facing north, consists of five bays, while the elevations to the west and east contain seven bays. Outside the main building's northern elevation is a set of stairs leading to broad terrace with a balustrade. A bronze elk statue is on a pedestal in the middle of the staircase. According to one legend about the building, Elks Lodge 878 members would squeeze the elk's testicles for good luck before they entered. On the first story, in the center bay of the northern elevation, is the main entrance arch, which contains a double door and a semicircular window, and is topped by an elaborate keystone. The arch is flanked by a pair of Doric-style engaged columns, which support a frieze with the text . The northern elevation's first floor also contains four segmental-arched openings, two on each side of the main entrance arch, each of which contains a double door and a keystone depicting a lion's head. The side elevations, including the four-bay-wide rear addition, contain casement windows with lion's-head keystones. An entablature and small cornice runs above the first story. Second and third floor facade detail The second and third stories and the attic are clad with buff brick and contain casement windows. On the original building, but not its rear addition, the second-floor windows are set beneath curved architraves, with balustrades at the bottom of each opening. Similarly, the original building's third-floor window openings are topped by scrolled keystones and set beneath carved limestone panels. The rear addition contains a simple brick facade on the upper stories with rectangular windows. A small cornice separates the third floor from the attic, which contains wide carved limestone panels flanking each of the narrow windows. A larger, more extensively decorated terracotta cornice runs above the attic. The eastern elevation has a fire escape. The rear addition's southern elevation is an undecorated brick facade with segmental-arched first floor window and rectangular second- and third-floor windows, as well as a handicap-accessible entrance. The main building's southern elevation is mostly blocked by the rear addition, but the upper stories of the southern elevation are similar to those on the other three elevations. A flagpole and brick elevator room are atop the roof, while a brick chimney stack is at the southeast corner of the rear addition.  Features  The basement had a grill room with a bar and a six-lane bowling alley. Also in the basement were lockers, restrooms, and a barber shop. The bowling alley was subsequently converted to a multipurpose room, while the rest of the basement was reconfigured with classrooms. It has a terrazzo floor, wooden wainscoting, wooden ceiling beams, and wood-sash casement windows with red stained glass. The basement is accessed by a stair from the first floor with wooden wainscoted walls and brass railings. The first floor has a vestibule inside the main entrance, which contains limestone walls with wood trim. The vestibule leads to a first-floor lobby measuring . It has plaster ceilings, wood-trimmed limestone walls, and terrazzo floors. There are two rooms, one to each side, which served as the men's and women's lounges; they have bronze chandeliers, parquet wooden floors, and decorative fireplace mantels. Other rooms extend from the lobby; on the east, there are stairs leading up and down, as well as an elevator bank. In the back (south) was a dining room measuring , a ticket office, a coat room, restrooms, and a kitchen. The dining room still exists and has checkerboard terrazzo floors, square piers, and bas reliefs. The interior of the rear addition has a health center. The first floor was available for non-members to use as well. The second and third floors contained offices and game rooms. The common area of the second floor has wood-trimmed plaster walls, parquet wooden floors, and wooden ceiling beams. The southern section has the former lodge room (doubling as an auditorium and used as a church room), while the northern section has offices. The lodge room has capacity for up to 700 people. It is themed to Mayan or Aztec culture, with stained glass panels symbolizing charity, justice, brotherly love, and fidelity, the cardinal virtues of the Elks. Inside the lodge room is a 3-rank, 9-manual Wurlitzer organ manufactured in 1924. The third floor is furnished similarly to the second floor, and has balconies overlooking the lodge room, with stationary wooden seats. In the rear addition, there are classrooms and offices. The attic contained 28 suites for members to rent. These were arranged as six double-bedroom suites and 22 single-bedroom suites, with connecting bathrooms between pairs of suites. The suites were available to members for a monthly fee; The New York Times reported in 1995 that this fee was $220. The suites were on the east and west sides of the main building, and lined a \\"T\\"-shaped corridor. = Annex = The annex is clad with stucco and contains recessed arches with small rectangular windows inside each arch. The main entrance is on Goldsmith Street along the eastern elevation and contains three pairs of doors. A one-story western extension contains a side entrance to Queens Boulevard. A modillioned metal cornice runs atop the annex. The annex originally contained the swimming pool on the first floor and a gym in the mezzanine, though the pool is no longer extant. The first floor was converted into a multipurpose room that could be used as a bar, dining room, or handball court. The mezzanine floor is smaller than the first floor and has a conference room and an office. The interior has wooden floors and sheet-rock partitions.  History  = Planning and construction = During the late 1890s, the former town of Newtown was renamed Elmhurst and became part of the City of Greater New York. Elmhurst subsequently became developed as a commercial and residential neighborhood, with the arrival of the New York City Subway and Long Island Rail Road, as well as the construction of Queens Boulevard in the early 20th century, connecting Elmhurst to the Queensboro Bridge to Manhattan. Prior to development, the plot that would later become Lodge 878 was undeveloped, and a stream called Horse Brook ran through the southern side of the lot, though this stream had ceased to run above ground by 1902. To accommodate the width of Queens Boulevard, buildings along the route were demolished, and the future Lodge 878 lot was decreased in size in 1910. The Elks, meanwhile, had been founded in 1868 as an all-white, all-male fraternal organization, growing rapidly in subsequent years. Lodge 878 was founded in 1903, and for its first 21 years, met at the Lodge 828 building at 21-42 44th Drive in Long Island City. A 1906 Elks bylaw subsequently limited the number of Elks chapters to one in each municipality, making Lodge 878 the only Elks chapter in Queens. Lodge 878 bought the plot at the southeast corner of Queens Boulevard and Simonson Street in 1921. The Elmhurst location was chosen after extensive discussion. Elks from Jamaica, Richmond Hill, and Woodhaven favored a location in Forest Hills, while Elks from Long Island City and Long Island's North Shore advocated for the Elmhurst location. The cornerstone of the Lodge 878 building was laid on October 6, 1923. To celebrate the groundbreaking and Lodge 878's twentieth anniversary, a parade of almost 300 automobiles carrying 1,500 people drove down Queens Boulevard from Long Island City to the Lodge 878 site. The Ballinger Company had designed plans for the main building and annex's construction, while the McIntee Construction Company was contracted to erect the building. The Elks held a fundraiser for the building's furnishings in late 1924. The lodge was opened on October 26, 1924, and the Elks' grand exalted ruler John G. Price traveled to Queens in December 1924 to dedicate the new building. It had ultimately cost $750,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). Upon completion, it ranked as the Eastern United States' largest Elks Lodge. = Elks use = Rear addition, built 1930 Lodge 878 originally had a kitchen behind the main building, measuring . The Elks planned to eventually add a four-story structure behind the main building, with a connecting passageway, but this was not built. Sidney L. Strauss, a lodge member, was instead hired to design the three-story rear addition, replacing the single- story kitchen. Babor-Comeau and Company constructed the addition, which was finished in 1930. During the mid-20th century, Lodge 878 was influential in Queens politics, with members of Lodge 878 representing both the Democratic and Republican parties. The New York Times said that \\"If you wanted a job in 1960's Queens, you came to the Elks.\\" By the 1960s, Lodge 878 had 6,600 members and 26 staff, with between 300 and 400 members attending the weekly meetings. Lodge 878 members were highly involved in charity; every year, Lodge 878 held a six-day Elks Bazaar in which it gave away up to 24 new cars. In addition, it was involved in arranging the funerals of its members. Lodge 878 was reported in 1970 to have a membership of 4,093, making it New York state's largest Elks Lodge. A Times reporter, visiting two years later, said that the lodge was among the largest in the United States, with 3,500 members according to the lodge's executive secretary. However, Lodge 878 and the Elks as a whole suffered a major decline in membership in the late 20th century. Lodge 878 lost about 90% of its members between 1975 and 2001. This was despite the fact that people of other races were allowed to join the Elks in 1973, and women were able to gain membership in 1995. = Decline and sale = After the annual property taxes on the building increased from $35,000 in 1990 to $86,000 in 1995, the Elks placed the Lodge 878 building for sale. Its membership had declined to about 900; the weekly meetings had been cut back to biweekly meetings, and attendance had declined to 50. The annual car raffle had been canceled in 1985 after only a single car was offered at the raffle. Elmhurst's population had changed dramatically from 1980 to 1990; during that time, the white population had declined by 40%, while the Asian population had doubled and overtaken the white population in Elmhurst. Lodge 878's membership was still mostly white and male in 1995; the lodge's treasurer stated that the neighborhood's more recent residents, who were predominantly immigrants, had not shown interest in the Elks. The New York Times described the lodge later that year as \\"an anachronism with an all-white membership that has failed to attract minorities\\". One of the Elks' problems was that, even though one prerequisite for membership was U.S. citizenship, an increasing number of Queens residents were not U.S. citizens. The lodge started to rent out its facilities for celebrations such as Chinese weddings and Latin American quincea√±eras. The New Life Fellowship Church, a Korean Pentecostal church, started renting space in the mezzanine in 1995. Wrestling groups started running shows at Lodge 878, including Extreme Championship Wrestling, which rented out the lodge room for several decades. Among the wrestling events at the lodge was the It Ain't Seinfeld supercard event in 1998 and the ROH One Year Anniversary Show in 2003. The building was also rented for film and TV shows. Despite the revenue from renting out the building, Lodge 878 was barely able to make a profit. Electronic sign outside the Elks Lodge 878 building, installed by the New Life Fellowship Church In 2000, the Elks began negotiating with the New Life Fellowship Church to sell the main building because the Elks were unable to pay a $60,000 tax bill for the building. During the sale negotiations, the Elks stipulated that they wished to keep occupying the building's first floor for 99 years without paying rent. After a year of negotiations, the Elks sold the main building to the church in 2001. The Elks continued to own the annex, but closed the annex's pool and added partitions. By then, Lodge 878 only had 550 members. Because of the split ownership of the main building and its annex, these were divided into two separate lots for tax purposes. The New Life Fellowship Church turned the main building's rear addition into a health center in 2009, as well as made various improvements for handicap accessibility in the 2010s.  Critical reception and landmark designations  Upon its completion, the Lodge 878 building received critical acclaim. The new building won the Queens Chamber of Commerce's Annual Building Award for 1925. In the September 1926 edition of Architectural Forum, which had a series of three article on the buildings of fraternal organizations, the building's elk statue was depicted on the first page of the three-article series. The series' last article praised the Ballinger Company as having \\"carried out, brilliantly and effectively, an adaptation of the highly decorative style of the ancient Maya builders of Central America.\\" The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the main building as a landmark on August 4, 2001, acknowledging its importance to Queens politics and making it the first Elks Lodge in the city to be an official city landmark. Neither the annex nor the rear addition were designated as city landmarks. The lodge, annex, and addition were added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 19, 2014.

Biography  = Early life = Bibas was born in Gibraltar to Sephardi Jews who were descendants of Jews expelled from Spain and had settled in North Africa. One of his maternal ancestors was Chaim ibn Attar. His father came from a line of Rabbis in T√©touan that emigrated to Gibraltar after a pogrom against the Jews that followed the invasion of the city by Spain. Bibas studied as a child in Gibraltar and after the death of his father he moved to Livorno to live with his grandfather. Livorno had a very prestigious and educated Jewish community. Bibas received in Livorno most of his Jewish and secular education, including his title as a physician. He then returned to Gibraltar where he established himself as the Rosh yeshiva. His Yeshiva was attended by students from England, Italy and North Africa. In 1810 he came to London, where he met with the famous Jewish activist and philanthropist Sir Moses Montefiore. Rabbi Yehuda Bibas was fluent in English, Italian, Spanish and Hebrew, and he was also a physician. In 1831, Bibas was appointed as the Chief Rabbi of Corfu. = Zionist activism = By the years 1839-1840, Bibas undertook a journey in Europe. While visiting many Jewish communities, he called upon the Jews to make Aliyah to Palestine and settle there. He was one of the first Rabbis to do so. Yael Weiler, Israel. 2015. p. 50. In the same year, he met with Judah Alkalai, who became his student. Bibas's plan was to encourage Jews from all over the world to come to Palestine, conquer the land from the Ottomans, and create a Jewish society there. During some of his visits to London, he cooperated with Moses Montefiore on many subjects. = Aliyah and death = By 1852, one year after his wife died, Bibas made Aliyah to Palestine, and was welcomed by his students in Jaffa. Later he went to Hebron where he established a seminary and built his extensive library. He died two months after his arrival to Palestine and was buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery in Hebron. The Jewish community of Hebron used to hold a memorial ceremony for him every year on Yom Kippur evening. A street in Jerusalem is named in his memory.

Okahara is a winner of PDNs 30, Joop Swart Masterclass of World Press Photo, Eugene Smith Fellowship, Getty Images Grant, and Pierre & Alexandra Boulat Award.  Biography  Okahara was born in Tokyo, Japan. After a period of training and competing in freestyle skiing at the international level, he studied education at Waseda University. Upon obtaining his degree, he embarked on a career as a photographer, alternating between news- reporting and long-term personal projects. His initial trip led him to Sudan (2004), Burma (2007), China (2007), as well as his first trip to Colombia (2006). In 2004, he began \\"Ibasyo\\" a long-term photographic essay on adolescent self-harm in Japan. Japanese society generally ignores this phenomenon as it considers it to be shameful. Okahara took on the pluralistic roles of photographer, close friend, witness, and social worker. One of his series that he photographed in Colombia has been published and exhibited as a part of \\"100 years of Leica photography\\". Other topics he has photographed are the Arab Spring, the chaos on the Russian periphery, and migrants around Calais in 2008. Since the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, he documents the region devastated by the disaster with a particular attention given to the signs of time. This latter work is the subject of a book, Fukushima Fragments (2015). Okahara was a member of Agence VU' between 2007 and 2010.  Books  Contact #1 -Any given day-.

Prior to 2014, several attempts were made to obtain funding through the school's budget, but the motion was voted down each time...most recently in 2016. As a result, the team continued on their own and raised the money themselves in order to fund the program http://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/fate-unclear-for-thunderbird- football/389128798. In 2014, the program received a $10,000 grant from the Vermont chapter of the National Football Foundation as well as donated gear from Middlebury College and the New England Patriots among other organizations http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/sports/2014/04/01/missisquoi- receives-10000-for-football-program/7185565/. After a lot of hard work and determination, the MVU Thunderbirds made their debut in the fall 2014 season on a JV schedule and finished with a 5-2 record. They remained on a JV schedule for the 2015 season as well, also finishing with a 5-2 record. The 2016 season marked the varsity debut of the MVU Thunderbird football program. Even though the rest of the athletic programs at MVU play in Division 1 or 2, the football program began its varsity journey in Division 3. An eventual move up to Division 2 or 1 is expected once the team is able to gain more varsity experience.

Music and Drama  Missisquoi has held a musical and Skit Nite annually since its first year of operation. For Skit Nite each class; freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, create an original play that is no more than half an hour long. All classes compete against each other for victory and bragging rights. There are two nights to perform for an audience and graduates serve as judges to determine the winner. However the judges do not know any of the students so there is no bias. MVU has auditions for the musical in November and practices from January to the beginning of April, at which time the musical is held.

All 53 council seats in the city were up for election and the Labour Party won overall control of the council. Labour had controlled the 1973-1995 York City Council as a majority group since 1986 but following the creation of an expanded City of York unitary authority 22 councillors were returned to represent parished areas previously part of the more rural district council areas of Ryedale (14 councillors), Selby (6) and Harrogate (2). These areas were generally considered to be less fertile territory for Labour. The 15 former York City Council wards were unchanged for this election but each unitary ward elected two councillors, rather than three. The only exception was Foxwood Ward, which continued to return three councillors on the basis of population growth. In the context of a nationwide disaster for the Conservative Party, Labour won all but four of the former York City Council wards (all four were held by the Liberal Democrats), including both seats in Micklegate, previously a safe Conservative ward. In the parished areas outside the former York city council boundary Labour won three seats (Fulford, Heslington and Copmanthorpe) and the Liberal Democrats won 14. The Conservatives were reduced to just three seats and two Independent councillors were also elected.
