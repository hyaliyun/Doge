They are large and fast predators with rugged bodies and long tails, having a combined length up to 1.5 metres, that will consume any smaller animal that is pursued and captured or found while foraging. They occur in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, where it may be rare or locally common, and more frequently observed in Western Australia, where it is sometimes abundant.  Taxonomy  The species was first described by German herpetologist Robert Mertens in 1957, named and recognized as a subspecies of Varanus gouldii; a revision of Western Australian monitors published in 1980 elevated the taxon to species status. It is now considered to be a member of the V. gouldii species complex. The holotype was collected at the Stirling Range in Southwest Australia. The specific name, rosenbergi, is in honor of German naturalist Hermann von Rosenberg. The infrageneric classification of the species allies it to other taxa of the subgenus Varanus (Varanus). A geographically remote population in the eastern states has distinct characteristics that may represent a cryptic species. A description published as Pantherosaurus kuringai in 1985 is regarded as a synonym for this species. The common names include the heath monitor or the southern heath monitor, along with those names that are a legacy of their description as the sand goanna Varanus gouldii. Description Dark coloured individual, south- western coast of Western Australia Like most other monitor lizards, these are fast-moving predators with long tails, stout limbs and clawed feet. They resemble the closely related and widespread sand goanna Varanus gouldii, to which they were previously allied as a subspecies, but distinguished by darker coloration overall, especially the markings at the tail tip and underside and the distinct black banding at the back and neck. Dull and vaguely defined yellow stripes appear across most of the tail's length, sometimes interrupting the blackish colour of its end. The feet and limbs are also very dark, and spotted with a creamy or brownish colour. The dark tone at the head is marked with yellow dots above the mouth, and the yellowish cream background colour of the underside displays a blackish reticular pattern. The largest specimens are those found at Kangaroo Island, near the coast of South Australia, these are also darker than those on the mainland and possess a greater number of scale rows at the ventral side. Fat layers in V. rosenbergi constitute around 7.6% of body weight, allowing energy reserves to be stored throughout the body and tail. This monitor can reach a length of 1.5 metres. It is dark gray with yellow and white spotting and black bands on its body and all the way down the tail. The juvenile is tinged with orange. The comparative ratio of head and body lengths between the sexes, often evident in the monitor subgenus Odatria, is not easily discernible in this species and their subgenus Varanus. Behaviour Reproductive behaviour, including guarding of nest sites, extends over a four-month period of a sexually active adult's year. Rosenberg's monitors mate over a 12-day period in January. In February and March, the female digs into an active termite mound, creating a spherical nest chamber beneath the hardened shell‚Äîfound under the loose outer layer of the mound‚Äîby collapsing the internal structure of tunnels and chambers. The depth of the monitor's nest is around 700 millimetres, taking the parent several days to complete, the thickness of the termitarium's cemented shell is approximately 140 mm and the overlying friable surface 100 mm. The species lays a brood of up to 14 eggs, then redeposits the excavated material to cover her entry; the termites reform the shell of their mound over the course of several days. Incubation periods of V. rosenbergi broods are around seven months, or longer at Kangaroo Island, which is regarded as an extended period when compared to other squamates and may be a response to the cooler climate of its range. In September and October, the hatchlings emerge from the mound, possibly with digging assistance from the adult; this parenting behaviour has inferred from the habits of other monitors without being directly observed in V. rosenbergi. A study observing this species at Kangaroo Island found that hatchlings emerged at the point of the parents entry to the nest, and able to excavate themselves from their birthplace. Their emergence corresponds with increasing warmth of the temperature outside the termitaria, and the hatchlings are observed at basking in the sunshine at the exterior and reoccupying the nest site during cold nights. They are highly active carnivores, able to pursue large prey, and opportunistic generalists whose diet includes birds, reptiles, mammals, eggs, and carrion. Analysis of the island population in South Australia revealed third of their diet is invertebrates, primarily species of Acrididae, Areneidae, Blattoidea and Coleoptera, with mammals and reptiles combined being the greater portion of animals that were eaten. Some amphibians, mostly Limnodynastes species of frogs, and a small proportion if birds were also found to have been captured and consumed, but invertebrates would be found during its regular foraging activities through soft soils and detritus. This goanna has been observed eating road kill, including possums and wallabies, and consumption of these may account for a significant proportion of the mammal component of their diet. The native rat species Rattus fuscipes is likely pursued and caught, but the recorded consumption of Macropus fuliginosus, the western grey kangaroo, and brush-tail possum Trichosurus vulpecula is likely the discovery of their carcasses. Water is obtained from prey when seasonal rainfall is low, and supplemented by drinking free water when available. Living in a sometimes saline environment, they are able to expel excess salts‚Äîprimarily sodium chloride and a smaller amount of potassium‚Äîthrough gland structures at the nostrils. In winter months the water required by the goanna may be supplemented from free water or by pulmocutaneous exchange of moisture. The darker coloration of V. rosenbergi, a form of melanism, allows a greater degree of thermoregulation of their body in the cooler southern climates. They periodically bask in the sun throughout the day, or when the opportunity arises, laying in the soil if it is warm or clambering on to branches to avoid a net heat loss; heath monitors are mostly found in their burrows during the coldest parts of the year. Females may continue to be active at night, maintaining a body temperature 20 ¬∞C greater than the ambient temperature. Varanus rosenbergi conserves its energy requirements during cooler seasons of the year, entering a state of torpor, but demonstrates the ability to voluntarily arouse itself during these periods. The species will climb a tree to evade capture.  Distribution  The distribution range of the species is in the south of the Australian continent, all occurrences are recorded below the southern 30¬∞ line of latitude. The range in Southwest Australia is south of Mussel Pool, to the northeast of the state's capital Perth, and inland from the southern coast in a range that extends close to Bendering, Norseman, Balladonia and then east to Eucla and South Australia. Varanus rosenbergi is most common in the west, locally abundant in favourable habitat, and deeply fragmented in the east; isolated groups near Canberra and Sydney may represent a separate species. A subpopulation, with individuals somewhat larger in size, is found on Kangaroo Island, and a mainland population in South Australia is considered rare. The eastern states included in records of the species occurrence at New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. The heath monitor is found in habitat close to sea level and at elevations below 1500 metres asl. The population in New South Wales, isolated and suspected to be a sister species, is found at high elevations that include occurrences above the snow-line in the mountainous regions of eastern Australia. The individual range of V. rosenbergi is comparatively large. The distribution range overlaps with Varanus gouldii and individuals of these species are sometimes sympatric, especially at southern areas of the Western Australian wheatbelt and on the Swan Coastal Plain; the species do not hybridize. The named distribution range of the widespread population of V. gouldi, due to a historically uncertain taxonomic description, was revised to exclude the southern coastal areas were this species occurs.  Ecology  The favoured types of habitat Varanus rosenbergi is associated with plant communities are most often sandy heathland, open woodland or sclerophyll forest, although the species is known to occur in other vegetation types. The near coastal areas it inhabits are frequently saline environments. Subalpine environments in the southernmost parts of its range such as Naas Valley, ACT, sometimes encounters snowfall. Heath monitors excavate burrows for refuge, or occupy rocky fissures and hollow trees.  Reproduction  The reproductive habits of Varanus rosenbergi are closely associated with termite constructions, the above ground nest-mounds of some species, and is thought to rely on these to produce offspring. The use of termitaria provides the newly hatched progeny the favourable conditions within the nest, warmth and regulated humidity, when conditions outside retard the activity of adults. Several other monitor species adopt termitaria as nest sites, those utilized by V. rosenbergi offer regular internal temperatures for most of the year, usually around 30¬∞ Celsius, and do not fall below 20 ¬∞C at the coolest times of the year.  Parasites  Varanus rosenbergi is known to be host to nine species of intestinal nematodes, parasites known as roundworm, and is recorded near undisturbed habitat with high infection rates of Abbreviata, physalopteroid species of the Spirurida order. Individuals often carry blood- feeding ticks lodged to their skin, these are found around the cloaca or base of the tail or seeking areas of high blood flow at the head and neck by the female tick when pregnant. The infestation rate in the southwest region is around half of the adults and is absent in juveniles, the Kangaroo Island population has a higher rate, around 85% of those surveyed carrying the species Aponomma fimbriatum.

Background  The Maratha Empire controlled much of central and northern India and had fallen to the British in 1818 giving the British control over almost all of the Indian subcontinent. The Maharaja of Gwalior had died and a young child appointed as the Maharaja with British support. However, Marathas in Gwalior saw the failed British campaign in Afghanistan as an opportunity to regain independence and removed the young Maharaja. Lord Ellenborough, foreseeing the possibility of the Marathas in Gwalior making an attempt for independence had formed the Army of Exercise near Agra. After attempts to negotiate failed, the British advanced in a two pronged attack. The British, under the command of Gen. Sir Hugh Gough clashed with Maratha forces, under the command of Maharaja Scindiah, in two battles on the same day; 29 December 1843.  The Battle of Maharajpore  Map of the Battle of Maharajpore, 29 December 1843 The Maratha army had 14 battalions, 1,000 artillerymen with 60 guns and 6,000 cavalry at Maharajpore. The British faced them with troops from the 40th Regiment of Foot with the 2nd and 16th Native Infantry Regiments forming the central column, the 39th Regiment of Foot with the 56th Native Infantry Regiment and a field battery forming the left column and the 16th Lancers with two troops of horse artillery as well as other artillery forming the right column. The centre column advanced to attack where they believed the main enemy force was located. However, during the night the Marathas had moved and the British were surprised as they came under heavy fire from the Maratha artillery in their new positions. The central column then received the order to take the battery positions which they did under continuous heavy fire from shot, grape, canister and chain. The guns were to the South-East Maharajpore with two battalions of Maratha troops for each battery and in Maharajpore with seven battalions for each battery and the British fought hand to hand with the Marathas, both sides taking heavy casualties, to clear the positions. The Marathas fought intensely and few escaped the battle. The British finally defeated the Marathas with 797 men killed, wounded or missing. The Marathas were estimated to have lost 3000 to 4000 men.  The Battle of Punniar  The Marathas at Punniar (29 December 1843) numbered about 12,000 men and occupied the high ground near Mangore. As the British army approached they immediately attacked the Maratha positions, driving them from the hill.  Aftermath  After the defeat of the Maratha forces in Gwalior the British disbanded their army and established a force in the state that the government of Gwalior maintained. A British governor was appointed at Gwalior Fort. The British soldiers who participated in the campaign were awarded a medal; the Gwalior Star.

Falku≈°a is a subtype of gajeta, a traditional Dalmatian fishing sailboat, and is sometimes called gajeta falku≈°a (). Its design was adapted to the specific needs of Komi≈æa fishermen, who went to long fishing expeditions in the open seas, a unique practice in the Adriatic and Mediterranean. Design and construction The lateen sail was used on the Falku≈°a The Falku≈°a is a unique wooden boat, tapered narrowly on both sides, and is about seven to eight metres in length by 3 metres wide. It had a low draft under a large () lateen sail made from flax, mounted on a mast which was typically as high as the ship was long. It was very fast both under sail and with oar, able to achieve speeds between 8 and 12 knots. Its distinctive feature were two removable wooden side strakes called falke, after which falku≈°a got its name. The strakes raised the rim of the boat by about half a metre, protecting it from high waves in the open seas. To ease the hauling of the nets, the strakes were removed during fishing. The vessel could carry up to eight tonnes of salted fish barrels. For its characteristics of toughness and strength, the traditional gajeta falku≈°a was made only with cypress wood from the volcanic island of Svetac. The keel was made of oak and the shell of larch. A typical falku≈°a carried a crew of six men. There were five oars for standing oarsmen which were 7 to 9 meters in length. The fishermen used nets and a feral, a gas or petroleum lamp for attracting fish. Fishing trips lasted 20 to 25 days, to make them financially viable. Duties such as cooking, washing, repairing, sailing between fishing posts and dealing with bad weather left only 10 to 12 days for actual fishing in a typical journey. Fishermen's regatta The main fishing ground exploited by Komi≈æa's fishermen was the island of Palagru≈æa, approximately to the south-southwest of Vis, which at times was used by fifty or more vessels. On the island there were provisional houses, which they used to store barrels of salted sardines and fishing equipment. Fishermen of Komi≈æa would hold an annual regatta between Komi≈æa and Palagru≈æa, known as Rota Palagruzona (\\"Palagru≈æa Route\\"), a trip which would take about 5 hours of sailing with a good wind, or 13 to 16 hours of rowing when wind conditions were poor. The outcome of the regatta was very important, because top finishers won the rights to the best fishing areas around Palagru≈æa for the season, and the other places were taken in the order of arrival. The first known regatta to Palagru≈æa was held as far back as 1593 making it the oldest fishermen's regatta in Europe. Komi≈æa's fishermen met in May 1593 in the Lodge in the town of Hvar. There it was agreed that the race of 74 falku≈°a boats would start on June 12. To signal the start of the race a cannon shot would be fired from the newly built town fortress. The fishermen were accompanied by Venetian war galleys in order to protect them from pirates. With the advent of ship engines, the regatta lost its purpose, and its last edition was held in 1936. Falku≈°a was used well into the first half of the 20th century. The last gajeta falku≈°a of the island of Komi≈æa, named Cicibela, was destroyed and sunk by a storm in the Bay of Porat (Bi≈°evo island) in 1986. Today its remains are preserved in the Fishing Museum in Komi≈æa. Replicas Mikula, the second full-scale replica, was finished in 2005. Falku≈°a Comeza-Lisboa with its crew and owners in Komi≈æa, December 7, 2003 A replica of a falku≈°a named Comeza- Lisboa (\\"Komi≈æa-Lisbon\\") was built in 1997 and exhibited at the 1998 World‚Äôs Fair in Lisbon, Portugal. The revival of the falku≈°a attracted significant interest, and the boat became the subject of five documentary films and an award-winning radio drama. In 1998 the falku≈°a was put on the UNESCO World Heritage List. In 1999 under UNESCO and with shipwright's documentation supplied by Velimir Salamon, a five-metre reduced-scale replica of the legendary falku≈°a was built. It was named Molo. It was built in Komi≈æa and launched into the sea on Saint Nicholas Day (December 6). The secretary of the European Maritime Heritage, Thedo Fruithof from Amsterdam, was present at the launch. A second full-scale replica, named Mikula, was finished in 2005. A third full-scale replica, named Palagru≈æa, was finished in 2015.

The deep sea adventure will be supported by the 125-ft super-catamaran Cheyenne mothership, and plans to use the HOT DeepFlight Challenger subVirgin Oceanic, Operations Team (accessed 25 May 2011) to make dives to the depths of the worlds oceans.Virgin Oceanic, Catamaran (accessed 25 May 2011)Virgin Oceanic, Sub (accessed 25 May 2011) Both the catamaran and the submersible were formerly owned by Steve Fossett, who had modified the racing catamaran to become the mothership for his planned oceanic dive record attempt. After Steve Fossett's death the project went on hold until Chris Welsh purchased the equipment from Fossett's estate and restarted the endeavor. The attempt on Challenger Deep was first announced in April 2011.Popular Mechanics, \\"Q&A; With Graham Hawkes, the Man Who Built the Deep Flight Challenger Submersible\\", Sarah Fecht, 8 April 2011 (accessed 4 April 2012) DeepFlight Challenger This deep sea submersible, currently in the construction and testing phase, seats one person. The company has stated that it will be able to dive to the deepest part of the ocean, which has been measured to be somewhere between 10.91 kilometres (6.78 mi) deep and 11.03 kilometres (6.85 mi) deep. Only two subs in history, the Bathyscaphe Trieste in 1960 and Deepsea Challenger in 2012 have ever reached the deepest known point in the ocean at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.History of the Bathyscaphe Trieste. http://www.bathyscaphetrieste.com/bathyscaphe_trieste.htmlNational Geographic, \\"James Cameron Completes Record-Breaking Mariana Trench Dive\\", Ker Than, 25 March 2012 (accessed 27 March 2012) The sub's outer casing is made of a carbon fiber composite and is designed to maximize hydrodynamics. The second level of casing holds the batteries, dive tanks and all other components. The third and inner most layer is made of titanium with a quartz crystal viewing dome. Instead of using ballast like a typical submersible the DeepFlight Challenger will \\"fly\\" to the ocean floor using propulsion. The DeepFlight Challenger uses a custom lithium-ion battery system to power its two motors. Five Dives project Over the course of 2012 and beyond, Virgin Oceanic plans for their one-person sub to journey to the deepest part of each of Earth's five oceans.Hawkes Ocean Technologies, Infosheet DeepFlight Challenger (accessed 25 March 2012) The first dive is planned for the deepest place on the planet: the bottom of the Mariana Trench ‚Äì about 11 kilometers (7 mi) below the ocean's surface. This will be the third time human eyes have set sight there. This time, the plan is for a sub that \\"flies\\" more akin to an airplane which should allow its solo pilot, Chris Welsh, to not only reach the deepest point on Earth, but to then \\"fly\\" along the bottom of the Trench for up to an additional 10 kilometers (6 mi). The second dive planned ‚Äì to the bottom of the Puerto Rico Trench ‚Äì will be piloted by Sir Richard Branson. This trench is the deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean at over 8 kilometers (5 mi) below sea level. This location is also near to Branson's home and resort on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands. Subsequent dives will be planned to carry a human pilot to the bottom of the Arctic, Southern and Indian oceans. Less than 3% of the seafloor has been explored, and none of the deepest points of the planet's oceans have ever been explored beyond a brief visit to one. The opportunities to see and learn from such dives are viewed as monumental. Key dates and timings Originally Virgin Oceanic's first dive was announced to be scheduled for August 2011 at the Mariana Trench later in 2011, and further dives were scheduled over the next 24 months. As of 20 September 2011 the research and development phase of the program has been extended due to work on design modification, this will extend the testing period through the end of 2011 and move the earliest opportunity of a first dive into early 2012. As of 21 February 2012, Virgin Oceanic reported successful tests of the ballast and life support systems. However, in June 2012, Welsh described a crack in the sub's protective quartz sphere which would necessitate the sphere's replacement before any deep dives could take place. By September 2012, variable buoyancy problems detected in summer testing had been resolved. Based on testing at high pressure, the DeepFlight Challenger was determined to be suitable only for a single dive, not the repeated uses that had been planned as part of Virgin Oceanic service. As such, in 2014, Virgin Oceanic \\"scrapped\\" plans for the five dives project using the DeepFlight Challenger, as originally conceived, putting plans on hold until more suitable technologies are developed.

Rosner got his training at State University of New York at Buffalo, New York; according to his own account he learned nothing there. Rosner developed an individual style that fused elements of Renaissance music with the heightened drama and rich sonorities of late romanticism. He composed three operas, eight symphonies, six string quartets, chamber music and songs. Many of his compositions were influenced by his Jewish background, but also by Catholicism. Most of his music is available on recording.

The entire area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.Metlika municipal site Geography Bojanja Vas is a clustered village on a slope on heavily karstified terrain. There are small fields on poor-quality soil to the south, vineyards to the east and south, and woods to the north and west. A water main was connected from the Jamnik Ridge northeast of the village in 1965, with the main water reservoir located west of the village, near Glavica Hill (493 m). Nearby caves include Kip Cave (), ≈†ulnovka Cave, Kadi≈° Cave (), Role Cave, and Tonƒçik Cave (). The Peƒçenjevka Chasm is located northeast of the village, where there is a 50 m waterfall from Jamnik Creek during heavy rains.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, pp. 447‚Äì448. Name The name Bojanja vas is derived from the Slavic hypocorism Bojan—ä, from the personal name Bojeslav—ä (literally, 'he who is renowned for fighting'). The settlement name literally means 'Bojan—ä's village'.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 69. Locally, the village is known as Bojanci. History In the past, a market was held next to the village church, from which a judge in Metlika collected fees. In 1492 the market was moved to Metlika due to the danger of Ottoman attacks. In 1756 there were six farms in the village belonging to the Dominion of Krupa. A community cellar is preserved from 1873. During the Second World War, Italian forces burned all but four of the houses in the village on 7 August 1942. After the Italian surrender, Partisan forces concentrated in the village. In 1944 and 1945, a Partisan checkpoint for the ≈Ωumberak field hospitals was active in Bojanja Vas. Mass grave Bojanja Vas is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The ≈†ulnovka Mass Grave () is located in a shaft in the woods 500 m east of the village. It contains the remains of unidentified civilians. Church The local church is dedicated to Saint Margaret and belongs to the Parish of Radovica. It was built in the 18th century.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 2203 It is a simple structure with a rectangular nave.

He received the United States military's highest decoration for bravery, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during the Battle of Trevilian Station in the American Civil War. Biography He was born May 14, 1834 and at the Battle of Trevilian Station in Virginia on June 11, 1864, he and four other soldiers were assigned to a twelve-pound-capacity brass artillery piece under direct command of Lt. William Egan, as part of the battery commanded by Lt. Alexander Pennington, within Gen. George Armstrong Custer's Michigan Cavalry Brigade. A squadron of cavalry led by Confederate Capt. Daniel A. Grimsley attacked their position, and a retreat was ordered. Kennedy and Pvt. Charles O'Neil remained at the cannon to cover the retreat of the rest of their unit, at some point becoming cut off from retreating themselves. They exhausted first their grape shot and canister shot, then their rifle and then pistol ammunition, finally being captured while continuing resistance with handspikes and sponge staffs. (Their position and the cannon were shortly recaptured in a Union artillery and cavalry counter-attack.) The captured privates were imprisoned at the Andersonville prison; Kennedy survived, and served after the war in the Regular Army, advancing to the rank of ordnance sergeant and retiring in 1891. He was nominated for the Medal of Honor in 1892 by Lt. Carle E. Woodruff, and this was endorsed by Pennington, at that point a major. He died September 28, 1910 and is buried in Oakland Cemetery Little Rock, Arkansas. His grave can be found in the Willow lot 298. Medal of Honor citation His Medal of Honor citation in 1892 described his actions as > Remained at his gun, resisting with its implements the advancing cavalry, > and thus secured the retreat of his detachment.

The title refers to the Hindustani equivalent of \\"E-flat\\". It was part of the trilogy, Meghe Dhaka Tara (1960), Komal Gandhar, and Subarnarekha (1962), all dealing with the aftermath of the Partition of India in 1947 and the refugees coping with it, though this was the most optimistic film of his oeuvre. The film explores three themes juxtaposed in the narrative: the dilemma of Anusuya, the lead character, the divided leadership of IPTA, and the fallout from the partition of India. Overview The title was taken from the line of a poemBook: Punascha, poem: Komal‚ÄìGandhar; by Rabindranath Tagore that meant a sur or note, E-flat. As in other films by Ghatak, music plays a pivotal role in the movie. Through the microcosmic perspectivising of a group of devoted and uncompromising IPTA workers, Ghatak with his signature style touches on varied issues of partition, idealism, corruption, the interdependence of art and life, the scope of art, and class-struggle. Unlike his other films, this one runs along an upbeat mood with the lead pair of lovers (Vrigu and Anusua) being reunited.

The program The foundation makes its home in the ahupuaa of Waipa, a valley on the north shore of the island of Kauai in Hawaii, . The Waipa stream flows through the valley and empties into Hanalei Bay. An ahupuaa is an ancient Hawaiian land division from mountains to the sea, often corresponding to a watershed district. It was used in traditional Hawaiian times as a way to distribute the resources of the land to the people. The mission of the foundation is \\"the physical and cultural restoration of the ahupuaa of Waipa\\".About the foundation Ecological restoration The restoration project at Waipa focuses on human interactions with plants and land. There are three types of sites. The first is native reforestation. Some of the plants being out planted are Acacia koa (Koa), Dodonaea viscosa (A'ali'i), Munroidendron racemosum, Pritchardia spp.(Loulu), and Microlepia strigosa (Palapalai). Some sites feature Polynesian introduction plants, such as Piper methysticum (Kawa) and Cordyline fruticosa (Ti). These plants all have value in Hawaiian ethnobiology. The last designation of restoration sites is agroforestry. Waipa is planting fruit and timber trees to satisfy this category. All of the agroforestry plantings are plants with commercial value. They can be harvested and sold as well as provide food and medicine. By planting the trees, Waipa community is rehabilitating the land as well as providing for the community.

Taxonomy It has traditionally included the more widespread S. opacus as a subspecies, but under the common name Paramo tapaculo (a name now used exclusively for S. opacus). The two have different voices, leading to them being split into separate species in 2010. Distribution and habitat The Paramillo tapaculo is endemic to humid highland scrub in the Cordillera Occidental in Colombia. At present it is only known from P√°ramo de Paramillo and P√°ramo de Frontino (also known as Paramo del Sol). It may occur elsewhere in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia. It is restricted to a narrow swath of treeline vegetation (scrub, stunted trees and Polylepis woodland) situated between montane forest and P√°ramo grasslands that is often just hundreds of meters wide. Description The Paramillo tapaculo resembles other Scytalopus tapaculos, being overall dark grey, but lacking the brown lower flanks of the Paramo tapaculo. Status and conservation Given the estimated extent of occurrence and observed decline in the extent and quality of habitat, the Paramillo tapaculo has an IUCN status of endangered. While locally common, the estimated area of suitable habitat within the known range of the Paramillo tapaculo is 3 km2 in total. Only 0.1 km2 is effectively protected by the Fundaci√≥n ProAves Colibri del Sol Bird Reserve (which also harbours the highly threatened dusky starfrontlet and Fenwick's antpitta).

Holbrook: \\"Space-filling curves\\", Springer- Verlag, New York, 1994 but have a branching, tree-like structure and are rooted. A space-filling tree is defined by an incremental process that results in a tree for which every point in the space has a finite-length path that converges to it. In contrast to space-filling curves, individual paths in the tree are short, allowing any part of the space to be quickly reached from the root. Kuffner, J. J. and S. M. LaValle: Space-filling Trees, The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, CMU-RI-TR-09-47, 2009.Kuffner, J. J.; LaValle, S.M.; ‚ÄúSpace-filling trees: A new perspective on incremental search for motion planning,‚Äù Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2011 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on , vol., no., pp.2199-2206, 25-30 Sept. 2011 The simplest examples of space-filling trees have a regular, self-similar, fractal structure, but can be generalized to non-regular and even randomized/Monte- Carlo variants (see Rapidly exploring random tree). Space-filling trees have interesting parallels in nature, including fluid distribution systems, vascular networks, and fractal plant growth, and many interesting connections to L-systems in computer science. Definition A space-filling tree is defined by an iterative process whereby a single point in a continuous space is connected via a continuous path to every other point in the space by a path of finite length, and for every point in the space, there is at least one path that converges to it. The term \\"space-filling tree\\" in this sense was created in a 2009 tech report Kuffner, J. J. and S. M. LaValle: Space-filling Trees, The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, CMU-RI-TR-09-47, 2009. that defines \\"space-filling\\" and \\"tree\\" differently than their traditional definitions in mathematics. As explained in the space-filling curve article, in 1890, Peano found the first space-filling curve, and by Jordan's 1887 definition, which is now standard, a curve is a single function, not a sequence of functions. The curve is \\"space filling\\" because it is \\"a curve whose range contains the entire 2-dimensional unit square\\" (as explained in the first sentence of space-filling curve). In contrast, a space-filling tree, as defined in the tech report, is not a single tree. It is only a sequence of trees. The paper says \\"A space-filling tree is actually defined as an infinite sequence of trees\\". It defines T_\\\\text{square} as a \\"sequence of trees\\", then states \\"T_\\\\text{square} is a space-filling tree\\". It is not space-filling in the standard sense of including the entire 2-dimensional unit square. Instead, the paper defines it as having trees in the sequence coming arbitrarily close to every point. It states \\"A tree sequence T is called 'space filling' in a space X if for every x ‚àà X, there exists a path in the tree that starts at the root and converges to x.\\". The standard term for this concept is that it includes a set of points that is dense everywhere in the unit square. Examples The simplest example of a space-filling tree is one that fills a square planar region. The images illustrate the construction for the planar region [0,1]^2 \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^2. At each iteration, additional branches are added to the existing trees.

Below is the subdivision scheme used to define a space-filling for a triangular region. At each iteration, additional branches are added to the existing trees connecting the center of each triangle to the centers of the four subtriangles. Image:Space_Filling_Tree_Tri_iter_1_2_3.png|Subdivision scheme for the first three iterations of the triangle space-filling tree The first six iterations of the triangle space-filling tree are illustrated below: Image:Space_Filling_Tree_Tri1.png|Triangle space-filling tree (Iteration 1) Image:Space_Filling_Tree_Tri2.png|Triangle space-filling tree (Iteration 2) Image:Space_Filling_Tree_Tri3.png|Triangle space-filling tree (Iteration 3) Image:Space_Filling_Tree_Tri4.png|Triangle space-filling tree (Iteration 4) Image:Space_Filling_Tree_Tri5.png|Triangle space-filling tree (Iteration 5) Image:Space_Filling_Tree_Tri6.png|Triangle space-filling tree (Iteration 6) Space-filling trees can also be constructed in higher dimensions.

Prenderville was an underage international player for Ireland when he signed for Coventry City from Cherry Orchard as a schoolboy. Having failed to make a first team appearance for Coventry, Prenderville went on loan to Scottish club Hibernian. Prenderville had a successful loan spell with Hibs, but had to return to Coventry in December 1998 after the two clubs failed to agree a fee for a permanent transfer. Prenderville was eventually released by Coventry in 1999. His form with Hibs earned him a move to Ayr United; this move did not work well, however, and he returned to Ireland with St Patrick's Athletic after making only six appearances for Ayr. Six months later, however, Prenderville returned to English football with Oldham. He was a consistent squad member at Boundary Park, but financial difficulties affected the club in 2002, and Prenderville was one of the players who were offloaded. Barry once again returned to Dublin in 2002, but this time with Shelbourne. He scored 3 goals in a total of 18 appearances including 2 in the Champions League qualifiers. When Eamonn Collins became St Pats manager in February 2003, he made Prenderville one of his first signings. His first season back at Richmond Park could be seen as somewhat of a personal success, as he made 39 appearances in all competitions. Prenderville played at right back, centre-half and in midfield. Prenderville was released by St Pats at the end of the 2005 season, and signed for Shamrock Rovers. He made his debut at Terryland Park in June 2006 but after only 2 league appearances Prenderville was released by the club in July 2006 \\"due to other commitments\\", which meant that he was \\"unable to participate fully with the first team's training schedule\\".

Water resources The Nile River and the Aswan. The River Nile has allowed for the summation of natural resources. This affects Egyptians through the course of agricultural lands and irrigation systems. In addition to this, Egypt has an expanding population and limited resources. Although, countries like that of Western Europe, Japan and North America have higher demands on world resources. As a result, Egyptians have less land to farm, however, produce more crops per person than Thailand or the Philippines. The management of the Nile is important for economic growth in Egypt. As a result, the effect has been that of an economic issue between various agents, both human and nonhuman agents. With the opening of natural resources and technological advancements through development projects in Egypt, it has historically created a range of feedback from Egyptians. Among these agricultural projects, the construction of villages were created to provide for the irrigation strategies following from that of Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt as a means of strengthening Egypt's economy at the height of its capitalist endeavors during the British occupation. As the movement of economic growth through a market that had difficulty measuring import and export of capital through, not only foreign trade but within Egypt's borders. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces have affected Egyptians during Egypt's revolutionary years. Starting from the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 environmental issues have increased by an array of actors taking a variety of direct actions in the public sphere. There has been an intense social protest in Egypt and increased demand for access to resources such as agricultural land. Presently Egypt's uncertainty with Ethiopia's project is correlated with an economic interest in that agricultural land will be affected when rising natural resource shortages are at a high. Egypt depends on fruit cultivated land that is found across the Nile and has sustained Egypt's agriculture for more than 5,000 years. Egypt's fresh water is mainly derived from underground water. Underground water results in 95% of Egyptian's desert land. Egypt is also dependent on rainwater but it is a scarce and limiting source for agricultural development. In addition, Egypt refuses agricultural drainage water in correlation with Nile water for irrigation. The importance of dams for Egyptians is exponential. The High Dam placed a halt on annual flooding of the Nile and allowed for extended sugarcane cultivation albeit the growing of wheat was displaced. The Nile floods provided brick making and house building labor. Mud became less available from the High Dam. The Nile allowed for 124 million tons of sediment to be carried to the sea each year and after the creation of the dam 98% of that sediment fell under the dam. Environmentally, the Aswan Dam has contributed to numerous issues for Egyptians. The expansion of desert areas since the Aswan High Dam's construction in 1970 has increased in soil salinity which allowed for waterborne diseases to emerge. In 1994, 28% of Egypt's soils were damaged by significant levels of salinity. The importance of water resources for Egyptians has contributed to the creation of agencies, such as the Egyptian Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs, that promote and protect Egypt's natural resources. The Nile Delta is currently under threat both from the rising sea levels (caused by climate change) and subsidence. The subsidence also brings with it salinization which in turn jeopardizes the fertility of the soil. Without adequate measures, 15 percent of the arable land could be lost due to salinization.Sinking sediment in deltas is as important as swelling seasReport: Nile Delta‚Äôs increasing salinity and rising sea levels may make Egypt uninhabitable by 2100Increased Land Subsidence and Sea-Level Rise are Submerging Egypt‚Äôs Nile Delta Coastal MarginThe Nile delta-Alexandria coast: vulnerability to sea-level rise, consequences and adaptation Pollution Air Pollution Air pollution in Cairo. The air pollution in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. The air pollution in downtown Cairo is more than 10 to 100 times of acceptable world standards. Cairo has a very poor factor because of lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect (bad ventilation and consequent trapping of pollutants). The main air pollution problem in Egypt is the particulate matter. The most notable sources of the dust and small particles are transportation, industry and open-air waste- burning. Another significant source is not the wind blown from arid areas around Egypt (e.g. Western Desert). The air in Egypt is very thick, grey and there is a haze over Cairo. Furthermore, other forms of air pollution in a carbon monoxide (CO) in streets, due to the excess amount of cars' exhaust and factories pollutants. The sky is grey rather than blue, which is very similar to the grey skies in Mexico City, London, and Beijing pollutants, of course, create a lot of respiratory diseases as the United States Environmental Protection Agency has published risk data which state that above the safe limit, the risk of developing serious respiratory diseases and cancer as well as cardiovascular disease from inhaling particulates in the air (dust & soot, hydrocarbons, and heavy metal compounds) is: 2 people for every 1000. Noise pollution From blaring car horns to wedding parties, rising noise pollution in the 24-hour metropolis of Cairo has reached alarming levels, leading to health problems. Living in the city centre, where noise levels reach an average of 90 decibels (dB) and never drop below 70 dB, is like spending all day inside a factory, a 2007 study by the Egyptian National Research Centre (NRC) said \\"What's striking about Cairo is that noise levels on different streets at different times of day are well over limits set by the environmental protection agency (EPA)\\". Noise pollution can contribute to many health problems.

The Sultan Al-Ghuri Complex, for example, is one of many buildings in the center of the city which is covered in a gray and black crust from the air pollution.Metwally, A.A. and A. Bakr Ramadan. The Role of Air Pollutants and Sewage Waste in Acceleration of Degradation of the Islamic Cultural Heritage of Cairo. Comparative Risk Assessment and Environmental Decision Making, 363‚Äì370. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands: 2004. Al-Ghuri is representative of issues of decay of historic buildings in Cairo, both because it is an important medieval site including a funerary complex and mosque, and because the encrustation that appears on it has been studied in detail. Other sites examined in detail in the Greater Cairo area include the pyramids at Giza, Bab Zuweila, Al-Azhar Mosque, and the Cairo Citadel. The black crust appears on the top parts of outside walls of monuments and other places of cultural and historical importance as a result of combustion of carbonaceous gases in an environment of rising humidity.Fitzner, Bernd, Kurt Heinrichs, and Dennis La Bouchardiere. Limestone weathering of historical monuments in Cairo, Egypt. 2002. In Natural Stone, Weathering Phenomena, Conservation Strategies and Case Studies edited by S. Siegesmund (ed.), Thomas Norbert Weiss, Axel Vollbrecht. In addition, white crusts and efflorescences appear on the lower sections of these walls. White crusts are formed by halite, or rock salt, depositions because of an increase in soil salinity. The rising, salt-loaded water table in the Nile Delta, where Cairo is located, deposits salts in foundation stones of monuments that rise up buildings through capillary action and are left behind as the water evaporates. The water table is rising throughout Egypt for a variety of reasons. These include sewage leakage and infiltration, factory or agricultural runoff, and inadequate groundwater pumping.Selim, S.A., A.M. Hamdan, and A.A. Rdy. (2014) Groundwater Rising as Environmental Problem, Causes and Solutions: Case Study from Aswan City, Upper Egypt. Open Journal of Geology, 4, 324-341. Buildings made of limestone like Al-Ghuri are susceptible to erosion by pollution because the crust that forms disrupts the integrity of the stone and falls off, removing the outer surface of the building with it. Many sites from the early Islamic era are falling into disrepair because of salt deposition from air and groundwater pollution as well as other destructive phenomena, and a major rescue effort is currently unfeasible because of the political and economic climate of Egypt.Cowell, Alan. Underground Pollution Imperils Egypt's Relics. New York Times, Jan. 30 1990. Salty and wet environments also lead to microbial growth. Without regular cleaning, historic buildings made of limestone, because of their high porosity, will continue to decay as a result of biological colonization. Encroachment of water  Sea levels are another environmental problem faced by those charged with protecting Egypt's archaeological sites. The city of Rosetta, nearby which the Rosetta Stone was found, for example, is on the Mediterranean coast and will be underwater in a matter of decades unless climate change is addressed on a global scale.El-Raey, M. Vulnerability assessment of the coastal zone of the Nile delta of Egypt to the impacts of sea level rise. Ocean & Coastal Management, Vol. 37 No. 1, pp 29-40. 1997. Abu Mena, an Early Christian site designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, is one place in imminent danger of destruction.Abu Mena, UNESCO World Heritage List. https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/90/ Accessed 5/15/2015. Efforts to reclaim land for agricultural use in the past few decades have waterlogged the usually dry and brittle clay that supports the buildings at Abu Mena.Threats to the Site (2001), Abu Mena, UNESCO World Heritage List. https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/90/indicators/ Accessed 5/15/2015. According to UNESCO, \\"The destruction of numerous cisterns, disseminated around the city, has entailed the collapse of several overlying structures. Huge underground cavities have opened in the north-western region of the town. The risk of collapse is so high that the authorities were forced to fill with sand the bases of some of the most endangered buildings, including the crypt of Abu Mena with the tomb of the Saint, and close them to the public.\\" Abu Simbel in the process of reconstruction, 1967. Egypt has faced similar issues in the past, with the damming of the Nile at Aswan. The creation of Lake Nasser to control the flow of the Nile through Lower Egypt and create hydroelectricity meant the flooding of sites like Abu Simbel.Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia. Activities, UNESCO. https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172 Accessed 5/15/2015. Abu Simbel is a monument to Ramses II built of sandstone, and comprises two temples to gods of the Ancient Egyptian pantheon. Emergency archaeological digs and projects were conducted to retrieve as much as possible from these sites that have been so well preserved by the arid climate.The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites. Activities, UNESCO. https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173 Accessed 5/15/2015. Abu Simbel itself was cut into pieces and moved to a cliff face above the new water level of the Nile above the dam.Mann, Mimi. Egypt's Abu Simbel Temples Threatened by Tourists, Birds, and Sands. AP, Dec. 27 1987. It now stands 60 meters above where it originally stood, on a cliff overlooking Lake Nasser. Another well-known monument moved during the rescue mission was the temple complex at Philae, a Greco-Roman site that was originally a temple to the Ancient Egyptian goddess Isis, now located on the island of Agilkia. Some monuments were given to foreign museums for their aid in preserving sites flooded by Lake Nasser. Four such monuments were the Temple of Debod, now in the Parque del Oeste in Madrid, Spain, the Temple of Ellesyia which is now in Italy, the Temple of Taffeh now housed in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden, the Netherlands, and the Temple of Dendur which is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The Pyramids of Giza. One of the largest environmental pressures on Abu Simbel is tourism and its associated issues. Landscaping conducted in order to make the site seem more presentable in its new clifftop home has damaged the delicate sandstone rock face. Landscapers brought in sand, which blew in the wind and almost eroded a face of Nefertari on the temple, one of the wives of Ramses II. In an attempt to solve this problem, grass was planted around the base of the temples. Watering the grass also damaged the site by raising the humidity levels in the sandstone. People are often careless at archaeological sites, brushing up against ancient wall paintings and climbing onto parts of monuments to capture photographs. Tourists have caused damage to other sites in Egypt, such as the Great Pyramid of Cheops.Meixler, Louis. Egypt closes pyramid to fix tourist damage. AP, Apr 6 1998. Read in The Daily Gazette. Much like the limestone monuments inside the city of Cairo proper, the limestone pyramids at Giza are susceptible to changes in humidity and salinity. The breath of tourists inside the chambers creates salt encrustations that crack the interior walls of the pyramids. The pyramids are constantly undergoing repairs to clean salt from the walls in an attempt to prevent further damage. Ventilation systems have been installed inside the Great Pyramid and in other structures on the Giza Plateau in order to lessen the impact of tourists' breath. Another problem that tourism brings is graffiti.Mostafa, Ramy. Two tombs restored, opened to public nearby Great Pyramid at Giza. Cairo Post, Apr 28 2015. Graffiti has been left in the chambers of the pyramids since they were being built over 4,000 years ago when workers building the pyramids left their mark on the walls. However, more recent graffiti at the Giza necropolis has damaged sites. Monuments often must be closed and renovated to remove marks made by modern visitors. In 2013, a Chinese tourist carved his name into a wall of the Luxor Temple, in the south of Egypt, causing widespread outrage and igniting an international discussion about tourists and graffiti in general.Wong, Hiufu. Netizen outrage after Chinese tourist defaces Egyptian temple. CNN, May 29, 2013. Development A view of the Pyramids at Giza from a nearby Pizza Hut, 2006. Tourism as well as urban sprawl have contributed to the degradation of sites, especially in the Greater Cairo area.Lancaster, John. Cairo's Urban Sprawl Threatens Pyramids. The Moscow Times, Dec 7, 1994. The Ring Road, provided for in the Master Plan for Greater Cairo passed in 1984, has been the biggest developmental threat to the monuments on the Giza Plateau in the last quarter century.Vignal, Leila and Eric Denis. Cairo as Regional/Global Economic Capital? 2006. From Cairo Cosmopolitan: Politics, Culture, and Urban Space in the New Globalized Middle East, edited by Diane Singerman, Paul Amar. The road was intended to relieve traffic pressure on the city of Cairo. It was discovered to be cutting through several protected areas on the plateau, which is the site of the pyramids, the Sphinx, and other lesser-known monuments. In protest of the planned southern route of the Ring Road, which would encompass the necropolis, UNESCO removed the pyramids from the World Heritage list to pressure the Egyptian government into changing the plans for the road. The shame and loss of funding resulting from this sanction forced the government to rethink the route of the highway, and the pyramids have since regained their standing as a World Heritage Site.Schoon, Nicholas. Egypt threatened over roads \`vandalism' near pyramids. The Independent, 19 December 1994. The city of Cairo has been encroaching on the Giza plateau for decades. The population has exploded so much that there are now apartments only a few hundred yards away from the pyramids. Suburban development, golf courses, and fast food chains now come much closer to the Sphinx and the pyramids than is legal according to UNESCO spokesman Said Zulficar. \\"You can't chop up this site just as if it's salami,\\" said Said, \\"It will lose its uniqueness... It's in total violation of the world heritage convention [Egypt] signed, and it's in violation of Egyptian law.\\" Urbanization Egypt is the most populated country in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) with over 96 million inhabitants. Since the majority of Egypt's geography consists of expansive desert, 43.1% of citizens live in urban areas along the Nile or Mediterranean Sea, such as Cairo, Alexandria, or Aswan. Cairo is not only the largest city in the Arab World, with a population 12.3 million,. but is also one of the densest. The governate of Cairo was reported to have an urban population density of 45,000 per square kilometer (117,000 per sq mi) in 2012 Cox, Wendell. \\"The Evolving Urban Form: Cairo,\\" Newgeography.com. June 13, 2012.(CAPMAS). This is 1.5 times the density of Manhattan. A report from United Arab Emirates University states, \\"This pattern of urban growth has two contradictory facets. On the one hand, mega-cities act as engines of economic and social growth, but on the other hand, most of this is also being accompanied by the urbanization of both poverty and environmental degradation.\\" Much of government policy has focused on population density as the main contributor to a multitude of social, economic, and environmental challenges such as noise and air pollution, heavy traffic, limited housing capacity, and poor public health.Argaman, Jon. \\"Cairo: The Myth of a City on the Verge of Explosion,\\" Jadaliyya. February 11, 2014. Cairo's government officials have been making efforts to decentralize living and working arrangements since 1970 as a way to improve quality of life. Rather than focusing on improving infrastructure within the city, many of the proposed solutions involve moving residents into recently constructed metropolitan areas in the desert. This tactic has introduced many of its own issues such as interference with agricultural practices and increasingly limited water access. Former President Mubarak emphasized the necessity of desert expansion in a speech to parliament in 2006, stating, \\"Leaving the narrow (Nile) valley and fanning out, in a planned and organized manner, throughout the country, has become an unavoidable necessity. In view of these facts, the conquest of the desert is no longer a slogan or dream but a necessity dictated by the spiraling population growth. What is required is not a token exodus into the desert but a complete reconsideration of the distribution of population throughout the country.\\" City planners have proposed the construction of megacities, built from the ground up, to diffuse populations out of Cairo. New Cairo and 6th of October City are brand new subdivisions built to hold millions by 2020 and hold major headquarters currently housed in Cairo.\\"To Catch Cairo Overflow, 2 Megacities Rise in Sand\\" article by Thanassis Cambanis in The New York Times August 24, 2010, accessed April 19, 2015 These planned cities are still under construction but are already home to large industrial areas and several universities. Most recently, the Egyptian government has proposed the construction of an entirely new capital city. However, reports show that these tactics have had limited success and a different approach is necessary in order to alleviate the impact of many urban problems. Traffic Heavy and chaotic traffic in Cairo. The greater metropolitan area of Cairo is notorious for its extreme levels of traffic congestion. The World Bank reports at least 1,000 deaths annually as a result of traffic related accidents, half of which are pedestrians. While an additional 4,000 Cairenes are injured from car accidents. Other urban areas, such as New York City, report less than 300 fatalities yearly from motor vehicle accidents. The traffic has grown to be damaging not only to public safety, but also economic growth. With an average traffic speed less than 10 kilometers per hour and an average commute time at 37 minutes, the congestion has grown to limit the city's productivity and efficiency. This has had significant economic effects, costing the country $8 billion annually, equivalent to almost 4% of Egypt's gross domestic product (GDP), resulting from lost work hours, wasted fuel, and the environmental impacts of those additional emissions. The high number of cars on the road is the result of many factors such as government subsidies on fuel, limited public transportation options, and enhanced credit opportunities from banks. In 2012, The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) reported 2.07 million licensed vehicles in Cairo. Attempts to reduce traffic congestion have increased in the last several years. Many government workers and urban planning experts believe in developing more efficient public transportation systems as a means to mitigate the effects of private cars. The Cairo Metro currently only runs three lines for the city's 7 million people. Christian Bauriedel, a professor at the American University in Cairo claims that the addition of 10 to 15 new metro lines and 200 new bus lanes has the potential to reduce traffic by 40%. A fourth line is scheduled to be built by 2019, however work has yet to begin. Another proposed solution has been the creation of pedestrian tunnels underneath the city to ensure citizen's safety while crossing roads.  A New Capital City  On March 13, 2015, Housing Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced Egypt's plans for a $45 billion project constructing a new capital city just east of Cairo. The new city, which is currently unnamed, is estimated to take only five to seven years to complete and house up to seven million people. Madbouly reported the goal of the project to be a major reduction in the congestion and population of Cairo, which is expected to double over the next 40 years. The city's brand new website describes the development as \\"a momentous endeavour to build national spirit, foster consensus, provide for long-term sustainable growth and address various issues faced by Egypt through a new city, which will create more places to live, work and visit\\". The plans have received skepticism for being fairly ambitious, boasting new administrative and government buildings, an international airport, a technology and innovation park, solar energy farms, eighteen hospitals, and thousands of schools and universities. The situation was complicated further when President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi cancelled the project a month after its unveiling due to a lack of government funds. However, Madbouly stated that the project will continue with funding from the private sector. Green Spaces As a Valentine's Day of Cairo's ever- growing urbanization, the components that enhance the city's livability have diminished. Incredible levels of traffic combined with severe air and sound pollution place a major hindrance on Cairenes' quality of living. The lack of urban green space is yet another one of these factors. Cairo currently only has about 1.65 square meters of green space per capita. This is low considering the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests a minimum of nine square meters per person, with the optimal amount being between ten and fifteen square meters. The presence of these spaces has been reported to reduce air pollution while incentivizing physical exercise, fresh food production and improved mental health. Cairo's minimal green space is surprising when considering the city's history of parks and landscaping. The capital was founded around a bustan, a modern-day park, and has since been filled with many different kinds of open spaces, such as basatin and mayadin. However, these open spaces with parks and gardens offered ideal locations for development and have since been considered attractive targets for profitable real estate. Today, Cairo's low quantity of parks has only been worsened by rapid increases in development and a lack of urban planning. Where green spaces do exist, they are poorly distributed and inadequately maintained. While some residents are hopeful that the establishment and development of satellite cities will improve conditions in Cairo, others are not as optimistic and foresee further neglect of green spaces in the future. Legislative power over land and water Egyptian Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency is the highest authority in Egypt for promoting and protecting the environment. It is also secondary to bigger ministries in Egypt like that of Petroleum, Industry or Finance. In 1997, Egypt's first full-time Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was assigned to deal with environmental policies for sustainable development. The Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs (MSEA) and its executive arm, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) considers the management of natural resources to all of Egypt's national policies and projects. The main objective is to preserve natural resources, biological diversity and national heritage in relation to sustainable development. Environmental Protection Agency scientists signed an agreement with counterparts in Egypt to protect human consumption from microbiological contamination in drinking water. Rural inequality is an issue in Egypt's agricultural development. Central government policies and wealth have been a core political issue concerning the relationship between rural population and state. International development, similar to the Grand Renaissance dam, is debated over proper management of resources. Timothy Mitchell, a political scientist of the Arab world, suggests that a solution may be to \\"decentralize the state and allow for some of the powers in Egypt's market to be reconfigured\\".Mitchell, Timothy. Rule of Experts: Egypt, Techno-politics, Modernity. Berkeley: University of California, 2002. Print. In this way, Egypt can counteract agricultural differences based on management of the Nile which is a shared agricultural source for most of the 9 countries dependent on its natural resources. The Grand Renaissance Dam issue Renaissance Dam location. Egyptian nationalists have denounced Ethiopia's new project, The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. The Great Renaissance Dam will be Africa's largest hydroelectric facility.Lewis, Martin W. \\"Egyptian Protests, Ethiopian Dams, and the Hydropolitics of the Nile Basin GeoCurrents.\\" GeoCurrents, 4 June 2013. Web. The construction of the dam will affect Sudan and Egypt's political relations with Ethiopia. In 1959 Egypt and Sudan made an agreement that allowed Egypt to have 70% of the Nile's water flow while Sudan had 30 percent.\\"War And Water: Hydropolitics Propel Balkanization In Africa.\\" Africanglobe.net. AfricanGlobe, 6 Feb. 2014. Web. In 2013 protestors gathered in front of Ethiopian embassy in Cairo, as then Morsi administration allowed for the project to proceed. Egyptian administrations have attempted military solutions to halt the project, but the Egyptian government at the time did not pursue. The Italian Salini (Salini Impregilo) Company is building the Renaissance Dam after signing a contract with the Ethiopian government in December 2010 worth $4.65 billion to be completed in six years. Egypt's Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation visited Italy to explain the country's water security. Egypt is continuing international influence to protect their share of the Nile waters, as well as contacting international donors, the World Bank and the African Development Bank to not give technical support for the construction of the dam in order to halt any damage to Egypt. Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn declared that Ethiopia would not back down from building the Renaissance dam. There was no clear agreement made by water ministers of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. Egypt planned to send foreign experts to follow on how to implement experts' reports on behalf of building the dam first. Egypt's influence to propose a halt on the Dam is at difficult transition. On April 13, 2014, Ethiopia's National Panel of Experts faced controversy with the International Rivers Network. The IRN, an anti-dam organization founded in 1985, criticized the Renaissance Dam's construction. The U.S. based environmental organization was accused of \\"being paid by Egypt in order to lobby against the Renaissance Dam\\". The main issue results in the debate about whether Egypt will be harmed, in terms of its water resources and population and the IRN is seeking to prevent international aid to Ethiopia's project. The creation of Grand Renaissance Dam would not affect Egypt's share of Nile as it is not constructed for irrigation but rather hydroelectricity. Water may be lost from evaporation but Egypt and Sudan will benefit from the dam due to the trapped sediments that would otherwise flow downstream prolonging lives of major reservoirs in both countries. Egypt has attempted to gain support in order to halt construction of the dam. As of April 25, 2014 Ethiopia has completed 32% of the Grand Renaissance Dam. Overview of Sudan and Egypt water relations The 1929 Agreement between Egypt and Sudan allowed Egypt to have more control over the entire flow of the river. However, when Sudan gained independence in 1956 there was demand for revision of the treatment. An agreement in 1959 allowed for 55.5 billion cubic meters of water to go to Egypt and 18.5 billion cubic meets to Sudan. Sudan has fertile land where expanded irrigation could be profitable. Sudan had tried to increase water supplies by draining the Sudd wetlands of the south. Sudan had faced a failed project, Jonglei Canal in 1984. Tension with Saudi Arabia Egypt has sought Saudi aid on halting the construction of the Renaissance Dam. Currently, Saudi Arabia invests in economic development projects based in Ethiopia. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have offered financial aid packages, approximately $10.7 billion, to the Egyptian government after the fall of the Muslim Brotherhood. The significance of Egypt and Saudi Arabi's relationship could either be beneficial for Egypt's goals in stopping the construction of the dam or prove otherwise. Egypt's hydropolitics The Nile River passes through 9 countries before it reaches the floodplains of Egypt. Egypt is part of the Nile Basin alongside Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The allocation of power over the use of the Nile has been a source of conflict for years. The Nile is a symbol of Egypt's nationalism which has led to strong opposition from neighboring countries. The Nile River provides irrigation, hydroelectricity and industrialization for Egypt. Egypt claims to support and stress the importance of water and agricultural projects in order to preserve its environment and allow for the Nile to develop an abundance of resources. Egypt has once threatened to go to war over water conflict against Ethiopia and Tanzania in the past. Regarding Egypt's current water conflicts, one current and controversial water issue is Egypt's current stance against the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. The Dam proposed by Ethiopia is an engineered gravity dam on the Blue Nile that will be one of the biggest water projects near the region. The issue then for Egypt, among other countries in the Nile Basin, is whether this project will decrease water flow in the Nile. The Nile Basin Initiative, Egypt's civil society, and foreign relations are a few of the main contributors to the historical and social framework Egypt's hydro-politics and environmental concerns. Egypt's hydro political framework *Nile Basin Initiative An initiative that mediates the Nile Basin for all countries that share the river in order to share socioeconomic benefits of the Nile and the promotion of regional peace and security. *Environment's Civil Society Egyptians are active on land rights and land reforms. The 1997 repeal of Nasser-era land reforms policies and the Land Center for Human Rights were some of the changes of Egypt's environmental political activism. In Sinai, Egypt the lack of land reforms to stabilize the security crisis in Sinai by Mohamed Morsi, Hosni Mubarak and Abdel Fattah el- Sisi. *Environmental foreign relations in Egypt Egypt has had a significant role to play in mediating conflicts of Arab States and East African states. Egypt was a mediator in resolving disputes between Arab states. Sudan and Egypt relations are weak; presently is a territorial dispute with Sudan over the Hala'ib Triangle. However, both countries are in agreement with the issue of water access and water rights on behalf of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Egypt's water resource projects in the Upper Nile When looking at Egypt's participation in water projects that promote economic and agricultural growth in the region and beyond, it is necessary to see the impact that Egypt has had in its own country and its participation with foreign relations. These are some projects in which Egypt has tried to utilize the Nile and nearby rivers. The Charter of Integration between Egypt and Sudan: *The Jonglei Canal project in Bahr al-Jabal and Bahr az-Zaraf Area was constructed to prevent waste of water, approximately 15 billion cubic meters, due to evaporation in swamp areas. *The Mashar Swamps project was created to collect lost water from Mashar swamps and Sobat River. *The Northern Bahr al-Ghazal project was constructed to combat the loss of intensive evaporation. The project was constructed by digging a canal in order to collect and channel water from the northern part of Bahr al-Ghazal with the White Nile. *The Southern Bahr al- Ghazal project was constructed so that the river waters from Bahr al-Ghazal would flow east towards Bahr al-Jabal. Additional Egyptian projects Along with the projects made between Sudan and Egypt; Egypt has considered storage projects in equatorial lakes: Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, Lake Albert. Egypt is in participation with Ethiopia and Uganda in some projects and establishing power generation stations. Egypt financed several contributions made to water conservation: the assessment of available water resources, climate change, drought, Basin's water quality, and water planning. Egypt has constructed over the course of its history several other projects, namely: Mahmoudiyah canal, Suez Canal, Aswan Dam, Toshka (otherwise known as the New Valley Project). The Aswan Dam was constructed as Egypt's main source of yielding electric power. The New Valley Project was designed as a second Nile Valley located in the south of Egypt's Western Desert. The East Owainat Project is another development project in the southern valley of Egypt which is irrigated by a nearby groundwater reservoir. The purpose of the East Owainat Project is to export organic crops for the trade of which these are: medicinal herbs, fruits, and various grains. The As-Salam Canal project is another development project that has a great impact on surrounding cultivated area with that of the Nile water and agricultural drainage water. The project Al-Ein Es-Sokhna New Port is located near the Suez Gulf and is a 4 km canal that connects the passage route of the Suez Canal to the Al-Ein Es-Sokhna New Port that has 4 basins that accommodate ships. These projects have contributed to water engineering, conservation, and distribution in Egypt and surrounding areas. View of the Aswan Dam.

Biography Born in London of Irish and English descent, Crimmins turned professional by joining the Mick Mulligan band in 1952. Originally self-taught, Roy was later mentored by the American bass trombonist with the Philarmonia Orchestra, Ray Premru, and the then Ted Heath principal trombonist, Don Lusher. With a career spanning 50 years, Crimmins has played and collaborated with many notable musicians, including Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Archie Semple, Alex Welsh, Freddy Randall, Harry Gold and Lennie Hastings. Collaborating with Alex Welsh in 1954, the pair started their own band and recorded with American guest stars such as the clarinettist Pee Wee Russell and Wild Bill Davison. The band was active for the following decade, and Crimmins moved to Germany in 1965 where he kept a consistent line-up and a regular group. From 1970 until 1977 he lived in Switzerland and formed his own band using the pseudonym of Roy King and recorded three albums. He toured Europe extensively during this era, and had his own television show in Vienna for five years. In the late 1970s, Crimmins went back to England and worked once again with Welsh until Welsh's death in 1982. In the mid-1980s, Crimmins was approached by Bob Wilber to join his Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington orchestras, interpreting the original Lawrence Brown, Tricky Sam Nanton and Juan Tizol trombone solos, performing at the Nice and North Sea Jazz Festivals. At this time, Crimmins was approached by the Mayor of Eilat, Israel, to advise on establishing an International Jazz Festival in Eilat. Roy's involvement in this venture led to the renowned Red Sea Jazz Festival. Soon after, Roy and his family moved to Tel Aviv where he established the Israel Jazz Ensemble, and was commissioned by Musica Nova (a breakdown group from the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra) to write a concerto, which premiered in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art to great acclaim. His music is still broadcast regularly. Roy Crimmins died aged 85 on 27 August 2014 in Tel Aviv, Israel, and is buried on a hill overlooking the Sea of Galilee.

It is an example of Late Gothic Revival church architecture, and it was built in the first few years of the twentieth century, being consecrated in 1909. It was built in the Parish of Burley to serve the population of the newly built red-brick terrace houses in the area, part of the late Victorian expansion of Leeds.Burley Parish Magazine February 1898, (with thanks to Stephen Savage) Whilst a functioning Anglican Church, it had an Anglo-Catholic flavour.Various St Margaret‚Äôs Church monthly Parish magazines It is a Grade II* listed building,Listed Building Gazetteer, Leeds City Council website, accessed February 2010 and was designed by Temple Moore. It was rescued from dereliction by a group of local Christians who turned it into an arts and creative space called Left Bank Leeds.  History  1897‚Äì1910 fund raising and Temple Moore The first church on the site was an iron building, temporarily erected to serve the newly built houses in the surrounding area. The first vicar was Rev A.H Kelk who took possession of the parsonage in 1897.St Margaret‚Äôs Church Monthly Magazine, January 1899 The iron church building was dedicated for use in March 1898 by Archdeacon Kilner, and for years served as the church building, Sunday school room and social venue. It was very hot in the summer, and right from the start, raising funds for a permanent church building were discussed. The first edition of the monthly parish magazine was in January 1899, for which subscriptions were sought, and around 800 were taken up. The parish decided it needed a separate Sunday school building as a priority, which was finally finished at Easter 1900, just in time for the Easter Parochial Tea.St Margaret‚Äôs Church Monthly Magazine, May 1900 The following years saw greater efforts at fund-raising for the permanent building, which included bazaars held in Leeds Town Hall, door to door canvassing and requests to neighbouring businesses and parishes, as well as the diocese itself. The money was raised, and architect Temple Moore was commissioned from 1901.Brandwood, GK, Temple Moore, an Architect of the Late Gothic Revival. Stamford 1997 (with thanks to Stephen Savage) The foundation stone was laid on 26 October 1907, the first phase of the building (with an unfinished west end) was completed in 1908, and consecrated in the following year. The first wedding in the newly consecrated church was on Easter Monday, 1909.Register of Services (with thanks to Stephen Savage) It is widely regarded as a particularly fine example of the Late Gothic Revival style and of Temple Moore's work. This later led to the building being accorded Grade II* listed building status. Temple Moore had also designed a vicarage and a First World War memorial, neither of which were built. 1910 ‚Äì mid-1990s The front (west) end was never completed to Moore's plans ‚Äì it was originally designed to have a huge tower and would have had something simple and easily removable for whenever works on that were to start. In 1911 St Margaret's became a separate parish.London Gazette, 10 October 1911 (with thanks to Stephen Savage) Parish life carried on in the building, with all the usual events and groups that are associated with Anglican parishes ‚Äì Sunday services, baptisms, marriages and deaths, men's society, confirmation classes, musical society, bazaars, Mothers Union, Whitsun parades, and groups for children and teachers, as well as the annual parochial excursion which usually took place around St Margaret of Antioch's feast day, 20 July.St Margaret‚Äôs Church Monthly Magazine, February 1902. The new vicar, Rev B. Combe, wrote in 1920 in the parish magazine: > \\"I am learning every week to understand better your pride in St Margaret‚Äôs > Church. For every week shews me new beauties in the building, and I am now > almost used to being introduced to fellow clergy with such additional > remarks as: \\"S Margaret‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôs the finest Church in Leeds\\". Its stern > grandeur in Lent, followed by its glory on Easter Day, was almost over- > powering\\".St Margaret‚Äôs Church Monthly Magazine, May 1920 In 1959 a Jubilee Building Fund was launched, with the intention of completing the church building. The original Temple Moore plans were deemed too ornate and expensive, and so the architect George Pace from York, who was a great admirer of Moore's work, designed the current west end which was completed in 1963. Sir John Betjeman knew and admired the building, especially the interior.From history researched and written by Stephen Savage With changes in demographics in the local area, and a more transient population, a deepening relationship and possible amalgamation with All Hallows Parish was mooted, but it did not come to pass.Joint Parish Magazine with All Hallows Church, 1970 Neither did a suggested amalgamation with St Michael's, Headingley.St Margaret‚Äôs Parish Magazine, April 1975 During the 1940s to the 1960s, the church played host to the Orthodox Liturgy and Communion in Slovak, the Polish Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church in Exile, as well renting a local house for Belgian refugees during the First World War. Throughout these years, until the 1970s, the tradition of the church and its services was maintained as Anglo-Catholic. The congregation declined in number, and by the mid nineties were down to only a few. Mid-nineties ‚Äì present The church was declared redundant by the Church Commissioners in March 1995 and the building closed for worship, within the congregation being combined with the neighbouring All Hallows parish and the church there being renamed St Margaret's and All Hallows. In 2001 the St Margaret's building was bought by a local congregation of Christians, who wanted to see the building used again and not fall into further ruin. It was used occasionally for special events and services but because of damage to the roof and an infestation of pigeons, the building became a health hazard and unfit for use. English Heritage funded essential building repairs as it was on the listed Buildings at Risk Register.Buildings at Risk Strategy and Register, Leeds City Council website, accessed February 2010 A steering group was formed to look at ways of bringing the building back into use and slowly a future vision came into focus. The building is a multidisciplinary arts venue called Left Bank Leeds. Its mission is to preserve the amazing venue in order to inspire and empower the community via a sustainable programme of arts and events that promotes creativity, connection and wellbeing. Left Bank Leeds has a programme of arts and events that include exhibitions, gigs, festivals, cinema, talks, afternoon teas and is open to the public as a co-working space. It was cited by The Guardian in The alt city guide to Leeds for its arts programme. The building is open to the public and is also available to hire for public events and private functions.

A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.  History  The term firewall originally referred to a wall intended to confine a fire within a line of adjacent buildings. Later uses refer to similar structures, such as the metal sheet separating the engine compartment of a vehicle or aircraft from the passenger compartment. The term was applied in the late 1980s to network technology that emerged when the Internet was fairly new in terms of its global use and connectivity. The predecessors to firewalls for network security were routers used in the late 1980s. Because they already segregated networks, routers could apply filtering to packets crossing them. Before it was used in real-life computing, the term appeared in the 1983 computer- hacking movie WarGames, and possibly inspired its later use.  Types  Firewalls are categorized as a network-based or a host-based system. Network- based firewalls can be positioned anywhere within a LAN or WAN.They are either a software appliance running on general-purpose hardware, a hardware appliance running on special-purpose hardware, or a virtual appliance running on a virtual host controlled by a hypervisor. Firewall appliances may also offer non firewall functionality, such as DHCP or VPN services. Host-based firewalls are deployed directly on the host itself to control network traffic or other computing resources. This can be a daemon or service as a part of the operating system or an agent application for protection. An illustration a network based firewall within a network  Packet filter  The first reported type of network firewall is called a packet filter, which inspect packets transferred between computers. The firewall maintains an access control list which dictates what packets will be looked at and what action should be applied, if any, with the default action set to silent discard. Three basic actions regarding the packet consist of a silent discard, discard with Internet Control Message Protocol or TCP reset response to the sender, and forward to the next hop. Packets may be filtered by source and destination IP addresses, protocol, source and destination ports. The bulk of Internet communication in 20th and early 21st century used either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in conjunction with well-known ports, enabling firewalls of that era to distinguish between specific types of traffic such as web browsing, remote printing, email transmission, file transfer. The first paper published on firewall technology was in 1987 when engineers from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) developed filter systems known as packet filter firewalls. At AT&T; Bell Labs, Bill Cheswick and Steve Bellovin continued their research in packet filtering and developed a working model for their own company based on their original first-generation architecture.  Connection tracking  Flow of network packets through Netfilter, a Linux kernel module From 1989‚Äì1990, three colleagues from AT&T; Bell Laboratories, Dave Presotto, Janardan Sharma, and Kshitij Nigam, developed the second generation of firewalls, calling them circuit-level gateways. Second-generation firewalls perform the work of their first- generation predecessors but also maintain knowledge of specific conversations between endpoints by remembering which port number the two IP addresses are using at layer 4 (transport layer) of the OSI model for their conversation, allowing examination of the overall exchange between the nodes.  Application/ Layer 7  Marcus Ranum, Wei Xu, and Peter Churchyard released an application firewall known as Firewall Toolkit (FWTK) in October 1993. This became the basis for Gauntlet firewall at Trusted Information Systems. The key benefit of application layer filtering is that it can understand certain applications and protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Domain Name System (DNS), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This allows it to identify unwanted applications or services using a non standard port or detect if an allowed protocol is being abused. As of 2012, the next-generation firewall provides a wider range of inspection at the application layer, extending deep packet inspection functionality to include, but is not limited to: * Web filtering * Intrusion prevention systems * User identity management * Web application firewall  Endpoint specific  Endpoint based application firewalls function by determining whether a process should accept any given connection. Application firewalls filter connections by examining the process ID of data packets against a rule set for the local process involved in the data transmission. Application firewalls accomplish their function by hooking into socket calls to filter the connections between the application layer and the lower layers. Application firewalls that hook into socket calls are also referred to as socket filters.

He would gather information on people's observations and make decisions as to what was kapu (strictly forbidden) during what times. Also, the concept of kuleana (responsibility) fueled conservation. Families were delegated a fishing area. It was their responsibility to not take more than they needed during fishing months, and to feed the fish kalo (Colocasia esculenta) and breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) during a certain season. The same idea of not collecting more than what was needed, and tending to the care of \\"wild\\" harvested products extended up into the forest. In modern times, this role is institutionalized within a central state government. This causes animosity between natural resource collectors (subsistence fisherman) and state legislature (local Department of Fish and Wildlife). Agroforestry Managing the forest resources around you is agroforestry. This includes timber and non- timber forest crops. Hawaiian agroforestry practices Religious Plants If a religious belief system influences a culture's practices in how the perceive and manage their environment, then that plant is part of a \\"sacred ecology\\". Hawaiian sacred plants include awa (Piper methysticum), which was used both religiously as a sacrament, and by the common people as a relaxant/sedative. Other religious plants that have shaped ecology are Ki (Cordyline fruticosa) Kalo. Ki is a sterile plant, so the wide distribution of the plant across the main Hawaiian islands indicated human activity; if not directly planted, then through gravitational fragmentation. Kalo was the staple starch crop of the Hawaiian diet. In Hawaiian genealogy, Haloa was the first born of Papa (Earth Mother) and Wakea (Sky Father). He was a still birth, so Papa went out and buried Haloa. Haloa then sprouted into the first kalo plant. Their second son they also named Haloa. He was charged with the kuleana to always care for his older brother. The historical Hawaiian people draw their direct lineage from Haloa, and did, and some still do, assume his responsibility to care for kalo. This responsibility, and need for food, drove the building of huge kalo growing complexes called loi.

Life and career  Frederick was a son of Edward Frederick, a British Army officer. He was educated at Eton, where he played for the school in the Eton and Harrow match in 1861, and Christ Church, Oxford. He made his first-class debut for Oxford University in 1864 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. In the 1864 season, he represented Oxford University in five first-class matches, and he was awarded his blue by appearing in the match against Cambridge University, which Oxford won by four wickets; his contribution, however, was just a single run in his two innings. Frederick also made his debut for Hampshire against Middlesex in the same season. In the return match against Middlesex, he claimed all of his four first-class wickets in Middlesex's first innings with figures of 4/45. Later in the season Frederick also made his debut for Middlesex, representing the county in a single first-class match against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He made yet another first-class debut in the 1864 season, this time for the Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club against the Gentlemen of Kent. In 1866 Frederick played for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Surrey. He represented the Marylebone Cricket Club in one further first-class match during that season against the Gentlemen of Kent. In addition, he represented Oxford University in a single first-class match against Southgate and played for Hampshire in a single first-class match against Surrey. In the 1867 season, Frederick represented Oxford University in four first-class matches, the last of which came against Surrey. In his ten first-class matches for the University, he scored 188 runs at a batting average of 11.05, with a high score of 39. In 1868, Frederick played for the Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club against Kent. In 1869 he played for Hampshire against the MCC and his final career first-class match was for the MCC against Kent. Frederick had a military career. In 1876, he is recorded as a lieutenant in the Inniskilling Dragoons and was appointed as aide-de-camp to the commanding officer of the Cavalry Brigade at Aldershot. In reports of MCC meetings in The Times in the 1890s, Frederick, who was on the committee, is identified as \\"Captain J. St J. Frederick\\". Frederick died at Camberley, Surrey on 10 September 1907 after what was described as \\"a long illness\\". The death notice records that he was a member of the Junior Carlton Club.

Diamond Cut Productions is the author of the popular audio editing and restoration program \\"Diamond Cut Audio Restoration Tools\\". This includes DC8, DC Live Forensics, DCForensics8 through DCForensics10.5, and DC Audio Mentor, and DCArt10.5. Diamond Cut Productions is also a record label having 21 music albums in its catalog featuring mostly music from the 1920s and 1930s. Much emphasis has been placed by Diamond Cut Productions on the Unreleased Edison Laterals collection of test pressings archived at the Edison National Historic Site, in West Orange, NJ. At present, Craig Maier and Rick Carlson remain the primary contributors to the company which now also invokes major developments in the areas of record restoration, audio restoration, through the continued improvements in the audio restoration software used to preserve Edison's test- pressing lateral recordings. Their company has expanded extensively into the field of Forensics Audio Enhancement and also including audio authentication and audio analysis which are widely used by various government agencies throughout the world. They maintain a website located at www.diamondcut.com. History Diamond Cut Productions was originally a private archival venture by Craig Maier and Rick Carlson that begun in response to proposed budget cuts to the Edison National Historic Site in 1986.\\"Budget Cuts Cast Shadow on Edison National Historic Site.\\", Kitta MacPherson, The Star Ledger, 1986 At the time Kitta MacPherson of The Star Leger reported on the deteriorating condition of the Edison National Historic Site and its archives located in West Orange, New Jersey. Among the many artifacts lacking proper curatorial attention resulting from funding deficiencies was a collection of test-press recordings made by the Edison Company between 1927 through 1929 (their last few years in the record business). Having read the disturbing article, R&D; engineer Craig Maier and software engineer Rick Carlson offered to volunteer their time and technical expertise in the areas of audio hardware and software engineering in order to preserve the Edison Lateral Record collection of test pressings by transferring them to digital tape for archival and preservation in the digital domain. Diamond Cut Laboratory Then Supervisor and Museum Curator, Dr. Edward Pershey, Ph.D. showed Craig and Rick the thousands of one- of-a-kind test recordings which were piled in stacks on a long row of tables on the second floor of the Edison main laboratory building. The total number of songs which were recorded numbered over 1200 with anywhere from two to five takes each, increasing the possibility of finding some truly important music that had remained unheard since the late 1920s. Following several meetings an informal agreement was made such that private funding could be sourced to construct the audio restoration laboratory required for the project. After seven months, enough funding was sourced to construct an audio in addition to designing and constructing several pieces of custom equipment required for the project. With the laboratory up and ready, Mr. Tom Owens of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical library in New York City was hired for his expertise in the area of archival audio transferring. Mr. Owens provided constructive criticism regarding the sound laboratory allowing them to improve upon their initial system. One significant problem which he had highlighted was that of establishing the correct turnover frequency for the transfer of the lateral test pressings. Documentation could not be found at the Edison site regarding the specifics of this important parameter, instead Craig and Rick had to devise and conduct experiments. This experimentation involved a \\"high-end\\" vacuum tube based Edison phonograph designed around the same time period as the test pressings in order to deduce the correct turnover frequency. The experiments proved useful allowing various modifications to be made to their magnetic phonograph pre-amplifier in order to provide the most likely proper turnover frequency for the transfers consistent with their era. With the laboratory and equipment in place, a seven year pro-bono contract was drawn up between the Edison National Historic Site / U.S. Department of the Interior, Rick Carlson and Craig Maier for the purposes of executing the archival project. Nearly one full year had lapsed before the first record was transferred to digital tape. Shortly thereafter, the sound lab was rebuilt in Rockaway Township, NJ where the lion's share of the transfer project took place over the next seven years. After transferring around 900 of the recordings (times 2 - 5 takes per song, about 2,200 transfers in total) Craig and Rick decided that the music was not doing much good sitting in the underground vault of a museum. It was decided to release some of this previously unreleased material (only around 200 of the songs had ever been released in the Edison lateral format). At the time it worked out to be significantly easier to form a company and release these songs under a new record label. Thus Diamond Cut Productions was formed in 1992 through Craig Maier and Rick Carlson providing their own seed capital for the venture. Test pressing releases onto CD 1992 The first release was titled \\"Unreleased Edison Laterals 1‚Äù. This CD was an anthology of Edison Needle type records which had undergone complex analogue audio restoration techniques. The album was of such a success in the market that another project was able to be started in 1994. 1994 The second release titled \\"The California Ramblers, Edison Laterals 2.\\" This project saw improvements on the audio restoration process which had been used on the previous release. Instead of analog signal processing, digital signal processing utilizing their own algorithms to remove crackle, ticks, pops and hiss from the original material were employed. This new process (which ran on an inexpensive pc) was named Diamond Cut Audio restoration tools or DC-Art for short. The digital signal processing technique proved so successful to the extent that the Smithsonian Institution Press employed Diamond Cut Productions to perform audio restoration for some of their American Songwriter Series of CD releases. 1995 Although no Edison recordings were released in this year, worked continued on improving the restoration software used for restoration of the many Edison recordings. During this time it was decided to make Diamond Cut Audio Restoration Tools (DC-Art16) available to other groups and the public with the focus on record archival and restoration. 1996 The third CD release was entitled \\"Hot Dance of the Roaring 20's, Edison Laterals 3\\" and was again processed utilizing Craig and Rick‚Äôs own audio restoration program. It was soon realized the digital audio restoration was superior and all analog processing equipment had been abandoned. In parallel with these efforts Craig worked with County Records to produce and release an Edison olde tyme group on CD called \\"Ernest Stoneman and his Dixie Mountaineers\\" using their audio restoration process. 2000 Since the early years, Craig and Rick have released numerous CDs from the Edison collections including \\"Vintage Vallee - Rudy Vallee and his Connecticut Yankees\\" which includes 23 of the earliest recordings made by this group in the late 1920s. In addition, other recordings released on the Diamond Cut Productions label include other artists including \\"Early Eddy Duchin - 1932 to 1937.\\" Future In the future, Diamond Cut Productions expects to continue releasing more CDs in their Edison Lateral Cut series. However, they have also branched out into other musical venues from the 1920s and 1930s. They are also continuing the development of their professional software product line and are up to DCForensics10.5 as of 2018. Within their commercial software product line, they have released DCart10.5 during the third quarter of 2018.

Examples such as this are found in textbooks: to cause gastrointestinal disorders, the food must contain more than 100,000 Salmonella per gram. However, in such a formulation, we immediately see an inaccuracy: to know the dose ingested, concentration is not enough. It is also necessary to know the mass of the portion: :d\\\\ =\\\\ c \\\\times m where: *d = number of bacteria i.e. dose *c = concentration of bacteria *m = mass Nevertheless, this formulation has served as a basis for very useful reasoning to establish the maximum concentrations permitted by the microbiological regulatory criteria intended to protect the health of consumers. Thus in 1992, as the outbreaks previously caused by Listeria monocytogenes involved only food containing more than 1000 L. monocytogenes cells per gram, lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic - keeping a margin of safety - fixed its maximum concentration at 100 L. monocytogenes per gram.  Dose-effect relationship and dose-response relationship  The concept of a dose-response relationship developed from 1995 onward, as quantitative risk assessment matured as a discipline within the field of food safety. An infectious bacterium in a food can cause various effects: diarrhea, vomiting, sepsis, meningitis, abortion, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, death, etc. As the dose increases, the severity of the pathological effects increases, and a \\"dose- effect relationship\\" can often be established. For example, the higher the dose of Salmonella, the more diarrhea occurs soon after ingestion and the more stressful it is. However, among people who have ingested the same dose, not all are affected. The proportion of people affected is called the response. The dose-response relationship for a given effect (e.g., diarrhea) is therefore the relationship between the dose and the likelihood of experiencing this effect. When the response is less than about 10%, it is observed that there is a strictly proportional relationship between dose and response: :P\\\\ \\\\approx\\\\ r \\\\times d where: *P = probability of the effect considered *r = response The dose-effect relationship and the dose-response relationship should not be confused.  Consequences  The existence of this relation has a first important consequence: the proportionality factor, symbolized by the letter r, corresponds precisely to the probability of the effect considered when the dose is equal to one bacterial cell. As a result, the minimum infective dose is exactly equal to one bacterial cell: this is far from the traditional notion mentioned at the beginning of this article. Proportionality has a second consequence, which is obvious: when the dose is divided by ten, the probability of observing the effect is also divided by ten. There is a third consequence, which is not so obvious: it is a relationship without threshold. Of course, if a portion of food does not contain the bacterium, there will be no effect. But in industrial practice, everything is done to reduce the probability that a serving contains the bacterium. There is therefore on the market food in which, for example, only one serving in a hundred is contaminated. The probability of the effect considered is then r / 100. If one in ten thousand is contaminated, the probability goes to r / 10,000, and so on. The line representing the relation can be extended towards zero: there is no threshold. If the probability of not being infected when exposed to one bacterium is 1-r then the probability of not being infected by bacteria would be (1-r)^n\\\\approx\\\\exp(-nr), so the probability of being infected is 1-\\\\exp(-nr). For readers familiar with the notion of D50 (the dose that causes the effect in 50% of consumers exposed to the hazard), in most cases the following relationship thus applies: :D50\\\\ =\\\\ -Ln(0.50)\\\\ / \\\\ r\\\\ \\\\approx 0.7\\\\ / \\\\ r  Comparisons  To compare the dose- response relationships for different effects caused by the same bacterium, or for the same effect caused by different bacteria, we can of course directly compare the values of r. However, experience shows that it may be easier for the mind to compare the doses causing the effect in 50% or 1% of consumers. Here are some values of D1 (dose causing the effect considered in 1% of consumers exposed to the hazard): * Escherichia coli (EHEC), haemolytic-uremic syndrome in children under 6 years: 8.4 bacterial cells; * Escherichia coli (EHEC), haemolytic-uraemic syndrome in children aged 6 to 14 years: 41.9 bacterial cells; * Listeria monocytogenes, severe listeriosis in the general population: 4.2.1011 bacterial cells; * Listeria monocytogenes, severe listeriosis in the susceptible population: 9.5.109 bacterial cells. These examples highlight two important things: # D1 and r depend not only on the bacterium and the effect considered, but also on the belonging to categories of consumers susceptible to the disease; therefore, there are as many dose- response curves as there are pathogens, health effects and sensitivities of exposed individuals; # For the bacteria of the examples above, the orders of magnitude of the values of D1 are profoundly different. The hygiene practices and control measures that food chain businesses must implement against these bacteria are therefore not comparable.  Risk management  It may seem that if the contamination of food with a pathogenic bacterium is low and infrequent, the risk of becoming ill is such that there will be no public health problem. Such a view is incomplete: admittedly, consuming a low dose of this bacterium is associated with a low probability of disease. But this probability is not zero. This explains the sporadic cases observed in the population. And that is also why there is no concentration in food below which there will be no epidemic.  Toxigenic bacteria  In the foregoing, there was mention of bacteria contaminating foods that cause infection in or from the digestive tract. Other food-borne bacteria can cause disease by producing toxins. It is no longer about infection, but toxication. Among these bacteria, some synthesize a toxin only when their concentration in the food before ingestion exceeds a threshold. This is the case of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, for example. The concept of MID does not apply to them, but there is indeed a concentration (not a dose) below which they do not constitute a danger to the health of the consumers.

Cavitation is the formation of cavities, which are spaces or openings in the body. This process occurs in mammalian embryos, and can also occur later on in fully developed organisms. During mammalian embryo development, cavitation is a routine process; however, the formation of cavities in fully developed organs, especially in lung tissue, is usually the sign of a severe medical condition or disease, such as tuberculosis. 8th edition. Developmental After the process of cavitation occurs the blastocoel forms. Following the formation of the blastocoel, the inner mass of cells positions itself in one portion of the inner cavity, while the rest of the cavity is filled with fluid. Cavitation is a crucial process in the development of mammalian embryos. After fertilization, rapid cell division occurs which results in the formation of the morula, or a solid ball of cells. The morula is the precursor structure to the blastula, which is an animal embryo in the early stages of development. The morula consists of a cluster of internal cells covered by a layer of external cells. The internal cells become the inner cellular mass, which becomes the entire embryo. The external cells are destined to become a structure called the trophoblast, a layer of tissue on the inside of the embryo that provides it with nourishment. The trophoblast cells become extraembryonic structures necessary for development. After the initial formation of the morula, it does not have an interior space or cavity. Cavitation occurs to create a cavity on the inside of the morula. This process occurs when trophoblast cells, in other words the outside covering of the blastocyst, secretes fluid into the morula creating the blastocoel, the fluid filled cavity of the blastula. The formation of the blastocoel is a critical stage in the formation of the blastocyst, which is a blastula where some cellular differentiation has already occurred.

The capital lies at Nchelenge. As of the 2000 Zambian Census, the district had a population of 111,119 people. Nchelenge is one of the twelve districts of Luapula Province in Zambia, second largest by population size (only next to the provincial capital, Mansa). Other districts being Mansa, Kawambwa, Milenge, Mwense, Chienge, Chembe, Chipili, Chifunabuli, Mwansabombwe, Lunga and Samfya. The district, located north of Luapula province some 250km away from Mansa is the most densely populated of all the districts in the province at 45 persons per square kilometer. The district has a total surface area of 4.092square kilometers (60% land, 30% water and 10% swamps). The district shares borders with Democratic Republic of the Congo in the west, Chienge District in the north, Kaputa District in the north-east and Kawambwa District in the south-east. Lake Mweru marks the boundary between Nchelenge and Congo DR. Socio-economic profile The inhabitants of Nchelenge are mainly fishers or fishmongers. Due to overfishing, there has been a shift to farming in the past few years to meet people's basic economic needs. The selling of fish and timber, as well as general trading, comprise the main economic activities carried out by people, accounting for some 80 percent of the workforce. The remaining 20 percent are formally employed workers mostly in government departments and various non-governmental organizations in the area. The transport sector in the district has also increased. Banking services are offered by the National Savings Bank and the Zambia National Commercial Bank; the latter operating as a mobile bank twice weekly from Kawambwa district, located about 90 kilometers from Nchelenge district.https://www.daily- mail.co.zm/?p=52239 Education services The district has 51 government primary schools, four day secondary schools, one boarding secondary school, five private schools and one nursing school. with the coming in of over 12,000 refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo into the district, two new additional schools (one primary and one combined primary & secondary school) have been constructed and commissioned for both the refugee and host communities. The literacy level is low, with only thirty percent of the population completing primary education, forty percent attaining the ninth grade, and only ten percent completing the twelfth grade. The remaining twenty percent of the population does not attend school at all. Seventy percent of all students are male, and female students who drop out generally marry young, while male drop-outs tend to pursue careers in the fishing industry. These factors have had a negative impact on the developmental and economic advancements of the district. Road network The district is linked to Mansa (the provincial capital) by a paved road as far as St. Paul Hospital. All other roads are unpaved, which renders them impassable during the rainy season. Water transport Lake Mweru links Zambia with the Democratic Republic of Congo, and also with four islands: Kilwa, Chisenga, Isokwe and Kanakashi. Large vessels (ichombos) and smaller boats are used to transport traders and consumer goods on the lake as well as along the Luapula River. More modern boats to improve water transport in this area. The mobile hospital unit in the district has two new boats. A passenger and an ambulance boat were added to its fleet, thus improving water transport and accessibility of health services for the island's population. The cost of fuel is the largest expense, which limits the economic practicality of this type of transportation. Communication The district is connected by phone and internet facilities. All the health facilities use cell phones, because all facilities have no functioning radios. Postal services are also available. The communication system in the district is fairly good with reliable television and radio reception. Air transport The district has one airport for light aircraft situated just 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from the district central location. The aerodrome is located just 600m east of St. Paul's General Hospital. At 900meters long, the facility's runway is the best in the province, only second to the one in Mansa, the provincial capital. Energy The district is connected to the national grid up to Mukwakwa and 10 percent of the households have access to electrical power for lighting and cooking purposes. The rest of the district uses solar power, charcoal, or firewood as alternative sources of energy. Governance The Nchelenge district is run by the District Commissioner assisted by the district administrative office and heads of government departments. Traditional leaders play an important governance role in the running of the district, which has four chiefs: Chief Kambwali, Chieftainess Kanyembo, Chief Nshimba and Chief Muyembe. Other traditional leaders include headmen and women who assist the chiefs.

He was appointed by Ralph Morice, Thomas Cranmer's secretary, to be rector of Chartham, Kent, where he neglected Catholic rites.Alec Ryrie, ‚ÄòTurner, Richard (d. in or before 1565)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 , accessed 13 Feb 2010. He was a staunch supporter of royal supremacy, and was able to avoid the dangers besetting an ecclesiastic under Henry VIII. In 1543 a bill of accusation was presented against him and others of Cranmer's chaplains and preachers at the sessions for not complying with the statute of the Six Articles; this attack was aimed at Cranmer himself, who however possessed the favour of the king, and the indictments in consequence came to nothing. Turner was at that time living in the family of Ralph Morice. On 1 July 1545 Turner was instituted to the vicarage of St. Stephen's-by-Saltash in Cornwall; he has been doubtfully identified with the Richard Turner who was appointed rector of Chipping Ongar in Essex in 1544, and vicar of Hillingdon in Middlesex in 1545. In July 1549, during popular unrest in Kent against the reformers, Turner went to the rioters' camp and preached against them, narrowly escaping being hanged. Turner suggested to John Marbeck, organist at Windsor, the compilation of his concordance of the English Bible which appeared in July 1550. He had been appointed one of the Six Preachers in Canterbury Cathedral in 1550.Derek Ingram Hill, The Six Preachers of Canterbury Cathedral, Canterbury: K. H. McIntosh (1982) 19-20. On 24 December 1551 he was appointed to a prebend at Windsor, and he also about this time obtained the vicarage of Dartford in Kent. In the following year he was recommended by Cranmer for the archbishopric of Armagh, but declined, chiefly on the grounds of his ignorance of the Irish language. On the accession of Mary I of England he went into exile. In 1555, while at Frankfurt, he joined with other English refugees in publicly repudiating John Knox's principles on civil government. They took exception to several passages in Knox's Faythfull Admonition unto the professours of Gods Truthe in England, assailing Queen Mary, Philip, and the Emperor Charles V. They drew the attention of the town authorities to Knox's views, and he was in consequence expelled. In Basle he delivered lectures on the epistles to the Hebrews and to the Ephesians, and on the general epistle of St. James, which were ‚Äòfit for the press,‚Äô according to Anthony Wood, in 1558, but were not published. Turner returned to England on the accession of Elizabeth I, and in 1559 was restored to the vicarage of Dartford. In the following year he was selected by Matthew Parker as a visitor to reform abuses in the two Kentish dioceses. He probably died in 1565, when he was succeeded as vicar by John Appelbie.

Based on a 1957 play by Ronald Alexander, the film stars Clifton Webb, Jane Wyman, Jill St. John and Carol Lynley. Plot Robert Dean (Clifton Webb) is an old-fashioned psychologist who reluctantly allows his oldest daughter Meg (Jill St. John) to join a four-week tour in S√£o Paulo before returning to college in America. When he finds out she is planning on six more weeks, he immediately books a ticket to Brazil to find out what her true motives for staying are. He is accompanied by his loving wife Mary (Jane Wyman) and youngest daughter, the wise-cracking, joyful Betsy (Carol Lynley). Upon arriving, Robert is unamused by the notable character change in a daughter. She looks to be very much interested in her older mentor Eduardo Barroso (Paul Henreid), and has taken up habits which are shocking to Robert, including smoking. Unaware of her daughter's engagement with Barroso's son Carlos (Nico Minardos), Robert mistakes Eduardo for being Meg's love interest. Meanwhile, Betsy is enjoying the attention she is receiving from the United States Air Force, and falls in love with Sgt. Paul Gattling (Gary Crosby). Back at the hotel, Carlos is reluctant to meet Meg's parents, thinking they will disapprove of his bohemian lifestyle. By assuming the worst, Carlos makes a horrible impression on Robert, who tries to prohibit his daughter from seeing them by booking a flight to Rio de Janeiro and then Lima for the family. Feeling betrayed by her father, Meg calls Carlos to tell him goodbye, and he responds by confronting her with leading her father's life. Nevertheless, he and Eduardo follow her to Lima, where Carlos and Meg are reunited at a bull fight. Soon after, Paul, who has set out to Lima as well, proposes to Betsy, but she rejects him, explaining she is not ready to marry. Later that night, Eduardo and Carlos announce they are returning to S√£o Paulo the following day. Robert eventually reluctantly allows his daughter to accompany her future husband. After bidding her daughter farewell, Robert goes to a bar and gets drunk. He ends up lying unconscious on the street and is mistaken for being a member of a Spanish tour group. Upon awaking, Robert finds out he is on a plane heading for Madrid and is eventually dropped off in Trinidad. There, he phones Meg to give her his sincere blessing for marrying Carlos, but she announces she is not in love with Carlos any longer. Betsy, on the other hand, desires to marry Paul. Upon asking her father for permission, he declares that she is old enough to make her own decisions, after which she is officially engaged to Paul.

Gene Tierney was initially set to star as Mrs. Mary Dean, but she dropped out last minute due to illness.Jane Wyman: a Biography by Morella,Edward Z. Epstein, p.207 In February 1959, the studio negotiated with Joan Fontaine to replace her, but Fontaine collapsed and eventually Jane Wyman was assigned. In August 1957, Suzy Parker was cast in a role, but she eventually withdrew. The role of Meg was originally offered in January 1959 to Diane Varsi, but she refused it and abandoned her contract with 20th Century Fox only months later. Diane Baker was announced as her replacement, but the role eventually went to Jill St. John.

The algorithm is one of the first efficient methods to solve such a congruence. It was described by H.C. Pocklington in 1917.H.C. Pocklington, Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, Volume 19, pages 57‚Äì58 The algorithm (Note: all \\\\equiv are taken to mean \\\\pmod p, unless indicated otherwise.) Inputs: * p, an odd prime * a, an integer which is a quadratic residue \\\\pmod p. Outputs: * x, an integer satisfying x^2 \\\\equiv a. Note that if x is a solution, ‚àíx is a solution as well and since p is odd, x eq -x. So there is always a second solution when one is found. Solution method Pocklington separates 3 different cases for p: The first case, if p=4m+3, with m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, the solution is x \\\\equiv \\\\pm a^{m+1}. The second case, if p=8m+5, with m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} and # a^{2m+1} \\\\equiv 1, the solution is x \\\\equiv \\\\pm a^{m+1}. # a^{2m+1} \\\\equiv -1, 2 is a (quadratic) non-residue so 4^{2m+1} \\\\equiv -1. This means that (4a)^{2m+1} \\\\equiv 1 so y \\\\equiv \\\\pm (4a)^{m+1} is a solution of y^2 \\\\equiv 4a. Hence x \\\\equiv \\\\pm y/2 or, if y is odd, x \\\\equiv \\\\pm (p+y)/2. The third case, if p=8m+1, put D \\\\equiv -a, so the equation to solve becomes x^2 + D \\\\equiv 0. Now find by trial and error t_1 and u_1 so that N = t_1^2 - D u_1^2 is a quadratic non-residue. Furthermore, let :t_n = \\\\frac{(t_1 + u_1 \\\\sqrt{D})^n + (t_1 - u_1 \\\\sqrt{D})^n}{2}, \\\\qquad u_n = \\\\frac{(t_1 + u_1 \\\\sqrt{D})^n - (t_1 - u_1 \\\\sqrt{D})^n}{2 \\\\sqrt{D}}. The following equalities now hold: :t_{m+n} = t_m t_n + D u_m u_n, \\\\quad u_{m+n} = t_m u_n + t_n u_m \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad t_n^2 - D u_n^2 = N^n. Supposing that p is of the form 4m+1 (which is true if p is of the form 8m+1), D is a quadratic residue and t_p \\\\equiv t_1^p \\\\equiv t_1, \\\\quad u_p \\\\equiv u_1^p D^{(p-1)/2} \\\\equiv u_1. Now the equations : t_1 \\\\equiv t_{p-1} t_1 + D u_{p-1} u_1 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad u_1 \\\\equiv t_{p-1} u_1 + t_1 u_{p-1} give a solution t_{p-1} \\\\equiv 1, \\\\quad u_{p-1} \\\\equiv 0. Let p-1 = 2r. Then 0 \\\\equiv u_{p-1} \\\\equiv 2 t_r u_r. This means that either t_r or u_r is divisible by p. If it is u_r, put r=2s and proceed similarly with 0 \\\\equiv 2 t_s u_s. Not every u_i is divisible by p, for u_1 is not. The case u_m \\\\equiv 0 with m odd is impossible, because t_m^2 - D u_m^2 \\\\equiv N^m holds and this would mean that t_m^2 is congruent to a quadratic non-residue, which is a contradiction. So this loop stops when t_l \\\\equiv 0 for a particular l. This gives -D u_l^2 \\\\equiv N^l, and because -D is a quadratic residue, l must be even. Put l = 2k. Then 0 \\\\equiv t_l \\\\equiv t_k^2 + D u_k^2. So the solution of x^2 + D \\\\equiv 0 is got by solving the linear congruence u_k x \\\\equiv \\\\pm t_k. Examples The following are 4 examples, corresponding to the 3 different cases in which Pocklington divided forms of p. All \\\\equiv are taken with the modulus in the example. Example 0 :x^2 \\\\equiv 43 \\\\pmod {47}. This is the first case, according to the algorithm, x \\\\equiv 43^{(47+1)/2} = 43^{12} \\\\equiv 2, but then x^2=2^2=4 not 43, so we should not apply the algorithm at all. The reason why the algorithm is not applicable is that a=43 is a quadratic non residue for p=47. Example 1 Solve the congruence :x^2 \\\\equiv 18 \\\\pmod {23}. The modulus is 23. This is 23 = 4 \\\\cdot 5 + 3, so m=5. The solution should be x \\\\equiv \\\\pm 18^6 \\\\equiv \\\\pm 8\\\\pmod {23}, which is indeed true: (\\\\pm 8)^2 \\\\equiv 64 \\\\equiv 18\\\\pmod {23}. Example 2 Solve the congruence :x^2 \\\\equiv 10 \\\\pmod{13}. The modulus is 13. This is 13 = 8 \\\\cdot 1 + 5, so m=1. Now verifying 10^{2m+1} \\\\equiv 10^3 \\\\equiv -1\\\\pmod{13}. So the solution is x \\\\equiv \\\\pm y/2 \\\\equiv \\\\pm (4a)^{2}/2 \\\\equiv \\\\pm 800 \\\\equiv \\\\pm 7\\\\pmod{13}. This is indeed true: (\\\\pm 7)^2 \\\\equiv 49 \\\\equiv 10\\\\pmod{13}. Example 3 Solve the congruence x^2 \\\\equiv 13 \\\\pmod {17}. For this, write x^2 -13 =0. First find a t_1 and u_1 such that t_1^2 + 13u_1^2 is a quadratic nonresidue. Take for example t_1=3, u_1 = 1. Now find t_8, u_8 by computing :t_2 = t_1 t_1 + 13u_1u_1 = 9-13 = -4 \\\\equiv 13\\\\pmod {17}, :u_2 = t_1u_1 + t_1u_1 = 3+3 \\\\equiv 6\\\\pmod {17}. And similarly t_4 = -299 \\\\equiv 7 \\\\pmod {17}, u_4=156 \\\\equiv 3\\\\pmod {17} such that t_8=-68 \\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod {17}, u_8 = 42 \\\\equiv 8\\\\pmod {17}. Since t_8 = 0, the equation 0 \\\\equiv t_4^2 + 13u_4^2 \\\\equiv 7^2 - 13 \\\\cdot 3^2\\\\pmod {17} which leads to solving the equation 3x \\\\equiv \\\\pm 7\\\\pmod {17}. This has solution x \\\\equiv \\\\pm 8\\\\pmod {17}. Indeed, (\\\\pm 8)^2 = 64 \\\\equiv 13\\\\pmod {17}.

Besides enabling the bearer to travel internationally and serving as indication of Polish citizenship, the passport facilitates the process of securing assistance from Polish consular officials abroad or other European Union member states in case a Polish consular is absent, if needed. According to the 2017 Visa Restrictions Index, Polish citizens can visit 162 countries without a visa or with a visa granted on arrival. Polish citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty.Treaty on the Function of the European Union (consolidated version) Every Polish citizen is also a citizen of the European Union. The passport, along with the national identity card allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the European Union, European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Issuance and validity The passports are issued by the Ministry of the Interior and applications are filed at voivodeship offices which have a passport office. Passports issued since mid-2006 are of a biometric variety, and valid for ten years. The blue cover passports issued up until 2001 and burgundy-cover passports (issued up until 2006) remain valid until their state expiry dates, however their lack of biometric features inherently means that they have slightly different visa restrictions for travel abroad as they are considered to have insufficient security features by some nations, such as Canada (allows visa-free access only for Polish citizens in possession of a biometric passport). Full Polish passports are issued for a period of ten years, whilst those issued to minors are valid up to an initial maximum of five years. Holders of passports issued before April 13, 1993 who seek to renew their passports require the additional document \\"Confirmation of Polish Citizenship\\" issued by their local provincial authority. Temporary passports are issued for a period of one year. Previous and current passport designs The complete set of pages from a Polish passport issued in 1931. At this time Polish passports were printed in only Polish and French The Polish passport from today is much different from those that appeared after World War One, following the creation of the Second Polish Republic. The passports began to appear around 1920 and were of simple paper, design and quality. These lasted until around 1929 when hard covered blue-jacket passports were designed and printed on good quality watermarked paper. These blue passports were used through World War Two and were continued to be issued to Polish refugees after the war from Polish consulates in foreign countries until at least 1947. During the years of the People's Republic of Poland, 1952-1989, another design was adopted consisting of the Polish, French and Russian languages. In addition during this period, the crown of the Polish white eagle was absent from the emblem on the passport cover. Physical appearance and data contained The Polish passports issued since 2006 are burgundy, with the words (EUROPEAN UNION) and (REPUBLIC OF POLAND) inscribed at the top of the front cover. The Polish white eagle is emblazoned in the centre of the cover, and below this the words , \\"PASSPORT\\" are to be found. The Polish passport has the standard biometric symbol emblazoned below the final set of text denoting the document as a passport, and uses the standard European Union design. Diplomatic passports are also burgundy in colour and of essentially the same design, but the French, English and Polish translations of the word 'passport' are replaced with those for 'diplomatic passport'; , \\"DIPLOMATIC PASSPORT\\". Temporary passports have the words , \\"TEMPORARY PASSPORT\\" on the front cover and contain 16 pages. They do not bear the biometric passport logo. The statement in a Polish passport declares in Polish, English: ::THE AUTHORITIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND HEREBY KINDLY REQUEST ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN TO PROVIDE THE BEARER OF THIS PASSPORT WITH ALL ASSISTANCE THAT MAY BE DEEMED NECESSARY WHILE ABROAD. The Polish statement for which is: ::W≈ÅADZE RZECZYPOSPOLITEJ POLSKIEJ ZWRACAJƒÑ SIƒò Z UPRZEJMƒÑ PRO≈öBƒÑ DO WSZYSTKICH, KT√ìRYCH MO≈ªE TO DOTYCZYƒÜ, O OKAZANIE POSIADACZOWI TEGO PASZPORTU WSZELKIEJ POMOCY, JAKA MO≈ªE OKAZAƒÜ SIƒò NIEZBƒòDNA W CZASIE POBYTU ZA GRANICƒÑ. Biometric data The biometric passports contain an RFID chip containing the passport's printed data in a digital format along with the photograph in a JPEG format along with a digital key to verify that the data contained is authentic and has not been tampered with. The data in the chip can only be accessed after using the printed codes on the lower part of the passport's personal data page. The European Union requires fingerprint data to be stored on the member state's passports at latest in June 2009. Poland already complies with this European act on collecting identity data, and, since 2006, requires passport applicants to provide fingerprint scans and other information relating to facial features when applying for a new passport. Languages The data page/information page is printed in Polish and English, whilst translation of this information into other official languages of the European Union can be found elsewhere in the document. The passport also contains two pages reserved for official notifications which are typically only recorded in Polish. Visa free travel Visa requirements for Polish citizens Visa requirements for Polish citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Poland. Polish citizens enjoy freedom of movement in the European Economic Area and can travel around the EEA as of right. As of July 2019, Polish citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 172 countries and territories, ranking the Polish passport 16th in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley Passport Index.

The current design of the Elgin County Courthouse is largely due to his work in the late 19th century after the building was largely destroyed by fire Neil R. Darrach (1850‚Äì1926) was a noted Canadian architect from St. Thomas, Ontario. He was architect for over five designated heritage properties in St. Thomas, Ontario and Regina, Saskatchewan. He was primarily active in the later 19th century. Early life Neil was born in Southwold Township, Ontario in 1850.James De Jonge (1989), Historic sites and Monuments Board of Canada Agenda Paper, Paper No.1989-11, St. Thomas City Hall. 30pp. He moved to St. Thomas as a youth and became involved in construction at the start of the railway boom in the early 1870s. Darrach received no formal training as an architect, but it was suggested he learnt the trade primarily through trade books and experience.St. Thomas Times Journal, 5 May 1926, p. 9  St. Thomas career Wellington Street Public School, photographed in 1905. Simplicity of form and emphasis on symmetry using a central hall plan characterizes most of Darrach's buildings .James De Jonge (1989), Historic sites and Monuments Board of Canada Agenda Paper,Paper No.1989-11, St. Thomas City Hall. 30pp. Darrach's first building was designed in 1879. This was the Centre Street Baptist Church in St. Thomas, one of many church designs to follow. Neil would also work on the First United Church, the Grand Central Hotel (subsequently destroyed in the later 20th century), St. Thomas Masonic Hall, Myrtle and Balaclava Street Schools; and several prominent homes in the community in addition to the heritage buildings described below. In 1898 disaster struck the Elgin County Courthouse (which was originally designed in 1854 by John Turner) where a significant portion of the building was destroyed by fire. Darrach was retained to re-design the building and did so under the present Palladian style. The building is still in use today and recently received a government grant of over 100 million dollars for renovations. Perhaps one of Neil's more prominent constructions was the design of the St. Thomas City hall in 1898‚Äì99. Darrach's design was chosen out of 10 applications submitted. The building was designed in the late Richardsonian Romanesque style. Subsequently in 1903, Neil was retained to design the City Public Library. This was achieved through Neoclassical Revival style (which now serves as a municipal building extension)adjacent to the city hall. the building was largely paid for by a Carnegie Foundation grant. Other designated heritage properties designed by Darrach include; the late Victorian building the Southern Loan Building which still has 16 functioning vaults, The Princess Avenue Play House (once a church, now a theatre) built in 1907. Despite the catalogue of buildings that are known to be built by Darrach, there is often controversy surrounding the history of some other buildings of historical value in the city which are sometimes argued to be designed by Neil. Over 24 buildings in St. Thomas are known to be designed by Neil.  Regina career Built in 1913, the Westminster Presbyterian, later United, Church in Regina. In the late 19th century in Canada architecture was a trade. Where more experienced architects would train younger architects and so on. Neil Darrach would be Maurice Sharon's mentor, who would later become Saskatchewan‚Äôs first provincial architect. Later, as more colleges and universities instituted architectural programs, architects could obtain more formal training. In 1911 Neil came to Regina, Saskatchewan to work in partnership with Maurice W. Sharon, who later served as Chief Provincial Architect, Saskatchewan, 1917-1930.http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/appendix_a Together they designed the Western Trust Company building, now a heritage building. In a brief career that lasted until 1917 (when he returned to Ontario), Darrach's designs also included the Leader Building, Westminster Presbyterian Church (later United(Pictured)) and the Donahue Block. Legacy After returning from Saskatchewan, Neil worked in St. Thomas again. The last piece of work prior to his death in 1926 was the Memorial Hospital, which was completed in 1923. The building no longer remains today. In summary; Wellington Street Public school, St. Thomas City hall, Old St. Thomas Public Library, Princess Avenue play house (originally a church), The former Southern Loan building are all designated heritage properties in St. Thomas while the Western Trust Company Building in Regina is also designated in Saskatchewan.

In 1898 George Hudson placed this species within the Asaphodes genus. In 1906 George Howes, discussing the species under the name Asaphodes parora, also illustrated it. In 1928 Hudson discussed and illustrated the species again under the name Asaphodes parora. In 1988 J. S. Dugdale placed this species within the genus Austrocidaria. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  Hudson described this species in 1898 as follows: It is regarded as being variable in colour.  Distribution  Austrocidaria parora is endemic to New Zealand. The lectotype specimen was collected at Riccarton Bush in Christchurch.

Former national bases Northern Wisconsin National Canoe Base Northern Wisconsin National Canoe Base circa 1974 Northern Wisconsin National Canoe Base was opened in 1940 on the site of a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp on the south end of the east shore of White Sand Lake in northern Wisconsin. The closest town to that site is Boulder Junction, Wisconsin. The base was originally named MIWI after the initials of the four states in the region. In 1943 it was renamed Region 7 Canoe Base. The base had also been referenced in publications as Region Seven Explorer Canoe Base. Around 1967 it was renamed Northern Wisconsin National Canoe Base, as publications begin referencing the new name during this period. By that time, thousands of Scouts were embarking on wilderness canoe trips from the canoe base every summer, principally from the Chicago area due to its proximity. The primary program was wilderness canoe trips, through the lakes and rivers of northern Wisconsin and the southern edge of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The base provided training, outfitting, and guiding for these trips as well as sleeping and meal facilities for groups of 6-12 crew members, including an adult leader, as they prepared to start or end canoe trips. They also provided transportation to and from starting and ending points. Training included an intensive Voyageur course for the youth leader of a group during the week prior to the group's trip. Additional programs for Scouts included whitewater trips on the lower Flambeau Flowage, swimming at the White Sand Lake beach, informal sandlot football and softball games between staff members and Scouts at the base, and winter camping in the cabins left by the CCC. Canoe trips launched from the base utilized hundreds of different lakes and rivers and about 300 campsites. About half of these sites were on public lands; the others were on private lands under special arrangements, which typically included maintenance work by the Scouts. Examples of closer frequently used waterways include White Sand, Lost Canoe, Pallette, Escanaba, Presque Isle, Crab, Trout, Boulder, and Wild Rice lakes and the Manitowish and Trout Rivers. In the 1960s, staff tried to open up new routes using creeks, with occasionally hilarious results. While the canoe trip area covered millions of acres, most trips were concentrated in the area going about north, east, west, and south of the base. The base celebrated its 40th anniversary in 1980 and enjoyed its most popular years in 1980-81, but usage declined rapidly and the base closed in 1983. Numerous interrelated factors contributed to its demise, including Scout leaders and executives lobbying for closure in favor of other bases, declining usage, increased residential development in the area used for its canoe trips, and a heavy snowfall during the 1982-83 winter that collapsed the roof of the dining hall, which was never rebuilt. Maine National High Adventure Area The Maine National High Adventure Area was established in 1970 due to the efforts of BSA Scout Executive Bud Jeffrey, Seven Island Lands Company President John Sinclair, and Bill Wadsworth and John Donnell of the BSA National Office. The first of three Maine National High Adventure bases was established at the site of the former Foster‚Äôs Matagamon Sporting Camp on the north side of Matagamon Lake, and was called Maine Matagamon National High Adventure Base. This base operated as a single unit in 1971 and 1972. An additional base was established at Pittston Farm on Seboomook Lake in 1973, and a third on Sysladobsis Lake, was operated in 1971 and 1979. Waterfront at Maine Matagamon National High Adventure Base, summer 1971 Matagamon and Seboomook bases were the core of the program for many years. It was a highly successful program that exposed thousands of Scouts to the lakes, rivers, and mountains of the North Maine woods, providing them with a lifetime appreciation of wild lands, no trace camping, and self-sufficiency and safety in the wilderness. Maine National High Adventure was operated as a national base until 1991, when the National BSA Office shut down the program. In 1993, the Matagamon base reopened as Maine High Adventure, an outdoor program run today by the Katahdin Area Council. There is an active staff association called Maine High Adventure Staff Association that is dedicated to the history of the Maine National High Adventure Area, and to the support of the current Maine High Adventure Area. Land Between the Lakes National Outdoor Adventure Center The Land Between the Lakes National Outdoor Adventure Center was a regional high adventure base in Kentucky on the shores of Kentucky Lake near Aurora. It opened in 1973 as a cooperative effort between the BSA and the Tennessee Valley Authority and was based on the former Camp Roy C. Manchester, which had opened in 1954. The base offered sailing trips on the Kentucky Lake. Land Between the Lakes ceased operation as national base in 1983 and the property reverted to Lincoln Heritage Council, which now operates the base at a local level, continuing to offer high adventure related facilities for sailing, canoeing, kayaking and U.S. Coast Guard approved sailing training.

Although the games are not related in terms of story, many aspects of the gameplay are consistent throughout the series. Each game in the series add new elements to the gameplay, such as longer quests, character classes, or different ways of story-telling. One of the major aspects of the Dragon Quest series is that it retains the same setting and general gameplay throughout the series, instead of reinventing itself with each new installment. This has been seen as both a positive and negative aspect by critics of the series. History In Dragon Warrior VII, the party moves across the world map with an overhead view. Dragon Quest was created by Y≈´ji Horii, who became the series' main scenario director. Y≈´ji Horii originally used the full-screen map of Ultima and the first-person menu battle and stats oriented Wizardry screen to create the gameplay of Dragon Quest. Dragon Quest is often cited as the birth of the JRPGs. Each game in the main series builds upon its predecessor, but the gameplay never strays from the series' origins. When asked about the game's resistance to change during an interview, Horii explained that he wants to \\"keep it simple and keep things organized, after twenty years I've found this to be the best way.\\" During the same interview, Horii also stated that he would never want to make an action role-playing game for the series. He said \\"The reason why is because I want to make the game fun and simple and relaxing, so that you can just sit down and take it easy. People who don't like to think very much can just push the button and still get by. The people who like to think and strategize have to option to do that as well.\\" Although Dragon Quest IX was slated to have an action-oriented combat style, it was changed back to menu-based combat in 2007, two years before its release. Common elements In each installment of the Dragon Quest series, players have been able to control a party of up to four characters. The number of party members depends on the game, as well as the number of enemies that can appear in one battle. Dragon Quest featured only one-on-one encounters, whereas Dragon Quest II expanded the party to three characters and the number of enemies was also increased. Dragon Quest III further increased the party size to four characters, which it has stayed at. Players must move their parties through different towns, dungeons, and the world map in order to progress throughout each game. Typically, the party must enter a town or dungeon and defeat a specific enemy or retrieve an item to progress the story. Non-playable characters exist in the game for the party to interact with. NPCs are responsible for giving the player useful information, selling items, saving the player's game, or healing the party, usually at an inn for a fee. Heroes in the series often must defeat a main antagonist to complete the adventure, and there are always several tasks they must do before that, often involving NPCs from different towns. In Dragon Quest, players had to go through a menu in order to use stairs, open treasure chests, and speak to NPCs. The localization of the game also included some gameplay improvements such as being able to see the direction your character is traveling and the ability to save your game through a battery backup instead of passwords. While improvements were made in later versions, the series retained the same basic interface. Dragon Quest features \\"puff puff\\" massage girls the player can opt to get a service from. In earlier games, the background would turn black and text would be displayed; in some later games, gags have been used. These were removed from some North American translations, but not others.The original NES games and the DS remakes have this removed while the PS1 and PS2 games, Dragon Quest IX and GBC remakes include this. Dragon Quest IX Also, in later games monsters and characters can use this as an attack. The effect can cause enemies and characters to lose their turn. Exploration Until Dragon Quest VIII, exploration was all from an overhead view, while battles were in a first-person perspective. Dragon Quest VIII changed this system by featuring fully three dimensional environments and battles in the third-person. Earlier Dragon Quest games were released using solely 2D graphics. Starting with Dragon Quest VII, 3D graphics were introduced, however the graphics were extremely limited compared to those released in Dragon Quest VIII. Since then, every game, including the remakes for the Nintendo DS, has included some level of 3D gameplay. Dragon Quest games often feature different forms of vehicles for the party to explore the world map in. These vehicles allow the party to cross terrain that cannot be walked over. These include ships, which give the party the option of traveling on water. Dragon Quest IV featured a hot air balloon, which enabled the party to travel over mountains. Battle Combat image from Dragon Warrior III depicting typical battle layout and menu types seen in most Dragon Quest games. Dragon Quest VIII retains the menu-based battle system from its predecessors. Each Dragon Quest game in the main series is a role-playing video game and features turn-based battles. During battle, players can issue commands to the party and then the characters and monsters will take turns attacking each other. Certain characters are also able to use magic or skills, and these commands can either damage enemies, recover hit points or remove status ailments, or raise and lower statistics of party members or enemies. Until Dragon Quest IX, battles were randomly occurring in the series. While moving the party through either a dungeon or the world map, there is a chance that an enemy group will attack. In Dragon Quest IX, enemies are visible on the field and players must touch them to enter a battle. Characters earn experience points for each monster the party defeats in battle. As characters earn experience points, they gain levels and their stats increase, making them stronger. These stats include hit points, magic points, strength, agility, and vitality. In certain games, including Dragon Quest VII, characters will also earn different types of points from battles. In Dragon Quest VII, every battle characters are victorious in earns them class points, which allow them to increase their class levels and eventually master that class. Winning battles also grants gold to the party, which can be spent on items at stores, at inns, or at churches in order to heal or revive characters. Dragon Quest IV introduced a \\"Tactics\\" system, where the player can set the AI routines for NPCs, which is seen as a precursor to Final Fantasy XII's \\"Gambits\\" system. Dragon Quest V gave players the opportunity to catch and raise various monsters that appeared in random encounters. These monsters could be added to the player's party and participate in battle, earning experience points just as human party members do. This feature would span its own series of games titled Dragon Quest Monsters and would also influence the series Pok√©mon. Monster catching would appear in Dragon Quest VII briefly by having a monster park minigame in which players could put monsters caught after battles. Character classes Beginning with Dragon Quest III, the series has featured different forms of character customization. Players were given the option to create a party of four characters consisting of the main Hero and three characters made by the player. Classes such as Warrior, Mage, Cleric, or Merchant could be set upon the character and that character's statistics and skills would correlate with the given class. Dragon Quest VI, Dragon Quest VII, and Dragon Quest IX all featured similar class systems, building off of the original system from Dragon Quest III. Abilities Characters in the Dragon Quest games can use a wide variety of abilities, spells, and skills. The original game only featured a few healing and damaging spells, but each game expanded on the list. Dragon Quest VI introduced , a class of non-spell special abilities. Most spells cost magic points, while many skills have no MP cost.  Mini medals  Starting with Dragon Quest IV, a new collectable item known as mini medals were introduced. These mini medals have since been used in every main Dragon Quest title. The medals resemble small gold coins with a five-point star in the middle. The player collects these medals throughout the game by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels and searching sacks and drawers. In Dragon Quest IX, the player can also obtain some by completing quests or from a spawn point on the world map. At a certain point during the games, the player meets a character he can trade these medals for items. From Dragon Quest IV through VII this was a reoccurring character known as the Mini Medal King. While he is replaced in later Dragon Quest titles, he continue to be referenced. In Dragon Quest VIII he makes an appearance, but it is his daughter who collects the medals. In Dragon Quest IX, although the medals are collected by a pirate captain, the dialog references his connection to the Mini Medal Kings. According to Horii, he wanted to have something the player went around collecting as the previous Dragon Quest games had crests and orbs respectively. However, he did not want to do the same thing over again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead have nothing to do with clearing the game. Minigames During gameplay, players may be able to participate in minigames. Mini-medals can be found and traded for exclusive items, a feature that can be traced to Dragon Quest IV and was featured in remakes of earlier games in the series. In addition to mini- medals, the remake of Dragon Quest III allowed players to collect monster medals from their perspective monsters. The remake also featured Pachisi, or Suguroku in Japan, a board game style minigame in which the player could win items. This game was based on Horii's other video game series, Itadaki Street. Several games in the series feature casinos for players to win items by playing various games, including poker and betting on monster battles. The DS remake of Dragon Quest V features several new minigames, including Bruise the Ooze, Treasures 'n' Trapdoors, a version of Pachisi, the Slurpodrome, and the tombola. Reception and legacy The gameplay of Dragon Warrior is seen by critics as revolutionary. In an article for Gamasutra, Kurt Kalata pointed out that the game \\"was also one of the most in-depth games seen on the Famicom at the time. Back in 1986, if you wanted a complicated game, you needed an expensive PC.\\" A large aspect of the Dragon Quest games is the continuity of the series' gameplay. When comparing the four NES games, Kyle Knight of Allgame pointed out that the games made little innovation in terms of gameplay and graphics, but that each installment was longer and had more depth to it than the one before it. In Dragon Warrior IV, he argued, \\"you still have to work around the Dragon Warrior menu system. To open doors, talk to characters, or perform any other action, you have to go to the hotspot for that appropriate action, go to the menu, then click on the appropriate verb.\\" Chris Kohler of Wired noted that the remake of Dragon Quest IV felt \\"like a retro game\\" and that \\"it'll seem very nostalgic and fun to anyone who has fond memories of poking through Dragon Quest IV on their Famicom\\". Mark Bozon complained of \\"simple and archaic menus\\" in his IGN review of Dragon Quest V. IGN described Dragon Warrior VII's class system as \\"one of the best class systems seen outside a strategy RPG.\\" In a preview for Dragon Quest IX on 1UP, Jeremey Parish noted that the character customization was a welcome departure from the series of games with only predetermined characters and wrote that \\"You can define your angel warrior's basic appearance to a degree, but he or she will look like an escapee from a Dragon Ball cartoon no matter what.\\" Legacy Dragon Warrior was listed on GameSpot's list of the 15 most influential games of all time, calling it the \\"most influential role-playing game of all time\\" and stated that nearly all Japanese RPGs today have roots in its gameplay. GameSpot also noted that the game's 2D graphics were imitated by most Japanese RPGs until video games began using 3D graphics. In another Gamasutra article, Kalata claimed that Dragon Quest was the first of its genre and that it \\"went on to inspire dozens of clones. Most of these are best left forgotten, but it did inspire two more notable franchises: Square's Final Fantasy and Sega's Phantasy Star\\". He also noted that when first localized for North America, it was not immediately popular due to \\"subpar\\" graphics and \\"stodgy interface\\".

The primary objective of this organization is to promote the welfare of Call and Volunteer Fire/EMS Companies and their members by rendering assistance of every type and nature whenever possible. On February 26, 1990 a group of 40 Call/Volunteer Firefighters representing 14 Southeastern Massachusetts fire departments met in Carver to discuss the concept of starting a Statewide Call/Volunteer Firefighters' Association. This meeting was organized by the Carver Firefighters Association and Carver Fire Chief, Dana E. Harriman. The meeting produced some lively and colorful discussions, but one base theme kept coming to the forefront: the Call/Volunteers in the state were headed in the wrong direction. In late 1987 Call/Volunteer Firefighters were excluded from previously enjoyed death and disability benefits under the state retirement law. In 1989 Call/Volunteers were categorically excluded from being members of the district Haz-Mat teams in conjunction with the State funded Haz-Mat vehicles. It became apparent from this meeting that the Call/Volunteers lacked organization and adequate representation in matters concerning them on the state level. It was unanimously voted to set up a Steering Committee to report back to the group with recommendations. On April 23, 1990, the Steering Committee Report was presented and unanimously accepted with a couple of minor modifications. On April 30, 1990, this group met again and decided to do a mailing to survey the cities and towns across the state in an effort to solicit representation that would make this a true Massachusetts Call/Volunteer Firefighters' Association. The group met many times that spring and summer, and the surveys came rolling in. After much preparation our first State Meeting was held in West Boylston on October 14, 1990. This meeting formalized a working set of bylaws and a basic Constitution for this organization. From the original 14 departments, we have grown to over 3400 members representing more than 130 fire departments and emergency services organizations.

Biography  Schaeffler was born in Kaufbeuren Bavaria, on 13 December 1915. Working in the mountains as a shepherd, he was a competitive skier by the age of 8. In 1932, at age 17, he was the winner of Bavarian Alpine Championships. Schaeffler was named to the 1936 German Olympic team, but broke both legs before the IV Winter Games in Garmisch- Partenkirchen, and was unable to compete.Jump When World War II broke out in 1939, Schaeffler was drafted into the German Army as a \\"political unsafe,\\" because of a family history of opposition politics, and eventually ended up in the German army on the Russian Front. Captured and tortured by the Soviets, he escaped and returned to Austria, where after recovering from grave injuries, he joined the anti-Nazi resistance, known as the Austrian Underground, with forces working in the Austrian Alps in the area around St. Moritz Following WWII, Schaeffler started training the United States Army Europe in rock climbing and alpine skiing, and in this role taught George Patton and other high-ranking U.S. military personnel how to ski and rock climb.Fund This, and his romance with American Betty Durnford, his future wife of 14 years, was his ticket to U.S. emigration, and he moved with Betty under her sponsorship to the U.S., in the spring of 1948. In June 1948, Schaeffler wrote to Larry Jump, who was setting up the Arapahoe Basin ski resort in Colorado, looking for work as a ski instructor.The Hall of Fame claims this took place in 1946, but the Denver Library has the original letter from Schaeffler to Jump in its collection; it is dated 6 July 1948. Jump hired Willy Schaeffler, who moved with his new wife to Colorado that year and introduced the alpine skiing technique known as \\"short-swing\\". This \\"short-swing\\" remained the standard beginner training technique across North America for decades. Nearly a decade later, the national sports magazine, Sports Illustrated, would feature Schaeffler and parts of this new technique in a two-issue 1957 cover story, titled \\"Revolution In Skiing.\\" The article featured remarkable pencil drawings by renowned artist and content innovator, Robert Riger. In the early 1950s, Schaeffler was hired for his second job as the coach for the Denver Pioneers ski team, at the University of Denver. He was the coach of the ski team from 1948‚Äì1970 and was also the coach of the D.U. men's soccer team from 1962‚Äì1969. Under his tutelage, in 22 years, his D.U. Pioneers won 13 of 18 National Championships (NCAA). In general competition, the team placed in the top three 122 times out of 123 meets, with 100 of those being first-place. This record of wins and places stands unchallenged in the world to this day. Thirty-three of his racers were named to the NCAA All-American teams, and 15 named to the Olympic Ski Teams and FIS championships.Fame Otto Tshudi, Marv Crawford, Keith Wegeman, and Chuck Ferries are among his premier student skiers. In 1957, Schaeffler became the Director of Ski Events at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California. He was responsible for designing the alpine courses. It was here that be began is lifelong friendships and associations with both John F. Kennedy and Walter Elias Disney. In the early 1970s, was part of the group that submitted the winning bid for the 1976 Winter Olympics for Denver, however, this bid was later withdrawn by the voters of Colorado, and the games returned to Innsbruck in 1976 for a second time. Schaeffler's work on the design of the runs at Squaw Valley had placed him in high demand around the world and across North America as a ski area and ski run designer, and over the next two and a half decades, he consulted with dozens of ski resorts. One of these was the original plan for what is today the Whistler Blackcomb resort, site of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. His design for the downhill course, later named for Dave Murray, was used 50 years later as the main alpine course for those twenty-first century games. In 1970, Schaeffler was named as Director of the U.S. Alpine Ski Team; Schaeffler held this position until 1973. During this period, he served as head coach for the U.S. team at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan, where the team won gold and bronze medals. Not surprisingly, Schaeffler was often referred to as \\"America's Most Successful Ski Coach\\". Schaeffler was largely responsible for moving the U.S. National Ski Team to its permanent headquarters in Park City, Utah, in 1974 and established the first national ski training center here. He laid out large parts of the area, including several runs on Ski Team Ridge, known as the U.S. Ski Team training runs.Plaque Today, a ski run is named in his honor at Park City, called \\"Willy's Run.\\" Another run in Beaver Creek, Colorado, called \\"Willy's Face,\\" is also dedicated to the memory of Schaeffler. A third, in the ski area Willy Schaeffler helped found, Arapahoe Basin, in Colorado, also bears his name, titled \\"Pioneer Willy.\\" Especially in his work as a technical delegate for the International Ski Federation (FIS), Schaeffler was passionate about ski and ski racing safety. During the 1970s, Schaeffler worked with Walt Disney, in an effort to open new ski resorts. The first project, in Mineral King, expanded greatly during design and was eventually planned to host more than a million visitors a year. The Sierra Club objected and a lengthy series of court cases followed, until the Disney organization finally gave up on the idea, citing costs and delays, following the death of Walt Disney in late 1966. A second attempt followed at Independence Lake near Mt. Lola in Northern California, just north and not far from Lake Tahoe. A similar series of environmental lawsuits followed, and these plans were also abandoned, along with much of Disney's interest in the ski market. Schaeffler developed a special intensive training program for his skiers, plus he planned and proposed a sports medicine program, and a traveling medical team for his athletes. Schaeffler was also one of the founders of Professional Ski Instructors of America (PSIA), separating instructor training within the USSA into an independent organization. In 1968, Schaeffler received USSA‚Äôs highest award for outstanding service to the sport of skiing, named the Julius Blegen Award. In 1969, Schaeffler received the USSA Rocky Mountain Division‚Äôs highest award, the Halstead Trophy, for outstanding service. In 1972, was inducted into Colorado Sports Hall of Fame. In 1974, he was inducted into National Ski Hall of Fame. In 1977, Schaeffler assisted in the formation of the Special Olympics, focused on disabled skiers, along with the Arapahoe Basin's Larry and Marnie Jump, and the Kennedy families. Schaeffler died on April 9, 1988, in Denver, Colorado, after having had five open heart surgical procedures and a pacemaker implanted during the prior 17 years. Established by Schaeffler's son, Jimmy Schaeffler, a permanent set of scholarships at the University of Denver today pays further tribute to Schaeffler. One is a foreign exchange scholarship for disabled student-athletes, with a preference for competitive skiers; the other is a foreign exchange scholarship for able-bodied student athletes, also with a preference for competitive skiers; a third is the Willy Schaeffler Norwegian Scholarship Fund. Currently, an additional Willy Schaeffler endowment fund is in its early stages, a ski coach's fund supporting the head alpine coach at the University of Denver. References Notes In 1986, the Willy Schaeffler Scholarship Fund was created at D.U. by Willy's son, Jimmy Schaeffler. The fund provides full scholarships for disabled and able-bodied ski athletes.

The racetrack was situated on a parcel located in Yaphank northwest of the William Floyd Parkway interchange on the Long Island Expressway. The racetrack first opened in 1977 as Parr Meadows and closed following a 113-day meet after the bank defaulted on loans. Although the track was not built by developer Ron Parr, the Parr Organization assumed ownership after the original builder ran out of funds. In May 1986, horse racing briefly returned to Suffolk Meadows for an 86-day stint. The racetrack ceased operations on October 18, 1986. On September 7, 1979, 18,000 attendees gathered at Parr Meadows for a ten-hour concert featuring a number of the original performers from the Woodstock Festival. Musical artists attending the tenth year reunion concert included Blondie Chaplin, Canned Heat, Country Joe McDonald, John Sebastian, Leslie West, Jorma Kaukonen, Johnny Winter, Paul Butterfield, Rick Danko and Stephen Stills. Many of the concertgoers arrived the day before, parking along William Floyd Parkway and camping out in the woods. Suffolk Meadows has also been the site of competitions for the International Professional Rodeo Association and the Suffolk County Fair. The former racetrack site has also been discussed as a potential location of a casino for the Shinnecock Indian Nation. In 1997, developer Wilbur Breslin planned to develop the adjacent property into a regional shopping mall called Brookhaven Town Center.

A quick, talented, energetic, and dynamic offensive left-back, with a powerful shot and good technique, he excelled at providing long passes and crosses to forwards and at making attacking runs down the flank. Despite his offensive and creative prowess, he was inconsistent at times, however, and was less effective defensively, as he often struggled in one on one situations with forwards. A predominantly left- footed player, he was also an accurate free-kick taker. Although he was often a reserve player at Milan and Juventus, Orlando is one of the six players to win the Serie A title in two successive years with different clubs, winning the 1993‚Äì94 Serie A title with Milan, and the 1994‚Äì95 Serie A title with Juventus; the other five are Giovanni Ferrari, Riccardo Toros, Eraldo Mancin, Roberto Baggio, and Andrea Pirlo. Club career Early career After beginning his career in the Udinese Youth side, Orlando made 3 appearances in the Udinese senior side during the 1987‚Äì88 and the 1988‚Äì89 Serie B seasons. He was subsequently loaned to Parma, making 13 appearances and scoring a goal, also managing Serie A promotion during the 1989‚Äì90 season. At the end of his loan contract, he returned to Udinese making 30 appearances in Serie B. He began to draw attention from larger Serie A clubs, and during the summer of 1991, he was purchased by Sampdoria. He made his Serie A debut with the club on 1 September 1991, in a 3‚Äì2 away defeat to Cagliari, although he was unable to break into the starting line-up, making 14 appearances in Serie A, and scoring 1 goal in a home victory over Parma on 1 March 1992, winning the 1991 Supercoppa Italiana with the club. He also made 5 appearances in the UEFA Champions League, as Sampdoria went on to reach the final, only to be defeated by Cruyff's Barcelona \\"Dream Team\\". The next season, he returned to his former club, Udinese, who had just achieved promotion to Serie A, making 29 appearances throughout the season. Success with Milan, Juventus and Fiorentina In 1993, Orlando was purchased by Italian and European giants A.C. Milan for 3.2 billion Lit. With the club, he made 15 appearances in Serie A under manager Fabio Capello, and 6 in the UEFA Champions League, as Milan went on to win both competitions, as well as the Supercoppa Italiana; he notably managed a goal in the Champions League, scoring in Milan's 6‚Äì0 away victory over FC Copenhagen. Orlando also made 4 appearances in the Coppa Italia that season for Milan, making 25 appearances in total in all competitions. He began the following season with Milan, but was sold to Juventus at the end of the transfer window in exchange for creative forward and attacking midfielder Paolo Di Canio. Orlando made 13 appearances for the Turin club in Serie A that season, serving as a back-up to Robert Jarni, as he managed to win his second consecutive Serie A title. He also managed to capture the Coppa Italia with Juventus that season, making 5 appearances; Juventus also went on to reach the 1995 UEFA Cup Final, only to be defeated by Parma. Despite his success, his inability to break into the starting line-up yet again led to his transfer to Fiorentina, where he apperead even less frequently than in previous seasons. He made only 7 appearances in Serie A with the Florentine club that season, and 1 more in the Coppa Italia, a trophy which Fiorentina would go on to win. Return to Udinese and later career Orlando returned to Udinese for the 1996‚Äì97 season, where he made 22 appearances, helping the club to a fifth-place finish in Serie A. He was sold to newly promoted club Treviso in Serie B the following season, after making two appearances with Udinese. He spent two seasons with Treviso in Serie B, scoring 5 goals in 50 appearances. In the summer of 2000, he moved to Cagliari, where he only made 8 appearances throughout his only season at the club, later moving to Padova in Serie C1. He played two seasons with the club, making 42 appearances, without scoring a goal. He subsequently moved to Pordenone and later Cologna Veneta. In 2004, he was signed by Serie D club Tamai, where he spent three seasons, before spending the final season of his career with Manzanese, where he retired after the 2007‚Äì08 season. In total he made 102 career appearances In Serie A, scoring 1 goal, and 104 appearances in Serie B, scoring 5 goals. International career Although Orlando never appeared for the Italy senior side, he made one appearance with the Italy under-21 side on 29 January 1992, in an away fixture against Greece. He represented Italy at the 1992 Summer Olympics, although he never made appearance throughout the tournament, only playing in the pre-olympic friendly against Egypt. Coaching career In 2008, Orlando was hired as a player- manager for A.S.D. Flumiganio, a lower-division team in the Promozione League in Friuli-Venezia Giulia. In June 2013, after his fifth season, he left the club. Starting from the 2013‚Äì14 season, he was named player-manager of the Friulian Promozione side A.S.D. Svegliano.

History  Neal Sugarman grew up in Newton, Massachusetts and played saxophone for punk rock bands Boys Life and Black Cat Bone during the 1980s. He moved to New York in the early 1990s to pursue jazz. After a stint in New Orleans playing with musicians including Eddie Henderson and Mike Longo, Sugarman returned to New York and formed a funk band with organist Adam Scone and drummer Rudy Albin. The trio, named The Sugarman 3, were influenced by artists such as \\"Brother\\" Jack McDuff and The Meters. The band was among the musicians who established Desco Records, a label that released reissues of 1960s and 1970s funk and jazz records in addition to material by current acts. The Sugarman 3's debut album, Sugar's Boogaloo, was released in 1998. Soul Donkey followed in 2000, and included cover versions of songs by James Brown and Lou Donaldson along with original songs by the band. A compilation album, 2001's Sweet Spot, contained selections from the trio's first two albums. In 2002, the band released their third album, Pure Cane Sugar. It featured guest appearances by funk percussionist Bernard Purdie and vocalists Lee Fields and Charles Bradley. Tom Moon of Rolling Stone described the album as \\"organic, locked-tight music.\\" Maurice Bottomley of PopMatters said, \\"Play this at your next party and watch your coolest friends unwind and start to Boogaloo. This is the real thing, undiluted and impossible to dislike.\\" Dusted Magazine's Andy Urban said the album \\"sounds good, but it operates in a vacuum of sorts, music that is pretty, but fundamentally anachronistic and relevant in aesthetic terms only.\\" Sugarman, who also formed The Dap-Kings with Gabriel Roth, was a session musician during much of the late 2000s, playing on albums by Lily Allen, Amy Winehouse, Robbie Williams, Al Green, Nas, Mark Ronson, as well as the Dap-Kings' own recordings led by vocalist Sharon Jones. \\"You Don't Know What You Mean (To A Lover Like Me)\\", a 2004 single by Lee Fields and the Sugarman 3, appeared on the soundtrack to the 2008 comedy-drama film Soul Men.

Allied with Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, and the Sz√©kelys, Bekes organized two rebellions against B√°thory, but was defeated. After B√°thory became King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1576, Bekes reconciled with B√°thory, becoming his close adviser. Bekes also fought in the Danzig rebellion and the Livonian War. Rivalry with B√°thory Coat of arms of Bekes Bekes was treasurer for John II Sigismund Z√°polya, King of Hungary (died 1571), and gained considerable power and favor with him. In his testament, Z√°polya, who had no legal heir, designated Bekes as Voivode of Transylvania. However, the Hungarian nobles did not honor the will and elected Stephen B√°thory as their voivode while Bekes was away on a diplomatic mission in the court of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Supported by Maximilian, who opposed B√°thory for the throne of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, Bekes gathered his army and organized a rebellion against B√°thory, but was defeated. Bekes lost all of his possessions and was forced to seek asylum with Maximilian in Vienna. When Poland‚ÄìLithuania elected Henry of Valois as its monarch, Maximilian and B√°thory ceased hostilities. Bekes unsuccessfully traveled to the Ottoman Empire seeking allies. His hopes were revived again when in 1574 Henry of Valois abdicated the Polish throne for that of France and the Maximilian‚ÄìB√°thory rivalry resumed. Bekes, supported by Sz√©kelys, started another rebellion, but his forces were defeated in the Battle of Kerel≈ëszentp√°l in 1575. Supporters of Bekes were brutally suppressed and privileges for the Sz√©kelys were suspended. Service to B√°thory and death Remains of Bekes Hill (on the right) before it was washed away entirely In 1576, B√°thory was elected and crowned a King of Poland and later became a Grand Duke of Lithuania (the nobility in Lithuania were at first reluctant to Bathory and preferred Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor),\\"Stefan Batory\\", Jerzy Besala, Pa≈Ñstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy (State Publishing Institute), Warszawa 1992, , p. 138-148. thus becoming the ruler of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Maximilian died in 1576, and Bekes lost any hopes of reclaiming Transylvania. Bekes decided to reconcile with B√°thory and became his loyal ally and close adviser despite differences in their religions. During the Danzig rebellion, Bekes commanded Hungarian troops, sent to assist B√°thory in establishing his control over the Commonwealth, and gained special recognition for his defense of ElblƒÖg (Ebling). During the Livonian War against Ivan IV of Russia, Bekes joined the expedition to reconquer Polatsk (1579). For his service B√°thory assigned him Lanckorona and other lands. On his way to Hrodna Bekes caught cold, fell ill, and died later in Hrodna. His body was transported to Vilnius for burial, but none of the city's Christian cemeteries agreed to accept him because of his Unitarian faith. Therefore he was buried on a hill, which later became known as the Bekes Hill. His grave was marked by an octagonal tower, in height and in diameter. The hill and his grave were washed away by the Vilnia River in the mid-1800s. The territory is now within the Kalnai Park.

Itsekiri is spoken by nearly 900,000 people in Nigeria as a first language and by many others as an additional language notably in the Niger Delta and in parts of Edo and Ondo states of Nigeria. The other key members of the Yoruboid group are Yoruba (22 million) and Igala (1.8 million) along with the various Yoruba dialects spoken in Benin and Togo. Classification Itsekiri is most closely related to the Yoruba dialects of south western Nigeria with which it shares close similarity in grammar, lexicon and syntax. Itsekiri represents one end of a continuum of Yoruba dialects from the northern Yoruba lands of Oyo and Offa to the western reaches of the Niger- Delta. In many ways standard Yoruba and Itsekiri may be considered official variants of the same language. Although Itsekiri and the South Eastern Yoruba dialects are mutually intelligible to varying degrees depending on proximity to each other, however, unlike Yoruba dialect speakers, native Itsekiri speakers do not recognise or use the standard Yoruba language as their official lingua franca. This may be owing to the historical isolation of the main body of Itsekiri speakers (in the Niger Delta) from the continuum of Yoruba speakers and centuries of developing a separate and distinct Itsekiri socio-cultural and national identity. Nevertheless, from a linguistic standpoint, both Itsekiri and standard Yoruba (based on the Oyo dialect) can be considered to represent two official variants of what is essentially the same language - one is a Southern Yoruba dialectal fusion of Ijebu, Ondo, Owo - spoken as a national language by under a million people and the other a fusion of Oyo and Eko dialects now spoken as a standard language by over 20 million people. Itsekiri is most closely related to Yoruba and Igala and incorporates elements of both languages. It has also been very heavily influenced by Edo (Bini), Portuguese and English and has taken in loan words from neighbouring Ijo and Urhobo languages. However its basic structure, grammar and vocabulary is essentially Yoruboid with its closest relatives being the south-eastern family of Yoruba dialects - Ijebu, Ilaje-Ikale, Ondo, Akure and Owo. Whilst closely resembling those dialects however the Itsekiri language also features elements of Northern Yoruba notably The Ife and Oyo dialects. It is generally believed that the Itsekiri Language has developed out of an amalgam of languages spoken by various groups present in the western Niger-delta at the time of the formation of the Itsekiri nation in the 15th century. Because it has developed in the relative isolation of the Niger-Delta away from the main body of Yoruba dialects and from Igala - Itsekiri like most languages (that develop away from the main family body e.g. Icelandic) has preserved many of the original/archaic features of the original proto-Yoruba- Igala language and in particular the old Ijebu dialect of Yoruba. It is also possible that Itsekiri represents a surviving remnant of what could once have been the original Yoruba-Igala language before the split into separate languages. Itsekiri is important to philologists and linguists today because of its role in comparative linguistics and in particular the study of the development of the Yoruba language. The Yoruba, English and Pidgin-English languages remain key modern-day influences on the development of the Itsekiri language today.

The current site opened in 1981 and the old site is now used by the Singapore Armed Forces. with stopovers at Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong, and Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang, Malaysia. Ten crew and 69 passengers were on board. It was the second-deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Malaysia at the time.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved was a Douglas DC-8-62H (serial number 46152 and factory 550), released in 1971, and delivered to Japan Airlines on 23 August. It was registered as JA8051. The aircraft was powered by four Pratt & Whitney JT3D-3B turbofan engines.  Accident  Two hours into the flight, air traffic control at Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport told flight 715 to start its approach and land on runway 15. The flight crew started their approach, putting the landing gear down and extending the flaps. The aircraft descended below minimum descent altitude of 750 ft, then at 300 ft, it crashed into the side of a hill 4 miles from the airport, near an estate called Ladang Elmina. The aircraft broke on impact, with no fire. The accident killed 34 people: eight of the 10 crew and 26 of the 69 passengers. Forty-five survivors, among the passengers and crew, were taken to a hospital. The remains from the crash could be found in the soil surrounding the estate until 2011. Most of the land now is being converted to developments. A memorial was built in the Japanese cemetery in Malaysia. The crash was the second-deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Malaysia until the crash of Malaysian Airline System Flight 653, two months later, with 100 fatalities.  Investigation  The Malaysian Civil Aviation Bureau investigated the accident. At the time of the crash, the weather around the airport was poor and the aircraft was on a VOR approach. The investigation determined that the cause of the accident was the captain descending below the minimum descent altitude without having the runway in sight, and continuing the descent, causing the aircraft to crash before reaching the airport. The flight crew loss of sight of the airport due to bad weather, which also contributed to the accident. In addition, the first officer did not challenge the captain for violating the regulations.

He was born in Grandas de Salime, Asturias. He worked as blacksmith in the forge of his father and in other activities related to metallurgy. Together with two friends he discovered the first dwelling of the Castro (village), called Chao Samart√≠n, in 1977.'' Jos√© Mar√≠a Naveiras Escanlar's role in the discovery of the Castro of Chao Samart√≠n. (Spanish). Because of the friendship he had with the owner of the estate, Don Manuel Barcia Monteser√≠n, he was allowed to excavate this buried building, a work he accomplished together with Jos√© Manuel Villamea, and together they managed to bring to light an important collection of ceramic fragments. He took the archaeologist D. Miguel √Ångel de Blas Cortina of the University of Oviedo to see the Castro, who subsequently studied the excavation site. Works and accomplishments *In the year 1983, Jos√© Naveiras Escanlar founded the Ethnographic Museum of Grandas de Salime. He investigated anthropological subjects to develop the museum project in the best possible way. *In October 1984, at the antique ruins of Melgar de Tera that were turned into an improvised mausoleum, he excavated a glass made of fine materials, dated to the first half of the first Century, 10‚Äì20 B.C. *In April 1986, on his own initiative he presented some samples coming from Chao Samart√≠n to Mr. Fern√°n Alonso, Q.E.D. of the Carbon-14 Department of the Institute for Physics and Chemistry of Rocasolano (The High Council for Scientific Investigations) in Madrid. They did an analysis and dated the castro at the second half of the first century A.D. This has been the first proof. *When the official excavations at Chao Samart√≠n began, under the direction of Dn. El√≠as Carrocera and later √Ångel Villa Vald√©s, he modestly cooperated with the team of archaeologists in everything they asked of him. *After the discovery and in relation to the said above, which is highly important, he published work in the media of communication that are related to these findings, that for obvious reasons as set out here, have no scientific basis; but what they did was give insight into the facts and a widespread knowledge of the actual state of affairs at the excavations of the Castro of Chao Samart√≠n.

IAD UK Ltd was founded in 1976 by John and Yvonne Shute. Initially work came in the form of design services for Rail cars which then led to Automotive Body and Chassis Engineering but due to the increasing customers requirements it soon expanded to encompass everything from Design/ Styling and Engineering through to small-scale production. IAD UK Ltd had at its peak a large R&D; facility in Worthing, West Sussex, UK plus 5 overseas operations in the USA (California and Detroit), France (5 facilities), Spain and Germany (3 facilities) along with liaison offices in Korea, Japan and Russia. The US, German and Spanish offices having their own Styling studios. It was the world's largest R&D; consultancy not only working in Automotive, Commercial Vehicles and Aerospace. The British company was in competition with Italdesign, Pininfarina, Bertone. By the early 1990s the company employed over 1400 professionals. The majority of the projects completed by IAD was never made public keeping the high level of security that John Shute believed was the key to customers allowing IAD to be considered for future projects. The company was awarded the Queen's Award for Export and Industry many times and ultimately John was appointed an OBE (Order of the British Empire) by Queen Elizabeth II for his endeavors on behalf of the British Motor industry.IAD Worthing Herald Article IAD designed and developed many cutting edge and memorable concept cars developed as showcases demonstrating the company's creative and engineering expertise including the IAD Alien, IAD Hunter, IAD Interstate, IAD Arrival, IAD Royale, IAD Mini MPV, IAD Venus and finally the IAD Magia. IAD amassed a talented group of designers, engineers and prototype builders who have subsequently gone on to senior positions within the automotive industry. They specialized in car prototyping and engineering design. Mayflower Corp. purchased IAD after it went into receivership in the early 1990s with the Engineering, Design groups and facilities were sold to Daewoo Motors 1993. The Mazda MX5 (Miata) was one of the many projects IAD was involved in, developing not only Exterior and Interior style for the vehicle in the UK/ US (California) but also building prototypes locally prior to volume production in 1989. Mazda came to IAD to replicate the \\"true\\" British sports car invoking the MG's success of handling, and even directed the Chassis team to copy the exhaust note of early MGBs. Personnel The founder John Shute was a great entrepreneur who was a tough but shrewd businessman. He saw possibilities for expansion in the Automotive R&D; consultancy business and grabbed it. He had a knack along with his sales team of getting projects out of a manufacturer which would often led to bigger projects later on. Overall John, who died from cancer in the 1990s was an enigmatic character who suffered fools badly but rewarded people who tried.

His playing style was influenced by Blind Blake, Buddy Moss, Blind Boy Fuller, Josh White, Willie Walker, and to some extent Lightnin' Hopkins. Biography Tate was born in Elberton, Georgia, and was raised in Greenville, South Carolina. As an adolescent, he started performing locally, after seeing Blind Blake in Elberton. Tate later formed a trio with Joe Walker (the brother of Willie Walker) and Roosevelt \\"Baby\\" Brooks and, up to 1932, played locally. As the Carolina Blackbirds, they performed on radio station WFBC, broadcasting from the Jack Tar Hotel. For the rest of the 1930s he worked other jobs, mainly as a mason. Tate served in the U.S. Army infantry during World War II in the south of England. He returned to the Spartanburg-Greenville club circuit in 1946. He claimed to have recorded several unreleased tracks for Kapp Records in 1950. Relocating to Spartanburg, South Carolina, he performed solo before forming an occasional duo with Pink Anderson, a working relationship that endured until the 1970s, when Anderson was disabled by a stroke. Tate released his only album, Blues of Baby Tate: See What You Done Done, in 1962, and twelve months later appeared in Samuel Charters's documentary film The Blues. Throughout the 1960s he performed irregularly across the United States. With the harmonica player Peg Leg Sam or the guitarists Baby Brooks or McKinley Ellis, he recorded nearly sixty tracks in 1970 and 1971 for Peter B. Lowry, but the proposed album remained unreleased after Tate died unexpectedly in the summer of 1972. He appeared at a concert at the State University of New York at New Paltz, as a result of Lowry's efforts, in the spring of 1972. Tate died of effects of a heart attack, in the Veterans Administration Hospital in Columbia, South Carolina, in August 1972, at the age of 56. In January 2011, Tate was nominated for the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards in the category Blues Song, for \\"See What You Done Done\\". His recording of the song is included on the compilation album Classic Appalachian Blues, released by Smithsonian Folkways in 2010.

Through its network Ambition works with more than 3,500 voluntary youth clubs, youth groups and projects across the United Kingdom, supporting over 350,000 young people. Ambition works directly with its member organisations to help facilitate the delivery of quality of youth services and also influences national and local government to support youth clubs. The current Chief Executive is Helen Marshall.  Purpose and charitable objective  Ambition is the leading voluntary youth organisation in the UK, promoting the importance of quality youth clubs and inspiring and encouraging young people to achieve. Ambition helps young people through: * Providing training and development to the 30,000 staff that run their member youth clubs * Deliver  History  Ambition was founded on 24 October 1925 as the National Association of Boys' Clubs (NABC) in order to consolidate the Boys' and Lads' Club movement which had been growing steadily since the latter quarter of the 19th century.\\"History of the Boys' Club Movement' from The Boy ‚Äì A Magazine Devoted to the Welfare of Boys, Vol. XII. No. 3, London, 1939. At the time the vast majority of boys left formal education at the age of 14 and began life in employment. To many boys the street was the only place available to socialise once they had finished work, which became seen as a social problem. The boys' club movement therefore aimed to provide these working class boys with a place to socialise and have access to positive activities in their leisure time.Principles and Aims of the Boys' Club Movement, London, 1930. Once founded the NABC grew rapidly, within a year five local federations were affiliated bringing 262 Boys' clubs with them while an additional thirty-three clubs were affiliated directly with the NABC. By 1928 fifteen local federations with 715 clubs had affiliated with 71 further clubs joining directly and by 1930 17 federations were affiliated and 944 clubs, 107 of which were directly. More than half of the federations which were affiliated by 1930 had not previously existed, showing the growing realisation that it was beneficial for Boys' clubs to form links and possess a central administrative body.Eagar, W.McG, Making Men ‚Äì The History of Boys' Clubs and Related Movements in Great Britain, London, 1953. At the 1930 NABC conference the Principles and Aims of the Boys Club Movement was accepted by the organisation as the official doctrine of the Boys' Club movement and popularly became known as \\"the NABC Bible\\". The document was significant as it set out the purpose, programme, policy and philosophy of the National Association, the movement now possessed a distinct national objective.Eagar, Making Men. Despite numerous obstacles the National Association of Boys' Club continued strongly through the Second World War and contributed towards the war effort. The undoubted difficulties faced by boys' Clubs during the war meant that many had to alter the practices and the activities which they provided. Many took the opportunity to help the war effort with new activities such as cultivating fallow ground, providing canteens for local soldiers, digging shelters and helping evacuated school children. Many youth clubs opened their premises as makeshift schools during the day. Boys Clubs' also helped children evacuated from the cities during the war to settle into their new homes and make friends, playing a vital role in moBoys' Clubs Annual Report 1945-7, London, 1947. In 1992, NABC officially changed its name to NABC-Clubs for Young People, to reflect that its clubs were no longer just for boys. In 1999, this changed again to the National Association of Clubs for Young People and in 2005 to Clubs for Young People. In 2012, the charity's new name became Ambition, which it said reflected its \\"drive to make the UK's youth clubs as successful as possible\\".  Network structure  Ambition's network consists of community-based member clubs who work with young people directly, city and county organisations that provide locally tailored support to youth clubs and projects on a daily basis. Its national office, as well as providing national representation, advocacy and resources, offers specialist capacity-building through regional teams. Its regional teams are split into two geographical areas, north and south. Working within Ambition's network are an estimated 30,000 volunteers, within 3,500 youth clubs that help over 350,000 young people.  Areas of work  Healthy Lifestyles Focuses on the role youth clubs can play in the promotion of good physical, mental and environmental health. The sports programme, which tries to foster greater participation of girls, covers a range of sports including table tennis, football and boxing. Since the late 1940s, Ambition has coordinated an annual 5-a-side football tournament involving its member clubs. The tournament was previously sponsored by Gillette in one of the longest running charity and corporate partnerships. The charity also runs and annual boxing championship. Ambition‚Äôs Somewhere to Talk ‚Äì Someone to Listen project, led by Young Devon aimed to enhance the supported youth clubs provide to the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people who access their services. Ambition had supported over 400 young people to get involved with environmental project and better understand the environment. Creative Arts The creative arts programme Increases the opportunities for young people to access the arts through mediums which include music and photography. In 2011, Ambition ran the Bigger Picture photography competition. Young budding photographers entered with pictures showing life at their book club or what life might look like without youth clubs. The competition was judged by photographers Rankin and Paul Sanders, and then picture editor at The Times, Rory Linsdsay. It was run in partnership with UK Youth and supported by Nokia. Enterprise The Enterprising Ambition programme helps young people built up their skills to kind work and set up a business. Funded through the RBS Inspiring Enterprise Initiative, the programme was piloted from January 2012 before being rolled out nationally. The programme is supported by Young Apprentice finalist Lizzie Magee. Ambition supports the annual PhoneBrain competition, run by Ambition partner PhonepayPlus. Leadership and Training Ambition‚Äôs Leadership programme provides training for aspiring and experienced young leaders. They support and deliver courses that help young people gain leadership qualifications. Ambition is part of a consortium, led by Catch22, helping to run the National Citizen Service (NCS). As part of the consortium, Ambition has helped over 1,500 young people complete their NCS. In October 2012, Ambition began pioneering the Lions Quest Skills for Adolescence scheme in the UK. Ambition Quality Ambition developed a standard to judge the quality of youth service. Based on the experiences if Ambition, London Youth and Youth options, it is a nationally tried and tested award. Ambition Quality is aimed specifically at youth clubs, projects and sports clubs who can achieve a Bronze, Silver or Gold Award. Designed specifically for youth infrastructure organisations, Ambition Quality + has two standards; excellence practise for membership organisations and excellence practise in supporting other youth organisations.  Notable associated people  There have been a vast number of notable figures associated with Ambition, since its formation as the NACB to today, whether as club members, leaders, supporters or those assisting in promotional aspects of the charity. Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester - Became president of the NABC a year into its life in 1926. The Duke was not merely a figurehead to the charity but was active and untiring in his work for clubs. Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester ‚Äì Prince Henry's son, who has been Ambition's President since his father's death in 1974. Clement Attlee ‚Äì Was a youth club leader in the East End of London for fourteen years before going into politics. Following his political retirement Attlee became a vice-President of the NABC and remained an active supporter throughout his life.National Association of Boys' Clubs Annual Report 1956-7, London, 1957 Frankie Vaughan - Vaughn was a member of the Lancaster Lads' Club in his youth and throughout his life and career was an enthusiastic supporter of the NABC, visiting clubs around the country and donating the proceeds from one of his songs every year. Roger Bannister ‚Äì The first man to run a mile in under four minutes was an active NABC supporter and used his medical expertise as chairman of an NABC technical panel advising on physical recreation and health. A number of sports men and women were in their youth members of clubs affiliated to Ambition including: Jason Robinson, Dennis Nilsen, Ellen MacArthur, Alan Shearer, Amir Kahn, Peter Beardsley, Steve Bruce and Michael Carrick, Ravi Bopara. p. 55.

Johnson, Science for the Curious Photographer: An Introduction to the Science of Photography, page 71 is a secondary lens which is mounted on the front of a photographic lens to increase the effective focal length of the lens they are attached to. They are used on cameras and video cameras with non‚Äìinterchangeable lenses to increase the magnification of the image. Their design is usually that of an afocal Galilean telescope that alters the width of the entering beam of light without affecting the divergence of the beam, so they can change the effective focal length 1 to 3 times without increasing focal ratio. The down side to teleside converters is they will vignette the image on the wide angle setting if used on a zoom lens.Charles S. Johnson, Science for the Curious Photographer: An Introduction to the Science of Photography, page 71 Minimum Focal Length without vignetting will increase inline with higher power of the teleside converter. Before vignetting appears (four black corners), light fall-off will appear first and in general shooting this light fall-off may not be noticeable. The other concern is Minimum Working Distance, so the teleside converter cannot be used below minimum working distance and it depends on both the camera and the teleside converter being used. These types of lenses are used on cameras which lack the facility to change the primary lens and therefore cannot accept a standard rear mount teleconverter, such as consumer and \\"prosumer\\" video cameras and camcorders, bridge cameras, point-and-shoot cameras and some older consumer medium format cameras. Some camera models have specifically designed teleside converters.

They are notable for their former capital, Med√≥n Mairtine, becoming the chief church of the later E√≥ganachta, namely Emly. Mairtine mac Sithcheann Breog√°n; statue in A Coru√±a Geoffrey Keating's History of Ireland includes the following section, which may refer to the eponymous ancestor: > \\"Eochaidh Apthach (Eochu Apthach) son of Fionn, son of Oilill, son of Flann > Ruadh, son of Rothlan, son of Mairtine, son of Sithcheann, son of Riaghlan, > son of Eoinbhric son of Lughaidh, son of Ioth, son of Breoghan (Breog√°n), > held the sovereignty of Ireland one year; and he was called Eochaidh Apthach > because of the number who died in Ireland in his time; for the plague or > other disease seized upon the men of Ireland each month, from which many of > them died; hence the name Eochaidh Apthach clung to him; for apthach means > 'fatal'; and he himself fell by Fionn son of Bratha.\\" This would make Mairtine mac Sithcheann a gr-gr-gr-gr-grandson of Breog√°n mac Brath, mythical king of Galicia. Breogan's grandson, M√≠l Esp√°ine, was the father and uncle of the first Goidelic people to settle in Ireland. Eochu Apthach, Mairtine's gr-gr-gr-grandson, is given as a member of the Corcu Lo√≠gde. His reign is variously given as the 6th/5th, 7th, or 8th, century BC. However, it is nowhere explicitly stated that Mairtine mac Sithcheann was the eponym of the Mairtine people. Plus, the Mairtine people are accorded status of Fir Bolg, who were predecessors of the Gaels. Med√≥n Mairtine This term has been translated as middle of the Mairtine [nation], indicating that modern-day Emly, County Tipperary, was the central capital of the tribe. It is due west of Tipperary town, which is due west of Cashel, seat of the historic kings of Munster. It is therefore at what can be roughly regarded as the geographic centre (or middle, med√≥n) of Munster. In an essay of 2000, Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le notes the remote possibility that some of the Mairtine M√≥r \\"might just\\" have been located in Connacht, though he does not specify where. Ethnicity D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n notes that in one tradition, preserved in the Book of Lecan's still unpublished genealogies, the Mairtine are said to have been expelled from the north of Ireland, or Leth Cuinn, and to have settled in the territory later known as In D√©is Tuaisceirt, which would become D√°l gCais. More specifically, following a battle or series of battles, there was a reshuffling of geographic locations within Ireland, possibly helping form an E√≥ghanacht confederation that is spoken of in the Book of Munster and other sources. In Irish myth, there was a battle in 123AD between Eoghan Mor and Conn of the Hundred Battles, and it divided Ireland into two equal parts, by the boundary of Esker Riada - a long ridge of hills from Dublin to Galway. The traditional story is that the Mairtine are typically associated with Erainn, Benntraige, Ulaidhe, and the E√≥ghanachta. They are noted in the Book of Munster and by other scholars,.√ì Cr√≥in√≠n, p. 222O'Rahilly, p. 144 In a late poem they are given as one of the tribes of the Domnainn,O'Rahilly, p. 97 and are elsewhere, in popular tradition, said to have belonged to the mythological Fir Bolg. I References in Leabhar na nGenealach Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh records them in association with the √âarainn and Fir Bolg, listing them as the latter people in his Leabhar na nGenealach. He first mentions them in the statement that \\"Conmhal mac Ebhir, ri Ereann, do bhris cath Locha L√©n for Eurna, Mairtine, agus for Moghruith mac Mofebhis d'Fearuibh Bolg\\"/\\"Conmhal (Conm√°el) s. √âibhear, king of Ireland, won the battle of Loch L√©in (Lakes of Killarney) over the √âarainn, the Mairtine, and over Mogh Ruith (Mug Ruith?) s. Mo-Feibheas of Fir Bholg.\\" (46.5, p. 210-11, LNG). At 47.2 he wrote that Siorna mac Dian (S√≠rna S√°eglach), king of Ireland, won the battle of M√≥in Fhoichnigh among U√≠ Fhailghe (Kingdom of U√≠ Failghe) over the Mairtine and √âarainn. He states the among the tribes who pay \\"servile rent\\" were \\"Tuath Fhochmhuinn ... of Ui Fhailghe and over Fotharta (Fort√∫atha?) of Dairbhre (Kildorrery?) and Almhain (Bog of Allen/Hill of Allen) and Mairtine or Maidirdine.\\" (50.7, pp. 217‚Äì17). At 51.8 he gives their territories as \\"Tuath Mhairtine in M√∫scraighe Miontaine (M√∫scraige) and in Oirthear Feimhin [=eastern Feimhean (see Slievenamon)] and Liag Tuaill and Liag T√≠ re and Aodha and Bre√≥ghain and in Ui Chairbre (see U√≠ Fidgenti).\\" In the poem Sloindfead athachtuatha Ereann, which lists the vassal-tribes (see D√©isi, or Attacotti?) of Ireland, MacFhirbhisigh relates that \\"the Mairtine over the middle of Munster/what of it is not remembered by all.\\" (55.6, pp. 224‚Äì25). He likewise lists them among the Fir Bolg in the poem G√° l√≠ on i bhF√≥ dla Fir Bholg? (56.3, pp. 226‚Äì37) The Annals of the Four Masters The Annals of the Four Masters date Conmael's reign of thirty years ending in Anno Mundi 3579. These annals further state that Angus Olmucahda (√ìengus Olmucaid), who died in Anno Mundi 3790, had defeated them in \\"the battle of Cuirce, the battle of Sliabh Cailge, against the Martini, in the territory of Corca Bhaiscinn.\\" The territory of Corcu Baiscind lies within what is now County Clare.

Biography  Dmitry Lachinov studied in the St. Petersburg University, where he was a pupil of Heinrich Lenz, Pafnuty Chebyshev and Feodor Petrushevsky. In 1862, when the University was closed because of the students' unrest, Lachinov went to Germany and for two and a half years studied there under the guidance of Gustav Kirchhoff, Robert Bunsen and Hermann Helmholtz, attending practical lessons in their laboratories in Heidelberg and T√ºbingen. In a paper released in 1880, Lachinov became the first one to point out the possibility of electricity transmission over long distances, and to propose the means of achieving it ‚Äî 18 months before the first publication of the article with similar conclusions by Marcel Deprez. In 1889 Lachinov wrote the first textbook on meteorology and climatology in Russia. In its 2nd edition (July 1895) he gave the first description of the lightning detector invented earlier by Alexander Popov (the device was also a prototype of the first practical radio receiver). Lachinov's own inventions include a mercury pump, economizer for electricity consumption, electrical insulation tester (or defectoscope), optical dynamometer, a special types of photometer and electrolyser. One of his main achievements was a method of industrial synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis (1888). Dmitry Lachinov is great-grandfather of physical chemist Mikhail Schultz.

She is a professor at UFRGS, and a director of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences. Biography Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, she did her high school studies at the Col√©gio Marechal Rondon, in Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and her undergraduate and graduate studies at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil. After getting her PhD she spent two years as a postdoc at the research group of Michael Fisher at the University of Maryland. Back in Brazil she got a permanent position at the UFRGS where she works now, as Full Professor of Physics. Research on water A molecule of water ‚Äì two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen ‚Äì seems simple enough, but the properties of this mysterious substance have baffled scientists for generations. Throughout her career, Barbosa has sought to unlock the secrets of water's anomalies, initially from a theoretical perspective and then by focusing her insights on practical applications for medicine and the life sciences. Barbosa's work has helped explain why many characteristics of water ‚Äì the motion of its molecules, its reaction to changes in temperature and pressure ‚Äì make it different from other liquids in vast and important ways, and how biomolecules such as DNA, proteins and fats interact with water within the human body. She has furthermore developed a series of models about the properties of water that have contributed to our understanding of water's interactions with biological molecules and geological processes. Questions of gender In 1998 she became involved with the gender issue in physics. She worked as chair of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics Working Group on Women in Physics. This group organized a number of conferences on women in physics. In 2008 she became vice-president of the Union of Pure and Applied Physics and director of the Instituto de F√≠sica da UFRGS.

Its members are not simple consumers, they are also believers and promoters. A brand tribe is capable of collective action and therefore has implications for businesses. Origins The concept of tribal consumption revolves around the research and writings of numerous academic researchers who have expressed ‚ÄúTribal Based Views of brand‚Äù.'Brand Warfare: Ten Rules for Building the Killer Brand, with Michele Owens', 2001; p.22 describes the tribes people belong to as \\"determined even less by geography, pedigree, race or religion. Instead, our tribes are determined largely by education and accomplishment, and they are manifested by the things we consume. More and more, they are brand tribes.\\" Much of the research on brand tribalism depicts 21st Century society as a network of micro-cultures or ‚Äútribes.‚Äù A key element of brand tribes is that they are organically and voluntarily formed through individual identification with a brand. Factors that contribute to the formation of a brand tribe are perceived brand authenticity, experiences felt through interaction with the brand and a collective sense of belonging within a group.Veloutsou, Cleopatra/Moutinho, Luiz . (2009) Brand relationships through brand reputation and brand tribalism, Journal of Business Research, March 2009 Central to the fabric of brand tribes is a deep conviction as to the notion of truth or rightness (Belief). The concept of Tribal Marketing - \\"All Tribes have Brands & All Brands have Tribes\\" was first developed in 1984 at McCann-Erickson Advertising (Sydney) by Mark Lovick for Coca-Cola USA. Prior to 1984 the concept of Tribal Marketing did not exist internationally, only socio/economic, etc demographic 'research statistics' disciplines were used. Potential red flags Much in this area is still under-theorised. Academics have explored and discussed the degree of connectedness between consumers and brands and the implications for post-modern organisations and consumption. Kozinets and Handelman have been amongst those to call for further conceptualisations (Kozinets and Handelman, 2004). References Further reading * Kozinets, Robert V. & Jay M.

Described as \\"a man of the theatre with whom directors love to work; he is good with singers; he knows the British opera world like the back of his hand. He is a controversial and outspoken defender of the operatic form, and a passionate advocate of opera in English\\",Charlotte Higgins, \\"Wimps need not apply\\", The Guardian (London), 11 February 2005 his work includes a large discography of complete opera recordings of rarely performed works made on the Opera Rara and Chandos record labels, as well as works recorded with well-known British and European orchestras. Parry is also a member of the support staff of the Cardiff International Academy of Voice Early career Parry was educated at Cambridge University and the Royal Academy of Music in London. He explains how he became a conductor by way of wanting to be a singer: \\"Audrey Langford, who was a very important singing teacher in the 1960s and '70s, ran a rather good choir which she conducted herself, and with Ande Anderson, who was resident producer at Covent Garden, she'd founded the Kentish Opera Group..One day she simply said, \\"I think you ought to be a conductor....I'll give you a few lessons, and you can conduct my choir a bit.\\" Well, she did, and I did, and there I was conducting La traviata. Geraint Evans came to hear it and told me that he thought there was something there and that I should go on conducting.\\" Michael Oliver, \\"The pure and lyrical\\", Gramophone (London), November 2000 He continued conducting studies with Sergiu Celibidache in Spain, covering a wide repertory: \\"I did a lot of Beethoven Ninths....a lot of Spanish contemporary music, too, quite a lot of Handel..I even did the Spanish premiere of Britten's Peter Grimes...\\" and subsequently served on the conducting staffs of the Dortmund Opera, Opera North and Glyndebourne, and became Music Director of English Touring Opera from 1983 to 1987. Work for Opera Rara and Chandos Parry's name has become associated with Chandos Records's recordings of operas in English (principally underwritten by the Peter Moores Foundation), as well as Opera Rara's rare and unusual operas, many from the bel canto era of the early 19th century. The latter include the works of composers such as Vincenzo Bellini (La straniera where \\"David Parry leads the LPO in a gripping account of a tricky piece\\"),Patrick O'Connor, \\"Blood-and-thunder bel canto: Opera Rara put us in their debt once more, Gramophone, November 2008 Gioachino Rossini, Giovanni Pacini, Simon Mayr, and Saverio Mercadante. Of his recording of the latter composer's Emma d'Antiochia, one critic wrote: :\\"Conductor Parry seems to have an almost uncanny insight into music of the bel canto school, particularly in the selection of tempos. He is rhythmically propulsive, always supportive of the singers, but not subject to their whims. Indeed, this is (as is so often true of Parry-led operas) a true ensemble effort.\\"Charles H Parsons, \\"ARG Reviews Mercadante's Emma d'Antiochia \\", 13 November 2004 on operatoday.com Critical reaction to a recording of a rare Rossini opera, Ricciardo e Zoraide is instructive: :\\"David Parry has been part of the team for the last several recordings issued by Opera Rara and is one of the stalwarts, his enthusiasm and control forming the skeleton which the performers are able to flesh out with much panache\\"Joel Kasow, \\"A Bel Canto Explosion\\", 20 August 1998 on culturekiosque.com Recent activities In 1992, he founded the Almeida Opera Festival and remains the Artistic Director. Currently he is an Artistic Associate at the Norfolk and Norwich Festival and an Artistic Advisor to Opera Rara. As a guest conductor, Parry has appeared with the English National Opera, Garsington Opera, the Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Greek National Opera, the New Israeli Opera, Opera North, Portland Opera, the Royal Swedish Opera, the Staatsoper Hannover, the Staatstheater Stuttgart, the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid, and Theater Basel among others.

It was part of the III Corps of the Bundeswehr, which also incorporated in 1985 the 2nd Panzergrenadier Division and 12th Panzer Division.Isby and Kamps, Armies of NATO's Central Front, Jane's Publishing Company, 1985, p.196 III Corps was part of NATO's Central Army Group (CENTAG), along with the Bundeswehr's II Corps and the American V and VII Corps. Headquarters in 1985 was at Diez/Lahn, with subordinate brigades at Wetzlar (13th PG Bde), Neustadt/Marburg (6th Panzer Brigade) and Koblenz (15th Panzergrenadier Brigade). It played a major role in the defense of West Germany from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The division was constituted on 1 October 1956 as part of the III Corps of the Bundeswehr. In 1985, the corps also received the 2nd Panzergrenadier Division and 12th Panzer Division. Subordinated to NATO's Central Army Group, the III Corps defended the \\"zone of vital defense\\" of NATO, at the side of the II Corps of the German Army and the U.S. Army's V and VII Corps. Following the Soviet Union's fall, the US VII Corps was withdrawn and two combined US/German corps were created in the former CENTAG area. As part of this arrangement, 5th Armoured Division was administratively placed under the V Corps (United States) for main defence purposes. This meant that if an attack from the East was anticipated, the division would fall under U.S. control. Meanwhile, an American division would likewise fall under control of the German II or III Corps. The 5th Panzer sent some of their units to Yugoslavia in 1990. German budget constraints meant that the 5th Panzer Division had to be indefinitely disbanded on 30 June 2001.

The system's history is closely tied to the very beginnings of mainstream CAD and the research culture fostered by Cambridge University and the UK government as well as the resulting \\"Cambridge Phenomenon\\"The CADCentre has been described as one of the most important factors in what is now known as the \\"Cambridge Phenomenon\\", - the transformation of Cambridge into a high tech centre of world renown in the 1980s. See Segal Quince & Partners. \\"The Cambridge Phenomenon The Growth of High Technology Industry in a University Town\\", 1985. MPDS was originally developed for 3D plant design and layout and piping design. Today the software includes modules for 2D/3D factory layout, process and instrumentation diagrams (P&ID;), mechanical handling systems design, steel design, ducting (HVAC) design, electrical design and hangers and supports Design. The latest version, MPDS4 5.2.1, was released for Microsoft Windows and Sun Solaris in February 2014.  History  MPDS‚Äô historyThis history is based on interviews of Cambridge software developers who worked with Dick Newell and Tom Sancha, and were employed by all or some of: CIS, Computervision, PTC, Quintic Ltd and CAD Schroer is tied in with the Computer-Aided Design Centre (or CADCentre) which was created in Cambridge in 1967 by the UK Government to carry out CAD research. Famous British computer scientist Dr. Dick Newell worked there on a file-based macro language driven 3D plant design system called PDMS (Plant Design Management System). Together with colleague Tom Sancha he left the CADCentre in 1977 to form a company called Cambridge Interactive Systems or CIS and primarily concentrated on 2D CAD. CIS had developed an electrical cabling solution initially called CABLOS, which was first purchased by Dowty Engineering in about 1979. Another early adopter was BMW, which used the system for car wiring diagrams. CABLOS soon became known and sold as the MEDUSA drafting system under CIS. The proprietary programming language with which MEDUSA version 1 was developed was known as baCIS 1. Around this time, the company also began developing its own 3D modelling kernel for MEDUSA. Around 1980, CIS partnered with Prime Computer, a U.S.-based computer hardware provider. Prime had an option on the MEDUSA source code should CIS ever fail. In 1983 the U.S. CAD company Computervision purchased CIS. Computervision/CIS started developing the MEDUSA Plant Design System (MPDS), the first plant design software based on a relational database. Developers knew from their prior experience with a file-based macro-language driven system that the next generation plant design system had to be built on a relational database and with a much more powerful programming language to handle large data volumes, complexity and relationships. Whereas mechanical CAD engineers were developing machinery with a few hundred or maybe a thousand components, plant design engineers typically needed to deal with hundreds of thousands of components. To facilitate this work, the baCIS 2 interpretive language and the MDB relational database were developed for MPDS. Existing MEDUSA technology was used to create the 2D and 3D geometric data required for plant layouts. The creation of this data-centric concept separated the 3D visualisation of a plant from the underlying database and allowed engineers to plan and design installations with very large volumes of data, and produce all the required 2D drawings from 3D plant designs.See also Lichten, L. \\"The emerging technology of CAD/CAM\\", Proceedings of the 1984 annual conference of the ACM on The fifth generation challenge, 1984. The first MPDS sales date to around 1988 to NEI Parsons (Northern Engineering Industries later became part of the Rolls Royce Industrial Power Group). Courtaulds Engineering, which had been using MEDUSA since 1983, was also an early MPDS adopter. In the same year Prime Computer merged with Computervision and adopted the name Computervision to concentrate on software, due to declining hardware sales. MEDUSA continued to be developed throughout the 1990s in Cambridge, UK at Computervision's R&D; centre at Harston Mill. In 1993, the next generation of MEDUSA and MPDS was released. What would have been version 13 was released as MEDUSA NG and MPDS NG. They signified the shift from tablet-driven menus to a graphical user interface, although tablets could still be used on that release. In 1994 Computervision closed its R&D; facility in Cambridge, moving to Boston, Massachusetts. As a result, five former Computervision staff members and MEDUSA experts formed the company Quintic Ltd in Cambridge, which continued to provide MEDUSA and MPDS development and consultancy services to Computervision and the MEDUSA customer base. Work included the porting of MEDUSA NG to Microsoft Windows. In 1998 the American CAD company Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) acquired Computervision. The development partnership between Quintic and Computervision transferred to PTC. One of the largest MEDUSA user bases was in the heavily manufacturing-driven economy of Germany. CAD Schroer, a company founded in 1986 by Michael Schroer as a provider of CAD-based engineering services, became a MEDUSA vendor in 1988, having used the software extensively on client projects. The company, which also provided add-on modules and customisations, had established a development relationship first with Computervision, then with PTC. In 2001, CAD Schroer acquired all rights to MEDUSA and MPDS from PTC. The development partnership between Quintic and CAD Schroer strengthened, as the two companies worked to create a Fourth Generation release of MEDUSA and MPDS. This included a complete overhaul of the functionality; the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) based on the Qt (framework) technology, the development of data exchange mechanisms and interfaces with third party systems, and the porting to the Linux open-source operating system. In 2005, CAD Schroer acquired its development partner Quintic Ltd, gaining CAD development expertise that dates back to the days of CIS and Prime. CAD Schroer UK remains a software development centre in Cambridge, whose staff continue to develop and support MEDUSA4 and MPDS4 in partnership with CAD development experts at CAD Schroer GmbH in Moers, Germany. In 2006, CAD Schroer released the Fourth Generation of the MPDS plant design system, MPDS4. Since then the company has continued to develop and extend the functionality of the product suite, including the development of a factory layout module for designing 3D factories based on 2D drawings.  Technical Description   Database Architecture  Multi-user engineering design in MPDS is relational database-driven. The project database can be deployed as a central design database or as a project-specific database and contains component catalogs with assigned component attributes. The database drives the design graphics as well as user administration and can be integrated with other database-driven systems, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.  3D Graphics  MPDS combines use of the HOOPS 3D Graphics System with the relational database, whose catalog component attributes define the visual representation of each component. Because 3D plant models can be generated from catalog-based drawing routines, the demand on computer memory and resources is limited. Plants of hundreds of thousands of components can be designed, edited and exported to a compact .HSF format for external visual review. The system support varying display detail levels, allowing designers to visualise components either in great detail, visually simplified, or merely as an outline object in space, required for effective clash detection.  User Administration  Central user administration and access controls in MPDS allow Administrators to set up a variety of users who can work on a plant design simultaneously, and who can have different access privileges - limited, for example, to certain design disciplines or to certain areas within a plant. This is supported by integrated version and change management.  Quality Assurance  MPDS4 includes hard and soft clash detection, which can be applied to a whole project, to separate systems or between selected components. Consistency checking tools allow users to check work against specific design rules. Results can be passed to customisable reports, and components used in a design are automatically included in parts lists.  Modules  The MPDS4 Assembly Manager is at the core of the plant design and factory layout system and can be extended with several user extensible and customisable modules covering the plant engineering disciplines. The MPDS4 Piping Design module delivers automated piping isometrics ; PIPING DESIGN : MPDS4 PIPING DESIGN is an industrial piping design software add-on with extensive libraries of catalogue components to a variety of industrial standards, including DIN, ANSI and BS. Its routing tools are used for loading, positioning and replacing components, manually or automatically. The module supports P&ID-driven; piping design and is pipe specification driven, so that only components from the same specification can be connected. MPDS4 PIPING DESIGN is fully integrated with ISOGEN (from ALIAS Piping Solutions) for automated piping isometric production. ; P&ID; : P&ID; is an application for creating intelligent process and instrumentation diagrams; for data extraction, and for use of data to create and cross-check the 3D world. Design can be database-driven and based on existing parts lists. P&ID; diagrams can be used to form the basis of 2D layouts and 3D designs, with the ability to cross-check P&IDs; and automatically load P&ID; components not yet included in a 3D plant design in the appropriate position.MPDS4 Factory Layout offers a hybrid 2D/3D design environment ; FACTORY LAYOUT : MPDS4 FACTORY LAYOUT is a hybrid 2D/3D design environment where 2D layouts or drawings are used as the basis of 3D designs. Height attributes added to 2D building plans are used to produce 3D buildings. Symbols used in a 2D layout are linked to 3D model files which are automatically generated when users switch to 3D. Other components or product specials can be modelled using a sheet-based modelling approach. ; MATERIALS HANDLING : MPDS4 MECHANICAL HANDLING is a design application with a series of configurable catalogs of mechanical materials handling components, which can be physically interconnected to form part of an industrial process. It includes catalogs of conveyor belts, cranes, fork lift trucks, industrial racking and robots and allows installation designers to select, lay out, configure, visualise and add intelligence to process machinery in a plant. The module also supports the controlled creation of product specials for materials handling. ; STEEL DESIGN : MPDS4 STEEL DESIGN is a module for constructing steel frames for buildings and equipment support. MPDS4 STEEL DESIGN includes catalogs of steel sections for many worldwide steel standards and allows users to design steel members, plates, stairs and ladders. ; DUCTING DESIGN : MPDS4 DUCTING DESIGN is a software module for routing HVAC, of differing sections, into a plant or factory. MPDS4 DUCTING DESIGN includes catalogs with different types of ducts, valves, fans and other supporting components. MPDS4 Engineering Review virtual walk-through of an airport ; ELECTRICAL DESIGN : MPDS4 ELECTRICAL DESIGN is a design module for routing or connecting electrical systems with components throughout a plant, ship or factory. The user extensible and customisable catalogs contain many different types of electrical and control systems, as well as cable trays, cable ducts and links, and other supporting components. Auto routing functionality finds the shortest cable route between two designated points. By adding a KVA (kilo volt-ampere) rating to selected components, users can analyse the required power rating of an entire network of connected instances and cables. ; HANGERS & SUPPORTS DESIGN : MPDS4 HANGERS & SUPPORTS DESIGN is a design application for accurately modelling supports between pipes and steelwork in a plant or installation. ; ENGINEERING REVIEW : MPDS4 ENGINEERING REVIEW is an application for conducting realistic engineering design reviews within the MPDS4 plant environment, visually presenting all of the plant project data. The module contains functionality for sectioning and setting transparency and allows users to define and generate movie-like walkthroughs of an installation. ; REVIEW : MPDS4 REVIEW is an external review application for users who do not have the MPDS4 plant design system installed. MPDS4 can generate .HSF (Hoops format) files of a plant design, which can be e-mailed to users of the MPDS4 REVIEW tool. They use the software to conduct interactive design reviews and walk-throughs, or present designs to third parties.

Club career Giuliani developed in the Arezzo youth sector and later made his professional debut with the senior squad. He made his Serie A debut during the 1980‚Äì81 season with Como. In 1985, he moved to Verona and in 1988 he moved to Maradona's Napoli, where he achieved notable success and recognition due to his performances; with the club, he won an UEFA Cup (1988‚Äì89) and a Serie A title (1989‚Äì90). He later moved to Udinese in 1990, where he ended his career, retiring from professional football in 1993. International career Giuliani represented Italy at the 1988 Summer Olympics, where the team finished in fourth place after reaching the semi-finals of the tournament. Style of play Giuliani was known to be an efficient rather than spectacular goalkeeper, with a good all-round game and few weaknesses, being adept both in his shot-stopping between the posts and at rushing off his line, and often produced decisive saves throughout his career. Although he was known for his reserved character, he also excelled at organising his team's defensive line. Personal life Giuliani was married to the Italian showgirl and television personality Raffaella Del Rosario. The couple met in 1987 and were wed in 1988; together they had a daughter, Gessica, born in 1989. Giuliani believed that he contracted the HIV virus in 1989 in Buenos Aires during Diego Maradona's wedding party on 7 November. There he met a woman ‚Äì possibly a prostitute ‚Äì whom he believed had infected him; in 1991, Giuliani confided to his wife that he had betrayed her only on that one occasion. The news of his illness was leaked by the media in 1992, and there were initially rumours in the press that his disease was related to drug use, which were later discredited however. He subsequently retired to Bologna in 1993, where he ran a clothing store and received treatment for the disease. Although he and his wife had initially separated 1991, Del Rosario later tended to Giuliani throughout his illness. Giuliani died from a pulmonary complications which arose as a result of AIDS on 14 November 1996, at the Policlinico Sant'Orsola- Malpighi in Bologna.

It was built in 1908 It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Production finished in 1991 and it was demolished in 1994. Location Oldham is a large town in Greater Manchester, England. It lies amongst the Pennines on elevated ground between the rivers Irk and Medlock, south-southeast of Rochdale, and northeast of the city of Manchester. Oldham is surrounded by several smaller settlements which together form the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham; Chadderton and Hollinwood are such settlements. Chadderton and Hollinwood are served by the Rochdale Canal and the Hollinwood Branch Canal. A rail service was provided by the Oldham Loop Line built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. History Oldham rose to prominence during the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the first ever industrialised towns, rapidly becoming \\"one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in England\\", spinning Oldham counts, the coarser counts of cotton. Oldham's soils were too thin and poor to sustain crop growing, and so for decades prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade. It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that Oldham changed from being a cottage industry township producing woollen garments via domestic manual labour, to a sprawling industrial metropolis of textile factories. The first mill, Lees Hall, was built by William Clegg in about 1778. Within a year, 11 other mills had been constructed, but by 1818 there were only 19 of these privately owned mills. It was in the second half of the 19th century, that Oldham became the world centre for spinning cotton yarn. This was due in a large part to the formation of limited liability companies known as Oldham Limiteds. In 1851, over 30% of Oldham's population was employed within the textile sector, compared to 5% across Great Britain. At its zenith, it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world.. By 1871 Oldham had more spindles than any country in the world except the United States, and in 1909, was spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined. By 1911 there were 16.4 million spindles in Oldham, compared with a total of 58 million in the United Kingdom and 143.5 million in the world; in 1928, with the construction of the UK's largest textile factory Oldham reached its manufacturing zenith. At its peak, there were over 360 mills, operating night and day; Kent Mill was built in 1908 by Kent Mill Ltd. The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914‚Äì1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Kent Mill, Chadderton was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. In 1950, LCC converted it from a mule mill to a ring mill for Egyptian cotton with 104,000 spindles. The mill closed 1991 and was demolished in 1994.  Architecture  Kent Mill in 1951.

The company was based on Carl G. Brown, Sr.‚Äôs high ethical standards and business integrity. In 1917 California Casualty began offering auto insurance, followed by home insurance in 1954. His son, Carl G. Brown, Jr. took over as Chairman in 1957 and, in 1965 codified his father's principles in the California Casualty Code. In 1951, California Casualty pioneered what is now an industry trend of affinity insurance programs when it received the endorsement of the California Teachers Association (CTA) to provide auto and home insurance to its members. Sixty years later they still serve CTA and its members and expanded nationally with over 100 other endorsements including the National Education Association (NEA); many police, state trooper, and firefighter associations; and universities and medical centers. In 1978, after Carl G. Brown, Jr. retired, his son, Tom Brown, carried on the family tradition and moved up to Chairman of the Board. Under Tom's leadership the business expanded across the country when it received the NEA endorsement. In 2007, Beau Brown continued as the fourth generation to head California Casualty becoming the company‚Äôs President and Chief Executive Officer. In 2013, he was named Chairman and CEO as his right hand man, Joe Volponi, became California Casualty‚Äôs President.[5] Today, Brown remains Chairman of the Board while Volponi is now President and CEO. Products and markets They provide personal insurance programs for affinity groups and their members. California Casualty offers auto insurance in 44 states and the District of Columbia and property insurance in 38 states and the District of Columbia. They also offer personal liability umbrella, earthquake, flood, boat, recreational vehicle, snowmobile, and pet insurance through business partners. Programs Impact Teen Drivers \\\\- California Casualty Group teamed with the California Teachers Association (CTA) and the California Association of Highway Patrolmen (CAHP) to launch a teen driver awareness program aimed at saving young lives. The program is geared directly toward the newest drivers ‚Äî 10th graders ‚Äî and it focuses on making them aware of the dangers of distracted driving. The public information campaign officially launched in April 2008. The website, What Do You Consider Lethal? gives teens a chance to learn from others' experiences of the impact of bad driving judgments. Financials California Casualty's policyholder-owned organization is rated B++ (Good) with a stable outlook by A.M. Best Company. California Casualty does not carry any debt on its balance sheet and has no liquidity issues. Their conservative investment philosophy prohibits exposure to the kinds of risks that have shaken Wall Street. Legal structure California Casualty Group comprises California Casualty Indemnity Exchange (the ‚ÄúExchange‚Äù), and its four wholly owned subsidiary insurance companies: California Casualty Insurance Company, California Casualty & Fire Insurance Company, California Casualty General Insurance Company of Oregon and California Casualty Compensation Insurance Company. The insurance business of the Exchange and its subsidiary insurance companies is managed, by contract, by California Casualty Management Company, a separate and independent company. The relationship between California Casualty Management Company and the Exchange has been in place since the founding of the Exchange in 1914. Advisory board The Exchange is governed by a 17-person Advisory Board. The role of the Advisory Board is to supervise the finances of the Exchange and oversee the Exchange's relationship with its attorney-in-fact, California Casualty Management Company. Locations California Casualty's home office is located in San Mateo, California. The company operates three virtual call centers. The Colorado Springs, Colorado location opened in 1994. The call center in Leawood, Kansas opened in 1993. The center in Glendale, Arizona opened in 1999. Contributions to the community California Casualty serves the broader community in many ways. Employees dedicate significant time and effort in a variety of activities to raise money for heart disease and cancer research, and to help those less fortunate with food and gifts during the holidays. California Casualty also allows customers to reduce their mail by opting for electronic payments and document delivery. The company fosters a culture of participation and volunteerism through a variety of programs in 44 states, including: * Adopt A School * American Heart Association * Athletics Grants * Care and Share Food Bank * Christmas Unlimited \\"Operation Back to School\\" and holiday toy drive * CTA Disaster Relief Fund * Help Your Classroom monetary donation program * Hurricane Harvey Relief * JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge Run * Kansas KVC Back to School Drive * Music & Arts Grant * LaPorte, TX Fire Department flood damage vehicles for extrication training in conjunction with SFFMA * National Fallen Firefighters Foundation Memorial and 9/11 Stair Climbs * National Volunteer Fire Council's Jr. Firefighter of the Year and Junior Firefighter Program of the Year * NEA Foundation's California Casualty Award for Teaching Excellence * Police Officers Relief and Education Foundation Wildfire Relief Fund * School Lounge Makeover * State affiliate charitable fund tournaments * The Salvation Army While not a complete list of activities, it illustrates the corporate citizenship of California Casualty and its employees. The Carl Brown, Jr. Award of Excellence On January 1, 1980 the company established the Carl G. Brown, Jr. Award of Excellence, an annual award to be given to California Casualty Management Company employee for excellence in their performance of business activities and involvement in the community. Although many companies have such annual awards for top-performing employees, the Carl Brown, Jr. Award of Excellence has a unique theme. Tom Brown felt that the award should have a permanent exhibit in the California Casualty Group's home offices. Edward J. Fraughton, a well-known artist from Utah was commissioned to create a sculpture of a mountain man. Fraughton created two pieces, the first entitled \\"Edge of Silence,\\" is the permanent exhibit and the second entitled ‚ÄúThe Pathfinder‚Äù is given as the annual award. The Carl G. Brown, Jr. Award goes to an employee for excellence in their performance of business activities and involvement in the community. Competition California Casualty does not serve the general public. They focus efforts on affinity niche market group members.

Laidler, circa 1936. Harry Wellington Laidler (February 18, 1884 ‚Äì July 14, 1970) was an American socialist writer, magazine editor, and politician. He is best remembered as Executive Director of the League for Industrial Democracy, successor to the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, and for his close political association with perennial Socialist Party Presidential nominee Norman Thomas. He also served a two-year term on the New York City Council. Early years Harry W. Laidler was born February 18, 1884, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of a salesman. The Laidler family was comfortable, middle-class, and politically liberal.Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.), Encyclopedia of the American Left. First edition. New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; pp. 408-409. Young Harry attended public school in Brooklyn, before graduating to attend Wesleyan University, from which he obtained a Bachelor's degree in 1907.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 131. Upon graduation, Laidler worked as a reporter for the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper, attending Brooklyn Law School at night. Laidler's graduation from law school in 1910 also marked the end of his career as a news reporter. He subsequently enrolled in Columbia University in New York City, from which he obtained his Ph.D. in 1914. Political career Harry Laidler was a committed socialist from his teenage years, enrolling in the Socialist Party of America in 1903. In 1905 became a founding member of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS), a national organization dedicated to advancing the study of socialism on college campuses around the country through lectures, debates, and publications. Laidler was named to the ISS's executive committee as a representative of undergraduates. Upon his graduation from law school in 1910, he was named Secretary of the ISS, serving as well as editor of its magazine, The Intercollegiate Socialist, from the time of its launch in 1913. He continued to edit this publication and its successor, The Socialist Review, until 1921. In 1921, with much of the youth section of the socialist movement departed to the Communist Party of America and Communist Labor Party, the ISS determined to change its name to the League for Industrial Democracy (LID). The name change marked a shifting of orientation, from an exclusive concentration upon college campuses to bringing socialist ideas to trade unions and the general public. Harry Laidler was named the Executive Director of the revamped organization ‚Äî a position which he would continue to hold until 1957. Laidler was a close associate of pacifist minister Norman Thomas in the LID. Thomas was a fellow New Yorker born in the same year as Laidler, and the pair shared a middle-class upbringing and a rather academic and technocratic view towards the American Socialist movement. A trusted confidante, Laidler helped to manage Thomas' 1928 and 1932 runs for President as the nominee of the Socialist Party. During the faction fight between a Left Wing loyal to Thomas and an organized Old Guard faction that wracked the Socialist Party from 1934 to 1936, Laidler played a key role for the young insurgents, running for and winning election as State Secretary of the Socialist Party of New York in a hotly contested race with Old Guard leader Louis Waldman. Laidler was president of the National Bureau of Economic Research from 1930 to 1932 and again from 1948 to 1949. He also served as head of its Board of Directors from 1932 to 1934. He frequently contributed book reviews to scholarly journals in this period, a long list which included the American Journal of Sociology, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, The Journal of Political Economy, and the American Economic Review.An advanced search of WorldCat listing \\"Harry W. Laidler\\" as \\"author\\" generates a lengthy list. Laidler was twice a candidate on the Socialist Party ticket, running for Governor of New York in 1936 and for U.S. Senator from New York in 1938. He was later a successful candidate of the American Labor Party for New York City Council in 1940, serving a 2-year term as an alderman. Death and legacy Harry Laidler died on July 14, 1970, two years after his friend Norman Thomas. Footnotes Works Books and pamphlets * Boycotts and the Labor Struggle: Economic and Legal Aspects.

These populations are classified as the subspecies Canis aureus moreoticus in Mammal Species of the World. It is unclear if C. a. caucasica from the Caucasus belongs to this taxon. is a subspecies of golden jackal native to Southeast Europe, Anatolia and perhaps the Caucasus. It was first described by French naturalist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire during the Morea expedition. There were an estimated 70,000 jackals in Europe according to one source, another source gives estimate of 97,000 to 117,000 animals. Though mostly found in southeastern Europe, its range has grown to encompass parts the Baltic in northeastern Europe, Peep M√§nnil: L√§√§nemaal elab veel v√§hemalt kaks ≈°aakalit, t√µen√§oliselt rohkem, Eestielu.ee (3 April 2013) Italy,Clementi, Maria. Scoperto in Val Tagliamento lo sciacallo dorato with more recent sightings in Western Europe. One theory which has been set forth to explain the rapid spread of the species since the 1970s to colonise European areas in which they were perhaps likely never historically native, is less abundant grey wolf populations than in the historic past. Physical description The European subspecies is the largest of the golden jackals, with animals of both sexes measuring 120‚Äì125 cm (47‚Äì49 in) in total length and 10‚Äì13 kg (20‚Äì29 lb) in body weight.Giannatos, G.

Calderini publ., Bologna, pp. 47‚Äì58 The fur is coarse, and is generally brightly coloured with blackish tones on the back. The thighs, upper legs, ears and forehead are bright reddish chestnut.Heptner, V. & Naumov, N. P. (1988), Mammals of the Soviet Union Vol.II Part 1a, Sirenia and Carnivora (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears), Science Publishers, Inc. USA. pp. 129-164, Jackals in Northern Dalmatia have broader than average skulls, which is thought to result from human induced isolation from other populations, thus resulting in a new morphotype. Diet In the Caucasus, jackals mainly hunt hares, small rodents, pheasants, partridges, ducks, coots, moorhens and passerines. They readily eat lizards, snakes, frogs, fish, molluscs and insects. During the winter period, they will kill many nutrias and waterfowl. During such times, jackals will surplus kill and cache what they do not eat. Jackals will feed on fruits such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood and the cones of Common Medlars. Golden jackals tend not to be as damaging to livestock as wolves and red foxes are, though they can become a serious nuisance to small sized stock when in high numbers. The highest number of livestock damages occurred in southern Bulgaria: 1,053 attacks on small stock, mainly sheep and lambs, were recorded between 1982‚Äì87, along with some damages to newborn deer in game farms. In Greece, rodents, insects, carrion, and fruits comprise the jackal's diet, though they rarely eat garbage, due to large numbers of stray dogs preventing them access to places with high human density. Jackals in Turkey have been known to eat the eggs of the endangered green sea-turtle. In Hungary, their most frequent prey are common voles and bank voles. In Dalmatia, mammals (the majority being even-toed ungulates and lagomorphs) made up 50.3% of the golden jackal's diet, fruit seeds (14% each being common fig and common grape vine, while 4.6% are Juniperus oxycedrus) and vegetables 34.1%, insects (16% orthopteras, 12% beetles, and 3% dictyopteras) 29.5%, birds and their eggs 24.8%, artificial food 24%, and branches, leaves, and grass 24%. Information on the diet of jackals in North-Eastern Italy is scant, but it is certain that they prey on small roe deer and hares. Distribution The jackal's current European range mostly encompasses the Balkan region, where the population had been reduced in many areas by the 1960s, with core populations occurring in scattered regions such as Strandja, the Dalmatian Coast, Aegean Macedonia and the Peloponnese. It recolonised its former territories in Bulgaria during 1962, following legislative protection, and subsequently expanded its range into Romania and Serbia. Individual jackals further expanded into Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia during the 1980s. The golden jackal is listed as an Annex V species in the EU Habitats Directive and as such may be hunted or killed in Estonia, Greece and all other EU member states, should these states allow this based on their own laws, but the population must be monitored and submitted to the European Commission every six years. The distribution of the golden jackal across Europe in 2015. Shaded areas represent permanent residence and circles represent individual records. Balkans and further east Bulgaria has the largest jackal population in Europe, which went through a 33‚Äìfold increase in range from the early sixties to mid-eighties. Factors aiding this increase include the replacement of natural forests with dense scrub, an increase in animal carcasses from state game farms, reductions in wolf populations and the abandonment of poisoning campaigns. In the early 1990s, it was estimated that up to 5000 jackals populated Bulgaria. The population increased in 1994, and appears to have stabilised.Giannatos, G., 2004. Conservation Action Plan for the golden jackal Canis aureus L. in Greece . WWF Greece. Athens, Greece. pp. 47 In Greece, as of 2013 golden jackals are the rarest of the three wild extant canids there, having disappeared from central Greece, western Greece and Corfu, they are now limited to disjunct, isolated population clusters in Peloponnese, Phocis, Samos Island, Halkidiki and north-eastern Greece. Currently the largest population cluster is located in Nestos, north-eastern Greece. Although listed as 'vulnerable' in the Red Data Book for Greek Vertebrates, the species has neither been officially declared as a game species nor as a protected one. In Turkey, Romania, the North Black Sea coast, and the Caucasus region, the status of jackals was largely unknown in 2004. There were indications of expanding populations in Romania and the north- western Black Sea coast, and reports of decline in Turkey. Jackal populations have been increasing in Serbia since the late 1970s, and occur mainly in north-eastern Serbia and lower Srem. Jackals are especially common near Negotin and Bela Palanka (close to the border with Bulgaria), where during the 1990s, about 500 specimens were shot. In Croatia, a 2007 survey reported 19 jackal packs in the north-western part of Ravni Kotari and two on Vir Island. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, jackals were a rare species (from 1920 to 1999 only a few observations in the south of the country) but at the beginning of this century their significant presence in the north of the country is an obvious example of expansion of the jackals on the European continent. Jackal populations in Albania however are on the verge of extinction with possible occurrence in only three lowland wetland locations along the Adriatic Sea. Central and western Europe Golden jackals are listed as a protected species in Slovenia, where they were first spotted in 1952 and have also established permanent territories there. In 2005, a probably vagrant female was accidentally shot near Gornji Grad in the Upper Savinja Valley, Northern Slovenia. In 2009, two territorial groups of golden jackal were recorded in the Ljubljana Marshes area, Central Slovenia. It seems that the species continues to expand towards Central Europe. Current range of the golden jackal in Italy (yellow) alongside other indigenous canids. In Italy the species is found in the wild in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol. In the High Adriatic Hinterland, its distribution has been recently updated by Lapini et al. (2009). In 1984 Canis aureus had reached the Province of Belluno, in 1985 a pack reproduced near Udine (this group was eliminated in 1987), a road-killed jackal was collected in Veneto in 1992, and their presence was then confirmed in the Province of Gorizia and in the hinterland of the Gulf of Trieste. In these cases, the specimens were usually roaming male subadults, though a family-group was discovered in Agordino in 1994. A young dead female was discovered on 10 December 2009 in Carnia, indicating that the species' range has continued to expand. Moreover, in the late summer of 2009, the species was also signalled in Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol, where it has likely reached the Puster Valley. The Italian branch of WWF estimates that jackal numbers in Italy may be underestimated. Sciacallo dorato (Canis aureus) . wwf.it The golden jackal is a protected animal in Italy.

There have been records of a presence of golden jackals around Geneva in Switzerland since 2011, a camera trap photographed one in 2018. In 2019 the authorities of the Republic and Canton of Geneva revealed the first video footage of one in Switzerland.https://wilderness-society.org/golden-jackal-shows-up-in-geneva- switzerland/ In Hungary, where in the Hungarian name translates as 'reed wolves', golden jackals had disappeared in the 1950s through hunting and habitat destruction, only to return in the late 1970s, with the first breeding pairs being detected near the southern border in Transdanubia, then between the River Danube and Tisza. Golden jackals have since increased greatly in number year by year, with some estimates indicating that they now outnumber red foxes. The sighting of a jackal near the Austrian border in the summer of 2007 indicated that they have spread throughout the country. There have been repeated sightings of jackals in eastern Austria for a few decades. In 2007 the first reproduction was reported in the national park Neusiedler See ‚Äì Seewinkel. It has since been seen in the western and southern parts of the country, in South Tyrol, Upper Austria, Carinthia and Styria. In 2019 it was spotted for the first time eastern Tyrol.https://wilderness- society.org/golden-jackal-spotted-in-the-austrian-alps/ The presence of the animals in Germany has been confirmed since the very end of the 1990s. As of 2019 they have been sighted almost throughout the country. They are not thought to have been historically present in Germany before, according to experts warm winter weather may be contributing to their expansion into new territory. They have primarily been observed in nature parks. Despite the long presence in the country, jackals are not known to have formed territories, a pack or let alone breed in Germany. The closest known packs are in the Czech Republic and Austria, and it is quite possible vagrant animals are wandering hundreds of kilometres. In Denmark the carcass of a roadkilled golden jackal was discovered in September 2015 near Karup in Central Jutland. In August 2016 a live golden jackal was spotted and photographed in Lille Vildmose. In the Netherlands, presence of a single individual was confirmed through a camera trap at the Veluwe in 2016. Evidence of the presence of the species in this area came again from a camera trap in 2017. An observation in 2018 was revealed to be a marketing stunt.{{cite news|title=De goudjakhals rukt op in Gelderland |date=17 May 2019 |publisher=Omroep Gelderland |url=https://www.omroepgelderland.nl/nieuws/2409048/De-goudjakhals-rukt-op-in- Gelderland-en-hier-gaat-ie-wonen |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 October 2020 The next observation is from 2019 from a camera trap in Drenthe. The jackal in this country is thought to be as a neophyte: it is not known to have ever inhabited the area. A masters' thesis calculated a possible maximum carrying capacity of 5,000 animals in the Netherlands. Another ecologist, Glenn Lelieveld, remarked that the increasing population of wolves in the Netherlands might as yet have unforeseeable effects. He noted it might find more marshy areas to live, or be pushed out of the larger game parks into more agricultural areas. Lelieveld stressed that the species is still officially vagrant in the country. In order to prove if the species had settled in the country, he used microphones and human reports to find the howling sounds of the animals, and would then rush to the location with a megaphone playing back recordings of jackal howls. If the animals are truly settled in an area, they would howl in back at the recordings to mark their territory, but as of 2019 this had never occurred. The presence of the animal has proven much less sensational than the return of the wolf. A golden jackal was photographed in late 2017 in Haute-Savoie, southeastern France. A dead adult was found close to the road near Podol√≠ (Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ District) in the Czech Republic, on 19 March 2006. Golden jackal near Biebrza river valley in north-eastern Poland The species' presence in Poland was confirmed in 2015 through a necropsy on a roadkilled male found in the northwest and camera trapping of two live specimens in the east. Northern Europe In the beginning of the 21st century, an isolated population was confirmed in western Estonia, much further north than their earlier known range. Whether they were an introduced population or came through natural migration was unknown. The Environmental Board of Estonia classified it as an introduced species, and thus potentially subject to extermination campaigns. Amet: ≈°aakalid tuleb eemaldada, EestiP√§evaleht (21 May 2013) However, studies confirmed that animals reached Estonia naturally from Caucasus through Ukraine, which some people take to mean they should not be considered introduced species. They are now treated equally with other hunted animals in Estonia. Ivar Soopan. Jaht L√§√§nemaal ulatuslikult levinud ≈°aakalitele pikeneb kahe kuu v√µrra.

In 2016 jackals killed over 100 sheep in Estonia and during hunting season in winter 2016/2017 32 jackals were killed. Due to quick growth of jackal population in 2017 their hunting season was extended by two months for next year, up to six months in a year. ≈†aakalite jahihooaeg pikenes kahe kuu v√µrra. Postimees, 1 September 2017 Origins and presence in European tradition Although present in Europe, jackals are not commonly featured in European folklore or literature. In the former Greek speaking and writing parts of their distribution in the eastern Mediterranean coast were mentioned under the Greek name thos/Œ∏œâœÇ till the Ottoman arrival and the use of the name tsakali/œÑœÉŒ±Œ∫Œ¨ŒªŒπ (from Turkish √ßakal). Œôn similes in the Iliad (dated around 8th century BC) they are described as tawny coloured, gathering together to stalk animals injured by hunters. When the injured animal collapses the jackals devour it until some lion appears and steals their prey. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in 4th century BC wrote that jackals avoid lions and dogs, but they are friendly to people, not being afraid of them. He also stated that their inner parts are identical to those of the wolf, and that they change appearance from summer to winter. Hesychius of Alexandria (5th - 6th century AD) wrote that the jackal is a beast similar to the wolf.ŒóœÉœçœáŒπŒøœÇ ŒìœÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ŒëŒªŒµŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµœçœÇ 5th - 6th century AD: ŒïŒ•ŒõŒüŒìŒôŒ©Œô Œ§Œ©Œô ŒïŒ§ŒëŒôŒ°Œ©Œô ŒßŒëŒôŒ°ŒïŒôŒù Theodosius the grammarian (8th century AD) wrote that Œ∏œâœÇ is a beast species and that the agile/fast persons are thus called Œ∏ŒøŒøŒØ/thoi.ŒòŒµŒøŒ¥œåœÉŒπŒøœÇ ŒìœÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ŒëŒªŒµŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ≠œâœÇ 8th century AD: ŒïŒπœÉŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ Œ∫Œ±ŒΩœåŒΩŒµœÇ œÄŒµœÅŒØ Œ∫ŒªŒØœÉŒµœâœÇ ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ With the exception of Greece where it was considered among the most common mammals, being a rare and elusive animal, the jackal was historically often assumed to be an introduced animal if it were sighted elsewhere. The population in Dalmatia was formerly believed to be an independent species Canis dalmatinus. It was widely believed by the inhabitants of Korƒçula Island that African jackals were introduced to the island by the Republic of Venice to inflict damage on the Republic of Ragusa. When in 1929 a male jackal appeared on Premuda, the islanders believed that it was brought to the island \\"out of a sheer malice\\". Although this population was initially synonymised with what was once thought to be the North African golden jackal (now recognised as the African Golden wolf), this origin for Dalmatian jackals was later proved unlikely, as their skulls bear less similarities to those canines from North Africa and Ethiopia, than those of the jackals from neighbouring Bosnia or Anatolia. Sir William Jardine thought that jackals were first transported to Europe through the Muslim conquests.Jardine, William (1839). The naturalist's library, Volume 9, published by W.H. Lizars. However, the fossil record indicates that the golden jackal likely colonised the European continent from Asia during the Upper Holocene or late Pleistocene. In 2015, during an attempt to understand the genetic identity of the rapidly expanding jackal populations in Europe, an international team of researchers examined 15 microsatellite markers and a 406 base-pair fragment of the mtDNA control region from the tissue samples of 97 specimens throughout Europe and Asia Minor. The results showed that jackals from Europe have much lower haplotype diversity than those in Israel (where they have admixed with dogs, grey wolves and African wolves), and that they mostly descend from populations originating from the Caucasus. The highest level of haplotype diversity was found in Peloponnesian jackals, which may represent another relict population of Europe's original golden jackals prior to their extirpation elsewhere. Particular attention was paid to the genetics of Baltic jackals, as all Baltic states class the animal as an introduced species, and subject to hunting. It was found that jackals in Estonia originate from the south-eastern European population, whereas those in Lithuania are of Caucasian origin; this was concluded to render the hypothesis of an artificial introduction unlikely, and that their presence in both states was consistent with the natural northward expansion of both southeastern and eastern European populations.Rutkowski R, Krofel M, Giannatos G, ƒÜiroviƒá D, M√§nnil P, Volokh AM, et al. (2015) \\"A European Concern? Genetic Structure and Expansion of Golden Jackals (Canis aureus) in Europe and the Caucasus\\". PLoS ONE 10(11):e0141236. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0141236 Surveys taken in the High Adriatic hinterland indicate that the totality of people with first hand experience of jackals (hunters, game keepers and local people) regularly mistook red foxes affected by sarcoptic mange (or in a problematic state of moult) for golden jackals. The sighting of a true golden jackal however, was always referred to as a wolf, or a little wolf. This was verified both with photo-trapping sessions and with track studies, confirming previous observations on this matter. This erroneous and controversial perception of the golden jackal may be due to the fact that its presence is still not traditional, neither in Italian and Slovenian human culture, nor in hunting and game keeping traditions. Another difficulty for trackers is that unlike a wolf, which defecates in the middle of trails, golden jackals leave their scat under cover of bushes.

Mycoforestry is considered a type of permacultureFriedman, Zev. Digging In. New Life Journal. 1 May 2009. and can be implemented as a beneficial component of an agroforestry system. Mycoforestry can enhance the yields of tree crops and produce edible mushrooms, an economically valuable product. By integrating plant-fungal associations into a forestry management system, native forests can be preserved, wood waste can be recycled back into the ecosystem, planted restoration sites are enhanced, and the sustainability of forest ecosystems are improved. Mycoforestry is an alternative to the practice of clearcutting, which removes dead wood from forests, thereby diminishing nutrient availability and reducing soil depth.Dahlgren, R. A.; Driscoll, C. T. The effects of whole-tree clear-cutting on soil processes at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. Plant and Soil. Volume 158, Number 2 / January 1994. Selection of fungal species According to Paul Stamets, the first principle for the creation of a mycoforestry system is to utilize native fungal species. Implementing a mycoforestry system provides the potential of improving restoration efforts and the possibility of economic gain through mushroom cropping and harvesting. However to utilize native fungal flora, first the relationships between present fungal species and growth substrate, and habitat need to be studied. A simple way to introduce a mycoforestry system and enhance out-plantings for crops and forest restoration sites is to \\"use mycorrhizal spore inoculum when replanting forest lands\\" For this process it is best to match native trees with native mycorrhizal fungi. This method keeps and will promote the functioning of the native ecosystem, and native biodiversity. It is assumed in a functioning forest ecosystem an underground mycelial network persists even if no fruiting bodies are visible.Frankland, Juliet C. All you ever wanted to know about Mycelium. NWFG Newsletter. April 1997. (ISSN 1465-8054) Print. A period of disappearance of mushrooms from an area should not cause alarm. In order to trigger the formation of fruiting bodies, many fungal species require specific environmental conditions. Most species of fungi do not fruit year round. Mycoforestry is an emergent scientific field and practice. Until broadly standardized protocols are created and perfected, the collection of both current and historical ecological site conditions will improve the success of the project. Therefore, a survey of fungal relations at the site under both prime and poor conditions is beneficial to implementation of a mycoforestry system. Saprotrophic fungi Edible oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus sp.) fruiting from a stump The second principle is to promote saprotrophic fungi in the environment. Saprophytic fungi are crucial to mycoforestry systems because these are the primary composers breaking down wood and returning nutrients to the soil for use by the rest of the forest ecosystem. This can be accomplished through inoculation of wood debris at site. Spored oils can be used in chainsaws when problematic or invasive hardwood requires felling. This method is a simple means to inoculate a tree. Additionally plug spawn can be implemented and injected into wood mass again prompting colonization by the selected fungus. Eventually repeated colonization efforts should not be necessary as many fungal life forms are strong and will spread and sustain in the soil on their own. In management of the mycoforestry system it is important that dead wood be in contact with the ground. This allows fungus to reach up from the soil and decompose fallen wood releasing nutrients at a much quicker rate then if the wood is left standing. Additionally it is important to leave dead wood on site for decomposition back into the soil. This philosophy is similarly based to the fact that clear cutting of a forest reduces soil nutrients and thickness. Beneficial fungal interactions Armillaria, a parasitic fungus The third principal is to implement species known to benefit plant species. These are commonly mycorrhizal fungus that form long term associations with plants, often extending inside of plants roots acting as an additional root system providing for better absorption of nutrients and water. Utilizing mushroom species that attract insects could be a useful source of fish food. This practice makes the mycoforestry a larger system. Unlike most agriculture systems it helps the environment in a number of ways. It ties all biological aspects of the environment together, creating sustainable living and food production as well as sustainable fisheries similar to the ancient Hawaiian Ahupua'a, which utilized sustainable all portions of the land for environmental and food security. Additionally fungal species can be implemented that compete with disease causing agents like Armillaria root rots to provide long term protection of the forestry system. Additionally, the implementation of an agroforestry system performs mycoremediation and mycofiltration activities cleaning up toxins and restoring the environment.

Danhauser was invited to a tryout at Wrigley Field in Chicago, and immediately was assigned to the Belles. In addition to baseball and softball, Danhauser had played basketball, bowling and golf as a youth near Racine. She attended St. Joseph School and St. Catherine High School, and played with the local Pugh Coal girls softball team for three years, winning the Wisconsin State Championship in 1936 and 1937. She also worked for Western Printing and Lithographing as a book binder before joining the AAGPBL in its inaugural season. In 1943 the Belles won both the first half of the season and AAGPBL championship. In the best-of-five Series, Racine defeated the Kenosha Comets, winners of the second half, 3 games to 0. The attack was led by slugging right fielder Eleanor Dapkus, who hit a league-lead 10 home runs, while Sophie Kurys, well known for her stunning speed, stole 44 bases and scored 60 runs. The pitching staff was led by Mary Nesbitt (26-11) and Joanne Winter (11-11), while Danhauser, Maddy English, Edythe Perlick and Claire Schillace could be counted on for their bats and solid defense. In 1946, Winter earned 33 victories for only nine losses while pitching 17 shutouts with 183 strikeouts in 46 appearances. The Belles finished first place with a league-best 74‚Äì38 record, won the semifinal round of playoffs by defeating the South Bend Blue Sox in four games, and clinched the AAGPBL crown by defeating the 1945 champions, the Rockford Peaches, four games to two. Throughout the playoffs, Kurys led all players in average, stolen bases and runs. On the other hand, Winter collected four wins in the playoffs, including a 14-inning, 1‚Äì0 shutout victory over the Peaches in decisive Game Six. The winning run was scored by Kurys on an RBI-single by Betty Trezza, while Danhauser handled 22 chances flawlessly. During the season, the Belles again showed a great defense, notably by Danhauser at first, Kurys at second, English at third and Trezza at shortstop, while Irene Hickson caught and Perlick (LF), Schillace (CF) and Dapkus (RF) patrolled the outfield. And moreover, fielding ability and speed on the bases were immensely more crucial and challenging in a dominant pitching league. In 1947 Racine defeated the Muskegon Lassies in the playoffs, three games to one, but lost to the Grand Rapids Chicks in the final Series four games to three. In the 1948 season the team lost the semifinal playoff to the Rockford Peaches, the eventually Championship Team. But after eight successful seasons the Belles lacked the financial resources to keep the club playing in Racine and decided to move to Battle Creek, Michigan for the 1951 season. Then Danhauser, along with Dapkus, English, Hickson, Kurys, Perlick, Schillace and Winter, founding team members, were disappointment with the new location and would not make the move. During eight years, the eight girls were a close-knit unit, always like a family away from home, as they thought that all would be different. Danhauser was a .144 hitter in 728 games. At first base, she committed only 179 errors in 7794 chances for an outstanding .982 fielding average. Following her playing retirement, Danhauser returned to her home town of Racine and married, changing her name to Margaret Danhauser Brown. She died at the age of 65.

It was one of three major branches of Eastern Christianity that arose from the Christological controversies of the 5th and 6th centuries, alongside the Oriental Orthodox churches and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The schism of 1552 gave rise to rival patriarchates, sometimes two, sometimes three. Since the latter half of the 20th century, three churches claim the heritage of the Church of the East. The Church of the East organized itself in 410 as the national church of the Sasanian Empire through the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. In 424 it declared itself independent of the church structure of the Roman Empire. The Church of the East was headed by the Patriarch of the East seated in Seleucia-Ctesiphon, continuing a line that, according to its tradition, stretched back to the Apostolic Age. According to its tradition, the Church of the East was established by Thomas the Apostle in the first century. Its liturgical rite was the East Syrian rite that employs the Divine Liturgy of Saints Addai and Mari. The Church of the East, which was part of the Great Church, shared communion with those in the Roman Empire until the Council of Ephesus condemned Nestorius in 431. Supporters of Nestorius took refuge in the Sasanian Persia, where the Church refused to condemn Nestorius and became accused of Nestorianism, a heresy attributed to Nestorius. It was therefore called the Nestorian Church by all the other eastern churches, both the Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian, and by the Western Church. Politically the Persian and Roman empires were at war with each other, which forced the Church of the East to distance itself from the churches within Roman territory.Procopius, Wars, I.7.1‚Äì2 * Greatrex‚ÄìLieu (2002), II, 62Joshua the Stylite, Chronicle, XLIII * Greatrex‚ÄìLieu (2002), II, 62Procopius, Wars, I.9.24 * Greatrex‚ÄìLieu (2002), II, 77 More recently, the \\"Nestorian\\" appellation has been called \\"a lamentable misnomer\\"Sebastian P.

Continuing as a dhimmi community after the Muslim conquest of Persia (633-654), the Church of the East played a major role in the history of Christianity in Asia. Between the 9th and 14th centuries it represented the world's largest Christian denomination in terms of geographical extent. It established dioceses and communities stretching from the Mediterranean Sea and today's Iraq and Iran, to India (the Saint Thomas Christians), the Mongol kingdoms in Central Asia, and China during the Tang dynasty (7th to 9th centuries). In the 13th and 14th centuries the church experienced a final period of expansion under the Mongol Empire, where influential Church of the East clergy sat in the Mongol court. Even before the Church of the East underwent a rapid decline in its field of expansion in central Asia in the 14th century, it had already lost ground in its home territory. \\"The magnitude of the decline is indicated by the shrinking list of cities in the region [Persia] with resident Church of the East bishops. In the year 1000, 68 cities were on that list. By 1238, there were 24, and, after Timur Leng, there were only 7\\".Douglas Jacobsen.

In the aftermath of the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire, the rising Chinese and Islamic Mongol leaderships pushed out and nearly eradicated the Church of the East and its followers. Thereafter, Church of the East dioceses remained largely confined to Upper Mesopotamia and to the Saint Thomas Christians in the Malabar coast (modern-day Kerala, India). Divisions occurred within the church itself, but by 1830 two unified patriarchates and distinct churches remained: the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church (an Eastern Catholic Church in communion with the Holy See). The Ancient Church of the East split from the Assyrian Church of the East in 1968. In 2017, the Chaldean Catholic Church had approximately 628,405 members, The Eastern Catholic Churches 2017 Retrieved December 2010.

Background  The Church of the East's declaration in 424 of the independence of its head, the Patriarch of the East, preceded by nine years the 431 Council of Ephesus, which condemned Nestorius and declared that Mary, mother of Jesus, can be described as Mother of God. Two of the generally accepted ecumenical councils were held earlier: the First Council of Nicaea, in which a Persian bishop took part, in 325, and the First Council of Constantinople in 381. The Church of the East accepted the teaching of these two councils, but ignored the 431 Council and those that followed, seeing them as concerning only the patriarchates of the Roman Empire (Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem), all of which were for it \\"Western Christianity\\".Wilhelm Baum, Dietmar W. Winkler, The Church of the East: A Concise History (Routledge 2003), pp. 3 and 30 Theologically, the Church of the East adopted a dyophysite doctrine that emphasised the distinctiveness of the divine and the human natures of Jesus. In the 6th century and thereafter, the Church of the East expanded greatly, establishing communities in India (the Saint Thomas Christians), among the Mongols in Central Asia, and in China, which became home to a thriving community under the Tang dynasty from the 7th to the 9th century. At its height, between the 9th and 14th centuries, the Church of the East was the world's largest Christian church in geographical extent, with dioceses stretching from its heartland in Upper Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean Sea and as far afield as China, Mongolia, Central Asia, Anatolia, the Arabian Peninsula and India. From its peak of geographical extent, the church entered a period of rapid decline that began in the 14th century, due largely to outside influences. The Chinese Ming dynasty overthrew the Mongols (1368) and ejected Christians and other foreign influences from China, and many Mongols in Central Asia converted to Islam. The Muslim Turco-Mongol leader Timur (1336‚Äì1405) nearly eradicated the remaining Christians in the Middle East. Nestorian Christianity remained largely confined to communities in Upper Mesopotamia and the Malabar Coast of the Indian subcontinent. In the early modern period, the schism of 1552 led to a series of internal divisions and ultimately to its branching into three separate churches: the Chaldean Catholic Church, in full communion with the Holy See, and the independent Assyrian Church of the East and Ancient Church of the East.  Description as Nestorian  alt= Nestorianism is a Christological doctrine that emphasises the distinction between the human and divine natures of Jesus. It was attributed to Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431, whose doctrine represented the culmination of a philosophical current developed by scholars at the School of Antioch, most notably Nestorius's mentor Theodore of Mopsuestia, and stirred controversy when he publicly challenged the use of the title Theotokos (literally, \\"Bearer of God\\") for Mary, mother of Jesus, suggesting that the title denied Christ's full humanity. He argued that Jesus had two loosely joined natures, the divine Logos and the human Jesus, and proposed Christotokos (literally, \\"Bearer of the Christ\\") as a more suitable alternative title. His statements drew criticism from other prominent churchmen, particularly from Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria, who had a leading part in the Council of Ephesus of 431, which condemned Nestorius for heresy and deposed him as Patriarch. After 431, the state authorities in the Roman Empire suppressed Nestorianism, a reason for Christians under Persian rule to favour it and so allay suspicion that their loyalty lay with the hostile Christian-ruled empire.\\"Nestorius\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 11 November 2018. It was in the aftermath of the slightly later Council of Chalcedon (451) that the Church of the East formulated a distinctive theology. The first such formulation was adopted at the Synod of Beth Lapat in 484. This was developed further in the early seventh century, when in an at first successful war against the Byzantine Empire the Sasanid Persian Empire incorporated broad territories populated by West Syrians, many of whom were supporters of the miaphysite theology of Oriental Orthodoxy which its opponents term \\"Monophysitism\\" (Eutychianism), the theological view most opposed to Nestorianism. These received support from Khosrow II, influenced by his wife Shirin. Drawing inspiration from Theodore of Mopsuestia, Babai the Great (551‚àí628) expounded, especially in his Book of Union, what became the normative Christology of the Church of the East. He affirmed that the two A Syriac term (plural of qnoma) not corresponding precisely to Greek œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ or Œø·ΩêœÉŒØŒ± or ·ΩëœÄœåœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ (see Michael F. Kuhn.

Such a designation is not only discourteous to modern members of this venerable church, but also ‚àí as this paper aims to show ‚àí both inappropriate and misleading\\".  Organisation and structure  At the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410, the Church of the East was declared to have at its head the bishop of the Persian capital Seleucia-Ctesiphon, who in the acts of the council was referred to as the Grand or Major Metropolitan, and who soon afterward was called the Catholicos of the East. Later, the title of Patriarch was used. The Church of the East had, like other churches, an ordained clergy in the three traditional orders of bishop, priest (or presbyter), and deacon. Also like other churches, it had an episcopal polity: organisation by dioceses, each headed by a bishop and made up of several individual parish communities overseen by priests. Dioceses were organised into provinces under the authority of a metropolitan bishop. The office of metropolitan bishop was an important one, coming with additional duties and powers; canonically, only metropolitans could consecrate a patriarch. The Patriarch also has the charge of the Province of the Patriarch. For most of its history the church had six or so Interior Provinces. In 410, these were listed in the hierarchical order of: Seleucia-Ctesiphon (central Iraq), Beth Lapat (western Iran), Nisibis (on the border between Turkey and Iraq), Prat de Maishan (Basra, southern Iraq), Arbela (Erbil, Turkestan region of Iraq), and Karka de Beth Slokh (Kirkuk, northeastern Iraq). In addition it had an increasing number of Exterior Provinces further afield within the Sasanian Empire and soon also beyond the empire's borders. By the 10th century, the church had between 20\\"Nestorian\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved January 28, 2010. and 30 metropolitan provinces According to John Foster, in the 9th century there were 25 metropolitans including in China and India. The Chinese provinces were lost in the 11th century, and in the subsequent centuries, other exterior provinces went into decline as well. However, in the 13th century, during the Mongol Empire, the church added two new metropolitan provinces in North China, Tangut and Katai and Ong.  Scriptures  The Peshitta, in some cases lightly revised and with missing books added, is the standard Syriac Bible for churches in the Syriac tradition: the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syrian Catholic Church, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Maronites, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. The Old Testament of the Peshitta was translated from Hebrew, although the date and circumstances of this are not entirely clear. The translators may have been Syriac-speaking Jews or early Jewish converts to Christianity. The translation may have been done separately for different texts, and the whole work was probably done by the second century. Most of the deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament are found in the Syriac, and the Wisdom of Sirach is held to have been translated from the Hebrew and not from the Septuagint.Syriac Versions of the Bible by Thomas Nicol The New Testament of the Peshitta, which originally excluded certain disputed books (Second Epistle of Peter, Second Epistle of John, Third Epistle of John, Epistle of Jude, Book of Revelation), had become the standard by the early 5th century.  Iconography It was often said in the 19th century that the Church of the East was opposed to religious images of any kind. The cult of the image was never as strong in the Syriac Churches as it was in the Byzantine Church, but they were indeed present in the tradition of the Church of the East. Opposition to religious images eventually became the norm due to the rise of Islam in the region, which forbade any type of depictions of Saints and biblical prophets. As such, the Church was forced to get rid of icons. There is both literary and archaeological evidence for the presence of images in the church. Writing in 1248 from Samarkand, an Armenian official records visiting a local church and seeing an image of Christ and the Magi. John of Cora (), Latin bishop of Sultaniya in Persia, writing about 1330 of the East Syrians in Khanbaliq says that they had ‚Äòvery beautiful and orderly churches with crosses and images in honour of God and of the saints‚Äô. Apart from the references, there is a painting of a Nestorian Christian figure which was discovered by Aurel Stein at the Library Cave of the Mo-kao Caves in 1908, which is probably an image of Christ. An illustrated 13th-century Nestorian Peshitta Gospel book written in Estrangela from northern Mesopotamia or Tur Abdin, currently in the State Library of Berlin, proves that in the 13th century the Church of the East was not yet aniconic. Another Nestorian Gospel manuscript preserved in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France contains an illustration that depicts Jesus Christ in the circle of a ringed cross surrounded by four angels. Three Syriac manuscripts from early 19th century or earlier‚Äîthey were published in a compilation titled The Book of Protection by Hermann Gollancz in 1912‚Äîcontain some illustrations of no great artistic worth that show that use of images continued. A life-size male stucco figure discovered in a late-6th-century church in Seleucia-Ctesiphon, beneath which were found the remains of an earlier church, also shows that the Church of the East used figurative representations.

It was probably made in and for a Sogdian Nestorian Christian community located in Semirechye Early history Although the Nestorian community traced their history to the 1st century AD, the Church of the East first achieved official state recognition from the Sasanian Empire in the 4th century with the accession of Yazdegerd I (reigned 399‚Äì420) to the throne of the Sasanian Empire. In 410 the Synod of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, held at the Sasanian capital, allowed the church's leading bishops to elect a formal Catholicos (leader). Catholicos Isaac was required both to lead the Assyrian Christian community and to answer on its behalf to the Sasanian emperor. Under pressure from the Sasanian Emperor, the Church of the East sought to increasingly distance itself from the Greek Orthodox Church (at the time being known as the church of the Eastern Roman Empire). Therefore, in 424, the bishops of the Sasanian Empire met in council under the leadership of Catholicos Dadisho ø (421‚Äì456) and determined that they would not, henceforth, refer disciplinary or theological problems to any external power, and especially not to any bishop or church council in the Roman Empire. Thus, the Mesopotamian churches did not send representatives to the various church councils attended by representatives of the \\"Western Church\\". Accordingly, the leaders of the Church of the East did not feel bound by any decisions of what came to be regarded as Roman Imperial Councils. Despite this, the Creed and Canons of the First Council of Nicaea of 325, affirming the full divinity of Christ, were formally accepted at the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410. The church's understanding of the term hypostasis differs from the definition of the term offered at the Council of Chalcedon of 451. For this reason, the Assyrian Church has never approved the Chalcedonian definition. The theological controversy that followed the Council of Ephesus in 431 proved a turning point in the Christian Church's history. The Council condemned as heretical the Christology of Nestorius, whose reluctance to accord the Virgin Mary the title Theotokos \\"God-bearer, Mother of God\\" was taken as evidence that he believed two separate persons (as opposed to two united natures) to be present within Christ. (For the theological issues at stake, see Assyrian Church of the East and Nestorianism.) The Sasanian Emperor, hostile to the Byzantines, saw the opportunity to ensure the loyalty of his Christian subjects and lent support to the Nestorian Schism. The Emperor took steps to cement the primacy of the Nestorian party within the Assyrian Church of the East, granting its members his protection, and executing the pro-Roman Catholicos Babowai in 484, replacing him with the Nestorian Bishop of Nisibis, Barsauma. The Catholicos-Patriarch Babai (497‚Äì503) confirmed the association of the Assyrian Church with Nestorianism. Parthian and Sasanian periods Christians were already forming communities in Mesopotamia as early as the 1st century under the Parthian Empire. In 266, the area was annexed by the Sasanian Empire (becoming the province of As≈çristƒÅn), and there were significant Christian communities in Upper Mesopotamia, Elam, and Fars. The Church of the East traced its origins ultimately to the evangelical activity of Thaddeus of Edessa, Mari and Thomas the Apostle. Leadership and structure remained disorganised until 315 when Papa bar Aggai (310‚Äì329), bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, imposed the primacy of his see over the other Mesopotamian and Persian bishoprics which were grouped together under the Catholicate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon; Papa took the title of Catholicos of the East, or universal leader.Ilaria Ramelli, ‚ÄúPapa bar Aggai‚Äù, in Encyclopedia of Ancient Christianity, 2nd edn., 3 vols., ed. Angelo Di Berardino (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2014), 3:47. This position received an additional title in 410, becoming Catholicos and Patriarch of the East. These early Christian communities in Mesopotamia, Elam, and Fars were reinforced in the 4th and 5th centuries by large-scale deportations of Christians from the eastern Roman Empire. However, the Persian Church faced several severe persecutions, notably during the reign of Shapur II (339‚Äì79), from the Zoroastrian majority who accused it of Roman leanings. Shapur II attempted to dismantle the catholicate's structure and put to death some of the clergy including the catholicoi Simeon bar Sabba'e (341), Shahdost (342), and Barba'shmin (346).Donald Attwater & Catherine Rachel John, The Penguin Dictionary of Saints, 3rd edn. (New York: Penguin Books, 1993), 116, 245. Afterward, the office of Catholicos lay vacant nearly 20 years (346‚Äì363). In 363, under the terms of a peace treaty, Nisibis was ceded to the Persians, causing Ephrem the Syrian, accompanied by a number of teachers, to leave the School of Nisibis for Edessa still in Roman territory. The church grew considerably during the Sasanian period, but the pressure of persecution led the Catholicos Dadisho I in 424 to convene the Synod of Markabta at Seleucia and declare the Catholicate independent from \\"the western Fathers\\". Meanwhile, in the Roman Empire, the Nestorian Schism had led many of Nestorius' supporters to relocate to the Sasanian Empire, mainly around the theological School of Nisibis. The Persian Church increasingly aligned itself with the Nestorians, a measure encouraged by the Zoroastrian ruling class. The church became increasingly Nestorian in doctrine over the next decades, furthering the divide between Roman and Nestorian Christianity. In 484 the Metropolitan of Nisibis, Barsauma, convened the Synod of Beth Lapat where he publicly accepted Nestorius' mentor, Theodore of Mopsuestia, as a spiritual authority. In 489, when the School of Edessa in Mesopotamia was closed by Byzantine Emperor Zeno for its Nestorian teachings, the school relocated to its original home of Nisibis, becoming again the School of Nisibis, leading to a wave of Nestorian immigration into the Sasanian Empire. The Patriarch of the East Mar Babai I (497‚Äì502) reiterated and expanded upon his predecessors' esteem for Theodore, solidifying the church's adoption of Nestorianism. Assyrian village of Geramon. Now firmly established in the Persian Empire, with centres in Nisibis, Ctesiphon, and Gundeshapur, and several metropolitan sees, the Church of the East began to branch out beyond the Sasanian Empire. However, through the 6th century the church was frequently beset with internal strife and persecution from the Zoroastrians. The infighting led to a schism, which lasted from 521 until around 539, when the issues were resolved. However, immediately afterward Byzantine-Persian conflict led to a renewed persecution of the church by the Sasanian emperor Khosrau I; this ended in 545. The church survived these trials under the guidance of Patriarch Aba I, who had converted to Christianity from Zoroastrianism. By the end of the 5th century and the middle of the 6th, the area occupied by the Church of the East included \\"all the countries to the east and those immediately to the west of the Euphrates\\", including the Sasanian Empire, the Arabian Peninsula, Socotra, Mesopotamia, Media, Bactria, Hyrcania, and India; and possibly also to places called Calliana, Male, and Sielediva (Ceylon). Beneath the Patriarch in the hierarchy were nine metropolitans, and clergy were recorded among the Huns, in Persarmenia, Media, and the island of Dioscoris in the Indian Ocean. The Church of the East also flourished in the kingdom of the Lakhmids until the Islamic conquest, particularly after the ruler al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir officially converted in c. 592.

After the Sasanian Empire was conquered by Muslim Arabs in 644, the newly established Rashidun Caliphate designated the Church of the East as an official dhimmi minority group headed by the Patriarch of the East. As with all other Christian and Jewish groups given the same status, the church was restricted within the Caliphate, but also given a degree of protection. Nestorians were not permitted to proselytise or attempt to convert Muslims, but their missionaries were otherwise given a free hand, and they increased missionary efforts farther afield. Missionaries established dioceses in India (the Saint Thomas Christians). They made some advances in Egypt, despite the strong Monophysite presence there, and they entered Central Asia, where they had significant success converting local Tartars. Nestorian missionaries were firmly established in China during the early part of the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907); the Chinese source known as the Nestorian Stele describes a mission under a proselyte named Alopen as introducing Nestorian Christianity to China in 635. In the 7th century, the church had grown to have two Nestorian archbishops, and over 20 bishops east of the Iranian border of the Oxus River. Patriarch Timothy I (780‚Äì823), a contemporary of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid, took a particularly keen interest in the missionary expansion of the Church of the East. He is known to have consecrated metropolitans for Damascus, for Armenia, for Dailam and Gilan in Azerbaijan, for Rai in Tabaristan, for Sarbaz in Segestan, for the Turks of Central Asia, for China, and possibly also for Tibet. He also detached India from the metropolitan province of Fars and made it a separate metropolitan province, known as India. By the 10th century the Church of the East had a number of dioceses stretching from across the Caliphate's territories to India and China. Nestorian Christians made substantial contributions to the Islamic Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, particularly in translating the works of the ancient Greek philosophers to Syriac and Arabic. Nestorians made their own contributions to philosophy, science (such as Hunayn ibn Ishaq, Qusta ibn Luqa, Masawaiyh, Patriarch Eutychius, Jabril ibn Bukhtishu) and theology (such as Tatian, Bar Daisan, Babai the Great, Nestorius, Toma bar Yacoub). The personal physicians of the Abbasid Caliphs were often Assyrian Christians such as the long serving Bukhtishu dynasty.R√©mi Brague, Assyrians contributions to the Islamic civilizationBritannica, Nestorian Expansion Church of the East at its largest extent during the Middle Ages. After the split with the Western World and synthesis with Nestorianism, the Church of the East expanded rapidly due to missionary works during the medieval period. During the period between 500 and 1400 the geographical horizon of the Church of the East extended well beyond its heartland in present-day northern Iraq, north eastern Syria and south eastern Turkey. Communities sprang up throughout Central Asia, and missionaries from Assyria and Mesopotamia took the Christian faith as far as China, with a primary indicator of their missionary work being the Nestorian Stele, a Christian tablet written in Chinese script found in China dating to 781 AD. Their most important conversion, however, was of the Saint Thomas Christians of the Malabar Coast in India, who alone escaped the destruction of the church by Timur at the end of the 14th century, and the majority of whom today constitute the largest group who now use the liturgy of the Church of the East, with around 4 million followers in their homeland, in spite of the 17th-century defection to the West Syriac Rite of the Syriac Orthodox Church.Ronald G. Roberson, \\"The Syro-Malabar Catholic Church\\" The St Thomas Christians were believed by tradition to have been converted by St Thomas, and were in communion with the Church of the East until the end of the medieval period. India The Saint Thomas Christian community of Kerala, India, who according to tradition trace their origins to the evangelizing efforts of Thomas the Apostle, had a long association with the Church of the East. The earliest known organised Christian presence in Kerala dates to 295/300 when Nestorian Christian settlers and missionaries from Persia headed by Bishop David of Basra settled in the region. The Saint Thomas Christians traditionally credit the mission of Thomas of Cana, a Nestorian from the Middle East, with the further expansion of their community. From at least the early 4th century, the Patriarch of the Church of the East provided the Saint Thomas Christians with clergy, holy texts, and ecclesiastical infrastructure. And around 650 Patriarch Ishoyahb III solidified the church's jurisdiction in India. In the 8th century Patriarch Timothy I organised the community as the Ecclesiastical Province of India, one of the church's Provinces of the Exterior. After this point the Province of India was headed by a metropolitan bishop, provided from Persia, who oversaw a varying number of bishops as well as a native Archdeacon, who had authority over the clergy and also wielded a great amount of secular power. The metropolitan see was probably in Cranganore, or (perhaps nominally) in Mylapore, where the Shrine of Thomas was located. In the 12th century Indian Nestorianism engaged the Western imagination in the figure of Prester John, supposedly a Nestorian ruler of India who held the offices of both king and priest. The geographically remote Malabar Church survived the decay of the Nestorian hierarchy elsewhere, enduring until the 16th century when the Portuguese arrived in India. The Portuguese at first accepted the Nestorian sect, but by the end of the century they had determined to actively bring the Saint Thomas Christians into full communion with Rome under the Latin Rite. They installed Portuguese bishops over the local sees and made liturgical changes to accord with the Latin practice. In 1599 the Synod of Diamper, overseen by Aleixo de Menezes, Archbishop of Goa, led to a revolt among the Saint Thomas Christians. The majority of them broke with the Catholic Church and vowed never to submit to the Portuguese in the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653. In 1661 Pope Alexander VII responded by sending a delegation of Carmelites headed by Chaldean Catholics to re-establish the East Syriac rites under an Eastern Catholic hierarchy. By the next year, 84 of the 116 communities had returned, forming the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. The rest, which became known as the Malankara Church, soon entered into communion with the Syriac Orthodox Church. The Malankara Church also produced the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. China The Nestorian Stele, created in 781, describes the introduction of Nestorian Christianity to China Christianity reached China by 635, and its relics can still be seen in Chinese cities such as Xi'an. The Nestorian Stele, set up on 7 January 781 at the then-capital of Chang'an, attributes the introduction of Christianity to a mission under a Persian cleric named Alopen in 635, in the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang during the Tang dynasty. The inscription on the Nestorian Stele, whose dating formula mentions the patriarch Hnanisho II (773‚Äì80), gives the names of several prominent Christians in China, including Metropolitan Adam, Bishop Yohannan, 'country-bishops' Yazdbuzid and Sargis and Archdeacons Gigoi of Khumdan (Chang'an) and Gabriel of Sarag (Loyang). The names of around seventy monks are also listed. Nestorian Christianity thrived in China for approximately 200 years, but then faced persecution from Emperor Wuzong of Tang (reigned 840‚Äì846). He suppressed all foreign religions, including Buddhism and Christianity, causing the church to decline sharply in China. A Syrian monk visiting China a few decades later described many churches in ruin. The church disappeared from China in the early 10th century, coinciding with the collapse of the Tang dynasty and the tumult of the next years (the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period). Christianity in China experienced a significant revival during the Mongol-created Yuan dynasty, established after the Mongols had conquered China in the 13th century. Marco Polo in the 13th century and other medieval Western writers described many Nestorian communities remaining in China and Mongolia; however, they clearly were not as vibrant as they had been during Tang times. Mongolia and Central Asia Mongol tribes that adopted Syriac Christianity ca. 600 ‚Äì 1400 The Church of the East enjoyed a final period of expansion under the Mongols. Several Mongol tribes had already been converted by Nestorian missionaries in the 7th century, and Christianity was therefore a major influence in the Mongol Empire. Genghis Khan was a shamanist, but his sons took Christian wives from the powerful Kerait clan, as did their sons in turn. During the rule of Genghis's grandson, the Great Khan Mongke, Nestorian Christianity was the primary religious influence in the Empire, and this also carried over to Mongol-controlled China, during the Yuan Dynasty. It was at this point, in the late 13th century, that the Church of the East reached its greatest geographical reach. But Mongol power was already waning as the Empire dissolved into civil war; and it reached a turning point in 1295, when Ghazan, the Mongol ruler of the Ilkhanate, made a formal conversion to Islam when he took the throne. Jerusalem and Cyprus Rabban Bar Sauma had initially conceived of his journey to the West as a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, so it is possible that there was a Nestorian presence in the city ca.1300. There was certainly a recognisable Nestorian presence at the Holy Sepulchre from the years 1348 through 1575, as contemporary Franciscan accounts indicate. At Famagusta, Cyprus, a Nestorian community was established just before 1300, and a church was built for them ca.1339. Decline The expansion was followed by a decline. There were 68 cities with resident Church of the East bishops in the year 1000; in 1238 there were only 24, and at the death of Timur in 1405, only seven. The result of some 20 years under √ñljait√º, ruler of the Ilkhanate from 1304 to 1316, and to a lesser extent under his predecessor, was that \\"the church hierarchy had been crushed and most Church of the East buildings had been reduced to rubble\\".Douglas Jacobsen, The World's Christians: Who they are, Where they are, and How they got there (John Wiley & Sons 2011) When Timur, the Turco-Mongol leader of the Timurid Empire, known also as Tamerlane, came to power in 1370, he set out to cleanse his dominions of non-Muslims. He annihilated Christianity in central Asia.Peter C. Phan, Christianities in Asia (John Wiley & Sons 2011), p. 243 The Church of the East \\"lived on only in the mountains of Kurdistan and in India\\".Wilhelm Baum, Dietmar W. Winkler, The Church of the East: A Concise History (Routledge 2003), p. 105 Thus, except for the Saint Thomas Christians on the Malabar Coast, the Church of the East was confined to the area in and around the rough triangle formed by Mosul and Lakes Van and Urmia, including Amid (modern Diyarbakƒ±r), M√™rd√Æn (modern Mardin) and Edessa to the west, Salmas to the east, Hakkari and Harran to the north, and Mosul, Kirkuk, and Arbela (modern Erbil) to the south - a region comprising, in modern maps, northern Iraq, southeast Turkey, northeast Syria and the northwestern fringe of Iran. Small Nestorian communities were located further west, notably in Jerusalem and Cyprus, but the Malabar Christians of India represented the only significant survival of the once-thriving exterior provinces of the Church of the East. The complete disappearance of the Nestorian dioceses in Central Asia probably stemmed from a combination of persecution, disease, and isolation: \\"what survived the Mongols did not survive the Black Death of the fourteenth century.\\" In many parts of Central Asia, Christianity had died out decades before Timur's campaigns. The surviving evidence from Central Asia, including a large number of dated graves, indicates that the crisis for the Church of the East occurred in the 1340s rather than the 1390s. Several contemporary observers, including the Papal Envoy Giovanni de' Marignolli, mention the murder of a Latin bishop in 1339 or 1340 by a Muslim mob in Almaliq, the chief city of Tangut, and the forcible conversion of the city's Christians to Islam. Tombstones in two East Syriac cemeteries in Mongolia have been dated from 1342, some commemorating deaths during a Black Death outbreak in 1338. In China, the last references to Nestorian and Latin Christians date from the 1350s, shortly before the replacement in 1368 of the Mongol Yuan dynasty with the xenophobic Ming dynasty and the consequent cutting off of China from the West.Wilhelm Baum, Dietmar W. Winkler, The Church of the East: A Concise History (Routledge 2003), p. 104 Schisms From the middle of the 16th century, and throughout following two centuries, the Church of the East was affected by several internal schisms. Some of those schisms were caused by individuals or groups who chose to accept union with the Catholic Church. Other schisms were provoked by rivalry between various fractions within the Church of the East. Lack of internal unity and frequent change of allegiances led to the creation and continuation of separate patriarchal lines. In spite of many internal challenges, and external difficulties (political oppression by Ottoman authorities and frequent persecutions by local non-Christians), the traditional branches of the Church of the East managed to survive that tumultuous period and eventually consolidate during the 19th century in the form of the Assyrian Church of the East. At the same time, after many similar difficulties, groups united with the Catholic Church were finally consolidated into the Chaldean Catholic Church Schism of 1552 Around the middle of the fifteenth century Patriarch Shemon IV Basidi made the patriarchal succession hereditarynormally from uncle to nephew. This practice, which resulted in a shortage of eligible heirs, eventually led to a schism in the Church of the East, creating a temporarily Catholic offshoot known as the Shimun line. The Patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb (1539‚Äì58) caused great turmoil at the beginning of his reign by designating his twelve-year-old nephew Khnanisho as his successor, presumably because no older relatives were available. Several years later, probably because Khnanisho had died in the interim, he designated as successor his fifteen-year-old brother Eliya, the future Patriarch Eliya (VI) VII (1558‚Äì91). These appointments, combined with other accusations of impropriety, caused discontent throughout the church, and by 1552 Shemon VII Ishoyahb had become so unpopular that a group of bishops, principally from the Amid, Sirt and Salmas districts in northern Mesopotamia, chose a new patriarch. They elected a monk named Yohannan Sulaqa, the former superior of Rabban Hormizd Monastery near Alqosh, which was the seat of the incumbent patriarchs; however, no bishop of metropolitan rank was available to consecrate him, as canonically required. Franciscan missionaries were already at work among the Nestorians, and, using them as intermediaries, Sulaqa's supporters sought to legitimise their position by seeking their candidate's consecration by Pope Julius III (1550‚Äì5). Sulaqa went to Rome, arriving on 18 November 1552, and presented a letter, drafted by his supporters in Mosul, setting out his claim and asking that the Pope consecrate him as Patriarch. On 15 February 1553 he made a twice-revised profession of faith judged to be satisfactory, and by the bull Divina Disponente Clementia of 20 February 1553 was appointed \\"Patriarch of Mosul in Eastern Syria\\"Patriarcha de Mozal in Syria orientali (Anton Baumstark (editor), Oriens Christianus, IV:1, Rome and Leipzig 2004, p. 277) or \\"Patriarch of the Church of the Chaldeans of Mosul\\".Chaldaeorum ecclesiae Musal Patriarcha (Giuseppe Simone Assemani (editor), Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino-Vaticana (Rome 1725), vol. 3, part 1, p. 661) He was consecrated bishop in St. Peter's Basilica on 9 April. On 28 April Pope Julius III gave him the pallium conferring patriarchal rank, confirmed with the bull Cum Nos Nuper. These events, in which Rome was led to believe that Shemon VII Ishoyahb was dead, created within the Church of the East a lasting schism between the Eliya line of Patriarchs at Alqosh and the new line originating from Sulaqa. The latter was for half a century recognised by Rome as being in communion, but that reverted to both hereditary succession and Nestorianism and has continued in the Patriarchs of the Assyrian Church of the East.Robert J. Wilkinson, Orientalism, Aramaic, and Kabbalah in the Catholic Reformation (BRILL 2007), pp. 86‚àí88 Sulaqa left Rome in early July and in Constantinople applied for civil recognition. After his return to Mesopotamia, he received from the Ottoman authorities in December 1553 recognition as head of \\"the Chaldean nation after the example of all the Patriarchs\\". In the following year, during a five-month stay in Amid (Diyarbakƒ±r), he consecrated two metropolitans and three other bishopsFernando Filoni, The Church in Iraq CUA Press 2017), pp. 35‚àí36 (for Gazarta, Hesna d'Kifa, Amid, Mardin and Seert). For his part, Shemon VII Ishoyahb of the Alqosh line consecrated two more underage members of his patriarchal family as metropolitans (for Nisibis and Gazarta). He also won over the governor of Amadiya, who invited Sulaqa to Amadiya, imprisoned him for four months, and put him to death in January 1555. The Eliya and Shimun lines This new Catholic line founded by Sulaqa maintained its seat at Amid and is known as the \\"Shimun\\" line. Wilmshurst suggests that their adoption of the name Shimun (after Simon Peter) was meant to point to the legitimacy of their Catholic line. Sulaqa's successor, Abdisho IV Maron (1555-1570) visited Rome and his Patriarchal title was confirmed by the Pope in 1562. At some point, he moved to Seert. The Eliya Patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb (1539‚Äì58), who resided in the Rabban Hormizd Monastery near Alqosh, continued to actively oppose union with Rome, and was succeeded by his nephew Eliya (designated as Eliya \\"VII\\" in older historiography, but renumbered as Eliya \\"VI\\" in recent scholarly works). During his Patriarchal tenure, from 1558 to 1591, the Church of the East preserved its traditional christology and full ecclesiastical independence. The next Shimun Patriarch was likely Yahballaha IV, who was elected in 1577 or 1578 and died within two years before seeking or obtaining confirmation from Rome. According to Tisserant, problems posed by the \\"Nestorian\\" traditionalists and the Ottoman authorities prevented any earlier election of a successor to Abdisho.Eug√®ne Tisserant, N√©storienne (L'Eglise), in Dictionnaire de Th√©ologie Catholique, vol, XI, part 1, Paris 1931, col. 230] David Wilmshurst and Murre-Vandenberg believe that, in the period between 1570 and the patriarchal election of Yahballaha, he or another of the same name was looked on as Patriarch.Heleen H.L. Murre-Vandenberg, The Patriarchs of the Church of the East from the Fifteenth to Eighteenth Centuries, in Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies, Vol. 2.2 (1999 [2010]), pp. 252-253 Yahballaha's successor, Shimun IX Dinkha (1580-1600), who moved away from Turkish rule to Salmas on Lake Urmia in Persia, was officially confirmed by the Pope in 1584. There are theories that he appointed his nephew, Shimun X Eliyah (1600-1638) as his successor, but others argue that his election was independent of any such designation. Regardless, from then until the 21st century the Shimun line employed a hereditary system of succession - the rejection of which was part of the reason for the creation of that line in the first place.  Two Nestorian patriarchs  The next Eliya Patriarch, Eliya (VII) VIII (1591‚Äì1617), negotiated on several occasions with the Catholic Church, in 1605, 1610 and 1615-1616, but without final resolution. This likely alarmed Shimun X, who in 1616 sent to Rome a profession of faith that Rome found unsatisfactory, and another in 1619, which also failed to win him official recognition. Wilmshurst says it was this Shimun Patriarch who reverted to the \\"old faith\\" of Nestorianism, leading to a shift in allegiances that won for the Eliya line control of the lowlands and of the highlands for the Shimun line. Further negotiations between the Eliya line and the Catholic Church were cancelled during the Patriarchal tenure of Eliya (VIII) IX (1617‚Äì1660). The next two Shimun Patriarchs, Shimun XI Eshuyow (1638-1656) and Shimun XII Yoalaha (1656‚Äì1662), wrote to the Pope in 1653 and 1658, according to Wilmshurst, while Murre-Vanderberg speaks only of 1648 and 1653. Wilmshurst says Shimun XI was sent the pallium, though Murre-Vanderberg argues official recognition was given to neither. A letter suggests that one of the two was removed from office (presumably by Nestorian traditionalists) for pro-Catholic leanings: Shimun XI according to Murre-Vanderberg, probably Shimun XII according to Wilmshurst. Eliya (IX) X (1660‚Äì1700) was a \\"vigorous defender of the traditional [Nestorian] faith\\", and simultaneously the next Shimun Patriarch, Shimun XIII Dinkha (1662-1700), definitively broke with the Catholic Church. In 1670, he gave a traditionalist reply to an approach that was made from Rome, and by 1672 all connections with the Pope were ended. There were then two traditionalist Patriarchal lines, the senior Eliya line in Alqosh, and the junior Shimun line in Qochanis.  The Josephite line  As the Shimun line \\"gradually returned to the traditional worship of the Church of the East, thereby losing the allegiance of the western regions\\", it moved from Turkish-controlled territory to Urmia in Persia. The bishopric of Amid (Diyarbakƒ±r), the original headquarters of Shimun Sulaqa, became subject to the Alqosh Patriarch. In 1667 or 1668, Bishop Joseph of that see converted to the Catholic faith. In 1677, he obtained from the Turkish authorities recognition as holding independent power in Amid and Mardin, and in 1681 he was recognised by Rome as \\"Patriarch of the Chaldean nation deprived of its Patriarch\\" (Amid patriarchate). Thus was instituted the Josephite line, a third line of Patriarchs and the sole Catholic one at the time. All Joseph I's successors took the name \\"Joseph\\". The life of this Patriarchate was difficult: the leadership was continually vexed by traditionalists, while the community struggled under the tax burden imposed by the Ottoman authorities. In 1771, Eliya (XI) XII and his designated successor (the future Eliya (XII) XIII Ishoyahb) made a profession of faith that was accepted by Rome, thus establishing communion. By then, acceptance of the Catholic position was general in the Mosul area. When Eliya (XI) XII died in 1778, Eliya (XII) XIII made a renewed profession of Catholic faith and was recognised by Rome as Patriarch of Mosul, but in May 1779 renounced that profession in favor of the traditional Nestorianism. His younger cousin Yohannan Hormizd was locally elected to replace him in 1780, but for various reasons was recognised by Rome only as Metropolitan of Mosul and Administrator of the Catholics of the Alqosh party, having the powers of a Patriarch but not the title or insignia. When Joseph IV of the Amid Patriarchate resigned in 1780, Rome likewise made his nephew, Augustine Hindi, whom he wished to be his successor, not Patriarch but Administrator. No one held the title of Chaldean Catholic patriarch for the next 47 years.  Consolidation of patriarchal lines  When Eliya (XII) XIII died in 1804, the Nestorian branch of the Eliya line died with him. With most of his subjects won over to union with Rome by Hormizd, they did not elect a new traditionalist Patriarch. In 1830, Hormizd was finally recognized as the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch of Babylon, marking the last remnant of the hereditary system within the Chaldean Catholic Church. This also ended the rivalry between the senior Eliya line and the junior Shimun line, as Shimun XVI Yohannan (1780-1820) became the sole primate of the traditionalist Church of the East, \\"the legal successor of the initially Uniate patriarchate of the [Shimun] line\\".

Its vernacular name in China is Áæé‰∏ΩËäçËçØ (mei li shao yao) meaning \\"beautiful peony\\". The plant may be between 45‚Äì100 cm high and has mostly rose-pink flowers of about 10 cm across, one on each stem. P. mairei blooms in early spring.  Description  Paeonia mairei is a perennial herbaceous plant of up to 1 m high, that dies down in the autumn, and overwinters with buds just under the surface of the soil. It has thick roots that become thinner towards their tips, while the rootstocks is approximately 2 cm in diameter. Young shoots and leaves are initially red-purple to pink. The stems and leaves are hairless. The largest leaves, near the base of the stem are split into three, which parts themselves are split into leaflets, some of which may be incised, up to nineteen in total, 6‚Äî16¬Ω √ó 1¬æ‚Äî7 cm, gradually broadening at their base and usually pointy at their tip. Veins are deeply sunken on the top-side of the leaf. Each stem bears only one flower at its tip of between 7¬Ω and 14 cm wide. Each flower is accompanied by one to three leaflike or linear bracts of up to 9 cm long. Each flower has three to five, green and broadly oval sepals of 1‚Äî1¬Ω √ó ‚Öû‚Äî1¬º cm. The seven to nine, inverted egg-shaped, pink to Spanish carmine petals are 3¬Ω‚Äî7 √ó 2‚Äî4¬Ω cm, with a usually rounded tip. Within the circle of petals is a circle of stamens that consist of purple-red filaments topped by yellow anthers. Within is a low, yellow, ring-shaped disc, that encircles the base of the two or three carpels, which may be sparsely to densely covered in short yellow or golden brown felty hairs, or rarely hairless. Those are topped by styles of up to 4 mm long, that have red stigmas. Each carpel develops into a dry fruit that opens with a suture (or follicle) of 3‚Äî3¬Ω √ó 1‚Äî1¬º cm. The inside of the fruit is bright red which contrast well with the blue shiny seeds. This peony species in his native range flowers in April and May, and produces seed in August. Paeonia mairei has both diploid and tetraploid populations (2n=10, 4n=20).  Taxonomy  With all Eurasian herbaceous peonies species, Paeonia mairei belongs to the section Paeonia. The taxonomy of this group of peonies is complicated due to reticulate evolution. In the most recent revision of the genus, it is assigned to the subsection Foliatae with P. algeriensis, P. broteri, P. cambessedesii, P. clusii, P. coriacea, P. corsica, P. daurica, P. kesrouanensis, P. mascula and P. obovata. Paeonia russi is the tetraploid hybrid of diploid P. lactiflora and P. mairei. Paeonia banatica is the tetraploid hybrid of P. mairei and either P. arietina, P. humilis, P. officinalis, P. parnassica or less likely P. tenuifolia, or one of their (now extinct) common ancestors.  Etymology  Paeonia mairei was named in honor of the French missionary P√®re Edouard-Ernest Maire who discovered the plant for western science in 1913 in northeastern Yunnan.  Distribution and ecology  Paeonia mairei can be found in deciduous broad-leaved forests on lime, between 1500 and 2700 m altitude, but is reported to been found as high as 3200 m when discovered by P√®re Maire. It grows naturally in southeastern Gansu, northwestern Guizhou, southwestern Hubei, southern Shaanxi, central and Southern Sichuan, and northeastern Yunnan.  Cultivation  Paeonia mairei has only recently become available as an ornamental outside of China. It is reported to be the first of the herbaceous peonies to bloom, and recover well from morning frost. It does not take full sun well, but needs enough light.

It grows in the wild in southeastern Tibet. This peony is very rare in cultivation. It produces blue seeds in autumn.Peonies: The Imperial Flower by Jane Fearnley- Whittingstall Its common name in Chinese is ÁôΩËä±ËäçËçØ (bai hua shao yao), which means \\"white peony\\".  Description  Paeonia sterniana is a hairless perennial herbaceous plant of up to 90 cm high, with leaves alternately set along the stems, which flowers in it home range in May, while the seeds are ripe as off September. It is a diploid nothospecies with ten chromosomes (2n=10), that results from hybridisation between P. lactiflora and P. mairei.  Root, stem and leaves  It has thick tapering roots, that are reminiscent of carrots and are up to 30 cm long and 1¬Ω cm thick. The lower leaves consist of three sets of three or more leaflets, those in the middle with three main segments and each one incised, while the side leaflets have two unequal segments. The leaflets are dark green above and glaucous beneath, linear-oblong or lanceolate in shape, 5‚Äì12 cm long and 1-2¬Ω cm wide, with a base that gradually narrows into the leaflet stalk segments, lobed or with an entire margin and a pointy tip. The number of segments and lobes may be between twenty and forty. cited on  Flowers, fruits and seed  The flowers occur with one together at the end of the stem, are 8‚Äì10 cm in diameter, although sometimes aborted flower buds may be found in the axil of highest leaves. Each flower is subtended by three or four unequal leaflet-like bracts. Each flower has three, rarely four roundish sepals of 2-2¬Ω √ó 1¬Ω-2 cm, more or less extending into a narrow tip. The white or pale pink petals have an inverted egg-shape and are about 3¬Ω √ó 2 cm. Both the filaments and anthers are yellow. There is very short yellow disk which encloses the base of two to four green and hairless carpels, which are topped by white styles capped by red to purple stigmas. The carpels later develop into ovoid fruits called follicle of 2¬Ω-3 cm long and about 1 cm wide. Mature seeds are indigo-blue while the inside of the follicles is bright red.  Differences with related species  Paeonia emodi is much alike P. sterniana, having white flowers with entirely yellow stamens, and segmented leaflets. P. emodi however is with up to 1 m much taller, has only one or rarely two carpels developing per flower which are softly hairy, has several flowers per stem, and ten to fifteen segments in each lower leaf, while in P. sterniana flowers are solitary, have two to four hairless carpels and the lower leaves consist of twenty to forty segments and lobes. cited on The seeds P. emodi ripen much later than those of P. sterniana, which are already shed in August. cited on  Taxonomy  Paeonia sterniana resulted from hybridisation between P. lactiflora and P. mairei which in the past probably were sympatric in the Himalayas, but are no longer present in the same area where P. sterniana occurs. P. sterniana was discovered for western science in 1938, by Frank Ludlow and George Taylor. Seeds were brought to the West in 1947, and subsequently cultivation started at Kew Gardens. Harold Roy Fletcher described the species in 1959. In 1997 Joseph Halda thought this taxon not worthy of full species status and reduced it to P. emodi subsp. sterniana. This view however is not supported in the most recent literature.  Etymology  The species was named in honor of Frederick Claude Stern, who supported plant hunting in China and wrote a comprehensive book on peonies. cited on  Distribution  Paeonia sterniana grows among shrubs on stony slopes, and in oak forest, between 2800‚Äì3500 m altitude, in southeastern Tibet (Tsangpo Valley), particularly in Kongbo, Tamnyen, and Gyala. cited on  Cultivation  This species is said to be easy to grow, though requiring well-drained soil, and thought to be particularly suited for rock gardens.

Biography Hall was born on the reserve near Portage la Prairie, Manitoba on May 14, 1964. He was born to Marianne Hall and John Hupa, both of which were farm workers. He is documented to have at least two sisters and two brothers. Due to his parents' work, he had an unstable childhood and little supervision. According to his uncle Neil Hall, he was taken away by the Children's Aid and put into foster care at the age of three. When he was around eight, he was returned to the reserve. Hall was known for his generosity and kindness. He loved sports and swimming, and was friends with everyone. When he was younger, he had a crush on a girl and when she said she wanted candy, walked to the nearest store two miles away to purchase some for her. He enjoyed making people happy and caring for others. Hall grew up in a foster home in Waverley Heights and at eighteen, he entered a high school and employment skills program that was for inner-city youth. He graduated, working as a teacher's aide at Hugh John Macdonald School while studying education at the University of Manitoba for two years. He did other various odd jobs as well. The program was also where he met his first girlfriend, Cheryl James. James was impressed by his confidence and speaking abilities, saying \\"He wasn‚Äôt just interested in helping himself, but he also wanted to help the rest of us in the class succeed\\". He would often visit his father in the Sioux Valley reserve near Brandon, Manitoba with James and her two nephews. Hall returned to Winnipeg in 1999 or 2000 after working construction jobs in Saskatchewan. He became homeless in 2001, spending time in the Saint Boniface area and living in tents along the Red River. He occasionally drank socially, but after his mother's murder in 2004 he began to drink more heavily. Neil Hall said, \\"That tore him apart. He started not caring because he felt really bad he didn‚Äôt reconnect with her sooner\\". His sister, Kristi Hall, was murdered three years later in 2007. These events are said to have contributed significantly to the worsening of his mental health and alcoholism. On May 1 2009, Hall and his friend Wayne Spence were sitting along the riverbank when nineteen year old Joseph Mousseau fell over the Provencher Bridge guardrail and into the river. The boy was running across lanes of traffic with his friends, and attempted to pole-vault over the railing onto what he thought was a pedestrian bridge below. However, the two bridges were not connected and he fell into the water rather than onto concrete. As he fell, he hit his leg and back on a support beam, causing him to scream out. The noise alerted Hall, who immediately discarded his backpack and dove into the river to save the teenager. At an angle against the strong current in cold water, Hall swam at least fifteen meters to reach Mousseau. The boy was panicked, unable to swim due to his injuries, pushing and fighting against Hall. Hall said to Mousseau, \\"Don‚Äôt fight me! I‚Äôm trying to save you. Otherwise we‚Äôre both going to drown\\". In May 2009, while intoxicated he rescued a 19-year-old who had fallen from a bridge. Sam Katz presented him with the Mayor's Medal of Valour and baseball season tickets. Shortly afterwards, he moved into a government-owned apartment block. In September 2009, once again while intoxicated he rescued a woman from drowning in the same river. In December 2009, he was presented with two medals by the Manitoba Life Saving Society. The International Supreme Master Television Network gave him its Hero Award. On Christmas Eve 2009, he was attacked and beaten by several people who had seen him on the news. In February 2010, he was again the subject of a vicious beating. In May 2011, Hall was involved in an incident that sent him to jail for assault on a woman. The victim had offered him apples instead of money, in response to his panhandling, and Hall responded by assaulting her with the car door.Homeless Hero' jailed for assault .

Afocal photographic setups work because the imaging device's eyepiece produces collimated light and with the camera's lens focused at infinity, creating an afocal system with no net convergence or divergence in the light path between the two devices.Michael A. Covington, Astrophotography for the amateur, page 75 In this system the device is focused on the object and the camera is placed above the eyepiece as close as possible. The drawback is the system will have a high focal ratio, with a correspondingly dim image, and some vignetting. A high focal ratio also means the field of view will be narrow. Field of view can be calculated using: Focal field of view/angle of view: : Approximate: \\\\alpha = {d \\\\over f} \\\\times {180 \\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\equiv {180 d \\\\over \\\\pi f} : Precise: \\\\alpha = 2 \\\\arctan {d \\\\over 2 f} Use with optical telescopes One method of afocal photography is to mount a camera with its lens attached behind the eyepiece a Keplerian optical telescope, the combination giving the photographer a long focus lens. Historically afocal photography with 35 mm SLR or large format film cameras was a very difficult method of photography. With film cameras the bulk and mechanical shake had to be taken into consideration, with some setups employing a separate tripod for the camera (adding the complexity of setting up the camera in relationship to the eyepiece). The general difficulties of focus and exposure with film cameras, along with the detailed mathematical calculations, combined with the time lag of waiting for the film to be developed, made film afocal photography challenging.di Cicco, Dennis. \\"Afocal What?\\". SkyandTelescope.com. Retrieved 2011-04-16. Spotting scope with a digital camera mounted afocally using an adapter. Digital afocal photography The advent of digital single-lens reflex camera and, moreover, compact point and shoot digital cameras has made the afocal method far more popular since this type of camera is small enough to mount directly on to telescopes or other devices, is for the most part a solid state device with minimal moving parts, has auto focus, has auto exposure adjustment, has some capacity for time exposure, usually has a zoom mechanism to crop vignetting, and has a digital viewframe that allows the user to see the image hitting the viewing plane. Couplers and other devices for mounting digital cameras afocally are commercially available. Simply holding the camera up to the eyepiece and snapping a picture can obtain usable results. Most popular types of consumer digital cameras have non-removable lenses so afocal photography is also the only method available for these types of cameras.  Afocal astrophotography  Afocal photography is a form of astrophotography long practiced by astronomers. Afocal setups with film and digital cameras are not the preferred system for astrophotography since astrophotographers have many ways of coupling a camera to an astronomical telescope, the simplest being prime focus (using no camera lens and allowing the image to fall directly onto the film, or image plane of a digital single-lens reflex camera or purpose built astronomical CCD camera).Michael A. Covington, Astrophotography for the amateur, page 69 Almost from their invention amateur astronomers were adapting compact digital still and video cameras for use in afocal astrophotography.Michael A. Covington, Astrophotography for the amateur, page 243, afocally video imaging from 1997 But since most celestial objects require a long exposure, compact consumer digital cameras are somewhat problematic due to their high inherent sensor noise. This noise limits their usefulness, especially since point-objects, such as stars, can be obscured by even one \\"hot\\" pixel. The narrow field of view for this type of photography lends itself to lunar and planetary objects. Continuing advancements in digital camera and image manipulation have somewhat overcome this limitation and digital afocal astrophotography has become more popular. A \\"digiscoped\\" photo of a goosander, taken with a Fujifilm digital camera and a Kowa spotting scope Daytime afocal photography Since the development of compact digital cameras, afocal photography is also widely used by birdwatchers, naturalists, and other photographers. In the birdwatching community it quickly acquired the coined name of ‚Äúdigiscoping‚Äù. Birdwatchers and naturalists found a digital camera used afocally with a spotting scope to be a particularly effective technique since it gave them an easy way to record their subjects (sometimes by simply holding the camera up to the eyepiece) as well as allowing them to take relatively high quality photographs. Since these types of photographs are usually single subjects (narrow field) in daylight hours, the light loss and narrow angle of view are not a hindrance, and the high effective focal lengths are beneficial. It also facilitates the use of a very long lens without buying and transporting extra equipment, other than perhaps a small afocal adapter. This technique has lent itself to many other types of photography including photographing plants (for example, wild orchids growing in the canopy of a jungle), insects (for example, wild bees near their beehive), other shy or dangerous wild animals, or details in old buildings (for example, statues/gargoyles on the roof of old churches/castles). Afocal secondary lenses Besides combining a Keplerian telescope with a camera, there are also dedicated secondary lens afocal attachments that mount on the front of a camera lens to work in the role of a teleconverter, technically called teleside converters. These lenses are usually Galilean telescopes that alter the width of the entering beam of light without affecting the divergence of the beam, so they can change the effective focal length 1 to 3 times without increasing focal ratio.

In English it is sometimes called the fern leaf peony. It is native to the Caucasus Mountains of Russia and the Black Sea coast of Ukraine, spreading westward into Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia and eastward to northwestern Kazakhstan. It was described by Linnaeus in 1759. The leaves are finely divided into almost thread-like segments and grow close together on the stems. This peony can reach between 30 and 60 centimeters in height. The flowers are red and scented with numerous yellow stamens in the centre.Peonies: The Imperial Flower, by Jane Fearnley Whittingstall.  Description  Paeonia tenuifolia is a hairless herbaceous perennial with a stem of 30‚Äì60 cm high, which are densely set with alternately arranged compound leaves. The lowest leaves are twice compounded or the leaflets are deeply divided into many fine linear segments, ¬Ω-6 mm wide, with a blunt to rounded tip, dark green above, and lighter glaucous green below. The mostly single flower per stem seems to be floating on the foliage. The flower is 6‚Äì8 cm across, cup-shaped, with deep crimson, long inverted egg- shaped petals, with a rounded or even blunt top. The stamens are 1¬Ω‚Äî2 cm long, with yellow filaments, anthers and pollen. There are usually three, sometimes two, coarse felty haired carpels, that will eventually develop into 2 cm long, dry, dehiscent fruits called follicles. This species is diploid with ten chromosomes (2n=10). cited on  Taxonomy  P. tenuifolia was first described by Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema naturae of 1759. Franz Josef Ruprecht distinguished it from P. biebersteiniana, which was based on a specimen from Stavropol, in the Flora Caucasi, that was published in 1869. Opinions seem to have been divided as Lomakin only mentions P. tenuifolia in 1897, while two years later Lipsky separated the two species again, along with Nikolai Schipczinsky in 1937. Ketzchoweli described in 1959 P. carthalinica from Igoeti, Georgia and thought it to be very closely related to P. tenuifolia, though having broader leaflets and greyish felty hairs on the carpels and follicles. Kemularia-Nathadze, who revised the genus Paeonia in 1961, considered these two might be synonymous. In 2003, Hong and Zhou found the characters that were used to distinguish between all three taxa occurred in any combination and intergraded. Even within one population, plants typical fitting to either of the original descriptions occurred together. They found one plant with some leaves with very narrow leaflets less than 1 mm, while other leaves on the same plant had broad leaflets of over ¬Ω cm. There seems to be consensus now that all are best considered as one polymorphic species.  Ecology  steppe, Volgograd Oblast. P. tenuifolia flowers earlier than other peonies, and dies down early too. This is probably because it grows in steppes, with dry and hot summers. The seeds of this species germinate above the soil in full light, which is exceptional among peonies. The caterpillars of the moth Pelatea klugiana feed of the leaves of several Paeonia species, among which P. tenuifolia. These larvae live with several together in a nest of silk that binds together several lobes of a leaf, and move only within the nest.  Cultivation  This species is said to be an attractive plant for the garden which is easy to grow and hardy in Western Europe and the United States. Still, as an inhabitant of the steppes of southern Russia and Kazakhstan, it is adapted to growing in the full sun and experiencing cold winters, and dry, hot summers, and it is susceptible to moult development on its leaves during prolonged wet spells. It is reported to have been in cultivation in Germany as early as 1594 and was introduced to England in 1765 and America in 1806. There are some cultivars and hybrids known to be in cultivation: * P. tenuifolia \\"Rosea\\" has pink flowers. * P. tenuifolia \\"Rosea Plena\\" with double pink flowers. * P. √ósmouthii, the presumed hybrid with P. lactiflora, which is commercially introduced in 1843, and sometimes listed as P. laciniata in nursery catalogues, is taller than P. tenuifolia, usually has more than one flower per stem with a sweet perfume, traits inherited from P. lactiflora. It is a diploid, and does not produce fertile seed. It was probably named in honor of M. Smout, a professional chemist at the Catholic University of Mechelen, who was an active breeder of plants. * P. √ómajko, the presumed hybrid with P. daurica, found in Georgia, is not deemed particularly appealing. * P. tenuifolia var. plena, a variety with double flowers, is said to have been introduced to English gardens in 1765. P. hybrida was regarded a garden hybrid between P. anomala and P. tenuifolia by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1818, which according to him also occurred in the wild. However, Hong and Pan regard P. hybrida as synonymous with P. anomala.

He was involved in numerous social and political causes fighting racial discrimination against Asians and Asian Americans, providing aid for senior citizens, and organizing Japanese cultural events around New York City. Family and early life George Katsumi Yuzawa was born in Los Angeles, California on February 21, 1915. His parents, Tamasaburo \\"James\\" and Bun \\"Mary\\" Yuzawa named their Nisei (second-generation Japanese American) son after George Washington. George's parents emigrated to the United States from Nagano, Japan. In 1917, James Yuzawa started the Vermont Flower Shop in downtown Los Angeles. He served a term as president of the Southern California Floral Association. George was a founding member of Boy Scout Troop 64 in Los Angeles and achieved the rank of Life Scout. In 1932, he and other young Nisei establish the Japanese Athletic Union (JAU) to coordinate Nisei high school baseball, basketball, football and track competitions in southern California. He served as president of the JAU from 1935-1938. He graduated from Manual Arts High School in 1933 and attended Los Angeles City College where he earned an associate degree in Business. After college, George began working with his father. In 1940, George married Kimiko Hattori(1917-2011). She was the 23-year-old Nisei daughter of Tora and Seikichi \\"Walter\\" Hattori. Walter was the proprietor of Nippon Produce Market in Los Angeles. He was also an official in a local southern California produce union. Japanese internment and World War II After the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. The Yuzawa and Hattori families were forced to evacuate their homes and relocate to internment camps under the direction of the Wartime Civilian Control Agency (WCCA). They were among the 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry who were sent to ten relocation centers in the western and south central United States. The Yuzawas and Hattoris lived with approximately 20,000 other Japanese Americans at the Santa Anita racetrack in temporary barracks and converted stables. George served as the assistant director of men's athletics at Santa Anita. In September 1942, they were moved to the Granada War Relocation Center in the southeastern region of Colorado, near the small town of Granada. The Center housed over 7,000 persons of Japanese ancestry, the majority of whom were American citizens or longtime permanent U.S. residents who were ineligible for citizenship under American immigration laws. At the Center, George's father served as a block manager and George worked as the purchasing officer for the camp school system. George's younger sister, 19-year-old Chieko \\"Patricia,\\" was not permitted to go with her family to Santa Anita or the Granada War Relocation Center because she contracted tuberculosis shortly before the evacuation. The U.S. government moved her to Hillcrest Sanitarium located in the mountains of northwest Los Angeles. She died there in 1942, never having seen her parents again. During her stay, George was given permission to leave the camp (with an army escort) only once to visit her. After she died, George claimed her body. In September 1943, the Wartime Relocation Authority (WRA) released George from the Center because he had promise of employment from the Annenberg and Erickson Florist Shop in New York City. Once in New York, George arranged for his wife and their parents to join him. In 1944, George volunteered for the U.S. Army. He completed his basic training at Fort McClellan in Alabama and was then attached to an Army Intelligence unit. George was stationed in Tokyo as part of the American Occupation of Japan, where he served as a special officer for entertainment for enlisted U.S. military servicemen. He received an honorable discharge in 1946 and returned to New York City. George attended City College of New York from 1946 to 1947 on the G.I. Bill, earning a certificate in foreign trade. After forming and operating the HATCO Trading Company, Inc., George assisted his father's floral business, Park Central Florist. Clientele included actors, musicians, and Japanese businesses and corporations. George's father retired in the late 1950s due to ill health. George continued operating the shop, until his own retirement in 1982. Social and political activism George made the time to volunteer for social, religious, political, and other charitable work. In the early 1970s, he worked with other Nisei and Sansei (third-generation Japanese American) civil rights activists to combat racial discrimination against Asians. These activists included Mitziko Sawada (academic historian and author), Kazu Iijima, Min Matsuda, Kazu Obayashi and Tami Ogata (founders of Asian Americans for Action), Yuri Kochiyama (human rights activist), Suki Terada Ports (AIDS advocate), Michio Kaku (Princeton University theoretical physicist), and Aiko Herzig-Yoshinaga, who was instrumental in the Redress Movement for Japanese American internment. Kenzo Takada and the ILGWU This same core group of activists confronted Paris clothing designer, Kenzo Takada. Kenzo owned several worldwide boutiques, named \\"Soci√©t√© Jungle Jap,\\" and used the trademarks \\"Kenzo of J.A.P.\\" and \\"JAP\\" on his clothing. The group initiated a vigorous writing campaign to educate advertisers and department stores across the nation about Kenzo's use of the historically derogatory terminology, Jap. They demanded that newspapers like the New York Times stop accepting and printing Kenzo's advertisements and insisted that stores immediately stop selling his clothing. Despite this effort, some stores continued to carry Kenzo's line. In response, the activists organized a demonstration in front of the Bonwit Teller flagship store on Fifth Avenue and Macy's main department store at Herald Square. The New York City Commission on Human Rights assisted in this effort. George asked Ruby Schaar, the president of the New York chapter of the Japanese American Citizens' League (JACL) for assistance. The chapter board contacted New York Nisei attorney Moonray Kojima who filed a lawsuit against Kenzo's Paris firm as well as its American distributor, Mallory Outerwear. The lawsuit sought to prohibit Kenzo from using either \\"JAP\\" or \\"J.A.P.\\" on his labels and trademarks. On July 13, 1972, Kenzo agreed to stop using both \\"JAP\\" and \\"J.A.P.\\" An entire Butterick Patterns shipment with the word JAP was recalled in 1972. The Butterick Fashion Marketing Company also agreed to remove \\"J.A.P.\\" from its Kenzo-designed patterns and from their catalog. George and this same group protested the ILGWU's (International Ladies Garment Workers Union) implied anti-Japanese racism in its \\"Buy American\\" campaign. During the late summer and early autumn of 1972, the ILGWU produced a series of subway posters that contained anti-Japanese themes. One of the more provocative posters depicted a U.S. flag with the caption, \\"Made in Japan.\\" Underneath the \\"Made in Japan\\" caption in smaller lettering was the question: \\"Has your job been exported to Japan yet?\\" The George and other activists physically removed the posters from subway trains. In October 1972, about 100 people participated in a rally in front of ILGWU headquarters. Professor Michio Kaku was the rally spokesperson. Later that autumn, George met with ILGWU officials and they negotiated an agreement to remove the posters. The Kenzo and ILGWU incidents prompted George and others to organize Asian Americans for Fair Media, Inc. (AAFM) in 1973. This group of Nisei volunteers monitored local and national broadcasts and print media for negative Asian stereotypes and racial slurs. In 1973, the AAFM published a booklet entitled Stereotypes and Realities: The Asian Image in the United States. In 1974, the Eastern Regional Office of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights asked George to serve as a consultant. Causes for senior citizens George also devoted much of his time attending to the needs of senior citizens. In 1965, he organized the Ad Hoc Committee of Concerned Asians in New York City to address the housing needs of Issei (first-generation Japanese American) and Nisei senior citizens. During the early 1970s, with a grant from the New York Community Trust (NYCT), Concerned Asians conducted a survey to assess the needs of these senior citizens living in New York City. The findings convinced George and other committee members that a permanent organization was needed to support the aging Nisei community. Georged helped establish the Japanese American Help for the Aging, Inc. (JAHFA) in 1974. JAHFA was a non-profit organization that provided health, educational, informational, language, and social services to the elderly Japanese community in New York City. JAHFA located senior residential housing at the Methodist Home in Riverdale and began placing Issei and Nisei seniors there in 1974. In the early 1980s, JAHFA became a standing committee of the Japanese American Association of New York (JAA), to secure additional financial and manpower resources. In the mid-1980s, George formed an affiliation with the Isabella Geriatric Center in upper Manhattan. Isabella offered both a nursing home and resident apartments for seniors. He formed an exchange program between eldercare professionals from Japan and the staff at Isabella. George also helped to form the West Side Federation for Senior Housing, Inc., (WSFSH), due to the large population of Issei and Nisei residing on the West Side of Manhattan. George served on the organization's board of directors. Founded in 1977, the WSFSH assisted with the distribution of funds from federal and private sources to local residential construction projects on the Upper West Side. Redress of Japanese internment In 1981, George served as a member of the East Coast Japanese Americans for Redress organization, which advised the federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. He helped organize the November 1981 commission hearings in New York City. The hearings in turn helped shape the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 in which President Ronald Reagan and the U.S. Congress apologized for World War II evacuation and internment of Japanese American citizens and permanent residents, authorized the payment of $20,000 to each evacuee who was still alive, and allocated $50 million for a public education fund. Japanese cultural education George served as a vice president, board member, and committee chair for the Japanese American Association of New York (JAA), and organized numerous Japanese cultural, educational, and preservation activities in New York City. Between 1968 and 2001, George helped plan cultural celebrations such as Nipponanza at the Beacon Theater in 1979. Nipponanza was part of a nationwide festival featuring Japanese arts and culture. In 1980, George coordinated the renovation of a Japanese burial plot at Willow Grove Cemetery in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Established in 1870, the plot contains the remains of eight Japanese who died during the 1870s and 1880s and who were among the earliest Japanese settlers in the tristate region. In 1982, George and the JAA helped establish the annual spring Sakura Matsuri Cherry Blossom Festival at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. This festival continues to the present day. During the summer of 1985, George also served on the New York-Tokyo Sister City Committee, helping to plan events that celebrated the 25th anniversary of the New York-Tokyo sister city relationship. He and then JAA president, Shigeru Inagaki, helped raise 168 Japanese cherry trees between 1992 and 2001 in Van Cortlandt Park. In April 2001, the trees were donated to New York City and transplanted to Cherry Hill Slope, where they constitute the George Yuzawa Grove. Religious causes A devout Methodist, he negotiated the sale of the Japanese Methodist-Episcopal Church building following the church's merger with two other congregations. In 1969 and 1970, he helped design the interior of the then-new Japanese American United Church building. He also provided leadership as a longtime chair and member of the church's board of directors. Other associations George worked with the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles to develop an Ellis Island exhibit called \\"America's Concentration Camps.\\" He was also a founding member of the Asian & Pacific Islander Coalition on HIV/AIDS (APICHA), a member of the National Parks Conservation Association, and an advisor to Harmonia Opera. In addition, George was a charter member of the Japanese American Lions Club of New York, a member and president of the Nisei Investors of New York, and a Day of Remembrance Committee member. Awards George received many commendations for his years of service, including the Governor's Award for Excellence from New York Governor George Pataki and an invitation to the White House from President Jimmy Carter. In 1983, the Emperor of Japan awarded George the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 5th Class, for his service on behalf of both Japanese and non-Japanese people. George and his wife Kimi had two children, Gene and Pat Yuzawa-Rubin, and three grandchildren. George died in October 2011. Kimi died in November 2011.

History Designed by architect Lansing C. Holden, Sr., the Bayonne Trust Company building is an excellent example of Beaux-Arts architecture. The general contractor for the building was Wells & Marvin of New York, and the granite work was done by the George Brown Company. Construction began on May 1, 1912, with a budget of $100,000, but it cost $150,000 when completed. The bank opened on November 8, 1913. The Commercial Trust Company, its first occupant, was dissolved in 1948, and the building was sold to the United Jersey Bank. It was subsequently owned by Summit Bank and Fleet National Bank. FleetBoston Financial, which merged with Summit Bancorp in 2001, sold the bank building to the city on December 19, 2001. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 8, 2006. Until its purchase by the City of Bayonne, the building had been used as a bank, which has contributed to the preservation of its architectural integrity. The bank was remodeled in the 1970s. The remodeling involved adding drop ceilings that covered up three stained glass windows. The original bronze doors were replaced with double doors of contemporary glass and bronze oxidized aluminum in 1979. The two-story Vermont granite-clad structure features paired, fluted Ionic columns flanking the front door, with segmented arch windows over the doorway. The entrance is in a pediment portico. The stone lintel over the door has the engraving \\"Incorporated 1902.\\" The original four-riser granite stairs to the entrance are in good condition as is the contemporary wrought iron railing, which is not original to the building.

Sel-sync recording dramatically changed the recording process allowing overdubbing of individual recorded tracks. Sel-sync along with the multi-track head was invented by Ross_S._Snyder at Ampex in 1955. Three problems had to be solved: mechanical alignment, switching of the record track to playback mode and multitrack erase head. The hard problem was the switching of a track between record and playback mode, as the impedance of record heads are quite different from the impedance of play back heads. Prior to Sel-Sync record heads were directly wired to the record electronics and playback heads were directly wired to the playback electronics. Also the designs of the two heads were very different. The problem of switching very low-level/high-impedance circuitry without introducing hum or noise had to be solved. Mort Fujii in the Ampex special projects lab was responsible for the actual design.Ross Snyder interviewed by Howard Sanner about the history of Les Paul's eight track Ampex 300 and Sel-Sync, 11 Mar 2000 Ampex did not patent Sel-Sync because Ross Snyder did not think it would be of interest to more than a few musicians and an Ampex lawyer said the idea was \\"obvious\\", hence unpatentable. Ampex only trademarked the name.Ampex Sel-Sync, 1955 Sel-Sync remained an external, add- on function until the AG-440 and later series, wherein Sel-Sync was integrated into every electronics, although for obvious reasons Sel-Sync is useful only with multi-track machines (more than one track, and, usually, three or more tracks). D-2 (video) was the first digital recording video tape format to offer Sel-Sync \\"read before write\\" (an Ampex term) also known as \\"preread\\" on Sony magnetic tape recorders. Read before write allowed simultaneous playback and recording on the same VCR.

Playing career Cornacchini initially played for Fano Fano between 1981 and 1987, and also had a spell on loan with Foligno during the 1985‚Äì86 season. After stints with Reggiana and Virescit Bergamo, he joined Piacenza in 1989, where he scored 36 goals in two seasons, finishing as the top scorer in Serie C1 on both occasions, and helping his team to win promotion during the 1990‚Äì91 season. His performances and prolific goalscoring attracted the attention of Serie A club Milan, by whom he was subsequently acquired in 1991; however, he often struggled to find space in the team's starting XI under manager Fabio Capello, due to the presence of established forwards such as Marco van Basten and Ruud Gullit; he obtained only three league appearances, making his club and Serie A debut on 15 September 1991, in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Juventus in Turin, as Milan finished the 1991‚Äì92 season as Serie A champions. The following season, Cornacchini returned to Serie C1, joining Perugia, where he scored 59 goals over three seasons, finishing as the top scorer of his division in the first two, and later helping his team achieve promotion to Serie B as the league's second-highest goalscorer, behind only Giovanni Pisano. He joined Bologna ahead of the 1995‚Äì96 season, although he was unable to replicate his performances at Perugia. Notwithstanding this, the following season, he was acquired by Vicenza manager Francesco Guidolin (whom he later described as his best manager in 2019), where he won the 1996‚Äì97 Coppa Italia, contributing to his team's victory by scoring important goals in the competition, in particular against Genoa, and later against his former club Bologna in the semi-finals; he also started in the victorious two-legged final against Napoli. He made 18 Serie A appearances that season, and scored his only Serie A goal on 20 April 1997, in a 4‚Äì1 win over Perugia in Reggio Emilia. In total, he obtained 21 appearances in his two seasons in the Italian top flight. In 1997, Cornacchini joined Serie B side Padova, but subsequently moved to fellow second division side Castel di Sangro in November of that year. In February, after only making seven appearances for the latter club, he joined Ternana in Serie C1, helping the club obtain promotion with three goals in 13 appearances under manager Luigi Delneri. After returning to Padova, now in Serie C1, he ended his career in the lower divisions of Italian football, with Gubbio, Fano, and finally Cagliese, retiring at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season. Style of play A fast, agile, and diminutive forward, Cornacchini was known for his speed in tight spaces, his opportunism inside the penalty area, and his eye for goal; however, he was not particularly skilful from a technical standpoint. Despite his slender build and small stature of , he was also effective in the air, courtesy of his power and elevation. Known for his clinical finishing in front of goal, he was a highly prolific goalscorer in Serie C; however, he struggled to replicate similar goalscoring performances in Serie A. Coaching career Following his retirement, Cornacchini worked as a manager. On 22 September 2019, he was fired by Bari.

Laura's murder On 4 December 1563 Laura was caught with a man who was not her husband, Don Vincenzo La Grua Talamanca, Baron of Carini. This resulted in a crime of passion, and she was murdered in her bedchamber in Carini Castle, along with her lover Ludovico Vernagallo.'' Her father, Cesare Lanza, Count of Trabia, confessed to the killing in a letter which he wrote to Philip II of Spain, but her husband was also suspected on account of rumors that he planned to marry again. It is also believed that La Grua may have killed Vernagallo to prevent Vernagallo from receiving the Lanza inheritance if he had an illegitimate child with Lanza. One reason proposed for Cesare being willing to accept the blame is that the crime qualified as an honor killing and therefore socially acceptable by the Italian nobility at the time. The confessional letter is housed at the Chiesa Madre church in Carini. King Philip II granted pardons to the murderers, who cited medieval law in their defense. La Grua did marry again in 1565 to Ninfa Ruiz, who died less than a year after their marriage. Legacy There is a popular legend that, on the anniversary of Baroness Lanza's murder, her bloody handprint will appear on a particular spot on her chamber wall. The mayor of Carini, in conjunction with a project to restore the famed castle to its 16th- century appearance, has reopened the case for forensic study. In 2007, Italian state television (RAI) aired a two-part drama with the role of the Baroness played by Italian actress, Vittoria Puccini.

Along with the nearby village of Karavidia, it forms a community in the municipal unit of Molos.  History  The village is located on the northern slopes of Mount Kallidromon, some 6 km southeast of Thermopylae. The early history of the settlement is obscure; it was likely a Slavic settlement of the middle Byzantine period. Mendenitsa only appears in the sources during the late Middle Ages, as the seat of the Marquisate of Bodonitsa, a Frankish Crusader state established in 1204 to guard the strategic pass of Thermopylae, that connected northern and southern Greece. Its first ruler, Guido Pallavicini, also built the castle, possibly located on the site of an ancient acropolis, often identified with that of the city of Pharygai. The Chronicle of the Morea reports that the original fief was granted by Boniface of Montferrat, King of Thessalonica, but following the recovery of Thessaly by the Greek Despotate of Epirus, it was soon cut off from Thessalonica, and formed indeed the northernmost march of the Latin states of southern Greece. By the middle of the century, the marquess became a vassal of the Principality of Achaea, and ranked among the twelve foremost barons of that realm. Bodonitsa also became the residence of the Bishopric of Thermopylae, which came under Roman Catholic control after 1204. After two successive bishops had been killed by pirate attacks, in 1209 the bishop moved from the exposed coastal site to Bodonitsa; by the early 14th century the see had assumed its name in its title (eglise de la Bondenice). There was also a local Greek Orthodox see, a suffragan of Larissa in the 14th century and of Athens thereafter. The fifth marquess, Albert Pallavicini, married Maria dalle Carceri, thereby connecting the marquisate to the Triarchy of Negroponte and ultimately to Venetian interests. Consequently, when the Catalan Company seized the Duchy of Athens in 1311, following the Battle of Halmyros‚Äîwhere, among the flower of the Frankish nobility of Greece, margrave Albert fell as well‚ÄîBodonitsa was able to survive by becoming a Venetian protectorate, although now Bodonitsa was also considered a feudatory of Athens, and a tribute was paid to the Catalan vicars-general. Venetian support was unable to prevent the plundering of the marquisate by the Aydinid Turks under Umur Bey in 1332, however. When the first husband of the marchioness Guglielma Pallavicini died, she even asked Venice to choose a new husband for her: Nicholas I Zorzi, who married Guglielma in 1335. The couple fell out, and the headstrong marchioness evicted her husband from Bodonitsa, but his son Francis Zorzi continued the new dynasty's rule over Bodonitsa. The collapse of Catalan rule in 1388 liberated Bodonitsa from its tribute to Athens, but in 1394 a new and more dangerous appeared in the person of the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, who conquered most of Greece, including the nearby County of Salona. Bodonitsa was spared, possibly because of its Venetian connections, and agreed to pay tribute. Bayezid's death in the Battle of Ankara in 1402 gained a respite, that proved brief: already in 1408, the marquess Jacob Zorzi arranged for many of his subjects and their animals to find refuge at Karystos, and in 1410 the Ottomans invaded the marquisate and laid siege to Bodonitsa. The siege lasted until 20 June 1414, when the castle was captured and razed. The Venetians demanded its return to the exiled Nicholas III Zorzi at Karystos, without success; Nicholas III and his descendants continued to claim the marquisate until Euboea, and Karystos with it, fell to the Ottomans in 1470. It is possible that the castle of Mendenitsa is to be identified with the Vriokastro (ŒíœÅŒπœåŒ∫Œ±œÉœÑœÅŒø) of later portolans.

The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson. Publication history Scatterbrain (Will Deguchi) was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson and debuted in Strikeforce: Morituri #6 (May 1987). The codename \\"Scatterbrain\\" was introduced in issue #8, in which he also joined the title cast of Strikeforce: Morituri. Scatterbrain remained in the regular cast of the book until his incapacitation in issue #18. He finally died in issue #24, the last character of the series to die of the infamous \\"Morituri effect\\". Subsequent issues saw appearances of what appeared to be his ghost, until, in the Strikeforce: Morituri: Electric Undertow miniseries, it was revealed to be a sentient artificial intelligence modelled after the late Scatterbrain. The character's surname and design indicates that he is at least partially of Japanese origin. Fictional character biography Almost nothing is known of Will Deguchi's life prior to his decision to join Strikeforce: Morituri. Apparently, at a young age, possibly as a child, he experienced a devastating earthquake in Missouri, an experience he used years later to telepathically project it in battle.Strikeforce: Morituri #17 In 2073, the young Deguchi decided to volunteer for the Morituri program, hoping to assist in the ongoing war of Earth against the alien invaders known as the Horde. The aforementioned program granted superhuman powers to ordinary humans, in turn transforming them into super-powered soldiers against the Horde. However, the process came at a terrible price, a fatal flaw which ensured that its recipients would die within a year of receiving the process, due to the unstable nature of this \\"transformation\\". Nevertheless, after proving genetically compatible for the process, Deguchi decided to undergo it. Deguchi was the last of the so-called second generation of Morituri to go through the process, preceded by Toxyn and Scaredycat.Strikeforce: Morituri #6 After going through the process, Deguchi, like most Morituri, was instructed to participate in a test in the booby-trapped Biowar Facility Alpha (nicknamed \\"the Garden\\"), so that his powers would burst forth under extreme pressure and stress. However, Deguchi almost died in the process of facing the deadly traps of the test environment. He was eventually saved by the doctors of the Morituri program, although his left leg was irretrievably damaged. Feeling guilty for him, the inventor of the Morituri process and the Garden facility, Dr. Kimmo Tuolema, designed a leg brace for Deguchi, which became a permanent part of his. Having now developed the ability to project emotions, but in a rather unfocused manner and across groups of people, Deguchi was given the humorous codename \\"Scatterbrain\\" by his teammate, Pilar Lysieux, in turn giving her the codename \\"Scaredycat\\", because of her ability to induce panic and fear to others. The three Morituri soon met with their senior members and participated in their first official battle.Strikeforce: Morituri #8 Later, thanks to the data that fellow member Adept had accumulated from a mission of the team in the Horde fleet in outer space, special boots that enabled flight were designed and handed out to the Morituri. Thanks to the flight boots, an enthusiastic Scatterbrain overcame any kinetic problems posed by his smashed leg.Strikeforce: Morituri #9 Initially, Scatterbrain could only transmit psychological conditions, ranging from drunkenness and sobriety to fear and nausea, albeit in an unfocused manner, often affecting his own teammates if they were in the vicinity, against his own will. Over time, his control over his power increased and it became more sophisticated. His telepathy grew to the point he was now also able to sense the emotions and read the minds of his fellow Morituri. Power boost Months later, during a battle against the super-powered Super Hordians seemed to have their match. Simultaneously, a new batch of Morituri were going through the process, albeit without the supervision of Dr. Tuolema. The carelessness of the scientists' team during the process led to the four new volunteers being transformed into enormities. One of the horribly disfigured Morituri, on his despair, manifested a telepathic ability that enabled him to connect to the other Morituri. In agony, the new Morituri reached out to fellow Morituri - and telepath - Scatterbrain, and through him, unleashed a powerful psychic blast that slew all the Super Hordians.Strikeforce: Morituri #16 The team realized that something was horribly wrong and they visited the Morituri base, where they witnessed the results of the operators' carelessness. Scatterbrain telepathically interrogated the chief operator and realized that it didn't matter to him what they had done and they would be willing to do it again, regardless of the sacrifice. Repulsed by the stance of the operator, Scatterbrain incapacitated. With the Horde launching an attack against the Morituri base, Scatterbrain felt like they were working monsters - the Paedia World Government - and suggested to his teammates they do nothing and just die all together in the hands of the Horde, like they deserved. However, the new Morituri decided to help them and the telepathic one among them temporarily used Scatterbrain as a vessel to announce their decision. After Scatterbrain's powers vanquished the Hordians, fellow member Silencer euthanized the monstrous Morituri, relieving them from their misery.Strikeforce: Morituri #17 Coma and death Following this incident, Scatterbrain grew increasingly obsessed with death and what lay beyond it. Furthermore, his mental connection with the telepathic Morituri had left his powers significantly enhanced; he could focus his powers, but could not stop himself from sensing every thought and emotion of the others, mentally \\"hearing\\" everything. Around the same time, Scaredycat started making romantic advances towards him and the two began forming a romance. However, now manifesting clairsentience, Scatterbrain foresaw that she would be the next one to die of the Morituri effect, and informed her of the fact, which she faced quite stoically. Shortly afterwards, the Morituri faced some Hordians and killed one of their highest warlords. Scatterbrain locked into the dying alien's mind, longing to see what awaited him after death. Seeing only darkness and pain, an agonizing Scatterbrain lashed out with his psychic powers and inadvertently killed the remaining Hordians. However, the traumatic experience also caused him to withdraw into a self-induced coma.Strikeforce: Morituri #18 For the next few months, Scatterbrain remained in coma, until he died peacefully, never waking from his coma, having almost exhausted the one-year limit of the Morituri effect. He was the last member of his generation to die.Strikeforce: Morituri #24 Artificial intelligence In the same morning that Scatterbrain died, new team member Scanner was visited in his dreams by what appeared to be Scatterbrain. \\"Scatterbrain\\" warned him of the \\"new ones\\" (the alien race known as VXX199), the conspiracy of the corrupt politician Andre Lemont, and his teammate Shear. When Scanner woke up, he checked on the comatose Scatterbrain, only to discover he had just died of the Morituri effect that morning.Strikeforce: Morituri #24 All of Scatterbrain's warnings proved correct. Later, while being unconscious, Scanner was again visited in his dreams by Scatterbrain, who reiterated his warnings.Strikeforce: Morituri #29 Ten years after the conspiracy was revealed, Scanner was again visited by the ghost of the late Scatterbrain, who warned him of the VXX199 and their subtle efforts to take over the word.Strikeforce: Morituri: Electric Undertow #1-2 Eventually, this new \\"Scatterbrain\\" revealed he was an artificial intelligence, which had been developed by the United States of America in late 20th century, for military purposes. The then rival of USA, the Soviet Union, tried to erase the A.I. with a virus, but failed, only making it stronger, as it grew to become a sentient entity. The A.I. then took over world communications and began influencing global developments, spreading false information or appointing certain politicians. The A.I. essentially pulled the strings that led to the formation of a World Government and, after the war with the Horde started, the formation of Morituri. The A.I. was controlling powerful politician Lamont, until he began being influenced by a mysterious outside source. Wishing to investigate, the A.I. entered the comatose Scatterbrain's mind through a bio-chip implant in his brain and copied his powers and personality. With Scatterbrain's psychic powers, the A.I. reached space and discovered about the nefarious plans of the seemingly benevolent alien race of the VXX199. The A.I. created a construct-personality program from Scatterbrain's memories and entered Scanner's dreams, through Scanner's own bio-chip implant in the brain, where he proceeded to warn him, while posing as Scatterbrain.Strikeforce: Morituri: Electric Undertow #3 Calling himself \\"Will\\", from the last Will Deguchi, the A.I. helped Scanner and the other surviving Morituri to destroy the VXXX199, although it also warned them of new perils waiting in the future.Strikeforce: Morituri: Electric Undertow #4-5 References Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987 Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Marvel Comics telepaths ","title":"Scatterbrain (Morituri)"},{"id":"26177277","text":"Nobody's Baby is a 2001 comedy film written and directed by David Seltzer and starring Gary Oldman and Skeet Ulrich.

The film's \\"witless script wrings few laughs from its retread conceits...What's most toxic, however, is having to watch these actors sweat for their paychecks. Oldman vanishes into mutton chops and Walter Brennan mannerisms, gamely making an idiot of himself, to absolutely no humorous result....Steenburgen, Greene and O'Neill are allowed to be little more than unpleasant; Matthew Modine surfaces in a nothing role.

It was built in 1906. It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Production finished in 1990. Location Oldham is a large town in Greater Manchester, England. It lies amongst the Pennines on elevated ground between the rivers Irk and Medlock, south-southeast of Rochdale, and northeast of the city of Manchester. Oldham is surrounded by several smaller settlements which together form the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham; Chadderton and Hollinwood are such settlements. Chadderton and Hollinwood are served by the Rochdale Canal and the Hollinwood Branch Canal. A rail service was provided by the Oldham Loop Line that was built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. History Oldham rose to prominence during the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the first ever industrialised towns, rapidly becoming \\"one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in England\\", spinning Oldham counts, the coarser counts of cotton. Oldham's soils were too thin and poor to sustain crop growing, and so for decades prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade. It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that Oldham changed from being a cottage industry township producing woollen garments via domestic manual labour, to a sprawling industrial metropolis of textile factories. The first mill, Lees Hall, was built by William Clegg in about 1778. Within a year, 11 other mills had been constructed, but by 1818 there were only 19 of these privately owned mills. It was in the second half of the 19th century, that Oldham became the world centre for spinning cotton yarn.. This was due in a large part to the formation of limited liability companies known as Oldham Limiteds. In 1851, over 30% of Oldham's population was employed within the textile sector, compared to 5% across Great Britain. At its zenith, it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world.. By 1871 Oldham had more spindles than any country in the world except the United States, and in 1909, was spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined. By 1911 there were 16.4 million spindles in Oldham, compared with a total of 58 million in the United Kingdom and 143.5 million in the world; in 1928, with the construction of the UK's largest textile factory Oldham reached its manufacturing zenith. At its peak, there were over 360 mills, operating night and day; The Manor Mill was erected in 1906. The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914‚Äì18 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Manor Mill, Chadderton was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. The mill ceased cotton processing in 1932, but was reopened in 1940 by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation. It finally closed in 1990. It had been intended that the building would become a heritage centre, but this scheme has now been abandoned. Its sister mill, the Kent, designed by George Stott in 1908 was demolished in 1994. Manor Mill was managed by Jim Shelmerdine during most of the LCC years. He received an OBE for \\"service to the cotton industry\\" in 1987, a result of the health and safety record he built up in Manor Mill. Shelmerdine was the first to get the annual safety award for ten years.  Architecture  Manor Mill in 1951 Designed by George Stott, the Manor Mill was erected in 1906, and is characterised by its impressive copper-covered dome after the Byzantine style. It is built of red brick with stone dressings. It has an external engine house. It is Grade II listed.  Power  Driven by a 1500 hp cross compound engine by George Saxon, 1907. It had a 26 ft flywheel, 30 ropes operating at 64 ¬Ω rpm. Its cylinders, 25\\"HP, 52\\"LP had a 5 ft 6\\" stroke. It steamed at 160psi.It had Corliss valves on both cylinders.

She was succeeded in turn by her sons, daughter-in-law, grandson and great-grandson and the Bateman family silversmithing company lasted until the middle of the nineteenth century. Biography Hester Neden or Needham was baptised in London on 7 October 1708, the daughter of John Neden or Needham. On 20 May 1732 she married a gold chain maker and wire drawer called John Bateman. During their marriage, she gave birth to six children: John Joseph (Joss), Letitia, Ann, Peter, William and Jonathan. John Bateman died of consumption (tuberculosis) in 1760, leaving his tools to his wife in his will. She took over the family business and registered her first sponsor's mark at the Goldsmith's Hall in 1761, simply \\"HB\\" in script. From the time up to the late 1770s, not much Bateman work is known, possibly because she was supplying pieces for other silversmiths that were subsequently overstamped with their marks. After about 1774, Hester Bateman worked to build up the business at 107 Bunhill Row, London with her sons Jonathan(1747-1791) and Peter(1740-1825). They used the latest technology to produce their silverware as cheaply as possible and compete with other companies using Sheffield Plate. They used thin gauge sheet silver and machines to punch and pierce it. The family specialised in household silverware in a neo classical style, and she expanded their range to include many goods such as tea caddies, jugs, salvers, salt cellars, wine labels, trays and ink wells. Their work is characterised by bright-cut engraving, beading around edges and piercing. Hester Bateman retired in 1790 and was succeeded by her sons. She died on 16 September 1794 at her home at 107 Bunhill Row and was buried at St Luke's, Old Street, London. Legacy The business that Hester Bateman had built up and run for thirty years was taken over by her sons Peter and Jonathan. They registered a hallmark with their initials (\\"PB\\" over \\"IB\\") in December 1790, but Jonathan died in April 1791. Jonathan's widow Ann-Olympe (Dowling) (1748‚Äì1813) entered a hallmark with her brother-in-law Peter (\\"PB\\" over \\"AB\\") and worked for the company until 1805. Peter Bateman retired in 1815 and passed the company to his nephew William (1774‚Äì1850), son of Jonathan and Ann Bateman. His son, also called William Bateman, took over in 1839 until 1843 when the Bateman family company closed. Bateman silverware continues to be popular, and Hester Bateman is considered one of the finest English silversmiths.

While on stage, the acrobat was to have placed his body inside an empty wine bottle, in full view of the audience. Following a non-appearance, the audience rioted and gutted the theatre. History Background Although the identity of the hoax's perpetrator is unknown, several authors consider John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, to have been responsible. While in the company of other noblemen, the Duke was reported to have made a bet that, with an advertisement claiming that a man could \\"creep into a quart bottle\\", he could fill a theatre. The event was advertised in several London newspapers and was soon the talk of the town. Performance In front of a huge audience, which included the king's second son, the Duke of Cumberland, the theatre lights were brought up at about 7 pm. With no music to keep them entertained, the crowd grew restless and began to voice their discontent. A theatre employee appeared from behind the curtain and told the audience that, if the performer did not appear, their money would be refunded. One member of the audience reportedly shouted that if the audience paid double, the conjurer would fit himself into a pint bottle. As the crowd grew more restless, someone threw a lighted candle onto the stage. Most of the audience‚Äîincluding the Duke‚Äîtook this as their cue to leave, some \\"losing a cloak, others a hat, others a wig, and swords also\\". A group of angry spectators stayed inside and gutted the theatre. Benches were ripped up, scenery was destroyed and boxes were demolished. Debris was dragged into the street and burnt on a bonfire. Aftermath Suspicion immediately fell upon the theatre's manager, Samuel Foote, for having originated the hoax.

Potter himself fell under suspicion, but was apparently innocent, \\"a strange man\\" having dealt with all the arrangements that night. The \\"Man in the Bottle\\" instantly became the target of the newspapers and pamphlets, who published cutting satires about the conjurer's non-appearance, and its consequences. Many satirical prints were produced, among them two caricatures published within the month: The Bottle-Conjuror from Head to Foot, without equivocation, and English Credulity; or ye're all bottled.The hoax later provided the inspiration for Isaac Cruikshank's 1803 anti-Napoleon cartoon Britannia blowing up the Corsican Bottle-Conjurer One newspaper explained the non-appearance of the conjurer by claiming that he had been ready to perform on the night, but was asked for a private audience beforehand; whereupon receiving a demonstration of the trick, the viewer had \\"corked up the bottle, whipped it in his pocket and made off.\\" References Notes Bibliography   Category:Hoaxes in the United Kingdom Category:Theatre in the United Kingdom Category:18th-century hoaxes Category:1749 in England ","title":"The Bottle Conjuror"},{"id":"26177391","text":"James N.J.

The term is usually attributed to Jed Emerson, and sometimes used interchangeably with triple bottom line. Blended value propositions are founded on the notion that value cannot be bifurcated, and is inherently made up of more than one measurement of performance. For example, under a blended value proposition, a for-profit business would consider their social and environmental impact on society alongside their financial performance measurement. Within the same context, non-profits would consider their financial efficiency and sustainability in tandem with their social and environmental performance. Blended value suggests the true measure of any organization is in its ability to holistically perform in all 3 areas. Blended Value In Action Five silos of Blended Value Blended value activity is most apparent within five sectors, or ‚Äúsilos‚Äù, in which organizations are more likely to intentionally seek a blend of social, environmental and financial elements of performance. The five silos are: * Social Enterprise: Enterprises that use business skills and concepts to have a meaningful and sustainable social impact. Rather than maximizing profit, social enterprises try to enrich the lives of people who are poor, sick or disenfranchised. * Impact Investing: private investors in pursuit of financial, social, and environmental returns providing capital to sustainable enterprises with a social mission. * Strategic Philanthropy: Strategic Philanthropy is an approach to philanthropic giving not as simply charitable donations, but rather taking an investing discipline for the creation of social value. * Corporate Social Responsibility Programs: CSR describes companies and business managers/leaders who consciously integrate strategies that seek to create environmental and social value within side programs, operations and supply chains. CSR may also be manifest in terms of how a company manages its investments and philanthropy. * Sustainable Development: Guiding principle of global development that places emphasis on environmental sustainability, and improving the economic and social conditions of the developing world. Blended Value Business models Organizations that incorporate Blended Value business models are actively seeking to maximize their value to society while maximizing their financial efficiency. An example is a fair trade coffee cooperative, which creates social value through the guaranteed minimum prices paid to coffee farmers and direct community development investments. Their model's ability to yield blended value depends on its financial viability. Blended value suggests that all 3 components (social, financial, and environmental) must be integrated into any value assessment.  Supply Chains  A business model's supply chain is also considered when assessing their blended value creation. Under the blended value framework, an apparel company, for example, that sources its clothes from a sweatshop factory‚Äîlike the factory involved in the 2013 Savar building collapse‚Äîwould generate a low level of social value. Blended value propositions dictate organizations (for-profit and non-profit alike) should actively try to choose suppliers who also generate high blended value; to continue the example above, an apparel company that sources from a fair trade certified textile manufacturer would yield a high level of blended value.  Blended Value in Investing  Emerson proposed the term ‚ÄúBlended Value‚Äù within the context of impact investing to describe the various categories of returns an investor should be looking for. Emerson posits the idea that measuring investments purely in terms of financial returns is a disingenuous assessment of reality because there are social and environmental implications to any business activity. There is a slight distinction between a business model that generates blended value, and an investment creating blended value. The difference can be explained through the concept of additionality. Additionality is the added value that can be attributed to the investment (i.e. if an investment has high level of additionality, then a large part of the organizations impact can be isolated and attributed to that specific injection of capital). This isolation is meant to convey how exactly the capital from the investment creates varying levels of value. Organizations gather data in order to report their performance to their investors. When investors seek blended value, they look for social, environmental, and financial returns. Although there is no single standardized measurement system to define these returns for investors, efforts are being taken by organizations such as GIIN and GIIRS to create a set of measurement tools and metrics that make holistic assessment of investments more feasible. The current systems include: * IRIS - Impact Reporting and Investment Standards * GIIRS Ratings * SROI- Social Return on Investment *PULSE.

While Bluetooth is the most common means of transmitting, other signal types such as Wi-Fi and FM are becoming more common. In order for close range marketing to work effectively, a person needs to have some sort of application installed to his mobile device that accepts push notifications.

Commonly referred to as the UN-UPR, it was established by General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 3 April 2006, the UN-UPR periodically examines the human rights performance of all 193 UN Member States. It is intended to complement, not duplicate, the work of other human rights mechanisms, including the UN human rights treaty bodies. This is the first international human rights mechanism to address all countries and all human rights. The Working Group on the UPR, which is composed of the HRC's 47 Member States and chaired by the HRC President, conducts country reviews.  Principles and objectives  HRC Resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007 and HRC decision 6/102 of 27 September 2007 elaborated on the UPR's functions in its first cycle from 2008 - 2012. For the second and subsequent cycles, a few amendments were introduced to the UPR by HRC Resolution 16/21 of 12 April 2011 and HRC decision 17/119 of 19 July 2011, after a review by the HRC (for further details, see HRC review process below). HRC resolution 5/1 provides that the UPR should:Annex to resolution 5/1, para. 3. * Promote the universality, interdependence, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights * Be a cooperative mechanism based on objective and reliable information and on interactive dialogue * Ensure universal coverage and equal treatment of all States * Be an intergovernmental process, UN Member-driven and action oriented * Fully involve the country under review * Complement and not duplicate other human rights mechanisms, thus representing an added value * Be conducted in an objective, transparent, non-selective, constructive, non-confrontational and non-politicized manner * Not be overly burdensome to the concerned State or to the agenda of the HRC * Not be overly long; it should be realistic and not absorb a disproportionate amount of time or human and financial resources * Not diminish the HRC's capacity to respond to urgent human rights situations * Fully integrate a gender perspective * Take into account the level of development and specificities of countries * Ensure the participation of all relevant stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and national human rights institutions (NHRIs). The objectives of the UN-UPR are:Annex to resolution 5/1, para. 4. * The improvement of the human rights situation on the ground * The fulfilment of the State's human rights obligations and commitments and assessment of positive developments and challenges faced by the State * The enhancement of the State's capacity and of technical assistance, in consultation with, and with the consent of, the State concerned * The sharing of best practice among States and other stakeholders * Support for cooperation in the promotion and protection of human rights * The encouragement of full cooperation and engagement with the HRC, other human rights bodies and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). HRC resolution 16/21 further provides that the second and subsequent cycles should focus on the implementation of the accepted recommendations and the developments of the human rights situation in the State under review.  Procedure   UN-UPR cycle  While the first UN-UPR operated on a four- year cycle, the second was extended to four and a half years, and the third lasts five years. Forty-two States are now reviewed each year during three sessions of the HRC's Working Group on the UPR, with 14 States reviewed at each session. The HRC determined the order of review for the first UPR cycle (2008-2012) on 21 September 2007 through the drawing of lots‚ÄòBasic facts about the UPR‚Äô, OHCHR. and the same order will be maintained during the second and subsequent cycles. The first order of review was instructed by the resolution 5/1 requirementsAnnex to resolution 5/1, paras. 8-11. that all 47 member States of the HRC be reviewed during their term of membership, in addition to a few other criteria.  Basis of country reviews  The basis of country reviews is: (a) the Charter of the UN; (b) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; (c) human rights instruments to which a State is party; and (d) voluntary pledges and commitments made by the State, including those undertaken when presenting their candidature for election to the HRC. Country reviews also take into account applicable international humanitarian law.Annex to resolution 5/1, paras. 1-2.  Documentation upon which country reviews are based  Country reviews are based on three documents: * A 20-page national report prepared by the State under review * A ten-page compilation of UN information (including Special Procedures reports, human rights treaty body reports, and other relevant UN documentation) prepared by OHCHR * A ten-page summary of information received from stakeholders (including NHRIs, NGOs, and other civil society actors) also prepared by the OHCHR In decision 6/102, the HRC provided guidelines for the preparation of information under the UPR. It specifies that States, in preparing national reports, should address/provide: * A description of the methodology and the broad consultation process followed for the preparation of information provided under the UPR * Background of the country under review and framework (particularly normative and institutional framework) for the promotion and protection of human rights: constitution, legislation, policy measures, national jurisprudence, human rights infrastructure including NHRIs, and scope of international obligations identified in the ‚Äúbasis of review‚Äù in resolution 5/1 * Promotion and protection of human rights on the ground: implementation of international human rights obligations identified in the ‚Äúbasis of review‚Äù in resolution 5/1, national legislation and voluntary commitments, NHRI activities, public awareness of human rights, cooperation with human rights mechanisms * Identification of achievements, best practices, challenges and constraints * Key national priorities, initiatives and commitments that the State concerned intends to undertake to overcome those challenges and constraints and improve its human rights situation * Expectations of the State concerned in terms of capacity-building and requests, if any, for technical assistance; and * In the second and subsequent UPR cycles, this should also contain a presentation by the State concerned of its work on the follow-up to the previous review.  Working Group on the UPR  The Working Group on the UPR is composed by the 47 Member States of the HRC, chaired by the HRC President and conducts country reviews. The Working Group held its first review in 2008. It allocates three and a half hours to each review, 70 minutes of which is given to the State under review to discuss its domestic human rights framework, measures taken to promote and protect human rights in country, human rights issues of particular national pertinence, and steps taken to address and redress violations. It is also an opportunity for the State to present voluntary human rights pledges and commitments. An interactive dialogue of 140 minutes follows the State's presentation, during which UN member States question the State and make recommendations towards the improvement of its human rights situation and performance. It is worth noting that all 193 UN member states (both HRC members and not) can take the floor. A wide variety of issues have been addressed during the country reviews and potentially all human rights issues could be addressed during this session. While the counting of the actual number of recommendations is complicated by the fact that they are clustered together in the Working Group report, the NGO UPR Info has calculated the first cycle of the UPR to have provided a total of 21,356 recommendations and 599 voluntary pledges.  The role of the Troika and drafting of the Working Group report  Each review is facilitated by a group of three States, known as the ‚Äútroika‚Äù, that serve as rapporteurs. The troika is responsible for receiving the advanced questions from UN member States to the country under review. The second role of the troika is to prepare an outcome document on the review, which includes a summary of the review proceedings, recommendations suggested by States, conclusions, and voluntary commitments presented by the State under review. The outcome document is prepared with the assistance of the UPR secretariat and the recommendations contained in the outcome of the review should preferably be clustered thematically with the full involvement and consent of the State under review and the States that made the recommendations.\\"Review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council\\" at 4.  Adoption  Thirty minutes are allocated to the adoption of the outcome document at a later stage in the same Working Group session, during which the State under review is given a preliminary opportunity to indicate whether it supports the recommendations suggested to it by States as well as the conclusions reflected in the outcome document. Once adopted, the outcome document is transferred to the HRC for discussion and adoption in plenary. In the intervening period between the Working Group and plenary sessions, the reviewed State is expected to confirm which UPR recommendations it accepts and does not accept.  HRC plenary session  The UPR is a standing item on the HRC's agenda (item 6). At each HRC session, time is allocated to the consideration and adoption of the outcome documents transferred from the Working Group on the UPR. An hour is allocated to the adoption of each document, during which the reviewed State is offered the opportunity to present replies to questions or issues not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue at the Working Group.Annex to resolution 5/1, para. 29. HRC member and observer States are also given the opportunity to express their views on the outcome of the review before the HRC takes action on it.Annex to resolution 5/1, para. 30. NHRIs with ‚ÄòA‚Äô statusNHRIs accredited by the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions(ICC) as compliant with the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (Paris Principles). and NGOs in consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) have the opportunity to make ‚Äògeneral comments‚Äô before the adoption of the outcome report.Annex to resolution 5/1, para. 31. This is the only opportunity for civil society to take the floor during the UPR.  Follow-up to UPR outcome  While the outcome of the review, as a cooperative mechanism, should be implemented primarily by the State concerned, States are encouraged to conduct broad consultations with all relevant stakeholders in this regard. States are encouraged to provide the Council, on a voluntary basis, with a midterm update on follow-up to accepted recommendations. As of 20 February 2013, 28 countries so far have provided the HRC with an implementation report.\\"UPR Implementation\\" According to Resolution 16/21, other relevant stakeholders are encouraged to include information on the follow-up to the preceding review in their contributions. The summary of the information provided by other relevant stakeholders should contain, where appropriate, a separate section for contributions by the national human rights institution of the State under review that is accredited in full compliance with the Paris Principles. The Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, established by the Council in its resolution 6/17, should be strengthened and operationalized in order to provide a source of financial and technical assistance to help countries to implement the recommendations emanating from their review. States may request the United Nations representation at the national or regional level to assist them in the implementation of the follow-up to their review. Financial and technical assistance for the implementation of the review should support national needs and priorities, as may be reflected in national implementation plans. The NGO UPR Info has from 2011 to 2014 undertaken 165 assessments at a two-years distance after the review in order to see how the recommendations (the main UPR outcome) are implemented,The Follow-up Programme on UPR recommendations and what is the real effect of the UPR on the ground. In 2012 it published its first study on the assessment of these implementations by 66 countries. A second publication followed in 2014, titled Beyond Promises, assessed 165 countries and shared best practices observed from States, NHRIs, and NGOs. A third publication, released in 2016 and dubbed The Butterfly Effect, aimed to spread UPR best practices and inspire all actors.  State non-cooperation with the UPR  After exhausting all efforts to encourage a State to cooperate with the UPR mechanism, the HRC will address, as appropriate, cases of persistent non-cooperation with the mechanism.Annex to resolution 5/1, para. 38. The first case where persistent non-cooperation was discussed is Israel's UPR. Israel was not reviewed as scheduled on 29 January 2013. As a consequence, the HRC discussed in March and June 2013 the issue of \\"persistent non-cooperation\\". Eventually, Israel resumed its cooperation with the HRC and was reviewed on 29 October 2013, but the HRC missed the opportunity to define what \\"persistent non-cooperation\\" is.  Stakeholders UPR contribution opportunities  The rules governing the participation of NHRIs and NGOs at the HRC, and therefore in the UPR mechanism, are prescribed by resolution 5/1, which states that their participation shall be based on the ‚Äòpractices observed by the [former] Commission on Human Rights, while ensuring the most effective contribution of these entities‚Äô.Annex to resolution 5/1, at rule 7. Resolution 5/1 also stipulates that NGO participation is to be informed by Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31 of 25 July 1996, and NHRI participation by CHR resolution 2005/74 of 20 April 2005. While the UPR is an intergovernmental process, a number of opportunities for contribution are available to non-governmental stakeholders. These include: * Participating in national consultations for the preparation of a State's national report. States are encouraged to undertake broad national consultation processes towards the preparation of their national reports * Submitting information to State reviews. Submissions may be incorporated into the OHCHR-prepared summary of stakeholders‚Äô information discussed above * Attending the review of the State at the Working Group on the UPR. Stakeholders may attend Working Group sessions, but cannot participate in the interactive dialogue * Attending the HRC session at which the outcome report on a State is adopted. ‚ÄòA‚Äô status NHRIs and ECOSOC-accredited NGOs may make ‚Äògeneral comments‚Äô before the adoption of the outcome report * Submitting written statements under HRC agenda item 6 (UPR). NHRIs and ECOSOC-accredited NGOs can submit written statements * When appropriate, working on the follow-up of UPR recommendations  HRC review process  In resolution 60/251, the General Assembly required the HRC to review and report on its work and functioning after its first five years.General Assembly resolution 60/251 at operative para. 16. In October 2009, the HRC established the open-ended intergovernmental working group on the review of the work and functioning of the HRC (composed by the 47 member States of the HRC) to lead its review process.HRC resolution 12/1 of 12 October 2009, ‚ÄòOpen-ended intergovernmental working group on the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council‚Äô. Chaired by the then HRC President (Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow of Thailand), the Working Group met for two substantive sessions. The first Working Group session took place on 25‚Äì29 October 2010; the second session was held on 7, 17-18, and 23‚Äì24 February 2011. On 25 March 2011, the HRC adopted as resolution 16/21 the outcome of its review of the work and functioning of the HRC, later followed by HRC decision 17/119 of 19 July 2011 with the following changes to the UPR:\\"New UPR Modalities for the Second Cycle\\" * Length of the next cycles: The second and subsequent cycles will last 4.5 years with 14 sessions per cycle * Number of States per session : 14 States will be reviewed per session, in a total of 42 states per year * Duration of the review : Each country review will last 3.5 hours. The State under Review (SuR) will be given 70 minutes and other States 140 minutes * Order of review: The order of review will be exactly the same. As there will be only by 14 States reviewed per session, the two last States of session 1 will be moved to the beginning of session 2, the last four of session 2 will be moved to the beginning of session 3, etc. * Focus of the next cycles: The second and subsequent cycles of the review should focus on, inter alia, the implementation of the accepted recommendations and the developments of the human rights situation in the SuR * List of speakers: For each review, States will be arranged in English alphabetical order and the first state of the list will be drawn by lot. States will be able to swap place and all States will be given the floor. If needed be, time per speakers will be reduced to two minutes each or the 140 minutes will be divided by the number of speakers. * General guidelines: The General Guidelines Decision A/HRC/DEC/6/102 for the drafting of the three reports that form the basis of the review were slightly modified to give greater emphasis on the need for States to report on the implementation of recommendations * Clustering of recommendations: The recommendations contained in the UPR outcome document should preferably be clustered thematically, with the full involvement and consent of the State under review and the States that made the recommendations * Responses to recommendations: States should clearly communicate to the Council, in a written format preferably prior to the Council plenary, its positions on all received recommendations * Mid-term reports: States are encouraged to provide the Council, on a voluntary basis, with a midterm update on follow-up to accepted recommendations * Role of National human rights institutions : National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) with A status will have a dedicated section in the summary of other stakeholders‚Äô information and will be given the floor directly after the SuR during the adoption at the HRC plenary session * Role of NGOs : States are encouraged to conduct broad consultations with all relevant stakeholders on the follow-up.

Population structure, distribution and abundance of three commercial species of sea cucumber (Echinodermata) in Panama. Caribbean Journal of Science, 38: 230‚Äì238. Diet Holothuria mexicana feeds on sediments at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, specifically consuming organic matter such as algae, tiny aquatic organisms and waste materials. Metals, such as copper, nickel, lead and zinc associated with coastal pollution, can bioaccumulate within H. mexicana tissues. Therefore, this species has been suggested as a biological indicator for these metals.Laboy-Nieves, E.N., J.E., Conde. 2001. Metal levels in eviscerated tissue of shallow-water deposit- feeding holothurians. Hydrobiologia, 459: 19‚Äì26. Predation Holothuria mexicana is a food source for people, and is actively caught for consumption off the shores of Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela. Natural parasites on H. mexicana are bacteria, protozoans and metazoans. The metazoans that commonly feed on these sea cucumbers are turbellarians, gastropods, copepods, crabs and fishes.Eeckhaut, I., Parmentier, E., Becker, P., Gomez da Silva, S., & Jangoux, M. 2004.

Advances in sea cucumber aquaculture and management. FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper. No. 463. Rome, FAO. 2004. pp. 311-325. Reproduction Minimum size at sexual maturity is between to total length and gutted weight, though smaller sexually mature individuals have been found. Holothuria mexicana spawns throughout the year but has peak spawning periods that varies with geography, which may linked to temperature. Spawning occurs from May to July in Panama, August to September in Florida, and September to October in Cura√ßao. During spawning, females forcefully expel all their eggs into the water in a single burst from their gonopore (the opening where gametes are released). Both males and females sometimes wave their tentacles around during spawning which may aid in fertilization by mixing the sperm and eggs.Mosher, C. 1982.

The auricularia-to-doliolaria transformation in two aspidochirote holothurians, Holothuria mexicana and Stichopus californicus. Invertebrate Biology. 119 (4): 421-432. Fishery Sea cucumbers are fished by snorkelling or surface-supplied diving for human consumption. Although some species are fished for local consumption, most species are exported to China where it is considered an important health food. The ease to catch sea cucumbers, high commercial value and slow recruitment rates have led to global declines in sea cucumber populations and fisheries on less commercially valuable species.Conand, C., S. Uthicke. 2005. Local examples of beche-de-mer overfishing: An initial summary and request for information. SPC Beche-de-mer Information Bulletin. 21: 9-14. There are fisheries for H. mexicana in Panama, Nicaragua and Venezuela. In Panama, the species has a low economic value due to its tough and rigid texture but is fished because of decline of other commercial sea cucumbers. In 1997, 25 fishers took part in a 30-day fishing period where over 750 000 sea cucumbers of three species (H. mexicana, Isostichopus badionotus, Astichopus multifidus) were caught. Sea cucumber fishing is now banned in Panama but illegal fishing has been reported. Holothuria mexicana have small population sizes and were in high risk of collapse in the area if the same level of fishing had continued. In Venezuela, the sea cucumber fishery began in 1991-1992 but was shut down by 1995 due to poor fisheries regulation. Illegal fishing continued, however, as 500 kg of H. mexicana worth US$150,000 was confiscated in the Archipelago Los Roques National Park in 1996. In 2005, China had reported that 0.5 tonnes of sea cucumber were imported from Venezuela.

Cathy Come Home or Up the Junction this was not. All that said, and those naysayers did have a point, funnily enough this has aged rather better than might have been expected since it conforms to the Swinging Sixties stereotype fairly comfortably; though it remained a shade artificial as an experience as a nostalgia piece it came across very well, and much of that was down to the central relationship.\\" References External links * Category:1969 films Category:1969 comedy films Category:British films Category:British comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Patrick Williams Category:Films directed by Desmond Davis Category:British pregnancy films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films shot in London Category:Embassy Pictures films ","title":"A Nice Girl Like Me"},{"id":"26177673","text":"Jack Witikka (20 December 1916 - 28 January 2002; surname until 1942 Jakobsson) was a Finnish film director and screenwriter.

The neighborhood is bounded by Clarendon Drive on the north, Wright Street on the south, Oak Cliff Boulevard on the east and Hampton Road on the west. Established in 1924, Hampton Hills is made up of about 300 wood-frame bungalows, brick and stone Tudor homes and post-war cottages that constitute one of the most undisturbed stands of original architecture in the city of Dallas. History On Sept. 14, 1924, an advertisement The Dallas Morning News, Sept. 14, 1924. appeared in The Dallas Morning News announcing the development of Hampton Hills. The new neighborhood would be accessible to the city of Dallas via the Oak Cliff streetcar line, and would have every \\"modern improvement,\\" including \\"permanently paved streets, sewerage, water, gas, lights, etc.\\" By November, an ad campaign was launched, aimed at the tradespeople and middle managers of local companies who were interested in moving into the area for its convenience and proximity to their employers. Billed as \\"Oak Cliff's Ideal Home Place,\\" The Dallas Morning News, Nov. 21, 1924. Hampton Hills boasted terraced lots, extra wide parkways and well-drained high ground. The neighborhood's developer, Alf W. Sanders, built his own home at 1322 Montreal Ave., and set up a sales office for his Hampton Hills Realty Company in a small Tudor-style building on Tilton (now Wilton) Street. The sales office still stands today. A Dallas Morning News item The Dallas Morning News, Nov. 16, 1924. on Nov. 16, 1924, announced a \\"completely developed subdivision\\" on the new Hampton Place streetcar line. Hampton Hills Realty Company ads emphasized the neighborhood's convenience,The Dallas Morning News, Nov. 22, 1924. commanding viewThe Dallas Morning News, Nov. 23, 1924 and unmatched value.The Dallas Morning News, Nov. 25, 1924. The ad blitz culminated with the \\"tag sale\\" adThe Dallas Morning News, Nov. 27, 1924. on Thanksgiving Day, which drew attention to the neighborhood's proximity to streetcars and schools. A.W. Sanders went on to build many of the neighborhood homes in the craftsman and Tudor styles, with small garages standing behind them. The picturesque wood-sided and brick and stone cottages had a charming, storybook quality about them. Even today, fine examples of stained glass can be seen in many windows, as well as unique brick and stone work. Many interiors boast archways, hardwood flooring, cheerful bathrooms and galley kitchens with quaint breakfast rooms and built-in cabinetry sparkling with beveled mirrors and stained glass. Some fireplace mantels display multiple types of wood and are flanked by built-in bookcases, which were favorite gestures of the builder. Homebuilding was curtailed during World War II (because of strict rationing of materials for the war effort), creating a housing shortage for returning soldiers and their families. To help address the crisis, Oak Cliff realtor and builder Wiley Roberts, who also served as executive board chairman of the Dallas Association of Home Builders, announced his intention to finish out the Hampton Hills neighborhood. On Oct 5, 1945, The Dallas Morning News, Oct. 5, 1945. Roberts said he would build 25 new brick homes in Hampton Hills, averaging around $8,000 each. On Aug. 11, 1946, The Dallas Morning News, Aug. 11, 1946. The Dallas Morning News reported that Roberts‚Äô son Bill, a Navy veteran, would join his father in completing 40 new homes The Dallas Morning News, July 12, 1946. in the neighborhood. During the previous decade, home styles had evolved to include minimal traditional, which incorporated Colonial and Tudor forms with a modern preference for as little ornamentation as possible. Consequently, Wiley Roberts and Sons built finely crafted cottages with shallow- to medium-pitched gabled or hipped roofs (usually with no eaves), small covered porches with simple pillars or columns, simple floor plans and occasionally corner-wrapped windows. These post-war homes are mostly asymmetrical with the front entrance off center, and with either attached or detached garages. And because they were the last homes to be built in Hampton Hills, they tend to occupy the corner lots. In February 1951, the newly organized Hampton Hills Garden Club began meeting in the little chapel at Rosemont Christian Church. Meetings usually featured a speaker and a social. The club seems to have disbanded in late 1976. In 1990, a group of residents formed the Hampton Hills Neighborhood Association Hampton Hills Neighborhood Association to safeguard the neighborhood's architectural integrity and to enhance the quality of life for every resident. The group meets monthly at Rosemont Christian Church. Notable residents Among Hampton Hills' most notable residents was Laster Baskem Bruton, who came to Dallas in the late 1920s to establish the Southwest Division of the Hygienics Products Company. In 1928, he and his wife, Sarah Estella Stratton Bruton, met with A.W. Sanders to finalize the deal on a newly constructed Tudor-style cottage at 1510 Hollywood Ave. On Oct. 6 of that year, the Brutons welcomed their first and only child, Mary Elizabeth. U.S. Census Bureau, 1930 L.B. Bruton went on to become a respected businessman. He was a Mason and a Methodist. His wife regularly hosted church socials at their home. But beneath the respectable fa√ßade, something wasn't right. Sometime around 1940, the Brutons' carefully crafted image began to unravel. After the Brutons divorced, Laster Bruton married Aeron Burnet in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, in 1942‚Äîthe same day Aeron Burnet divorced her husband, Owen Arther Burnet, whom she had married in 1936. Burnet had recently enlisted in the Navy and agreed that the two should divorce. Bruton had been calling his new bride for dates as early as 1938. The two divorced on Oct. 29, 1945, and she remarried Burnet a short time later. On Feb. 22, 1946, Owen Burnet walked into Bruton's office on the seventh floor of the Texas Bank Building, asking Helen Pryor, Bruton's secretary, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Laster B.?‚Äù When she walked to the door of Bruton's office to announce the visitor, Burnet stepped up behind her and began firing a .32-caliber automatic pistol at Bruton over Pryor's shoulder. Bruton died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head, neck and hips.The Dallas Morning News, Feb. 23, 1946. The murder trial was a sensation.The Dallas Morning News, March 6, 1946. Among those who took the stand were Bruton's brother, Aeron Burnet and Owen Burnet. Burnet's legal team presented a ‚Äútemporary insanity‚Äù defense. They said Bruton had a history of domestic violence, including one incident when he became enraged during an argument and shot at her with a .22-caliber pistol. Bruton missed, but she fainted and he kicked her, she said. A week prior to the killing, Bruton drove alongside the Burnets‚Äô car on Eighth Street in Oak Cliff, opened the door and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you yet,‚Äù then drove away. The following day, District Judge W.L. Thornton granted an order restraining Bruton from \\"molesting or harassing\\" his ex-wife. On the day of the killing, Bruton swerved his car in front of his ex-wife's, forcing it onto the curb between the Triple Underpass and Industrial Boulevard. Then he slapped her and cursed her, she said. Owen Burnet, who was employed as a mechanic at the Singer Sewing Machine Company on Elm Street, took a call from his wife who ‚Äúsounded hysterical.‚Äù After the conversation, Burnet left the building looking \\"pale and determined, but dazed,\\" according to his co-workers. Bruton was gunned down a few minutes later in his office, which was six blocks away. Burnet was found guiltyThe Dallas Morning News, Nov. 24, 1946 of \\"murder without malice\\" and sentenced to five years in prison. The sentence, however, was overturned on appeal.The Dallas Morning News, Oct. 23, 1947 The appeals court said the trial judge should have admitted testimony about Burnet's acts and appearance shortly before he left his office to kill Bruton. Another notable resident was Virgil Oliver Stamps, a gospel singer and promoter who helped make gospel music popular and widely available throughout East Texas and the southern U.S. He is perhaps best known for composing the music to When the Saints Go Marching In. After attending several music schools, he worked James D. Vaughan and ran the Vaughan Publishing Company office in Jacksonville, Texas, from 1915 into the 1920s. In 1924, Stamps opened the V.O. Stamps School of Music in Jacksonville. His friend J.R. Baxter became his business partner and they changed the name of the company to the Stamps-Baxter Music Company in 1927. The company quickly became the nation's premier gospel music business. Its activities included songwriting, publishing and sponsoring musical groups and radio broadcasts. Baxter oversaw the operations east of the Mississippi River, while Stamps ran the operations in the western U.S. from his Dallas headquarters. This early success enabled Stamps and his wife, Addie, to purchase a new home at 1611 Hollywood Ave., where they lived with their teenage son, Ware. Stamps-Baxter helped bring gospel music into the mainstream by broadcasting it nationally on radio and by encouraging performance in public. Stamps and his quartet started a noonday radio program on KRLD radio in Dallas in 1936. The program brought him, the company and gospel music increasingly into public view. The radio program was so successful that it enabled Stamps-Baxter to become the most successful publisher of shape-note music in America. The company's annual Stamps-Baxter School of Music stood as the largest developer of gospel singers in Texas and throughout the south well into the 1950s. Stamps died of heart disease on Aug. 19, 1940. His funeral was attended by thousands. In 1973, he was inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame. The Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame inducted Stamps in 1997. He has also been honored in the Texas Gospel Music Hall of Fame as a pioneer of gospel music.

Early life Beanland was born in Durham Lead near Ballarat, Victoria in 1866. His parents were John Griffith Beanland (1844‚Äì1875) and Elizabeth Pickering (1845‚Äì1923). The Beanlands were a prominent family in Williamstown near Melbourne, where John Walton lived for about 20 years. He was the eldest of six children. On 18 October 1889, he married Mary Ann Hick and they had two sons: Arnold White Beanland (born 1889) and Walton Howard Beanland (born 1890). His three brothers all married sisters of his wife. Life in New Zealand Beanland built the first three storeys of the Nurses' Hostel Beanland was a master builder, and the family came to Christchurch during a time of depression in Victoria in the early 1890s. His name first appeared in the Christchurch newspaper The Star in 1899, when he was elected onto the committee of the model yacht club. His brother, William Henry Beanland (1874‚Äì1960), was also a building contractor in Christchurch. Beanland won the contract to build the first stage of the Nurses' Hostel for ¬£54,990. This allowed for the first three storeys of the building on Riccarton Avenue next to Christchurch Hospital, and construction started in 1931. Beanland was a trustee on the Board of Trustees of the Riccarton Bush from 1919 to 1921. Political career In April 1909, Beanland was elected onto the St Albans School Committee and in 1913, he was elected chairman. He became the president of the St Albans Library Committee. In 1911, Beanland travelled to England to attend the coronation of George V, followed by several months of travel for pleasure. Beanland was narrowly defeated in January 1912 when he stood for the St Albans seat of the Drainage Board. He was first elected to Christchurch City Council in 1914 in the St Albans ward for the conservative-leaning Citizens' Association. For several years, he chaired the works committee of Christchurch City Council. He first became deputy mayor after the 1919 mayoral election, and was the second person to hold that post. At the same election, Henry Thacker was first elected as mayor. The next mayoral election was held on Wednesday, 27 April 1921, and the two candidates were Thacker and Beanland. Thacker received 7,580 votes, a majority of 292 votes over the 7,288 votes for Beanland. Beanland had stood for the mayoralty only, and this ended his first period on Christchurch City Council. Beanland was again elected as a Christchurch city councillor in the 26 April 1923 local election, receiving the second highest number of first preference votes after Rev John Archer. In October 1924, Beanland announced that he would contest the next mayoral election in April 1925, and that he would not stand for re-election for the Christchurch Tramway Board, so that he had sufficient time for the mayoralty. Beanland claimed that he should have the official support of the Citizen's Association, although the incumbent, James Arthur Flesher, also belonged to the Citizen's Association and intended to stand again. Beanland claimed that he had been persuaded in 1923 to not stand for the mayoralty, and that he would in turn receive the support of the Citizens' Association in 1925. This situation apparently caused great friction within the Citizens' Association, but all rumours to this effect were categorically denied. The situation got worse when the Citizens' Association issued a statement to The Press: > The Association has always considered Mr Beanland to be lacking in qualities > needed in the Mayor of a city of this size and importance. For that reason > it has refused to support him for the Mayoralty on three occasions. It > believes Mr Beanland to be a useful member of a Council or a Board. For > offices such as these it is ready to support him, but not for the Mayoralty. In the end, four candidates contested the election: the incumbent, James Arthur Flesher, as the official candidate of the Citizens' Association, Beanland and Joseph Hamlets as independents, and John Archer for the Labour Party. The Citizens' Association vote was split between Flesher and Beanland, and Archer had a majority of some 1100 votes over the incumbent. Beanland contested the electorate in the for the Reform Party, but was beaten by Labour's James McCombs. In 1934, he embarked on a six months trip that took him to Australia, England and Germany. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. In February 1936, the mayor of Christchurch, Dan Sullivan, resigned from the mayoralty after he had been appointed by the Labour government as a cabinet minister. Beanland, who was deputy-mayor at the time, contested the resulting by-election and narrowly won against former mayor and Labour candidate John Archer; this brought to an end 11 years of Labour candidates winning the mayoralty. Beanland was sworn in on 16 March. At the end of the mayoral term, the Citizens' Association chose Dr. John Guthrie as their mayoral candidate. Beanland had also sought the nomination but was not successful. Beanland stood as a city councillor and was narrowly returned; he was 15th for the 16 positions, and only three votes ahead of the candidate in 17th place. The new mayor and councillors were installed on 18 May 1938. Beanland retired at the end of the term in 1941. Death Beanland Avenue in Spreydon Mary Beanland died on 8 August 1941. He died on 7 December 1943 at his residence at 237 Edgeware Road in the Christchurch suburb of St Albans. He was survived by their two sons. The family grave is at Bromley Cemetery and holds Mary and John Beanland, the wife of their son Walton, and a grandchild. Beanland Avenue in the Christchurch suburb of Spreydon is named in his honour. The street name was suggested by the Director of Housing Construction for the government housing project, and approved by the Christchurch City Council in April 1938.

BWV 532.1 (previously 532/2a) is an earlier version of the Fugue. History  The Fugue in D major, BWV 532a, was composed around 1708.http://www.berndkolb.ch/Bachseite/BWV501-600/BWV532a_engl.htm It is an earlier version of fugue of BWV 532\\\\. Not much is known about this fugue, other than that it was composed around 2 years before the Prelude and Fugue in D Major, and was written and premiered in Weimar. Also BWV 532 was written during Bach's tenure in Weimar: it was composed between 1709 and 1717. Many of his greatest and most well known organ works were written during this period, including, for example, the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. The composer was residing in Weimar after being hired by the ruling duke of Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst, in 1709 as an organist and member of the court orchestra; he was particularly encouraged to make use of his unique talents with the organ by the duke. Indeed, his fame on the instrument grew and he was visited by many students of the organ to hear him play and to try to learn from his technique. The Prelude and Fugue in D major was probably composed in 1710, although this is not certain. What we do know is that BWV 532 features a lengthy, complex, self-contained fugue preceded by a multisectional prelude. Thus it must have been written before Bach codified the clear two-section prelude and fugue form used in The Well-Tempered Clavier, which was composed in 1722. Structure The piece is in two sections: a prelude and a fugue. Both the sections are in D major but, to begin with, there is no tempo marking given on either section. Both pieces are in 4/4. Prelude The prelude commences with a semi-quaver scale from the pedals, and then the manuals begin with an intricate quaver pattern between the hands. Another run from the pedals is then followed by a continuation of the quaver pattern from the right-hand. The quaver pattern then repeats one octave lower. The pedals then play arpeggiated patterns which begin a repeated theme and slow down throughout. This lasts for four bars. A sustained pedal then accompanies the manuals, which have a dotted quaver, semi-quaver rhythm. This then turns into a repeated G‚ôØ, B demi-semi-quaver rhythm. This then slows to a series of repeated cadences. A new phrase then begins with an ascending scale in the manuals leading up to a large D major chord. A new tempo is then introduced: Alla breve, and then a large phrase is introduced with a very polyphonic texture and a prominent tune. A section then starts with chords played in the manuals and the quavers played in the pedals. This continues for another long period of time until the left hand takes the tune and the right hand plays the quavers. When this section finishes, a new tempo of Adagio begins. A new theme then arrives with slow quavers on the lower manual and pedal and ascending scales in the upper manual. The prelude then concludes with a slow theme, on broken arpeggios and some slow, elongated final chords. Fugue The subject of this fugue is eight measures long and consists of tight figurations encompassing an entire octave. Bach takes this subject firstly through the relative minor and then the mediant minor, and then to the minor harmony of the leading tone and the major harmony on the supertonic. After this progression we enter an episode with a flurry of figures on the dominant and then a full entry of the subject on the tonic that works to resolve the preceding tension so well that the eventual coda almost has the nature of an afterthought. The Fugue's subject, showing a turn-like motif followed by a falling sequence The subjects of both the BWV 532a and 532 fugues are identical, as well are the counter-subject introduction in the alto voice, and then also in the tenor voice. The fugue in BWV 532a is identical to the one of BWV 532 until the 28th measure (7 measures after the introduction of the subject in the pedals). Transcriptions This work has been transcribed for solo piano by Ferruccio Busoni as BV B 20 in 1888, and by Eugen d'Albert in 1893.

Lithgow's first media job was as a broadcaster for Radio Television Brunei during the 1970s. During the 1980s, she moved to Britain. After working as a presenter for Midlands Today and a continuity announcer for Granada Television, Lithgow moved to London as a newsreader for the national BBC News in 1988. Lithgow joined the BBC's world television service on its launch in 1991 and also presented BBC 2's Newsview. Lithgow was the first BBC newsreader to announce the resignation of Margaret Thatcher around 9:45 AM, interrupting an edition of People Today, on 22 November 1990. Lithgow quit the BBC in 1996 upon gaining a law degree from Oxford University. She subsequently moved to the business news channel CNBC Asia (based in Singapore), where she worked until her death in Trinidad in December 2001. Murder Lithgow was murdered, along with her 83-year-old mother, Maggie Lee, and her British brother-in-law, John Cropper, at the family home in Port of Spain. The family had just enjoyed a tea party when bandits struck. The family was found with their hands bound and their throats cut. A detective who was granted anonymity due to a rule forbidding police from contacting the media during an investigation called the murder scene \\"the most brutal and grisly\\" he had ever seen, adding in a statement to the BBC, \\"I have visited a number of scenes in my career, but I never see anything as brutal or grisly as that.\\" While earlier reports stated that a \\"group of bandits\\" had ambushed the home, only two men were ever arrested and charged for their involvement in the crime: Lester Pittman and Daniel Agard. Both were convicted of murder, and both were immediately sentenced to death in 2004, as murder convictions come with a mandatory death sentence in Trinidad and Tobago. After repeatedly appealing the sentences, both Pittman and Agard had their sentences overturned in March 2010 due to the fact that the law in Trinidad and Tobago prohibited the executions of prisoners who had spent more than five years on death row. In December 2013, both were re-sentenced to a minimum of 40 years in prison. Personal life Lynette Lithgow was married twice and had two children from her first marriage. Her second marriage, from 1998 until her death, was to Dominic Pearson. In 2005, the Harvard Kennedy School established a fund in Lithgow's honor to support students interested in journalism.

The film is based on the 1952 John Masters novel of the same name regarding the murderous Thuggee of India. Plot The film takes place in 1825 India. The country is being ravaged by Thuggees, a Kali-worshiping cult also known as \\"Deceivers\\", who commit robbery and ritualistic murder. Captain William Savage, an honorable district administrator for the East India Company, is informed by his subjects in Madhia about the Thugees' murder raids, and appalled, he opens a manhunt on them. He manages to capture a Thugee named Hussein and win his cooperation, but for acting on his own initiative, Savage's chief officer and father-in- law, Colonel Wilson, stubbornly adhering to Company protocol, dismisses his report and relieves him of his duty. Chagrined but determined, Savage decides to disguise himself as an imprisoned native outlaw, Gopal the Weaver, and get introduced into the Thugee cult by Hussein, with only his wife Sarah knowing about his plan. He is accepted, and after a period of training he is forced to participate in their raids, though he strives to avoid killing anyone personally. One day, however, Gopal appears at the fortress, revealing himself as a Thuggee, and in order to avoid being exposed, Savage is forced to kill him. This awakens in him a dark, ecstatic fascination for killing. Savage also discovers that certain East Indian Company officials know about the Thuggees' activities but let them pass through their districts in exchange for a share of their ill-gotten plunder. Fearing for Savage's safety, Hussein flees to inform Sarah of her husband's situation; but Thuggee infiltrators in the Company overhear them and capture Hussein before he can return to the fortress. With Savage's secret thus exposed, but with the Thuggees willing to accept him as one of their own, Savage is instructed to kill Hussein. Taking one of the Thuggees' children hostage, he forces his way out of the fortress, but Hussein is shot dead before he can get away. Savage flees into a field of reeds, where the Thuggees encircle him; but before they can kill him, East India Company troopers, alerted by Sarah, arrive and defeat the Thuggees. Rehabilitated and promoted to colonel, Savage receives the official task of eradicating the Thuggee cult throughout India, although Savage must now struggle with the mental scars his time with the Thuggees and their bloodthirsty ways have left on him.

Kalla as The Nawab's Servant *Rajesh Vivek *Kammo as Official Original Novel John Masters' original novel was published in 1952. It was his second novel, following Nightrunners to Bengal. \\"It offers color and violence in large gobs\\" said the Washington Post. The New York Times called it \\"an unfocused work that never comes to grips with its material.\\" The novel was adapted for radio by the BBC in 1984. Production Development In 1957 it was announced John Bryan would produce a film of the novel for the Rank Organization with Masters writing the screenplay. The film was not made. In 1974 Stanley Donen announced he had the rights and wanted to make \\"the kind of movie I've never made before ‚Äì a big sprawling epic.\\" He did not make it either. Film rights passed to Merchant Ivory Productions. \\"It's completely different for us\\", said producer Ismail Merchant. \\"We're known for doing E.M. Forster and Henry James. Deceivers is in the same genre as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Which is certainly a switch.\\" Mechant later said he made it to \\"keep the production company moving\\". In 1984 Michael White was reportedly working on the film. Development took ten years. Original directors were Marek Kanievska and Stephen Frears. Then Merchant approached writer and director Nicholas Meyer‚Äîfresh off his work on Volunteers and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home‚Äîthrough Meyer's agent about directing The Deceivers. Meyer reportedly agreed to a substantial pay cut in order to direct the film, remarking, \\"Hollywood is making films I have no interest in seeing, machined tooled, packaged, with a lot of numbers after their names. The studios don't just want home runs. They want grand slams. Anything less than $100 million is not interesting to them.\\" \\"It's strictly action-adventure = a 'cavalry to the rescue' type film\\", said Meyer. Casting Christopher Reeve and Treat Williams were originally considered for the part of William Savage, but Meyer successfully lobbied to have an actual Englishman in the role. In his memoir The View from the Bridge, Meyer wrote, \\"'Here's a story about an Englishman who disguises himself as an Indian,' I reasoned. 'If you cast this actor, you will have an American disguising himself as an Englishman, disguising himself as an Indian. We will be lost in the stunt, even if he pulls it off, and not pay attention to the story and the things we want to take for granted, i.e., that it concerns an Englishman.'\\" The part ultimately went to Pierce Brosnan, whom Meyer fondly described as \\"Errol Flynn‚Äîwith talent.\\" Brosnan had just missed the chance to play James Bond due to his commitments to Remington Steele. His casting was announced in April 1987. \\"I play an Englishman, a glorified accountant working for the East India Trading Co.\\", said Brosnan. \\"He discovers this cult and disguises himself as an Indian. He goes on the road with the Thugs, who kill people by strangulation.\\" Filming Shooting took place over a four-month period in India, in Jaipur, Agra and Khajuraho, while post-production was completed in London. Filming started 21 September 1987. Filming was marred with difficulties from the onset. According to Meyer, the production was subject to frequent disruption from the local Jaipur mafia for declining to make any dealings with their leader. Meyer wrote, \\"Scores of hooligans stormed through our sets while we were rolling; equipment was sabotaged or stolen; 'cultural' societies were founded for the sole purpose of suing us, alleging pornographic distortions of Indian culture.\\" The filmmakers were criticised by social and political groups who felt it distorted Hindu religion and culture. The producers argued it was \\"a pure and simple thriller\\". At one point, Ismail Merchant and co-producer Tim Van Rellim were arrested for \\"obscenity and misrepresentation of Hindu culture.\\" Among the allegations was that the production filmed a sati as one really happened. Merchant responded to the allegations with disgust, saying, \\"What happened was a mockery‚Äîpeople taking advantage of democratic principles in order to whip up a frenzy.\\" Associate producer Paul Bradley said the charge came from a politically well-connected Jaipur businessman who was unhappy at the depiction of Kali and the subplot about suttee. \\"The script has already been submitted to and passed by the Indian government\\", said Bradley. \\"Any film made in India, certainly by a foreign company, has to be vetted and passed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.\\" Bradley said the businessman and some film workers had been \\"pressuring the production company to employ them at exorbitant rates.\\" Despite the disruptions, Meyer spoke highly of his Indian production crew, stating, \\"One day when we needed our tulip crane for a big shot, I was flummoxed to learn that four of its bolts had been stolen, incapacitating a vital piece of equipment. I don't deal well with last minute alterations to The Plan, but my Indian crew managed to mill four new bolts by the time we were ready to roll.\\" Reception Box office The Deceivers was not a box office success. The film earned only $346,297 in the North American market against an estimated $5‚Äì6 million budget. Critical response The Deceivers was released on 2 September 1988 and received mostly negative reviews from film critics. The film currently has a 33% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 6 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a mediocre review and stated that, \\"Despite the film's claims to be based on fact, I didn't believe it for a moment. I did, however, enjoy it at various moments. Brosnan disappears so completely into the leading role that he hardly seems present in the movie, and the film's portrait of Victorian India is a triumph (the production was designed by the British master of period atmosphere, Tony Adams). It looks great even at its most incredible.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times also thought negatively of the film, stating \\"The tinniness of Michael Hirst's screenplay (It's older than time and just as mysterious) hardly helps bring this material to life, any more than Mr. Brosnan's unconvincing and (despite several episodes in which he proves himself capable of violent killing) rather passive performance.\\" Maslin then went on to say that, \\"In its own way, The Deceivers is oddly old-fashioned.\\" Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called it \\"an adventure epic with a pretty measly sense of adventure.\\" He added, \\"There are a few patches of exotic fun, like the opening murder scene, and there's a seductive campfire dance by a young boy that's creepy enough to send chills (though perhaps inadvertently). But for the most part all we react to is the squandering of a good idea.\\" Conversely, Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film modest praise, saying it \\"casts quite a spell, combining supernatural overtones with scenes of shootings, stabbings and (especially) strangulations. Without being crude or exploitative it tells its story in a modest, old-fashioned way with no reliance on gratuitous gore.\\" Home media The Deceivers was released on DVD through The Criterion Collection.The Deceivers: Nicholas Meyer.

The genus name is derived from the Greek trypano (borer) and soma (body) because of their corkscrew-like motion, and the species name from antiquua (old) reflecting the age of the specimen. All trypanosomes are heteroxenous (requiring more than one obligatory host in order to complete life cycle) or are transmitted through some variation of a vector. The species was described in 2005 by George Poinar Jr. in the journal Vector-Borne & Zoonotic Diseases from metatrypanosomes preserved in several fecal pellets encased in Hymenaea protera amber. The fossil was recovered in the Dominican Republic from early Miocene Burdigalian stage deposits on the island of Hispaniola. Included with the pellets and thought to be the origin for them, is the extinct kissing bug Triatoma dominicana. This association is the oldest known example of the vector association between Triatoma and Trypanosoma. The holotype, deposited in the Oregon State University as specimen number P-3-3, was mined from the La Toca mine in the Dominican Republic. T. dominicana and T. antiquus lived in an environment similar to modern moist tropical rain forests. The preserved metatrypanosomes range in size from 11 to 20 ¬µm with the average length being 15 ¬µm. The species is placed in the Trypanosoma subgenus Schizotrypanum, and is identifiable by age and the average length being shorter than that of other Schizotrypanum species. Based on the contents of the amber specimen including three hematophagous insects, it is likely to have been formed in a tree cavity. Associated with the insects are several mammal hairs from an unidentified Chiropteran, the likely host for T. dominicana. The pellets are thought to have been deposited after the T. dominicana finished feeding on the host bat. Modern bat-hosted trypanosomes in the region are considered a vector for the fatal Chagas disease in humans.

It features pedal steel guitar by B. J. Cole and drums by Kenney Jones of the Faces.Mayes, p. 59  History  The song first appeared on Armatrading's 1976 album Joan Armatrading, which was produced and engineered by Glyn Johns and recorded at the independent Olympic Studios in Barnes, London. It was the first song to be recorded for the album.Mayes, p. 58 \\"Down To Zero\\" was released as a single, also in 1976, by A&M; (\\"Down to Zero/Like Fire\\" ‚Äì AMS 7270), and despite following the success of the top ten single \\"Love and Affection\\" (which had been released in August 1976), it failed to chart. In his review of the album on AllMusic, Dave Connolly cites \\"Down to Zero\\" as \\"[one of] the album's most memorable tracks\\". Women's music writer Lucy O'Brien described the song as \\"a full-tilt rollercoaster ... a masterly analysis of rejection.\\"O'Brien, p.185 Critic Wilfrid Mellers, in his book Angels of the Night, praised the song's \\"jazz intensity\\", achieved he says, through its \\"triplet cross-rhythms\\".Mellers, p. 218 \\"Down To Zero\\" has since been re-released on numerous collections, among them: Live at the Bijou Bijou Club, Philadelphia Superstar Radio Network (1977, promo album); Track Record (1983), Joan Armatrading: Greatest Hits (1987), Joan Armatrading: 25th Anniversary Series (1987), Love And Affection (1996), Joan Armatrading: Master Series# (1999); Joan Armatrading: Millennium Edition (2000); The Best of Joan Armatrading: The Millennium Collection (2000); Joan Armatrading: Best (2001); Classic Joan Armatrading (2001); Love and Affection: Joan Armatrading Classics 1975‚Äì1983 (2003); Live: All the Way from America (2004); Joan Armatrading: Gold (2005). \\"Down To Zero\\" was re-released in July 1990 as a live version on the b-side of the single \\"Promise Land\\" (AM 567) from the album Hearts and Flowers. The single's B-side, \\"Like Fire\\", also appears on the Joan Armatrading album. \\"Down To Zero\\" was used as the theme song for the BBC series Nurse in 2015.  Performances  During the 1970s, Armatrading used the song to open her live concerts, as noted in contemporary reviews.Black Echoes, p.15 She used \\"Down to Zero\\" to open her live seminal concert for German TV (Studio L in Cologne) on 15 February 1979, accompanied by a band especially put together for the tour. The band featured Red Young on keyboards, Rick Hirsch on guitar, Art Rodriguez on drums, Bill Bodine on bass and Lon Price on saxophone. The concert was recorded by WDR and features on the DVD Steppin' Out. Armatrading played the song again, this time as the second opener, with the same band, live at the Rockpalast in Grugahalle, Essen, Germany on 19 and 20 April 1980, in another concert recorded live and featuring on the Steppin' Out DVD. It was during the fourteen months between these two concerts that she became internationally famous, and \\"Down to Zero\\" helped her to achieve this. The band that played with her at these concerts went on to perform with her on subsequent tours. On 5 October 1976 Armatrading performed the song on BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test, introduced by Bob Harris. Armatrading has included the song in many of her shows, almost as often as her top 10 hit \\"Love and Affection\\". She played it on her live concert tour for her 2003 album Lovers Speak; recordings from that tour were released on the CD/DVD album Live: All the Way from America in 2004. Following this she rested the song, until including it once again in her 2012 Starlight tour. On 27 April 2016, Armatrading was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and played \\"Down to Zero\\" at the ceremony.  Covers  \\"Down to Zero\\" was recorded by soul and blues singer Bettye LaVette and issued on her 2005 album I've Got My Own Hell to Raise. The song was also recorded by Lili A√±el and issued on her 2007 album Dream Again and later also released, by ESC Records, on her album Life or Death. The American singer Melissa Etheridge regularly covered the song live when she appeared in clubs in California in the 1980s ‚Äì one of many Armatrading songs she included in her live repertoire. The Irish singer Freddie White performed \\"Down to Zero\\" in concert, and his rendition can be found on his 1979 live album Recorded Live on Tour 1978.

Furthermore, any interference leads to a personal right of a member to sue in his own name to enforce his right. As Lord Jessel MR put it, a member: Facts The articles of association of the Direct United States Cable Company Ltd, registered under the Companies Act 1862 provided that no member would be allowed to vote on more than 100 shares at any meeting, and each block of ten shares was counted as one vote. It also provided that \\"the company shall not be affected with notice of any trust\\", a standard provision in company articles that is meant to allow companies to avoid complications or liability to the ultimate beneficiaries of shares. Mr John Pender had bought 1000 shares. He was also chairman of Globe Telegraph and Trust Company Ltd, a holding company of a large group with competitors to the Direct United States Cable Company. Mr Pender had split his votes and registered the holders under the names of a number of nominees. After more than three months he then proposed the following motion at a general meeting. > ‚ÄúThat it is expedient to put an end to the present antagonism of this > company towards the Anglo-American Telegraph Company and its connections, > and to work this company's cable in friendly alliance with their lines; and > that a committee of shareholders be appointed to be named by the meeting to > confer with the directors as to the best method of giving effect to this > resolution, and to report to the shareholders thereon at such time as the > meeting shall appoint.‚Äù The opponents to the motion, including the company's directors and the chairman, Mr Lushington, proposed to amend the resolution so it had the opposite effect. Mr Pender and his nominees voted against any amendment and would have won if the votes of the nominees were counted. But Mr Lushington refused to have the nominees votes counted. He, along with other supporters of the motion sued for an injunction. Judgment Lord Jessel MR held that Pender could have an injunction for his vote to be recorded. Pender's vote was a property right which could not be interfered with, nor were the motives in this case such as to make the vote invalid. Furthermore, as a matter of litigation, Pender could sue in the name of the company, as well as in his own name. Interference with a personal right created both a derivative claim and a personal action.

In 1960, he is born with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a mutation that causes him to physically look like a girl, when in fact, he possesses the hormones of a boy. He attends an all-girls school, where he joins the field hockey team. At the school, Calliope falls in love with the Obscure Object. Calliope experiences the \\"bulb\\", which he calls a \\"crocus\\", between his legs erect when he thinks about the Obscure Object. * Chapter Eleven is Calliope's brother. His name plays off how he leads his father's company into bankruptcy. Chapter Eleven refers to the United States bankruptcy law of the same name. * Clementine Stark is the girl in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, who teaches Calliope how to kiss. * Obscure Object is the girl with whom Calliope falls in love. The term originated from Eugenides' college days at Brown University with Rick Moody. When the two found the same girl alluring, they would refer to her as the \\"Obscure Object\\". She is now an art historian and lives in Toronto, Canada. * Jerome is the Obscure Object's brother. He is the first boy with whom Calliope has sex. * Eleutherios \\"Lefty\\" Stephanides is Calliope's grandfather and Desdemona's husband. He is also Desdemona's brother, and is one year her junior. Desdemona and Lefty grew up in a village called Bithynios in Greece. The two become orphaned, live by themselves and manage the silk farm. Lefty is a bachelor who is unmoved by the seductive techniques employed by the only two marriageable women in the village. In 1922, when the Turks bombard their village, brother and sister move to Smyrna. Upon their arrival at the city, Smyrna is burned and sacked. :The two escape Smyrna by boarding a boat for America. They profess their love for each other and marry on the boat. They immigrate to Detroit and are sponsored by their cousin, Sourmalina, and her husband Jimmy Zizmo. Lefty and Desdemona have two children together, Milton and Zoe. Lefty works for a production plant at the Ford Motor Company. He is fired after Ford's inspectors visit his home and discover that Zizmo is selling contraband. Following his dismissal, Lefty becomes a gangster for a short period of time before later managing a bar which he names the Zebra Room. :In his later life, on the day Cal is born, Lefty has a stroke, losing his ability to speak. Lefty communicates with his family by writing messages on a chalkboard. To pass time, he translates Sappho's works every day. He smokes hashish and listens to rebetika albums. * Desdemona Stephanides is Calliope's grandmother. She is the sister and wife of Lefty. On the eve of their departure for America, she and Lefty professed their love to each other and married on the boat. During her pregnancy with Milton, she learned that children of incest are often born with diseases. She tried to distant herself from Lefty sexually, but after giving birth to Zoe, she completely withheld sex from him. Throughout her life, Desdemona is plagued with the incest which she and her brother have committed. After moving to America, she works for a brief time counseling the young women workers of the Nation of Islam the ideal way to generate silk. :Years later, with her silver spoon, she predicts that Calliope will be a boy. She had never been wrong before. Twenty-three prior guesses were correct. This time, however, she is considered wrong because the doctor thought that Calliope was a female. * Sourmelina \\"Lina\\" (n√©e Pappasdiamondopoulis) Zizmo is the cousin of Lefty and Desdemona. She is married to Jimmy Zizmo. Sourmalina and her husband sponsor Lefty and Desdemona to reach America. A former inhabitant of Bithynios, she was married off to Zizmo after she was noticed in an inappropriate relationship with a married woman. She sponsors Desdemona and Lefty, keeping their incestuous relationship a secret due to her own secret, her former lesbian intrigue in Bithynios. * Jimmy Zizmo is Lina's husband. He abandons her, faking his own death after she gives birth to their first and only child, Theodora (\\"Tessie\\"), Cal's mother, due to his erroneous suspicions that the baby is not his. He reinvents himself as Wallace Fard Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam. * Miltiades \\"Milton\\" Stephanides is Calliope's father. He is the son of Lefty and Desdemona. Milton is Tessie's husband and second cousin. Milton courts Tessie with a clarinet and marries her after fighting in World War II. Milton loses his first business to a fire in the 1967 Detroit riot. The payments he receives from several insurance companies enables him to finance a hot dog chain called Hercules Hot Dogs not only becomes a profitable household name but also turns him into a millionaire. * Theodora \\"Tessie\\" Stephanides is Calliope's mother. She is Milton's wife and second cousin. After having a son, Chapter Eleven, Tessie longs for a daughter. She and Milton plan the lovemaking to be at the appropriate time to exact the desired result. * Zo√´ \\"Aunt Zoe\\" Stephanides is Calliope's aunt and Father Mike's wife. She is the daughter of Lefty and Desdemona. * Michael \\"Father Mike\\" Antoniou is an Orthodox priest who is Tessie's former fianc√©. He is Aunt Zoe's husband, although he is still in love with Tessie. * Nishan Philobosian is an Armenian doctor who is evacuated from Smyrna with Lefty and Desdemona after his family is killed by Turkish soldiers, then becomes the Stephanides family's trusted physician in America. * Marius Wyxzewixard Challouehliczilczese Grimes is an African American who befriends Callie. Marius calls Callie \\"Little Queen of the Nile\\". He is named after an Ethiopian nationalist. By day, Marius supports himself through working at a record store, and by night, he studies at the University of Detroit Law School. Upon graduation, he intends to file a lawsuit against the city of Dearborn for housing discrimination against African Americans. :In one of the central scenes in the novel pertaining to black-white relations, Marius reveals that Callie's father is fearful of African Americans and pays money to the police to protect himself against them. This belief is confirmed when Milton, after seeing Marius talking to Callie, tells her to \\"stay away from people like that\\". Callie sees him for the last time during the 1967 Detroit riot. Marius sets on fire a rag suspended from the aperture of a Molotov cocktail and hurls it into the Zebra Room, a bar owned by Milton. * Peter \\"Uncle Pete\\" Tatakis is a bachelor who attends the Sunday debating sessions at Milton's house. * Peter Luce is a sexologist in New York who is considered a foremost expert on hermaphroditism. Dr. Luce is modeled after the 1970s sexologist, John Money. Both Luce and Money believe that nurture determined a person's gender identity and that gender reassignment after two-and-a-half years of age would be disastrous. Luce plans to castrate Calliope and give her progesterone to let her remain female. * Zora Khyber is a coworker of Cal's at San Francisco's Sixty-Niners, Bob Presto's burlesque club. Appearing fully female despite being genetically male, Zora is affected by complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. She is passionate about intersex visibility despite her ability to pass as female. * Julie Kikuchi is a Japanese-American photographer with whom Cal has a relationship in his adult life.

Early life Kee was born on 24 January 1947 in Bondi, New South Wales to a Chinese father and a sixth-generation Australian mother of Italian-English descent. Kee's great-grandparents had migrated from Guangdong, China, to Cooktown, Queensland during the 1870s gold rush. Kee attended East Sydney Technical College but did not complete her studies in fashion there. At age 18, she left Sydney for London. She started her career in fashion in modelling, at one time featuring as the face of Canadian Pacific Air Lines advertisements. Career In 1965, Kee moved to London and became involved in the Swinging London and underground scene, where she sold second-hand clothing to hippies at the Chelsea Antique Market for Vern Lambert. In 1972 she returned to Australia, and in 1973 opened a fashion boutique, Flamingo Park.Newstead, Adrian, The Dealer is the Devil: An Insider's History of the Aboriginal Art Trade, Brandl and Schlesinger, 2014, pp. 462, 502 and started collaborating with fashion and textile designer Linda Jackson to create a national fashion identity. They formed a partnership creating outfits including bright and colourful pure Australian wool knitted jumpers with fauna and flora emblems. Among them was a knitted koala jumper nicknamed \\"Blinky\\" that was owned by Diana, Princess of Wales, who wore it to a polo game at Windsor Castle in 1982. The waratah also featured strongly in her work. In October 1982, Karl Lagerfeld incorporated a couple of Kee's designs for his first Chanel collection. Kee and Jackson collaborated with artists such as David McDiarmid and Peter Tully, who hand-painted fabrics for Jackson's dresses and provided jewellery to complement her outfits. Located in the Strand Arcade in Sydney's central business district, the boutique closed in 1995.

Career Paramatti began his career with SPAL in 1986 in the lower divisions of the Italian football league, spending nine seasons with the club in total, including a two-year loan period with Russi between 1987 and 1989. A free agent at the age of 27, in 1995, he was signed by Bologna at the request of the club's sporting director at the time, Gabriele Oriali; Paramatti would make a name for himself with the club due to his consistent performances, eventually being named Bologna's captain. During his first season with the club, he helped Bologna to obtain Serie A promotion, winning the 1995‚Äì96 Serie B title. During the 1997‚Äì98 season under manager Renzo Ulivieri, he played alongside several notable players, such as Roberto Baggio, Giancarlo Marocchi, Igor Kolyvanov, and Kennet Andersson, helping Bologna to qualify for the 1998 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Bologna won the tournament the following season under Carlo Mazzone, qualifying for the 1998‚Äì99 UEFA Cup; the club would go on to reach the semi- finals of the competition, with Paramatti scoring in the return leg against Olympique Marseille. That season, the club also managed a semi-final finish in the Coppa Italia. After 5 seasons with the club, he was acquired by Juventus in 2000; during his final press conference with Bologna, an emotional Paramatti thanked the club's fans, stating: \\"I cannot forget them because they always showed great support. I am proud to have worn the Bologna shirt and I thank everyone: but this is a see you later, because five years are impossible to forget\\". With the Turin club, he made his Champions League debut under Carlo Ancelotti; he also made 10 appearances under Marcello Lippi during the 2001‚Äì02 season, which saw the club crowned Serie A champions, also reaching the Coppa Italia Final. In the summer of 2002, as originally promised, he returned to Bologna for one more season, after spending two seasons in Turin. He ended his career in 2004, after one season with Serie C1 side Reggiana. Style of play A hard-working, and ambidextrous full-back, Paramatti was usually deployed as a left-back, but was capable of playing on either side of the defence. Due to his tactical versatility, he was able to adapt to many different playing positions across the pitch, and had the capacity to play anywhere in defence or in midfield, due to his ability to time his runs and challenges. Throughout his career, he was also used as a centre-back, as a wide, defensive, or central midfielder, and even in more offensive roles, as a winger or as a forward on rare occasions, in particular due to his ability in the air, which made him a goal threat in the penalty area on indirect set- pieces. Due to his stamina, work-rate, and consistency, he was capable of aiding his team both offensively and defensively, and he excelled in particular as an attacking wing-back on the left flank. Personal life Michele 's son, Lorenzo, is also professional footballer, who made his professional debut in 2015.

Dwayne Johnson and Billy Bob Thornton star as a criminal seeking vengeance and the corrupt cop who pursues him, respectively. Tom Berenger, Oliver Jackson- Cohen, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Carla Gugino also appear. Faster was released on November 24, 2010, and grossed $35 million against production budget of $24 million. Plot Upon leaving prison, James Cullen alias \\"Driver\\", breaks into a run until he retrieves his 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle, a gun, and some names. He drives to an office in Bakersfield, California and kills a man. Driver visits Roy Grone, who gave him the car and gun, where he forces him to give him more names. Meanwhile, Driver is tracked by detectives Cicero and her partner Slade Humphries alias \\"Cop\\", who is on the verge of retirement, while his life is off track due to a debilitating heroin addiction. Cicero gets a break in the case when she recognizes Driver on video. Later, a nameless hitman, \\"Killer\\", is hired to kill Driver. Killer promises his girlfriend Lily it is his last job. Driver heads to the second name on his list, an old man, Kenneth Tyson alias \\"Old Guy\\", who films his own personal snuff films. He is in the middle of filming a sexual assault involving a teenaged girl he drugged when Driver busts in the door, saving the girl and shooting him dead. Killer initiates a gun fight in the hallway, but Driver escapes. This affects Killer philosophically, who proposes to Lily and takes the task personally. Cop and Cicero are investigating Driver's past and discover he was double crossed. Cicero remembers Driver from a video of his older half-brother Gary's death, filmed by the videographer, Old Guy. On tape, an unidentified man shoots Driver in the head, but he narrowly survives, though a metal plate in his skull. Driver visits his old girlfriend's house. She knows he is killing the people in the video and, after revealing she aborted their unborn child and has begun a new life, she tells him she hopes he succeeds. At a strip club in Nevada, Driver stabs a bouncer, Hovis Nixon alias Baphonet, who killed Gary, but he somehow managed to be alive. Soon, both Cop and Killer get word that Baphonet is in the hospital. Knowing Driver will go back to finish him off, they converge there. Driver enters the hospital and kills Baphonet when he is in surgery. Cop attempts to bring down Driver, but is unsuccessful. However, Driver spares his life after seeing his badge. While driving away from the hospital, Driver encounters Killer. After a high-speed chase on the freeway, Killer shoots Driver in the neck after Driver shoots out his tires. The name not listed is Driver's father. Driver believes his father arranged to have him and Gary killed after they refused to share the money they stole in a bank job. Driver is the result of his mother's affair, which Driver's father never forgave. Driver finds out his father died years before, and his mother stitches the gunshot wound on his neck and realises that it was Gary‚Äôs girlfriend who was the informant before he leaves. The last man is a traveling evangelist named Alexander Jerrod alias \\"Evangelist\\". After his service is over and everyone has left, Driver confronts him. Jerrod knows why he is there and tells him that he has turned his life around, begging for forgiveness. Driver spares him, only to be confronted by Killer. Detective Cicero learns the true identity of the man who shot Driver. She hurries to the church; Cop is already on the scene. Killer tells Driver to pick up his gun so they can have a test of skill. Driver declines, saying he has no fight with him. Killer explains he wanted to be better since he could not walk when he was a child. Cop walks in and shoots Driver in the head, revealing it was he who shot Driver in the video. He offers Killer the money for the job, a single dollar, but Killer declines. Killer departs, telling Cop never to contact him again. Cop calls his wife, Marina telling her they will be okay because he closed the case and how he has been reading up on women. Cop's wife Marina was revealed to have been Gary's girlfriend and an informant for Cop. She told him about the bank job, and Cop put together the crew to take out Gary and Driver. Suddenly, he is shot by Driver, who survived the shot due to his metal plate. Detective Cicero arrives on the scene after Driver has already left, and she covers up Cop's involvement. Driver scatters Gary's ashes in the sea and drives off into the sunset; simultaneously, Evangelist begins a sermon on forgiveness. Cast * Dwayne Johnson as James Cullen / Driver, a small-time criminal who avenges his brother's death. * Billy Bob Thornton as Detective Slade Humphries / Cop, a corrupt police detective who was responsible for the robbery and murder of Driver's brother. * Maggie Grace as Lily, The Killer's girlfriend. Later, The Killer's wife * Oliver Jackson-Cohen as The Killer, a hired hit-man who was hired by Slade to kill Driver. * Carla Gugino as Detective Cicero, a police detective who works with Cop. * Moon Bloodgood as Marina Humphries * Courtney Gains as Prescott Ashton / Telemarketer * John Cirigliano as Kenneth Tyson / Old Guy * Lester Speight as Hovis Nixon / Baphomet * Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Alexander Jarod / Evangelist, a former criminal who is now a priest. * Tom Berenger as Warden * Mike Epps as Roy Grone * Xander Berkeley as Sergeant Mallory * Matt Gerald as Gary Cullen * Annie Corley as Mrs. Cullen * Jennifer Carpenter as Nan Porterman * Michael Irby as Vaquero Production Variety reported in May 2009 that Dwayne Johnson was in final negotiations for his role and that Phil Joanou would be directing. That September it was reported that Joanou had dropped out and George Tillman Jr. would direct. Salma Hayek was considered for the role of Cicero, but a week before filming was started she dropped out due to \\"scheduling issues\\". Hayek was replaced by Carla Gugino. Principal photography began on February 8, 2010, in Los Angeles, California and continued in Pasadena and Santa Clarita in California. Chevelle The Chevrolet Chevelle driven by \\"Driver\\" which is prominently displayed in the movie has the rear of a 1971 or 1972 model, but the front of a 1970 model presumably due to the rarity and value of the 1970 Chevelle SS 454 which the car in the film is presumably portraying (it is never actually specified). Soundtrack Release The film grossed $12,200,000 over the five-day Thanksgiving release. It stayed in theaters until February 10, 2011. The film ultimately grossed $35,626,958 worldwide. The film was produced on a $24 million budget. It was released on video on March 1, 2011, and it grossed another $17.3 million in DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US. Reception Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 42% of 128 critics have given the film a positive review; the rating average is 4.87 out of 10. The site's consensus reads: \\"It's good to see Dwayne Johnson back in full-throttle action mode, but Faster doesn't deliver enough of the high-octane thrills promised by its title.\\" It holds a Metacritic score of 44 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun-Times said, \\"Rotate the plot, change the period, spruce up the dialogue, and this could have been a hard boiled 1940s noir. But it doesn't pause for fine touches and efficiently delivers action for an audience that likes one-course meals\\".

The flag is believed to have been brought to the United Kingdom by Admiral F. W. Kennedy following the 1897 Benin expedition.http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/557.html The original flag is currently held by the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich near London. It is not known if the flag has a proper name. It is commonly referred to as the Flag of the Benin Empire or the Flag of the Kingdom of Benin as it was recovered from territory under the Benin Empire's control, though remains unknown whether the flag had any official usage or connection to the Empire's central government. Another theory is the flag being created by the Itsekiri people as a battle flag and it getting adopted by the Edo as the Itsekiri were a core ally to Benin. History The flag was allegedly brought back to Britain by Admiral F.W Kennedy, who participated in the 1897 Punitive Expedition in Benin, as a war souvenir captured by the British soldiers who first engaged the Benin soldiers at the Battle of Ologbo. The Itsekiri flag of Nana clearly shows the British colonial emblem on its top left corner and there was no other independent army in that region that Admiral W.F Kenedy fought against except the Benin Army. It is possible that the \\"Flag of Benin Empire\\" is the war flag or unit standard of the Benin Army that the British Army who engaged them at Ologbo brought back to Britain as a war memento or souvenir. Description The Greenwich Museum, to which the flag currently belongs, describes this flag as follows:http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/557.html > West African flag probably Itsekri. A red wool bunting flag with a linen > hoist, machine sewn with a rope halyard attached. The design is applied in > white fabric with painted details, representing a naked man decapitating > another with a sword. The flag was said to have been brought back by Admiral > F. W. Kennedy from the 1897 Benin expedition. 'Kennedy' is inscribed on a > paper label attached to the rope. The Itsekri people acted as middlemen > between the Edo people of Benin in the interior and the Europeans on the > coast ‚Äì the Edo would not cross or travel on waterways. The Benin expedition > was launched in reprisal against an attack on a British mission in the > service of Niger Coast Protectorate by forces of the Oba of Benin. It was a > combined naval and military operation under the command of Rear-Admiral > Harry Holdsworth Rawson C.B. with local troops and carriers. The towns of > Guato and Sapobar were attacked by detached forces while the main part of > the expedition marched on Benin. The town was captured and accidentally > burnt. Oba Overami was exiled to Calabar where he died in 1914. The famous > Benin bronzes were removed as reparations by the British.' It is therefore confirmed that the flag was a real African flag that was brought back by the British from their 1897 final expedition against the Empire of Benin (which was then finally overcome and annexed by the British Empire). The fact ‚Äì stated by the Royal Museum ‚Äì that the flag was brought back by Admiral F.W. Kennedy from the 1897 expedition against the Empire of Benin would indicate it clearly came from the Benin Empire. Several sources on the Internet give it as a fact that the flag was indeed the official flag of the Benin Empire.http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Nigeria_native.html The first of such assertions seems to trace back to now defunct website GreatBenin.org. The Maritime Royal Museum (which holds the original flag), on the other hand, propones that the flag is \\"probably of Itsekri (sic) origin\\" (the Itsekri were tributary and allies of the Benin Empire),National Maritime Museum: Barbara Tomlinson, Curator of Antiquities, February 2010 basing such assumption on the supposed similarities between the disputed flag and three other flags brought to Britain after campaigns against then-Itsekiri Chief Nana Olomu, taken place three years earlier than the campaign against the Emperor of Benin from which the red flag was brought. Pictures of the red, disputed flag, as well as of the three definitely Itsekiri flags, can be seen here. Modern interest In more recent times the flag has attracted attention for its design being unusual for a flag and gained some popularity on the internet for its highly distinctive and unique graphic design.Edwin's RaisinBoing BoingKottke References External links * Royal Museums Greenwich Category:History of Benin ","title":"Flag of the Kingdom of Benin"},{"id":"26178339","text":"Plutus in Divina Commedia, in an engraving by Gustave Dor√©. \\"Pape Sat√†n, pape Sat√†n aleppe\\" is the opening line of Canto VII of Dante Alighieri's Inferno. The line, consisting of three words, is famous for the uncertainty of its meaning, and there have been many attempts to interpret it. Modern commentators on the Inferno view it as some kind of demonic invocation to Satan.Dorothy L. Sayers, Hell: notes on Canto VII, Penguin, 1949, .Mark Musa, Inferno: notes on Canto VII, Penguin, 2002, . Text The line is a shout by Plutus. Plutus (also identified with Pluto and Hades) was originally the Roman god of wealth and the underground, but in the Inferno, Dante has made Plutus into a repulsive demon who guards the fourth circle, where souls who have abused their wealth through greed or improvidence are punished. The full strophe, plus the following four, which describes Dante's and Virgil's entire meeting and confrontation with Plutus reads: The scant information that can be gleaned from the text is this: #Virgil understands the meaning (\\"And that benignant Sage, who all things knew...\\"), and is replying. #That the line is just the beginning of something else (\\"Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began...). #It is an expression of anger (\\"And said: \\"Be silent, thou accursed wolf / Consume within thyself with thine own rage.\\"). #That it has the effect of a threat to Dante (And that benignant Sage, who all things knew, / Said, to encourage me: \\"Let not thy fear / Harm thee; for any power that he may have / Shall not prevent thy going down this crag.\\"). Possible explanations The only word with fairly obvious meaning is \\"Sat√†n\\", namely Satan; which comes from the Hebrew word ◊î÷∑◊©÷∏◊Ç◊ò÷∏◊ü (ha-Satan), which translated literally means \\"the adversary\\". The earliest interpretations Some interpretations from the earliest commentators on the Divine Comedy include: *The word \\"pape\\" might be a rendering of Latin papae, or from Greek œÄŒ±œÄŒ±ŒØ (papa√≠). Both words are interjections of anger or surprise, attested in ancient authors (comparable to the English \\"damn!\\", or just \\"oh!\\").Vittorio Sermonti, Inferno, Rizzoli 2001, p. 134.Berthe M. Marti, \\"A Crux in Dante's Inferno,\\" Speculum, Vol. 27, No. 1 (Jan 1952), pp. 67‚Äì70. *The word \\"aleppe\\" could be an Italian version of the word for \\"alef\\", the Hebrew letter ◊ê (a) (compare Phoenician alep and Greek alpha). The consonant shift here is comparable to that in Giuseppe, the Italian version of the name Joseph. In Hebrew, alef also means \\"number one\\" or \\"the origin that contains everything\\". It may also be interpreted as a metaphor for the \\"head\\", \\"the first and foremost\\". This was an attribute for God in late medieval expressions, meaning \\"the majesty\\" (of God). \\"Alef\\" was also a medieval interjection (like \\"Oh God!\\"). With these interpretations, the verse would mean \\"Oh, Satan, o Satan, god, king!\\". The prayer theory The word \\"pape\\" might come from Latin Pape, an old Roman term for \\"emperor\\", or \\"father\\". The double mention of \\"pape\\" together with \\"Satan\\" (here interpreted as the fallen angel Satan) and the break (the comma) in the hendecasyllable, gives it a tone of a prayer or an invocation to Satan, although there is no apparent verb. It might be also an invocation of the evil within the intruders. Domenico Guerri's theory Domenico Guerri researched medieval glossaries thoroughly in 1908, and interpreted it as \\"Oh Satan, oh Satan, God\\", which he wrote was meant as an invocation against travellers.Domenico Guerri, Di alcuni versi dotti nella \\"Divina Commedia\\", Citt√† di Castello, 1908 Abboud Rashid's theory Abboud Abu Rashid, the first translator of the Divine Comedy into Arabic (1930‚Äì1933), interpreted this verse as a phonetic translation of the spoken Arabic, \\"Bab Al-Shaytan, Bab Al-Shaytan, Ahlibu!\\", meaning \\"The door of Satan, the door of Satan, proceed downward!\\". According to some scholars, although Dante did not speak Arabic, he could have drawn some inspiration from Islamic sources.Philip K. Hitti, \\"Recent Publications in Arabic or Dealing with the Arabic World,\\" Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 54, No. 4 (Dec 1934), pp. 435‚Äì438. Doubts arise, however, because the meaning of this interpretation does not really match the reaction of Dante and Virgil (anger and fear), nor Virgil's answer. The Hebrew theory Some commentatorsErnesto Manara, in Il Propugnatore, 1888. claim that the sentence is phonetic Hebrew, \\"Bab-e-sciatan, bab-e-sciatan, alep!\\". This would be the opposite of the sentence that Jesus spoke in the Gospel according to St Matthew 16:18, \\"...and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it\\". The meaning of this utterance would be that Hell (Satan) has conquered. The French theories There are also two suggestions of translations from French. The first reads: \\"Pas paix Satan, pas paix Satan, √† l'√©p√©e\\" (\\"No peace Satan, no peace Satan, to the sword\\"). The second is: \\"Paix, paix, Satan, paix, paix, Satan, allez, paix!\\" (\\"Peace, peace, Satan, peace, peace, Satan, let's go, peace!\\"). The latter phrase can be interpreted as \\"Satan, make peace!\\". Benvenuto Cellini, in his autobiography, reports hearing the phrase in Paris, transliterating it as \\"Phe phe, Satan, phe phe, Satan, al√®, phe\\" and interpreting it as \\"Be quiet! Be quiet Satan, get out of here and be quiet.\\"Benvenuto Cellini (tr. Julia Conaway Bondanella and Peter E. Bondanella), My Life, Oxford University Press, 2002, , p. 262 and note on p. 438.

It produces mainly dry white wine from the cool climate grape Madeleine Angevine. Like the majority of English vineyards, it is open for tasting in the winery and tours of the vineyard. Though English vineyards are not typically known for producing excellent wine, Sharpham has created a continentally known collection of wine. Sharpham is also very well known for its Devonshire cheeses. A mixture between herby hard cheeses and creamy summer cheeses, they have gathered awards nationwide and sell cheese all over Devon.  History  Philemon Pownoll, a Royal Navy officer used his huge rich earnings after capturing a Spanish treasure ship (the Hermione) in May 1762 to buy the Sharpham estate, a thousand year old farm consisting of five hundred acres. He then built a large house designed in 1770 by Sir Robert Taylor with gardens designed by Capability Brown, overlooking the fields and wooded slopes above the River Dart, two miles downstream of the ancient market town of Totnes. The estate is now owned by the Sharpham Trust of which author, scholar and teacher Stephen Batchelor is coordinator. Sharpham Partnership is the trading name for the diversified activities run on the family estate. Situated on the banks of the River Dart near Totnes in South Devon, the vineyards, creamery and organic dairy farm have been producing wines and unpasteurised cheeses for over twenty years to local, national and international acclaim. By producing their own Jersey cow‚Äôs milk on the farm and growing a range of carefully selected cool climate grapes varieties in the vineyard, they believe they are in control of production from start to finish. The results are individual, hand made wines and cheeses with a special character and flavour that relates to the unique position in the South Hams area of Devon.  Recent Success  In 2001, it was named the UK Red Wine producer of the year at the UK Vineyards Association Awards. At the forefront of vine growing and wine making in the UK, Sharpham is widely recognised as producing some of England's most outstanding wines. They have been producing wine for nearly twenty five years. Traditional and new world techniques are used resulting in a range of distinctive and carefully balanced wines. The awards tally includes Regional, National and International medals.
