The 1972 Summer games became victim to both terrorism and international controversy with ties to the ongoing Cold War situation. During the games, Palestinian terrorists killed two Israeli athletes and took nine hostages. After a failed rescue attempt, all hostages and all but three of terrorists were killed. The United States-Soviet Union basketball game was also embroiled in controversy. The U.S. basketball Olympic winning streak, which started in 1936, was ended by the Soviet Union team's close victory game. The U.S. complained about errors in officiating but the victory by the Soviet Union was upheld. Among the 1972 Summer Olympic highlights was the performance of swimmer Mark Spitz, who set seven World Records to win a record seven gold medals in one Olympics, bringing his total to nine. Other notable athletes at the 1972 games were sixteen-year-old Olga Korbut, whose success in women's gymnastics earned three gold medals for the Soviet Union, and British athlete Mary Peters, who took home the gold in the women's pentathlon. The 1976 Summer games in Montreal marked the first time the Olympic games were held in Canada. Mindful of the tragedy during the 1972 games, security was high during the Montreal games. Due to its policy on apartheid, South Africa was banned from the games. Even so, twenty-two other African countries sat out to protest. ''' The 1976 Summer Olympics were highlighted by the legendary performance of 14-year-old Romanian female gymnast Nadia ComƒÉneci, who scored seven perfect 10s and won 3 gold medals, including the prestigious All Around in women's gymnastics. The performance by ComƒÉneci also marked the rise of legendary women's gymnastics coach B√©la K√°rolyi, who went on to coach the U.S. team in both the 1988 and 1992 summer Olympic games. The 1976 Summer games also featured the strong U.S. boxing team, which consisted of Sugar Ray Leonard, Leon Spinks, Michael Spinks, Leo Randolph and Howard Davis Jr. The team won five gold medals and was arguably the greatest Olympic boxing team ever. In wrestling, Dan Gable won the gold medal in the 149-pound weight class without having a single point scored against him. Amazingly, this was done with a painful shoulder injury. The Winter Olympics were held in Sapporo, Japan, in 1972 and Innsbruck, Austria, in 1976. Originally, Denver, Colorado, was supposed to host the '76 games, but voters rejected a plan to finance the venues needed and the IOC chose Innsbruck instead; the city had already had venues from hosting the 1964 Winter Olympics.

Plot summary Captain Robert Walton is a failed writer who sets out to explore the North Pole and expand his scientific knowledge in hopes of achieving fame. While icebound, the crew spots two dog sleds, one chasing the other. A few hours later, the crew rescues one of the sled drivers, a nearly frozen and emaciated man named Victor Frankenstein. Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion and recounts a story of his life's miseries to Walton. Victor begins by telling of his childhood in 1793. Born into a wealthy family in Geneva, he grows up in a safe environment, surrounded by loving family and friends. Weeks before he leaves for university in Germany, his mother dies of scarlet fever. At university, he develops a secret technique to imbue inanimate bodies with life with electricity. After bringing a deceased dog back to life he decides to create a life using parts of the dead. He succeeds but is repulsed by his work: he flees the room, and the Creature disappears. Collapsing from pneumonia brought on by overwork and emotional stress, he is nursed back to health by his friend, Henry Clerval and Elizabeth. He returns home to find his brother William murdered. Certain this is the work of the Creature, Victor retreats into the mountains to find peace. The Creature finds Victor and tells him how he had become afraid of people and spent the first year of his life alone, learning to speak and read through his observation of a family whose shed he lived in. After approaching the blind grandfather, who responded to him in kindness, the Creature was physically attacked by the old man's son and ran away. Traveling to Geneva, he met a little boy ‚Äî Victor's brother William ‚Äî outside the town of Plainpalais. Wanting to keep the boy from yelling, the creature accidentally killed him. Even though this was accidental the creature took this as his first act of vengeance against his creator. The Creature concludes his story with a demand that Frankenstein create for him a female companion like himself promising that if Victor grants his request, he and his mate will vanish into the uninhabited wilderness of South America. Victor reluctantly agrees. Clerval tries to talk Victor out of his mission. Horrified by the idea that creating a mate for the Creature might lead to the breeding of an entire race of creatures, he abandons the project, destroying the notebook in which he had recorded the method by which he had brought the male Creature to life and then setting fire to the not-yet-living Bride. Furious, the Creature swears vengeance against Victor, promising to \\"be with him on his wedding night,\\" and, shortly after, murders Clerval. Victor is imprisoned for the murder and suffers a mental breakdown. After being acquitted, and with his health renewed, he returns home with his father. Once home, Victor marries Elizabeth, but on the evening of the wedding, the Creature sneaks into the bedroom and strangles her to death. Victor's father goes mad with grief. Victor vows to hunt down and destroy the Creature. After months of pursuit, the two end up in the Arctic Circle, near the North Pole. After hearing Frankenstein's story, Walton relents and agrees to head for home. Frankenstein begs the captain to finish off what he could not, as the creature cannot be left alive. Close to death, he sees the ghost of his beloved wife beckoning to him, and dies shortly after. Walton soon after discovers the Creature on his ship, mourning over Frankenstein's body. Walton hears the Creature's misguided reasons for his vengeance as well as expressions of remorse. Frankenstein's death has not brought him any peace. Rather, his crimes have increased his misery and alienation; he has found only his own emotional ruin in the destruction of his creator and feels once again abandoned. He vows to kill himself on his own funeral pyre so that no others will ever know of his existence. Walton watches as the Creature, carrying his creator's body, wanders off into the icy wastes of the arctic never to be seen again.

Variety said \\"Faithfully retelling a 19th century gothic novel means daring to be boring in places, but the peaks far outweigh those flat and arid stretches in this beautifully assembled Hallmark production.\\" Kim Newman said \\"This finally fulfils the promise many - including Frankenstein: The True Story and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein - failed to keep and is a faithful, respectful, slightly stiff adaptation of the novel.\\" DVD Talk gave the film three and a half stars saying \\"The story takes a while to get emotionally involved in, but if you give it a chance, your patience will be rewarded in the last half of the film. Because of its emphasis on tragedy over horror, and because of its loyalty to Shelley's original work, I'm going to go ahead and give this one a recommendation.\\" Guy Adams writing for the British Fantasy Society reiterates that the \\"three hour mini-series sticks closely to the original novel\\" and said \\"It's definitely a TV version (though thankfully light on the usual Hallmark Channel vaseline and whimsy), a little flat in places, but it is an honourable and enjoyable attempt at providing a definitive version of Shelley's book.\\" References External links * Category:Frankenstein films Category:Films shot in New Orleans Category:Films directed by Kevin Connor Category:Films set in Germany Category:Films set in Switzerland Category:Films set in the 1810s ","title":"Frankenstein (miniseries)"},{"id":"12259264","text":"Rod Waddell (born 23 May 1957) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton and Geelong in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

However, this was an error: Lalor was one of only two DVFL clubs which was not part of Collingwood's zone, and Waddell should actually have been zoned to . Because the Collingwood reserves team had fielded him without the proper clearance, it was stripped of four premiership points that it had earned with him in the team in 1981.

Tang established Orchard Road as a premier retail district in Singapore. Early life A Teochew, Tang was born in early 20th century Shantou, China to a Presbyterian pastor. He emigrated to the British colony of Singapore in 1923. In Singapore, Tang peddled hand-made Swatow lace, embroidery and linen products. With a rented rickshaw, Tang carried his goods in a pair of tin trunks, which he kept long afterwards. Tang later became known as the \\"Tin Trunk Man\\" and the \\"Curio King\\" for his rags to riches story. Establishment of Tangs Tangs department store, Singapore, photographed February 1969, July 1971 In 1932, Tang was able to embark on a larger venture. He established a department store in 1932 with an initial capital of S$3,000. Tang set up his first shop on the first floor of a building on River Valley Road, selling craft products from China. Subsequently in 1940, Tang financed the construction of a new building at the corner of Jalan Mohamed Sultan and River Valley Road to house a new department store. He called the new edifice Gainurn Building, a variation of his father's name Tang Gan Urn. By the 1950s, CK Tang had opened several more branches. In 1958, Tang bought a 1,351-square metre piece of land at the corner of Orchard Road and Scotts Road at a cost of S$10,000 to further his vision of expanding his business. Although the site faced the Tai San Ting Cemetery, he felt that it had commercial value as many British housewives in the Tanglin area could stop by on their way to the city. The decision was made against the advice of fellow businessmen who thought Orchard Road was unfashionable then. Years later, when the Singapore Government designated and developed Orchard Road as a prime shopping and tourist district, the price of land soared from S$3 per m¬≤ to S$6,000 per m¬≤. With the acquired land plot, Tang constructed the landmark C.K. Tang Department Store (now rebranded as Tangs) at 310 Orchard Road at a cost of S$50,000. The building's green-tiled roof and facade was modelled after the Imperial Palace of the Forbidden City in Beijing. In 1960, Tang voluntarily closed the store due to problems with the trade unions, but Tangs was re-opened the following year. In 1975, Tang's company was publicly listed. Marriott Hotel, Singapore (formerly the Dynasty Hotel) and Tang Plaza were built in 1982 to expand Tang Choon Keng's business on Orchard Road. In the late 1970s, Tang expanded his business again when he decided to develop the neighboring property lots which he had bought years before. In 1982, the building on Orchard Road was demolished to make way for the new Tang complex, comprising the 33-story deluxe Dynasty Hotel (now the Singapore Marriott Hotel) and the Tangs shopping complex (now Tang Plaza). The shopping complex consists of five floors of retail space covering more than 15,000 m¬≤, marketed under the slogan \\"All The Best Under One Roof\\". In 1991, Tangs opened its first overseas branch in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Tang also collaborated with Malaysia's Mayang Sari Bhd to develop real estate, hotels and commercial properties in Kuala Lumpur. He also assisted the Dairy Farm International Holdings in its retail business in Malaysia. Until 1996, Tangs was the only major shopping centre in Singapore to not operate on Sundays, in deference to Tang's Christian faith. Tang instituted the policy so that his family and Christian staff could attend church on Sundays. As a staunch Christian, Tang spoke of honesty and hard work as his guiding principles. Tang's distinctive management philosophy was the focus on people, both customers and staff. Emphasis was given to quality of the staff, reasonable pricing and warm service. Tang believed in investing in his staff, as his frontline staff would be the ones who would be in direct contact with the customers and he believed that the image of the store depended on them. As a result, Tang reserved a substantial annual budget for staff training, which included tailored programs for sales staff, supervisors and management. Supervisors and managers were expected to undergo a minimum 100 hours of training. Tang also made an effort to get in touch with his staff at all levels, in order understand his customers' expectations on product and service quality. Despite the company's poor financial results in certain years, Tangs retained its reputation for good service and reliability. Tang retired in 1987, handing the reins of corporate leadership to the second of his three sons, Tang Wee Sung. Tang retained the post of company president and was rarely out of touch with company business, personally checking the company's accounts and meeting suppliers.  Personal life  Besides CK Tang, Tang Choon Keng was also known as Tang Un Tien. In 1960, Tang was kidnapped by four armed thugs, but was freed unharmed within 84 hours after the family reportedly paid S$150,000 in ransom. Tang's first wife died in 1980; he subsequently remarried. Tang had eight children. On 3 September 2000, Tang died peacefully at home with his family around him at 98 years old.

Born in Carron, Stirlingshire, he attended St Francis RC School in Falkirk and played juvenile football for Dunipace Thistle. He joined Morton in 1944, where he played for seven seasons before a ¬£14,000 transfer to Middlesbrough. He returned to Scotland two years later, joining Celtic for ¬£8,000. Celtic won the invitational Coronation Cup in Mochan's second game for the club. He had further success the next year as Celtic won the Double in 1953‚Äì54. He made his debut for Scotland at that season's end and was selected in the squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland, but Scotland lost to both Austria and Uruguay and exited the competition in the first round. Mochan had predominantly played as a centre- forward or outside left during his career but, despite a consistent scoring record, he was not always a first-team regular for Celtic. As a result, he became somewhat of a utility player, filling in at inside-left and even left- back when required. He was selected at outside left in the 1957 Scottish League Cup Final and scored twice as Celtic defeated their Old Firm rivals Rangers by 7‚Äì1. In 1960, Mochan joined newly promoted Dundee United and helped them establish their position in the top division. In 1963 he signed for Raith Rovers, his younger brother's former club. Dennis Mochan had joined Raith from East Fife in 1959 but left for Nottingham Forest the year before Neil joined the club. Mochan returned to Celtic as a trainer after his retirement from playing in 1964. He served for many years as head trainer under his former team-mate Jock Stein and continued in a coaching capacity well into the 1980s, under Stein's successors Billy McNeill and Davie Hay. A biography of Mochan, Celtic's Smiler by Paul John Dykes, was published in 2015, along with an accompanying feature-length documentary.

It was disbanded after a ruling against their violent methods by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1860 in Baker v. Morton. Background The first claim club in the United States was established by settlers around Burlington, Iowa, where claims were staked out soon after the American Revolutionary War. These clubs were established in direct violation of federal law, in what J. Sterling Morton described as \\"that independence characteristic of the commonwealth by which it became a state.\\" Early Nebraska settlers were breaking the law as well, as they invaded Omaha tribal lands to which the United States had claim but no ownership. Morton noted that, \\"In both Nebraska and Iowa the squatters on lands were fully protected by the unauthorized if not positively illegal rules and promises of the claim clubs.\\" According to two prominent historians, the roots of the Omaha Claim Club lay in the city's founders' disagreements with \\"federal land laws that they considered unfair and unenforceable. Critics argued that the government's policy of selling land impeded rather than promoted progress ... Almost all thought that the land policy favored wealthy speculators.\\"Larsen, L. and Cottrell, B. (1997) The Gate City: A History of Omaha. University of Nebraska Press. p. 43.

In 1846 Mormon settlers received permission from the Omaha tribe to establish their Winter Quarters near the Missouri River west of Kanesville, Iowa, and in 1848 Martin Van Buren's Free Soil Party advocated the federal government give away free land in the presidential election. By 1853, Kanesville townspeople had already driven stakes in the land that would become Omaha.

The Homestead Act remedying this was not enacted until 1862. In the meantime, a group of early settlers in the Omaha area formed a club determined to provide security for the land interests of its members. The organizing meeting of the Omaha Claim Club was held on July 22, 1854, at the site of the \\"lone tree\\", the only landmark within the Omaha City limits at the time. The lone tree was also the ferry landing leading to Kanesville, Iowa. At the first meeting a constitution and bylaws were prepared and adopted, and officers were elected. Samuel Lewis was chosen chairman, M. C. Gaylord was secretary; Alfred D. Jones became judge, S. Lewis was clerk, and R. B. Whitted was sheriff. John M. Thayer, A. J. Hanscom, Andrew J. Poppleton, Lyman Richardson, Thomas B. Cuming, Dr. George L. Miller, Dr. Enos Lowe, Jesse Lowe, Joseph Barker, Sr., Joseph, Jr., and George E. Barker, 0. D. Richardson, Byron Reed, John Redick, and James Woolworth were members, as well. In 1855 the membership included nearly all the town's male residents. The motto, \\"An injury to one is the concern of all,\\" was adopted. The stated goals of the Omaha Claim Club were to protect new settlers from illegal claim jumpers who would attempt to take possession of land already claimed if possible, and to promote the development of Omaha City. However, more than one claim was made of the Claim Club's dubious purposes, including collusion and bullying.Bristow, D. (1997) A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha. Caxton Press. p. 40. There was an early understanding that no member could own more than of timber.Rea, L. (nd) \\"History of Omaha/Douglas County\\" , Douglas County Historical Society. Retrieved 7/14/07. Other agreements settled the amount of land each member could own, requirements for claiming land in the area, requirements for maintaining land ownership, price fixing for land, as well as other price controls. There were also several punishments determined for settlers who violated any part of the club's rules, either stated or unstated. Influencing government The First Nebraska Territorial Legislature was primarily composed of claim clubs members from across the territory. Despite federal law limiting land claims over , state senators passed an act that legalized claims of 320 acres (1.3 km¬≤) and providing penalties for trespassing upon them. In 1855 Colonel Lorin Miller, later mayor of Omaha, surveyed Scriptown in the spring and summer on behalf of the Omaha Claim Club.(nd) Johnson's History of Nebraska p. 284. Retrieved 6/7/07. This land was used to persuade members of the Nebraska Territorial Legislature later that year as they voted on the location of the state capitol,(1898) Transactions and reports of the Nebraska State Historical Society: Volume IV. Lincoln, NE: State Journal Printers. which Omaha kept until 1867. Vigilante violence The club was effective in protecting its members' claims, primarily and frequently using mob violence to enforce its rule. The club's vigilantes rode masked and at night, frustrating efforts to identify the mob. The Omaha Claim Club became recognized as the unofficial court governing land claims, and in 1854 Alfred D. Jones, a surveyor, divided land into blocks starting by the ferry landing. That was the first time anyone planned what Omaha would look like. Jones was soon afterwards appointed the first postmaster of Omaha. Later Club leadership included Andrew J. Poppleton. The club's original claim of nearly four thousand acres (16 km¬≤) frustrated many settlers who came after the club was formed. Generally they objected to the vast extent of territory held by so few individuals and attempted to \\"jump\\", or occupy for themselves, the claims of the members of the Omaha Claim Club. After this happened, a vigilante committee formed by members of the club visited the claim jumper to inform him that he was trespassing upon land previously claimed. They would warn the intruder that if he didn't vacate immediately he would be forced to. If the committee encountered resistance, the jumper soon found himself neck- deep in trouble ‚Äî the severity depending upon the intensity of resistance. =Shooting out the Frenchman= Cam Reeves was the first figure identified in a dispute for the Omaha Claim Club. An unnamed \\"Frenchman\\" had staked a claim in 1854 on part of Alfred D. Jones's land and refused to move off. The club sent for Reeves, who had gained a reputation as a trouble-shooter in Missouri, and he started a long battle with the Frenchman that drew crowds from neighboring towns. \\"The Frenchman took his beating and fled\\", while Cam Reeves stayed. He became Omaha's first sheriff.(1954) \\"New City Shapes Up on a Muddy Plateau; 'Claims Club' Is Ruler\\", Omaha's First Century. Omaha World-Herald. Retrieved 7/14/07. =Horse thieves= The Claim Club's \\"vigilante committee\\" activities were not limited to claim jumping. The vigilantes often cooperated with Sheriff Reeves, but often acted as lawmen, judges, juries and executioners themselves. Public whippings and lynchings were common. Frontier punishment varied according to the degree of harm resulting from the crime. The pioneers dealt with most horse thieves mercilessly. In March, 1858, a posse of angered farmers captured two desperadoes who had stolen horses near Florence. After they were jailed in Omaha's courthouse, the Claim Club broke in and took the men, without any resistance from the sheriff. They hanged the horse thieves two miles (3 km) north of Florence that day, with no repercussions, except for Sheriff Reeves, who was fined for not fulfilling his duties. =Callahan versus Cuming= Another story involved acting Governor Thomas B. Cuming. Apparently, Cuming hired an Irish man named Callahan to make improvements on Cuming's land in order to conform with the homestead law. Callahan, however, filed a claim on the land for himself. When the claim club demanded that Callahan surrender the deed of ownership, a committee was appointed to \\"persuade\\" him. Callahan was then taken to the Missouri River, a hole was chopped in the ice, and he was dunked through the hole until he and the claim club came to an agreement. Callahan died within a year, apparently from the after-effects of hypothermia brought on from his dunking. =John Kelly= John Kelly was a carpenter with a legal claim to near Omaha. When word reached his aunt, Gertrude Wiley, that four wagons from the Claim Club were coming to \\"talk Kelly out\\" of his claim, she quickly hid him in her cellar in Saratoga. After a day of continual harassment from the vigilantes, Kelly walked south to Bellevue where he escaped to Iowa. After his deed to the land came, he went back to his land and was not bothered again.Purviance, E.E. (nd) \\"A Pioneer Family,\\" Pioneer Women of America. Retrieved 7/19/07. =Other cases= On February 2, 1856, the club was reorganized as the Omaha Township Claim Association but its arbitrary powers continued as before ‚Äî in several instances even more viciously.

Morton The Circuit court of the District of Nebraska decided against a claim brought by Alexander Baker versus William Morton, both early Omaha settlers; Morton was involved in the Omaha Claim Club. Baker appealed to the United States Supreme Court, and in 1870 the Supreme Court ruled for Baker in the trial of Baker v. Morton. According to court proceedings, A. H. Baker was forced to sign over the land he claimed to another person for free because of threats made by members of the Omaha Claim Club. Important figures in Omaha's history testified during the trial, including John Redick and James Woolworth. In the trial the club was found to commonly take landowners who refused to sell their property to the nearby Missouri River by force. With a rope tied around the person's neck, members of the club repeatedly dunked him until he agreed to sell.Shavell, S. (2005) \\"Contracts, Holdup, and Legal Intervention\\". Harvard Law School. Retrieved 7/14/07.Bristow, D. (1997) A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha. Caxton Press. p. 42. In this case, the club threatened to hang or drown Baker. The judge found Baker to have been forced to sign the contract through violence, and overturned the circuit court's earlier finding on behalf of Morton. Demise Reasons for the demise of the Omaha Township Claim Association, aka the Omaha Claim Club, vary. The Supreme Court ordered the breakup in their ruling. Other sources say that with the arrival of Omaha's United States Land Office, the claims club simply was not needed.Sorenson, A.

By enforcing the \\"laws\\" they made up, they supposedly created an order where the U.S. government was not prepared to otherwise. In 1857 when the Buchanan Administration announced the sale of lands in Nebraska would start in 1858, claims clubs across the state, led by Omaha, protested against him on the grounds that they would not be ready for the sale. The Administration was persuaded to wait until 1859.Olson, J. and Naugle, R.C. (1997) \\"Territorial growth and development,\\" History of Nebraska. University of Nebraska Press. p. 90.

The album was recorded on July 27 & 28th, 1970 at Larrabee Studios in LA and released by Polydor later in the same year . At the end of the sixties John Mayall was residing in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California and had developed connections with local musicians, befriending Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor, who had both just departed Canned Heat. Taylor had appeared on one track of Mayall's previous album, Empty Rooms, the only studio recordings of his \\"Turning Point\\" band, and stayed on to replace Stephen Thompson (with whom he duetted on \\"To a Princess\\"); Mandel essentially replaced acoustic guitar specialist Jon Mark, and electric violinist Harris replaced saxophonist Johnny Almond. In the USA Union liner notes, Mayall noted that, after the Turning Point band broke up, he'd played a British music festival with an all- star lineup and then needed to form a new band swiftly when Polydor Records pressed him for a new album. With his new all-American line up, Mayall pursued the jazzy blues experiment documented on his live album The Turning Point. This unusual format (electric guitars by Mayall and Mandel, Mayall playing piano and harmonica as well, Harris's electric violin, Taylor's acoustic and electric bass, and no drums) the band created a unique sound and recorded this series of songs mostly chronicling Mayall's then-romance with Nancy Throckmorton (a theme he first visited on Empty Rooms), who provided some photography for the album jacket. \\"Nature's Disappearing,\\" the album's opening song, dealt with environmental issues, the only song on the album that didn't address Mayall's romance. On tour the band was joined by drummer Paul Lagos from Kaleidoscope. Jazz critic Leonard Feather wrote liner notes for the back of the album; inside the gatefold jacket, Mayall gave advice on preserving nature. The USA Union lineup would appear as some of the core of Mayall's Back to the Roots set, which featured several notable Mayall alumni including Eric Clapton, John McVie, Mick Taylor, Stephen Thompson and previous drummers Keef Hartley and Aynsley Dunbar. Mayall would keep the drumless format for just one more album, Memories, where Jerry McGee replaced Harvey Mandel as guitarist.

Early and personal life  He measured tall, and was the third child of a family in Huade county, in the city of Ulanqab in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He had two sisters, both of whom developed at normal rates. According to his father, He Yun, at birth he was small enough to fit in the palm of his parents' hands. When it became apparent the child was growing very slowly, doctors diagnosed the cause as the bone deformity osteogenesis imperfecta, which hinders normal bone growth and body height. He was a chain smoker.  Recognition of size  In January 2007, He was invited to take part on a television program in Tokyo, Japan. His home of Inner Mongolia is also home to Bao Xishun, who at tall was recognized by Guinness as the world's tallest man until September 2009. Their televised meeting in July 2007 attracted global media attention. In May 2008 he appeared in the British Channel 4 documentary called The World's Smallest Man and Me hosted by Mark Dolan. In the episode He and his family spent time with Mark who stayed over to celebrate Chinese New Year.

The Commonwealth commanding officer, Grand Hetman of Lithuania Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, held the forces of Sultan Osman II at bay until the first autumn snows, dying in the process. On 9 October, due to the lateness of the season and heavy losses‚Äîfrom several assaults on fortified Commonwealth lines‚Äîthe Ottomans abandoned their siege and the battle ended in stalemate, reflected in a treaty that in some sections favoured the Ottomans and in others favoured the Commonwealth. Chodkiewicz died on September 24, 1621 shortly after concluding a treaty with the Turks. Name Khotyn was conquered and controlled by many states, resulting in many name changes (; ; ; ; , translit. Khotin). Other variations include Chotyn, or Choczim (especially in Polish). Prelude At the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century, the magnates of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth intervened in the affairs of Moldavia, which was‚Äîand had been since its conquest by Mehmed II in the 15th century‚Äîa vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. Additionally, the Ottomans were aggravated by the constant raids by Cossacks, then nominally subjects of the Commonwealth, across the border into Ottoman territories. The route of the Ottoman army towards Khotyn (Hotin) which they reached on 2 September 1621. In the meantime, the Thirty Years' War raged across Europe. The Commonwealth was relatively uninvolved in this war but the Polish King Sigismund III Vasa sent an elite and ruthless mercenary unit, the Lisowczycy, to aid his Habsburg allies in Vienna, since his brother- in-law was the Emperor. They defeated George R√°k√≥czi of Transylvania at the Battle of Humenn√© in 1619. Gabriel Bethlen, the reigning Prince of Transylvania, asked Sultan Osman II for aid. The sultan agreed. A large Ottoman army was gathered for a punitive invasion of the Commonwealth. On 20 September 1620, an Ottoman army under the command of the governor of Oczakov (Ozi) Iskender Pasha routed the Polish-Commonwealth army at the Battle of Cecora, captured Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski, beheaded Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski,Davies, N., 2005, God's Playground, Vol. 1, New York: Columbia University Press, and sent Tatar raiders into southern Poland. The campaign was suspended for the winter. Both sides resumed hostilities in 1621. In April 1621 an army of 120,000‚Äì160,000 soldiersLeszek Podhorodecki: Chocim 1621, seria: Historyczne bitwy\\", MON, 1988. (sources vary), led by Osman II, advanced from Constantinople and Edirne towards the Polish frontier. Khan Temir of the Budjak Horde and the Khan of Crimea, Canibek Giray joined the battle on the Ottoman side. Approximately 25% of the Ottoman forces were composed of contingents from their vassal states: Tatars, Moldavians and Wallachians, a total of about 13,000 troops. The Ottoman army had about 66 heavy guns. When the Ottomans reached an area near Ia»ôi a distribution of bah≈üi≈ü took place on 26/27 July. There were 34,825 paid Kapikulu soldiers, who were the regular troops. Each one was given 1,000 Ak√ße, for a total of 34,825,000 Ak√ße spent. In Poland, meantime, the Sejm, shaken by the previous year's defeat, agreed to raise taxes and fund a larger army, as well as to recruit a large number of Cossack allies. Polish commander Grand Lithuanian Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz crossed the Dniester River in September 1621 with approximately 20,000 to 35,000 soldiers, joined by 10,000 more led by the future king of Poland, Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw Vasa.Hrushevsky, M., 1999, The History of the Ukrainian Cossacks, Vol. 1, The Cossack Age to 1625, Edmonton: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press, The Polish-Lithuanian army numbered 30,000 (18,000 cavalry, 12,000 infantry) and their allied Cossack army was composed of 25,000‚Äì40,000 troops‚Äîmostly infantry‚Äîled by ataman Petro Konashevych- Sahaidachny. The Cossacks had about 22 guns. Battle Contemporary drawing of battle formations and defenses for the Battle of Chocim, 1621. The inner Khotyn Fortress, the centerpoint of the defense. Most of the fighting took place in the outside parts, not shown on this image. The Polish-Lithuanian army arrived near Khotyn around August 24 and started entrenching itself near the Khotyn Fortress, blocking the path of the Ottoman march. The army followed a common Commonwealth defense strategy when facing large Ottoman forces. It employed deep defences by building separate field works in front of the camp's defences. These field works were designed to allow the use of cavalry counterattacks. Cavalry counterattacks were especially crucial because the Commonwealth relied heavily on its elite Polish Hussars and Cossacks. A semicircle of field fortifications was created. The fortress was behind the fortifications and Dniester River bordered the fortifications. The circle was divided into three sections: right, commanded by Hetman Chodkiewicz; central, commanded by Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw; and left, under Regimentarz Lubomirski. In addition, two fortified camps were set in front of the main defence line: the Cossacks' and the mercenaries' (the famous Lisowczycy unit). On August 27, a Cossack cavalry detachment carried out a suicidal raid, delaying the approaching Ottoman forces. It also inflicted casualties amounting to several times the number of attacking Cossacks, but the attackers were nearly annihilated. On August 31, Ottoman cavalry, in turn, struck at the Cossack forces outside camp. The Ottomans tried to scatter the Cossacks and cut them off from the main Polish-Lithuanian forces, but did not succeed. By September 2, the main Ottoman army had arrived, and the siege began the day after the Cossacks joined the Polish camp. On September 2 the Ottomans tried to breach the unfinished Cossack camp. The Cossacks had received reinforcements from the Polish-Lithuanian army and held their positions. On September 3, another Ottoman assault was directed at Lubomirski's flank of the main fortifications. This attack was stopped. In the afternoon the big Ottoman forces attacked the Cossack camp. This attack started a very fierce fight. The Ottomans were repulsed. The Cossacks rushed up behind the Ottomans into the Ottoman camp and returned at dusk with rich loot. The next day, September 4, the Ottomans again tried to overrun the Cossacks camp but failed again. A Commonwealth counterattack managed to destroy several Ottoman guns in their positions. The experienced Commonwealth forces were able to withstand the Ottoman assaults because the Ottoman forces contained too many cavalry and too many inexperienced artillerymen to be efficient. On September 7, Ottoman troops assaulted the Cossack camp four times, but were repulsed. At noon, the Ottoman soldiers stormed the Polish camp, which had not been attacked so far. Janissaries exploited the Poles' lack of vigilance (the Poles were sleeping) on the right flank of the Polish Army. They stormed into the Polish entrenchments and cut down about a hundred infantrymen. The janissaries were repulsed, but a new assault was expected. Around 10,000 Ottomans moved to attack, but then Chodkiewicz counterattacked with three squadrons of hussars and one squadron of reiters, a total of between 600 and 650 men. He led the attack personally. The Sipahi could not withstand the charge and they retreated chaotically. The Poles pursued them to the camp. Ottomans losses amounted more than 500 killed and Polish losses amounted to 30 killed. The Polish charge inflicted heavy casualties and had a huge impact on the morale of the Ottoman army.Sikora, Rados≈Çaw, Wojskowo≈õƒá polska w dobie wojny polsko- szwedzkiej 1626-1629. Kryzys mocarstwa, Sorus, Pozna≈Ñ 2005, . . On 10 September Chodkiewicz proposed a night attack. An assault was prepared for the night of 12 to 13 September, but just before the attack, there was heavy rainfall and the action had to be canceled. The Cossacks then beheaded Borodavka in retribution. Defending the Polish Banner at Khotyn, Juliusz Kossak, 1892 After several costly (and failed) assaults in the first week of the siege, the Ottomans tried to take the Polish forces by cutting off their supplies and reinforcements and waiting for them to succumb to hunger and disease. A temporary bridge was raised by 14 September over the Dniester River that allowed the Ottomans to stop the Commonwealth fortress from using the river to communicate with another fortress at nearby Kamianets-Podilskyi, Ukraine. It also allowed the Ottomans to shift some of their cannons to the other bank of the river and shell Commonwealth forces from the rear. Another Ottoman assault on 15 September was again repulsed. On 18 September, at night, Cossacks stormed into the Ottoman camp on the Dniester. The attack was successful and the Ottomans suffered heavy losses. A similar attack took place on the night of 21 to 22 September. This time the objective was the lodging of Ohrili H√ºseyin Pasha who was almost taken prisoner. Such actions raised the morale of the Commonwealth troops. Although the Polish defenders were weakened, the Ottomans failed to break their morale. Also, while the defenders were running low on food and supplies, Ottomans had similar problems. On 24 September, a few days before the siege was to be lifted, the aged Grand Hetman died of exhaustion and illness in the camp. Chodkiewicz's second-in-command, Regimentarz Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski, took command of the Polish forces on 23 September, when the ailing hetman passed the command to him. On 25 September Lubomirski ordered his weakened forces to pull back and man a smaller, shorter defensive line; the Ottomans tried another assault hoping for the defenders to be disorganized, but again, the assault failed. A final assault was stopped on 28 September. The lateness of the season, the loss of approximately 40,000 of his men in battle, the general exhaustion of the Ottoman army, and the fact that his large force was also running out of supplies compelled Osman II to accept a request from the defenders to start negotiations,Tucker, S.C., editor, 2010, A Global Chronology of Conflict, Vol. Two, Santa Barbara: ABC- CLIO, LLC, even though the Polish-Lithuanian forces were almost out of supplies (a legend has it that by the end of the siege, the Commonwealth army was down to its last barrel of gunpowder). Aftermath The Death of Chodkiewicz, Franciszek Smuglewicz, 1806 A peace treaty, the Treaty of Khotyn, was signed on 9 Oct., which reflected the indecisive nature of the battle. In some clauses it favoured the Commonwealth, but the Ottoman Empire also got what it wanted. There were no territorial changes; the Commonwealth-Ottoman border was confirmed to be the Dniester River and the Commonwealth recognized Ottoman control over Moldavia. In the Commonwealth, and among the Cossacks, the stopping of the huge Ottoman army was seen as a great victory. Sultan Osman himself was not satisfied with the battle's outcome and put the blame for it on the janissaries. Osman wanted to modernize the army, which he blamed for the defeat; his plans for modernization were, however, opposed by the tradition-minded janissaries. That opposition resulted in the rebellion of janissaries in 1622, in which Osman II was deposed and killed. Having already lost Grand Hetman Chodkiewicz during the battle, the Commonwealth soon lost another of its most notable military figures of the early 17th century in Hetman of Registered Cossacks Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny, who couldn't recover from battle injuries and died several months later. Cultural impact The Battle of Khotyn was the largest battle in the history of the Polish Commonwealth to date, and it was proclaimed as a great victory over the 's'. Among the accounts of the battle is a rather one-sided one from Wac≈Çaw Potocki's Transakcja wojny chocimskiej (The Progress of the War of Chocim), written during the period 1669‚Äì1672. It was based on the less-known Commentariorum Chotinensis belli libri tres (\\"Commentary on the Chocim War in three volumes\\") (diary, published in 1646) by Jakub Sobieski and other sources, now lost. On the Ottoman side, young Sultan Osman II declared publicly that the result of this battle was an Ottoman victory over the 'giaour'. When he returned to Constantinople on 27 December 1621, he entered with a victory procession; there were three days and nights of victory celebrations.N. Sakaoglu (1999) Bu Mulkun Sultanlari (Sultans of This Realm), Istanbul:Oglak p.224 (Turkish) However, the young Sultan was personally very unsatisfied with the result of the battle and the behavior of his household troops, the janissaries, during the campaign and started taking measures to reform the Ottoman military. That attempt led to a revolt in Constantinople by the army, madrasa (religious school) students and wealthy merchants in May 1622, at the end of which Sultan Osman II was deposed and killed by the leaders of the mob.p.192‚Äì3 This revolt and the demise of the young Sultan (who was only 17 when killed) is one of the events most written about by Ottoman historians and appears often in Ottoman court literature and Ottoman popular literature. In the peoples' coffee houses in Istanbul (up to the end of the 19th century) public storytellers used to relate the tales, many in poetry form, of the exploits of Young Osman (including Khotin) and his tragic demise. The Battle of Khotyn is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"CHOCIM 2 IX - 9 X 1621/10 - 11 XI 1673\\".

Production of the range continued until September 1965, by which time a total of 187,000 had been built. History By the mid 1950s, Ford lagged well behind the competition in the light commercial market. The model still on offer until 1957 was the trusty but antiquated Fordson E83W, released in 1938. Studies were therefore made of the competition in this sector, with the Morris Commercial 10 cwt and 15/20 cwt models, of prewar design; Austin 10 cwt, and later their 25 cwt; Trojan 15 cwt van; and the Bedford 10/12 cwt model all coming in for scrutiny. Taking a design lead from the US parent, a well overdue new 10/12/15 cwt range was therefore decided upon, to be of the forward control type all based on the same 'outrigger' chassis. With regard to this 'outrigger chassis', Cab and chassis windscreen variants, (subsequently described as 'open' back) differed from the van, estate car, and express bus body models, (subsequently described as 'closed' back) models by the addition of an extra rear crossmember to support the spare wheel carrier and to close the rear ends of the chassis horns. On the 'closed' back models the nature of the rear bodywork meant the rear crossmember could be omitted for this purpose. Another subtle difference between the 'open' back models Vs. 'closed' back models was the method of body attachment to the chassis. On 'open' back models the rear chassis outriggers were designed to accept customers' own coachwork either attached via welded cleats or bolted directly. This bodywork be it a pickup buck or say an ambulance body typically added extra stability to the rear chassis however should not be considered essential because the chassis design is constructed so as to be sturdy enough without. To promote ease of conversion, 'open' back models had cab bodywork that bolted to the chassis and could therefore be removed easily during the conversion process giving better access to the chassis under. Thames 15 cwt Van (400E) On 'closed' back models this flexibility for conversion was not considered necessary as customers buying an enclosed van type vehicle were unlikely to require access to the chassis in a similar fashion as 'open' back purchasers. More likely modification of the bodywork undertaken by 'closed' back purchasers would constitute removal of roof panels for elevating sections or the addition of windows as can be seen in many motor caravan conversions for example. As a result, it was decided that steel bodywork and cab sections could be welded directly to the chassis in places mainly for ease of construction and consequently adding additional stability to the chassis in a similar fashion to that of a coachbuilder converting an 'open' model. It should be stressed that this welded bodywork was not essential for maintaining acceptable levels of torsional chassis strength, the chassis design of the 'closed' back models should not be considered as 'unitary' for this reason. The correct definition in this case is a 'body reinforced separate chassis'. A wheelbase of was chosen, upon which was accommodated a van body of capacity, After some discussion, independent front suspension was sanctioned, but not of the MacPherson strut type which Dagenham had pioneered in the monocoque passenger car applications for which it had been specifically designed in the first place. This system was considered, but its inclusion in the forward control, forward entrance van would, primarily because of the strut height, have placed serious restrictions on cab design particularly in respect of entry. Instead, a system of coil springs and transverse wishbones was agreed upon. An ideal engine and transmission existed amongst Dagenham's passenger car range, this being the Consul's 1703 cc ohv engine, with its associated three speed gearbox with synchromesh between the upper two ratios and a column gearchange mechanism, and the two pinion differential three quarter floating final drive. The low compression (6.9: 1) version of this engine, developing at 4400 rpm was chosen, with the Consul's regular high compression cylinder head (7.8:1) being optional on the new van, A further option was to be the Perkins 4/99 diesel, this being a 1.6 litre four cylinder unit producing only , therefore somewhat marginal from a performance viewpoint but offering useful long term economies over the petrol engine. From January 1963 an improved version of the 1703 cc engine was introduced for the range being uprated to in low compression form, while for premium petrol users a high compression head was offered which gave this Zephyr 4 unit an output of . A four speed all synchromesh gearbox was also available from this time, and if fitted a heavy duty back axle with a four pinion differential was specified. Production commenced in September 1957, with the model being announced as the Thames 400E series. A bold Thames nameplate appeared on the front beneath which was a circular emblem containing the appropriate figure identifying the vehicle's capacity class. The new model quickly met with widespread approval, and passenger transport use was soon being catered for with the availability of an 8/10 seater estate car derivative, and a 12-seat minibus based on the 15 cwt model. The success of the estate car variant was such that it later became available in a De Luxe configuration, complete with chrome plated overriders for its front bumper, chrome side mouldings and window trims, and dual exterior mirrors. In March 1965, when the D series trucks were introduced, all commercial vehicle models took the Ford name so the 400E then appeared with a Ford nameplate on the front panel. The range did not continue in this guise for very long, the last models being built in August 1965 pending the introduction of a new range of vans which had been tested and developed since about 1963 under the codename of Redcap. Special bodies Thames 15 cwt Chassis Cab (400E) Within only a short period of time a wide variety of special bodies was available from outside suppliers, with Ford approval for these being confirmed in many cases by their inclusion in the Ford Motor Company's official glossy brochures. Mobile shops, milk floats, ambulances, flat platform trucks with generators or compressors and box vans, and the popular pick up trucks all appeared. Other special bodies graced the pages of the 400E range catalogue, including tower wagons, luton vans, and an unusual flat truck with an air compressor. Called the Powertruc this was no ordinary air compressor truck, for it featured a design whereby the engine of the compressor also propelled the Vehicle from its position at the rear of the cab. The Powertruc name appeared at the front in place of the usual Thames nameplate. By 1961 the pickup had become so popular that it was available as a standard model, being catalogued along with the chassis/cab, van and 12 seater, but Walkers of Watford produced their own particular style of pickup, which could be recognised by its substantial box section down the sides compared with the flush sides of the standard Ford pickup. A small tipper body with screw type gear was also listed, as was a standard dropside truck. Several styles of van body were offered, such as a box body of , a van body of , a pantechnicon with integral cab offering capacity or with a factory cab . A milk float was also listed, as was a body style called a canopy pickup. This was a conversion of the standard panel van, but with the roof and sides down to the waist rail removed from a point about halfway along to the rear. The rear doors were also removed and a drop tailboard substituted, while a partition was put at the back of the cab area and a tip up seat built on to this bulkhead. The Eagle Engineering Company of Warwick produced small tower wagon equipment for the 400E, and Tuke and Bell supplied a special little slide cover refuse truck just the job for narrow alleys or pedestrian precincts. Left hand drive versions Left hand drive 400E models were available from the start, thus ensuring healthy overseas sales, with one of the many European countries taking the 400E van being Denmark where the Ford Motor Company had an assembly plant. Ford of Denmark sales staff requested authority from Britain to market an increased wheelbase chassis cab version of the 400E and with a six cylinder (Zephyr) engine as an option, to meet specific local demands, and a senior truck engineer from Rainham travelled to Ford's Copenhagen plant to investigate the possibility. Danish Ministry of Transport approval was also necessary and all testing on its behalf was carried out at the University of Denmark's laboratories. Appropriate care had been taken in lengthening the chassis frame, and after the lengthened propeller shaft had successfully undergone testing which would have revealed any shortcomings such as vibration due to run-out, or critical whirling (resonant) speeds the conversion received the approval of the Danish ministry and Ford of Britain's senior truck engineer. 400E 10/12 and 15 cwt models Ever since the days of the first Model T trucks the Ford Motor Company always had a vehicle in the popular 10/15/20 cwt category, although with the speedy 15 cwt normal control model of 1939 being discontinued a year or so later only the E83W 10 cwt van was available immediately after the war, whereas Morris had their 10 cwt model Y and the PV 15/20 cwt, both of them prewar designs. Commer retained their 8 cwt van, which was updated in 1947, plus the larger 25 cwt van, while Austin produced a 10 cwt van, and then narrowed the gap between their larger trucks by introducing the 25 cwt '3 way' in 1947. Trojan were also there with their 15 cwt van, while Bedford had the PCV 10/12 cwt and the K 30 cwt, so there was plenty of variety in that particularly lucrative area of the market. In some ways the 15/20/25 cwt payload area was a bit of a no man's land. The smaller 5 cwt, 8 cwt and 10 cwt vans were usually car based, while the larger payload vehicles of 30 cwt, 2 ton and upwards were designed as trucks with little or no relationship to their passenger car cousins. In between is the 'grey' area, where the vehicles require a larger frame, springs, etc., to carry more weight than the larger saloons of the period, yet can suffer from a high unladen weight (and tax) if the beefier frames and axles of the real trucks are used. In the past there had been several contenders in this field, Ford, for instance, offering a choice of no less than three different engines for their 1939 15 cwt van, , and . These were some of the vehicles chosen to tow trailer fire pumps at the start of the war, no doubt because of their performance potential in an emergency situation. Another rather special type of van had come into use by some of the newspaper distributors, who required a vehicle of about , but with the performance of a sports car! The 15 cwt Ford was used for this type of operation in prewar days, as was the Chrysler Dodge of similar capacity. Large car chassis were also taken into use, the Humber Hawk and Snipe being in this category, while when they disappeared the Austin FX3 taxi chassis was used as a basis for these vans. Ford's entry into this field was the Pilot, a postwar design derivative of one of their popular prewar V 8 saloons. The chassis of this model was available for specialist bodywork, and a number of them appeared as high powered vans and pickups, many going for export. However, because of its minimal load space as a bonnetted vehicle the Pilot was not very saleable to run of the mill van users, a drawback also shared by the Standard Vanguard van and pickup of similar layout and the Austin A70 Hampshire. What the market required was a van of 10/15/20 cwt capacity, but built within a confined space, with the larger 'portion of the bodywork given over to the carrying area. This precluded the bonnetted layout unless it was of minimal protrusion. Ford's answer to the problem came in 1957, when the 400E 10/12 and 15 cwt models were announced. In one stroke Ford had produced a van which was good looking, capacious, convenient and particularly nippy. By utilizing the engine of the best selling Consul the van was assured of a lively performance, and by mounting the unit low down in the frame between the front wheels, it was possible for the driver to slide over the engine cover if nearside exit was demanded. Some users criticised the use of hinged doors, feeling that sliding doors would be of more use for quick exits or in confined places, but others were quick to point out the drawbacks of this type of door. With a plain panel sided van sliding doors are OK, but the 400E was designed to have access to the body via a side door in addition to the double rear doors. It was also produced as a chassis/cab for pickup or other style of special bodywork, so precluding the use of sliding doors, and anyone who has had experience of them knows they are a mixed blessing when one comes to repair them. Whereas the old E83W was a regular, steady little van which by 1957 was ripe for replacement, the new van was destined to become twice as popular as its predecessor. It was quickly taken up by all manner of users and acquired for itself a special niche in the world of transport. The model was available as in integral all steel panel van with hinged doors to the cab and a pair of hinged doors at the rear; an additional hinged door on the nearside was an optional extra. It was available in two payload ratings 10/12 cwt and 15 cwt. The second standard body was the 8/10seat estate car, which had three windows to each side to the rear of the cab section, one of these being in the standard nearside door with automatic folding step for easy entry. For the mounting of special bodies the 400E was available in chassis only, chassis/scuttle, and chassis/cab form. Within a short while a 12-seater variation of the estate car appeared, this time with longitudinal seats and a fixed step to the rear. In contemporary literature this model was called a '12 seater bus', and the previous transverse seat model was not shown, although it was still listed in the price schedule. In early catalogues of the range a de luxe version of the 15 cwt estate car was shown complete with chrome overriders to the front bumpers, chrome exterior mouldings, chrome window trims and a two tone colour scheme. Two exterior mirrors were fitted as well as more luxurious interior trim and fittings. Whether because of the higher rate of purchase tax which was current at the time, or for some other reason, very few of the de luxe estate cars appear to have been sold in Britain. In fact it was not long before the estate car was dropped in favour of the largercapacity 12 seat bus, this being listed as from September 1958. This 12 seater did not attract purchase tax, the Government thinking behind this probably assuming that no one would buy a 12¬¨seater in place of a private car, unless he had about 10 children! As with the older type of 10 cwt van, the new 400E range found plenty of scope for special bodywork. Although the 'official' pickup was not catalogued until February 1961, others had been built by individual bodybuilders to order, as well as tippers, high top vans, etc. One interesting conversion was carried out by Normand on some special insulated vans for delivering ice cream. From the offside the van could be taken for a standard production 15 cwt at first sight, although at close range the shape was not exactly the same as the Ford body. Closer inspection revealed that the body was in fact thickly insulated and that the nearside door of the cab was louvred to provide ventilation for the refrigeration equipment carried in the nearside of the cab compartment. Also available from February 1961 was the Perkins 4/99 diesel engine for those who chose economy before performance. Bus versions As well as making the 12 seater bus, Martin Walter produced another version called the Farmer's Model Utilabrake, which had two front upholstered seats, but plainwood slatted seats arranged along the sides of the rear part of the body. For a little comfort pvc backrests were supplied for the longitudinal seats, unlike their other Work bus 12 seater, which was designed for rough usage and did not have this comfort for its occupants. Other interesting conversions of the 15 cwt were special PSV models which were produced by Martin Walter and Kenex. The Martin Walter model was the Utilabus PSV, which could be obtained with both side and rear doors or merely a rear only. To comply with the current PSV regulations it had a raised reinforced plastics roof panel in order to achieve the required headroom. Vertical grab rails were provided at the rear, the seats had the necessary spacing, and a bar type lifeguard was fitted below the side of the body between the wheelarches. The Kenex company offered two models which complied with current PSV regulations the Kenebus 12 seater and the Kenecoach for 11 passengers. The Kenebus had longitudinal seats and a bar type separator for the driver's compartment, while the Kenecoach used transverse seating and had a panelled divider to keep the passengers from bothering the driver. Kenex also offered their own version of the ordinary 12 seater light bus without PSV certificate of fitness, this being the Kenebrake if supplied with upholstered seats, or the Yeoman if fitted with wood slat type seating. From a distance, the Kenex PSV types are distinguishable by their lifeguards, which are made up of solid panels as opposed to the slat type of Martin Walter models. Motor caravan conversions The Thames van was also instrumental in helping the motorised caravan or campervan to establish itself in a period when people were extending their horizons with regard to holidays and camping. The Ford Thames 15 cwt van formed an ideal base for a motor caravan because it could double as an ordinary vehicle during the week and be used for picnics or breaks away from home at weekends. Its roughly square shape lent itself well to conversion to a caravan, as many people had noticed when they saw the estate car and 12 seater bus versions. Another virtue of the vehicle was its engine size. for at it was considerably larger than its contemporaries and was well suited to the considerable weight of some of the caravan conversions. For convenience a higher roof line was needed, although some conversions used the elevating or folding extensions to minimise travelling height and cost. The Martin Walters conversions, known as the Dormobile were once synonymous with the word campervan. In fact before the modern popularity of the VW campervan most people used the brand name Dormobile to describe a campervan. Nowadays, it has become popular to hire a classic campervan but out of the numerous campervan hire companies out there, only one is offering the British made Ford Thames 400e Dormobile. M. Calthorpe (Coachbuilders) Ltd.; Airborne Service Equipment Ltd.; Kenex Coachworks Ltd.; Moortown Motors Ltd.; M.T.S. & Co. Ltd.; Peter Pitt; and Martin Walter Ltd., all appeared in Ford's \\"Holiday Adventurers\\" brochure dealing exclusively with motor caravans. Retrospect Looking back on the 400E series today it can be seen as an important link in the chain of Ford van models that have appeared over the years. Compared with the old E83W it represented a massive step forward, notably in its engine, body, gear change, suspension and capacity. It was also an important go- between, for it must have provided its designers with a new concept upon which to improve, and improve they did as we shall see when looking at its successor. Unlike the smaller vans, the 400E series changed very little in its lifetime, which was understandable as there was no direct association with a passenger car variant which required constant facelifting to satisfy the car buying public. The range started and finished much the same, although as it went on it gathered more body styles, even the early 8 seater estate car returning in the last few years of its existence. For deliveries it was most useful, especially with the nearside door to get at the load; also, it was so easy to slip over the offside wheelarch down to the ground in one step when making your exit from the cab.

In the town there is a monument to the victims of the S.S. History Glaubitz derives from the Slavic words glubka, glubiza what little Tiefenort means from. The place was in the settlement area of the Daleminzier. The place Glaubitz was first mentioned in 1271, then under the Slavic name \\"Glubozk\\". In 1319 a church was first mentioned. In 1408 Poppe is located on Glaubitz of K√∂ckeritz and Glaubitz was a castle besieged by the Margrave of Brandenburg. In 1585, the Bush Mill (Gr√ºtzm√ºhle), a water mill with two grinding passes arose. Four years later, the construction of the church took place. The rule was exercised by inheritance and upper courts. In 1642, during the Thirty Years War, the Swedish main army moved through Lennart Torstensson Glaubitz towards a large grove. During the Seven Years' War on November 17, 1757 a cavalry engagement occurred between Glaubitz and a wild grove. In 1781 for the first time a school is mentioned. 1886 a new school was built, which had to be enlarged in 1905 due to increased student enrollment. In 1904 the volunteer fire brigade was founded. In 1934/35, the settlement was built on the road of youth, then the channel complex. The First and the Second World War had many victims in Glaubitz. On April 17, 1945, a column of concentration camp prisoners reached Glaubitz. During a break on the sports field, many prisoners escaped during an air raid. The recaptured in space Glaubitz of the Hitler Youth prisoners were shot and buried in Glaubitzer forest. A monument commemorates it today. On April 24, 1945, Hitler's army was defeated in this area. On November 4, 1945, the Committee for mutual aid, Bauer, was established and distributed 399 acres of land from expropriation of 73 new farmers under the land reform. 1953 the LPG 4 farmers was established, some of the LPG operating channel region was later. In 1967, the residential blocks built \\"On Robbery castle\\". Today houses dot the village. After the turn of the streets \\"Stephan Poschingerstra√üe\\" and \\"Seebergblick\\" were built.

Its evolutionary affinities are not fully resolved, though it may be related to true guitarfishes and skates. This rare species occurs widely in the tropical coastal waters of the western Indo-Pacific, at depths of up to . Highly distinctive in appearance, Rhina ancylostoma has a wide and thick body with a rounded snout and large shark-like dorsal and tail fins. Its mouth forms a W-shaped undulating line, and there are multiple thorny ridges over its head and back. It has a dorsal color pattern of many white spots over a bluish gray to brown background, with a pair of prominent black markings over the pectoral fins. This large species can reach a length of and weight of . Usually found near the sea floor, Rhina ancylostoma prefers sandy or muddy areas near underwater structures. It is a strong-swimming predator of bony fishes, crustaceans, and molluscs. This species gives live birth to litters of two to eleven pups, which are nourished during gestation by yolk. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed Rhina ancylostoma as Vulnerable because it is widely caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries for its valuable fins and meat. It is viewed as a nuisance by trawlers, however, because its bulk and thorny skin cause it to damage netted catches. Habitat degradation and destruction pose an additional, significant challenge to this ray's survival. Rhina ancylostoma adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums. Taxonomy and phylogeny German naturalists Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider described Rhina ancylostoma in their 1801 Systema Ichthyologiae. Their account was based on a long specimen, now lost, collected off the Coromandel Coast of India. The genus name Rhina comes from the Greek rhinos (\\"snout\\"); the specific epithet ancylostoma is derived from the Greek ankylos (\\"curved\\" or \\"crooked\\") and stoma (\\"mouth\\"). Although Block and Schneider wrote the epithet as ancylostomus and that form appears in some literature, most modern sources regard the correct form to be ancylostoma. Other common names for this species include shark ray, mud skate, shortnose mud skate, bow-mouthed angel fish, and bow-mouthed angel shark. The evolutionary relationships between Rhina ancylostoma and other rays are debated. Morphological evidence generally points to a close relationship between Rhina, Rhynchobatus and Rhynchorhina, which are a group of rays known as the wedgefishes that also have large, shark-like fins. Morphological analyses have tended to place these two genera basally among rays, though some have them as basal to just the guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) and skates (Rajidae) while others have them basal to all other rays except sawfishes (Pristidae). A 2012 study based on mitochondrial DNA upheld Rhina and Rhynchobatus as sister taxa related to the guitarfishes, but also unexpectedly found that they formed a clade with the sawfishes rather than the skates. Following the description of Rhynchorhina in 2016, a study of mtDNA found that it is part of the same group and their phylogenetic relationship is ((Rhynchobatus+Rhynchorhina)+Rhina). In terms of classification, Bloch and Schneider originally placed the bowmouth guitarfish in the order Abdominales, a now-obsolete grouping of fishes defined by the positioning of their pelvic fins directly behind the pectoral fins. Modern sources have included it variously in the order Rajiformes, Rhinobatiformes, Rhiniformes, or the newly proposed Rhinopristiformes. The placement of the bowmouth guitarfish in the family Rhinidae originates from the group \\"Rhinae\\", consisting of Rhina and Rhynchobatus, in Johannes M√ºller and Jakob Henle's 1841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. Later authors have also assigned this species to the family Rhinobatidae or Rhynchobatidae. Joseph Nelson, in the 2006 fourth edition of Fishes of the World, placed this species as the sole member of Rhinidae in the order Rajiformes, which is supported by morphological but not molecular data. More recent authorities have placed it in Rhinidae together with Rhynchobatus and Rhynchorhina, reflecting both genetic data and the morphologically intermediate position of Rhynchobatus between Rhina and Rhynchorhina. Description The rounded head, humpbacked profile, and large fins of Rhina ancylostoma give it a unique appearance. Rhina ancylostoma is a heavily built fish growing to long and in weight. The head is short, wide, and flattened with an evenly rounded snout; the front portion of the head, including the medium-sized eyes and large spiracles, is clearly distinct from the body. The long nostrils are transversely oriented and have well-developed skin flaps on their anterior margins. The lower jaw has three protruding lobes that fit into corresponding depressions in the upper jaw. There are around 47 upper and 50 lower tooth rows arranged in winding bands; the teeth are low and blunt with ridges on the crown. The five pairs of ventral gill slits are positioned close to the lateral margins of the head. The body is deepest in front of the two tall and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is about a third larger than the second and originates over the pelvic fin origins. The second dorsal fin is located midway between the first dorsal and the caudal fin. The broad and triangular pectoral fins have a deep indentation where their leading margins meet the head. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins, and the anal fin is absent. The tail is much longer than the body and ends in a large, crescent-shaped caudal fin; the lower caudal fin lobe is more than half the length of the upper. The entire dorsal surface has a grainy texture from a dense covering of tiny dermal denticles. A thick ridge is present along the midline of the back, which bears a band of sharp, robust thorns. There are also a pair of thorn-bearing ridges in front of the eyes, a second pair running from above the eyes to behind the spiracles, and a third pair on the \\"shoulders\\". This species is bluish to brownish gray above, lightening towards the margins of the head and over the pectoral fins. There are prominent white spots scattered over the body and fins, a white-edged black marking above each pectoral fin, and two dark transverse bands atop the head between the eyes. The underside is light gray to white. Young rays are more vividly colored than adults, which are browner with fainter patterning and proportionately smaller spots. Distribution and habitat While uncommon, Rhina ancylostoma is widely distributed in the coastal tropical waters of the western Indo-Pacific. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa to the Red Sea (including the Seychelles), across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia (including the Maldives), to Shark Bay in Western Australia. Its Pacific range extends northward to Korea and southern Japan, eastward to New Guinea, and southward to New South Wales. Found between deep, this ray spends most of its time near the sea floor but can occasionally be seen swimming in midwater. It favors sandy or muddy habitats, and can also be found in the vicinity of rocky and coral reefs and shipwrecks. Biology and ecology The tiger shark preys on Rhina ancylostoma. Rhina ancylostoma is a strong swimmer that propels itself with its tail like a shark. It is more active at night and is not known to be territorial. This species feeds mainly on demersal bony fishes such as croakers and crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp; bivalves and cephalopods are also consumed. Its bands of flattened teeth allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. Curiously, two Rhina ancylostoma examined in a 2011 stable isotope study were found to have fed on pelagic rather than demersal animals, in contrast to previous observations. The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is known to prey on Rhina ancylostoma. The ray is protected by the thorns on its head and back, and it may ram perceived threats. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms Carpobothrium rhinei, Dollfusiella michiae, Nybelinia southwelli, Stoibocephalum arafurense, and Tylocephalum carnpanulatum, the leech Pontobdella macrothela, the trematode Melogonimus rhodanometra, the monogeneans Branchotenthes robinoverstreeti and Monocotyle ancylostomae, and the copepods Nesippus vespa, Pandarus cranchii, and P. smithii. There is a record of a Rhina ancylostoma being cleaned by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus). Reproduction in Rhina ancylostoma is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained to term by yolk. Adult females have a single functional ovary and uterus. The litter size varies between two and eleven pups, and newborns measure long. Sexual maturity is attained at lengths of for males and over in females. Females grow larger than males. Human interactions \\"Sweet Pea\\", a female Rhina ancylostoma at the Newport Aquarium. Throughout its range, Rhina ancylostoma is caught incidentally or intentionally by artisanal and commercial fisheries using trawls, gillnets, and line gear. The fins are extremely valuable due to their use in shark fin soup, and are often the only parts of the fish kept and brought to market. However, the meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted, and it is highly esteemed in India. When caught as bycatch in trawls, Rhina ancylostoma is considered a nuisance because its strength and rough skin make it difficult to handle, and as the heavy ray thrashes in the net it can damage the rest of the catch. In Thailand, the enlarged thorns of this species are used to make bracelets. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed Rhina ancylostoma as Critically endangered in 2019, delisted from the vulnerable category, along with many other guitarfish species. It is threatened by fishing and by habitat destruction and degradation, particularly from blast fishing, coral bleaching, and siltation. Its numbers are known to have declined substantially in Indonesian waters, where it is one of the large rays targeted by a mostly unregulated gillnet fishery. The IUCN has given this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened in Australian waters, where it is not a targeted species but is taken as bycatch in bottom trawls. The installation of turtle excluder devices on some Australian trawlers has benefited this species. Since it is rare and faces many conservation threats, Rhina ancylostoma has been called \\"the panda of the aquatic world\\". It is a popular subject of public aquariums and fares relatively well, with one individual having lived for seven years in captivity. In 2007, the Newport Aquarium in Kentucky initiated the world's first captive breeding program for this species. Newport Aquarium announced in January 2014 that the female, \\"Sweet Pea\\", had become pregnant and given birth to seven pups. By February 2014, all seven pups had died. On January 7, 2016, Sweet Pea gave birth to nine shark pups which were eating on their own and still gaining weight by February 10, 2016. Newport Aquarium later announced that the pups would be moved into a coral reef exhibit where they can be viewed by the public starting on June 24. The species also bred at the S.E.A. Aquarium in Singapore in 2015.

While so called global or inner iterations represent the real time-steps and are used to update the variables \\\\mathbf{v} and p, based on a linearized system, and boundary conditions; there is also an outer loop for updating the coefficients of the linearized system. The outer iterations comprise two steps: # Solve the momentum equation for a provisional velocity based on the velocity and pressure of the previous outer loop. # Plug the new newly obtained velocity into the continuity equation to obtain a correction. The correction for the velocity that is obtained from the second equation one has with incompressible flow, the non-divergence criterion or continuity equation : abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v} = 0 is computed by first calculating a residual value \\\\dot{m}, resulting from spurious mass flux, then using this mass imbalance to get a new pressure value. The pressure value that is attempted to compute, is such that when plugged into momentum equations a divergence-free velocity field results. The mass imbalance is often also used for control of the outer loop. The name of this class of methods stems from the fact that the correction of the velocity field is computed through the pressure-field. The discretization of this is typically done with either the finite element method or the finite volume method. With the latter, one might also encounter the dual mesh, i.e. the computation grid obtained from connecting the centers of the cells that the initial subdivision into finite elements of the computation domain yielded.  Implicit split-update procedures  Another approach which is typically used in FEM is the following. The aim of the correction step is to ensure conservation of mass. In continuous form for compressible substances mass, conservation of mass is expressed by : abla\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\mathbf{v}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{d}{dt}p(\\\\mathbf{x})}{c^2} where c^2 is the square of the \\"speed of sound\\". For low Mach numbers and incompressible media c is assumed to be infinite, which is the reason for the above continuity equation to reduce to : \\\\begin{align} abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v} &= 0 \\\\end{align} The way of obtaining a velocity field satisfying the above, is to compute a pressure which when substituted into the momentum equation leads to the desired correction of a preliminary computed intermediate velocity. Applying the divergence operator to the compressible momentum equation yields : \\\\begin{align} abla\\\\cdot\\\\partial_t \\\\mathbf{v} &= - abla\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\mathbf{v} + abla\\\\cdot abla^2\\\\mathbf{v} - abla^2 p\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\partial_t abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v} &= - abla\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\mathbf{v} + abla^2 abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v} - abla^2 p\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &= - abla\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\mathbf{v} - abla^2 p\\\\\\\\\\\\ abla^2 p &= - abla\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\mathbf{v} & (\\\\ast) \\\\end{align} (\\\\ast) then provides the governing equation for pressure computation. The idea of pressure-correction also exists in the case of variable density and high Mach numbers, although in this case there is a real physical meaning behind the coupling of dynamic pressure and velocity as arising from the continuity equation : \\\\begin{align} \\\\partial_t \\\\rho &= abla\\\\cdot(\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v})\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\partial_t \\\\rho &= \\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\partial_t p \\\\end{align} p is with compressibility, still an additional variable that can be eliminated with algebraic operations, but its variability is not a pure artifice as in the compressible case, and the methods for its computation differ significantly from those with \\\\rho = \\\\text{constant}.

In 1888 it was merged into a national school, The Third Higher Middle School was headquartered in Osaka (-1889) / Kyoto (1889-). to constitute the Medical Faculty. The Medical Faculty became an independent school in 1901 and was renamed , a four-year medical school for men ages 17‚Äì21 or above. In 1922, the school was chartered as , a four-year medical college for men ages 19‚Äì23 or above. In 1949, after World War II, the college was merged with other national and public colleges in Okayama Prefecture to establish Okayama University, under Japan's new education system. The predecessors of the university were Okayama Medical College, , , and . The new campus (Tsushima Campus) was the former camp of the Imperial Japanese Army (the 17th Division). After occupation army left the camp in 1947, the students of the Sixth Higher School (whose buildings were burnt in the war) guarded the camp, residing in the former military barracks. Later, the camp became their campus. The faculties of Okayama University, except the Medical School, were gradually relocated to Tsushima Campus. The university at first had five faculties: Law and Letters, Education, Science, Agriculture and Medicine. The latter history of the university is as follows: *1951: joined the university. Later reorganized into the Institute for Agricultural and Biological Sciences (in 1953) and then the Research Institute for Bioresources (in 1988). *1960: the Faculty of Engineering was established. *1967: Professor Jun Kobayashi (analytic chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture) announced the cause of Itai-itai disease as cadmium poisoning.

It is restricted to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and western Indian Ocean, but was formerly considered more widespread due to confusion with its relatives.Kyne, P.M., Gledhill, K. & Jabado, R.W. 2019.

Taxonomy and range The giant guitarfish was previously believed to range throughout a large part of the Indo-Pacific, but recent evidence has shown that it, as traditionally defined, actually was a species complex consisting of four different species. In addition to the giant guitarfish, this complex includes the white-spotted guitarfish, the broadnose wedgefish and possibly the smoothnose wedgefish. With these as separate species, the giant guitarfish has a relatively restricted range: It is found only in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and the western Indian Ocean as far south as South Africa. Description A large fish reaching up to long and weighing as much as . It is brownish or greyish above with a variable pattern of white spots. Juveniles have a black spot above each pectoral fin, but in adults it is a dusky ring or absent. There is a dark, bar-like pattern between the eyes (on top of the head), which separates it from the other Rhynchobatus species in its range. Behavior =Breeding= It is ovoviviparous, and a female can give birth to litters of up to 10 young.Lieske, E. and Myers, R.F. (2004) Coral reef guide; Red Sea London, HarperCollins =Diet= The giant guitarfish feeds on bivalves, crabs, lobsters, squid and small fish. Ventral view. Habitat It is a shy fish, found from depth, inhabiting areas with sandy sea floor. These are generally around coastal reefs or reef flats, but they will sometimes venture into the brackish waters of estuaries. Interaction with man The giant guitarfish is harmless to humans. It is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN red list as its population are believed to have declined significantly due to unregulated high levels of exploitation for its flesh and fins; the latter for shark fin soup. Its low fecundity and presumed slow growth rate make it highly vulnerable to unsustainable exploitation.

The Main Building of the College was constructed in the year 1911. Law education In order to practice law in Sri Lanka, a lawyer must be admitted and enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court. To receive admission to the bar, a law student must complete law exams held by the Sri Lanka Law College. The course of study for law students at Sri Lanka Law College does not grant any degree or certification; however, at completion of studies, examination and a period of apprenticeship, qualifies individuals for admission to the profession. Graduates holding LLB degrees from the University of Colombo, the Open University of Sri Lanka or any other university will be required to complete several examinations and the period of apprenticeship to become an Attorney-at-Law by receiving admission to the bar. The SLLC carries out several post-attorney courses including an LLM from the University of Wales and post-attorney diplomas in intellectual property law and international trade law. Since the late 1980s, admission has been from a very competitive entrance exam due to the high number of applicants. However, young Members of Parliament without higher educational qualifications receive direct admission without setting for the entrance exam. Student Unions The Law Students' Union of Sri Lanka (LSU) The first president of the Law Students' Union was Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, KC, CMG The Law Students' Union was founded in 1894 as the Ceylon Law Students' Union. The first president was Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, KC, CMG. The first meeting was held on June 13, 1894. With the implementation of the new rules in 1937, a student was elected as president of the L.S.U, rather than the previous practice where an experienced lawyer was appointed to that post. In 1970, the rules were further amended to give the student community greater control over their own affairs. Since that time another amendment was made creating the posts of Social and Welfare Secretary and that of editorial assistant. However, this amendment has not been put down in writing, and has been carried out by convention. In 1991, the union amended its rules further to create the posts of Education Secretary and Assistant Education Secretary in order to protect and safeguard the educational necessities of the student community. The rules were also translated into Sinhala by the Law Students' Union of 1989 and 1991. In 1995 the rules were amended which resulted changing the name to the Law Students' Union of Sri Lanka. This amendment also created the law students' sports fund. The Law Students' Sinhala Union of Sri Lanka (LSSU) Sri Lanka Law College, which was established in 1874, is one of the oldest and leading professional educational institution of Sri Lanka and operating within it is the Law Students' Sinhala Union which can be introduced as one of the leading student unions with a history of dedicated service to law students for the past 73 years. The law student Sinhala Union was established in 1943, in the wake of a renaissance against colonialism, when people irrespective of their race or religion joining hands together in the struggle for independence. Thus it was this Union that spearheaded the law students' contribution to this movement. The Law Students' Sinhala Union which was hence established was formalised and re-structured as an organised student union by Dr. C. Ananda Grero. Notable alumni As one of the oldest professional training bodies it has trained all the lawyers in the country who have served not only in the field of law but also various other fields such as politics, social reforms, commerce, trade unions and religion.

His work documents the rapid modernization and Westernization Japanese underwent during the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912) and employs a sense of light and shade called inspired by Western art techniques. His work first found an audience in the 1870s with prints of red-brick buildings and trains that had proliferated after the Meiji Restoration; his prints of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì95 were also popular. Woodblock printing fell out of favour during this period, and many collectors consider Kobayashi's work the last significant example of ukiyo-e. Life and career Kiyochika was born Kobayashi Katsunosuke () on 10 September 1847 (the first day of the eighth month of the ninth year of K≈çka on the Japanese calendar) in neighbourhood of Honjo in Edo (modern Tokyo). His father was Kobayashi Mohƒì (), who worked as a minor official in charge of unloading rice collected as taxes. His mother Chikako () was the daughter of another such official, Matsui Yasunosuke (). The 1855 Edo earthquake destroyed the family home but left the family unharmed. Though the youngest of his parents' nine children, Kiyochika took over as head of the household upon his father's death in 1862 and changed his name from Katsunosuke. As a subordinate to a kanj≈ç-bugy≈ç official Kiyochika travelled to Kyoto in 1865 with Tokugawa Iemochi's retinue, the first shogunal visit to Kyoto in over two centuries. They continued to Osaka, where Kiyochika thereafter made his home. During the Boshin War in 1868 Kiyochika participated on the side of the sh≈çgun in the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi in Kyoto and returned to Osaka after defeat of the sh≈çgun's forces. He returned by land to Edo and re-entered the employ of the sh≈çgun. After the fall of Edo he relocated to Shizuoka, the heartland of the Tokugawa clan, where he stayed for the next several years. Kiyochika returned to the renamed Tokyo in May 1873 with his mother, who died there that September. He began to concentrate on art and associated with such artists as Shibata Zeshin and Kawanabe Ky≈çsai, under whom he may have studied painting. In 1875, he began producing series of ukiyo-e prints of the rapidly modernizing and Westernizing Tokyo and is said to have studied Western-style painting under Charles Wirgman. In August, 1876 he produced the first (, \\"light-ray pictures\\"), ukiyo-e prints employing Western-style naturalistic light and shade, possibly under the influence of the photography of Shimooka Renj≈ç. Kobayashi Kiyochika (1876) View of Tokyo's Shin-Ohashi bridge in Rain.jpgView of Tokyo's Shin- Ohashi bridge in Rain, 1876 Kobayashi Kiyochika (1879) View of Takanawa Ushimachi under a Shrouded Moon.jpgView of Takanawa Ushimachi under a Shrouded Moon, 1879 The Ryogoku Fire Sketched from Hamacho on the 26th of January, 1881 LACMA M.71.100.49.jpgThe Ry≈çgoku Fire Sketched from Hama-ch≈ç, 1881 began training under Kiyochika in 1878 and saw his own works published beginning in 1880. Kiyochika's house burned down in the Great Fire at Ry≈çgoku of 26 January 1881 while he was out sketching. He sketched the Great Fire at Hisamatsu-ch≈ç of 11 February, and these fires became the basis of well- received prints such as Fire at Ryogoku from Hama-cho and Outbreak of Fire Seen from Hisamatsu-cho. Demand for his prints decreased in the 1880s and Kiyochika turned to comic images for newspapers. The Dandan-sha publishing company employed him from late 1881, and caricatures of his appeared in each issue of the satirical from August 1882. He continued to produce prints, but at a less frequent pace. These were produced primarily from 1876 to 1881; Kiyochika would continue to publish ukiyo-e prints for the rest of his life, but also worked extensively in illustrations and sketches for newspapers, magazines, and books. He also produced a number of prints depicting scenes from the Sino-Japanese War and Russo-Japanese War, collaborating with caption writer Koppi Dojin, penname of Nishimori Takeki (1861-1913), to contribute a number of illustrations to the propaganda series Nihon banzai hyakusen hyakush≈ç (\\"Long live Japan: 100 victories, 100 laughs\\"). The Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì95 saw a revival in popularity for prints and Kiyochika was one of the most prolific producers of them. Thereafter the print market shrank, and Kiyochika's wife opened a business selling fans and postcards to help support them. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì05 provided another opportunity for such patriotic prints, but they found much less popularity by then. Kiyochika produced only eighteen triptychs and a few comic prints, of generally lower quality than his earlier prints. Rather, photographs from the front dominated the market.

His wife Yoshiko died in 1912. Kiyochika spent July to October 1915 in Nagano Prefecture and visited the Asama Onsen hot springs in Matsumoto to treat his rheumatism. On 28 November 1915 Kiyochika died at his Tokyo home in Nakazato, Kita Ward. His grave is at Ry≈´fuku-in Temple in Motoasakusa. Personal life Kiyochika married Fujita Kinu () in April 1876; they had two daughters: Kinko (, b. 1878) and Tsuruko (, b. 1881). Kiyochika and separated from Kinu around 1883 and remarried in 1884 to Tajima Yoshiko (, d. 13 April 1912), with whom he had three further daughters: Natsuko (, b. 1886), Seiko (, 1890‚Äì99), and Katsu (, b. 1894). Style and analysis His caricatures in the Marumaru Chinbun probably represent Kiyochika's best-remembered work. The humour frequently targeted differences between the Japanese and foreigners, whose numbers were increasing in Japan, albeit restricted to certain locations, under the conditions of the unequal treaties the Meiji government had been coerced into signing. Kiyochika depicted foreigners as foolish and whose inexpensive modern wares he presented as aesthetically inferior to traditional domestic ones. Kiyochika's open criticism of the foreign community was unusual amongst contemporary caricaturists. He depicts the Russians as cowardly buffoons in his caricatures from the Russo-Japanese War period; generally they are of lower quality than his earlier cartoons. Kiyochika's prints show a concern with light and shadow, most likely an influence of the Western-style painting that came in vogue in Japan in the 1870s. He used a subdued palette in his prints without the harsher aniline dyes that had come into use earlier in the century. His specialty was night scenes illuminated by sources within the composition, such as by lamps. The colours give his prints a sombre air that discourages a clearly affirmative reading of the modernization it depicts. Kiyochika employed Western-style geometric perspective, volumetric modeling, and chiaroscuro to a degree that distinguishes his work from the majority of his ukiyo-e predecessors. His compositions display the influence of Hiroshige in how objects in the frame are often cut off at the edges. Kiyochika's woodblock prints stand apart from those of the earlier Edo period, incorporating not only Western styles but also Western subjects, as he depicted the introduction of such things as horse-drawn carriages, clock towers, and railroads to Tokyo. The modern cityscapes typically form a backdrop to human comings-and-goings rather than the focus itself and appear to observe rather than celebrate or deny Meiji industrial modernization and its promotion of fukoku ky≈çhei (\\"enrich the state, strengthen the military\\"); in contrast, Kiyochika's contemporary Yoshitoshi with his samurai battle prints glorified conservative values against the ideals of Westernization. During the Edo period most ukiyo-e artists regularly produced shunga erotic pictures, despite government censorship. In the Meiji period censorship became stricter as the government wanted to present a Japan that met the moral expectations of the West, and production of shunga became scarce. Kiyochika is one of the artists not known to have produced any erotic art.

Richard Lane wrote that Kiyochika could represent \\"either the last important ukiyo-e master, or the first noteworthy print artist of modern Japan\\", but that \\"it is probably most accurate to regard him as an anachronistic survival from an earlier age, a minor hero whose best efforts to adapt ukiyo-e to the new world of Meiji Japan were not quite enough\\". He considered Kiyochika's best works to fall short of Hiroshige's greatest, but to be on par with the best of Kuniyoshi and Kunisada.

Non-indexed units, such as contracts written in nominal currency units and nominal monetary items, incur inflation or deflation risk in the case of monetary items. During all periods of inflation (low, high or hyperinflation), the debtor pays less in real terms than what both the debtor and creditor agreed at the original time of the contract/sale. On the other hand, in periods of deflation, the debtor pays more in real terms than the original agreed value. The opposite is true for creditors. Contracts and constant real value non-monetary items accounted in daily indexed units of account, Daily CPI or monetized daily indexed units of account incur no inflation or deflation risk, as the real value of payments and outstanding capital amounts remain constant over time while the nominal values are inflation- or deflation-indexed daily. Indexation is typically achieved by adjusting payments and outstanding capital as well as interest values using a Daily consumer price index or a monetized daily indexed unit of account. A monetized daily indexed unit of account, called the Unidad de Fomento was introduced in Chile in 1967, but it was only in the early 1980s that it was widely adopted by both the Chilean people and the Chilean government. Its original base value has never been changed. By 1983, over 60 percent of total bank loans in Chile were written in the UF. which eliminated the effect of inflation during inflation. The value of the UF in pesos is published daily in all major Chilean newspapers and on government websites. Initial doubts about the Chilean governments ability to adopt inflation targeting under such an indexed financial system proved unfounded as the Bank of Chile has successfully maintained low inflation rates since 1998. In 1848, John Stuart Mill discussed the inflation risk of non-indexed units of accounts. He stated that \\"All variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous: they disturb existing contracts and expectations, and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious.\\" In 1887 William Stanley Jevons referred to previous authors and discussed an indexed unit of account which he calls a \\"tabular standard of value\\". In 1887 Alfred Marshall, also referring to previous authors, discussed a similar proposal. In 1998 and onwards, Robert Shiller similarly argued for the introduction of an indexed unit of account into the United States economy as a means of eliminating inflation risk.

Competing in three Summer Olympics, she won three medals with one silver (1992: K-4 500 m for Germany) and two bronzes (both Australia, 1996: K-2 500 m, 2000: K-1 500 m). During her career, she has represented four countries: East Germany, then West Germany, then Germany followed by Australia. Borchert was born in 1969 in Waren an der M√ºritz, a town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, East Germany. She won the Junior World Championship in 1987 but was overshadowed by Birgit Fischer. Borchert went to the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, as a reserve for East Germany but did not compete. Her opportunity arose when Fischer went on maternity leave after the Seoul Olympics; she won three gold medals at the 1989 World Championships in Plovdiv. Borchert and her coach, Kersten Neumann, went to West Germany for the 1990 season; this was a year prior to the German reunification. From a base in Essen, she competed at the 1990 World Championships and won one gold medal and three bronze medals. In 1991, she competed for the reunited Germany and won two gold medals and a bronze medal at the World Championships. Fischer made a return for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, and old rivalries became hostile when Borchert lost nomination to Fischer in the K-1 and K-2, and only got nominated for the K-4. Things came to a head when the national coach, Joseph Capousek, did not nominate Borchert for the 1993 World Championships; Capousek was at the time in a relationship with Fischer. Borchert resigned from the national team in 1993 and in February 1994, she emigrated to Australia. Borchert won K-2 500 m and K-2 1000 m events at the 1998 World Championships in Hungary with Anna Wood. They won the K-2 1000 m world champion title in 1999. Borchert would win a total of twenty medals at the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships with nine golds for four different countries (1989 for East Germany, 1990 for West Germany, 1991-93 for Germany, and 1994‚Äì2001 for Australia). At the Sydney Olympics the pairing finished sixth in the K-2 500 m, while she won bronze in the K-1 500 m event. In March 2003, Borchert decided to return to Germany to win nomination for the 2004 German Olympic team. She was prevented from competing for Germany at the 2003 World Championships through the Australian Canoe Federation not granting their permission quickly enough. In 2009 Borchert was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.

It houses the School of Mathematics, the Photon Science Institute and the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (part of the School of Physics and Astronomy). The building is located in the Chorlton-on- Medlock district of Manchester, on Upper Brook Street, and is adjacent to University Place and the Henry Royce Institute. While under construction the project was known as AMPPS : Astronomy, Mathematics, Physics and Photon Science. The building was shortlisted for the Greater Manchester Building of the Year 2008 prize, which is awarded by the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce. The manager of the building project was awarded a silver medal in the Chartered Institute of Building \\"Construction Manager of the Year\\" awards. Architecture The ¬£43m building was completed in July 2007, and was designed by architects Sheppard Robson. It consists of three \\"fingers\\", each of which are four stories high. The building is of steel frame construction, with reinforced concrete stairwells,. Photographs clearly show construction details including concrete stairway towers and steel frames. and grey zinc exterior cladding. The northern two fingers are joined by an atrium, which is spanned by a series of bridges. The southernmost finger was designed to hold low vibration laboratories, and is joined by a glazed bridge at third floor level to the middle finger. An 'over-sailing' roof structure connects the three fingers acting as a suspension system for a photovoltaic array/solar shading using thin film technology. This photovoltaic array is designed to produce nearly 41 megawatt hours per annum, a saving of 17,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. At the time of completion this was the largest photovoltaic array in North West England, and helped the architects to win an award for \\"Business Commitment to the Environment\\". One condition for planning approval was that the project included corridors for pedestrian access and visual transparency between Upper Brook Street and Oxford Road. This was to counter complaints by the residents of Brunswick, on the other side of Upper Brook Street, that previous university developments seemed to be creating a wall to them. The pedestrian walkway between the second and third finger, and the transparent atrium met these demands. This follows the line of an earlier street, when the site was a residential area, and when reopened will run from Upper Brook Street to Oxford Road and is called \\"Wilton Street\\", as it was historically. The atrium looking down from the 3rd floor In the 1960s many mathematics departments were housed in high-rise buildings including the Mathematics Tower at the Victoria University of Manchester, and the Maths and Social Sciences Building at UMIST. These proved completely unsuited to the activities of a mathematics department (and arguably any academic department) as travel between floors in lifts (and uninviting stairways) discourages interaction between mathematicians resulting from chance encounter. Buildings such as the Mathematics Institute at Warwick (at East Site and later the Zeeman Building) and the Isaac Newton Institute at Cambridge are deliberately low-rise and designed to encourage chance encounter. The Alan Turing Building was designed with substantial input from the mathematicians and the design reflects this including a large open plan common room on the atrium bridge, open corridors and walkways and the relocation of the best traditional blackboards from the old buildings.  Occupancy and facilities  The Atrium, during the move of the School of Mathematics The Photon Science Institute occupies the southernmost finger, with the northern two fingers housing Mathematics on the first three floors and the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics on the third and fourth floors. The ground floor atrium constitutes a public space including a small caf√© called Pi in the Sky. Surrounding the atrium on the ground floor are the undergraduate common room for mathematics, as well as lecture rooms and undergraduate computer rooms. The first and second floor of the first two fingers mainly house the offices of academic staff and postgraduate students in mathematics, as well as the Manchester Institute for Mathematical Science (MIMS) conference areas. One of seminar rooms is named after the topologist Frank Adams, and the library after algebraist Brian Hartley. Lecture theatres are named after Mordell, Richardson, Max Newman and Lighthill. A meeting room is named after Horace Lamb and the Access Grid room after Sydney Goldstein. The bridge across the atrium is the common room for mathematics academics and graduate students, where morning coffee is served. The third floor houses the academic offices of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, which provides a new base for the research activities in astronomy and astrophysics with the relocation of many staff and students from Jodrell Bank Observatory. The Observatory now forms part of the JBCA and provides leading observational facilities such as the Lovell Telescope and the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN). This floor differs in design from the others in that the rooms have windows onto the atrium and glass walls to central corridors in each wing whilst retaining glass walled walkways across the atrium. The astrophysics seminar room is named after Sir Bernard Lovell, founder of Jodrell Bank Observatory. The fourth floor contains a number of labs, an RFI screened room and clean room, all for astrophysics instrumentation construction, such as receivers for the Lovell Telescope and the Planck spacecraft. In January 2008 the Project Design Office for the Square Kilometre Array relocated to Manchester to be hosted by the JBCA, co-ordinating the global efforts in constructing the next generation radio telescope. The Photon Science Institute houses laboratories shielded from electromagnetic radiation and resistant to vibration, and features instruments such as a broadband sum frequency spectrometer, and a spectroscopic photon echo measurement kit. A bridge on the third floor connects from Astrophysics to the Photon Science Institute, but retaining that finger's resistance to mechanical vibration.

During the 1850s he formed an early hypothesis of how microbes might relate to disease. Unfortunately, the papers describing his studies were ignored or misplaced in academic bureaucracy.Thesis 1840. Besides medical science, Ehrstr√∂m was also very interested in local history. He researched Finnish folk culture and arranged archaeological expeditions in northern Finland. In 1854, he moved to the coastal town of Raahe to work as a county doctor. At that time, seatrading was becoming the town's most important form of livelihood. Sailors brought interesting souvenirs from abroad and Ehrstr√∂m started thinking of establishing a museum based on those curiosities. In March 1862, Ehrstr√∂m started a campaign to collect donations from the wealthy citizens of Raahe. In a few months he had collected a considerable sum of money and gained wide publicity for his museum project. His achievement, the first local Finnish museum of history, culture and natural sciences, Raahe Museum, started its activities in October, 1862.

Career Recruited from the Alphington Football Club, Chanter signed with Fitzroy in 1946, avoiding being bound to Collingwood under new zoning laws which were soon to be adopted. His father Fred Chanter had played one senior game for Fitzroy, in the round seven match against Essendon, at the Brunswick Street Oval on 12 June 1920. Chanter made his debut for Fitzroy, aged 25, on 25 May 1946, against South Melbourne at the Brunswick Street Oval;League Teams for Tomorrow, The Argus, (Friday, 24 May 1946>), p.17. South Melbourne won the match, 10.12 (72) to 7.21 (63). He played 5 senior games in 1946, and 13 in 1947. When Fred Hughson left Fitzroy at the end of the 1947 season, Chanter took over as fullback. Chanter developed a reputation as a tough and physical player, who was reviled by fans of opposing teams. After a match in August 1949 at Footscray where he was booed throughout the game, a journalist for the Sporting Globe wrote that \\"Chanter is a vigorous player. As I see him, he can be over-vigorous at times, but that does not excuse the behavior of some crowds towards him. There was another demonstration against him at Footscray on Saturday and in the opinion of Frank Walsh it was most unfair and entirely undeserved.\\" Chanter stated later that it was nothing new, saying \\"At Geelong, I was hit with a stone that I saw deliberately thrown at me. At Collingwood, they threw bottles and blue metal at me. And in the much-discussed match at Essendon, after which I had to appear before the Tribunal, spectators spat in my face. I play the game hard and I don't squeal when the game is played hard against me. But surely there is a limit.\\"\\"Crowd Spat in Chanter's Face\\", Sporting Globe (Melbourne), Wednesday 17 August 1949, p. 15 In 1951, he was full-back in the Victorian State team that played against South Australia at the MCG on Saturday, 26 May 1951.Buggy, H., \\"Ruthven Passes Hard Test\\", The Argus, (Friday, 25 May 1951), p.13.

In 1951 he became the first Fitzroy fullback to win the club's Best and Fairest award. In 1952, he was vice-captain; and, on Saturday, 28 June 1952, in round ten of the 1952 season, at a very, very muddy Brunswick Street Oval, in a tough, rugged match where Fitzroy 13.12 (90) beat Essendon 5.8 (38), Chanter played at full back against Essendon champion full-forward, John Coleman.The Brunswick Street Oval was in such poor condition that Fitzroy named a squad of 23 players for the match and would not name the final 20 players until just before the match, on the Saturday afternoon, when the actual condition of the ground and the weather could be far more accurately appraised (Beames, P., \\"Tigers Wait on Weather to Decide Team\\", The Age, Friday, (27 June 1952), p.16.). Coleman, who would finish the season with 103 goals, did not score a goal in the match; and this was the first (and only) time that Coleman was held goal-less in his entire 98 game career. He had less than half a dozen kicks for the entire match, and was only able to score two behinds, one of which was scored in the last scoring kick of the match.Dunn, J., \\"Tough Fitzroy Far Too Good\\", The Argus, (Monday, 30 June 1952), p.9.

In the 19th century it was internally modernised and externally enriched in Venetian Gothic style, with rich window framing, by a series of grand owners. The first neo-Gothic improvements were made after 1840, when the young Archduke Frederick Ferdinand of Austria (1821‚Äì1847) reassembled the property, the Palazzo Cavalli-Gussoni,Margaret Plant, Venice: Fragile City 1797‚Äì1997 (Yale University Press) 2002:111, noting Giandomenico Romanelli, Tra gotico e neogotico: Palazzo Cavalli Franchetti a San Vidal (Venice: Albrizzi) 1990. which had become divided among heirs, and embarked on a complex project intended to give a more prominent Habsburg presence along the Grand Canal, as Austria-Hungary had been awarded the territories of Venice after the Napoleonic Wars.

MolluscaBase. Calyptraeidae Lamarck, 1809. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=141 on 2019-11-04 This family includes the slipper snails (Crepidula species), the Chinese hat snails, (Calyptraea species), and the cup-and-saucer snails (Crucibulum species) among others. The Calyptraeidae are the only family in the superfamily Calyptraeoidea. This family has no subfamilies according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005. Crepidula fornicata was brought to Europe on imported American oysters in the late 19th century and is now considered a significant pest in European oyster beds.  Description  Internally, the shell is distinguished by a shelf-like, cup-like, or half-cup- like structure used for muscle attachment. Some calyptraeids have shells that externally resemble those of limpets, so species in the genus Crepidula are often called slipper limpets. However, these snails are not closely related to true limpets and are more closely related to conches and cowries. The \\"slipper\\" in the name \\"slipper limpet\\" is based on the appearance of the inside of the shell, which with its half-shelf resembles a traditional western bedroom slipper.  Reproduction  Calyptraeids may form a tower of up to 25 animals, sometimes referred to as a mating chain. The bottom snail is always female. When she dies, the male above her will change from male to female, and the chain continues.  Genera  Shells of Crepidula fornicata Genera within the family Calyptraeidae include:Powell A. W. B.

The bombing marked the first aerial attack by an enemy on the continental United States, and was the second time in history that the continental U.S. was bombed by someone working for a foreign power, the first being the bombing of Naco, Arizona by Patrick Murphy despite being an accident. Overview In this battle, a Japanese aircraft carrier strike force under Kakuji Kakuta launched air attacks over two days against the Dutch Harbor Naval Base and Fort MearsNPS Aviation History in Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The attacks inflicted moderate damage on the U.S. base. Shortly thereafter, Japanese naval forces under Boshiro Hosogaya invaded and occupied Attu and Kiska islands in the Aleutians. Background Dutch Harbor was ringed with anti aircraft artillery batteries from the 206th Coast Artillery (Anti Aircraft), Arkansas National Guard, and was one of key targets protected by the Eleventh Air Force based out of mainland Alaska.See Also, NEVER GIVE UP! A HISTORY OF THE 206TH COAST ARTILLERY (ANTI-AIRCRAFT) REGIMENT OF THE ARKANSAS NATIONAL GUARD IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR by William E. Maxwell, Jr. March 1992 The 206th CA (AA) was deployed to Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, in August 1941 and had been on station for approximately four months when the Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7. The 206th CA was equipped with the 3-inch Gun M1918 (an older model with a vertical range of ), .50in (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine guns, and Sperry searchlights. The 206th had one radar in position at Dutch Harbor at the time of the attack. In the harbor were two old destroyers, King and Talbot, destroyer-seaplane tender Gillis, submarine S-27, Coast Guard cutter Onondaga, and U.S. Army transports President Fillmore and Morlen. Battle On June 3, 1942, a Japanese carrier strike force, under the command of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta, comprising the carriers and , plus escort ships, sailed to southwest of Dutch Harbor to launch air strikes at the United States Army and United States Navy facility to support a Japanese offensive in the Aleutians and in the central Pacific at Midway. The Japanese planned to occupy islands in the Aleutians in order to extend their defensive perimeter in the North Pacific to make it more difficult for the U.S. to attack Japan from that area. U.S. Marines observing the battle from trench positions, June 3, 1942 Shortly before dawn at 02:58, given the geographic latitude and longitude, Admiral Kakuta ordered his aircraft carriers to launch their strike which was made up of 12 A6M Zero fighters, 10 B5N Kate high-level bombers, and 12 D3A Val dive bombers which took off from the two small carriers in the freezing weather to strike at Dutch Harbor. One B5N was lost on takeoff from Ryujo. The planes arrived over the harbor at 04:07, and attacked the town's radio station and oil storage tanks causing some damage. Many members of the 206th were awakened on June 3 by the sound of bombs and gunfire. While the unit had been on alert for an attack for many days, there was no specific warning of the attack before the Japanese planes arrived over Dutch Harbor. With no clear direction from headquarters, gun crews from every battery quickly realized the danger, ran to their guns stationed around the harbor and began to return fire. In addition to their guns, guns and machine guns, members of the unit fired their rifles and one even claimed to have hurled a wrench at a low- flying enemy plane. Several members reported being able to clearly see the faces of the Japanese aviators as they made repeated runs over the island.<Goldstein, pp. 151 The highest casualties on the first day occurred when bombs struck barracks 864 and 866 in Fort Mears, killing 17 men of the 37th Infantry and eight from the 151st Engineers.Goldstein, pp. 152 When all the Japanese planes were recovered, there were erroneous reports of enemy ships in the vicinity, but search planes found no ships within the area. During the search, four Nakajima E8N2 \\"Dave\\" two-seat reconnaissance planes‚Äîlaunched from the heavy cruisers and ‚Äîencountered U.S. fighters searching for the departing Japanese squadron. Barracks ship Northwestern engulfed by flames in Dutch Harbor after the second Japanese airstrike, June 4, 1942 The 206th CA spent much of the night of June 3/4 moving guns down off the mountain tops surrounding the harbor down into the city of Unalaska and into harbor facilities themselves. This was partially as a deception and partially to defend against an expected land invasion. Civilian contractors offered to help and were put to work filling sandbags to protect the new gun positions. On June 4, the Japanese carriers steamed to less than south of Dutch Harbor to launch a second attack. At 16:00, a second airstrike of nine fighters, 11 dive bombers, and six level bombers took off and attacked the U.S. facilities at Dutch Harbor again less than an hour later. More targets were damaged including some grounded aircraft, an army barracks, oil storage tanks, aircraft hangar, and a few merchant ships in the port. When the Japanese returned on 4 June, the Zero fighters concentrated on strafing the gun positions while their bombers destroyed the fuel tanks located at the harbor. One wing of the military hospital at the base was destroyed. After hitting the fuel tanks, the enemy dive-bombers and high-level bombers concentrated on the ships in the harbor, Fillmore and Gillis. Driven away from these two targets by intense anti-aircraft fire, they finally succeeded in destroying the station ship which, because of its large size, they mistakenly believed was a warship. Northwestern was actually a transport ship which had been beached and used as a barracks for civilian workers. Although in flames and badly damaged, firefighters managed to save the hull. Its power plant was thereafter used to produce steam and electricity for the shore installations.Garfield, pp. 48‚Äì49Goldstein, pp. 176 An anti-aircraft gun was blown up by a bomb and four U.S. Navy servicemen were killed.Garfield, p. 49 Two Japanese dive bombers and one fighter, damaged by anti-aircraft fire, failed to return to their carriers. On the way back, the Japanese planes encountered an air patrol of six Curtiss P-40 fighters over Otter Point. A short aerial battle ensued which resulted in the loss of one Japanese fighter and two more dive bombers. Two out of the six U.S. fighters were lost as well. Aftermath Front page of the June 3, 1942 Anchorage Daily Times featuring the attack As a result of the enemy actions, the Eleventh Air Force lost four B-17s, two Martin B-26 Marauders, and two P-40s, while the Navy suffered the most with six PBY Catalinas destroyed. 43 Americans were killed: 33 soldiers, eight sailors, a Marine, and a civilian. Another 50 were injured in the attack.Page 63/183 None of the Japanese ships were harmed, but one above- mentioned Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero was damaged by ground fire and crash-landed on Akutan Island, about northeast of Dutch Harbor. Although the pilot was killed, the plane was not seriously damaged. This Zero‚Äîknown as the \\"Akutan Zero\\"‚Äîwas recovered by American forces, inspected, and repaired. The recovery was an important technical intelligence gain for U.S., as it showed the strengths and weaknesses of the Zero's design.O'Leary, Michael. United States Naval Fighters of World War II in Action. Poole, Dorset, UK: Blandford Press, 1980, pp 67‚Äì74. . The following day, Admiral Kakuta received orders to break off further attacks and head for the central Pacific to support the Combined Fleet which was retreating after being defeated at Midway. Two days later, a small Japanese invasion force landed and occupied two of the Aleutian islands, Attu and Kiska, without further incident. The bombing of Dutch Harbor and the subsequent occupations of Kiska and Attu by the Japanese helped trigger an impression among Americans that they were going to launch a full-scale attack along the United States West Coast. As a result, military and commandeered civilian aircraft flew nearly 2,300 troops to Nome, along with artillery and antiaircraft guns and several tons of other equipment and supplies to deter a possible Japanese landing in mainland Alaska. Fearing a Japanese attack on other Aleutian Islands and mainland Alaska, the U.S. government evacuated hundreds more Aleuts from the western chain and the Pribilofs, placing them in internment camps in southeast Alaska, where many died of measles, influenza and other infectious diseases which spread quickly in the overcrowded dormitories. In total, about 75 died in American internment and 19 as a result of Japanese occupation.Ryan Madden, \\"'The Government's Industry': Alaska Natives and Pribilof Sealing during World War II.\\" Pacific Northwest Quarterly 91.4 (2000): 202‚Äì209. in jstorGoldstein, pp. 208‚Äì221 The Aleut Restitution Act of 1988 was an attempt by Congress to compensate the survivors. On June 17, 2017, the U.S. Government formally apologized for the internment of the Unangan people and their treatment in the camps. Aleuts on Kiska and Attu were imprisoned on the Japanese mainland.

It follows Steve Wiebe in his attempts to take the high score record for the 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong from Billy Mitchell. The film premiered at the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival and was released in U.S. theaters in August 2007. It received positive reviews. Summary Walter Day is the founder of Twin Galaxies, an organization dedicated to tracking high scores in arcade games, especially those from the golden age of arcade games of the early 1980s. Restaurateur Billy Mitchell holds the high score for several arcade games, including the original 1981 release of Donkey Kong. In Redmond, Washington, out-of-work engineer Steve Wiebe has purchased a Donkey Kong cabinet in hopes of achieving the world record. Using his mathematical knowledge to identify exploitable patterns in the game, Wiebe sets a new record of 947,200 points in 2003. He sends the tape to Twin Galaxies as evidence and becomes a Seattle celebrity.Redmond man is new king of Donkey Kong. TDN.com. Retrieved 2020-02-01. Wiebe sets a new record with a score of 1,006,600 ‚Äì the first ever score over a million. Mitchell and Twin Galaxies send two referees to investigate Wiebe's machine. They learn that the machine's circuit board was provided by Roy Shildt, a self-proclaimed fitness guru and pickup artist who claims the high score for Missile Command. Unbeknownst to Wiebe, Shildt and Mitchell have been at odds for years after Mitchell questioned Shildt's high score, causing Twin Galaxies to disqualify it. Twin Galaxies suspects that Shildt may have tampered with Wiebe's board, and does not recognize Wiebe's record because it was made on a board which may be questionable due to its association with Shildt. Wiebe travels to a tournament at Funspot in Laconia, New Hampshire, to attempt a live high score for high-ranking Twin Galaxies members. Wiebe challenges Mitchell to a Donkey Kong competition, but Mitchell does not attend. Before a crowd, Wiebe sets a new high score of 985,600 and reaches the kill screen, ending the game. However, contrary to his statements that videotaped scores carry less validity than scores achieved in public (which had also been upheld by Twin Galaxies and was in fact the entire reason Wiebe came on site), Mitchell sends a VHS to Funspot depicting himself achieving a higher score of 1,047,200 points. In an immediate reversal of their new policy on video taped scores, Twin Galaxies proclaims Mitchell the record holder, despite some skepticism about the video's authenticity. Nine months later, Guinness World Records has published Twin Galaxies' records ‚Äî including Mitchell's latest score ‚Äì and hosts a tournament in Mitchell's hometown of Hollywood, Florida. Wiebe again challenges Mitchell to a public competition, but Mitchell refuses. Wiebe fails to surpass the record, but Day acknowledges Wiebe's integrity and invites him to submit taped scores. At home, Wiebe achieves a new record of 1,049,100.

Kotaku. The validity of Mitchell's August 7, 2010, high score, set at Boomers-Grand Prix Arcade, could not be determined.

Mitchell was stripped of his records and banned from submitting further scores, and Wiebe was recognized as the first person to score over a million points. Due to this Mitchell's scores were also removed from the Guinness World Record book. The investigative committee cited footage obtained from the King of Kong DVD special features as instrumental in exposing Mitchell.Crecente, Brian (April 12, 2018). \\"Famed Donkey Kong Player Stripped of Title\\".

In 2003 Father Comper was declared a 'Hero of the Faith' by the Scottish Episcopal Church ‚Äì the equivalent of a saint and the greatest honour the Church can bestow.The Scotsman \\"Episcopalian cleric honoured\\" Tuesday 8 April 2003 In the Calendar of the Scottish Episcopal Church he is remembered on 27 July, the day of his death. Origins John Comper was born in Nutbourne, Pulborough in Sussex, on 1 October 1823, where his father farmed a smallholding. John was the youngest of a family of seven. The family name \\"Comper\\" is a French surname possibly from Brittany; the Comper forebears being probably sixteenth century Huguenot refugees though this is disputed by Anthony SymondsonSir Ninian Comper who argues the family is more likely of Norman origin. From his earliest years he was very interested in matters spiritual, and fascinated by the liturgy, which he studied throughout his life. At the age of 24 he completed training as a student teacher at a college in Chichester. He was aware that without a university degree he would not be accepted for the priesthood in England, and therefore he turned his attention to Scotland, where the Scottish Episcopal Church was in need of clergy. Career Already an adherent to the principles of the Oxford Movement, he began ecclesiastical life as a lay reader at a church school in Kirriemuir. He moved from Kirriemuir to Crieff to take part in the educational work at St Margaret's College which had been started by the Revd Alexander Lendrum, embarking on a special course of study in preparation for Holy Orders. St Ninian's Cathedral, PerthSt. Ninian's Cathedral was consecrated on Tuesday 10 December 1850, and the following day, Comper was ordained deacon in the Cathedral by Bishop Alexander Penrose Forbes on behalf of the aged Diocesan Patrick Torry,The Life and Times of Patrick Torry, D.D., by John Mason Neale then in his 43rd year of his prelacy. The preacher at that service was the Rev. J. M. Neale, the hymn-writer, with whom the young Comper kept up a warm friendship. He was ordained priest at Crieff prior to his appointment at Nairn. In Nairn he was to take charge of a new Mission raised to mitigate the effects of a schism that had arisen within the newly formed congregation of St Ninian's ChurchSt Ninian's Church built in 1845. This congregation in refusing to accept the authority of the bishop became an \\"English\\" episcopal chapel. Comper also opened a school in Nairn and his success soon drew the attention of the Episcopal authorities. Bishop Robert Eden, newly consecrated in Edinburgh on 9 March 1851, recruited Comper to take services in an upper room in Nairn, before appointing him as Diocesan Mission Priest for the Moray Diocese and as Bishop's Chaplain. Whilst based in Inverness Comper opened another day school and a chapel, now represented by St Andrew's Cathedral.The Cathedral Church of St Andrew, Aberdeen Comper was also put in charge of the newly created Mission at Cromarty before returning to the Brechin Diocese to fill the vacancy at Stonehaven in 1857. He took charge of the ancient congregation that originally met at the Stonehaven Tolbooth, but had removed long since the Jacobite rising of 1745 and Duke of Cumberland's occupation of the chapel as a stable for his horses, to the Stonehaven High Street site. This meeting house was demolished on Cumberland's orders in 1746. Services were then held clandestinely for some years in a house in the High Street. Later a \\"Qualified Chapel\\" was built in Cameron Street, the two congregations as yet existing as separate entities. The Qualified Congregation joined the Scottish Episcopal Church in 1803, but it took a further twelve years for them to amalgamate in a union whereupon they moved back into the old Qualified Chapel, this time as a full-fledged congregation of the Episcopal Church. It was in this building that Comper ministered from 1857 to 1861. In Aberdeen, the Patrons of St John's Episcopal Church, Dr George Grub and Dr George Ogilvie beseeched Comper to come to the parish. The Rev. Frederick G. Lee had absconded from St John's and his predecessor Patrick Cheyne,St. John's Episcopal Church, Aberdeen had been prosecuted by Bishop Thomas Suther for his Tractarian \\"Six Sermons\\". In Comper's own diocese, Bishop Alexander Forbes was then under prosecution from the Episcopal College of Bishops. Comper only left the Brechin Diocese when his Diocesan was out of trouble, and did not make further waves by leaving his charge vacant. Suther began a tirade against Comper. His biographer, \\"LTA\\", gives a risible account of the situation thus: \\"Comper's first act was to initiate the partial use of the Scottish Communion Office ‚Äî the date being shortly before the General Synod of 1863, and an appeal against Bishop Suther's attempted objections was successful. Here and in another question of ceremonial Dr Grub's unrivalled historical knowledge and genuine Churchmanship were of greatest value\\". Grub's genial humour came out in the account he gave of the Bishop who bade his presbyter, like a naughty boy, \\"take off his vestments and put out his lights.\\" In the end the lights were saved, but the vestments surrendered. Two significant events took place during the first years of Comper's incumbency at St John's. Firstly, a day school was built and dedicated to Revd Patrick Cheyne's forty years association with St John's. Secondly, in the year 1863 the first sister arrived from the Society of Saint Margaret,Society of St Margaret (East Grinstead) the foundress of St Margaret's Convent, 17 Spital, Aberdeen (closed in 2003). The Gallowgate mission Comper was more interested in the welfare of the poor and resigned the charge at St John's in 1870 to spend more time in the mission he had founded in the Gallowgate slums of Aberdeen in 1867. Wright describes the scene as follows; \\"The whole area enjoyed an evil reputation. No one ventured out after dark. It was bad enough making your way to church through wet washings, but you also had to hold your nose to prevent smelling the fish barrows parked along one side of the Gallowgate. Often rats were scavenging in the barrows.\\" From this mission, St Margaret's, Gallowgate, emanated the subsequent mission at St Clement's-on-the-Quay, which eventually became an independent congregation erecting a church on the quayside with money bequeathed by Sir George Reid's widow, Margaret Best, one of Comper's ardent admirers. He became the chief motivator in the organisation, eventually raising the Episcopal charge in 1870 dedicated to St Margaret of Scotland.St Margaret's Episcopal Church, Gallowgate, Aberdeen Comper was the first clergyman in Aberdeen to organise a congregation social meeting, which he called a \\"Refection\\". His other memorable project, apart from St Margaret's and its Convent, was his work for foreign aid which banded together many of the Church's Women's Organisations in common cause. A kenspeckle figure in Aberdeen city and a veteran clergyman of the Aberdeen Diocese, he enjoyed meritorious respect from all classes of the population. Death The Revd John Comper died suddenly in the Duthie ParkDuthie Park Aberdeen on Monday 27 July 1903, where he had gone with his wife. Coincidentally, it was the first visit he had made to the park as he had been tempted to enjoy the fine weather Aberdeen was experiencing at that time. The Press & Journal wrote, \\"He sat in the park and expressed his admiration for all that he saw, saying how surprised he was that the vicinity of Aberdeen contained a place of such varied beauty. He then went to the refreshment room to get some strawberries for his wife and on his return to the bench where she was seated he was observed to stagger and fall. In a short time he was found to be dead. During the morning we understand he had been in his usual health but complained of drowsiness; otherwise his condition had excited no remark. He was never very strong in health, but was able by an annual tour on the Continent to maintain himself in comparative vigour.\\" Family Anthony Symondson tells that thereafter his eldest son, Ninian Comper, signed all his painted glass windows with a wild strawberry, the leaves and stems entwining the date of execution. The first window to be so signed was his father's own memorial in St Margaret of Scotland, Aberdeen in 1908. John Comper married Ellen Taylor of Hull in 1853; they had five children. Mrs Ellen Comper died on 10 June 1908. Ninian Comper, born in 1864, was to become one of the greatest church architects of the twentieth century, being knighted in 1950 at the age of 84. Ninian's son, Nicholas Comper, became an aeronautical engineer who designed the Comper Swift.

N. Patil, in relation to it.  Murder  G. N. Patil was nominated by the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee to be president of the District Congress Committee of Jalgaon in 2004. In 2005, an election by secret ballot was held for the position. He contested the election but lost to his opponent, V. G. Patil, by 13 votes. V. G. Patil was a professor of English in a Jalgaon college that was affiliated to the North Maharashtra University. After his election, he instituted an enquiry into misappropriation of funds collected for felicitation of Pratibha Patil and for tsunami relief. On 21 September 2005, he was murdered near his house in broad daylight. The local police arrested two alleged assailants, Raju Mali and Raju Sonawane, but were then instructed by officials in Mumbai to transfer the case to the CID. In a letter to the police, Patil's widow, Rajani Patil, accused Ulhas Patil, a former Indian National Congress Member of Parliament from Jalagaon, and G. N. Patil as conspirators.  High court order and CBI inquiry  In February 2007 the Aurangabad bench of Mumbai High Court acted on a petition from Rajani Patil, directing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take over the probe from the CID. The judge stated in his ruling that: A CBI team visited Jalgaon on 4 April 2007. Three days later, Raju Mali died in mysterious circumstances while in police custody. On June 23, 2007 the district and sessions court of Jalgaon allowed the CBI to file the supplementary charge-sheet in the murder case against G. N. Patil.  Murder case in media  The Hindi news channel AAJ TAK in October 2006 telecast a 20-minute investigative report on this murder case in its weekly programme ‚ÄòHatyaara Kaun?‚Äô (who is murderer). The report claimed that both G. N. Patil and Ulhas Patil had made numerous calls from their mobiles, before as well as on the day of murder, and that in September 2006, the two alleged assailants ‚Äî Mali and Sonawane ‚Äî went on an indefinite fast inside the Jalgaon district jail. Mali said, ‚ÄúWe have been simply made scape goats in the case, whereas the real culprits are untouched.‚Äù  Allegation of shielding by Pratibha Patil  On June 22, 2007, Rajni Patil claimed in a NDA-facilitated press conference that her husband was murdered by Pratibha Patil's brother, G. N. Patil. She accused Pratibha Patil of shielding her brother. She further said that she had written to INC leader Sonia Gandhi and the President of India, Abdul Kalam, giving details of her allegation. Copies of her memorandum to Kalam were distributed to the press by Sudheendra Kulkarni, an aide to the BJP leader, L. K.

She argued that if matters were left until after the election then Pratibha Patil might benefit from presidential immunity.The Hindustan Times The lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani said that two CDs have surfaced which contain incriminating material against G. N. Patil. The CDs allegedly contain footage of the elections for the district Congress presidency in Jalgaon. Jethmalani offered to place both CDs on record, saying \\"These contain vital information showing the political link behind the murder.\\" = Timeline and detailed quotes about allegation = On June 22, 2007, a press conference was organised at the residence of Sukhbir Singh Dhindsa, a leader of the Akali Dal which is member of the BJP-led NDA coalition.We don‚Äôt know about Rajni Patil, says NDA The Hindu - June 23, 2007 BJP spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad later told reporters: The same day, the UPA refuted the allegations.

During his playing career he served AFC Ajax, Willem II Tilburg, AZ, SC Heerenveen, FC La Chaux-de-Fonds, Cambuur Leeuwarden and TOP Oss. He is the brother of former professional footballer Jerry Haatrecht. Both Jerry and Winnie Haatrecht were known as talented youth players and were always playing at the Balboa Square in Amsterdam with their buddies Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard. All four they joined the youth squads of AFC Ajax and became part of a high quality group of players, where also players like Wim Kieft, Marco van Basten, Gerald Vanenburg, Sonny Silooy and John Bosman were their team mates. Jerry and Winnie were not able to get a professional contract at Ajax and both left the club for a club in other regions of the Netherlands. Winnie signed for Willem II Tilburg, while Jerry moved to Cambuur Leeuwarden. Where Jerry's adventure was no success, as his mentality and his discipline were not strong enough to eventually break through in professional football, Winnie made his professional debut at Willem II, but in his second match he injured his meniscus, which took him nine weeks to at least be able to walk again. After he recovered he would no longer be the highly talented player he was, but became a decent professional player instead. Willem II played a great first half of the season in which they won almost all matches. However, in the second half things went worse and their coach asked his players what was going on. When Haatrecht was one of the few to actually answer the question he was not supported by his team mates nor the coach and he did no longer feel happy at Willem II. He had a few friends playing at AZ and asked if it was possible to join that club to play alongside his buddy Sigi Lens. He was already able to join AZ in the winter break of that season and AZ would pay Willem II the same amount of money as they paid Ajax for purchasing Haatrecht during the summer break. However Haatrecht's performances at AZ were great and Willem II demanded more money. AZ paid him with an all-in salary and when the transfer fund was raised Haatrecht would earn less money and he told both clubs that he would quit football if Willem II would not cooperate. Haatrecht would not play professional football for two seasons and joined amateur side VV Neerlandia '31 where is nephew and brother were also playing. In 1988, he returned to professional football as he was awarded to sign a contract at SC Heerenveen. In 1989 Winnie was invited by Sonny Hasnoe, the founder of the Colourful 11 to be part of the team and travel to Suriname to play in the \\"Boxel Kleurrijk Tournament\\" with three Surinamese teams. However Winnie withdrew from the squad close to the deadline as he had to play with his team in the play-offs. As a result, brother Jerry was asked to join the team instead of Winnie, which he immediately accepted. During the flight Jerry switched seats with Edu Nandlal. The Surinam Airways Flight PY764 crashed during approach to Paramaribo-Zanderij International Airport, killing 176 of the 187 on board, including Haatrecht, making it the worst ever aviation disaster in Suriname's history. Among the dead were a total of 15 members of the Colourful 11, only three of them survived. Nandlal was one of the survivors and was rescued first when Haatrecht was still alive, but died shortly after. One of the other survivors was his friend Sigi Lens. Winnie Haatrecht was totally shocked by the disaster and his brother's death. However three days after the accident he played with SC Heerenveen in the play-offs and a minute of silence was held. All eyes were on Haatrecht and his emotions were easily seen. The health of their mother who was fighting against cancer became worse after the disaster and she died in 1991. He felt guilty and he decided it was better to move from all the media attention and signed a contract with FC La Chaux-de-Fonds in the Swiss second division. The spell in Switzerland was no success as the team got into financial trouble with Haatrecht being one of the most expensive players in the squad and he had to leave and moved to Cambuur Leeuwarden. In his final years of his career he played for TOP Oss. Coach Hans Dorjee wanted him seriously and even let him help him selecting other players for the team. Gus Uhlenbeek, Paul Nortan and Stanley MacDonald were signed on advice of Haatrecht and TOP Oss played a great season. After his career more and more players asked him to help them with their negotiations and after a while he started asking some money for his efforts. When he was 20 years old he had the dream to start a player's agency together with his friends and later fellow professional footballers Nortan, Lens, Jerry de Jong and Ulrich Wilson. That dream never became reality, although Lens and Haatrecht both did become a player's agent. Among Haatrecht's players are currently Ryan Babel, Gianni Zuiverloon and Afonso Alves.

Chao was respected for solving several notorious crimes in Singapore, and raised Singapore's level of professionalism in the area of forensics. Biography =Early life and education= Chao Tzee Cheng was the son of a professor in cultural studies and a school principal. Of Cantonese origin, he later migrated to Singapore with his parents and received his education at Catholic High School and Victoria Continuation School. Although offered a scholarship to read engineering in the United States, he decided to take up medicine at University of Hong Kong. After graduating with an MBBS in Hong Kong in 1961, Chao returned to Singapore to serve as a medical officer. Chao also took a Diploma in Clinical Pathology in 1967, followed by a Diploma of Pathology in 1968 and a Diploma of Medical Jurisprudence in 1968. However, a car accident in West Malaysia left him with a weakened right arm and dashed his hopes of a career in surgery. Unfazed, Professor Chao turned to a career in pathology. By 1968, Chao qualified as a pathologist, obtaining his specialised skills from the Royal London Hospital, Medical College, currently under the Queen Mary, University of London. Chao married Joyce Wong Yoke Choy in 1963. They had a son Dr Alexandre Chao, who succumbed to SARS in 2003. =Career= Upon his return to Singapore, Chao was appointed the forensic pathologist at the Department of Pathology in the Ministry of Health. Almost immediately, Chao was involved in his first case as a pathologist. He was invited to be an expert witness in the murder case of Koh Liang Chuen in 1969. The notoriety of this case raised Chao's standing as a forensic expert in the region. His forensic expertise and duties extended beyond Singapore to countries like Malaysia, Hong Kong and even certain states of West Africa. In his career, Chao performed over 25,000 autopsies and was the authoritative expert witness in many unsolved murder cases worldwide. His forensic capability was demonstrated in the investigation of mass disasters such as the Spyros blast, the Singapore Cable Car tragedy, the Hotel New World disaster and the SilkAir Flight 185 tragedy. He also helped solve notorious crimes in the annals of Singapore criminal law, such as the Adrian Lim cult murders, the Scripps Body Parts murders, the Bulgarian murder and the Flor Contemplacion case. He was nicknamed the \\"Justice of Murder\\" by his associates for his uncanny ability to solve murder cases. Despite the political sensitivities of several of his cases, Professor Chao remained objective and presented the facts as he knew them. He was also known to stand for justice, no matter which side of the fence it stood on. For example, in 1975, he testified as an expert witness for the defence at the Kuala Lumpur High Court trial of Hugh Ashley Johnston for the murder of his wife. In the end, a six-to-one jury verdict held that Johnston had no intention to kill his wife. Chao served in various capacities, including the Master of the Singapore Academy of Medicine (1992‚Äì1995), and President of the Singapore Society of Pathology (1987‚Äì1990). He also founded the Medico-Legal Society, and served as its President from 1985 until his death in 2000. In 1999, Chao co-authored a book with Audrey Perera entitled Murder Is My Business, which documented some of his better-known cases. =Death= Chao died in his sleep on a visit to his sister in New York on 21 February 2000. At the time of his death, Chao was holding posts in the Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine, Ministry of Health, National University of Singapore and Singapore General Hospital in Singapore. In memory of him, the National University of Singapore has set up the Chao Tzee Cheng Professorship in Pathology and Forensic Science. Honours For his services to Singapore, Chao was awarded the Public Administration Silver Medal in 1975, Gold Medal in 1979 and the Meritorious Medal in 1995.

According to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) the family Xenophoridae has no subfamilies. Distribution The Xenophorids live on sand and mud bottoms of the continental shelves and the continental slopes of the subtropical and tropical seas and range from very shallow water to depths of more than 1,400 meters.Kreipl, K. & Alf, A. (1999): Recent Xenophoridae. 148 pp. incl. 28 color plts. ConchBooks, Hackenheim, . Shell description Xenophorids are unusual in that in many of the species the animal cements small stones or shells to the edge of the shell as it grows, thus the shells of those species are sometimes humorously referred to as \\"shell-collecting shells\\". The genus name Xenophora comes from two ancient Greek words and means \\"bearing (or carrying) foreigners\\". The shells are small to rather large (diameter of base without attachments 19‚Äì160 mm; height of shell 21‚Äì100 mm), depressed to conical, with narrow to wide, simple to spinose peripheral edge or flange separating spire from base. Aperture large, base broad, rather flattened, often umbilicate. Periostracum very thin or wanting. Protoconch depressed-conical, multispiral (in one species paucispiral). Teleoconch usually with foreign objects attached in spiral series to peripheral flange and, sometimes, remainder of dorsum, at least on early whorls. Operculum horny, yellowish to brown, nucleus lateral, with simple growth lamellae, sometimes with conspicuous radial striae or hollow radial ribs.

The latter initially conquered Zhabdrung's seat, Simtokha Dzong, threatening to eliminate his young dominion. The castle's ammunition stores were accidentally ignited during the battle, however, resulting in an explosion that destroyed Simtokha Dzong and much of the Tibetan army. Seizing this chance, Zhabdrung's followers rallied and ousted the Tibetans from their territory, turning the battle into a decisive strategic victory of Ngawang Namgyal, paving the way for the Unification of Bhutan under his rule.  Prelude  Zhabdrung Rinpoche Ngawang Namgyal, military leader and founder of Bhutan. As result of a theological and political dispute in Tibet over the reincarnation of the Drukpa Lineage-holder in the early 17th century, there were two men who claimed to be the rightful 18th abbot of Ralung Monastery: Ngawang Namgyal and Gyalwang Pagsam Wangpo. Both were backed by different groups within the Drukpa sect, but the latter also enjoyed the support of the Tsangpa dynasty that dominated central Tibet at the time. The conflict eventually escalated, and Ngawang Namgyal, whose \\"high level of intelligence, charisma and ambition were perceived as significant threats to the establishment\\", chose to go into voluntary exile in 1616/17. Invited by the lama of Gasa, he and his retinue settled down in the region that would later become western Bhutan. This area was at the time divided among several different chiefdoms, petty kingdoms and Buddhist sects that constantly fought for supremacy. Ngawang Namgyal was well received by the local Drukpa Kagyu clergy and began to garner support among the local populace while continuing to openly defy his rivals in Tibet, including the Tsangpa dynasty. As his fame and popularity grew, \\"he acquired the sobriquet ‚ÄòZhabdrung Rinpoche‚Äô, literally ‚Äòthe precious jewel at whose feet one submits‚Äô.\\" His growing influence angered not only his Tibetan enemies, but also several powerful rival Buddhist schools of western Bhutan such as the Lhapa sect. Eventually, the Tsangpa invaded Bhutan in collaboration with the Lhapa hierarchs in order to eliminate Ngawang Namgyal in 1619. This first invasion was eventually defeated by the Bhutanese chieftains who had rallied to Zhabdrung's support, but the conflict between him and the Tsangpa continued, especially since a smallpox epidemic that killed King Karma Phuntsok Namgyal and many other members of the Tibetan dynasty was attributed to Ngawang Namgyal's alleged magical powers. After a time of self-chosen seclusion, Zhabdrung proclaimed his intention to become the spiritual and temporal ruler of Bhutan. While the Drukpa Kagyu, Sakya, and Nyingma schools as well as many chieftains accepted his political domination, several other lamas did not and continued to resist him. As he consolidated his control over the western valleys, Zhabdrung began to construct a strategically placed dzong as his seat of power in 1629. It was during the construction that five lamaist factions attacked his party and his supporters. The following First Battle of Simtokha Dzong resulted in a decisive victory of Ngawang Namgyal's forces, while the dzong was finished in 1631. As their own efforts to remove Zhabdrung failed, the lamas appealed for the new Tsangpa ruler, Karma Tenkyong, to launch another invasion of Bhutan to overthrow their rival. For some years, however, negotiations between the Tibetans and Ngawang Namgyal's followers took place to avoid war. These proved unfruitful, and as result the Tsangpa launched their second invasion in 1634. This led the Bhutanese to claim that the Tibetan ruler had never wanted peace and that the negotiations had been a mere stragetic ploy. King Karma Tenkyong's exact motives for the invasion remain unclear, however, with Karma Phuntsho speculating that he either wanted to capture Zhabdrung, destabilize his rule in Bhutan, or obtain revered Tibetan relics that were in Bhutanese possession. In any case, the new invasion appears to have been much larger and better prepared than the one of 1619.  The campaign  A Tibetan soldier using a matchlock. Gunpowder weapons were used on both sides of the conflict, although swords, spears and bows remained much more common. Supported by the Bhutanese lamaist militias, King Karma Tenkyong sent five Tibetan divisions down into Bhutan: Four of these led an assault via the Paro and Gasa valleys, targeting Simtokha Dzong, while the fifth occupied the Bumthang valley, although that valley was home to the neutral Kingdom of Bumthang. Why the Tsangpa dynasty also occupied Bumthang is unknown, but John A. Ardussi speculates that either Ngawang Namgyal had a large following there or that the Tibetans at least believed it to be so. Once again, Zhabdrung's supporters rallied to his defense, but it became quickly apparent that the Tibetan-Lamaist coalition was far stronger. Deputing his political and military duties to his confidant Tenzin Drukgyal, Ngawang Namgyal retreated to Jarogang in Khothangkha, resolved to escape to India if his domain would be destroyed. As the situation for Zhabdrung's forces became increasingly dire, Tibetan troops attacked Simtokha Dzong. Equipped with large numbers of matchlocks as well as Chinese trebuchets, Karma Tenkyong's troops quickly stormed the palace. The Tibetans went on to demand hostages from Ngawang Namgyal, who only gave a defiant reply. While Tibetan soldiers were looting the dzong, however, its gunpowder stores were ignited, perhaps by accident. Simtokha Dzong, constructed just three years prior, exploded, killing most of the Tibetan forces present. As the Tibetans had been unaware of the ammunition, with the explosion seemingly coming out of nowhere, panic quickly spread among the survivors. Recognizing the chance, Zhabdrung's forces managed to overwhelm the remaining Tibetans in a counterattack. Bhutanese sources even claim that \\"the few [invaders] who survived, returned to Tibet with the news of a terrible defeat.\\" Ardussi argues, however, that \\"it [is not] certain that the dispersal of the Tibetan and allied Bhutanese armies was complete\\" and that sporadic fighting in western Bhutan probably continued until 1639. After their victory at Simtokha Dzong, Ngawang Namgyal and his followers also expelled the Barawa monks from their strongholds in the Gasa valley, eliminating one rival sect from Bhutan for good.  Aftermath  Even though his forces had triumphed over the Tibetan invaders and he remained in power, Ngawang Namgyal's victory was a costly one. His regime had almost collapsed and his new seat of power was destroyed, while both the Tsangpa dynasty and the rival lamas remained a constant threat to his realm. Nevertheless, Ngawang Namgyal resumed \\"with undiminished determination to carry on his task of state-building\\". After praying for the fallen soldiers at Chagri Monastery, he immediately began to seek a place to construct an even grander dzong than Simtokha. After he found one, the foundation for the new Punakha Dzong was laid in 1637; after its completion it remained the administrative centre and the seat of the Government of Bhutan until 1955, when the capital was moved to Thimphu. Simtokha Dzong, on the other hand, was only rebuilt in 1671. While Ngawang Namgyal continued to unify Bhutan, the Tibetans and their dissident Bhutanese allies launched one last invasion in 1639, but this war quickly turned into a stalemate. Meanwhile, the Tsangpa were increasingly confronted with conflicts in Tibet, so that Karma Tenkyong eventually initiated negotiations in order to end the conflict. Zhabdrung Rinpoche Ngawang Namgyal was recognized by the Tibetans as ruler of western Bhutan, and in the years until his death he would eliminate the sects that opposed him and also conquer much of eastern Bhutan.

He was also one of the first artists in Singapore to use Chinese ink painting techniques to render scenery and figurative paintings of local and Southeast Asian themes. Born in Swatow, Chen attended school at the Union High School in Swatow, China and graduated in 1929. He attended and graduated from Xinhua Academy of Fine Arts in 1931, and arrived in Singapore that same year. He taught art at various secondary schools, before becoming a lecturer of the Chinese ink painting department at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. He advocated tradition in his Chinese ink painting style. Chen's training in Xinhua firmly grounded him in traditional principles of Chinese painting. This also includes his inclination towards the ancient Chinese tradition of painting as \\"idea writing\\", using inscriptions to fortify the meanings of the paintings. At the same time he was convinced that the traditions of Chinese painting were ripe for reform and revision at that time, as art in Shanghai and China then saw the emergence of his peers experimenting Modernism with conventional principles in Chinese ink painting. He strongly believed that communicating art to the viewers is top priority in creating art, against the classic Modernist tenet that the innate subjectivism, sensibilities and concerns of the individual artist should always prevail over viewer accessibility. In 1935 he co-founded the Salon Art Society (Singapore Society of Chinese Artists) and taught art in various schools in Singapore between 1936 and 1970. He also served on various advisory and management committees of art societies in Singapore. In 1969, he co- founded the Singapore Watercolour Society with artists like Lim Cheng Hoe, and Loy Chye Chuan, and served as the Society treasurer for many years. Chen died in 1986. In 1952 Chen and fellow artists Cheong Soo Pieng, Chen Wen Hsi and Liu Kang, were persuaded by Lim Hak Tai to visit Bali to seek inspiration for their art. This gave to Pictures of Bali painting exhibition in the same year, which was organized by the four artists and showcasing the paintings they did during their stay on the Indonesian island. It also led to the development of what is known today as the Nanyang School of Painting. Legacy On 15 January 1994 151 works of art by Chen, mainly Chinese ink paintings were donated by the Chen family estate, to the Chen Chong Swee Charity auction conducted by Singapore Sotheby's Auction House at the Empress Place Building. The charity drive aimed to raise S$1 million for a scholarship fund that benefits local visual artists. By the end of the auction a total of S$676,200 was made from the sale of 138 paintings during the auction, with more than 70 per cent of the collection sold above the minimum reserve price. The highest priced pieces Returning From The Sea and Trengganu Beach were sold for S$66,000 and S$16,000, respectively to two anonymous buyers. The money raised became the NAC-Chen Chong Swee Art Scholarship, in memory of this great artist and educator. This Scholarship awards aspiring artists with up to S$25,000 funding to pursue full-time postgraduate studies or research programmes overseas. In March 1994, the Singapore Mint produced gold and silver ingots commemorating the late artist. The gold and silver ingots weigh 75g and 43g respectively, were printed with the artist's Drying Fish painting on one side, and the other with the portrait of the artist with his personalised signature and seal. These ingots were launched officially at the Reminiscence of Singapore Pioneer Art Masters art exhibition at the Takashimaya Art Gallery on 11 March 1994.

The TARA is a computer-based technique. It requires respondents to classify a succession of mixed statements as true or false, as quickly and accurately as they can, by pressing one of two keys. The faster they do so, the more likely they are to be telling the truth; the slower they do so, the more likely they are to be lying. The TARA works by manufacturing an artificial situation in which lying is more challenging than truth-telling. Specifically, it permits truth-tellers to complete two alternating tasks using the same strategy, but requires liars to complete them using contradictory strategies. Hence, if both truth-tellers and liars complete the TARA accurately as stipulated, then the former will complete it more quickly than the latter, all else being equal. Structurally, the TARA bears some affinities with the implicit association test, or IAT, because it generates differences in average reaction time on the basis of differences in response compatibility. The TARA remains to be field-tested. However, initial laboratory studies obtained accuracy rates in the region of 85%, suggesting that the technique holds promise.

Michael Basinshaw, was a parish church in Basinghall Street in the City of London,\\"Notes on Old London Churches\\" Pearce, C.W: London, Winthrop & Co, 1909 on land now occupied by the Barbican Centre complex. Recorded since the 12th century, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666, then rebuilt by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. The rebuilt church was demolished in 1900. History St Michael Bassishaw was one of seven churches in the City of London dedicated to the Archangel Michael. \\"Bassishaw\\" comes from Basing‚Äôs haw, Basing being the name of a prominent family in medieval London and ‚Äòhaw‚Äô meaning yard. From the fifteenth century the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral were patrons of the church. Medieval church The earliest surviving reference to the church is in a deed of 1196, as ‚ÄúSt Michael de Bassishaghe‚Äù. A 14th-century parish priest of St Michael‚Äôs, by the name of William, dug a ditch outside the church to assert his right of way. He was obliged by civic authorities to fill it in again. Excavations in the late 19th century and again, in 1965, showed that the north wall of the 12th-century church had been built over Roman and medieval rubbish pits, so had to be strengthened by buttresses. The church was rebuilt in the 15th century. John Burton, a mercer who died in 1460 and was buried in the choir, and his wife Agnes were major contributors to the cost \\"as appeared by his mark placed throughout the whole roof of the Choir, and the middle Isle of the Church\\" A chapel was built on the north side of the choir by Sir James Yerford (or Yarford), Lord Mayor in 1520. He was buried there in 1527. The building restored in 1630, but all was lost in the Great Fire of 1666. In 1662, Francis Hall - a chaplain to Charles II - was appointed Rector. He fled the parish upon the outbreak of the Great Plague of London in 1665, and returned only in 1670 to collect his stipend. His substitute, a priest called Williams, succumbed to the plague in September 1665, along with this wife and three children. Rebuilding Rebuilding began in 1675 and completed four years later. The work was unsatisfactory. The contractor, John Fitch, encountered problems with the foundations on the east end, so removed them and piled the ground. The walls were faced with brick, instead of the usual stone, and the load-bearing Corinthian columns were described as \\"specimens of‚Ä¶jerry-building‚Ä¶made up of several sorts of materials and plastered over.\\" By 1693, the parish was lobbying Wren to provide resources for repairs. By the turn of the century, the church was being shored up and in need of repair. This was undertaken in 1713, when the upper parts of the walls were taken down and rebuilt, the slate roof replaced with a lead roof and a steeple added. The total cost of rebuilding was ¬£5,704. The tower, also of brick, was to the west of the church. The steeple, probably designed by Robert Hooke, took the form of an octagonal drum surmounted by a lantern, from which emerged a trumpet shaped cone. On top of this was a ball and finial, now perched on the spire of St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe. George Godwin described St Michael's as \\" a plain substantial building without any striking features\\". It was 70 feet long and 50 feet wide, divided into nave and aisles by Corinthian columns supporting an elaborate entablature and a coved ceiling. The plan was irregular, being smaller than the pre-Fire church.Vanished churches of the City of London, Huelin, G: London, Guildhall Library Publications, 1996 The main front was on the east, facing Basinghall Street and was unadorned, except for a large round headed window flanked by two round windows.

Aimed at promoting peace between Middle Eastern countries, Jordan was chosen as the location for the laboratory, as it was then the only country that maintained diplomatic relations with all the other founding members; Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority, and Turkey. The project was launched in 1999 and the ground breaking ceremony was held on 6 January 2003. Construction work began the following July, with a scheduled completion date of 2015. However financial and technical infrastructural obstacles forced the project to be delayed. The laboratory was inaugurated on 16 May 2017 under the patronage and presence of King Abdullah II. The project cost around $90 million, with $5 million donated each by Jordan, Israel, Turkey, Iran and the European Union. The rest was donated by CERN from existing equipment. Jordan became the greatest contributor to the project by donating land and building construction costs, and by pledging to build a $7 million solar power plant, which will make SESAME the first accelerator in the world to be powered by renewable energy. The annual operational cost of $6 million are pledged by the members according to the size of their economies. The facility is the only synchrotron radiation facility in the Middle East and is one of around 60 in the world. , the president of the SESAME Council is Rolf Heuer. He was preceded by Christopher Llewellyn Smith (2008-2017) and Herwig Schopper (2004-2008). All three were previously directors-general of CERN. Khaled Toukan, the chairman of the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission, is the current director and former vice-president of SESAME. Background Synchrotron light (also referred to as synchrotron radiation) is radiation that is emitted when charged particles moving at speeds near the speed of light are forced to change direction by a magnetic field. It is the brightest artificial source of X-rays, allowing for the detailed study of molecular structures. When synchrotrons were first developed, their primary purpose was to accelerate particles for the study of the nucleus. Today, there are almost 60 synchrotron light sources around the world dedicated to exploiting the special qualities, which allow it to be used across a wide range of applications, from condensed matter physics to structural biology, environmental science and cultural heritage. Mohammad Abdus Salam  History  Herwig Schopper The need for a large-scale scientific project to bring the Middle-East back into the scientific community as well as promote peace and foster international collaboration has been recognised for almost 40 years. In his speech at the 1979 Nobel Prize banquet, Pakistani physicist Mohammad Abdus Salam stated that we should \\"strive to provide equal opportunities to all so that they can engage in the creation of Physics and science for the benefit of all mankind\\". In his paper presented at the Symposium on the \\"Future Outlook of the Arabian Gulf University\\", on 11 May 1983, in Bahrain, titled The Gulf University and Science in the Arab-Islamic Commonwealth, Abdus Salam proposed the founding of a Super Gulf University and an international laboratory in material sciences in Bahrain. Such a laboratory was proposed for the University of Jeddah, to emphasise science and technology transfer in the material sciences, including a laboratory with a synchrotron radiation light source. Ultimately, the proposal did not come through, possibly because it had the sponsorship of a single university rather than a consortium of universities. In 1997, Herman Winick and Gustav-Adolf Voss suggested building a light source in the Middle-East using components from the soon-to-be decommissioned BESSY I facility in Berlin, during two seminars organized in 1997 in Italy and in 1998 in Sweden by Tord Ekelof with the CERN-based Middle East Scientific Co-operation (MESC) group headed by Sergio Fubini. Winick was credited with the idea of moving the machine to the Middle-East during discussions about the future of the machine. He explained \\"(his) main motivation is to help create a project in which people can work constructively and collectively.\\" This proposal was adopted and pursued by MESC. The German government agreed to donate the necessary equipment at the request of Fubini and Herwig Schopper. Believing that the only chance of realizing such a project was following the example of CERN, the plan was brought to the attention of Federico Mayor, then Director-General of UNESCO, who organized the Consultative Meeting on a Middle East Synchrotron Light Facility, at UNESCO headquarters in Paris in June 1999. The meeting resulted in the launching of the project and the establishment of an International Interim Council under the chairmanship of Herwig Schopper. In May 2002, the Executive Board and Director General of UNESCO unanimously approved the establishment of the Centre under UNESCO auspices, through resolution 31C/Resolution 19. The groundbreaking ceremony for SESAME took place at Al-Balqa' Applied University in Jordan, on 6 January 2003. SESAME used offices at the UNESCO Office in Amman until the completion of the building in 2008. In April 2004, the centre formally came into existence when the required number of Members had informed UNESCO of their decision to join. and a permanent Council was established. The founding members were Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, and Turkey. The current Members are Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority, and Turkey.

SESAME was officially opened on 16 May 2017 by King Abdullah II of Jordan. = Early Criticism = The German and French Ambassadors to UNESCO complained that K≈çichir≈ç Matsuura, then Director General of UNESCO, had not followed UNESCO protocol while making this decision. Schopper explained the difficult circumstances the project was facing and they withdrew their complaints. Matsuura did not need formal approval to provide the required funds because the Japanese government had given him a budget to be used at his discretion when he was appointed Director General. SESAME faced a further setback when the German government was asked to withdraw the authorization of export of BESSY I after public criticism was raised because some scientists claimed that it is possible to produce nuclear materials for atomic bombs with SESAME. Schopper was invited to a televised discussion with Professor Dr. Reinhard Brandt, one of the scientists who made the critical claims. The objections were eventually resolved, as Schopper explained that although some plutonium could have been produced, it would not have been a sufficient amount to develop a bomb. The BESSY I components were eventually shipped from Berlin to Hamburg and then to the Zarqa Free Zone in Jordan, where they were held by the Jordanian government until SESAME was formally founded and the building was ready to accept the components. Location Before UNESCO could formally approve SESAME, the issue of finding a host country and a site had to be resolved. The Interim Council agreed on a set of criteria which had to be satisfied by the host country and site. The lab had to be accessible, geographically and politically, to scientists from all over the world, and the host state should be strongly committed to the project, and should provide the land on which the lab would be based for free, as well as provide the building itself and the technical infrastructure (roads, water, electricity). Seven Members (Armenia, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Oman, Palestine and Turkey) proposed 12 sites. UNESCO Assistant Director General for Natural Sciences, Maurizio Iaccarino, and Schopper visited Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Palestine in September 1999. The Armenian, Iranian and Turkish proposals were explored at Interim Council Meetings. Although Egypt expressed strong interest in the project, a long procedure which involved going through many authorities was necessary before the project could be presented to the Prime Minister, and the proposal was ultimately deemed unfit. The Palestinian National Authority, although interested in the project, did not have the financial capacity to meet the Interim Council's criteria. For political reasons, Israel could not provide a site accessible to all scientists. Additionally, Israel was already heavily involved in the ESRF laboratory at Grenoble, and were contractually bound to provide considerable funds. Furthermore, biologists did not see how they would benefit from SESAME since they already had access to other laboratories across the world. Armenia offered to host SESAME in their building Synchrotron Laboratory at Erevan since their accelerator was outdated. Their proposal was strengthened with the backing of wealthy Iraqi- born Armenian-American businessman Kevork Hovnanian. However, it was later realized that several alterations to the building were necessary to make it a viable site for SESAME. Iran, considered a rogue state at the time, though interested in the project, could not guarantee access to scientists from all countries, and so the proposal was ultimately unsuccessful. = Approving Jordan = In Jordan, Adnan Badran, Deputy Director of UNESCO from 1992 to 1998, organised a meeting with representatives from universities and other organisations. No government members could be met, and no commitment was obtained. In a last ditch effort to save the project, Schopper contacted his former student Isa Khubeis, then Vice-President of Al-Balqa Applied University. Khubeis invited Iaccarino and Schopper to dinner along with Khaled Toukan, President of Al-Balqa University, and Prince Ghazi Bin Muhammad, who Chairman of the Board of Governors of the University and a close advisor of King Abdullah II. Schopper explained the situation to Prince Ghazi, who arranged a meeting with King Abdullah for the following day. King Abdullah formally committed Jordan to the project during the meeting in a signed letter addressed to the Director General of UNESCO. After long discussions and a series of votes, Jordan was formally approved to be the host of the Centre at the third meeting of the SESAME Interim Council in June 2000. Egypt and Iran withdrew their proposals before the final round of voting. The decision was ratified by 9 votes in favour and 1 abstention. Jordan was seen as an appropriate location for the project because it was the only country at the time to have maintained diplomatic relations with all other founding members: Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority, and Turkey. Cost The project cost around $90 million, with $5 million donated each by Jordan, Israel, Turkey, Iran and the European Union. The rest was donated by CERN from existing equipment. Jordan became the greatest contributor to the project by donating land and building construction costs, and by pledging to build a $7 million solar power plant; this will make SESAME the first accelerator in the world to be powered by renewable energy. The annual operational cost of $6 million is pledged by the members according to the size of their economies.  Funding  The BESSY facility in Berlin As well as the drawn-out process in deciding which country should host SESAME, the project came across several other difficulties on its path to completion. Possibly the largest issue was its funding. Because the major components of the laboratory from the decommissioned BESSY I experiment, originally valued at $60 million, were being donated by the German government, funding on that front was not an issue. However, the German government stipulated that the cost of dismantling, including documentation, packing and transport, had to be provided by SESAME. The cost was an estimated $600,000, and had to be guaranteed before the end of 1999 because the BESSY building had been promised to the Max Planck Society. Schopper had been informed of this condition only a few hours before the Interim Council meeting, and asking for voluntary contributions would have been ineffective because most delegates at the meeting would not have had the authority to make financial decision. After a discussion between the Interim Council, the United States State Department, Sweden and Russia agreed to provide $200,000. Schopper saw only one possible option to save the project. He asked UNESCO Director General Koichiro Matsuura to arrange an emergency meeting. They had a lunch together, and Schopper asked Matsuura to fund the missing $400,000 immediately. Matsuura agreed to the request and the Interim Council Members were informed after the lunch. Because the BESSY components were used only as an injector system, the construction of a new main ring was still needed for SESAME. The estimated cost of the ring was $10 million so additional sources of funding were required. On 23 July 2001 a formal proposal supported by the German and French Ministers of Research, and later the Commissioner for Research Philippe Busquin, was submitted to European Commissioner Chris Patten. In October 2001 chef de cabinet of Commissioner Patten, Anthony Cary, informed Schopper that an independent evaluation by a panel of international experts was needed. The Techno-Economic Feasibility Study was under the guidance of Professor Guy Le Lay of the University of Marseille. The report concluded that the project was promising and would \\"effectively stimulate scientific activity and cooperation in the Middle East\\". However, in August 2003, Commissioner Patten stated that \\"the Commission is not in a position at this stage to provide Community funding to SESAME\\". In a subsequent meeting arranged between the Jordanian government, SESAME representatives and the EU Commission, the main of contention was the project's energy level. It was claimed that a competitive facility needed a higher energy level. A compromise was reached that the machine should start at 2 GeV, with 2.5 GeV available at a later stage. This would have increased the cost of the ring by another $2 million. The issue was eventually resolved through negotiations started by Director General Rolf Heuer between CERN and the Commissioner for Research and Innovation, Carlos Moedas. About $5 million were approved for CERN to be used for the construction of the magnets of the SESAME main ring. Design The machine works in four stages. =Microtron= The microtron accelerates electrons to the energy of 22.5 MeV, and injects them into the booster. It was fully operational in November 2011. =Booster synchrotron= The booster synchrotron receives electrons from the microtron, and accelerates them to 800 MeV, for injection into the storage ring. The booster was created with parts from the German synchrotron facility BESSY, which was decommissioned in 1999. =Storage ring= The storage ring accelerates electrons to 2.5 GeV, and keeps them circulating for as long as two hours. As the electrons go around the storage ring, they emit x-rays. Lost energy is replaced as the beam travels through radio frequency cavities along the ring. =Beamlines= X-rays from the storage ring are directed to beamlines, where research experiments are performed. #BASEMA (Beamline for Absorption Spectroscopy for Environmental and Material Applications ), a beamline for X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, the 'day-one' beamline to be ready in March/April 2017 #EMIRA (ElectroMagnetic Infrared RAdiation) for IR (Infrared Spectromicroscopy), is the second 'day-one' beamline, in this case that to start operations in April/May 2017 #SUSAM (SESAME USers Application for Materials Science) or Materials Science (MS), to be completed at the end of the third quarter of 2017 #MX (Macromolecular Crystallography), the beamline to be completed in 2019 #Soft X-ray Beamline #SAXS/WAXS (Small Angle and Wide Angle X-ray Scattering) #Tomography Beamline Initial beams Although the current facility has space for seven light beams, only two beams were operational when the facility opened in 2017. The first beam is an X-ray beam that will be used to study pollution in the Jordan Valley, among other things. While the second beam provides infrared radiation for a microscope that would study biological tissue; including cancer cells. The rest are planned for later, with the third beam, an X-ray source used for crystallography, slated for late 2017.

He was educated at Rondebosch Boys' High School. He made his professional debut at the age of sixteen when he broadcast Bach, Chopin and Chabrier on the SABC. In 1968, he performed Felix Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No 1 with the Cape Town Symphony Orchestra. In 1971, he moved to London where he studied at Trinity College of Music. He studied under Jacob Kaletsky and Richard Arnell. After a live d√©but broadcast recital on BBC Radio 3 in 1974, his first recital at Wigmore Hall was reported as \\"stylish and powerful\\" by The Times. In 1975, he was selected as one the Young Musicians of the Year by the Greater London Arts Association. He also won first prize in the 1976 SABC Piano Competition. He was described by the Daily Telegraph as having \\"remarkable gifts of style, technical mastery and artistry\\". He made his d√©but as a composer in the 1977 when he premiered his own Piano Suite No 1 Mosaics at Wigmore Hall. His concerto repertoire includes the Viennese classics, many from the nineteenth century, and amongst those from the 20th, the piano concertos of Arthur Bliss and John Joubert, both of which he studied with the composers. Conductors he has appeared with include Hugo Rignold, Maurice Handford, Piero Gamba and Christian Badea. Career His professional career as a composer began in 1980 with the premiere of 'Ch√©ri' an hour-long ballet commissioned by Peter Darrell for The Scottish Ballet, given at that year's Edinburgh Festival, and frequently revived, with a new production by The Hong Kong Ballet in 1989. To date there have been six more ballet commissions, including two for CAPAB Ballet ‚Äì 'The Return of the Soldier' (1982) and 'Abelard and Heloise' (1985), both choreographed by Veronica Paeper, and a full-evening 'Macbeth' (1991) for Ballet de Santiago in Chile, choreographed by Andre Prokovsky. David had recently collaborated with the Royal Ballet choreographer Vanessa Fenton on two smaller works mounted in Cambridge in 2009. Piano Concerto No 1 appeared in 1980, followed by a Two-Piano Concerto (1986), concertos for Violin (1991), Cello (1996), Trumpet (2005), Piano Concerto No 2 (2007) and a Double Violin Concerto (2011). Among choral compositions is a symphonic setting of Wordsworth's 'Intimations of Immortality', a cyclic setting of George Herbert 'Mans' Medley', and 'Island Owl' for soloists, children's chorus and orchestra. Chamber works include two sonatas each for violin and cello, a Clarinet Trio, Piano Quintet, String Quartet, and for solo piano, three Suites: 'Mosaics', 'Gargoyles' and 'Mandalas', as well as 'Oxymorons: 24 Preludes'. He was introduced to the world of writing film music by the producer David Puttnam and wrote for a number of productions between 1982 and 1987, in particular 'P'Tang Yang Kipperbang' (directed by Michael Apted), and 'Arthur's Hallowed Ground' (directed by the veteran cinematographer Freddie Young). David has been fortunate in collaborating with young musicians at the start of their careers ‚Äì Tasmin Little, Martin Roscoe, Alexander Chaushian and Jamie Campbell gave the first performances of, respectively, the Violin Concerto, Violin Sonata No 1, the Cello Concerto, and Violin Sonata No2. The CD of the Cello Sonata and 'Mandalas' Piano Suite received a Gramophone Editor's recommendation rossette, and was nominated by International Piano magazine for best new music recording 2007. In June 2012 his setting of Rupert Brooke's 'The Old Vicarage, Grantchester' for baritone chorus and orchestra, commissioned by Dame Mary Archer to mark the poem's centenary, was given its first performance at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, with the Cambridge University Chamber Orchestra, members of the choirs of Clare and Gonville and Caius College, and Nicholas Mogg as baritone soloist. Recent first performances include a new Clarinet Concerto, premiered in October 2013 in Durban, South Africa, with Maria du Toit, clarinet, and the KwaZuluNatal Philharmonic Orchestra under Arjan Tien. Within the last few years David has completed two full length operas: Mary and the Conqueror in which Alexander the Great and Mary Renault meet in the afterlife; and 'Strange Ghost', composed to mark the centenary of the death of the iconic poet Rupert Brooke. The latter was premiered in Cambridge in December 2015, directed by Dionysios Kyropoulos,www.kyropoulos.com and conducted by Dominic Peckhamdominicpeckham.com with James Schouten in the title role.www.RupertBrookeOpera.com David teaches piano performing to undergraduates at Cambridge University, and is a supervisor for Tripos Composition students. In 2001 he was ordained into the then Western Buddhist Order (now Triratna Buddhist Order) and given the Order name of Akashadeva ('deity of etheric space'). Some of his musical compositions show influences from this immersion in Buddhist thinking, in particular the piano suite Mandalas, whose four movements are inspired among others by the vajras of Indian mythology, the lotus symbol and the Five Dhyani Buddhas that represent the five key qualities of the Buddha.David Earl, notes to Divine Art CD DDA25060, 'Music by David Earl' (2007) In 2017 two new works were premiered: Piano Suite No 4 Darshanas, and a Duo Sonata for Viola and Double Bass, the latter a commission from the South African double bass virtuoso Leon Bosch, for whom David has also written Nocturne: Old Nectar for Bass and Piano.

Romanesque is the architecture of Europe which emerged in the late 10th century and evolved into Gothic architecture during the 12th century. The Romanesque style in England is more traditionally referred to as Norman architecture. The style can be identified across Europe with certain significant architectural features occurring everywhere. There are other characteristic which differ greatly from region to region. Most of the buildings that are still standing are churches, some of which are very large abbey churches and cathedrals. The majority of these are still in use, some of them having been substantially altered over the centuries. This list presents a comparison of Romanesque churches, abbeys and cathedrals of different countries. The second section describes the architectural features that can be identified within pictures of major architectural elements. Romanesque architecture, regional characteristics = Features of Romanesque architecture that is seen in different areas around Europe. = * Small churches are generally without aisles, with a projecting apse. * Large churches are basilical with a nave flanked by aisles and divided by an arcade. * Abbey churches and cathedrals often had transepts. * Round arches in arcades, windows, doors and vaults. * Massive walls. * Towers. * Piers. * Stout columns. * Buttresses of shallow projection. * Groin vaulting. * Portals with sculpture and mouldings. * Decorative arcades as an external feature, and frequently internal also. * Cushion capitals. * Murals. =Features which are regionally diversified= These features often have strong local and regional traditions. However, the movement of senior clergy, stonemasons and other craftsmen meant that these traditional features are sometimes found at distant locations. * Ground plan. * Facade. * Position and number of towers. * Shape of towers. * Presence and shape of spires. * Shape of the east end. * Shape of columns. * Shape of piers. * Building material. * Local diversity in decorative details that was dependent on local craftsmen. Romanesque churches in Italy File:Atrium of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio.jpgAtrium of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, in Milan File:Catedral de Pisa, Toscana, It√†lia.JPGPisa Cathedral showing polychrome, galleries, dome (completed later), and free-standing campanile File:Verona Zeno.jpgSan Zeno, Verona, showing defined facade, porch and wheel window File:Trani Cathedral BW 2016-10-14 15-44-23.jpgWest front of Trani Cathedral, with bell tower File:Bari BW 2016-10-19 13-35-11 stitch.jpgFront of Basilica di San Nicola, in Bari =Influences= * Pre-Romanesque is demonstrated in Italy by the construction of churches with thick walls of undressed stone, very small windows and massive fortresslike character. * Early Christian and Italian Byzantine architecture formed a stylistic link with the architecture of Ancient Rome, through which the basilica plan and the Classical form of column were transmitted. * The architecture of Northern Italy has features in common with French and German Romanesque. * The architecture of Southern Italy and Sicily was influenced by both Norman and Islamic architecture. * Building stone was available in mountainous regions, while brick was employed for most building in river valleys and plains. The availability of marble had a profound effect on the decoration of buildings. * The existence and continuance of local rather than unified rule meant the construction and continued existence of many Romanesque civic buildings, and a large number of cathedrals. * A great many religious buildings of this period remain, many of them little altered. Other buildings include fortifications, castles, civic buildings, and innumerable domestic buildings that are often much altered.

The rest of a brick exterior was generally left undecorated with some notable exceptions including Pisa Cathedral. * Portals were rarely large and were square rather than round, as at San Miniato al Monte. Decorative tympanums, where they exist, are mosaic, fresco or shallow relief, as at San Zeno, Verona. * Shallow relief carving in marble was a feature of some facades, as at San Zeno and Modena Cathedral * Ocular and Wheel windows are commonly found in facades, as at San Zeno and Modena Cathedral. * Portals are sometimes covered by an open porch supported on two columns standing on the backs of lions at San Zeno, Verona. * Internally, large churches generally have arcades resting on columns of Classical form. * There is little emphasis on vertical mouldings. * The wall surface above the arcade was covered with decorative marble, mosaic or fresco. Galleries such as that at Pisa were uncommon, but occur in convent churches as nuns' galleries. * Open timber roofs prevailed. * Ribbed vaults, when used, are large, square and domical, spanning two bays as at San Michele, Pavia, and Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio. * The crossing is often covered by a dome, as at Bari Cathedral and Pisa Cathedral (where the dome is oval and of a later date). * The choir may be above a vaulted crypt, accessible from the nave or aisles, as at San Zeno, Verona. * Freestanding polygonal baptisteries were common, as at Parma Cathedral and the Baptistery of San Giovanni, Florence. * Cloisters often have an array of elaborately twisted columns, and fanciful decoration in mosaic tiles as at the Romanesque cloister of the Ancient Basilica of St Paul's Outside the Walls, Rome. * The large churches and cathedrals of Southern Italy and Sicily were influenced by Norman architecture, as at Trani Cathedral and Bari Cathedral in Apulia. * Churches in Sicily were influenced by Islamic architecture, in the employment of the pointed arch as at Monreale Cathedral and Palermo Cathedral. The lion supporting a column of the porch at Ancona Cathedral is typical of Northern Italy. =Notable buildings= * Pisa Cathedral and complex. Tuscany * Baptistery of Florence, Tuscany * Basilica of San Miniato al Monte, Tuscany * Santa Maria della Pieve, Arezzo * Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, Milan, Northern Italy * Basilica of San Michele Maggiore, Pavia, Northern Italy * Basilica of San Zeno, Verona, Northern Italy * Modena Cathedral, Northern Italy * Ancona Cathedral, Northern Italy * San Vittore alle Chiuse, Genga. * Parma Cathedral and complex, Northern Italy * Trani Cathedral, Apulia * Bari Cathedral, Apulia *Basilica di San Nicola, Apulia * Palermo Cathedral, Sicily * Monreale Cathedral, Sicily * Cefal√π Cathedral, Sicily Romanesque churches in France File:Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Cornadore, Saint-Nectaire.JPGNotre-Dame-du-Mont-Cornadore, Saint-Nectaire, Puy-de-D√¥me with a polygonal crossing tower like Cluny, flat buttresses and a high eastern apse with radiating low apses forming a chevete. File:Paris, Normandie 0393 Boscherville, Abbaye Saint-Georges facade.JPGThe Abbey of Saint-Georges, Boscherville, is very typical of Norman architecture of the early 12th century with storeys of identical windows, blind arcading and paired turrets. The facade reveals the form of nave and aisles. File:France Caen Trinite c.JPGThe Church of the Abbey of la Trinit√©, Caen shows the development of the twin- tower and triple-portal facade File:Angouleme cathedral StPierre ac.JPGAngouleme Cathedral shows a turreted screen facade which gives little indication of the building's form and is typical of southern France. File:Basilique_Saint-Sernin_de_Toulouse_-_exposition_ouest-1-.jpgBasilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse, is a typical example of large pilgrimage churches, with double side aisles. =Influences= * Monastic tradition was a major influence on church architecture with the Abbey Church of Cluny, founded 910 AD, being the largest church in the world at that time. * The foundation of the Cistercian Order in 1098 introduced a simplicity of design and austerity of ornament. * Particularly in the south, the existence of Roman structures such as the Pont du Gard played a part in the development of storied arcades and other structural forms. * Building stone was readily available, including high grade limestone suitable for fine carving. * For much of the period Normandy were comparatively large and powerful political unit, and developed consistent styles that affected much of northern France. * South of the Loire Valley churches showed considerable diversity of architectural form and are often without aisles. * The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain led to the establishment of four pilgrim routes through France, and the establishment of many religious houses along the routes. * Crusade and pilgrimage brought contact with Islamic and Byzantine architecture that influenced the forms of a number of churches such as Saint-Front, P√©rigueux. * The development of ribbed vaulting at Saint-Etienne, Caen, and the adoption of a number of new techniques within a single influential building, the Abbey of Saint-Denis, led to the early employment of the Gothic methods of construction and style from 1140 onwards. * A great many abbey churches, some of which are now cathedrals or have been elevated to the rank of Minor Basilica, date from this period, and are among the finest architectural works of France. There are also numerous village churches, many of which have remained little changed. File:F06.Nevers St.-Etienne.1072.1.JPGThe Church of Saint-Etienne Nevers shows three stages of the nave: arcade, gallery and clerestorey. File:Choeur de l'√©glise de Saint-Savin DSC 1704.jpg Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe shows a high apse with a clerestorey, and ambulatory with columns of Classical form typical of southern France. =Characteristics= * Large churches of northern have basilical form of nave and aisles separated by arcades. * Large churches of southern France may be without aisles, as at Angouleme Cathedral. * Churches generally have transepts. * The eastern end often takes the form of an apse that is almost as high as the walls. * The high apse was increasingly surrounded by an ambulatory and later Romanesque churches have a fully developed chevet with radiating chapels. * In Normandy, two towers on the fa√ßade flanking the nave became standard for large churches and influenced the subsequent Romanesque and Gothic facades of Northern France, England, Sicily and other buildings across Europe. * At the Abbey Church of Cluny, as well as paired towers on the west front, there was a variety of towers large and small. Of these the octagonal tower over the crossing and smaller transept tower remain intact. This arrangement was to influence other churches such as the Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse. * Windows are increasingly of larger size and are often coupled, particularly in cloisters and towers. * The fa√ßade takes two forms, that with two large towers, such as that at Saint-Etienne, Caen, and the screen form with two small flanking turrets, as at Angouleme Cathedral. * There are often three portals, as at the Abbey of la Trinit√©, Caen, left * Fa√ßade decoration is rich and varied, with the central portal being the major feature. * Large sculptured portals are a distinguishing feature of French Romanesque. The portal is deeply recessed and the jambs set with shafts and mouldings. They typically have lintels, supporting a tympanum carved in high relief. * Interiors generally employed piers to support the arcades, rather than columns. The form of the piers became increasing complex with shafts and mouldings leading into the mouldings of the arch, or the vault as at Saint-Etienne Nevers. left * In the 12th century, cylindrical piers with Corinthian style capitals came into use. * A pattern of three stages: vault, arcade and clerestory was established in the 11th century. * Masonry vaults were preferred for larger churches, and were initially barrel or groin vaults, often with arches spanning the nave between the vaults. Vaulted bays are square. * The earliest ribbed high vault in France is at Saint-Etienne, Caen (1120). The wide adoption of this method led to the development of Gothic architecture. * Several churches of Aquitaine and Anjou are roofed with domes, and have no aisles, as at Angouleme Cathedral. Tympanums such as this from la Madaleine, V√©zelay are a feature of French churches. =Notable examples= * Abbey Church of Cluny * The Abbey of Saint-Etienne, Caen * The Church of the Abbey of la Trinit√©, Caen * The Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse * Angouleme Cathedral * Saint-Front, P√©rigueux * Notre Dame du Puy * Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe * Abbey of la Madaleine, V√©zelay * Church of St Philibert, Tournus * Abbey of Saint-Pierre, Moissac * Abbey of Saint-Georges, Boscherville Romanesque churches in Britain and Ireland File:St Mary's Church, Iffley - geograph.org.uk - 1218597 adjusted.JPGSt Mary the Virgin, Iffley, 12th century, shows the detailed carving, particularly chevrons, and the side portal typical of Britain. File:Southwell, the Minster, the West Towers, after Francis Frith - geograph.org.uk - 851535.jpgSouthwell Minster 1108-1250, west front 1108-50 (west window 1450). The severe twin-towered facade with balance of vertical buttresses and horizontal courses is similar to St Etienne, Caen. It has retained its simple spires. File:Rochester Cathedral ClemRutter.JPGRochester Cathedral, 1115-1280, west front 1150 (west window 1470). The west front has its interior forms emphasised by the verticals of the large pinnacled buttresses. The portal is richly carved with Christ in Majesty. =Influences= * The Pre-Romanesque tradition of architecture was Saxon. The thick-walled churches without aisles had archway leading into rectangular chancels. Bell towers often had an attached circular stair turret. Windows were often arched or had triangular heads. * The Norman invasion of 1066 unified the government of England. * Norman bishops were installed in English cathedrals and monasteries were established following Benedictine, Cluniac, Cistercian, and Augustinian rules. * Monasteries were established in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, suppressing local Celtic monastic tradition. * Many cathedrals were of monastic foundation serving a dual role, which affected their architecture, in particular the extended length of the choir and transepts. * There was a great diversity of building stone including limestone, New Red Sandstone, flint and granite. * In England, the relative political stability led to large diocese with few bishops. Cathedrals were correspondingly few in number and large in scale. * Geographical isolation led to the development of distinct regional character. * The climate led to the construction of long naves to facilitate processions in wet weather. * Of the medieval cathedrals, nearly all were commenced in this period and several have remained substantially Norman structures. * Many parish churches were commenced at this period. * The abbey churches suffered destruction at the time of the Dissolution of the monasteries in the early 16th century and the majority were reduced to ruins, some surviving as parish churches. File:Durham Cathedral. Interior.jpgThe Nave of Durham Cathedral has cylindrical piers with incised decoration, also found at Dunfermline Abbey, Scotland. Although Norman in character, the building has the first use of the pointed ribbed vault and flying buttresses. File:Peterborough interior.JPGPeterborough Cathedral, the three-stage nave 1155-75 has piers of ovoid section with attached shafts. While the forms are typically Norman, the length is greater than found in Normandy. The wooden ceiling is original. File:Kelso Abbey 2.jpgKelso Abbey, Scotland, was founded by French monks and maintains French characteristics. File:Cormacs Chapel Rock of Cashel.jpgCormac's Chapel, Rock of Cashel, Ireland, with its steeply pitched roof and bands of blind arcading maintains a distinctly Irish character. =Characteristics= * It is characteristic of the medieval churches of the British Isles and England in particular that they were continually expanded, altered and rebuilt. Consequently, although Norman buildings are numerous, few are intact, and at some, such as Lincoln Cathedral, Gloucester Cathedral and Worcester Cathedral, Norman architecture might be represented only by the portals, the columns of the nave or the crypt. * The Norman facades of cathedrals and large abbeys follow the two basic forms found in France, that with paired towers as at Southwell Minster and that with framing turrets as at Rochester Cathedral. * Portals are usually arched and decorated with chevrons and other geometric ornament, barbaric faces and spirals. There are a few carved Romanesque tympanums, with a Christ in Majesty at Rochester Cathedral. The ornamentation of portals in Ireland have distinctive elements of Celtic design as at the gabled portal of Clonfert Cathedral. * Side porches are common and are often the usually mode of entrance, the western portal only being opened for major festivals. * Blind arcading is used as a major decorative feature, often around internal walls. * Windows are comparatively large and may be arranged in tiers as in the transepts of Peterborough Cathedral. Paired windows occur in towers. * Naves of cathedrals and abbey churches are of great length, and transepts are of strong projection. * Chancels of cathedrals and abbey churches are also very long. * The chancels of cathedrals and abbeys were round and with an ambulatory in the French manner, as indicated at Peterborough and Norwich Cathedrals but none have survived unchanged. * Large central towers are characteristic, as at Tewkesbury Abbey and Norwich Cathedral. * Many round towers occur in Ireland. They are also found in Saxon (Pre-Romanesque) architecture in England as stair towers attached to larger towers of square plan. * The nave rises in three stages, arcade, gallery and clerestory. * The arcade has two forms: arches resting on large cylindrical masonry columns as at Gloucester and Hereford Cathedrals, and arches springing from composite piers as at Peterborough and Ely Cathedrals. Durham Cathedral has alternating piers and columns. * Crypts are groin vaulted, as at Canterbury Cathedral. * Nearly every large Norman church has a later, Gothic high vault, except at Peterborough and Ely Cathedrals which have retained trussed wooden ceilings. The vaults at Durham are of unique importance, that of the south aisle being the oldest ribbed vault in the world, and that of the nave being the earliest pointed ribbed vault in the world. Ribbed vaults of the Norman period exist over the aisles at Peterborough Cathedral and other large churches. * Barrel vaults are rare, examples being St John's Chapel, Tower of London and several 12th century monastic churches in Ireland including Cormac's Chapel and St Flannan's oratory. The door of Kilpeck Church demonstrates the chevrons and \\"barbaric\\" ornament common in Britain =Notable examples= * Durham Cathedral, England * Peterborough Cathedral, England * Ely Cathedral, England * Southwell Cathedral, England * Rochester Cathedral, England * Tewkesbury Abbey, England * St Bartholomew-the-Great, London, England * St Mary the Virgin, Iffley, England * Kilpeck Church, England * The Leper Chapel, Cambridge, England * Dunfermline Abbey, Scotland * Kelso Abbey, Scotland (ruined) * Cormac's Chapel, Ireland * St Mary Magdalene, Campsall, England Romanesque churches in Spain, Portugal and Andorra File:Santa Coloma (esgl√®sia).jpgChurch of Santa Coloma, Andorra, one of a group of such churches, built of rough stone, sometimes laid without mortar File:Jaca, Catedral de San Pedro-PM 32162 adj.JPGJaca Cathedral, Spain, has the deep side porch and galleried tower found on many Spanish churches.

File:SeVelha1.jpgOld Cathedral of Coimbra, like in Lisbon it has a heavy, fortress-like quality. =Influences= * Prior to the beginning of the period, the greater part of the Iberian Peninsula was ruled by Muslims, with Christian rulers controlling only a strip at the north of the country.Banister Fletcher, pp. 635-639 * By 900 the Reconquista had increased the area under Christian rule to about one third of Iberia. This expanded to about half the area by 1150 and included Galicia, Leon, Castille, Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia and Portugal. * Romanesque churches are located in the northern half of the peninsula, with a number occurring in Avila which was re-established and fortified around 1100 and Toledo in central Spain from 1098.Toman, Romanesque, Bruno Klein, Romanesque architecture in Spain and Portugal, pp. 178-179 * Many small Pre-Romanesque churches were established in the 10th century with distinctive local characteristics including vaults, horseshoe arches, and rose windows of pierced stone. * Many Benedictine monasteries were established in Spain by Italian bishops and abbots, followed by the French orders of Cluniacs and Cistercians. * In 1032, the church of Santa Maria de Ripoll was built to a complex plan with double aisles, inspired directly by Old St. Peter's Basilica. The church set a new standard for architecture in Spain.Bruno Klein, pp. 180-181 * Pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela began as early as the 9th century, and by the 11th century was drawing pilgrims from England. The Way of Saint James (Camino de Santiago) was well established by the early 12th century and encouraged the foundation of monasteries along the route. * Most of the area has abundant building stone, granite, limestone, Red Sandstone and volcanic rubble. *There was little timber, so it was used sparingly for roofs. * The northern part of the region is dotted with numerous small churches such as those of Andorra and the Vall de Bo√≠ in Catalonia.The Romanesque, Andorra, the official site, (accessed 13 Aug 2012)Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Bo√≠, UNESCO World Heritage List There are also larger monasteries.

File:Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Bo√≠-113981.jpgSant Climent, Ta√ºll, one of the Catalan Romanesque churches of the Vall de Bo√≠ =Characteristics= * It is characteristic of both cathedrals and large abbey churches that they have many accretions of different periods, particularly flanking chapels, in later styles, often Baroque. * Most churches are built of stone. In areas where brick is used, Toledo, Sahag√∫n, Cu√©llar, the bricks are similar to Roman bricks. The exterior of brick churches, particularly the apses, are decorated with tiers of shallow blind arcading and square-topped niches, as at the churches of San Tirso and San Lorenzo, Sahag√∫n * Small churches abound across the area, usually having an aisleless nave and projecting apse and a bell turret on one gable. * Larger churches often have a wide turret extending across the upper facade with a gallery of openings holding bells, as at Jaca Cathedral * Larger monastic churches often have a short transept and three eastern apses, the larger off the nave and a smaller flanking apse off each transept as at La Seu Vella, Lleida. * Lateral arcaded porches are a distinctive regional characteristic of small churches. Larger churches sometimes have a similar narthex at the west as at Santa Maria, Ripoll * Portals are typically deep set, round topped and with many mouldings, as at La Seu Vella, Lleida, Spain. Portals that are set within porches may be surrounded by rich figurative carvings as at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. * Freestanding towers with increasing openings in each stage, like those of Italy, occur with small churches. * Small churches are sometimes barrel vaulted and are roofed with stone slabs lying directly on the vault. * Wider spaces have timber roofs of low profile, as timber was scarce. * Larger churches such as the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, have barrel vaults, sometimes with transverse arches marking the bays. * Abbey churches of later French foundation have ribbed vaults. * Larger monastic churches and cathedrals have nave and aisles and follow French plans, including chevets as at Avila Cathedral. * The crossing of a large church sometimes has an octagonal tower or dome supported on squinches, as at Santa Maria, Ripoll and the Cathedral of Santa Maria d'Urgell . * At the Old Cathedral, Salamanca and the Cathedral of Zamora there are polygonal crossing domes on pendentives, with narrow windows and with four small corner turrets. * Externally, many large churches are fortresslike, such as Lisbon Cathedral and the Old Cathedral of Coimbra in Portugal and the Sig√ºenza Cathedral, Spain * Rose windows with pierced tracery similar to those that occur in Pre- Romanesque churches of Oviedo are a feature in some facades, such as that at the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Armenteira, Galicia. Frescoes such as this from Sant Climent de Ta√ºll remain is some churches of Spain =Notable examples= * The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, Spain * Santa Maria de Ripoll * The Cathedral of Santa Maria d'Urgell, Spain * Jaca Cathedral, Spain * The cloister of the Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos * San Mart√≠n de Tours, Spain * The Basilica of San Isidoro, Le√≥n, Spain * San Vicente, √Åvila, Spain * Sant Climent de Ta√ºll, Vall de Boh√≠, Spain * The Cathedral of Zamora * Old Cathedral, Salamanca * Lisbon Cathedral, Portugal * Old Cathedral of Coimbra, Portugal * Monastery of Rates, Portugal * The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, Spain Romanesque churches in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands File:Panorama Maastricht.jpgMaastricht, Netherlands, showing the Basilica of Our Lady, Maastricht to the right, and the shorter towers of the Basilica of Saint Servatius (with the tower of St Jan's Church to the left) File:Nivelles Sainte-Gertrude R01.jpgSainte-Gertrude, Nivelles, Belgium, a sturdy church screened behind a large westwerk. =Influences= * Much of Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands were united under Charlemagne who built a castle on the Valkhof, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and the Palatine Chapel at Aachen. * The power of individual bishops and the establishment of cathedrals and monasteries were focused initially in the south of Germany and the Rhineland. * In the early 10th century Germany and Lombardy were united under Otto the Great, crowned in Charlemagne‚Äôs church at Aachen. * Consolidation under Frederick Barbarossa in the 12th century led to the establishment of towns, imperial palaces and churches of imperial patronage. * Despite internal divisions and threats from Poland, Hungary and Denmark, Germany regained power and in the early 13th century Frederick II became Holy Roman Emperor of Germany, Sicily, Lombardy, Burgundy and Jerusalem. * Southern Germany, the Rhineland and Belgium had abundant building stone.Banister Fletcher p. 570 * Saxony and Flanders had little stone, while large parts of the Netherlands and the river plains of northern Germany had none, so that brick was the main building material. * Timber was abundant in Germany and Belgium. *The rich fertile river valleys, particularly those of the Rhine and the Meuse, encouraged the growth of towns.Banister Fletcher, pp 353-357 * The period dating from the 9th to the 13th century produced Romanesque churches.Banister Fletcher, p. 357 Several important Early Romanesque churches occur in Saxony at Hildesheim and Gernrode. Many of the most notable examples of Romanesque architecture occur around the Rhineland, with twelve churches of this period in the city of Cologne.

File:Speyer (DerHexer) 2010-12-19 025 adj.JPGSpeyer Cathedral, Germany, an imperial church that set the style for the region, and includes a groin vault over the nave. =Characteristics= * The most distinctive characteristic of large Romanesque churches is the prevalence of apses at both ends of the church, as on 9th-century Plan of St. Gall, the earliest example being at Gernrode Abbey. Two reasons are suggested: that the bishop presided at one end and the abbot at the other, or that the western apse served as a baptistery. * The main portal of a double-apsed church is into the side of the building, and may be richly decorated with carving. * Both apses are flanked by paired towers. Many of the smaller towers are circular, as at Worms Cathedral. There may be numerous towers of varied shapes and sizes.Banister Fletcher, pp. 363-364 *The crossing is generally surmounted by an octagonal tower, as at Speyer Cathedral. * Spires are of roofed timber rather than stone and take a variety of forms, the most distinctive being the Rhenish helm. Stone is sometimes used for Rhenish helms as at the eastern end of the Basilica of Our Lady, Maastricht. * The towers and apse of the western end are often incorporated into a multi-storey westwerk. These latter take a great variety of forms, from a flat fa√ßade as at Limburg Cathedral, a flat fa√ßade with projecting apse at St Gertrude, Nivelles and a rectangular projecting structure of several storeys that juts beyond the towers as at St Serviatius, Maastricht. *The transepts do not project strongly. * In the Rhineland, the exterior walls and towers are encircled with courses, Lombard bands and dwarf galleries, which serve to emphasise the individual mass of each component part of the whole, as at Speyer Cathedral. * Wheel windows, ocular windows and windows with simple quatrefoil tracery often occur in apses, as at Worms Cathedral. * Wooden roofs were common, with an ancient painted ceiling retained at St Michael‚Äôs, Hildesheim. * Stone vaults were used at a later date than in France, occurring over the aisles at Speyer in about 1060.

File:Lunds domkyrka 01.JPGLund Cathedral, Sweden, has an arcade with paired openings set under a single arch, in a manner common in gallery openings but not usual for nave arcades. =Influences= *Norway, Sweden and Denmark were separate kingdoms for much of the period. *Much of Norway was united from the late 9th century until 1387 under Harold I and his successors. * Cnut the Great briefly united Denmark, England, Norway and parts of Sweden in the early 11th century. *King Olaf II of Norway, known as St Olav, did much to enforce Christianity on the Vikings, and by the end of the 11th Century, Christianity was the only legal religion. * In Denmark, Christianity was promoted by Canute the Holy in the late 11th century, with Sweyn II of Denmark dividing the country into eight dioceses, and establishing many churches, cathedrals and monasteries from about 1060 onwards. * Much of Sweden was united under Olaf Eir√≠ksson around 995, with the southern area, G√∂taland being united with Svealand by Sverker I of Sweden in the 1130s. * Lund Cathedral, Sweden, was made the seat of the archbishop for all of Scandinavia in 1103, but only the crypt remains from the 1130s, the rest being mostly 19th century rebuilding. * Bishop Absalon founded Roskilde Cathedral in Denmark in 1158 and the city of Copenhagen (1160‚Äì67). * Architectural influences came with clergy brought from England (such as Nicholas Breakspeare), Lombardy and Germany. The influence of English Norman architecture is seen particularly in Norway at Nidaros Cathedral, Trondheim, and of German Romanesque at Lund Cathedral, Sweden. * Benedictine monks from Italy introduced the skill of firing bricks to Denmark. * While most churches were initially built of timber, the larger ones were replaced by stone, with brick being the dominant material in much of Denmark where building stone is scarce. * Small Romanesque churches are plentiful and are generally in relatively unchanged condition. Large churches are rare and are much altered as at Aarhus Cathedral, Lund Cathedral and Roskilde Cathedral. * Norway has 25 wooden stave churches from this period, making up all but three of the world‚Äôs medieval wooden churches. * In Sweden, surviving Romanesque churches are concentrated mainly but not exclusively to three provinces: Gotland, Scania and V√§stra G√∂taland File:Husaby kyrka 20090523-01.jpgAt Husaby Church, Sweden, the massive tower is framed by round turrets. File:EgliseBoisDeboutNorvege.jpgHopperstad Stave church, Norway (1130), one of twenty-five remaining from the Medieval period. =Characteristics= * The wooden stave churches of Norway represent a type that was once common across Northern Europe, but elsewhere have been destroyed or replaced. They have timber frames, walls of planks, and shingled roofs which are steeply pitched and overhanging to protect the joints of the building from the weather. * Denmark has seven rotunda churches, which have a circular nave, divided into several storeys internally, and have projecting chancel and apse as at Bjernede Church and Nylars Church. At √òsterlars Church, the chancel and apse are constructed as small intersecting circles. Rotunda churches also occur in Sweden as at Hagby Church. * Bulky west towers with stepped gables are typical of Denmark and are found on smaller churches as at Horne Church, S√∏borg Church, and Aa Church, Bornholm where the tower has paired crow-step gables at each side. * In Denmark the west tower may extend across the whole width of the church, forming a westwerk as at Aa Church and Hvidbjerg Church, Mors√∏, with some such towers incorporating a large open archway with stairs such as at Torrild Church. *Small stone churches in Norway and Sweden have a short wide nave, square chancel, an apse and a western tower with pyramidal shingled spire, as at Hove Church, Norway and Kinneveds Church and V√•mbs Church, Sweden. * Large central towers occur in Norway, as at Old Aker Church. * Free standing belltowers are found, often with half-timbered upper sections. * Stone churches, such as Aa Church, Denmark and Lund Cathedral, Sweden, have Lombard bands and paired windows, similar to churches of Lombardy and Germany. * Openings are generally small and simple. Many doors have a carved tympanum as at Vestervig Church and Ribe Cathedral, Denmark * Most churches have timber roofed naves, but ribbed vaulting over smaller spaces such as the chancel is common. Some small churches, such as Marka Church in Sweden, have groin vaults. Larger churches such as Ribe Cathedral are vaulted. * Arcades may be of simple rectangular piers such as at Ribe, Denmark, or drum columns such as at Stavanger Cathedral, Norway. Lund Cathedral has alternating rectangular piers and piers with attached shafts which support the vault. * Fully developed Romanesque arcades of three stages occur in churches built under English or German influence as at Nidaros Cathedral, Trondheim. * Large churches may have paired towers at the western end, as at Mariakirken, Bergen. * Visby Cathedral and Husaby Church, Sweden, both have a tall westwerk, framed by round towers. At Ribe Cathedral the stone westwerk is framed on the south by a Romanesque tower of German form with a Rhenish helm spire and on the north by a taller Gothic tower in red brick. Detail of the stave church at Urnes shows zoomorphic interlace ornament. =Notable examples= * Hopperstad Stave church, Norway (1130) * Borgund Stave church, Norway * Aa Church, Bornholm, Denmark, late 12th century * Bjernede Church, Denmark * √òsterlars Church, Bornholm, Denmark * Horne Church, Denmark * Vestervig Church, Denmark * Roskilde Cathedral, Denmark (1160‚Äì1280) * St. Bendt's Church, Ringsted, Denmark (1170) * Ribe Cathedral, Denmark * Old Aker Church, Oslo, Norway, founded 1080 * Stavanger Cathedral, Norway * Buttle Church, Gotland, Sweden * Hemse Church Gotland, Sweden * Fardhem Church Gotland, Sweden * Husaby Church, V√§stra G√∂taland, Sweden Romanesque churches in Poland, Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic File:Kostel sv.

Towns and monasteries were established. * The Romanesque style was introduced to Poland from Germany with the founding of the bishopric of Gniezno in 1000. * In Hungary, Stephen I brought the Magyar states together in 1001 and created two Catholic archbishoprics. * Bohemia was largely Christianised in the 10th century under Vaclav I. * The bishopric of Prague was established in 973 with a Saxon Benedictine bishop, Thietmar. * The Benedictine, Premonstratensian and Augustinian orders founded monasteries and built abbey churches throughout the area. * The influence on architectural style was initially from Germany, and later from France and Italy.

Sch√∂ngrabern Church, Austria, has a square chancel and projecting apse. * Larger churches have a nave and aisles, each ending in an apse, and with no transept. Examples are P√©cs Cathedral, J√°k Church and the Basilica of the Assumption, Tismice, Czech Republic. * The aisles sometimes contained galleries for the nobility. * While arcades are usually supported on piers, the Basilica of the Assumption, Tismice has alternating piers and columns which have cushion capitals. * Larger churches have paired western towers, some with decorated central portals, as at J√°k Church and the ruined Zsambek Church, Hungary. * At St. Andrew's Church, Krak√≥w, the unornamented facade takes the form of westwerk, with an octagonal towers rising on either side.

It was first published in 1982 and has since been included in a single book with both The Fox Cub Bold and In the Grip of Winter and in the \\"Omnibus\\" edition (Hutchinson, 1994). Plot =Summary= Following the losses of the harsh winter in White Deer Park, the animals face a new danger when they are treated with hostility by many of the Park's residents, including the territorial fox, Scarface. =Detailed= The book begins with the birth of Vixen's four cubs: Bold, Friendly, Charmer and Dreamer. Shortly afterwards an old scar faced fox, who is referred to as Scarface, approaches them. He tell them that his family has lived on this land since before it became a nature reserve and he does not like foxes from outside. Later Scarface watches Fox and Vixen training their cubs to hunt. Annoyed by how competent Bold is, Scarface attacks them and tries to kill Bold, but is beaten back by Bold and Vixen while the other cubs run away. Though Scarface is forced to retreat, Dreamer is later found dead, her body having been brutally mauled, and Fox has no doubt that Scarface was the culprit. Fox and Vixen then accompany their cubs at all times while they hunt, but Bold resents this and demands greater freedom. Upon being granted this freedom he leaves the part of White Deer Park where the Farthing Wood animals live, despite his father telling him to not leave this area. While exploring he meets Adder who warns him that Scarface patrols this area; then Ranger, one of Scarface's sons and Scarface then suddenly appear and attack Bold. Though Bold evades Scarface and Ranger, Scarface calls upon a dozen nearby foxes who encircle Bold. Adder tells Hare that Bold has been captured, and Hare informs Fox and Vixen. Fox then calls the Farthing Wood animals together and everyone heads off together to rescue Bold. Fox, Vixen, Friendly, and Charmer go on ahead to face Scarface while the other animals remain behind. Bold then suddenly appears and tell everyone that he was able to escape from Scarface's foxes by tricking one of the guards and outrunning the rest. When told by Kestrel that Fox is trying to rescue him Bold regrets his rash actions. The animals head towards Fox and find that the Great White Stag is mediating the conflict between Fox and Scarface, resolving it without any fighting. The animals later realise that Adder asked the Great White Stag to be the mediator. Later, Scarface kills Hare's mate, and Fox decides that Scarface has to be killed. As Scarface is the main threat and has no successor Fox is confident that killing Scarface will cause their problems to end. While Fox wants Adder to kill Scarface he knows that asking Adder directly will not work, so he has Bold and Friendly go and hint to Adder that killing Scarface is vital for everyone's safety. However Bold is not cunning enough to fool Adder and after mentioning that Hare's mate has been killed Adder promises to 'even the score'. Adder then poisons one of Ranger's cousins and returns to Fox only to learn that Fox wanted him to kill Scarface. Fox is angry with Bold for not passing on the message correctly, but Adder does accept part of the blame so Bold is not punished so harshly. Fox has his family, Badger, Tawny Owl, and Weasel act as guards during the night; while Scarface decides to hunt down the snake that killed his relative. Charmer and Ranger meet one night and start to fall in love. Friendly learns of this but decides not to tell anyone else. Meanwhile, Adder decides to hide and wait for Scarface, however due to the cold weather he has to leave his shelter and bask in the sunlight. Ranger spots Adder and tells his father. Scarface sneaks up on Adder and tries to kill him but only manages to bite off the end of Adder's tail. Adder retreats down a hole and waits for Scarface to leave. Scarface tries to determine whether Adder was the one that killed one of his foxes, but Adder refuses to tell him so he leaves. Due to being maimed Adder is annoyed with himself for helping Fox and plots revenge against Scarface. Meanwhile, Charmer is put on guard duty and fails to meet Ranger. Ranger finds her, but they are discovered by Bold. This causes Fox and Vixen to find out about Ranger and Charmer's relationship and Fox and Bold oppose it. After his failure to kill Adder, Scarface decides to launch an attack on the Farthing Wood animals with a dozen foxes. Ranger goes to warn the Farthing Wood animals but runs into Scarface who is testing the lie of the land. Thinking this is why Ranger is here Scarface praises him and they go hunting together. Ranger tries to persuade Scarface to call off the attack, but this annoys Scarface and he calls Ranger a coward. The next day Scarface's group of foxes is seen by Kestrel who informs the other animals. The hares hide in the rabbits' warren, the squirrels hide in trees, and the rest of the animals hide in Badger's set. Finding the woods empty and seeing Kestrel overhead Scarface realise that the animals have been warned and has Ranger track them down. Ranger follows the scent of Charmer, then leads the rest of the foxes in the wrong direction so they lose the scent. Unfortunately, Mole thinks the foxes are his friends and tunnels upwards to see what is happening. Fortunately he is able to retreat before the foxes can eat him. After much searching, Ranger finds and enter the set where the animals are hiding but plans to tell his father than this set is empty. This impresses Fox, but unfortunately Scarface knows they are in the set and demand they come out or be starved to death. Fox emerges from the set and challenges Scarface to single combat, which Scarface accepts. Though Scarface puts up a fierce fight, Fox eventually gets the upper hand and severely injures him, but lets him live. When the Warden suddenly arrives all the foxes flee. As a result of his defeat, the other foxes will no longer follow Scarface. When Scarface has regained his strength, he makes a solo raid on Farthing Wood territory, killing most of the voles and fieldmice, four rabbits, and a single squirrel. In the morning, Fox regrets not killing Scarface and decides to tell the Great Stag what has happened. Whistler then points out that because the animals have tried to build a new Farthing Wood in the park this has caused them to be isolated from the other animals. He recommends that like him the other animals should choose a mate from the animals in White Deer Park. Meanwhile, Scarface takes a drink from a stream, but Adder ambushes him, and bites him in the leg, releasing all of his venom into him. Scarface dies, and Adder later tells his friends about his triumph. After celebrating, the animals of Farthing Wood decide to try to find mates among the inhabitants of White Deer Park. Bold then leaves the reserve to seek out new adventures. Ranger finds his older brother Blaze and his mother trying to hunt down the snake that killed Scarface. To protect Adder Ranger claims that he killed it, then he and Charmer leave to build a new earth. Friendly tries to convince Russet, one of Scarface's relatives, to be his mate. Mole falls in love with a female mole called Mateless, who Badger renames Mirthful. Weasel, Kestrel, Hare, and Leveret (Hare's son) also find mates. However, Tawny Owl and Badger remain bachelors. Characters in Fox's Feud Television series The events of this book are covered in the second half of the second season of The Animals of Farthing Wood (TV series), though the sequence of events is changed slightly. The main difference are that Mole survives the winter, Badger does not die, and Bold does not leave White Deer Park until after Scarface is defeated.

View of the portal. The Madonna dell'Orto is a church in Venice, Italy, in the sestiere of Cannaregio. History The church was erected by the now-defunct religious order the \\"Humiliati\\" in the mid-14th century, under the direction of Tiberio da Parma, who is buried in the interior. It was initially dedicated to St. Christopher, patron saint of travellers, but its popular name suggesting consecration to Holy Virgin comes from the following century, when an allegedly miraculous statue of the Madonna, commissioned for the Church of S. Maria Formosa but rejected, was brought to the Church from the nearby orchard (orto in Italian) where it had languished. The church lay on weak foundations and in 1399 a restoration project was financed by the city's Maggior Consiglio. The Humiliati, due to their \\"depraved customs\\", were ousted in 1462 and the Madonna dell'Orto was assigned to the congregation of Canons Regular of San Giorgio in Alga. The latter order was suppressed in 1668, and the following year the Church and convent annexed were handed over to Cistercians of Lombardy. In 1787 the church came under public administration. Restoration was begun under Austrian rule in the 1840s and finished in 1869, by which time Venice had become part of the unified Kingdom of Italy. Fa√ßade The fa√ßade, built in 1460‚Äì1464, has sloping sides and is in brickwork, divided in three parts by two pilasters strips. The two side sections have quadruple mullioned windows, while the central has a large rose window. The portal is surmounted by a pointed arch with white stone decorations portraying, on the summit, St. Christopher, the Madonna and the Archangel Gabriel by Nicol√≤ di Giovanni Fiorentino and Antonio Rizzo. Under is a tympanum, in porphyry, supported by circular pilaster strips. The whole is included into a porch with Corinthian columns. The upper central section is decorated by small arches and bas-reliefs with geometrical motifs. The upper sides have instead twelve niches each, containing statues of the Apostles. Five other Gothic niches are in the central section, with 18th- century statues representing Prudence, Charity, Faith, Hope and Temperance, taken from the demolished church of Santo Stefano. Interior The interior has a nave and two aisles, with double-framed pointed arches supported by Greek marble columns. The transept is absent, while in the rear is a pentagonal apse decorated by paintings by Jacobo Robusti, known as Tintoretto, who is buried here. The organ over the entrance was built in 1878, and is one of the most powerful in Venice. At an altar to the south/right of the main entrance is St. John Baptist and Saints by Cima da Conegliano, and in the fourth chapel on the North/left facing the main altar, the Contarini Chapel, there is a notable St. Agnes by Tintoretto. The Renaissance Valier Chapel once housed a small Madonna with Child by Giovanni Bellini (1481), stolen in 1993. Other works by Tintoretto in the church include a Presentation in the Temple (South aisle, close to the East end), Adoration of the Golden Calf, Last Judgement (both in the apse, either side of the main altar) and the Four Cardinal Virtues (in the upper storey of the apse, behind the altar), all from 1562 to 1564.

Retrieved 23 February 2007 Cameron has expressed his opposition to Green Taxes in Prime Minister's Questions in October 2013, stating that, in order to cut taxes generally, he would 'roll back' the Green Tax. The 'Big Six' energy companies are advocates of this, according to the Express, in order to avoid Labour's plans for an energy price freeze, which would 'deter much-needed investment' from the energy industry (according to The Daily Telegraph). Labour ‚Äì on the other hand ‚Äì implied that Cameron was being hypocritical, because even though he was proposing reducing renewable investment, he had said previously in the 2010 election campaign, '...vote blue to go green...' (in other words, that the Conservatives would be eco- friendly). The prospect of large-scale solar energy farms being built in the British countryside was discarded by Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, on 8 June 2014. At the time, the solar energy industry received ¬£600mn per annum in subsidy. Pickles killed a project because it would have had \\"major ... adverse impact on the landscape... The loss of a substantial area of productive agricultural land for at least 25 years is another negative factor\\". =Globalisation= At a speech in Mumbai in 2006, Cameron said there were depressed towns \\"where the winds of globalisation [felt] like a chilling blast, not an invigorating breeze\\". While stressing \\"the benefits of globalisation\\", Cameron also argued that globalisation ‚Äì not immigration ‚Äì was to blame for lower wages in the UK, and opposed saying \\"We must also be honest about [globalisation's] costs, because the alternative is that people project their fears and anxieties on to other ethnic groups or other countries.\\" In a 2013 speech at London Gateway, Cameron rejected the \\"unthinking embrace of globalisation, exemplified by New Labour, or the timid alternative of go-it- alone Little Englandism\\", according to Patrick Wintour of The Guardian. Cameron also stated that welfare reform and education reform were necessary in order to compete on the global market, while emphasising national sovereignty and what he perceived to be the UK's role in international affairs. =Rail transport= Subsidy per rail passenger journey for UK, Germany, Italy, France and Spain After the 2010 General Election, the new Conservative-led Coalition continued Labour's policies on rail transport largely unaltered after a pause to review the finances, keeping the privatised system in place. There was continuing support for the High Speed 2 scheme and further developing plans for the route. Whilst initially showing scepticism towards the electrification of the Great Western route, they later gave the project its backing and work began formally in 2012. Crossrail and the upgrade to Thameslink are due for opening in 2018. The Government has moved towards allowing more competition on the intercity network through open access operators. In 2015 it approved a service run by Alliance Rail to operate between London and Blackpool, and both Alliance and FirstGroup have applied to run open access services on the East Coast Main Line. In January 2015, Cameron said \\"We've made sure that rail fares cannot go up by more than inflation. So the rail fare increase this year, as last year, is linked to inflation, and I think that's right. In previous years it's gone up by more than inflation. But, of course, what you're seeing on our railways is a ¬£38bn investment project. And that money is coming, of course, from taxpayers, from the government, and from farepayers as well.\\" He said Britain was seeing \\"the biggest investment in our roads since the 1970s, but in our railways since Victorian times\\". =Regulation= Despite initial strong opposition, Cameron has since declared his support for the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 introduced by the Labour Party. More generally though, he has strongly supported deregulation of the private sector, promising an immediate deregulation bill upon election. He has also pledged to remove Britain from the European Union's social chapter and to withdraw unilaterally from certain directives stemming from the European Union. He has said that Britain must not be a \\"soft touch\\" and has called for a crackdown on \\"access to justice\\". In November 2013 at the World Islamic Economic Forum, Cameron said it was important for the UK to promote and boost Islamic finance: \\"I don't just want London to be a great capital of Islamic finance in the western world, I want London to stand alongside Dubai and Kuala Lumpur as one of the great capitals of Islamic finance anywhere in the world.\\" During his speech Cameron said that the UK would become the first sovereign state outside the Islamic world to issue an Islamic 'sukuk' bond.ftadviser.com: \\"PM: 'Islamic investments can blossom in UK'\\", 7 November 2013 In June 2014, HM Treasury, under direction of Chancellor George Osborne, issued a ¬£200 million Sakk, which was 11.5 times oversubscribed.gov.uk: \\"Government issues first Islamic bond\\", 14 August 2014 =Taxation and public spending= In 2007, the Conservative Party under Cameron's leadership pledged to meet Labour's spending on public services. However, since 2010, the coalition government led by David Cameron issued a nationwide programme of austerity. Comparing coalition austerity measures with the Opposition's, the Financial Times commentator Martin Wolf commented that the \\"big shift from Labour ... is the cuts in welfare benefits.\\" The government's austerity programme is a series of sustained reductions in public spending, intended to reduce the government budget deficit and the welfare state in the United Kingdom. However, the health service and education were \\"ringfenced\\" and protected from spending cuts, although some (such as Dr Louise Marshall in The Guardian) have questioned as to whether the National Health Service (NHS) really is exempt from austerity measures. In particular, the Health and Social Care Act 2012 caused an increased privatisation of the NHS by 500% in 2014 alone, Paul Evans claims in openDemocracy. By 2014 the Treasury extended the proposed austerity period until at least 2018. Crime and justice =Capital punishment= Cameron opposes the death penalty, saying that while \\"There are MPs who think we should restore the death penalty... I don't happen to take that view.\\" =Terrorism= In 2007, Cameron wrote a piece about his experiences in a national newspaper about his visit with a Muslim family in Birmingham. It turns out he has been leery since before that time of the adjective \\"Islamist\\" used to describe the type of terrorism seen in some Muslims:theguardian.com: \\"What I learnt from my stay with a Muslim family\\", 13 May 2007 In July 2014, emergency laws were brought in to force phone and internet companies to hold records of customers' calls, texts and visits to websites, purportedly to defend national security against the terrorist threat from Iraq and Syria in light of the civil war in that part of the world. The legislation brought to domestic shores the Five Eyes program revealed in 2012 by former Booz-Allen contractor Edward Snowden, and were a response to a ruling by the European Court of Justice which struck down mere regulations that forced communications companies to retain metadata for police use for 12 months. MI5 investigations had employed this data over the past decade to catch drug dealers, paedophiles and fraudsters and prevent miscarriages of justice. The legislation carries a 2-year sunset clause. =ISIL flag= A domestic ban on the ISIL flag was promised by David Cameron on 16 August 2014, in the wake of the \\"onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement\\";bbc.com: \\"Iraq crisis: Cameron warns of IS threat to UK\\", 17 August 2014 he went so far as to address the issue with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe:telegraph.co.uk: \\"David Cameron: Isil poses a direct and deadly threat to Britain\\", 16 August 2014 The ban promised by Cameron was tested to failure not 11 months afterward, when a man and his daughter were photographed on a summer weekend in broad daylight near Parliament Square mere days after the 2015 Sousse attacks.telegraph.co.uk: \\"Police let pair fly Isil flag outside Parliament\\", 6 July 2015 Hogan-Howe now said carrying the black flag of the terrorist organisation was \\"not necessarily the worst thing in the world\\", adding that the police should not overreact,telegraph.co.uk: \\"Met Chief defies PMs call to arrest all Isil flag carriers\\", 7 July 2015 while Boris Johnson, then still the Mayor of London, saw no problem with the terrorist flag in the UK because \\"we live in a free country\\".\\"Extremists are 'free' to fly Isil flags in London, says Boris Johnson\\", 8 July 2015 =Deportation and the ECHR= In the context of the successful conviction at trial, which occurred in the state of New York after a lengthy extradition battle in the UK, of Egyptian-born Finsbury Park Mosque hate preacher Abu Hamza Cameron said that: Abu Hamza al-Masr, formerly known as Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, had preached at the Finsbury Park mosque after having been jailed for seven years for inciting murder and racial hatred.bbc.com: \\"Abu Hamza: Cameron calls for faster extradition process\\", 20 May 2014 Hamza was on trial in New York accused of conspiring to set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon and helping abduct two American tourists and 14 other people in Yemen in 1998.\\"How Abu Hamza came to court in New York\\", 14 April 2014 More terrorists could be kicked out of the country if it were not for the Liberal Democrats led by Nick Clegg with whom the Conservatives were allied in coalition government between 2010 and 2015, suggested Cameron on 20 May 2014. The Government needed to restore Britain's ability to deport extremists, said Cameron, but it was crucial to overhaul the European Convention of Human Rights to do this. Cameron's proposal to abolish the Human Rights Act 1998 and create a British Bill of Rights would have enabled some of these measures, as well as resolving issues including the rights of terror suspects and the ability of prisoners to vote. However, Cameron has opposed leaving the ECHR altogether. Cameron had expressed previously his joy at the hate preacher's extradition, and said in October 2012 that the Government must consider ways of stopping similar cases reoccurring:\\"Cameron 'delighted' Hamza is out of the UK\\", 6 October 2012 Cameron had said previously in April 2012 on the occasion of the ECHR decision that facilitated Hamza's extradition: \\"I am very pleased with the news. It is quite right that we have proper legal processes, although sometimes one can get frustrated with how long they take. I think it is very important that the deportation and expulsion arrangements (work) promptly and properly, particularly when people are accused of very serious crimes.\\"\\"David Cameron frustrated at wait to send Abu Hamza to US\\", 10 April 2012 =Youth justice and ASBOs= In July 2006 Cameron spoke to the Centre for Social Justice in which he highlighted the problem of young offenders and called for more understanding. At the time, the News of the World headlined its report of the speech \\"Hug a hoodie, says Cameron\\",News of the World, 9 July 2006, p. 16 coining a phrase which came into popular use, although Cameron never actually used the phrase.

Poor quality public space.\\"'The role of social enterprises and community groups' , Cameron Leadership Website, 18 July 2005. Retrieved 19 July 2007 Upon becoming leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron set up a number of committees, such as the Social Justice Policy Group chaired by Iain Duncan Smith, to generate policy ideas on these issues. He describes Big Society project as his \\"great passion\\"; with 10 Downing Street saying that the policy \\"create[s] a climate that empowers local people and communities, building a big society that will 'take power away from politicians and give it to people'.\\"Government launches \\"Big Society\\" programme 10 Downing Street website 18 May 2010 Some commentators have seen the \\"Big Society\\" as invoking Edmund Burke's idea of civil society, putting it into the sphere of one-nation conservatism, a legacy which Cameron \\"eagerly latched\\" onto, according to Forbes. The idea of a \\"Big Society\\" became the flagship policy of the 2010 UK Conservative Party general election manifesto and formed part of the subsequent legislative programme of the Conservative ‚Äì Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement. Upon the launch of the \\"Big Society\\" on 19 July 2010 it was deemed damaging and unworkable by the Labour Party, the national press, and the country's two largest unions. =Counter-Extremism policy= In the midst of the bombing campaign of ISIS in Iraq and the raft of murders by fundamentalist Islamic terrorists in the past decade both at home and abroad, Cameron outlined in a speech in July 2015 a plan based on what he termed \\"liberal values\\" to counter what he labelled as \\"extremism\\". He argued that people were attracted towards extremism for four primary reasons, and later set out four planks of a response. Among other items, he promised a Counter- Extremism Bill, empowered parents to cancel the passports of their children, said that the government would publish a Counter-Extremism Strategy, reiterated his goal to promote identity politics, and offered a revitalised Cohesive Communities Programme.gov.uk: \\"Extremism: PM speech\\", 20 July 2015 It has been suggested by David Anderson QC (on behalf of a governmental anti- extremism watchdog) that: > If the wrong decisions are taken, the new [counter-extremism] law risks > provoking a backlash in affected communities, hardening perceptions of an > illiberal or Islamophobic approach, alienating those whose integration into > British society is already fragile, and playing into the hands of those who, > by peddling a grievance agenda, seek to drive people further towards > extremism and terrorism. =Media= In May 2007, Cameron viewed the BBC as a means of curbing the spread of Islamism, saying: =Abortion= Cameron suggested in May 2008 that the current time limit be cut from 24 weeks after conception to 20 weeks. =Three-parent babies= The question of three-parent embryos or three-person IVF was proposed in December 2014 and passed through Parliament in February 2015.parliament.uk: \\"Lords discusses mitochondrial donation\\", 24 February 2015 The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Jane Ellison) obtained the support of 382 of her colleagues in this free vote, including David Cameron.

Standard Note: SN/HA/1003\\", 21 January 2015 =LGBT rights and same-sex marriage= Cameron opposed the repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, which banned local authorities from the \\"promotion of homosexuality\\". In 2000, Cameron accused Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair of being against family values and of \\"moving heaven and earth to allow the promotion of homosexuality in our schools\\". In 2003, once Cameron had been elected as Conservative MP for Witney, he voted against the repeal of Section 28 in 2003. Shortly after becoming leader of the Conservatives, he distanced himself from this stance, saying \\"I'm glad that it's gone\\". In 2009, he apologised for previously supporting Section 28. In 2002, Cameron voted in favour of a bill that would allow unmarried heterosexual couples to adopt children, but which would specifically ban gay couples from adopting. He later voted in favour of civil partnerships for gay men and lesbians in 2004. In 2008, he opposed giving lesbians the right to in vitro fertilisation treatment, stating that they should be required to name a father figure, which received condemnation from LGBT equality groups. In 2010, David Cameron was given a score of 36% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall.\\"MPs' voting records\\". Stonewall. 2010. In his speech at the 2011 Conservative Party Conference, Cameron endorsed same-sex marriage: The coalition government began a consultation on same-sex marriage. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 was subsequently passed in 2013 and legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales. The government also changed the ban on blood donations from men who have had sexual relations with other men from a permanent ban to a one-year ban, though the permanent ban remains in Northern Ireland. When David Cameron announced his resignation on 13 July 2016, the former Prime Minister said in his speech, \\"enabling those who love each other to get married whatever their sexuality‚Äù was one of his most significant accomplishments. =Health= Cameron has pledged to develop policies to make the NHS a \\"more efficient, more effective and more patient-centered service.\\" He wishes to grant the NHS much greater independence from the Department of Health in order to prevent it being used as a \\"political football\\" and to create \\"greater professional responsibility\\".Cameron wants 'independent' NHS, BBC News, 9 October 2006.

The following year, the Cameron-lead coalition government introduced the Health and Social Care Act 2012, which has been described as the most deep-rooted and extensive reworking of the structure of the National Health Service ever undertaken. The proposals are primarily the result of policies of the then Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley.British Medical Journal, 2011; 342:d408, \\"Dr Lansley's Monster\\".

He commissioned economist Jim O'Neill to lead an independent review exploring the economic issues surrounding resistance. =Education= Cameron has endorsed Labour's creation of city academies, as a way of improving standards in deprived areas. He called on the then government to go \\"further and faster\\" with the policy, saying that academies should be given even more freedom from central control. He said the scheme would be greatly extended if he were elected.Tory leader backs city academies, BBC News Online, 10 October 2006.

The Identity Documents Bill was presented to the House of Commons by Home Secretary Theresa May on 26 May 2010, making the Identity Documents Act the first government bill to be introduced to the 55th Parliament of the United Kingdom under David Cameron. =British Hindus= David Cameron supports referring to British Hindus as a separate ethnic group, refining definition of \\"Asian\\" to separate ethnic groups, saying \\"And if you prefer to be referred to as British Hindus or British Indians rather than as simply Asians, we should welcome that as a positive thing.\\"David Cameron: Speech to Soar Valley Community College , 21 July 2006.

According to Jos√© Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, Cameron's immigration policy would be illegal under EU law. The UK High Court also declared the minimum age for foreign spouses to be unlawful. He has called for the introduction of a British Border Control police force, quotas for asylum seekers and all asylum claims to be assessed in overseas centres. If necessary, the party under his leadership would \\"tear up its commitments under the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees to get its way.\\" In January 2010, prior to the election that brought him to power in May 2010, Cameron said in response to George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, who worried about strain on the British tradition of hospitality: \\"In the last decade, net immigration in some years has been sort of 200,000, so implying a 2 million increase over a decade, which I think is too much.

He agreed parents should be responsible for making sure children speak English. Cameron also said: \\"If you look at the figures for the number of people who are brought over as husbands and wives, particularly from the Indian sub- continent, we should be putting in place ‚Äì and we will be putting in place ‚Äì tougher rules to make sure they do learn English and so when they come, if they come, they can be more integrated into our country.\\"bbc.com: \\"Tougher English rules for immigrants on way ‚Äì Cameron\\", 2 February 2011 Also in February 2011, the UK Border Agency was upbraided by an independent Government inspector because immigration staff were failing to take action against hundreds of migrant workers who have no right to stay in Britain.

In her May 2014 appearance on the Andrew Marr show, Home Secretary Theresa May blamed the Liberal Democrats coalition partners for the immigration target failure, when it was reported by the Office for National Statistics that the net influx of immigrants had risen to 212,000 in the year to December 2013, from 177,000 the previous year. In November 2014, Home Secretary Theresa May made clear government is preparing for public admission of failure to cut net migration to tens of thousands. The pledge made by Cameron to reduce annual net migration to below 100,000 during this parliament had \\"begun to publicly unravel\\"; May said that Cameron's \\"no ifs, no buts\\" passage in April 2011 was just a \\"comment\\" while another spokesman described it as an \\"objective\\".

Cameron has argued passionately for limits in welfare payments and in favour of individual initiative. Alongside the tougher medical tests, he proposes requiring all people receiving Jobseeker's Allowance to join a return to work programme and prevent people who refuse a job offer while on benefits from claiming for three years. People who claim benefits for two out of three years would be required to join a community work scheme. He strongly believed in the centrality of work to life and the duty of every citizen and resident to work full-time hours in either one full-time job or several part-time jobs from adolescence into old age. The government's austerity programme, which involves reduction in government welfare spending, has been linked to a rise in food banks. A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2015 found that each 1 percentage point increase in the rate of Jobseeker's Allowance claimants sanctioned was associated with a 0.09 percentage point rise in food bank use. The austerity programme's welfare cuts have faced opposition from disability rights groups for disproportionately affecting disabled people. The bedroom tax is an austerity measure that has attracted particular criticism, with activists arguing that two thirds of council houses affected by the policy are occupied with a person with a disability.  Welfare Reform and Work Bill  One of these reforms was the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, supported by Iain Duncan Smith (Secretary of State for Work and Pensions) and the Conservative Party. Many people have criticised the bill, with some even going as far as to defining it as a \\"Pandora's box for Britain's poorest families\\". The cuts to tax credits have been criticised for unfairly disadvantaging the working poor, and a clause in the bill allows the benefits cap of ¬£20,000 (¬£23,000 in London) to be reduced further, without any consultation with Parliament, thus making those from larger families even worse off. It also called for ¬£12bn to be made in cuts, in accordance with the government's policy of austerity.David Maddox, The Scotsman. \\"Labour deeply divided as welfare reform bill passes\\".

Harriet Harman (then acting as Leader of the Labour Party) ordered her Labour MPs to abstain from the vote for the bill as opposed to voting against it ‚Äì a move which United States-based magazine The Nation said \\"underline[d] Labour's moral and intellectual bankruptcy\\".D. D. Guttenplan \\"Why a Left-Wing Socialist Is Poised to Become the Leader of Britain's Labour Party\\", The Nation (26 August 2015). The current Leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, voted against the bill, alongside 48 Labour MPs who defied the orders of Harman. Other parties in opposition to the bill were the Scottish National Party (who said that the Bill was \\"...an attack on civil society, it's an attack on our poorest and hard working families, and it's a regressive Bill that takes us back in time with cuts that will hit women and children the hardest\\"), the Liberal Democrats, the Democratic Unionist Party (Northern Ireland), Plaid Cymru and the Greens.

He claimed that removal of housing benefit for those between 18 and 25, reductions in housing benefit for people with spare bedrooms, caps on housing benefit and other changes will further add to poverty and homelessness. The July 2015 budget under the Cameron government reduced funds to help disabled people find work. For example, Jamie McCormack, who is deaf and physically disabled,Dathan, Matt (24 June 2015). \\"Police clash with disabled protesters as they try to storm House of Commons chamber during Prime Minister's Questions\\".

The Indendent (London). According to him and Anoosh Chakelian of the New Statesman, removal of 'the disability element of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)' will cause stress and hardship to many disabled people. Under Cameron's leadership, poverty is no longer classified by a family's income, but as to whether a family is in work or not. Considering that two-thirds of people who found work were accepting wages that are below the living wage (according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation), this has been criticised by anti-poverty campaigners as an unrealistic view of poverty in Britain today. Foreign policy Cameron has stated that he believes in \\"spreading freedom and democracy, and supporting humanitarian intervention\\" in cases such as the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. However, he says that he is not a neo-conservative because, as a conservative, he recognises \\"the complexities of human nature, and will always be skeptical of grand schemes to remake the world.\\" He supports multilateralism stating \\"a country may act alone ‚Äì but it cannot always succeed alone.\\" He believes multilateralism can take the form of acting through \\"NATO, the UN, the G8, the EU and other institutions\\", or through international alliances.In full: Cameron on foreign policy, BBC News Online, 11 September 2006.

Cameron has supported the alliance with the United States, viewing it as highly important. He has praised its role in the Second World War and the Cold War, about which he has said \\"Unlike some, I never had any doubts about whose side I was on\\". This was interpreted as a knock at sections of the Labour Party, some members of which had expressed support for the former Soviet Union. He has also claimed \\"we must be steadfast not slavish in how we approach the special relationship\\", arguing that \\"questioning the approach of the U.S. administration, trying to learn the lessons of the past five years, does not make you anti-American.\\" =Israel= Cameron also supports Israel, claiming that he felt \\"some sense of connection\\" to Israel due to his \\"relatively limited\\" Jewish ancestry.

With a turnout of 91.94%, an overwhelming 99.8% voted to remain a British territory with only three votes against. In light of this Cameron said: =Iraq and the War on terror= Before becoming leader, he voted in favour of the Iraq War, confirming this stance during an interview on the British TV show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross.

He has argued \\"it must be a battle of hearts and minds, as well as force\\" and that \\"the threat cannot be negotiated away or appeased ‚Äì it has to be confronted and overcome\\". =Syria= Cameron's government was critical of Bashar al-Assad's government in the Syrian Civil War stating it had \\"forfeited the right to lead\\" by \\"miring itself in the blood of innocent people\\", and backed the rebels. On 21 August 2013, immediately following a chemical-weapons attack at Ghouta, Cameron urged U.S. President Barack Obama to respond with a military intervention. However a motion to participate in military strikes against the Syrian regime was defeated in Parliament on 29 August 2013. This was the first time that a British government was blocked from taking a military action by Parliament. After the vote Cameron said: Ultimately a negotiated agreement was reached to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons. In December 2015, Cameron won support from the House of Commons for airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. = Libya = In 2011, the United Kingdom joined the NATO forces that took part in a military intervention against Libya. Hostilities ended only after the death of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Cameron supported this international action. He said it was ‚Äúright because we believe we should not stand aside while this dictator murders his own people.‚Äù When the fighting ceased in October 2011, there was a leadership vacuum in Libya and Cameron as well as the other western powers did not really exert much effort to fill this vacancy. Libya was plunged in civil war and United States President Barack Obama pointed a finger at Cameron for not helping rebuild Libya. =European Union= Immediately after his election as leader, he restated his pledge to withdraw the party's MEPs from cooperation with the European People's Party (EPP) within the European Parliament. The British Conservative Party were part of the anti-federalist European Democrats, a sub-group of the EPP-ED Group in the European Parliament, but Cameron planned for the ED to break away in order to form a new, independent grouping. Cameron aimed to set up a group more focused on the Conservative Party's views, a move that has been resisted by some Conservative MEPs and all mainstream Conservative member-parties of the EPP. After much speculation, he announced in July 2006 that Conservative MEPs would withdraw from the EPP in 2009. The stated reason for the delay was that the Conservatives' proposed future alliance partners, the Czech Civic Democratic Party, needed time to form a new domestic coalition in order to form a \\"eurorealist\\" grouping in the European Parliament.Stephen Mulvey, Q&A;: The Tories and the EPP, BBC News Online, 13 July 2006.

Cameron is currently against unilaterally withdrawing from the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy, as some on the Conservative Right have proposed.

On 1 July 2013, Cameron outlined his \\"vision of the EU is that it should be a large trading and co-operating organisation that effectively stretches, as it were, from the Atlantic to the Urals. We have a wide vision of Europe and have always encouraged countries that want to join,\\" as he welcomed the 28th member of the union (Croatia) to the fold while he spoke to Kazakh university students. The speech was characterised as a \\"hugely provocative pro-EU\\" one by some observers. Cameron \\"hailed the power of the EU to transform divided societies,\\" whereas President of Russia Vladimir Putin \\"may regard Cameron's remarks as hostile. Putin believes that the EU should extend no further into the former USSR than the Baltic states.\\" The Eastern Partnership is planned to link Europe and former Soviet states in a free trade and political accord. The Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement (UkEUAA) was rejected by President Viktor Yanukovich at a summit in Vilnius on 21 November 2013. This sparked months of protest and turmoil, and culminated with regime change in Kiev on 21 February 2014. Cameron spoke after the European Council meeting of 21 March 2014, at which the UkEUAA was finally signed by PM pro-tem Arseniy Yatseniuk, of the EU plans, under the Eastern Partnership, to \\"further strengthen the political association and economic integration with Republic of Georgia and the Republic of Moldova, (and) to sign the association agreements, including the deep and comprehensive free trade areas (DCFTAs) ... no later than June 2014.\\" On 27 June 2014, new President of the Ukraine, Poroshenko, signed in Brussels the remainder of the UkEUAA (see below for the DCFTA), while Georgia and Moldova both signed onto the Eastern Partnership. David Cameron has proposed a referendum on the UK's EU continuing membership on 23 June 2016, following negotiations and a package of changes agreed by the EU. On 24 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. =Turkey in the EU= On 9 December 2014, Cameron said that he still \\"very much supports\\" Turkey joining the European Union, during a visit to Turkey to meet the country's Prime Minister and President, despite his Government's inability to control numbers of EU migrants coming to the UK. The visit was his first since 2010 when he told the Turks he backed the country's goal of joining the EU. He had said then that he wanted to \\"make the case\\" for Turkey's EU membership, and added that he wanted to \\"pave the road\\" for Turkey to join the EU, saying the country was \\"vital for our economy, vital for our security and vital for our diplomacy\\".telegraph.co.uk: \\"David Cameron: I still want Turkey to join EU, despite migrant fears\\", 9 December 2014 =India= Cameron has been a strong advocate of increased ties between India and the United Kingdom; describing Indian ‚Äì British relations as the \\"New Special Relationship\\" in 2010. In October 2012, as Narendra Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK rescinded its boycott of the then Gujarat state Chief Minister, and in November 2013, Cameron commented that he was \\"open\\" to meeting Modi. Modi was later elected as Prime Minister in a landslide majority, leading to Cameron calling Modi and congratulating him on the \\"election success\\", one of the first Western leaders to do. = Sri Lanka = Cameron reiterated calls for an independent investigation into the alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War. \\"There needs to be proper inquiries into what happened at the end of the war, there needs to be proper human rights, democracy for the Tamil minority in that country\\" Cameron stated. He stated that, if this investigation was not completed by March 2014, he would press for an independent international inquiry. This followed a visit to Jaffna, a war-ravaged town in the northern part of Sri Lanka; Cameron was the first foreign leader to visit Jaffna since the island once colonised by Britain became independent in 1948. Cameron was mobbed by demonstrators, mostly women, seeking his assistance in tracing missing relatives. =2014 Ukrainian-Crimean crisis= On 16 March in the 2014 Crimean crisis, a referendum was held in Crimea, which resulted in a vote to join Russia. This elicited, two days later, a formal response from the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, to set in motion the machinery that had been prepared in the Russian Parliament. On 21 March, the UK government issued an unbidden rebuttal, that rehashed the Western point of view. President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted from power on 21 February by the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and replaced by Oleksandr Turchynov, the screenwriter and economist, and the Yatsenyuk Government was endorsed by the Rada. At a European Council summit in Brussels on 21 March 2014, new Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk and European Union leaders Herman Van Rompuy and Jos√© Manuel Barroso, along with the 27 national political leaders or heads of state on the Council, which included Cameron, signed the political provisions of the Ukraine‚ÄìEuropean Union Association Agreement. The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area was to be signed after the presidential election in May 2014. Constitutional issues Cameron is a Unionist although he supports devolution, admitting that the Conservatives, \\"fought against the idea of a Scottish Parliament long after it became clear that it was the settled will of the people.\\" He has also defended the Barnett formula, saying \\"Other areas within the UK are subsidised more than Scotland is.\\" Currently Scotland has a net compared to the rest of the UK. He also believes \\"unionists have to develop better arguments against independence\\", and that \\"the case for the Union isn't just economic.\\" Cameron has stated that he wants to address anti-Scottishness in England, \\"Scotland has certainly not been an occupied or oppressed country these past three hundred years but I recognise that it has not all been a triumphal procession either\\", and that, \\"the ignorance of English people about Scots and Scotland\\", has sometimes meant that Scotland does not get \\"the respect it deserves.\\"Cameron: I will never take Scotland for granted , conservatives.com, 15 September 2006, 6 November 2006Cameron warning of 'danger to UK', BBC News Online, 14 September 2006.

In the singular, the name is Al Shehhi, a common family name in the UAE and Oman today. Inhabiting the northern part of the Hajar Mountain range, specifically in the Ruus Al Jibal (Musandam Peninsula), the tribe has long been influential in the affairs of both the east and west coast settlements of the northern UAE and Oman and has fiercely maintained both its identity and independence.  Sections  The Shihuh are divided into two main sections, the Bani Hadiyah and Bani Shatair. The Bani Hadiyah splits into several subsections: the Bani Muhammad; Bani Ali; Bani Ham Mazyud and Khanazirah. The Bani Shatair splits into the Khanabil; Kumazarah; Mahabib and Maqadilah. At the turn of the 20th century, the tribe numbered some 21,500 people and was mostly settled around the Rus Al Jibal mountains, as well as Sha'am, Ghalilah, Ghubb and Khor Khwair in Ras Al Khaimah. In total, some 14,500 Shihuh had settled the coast, while 7,000 inhabited the mountainous interior, although the members of the tribe would travel seasonally between both domains. The Bani Hadiyah are mostly to be found on the western coast of the UAE, including Khasab, Oman, which would be their principal village. The Bani Shatair are centered around Kumzar, also at the tip of the peninsula.  Language and lifestyle  The Shihuh were essentially agricultural during the winter months, when they would form communities inhabiting the stone-built buildings in the mountains, channelling the available water run-off from the mountains (there are no wells in the mountains) to irrigate their stepped fields. In the warmer months, they migrated mainly to work during the date season, typically to Khasab, Dibba and the Batinah coast of Oman. They also participated in the pearl fishing season. They maintained large herds of goats, the source of rare surplus for them to trade for other commodities. Because of the nature of their frequently hand-to-mouth existence in the mountains, arable land was particularly prized, a fact which has been used to explain the predominance of Bint Amm (daughter of my uncle) marriages among the Shihuh (land forming part of the marriage dowry). The lifestyle and distinctive dialect and language of the Shihuh is markedly different to that of the desert Bedouin of the UAE and these differences led to the Shihuh being dubbed as being of non-Arab descent ‚Äì to the point where some traditions had them as of Portuguese extraction. Research has shown that the tribe incorporates elements of Iranian origin, the Kumazarah subsection speaking a dialect similar to Balochi. The Arab element of the tribe's make-up, the majority, is thought to be linked to the wave of immigration from Yemen, which brought groups of Malik bin Fahm immigrants north in the second century. Bertram Thomas described the dialect of the Kumazarah as \\"...a strange tongue which has baffled and confused strangers. It is a compound of Arabic and Persian but it is distinct from them both, and is intelligible neither to the Arab nor to the Persian nor yet to the linguist of both.\\" The unique axe of the Shihuh people, known as the Jerz, is long handled with a small head.  History  Historically, the Shihuh were difficult to govern and their principal northern villages were often secessionist, depending on the inaccessibility of the terrain they inhabited. They were frequently in conflict with the Sharqiyin of the east coast of the UAE, but would settle their differences to make common cause against the central authority represented by Sharjah when the Sharqiyin made one of their numerous attempts to shake off that yoke. The Shihuh were frequently in conflict with the Al Qasimi of both Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah and were generally more ready to accept the Suzerainty of Muscat. However, their economic needs crossed borders and Shihuh often had property or other holdings subject to Ras Al Khaimah or Sharjah. The village of Sha'am is a good example of a territory that became economically and therefore politically dependent on Ras Al Khaimah, even though its Shihuh population originated in the Rus Al Jibal and would have been considered Omani. = The battle for Rams = Sheikh Sultan bin Salim Al Qasimi took Ras Al Khaimah to full independence from Sharjah in 1921 and was determined to maintain the integrity of the emirate, despite a number of secessionist influences. One such was keenly felt at Rams where the headman, Abdelrahman bin Saleh Al Tanaiji, concluded an alliance with the Shihuh. Sultan bin Salim made a complaint to the British Agent, which yielded no effective response, and in June 1921, fighting broke out. Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum of Dubai tried to mediate in the clash, which was disrupting the pearling season (Sultan bin Salim had augmented his fighting force by bringing in all of the available pearl divers as additional troops). It was eventually the risk of loss to the Indian merchant community (British subjects) that led the British to take action to solve the dispute and, in July 1921, HMS Cyclamen arrived off Rams, where a four month truce had already been agreed between the Shihuh and Abdelrahman's brother, Muhammad, the new wali. Abdelrahman himself was dead, murdered by his cousin, Salim. The new treaty agreed that Muhammed recognised the suzerainty of Sultan bin Salim and Sultan bin Salim agreed to punish the murderer of his brother. It did not last three days until the parties fell out again and a further treaty negotiation took place with the Sheikhs of the Shihuh and the President of the Muscat Council's private secretary. This time, Muhammad and Salim were both sent into custody in Sharjah but broke out and returned to Rams with a force of Shihhu where fighting once again broke out. The final treaty, signed on 22 February 1922, broke the tie between the Shihuh and Muhammed and endured. = Shaping Dibba and Kalba = The Shihuh and their historical influence over events shaped Dibba, an eastern town which is the confluence of three borders: Sharjah and Fujairah in the UAE and Oman. The wali of Dibba in 1855 was killed by Shihuh tribesmen. Named Mashari, the man's brother was wali of Ras Al Khaimah. The pattern of rivalry between the townsfolk of Dibba and the Shihuh was established and by 1871 the depredations of the Shihuh were impacting the revenues of the town. The position of wali at Dibba being at times made almost untenable by this rivalry, in 1926 the wali signed a treaty with the Shihuh which however broke down on his death in 1932. The new wali lost no time in appealing to Muscat for protection, hoisting the Omani flag above his fort. This led the Ruler of Sharjah, Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi II, to protest to the British, who stated that Dibba was Sharjah territory. The result has been the creation of Dibba as a Sharjah town with Oman to the north and Fujairah to the south which has, as it has expanded, become a town with three Rulers. Likewise, the wali of Kalba was more or less dependent on Shihuh goodwill and influence and they played the role of 'king maker' on more than one occasion. British frustration with the wide-ranging conflicts between settled populations and the Shihuh led in 1926 to a proposal to rehouse them at Kalba - and give them control of the Shamailiyah, an area which represents the whole east coast of the present UAE (including newly independent Fujairah) and therefore reduce the clashes which were taking place between Shihuh and the local populations of the villages on the north-west coast. In the end the proposal came to nothing. See also *Nadba - A ceremonial battle cry native to the Shihuh.

Life and missionary work  Baptized with the name Mitrofan, he was the son of a priest from the Novgorod region. Trained as a military engineer,Garrett, Paul D., \\"Tryphon of Pechenga\\", Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions, (Gerald H. Anderson, ed.), Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999, he felt that he was called by God to proclaim the Gospels to the Laplanders. Though he was met with hostility from the pagans, he was effective in convincing many of them to convert to Christianity. His effectiveness is attributed to the fact that he took the time to study their beliefs and languages. With permission from Archbishop Macarius of Novgorod to found a Church of the Annunciation up north, Mitrofan was tonsured a monk with the religious name Tryphon and ordained a hieromonk. After his ordination and tonsure, Tryphon became the leader of the Holy Trinity Monastery on the banks of the Pechenga River. He continued spreading the Gospel to the residents near the river.

Saint Tryphon is relatively unknown in the greater Orthodox traditions, but achieved and maintained popularity among Orthodox Christians in the Lapland Regions.

He was well known for innovation with enamel and steel and received both local and national recognition for his work, including honorary awards, competitive prizes and commissions, along with a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1957. Cantini long served as a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh, where he helped to create the Department of Studio Arts. A longtime resident of the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Cantini died on May 2, 2009 at the age of 90. Today, many of his large scale works are on display throughout the city of Pittsburgh. Life A native of Italy, Cantini and his family emigrated to Weirton, West Virginia in the 1920s. He initially attended Manhattan College in New York before transferring to Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon) where he received a football scholarship and earned All-America status as a quarterback. His studies were interrupted by World War II, in which he served the Army making topographical maps and models in North Africa. Following the war, Cantini received a bachelor's degree in fine arts in 1946 from Carnegie Tech and married a fellow art student, Lucille Kleber. Cantini went on to earn a master's in fine arts at the University of Pittsburgh in 1948, and was granted an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Duquesne University in 1982. Cantini and his wife settled in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh where they had two daughters, Maria and Lisa, and lived for 60 years. His home on the 200 block of South Craig Street also served as his studio and gallery. Beginning in 1948, Cantini's artwork gained national exposure when his enamel \\"Masquerade\\" was juried at the 13th National Ceramic Exhibition in Syracuse, New York.

Constitution Hill is located on a hill west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Parramatta and is part of the Western Sydney region. Constitution Hill overlooks the city of Parramatta from above and contains views of the inner Sydney city skyline. History The area was originally a locality within the suburb of Wentworthville. Constitution Hill was promoted from a locality to a suburb by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales on 19 January 2007. Demographics At the 2016 census, there were 3,966 residents in Constitution Hill. 61.0% of residents were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were India 3.9%, China 3.8% and Lebanon 3.2%. 55.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Arabic 7.7%, Cantonese 3.4% and Mandarin 3.2%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 27.8%, No Religion 19.9% and Anglican 11.1%. The median weekly household income was $1,443 which was slightly below the national median of $1,486. Historical Significance Constitution Hill was one of the places that was involved in the Castle Hill convict rebellion. The mostly Irish convicts would travel from Castle Hill down modern-day Old Windsor Road and meet at Constitution Hill. The distraction they had made at Castle Hill (A fire (?)) was supposed to stretch out the government forces by allocating some men to go to Castle Hill. The convicts would then attack Parramatta (The head of the colony at that time) and take over control. The government officials had suspicion that the convicts were planning an attack on Parramatta and kept most of their forces at Parramatta, thinking that the convicts were at Toongabbie, they set out west, only to be informed that they were at Constitution Hill. When the government forces arrived at the summit of Constitution Hill (Mount Dorothy) they realised that the men had not made it that far yet and were further west at Rouse Hill.

For Tibetans in particular it is very special festive occasion. The race Each of the competitors, which commonly number 10 or 12, mounts his or her yak, and the yaks run towards the opposite end of the race course. Yak racing is also known to be performed in parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and in Pamir in Pakistan. The race attains a feverish pitch with the daredevilry of the yak rider and the yak displaying their pluck to reach the target. Yaks and their riders gather at the venue of racing from different villages of the region. Now nearly 150 yaks are entered into the race, as against 50 in the past. The race is a very colourful event with both the yak and its rider dressed in strikingly attractive clothing and decorations; the yak's head is adorned with red tassels, the horns are wrapped in colourful silk cloth, the ears are draped in ribbons and the tail is covered with cloth in fan shaped cloth with Tibetan designs. The riders and herdsmen also turn up wearing very colourful attire suitable for the occasion as lucky symbols so that their yaks could get to win the first place, The race has the same degree of risks as is involved in horse racing. The race track is nowadays of 2000 metres length in open fields and racing yaks would cover this distance in about 8 minutes. The winning yak and its rider get the adulation of the people and are treated with respect. In China Yak racing became an integral part of the Jyekundo (Yushu in Chinese) Horse Festival in 2006. It was held 20 km south of Jyekundo near the small township of Batang with over 20,000 people in attendance. For the 2007 horse festival all 6 counties of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are combining resources and financing together to provide a larger festival, called Khampa Arts Festival (Chin. Kangba Yishu Jie) in the prefecture capital of Jyekundo with an anticipated 40,000 to 50,000 people in attendance. Yak racing is also an integral part of the nineteen-day Darma Festival in Gyangze, and a comic highlight of the Damxung Horse Festival also known as the Dajyur. Yak racing is also a common sport in the farming and stockbreeding areas on the grand Tibetan Plateau of Qingzang altiplano. They hold yak racing events annually to celebrate the good harvest, and they pray for good weather during the coming year. The festival which used to be held on 25 November has been reordered as the Wangguo Festival and is held before the harvest season in August.  In Mongolia  In the northern Khangai Mountains of Mongolia, the traditional Yak Festival is held near the lake Terkhiin Tsagaan Nuur every year, on the first and second days of August.

It is in Wall Township six miles west of Belmar, east of Farmingdale. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015 categorized it as a general aviation reliever airport. Prior to 2003, it was known as Allaire Airport. The airport was sold on December 3, 2013 to a consortium known as Wall Aviation. The new owners intend to evict current renters and upgrade the facility to serve corporate clients. In an analysis by the Regional Plan Association in 2011, Monmouth Jet scored highly as a potential airport for airline flights to expand capacity and relieve aviation congestion in the New York area.  Facilities Monmouth Jet Center covers 850 acres (344 ha) at an elevation of 153 feet (47 m). It has two asphalt runways: 14/32 is 7,371 by 85 feet (2,247 x 26 m) and 3/21 is 3,512 by 50 feet (1,070 x 15 m). In the year ending January 1, 2010 the airport had 57,229 aircraft operations, average 156 per day: 83% general aviation and 17% air taxi. Incidents and accidents On February 15, 2010 a small aircraft, identified as a Cessna 337, crashed on approach to the airport, killing all five people on board. The NTSB accident report indicated that the pilot made an abrupt maneuver while exceeding the operating limitations of the aircraft which caused a structural failure of the right wing. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows: The pilots‚Äô failure to adhere to the airplane‚Äôs operating limitations, which resulted in overload failure of the right wing. Findings of the investigation were the adverse effects of multiple supplemental type certificates (STC) to the airframe wing structure that were not evaluated at the time the STCs were installed and the lack of guidance by the Federal Aviation Administration for multiple STC interaction evaluation.

Doob. Informally, the martingale convergence theorem typically refers to the result that any supermartingale satisfying a certain boundedness condition must converge. One may think of supermartingales as the random variable analogues of non-increasing sequences; from this perspective, the martingale convergence theorem is a random variable analogue of the monotone convergence theorem, which states that any bounded monotone sequence converges. There are symmetric results for submartingales, which are analogous to non-decreasing sequences. Statement for discrete-time martingales A common formulation of the martingale convergence theorem for discrete-time martingales is the following. Let X_1, X_2, X_3, \\\\dots be a supermartingale. Suppose that the supermartingale is bounded in the sense that : \\\\sup_{t \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} \\\\operatorname{E}[X_t^-] < \\\\infty where X_t^- is the negative part of X_t , defined by X_t^- = -\\\\min(X_t, 0) . Then the sequence converges almost surely to a random variable X with finite expectation. There is a symmetric statement for submartingales with bounded expectation of the positive part. A supermartingale is a stochastic analogue of a non-increasing sequence, and the condition of the theorem is analogous to the condition in the monotone convergence theorem that the sequence be bounded from below. The condition that the martingale is bounded is essential; for example, an unbiased \\\\pm 1 random walk is a martingale but does not converge. As intuition, there are two reasons why a sequence may fail to converge. It may go off to infinity, or it may oscillate. The boundedness condition prevents the former from happening. The latter is impossible by a \\"gambling\\" argument. Specifically, consider a stock market game in which at time t, the stock has price X_t . There is no strategy for buying and selling the stock over time, always holding a non- negative amount of stock, which has positive expected profit in this game. The reason is that at each time the expected change in stock price, given all past information, is at most zero (by definition of a supermartingale). But if the prices were to oscillate without converging, then there would be a strategy with positive expected profit: loosely, buy low and sell high. This argument can be made rigorous to prove the result. =Proof sketch= The proof is simplified by making the (stronger) assumption that the supermartingale is uniformly bounded; that is, there is a constant M such that X_n \\\\leq M always holds. In the event that the sequence X_1,X_2,\\\\dots does not converge, then \\\\liminf X_n and \\\\limsup X_n differ. If also the sequence is bounded, then there are some real numbers a and b such that a < b and the sequence crosses the interval [a,b] infinitely often. That is, the sequence is eventually less than a, and at a later time exceeds b, and at an even later time is less than a, and so forth ad infinitum. These periods where the sequence starts below a and later exceeds b are called \\"upcrossings\\". Consider a stock market game in which at time t, one may buy or sell shares of the stock at price X_t . On the one hand, it can be shown from the definition of a supermartingale that for any N \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N} there is no strategy which maintains a non-negative amount of stock and has positive expected profit after playing this game for N steps. On the other hand, if the prices cross a fixed interval [a,b] very often, then the following strategy seems to do well: buy the stock when the price drops below a, and sell it when the price exceeds b. Indeed, if u_N is the number of upcrossings in the sequence by time N, then the profit at time N is at least (b-a)u_N - 2M: each upcrossing provides at least b-a profit, and if the last action was a \\"buy\\", then in the worst case the buying price was a \\\\leq M and the current price is -M . But any strategy has expected profit at most 0, so necessarily : \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\big[u_N\\\\big] \\\\leq \\\\frac{2M}{b-a}. By the monotone convergence theorem for expectations, this means that : \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\big[\\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} u_N \\\\big]\\\\leq \\\\frac{2M}{b-a} , so the expected number of upcrossings in the whole sequence is finite. It follows that the infinite-crossing event for interval [a,b] occurs with probability 0. By a union bound over all rational a and b, with probability 1, no interval exists which is crossed infinitely often. If for all a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Q} there are finitely many upcrossings of interval [a,b] , then the limit inferior and limit superior of the sequence must agree, so the sequence must converge. This shows that the martingale converges with probability 1. =Failure of convergence in mean= Under the conditions of the martingale convergence theorem given above, it is not necessarily true that the supermartingale (X_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} converges in mean (i.e. that \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\operatorname{E}[X_n - X] = 0 ). As an example; , let (X_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} be a \\\\pm 1 random walk with X_0 = 1. Let N be the first time when X_n = 0, and let (Y_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} be the stochastic process defined by Y_n := X_{\\\\min(N, n)}. Then N is a stopping time with respect to the martingale (X_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}}, so (Y_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} is also a martingale, referred to as a stopped martingale. In particular, (Y_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} is a supermartingale which is bounded below, so by the martingale convergence theorem it converges pointwise almost surely to a random variable Y. But if Y_n > 0 then Y_{n+1} = Y_n \\\\pm 1, so Y is almost surely zero. This means that \\\\operatorname{E}[Y] = 0 . However, \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_n] = 1 for every n \\\\geq 1, since (Y_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} is a random walk which starts at 1 and subsequently makes mean- zero moves (alternately, note that \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_n] = \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_0] = 1 since (Y_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} is a martingale). Therefore (Y_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} cannot converge to Y in mean. Moreover, if (Y_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} were to converge in mean to any random variable R , then some subsequence converges to R almost surely. So by the above argument R = 0 almost surely, which contradicts convergence in mean. Statements for the general case In the following, (\\\\Omega, F, F_*, \\\\mathbf{P}) will be a filtered probability space where F_* = (F_t)_{t \\\\geq 0} , and N: [0,\\\\infty) \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R} will be a right- continuous supermartingale with respect to the filtration F_* ; in other words, for all 0 \\\\leq s \\\\leq t < +\\\\infty , :N_s \\\\geq \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\big[ N_t \\\\mid F_s \\\\big]. =Doob's first martingale convergence theorem= Doob's first martingale convergence theorem provides a sufficient condition for the random variables N_t to have a limit as t\\\\to+\\\\infty in a pointwise sense, i.e. for each \\\\omega in the sample space \\\\Omega individually. For t\\\\geq 0, let N_t^- = \\\\max(-N_t,0) and suppose that :\\\\sup_{t > 0} \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\big[ N_t^{-} \\\\big] < \\\\+ \\\\infty. Then the pointwise limit :N(\\\\omega) = \\\\lim_{t \\\\to + \\\\infty} N_t (\\\\omega) exists and is finite for \\\\mathbf{P}-almost all \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega. =Doob's second martingale convergence theorem= It is important to note that the convergence in Doob's first martingale convergence theorem is pointwise, not uniform, and is unrelated to convergence in mean square, or indeed in any Lp space. In order to obtain convergence in L1 (i.e., convergence in mean), one requires uniform integrability of the random variables N_t. By Chebyshev's inequality, convergence in L1 implies convergence in probability and convergence in distribution. The following are equivalent: * (N_t)_{t>0} is uniformly integrable, i.e. ::\\\\lim_{C \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sup_{t > 0} \\\\int_{\\\\\\\\{ \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\, \\\\mid \\\\, N_t (\\\\omega) > C \\\\\\\\}} \\\\left N_t (\\\\omega) \\\\right \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{P} (\\\\omega) = 0; * there exists an integrable random variable N \\\\in L^1(\\\\Omega,\\\\mathbf{P};\\\\mathbf{R}) such that N_t \\\\to N as t\\\\to\\\\infty both \\\\mathbf{P}-almost surely and in L^1(\\\\Omega,\\\\mathbf{P};\\\\mathbf{R}), i.e. ::\\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\left N_t - N \\\\right \\\\right] = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\left N_t (\\\\omega) - N (\\\\omega) \\\\right \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{P} (\\\\omega) \\\\to 0 \\\\text{ as } t \\\\to + \\\\infty. Doob's upcrossing inequality The following result, called Doob's upcrossing inequality or, sometimes, Doob's upcrossing lemma, is used in proving Doob's martingale convergence theorems. A \\"gambling\\" argument shows that for uniformly bounded supermartingales, the number of upcrossings is bounded; the upcrossing lemma generalizes this argument to supermartingales with bounded expectation of their negative parts. Let N be a natural number. Let (X_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} be a supermartingale with respect to a filtration (\\\\mathcal{F}_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}}. Let a, b be two real numbers with a < b. Define the random variables (U_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} so that U_n is the maximum number of disjoint intervals [n_{i_1}, n_{i_2}] with n_{i_2} \\\\leq n , such that X_{n_{i_1}} < a < b < X_{n_{i_2}} . These are called upcrossings with respect to interval [a,b] . Then : (b - a) \\\\operatorname{E}[U_n] \\\\le \\\\operatorname{E}[(X_n - a)^-].\\\\quad where X^- is the negative part of X , defined by X^- = -\\\\min(X, 0) . Applications =Convergence in Lp= Let M:[0,\\\\infty) \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R} be a continuous martingale such that :\\\\sup_{t > 0} \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\big[ \\\\big M_t \\\\big^p \\\\big] < \\\\+ \\\\infty for some p>1. Then there exists a random variable M \\\\in L^p(\\\\Omega,\\\\mathbf{P};\\\\mathbf{R}) such that M_t \\\\to M as t\\\\to +\\\\infty both \\\\mathbf{P}-almost surely and in L^p(\\\\Omega,\\\\mathbf{P};\\\\mathbf{R}). The statement for discrete-time martingales is essentially identical, with the obvious difference that the continuity assumption is no longer necessary. = L√©vy's zero‚Äìone law= Doob's martingale convergence theorems imply that conditional expectations also have a convergence property. Let (\\\\Omega,F,\\\\mathbf{P}) be a probability space and let X be a random variable in L^1. Let F_* = (F_k)_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} be any filtration of F, and define F_\\\\infty to be the minimal œÉ-algebra generated by (F_k)_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}}. Then :\\\\operatorname{E} \\\\big[ X \\\\mid F_k \\\\big] \\\\to \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\big[ X \\\\mid F_\\\\infty \\\\big] \\\\text{ as } k \\\\to \\\\infty both \\\\mathbf{P}-almost surely and in L^1. This result is usually called L√©vy's zero‚Äìone law or Levy's upwards theorem. The reason for the name is that if A is an event in F_\\\\infty, then the theorem says that \\\\mathbf{P}[ A \\\\mid F_k ] \\\\to \\\\mathbf{1}_A almost surely, i.e., the limit of the probabilities is 0 or 1. In plain language, if we are learning gradually all the information that determines the outcome of an event, then we will become gradually certain what the outcome will be. This sounds almost like a tautology, but the result is still non-trivial. For instance, it easily implies Kolmogorov's zero‚Äìone law, since it says that for any tail event A, we must have \\\\mathbf{P}[ A ] = \\\\mathbf{1}_A almost surely, hence \\\\mathbf{P}[ A ] \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} . Similarly we have the Levy's downwards theorem : Let (\\\\Omega,F,\\\\mathbf{P}) be a probability space and let X be a random variable in L^1. Let (F_k)_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}} be any decreasing sequence of sub-sigma algebras of F, and define F_\\\\infty to be the intersection. Then :\\\\operatorname{E} \\\\big[ X \\\\mid F_k \\\\big] \\\\to \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\big[ X \\\\mid F_\\\\infty \\\\big] \\\\text{ as } k \\\\to \\\\infty both \\\\mathbf{P}-almost surely and in L^1.

History The paper was established in 1972 in Halesowen, by the founding editor Harry Taylor, and his co-partners Derek Beasley and David James. The trio had previously worked together on a free local paper, with Taylor editing the paper and writing the majority of the editorial, and Beasley and James selling adverts, as was the case in the early years of the Black Country Bugle. Taylor wrote in the launch issue in April 1972, \\"The Bugle will show you fascinating glimpses of our region's history, bring to vivid life its legendary characters, trace its antiquity and your ancestry over the centuries\\". The Black Country Bugle moved its headquarters from Halesowen to Amblecote in 1983, and then in 1989 to High Street, Cradley Heath. In April 2015, the title moved to new offices within the Dudley Archives and Local History Centre on Tipton Road in Dudley. The publication, initially produced on a monthly basis, became a weekly in 1998, and in 2001 became part of Staffordshire Newspapers. Since 2012 the title has been part of Local World. Rob Taylor, the son of Harry Taylor, the founder of the Bugle, took over as editor in 1993. The 1000th edition of the paper was published in October 2011. In 2012, Local World acquired owner Iliffe News & Media from Yattendon Group. In April 2013, John Butterworth MBE was appointed editor of the publication. Gary Phelps became editor-in-chief in July 2016. Charlotte Hart became executive editor in May 2018. Format and appearance The paper is printed in a tabloid format, and since January 2012 has been printed in full colour on an improved quality paper stock, though the nostalgic nature of its content means that many of the photographs supplied are black and white. Content Although the paper concentrates on the Black Country of former years, focusing on the local history and culture of the region, a certain amount of up-to-date local news is included. Amongst other things, the paper features photographs sent in by the public, curious objects brought into the Bugle office, short stories, anecdotes of olden days, historical essays, and letters and appeals from people researching their family trees. It often features articles and poems written in the Black Country dialect.

According to Gregory of Tours, Chlodoric murdered his own father in order to take his kingdom, acting upon the instigation of Clovis I, a rival king of the Salian Franks. Sometime after Sigobert's victory on the Visigoths in 507, Chlodoric sent assassins upon him as his father took a sojourn in a nearby forest. Chlodoric then told Clovis of the murder and offered him the finest treasures of his newly inherited kingdom as a symbol of their new alliance. Clovis sent messengers to assess the treasure, who then asked Chlodoric to plunge his hand as deeply into his gold coins as possible. With his arm submerged, the envoys of Clovis then killed the new king in betrayal. Clovis then stood before the people of Chlodoric and told them that the son had sent assassins to murder his father, but that Chlodoric had subsequently met his own end as well. Clovis then offered his protection to the former subjects of Sigobert and Chlodoric, and thus became their king.Howorth, H.H., \\"The Ethnology of Germany\\", The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 13, Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, 1884, p. 235 Gregory suggests that Chlodoric was murdered in the same campaign that also killed the Frankish king Chararic. Before, Clovis had killed king Ragnachar and his brothers. After all these murders, Gregory tells us, Clovis lamented that he had no family left anymore, implying that amongst his own casualties were close relatives. References *Gregory of Tours.

The generator facility at Prutz produces 620 million kilowatt hours per year. The lake surface is at an altitude of . The main town in the valley is Kauns (1050 m), located near the Inn river, with its Schranz Chapel containing the Kauner Kreuz. The Kaunertal Glacier Road continues up to the Wei√üenseeferner glacier. This toll road is the fifth highest paved road in the Alps and reaches an elevation of 2750 m (9025 ft). With 29 180-degree turns, the road leads all the way to the base of the ski area at . The main source of income is this glacier ski area with slopes and 10 lifts, which was opened in 1982. Due to the ski area's elevation of , and the glacier, it is operational from mid-October to mid-June. The ruins of the thirteenth-century Bernegg Castle with its Gothic chapel are also located in the valley.

At various times it has also been known as The Ancient Druid Order, An Druidh Uileach Braithreachas, and The British Circle of the Universal Bond. Initiated members are called companions.  Activity  Meditation is a key activity. Druidic discussions typically cover personal experience as well as philosophical, biological, mythological, political, poetic, astrological, religious, and similar subjects. Direct experience is more important than learning acquired through books.  Public ceremonies  For well over a century, The Druid Order has held Public Ceremonies. One at the Autumn Equinox, one at the Spring Equinox, and one at Summer Solstice. Sometimes the location or time varies due to current circumstance.British Druids at Primrose Hill - Mr. Danport The first public ceremony of the year, the Autumn Equinox, takes place on Primrose Hill in London.Autumn Equinox ceremony pictures The second ceremony of the year, the Winter Solstice, passes without a public ceremony. The third ceremony of the year, the Spring Equinox, is held at Tower Hill in London.Ceremony at Spring Equinox The fourth and final public ceremony of the year is the Summer solstice. This event is marked by three ceremonies at Stonehenge in Wiltshire: a simple ceremony at midnight for the darkest hour, a dawn ceremony marking the rising of the Sun behind the Heel Stone, and a ceremony at noon for the fullness of the light. In recent years these ceremonies have taken place on the night and day following the 'open access' to Stonehenge on Summer Solstice itself.Druids at Stonehenge Druids at Tower Hill The public ceremonies above are, obviously, open to all. Companions of the order dress in white robes and wear a cowl. They process to the place of the ceremony and form a circle with key positions oriented to the cardinal points and the Sun. Most of the ceremonies feature banners, a sword bearer leading the procession, three ladies bearing items in some way related to the season, the blowing of a horn, the reading of a scroll, representations of the elements Earth, Air, Water and Fire, wine or cider, an invocation to East, West, North and South, and words.  History  Ronald Hutton writes that the Druid Order in its current form started around 1909 or 1912 when George Watson MacGregor Reid (1862?-1946) led the group, influenced by universalists.The Druids: A History, (2007), When Thomas Maughan (1901‚Äì1976), who practised homeopathy, was elected chief in 1964, some senior members and the Order's Maenarch (Chairman) Ross Nichols (1902‚Äì1975) left to form the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. Nichols wrote that MacGregor Reid told of a history in which John Toland, on the day of the Autumn Equinox 1716 at Primrose Hill, (where began the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards), called for Druids to meet at the Apple Tree Tavern, Covent Garden, London a year and a day later, and that the meeting which formed An Druidh Uileach Braithreachas i.e. The Druid Circle of the Universal Bond took place on 22 September 1717 with representatives from London, York, Oxford, Wales, Cornwall, The Isle of Man, Scotland, Anglesey, Ireland and Brittany.Nichols, Ross, The Book of Druidry, pp76-113, Thorsons, 1992 It was also claimed that John Aubrey, the seventeenth-century antiquarian, revitalised the Mount Haemus Grove, founded in Oxford in 1245. The claim of Toland and Aubrey as members of any druid order is thought now to be unlikely from a historical perspective. Hutton suggests any lineage prior to George Watson MacGregor Reid is a legendary aspect of the order's origins.Hutton, Ronald, Blood and Mistletoe: A History of the Druids in Britain, Yale, 2009 Chief Druids *George Watson MacGregor-Reid, 1909-1946 *Robert MacGregor-Reid, 1946-1964 *Thomas Lackenby Maughan, 1964-1976 *Christopher Sullivan, 1976-1981 *David Loxley, 1981‚Äìpresent References External links *The Druid Order Category:Neo- druid orders Category:Neopagan organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:1909 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"The Druid Order"},{"id":"12261182","text":"Kent Pullen (May 4, 1942 ‚Äì April 14, 2003) was a Washington state politician in the Republican party.

Geography The municipal area is situated in a high valley of the √ñtztal Alps north of the Alpine crest, at an altitude of . It is located about south of the district capital Landeck, on the road that leads from Pfunds in the Inntal valley via the narrow Finsterm√ºnz Gorge up to Reschen Pass and the border with the Vinschgau region in South Tyrol, Italy. Nearby is the tripoint with the Swiss border; in the west, a road leads into the Sesvenna Alps and to Martina in the Lower Engadin valley. =Climate= History Naudersberg Castle In ancient times, the trade route across Reschen Pass was part of the Roman Via Claudia Augusta, leading from Italy across the Eastern Alps to the Raetian capital Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). Nauders is probably located at the site of a mansio called Inutrium in contemporary sources. From 200 AD onwards, however, the significance of the road connection faded, when it was gradually superseded by the Brenner Pass road in the east. The Nudres parish itself was first mentioned in an 1150 deed; from the 13th century it housed an important customs station. Over the centuries, numerous conflicts arose in the border area of the Tyrolean lands, held by the Austrian House of Habsburg from 1363, with the Swiss Confederacy, culminating in the Swabian War of 1499. Nauders, then part of the Tyrolean Vinschgau region in the south was administrated from Naudersberg Castle, a medieval fortress erected in the early 14th century. In 1472 the Habsburg archduke Sigismund of Austria had the Finsterm√ºnz fortress erected in the narrow gorge of the Inn river. Finsterm√ºnz Finsterm√ºnz finally lost its function when a new mountain road up to the Nauders high valley was laid out according to plans by Karl von Ghega in 1854. The Austrian authorities had the Hochfinsterm√ºnz Fortress erected on the new road into the Inntal valley instead, modelled on Franzensfeste Fortress and the federal fortress in Rastatt and manned by k.k. Landessch√ºtzen detachments. At the end of World War II, numerous Nazi officials such as Eduard Roschmann and Oswald Menghin fled on a ratline through Nauders and Reschen Pass to escape arrest.

Located at the mouth of the Kauner valley on the upper Inn, it is 10 km south of the city of Landeck and 36 km north of Reschen Pass, that forms the border to Italy. The border to Switzerland is located 23 km away towards the south-west. History Prutz, situated on the former Via Claudia Augusta, was a resting place and later post station from Carolingian times, with favourable opportunities for the development of a settlement. The place is first recorded in 1027‚Äì1034 as locus qui dicitur Bruttes (\\"the place called Bruttes\\") in relation to a dispute over tithes between the bishops' churches of Brixen and Regensburg. The Late Gothic parish church was refurbished in the Baroque style in the 17th century. In 1903 a disastrous fire destroyed the greater part of the village, although the typical West Tyrolean layout of close housing still remains in the centre. Prutz was originally administratively part of Ried im Oberinntal, which was dissolved as an administrative unit in 1978, when Prutz became part of Landeck. Geography Prutz is situated at the intersection of the rivers Inn and Faggenbach. The recreation area and nature park Kaunergrat is located at the east of the village. The skiing resort Serfaus-Fiss-Ladis is located to the west of the village. Prutz is located on the cycling route Via Claudia Augusta. Climate Demographics The population of Prutz was declining in the second half of the 19th century inter alia because of the emigration to the Americas at this period but started to grow steadily from 1910 onwards. As of 2013, 12% of the total population were of foreign nationality. The foreign population was divided as such: 43% of the foreigners were EU citizens, 28% were Turkish citizens, 20% were from countries of former Yugoslavia and some 9% were of other nationalities. Evolution of the population can be seen in the table below. Economy and Infrastructure One of the biggest hydroelectric power plants of Austria is located in Prutz and operated by Tiroler Wasserkraft. The hydro-power plant is linked by a 14.8 km long pipe to the Gepatschspeicher (Gepatsch Reservoir), which was constructed in 1964. Average electricity production per year is 661 GWh. Many of the neighbouring communities are major tourist resorts, whereas Prutz is home to a number of small businesses that serve the surrounding area. The village is home to one of Austrias biggest sledge production plants. Several agricultural fields are located in the village including an apricot plantation that serves a distillery. The village also claims the highest located winery of Austria. Culture and Sights The local football club, SV Prutz, hosts an annual musical festival on the pentecost weekend where often nationally recognized artists are performing. Other clubs that are active in the village include an orchestra group, the voluntary firebrigade, a shooting club, the distiller association and a carnival group. In 1212 a special fountain was discovered that is called Saurbrunn Quelle today. The water from the fountain contains iron, calcium, magnesium and sulfur and is of carbonic nature. It is known for its special healing character. The village has build a resting place around the fountain where the water is made available to the public free of charge. Other main sights in the village include: * The parish church of the Ascension of the Virgin Mary (Pfarrkirche Mari√§ Himmelfahrt), with Chapel of St Anthony, graveyard with two chapels and adjoining priest's house * Kaltenbrunner Chapel at the southern end of the village * Lourdes Chapel and Calvary in Entbruck * Tullen Chapel to the south-west of the old Inntal road * Wiesele, a former hermitage on a wooded mountain slope * Late Gothic houses in the village centre, and two outlying towers * Pontlatz bridge, an iron parallel bridge of 1899 Transportation Innsbruck Airport is the closest available airport and is located 80 km away from Prutz.

When, in the mid-14th century, the Venetian Senate established a public holiday for Mary Magdalene's feast, it was decided to enlarge the church, including a watchtower which was turned into a bell tower. The church was restored in the early 18th century, but in 1780 it was entirely rebuilt under design by Tommaso Temanza, with a circular plan inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The bell tower was demolished in 1888. The most notable feature is the portal, with masonic symbols over the door (probably connected to the Balbo's membership in the Knights Templar).

Along with his friend, Tom Krommendijk, a Feyenoord Rotterdam player on loan at Cercle with a similar reputation, they were often found together enjoying the nightlife in Brugge and Amsterdam. He was invited by Colourful 11 founder Sonny Hasnoe to be part of the team travelling to Suriname to play in the \\"Boxel Kleurrijk Tournament\\" against three Surinamese teams. On 7 June 1989 Surinam Airways Flight PY764 crashed during approach to Paramaribo-Zanderij International Airport, killing 176 of the 187 passengers on board, including Joemankhan, making it the worst ever aviation disaster in Suriname's history. Among those killed were 15 members of the 18-member Colourful 11 contingent. Tom Krommendijk returned to Feyenoord for the 1989-90 season, but was sent on loan to FC Twente for the following season. He would never play for Twente: on 25 August 1990 he was killed when his car collided with a tree, over a year after Joemankhan's death.

Designed by the Waco Aircraft Company, flight testing began in May 1942, and eventually more than 13,900 CG-4As were delivered. Design and development The CG-4A was constructed of fabric- covered wood and metal and was crewed by a pilot and copilot. It had two fixed mainwheels and a tailwheel. The CG-4A could carry 13 troops and their equipment. Cargo loads could be a -ton truck (i.e. a Jeep), a 75 mm howitzer, or a -ton trailer, loaded through the upward-hinged nose section. C-47s were usually used as tow aircraft. A few C-46 tugs were used during and after Operation Plunder. The USAAF CG-4A tow line was nylon, 350 feet (107 m) long. The CG-4A pickup line was inch (24 mm) diameter nylon, but only 225 ft (69 m) long including the doubled loop.

One night- shift worker in the Wicks Aircraft Company factory in Kansas City wrote, Operational history During Operation Market-Garden, Waco gliders are lined up on an English airfield in preparation for the next lift to the Netherlands. German troops examine an abandoned Waco, Normandy, June 1944 Sedalia Glider Base was originally activated on 6 August 1942. In November 1942 the installation became Sedalia Army Air Field, (after the war would be renamed Whiteman Air Force Base) and was assigned to the 12th Troop Carrier Command of the United States Army Air Forces. The field served as a training site for glider pilots and paratroopers. Assigned aircraft included the CG-4A glider, Curtiss C-46 Commando, and Douglas C-47 Skytrain. The C-46 was not used as a glider tug in combat, however, until Operation Plunder (the crossing of the Rhine) in March 1945. CG-4As went into operation in July 1943 during the Allied invasion of Sicily. They were flown 450 miles across the Mediterranean from North Africa for the night-time assaults such as Operation Ladbroke. Inexperience and poor conditions contributed to the heavy losses. They participated in the American airborne landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944, and in other important airborne operations in Europe and in the China Burma India Theater. Although not the intention of the Army Air Forces, gliders were generally considered expendable by high-ranking European theater officers and combat personnel and were abandoned or destroyed after landing. While equipment and methods for extracting flyable gliders were developed and delivered to Europe, half of that equipment was rendered unavailable by certain higher-ranked officers. Despite this lack of support for the recovery system, several gliders were recovered from Normandy and even more from Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands and Wesel, Germany. The CG-4A found favor where its small size was a benefit. The larger British Airspeed Horsa could carry more troopers (seating for 28 or a jeep or an anti-tank gun), and the British General Aircraft Hamilcar could carry 7 tons (enough for a light tank), but the CG-4A could land in smaller spaces. In addition, by using a fairly simple grapple system, an in-flight C-47 equipped with a tail hook and rope braking drum could \\"pick up\\" a CG-4A waiting on the ground.\\"Silent Partner of the Plane.\\" Popular Science, February 1944, p. 98.

The CG-4A was also used to send supplies to partisans in Yugoslavia. After World War II ended, most of the remaining CG-4As were declared surplus and almost all were sold. Many were bought for the wood in the large shipping boxes. Others were bought for conversion to towed camping homes with the wing and tail end cut off and being towed by the rear section and others sold for hunting cabins and lake side vacation cabins. The last known use of the CG-4A was in the early 1950s by the USAF with an Arctic detachment aiding scientific research. The CG-4As were used for getting personnel down to, and up from, floating ice floes, with the glider being towed out, released for landing, and then picked up later by the same type of aircraft, using the hook and line method developed during World War II. The only modification to the CG-4A was the fitting of wide skis in place of the landing gear for landing on the Arctic ice floes.\\"Ice Cube Airport.\\" Popular Mechanics, September 1952, p. 137.

He was a military leader under Prince Sigismund B√°thory. After the latter's third and final abdication in 1601, Transylvania was controlled by the mercenaries of Habsburg general Giorgio Basta. In April 1603, Sz√©kely instigated the native Transylvanian forces to rebel and, with the support of Turkish-Tartarian auxiliary forces, routed Basta's troops. On 8 May 1603, Sz√©kely claimed the title of a Prince of Transylvania, but his rule proved unstable, as his Tartarian mercenaries outdid Basta's troops in cruelty and Radu »òerban, the new Voivode of Wallachia attacked as an ally of the Habsburgs. M√≥zes' own kinsmen, the Sz√©kely, joined forces with the invaders, who defeated and killed M√≥zes in the Battle of Bra»ôov on 17 July 1603. Radu withdrew to Wallachia, making way for a return of Basta's mercenaries. Sz√©kely was the only Sz√©kely monarch of the Transylvanian Principality.  Early life  Moses Sz√©kely was born in Sz√©kelyudvarhely (now Odorheiu Secuiesc in Romania) around 1553. His father, J√°nos Liter√°ti Sz√©kely, was a Sz√©kely nobleman (or primipilus). His mother is unknown. Moses had three brothers, Istv√°n, J√°nos and P√©ter. John Sigismund Z√°polya, who ruled the eastern territories of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary as vassal of the Ottoman Empire, made J√°nos Liter√°ti the isp√°n (or head) of the chamber of salt in 1568. According to the Transylvanian historian, Istv√°n Szamosk√∂zy, Moses traded in salt in his youth. After John Sigismund converted to Unitarianism in the late 1560s, Moses was one of the many Sz√©kely noblemen who also adopted the Anti-Trinitarian doctrine.  Career  After the death of John Sigismund, the Diet of Transylvania elected Stephen B√°thory voivode (or ruler) on 25 May 1571. B√°thory's opponent, G√°sp√°r Bekes, invaded Transylvania from Royal Hungary in summer 1575. Bekes was Unitarian, but Moses Sz√©kely supported the Catholic B√°thory, along with other prominent Unitarian noblemen. He swam over the Maros River at Radn√≥t (now Iernut in Romania) with a sword in his mouth and killed one of Bekes's warriors in a duel. His bravery was noticed by B√°thory who made him the commander of his Sz√©kely guards. Moses Sz√©kely was the first to lead an attack against Bekes's army in the decisive Battle of Kerel≈ëszentp√°l, which ended with B√°thory's triumph on 8 July. Stephen B√°thory was elected ruler of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth on 15 December 1575. Moses accompanied B√°thory to Poland. He was one of the commanders of the infantry during the siege of Danzig in 1577. He was injured on his knee during the siege of Polotsk in August 1579. He also participated in the siege of Pskov in 1581. However, he had to leave the army after he cut the ear of a Hungarian nobleman in a duel. Moses was made the isp√°n of the salt mine at Fels≈ës√≥falva (now Ocna de Sus in Romania) in 1582 or 1583. Before long, the royal estates at Sim√©nfalva and L√∂v√©te in the Principality of Transylvania (now »òimone»ôti and Lueta in Romania) were granted to him. His manor house was built in Sim√©nfalva. Moses married in late December 1584, but his wife died in the following year. Historian Luk√°cs S√°ndor Szekeres says that his wife is unknown, but Judit Balogh associates her with Elisabeth Bodoni, a daughter of the captain of Udvarhelysz√©k. Moses was mentioned as isp√°n for the last time on 5 February 1591, but he may have retained this office until 1594 or 1595, according to Szekeres. The Serbs who lived in the Teme≈üvar Eyalet rose up against the Ottomans and sought assistance from Sigismund B√°thory, Prince of Transylvania. B√°thory dispatched Moses at the head of a small army to assist them. By the time the Transylvanian troops crossed the border in June 1594, the Ottomans defeated the Serbs. According to historian Judit Balogh, the Serbs' revolt fell because of the delay of the Transylvanian army. Moses laid siege to the fortress of Facs√°d (now FƒÉget in Romania) without awaiting the arrival of the infantry. The Transylvanian cavalry could not break into the fortress and Moses was injured which forced him to lift the siege on 30 November. Moses never made a full recovery from the injury and he remained lame for the rest of his life. Moses participated in the war against the Ottomans in Wallachia in June 1595. Before long, he joined Gy√∂rgy Borb√©ly, Ban of Kar√°nsebes, who launched an invasion against the Ottoman Empire in late summer. The Transylvanian army captured at least six fortresses along the Maros River before the end of the year. There is no record of his activities during the following years, showing that he gave up his public career for a while. He wanted to prevent the commoners of Bikafalva (now TƒÉureni in Romania) from turning their pigs loose in his forests to fill and fatten themselves on acorn, but the Court of Udvarhelysz√©k made a judgement against him in October 1569. At the request of Sigismund B√°thory, Moses exchanged his estates in V√°g√°s (now TƒÉietura in Romania) for the prince's estate at Libaton in March 1598.  Anarchy  Sigismund B√°thory abdicated and transferred Transylvania to the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II, on 23 March 1598. Rudolph nominated three imperial commissioners to take charge of the government of Transylvania. Moses Sz√©kely started negotiations with one of the commissioners, Bartholomeus Pezzen, in Brass√≥ (now Bra»ôov in Romania) in June, urging the emperor to send an army to Transylvania before the Ottomans invade the principality. After accepting the suzerainty of Rudolph II, Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, asked the emperor to send Moses Sz√©kely to him to take charge of the command of the Wallachian army. Moses started secret negotiations with Sigismund B√°thory's uncle, Istv√°n Bocskai, about the restoration of B√°thory. After Sigismund returned to Kolozsv√°r on 21 August 1598, Moses persuaded the Sz√©kely warriors to swear fealty to Sigismund in Sz√°szsebes (now Sebe»ô in Romania). B√°thory sent Moses Sz√©kely and Istv√°n Cs√°ky at the head of an army against V√°rad (now Oradea in Romania), because its captain refused to do homage to him. Before their arrival, an Ottoman army laid siege to V√°rad. Moses and his Sz√©kely warriors routed a band of Ottoman and Tatar marauders near the town, and the Ottoman army withdrew from the principality. Sigismund B√°thory again renounced Transylvania on 21 March 1599, but on this occasion in favor of his cousin, Andrew B√°thory. Rudolph II persuaded Michael the Brave to invade Transylvania. Thousands of Sz√©kely commoners joined Michael the Brave who had promised them to restore their liberties in autumn. Andrew B√°thory sent Moses Sz√©kely to negotiate with Michael the Brave, but the latter refused to make peace. Moses was the supreme commander of B√°thory's army in the Battle of Sellenberk. After the battle was lost, Moses Sz√©kely sought shelter in the fortress of G√∂rg√©ny (now Gurghiu in Romania) on 29 October 1599. Andrew B√°thory, who tried to flee to Poland, was murdered by Sz√©kely commoners on 3 November. Rudolph II made Michael the Brave his governor in Transylvania. After Michael appointed him the supreme commander of the Transylvanian army, Moses Sz√©kely joined him in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, but he had left his wife in Marosv√°s√°rhely (now T√¢rgu Mure»ô in Romania) in the custody of her father. Before long, Michael the Brave granted Teke and Mez≈ëszilv√°s (now Teaca and Siliva»ôu de C√¢mpie in Romania), and other estates in Kolozs County to Moses and his son. On 24 January 1600, Michael the Brave issued a new charter, confirming the possessions that Moses had seized in Transylvania during the rule of the B√°thorys. On the other hand, the voivode who did not trust Moses always asked Rudolph's envoys not to talk about confidential issues if Moses was also attained their meeting. Michael the Brave invaded Moldavia in May 1600. Moses, who had been made captain of Udvarhelysz√©k, was one of the commanders of Michael's troops. After Michael returned to Transylvania, Moses stayed behind in Moldavia to command the voivode's army along with a Wallachian boyar, Mirza. Michael could not stabilize his rule in Transylvania, although he forced more than a dozen Transylvanian noblemen to move to Wallachia. Moses Sz√©kely returned to Transylvania in late summer 1600 to meet G√°sp√°r Sibrik, Gy√∂rgy Mak√≥ and other Transylvanian noblemen in Burzenland. Michael the Brave summoned them to the Diet to Gyulafeh√©rv√°r in late August, but Moses and his allies fled to Poland to convince Sigismund B√°thory to again lay claim to Transylvania.  Family  Moses's elder son, Stephen, was only mentioned in Michael the Brave's charter on 1 December 1599, which shows that he died in infancy. His younger son, Moses the Younger was born after his death.  References   Sources     Further reading * Magyarorsz√°g t√∂rt√©nete 1526-1686.

History It was founded in the early 8th century, allegedly by St. Magnus of Oderzo; in the following century, under doge Pietro III Candiano, it was rebuilt to house the alleged relics of St. John the Baptist, to whom it is entitled, and again in 1178. Pietro Barbo, future Pope Paul II, and Antonio Vivaldi were baptised in the church. The current appearance dates from the last renovation (1475-1505), which kept the basilica plan but added a brickwork fa√ßade in local late-Gothic style, and a fa√ßade divided into three sections. The interior houses works by Cima da Conegliano (Baptism of Christ, 1492 and St. Helena and Constantine at the Cross, 1501-1503) and Alvise Vivarini and has a trussed ceiling. The origin of the term Bragora is unclear. It could derive from the Greek agor√† (square), referring to the campo facing the church, or from the dialect bragora (\\"market\\") or bragolare (\\"fishing\\"). It could also be from the word brago, meaning mud, on account of the former swampy state of islands of Venice. It is the church where Antonio Vivaldi was baptised in 1678. It is thought his family lived close to the church at the time.

After he leaves, she reveals to Akshay that she killed her husband and confides in him. He joins her in disposing of the corpse in an abandoned well by her estate. The story goes into a flashback with Sudha narrating to Akshay the reason she killed him, shown in a series of broken sequences. Kumar, who suffers from schizophrenia is suspicious of his wife's fidelity and is unable to make love to her. He hallucinates scenes of her making love to her male friends, among who is Shashidhar, a friend who she meets often.

He is taken away to a secluded location where he is tortured by unknown assailants for information regarding the structural details of a bank that he helped build. When the torture reaches excruciating levels, the architect gives in and shares the confidential details of the security alarms and safety devices in the bank. It is shown that the leader of the group called Devraj (B. C. Patil) is a terrorist and will stop at nothing to get the bank's money to further his group's operations. It is also shown that he commands a strong team of at least 20 deadly terrorists. The following morning, the scene opens at Bangalore's Manipal center, the place of the bank that Dev and his associates have planned to rob. It is a normal day, the staff slowly trickle in, and business resumes. Meanwhile, a van that enters into the building, unloads a bunch of carton boxes marked to be delivered to the bank. The boxes are then transferred slowly to the bank premises. Unknown to the security guards, the boxes contain automatic weapons and deadly explosives, which the terrorists plan to use to take control of the bank. Dev's team tactically disables all the security alarms and safety devices. Once the stage is set, they shoot the security guard, shut the front door, and take all the staff present as hostages. Dev and his assistant force the bank manager to open the safe. As they start looting the safe, another alarm, which Avinash had not revealed to them, goes off. Now, the terrorists find themselves trapped in the bank. No matter how hard they try to break out, they realize that they have painted themselves into a corner. The news spreads and an entire police force descends on Manipal Towers. The Police Commissioner Subhash (Ananth Nag) steps in and assesses the situation. He realizes that he does not command the requisite force to accomplish this task and requests the Chief Minister to dispatch an anti-terrorist squad immediately. The Chief Minister agrees immediately. Commando Ajay (Vishnuvardhan) is apprised of the situation. He has been a good friend of the Police Commissioner for a long time. He quickly assembles a team and meets with the police commissioner. Commando Ajay takes charge of the operation and learns that the terrorist Dev is the brother of another terrorist who he himself had killed a few years ago. Dev, too, learns that Ajay has been enlisted to supervise this operation and demands that he be taken off the force immediately. When he doesn't oblige, Dev kills the bank manager by throwing him out of the building. The commissioner is left with no choice but to listen to the terrorist. Soon enough, the police commissioner hatches a plot to bring back Ajay. He orders his fellow officers to bring a large number of pigeons from Shivajinagar. When the pigeons arrive, he informs Ajay of his plan, and when they start flying, Ajay replaces a lookalike commando and takes charge. Meanwhile, the hostages inside grow restless. Fearing that they will all die, they hatch their own plan and attempt a coup. It goes horribly wrong and a few of the hostages get killed. Gundanna (Ramesh Bhat) a lift mechanic, with whom Ajay is in constant touch, acts as a spy and aids Ajay in performing reconnaissance of the terrorists and their activities. In the end, Ajay infiltrates the terrorist stronghold with the help of his trusted commando (Prakash Raj) and Gundanna. Although the commando valiantly gives up his life and Gundanna is seriously injured, Ajay frees the hostages, kills Devraj, and saves the day.

In fact, the book is the work of Terry Jones and Michael Palin, who adapted a range of material from scripts written for the television comedy series, Monty Python's Flying Circus. Some material was later used in the duo's later TV series, Ripping Yarns (1975‚Äì78). The first edition was sold bearing a sticker on the front cover which read \\"A Monty Python Educational Product\\". The book satirises elements of educational text books, as well as annuals, which were popular hardcover publications for children featuring short stories, comic strips, and games, often based upon television series and films of the day. Style of humour The book uses the characteristic absurdist humour similar to Monty Python and relies on the use of non- sequitur, parody, anarchic humour, juvenile references to bodily functions, and black comedy-style descriptions of gory violence for comedic effect. A fictional character, Dr. Bert Fegg, is presented as the author of the book. His bloodthirsty, psychopathic character is depicted in constant conflict with the publishers, as they attempt to raise the moral tone of the book and censor violent content. The exchange between author and publishers is presented through textual interjections such as \\"That's enough ‚Äì the Publishers\\", in the style often used in the satirical magazine Private Eye. Dr. Fegg's angry comments are scrawled handwriting printed on the pages. Recurring jokes throughout the book include a number of parody advertisements for exotic household gadgets, appearances by the sinister West Bromley Fighting Haddock, and passing references to \\"the Bournemouth Killings\\". Authors and contributors Python writers Terry Jones and Michael Palin wrote the content, with artwork provided by several British illustrators. Contributors to the book include British comics artist Frank Bellamy (A Cowboy Story), cartoonists Martin Honeysett and Lolly Honeysett, and Paul Buckle, an illustrator who worked on a number of instructional football skills books in the 1970s. Content Among the topics covered in the book are: The West Bromley Fighting Haddock *The Wonderful World of Nature ‚Äì descriptions of several fictional animals, such as the Patagonian Bursting Rabbit and the West Bromley Fighting Haddock *Across the Andes by Frog ‚Äì a burlesque of a travel diary in a mock-heroic style; this material was later used in the TV series Ripping Yarns (1977) *Soccer My Way by the Supremes ‚Äì a parody of football tactics books featuring the popular singing groups the Supremes and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, illustrated by Paul Buckle *Interesting Machines ‚Äì illustrated in the style of Heath Robinson, this page describes a range of fantastical devices including the \\"Tally-Ho\\" Automatic Bed Wetter and the \\"Hygena\\" Automatic Nose Picker. *The Famous Five Go Pillaging ‚Äì a short story which parodies the writing style of Enid Blyton; five children witness the collapse of Roman imperialism and their friends and family are slaughtered by 9000 invading Vikings. *Great Men of History ‚Äì in fact a collection of nonsensical poems about three women: Queen Elizabeth I, Queen Boadicea and Lady Godiva *A Cowboy Story ‚Äì a pastiche of a Western comic strip, in which cowboy \\"Kid\\" Masterton's horse develops bronchial pneumonia and is taken to a clinic for treatment; illustrations are by British comics artist Frank Bellamy. *Aladdin and his Terrible Problem ‚Äì a humorous pantomime script following the exploits of Aladdin and his sidekick, Pisso the Alcoholic Dog. The script ends abruptly with \\"Curtain. End of Act Two. Theatre goes out of business.\\" The original hardcover featured a page of paper dolls of the play's characters that, in theory, could be cut out and used to perform the play. *How to Destroy this Book ‚Äì a final exhortation by Dr. Fegg to his young readers to wanton destruction, censored by the publishers. *The original UK edition also included references to a faux contest whereby readers were invited to look for a \\"deliferate mistale\\" located \\"somewhat\\" in the book. *The book climaxes with a two-page, gory illustration of Bert Fegg chopping open a monster with an axe (presented in the style of Terry Gilliam's animations), followed by profuse apologies by the book's publishers and a final scrawled rant by Fegg.

The village lies within the historical parish of Abernethy and Kincardine, and the Cairngorms National Park. History Often affectionately referred to simply as \\"Nethy\\" the village has, since Victorian times been a tourist destination noted for its quiet and secluded location at the edge of the Abernethy Forest. It is in the heart of Strathspey in the Highlands of Scotland, between Aviemore and Grantown, and is within the boundary of the Cairngorms National Park which was established in 2003. A primary industry of Nethy Bridge was forestry, with at one time several sawmills in the area, but this has long since subsided and now much of the income is derived from tourism. The name is derived from the River Nethy, a tributary of the nearby Spey, which runs through the village, and the arched bridge which was built in 1810, to a classic Telford design, and is in the heart of the village. It had to be repaired after the Moray flood of August 1829, when part of it was washed away. In total, there are four Telford bridges in Nethy. Originally called Abernethy (), Nethy Bridge was renamed when the railways came this far north in the 1860s. The Great North of Scotland Railway already had a village called Abernethy on its line further south, so renamed this one Nethy Bridge to differentiate the two. The placename Abernethy is still frequently used around here: Abernethy Highland Games, Abernethy Forest, Abernethy Primary School etc. Community and tourism In 2011 the population of Nethy Bridge was 640. Nethy Bridge was one of the first communities in the area to establish a tourist association website.

Biography The Morris Brothers were born in Old Fort, North Carolina. Originally, they began performing as a trio together with a third brother, George Morris.Lange 2004, p. 57. In 1933, Zeke moved to ConcordHuber 2008, p. 289. and joined J. E. Mainer's Crazy Mountaineers He made his first recordings with the Mountaineers in August 1935 f√∂r Bluebird Records.Tribe 2006, p. 234. Four years later, in 1937, Wiley and Zeke along with banjo player Wade Mainer did some radio work in the North Carolina towns of Asheville and Raleigh. In April 1938, The Morris Brothers, fiddler Homer Sherrill and banjo player Joel Martin, calling themselves the Smilin' Rangers, performed at radio station WBTM in Danville, Virginia.Erbsen 2003, p. 74. In September 1938, Zeke recorded with Charlie Monroe as a replacement for Bill Monroe just after the Monroe Brothers had disbanded.Russell, Pinson 2004, p. 632.Carlin 2004, p. 208. The same year, Zeke's musical career came to a halt when he went to work in a cotton mill in Gastonia. In 1939, the brothers moved to Asheville and WWNC radio, where they resumed their career. After World War II they retired and opened an auto repair business. Between 1938 and 1939, the Morris Brothers made 36 recordings for RCA Victor. Well known musicians who have played with the Morris Brothers include: Hoke Jenkins, Red Rector, Red Smiley, Don Reno, Benny Sims and Earl Scruggs.Erbsen 2003, p. 75.

The Catholic Church was dedicated to Saint Nicholas. Its date of dedication as an Eastern Orthodox church is unknown, but it is commonly identified with the 9th-century Monastery of Manuel (). The interest of Kefeli Mosque arises because it repurposes the early Christian basilica form during the later Byzantine period.Mathews (1976), p. 190. Location The building lies in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighborhood of Salmatomruk, on Kasap Sokak, more or less halfway between the mosque of Chora and the mosque of Fethiye. History The mosque in a drawing of 1877. The origin of this building, which lies on the slope of the sixth hill of Constantinople, is not certain. The tradition says that in the ninth century Manuel the Armenian, a general in the wars against the Saracens during the reign of Emperor Theophilos (r. 829‚Äì842), built a monastery converting his house, which lay near the cistern of Aspar.Van Millingen (1912), p. 254. Manuel was the uncle of Empress Theodora, wife of Theophilos, and before retiring to his monastery he was one of the three counselors who assisted her in the regency for her infant son Michael III, following the death of her husband. The Monastery of Manuel was rebuilt by Patriarch Photius, and was restored again by usurper Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920‚Äì944). Emperor Michael VII (r. 1071‚Äì1078) retired here after his deposition.Van Millingen (1912), p. 257 All these events show the importance of this monastery in Constantinople. Nevertheless, the attribution of this building to the complex founded by Manuel is far from certain, and has been denied by the newest research. The documented history of the current edifice begins in 1475, shortly after the Fall of Constantinople, when the Ottomans conquered the Genoese colony of Caffa, in Crimea. All the Latin, Greek and Jewish inhabitants who lived in Caffa (\\"Caffariotes\\" or, in Turkish, Kefeli) were then deported to Istanbul and relocated to this quarter. The Latins, mainly Genoese, were authorized to use this building as a church together with the Armenians. The church, dedicated to Saint Nicholas, was officiated by the Dominicans, and kept by four Catholic families.M√ºller-Wiener (1977), 166 Armenians and Catholics had separated altars. This small church depended on the near Catholic Church of Saint Mary, which later became the Odalar Mosque. In 1630, under the reign of Murad IV (1623‚Äì1640), the church was converted into a mescit (a small mosque) by Great Vizier Receb Pasha, but retained the denomination, being first known as Kefe Mahalle, then as Kefeli Mescidi. In exchange, the Armenians got a Greek church in Balat. Architecture The apse of the mosque with the minaret seen from the north. From here, the alternate courses of bricks and stone are clearly visible. The building is a large hall, 22.6 meter long by 7.22 wide,Van Millingen (1912), p. 258. and is oriented in North-South direction, which is quite uncommon among the Byzantine churches in Constantinople. Its masonry consists of alternate courses of bricks and stones. The original building had a triple-nave plan, but the only remains of the side aisles belong to the end wall of the western one. To the north side there is an arch and a semicircular apse made of bricks, which outside has a polygonal shape. The walls of the apse are indented by two niches. The main aisle has walls which are lighted by two ranges of windows, which are irregularly spaced. The southern wall is also lighted by two ranges of windows. The lower windows are much larger than the higher. The entrance is situated in the middle of the western wall. Under the western side there is a cistern, whose roof rests on three columns. The dating of the edifice is uncertain. The polygonal apse and the niches in the apse are typical of the churches of Palaiologan foundation. The building is architecturally interesting because it is an example of reproposition of the early Christian Basilica form during the later Byzantine period.

Early life Born in Geelong, Victoria in 1890, Brearley moved to Western Australia in 1906. Aviation career In April, 1915, after undertaking a 5-year apprenticeship as a mechanic, he worked his way to the United Kingdom and subsequently enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps. Whilst flying in France during World War I he was badly wounded in October, 1916, and returned to Western Australia to recover. In 1921, Brearley founded Western Australian Airways Ltd. In the same year, Brearley was issued with Australia's first civil pilot's licence, under the 1921 Air Navigation Regulations. Despite his holding licence No. 2, licence No. 1 was not issued until the 1930s in honour of Amy Johnson's record flight from London to Australia. In 1927, Brearley opened the Perth Flying School at Maylands. He retired from commercial aviation in 1936 when he merged his airline with Australian National Airways. Later life Brearley later served with the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II. Brearley was knighted in 1971. He died on 9 June 1989.

It is in the municipality of La Oliva. It is surrounded to the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, by dunes to the south and by arid desert land to the west that leads to the western coast and El Cotillo. Once a traditional fishing village, the town has grown significantly and today is one of the two main tourist towns on the island of Fuerteventura. Thanks to the large expat population, the town has a diverse population that varies from the local Spaniard, to the Irish, British, German and Finnish people who have settled in the resort. The area has of fine sand starting outside of Corralejo, alongside some smaller bays across the coast. In addition, there are several miles of sand dunes located nearby, which have been designated as a nature reserve. The waters around Corralejo are clear and an intense shade of blue, but are affected by strong currents. The town's beaches are somewhat more sheltered and have a band of volcanic rock along the shoreline. History =Conquest Era= Fishermen in Corralejo, 1920. The area that currently contains the tourist resort and surrounding dunes was where Gadifer de la Salle and his expedition first landed on Fuerteventura in 1402. They had landed on neighbouring Lanzarote in the Summer of 1402, where they concluded a peace agreement with the local population and established a fortress from which they would coordinate their conquest of Fuerteventura. Jean de B√©thencourt, who led the expedition to the islands, took a group of his men across the water from their fortress in Lanzarote to explore Fuerteventura. On that first landing, B√©thencourt remained on board the ship while La Salle and Remonnet de Levedan went ashore to explore the island and look for locals. The arid North of the island was not densely populated and the conquistadors found little in the way of local life. While La Salle was on Fuerteventura (he and his party stayed for eight days on their first landing), a mutiny had broken out on the ship where B√©thencourt and his men remained. The mutiny was carried out by men who demanded B√©thencourt return to mainland Europe to get supplies. While B√©thencourt was away, La Salle made his second landing on Fuerteventura, again using the area around Corralejo as their landing site. They made the crossing from the Lanzarote fortress in October 1402, landing on the Island of Lobos to hunt the local seal population that lived there. Lobos is positioned north east of Corralejo and made a convenient base to hunt (with the island's seals being valuable for food, while their skins were used to make simple shoes). After a few days on the island, La Salle sent Levedan back to the fortress on Lanzarote to replenish their supplies, with the group in particular need of water- Lobos has no fresh water source. Another mutiny on Lanzarote meant that, on its arrival, the boat Levedan was in command of was taken over by the mutineer members of B√©thencourt's army of conquest. This left La Salle and his men trapped on the island of Lobos without a source of food or water. Those who remained loyal to B√©thencourt on Lanzarote would use a flimsy boat to rescue La Salle and his men from Lobos. =Tourism= The Dunes of Corralejo are a major tourist attraction. Corralejo 2016 Corralejo has existed for most of its history as a humble and unimportant fishing village, where a handful of poor fishermen worked long hours to provide for their families. In the early 1970s, with its extraordinary beaches and expansive dunes, the tourism that had arrived in the south of the island in the 1960s began to venture north. Corralejo had very humble beginnings as a tourist resort. John Mercer, who visited the then village in the early 1970s as research for a book on the island, left a record of the humble first steps Corralejo took into the tourist industry: \\"The village, however, unattractive and quite without interest. Why anyone should wish to spend any time there until its development is over and the dust and noise have died down is not clear.. a visitor or a purchaser can wake up any day to find a house or a hotel starting a metre or two away.\\" -John Mercer, Canary Islands: Fuerteventura. 1973 Mercer prophetically said that Corralejo would \\"long be simply a spreading building site, dominated by concrete mixers, lorries, floating discarded cement bags, falling rubble and staring whistling oafs.\\" Tourism continued to develop in the town through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, reaching a peak in the 2000s. Hotels, apartments and villas sprang up. Many British and Irish tourists fell in love with the resort and felt happy to relocate there permanently. In the decades following Mercer's account of Corralejo's tourist development, that same growth of the tourist industry saw the population of Corralejo and the La Oliva region grow significantly. In the 1975 census the population of La Oliva was 2,900, with that population now just above 25,000. Throughout the 2010s, the town has grown significantly, with new businesses constantly opening and closing down. The town is also progressively being pedestrianized, starting with the town's main street around 2017 (however this decision to pedestrianize streets has received its share of criticism from the townsfolk). Vandalism has also risen with the long-abandoned replica of the Santa Maria galleon in the old \\"Europa Baku\\" theme park having been burned down by vandals in May 2019. Despite this, however, tourism is still going strong, with thousands visiting the town every year.  Transport  Tiadhe bus service. The main bus service of Fuerteventura Naviera Armas, as well as Fred Olsen, offer ferry connections between Corralejo and Play Blanca in Lanzarote Corralejo is serviced by a bus service (both public and chartered) and by a local taxi service operated by the region of La Oliva. The public bus service (Tiadhe) operates a bus service from the island's capital Puerto del Rosario (number 6), and from Puerto del Rosario to Caleta de Fuste and the Fuerteventura Airport (number 3) and down to the south of the island and the resort town of Morro Jable (number 1). Corralejo is serviced by taxis that offer local transport around the town and out to the beaches, and also travel further afield to the airport and other points and towns of interest. Ferries regularly connect the port of Corralejo with Playa Blanca in the south of Lanzarote.  Sports  C.D.

The film has a new actor, who has appeared in a couple of films, Vatsal Seth in a cameo role in the film, as Nanhe Jaiselmer, in the adult future. The film is based in Rajasthan. Synopsis Nanhe (Dwij Yadav) is the self-proclaimed camel jockey in the whole of Jaisalmer. Only ten years old, he can speak a myriad of languages and has won the hearts of all the tourists who visit Jaisalmer. But in Nanhe's heart is his favorite actor Bobby (Bobby Deol), who had worked with him in a film years ago when Nanhe was just a baby. In one of that film's scenes Bobby picks up the baby Nanhe and asks him 'Kaise ho mere dost?' (How are you my friend?). This memory alone leads Nanhe to believe that the actor is his long-lost best friend. No one believes that Bobby is Nanhe's friend. When it is announced that Bobby is finally coming to Jaisalmer on a 30-day movie shoot, Nanhe's wish is fulfilled, to finally meet his long-lost friend. Over the next few days Bobby and Nanhe enjoy much time together. Bobby teaches Nanhe how to use his most powerful utility, his brain and how to keep on learning new things in life. It is not long before Nanhe finds out that Bobby never came to Jaisalmer, he cancelled his shooting. Nanhe had been hallucinating Bobby the whole time. His subconscious had been healing him into learning good things and leaving bad habits such as taking tobacco. He realizes that each time he saw Bobby, he was in a get-up that came right out from all the posters in Nanhe's room. Years later an adult Nanhe (Vatsal Sheth) changes his name to Vikram Singh and writes a book about his own life, and about how he thought he met Bobby and other events that happened in his earlier life, but he is shocked when he finds out that on his book's premiere, Bobby actually shows up to congratulate him. Reminiscing all the past events they became good friends after all.

History The United States Navy commissioned pre-flight schools at the University of Georgia, the University of Iowa, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Saint Mary's College of California in 1942. Cadets were given three months of rigorous physical training and instruction in basic aerial navigation and communications. Graduates were sent to basic flight schools and advanced flight training before assignment to the Pacific Fleet. Athletics and training were emphasized at the schools. It was believed that the rigors of college football were ideal preparation for World War II. Numerous collegiate and professional athletes and coaches were recruited as instructors. They often played on or coached the football team of their respective school. Each team usually played established football powers in their respective region and other service academies. Iowa Pre-Flight was coached by former Minnesota coach Bernie Bierman in 1942 and went 7‚Äì3. The Seahawks were coached by former Missouri coach Don Faurot in 1943 and went 9‚Äì1. They finished second in the final AP Poll and were named the service academy national champion. Iowa Pre-Flight was coached by former Auburn coach Jack Meagher in 1944 and went 10‚Äì1.

FITS is predestined for this area of application due to its real-time display of navigation data. FITS was developed by the Spanish branch of the multinational Military Transport Aircraft Division of EADS. Areas of application In addition to tactical marine reconnaissance, FITS is deployed over a wide range of other operational areas: In internal security, border security or for coordination of police missions. It supports operational forces in drug investigations, immigration control and also in protecting natural resources. For example, FITS can be used to monitor fishing grounds or exclusive economic zones, to provide early warning of marine pollution incidents or to coordinate search and rescue services. Mode of operation In missions of this nature, FITS integrates large volumes of information and also evaluates potential threats at the same time. An intuitive man-machine interface forms the core of the modular FITS. This interface significantly enhances mission efficiency. Apart from numerous operational sensors, this system comprises an aircraft navigation and communication system. Each system is controlled by an operator using one of four multifunction consoles. The consoles are linked together via a high-speed LAN (Local Area Network) with central processors which facilitate fast processing of all incoming signals. Despite the high level of complexity, the acquisition costs for FITS are low, particularly in view of the fact that commercial hardware, standard interfaces and modular software are used. Something that initially sounds mass-produced is actually the trump card for this system. This is because using standardized components is the only way of integrating such a large number of sensors within a system of this nature. These standards also provide the potential for expansion and this is what ultimately ensures the projected service life of a marine reconnaissance aircraft over several decades. Depending on technical progress, this design allows numerous other sensors to be integrated within the FITS system in the future. Orders FITS is a proven system: The Spanish Armed Forces are already deploying it in the modernized P-3 Fleet and the Mexican Navy has installed the system in its C-212 aircraft. Since the start of 2001, this tactical system has also been in operation on board a C-295. Other FITS orders are for the CN aircraft of the Spanish ‚ÄúSasemar‚Äù air-sea rescue service, the CN-235 operated by the Irish Air Corps and the C-295 aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force. But FITS is now part of the standard equipment of reconnaissance aircraft on the other side of the Atlantic: The CN-235 aircraft of the US Coast Guard are also equipped with FITS technology. Visualization The key link between users and the information provided by the system is ILOG visualization technology, specifically ILOG Views. Apart from the symbology, ILOG Views provides the text menus for controlling the sensors, as well as the captured video data and the cartography of the mission area. The graphics can be easily adapted, intuitively controlled and hence form one of the keys for the flexibility of FITS. Without this flexibility, the reaction time of the crew would be substantially longer and the entire system would be much less suitable, for example, in the deployment of marine patrols. A key factor in the decision by EADS to adopt ILOG Views was the same reason governing the entire development of FITS. All the systems included are equipped with standard interfaces so that further development is possible at a later date with relatively little expenditure.

Overview  The term 'variety' was introduced by W. Ross Ashby to denote the count of the total number of states of a system. The condition for dynamic stability under perturbation (or input) was described by his Law of Requisite Variety. Ashby says:Ashby (1956) > Thus, if the order of occurrence is ignored, the collection > c, b, c, a, c, c, a, b, c, b, b, a > which contains twelve elements, contains only three distinct elements- a, > b, c. Such a set will be said to have a variety of three elements. He adds: > The observer and his powers of discrimination may have to be specified if > the variety is to be well defined. Variety can be stated as an integer, as above, or as the logarithm to the base 2 of the number i.e. in bits. =Law of requisite variety= If a system is to be stable, the number of states of its control mechanism must be greater than or equal to the number of states in the system being controlled. Ashby states the law as \\"variety can destroy variety\\".Ashby (1956) p207 He sees this as aiding the study of problems in biology and a \\"wealth of possible applications\\" . He sees his approach as introductory to Shannon information Theory (1948) which deals with the case of \\"incessant fluctuations\\" or noise. The requisite-variety condition can be seen as a simple statement of a necessary dynamic equilibrium condition in information theory terms cf. Newton's third law, Le Chatelier's principle. 17/13. This law (...) says that if a certain quantity of disturbance is prevented by a regulator from reaching some essential variables, then that regulator must be capable of exerting at least that quantity of selection. (Were the law to be broken, we would have a case of appropriate effects without appropriate causes, such as an examinee giving correct answers before he has been given the questions (S.7/8). .WR Ashby (1960), \\"Design for a Brain, p229\\" A system has good control if and only if the dependent variables remain the same even when the independent variables or the state function have changed. In a real system this implies that the state function is a composition of two functions, such that the second is the inverse of (the possible changes of) the first: y = F(G(x)) where F = controller system's function of state G = controlled system's function of state x = inputs, or independent variables y = outputs, or dependent variables. Later, in 1970, Conant working with Ashby produced the good regulator theorem Conant 1970 which required autonomous systems to acquire an internal model of their environment to persist and achieve stability (e.g. Nyquist stability criterion) or dynamic equilibrium. Stafford Beer defines variety as \\"the total number of possible states of a system, or of an element of a system\\",Beer (1981) cf. Ludwig Boltzmann's Wahrscheinlichkeit. Beer restates the Law of Requisite Variety as \\"Variety absorbs variety\\".Beer (1979) p286 Stated more simply the logarithmic measure of variety represents the minimum number of choices (by binary chop) needed to resolve uncertainty. Beer used this to allocate the management resources necessary to maintain process viability. Variety is one of nine requisites that are required by an ethical regulator.M. Ashby, \\"Ethical Regulators and Super-Ethical Systems\\", 2017  Applications  In general a description of the required inputs and outputs is established then encoded with the minimum variety necessary. The mapping of input bits to output bits can then produce an estimate of the minimum hardware or software components necessary to produce the desired control behaviour; for example, in a piece of computer software or computer hardware. The cybernetician Frank George discussed the variety of teams competing in games like football or rugby to produce goals or tries. A winning chess player might be said to have more variety than his losing opponent. Here a simple ordering is implied. The attenuation and amplification of variety were major themes in Stafford Beer's work in management (the profession of control, as he called it). The number of staff needed to answer telephones, control crowds or tend to patients are clear examples. The application of natural and analogue signals to variety analysis require an estimate of Ashby's \\"powers of discrimination\\" (see above quote). Given the butterfly effect of dynamical systems care must be taken before quantitative measures can be produced. Small quantities, which might be overlooked, can have big effects. In his Designing Freedom Stafford Beer discusses the patient in a hospital with a temperature denoting fever.Beer (1974) Action must be taken immediately to isolate the patient. Here no amount of variety recording the patients' average temperature would detect this small signal which might have a big effect. Monitoring is required on individuals thus amplifying variety (see Algedonic alerts in the viable system model or VSM). Beer's work in management cybernetics and VSM is largely based on variety engineering. Further applications involving Ashby's view of state counting include the analysis of digital bandwidth requirements, redundancy and software bloat, the bit representation of data types and indexes, analogue to digital conversion, the bounds on finite state machines and data compression. See also, e.g., Excited state, State (computer science), State pattern, State (controls) and Cellular automaton. Requisite Variety can be seen in Chaitin's Algorithmic information theory where a longer, higher variety program or finite state machine produces incompressible output with more variety or information content. In 2009New Scientist 24 January 2009 James Lovelock suggested burning and burying carbonized agricultural waste to sequester carbon. A variety calculation requires estimates of global annual agricultural waste production, burial and pyrolysis efficiency to estimate the mass of carbon thus sequestered from the atmosphere.

The original name was \\"CITEFA\\" (Institute of Scientific and Technical Research for the Armed Forces). Its participation and findings were key in the development of weaponry and warfare materials and the increasing demand for technology caused an expansion and diversification to various disciplines and fields. In its beginnings, the Institute was dispersed over many geographical locations, but in 1969 all areas unified in a 19 hectare lot in the Villa Martelli neighborhood, Buenos Aires province, which is still its location nowadays. It has a 33,000 square meter lodge with laboratories and workshops, along with a drill-destined estate in the Villa Mar√≠a Military Factory, Cordoba province. In 1973, a new Scientific Regime was created for the R&D; staff of the Armed Forces, called RPIDFA (R√©gimen para el Personal de Investigaci√≥n y Desarrollo de las Fuerzas Armadas).

In 1988 Ryan was accused by British authorities of involvement in Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) activity, and was the subject of two unsuccessful extradition requests. Ryan denied the accusation in an interview with The Tipperary Star, saying that he had raised money both inside and outside Europe for victims on the nationalist side in the Troubles of Northern Ireland. But Ryan insisted that he had \\"never bought explosives for the IRA or anybody else\\", and had never been requested by the paramilitary group to do so. In an interview with the BBC broadcast in 2019, Ryan admitted that he was \\"one hundred percent\\" involved in IRA bomb-making.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- northern-ireland-49797327 Early life Ryan was born in 1930 in Rossmore, County Tipperary, one of six children in a farming family. He attended the Pallotine College in Thurles, being ordained in 1954. He worked on the missions in the diocese of Mbulu in Tanzania, and also in London.  IRA activity  On 1 May 1988, three off-duty British servicemen were killed in the Netherlands. On 30 June 1988, acting on a tip-off, Belgian police went to the home of an IRA sympathiser and arrested Ryan, who was believed to be acting as quartermaster of the IRA active service unit in Belgium. Upon his arrest, the police seized a quantity of bomb-making equipment and manuals, and a large sum of foreign currency. The British authorities provided substantial evidence in support of a request for Ryan's extradition from Belgium to face charges in Britain. Legal argument between the two countries ensued and, following a hunger strike in protest against his possible extradition to Britain, Ryan was, after a court ruling, instead deported to the Republic of Ireland. On 30 November 1988, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Britain was in breach of European law for permitting the detention for up to a week of people suspected of connections with terrorist groups. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reacted angrily to the court ruling and to Britain's failure to secure the extradition of Fr Patrick Ryan, who was wanted on charges of helping the outlawed IRA. Thatcher told the House of Commons: \\"We shall consider the judgment carefully and also the human rights of the victims and potential victims of terrorism.\\"  Extradition demand  Upon his transfer to Ireland, Britain formally demanded Ryan's extradition. On 29 November 1988, Conservative MP Michael Mates called at PMQs for the immediate extradition of this \\"terrorist\\". Thatcher responded: :\\"The failure to secure Ryan's arrest is a matter of very grave concern to the Government. It is no use governments [of Belgium and Ireland] adopting great declarations and commitments about fighting terrorism if they then lack the resolve to put them into practice.\\" The next day in parliament, Labour MP Tony Benn raised with the Speaker the following point of order: :\\"It is clearly a misuse of privilege to use the protection of the House of Commons to make such an allegation. Father Ryan is wanted on a serious charge. It could hardly be more serious. It is in accordance with the practice of British courts that anyone charged is presumed innocent until convicted. Therefore, when a senior Member of the House says, and it is confirmed by the Prime Minister, that that person is a terrorist, it is impossible from that moment on for that man to have a fair trial. The BBC broadcast those remarks and every newspaper has highlighted them. Yesterday, the House of Commons became a lynch mob, headed by the Prime Minister, whose remarks are bound to prejudice any jury or judge if Father Ryan is brought to this country.\\"PM abused Question Time to make a statement on the extradition of Father Patrick Ryan Michael Mates MP was the next to speak: :\\"Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker, I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr Benn) for the courtesy of telling me that he was going to raise this matter. I used the phrase yesterday solely in the context of my outrage at the fact that that person was not being brought here to face trial. It was not intended to be an intimation of guilt. Strictly, I should have said, 'Ryan is the man the security forces most want in connection with serious offences.' I am happy to make that plain.\\"  Extradition denial  On 1 December 1988, the Attorney General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, asserted that the extradition paperwork sent to Ireland was in order and the government's claim to have Ryan extradited should be acceded to. However, Fr Ryan said that he would rather die than face a British tribunal as he believed Irish people could never receive justice through the British legal system. The controversy was heightened by the publication of a letter in The Guardian of 7 December 1988 from a British diplomat accusing Thatcher of \\"double standards on terrorism\\" for insisting on Fr Ryan's extradition while failing to pursue the extradition of the Coventry Four from South Africa four years earlier. The following week, amid exchanges in the House of Commons, opposition leader Neil Kinnock, said Thatcher \\"blew\\" the possibility of Fr Ryan's extradition by her \\"performance.\\" On 13 December 1988, the Irish Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, announced in D√°il √âireann that the serious charges levelled against Ryan should be investigated by a court in Ireland and, because of prejudicial remarks made in the House of Commons, Fr Ryan could not expect to receive a fair trial in Britain. In October 1989, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Ireland announced that he had decided not to initiate proceedings against Father Patrick Ryan.D√°il √âireann - Decision of DPP - Father Patrick Ryan  1989 European election  Ryan was the first priest to contest an election in the Republic of Ireland, when he contested the 1989 European Parliament election in the Munster constituency as an Independent with Sinn F√©in support.

BBC Spotlight interview In a 2019 interview with the BBC, Ryan was asked if he was involved in any of the incidents of which Thatcher accused him, to which he responded \\"I would say most of them. One way or another, yes I had a hand in most them - yes, [Thatcher] was right\\". He stated that his only regret about his contribution to the Brighton hotel bombing, which killed 5 people, was that \\"I wasn't even more effective...

Biography =Early life= He was born in Viam, Corr√®ze in 1953. He spent part of his childhood in the neighborhood of Badaro in Beirut, Lebanon. =Work and career= In 1994, he won the Essay Prize from the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise for his book Le Sentiment de la langue (‚ÄúThe Feeling of Language‚Äù). Several of Millet's novels are set in the village of Siom (Viam's literary counterpart), including La Gloire des Pythre (‚ÄúThe Glory of the Pythres‚Äù), L'Amour des trois s≈ìurs Piale (‚ÄúThe Love of the Three Piale Sisters‚Äù), Lauve le pur (‚ÄúLauve the Pure‚Äù), and Ma vie parmi les ombres (‚ÄúMy Life Among the Shadows‚Äù). More generally, the Plateau de Millevaches - its landscape, climate, geographic location and the evolution of the lives of its inhabitants over the course of the century - is an essential element in his work, as Haute-Provence was for Giono, the county of Yoknapatawpha for Faulkner or Wessex for Thomas Hardy. Millet mixes religious elements with coarse language, evoking the French Catholic tradition in a way that acknowledges the modern sexual revolution. Desire, suffering and evil are themes that permeate all of his work. He is also an editor at Gallimard, where he played a decisive role in the publication of Jonathan Littell's novel Les Bienveillantes, which won the 2006 Prix Goncourt. In 2005, he was with others authors as Alain Decaux, Fr√©d√©ric Beigbeder and Jean-Pierre Thiollet one of the Beirut Book Fair's guests in the Beirut International Exhibition & Leisure Center, commonly (BIEL). The September 2007 publication of D√©senchantement de la litt√©rature, in which he denounces the inanity of contemporary French literature and the loss of religious feeling in the West, generated a good deal of controversy.Richard Millet pr√™che dans le d√©sert =Defense of Breivik= In July 2012, Millet published √âloge litt√©raire d'Anders Breivik, a condemnation of the actions of Anders Breivik and a critical exploration of his ideology, as part of a collection of essays. In √âloge he asks why the Breivik case happened today, in Norway. He describes Breivik's victims as \\"mixed-raced, globalized, uncultivated, social-democrat petit bourgeois.\\" In the same essay, he also argues that the Norwegian massacre was the result of a weakened European identity, cultural decay, mass immigration and multiculturalism, and calls Breivik's mass murders ‚Äúformal perfection ‚Ä¶ in their literary dimension.‚Äù. Referring to the controversy that followed, Millet stated ‚ÄúI‚Äôm one of the most hated French authors.

An alternative investment is an investment in any asset class excluding stocks, bonds, and cash. The term is a relatively loose one and includes tangible assets such as precious metals, art, wine, antiques, coins, or stamps and some financial assets such as real estate, commodities, private equity, distressed securities, hedge funds, exchange funds, carbon credits, venture capital, film production,Shelly Schwartz, \\"Investing In The Big Screen Can Be A Profitable Story\\", CNBC, 18 October 2010.

Investments in real estate, forestry and shipping are also often termed \\"alternative\\" despite the ancient use of such real assets to enhance and preserve wealth. In the last century, fancy color diamonds have emerged as an alternative investment class as well. Alternative investments are to be contrasted with traditional investments. Research As the definition of alternative investments is broad, data and research vary widely across the investment classes. For example, art and wine investments may lack high-quality data. The Goizueta Business School at Emory University has established the Emory Center for Alternative Investments to provide research and a forum for discussion regarding private equity, hedge fund, and venture capital investments.  Access to alternative investments  In recent years, the growth of alternative finance has opened up new avenues to investing in alternatives. These include the following: = Equity crowdfunding = Equity crowdfunding platforms allow \\"the crowd\\" to review early-stage investment opportunities presented by entrepreneurs and take an equity stake in the business. Typically an online platform acts as a broker between investors and founders. These platforms differ greatly in the types of opportunities they will offer up to investors, how much due diligence is performed, degree of investor protections available, minimum investment size and so on. Equity crowdfunding platforms have seen a significant amount of success in the UK and, with the passing of JOBS Act Title III in early 2016, are now picking up steam in the United States. = SEIS and EIS funds = Only available in the UK, SEIS funds and EIS funds present a tax-efficient way of investing in early-stage ventures. These work much like venture capital funds, with the added bonus of receiving government tax incentives for investing and loss relief protection should the companies invested in fail. Such funds help to diversify investor exposure by investing in multiple early ventures. Fees are normally charged by the management team for participating in the fund, and these can end up totaling anywhere between 15% and 40% of the fund value over the course of its life. = Private equity = Private equity consists of large-scale private investments into unlisted companies in return for equity. Private funds are typically formed by combining funds from institutional investors such as high- net-worth individuals,insurance companies, university endowment funds and pension funds. Funds are used alongside borrowed money and the money of the private equity firm itself to invest in businesses they believe to have high growth potential. =Venture Capital= Venture capital consists of private investments made into young start-up companies in exchange for equity. Venture capital funds are typically formed by drawing capital from seed money, or angel investors. Nowadays, crowdfunding is also used by start-up companies for capital. Accredited investors such as high-net worth individuals, banks, and other companies will also invest in a start-up company if it grows to a large enough scale. =Infrastructure as an asset class= The notion of ‚Äúinfrastructure as an asset class‚Äù has grown steadily in the past seven years. But, so far, this development has been the preserve of institutional investors: pension funds, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds, with very limited access to high-net-worth investors (except a few large family offices). = Art = In a 1986 paper, William Baumol used the repeat sale method and compared prices of 500 paintings sold over 410 years before concluding that the average real annual return on art was 0.55%. Another study of high-quality oil paintings sold in Sweden between 1985 and 2016 determined the average return to be 0.6% annually. However, art gallerists are sometimes ambivalent to the idea of treating artwork as an investment. Art is also notoriously difficult to value, and there are quite a few factors to bear in mind for art valuation. Investors The \\"Merrill Lynch/Cap Gemini Ernst & Young World Wealth Report 2003\\", based on 2002 data, showed high-net-worth individuals, as defined in the report, to have 10% of their financial assets in alternative investments. For the purposes of the report, alternative investments included \\"structured products, luxury valuables and collectibles, hedge funds, managed futures, and precious metals\\".Merrill Lynch/Cap Gemini Ernst & Young World Wealth Report 2003, p.12. Retrieved 28 March 2010. By 2007, this had reduced to 9%.Cap Gemini Merrill Lynch World Wealth Report 2008, p.14. Retrieved 28 March 2010. No recommendations were made in either report about the amount of money investors should place in alternative investments. A Good Delivery bar, the standard for trade in the major international gold markets. Characteristics Alternative investments are sometimes used as a way of reducing overall investment risk through diversification. Some of the characteristics of alternative investments may include: *Low correlation with traditional financial investments such as stocks and bonds *It may be difficult to determine the current market value of the asset *Alternative investments may be relatively illiquid (see \\"liquid alts\\") *Costs of purchase and sale may be relatively high *There may be limited historical risk and return data *A high degree of investment analysis may be required before buying Liquid alternatives Liquid alternatives (\\"alts\\") are alternative investments that provide daily liquidity. Liquid alternative investments should produce returns uncorrelated to GDP growth, must have protection against systemic market risk and should be too small to create new systemic risks for the market. Hedge funds may be included in this category; however, traditional hedge funds may have liquidity limitations, and the term is usually used for registered mutual funds which use hedge fund strategies such as long-short equity investments. = United States = Liquid alternatives became popular in the late 2000s, growing from $124 billion in assets under management 2010 to $310 billion in 2014. However, in 2015 only $85 million was added, with 31 closed funds and a high-profile underperformance by the largest long-short equity fund at the time, Marketfield Fund. In 2014 there were an estimated 298 liquid alternative funds with strategies such as long-short equity funds; event-driven, relative value, tactical trading (including managed futures), and multi-strategy. This number does not include option income funds, tactical shorting and leveraged indexed funds. There has been expressed skepticism over the complexity of liquid alts and the lack of able portfolio managers. One of the world's largest hedge fund managers, AQR Capital, began offering funds in 2009, and grew from $33 billion in assets under management (AUM) in 2010 to $185 billion in AUM in 2017 driven in part by marketing mutual-fund like products with lower fees. As of 2016, AQR Capital was the largest manager of liquid alts.

American Indian tribal recognition in the United States most often refers to the process of a tribe being recognized by the United States federal government, or to a person being granted membership to a federally recognized tribe. There are 573 federally recognized tribal governments in the United States. Non-Acknowledged Tribes are tribes which have no federal designation as sovereign entities. This is not to be confused with recognition of Native Americans in the US which are defined by the BIA as any descendant of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas which is a US citizen. Federally Non-Recognized tribes refers to a subgroup of non-acknowledged tribes which had some sort of recognition by the British prior to the formation of the United States or by the United States but which were determined by the government to no longer exist as an Indian tribe or no longer meet the criteria for a nation to nation status.National Register: List of 564 recognized tribes, Oct. 1, 2010Federal Register: Supplement, Listing of one additional tribe, Oct. 27, 2010Federal Register 2012 list of 566 federally-recognized tribes.pdf The United States recognizes the right of these tribes to self-government and supports their tribal sovereignty and self-determination. These tribes possess the right to establish the legal requirements for membership.This right was upheld by the US Supreme Court in Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez in 1978, which is discussed in Ray (2007) p403 They may form their own government, enforce laws (both civil and criminal), tax, license and regulate activities, zone, and exclude people from tribal territories. Limitations on tribal powers of self-government include the same limitations applicable to states; for example, neither tribes nor states have the power to make war, engage in foreign relations, or coin money. Legal definitions of Indian abound; according to a 1978 congressional survey, there were upwards of 33 separate definitions of \\"Indian\\" used in federal legislation. The number of definitions increased when tribal enrollment statutes were included.Brownell (2001) p278, Garroutte 2003, 16 U.S. Government agencies may have varied definitions of \\"Indian.\\" For example, the National Center for Health Statistics currently assigns the mother's race to a child born to parents of different \\"races\\". When people give multiracial responses to questions of heritage, only the first race is entered.Peroff (1997) p487 The 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act uses a two-part definition which is especially influential.Brownell (2001) p299 It defines an Indian as a person who belongs to an Indian Tribe, which in turn is a group that \\"is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.\\" Historic judicial and legislative definitions Bureau of Indian Affairs seal Federal courts have not universally required membership in federally recognized tribes for a person to be classified as Indian. At times a person's membership in a federally recognized tribe was not sufficient for classification as Indian in the eyes of the courts.United States v. Antelope, 430 US 641, 646-47 n.7 (1977) stated that enrollment in a recognized tribe was not an absolute requirement for federal jurisdiction where the Indian defendant lived on the reservation and \\"maintained tribal relations with the Indians thereon.\\" Alberty v. United States, 162 US 499, 500-01 (1896) held that neither a former black slave who had been granted membership in the Cherokee nation nor the illegitimate son of a Chocktaw and a black woman who had married a Chocktaw Indian, were Indians, discussion in Brownell (2001) p283 The Major Crimes Act of 1885 placed seven major crimes under federal jurisdiction if committed by a Native American in Native American Territory. The Department of Justice required that a defendant be an enrolled member of a tribe to be covered by the Major Crimes Act.137 Cong. Rex. 23,673 (1991) discussed in Brownell (2001) p283As an aside, the Indian Civil Rights Act uses the Major Crimes Act to define Indian, which provides consistent jurisdiction. This prevents a person from seeking to be Indian for the purposes of tribal jurisdiction and then denying his status as an Indian for the purposes of federal jurisdiction, and vice versa, a person cannot claim to be an Indian for the purposes of federal jurisdiction and then try to use another definition for the purposes of avoiding tribal jurisdiction as discussed in Brownell (2001) p284 In his 1935 Memorandum to John Collier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the Assistant Solicitor, Felix S. Cohen, discussed the rights of a group of non-tribal Indians under the Indian Reorganization Act. This Act defined a person as Indian based on three criteria, tribal membership, ancestral descent, or blood quantum. (Cohen said of the group now known as the Lumbee Indians, recognized by the state of North Carolina: \\"[Clearly this group is not a] federally recognized Indian tribe. Neither are the members of this group residents of an Indian reservation.\\") In the 1930s when it was more involved in determining classification of American Indians, the federal government used five factors to certify individuals who claimed to be more than half-blood Indian: tribal rolls, testimony of the applicant, affidavits from people familiar with the applicant, findings of an anthropologist, and testimony of the applicant that he has retained \\"a considerable measure of Indian culture and habits of living.\\" The attempt to use physical characteristics to define Indians created some paradoxical situations. In 1939, for example, the BIA sent Harvard anthropologist Carl Selzer to Robeson County, North Carolina to review the claims of the Lumbee, who were of mixed- race descent. Using methods of assessment then used in physical anthropology, but since discounted, \\"He measured their features and put a pencil in each Indian's hair, noting 'Indian' blood if the pencil slipped through and 'Negroid' if it did not. The absurd results of his study listed children as Indian while omitting their parents, and placing brothers and sisters on opposite sides of the half-blood line.\\"Brownell (2001) p288 =Terminated recognition= Elderly Klamath woman by Edward S. Curtis, 1924 In the 1950s and 1960s, the federal government saw certain tribes as sufficiently capable of self-government, and thus \\"no longer in need of federal supervision.\\" The government terminated its relationship with numerous tribes under this policy, including the Menominees of Wisconsin, and the Klamath of Oregon. Many tribes opposed this, and have sought restoration of recognition. Not all have received restoration and Brownell (2001) reports that the policy has \\"devastated\\" many of the groups.Brownell (2001) p303 In particular, the tribes in California have been heavily affected by the termination era. For example, the Taylorsville Rancheria was established and participated in the IRA, but during the termination era the tribe's land was sold to Plumas county to be used for a park and roping club. The government failed to officially terminate the tribe through an act of congress, but the tribe was not included on the Federally Recognized tribes list. The Taylorsville Rancheria has been in limbo since that time and continues to struggle for their restored status as a recognized tribe. Recent shift to \\"political\\" definition Because continuing to determine Indian membership by racial criteria, such as blood quantum or Indian descent, would leave the government in a constitutionally indefensible position, it has attempted to change how its statutes and regulations provide for the distribution of benefits to Indians. Native American concerns over equal protection and tribal sovereignty have led the federal government to reduce its role as arbiter of race-based eligibility standards. This policy of allowing tribes self-determination on membership, as well as other aspects of their lives, has developed since the Nixon administration in the 1970s.Brownell (2001) p277 Nixon said the goal should be \\"to strengthen the Indian's sense of autonomy without threatening his sense of community. And we must make it clear that Indians can become independent of Federal control without being cut off from Federal concern and Federal support.\\" The pivotal legislation of the era was the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. This act began the government's process of transferring authority for administering federal grants and programs for Indians to tribal governments. Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, said in 1994 that, \\"Sovereignty, the inherent right of self-government and self-determination, is the focal point in all Indian issues.\\"Brownell (2001) p300 The government has shifted to social constructs: \\"political\\" definitions by which legislation has defined Indians based on membership in federally recognized tribes.Most often given is the two-part definition: an \\"Indian\\" is someone who is a member of an Indian tribe and an \\"Indian tribe\\" as any tribe, band, nation, or organized Indian community recognized by the United States The government and many tribes prefer this definition because it allows the tribes to determine the meaning of \\"Indianness\\" in their own membership criteria. Some analysts criticize the federal government's role even in this limited way, as still setting certain conditions on the nature of membership criteria. In some cases, an enrolled member of a federally recognized tribe may have no documented Native American \\"blood\\" (biological descent). Some of the Freedmen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma used to be such members. Following the Civil War, the U.S. government's 1866 treaty with the defeated Cherokee, who had been Confederate allies, required them to free their slaves and to provide the freedmen with citizenship in the tribe. By recent referendum, the Cherokee Nation limited membership to only those people who could show descent from at least one Native American listed on the Dawes Rolls. This excluded nearly 2000 Cherokee Freedmen, who, with their ancestors, had been participating in the tribe for generations. Litigation on this matter continues. The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 may be the only recent federal Indian legislation that was, at all stages of legislative deliberation, supported by Indians.Brownell (2001) p313 This law required that only Indians be allowed to market their handicrafts as \\"Indian made\\" and be sold at Indian crafts fairs. This was to halt the economic loss to Indians due to questionable and fraudulent claims of this sort, which was estimated between $400 and $800 million a year. In the Act, Indian was described as \\"any individual who is a member of an Indian tribe; or for the purpose of this section is certified as an Indian artisan by an Indian tribe.\\" An Indian tribe was defined more broadly than just to tribes with federal recognition, but also to \\"any Indian group that has been formally recognized as an Indian tribe by a State legislature or by a State commission or similar organization legislatively vested with State tribal recognition authority.\\" The broadness sought in part to protect the civil liberties of those who have Indian heritage and culture, but are not tribal members.Brownell (2001) p314 However, the definition was not broad enough to avoid disallowing many artists whose Indian background was not in doubt, including well-known Cherokee painter, Bert Seabourn.Bordewich (1996) p67 The 1994 federal legislation, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, gives another common definition, defining an Indian as one who belongs to an Indian tribe, which is a group that \\"is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.\\" The result of there being multiple legal definitions of Indian is that one may be eligible to receive educational grants, but not health benefits, one may be eligible to be chief of a tribe but not to obtain a Bureau of Indian Affairs loan or an Indian scholarship to a state university. Using federal laws to define \\"Indian\\" signals to some a continued government control over Indians, even as the government seeks to establish a sense of deference. Thus Indianness becomes a rigid legal term defined by the BIA, rather than an expression of tradition, history, and culture. Many groups claim descendants from tribes that predate European contact not federally recognized. According to Rennard Strickland, an Indian Law scholar, the federal government uses the process of recognizing groups to \\"divide and conquer\\" Indians: \\"the question of who is 'more' or 'most' Indian may draw people away from common concerns.\\"Brownell (2001) p302 Recognition =Gaining federal recognition= Today there are 573 groups (bands and tribes) recognized as Native American by the government. Those tribes which have already achieved federal recognition do not want the process made easier. Some spokesmen discuss what other kinds of groups might be encouraged, without encroaching on the recognized tribes. Cherokee Nation spokesman Mike Miller suggests that people with an interest in Indian culture can form heritage groups.Glenn 2006 Federally recognized tribes are suspicious of non-recognized tribes' efforts to gain acknowledgment, concerned that they may dilute already limited federal benefits. As casino gambling has raised tribal revenues dramatically, there is more competition by tribal groups to gain federal recognition and the right to operate gaming on reservations.Official Statement Cherokee Nation 2000, Pierpoint 2000 Gaining recognition also is a way for Native American groups to assert their identity, their Indianness.Horse (2005) Tribes were originally recognized as legal parties through treaties, executive orders, or presidential proclamations. The 1934 Indian Reorganization Act played a major role in the development of the concept of federal recognition. It provided recognition to those tribes with which the government already had a relationship. Under its provisions, some non-federally recognized tribes were enabled to become federally recognized. During the 1960s and early 1970s, dozens of groups that lacked federal acknowledgment came forward to demand their rights as Native peoples. In the east, groups like the Mashpee Wampanoag filed suit for lands lost in preceding generations. In the west, groups sought fishing rights. In the southeast, others came to demand the government recognize them as surviving aboriginal peoples. As federal tribal status allowed groups standing to bring claims and many came to see the injustice of denying acknowledgment to indigenous peoples, many parties came to acknowledge the need for more consistent procedures for recognizing tribes left outside the circle. With tribal input, the BIA created its Federal Acknowledgment Process in 1978. Currently known as the Office of Federal Acknowledgment, this entity is the main body charged with deciding which groups are eligible to secure status. Acknowledgment criteria have been created by regulation based on statute. They are set by the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Branch of Acknowledgment and Research. Since the mid-1970s, representatives of federally recognized tribes have consulted with BIA on these criteria. To be federally recognized, a group must meet the following: *\\"[S]ince 1900, it must comprise a distinct community and have existed as a community from historical times; *it must have political influence over its members; *it must have membership criteria; and *it must have membership that consists of individuals who descend from a historical Indian tribe and who are not enrolled in any other tribe.\\" The existence of persistent political relationship as an aspect of tribal relations is also emphasized. =Recognition for individuals= The United States Census allows citizens to check any ethnicity without requirements of validation. Thus, the census allows individuals to self- identify as Indian, merely by checking the racial category, \\"Native American/Alaska Native\\".Brownell (2001) p276-277 notes that much of the $180 billion dollars a year in federal for the benefit of Indians are apportioned on the basis of this census population In 1990, about 1.8 million people self- identified in the census as American Indian. About 60 percent of those, or 1.14 million people, are enrolled in federally recognized tribes.Thornton 1997, page 38 People who self-identify as Indian but are not a part of a federally recognized group often wish to join a recognized tribe. The tribal government, in the absence of some legal obligation which stipulates otherwise, has final jurisdiction over who is a member of the tribe. Holly Reckord, an anthropologist who heads the BIA Branch of Acknowledgment and Recognition, discusses the most common outcome for those who seek membership: \\"We check and find that they haven't a trace of Indian ancestry, yet they are still totally convinced that they are Indians. Even if you have a trace of Indian blood, why do you want to select that for your identity, and not your Irish or Italian? It's not clear why, but at this point in time, a lot of people want to be Indian.\\"Bordewich (1996) 66 Recently, federally recognized tribes have seen the number of enrolled members increase. In some cases this has been because of a revival of interest in Native American heritage and culture. The number of people who self-identify as Indians has been growing even more rapidly.Morello, Carol. (2001) \\"Native American Roots, Once Hidden, Now Embraced\\". Washington Post, April 7, 2001 Hastings Shade, the Cherokee Nation's deputy chief, talks of a Cherokee legend of a white snake that devours Indian land and people. Many generations later, a young Indian learns its ways and drives a stake through its heart. \\"In the end,\\" the legend concludes, \\"only Indian blood will be left, and people will be lining up to try to prove they have Indian blood.\\" Disenrollment An individual may be ejected by a tribe, sometimes for serious offenses,Indian Country Today October 7, 2014Indianz.com December 9, 2015Indian Country Today March 1, 2016 but sometimes, upon discovery that their claim is not well-founded.

Various states, most in the East, have a recognition process independent of federal recognition.The National Council of State Legislatures notes 14 states, although Sheffield (1998, p63-64) mentions that Florida, Maryland, and New Mexico have legislative or constitutional systems in place to grant state recognition, but that no groups currently have this status in those states. Some examples of state-recognized tribes are the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and the Houma Tribe of Louisiana. Footnotes Bibliography *Barrett, Barbara.

Geography Ershui is bordered on the north by Tianzhong Township, to the east by Mingjian Township in Nantou County, and to the west by Xizhou Township. Its name means, literally, \\"Two Waters\\", which is a reference to the two irrigation canals constructed in the township, 1 and 2, linking the waters from the nearby Zhuoshui River to the fertile Changhua Plain. Ershui is known for its picturesque scenery and the nearby Bagua Mountain Range, and offers many biking and hiking trails. The bulk of Ershui's population lives near its central plaza in front of the Ershui railway station, on the Western Line on the TRA's railway network. Ershui encompasses and a population of 15,489, including 8,126 males and 7,363 females as of January 2017. History The township's former name () refers to Babao canals 1 and 2, which take water from the Choshui River to irrigate the farmlands of Changhua. The canals are known as the \\"Mother Rivers of Changhua\\", spreading out in a fan-shaped distribution throughout Changhua county and creating a fertile plain for agriculture. During Japanese rule, the name was changed to , which was modified to Ershui Township after Taiwan's handover to the Republic of China in 1945. Records of habitation at Ershui has been documented all the way back to 1621, in the Ming dynasty. The first inhabitants first came from Fujian, mainland China to Lukang, Changhua County, and then to the foothills of the Bagua mountain range. The settlers co-existed with the indigenous people, and began farming, irrigated by spring water from the mountains. The population at that time was roughly 300. After the construction of Babao canal 1 during Qing rule, the population spread outwards from the Bagua foothills towards the canal itself. Farms emerged on both sides of the canal, and this farming boom increased the population to 1700 people, or around 300 households. With the construction of the passenger and freight station, local businesses emerged on 1 km of the station front street, which was accelerated by the formal construction of the TRA Nisui Station in 1918. Finally, the construction of a pineapple canning plant in 1932 began an economic boom for Nisui, making it the most prosperous town in the Choshui River region at the time. Administrative divisions The township comprises 17 villages: Changhe, Dayuan, Ershui, Fuxing, Gehe, Gexing, Guanghua, Guozun, Huimin, Shangli, Shenghua, Shiwu, Wenhua, Wuba, Xiuren, Yuanquan and Yumin.  Tourist attractions  Formosan rock macaque monkeys on a hiking trail at the Songboling Recreation area. A popular spot for tourists and locals alike is the nearby Songboling Recreational Area. The recreational area consists of hiking trails in the Bagua Mountain range, and stretches from Ershuei township into Tianzhong township to the north of it, as well as Mingjian township in Nantou. The various trails in Songboling, known for their beauty and breathtaking scenery, are also known for the rock macaque monkeys which inhabit the woods along the trails. The population of these macaque monkeys have boomed after tourists began feeding them. However, the local rock macaque preservation society has urged people not to feed them, since it reduces their ability to forage on their own, and overpopulation can also cause starvation.  Transportation  Ershuei's Train Station The Ershui Station was established in 1918. The Ershui station is on the TRA Western Line, and it is the transfer station for the TRA Branch Jiji Line railroad operated by the TRA. It is designated as a second-tier train station in the TRA system.

Students may enrol from anywhere in Australia, while operationally the program is run by the Western Sydney Institute of TAFE. OTEN courses are delivered using a range of media, including printed materials, videos, CD-ROMs and DVDs. Some OTEN courses and units are delivered online. OTEN students may also access local TAFE NSW library facilities. OTEN is a member of the Australian Open Universities scheme.  History  The first use of distance education for Australian VET was in 1910 when Sydney Technical College launched an emergency correspondence course to train health inspectors at a time when the country was gripped by a typhoid epidemic. By 1917, what had become the Correspondence Division was offering more than 20 subjects to distance learners, using a mix of correspondence education and converted railway wagons acting as makeshift classrooms and workshops. It also later assisted Australia's Second World War efforts by training 100,000 Australian and 43,000 US service personnel. In 1978, the service became known as the College of External Studies; in 1991, it was renamed the TAFE NSW Open Training and Education Network, or OTEN as it is now better known. In 1995, OTEN was relocated to a purpose-built facility in Strathfield, 14 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district. Since that time, it has grown exponentially. In 1998, it became a Registered Training Organisation (RTO). In 2000, it introduced a custom-designed Student Administration System (SAM), an integrated online student records, educational resource and materials supply chain management system. In 2002, it created an online tracking system to monitor students‚Äô progress. In 2010, it celebrated 100 years of public distance education in NSW.  OTEN‚Äôs Online Learning Systems  The rapid growth of the Internet coupled with the massive influence of social media has enabled OTEN to transition from what was essentially a correspondence school to an institution that offers online multimedia and interactive support for prospective and current students using such technologies as Moodle, Equella and Adobe Connect. This has enabled OTEN to increase its enrolments from 35,813 in 2006 to 118,060 in 2014. In 2012, OTEN redeveloped its website to incorporate features such as online chat and an interactive world map showing how many people are accessing the online learning system. Its delivery of real-time experiences for students has resulted in even more students accessing the site, sharing resources, discussing content and supporting one another in their educational journeys. OTEN also uses virtual classroom and conference tools to conduct live orientation sessions and tutorials for students. The Student Administration and Management System (SAM) enables OTEN to efficiently manage its distance students and on-campus and offsite teachers. It provides a comprehensive, auditable event and contact history for every student and manages the dispatch of well over 300,000 learning resource items per year. Another OTEN custom- designed online tool is Your Decision, which helps prospective students assess whether distance learning is suited to their needs and circumstances. This interactive platform features videos, course tasters and self- reflection tools and enables people to sample short courses in the form of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).

Antoine Polier was an engineer from Lausanne who supported the military adventures of Robert Clive and later became a rich trader and loyal supporter of the British Raj administration in Calcutta. He devoted his free moments to collecting rare manuscripts in Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic. Many were sent back to France to augment the growing collection in the Royal Library.

The definition varies depending on the sport. Boxing In boxing, a quadruple champion is a boxer who has won world titles in four different weight classes. The first ever man to earn that enormous distinction was Thomas Hearns on October 29, 1987. Hearns won his first four titles at the following divisions: Welterweight (147 lbs), Light Middleweight (154 lbs), Middleweight (160 lbs) and Light Heavyweight (175 lbs). By later winning a super middleweight title, he also became the first to win world titles in five weight divisions. The second man was Ray Charles Leonard, who on November 7, 1998 won his first championships at Welterweight (147 lbs), Light Middleweight (154 lbs), Middleweight (160 lbs), Super Middleweight (168 lbs) and Light Heavyweight (175 lbs). There are five titles in five divisions but his case is extremely rare: Leonard fought for two different belts in two different weight divisions the same night: Super middleweight (168 lbs) and Light heavyweight (175 lbs) against Don Lalonde so any of the titles can be attached as his fourth title. The legendary Leo Gamez was the first champion to win all the lightest divisions from Minimumweight (105 lbs), Light Flyweight (108 lbs), Flyweight (112 lbs) to Super Flyweight (115 lbs). Gamez did it on October 9, 2000. Some boxers have managed to win four titles and become Quintuple Champions. Motor racing Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel both won four F1 world championships. Juha Kankkunen and Tommi M√§kinen both won four World Rally Championships. Yvan Muller is the only person to win four World Touring Car Championships.

The parish includes Dillington Park and the hamlets of Atherstone and Ashwell. Etymology The village's name is from Old English and is composed of two elements: the Old English personal name HwitlƒÅc and tun meaning \\"farm\\" but here in the sense of \\"estate, village\\". The name was recorded as Witelecintone in 1127.  History  Whitelackington was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone. The village was the main home in the 17th century of the Speke family, including Hugh Speke. Rev. F. C. Johnson was vicar from 1825 to 1874. Clergy of the Church of England database His wife was the elder sister of James Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak, and their second son, Charles, succeeded him after his elder brother, John Brooke Johnson (later changed to Brooke) was disinherited. John is buried in the churchyard, along with some other family members. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Chard Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.  Church  The Church of St Mary the Virgin dates from the 14th century, and was built from hamstone. The interior fittings include a 14th-century piscina in the north transept, and in the east wall there is a richly decorated statue niche. Monuments include two defaced effigies on the floor of the south transept, a civilian of around 1350 and a knight in armour of 1375. The tomb of Sir George Speke (died 1583) is in Perpendicular rather than Renaissance style. There is also a monument to John Hanning (died 1807) by J. Richards of Exeter. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. Further reading *Collinson, Rev.

It was signed by all then-serving Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, with the exception of Tam Dalyell (Labour), a strident opponent of devolution. The list of signatories included several MPs who would later attain high office, including future prime minister Gordon Brown, future chancellor Alistair Darling, and future leaders of the Liberal Democrats Charlie Kennedy and Menzies Campbell. The Claim of Right was signed at the General Assembly Hall, on the Mound in Edinburgh - on 30 March 1989 by 58 of Scotland's 72 Members of Parliament, 7 of Scotland's 8 MEPs, 59 out of 65 Scottish regional, district and island councils, and numerous political parties, churches and other civic organisations, e.g., trade unions. The Claim was part of a process which led to devolution of powers from the Parliament of the United Kingdom to a new Scottish Parliament in 1999. Its title was a reference to the Claim of Right Act 1689, an Act of the Parliament of Scotland which limited the power of the Scottish monarch (at the time, William III and Mary II) in much the same manner as the English Bill of Rights passed the same year. In October 2011 the Scottish Government announced that the Claim of Right would be brought before the Scottish Parliament to allow MSPs to re-endorse the claims of the sovereignty of the Scottish people. The Claim of Right was debated in the Scottish Parliament on 26 January 2012. Text of the Claim The Claim of Right reads- Legal significance The Claim of Right has never had or claimed any legal force.  Debate in the House of Commons  On 4 July 2018, the House of Commons officially endorsed the principles of the Claim of Right, agreeing that the people of Scotland are sovereign and that they have the right to determine the best form of government for Scotland's needs. However this was a non-binding endorsement and did not create any legal recognition of the Claim of Right.

So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name Uproar. She was originally named P 31, renamed Ullswater in February 1943 and finally renamed Uproar in April 1943. Career One of her first actions, whilst serving as P 31, was to participate in the operation that led to the sinking of the Bismarck, though she did not see action directly. Uproar spent most of the war operating in the Mediterranean as part of the 10th flotilla, using Malta as a base. She was damaged whilst in port by an air raid, and required repairs before continuing operations. On commencing patrols, she went on to sink the Italian auxiliary patrol vessel D-15/Brindisi, the Italian merchant Chietti (the former French Artesien), and the small Italian passenger ship Andrea Sgarallino (see https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Sgarallino_(nave)). The Andrea Sgarallino had some 300 civilians on board off which only four survived. She also sank the Italian merchant Marin Sanudo. Uproar was subsequently attacked by depth charges from the Italian torpedo boats and Procione. Other targets included the German (former French) tanker Champagne. The German tanker ran aground off Bastia, Corsica, France after being torpedoed on the 24th by HMS Ultor. The torpedo from Uproar hit the engine room and left the Germans no choice but to abandon their salvage attempt. Uproar also damaged the German tanker Matera (the former French General Gassouin) and the German troop transport Virgilio (the former Yugoslavian Dubrovnik) north-east of St. Tropez, southern France. The Viriglio was towed to Toulon but declared a total loss. Uproar also unsuccessfully attacked the Italian merchant Chisone, the German submarine U-466 and the Italian light cruiser Raimondo Montecuccoli. She also participated in operations Harpoon and Vigorous in June 1942. Uproar survived the war and was sold for scrap on 13 February 1946, and scrapped at Thos W Ward Inverkeithing.

Most of French's originally estate is now owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which operates the property as a museum and sculpture garden. The property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965 in recognition of French's importance in American sculpture. History In 1896 Daniel Chester French purchased the farm of Marshall Warner in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, to house a summer estate and studio space. At this time, French had already achieved national notice, primarily for his bronze The Minute Man statue, commissioned in 1873 and placed at the Old North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts, in 1875. Following his purchase of the farm, French had a studio built on the property, to a design by his friend Henry Bacon, near the c. 1820 farmhouse. This space would become French's primary studio space for the rest of his working career, even though he divided his time between Stockbridge and New York City. In 1901 French hired Bacon to design a replacement for the farmhouse, the Georgian Revival structure now standing on the estate. His fame as a sculptor was cemented when he was chosen to provide the massive statue of Abraham Lincoln which stands in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC. Although the final carving of this massive work was not done at Chesterwood, French did his preliminary design work here, which included the construction of a scale model. After French's death in 1931, Chesterwood passed to his daughter, Margarget French Cresson. She formed the Daniel Chester French Foundation to manage of the property, including the main house and studio, while retaining the rest of the property for herself. Following a brief period of ownership by The Trustees of Reservations, the 79-acre parcel was acquired by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The National Trust was bequested another of the estate by Cresson. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places the following year. and It is open for tours from late May through mid-October; admission is charged. Description The estate covers of forest and field in the Taconic Mountains, in the heart of the cultural region of the Berkshires. Most of the estate's buildings are clustered on the north side of Williamsville Road, including the house, studio, a 19th-century barn which has been adapted as a museum gallery and visitor center, and other small outbuildings. On the south side of the road are a c. 1860 farmhouse, adapted for use as a caretaker's residence, and a smaller studio space built by French to escape the sometimes busy atmosphere in the main studio. A path meanders through the woods to the north, which was supposedly used by French, and which is now seasonally decorated with sculpture by currently-active artists. The main block of the studio is essentially a cube on each side, and enormous doors high on the west side. It has a peaked ceiling, with a skylight on the north-facing roof section. A terraced area to the south includes a porch covered by a flat roof supported by Doric columns, and there is a large reception room on the north side where French would entertain clients and friends. This room opens to the east onto a garden with a fountain designed by Henry Bacon. To the west of the studio block is a small chamber from which waste materials from the studio can be dumped to the basement via a chute. The house is 2-1/2 story Georgian Revival structure. Like the studio, it is finished in a stucco that has been mixed with marble chips to give it texture. It has a hip roof which is topped by a low balustrade, and which is pierced by gable dormers on the front and rear elevations. Open porches are found on both side elevations, and the south-facing front has a broad terrace, providing fine views of the Taconic Mountains. The most notable interior room is French's study, which includes woodwork taken from the Warner farmhouse, and replicating the \\"best\\" parlor of his family's homestead in Chester, New Hampshire. The studio, barn and other gallery spaces include sculptural studies for a number of his works, most notably: * The Minute Man (1875), Old North Bridge, Concord, Massachusetts * The Continents (1906), United States Customs House, New York City * Samuel F. Dupont Memorial (1921), the fountain at Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. * Abraham Lincoln (1922) in the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C.

History =Muir & Mirrielees Co. = In 1857 merchants Andrew Muir (1817‚Äì1899) and Archibald Mirrielees (1797‚Äì1877), who had arrived in St. Petersburg separately, founded the ‚ÄúMuir and Mirrielees‚Äù Trading Company.What We Did for the Russians, page 175, Michael Skinner, 2008 \\"feel sure you have heard of me ‚Äì and my partner in business, Andrew Muir (1817‚Äì1899). We are both Scots, who separately landed up in Russia early in the 19th century, and together set up a trading company in St Petersburg. Archibald Mirrielees was resident in St. Petersburg from 1822. In 1843 he established his own company, one of the most significant Anglo-Russian merchant houses.Harvey J.

From 1837 to 1842 he was employed by William Ropes & Co., an American firm of importers and exporters, but in 1843 he went into business on his own in St Petersburg as a wholesale import merchant, concentrating on haberdashery.\\" In the 1880s the company transferred from St. Petersburg to Moscow and acquired a building for their haberdashery shop in Theatre Square. Their new building was erected there in 1908 in the Gothic Revival style with some modern elements. The project was designed by the famous Russian architect Roman Klein. ‚ÄúMuir and Mirrielees‚Äù was the first and the largest department store in the last days of the Russian Empire (one could buy clothes, shoes, jewelry, perfumery and toys there). The store attracted the highest public interest: ‚ÄúIn the eyes of the Muscovites ‚ÄúMuir and Mirrielees‚Äù is a kind of exhibition of everything that was on sale in the capital, be it for the rich and the high society, or for the middle-class customers\\" wrote one of the contemporaries.

Early life and career Youngest son to John Joseph and Ellen Genevieve Stephens six children; five sons and one daughter. The family were living at the time on the Hawkesbury River at Brooklyn, New South Wales. Tom was educated by the Sisters of Mercy at their convent school in Parkes, NSW; then at Campbelltown NSW by the Good Samaritan Sisters before his secondary schooling at St Gregory's Marist Brothers Agricultural College in Campbelltown. After completing his secondary schooling, Tom entered St Colomba's Seminary in Springwood where he commenced studies for the Catholic Priesthood. After undertaking studies for a BA at the ANU, Tom continued on to Theology Studies at Manly's St Patrick's College but did not complete those studies for priesthood. Tom had been working closely with Aboriginal people in Redfern, assisting Father Ted Kennedy and Aboriginal leader Shirley Smith, known as Mum Shirl. This work led Tom to the Kimberley region of WA where he became closely involved with many indigenous communities across the region and was centrally involved in establishing the Kimberley Land Council in 1978. Tom became a West Australian state parliamentarian at age 31; he served as a Labor Party member of the Parliament of Western Australia from 1982 to 2013; serving first in the Legislative Council from 1982 to 2004, and then in the Legislative Assembly from 2005 until his retirement on 9 March 2013. Tom served first as a minister, albeit briefly, in the Lawrence Labor Government from 1992 to 1993 and then in the Gallop government from 2001 to 2004. Stephens was first elected to the Legislative Council at a 1982 by-election for the seat of North Province, sparked by the resignation of Liberal MLC Bill Withers. He was re-elected for North Province in 1983, and then in 1989 for the redistributed seat of the new Mining and Pastoral electoral region. He was re-elected in Mining and Pastoral in 1993, 1996 and 2001. Stephens served as a parliamentary secretary and as a minister in the Lawrence government in the 1990s; he was Leader of the Labor Opposition in the Legislative Council until the 2001 election of the new Labor government under Geoff Gallop, when he was elected into the ministry. He initially served as Minister for Housing and Works, and then later added Local Government and Regional Development to his portfolios. He also held the portfolios of the Kimberley, Pilbara and Gascoyne, Regional Development and Heritage. In late 2004, the Labor candidate for the rural seat of Kalgoorlie for the 2004 federal election, Kevin Richards, died suddenly during the final stages of that Federal campaign. Stephens, who was already preselected for the Legislative Assembly seat of Central Kimberley-Pilbara, was drafted as a last- minute replacement candidate for the Federal seat of Kalgoorlie. Stephens duly resigned from the WA State Cabinet and the WA Legislative Council, nominated and ran for that Federal seat; he was defeated at that contest by incumbent Liberal MP Barry Haase. Stephens subsequently contested and won the WA state seat of Central Kimberley Pilbara at the 2005 election. He chaired the Education and Health Standing Committee until September 2008 and was elected as Member for Pilbara at the October 2008 elections and served as a member of the Standing Committee on Community Development & Justice. Stephens retired from the WA State Parliament at the 9 March 2013 WA General Elections, aged 61, having served in the parliament for more than 30 years. Stephens served on the Boards of Good to Great Schools Australia (Noel Pearson's Education Reform agency), DSF-SPELD (WA), Lost & Found Opera, IBN and previously served on the Boad of Yindjibarndi CCL; Tom sings (as a Bass) with the University of Western Australia Choral Society and is an avid cyclist.

The Government stated that the GRC scheme was primarily implemented to enshrine minority representation in Parliament: at least one of the MPs in a GRC must be a member of the Malay, Indian or another minority community of Singapore. In addition, it was economical for town councils, which manage public housing estates, to handle larger constituencies. The GRC scheme came into effect on 1 June 1988. Prior to that date, all constituencies were Single Member Constituencies (SMCs). Now, the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap. 218, 2008 Rev. Ed.) (\\"PEA\\") states that there must be at least eight SMCs, and the number of MPs to be returned by all GRCs cannot be less than a quarter of the total number of MPs. Within those parameters the total number of SMCs and GRCs in Singapore and their boundaries are not fixed but are decided by the Cabinet, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee. According to the Constitution and the PEA, there must be between three and six MPs in a GRC. The precise number of MPs in each GRC is declared by the President at the Cabinet's direction prior to a general election. For the purposes of the 2020 general election, there will be 14 SMCs and 17 GRCs, and each GRC will have either four or five MPs. Critics disagree with the government's justifications for introducing the GRC scheme, noting that the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five-member and six-member GRCs. By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians, the ruling People's Action Party has also used GRCs as a means for bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more difficult for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics. Introduction of the scheme There are two types of electoral division or constituencyConstitution, Art. 39(3): \\"In this Article and in Articles 39A and 47, a constituency shall be construed as an electoral division for the purposes of Parliamentary elections.\\" in Singapore: the single member constituency (SMC) and the group representation constituency (GRC). In a GRC, a number of candidates comes together to stand for elections to Parliament as a group. Each voter of a GRC casts a ballot for a team of candidates, and not for individual candidates. The GRC scheme was brought into existence on 1 June 1988 by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1988. The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill (No. B 24 of 1987) was read in Parliament for the first time on 30 November 1987. The Second Reading took place on 12 January 1988, and it was referred to a select committee which presented its report on 5 May 1988. The bill was read for the third time and passed on 18 May 1988. It came into force on 31 May 1988. and the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 1988.. The Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill (No. B 23 of 1987) had its First and Second Readings on 30 November 1987 and 11‚Äì12 February 1988 respectively. Like the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, it was committed to a select committee which rendered its report on 5 May 1988. The bill was read for a third time and passed on 18 May 1988 and came into force on 1 June 1988, a day after the 1988 Act amending the Constitution commenced. First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong (pictured here in June 2001) supported GRCs on the ground that they would ensure that Parliament always remained multiracial The original stated purpose of GRCs was to guarantee a minimum representation of minorities in Parliament and ensure that there would always be a multiracial Parliament instead of one made up of a single race. Speaking in Parliament during the debate on whether GRCs should be introduced, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Goh Chok Tong said he had first discussed the necessity of ensuring the multiracial nature of Parliament with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in July 1982. Then, Lee had expressed concern about the voting patterns of younger Singaporeans, who appeared to be apathetic to the need of having a racially balanced slate of candidates. He was also worried about more Singaporeans voting along racial lines, which would lead to a lack of minority representation in Parliament.. He had also proposed to twin constituencies and have Members of Parliament (MPs) contest as a pair, one of whom had to be from a minority community. However, Malay MPs were upset that this implied they were not electable on their own merits. Feeling that the twinning of constituencies would lead to Malay MPs losing confidence and self-respect, the Government dropped the proposal.Goh, Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill, cols. 180‚Äì183; . Therefore, the Government felt that the best way to ensure minority representation in Parliament was to introduce the GRC scheme. In addition, it took the view that such a scheme would complement the introduction of town councils to manage public housing estates, as it would be economical for a town council to manage a group of three constituencies.Goh, Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill, cols. 183‚Äì184. Subsequently, in 1991, the Government said that GRCs also minimized the need to redraw the boundaries of constituencies which had grown too big for the MPs serving them, and, in 1996, GRCs were said to provide Community Development Councils with the critical mass of residents that they needed to be effective.. Three proposals for minority representation in Parliament had been considered by a 1966 Constitutional Commission chaired by the Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin. The first was to have a committee of representatives of minorities that would elect three persons from amongst its members to represent minorities in Parliament., para. 46(1). However, this was rejected as the Commission felt that it would be an inappropriate and retrogressive move in that unelected members should not be allowed to dilute the elected chamber.Constitutional Commission, 1966, para. 47. The second proposal, which was to have proportional representation,Constitutional Commission, 1966, para. 46(2). was also rejected on the grounds that it would intensify party politics along racial lines and eventually \\"perpetuate and accentuate racial differences\\". This would then make it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to achieve a single homogeneous community out of the many races that form the population of the Republic.Constitutional Commission, 1966, para. 48. The third proposal was to have an upper house in Parliament composed of members elected or nominated to represent the racial, linguistic and religious minorities in Singapore.Constitutional Commission, 1966, para. 46(3). However, this was rejected as being backward-looking since politicians should attain a seat in Parliament through taking part in elections.Constitutional Commission, 1966, para. 49. Operation =Number and boundaries of electoral divisions= Apart from the requirement that there must be at least eight SMCs, (\\"PEA\\"), s. 8A(1A). the total number of SMCs and GRCs in Singapore and their boundaries are not fixed. The number of electoral divisions and their names and boundaries are specified by the Prime Minister from time to time by notification in the Government Gazette.PEA, ss. 8(1) and (2). 2011 general election Since 1954, a year ahead of the 1955 general election, an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has been appointed to advise the executive on the number and geographical division of electoral divisions. Even though neither the Constitution nor any law requires this to be done, the Prime Minister has continued to do so from Singapore's independence in 1965. This is generally done just before a general election to review the boundaries of electoral divisions and recommend changes. In recent decades, the Committee has been chaired by the Cabinet Secretary and has had four other members who are senior public servants. In the EBRC appointed before the general election of 2006, these were the head of the Elections Department, the Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Land Authority, the Deputy CEO of the Housing and Development Board and the Acting Chief Statistician... Since the Committee is only convened shortly before general elections, the preparatory work for boundary delimitation is done by its secretariat the Elections Department, which is a division of the Prime Minister's Office.Li, \\"Making sense of electoral boundaries\\", p. A38. The EBRC's terms of reference are issued by the Prime Minister, and are not embodied in legislation. In giving recommendations for boundary changes over the years, the Committee has considered various factors, including using hill ridges, rivers and roads as boundaries rather than arbitrarily drawn lines; and the need for electoral divisions to have approximately equal numbers of voters so that electors' votes carry the same weight regardless of where they cast their ballots. In 1963, the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions to differ by no more than 20%. The permitted deviation was increased to 30% in 1980. It is up to the Cabinet to decide whether or not to accept the Committee's recommendations.Li, \\"Making sense of electoral boundaries\\", pp. A38‚ÄìA39. =Requirements of GRCs= Yaacob Ibrahim, Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Vivian Balakrishnan, three Cabinet ministers in the 11th Parliament from minority communities who were elected through GRCs All the candidates in a GRC must either be members of the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group,Constitution, Art. 39A(2)(c); PEA, s. 27A(3). and at least one of the candidates must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community.Constitution, Art. 39A(2)(a), PEA, s. 27A(4). A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such.Constitution, Art. 39A(4); PEA, s. 27A(8). The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee.PEA, ss. 27C(1)‚Äì(3). Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.PEA, s. 27C(8). The President, at the Cabinet's direction, declares the electoral divisions that are to be GRCs; the number of candidates (three to six)Constitution, Art. 39A(1)(a); PEA, s. 8A(1)(a). to stand for Parliament in each GRC; and whether the minority candidates in each GRC are to be from the Malay, Indian, or other minority communities.PEA, ss. 8A(1)(a) and (b). The number of GRCs in which at least one MP must be from the Malay community must be three-fifths of the total number of GRCs,If the three-fifths figure is not a whole number, it is rounded to the next higher whole number: PEA, s. 8A(3). and the number of MPs to be returned by all GRCs cannot be less than a quarter of the total number of MPs to be returned at a general election.PEA, s. 8A(2). For the 2011 general election, there were 12 SMCs and 15 GRCs.. An electoral division which is a GRC returns the number of MPs designated for the constituency by the President to serve in Parliament.PEA, s. 22. A group of individuals standing together in a GRC is voted for as a team, and not as individual candidates. In other words, a successful voter's single vote in an SMC sends to Parliament one MP, and a GRC sends a group of MPs depending on how many have been designated for that GRC. All elected MPs are selected on a simple plurality voting (\\"first past the post\\") basis.See, for instance, the PEA, s. 49(7E)(a): \\"... the Returning Officer shall declare the candidate or (as the case may be) group of candidates to whom the greatest number of votes is given to be elected\\". A by-election need not be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, even if there are no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats.PEA, s. 24(2A).. On the other hand, in the Vellama case, the Court of Appeal held that the Prime Minister has a duty to call a by-election when a casual vacancy arises in a Single Member Constituency: Vellama, p. 38, para. 79. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time,, s. 52. unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.Vellama, p. 35, para. 82. =Modifications= In 1988, 39 SMCs were grouped into 13 three-member GRCs, making up 39 out of a total of 81 elected seats in Parliament. The Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were changed in 1991; . and again in 1996; . to increase the maximum number of MPs in each GRC from three to four, and then to six. In the 2001 general election, three- and four-member GRCs were replaced by five- and six-member GRCs. There were nine five-member GRCs and five six-member GRCs, making up 75 out of the 84 elected seats in Parliament. This arrangement remained unchanged at the 2006 elections.Parliamentary Elections (Declaration of Group Representation Constituencies) Order 2006 (S 146/2006); . On 27 May 2009, the Government announced that it would refine the size and number of GRCs. This could be achieved without amending either the Constitution or the Parliamentary Elections Act. Instead, when the next EBRC was appointed, its terms of reference would instruct the Committee to plan for fewer six-member GRCs than at present, and to reduce the average size of each GRC. The average size of GRCs at that time was 5.4 MPs because there were only five-member and six- member GRCs. The new average, however, would not exceed five MPs. In addition, to ensure that the number of SMCs kept pace with the increase in voters and hence the number of MPs, the EBRC's terms of reference would state that there should be at least 12 SMCs. The rationale given for these changes was that the GRC scheme would work better and the link between voters and their MPs would be strengthened. In the 2011 general election, SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs. Assessment Parliament House (left, with semicircular driveway) =Advantages= As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the presence of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament.The Constitution, Art. 39A(1), states: \\"The Legislature may, in order to ensure the representation in Parliament of Members from the Malay, Indian and other minority communities, by law make provision for ... any constituency to be declared by the President, having regard to the number of electors in that constituency, as a group representation constituency to enable any election in that constituency to be held on a basis of a group of not less than 3 but not more than 6 candidates\\". Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed.. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, and the fact that there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views. =Criticisms of the scheme= Diversion from original purpose The official justification for the GRC scheme is to entrench minority representation in Parliament. However, opposition parties have questioned the usefulness of GRCs in fulfilling this purpose, especially since Singapore has not faced the issue of minorities being under-represented in Parliament. In fact, statistics show that all PAP minority candidates have won regularly and that the only two MPs to lose their seats in 1984 were Chinese. One of them was beaten by a minority candidate.. In addition, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won a by-election in 1981 at Anson, a largely Chinese constituency, and the first elected Chief Minister of Singapore was David Marshall who was Jewish. Technically, as the size of GRCs has increased, the minority has had less representation overall as the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has been reduced. Since minority MPs are a numerical minority in Parliament, their political clout has also been reduced.. In February 2017, then-Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing said that if a minority candidate leaves their group representation constituency (GRC), a by-election will not be called. Chan claimed that the goals of having enough minority members in Parliament, and to ensure no political campaign on issues of race and religion, would still be met even if the minority member of the GRC left. Furthermore, the GRC scheme is now used as a recruiting tool for the PAP. In 2006, Goh Chok Tong stated, \\"Without some assurance of a good chance of winning at least their first election, many able and successful young Singaporeans may not risk their careers to join politics\\".. Indeed, every PAP GRC team is helmed by a major figure such as a minister, and this allows new candidates to ride on the coat-tails of the experienced PAP members. Since 1991, the PAP has generally not fielded first- time candidates in SMC wards. On the other hand, one of the \\"in-built weaknesses\\" of GRCs may be that \\"through no fault of their own or that of their team\\", \\"high-value\\" MPs can be voted out; this was said to have occurred when former Minister for Foreign Affairs George Yeo lost his parliamentary seat to a Workers' Party of Singapore team in Aljunied GRC at the 2011 general election.. It is also said that GRCs serve more as administrative tools than to ensure minority representation. The size of GRCs was increased to take advantage of economies of scale when managing the wards. However, whether GRCs are required for this purpose is arguable, as Goh Chok Tong stated in 1988 that MPs in SMCs could still group together after elections to enjoy economies of scale.Quoted in Opposition parties disadvantaged The Elections Department (building pictured) is responsible for managing the conduct of elections in Singapore The GRC scheme has also been criticized for raising the bar for the opposition in elections. First, opposition parties may find it harder to find competent candidates, including minority candidates, to form teams to contest GRCs. Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme benefits the PAP as they can put together stronger teams.. With the GRC system the threshold for votes for the opposition is also increased, and opposition parties have to take a gamble and commit huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs. Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election, rounded to the nearest S$500.PEA, s. 28(1). At the 2011 general election, the deposit was $16,000.Notice of Election for All Electoral Divisions (Gazette Notification (G.N.) No. 1064/2011) dated 19 April 2011, archived from the original on 9 May 2011. Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one-eighth of the total number of votes polled in the GRC.PEA, s. 28(4A)(b). Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs. To date, only one opposition party, the Workers' Party, has won GRCs: Aljunied, in the 2011 general election, and Sengkang, in the 2020 general election.; . Creation of unequal voting power GRCs have been criticized as creating unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP that he or she does not like.. The situation is compounded by the fact that a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.. Weakening of voter‚ÄìMP relationship Critics have noted that the credibility and accountability of some candidates may be reduced because in a GRC the members of the team who are popular \\"protect\\" less popular members from being voted out. It has been said that the relationship between the electorate and their representatives is also weakened, because the relationship is between the individual and the GRC team rather than between the individual and a particular MP.. Improving the link between voters and MPs, and to make the latter more accountable was the reason for the changes proposed in 2009 to introduce more SMCs and to reduce the size of GRCs. Enshrining of racialism Even though the GRC scheme is intended to ensure minority representation in Parliament, it can be said that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.. Law of large numbers Derek da Cunha has proposed that the law of large numbers favours the GRC system. According to the theory, the large number of voters from GRC wards generally, though not necessarily always, reflects the popular vote. This was evident at the 2006 elections, at which the PAP garnered an average of 67.04% of the votes in a contested GRC, while the average was 61.67% for a SMC ward. The national average for the 2006 elections was 66.6%. Similar trends can be seen from previous elections. In fact, the percentage difference in the PAP votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3% in 1991, and remained stable at around 5% in the 1997, 2001 and 2006 elections. This may be attributable to the enlargement of the size of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to the law of large numbers..

Career In 1972, he qualified as a referee, progressing through the Leicestershire Senior League and the Southern League. He became a Football League linesman in 1984, graduating to the Football League referees list three years later, at the age of only twenty nine. His major breakthrough came in 1994. He was one of three new referees appointed to the Premier List along with fellow Leicestershire official Peter Jones and Gary Willard from Sussex. Over the next three seasons all his league games were at Premiership level (as was standard for Premiership referees at the time). However, his performances did not always find favour ‚Äì most notably a game at Highbury between Arsenal and Sunderland on 28 September 1996,‚Ä† when two away players and the Sunderland manager were sent off before half-time.Arsenal v. Sunderland, Premier League, 1996: soccerbase.com website. Retrieved on 27 March 2008. At the end of the 1996‚Äì97 season he was dropped from the Premier List and reverted to Football League level. For the next few years he was one of its senior officials, often receiving key appointments such as an old First Division play-off semi-final on 17 May 2001 at Deepdale, where Preston beat Birmingham after extra-time and penalties (Preston had already missed a spot-kick during the regulation 90 minutes).First Division play-off semi-final, 2001: soccerbase.com website.

Following a Football League Championship match between Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion at Selhurst Park on 20 September 2003, he had to attend hospital in Croydon (Surrey) for treatment, due to being hit in the mouth and rendered unconscious whilst dealing with a three-man altercation on the pitch during the match, which ended 2‚Äì2 and generated eight cautions.Injury to his mouth, Crystal Palace v.

He refereed only three games in the top division of the Football League and was largely on lower division duty. At the end of that season he lost his place on the League List after a tenure of eighteen years. Potentially he could have had another two years before retirement and had that happened he would have completed twenty years and become the longest-serving referee since the 1920s.‚Ä° However, he did gain experience in Europe as a fourth official and assistant referee. He returned to the assistants' list for the first time since 1987, although he did handle three games as a referee in the Football Conference North in season 2005‚Äì06 before finishing his top-class career completely.

Early life and education Chen was born in Jieyang, Guangdong, China, and had his early education at Chen Li Primary School and St. Joseph Middle School. After graduation from secondary school, Chen decided to study full-time in fine art at the Shanghai College of Art in 1928, despite his uncle's objection. Unhappy with the college, Chen transferred to the Xinhua College of Art in Shanghai, where he was taught by renowned artists such as Pan Tianshou, with half of his classmates a year later. It was at Xinhua where he became acquainted with Chen Jen Hao, Chen Chong Swee and Liu Kang, all of whom were to become Singapore's Nanyang pioneer artists and art educationists. After four years at Xinhua, Chen graduated and returned to Jieyang. Career After getting married in Jieyang, Chen went to Shantou in 1929, at the age of 21. His work was exhibited in Shanghai (1931, 1933) and Guangzhou (1932, 1936). In 1937, he received recognition and praise of Chinese painter Xu Beihong at the second Chinese National Art Exhibition in Nanjing. In the same year, an English arts magazine elected him as one of contemporary China's ten greatest artists. He left China in 1947 and had further exhibitions in Saigon (1948), Hong Kong (1949), Bangkok ‚Äì Kuala Lumpur (1949), and Bangkok-Singapore (1950). In 1948, Chen arrived in Singapore, where he originally planned to stay for not more than three months. After his visa expired he was convinced by fellow artists such as Liu Kang, and then commissioner general Malcolm MacDonald to stay. In Singapore, he proceeded to teach art at The Chinese High School (1949‚Äì1968) and the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (1951‚Äì1959). Chen travelled to various places in Southeast Asia to collect drawing materials during his vacations, and he was especially inspired by the people and customs of Bali and Java. In June 1955, Chen took part in a seven-artist group exhibition organised by the Singapore Art Society. In 1968, Chen retired from teaching, and decided to concentrate on drawing. Between 1923 and 1992, he conducted 38 one-man exhibitions in Singapore and other countries such as China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. Style Chen was proficient in both traditional Chinese ink and Western oil painting, and experimented with a variety of styles ranging from Fauvism to Cubism. In Chen's exhibition held in May 1956, Sullivan noted his fascination for man-made things and clutter. The artist loved to experiment with the interplay of light and forms in chaotic subjects, like a junkyard. His unique style which showed interest in angles but not Cubist; strays not far from reality and is obsessed with shapes, and yet not an abstract painter. Chen also did not take to modern western art philosophies of that by western counterparts of his time like Picasso and Salvador Dal√≠. Chen was also interested in human figures. He also did not see that humans are complex with distortions and conflicts, but merely a pattern of images, yet not like a pieced jigsaw puzzle. His interest was especially in local Indian people, particularly blue-collared workers and dairymen working in cattleyard; the geometric forms of Indian women dancers was an ideal subject of study for the artist. Chen's mastery in depicting human figures was also found in keen observation of nature and animals. His subjects include landscapes, figures, birds and animals, still life studies and abstract compositions. Chen was especially adept at drawing egrets and monkeys. Among all the animal paintings by him, Chen's gibbon paintings stand out, as they were noted by Chen's attention to detail and sensitive rendering of the beautiful creatures. His first inspiration from painting gibbons came from a reproduction of a gibbon painting that formed the right triptych of the famous painting, White Robed Guanyin, Crane and Gibbon by the 13th-century Southern Song dynasty artist Muqi. Awed by its lifelike quality, he was convinced with Muqi's great skill in close observation of the gibbons. So day and night, Chen studied Muqi's print and emulated the painting. Chen had never seen a gibbon when he was in China, and as a result he did not realise that gibbons, unlike monkeys, lacked tails. It was only much later in the late-1940s, that a foreigner pointed out his error in his painting, and corrected him. Around that time, he had bought a white faced gibbon for $300 at a local pet shop shortly after he arrived in Singapore. This gave him immense opportunities to study the creature's postures and its characteristics, by rearing it in his home garden. In time, Chen had a total of six pet gibbons ‚Äì one white, one grey and four black ones. Honours For his contributions to the fine arts in Singapore, President Yusof Ishak conferred Chen the Public Service Star in 1964. Chen's artistic endeavours have also made history by being the first artist with a number of first honours conferred on him. In 1975, Chen was conferred an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the then-Chancellor of the University of Singapore, and President of Singapore, Benjamin Sheares. In 1980, he became the first Singaporean artist to be invited, and conferred with the Golden Chapter gold medal award, by the National Museum of History in Taiwan. He was also the first recipient of the ASEAN Cultural and Communications Award for outstanding artists, in 1987. After his death in 1991 at age 87, Chen was awarded a posthumous Meritorious Service Medal.

Located on Castle Island, Fort Independence is one of the oldest continuously fortified sites of English origin in the United States.Wilson, 312.Fort Constitution at NorthAmericanForts.com The first primitive fortification, called \\"The Castle\\", was placed on the site in 1634 and, after two re-buildings, replaced circa 1692 with a more substantial structure known as Castle William.Roberts, pp. 402-404 Re-built after it was abandoned by the British during the American Revolution, Castle William was renamed Fort Adams and then Fort Independence. The existing granite fort was constructed between 1833 and 1851. Today it is preserved as a state park and fires occasional ceremonial salutes. Fort Independence was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation History =Castle William= Commander at Castle William William Brattle (1745) The site of Fort Independence has been occupied by various fortifications since 1634.Wilson, 313. The first fort to be constructed on Castle Island resulted from a visit by Governor John Winthrop; it was partly financed by him and the council. Construction was planned and supervised by Deputy Gov. Roger Ludlow and Captain John Mason of Dorchester, producing a \\"castle with mud walls\\" with masonry of oyster shell lime, in which cannon were mounted to defend the colonial town of Boston from attack by sea. The first commander of the fort was Captain Nicholas Simpkins in 1634.This information is taken from Nicholas Simpkins' biography and from the town history of Yarmouth, MA The first fort soon fell into disrepair and was rebuilt, mainly out of timber, in 1644 following a scare due to the arrival of a French warship in the harbor. The fort was reconstructed out of pine logs, stone, and earth, with 10-foot walls around a compound 50 feet square. The fort mounted six saker cannons and three smaller guns.Shurtleff, 478. A later commander of the fort was Captain Richard Davenport, who supervised the post from 1645 until 1665 when he was struck by lightning within the fort and killed.Shurtleff, 490. His successor, Captain Roger Clap, commanded the fort from 1665-1686. On 21 March 1673 the fort was destroyed by an accidental fire. It was rebuilt the next year in stone, with 38 guns and 16 culverins in the four-bastion main fort, along with six guns in a water battery. In 1689, following the Glorious Revolution in England, in which James II was replaced by William III, Governor Edmund Andros, a supporter of James II, was confined in the fort and sent to England to stand trial. Under Governor Sir William Phips, appointed by William III in 1692, the fort was renamed \\"Castle William\\" and re-built again. The new work had 54 cannon: 24 9-pounders, 12 24-pounders, and a total of 18 32- and 48-pounders. From 1701 to 1703 the fort was further expanded. The new fort was designed by Wolfgang William Romer, the chief engineer of British forces in the American colonies.Shurtleff, p. 493 Its armament was nearly doubled to 100 guns. In 1740 a fifth bastion was added, mounting 20 42-pounders. In the years leading up to the American Revolution, Castle William became a refuge for British officials during periods of unrest and rioting in Boston. Violence in the wake of events such as the Stamp Act crisis in 1765 and the Boston Massacre in 1770 forced provincial leaders and British soldiers to take shelter within the fort. In September 1765 the stamps to be issued under the Stamp Act were kept at the fort. As the American Revolution erupted in 1775, American forces quickly commenced the Siege of Boston and British forces made Castle William their primary stronghold. It was not until the Continental Army led by George Washington managed the fortification of Dorchester Heights that Castle William was threatened and the British evacuated Boston in March 1776. Before leaving Castle William, the British set fire to the fort, damaging or destroying it and its ordnance as best they could.Kales, 49. During the Revolutionary War, a fort called Fort Independence was built on Point Allerton in Hull. In 1797 the name was transferred to the former Castle William, apparently leaving the fort in Hull without a name. That fort fell into disuse after the War of 1812, or perhaps before. The site in Hull was named Fort Revere with a new fort built in the late 19th century.Fort Independence (1) at American Forts Network =Fort Adams= A re-built Castle William, also known at that time as Fort Adams, shortly after the American RevolutionAfter it was evacuated, the fort was quickly re-built by American forces in 1776. Although still referred to, at times, as Castle William, the fort was officially known as Fort Adams in the years following the Revolution. In 1785, the legislature of Massachusetts designated the fort as a prison, in which capacity it served until 1805.Shurtleff, 495-496. On 7 December 1797 (1799 in some sources), the fort was renamed Fort Independence during a ceremony attended by President John Adams.The Fort Adams name was then used for a fort in Newport, Rhode Island. The following year, the fortification and the island were turned over to the United States government. The fort was re-built and expanded in 1800-1803 under the first system of US fortifications (some sources place it in the second system), as designed by French-born military engineer Jean Foncin.Fort Independence (2) at American Forts NetworkFort Independence at FortWiki.comParkman, p. 10 The Secretary of War's report on fortifications for December 1811 describes the fort as \\"...a regular pentagon, with bastions of masonry, mounting 42 heavy cannon, with two [additional] batteries for six guns...\\".Wade, p. 242 During the War of 1812, a squadron of the British Royal Navy repeatedly captured American merchant and fishing vessels in Massachusetts Bay; however, they never attempted an attack on the port of Boston owing largely to the strength of Fort Independence.Kales, 57. Colonel John Breck, namesake of Brecksville, Ohio, was the Commandant of Fort Independence during the War of 1812. =Existing structure= Fort Independence map in 1883 study for a plan of Pleasure Bay Fort IndependenceWork on the present fort was to begin in 1833 under the third system of US fortifications, supervised by Colonel Sylvanus Thayer, one of the nation's leading military engineers of the time. However, commencement was delayed until 1836 due to funding problems cause by an inflation spike.Parkman, pp. 19-20 The new fort would have walls high and thick. It was constructed primarily out of granite from Rockport, Massachusetts. The re- built fort was substantially complete by 1848, although repairs and other work continued until 1861. At the height of its strength during the American Civil War, the fort mounted 96 cannon, some of which were 15-inch Rodman guns capable of firing a 450-pound shot more than .Wilson, 315.Weaver, pp. 111‚Äì114 A small part of Castle William's brick structure remains in the rear portion of the present fort, but is covered up by subsequent stonework. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Fort Independence was garrisoned by the Fourth Battalion Massachusetts Volunteer Militia. The battalion set the fort in order and were trained in infantry and artillery drill, eventually forming the nucleus of the 24th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. At least two other infantry regiments were trained at Fort Independence during the Civil War‚Äîthe 11th Massachusetts and the 13th Massachusetts.Kales, 76. Following the Civil War, Fort Independence gradually fell out of use, as its importance was reduced by the larger Fort Warren which had also been constructed under the direction of Sylvanus Thayer. In the 1880s, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted designed a series of parkways and parks in Boston known as the Emerald Necklace. Olmsted had originally envisioned a parkway to be known as the Dorchesterway that would connect Castle Island (via a new earthen causeway) to the rest of the Emerald Necklace. The Dorchesterway was never realized; however, the city of Boston did undertake a large-scale project in the 1890s to create a park-like environment around Fort Independence. In 1890, Castle Island (excluding the fort) was ceded by the United States government. The city of Boston commenced filling the marshes separating Castle Island from South Boston in 1890 with the intention of creating green space and promenades. The process was finished in the 1920s and Castle Island ceased to be an island. The fort itself was ceded by the federal government to the city of Boston in 1908.Seasholes, 326. Castle Island and Fort Independence commanding the approach to modern Boston Harbor In 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the U.S. government briefly reclaimed Castle Island, however it was quickly returned to the city of Boston in 1899. The military again took control of Fort Independence during World War I and World War II and anti-aircraft guns were added. During World War I, the fort was used primarily as a depot for small arms ammunition and during World War II, it was used by the United States Navy as a degaussing station for de-magnetizing the hulls of ships. At the close of both conflicts, the fort was promptly returned to the custody of the city of Boston.Kales, 111 and 123. In 1962, the U.S. government permanently deeded Castle Island and Fort Independence to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It is now overseen by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation and the non-profit Castle Island Association. Over the course of its history, a shot was never fired in anger from Fort Independence by United States forces. Edgar Allan Poe and a duel A persistent, though mostly apocryphal, story involving Fort Independence was allegedly the inspiration behind one of Edgar Allan Poe's most well known works. A monument outside the west battery of the fort marks the former site of the grave of Lieutenant Robert F. Massie, who was killed in a sword duel with Lieutenant Gustavus Drane at the fort on December 25, 1817. According to folklorist Edward Rowe Snow, Massie was so popular with the soldiers stationed at Fort Independence that they took out their frustration on his killer, Lieutenant Drane, by walling him up within a vault in the fort. Edgar Allan Poe, while serving with the 1st United States Artillery Regiment at Fort Independence in 1827, purportedly heard the tale and was inspired by it, according to Snow, to write \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\".Wilson, 317. The legend that purportedly inspired Poe is not, however, entirely accurate. The duel did, in fact, take place, but the victor, Lieutenant Drane, was not murdered by the fort's soldiers. Drane, instead, continued in his military career, was later promoted to the rank of captain and died on active duty in 1846. After World War II, Lieutenant Massie's remains were moved to the Fort Devens Cemetery near the town of Ayer.Heitman, Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army 1789 - 1903.

The line between them had been closed in 1970.  History of the Skipton‚ÄìColne line  The line between Skipton and Colne was opened in October 1848, part of the Leeds and Bradford Railway's Shipley to Colne extension and at a cost of ¬£67,000 (). With the East Lancashire Railway reaching Colne from Burnley in February 1849 and the completion of the Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway in April 1849, a through route from Leeds to Liverpool was then established. Stations between Skipton and Colne were built at Elslack, Thornton-in-Craven, Earby and Foulridge. A branch from Earby to Barnoldswick was opened in 1871. The Skipton‚ÄìColne line was not listed for closure as part of Dr Beeching's 1963 \\"The Reshaping of British Railway's\\" report, however the line closed in February 1970 (with the Barnoldswick branch having earlier closed in September 1965).  Skipton‚ÄìColne and the East Lancashire line  \\"The Missing Link\\" - the 11.5 mile missing line between Skipton and Colne, also showing other railway lines in the area. The missing section of railway between Skipton and Colne is in length. The remaining East Lancashire line serves a conurbation of some half a million people. It is relatively under- utilised, and it is under-developed from an engineering point of view. Colne is currently served by one train per hour which traverses the East Lancashire Line from Blackpool South railway station via Preston, Blackburn and Burnley, with many station stops at intermediate towns and with a total journey time in excess of 100 minutes. The route is affected by numerous permanent speed restrictions, particularly at junctions. The service is currently operated by Northern, with services operating using Class 142 or Class 150 Diesel Multiple Units. Skipton is on the Airedale line and is served by frequent electric trains which serve Leeds every 30 minutes, with a journey time of around 40 minutes, and Bradford Forster Square every 30 minutes, with a journey time of around 35 minutes. These services are also operated by Northern, using a mixture of Class 321, 322 and 333 Electric Multiple Units. Northern also operate services from Leeds to Lancaster, Morecambe and Heysham Port, as well as services to Carlisle (on the Settle‚ÄìCarlisle line), all of which serve Skipton. Skipton also has a direct return service to London Kings Cross operated by London North Eastern Railway (06.55 from Skipton, 18.03 from London).  Reinstatement proposal  Reinstatement of Colne‚ÄìSkipton would provide scope for both local and regional rail services. SELRAP say the line will deliver a number of benefits to local communities, the Northwest and the UK as a whole. SELRAP's proposals include opening at least one station between Skipton and Colne. The number and precise location(s) will depend on the viability study required. Whilst SELRAP are in favour of only one intermediate station (West Craven Parkway) in the interim, the Campaign for Better Transport are also wanting to see railway station re-opened too. A 2003 study commissioned by Lancashire and North Yorkshire County Councils from consultants Steer Davies Gleave found that the formation was largely intact and there were no insurmountable obstacles to reinstatement of the line. In 2007 SELRAP commissioned a study by JMP Consultants to further assess the business case. This appraisal showed that a positive benefit cost ratio would be achieved for a single track option under most growth and cost scenarios. A double track railway achieves a positive benefit cost ratio if recent trends of accelerating demand growth are assumed to continue. Craven District Council and Pendle Borough Council are the two planning authorities within which the track-bed lies. Craven District Council protects the track-bed for transport use under planning policy SP2. Pendle Local Plan also protects the track-bed under policy ENV4. At the county level, the Lancashire LEP board \\"Noted the robust and compelling case that the independent study by Cushman & Wakefield makes for enhanced East-West connectivity to realise the full economic potential of the Central Trans-Pennine Corridor and its role in delivering the long-term growth ambitions of the wider Northern Powerhouse\\". Though not affected to the same degree, re-instatement is supported in North Yorkshire Local Transport Plan (LTP4) 2016 to 2045, and by West Yorkshire Combined Authority. The Route Utilisation Strategy (RUS) from Network Rail gave way to the Long Term Planning Process (LTPP) which in turn is being replaced in the north of England by the Strategic Transport Plan (STP) from Transport for the North. The section of the STP that applies is the Central Pennine Corridor. On 3 February 2018, the Transport Secretary announced a feasibility study into reopening the route to passengers once again as part of the Government's plan to invite proposals to reopen many lines closed under British Rail. The study will be commissioned by Transport for the North and Network Rail and conclude later in 2018. The announcement was made at Colne station and covered in the press. Chris Grayling announced in January 2019 that the initial study declared the project \\"technically feasible\\". The next step was to prove the worthiness of the re-opening by the commissioning of a business case which would look at the prospect of freight services on the line making the project \\"commercially feasible\\". This line has been identified by Campaign for a Better Transport as a priority 1 candidate for reopening, with support also being voiced by local and regional businesses. David Cutter, the chief executive of Skipton Building Society, said that reopening of the line would improve connectivity between East Lancashire and North and West Yorkshire. It is estimated that over 1,600 personnel who work at Skipton Building Society's headquarters in Skipton have a Lancashire postcode.

Boeck inden welcken ghy in vinden sult. Veelderhande liedekens (a nice songbook in which you will find several songs) was published in Antwerp in 1544 by printer Jan Roulans. History Frontispiece of the Antwerp songbook (1544) The songbook includes lyrics of some 221 'old' and 'new' Dutch songs (Oude en nyeuwe) to banish sadness and melancholy (Om droefheyt ende melancolie te verdrijuen), with reference to the tune to which it was sung but without any musical notation. At least five editions of the songbook are known: folio's from two probably older editions survived as reinforcement of the cover of other books while the structure of the preserved copy implicates that two earlier editions have existed. Thus, only one edition is preserved in one copy only, collected by Duke August von Braunschweig-Wolfenb√ºttel and conserved in the Herzog August Bibliothek (the library also known as Bibliotheca Augusta) in Wolfenb√ºttel. The reason why only one copy survived must be that two years after publication this songbook was put on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, the index of forbidden literature of the Catholic Church's infamous Inquisition. The printer died later on in prison, where he was held because of having printed clandestine literature. Not that much the political songs, in favour of the House of Habsburg, but rather the songs about depraved and licentious monks and nuns might have disturbed the Inquisition. Probably, the few copies left in the Netherlands after the songbook was put on the index, were destroyed by French librarians eager to make disappear every trace of Flemish culture in the Southern Netherlands. The only copy left of the small booklet was discovered in the library of Wolfenb√ºttel by Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben who provided also the first modern edition in 1855. A more recent complete edition of the songbook, with the tunes referred to in some 142 songs and found in other songbooks of the period, appeared in 2004 with a double cd by Camerata Trajectina. The Antwerp songbook is the first printed large collection of Dutch songs known, to have survived the centuries. Many songs had been transmitted through oral tradition since the end of the Middle Ages: in those cases, the tune was referred to as an oudt liedeken, an old song. Many songs, printed for the first time in the Antwerp songbook, were already known for centuries by that time and were included in several songbooks and anthologies. The songs reflect life in the cosmopolitan port town Antwerp in the 16th century. Some songs, for instance, are Dutch versions of German songs while others were sung to French tunes.

They are alternatives to synthetic refrigerants such as hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) based refrigerants. Unlike other refrigerants, natural refrigerants are non- synthetic and can be found in nature. They are not only used due to their role in environmental sustainability but are also used because some applications are better suited to a particular natural refrigerant. Natural refrigerants cover a wide range of refrigeration uses and are sometimes more efficient than their synthetic counterparts. Natural refrigerants are being analyzed with an increased focus due to the environmentally damaging effects of synthetic refrigerants, and they will likely see an increase in usage in the coming years.  Benefits of natural refrigerants  HFC, HCFC, CFC classes of chemicals are all potent greenhouse gases. HCFC and CFC classes of chemicals are damaging to the ozone layer, with CFCs being a primary culprit. Natural refrigerants do not deplete the ozone layer and have a much lower impact on the environment. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) scale places the current refrigerants used‚ÄîHFCs, HCFCs, and CFCs‚Äîin the hundreds.https://www.ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/ghgp/Global-Warming- Potential-Values%20%28Feb%2016%202016%29_1.pdf In contrast, the GWPs of natural refrigerants is very minimal. The GWP scale is based on carbon dioxide, making it not only a good point of reference for other refrigerants, but also indicates that carbon dioxide itself is relatively harmless to the environment. Ammonia has an even lower GWP of zero, making it even better than carbon dioxide.  Refrigerants  = Hydrocarbons as refrigerants = Pure hydrogen compounds see moderate use in refrigeration. Hydrocarbons are a viable option as refrigerants because, besides providing cooling properties, they are also plentiful and energy efficient. They are rated to be up to 50% more energy efficient than synthetic refrigerants. Hydrocarbons are also environmentally friendly, as they exist in nature and rank low on the global warming potential (GWP) scale. Historically, hydrocarbons have mainly seen use as a refrigerant for industrial chilling and refrigeration, but with the current shift towards natural refrigerants they are starting to see an increase in use in other areas of refrigeration.https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/ASHRAE_PD_Natural_Refrigerants_2011.pdf The main detriment of using hydrocarbons as refrigerants is that they are extremely flammable at higher pressures. In the past, this risk was mitigated by turning hydrocarbons into CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs,https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/en-gtz-proklima- natural-refrigerants.pdf but with the increasing avoidance of such substances, the problem of flammability must be addressed. Refrigeration systems work by pressurizing the refrigerant to a point where it begins to display refrigerant properties, but with the risk of pressurizing hydrocarbons there is a higher level of caution needed for the internal pressure. Current safety measures regarding the usage of hydrocarbons are outlined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA guidelines of hydrocarbon usage as a refrigerant include specifically designating pressure ranges for hydrocarbon refrigerant systems, ensuring the removal of potentially fire-starting components from hydrocarbon refrigerant systems such as electrical components prone to sparking, and placing standards on the construction of the systems to ensure a higher level of safety. Hydrocarbons used as refrigerants: * Methane (CH4) [R-50] * Ethane (CH3CH3) [R-170] * Propane (CH3CH2CH3) [R-290] * Ethylene (CH2CH2) [R-1150] * n-butane (CH3CH2CH2CH3) [R-600] * Isobutane (CH(CH3)3) [R-600a] * Propylene (CH3CHCH2) [R-1270] * Pentane (CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3) [R-601] * Isopentane (CH(CH3)2CH2CH3) [R-601a] * Cyclopentane ((CH2)5) = Carbon dioxide as a refrigerant = Carbon dioxide has seen extensive use as a refrigerant. Carbon dioxide‚Äôs main advantage as a refrigerant stems from the fact that it is classified as an A1 refrigerant by the EPA, placing it in the least toxic and hazardous category for refrigerants. This makes carbon dioxide a viable refrigerant for systems that are used in areas where a leak could cause exposure. If a carbon dioxide refrigerant system were to leak, the carbon dioxide itself will not cause harm to anyone exposed to it. Carbon dioxide sees extensive use in large-scale refrigeration systems, sometimes via a cascade refrigeration system. It is also used sparingly in automotive refrigeration. Carbon dioxide has the benefit of being both plentiful and inexpensive. These factors have led to carbon dioxide being used as a refrigerant since 1850, when it was patented for use as a refrigerant in the United Kingdom.http://www.cold.org.gr/library/downloads/Docs/CO2%20_A%20refrigerant%20from%20the%20past%20with%20prospects%20of%20being%20one%20of%20the%20mai%20refrigerants%20in%20the%20future.pdf Carbon dioxide usage at the time was limited due to the high pressures required for refrigerant properties to manifest, but these pressures can be easily reached and sustained with current pressurization technology. The main concern over the use of carbon dioxide in refrigeration is the increased pressure required for carbon dioxide to act as a refrigerant. Carbon dioxide requires higher pressures to be able to condense within the cooling system, meaning that it has to be pressurized more than the other natural refrigerants. It can require up to 200 atmospheres to achieve adequate pressure for condensation. Refrigerant systems using carbon dioxide need to be built to withstand higher pressures. This prevents old coolant systems from being able to be retrofitted in order to use carbon dioxide. However, if carbon dioxide is used as a part of a cascade refrigeration system, it can be used at lower pressures. Using carbon dioxide in cascade refrigeration systems also means that the aforementioned benefits of availability and low price are applicable for a cascade system. = Ammonia as a refrigerant = Ammonia is used frequently in industrial refrigeration. It is considered to be an excellent refrigerant for a variety of reasons other than just its refrigeration quality. It is produced in massive quantities due to the fertilizer industry, making it relatively inexpensive. Its distinct smell allows for quick identification of leakage for repairs. It has a GWP of zero, making ammonia leaks negligible on the climate.https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/About/Position%20Documents/Ammonia- as-a-Refrigerant-PD-2017.pdf Similar to carbon dioxide, ammonia can also be used in cascade refrigeration systems in order to improve the efficiency of the refrigeration process. There is an increasing use of cascade refrigeration systems that contain both ammonia and carbon dioxide. The largest issue with ammonia usage in refrigeration is the potentially lethal symptoms of inhaling large amounts of ammonia. However, proper preparation and emergency protocols can mitigate these risks down to as little as one death per decade, according to the EPA. Although ammonia is lethal, exposure up to thirty minutes can be handled without lasting health effects. Ammonia‚Äôs distinct smell is also an indication of ammonia exposure, helping those exposed to protect themselves adequately. The minimal risks and the large benefits of ammonia has led to ammonia being used in approximately 15% of the refrigeration market. = Noble gases as refrigerants = The noble gases are rarely used as refrigerants. The primary uses of noble gases as refrigerants is in liquid super coolant experimental systems in laboratories or in superconductors. This specifically applies to liquid helium, which has a boiling point of 4.2 K. They are never used for industrial or home refrigeration. = Other natural refrigerants = These natural refrigerants are substances that can be used in refrigeration systems but are not used or are only used very rarely because of an availability of compounds that are either less expensive or are easier to handle and contain.  Oxygen compounds  * Diethyl ether/ethyl ether (\\"ether\\") (CH3CH2OCH2CH3) [R-610] (from dehydrogenation of ethanol; extremely flammable) * Methyl formate (HCOOCH3) [R-611] (from carbonylation of methanol, which usually both come from syngas; or by condensation of methanol; highly flammable) * Dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) [R-E170] (From dehydration of methanol which comes from syngas, natural gas or from some biofuels; highly flammable, medium toxicity)  Nitrogen compounds  * Methylamine (CH3NH2) [R-630] (from reaction of ammonia and methanol; medium toxicity; controlled substance) * Ethylamine (CH3CH2NH2) [R-631] (from reaction of ammonia and ethanol; very toxic)  Relevance of Natural Refrigerants  With an increasing international focus on climate change, many countries are imposing more and more restrictions on the use of environmentally damaging substances. CFC, HCFC, and HFC usage was heavily restricted by the Montreal Protocol in 1987. Current synthetic refrigeration substances are a likely target for such sanctions, as they are either damaging to the environment through global warming or ozone depletion. These synthetic chemicals are predicted to contribute at least 10% of the global warming caused by greenhouse gases. The increasing sanctioning of such refrigerants will lead to an increasing dependence on refrigerants that are not environmentally damaging, which is where natural refrigerants will likely be used to fill the gap. Ammonia already sees extensive usage in industrial refrigeration due to its large benefits and minimal drawbacks. Carbon dioxide was already stated to have a long history of usage and will likely see a resurgence in usage in the coming years due to the increased ease of pressurizing it to necessary levels, Hydrocarbon use as a refrigerant is currently minimal, but will likely see a rise in usage in smaller refrigeration systems, where low pressures are beneficial. As cryogenic research continues, noble gases will be used for their extremely low condensation point. Other natural refrigerants will likely not see a significant increase in usage due to their potential dangers or drawbacks, but they can be considered for use.

According to Fiona's biography from USA Network: Fiona works with Michael Westen, Sam Axe and since season 4, Jesse Porter, doing odd jobs, as well as working as an unlicensed bounty hunter and arms dealer. She is shown to be an explosives expert, marksman, and a precision driver. Overview Fiona first met Michael Westen when she was in Ireland with the IRA when he went undercover as Michael McBride. Despite their clashing personalities, the two eventually developed a romance, but it came to a sudden end when Michael left Fiona literally in the middle of the night, without a word because Michael's cover was blown. Due to Michael not updating his emergency contacts in years, Fiona picked up Michael Westen in Miami, Florida, after he was stranded there when he was burned because she was the only emergency contact; and she has since helped him numerous times in his various jobs. Now that she has encountered Michael again, Fiona makes efforts to pressure Michael into a more substantial relationship. Fiona also keeps in touch with Michael's mother, Madeline. In the early part of season 2, Fiona starts dating a paramedic named Campbell, and whilst it is never admitted it is believed her main reason for dating him was to drive Michael crazy that she was no longer available. However the relationship was ended by Campbell when he confronted Fiona about her lingering feelings for Michael, and she couldn't deny them. In season 3, episode 8, Fiona has had enough with Michael and walks out. Refusing to appear at a monitoring job, she doesn't turn up for Michael for the first time in the series. The reason was over Michael's choice to get back into the spy trade. In the season 3 summer finale, it is revealed that Fiona has five brothers, including an older one named Sean, and a younger sister named Claire, who was killed in The Troubles. Fiona has a tendency to shoot (or blow up) first and ask questions later. Her preferred method is going in with guns blazing or IEDs exploding, and Michael frequently has to hold her back. After spending time taking care of a child in season 1, Fiona becomes especially upset when someone abuses or endangers children. Fiona also has a certain vixen complex, frequently using her sex appeal to acquire information. Series creator Matt Nix has said about the characters' relationship: In the pilot episode, she spoke with an Irish accent; starting with \\"Identity\\", she has consistently spoken with an American accent as part of her effort to fit in with the Miami scene. Relationships =Michael= Michael Westen is by far the most important person in Fiona's life. They met while Michael was working undercover as Michael McBride in Dublin, Ireland, at which time Fiona was robbing banks for the IRA. They began a tumultuous relationship, one which Michael described as being \\"profoundly unhappy\\". In spite of the sometimes violent nature of their union, Fiona fell deeply in love with him; and he would later confess that he loved her as well. Their relationship ended when Michael's cover was blown, and he was forced to leave in the middle of the night, without explanation. They would later reconnect when Michael was dumped in Miami after he was \\"burned\\". Fiona immediately began trying to maneuver him into another relationship; and, though Michael makes efforts to keep her at arm's length, he reciprocates her feelings to a small degree. Fiona struck up a friendship with his mother, and she occasionally uses this as a means of spending more time with him. She also convinced Michael to give her a key to his apartment. They had sex in season 1 after Fiona initiated a physical sparring match with Michael to relieve her frustration with him, and they were both somewhat hesitant around each other the following morning. Whilst he did admit that he still cared for her, Michael was hesitant to restart their relationship. In season 2, Fiona tried to distance herself from Michael after she realized that he was making her his second priority, behind his desire to discover who \\"burned\\" him. She becomes involved in a frivolous relationship with a paramedic named Campbell, which caused Michael some slight twinges of jealousy...though not as much as Fiona would have liked. At this time, Michael began to stop taking her for granted as much; and they experience some very emotionally charged moments. Campbell ends their relationship then informs her that Michael was her \\"real boyfriend\\". Fiona is also introduced to Samantha Kees, a professional thief and Michael former-fianc√©e: they got engaged before Michaels mission to Ireland. Michael admits that whilst He and Samantha were similar in personality (hence the ease of their relationship), he was much more involved in his relationship with Fiona, simply saying that Fiona \\"knew a part of me that [Samantha] never did.\\", and that Michael ended their engagement because he was in love with Fiona. Soon thereafter, Michael becomes half-crazed with panic and grief after believing that Fiona died in a house fire while investigating a lead for him. He arrived back at his apartment to find Fiona alive and well. His relief at seeing her unharmed is so great that he embraces her and kisses her. In season 3, Fiona begins to grow disenchanted with Michael and his obsession with getting back into the spy game. She eventually becomes so fed up with him that she plans to return to Ireland. At that time, her brother Sean arrives to help her when she is targeted by an old nemesis from her past, a vicious explosives-maker named O'Neill who abducts Fiona and plans to return her to Europe to auction her off to some of her \\"old associates\\", who will certainly torture and kill her. When Michael and Sam stage a rescue, she is shot in the arm and leaps into the ocean, where she falls into unconsciousness. Michael pulls her out of the water and upon regaining her senses, she is forced to remain in Miami, as Michael's cover is blown and neither he nor she can ever safely return to Ireland. They have another sexual encounter at a hotel later in the season as Michaels way of apologising for not realising how important she is to him sooner. In the season 4 finale, Fiona admits to Jesse that she loves Michael, for better or for worse, and would rather die with him than live without him. Season 5 confirms that Michael and Fiona have officially restarted their relationship. Having not seen him in 6 months, Fiona viciously spars with him in his loft before engaging in rough sex. In season 5 episode 2, Michael told Fiona that he couldn't have completed many jobs without her and that he wants her to move in with him. He says, \\"It's a new job, not a new life. I like my life. And I want to live it with you, here.\\" In the season 5 finale, Michael told Fiona that when it comes to her there is no line that he would not cross. However, Fiona decides that she has had enough of Anson and that she cannot let him continue manipulating Michael and decides to turn herself in, and Michael watches in agony as the love of his life goes to jail. With Fiona in jail, this leaves Michael a chance so he can take down Anson, once and for all. Fiona is taken into custody for the deaths of the security guards in the British Consulate. In the first episode of season 6, she is interrogated by Agent Bly. He offers her a deal: give up Michael's involvement in the bombing in order to not face the electric chair. In the season 6 episode \\"Shockwave\\", she is released from prison after signing Tom Card‚Äôs contract to become an official CIA asset. After Agent Pearce's reassignment to Mumbai, Agents Bailey and Manaro are requiring Fiona to fulfill the contractual obligation of her release or return to prison. Michael will not allow Fiona to do Bailey and Manaro's mission alone. After forcing Bailey and Manaro to trust in Fiona's skills, Michael provides the distraction needed to allow Fiona to finish the mission and thus manipulating Bailey and Manaro to \\"lose\\" Fiona's contract. As the team fights for a way out of Miami to save themselves, Fiona and Michael begin struggling to save their relationship. In Panama, Michael promised Fiona that when his name is clear, he is out of the agency. At the end of the season, the team is in a CIA prison. When they are released, Michael is giving orders to other agents. When Fiona confronts him, he states he did what needed to be done, but Fiona's response is he did what he wanted. She withdraws from Michael's reach in tears. He broke his promise. In season 7 their relationship takes a turn for the worse. After nearly nine months of not seeing each other Fiona and Michael finally come face to face. After Fiona was kidnapped, Michael started remembering the time they met in Ireland. Michael arrives at the place where Fiona is being held captive, there he remembers that back in Ireland, Fi told him a story, she said that her father would tell her to be brave. Before hanging up on her Michael told Fiona: \\"It's time to be brave little Angel\\". After saving her life, she gave him a kiss on the cheek, the Irish way of breaking up. Fiona is later arrested where she learns that Michael saved her and the gang from going to jail. It is here where she realized she made a mistake, in breaking up with him and for doubting him. Carlos, Fiona's \\"new\\" boyfriend breaks up with her because he sees that Fiona still loves Michael and that he will always be the love of her life. In the penultimate episode \\"Sea Change\\" Fiona puts a tracker in Michael's gun and the team learns that Michael is about to betray the CIA, Jesse tells the team that Michael is not the same and that he is lost. Fiona tells the team that if they don't stop him, \\"there won't be a [Michael Westen] left to save\\". Fiona heads to the roof where Sonya threatens to kill her in front of Michael, a shot is heard and the screen goes black. In \\"Reckoning\\" after he shoots Sonya to save Fiona, Michael and Fiona escape the roof and are saved by Sam and Jesse. Michael goes to his mom's house and Madeline asks Michael if he is coming to Charlie's birthday party. Michael says he is not sure but Madeline tells Michael that Charlie wanted him there. Michael and Fiona are captured by James' men and Madeline tells Michael that she has to make the ultimate sacrifice saying, \\"Sometimes sacrifices have to be made.\\" Michael and Fiona come out to confront James and Michael tells him that Fiona is going to negotiate. Fiona asks \\"should we shoot them?\\". A battle of guns ensues and Michael tells Fiona he wants to live more than he ever has. Apparently Michael and Fiona die in the explosion. It is later shown through flashbacks that they survived. After Sam wishes luck on Michael, Jesse and Sam leave. The next scene shows what appears to be a cottage in Ireland. Fiona is seen getting hot chocolate and Charlie is asleep in Michael's lap. Michael asks Fiona what he will tell Charlie when he is older. Fiona asks about what and Michael tells her \\"about me\\" Fiona tells him to tell Charlie the truth. Michael asks where would he start and Fiona tells him \\"start from the beginning. Start with 'my name is Michael Westen, I used to be a spy\\". Michael smiles, and he and Fiona kiss, Fiona raising Charlie as if he was her own and living happily ever after in Ireland. =Sam= At some point in the past, Sam Axe foiled an attempt by Fiona to sell a large shipment of weapons to a Libyan arms dealer, costing her a considerable sum of money. Upon being reacquainted with him in Miami, she was at first (understandably) very hostile towards him, often making disparaging remarks about him and belittling him for being under the thumb of the Feds. After working together on several jobs, she began to mellow towards Sam and even admitted that she admired the loyalty that he displayed for his friends. Sam has been known to ask Fiona for advice regarding his relationships with women. Though she and Sam will occasionally be rivals for Michael's attention, there is no real hostility between them anymore; and they now share a committed, if antagonistic, friendship. Though neither likes to admit it, they work well as a team, as Michael has pointed out. They have also demonstrated a willingness to risk life and limb for one another, as Fiona helped Michael rescue Sam from a vicious drug lord at the end of Season 1; and Sam likewise helped Michael save Fiona from O'Neill's clutches. Sam confessed that he felt sad when he thought Fiona would be returning to Ireland. The two of them will still trade barbs, though their verbal sparring now takes the form of playful teasing. =Jesse Porter= In Season 4, Jesse Porter joins the team after being inadvertently burned by Michael. Fiona initially admires Jesse's flair for action and sense of personal morality. While not (at first) interested romantically, the two have begun to form a sibling bond. They have covered Michael's operations as a sniper-and-spotter-team and heavily modified a Ford pickup to carry heavy weapons only to take it out on a joy ride through Miami. The two took a working vacation together in the Bahamas and posed as a married couple, which cemented their professional relationship and built up Fiona's trust in Jesse. Because of Jesse's troubles in turning a blind eye toward people in trouble (even if the mission is in jeopardy), and his quick reactions in using violent force, the two often pair off to play devil's advocate with Michael's plans, which has forced him to become more open about his rationales. Fiona is torn between her loyalty to Michael and her hatred of the lies they are telling Jesse. There appears to be sexual tension whenever Fiona and Jesse are alone together. In the mid-season finale, the two share a lengthy kiss to cover their motives when they are discovered in her car spying on a shady legal team. She later tells Michael that she has definitely been feeling something for Jesse and that, despite the kiss being a ruse, there was real passion in it. After Jesse finds out that Michael was the one who burned him, he confronts Fiona at Michael's place. Although hurt and disappointed finding out his friends burned and lied to him, it hurt him the most knowing that Fiona was in on it, since they were very close and he had feelings for her. Although he threatened to kill her, he couldn't bring himself to do it, and leaves instead. It leaves Fiona very heartbroken, knowing she hurt Jesse, who she grew to really care about. In the summer season 4 finale, she and Madeline try to mend things with Jesse, apologizing to him and ask him to help the team out in taking out Barrett. When Michael is recovering in hospital afterwards, Fiona calls Jesse and together with Sam they explain everything that has happened with him, including giving him Michaels dossier with all of the crimes he's accused of. Fiona later calls Jesse to a meeting at a bar, which was part of Madeleine plan to force Michael and Jesse to stop being stubborn with each other and make friends again, which evidently worked.

The first trial  Maren Thomasdatter Splids originated from the village of Grimstrup in Esbjerg. She was the wife of a wealthy and successful tailor in the town of Ribe in Jutland and ran an inn in one of her husband's houses. She was an independent woman with a sharp tongue. Didrik the tailor, an unsuccessful professional competitor to her husband, accused her of sorcery in 1637. He claimed that one night he had been awoken by three witches; two were unknown by him, but the third was Maren. They had held him down, and Maren blew into his mouth. The day after he was sick, and vomited up an object he thought was moving. The object was brought forward and observed by priests and the bishop, who declared it to be unnatural. But her husband stood by her side and managed to have her acquitted of the charges.  The second trial  Didrik then gathered witnesses to support his cause and went straight to King Christian IV of Denmark, in 1639. The king declared that the case should be opened again, and that Maren should bring 15 character witnesses to swear her free from the charges. She did not manage to get them, and was therefore judged guilty of the charges in 1640, but freed by the higher court. The matter was now brought before the highest court, where the king was a judge. The king had Maren brought to Copenhagen and tortured her, despite the fact that the law forbade torture of prisoners before they were judged. The torture made her admit guilt and accuse a number of other people as witches. The judgement was; \\"Because Maren Spliid personally and here before the court as well as in earlier confessions, said that she had used sorcery, and thereby misused the holy sacrament of communion, we found her as a sorceress, and on her life suffer fire and stake\\". In Denmark, witches were often burned alive at the stake. Maren Splids (ca. 1600 - 1641)] Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon . Retrieved on 2007-09-24 The day after the verdict, Maren was executed outside of Ribe. So many people had come to see it that the priest could hardly get to her. She was given a half bottle of alcohol to steady herself with and a bag of gunpowder on her back to make the death quicker. Then she was tied to a ladder, and the ladder was thrown into the fire.  Aftermath  In 1652, eleven years after this execution, Anna Bruds was burned in Ribe as a witch. After this the witch hunt in Denmark was less intense, though the last convicted witch in Denmark, Anne Palles, was executed in 1693. Together with Norway, Denmark burned more witches than the other countries in Scandinavia. Many people were burned between 1540 and 1693, especially in Jutland and Northern Norway.

The township is in the East China Sea off the coast of Fujian Province, China near Fuzhou (Foochow). Beigan Island, the main island of the township, is the second largest island in the Matsu Islands. Other smaller islands in the township include Daqiu Island, known for its Formosan sika deer, and Gaodeng Island and Liang Island which are off-limits to the public. The native language many of the inhabitants is Matsu dialect which is one of the statutory languages for public transport announcements in the Matsu Islands.Â§ßÁúæÈÅãËº∏Â∑•ÂÖ∑Êí≠Èü≥Ë™ûË®ÄÂπ≥Á≠â‰øùÈöúÊ≥ï Name Beigan Township is named for Beigan Island (Peikan Island), the main island in the township. Beigan Island has also been known as Pei-kan Tang / Peikantang (), Changche shan () / Changqidao () and Ch'ang-hs√º Shan (). In Song and Ming records, Beigan Island was called Xiagantang/Xiagantangshan (//) as opposed to Nangan Island (Matsu Island), which was called Shanggantang/Shanggantangshan (//). History Prehistoric settlement of Beigan dates back over six- thousand years before present. Fishing villages were established on Beigan Island during the Song and Yuan dynasties. In the Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty, the island was abandoned several times due to the Great Clearance edicts. Pirates were often seen in the area. In 1754, a watchtower was in place on Beigan Island. In 1869, the Qing government erected tablets in Tangqi and Qiaozi villages concerning salt taxes. =Republic of China= On August 18, 1928 during the middle of the night, the previous several days of torrential rain caused a landslide in Qiaozi resulting in the deaths of more than thirty people. One resident was rescued three days after the landslide. A family of eight was wiped out. In 1934, a lianbao (associated bao) was created encompassing the inhabitants of the islands of Nangan, Beigan, Daqiu, Xiaoqiu, Gaodeng, Xiyang () and Dongyong (Dongyin). Later, Xiyang and Dongyong (Dongyin) were divided into a separate lianbao. On September 10, 1937, Japan occupied Beigan and Nangan. Beigan's vast resources of fish attracted many coastal Fujian residents to settle in the area to fish. In 1949, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China in Mainland China, Matsu was separated from the mainland and was subsequently incorporated under Lienchiang County by the Government of the Republic of China. In the early 1950s, skirmishes between Nationalist and Communist forces occurred near Gaodeng Island. On December 12, 1950, Beigan District was established as part of the Matsu Administrative Commission (È¶¨Á•ñË°åÊîøÂÖ¨ÁΩ≤). The county government and baojia system was ended. On August 15, 1953, Lienchiang County government was reestablished including Beigan Township. On May 31, 1955, a Chinese Communist motor torpedo boat was engaged to the northeast of Beigan Island. On October 25, 1967, Chinese Communist shelling at Tangqi Village lead to the death of one nineteen year-old, injury of six others and the destruction of three buildings. On May 3, 1977, and May 2 and September 28, 1980, President Chiang Ching-kuo visited the township. In 1994, the Beigan Airport was built on Beigan Island. On June 17, 1994 and again on August 31, 1996, President Lee Teng-hui visited the township. On August 10, 1997, Formosa Airlines Flight 7601 crashed on Beigan Island. All of the crew and passengers died. On November 17, 2000, President Chen Shui-bian visited the township. In 2011, prehistoric human skeletons were found on Liang Island. On January 19, 2013, President Ma Ying-jeou visited the township. In 2013, the movie 100 Days was filmed in Qinbi (Cinbi) Village.

To make use of the higher power and rpm, the aircraft had a four-bladed propeller of larger diameter than the Dr.I. This required longer landing gear. The rear fuselage had to be extended to compensate for the heavier engine. Four V.7 aircraft were built. The V.7/I was in the fighter flyoff competition in January 1918.

Elmira Free Academy moved to Hoffman St in 1969. The school also boasted many honors courses, taught to the standards of both AP and ACE (a program that offers direct college credits at many schools). Elmira Free Academy was also a strong statewide contender in many sports, despite a smaller student enrollment and budget than many competing schools. The school was classified as class A in Section IV of the NYSPHSAA. Every fall, Southside High School and EFA competed in football for the Erie Bell. In 2011, however, the Elmira City School District announced that due to severe budget problems, the 64-year-old rivalry between Southside and EFA would have to come to an end.

He was born on a ranch in Susanville, California and grew up in the 1870s observing the animals and birds of the forests and learning outdoor skills. He constructed a mobile home, called the \\"Travel Log\\", out of a redwood tree and drove it around the country to raise awareness of the plight of the California forests. Its maximum speed was 18 mph. The Travel Log itself is currently on display in the Visitor Center at Humboldt Redwoods State Park. Pat Foster of Hemmings Classic Car magazine wrote \\"the vehicle itself was incredible, a monument to man and nature. It consisted of a huge chunk of giant redwood-said to be the single largest piece of hewn timber in the world-hollowed out and mounted on what was then the toughest, most rugged chassis on earth: the Nash Quad.\\"  Early life  Kellog grew up without his mother in the High Sierras where his father Henry Kellogg and Richard Thompson had discovered Gopher Hill Gravel Mine. His father had been born in Cazenovia and after moving west and settling in the Sierras near Quincy, ran a store that catered to prospectors.Kellogg:11-12. With father busy, he was raised at his home, Spanish Ranch, by a Native American nanny and a Chinese cook named Moon. He wrote in his autobiography that they \\"taught me to fear no creature... the habit of minding my own business, letting the other fellow alone - bird, bear, snake, Indian and other humans.\\" He was sent off to study at Cazenovia Seminary in Syracuse, New York where he lived with his father's sister and he developed his talent for imitating bird songs. At the age of 16 he joined a touring group and later Benjamin Franklin Keith's Vaudeville franchise performing as \\"the nature singer\\" and in musical acts. Career and later life In a demonstration to boy scouts, Kellogg locks a volunteer's legs around a tree to show a supposed punishment used by the local Indigenous people.Kellogg:53-54. The \\"Digger Indians\\" noted in this clipping was a non-specific racial stereotype used by white people. During his childhood Kellogg developed the remarkable ability to perfectly imitate bird song. While bird song imitation was quite popular at the turn of the century, Kellogg's ability to sing from the throat instead of whistle the songs, was what gained him such national attention. By the time he was 22 he was performing his bird songs on vaudeville tours around the country. By the time he was in his forties he was traveling outside of the United States, performing for audiences throughout Europe. Kellogg claimed that he had a 12¬Ω-octave, almost twice the range of a piano. In 1911 Victor Records signed Kellogg to his first recording contract. He recorded with Victor Records until 1926, mostly singing classical and light classical pieces. Kellogg often performed an adaptation of Xaver Scharwenka's Polish Dance No. 1 in E-Flat Minor, Op. 3, a popular piece for vaudeville actors to perform at that time.Kellogg at a recording studio in Oakland The Travel Log made from a single piece of redwood weighing 3 tons mounted on a Nash Quad Kellogg proclaimed his love for the Californian wilderness while traveling in his carved redwood log home. He also claimed to be a vegetarian who chose not to own a gun and his outdoor skills included the ability to start a fire with a wooden drill. After discovering an 1867 treatise by John Tyndall that a small and regulated flame could be extinguished by a sound of the appropriate frequency, he claimed to have developed the technique to do this with his voice. He was also a skilled craftsman and an inventor. In 1924 he designed and patented a mechanized fruit and nut picker. He also designed a movable fireplace. Every time he visited his California home, he found that the forests were dwindling and along with his friends who included John Muir and John Burroughs he considered ways to highlight the loss. He \\"kept thinking and thinking through many years how to take the forest out to the world ...[since] the world could not come out to the forests\\". After World War I he saw a powerful truck, a Nash Quad and decided to modify it by adding a body made from a 7 metre section of a redwood and carving it out with a bed, a toilet and a kitchen with cupboards. The wood weighed 3 tons and could not be lifted. He then dug a tunnel under the wood and drove the Nash Quad under it and then had the log body lowered onto it. He called his vehicle the \\"Travel Log\\" and drove it around at a maximum speed of about 8 km/hour. In later years he traveled in a lighter vehicle that he called the \\"Bird Wing\\" - something that he claimed would start when he whistled to it. He traveled at various times to the West Indies and Fiji where he observed a fire-walking ceremony. He also traveled to Paris where he met Auguste Rodin.Kellogg:277.leftKellogg later moved to live in a carved wooden cabin, The Mushroom,Kellogg:73-79. in a place he called Ever Ever Land. The cabin included all the amenities built to merge into the surrounding wilderness. He was taken care in later life by two of his sisters. They used his Travel Log as a sewing room and donated it in 1994 to the Humboldt Redwood Interpretive Association. Kellogg wrote an autobiographical book Charles Kellogg, the nature singer, his book (1929). In media In 2003, NPR's Ketzel Levine focused on Kellogg in the first part of her three part radio story Big Trees and the Lives They've Changed. In 2007 a musical play entitled An Angel for Ever Ever written and composed by Kim Moreno, was created in tribute to Kellogg's life and accomplishments. Named after his California ranch, the Ever Ever Ranch, it is centered on his relationship with his wife Sara Fuller Burchard (\\"Sa'Di\\"), and the wealthy daughter of Eastman Kodak president Henry A. Strong named Gertrude Strong Achilles who was married to Theodore Carter Achilles. In Episode 76 of MythBusters, \\"Voice Flame Extinguisher,\\" Kellogg was mentioned by name several times as his claim that he could extinguish a flame with only his voice was tested. The myth was busted. In The Sydney Morning Herald, Thursday, February 4, 1926 the following article appeared: Sound Vibration. Extinguishes Fire. New York, Feb. 2.: Mr Charles Kellogg, a Californian scientist, give firemen here a demonstration of extinguishing a gas flame two feet high by tonal vibration. Mr Kellogg passed a bow, like an enlarged violin bow, swiftly across an aluminium tuning fork, producing a screech like an intense radio static. Instantly the yellow flame subsided to six inches and became a sputtering blue flare. Another movement of the bow completely extinguished the flame. Mr Kellogg claimed that in future buildings would have a scientifically-determined pitch, with a screech for extinguishing fires tuned in from a central firehouse, where it would be produced by a much larger bow. He said that the General Electric Company was experimenting with the matter.

Designed by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood, the lodge is an excellent example of National Park Service rustic design, and the only remaining completely original structure that Underwood designed for Bryce Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Description The two-story lodge is built on a stone base with intentionally oversized log framing, creating a massive, rustic appearance. The central portion of the building dates to 1924, with the addition of the north and southeast wings taking place in 1926. The lodge is entered by a long porch fronting the entire lobby, whose roof rests on a long log beam supported by paired log columns. The lodge is capped by a heavy, steeply-pitched shingled roof with clipped gables and shed dormers. The main floor of the lodge comprises the lobby, a dining room, a small auditorium, a gift shop, kitchen and administrative and utility spaces. The dining room and auditorium are open to the roof with exposed log trusses. The lobby features milled timbers with Arts and Crafts detailing. Fireplaces of rough rubble stone are found in the lobby, where the firebox is constructed in a pointed arch, and in the auditorium. A basement underlies much of the main level. The lodge's roof is notable for its unusual shingling pattern, originally designed by Underwood, in which the lower edges of the horizontal shingle courses form irregular, undulating moir√© or wave- like patterns across the roof. This gives an impression that the roof is warped, or in motion. This unique shingling pattern is on the original cabins as well as the main lodge buildings, and has been replicated with each re- roofing of the complex, using the original pattern, as a way to keep the craftsman's trademarks of the original builders and Underwood's design. Deluxe cabins, July 2016 =Deluxe cabins= The satellite cabins, called deluxe cabins, are to the southeast of the lodge. Five buildings contain four lodging units, and ten contain two. The cabins have rubble stone chimneys and corner pilasters, with log slab siding on the main wall exposures, simulating full log construction, complete with chinking. The cabins have log-framed porches with log railings. On the interior the roof trusses are exposed. Original paneling complements the stone fireplaces. The area formerly included two other lines of cabins, the budget cabins and standard cabins, since removed. History Lodge's front entrance, facing west, offset view showing doors The Bryce Canyon Lodge was built by the Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, and opened by T. E. Fitzgerald, a noted hotel manager in the region. The lodge was part of the railroad's project to develop tourist traffic to Bryce, Zion, and the Grand Canyon by providing noteworthy destination hotels at each park. The Union Pacific was following in the footsteps of other railroads' efforts to promote the western parks of the United States and Canada. Architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood was in charge of the design work for the Union Pacific hotels. Construction at the Bryce Canyon Lodge started in 1924 and was completed in the early summer of 1925. The guest wings were added in 1926 and the auditorium in 1927. The second floor of the lodge was used as the dormitory for women employees of the lodge. The budget and economy cabins, also designed by Underwood, were mostly built in 1927, with five deluxe cabins. Ten more deluxe cabins were completed by 1929. Bryce Canyon Lodge is operated by Forever Resorts, a park-management company selected and contracted by the National Park Service. The lodge and cabins were declared a National Historic Landmark (NHL) on May 28, 1987 under the name \\"Bryce Canyon Lodge and Deluxe Cabins.\\" The historic district was expanded on April 25, 1995, as the Bryce Canyon Lodge Historic District which encompasses the National Historic Landmark District but is not itself an NHL.

It is an annual plant that grows from 4 to 15 cm tall. The oblanceolate leaves, about 5-15 per plant, form basal rosettes around the stem and are 2.5‚Äì9 mm long, 0.5-1.5 mm wide. About 4-11 leaves per plant are also scattered along the stem and are generally 2.3-4.7 mm long and 0.3-0.5 mm wide. Scapes are absent. Inflorescences are 2‚Äì6 cm long and produce white flowers that bloom from April to June in the southern hemisphere. S. nominatum is endemic to the northern area of Kakadu National Park and Melville Island in the Northern Territory. Its habitat is recorded as being sandy soils in Melaleuca viridiflora woodlands, bases of sandstone escarpments, and gravelly yellow soil in flat, treeless areas. S. nominatum is most closely related to S. capillare. In his recent revision of the subgenus Andersonia, Anthony Bean (A.R.Bean) noted that there is a large variation recorded in the specimens of this species and more work would need to be done to determine if there's more than one taxon involved with this species. Further evaluation may reveal additional species. S. mitrasacmoides is an illegitimate name applied to this species that had been described by Sherwin Carlquist as a new species in 1979. Ferdinand von Mueller had described a species under this name in 1859 and it is now applied as a synonym for S. tenerrimum, though Anthony Bean noted that this application is uncertain because the type specimen was unable to be located.

Pirata (Filipino, Spanish and Portuguese for \\"pirate\\") is a full-color graphic novel written and illustrated by Filipino cartoonist Pol Medina, Jr. and first published in 1995 by Pugad Baboy, Inc. The characters and storyline of Pirata are derived from Medina's comic strip Pugad Baboy, which is published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer and is compiled annually in book form. Unlike the book compilations of comic strips that had appeared beforehand in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Pirata contains original, never-before published material. Medina began working on the graphic novel in February 1994, announcing its creation in PB5, the fifth Pugad Baboy compilation, as the first of a series of comics called \\"The Adventures of Polgas - Ang Asong Hindi\\" (The Dog Who Isn't) with the supposed publishing date of May 1994. However, it took slightly over a year to complete it, instead of the two months estimated. Priced a moderate Php 85.00 in 1995 (about US$ 3.27 in 1995), it is 42 pages of Pugad Baboy adventure centered on Polgas' acquaintance and friendship with a Muslim pirate named Khalid. Pirata has a more serious atmosphere compared to Medina's previous work, both in terms of theme and materials usedall pages of the first edition were printed on glossy paper, a practice not very common for comics printed in the Philippines at that time. It has been reprinted since. In the tenth Pugad Baboy compilation, Pugad Baboy X, Medina admitted that during the time he was making Pirata, he was dealing with a lot of personal issues. Pirata's serious tone, he related, was a reflection of his angst due to these crises. Synopsis Khalid, a repentant pirate, is rescued by the Pugad Baboy residents after he is nearly killed by his erstwhile brothers-in-arms in the Red Marlin Group under the command of Luna, who are under the impression that he is responsible to the death of their leader Hamid Mustafa. Polgas saves his life several times as a Red Marlin hit squad attempts to finish the job. As rogue elements of the Navy and the Red Marlin finally catch up with Khalid and take him, Doc Sebo, Tomas and Dagul captive, Polgas dons his Dobermaxx persona and rescues the group which had been taken on board a ship in North Harbor. Khalid in turn saves Dobermaxx's life as Luna was about to shoot him from behind. It is soon revealed that Luna himself murdered Hamid; the Red Marlin take him with them as Khalid allows them to escape. The rogue Navy elements are taken into custody by the authorities. Khalid is later accepted as the Red Marlin's new leader. He plans to surrender the pirate group to authorities and will soon testify during the court martial of Major Velasquez, the rogue Navy group's commander. Subplot on Polgas' origin A relevant subplot in Pirata relates the origin of Polgas' human-like behavior, especially his ability to speak. It is revealed that his mother was a pure- bred Golden Retriever named Cecilia owned by a rich customs inspector named Lupito C. Nakpil, otherwise known as \\"King Louie\\". This man was so well-off that Cecilia had a diamond-studded collar and three golden earrings. Cecilia had a mongrel for a mate and when she gave birth to six puppies(four males and two females) all of whom resembled their sire, Nakpil was furious. Polgas' father soon disappeared and that evening, Nakpil's men served asocena as pulutan. Polgas and his siblings were separated from their mother and Nakpil left home for his resthouse in Tagaytay, taking Cecilia with him. Her forced removal from the presence of her offspring caused one of her golden earrings to fall off, of which Polgas retrieved. =Dagul and Polgas meet= The puppies soon went their separate ways and Polgas grew so desperate that he decided to commit suicide. Lying down in the middle of a road, he waited for a vehicle to run him over. One of the vehicles stopped and the driver, Dagul, took Polgas home with him. He was cleaned up and fed, but would not eat. After a week of no food intake, Dagul took him to a veterinarian, who injected Polgas with a sedative and put him under intravenous therapy. The vet also discovered the golden earring in Polgas' mouth. Dagul had Polgas' left earlobe pierced and had him wear the earring. Polgas grew to trust his master, Dagul, who named him \\"Polgas\\"; from Dagul's grandfather's name \\"Apolonio\\" and \\"pulgas\\", the Spanish-derived Filipino word for \\"flea\\". =Origin of Polgas' speech abilities= Dagul worked as a chef and was fond of cooking exotic dishes. One of Polgas' favorites was a bibingka topped with chicken skin cracklings, feta cheese, century egg and balut chicks. This concoction had a teratogenic effect upon him, triggered by the radiation coming off his master's television set. The physical changes in Polgas included the ability to talk and imitate his master's behavior, causing him over time to evolve into a more human-like being. Tomas, Dagul's neighbor, soon noticed Polgas' special abilities and with funding from an unknown philanthropist, the \\"special intelligence unit\\" known as the Organized Canine Bureau was established with Polgas, initially codenamed \\"Wisedog\\" as its first operative. His first mission was to go undercover and take down the \\"Dognap King\\" Atong Damuho as related in the story arc Wisedog. =Nakpil gets his comeuppance= Polgas has not forgotten \\"King Louie\\" however; in his spare time he would do research on Lupito Nakpil's whereabouts. He went looking for Nakpil at his Tagaytay resthouse, but did not find him there. He had reportedly gone into hiding in Zamboanga after the 1986 EDSA Revolution when the new administration began investigating his unexplained wealth. Polgas assumed that Nakpil had taken his mother with him. It soon became obvious that Nakpil had abandoned Cecilia in Tagaytay; as Polgas passed by a market, he saw several drug addicts beating an old, dirty dog. After dispatching the addicts, Polgas saw two gold earrings on the dog's right ear. It was indeed Cecilia; his mother recognized him and licked his nose one last time before she died. As the Red Marlin Group takes Khalid and the others captive, Polgas recognizes Luna for who he really isLupito Nakpil. He later exacts some measure of revenge as he repeatedly shoots Luna pointblank in the face with his garapata gun. Luna was taken by the Red Marlin when it was revealed that he murdered Hamid. It is assumed that he was given a pirate's execution at sea by the group. Miscellaneous notes * Polgas' mother Cecilia's name is an homage to Pol Medina, Jr.'s own mother Cecilia, further evidence that the cartoonist treats Polgas as an alter ego. * A speech balloon meant for Khalid on the tenth frame of page 39 in the first edition of Pirata has no words in it; it may be a typographical error. * The Red Marlin Group and Khalid would appear again as Dobermaxx's allies in the story arc Paraiso, where they are described as a \\"special action group\\" of the Philippine Navy. * Raphael of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles makes a cameo appearance in Pirata. He is hidden in a sewer pipe, with only a portion of his face visible. He is, however, identifiable due to his green skin and red bandana. * Polgas and Dagul both refer to the Red Marlin Group's hit squad as the \\"Jackson 5\\", a reference to the pop quintet. * Medina misspelled the word \\"yacht\\" in the graphic novel twice as \\"yatch\\" (sic). * Hamid was stabbed from the back on the right side of his body. Khalid could not have committed the murder since he was left-handed. * Khalid claims Major Velazquez is a commander in the Philippine Navy. However, Majors are Army ranks, and their Navy counterparts are Lieutenant Commanders. * In the first edition of Pirata, a two-page readers' corner can be found between pages 15 and 16 wherein Medina answered readers' comments about Pugad Baboy. It was included because the graphic novel was supposed to be the first of a quarterly comic series. Later editions of Pirata omitted this. * The graphic novel features the first and only appearance of Dobermaxx's other car, the white Bullfox. Dobermaxx uses the car, still with glitches which Joboy was trying to fix, to drive to the North Harbor to save Khalid, Dagul, et al. from Luna and the Red Marlin hit squad. In fact, its glitches get Dobermaxx riling as the car slowly becomes unreliable. By the time he leaves the Bullfox, it is already in a state of disarray. The Dobermaxx of 2078 uses a future version of the car, known as the Bullfox II. The Bullfox's side profile closely resembles the Audi Avus Quattro.

The largest number of immigrants with the Fernald surname immigrated to North America from cities and wealthy towns in Northern-France, Southern-France and present-day Monaco to the United States and Eastern-Canada between the years 1790 and 1890, most of whom settled in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Montreal, New Hampshire, New York, and Quebec. Fernald Ancestry Present-day, the Fernald surname is still almost exclusively associated with wealthy upperclass causcasian European and American academics, lawyers, physicians, businesspeople, and politicians. Alternative variations of the surname include, Fernault, Fernaux, Forneret, Fornerat, Varnault, Varnaux, Varnot, Vernet, Vernett, Vernette, and Vernes.

Geoff made his first appearance on 9 May 1994 and is introduced as a love interest for Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Roper was written out of the serial in 1995 and Geoff departed in April 1995. He was then reintroduced for a guest stint between September 1995 and October 1995 to aid Michelle's departure, making his final appearance on 24 October 1995. Storylines Yorkshire born Geoff is Michelle Fowler's personal tutor at university. When Michelle begins performing badly during her final year, Geoff helps her get back on track. They become friends, which soon develops into a romance. Geoff is nearly 30 years older than Michelle. The age difference is initially a concern for Geoff, but Michelle is not perturbed. She continues seeing him despite objections from her father, Arthur (Bill Treacher), who grows increasingly antagonized by Geoff's presence. Arthur feels that his paternal role towards Michelle and her daughter Vicki is being superseded by Geoff, and he resents him because of this. Geoff is divorced and has three grown children, including a daughter named Felicity (Tara Moran). Felicity turns out to be an obnoxious snob and there is a clear class divide between her and Michelle. Felicity frequently goads Michelle about her past and for dating a middle-aged man. There is an underlying hostility every time they met. Later in the year, Geoff supports Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) through a troublesome period, and subsequently becomes the object of her affections. Out of sympathy, Geoff takes an interest in Pat's affairs, and even persuades her to take an evening course in business studies. Pat soon begins to think that Geoff is interested in her sexually, but Geoff seems oblivious to her advances. Gossip begins to spread about the nature of their relationship and at this time Geoff decides to let Pat down gently. However, he is beaten to it by Pat who senses the on-coming rejection and announces ‚àí to Geoff's surprise ‚àí that they should no longer see each other socially. In 1995, Geoff is offered a new job in Scotland. He asks Michelle to marry him, hoping that she and Vicki will join him there. Michelle is hesitant and Arthur reacts with fury ‚àí denouncing their relationship as ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù. However, Arthur's extreme opposition only encourages Michelle to go against his wishes. Although Michelle claims to love Geoff, she worries that their relationship lacks passion. After weeks of contemplation, she is finally persuaded to accept by her nemesis Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), who goads her about her boring life in Walford. Geoff ‚àí who has already prepared himself for rejection ‚àí is stunned and thrilled when she agrees to marry him. In April, Geoff and Michelle travel to Scotland to view their new home. Michelle does not seem particularly happy, which Geoff picks upon. Michelle's mother, Pauline (Wendy Richard), unwittingly makes the situation worse when she praises Geoff for being safe and secure, unlike Michelle's other boyfriends. He begins to realize that Michelle finds him dull and boring. After a bout of heavy contemplation, he tells Michelle that getting married would be a mistake because she does not love him enough. Michelle argues that affection and respect are more important than passionate love, but Geoff refuses to allow her to waste her life on a loveless marriage. They part company and Geoff remains in Scotland. He returns to Walford unexpectedly in September, to see if Michelle is interested in taking a job as a research assistant in America with one of his colleagues. Geoff admits that he still loves Michelle. They spend the night together and talk about reconciling. Michelle remains unsure and tells him that she needs time to think it over. She eventually opts against a reconciliation with Geoff and takes the job in America instead. Geoff leaves Walford with a broken heart in October 1995; Michelle leaves Walford shortly after becoming pregnant with Grant Mitchell's child. Character creation and development 1994 was a \\"historic\\" year for EastEnders, as in April a third weekly episode was introduced. Due to the program's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast. Among them was Geoff Barnes, a middle-aged lecturer at the University Michelle attended. The character was introduced in May 1994 under executive and series producers Leonard Lewis and Barbara Emile. Yorkshire born actor, David Roper, was cast in the role. Unlike the majority of the other regular characters, Geoff did not live in Walford, but in North London. Geoff formed a friendship with Michelle while assisting her with her University work and this later developed into a romance‚Äîa plotline that has been compared to the 1983 film Educating Rita. Michelle was a character who had a history of falling for older men and writer Colin Brake has commented on her relationship with Geoff in the book, EastEnders: The First Ten Years (published in 1994): ‚ÄúFor the first time since Den [Watts], Michelle found herself attracted to a much older man. After years of disastrous relationships with men, who can say if she has made the right choice this time?‚Äù Michelle's relationship with Geoff proved to be one of her most enduring. They remained an on-screen couple for roughly 12 months. Storylines mainly focused on the characters class and age differences. Geoff's age was 53 at the time of his introduction, several years older than Michelle's father, Arthur. Geoff deviated considerably from all of Michelle's former partners. He was portrayed as mature, dependable and secure. In an episode that aired in April 1995, Michelle's mother Pauline comments that Geoff is ‚Äúsafe and secure‚Äù and a ‚Äústeadying influence‚Äù on Michelle. She adds that Michelle ‚Äúneeds someone like him‚Äù as she has had ‚Äúthe most unsuitable boyfriends all her life‚Äù and she ought to settle down. Ultimately however, these traits in Geoff were the reason for the destruction of the relationship. Michelle frequently commented that the relationship lacked ‚Äúpassion‚Äù and although they planned to marry, Geoff realized that Michelle did not love him and ‚Äúnobly‚Äù finished with her. Geoff remained a regular character for a year, and was eventually written out in April 1995, following his split from Michelle. The character returned for brief stints in September and October 1995, to aid the departure of Susan Tully, who left EastEnders after nearly eleven years playing Michelle.

Sporting a parasol wing, it was the first Fokker aircraft purportedly designed by Reinhold Platz‚Äîthe respective roles played by Fokker himself, Platz, and possibly others in the conceptual design of Fokker airplanes are a matter of dispute among historians‚Äîand was an early experiment in cantilever wing construction, eliminating the bracing wires typical of aircraft design at the time, something that had already been achieved with metal materials in Hugo Junkers' own pioneering Junkers J 1 in 1915. Design The Fokker V.1 principal innovation was its unbraced cantilever wings. These were built around a pair of wooden box-girders, the upper and lower members of which were built up from several thin strips of pine, with connecting webs of birch plywood. The entire wing was covered in plywood, an innovation probably suggested to Fokker by a Swedish aeronautical engineer, Villehad Forssman, who had previously designed one of Germany's earliest multi-engined military aircraft; the V.1 upper wing's smooth surface, thick airfoil and tapered planform gave it a remarkably modern appearance. The depth of spar needed for adequate strength necessitated a wing whose root thickness was around 20% of the chord, in contrast to a typical value of around 6% for aircraft of the period and 12 to 15% for modern aircraft of comparable performance. The spars of the upper wing were parallel but those of the lower wing converged to meet at the wingtips. The intention of this was to provide a well for the fitting of a retractable undercarriage at a later date. Ailerons were fitted to the upper wing only and these were unusual in that the entire wing-tip being a separate component, and was pivoted, much like the French Bl√©riot VIII of 1908 had done, to provide a control surface. To further Platz's desire for an aerodynamically clean aircraft, all control actuators were buried within the wing, so that there were no drag-creating control horns. The upper wing was mounted on a system of cabane struts consisting of a pair of tubular steel tripods between the fuselage and mainspar and a pair of steel struts connected to the aft spar, all basically similar to the cabane strut design for the later, likewise Platz-designed Fokker D.VI and Fokker D.VII biplane descendants ‚Äî each of which also used one \\"N-pattern\\" interplane strut set per side ‚Äî and the Fokker D.VIII parasol-wing monoplane descendant of the V.1. Unlike the later D.VI and D.VII, there were no interplane struts on the outer areas of the V.1's wing panels. Since Platz was using a novel and thick aerofoil, much like the contemporary cantilever-winged Junkers J 1 all-metal monoplane pioneered nearly a year earlier, he was unsure about the correct incidence for the wing with respect to the fuselage. Lacking a wind tunnel, he therefore made it adjustable during flight. The fuselage structure was the usual Fokker wire- braced rectangular section box girder made from welded steel tubes. This was then enclosed within circular wooden formers bearing longitudinal stringers and covered with fabric. The tail surfaces were all-moving, without a fixed fin or horizontal stabiliser. The aircraft was powered by a 75 kW (100 hp) Oberursel U.I rotary engine. In the case of the V.1 the V did not stand for Versuchs (experimental), but for Verspannungslos (literally \\"without struts\\"), or cantilever. The aircraft was so small it was nicknamed \\"Floh\\" or flea, like a similarly small, DFW-built prototype airframe of the era. Variants It was Fokker's practice to develop rotary and inline engined variants of the company's designs. Accordingly, a second similar aircraft powered by a 120 hp (90 kW) Mercedes D.II was constructed, the Fokker V.2. The aircraft differed principally in having an increased wing area to compensate for the increased weight of the engine and Albatros D.III-outline shape open structure, fabric- covered conventional tail surfaces.

The NR0B1 gene is located on the short (p) arm of the X chromosome between positions 21.3 and 21.2, from base pair 30,082,120 to base pair 30,087,136.  Function  This gene encodes a protein that lacks the normal DNA-binding domain contained in other nuclear receptors. The encoded protein acts as a dominant- negative regulator of transcription of other nuclear receptors including steroidogenic factor 1. This protein also functions as an anti-testis gene by acting antagonistically to SRY. Mutations in this gene result in both X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. DAX1 plays an important role in the normal development of several hormone-producing tissues. These tissues include the adrenal glands above each kidney, the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, which are located in the brain, and the reproductive structures (the testes and ovaries). DAX1 controls the activity of certain genes in the cells that form these tissues during embryonic development. Proteins that control the activity of other genes are known as transcription factors. DAX1 also plays a role in regulating hormone production in these tissues after they have been formed.  Role in disease  X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita is caused by mutations in the NR0B1 gene. More than 90 NR0B1 mutations that cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita have been identified. Many of these mutations delete all or part of the NR0B1 gene, preventing the production of DAX1 protein. Some mutations cause the production of an abnormally short protein. Other mutations cause a change in one of the building blocks (amino acids) of DAX1. These mutations are thought to result in a misshapen, nonfunctional protein. Loss of DAX1 function leads to adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadismTab. 1.1 of Stefan White & Andrew Sinclair: The Molecular Basis of Gonadal Development and Disorders of Sex Development, in: John M. Hutson, Garry L. Warne, & Sonia R. Grover (eds): Disorders of Sex Development. An Integrated Approach to Management, Springer 2012, , e-, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-22964-0., which are the main characteristics of this disorder. Duplication of genetic material on the X chromosome in the region that contains the NR0B1 gene can cause a condition called dosage-sensitive sex reversal. The extra copy of the NR0B1 gene prevents the formation of male reproductive tissues. People who have this duplication usually appear to be female, but are genetically male with both an X and a Y chromosome. In some cases, genetic material is deleted from the X chromosome in a region that contains several genes, including NR0B1. This deletion results in a condition called adrenal hypoplasia congenita with complex glycerol kinase deficiency.

This is similar to the Fokker V.6 being tested as the Fokker V.5 was being developed. Like the V.1, the fuselage was circular in cross section, and the wings were covered with plywood. To match the center of pressure and center of gravity with the heavier engines, these aircraft had their upper wing's outboard sections swept back. For many decades, the V.3 was thought to be a modification to the V.2 instead of a separate aircraft. The designation was known, and assigned in error to the first triplane, which also had cantilever wings. That aircraft was, however, the V.4, not the V.3.

It should not be confused with polybutene, a low molecular weight oligomer. Polybutylene is produced by polymerisation of 1-butene using supported Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalysts. PB-1 is a high molecular weight, linear, isotactic, and semi-crystalline polymer. PB-1 combines typical characteristics of conventional polyolefins with certain properties of technical polymers. PB-1, when applied as a pure or reinforced resin, can replace materials like metal, rubber and engineering polymers. It is also used synergistically as a blend element to modify the characteristics of other polyolefins like polypropylene and polyethylene. Because of its specific properties it is mainly used in pressure piping, flexible packaging, water heaters, compounding and hot melt adhesives. Synthesis Isotactic PB-1 is synthesized commercially using two types of heterogeneous Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalysts. The first type of catalyst contains two components, a solid pre-catalyst, the Œ¥-crystalline form of TiCl3, and solution of an organoaluminum cocatalyst, such as Al(C2H5)3. The second type of pre-catalyst is supported. The active ingredient in the catalyst is TiCl4 and the support is microcrystalline MgCl2. These catalysts also contain special modifiers, organic compounds belonging to the classes of esters or ethers. The pre- catalysts are activated by combinations of organoaluminum compounds and other types of organic or organometallic modifiers. Two most important technological advantages of the supported catalysts are high productivity and a high fraction of the crystalline isotactic polymer they produce at 70‚Äì80 ¬∞C under standard polymerization conditions.Hwo, Charles C.; Watkins, Larry K. Laminated film with improved tear strength, European Patent Application EP0459742, Publication date 12/04/1991Boo-Deuk Kim et al. (2008) Characteristics Heated up to 190 ¬∞C and above, PB-1 can easily be compression moulded, injection moulded, blown to hollow parts, extruded, and welded. It does not tend to crack due to stress. Because of its crystalline structure and high molecular weight, PB-1 has good resistance to hydrostatic pressure, showing very low creep even at elevated temperatures. It is flexible, resists impact well and has good elastic recovery.Polybutylene Isotactic polybutylene crystallizes in three different forms. Crystallization from solution yields form-III with the melting point of 106.5 ¬∞C. Cooling from the melt results in the form II which has melting point of 124 ¬∞C and density of 0.89 g/cm3. At room temperature, it spontaneously converts into the form-I with the melting point of 135 ¬∞C and density of 0.95 g/cm3. PB-1 generally resists chemicals such as detergents, oils, fats, acids, bases, alcohol, ketones, aliphatic hydrocarbons and hot polar solutions (including water). It shows lower resistance to aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons as well as oxidising acids than other polymers such as polysulfone and polyamide 6/6. Additional features include excellent wet abrasion resistance, easy melt flowability (shear thinning), and good dispersion of fillers. It is compatible with polypropylene, ethylene propylene rubbers, and thermoplastic elastomers. Some properties: *Elastic modulus 290‚Äì295 MPa *Tensile strength 36.5 MPa * Molecular weight 725,000 (g/mol) *Crystallinity 48‚Äì55% *Water absorption <0.03% *Glass transition temperature ‚Äì25 to ‚Äì17 ¬∞C *Thermal conductivity 0.22 W/(m¬∑K) Application areas =Piping systems= The main use of PB-1 is in flexible pressure piping systems for hot and cold drinking water distribution, pre-insulated district heating networks and surface heating and cooling systems. ISO 15876 defines the performance requirements of PB-1 piping systems.ISO 15876-1:2003 iso.org The most striking features are weldability, temperature resistance, flexibility and high hydrostatic pressure resistance. The material can be classified PB 125 with a minimum required strength (MRS) of 12.5 MPa. Other features include low noise transmission, low linear thermal expansion, no corrosion and calcification. PB-1 piping systems are no longer being sold in North America (see \\"Class action lawsuits and removal from building code approved usage\\", below). The overall market share in Europe and Asia is rather small but PB-1 piping systems have shown a steady growth in recent years. In certain domestic markets, e.g. Kuwait, the United Kingdom, Korea and Spain, PB-1 piping systems have a strong position. =Plastic packaging= Several PB-1 grades are commercially available for various applications and conversion technologies (blown film, cast film, extrusion coating). There are two main fields of application: *Peelable easy-to-open packaging where PB-1 is used as blend component predominantly in polyethyelene to tailor peel strength and peel quality, mainly in alimentary consumer packaging and medical packaging. *Lowering seal initiation temperature (SIT) of high speed packaging polypropylene based films. Blending PB-1 into polypropylene, heat sealing temperatures as low as 65 ¬∞C can be achieved, maintaining a broad sealing window and good optical film properties. =Hot melt adhesives= PB-1 is compatible with a wide range of tackifier resins. It offers high cohesive and adhesive strength and helps tailoring the \\"open time\\" of the adhesive (up to 30 minutes) because of its slow crystallisation kinetics. It improves the thermal stability and the viscosity of the adhesive. =Compounding and masterbatches= PB-1 accepts very high filler loadings in excess of 70%. In combination with its low melting point it can be employed in halogen-free flame retardant composites or as masterbatch carrier for thermo- sensitive pigments. PB-1 disperses easily in other polyolefins, and at low concentration, acts as processing aid reducing torque and/or increasing throughput. =Other applications= Other applications include domestic water heaters, electrical insulation, compression packaging, wire and cable, shoe soles, and polyolefin modification (thermal bonding, enhancing softness and flexibility of rigid compounds, increasing temperature resistance and compression set of soft compounds). Environmental longevity Plumbing and heating systems made from PB-1 have been used in Europe and Asia for more than 30 years. First reference projects in district heating and floor heating systems in Germany and Austria from the early 1970s are still in operation today. One example is the installation of PB-1 pipes in the Vienna Geothermal Project (1974) where aggressive geothermal water is distributed at a service temperature of 54 ¬∞C and 10 bar pressure. Other pipe materials in the same installation failed or corroded and had been replaced in the meantime. International standards set minimum performance requirements for pipes made from PB-1 used in hot water applications. Standardized extrapolation methods predict lifetimes in excess of 50 years at 70 ¬∞C and 10 bar. Class action lawsuits and removal from building code approved usage Polybutylene plumbing was used in several million homes built in the United States from around 1978 to 1997. Problems with leaks and broken pipes led to a class action lawsuit, Cox v. Shell Oil, that was settled for $1 billion. The leaks were associated with degradation of polybutylene exposed to chlorinated water. also published as: Polybutylene water pipes are no longer accepted by United States building codes and have been the subjectPipe dream is nightmare for many, Miami Herald - September 12, 1993 of class action lawsuits in both Canada and the U.S.DuPont USA Settlement of the Canadian Class Action LawsuitsPolybutylene Plumbing Pipe Leak Relief The National Plumbing Code of Canada 1995 listed polybutylene piping as acceptable for use with the exception of recirculation plumbing. The piping was removed from the acceptable for use list in the 2005 issue of the standard. There is evidence to suggest that the presence of chlorine and chloramine compounds in municipal water (often deliberately added to retard bacterial growth) will cause deterioration of the internal chemical structure of polybutylene piping and the associated acetal fittings.Cause of failure in polybutylene pipe & acetal fittings http://www.polybutylene.com/poly.html The reaction with chlorinated water appears to be greatly accelerated by tensile stress, and is most often observed in material under highest mechanical stress such as at fittings, sharp bends, and kinks. Localized stress whitening of the material generally accompanies and precedes decomposition of the polymer. In extreme cases, this stress-activated chemical \\"corrosion\\" can lead to through perforation and leakage within a few years, but it also may not fail for decades. Fittings with a soft compression seal can give adequate service life. Because the chemical reaction of the water with the pipe occurs inside the pipe, it is often difficult to assess the extent of deterioration. The problem can cause both slow leaks and pipe bursting without any previous warning indication. The only long-term solution is to completely replace the polybutylene plumbing throughout the entire building.

She is Michael Westen's neurotic, chain-smoking mother. Overview It is unclear how much Madeline knows about her son's life as a spy. All she really seems to know is that he tends to be in a different city, in a different country, or generally in a different place, and that he can not disclose where he is. Madeline is thrilled when Michael is back in Miami and hopes that he will stay. She occasionally asks him for help with her friends' problems. Madeline's relationship with Michael has been tumultuous, and complicated by the fact that her husband, and the father of her children, regularly abused them. Madeline believes that Michael aggravated his father, and that this was the reason for Michael's father's beatings. She later allowed Michael to join the military at 17 by forging his father's signature on his enlistment forms. Madeline has been angry at Michael for years for an assortment of reasons, such as not attending his father's funeral. Upon his arrival in Miami, she asked Michael to visit his grave in exchange for his father's vintage Dodge Charger automobile. Madeline keeps up with her son Michael's actions through his friend and ally Fiona Glenanne. Over the course of the series, Madeline has often been drawn into events in one way or another, which has made her more aware of what Michael and his friends are actually doing. In the pilot episode, Madeline is depicted as an unstable hypochondriac woman. This characterization was discarded in future episodes to be replaced by the more no-nonsense, self-supportive woman that she would remain for the rest of the series. This change is also characterized by the haircut she receives. While she's still not \\"officially\\" told about Michael's position as a spy, she has actively helped out on occasions, such as assisting with surveillance in the season 3 episode \\"Friends Like These\\", or even successfully interrogating a captive about Michael's whereabouts in \\"The Hunter\\", while Fiona and Sam were still arguing about the best approach. She does not like the truth about Michael's life, and her fears are brought to light when she is forced to defend him in an FBI interrogation, in the third- season finale; the bureau questions her concerning his activities that got him burned, along with many other actions in his spy career. While she is able to deter Michael from returning, she is ultimately detained. However, when Michael disables Simon, both disappear and Madeline is freed, but she anguishes in the disappearance of her son. In season 4, after former counter intelligence agent Jesse Porter joins the team, he moves in with Madeline. She begins to form a true friendship with Jesse and forms a mother-son like bond with him. Knowing that her son accidentally burned Jesse, Madeline, like Fiona, expresses her dislike for all the lies that Michael continues to tell Jesse. At one point, she decides to go to Tampa to stay with a friend she doesn't really like, for fear of letting the truth slip out and of how Jesse's reaction if he found out. Madeline is often critical of Michael's methodologies. But in Season 5, when Michael tells her that Anson Fullerton caused the heart attack that killed her husband, she implores Michael to \\"do whatever it takes\\" to bring Anson to justice. In season 6, Madeline serves as Fiona's source on the outside when she needs assistance in getting things to help get her out of prison. Madeline then becomes greatly distraught and heartbroken after learning of her youngest son Nate Weston's death from Michael. Since then, she has come to blame Michael for his death, stating how Nate always idolized Michael and how Michael always held contempt for him. She felt Nate had no right to be out in the open with Michael and the others. Eventually, after getting answers over Nate's death from Card (who was really behind Nate's death), Madeline seems to have finally gotten over her strife towards Michael, stating that she needs to forgive him lest she regret it in the future should she lose him, like she did with Nate. In Season 7, Madeline gains custody of her grandson Charlie and begins to take care of him. She is targeted by Nate's former bookie, but forces Fiona to make the bookie look corrupt using his ledger, in order to get him to leave Madeline alone. James also pays her an unannounced visit, causing Madeline to converse while holding him at gunpoint as James assures her that he only wishes to protect her and her grandson. In the series finale, Madeline is forced to burn her house to the ground and go on the run with Fiona from James' men. After Michael, Sam and Fiona enter James' communication/relay center with the intent of gathering evidence to use against him, James sends his men to where Madeline, Jesse and Charlie are hiding. Knowing that they don't stand a chance against James' men, and only armed with a single C-4 charge (without a remote detonator), Madeline decides to sacrifice her life for Charlie's safety as well as Michael's. As Jesse and Charlie take cover, Madeline manually detonates the C-4, killing her and James' men instantly as they enter. Her last words are, \\"This one's for my boys.\\" In the series' pilot, the actress wears a wig, but throughout the rest of the series, her real hair is featured.

Ruka married Egons Spuris, a famous Latvian photographer. Towards the end of the 1970s, she started her career in photography. In 2006, she worked on another photographic series, Neighbours. Additionally, she received a scholarship of the IASPIS for ‚Äútwo-month artist-in-residence‚Äù in Stockholm in 2007, and was given \\"the highest award of the 'Order of the Three Stars' of the State of Latvia\\", \\"Chevalier\\" (\\"Knight\\"), in 2009. Since the end of the 1980s, Ruka has had about twenty exhibitions alone both abroad and in Latvia. She has also taken part in an abundance of group exhibitions worldwide. Ruka worked with Rolleiflex cameras up until 2004. She would put the Rolleiflex camera on a tripod, and photograph using natural light, waiting until the right light came. Anna Tellgren states that Inta Ruka works with gelatin silver printing paper. This shows her connection to an older generation. Ruka had followed the path of portrait photography and also improved it. According to Tellgren (2017), Inta Ruka described the way she worked as documentary. When working on her own projects, she was self-employed. According to Tellgren, Ruka is interested in people which is why she takes photographs. More specifically, she focuses on individuals, not groups. She wants to show that each person has a meaning and purpose in society. Ruka received a scholarship from the Hasselblad Foundation in 1998, the Spidola Award of the Latvian Culture Foundation in 1999 and a scholarship from the Villa Waldberta in Feldafing in 2002. One year later, the Artist's Union of Latvia awarded her the \\"Prize of the Year 2003.\\" Inta Ruka's photographs have already been presented in several important international exhibitions. In 1999, she took part at the 48th Biennale of Venice which finally publicised her name internationally. In 2006, the Photography Centre in Istanbul organised a large solo show of her photos. Before 2007, her photographs had been shown with works by Wolfgang Tillmans, Boris Mikhailov and others in the exhibition In the Face of History: European Photographers in the 20th Century at the Barbican Arts Centre in London. For more than two decades, Inta Ruka has photographed the people of Latvia ‚Äì from 1984 to 2000, primarily in the rural area of Balvi (\\"My Country People\\") and, later on, increasingly in the capital of Riga. In the series People I happened to meet, she strikes up conversations with unknown people in order to ask them for a portrait. By contrast, in Amalias Street 5, she focuses on the inhabitants of a certain ensemble of apartments in Riga. Off the beaten track of the picturesque Old Town, with its extensive restoration, she provides an undisguised view on the current state of flux in Latvia since its integration into the European Union. Among photographers of the former Soviet bloc countries, Ruka shares her documentary-anthropological approach with Antanas Sutkus and Boris Mikhailov; internationally with those of the Americans Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange.

He was the maternal uncle of Lucius Aelius Sejanus, the Praetorian Prefect of Emperor Tiberius.  Career  Almost nothing is known of the career of Quintus Junius Blaesus prior to AD 10, when he served as suffect consul with Servius Cornelius Lentulus Maluginensis. The exception is a lead ingot attesting he was proconsul of Sicilia; the date of his office can be dated no closer than the reign of Augustus.Werner Eck, \\"√úber die pr√§torischen Prokonsulate in der Kaiserzeit. Eine quellenkritische √úberlegung\\", Zephyr 23/24 (1972/73), p. 239 Blaesus subsequently appears as commander of the armies stationed in Pannonia when a mutiny broke out after the death of Augustus in the year 14. According to Tacitus, after military service in the Great Illyrian Revolt, soldiers were unhappy with their payment of swampy and mountainous Pannonian lands and demanded restitution. To ease tensions, Blaesus offered to commit suicide, but his request was ignored.Tacitus, Annals I.18 According to the Roman historian Cassius Dio, the soldiers arrested and tortured his slaves, and then attempted to kill Blaesus. However, he managed to temporarily restore order by convincing them to send envoys to the Roman Senate.Cassius Dio, Roman History LVII.4 In response, Tiberius sent his son Drusus to put down the rebellion, accompanied by Sejanus and two Praetorian cohorts. Blaesus' next post was that of proconsul of Africa from 21 to 23. He was helped to achieve this office due to his nephew, Sejanus, insofar as their relationship convinced the other possible choice, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, to withdraw from contention.Tacitus, Annals III.35 During his time as governor in Africa, Blaesus was successful in defeating a revolt by the Roman-born Musulamii warlord Tacfarinas, a victory for which he earned triumphal honors.Tacitus, Annals III.72, III.73 Blaesus' career came to an end in the year 31, when his nephew Sejanus was accused of treason and executed by order of Tiberius. Blaesus was put on trial as one of his associates.

The D.VI served in the German and Austro-Hungarian air services. Design and development In late 1917, Fokker-Flugzeugwerke built two small biplane prototypes designated V.13. These aircraft combined a set of scaled-down D.VII wings with a fuselage and empennage closely mirroring those of the earlier Dr.I.Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 103.

It also permitted a change in the status of the City of Baltimore (designated as a \\"port of entry\\" in 1706, chartered as a town in 1729, incorporated in 1796‚Äì97, and county seat since 1768) and its relationship with the surrounding Baltimore County (which was erected in 1659). By the provisions of this 1851 Constitution, Baltimore City was to be separated and given the status of the other (soon-to-be) 23 counties of the State, with a provision of \\"home rule\\", which was later extended in 1923. By 1854, Baltimore County by election of its voters had moved its county seat and courts to Towsontown, north of the city and began building a new courthouse. However, there were several critiques of the Constitution of 1851, especially in changes in how the judiciary functioned which allowed for gaps in judiciary oversight.

In 35 years he traveled over four continents. Biography =Early life and career= Zacharias was the son of a Saxonian judge and a painter. In 1633 he traveled from Dresden via Hamburg to Amsterdam. There he worked for Willem Blaeu. Within a year he enlisted as a soldier in the armed forces of the Dutch West India Company to serve in \\"New Holland\\" (Dutch Brazil) in 1634. Three years later, he was hired as a writer by the newly arrived governor of the colony, Count John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen. In Recife he kept a sort of diary with 109 water-colour drawings of curious fish, strange birds, useful and harmful animals, lovely tasty fruit and nasty, poisonous worms and big, brown or black people, published as \\"Thier-Buch\\". There are pictures of the Smooth Hammerhead, Cutlassfish, slender filefish, Serranidae, and Cirripedia. On 1 April 1641, he left Dutch Brazil, and arrived on Texel on 17 June. He traveled back to Dresden arriving 12 October. After four months, he left Dresden to return to the Netherlands arriving at Amsterdam on 29 March 1642, and took a position with the Dutch East India Company (, commonly abbreviated to VOC). =Dutch East Indies= On 29 September 1642 he sailed for the Indies as an apprentice officer (). In the next year he became an assistant for the governors Antonie van Diemen and Cornelis van der Lijn; in 1646 he became under-merchant and in 1651 merchant. Three times he became a member of the Court of Justice at Batavia. In 1653 he went on a mission to Canton to open up again trade relations, which proved fruitless, due to a civil war after the Fall of the Ming Dynasty. The Great Fire of Meireki that lasted for three days and may have caused 100,000 deaths. Reconstruction efforts took two years, as the shogunate took the opportunity to reorganize the city according to various practical considerations. In 1657 he rose to the rank of opperhoofd (senior official) of the VOC at the small island in Nagasaki bay in the Japanese island of Kyushu, Dejima. He traveled to the capital Edo in a tributary mission and escaped from a burning city, which started on 2 March 1657. (There is a drawing from his hand in the Edo-Tokyo Museum.) In 1659, as one of the first \\"opperhoofden\\", he ordered a dinner service, consisting of 200 pieces. Wagener made the design of this Japanese porcelain, according to the European taste white and blue, with many flowers. In 1660 Wagner was involved in the peace negotiations with the sultan of Makassar. The port had about 2000 Portuguese traders and for years threatened the Dutch spice trade on the Moluccas. The next year he was head of the Public Works in Batavia. =Dutch Cape Colony= In 1662 he went to Cape of Good Hope with his small family, five slaves and two horses. He followed Jan van Riebeeck as a governor on 6 May. Riebeeck left the next day. In December 1663 he asked Batavia to send him some pottery from Persia. He negotiated with the Hottentots about cattle for the Company. By abstaining from further expeditions Wagener could pursue his policy to refrain from an interference in tribal disputes, and to keep strictly neutral. After five years studying, the German student Georg Friedrich Wreede wrote a compendium of the Dutch and Hottentot language. Wagener appointed him in Mauritius. Wagener was one of the five people laying the foundation of the Castle of Good Hope, which was started in August 1665. He constructed a waterbasin, supplying the ships with fresh water, a hospital, a school and a church. In 1666 his wife Anna Auxbrebis, whom he had married in 1648, died. =Later life= On 27 September 1666 he resigned and Wagener went back to Batavia with his stepdaughter. He sold his slaves from Bengal. With presents he went to see the susuhunan of Mataram, who refused to trade with the VOC. While his knowledge of the Malay or Javanese language wasn't very good, the mission turned out to be fruitless; Wagener visited Japara afterwards. The year after he sailed back to Amsterdam as a vice-admiral, and in ill health. He was buried on 16 October 1668 in the Old Church. An excerpt of his diary was translated from the High Dutch into English and published in 1704 and 1732. A manuscript with fundamentally the same excerpt‚Äîbut in German‚Äîhas been a part of the Collection of Prints, Drawings and Photographs () of the Dresden State Art Collections since at least the beginning of the 18th century. =Terms as Opperhoofd= Wagner served two terms as opperhoofd in alternation with Joan Boucheljon: * Joan Bouchelion: * Zacharias Wagenaer [Wagener]: * Joan Bouchelion: * Zacharias Wagenaer [Wagener]: * Joan Bouchelion: Work * Gallery File:Zacharias Wagner - Insetos.jpgInsects, Kupferstich-Kabinett (Dresden) File:Zacharias Wagner - Caranguejo.jpgCaranguejo (crab) Notes References Further reading Category:1614 births Category:1668 deaths Category:Dutch chiefs of factory in Japan Category:Artists from Dresden Category:17th-century Dutch colonial governors Category:Commanders of the Dutch Cape Colony Category:Burials at the Oude Kerk (Amsterdam) Category:Sailors on ships of the Dutch West India Company Category:Dutch East India Company people Category:Dutch slave owners ","title":"Zacharias Wagenaer"},{"id":"12263476","text":"Switzerland national under-21 football team at the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship The Switzerland national under-21 football team is the national under-21 football team of Switzerland and is controlled by the Swiss Football Association.

History In the 10th century CE, they followed the Esmeraldas River up to the high Andean valley now developed as the city San Francisco de Quito. They defeated the local Quitu tribe and set up a kingdom. The combined Quitu-Cara culture was also known as the Shyris or Scyris civilization, or the Caranqui civilization, which thrived from 800 CE to the 1470s.\\"Ecuador Culture & Human History of the Northern Andes.\\" Ecuador Travel Guide. (retrieved 3 May 2011) For more than four centuries under the kings, called shyris, of the Cara, the Kingdom of Quito dominated much of highlands of modern Ecuador. The Cara and their allies were narrowly defeated in the epic battles of Tiocajas and Tix√°n in 1462, by an army of 250,000 led by T√∫pac Inca, the son of the Emperor of the Inca.Cevallos Alfredo Tinajero and Amparo Barba Gonz√°lez \\"Chronology of a Brief History of Ecuador\\". No date. After several decades of consolidation, the Kingdom of Quito became integrated into the Incan Empire. In 1534 the Quitu-Cara culture were conquered by the Spanish. They became extinct as a tribe chiefly from exposure to new European infectious diseases, which took a heavy toll in fatalities. In addition, the Spanish conquerors married Quitu-Cara women. Their descendants continued to intermarry, producing the mestizo population of the region who gradually became disconnected from their indigenous heritage. Historians Jacinto Jij√≥n y Caama√±o and Alfredo Pareja Diezcanseco contested the existence of such a Kingdom, and suggested that it was a legendary pre-Hispanic account. No archeological evidence of Quitu had been found. \\"Entre mitos y f√°bulas: El Ecuador Precolombino.\\" Ernesto Salazar.

Biography He was the son of Sir Thomas Greene and Lady Margaret Webb. His father was created Knight Bachelor of the Realm by James I in 1622 at Windsor Castle. Thomas came over from England on the Ark and Dove expedition in 1634. Greene was among the earliest settlers of the colony after its founding in 1634 as a haven of religious tolerance for English Catholics among other groups. He was already prominent in the politics of the colony by 1637 or 1638, when he became a prominent leader of moderate Catholics. More radical Catholics led by Thomas Cornwaleys resisted attempts by the colony's proprietor, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore to ensure a broader religious tolerance by, for example, restricting the activities of the Jesuits. Greene and others voted against some of these measures, but despite pressure from Cornwaleys and the Jesuits accepted the laws once they were passed. In 1647, Greene was appointed to the governorship by the colony's first governor, Leonard Calvert, as an emergency measure only hours before Calvert's death due to a sudden illness.Brugger, Robert J. (1988). Maryland: A Middle Temperament, 1634‚Äì1980. pp. 20‚Äì21. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. He was by this point one of the few early settlers still active in colonial leadership. Some, such as Leonard Calvert, had died and some, such as Thomas Cornwaleys, had returned to England. Greene, who had been a member of the colonial council prior to his appointment and was familiar with the issues confronting the colonial government, quickly set about strengthening the colonial militia in response to threats from the Nanticoke and Wicocomico tribes of Native Americans. Among his actions was the payment of arrears to soldiers at St. Inigoe's Fort as well as appointment of John Price as the new commander of colonial militia. These were necessary steps given that the colonial militia had been severely taxed during armed conflict with Virginian William Claiborne and his allies during the previous three years. Greene also appointed a number of Catholics to government offices, but was unable to build Catholic influence in the colony and suffered severe political setbacks when the Protestant-dominated colonial assembly passed legislation unfavorable to the proprietary government. By 1648, Cecilius Calvert replaced him with William Stone. Greene was a Catholic and a royalist, and some historians have speculated that Stone, a Protestant and supporter of Parliament, was appointed in his place to appease the Protestant majority in the colony. Following his removal from office, Greene served as Deputy Governor under Stone. In November 1649, while Stone was in neighbouring Virginia, Greene used this position to publicly declare Maryland in support of Prince Charles, the heir to the English throne. Earlier that year, the Prince's father, King Charles I, had been executed by the mainly Puritan Parliamentarians in the culminating event of the English Civil War. Stone quickly returned and retracted the declaration, but the event was enough to convince Parliament to appoint Protestant commissioners Richard Bennett and William Claiborne to help oversee the colony. Bennett and Claiborne appointed a Protestant council to oversee the colony, creating some confusion as to whether this council of the proprietary governor and his deputies was in charge. The council, among other decisions, rescinded the Maryland Toleration Act which had guaranteed religious freedom in the colony and banned Catholics from worshiping openly. Stone attempted to regain control of the colony by force, but was defeated in the Battle of the Severn. Ancestry The Greene family of Maryland did not descend from the Green family of Norton's Green, but rather through the illegitimate child of Sir John Norton of Northwood, Sir Thomas Norton who took on the alias Greene; hence the descendants surname of Greene.Hasted Hist. of Kent 6 (1798): 24‚Äì34, 201‚Äì202, 288. He was descended from Nicholas de Norton, who lived in the reign of King Stephen, and was possessed of much land in the neighbourhood of Norton and Faversham, as appeared by the chartulary of the monastery of St. Augustine. Governor Thomas Greene was the son of Sir Thomas Greene of Bobbing Kent and Margaret Webb of Frittenden, Kent, England. Gov. Thomas had three brothers; Jerimiah Greene, John Greene, and the Hon. Robert Greene, Lord of Bobbing Manor who had joined his brother in Maryland for a time, but returned to England as the eldest son to inherit his father's property. Governor Greene's father, Sir Thomas, was created a Knight Bachelor of the Realm by King James I on 5 September 1622.Harry Wright Newman.

Sir Thomas Greene's father was Sir Robert Green of Bobbing Kent who married Frances Darrel, daughter of Thomas Darrel of Scotney. Sir Robert was the son of Sir Thomas Norton alias Greene and his wife Alice Heveningham, daughter of Sir George Heveningham. George, by his mother Alice Bruyn, was a first cousin of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk.Douglas Richardson.

Retrieved 20 September 2012. Sir Thomas was the illegitimate child of Sir John Norton of Northwood through whom the family descended. Between 1536 and 1541, Sir Thomas Norton Greene was granted royal favours by Henry VIII. During the dissolution of the monasteries the rectory at Bobbing Manor along with \\"all manors, messuages, glebe, tithes and hereditaments in the parishes and fields of Bobbing, Iwade, Halstow, and Newington\\" were granted to him by the King. Sir John Norton of Northwood's wife was Joan Northwood, co-heiress with her brother to the estates of John Northwood, Esq. Sir John Norton's father was Sir Reginald Norton of Lee's Court in Sheldwich, Kent who married Katherine Dryland of Cooksditch in Faversham, Kent, England.The Ark and the Dove Adventurers By George Ely Russell, Donna Valley Russell Lees Court Sir Reginald's grandfather Sir John Norton married Lucy At-Lese. It was through her that their descendants came into the possession of Lees Court alias Sheldwich, some of whom lie buried at Faversham. The property of Lees Court which seems to have comprehended the manor of Sheldwich, became the property of that family during the reign of Edward I. From their residence at the Lees, the family assumed the name of At-Lese, their mansion here being called Lees- court, a name which this manor itself soon afterwards adopted, being called THE MANOR OF LEESCOURT, alias SHELDWICH. It was the previously mentioned Sir John Norton of Northwood who alienated this manor to Sir Richard Sondes, of Throwley, whose son Sir George Sondes, K. B. succeeding him in it, pulled down a great part of the old mansion of Lees-court, soon after the death of King Charles I. He then completed the present mansion of Lees-court, the front of which is built after a design of Inigo Jones, to which he afterwards removed from the ancient mansion of his family at Throwley.England's topographer: or A new and complete history of the county of Kent; from the earliest records to the present time, including every modern improvement. Embellished with a series of views from original drawings by Geo. Shepherd, H. Gastineau, &c.; with historical, topographical, critical, & biographical delineations by William Henry Ireland The current court was inherited and is currently inhabited by Phyllis Kane, Countess Sondes, wife of the former Henry George Herbert, 5th Earl Sondes Milles-Lade who died in 1996. Marriage and Issue In 1634, the Hon. Thomas Greene married Anne Gerard. Anne was a passenger on the Ark and the Dove said to have come over with her brother Sir Richard K.B. Gerard. Originally Anne was listed as Mrs. Anne Cox as a passenger on the Ark and the Dove, but research has begun on the theory that she was most likely the sister of Sir Richard K.B. Gerard who made the voyage as well. Author Harry Newman states that \\"Mistress Ann Cox\\" was one of the few \\"gentlewomen\\" on the initial voyage of the Ark and the Dove that sailed from England to Maryland. Another author, Edwin W. Beitzell, states that Ann Cox was actually Ann Gerard, sister of Richard and Thomas Gerard who also arrived in Maryland on the Ark and Dove. He states that she was the widow of someone named Cox. However, he does not give a source for that statement or relationship. On the other hand, \\"Mrs. Ann Cox\\" received a special grant of of land from Lord Baltimore in 1633. The title \\"Mrs.\\" in that land grant suggests that possibly Cox was a married rather than a maiden name. Thomas and Anne were wed in 1634 on the banks of the St. George River. Their marriage was considered to have been the first Christian marriage performed in Maryland and had issue. * Thomas Greene (1635 ‚Äì c. 1665) * Leonard Greene (1637‚Äì1688). Married Anne Clark and had issue. Leonard's godparent was Leonard Calvert. Their daughter Mary married Francis Marbury. Thomas married Mistress Winifred Seybourne [Seaborne] (b. abt 1610, England) on 2 April 1643 and had issue. Mistress Winifred Seybourne emigrated to Maryland in 1638 who by her title indicated gentle birth and likewise one who arrived to the age of discretion to be recognised as a femme sole in matter of ethics and business. On 30 July 1638, she received 100 acres for transporting herself and another 100 for transporting Mistress Troughan. She emigrated, that is, financed her own passage thus indicating a lady of means. * Robert Greene (1646‚Äì1716) * Francis Greene (1648‚Äì1707) A third wife is often cited for Thomas Green, Millicent Browne. There is a Thomas and Millicent Green residing in Stafford County Virginia a few years after the death of Governor Thomas Green, therefore, Millicent Browne was not another wife of this Thomas. The house Green's Inheritance was built by Francis Caleb Green, on part of the of land granted in 1666 to the sons of Thomas Greene, the second Provincial Governor of Maryland. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

Construction began in July 1776, following the American defeat in Canada, and continued through the winter and spring of 1777. After the American retreat on July 5 and 6, 1777, British and German troops occupied Mount Independence until November 1777. After the American Revolution, Mount Independence was farm land, used for grazing sheep and cattle. It is now a state historic site, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1972 for its historical significance. Mount Independence State Historic Site 200pxThe Mount Independence Visitor Center is open daily from the end of May through mid-October. Mount Independence State Historic Site is a Vermont State Historic Site with a museum and of hiking trails.

Geography  Previously named Rattlesnake Hill, Mount Independence is located in Orwell, Vermont, on the east side of Lake Champlain opposite Ticonderoga, New York, and historic Fort Ticonderoga. At its narrowest, the lake is a quarter mile wide between Mount Independence and Ticonderoga. Mount Independence is slightly more than a in length and less than at its widest. Precipitous cliffs rise from the lake on the west and from East Creek to the east and the low land to the southeast. At its height, the Mount rises about above lake level. The point juts into the lake nearly due north.Williams, John A. \\"Mount Independence in Time of War, 1776‚Äì1783,\\" Vermont History (April 1967) 2: 61. History = Pre-European contact = Mount Independence was important to Native Americans as a source of high quality blue/black chert used for making tools and projectile points. Mount Independence chert was traded across the Northeast. East Creek and the wetlands of the East Creek valley were a rich source of fish, waterfowl, freshwater mussels, beaver, deer, and other animals.Peebles, Giovanna M. \\"Orwell's East Creek Valley: A Window Into Vermont's Early Woodland Past,\\" The Journal of Vermont Archaeology 5 (2004), 1‚Äì22. = American Revolution =  Origins of the American fort  Major General Philip Schuyler The decision to fortify Mount Independence was made at Fort Crown Point on July 7, 1776, by a Council of War presided over by Northern Department Commander and Major General Philip Schuyler. Less than a week earlier, an American army had returned after a disastrous ten-month invasion of Canada. Morale was low, and the defeated army was ravaged by smallpox.\\"Minutes of a Council of War\\", July 7, 1776, American Archives, Ser. 5, 1: 234. In a letter, Schuyler told commander in chief George Washington, the peninsula opposite Ticonderoga was \\"so remarkably strong as to require little labour [sic] to make it tenable against a vast superiority of force, and fully to answer the purpose of preventing the enemy from penetrating into the country south of it.\\"Philip Schuyler to George Washington, July 12, 1776, American Archives, Ser. 5, 1: 232‚Äì233. Twenty-one field officers objected to the move from Crown Point to Mount Independence, but on July 11 work began on the new site under the direction of military engineer Jeduthan Baldwin of Brookfield, Massachusetts. Within the week, much of the army relocated to Ticonderoga while men labored on Mount Independence to clear the forest and build huts and barracks.\\"Remonstrance of Col. Stark and Officers\\", July 8, 1776, American Archives, Ser. 5,1: 233‚Äì234; Baldwin, Thomas Williams (ed.). The Revolutionary Journal of Col. Jeduthan Baldwin, 1775‚Äì1778. Bangor, Maine (1906), 59. The peninsula gained its new name on Sunday, July 28, 1776, after Colonel Arthur St. Clair of Pennsylvania read the Declaration of Independence to assembled troops.  Fortifications  Thaddeus Ko≈õciuszko 304x304px Mount Independence is a naturally strong defensive position. Unlike Fort Ticonderoga, which dominated the portage from Lake George to Lake Champlain but was open to attack from the north, Mount Independence presented a formidable obstacle to an invader from Canada. At the height of the American fortification of Mount Independence in the late fall of 1776, the site was occupied by three brigades of New England troops or more than six thousand men, which were reinforced by temporary militia from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and the New Hampshire Grants (the territory that was to become Vermont). Numerous huts and barracks housed these troops. An extensive breastwork with a battery of 28 cannons was built at the northern point of the peninsula. Above that position was the Citadel or Horseshoe battery. A star- shaped picket fort was later constructed on the height of land. A floating bridge of logs covered with planks connected Mount Independence and Ticonderoga. A wider and more permanent bridge, referred to as the Great Bridge, had been designed by Jeduthan Baldwin and was nearing completion at the time the American army abandoned the post in July 1777. A -long by -wide two-story hospital was under construction in the southwest. There were storehouses, workshops, and a gunpowder laboratory, and a powder magazine.Wintersmith, Charles (surveyor). \\"Plan of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence\\". (1777). In the late spring of 1777, batteries designed by Polish military engineer Thaddeus Ko≈õciuszko were constructed on the southeast side of Mount Independence. During the four-month British and German occupation five blockhouses were begun to defend the east side against attack by land.  Summer and fall 1776  During the summer and fall of 1776, troops on Mount Independence labored to prepare for a British invasion from Canada. At the same time on the west side of Lake Champlain, fortifications were built to the north of old Fort Ticonderoga. In Skenesborough, today's Whitehall, New York, a fleet of gunboats and row galleys was constructed to defend the lake. Masts were lowered into place at Mount Independence where a rocky outcropping drops sharply to the water. Vessels were also rigged and armed with cannon at the Mount.Bellico, Russell P. Sails and Steam in the Mountains: A Maritime and Military History of Lake George and Lake Champlain. Purple Mountain Press, (1992), pg. 139. By the end of October 1776, there were more than 13,000 men defending the fortifications at Mount Independence and Ticonderoga, making the location one of the largest population centers in the new country. Major General Horatio Gates commanded in the summer and fall of 1776. The troops at Mount Independence and Ticonderoga were commanded by Major General Horatio Gates, who had served as adjutant general of the Continental Army under George Washington. Gates reported to Northern Department commander Philip Schuyler, who remained in Albany, New York. The relationship between the two men was strained and worsened during the following winter and spring. Brigadier General Benedict Arnold commanded a brigade quartered on Mount Independence before Gates gave him the command of the Lake Champlain fleet. On October 11, 1776, in a day-long battle off Valcour Island in the northern lake, the outgunned American fleet was crippled but managed to escape. However, over the next two days, most of the vessels were destroyed. British forces under Governor General Guy Carleton occupied Fort Crown Point.Bellico, Sails and Steam in the Mountains, 152‚Äì159. Expecting an attack momentarily, the troops at the American forts prepared for battle while messengers carried orders calling for militia and supplies. \\"Every one [sic] exerts himself to the utmost, for an approaching battle ‚Äì our works go on day and night without cessation,\\" wrote one observer.Beebe, Lewis. \\"Journal of a Physician on the Expedition Against Canada, 1776,\\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography. (October 1935) pg. 355. On October 28, after days of facing headwinds, British vessels approached the American forts. John Trumbull, the future artist of the American Revolution but a young staff officer at the time, described the scene in his autobiography. \\"The whole summit of cleared land, on both sides of the lake, was crowned with redoubts and batteries, all manned with a splendid show of artillery and flags. The number of our troops under arms that day (principally however militia) exceeded thirteen thousand.\\" The British boats retreated at sunset and within a few days all the forces at Crown Point had retired to Canada.Trumbull, John.

Winter 1776‚Äì1777  Anthony Wayne commanded the Lake Champlain forts during the winter of 1776‚Äì1777. Colonel (and beginning in February 1777, Brigadier General) Anthony Wayne of Pennsylvania commanded at Mount Independence and Ticonderoga during the winter of 1776‚Äì1777. The number of men at the forts declined to fewer than 3000 in December and by mid-February under 1200.Still√©, Charles J. Major-General Anthony Wayne and the Pennsylvania Line in the Continental Army (Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Co., 1893). There were ambitious construction plans for the winter, but in fact survival was a challenge. Men cleared the Mount for firewood and often destroyed unoccupied huts and defensive barriers for fuel. Dysentery was widespread in the early winter and was followed by what Dr. Ebenezer Elmer, who was stationed on Mount Independence, termed \\"inflammatory disorders of a very complex nature.\\"\\"Journal of Ebenezer Elmer,\\" Proceedings of the New Jersey Historical Society (1848) vol 3, no.1, pgs. 48, 51. Rations were inadequate. Wayne told the Pennsylvania Council of Safety that the men lacked \\"every necessary except flour and bad beef.\\"Still√©, Major-General Anthony Wayne, p. 53. To maintain discipline, he often ordered the troops to shave and to powder their hair before marching for hours upon the frozen lake. As spring approached, Wayne continued to request men and supplies, writing to Major General Schuyler, \\"I must beg, sir, that you would once more endeavor to rouse the public officers in those States from their shameful lethargy before it be too late. I do assure you there is not one moment to spare in bringing in troops and necessary supplies.\\"Smith, Williams Henry. The St. Clair Papers: The life and public services of Arthur St. Clair. Cincinnati (1882) vol. 1, p. 387.  Spring 1777  The map of the Lake Champlain forts used at the court-martial of General Arthur St. Clair following his decision to abandon Ticonderoga and Mount Independence. The pace of work increased in late March with the return of engineer Jeduthan Baldwin. The Great Bridge connecting Mount Independence and Ticonderoga was the first of many projects. Caissons ‚Äì log cabin-like structures ‚Äì were begun on the ice and then dragged into holes cut in the frozen surface. Later, the caissons were started close to shore and then floated into place where work continued. Eventually 22 caissons stabilized with stone ballast rose above the water.Baldwin, pgs. 94‚Äì95; McLaughlin, Scott Arthur.

Mount Independence and Ticonderoga had a series of commanders during the spring, but finally on June 12 Major General Arthur St. Clair of Pennsylvania took charge. In mid June 1777, an American army of only 2000 healthy enlisted men defended fortifications that stretched from the batteries on the southeast of Mount Independence, across Lake Champlain to numerous redoubts on the flats north of old Fort Ticonderoga, the extensive French Lines, and a fort built on the high ground called Mount Hope. St. Clair was to write later, \\"Had every man I had, been disposed in single file on the different works and along the lines of defence [sic], they would have been scarcely within the reach of each other's voices.\\"St. Clair, Arthur; United States House of Representatives. Narrative of the Manner in which the Campaign Against the Indians, in the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Ninety Was Conducted, Under the Command of Major General St. Clair. Philadelphia (1812), 244‚Äì245. When he returned to overall command in the Northern Department in early June, General Schuyler considered abandoning the Ticonderoga side of the lake where the lines were overextended. After a Council of General Officers on June 20, work intensified on Mount Independence. Cannon and supplies were also moved to the Mount in preparation to withdrawing from Ticonderoga.Proceedings of the General Court Martial, held at White Plains in the state of New-York by order of his Excellency General Washington for the Trial of Major General St. Clair, August 25, 1778, New-York Historical Society Collections vol. 13 (1880), 24‚Äì25. By the end of June the Americans were certain that the British were advancing in force. In fact, Lieutenant General John Burgoyne had 8000 British and German troops and 138 cannon for the attack on the forts. On July 2, the American position on the Ticonderoga side of the lake began to crumble as the British mounted cannon on the high ground to the north facing the American lines. Fighting for the British, German troops from the Duchy of Brunswick under command of Major General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel marched east with a goal of cutting off Mount Independence by seizing the narrow land between East Creek and Lake Champlain. On July 5, British gunners began to construct a battery on Sugar Hill or Mount Defiance, a mountain on the west side of the lake that dominated both Mount Independence and Ticonderoga. Historians continue to debate how decisive the British cannon on Mount Defiance were in the American decision to retreat, but a council of war held that afternoon agreed unanimously to abandon first Ticonderoga and then Mount Independence.Trial Maj.

The American retreat was scheduled to begin at midnight, July 5‚Äì6, and to be conducted in silence without fires or even candlelight. However, Brigadier General Matthias Alexis Roche de Fermoy, a French soldier of fortune, burned his house on Mount Independence, alerting the British to the retreat.Trial Maj. Gen.

The Mount Independence-Hubbardton 1776 Military Road. Benson, Vt. (1968). The sick and wounded made their way to the landing at the southern end of Mount Independence and were taken by boat to Skenesborough along with supplies and cannon. The American flotilla on the narrow lake consisted of six war vessels and about 200 bateaux.Cubbison, Douglas R. Burgoyne and the Saratoga Campaign; His Papers. Arthur H. Clark Company (1012), pg. 63. Quickly the British were in pursuit, crossing the floating bridge and seizing the fortifications on Mount Independence. In an old tale that may be apocryphal, four Americans left to guard the bridge were found by a charged cannon, passed out after drinking Madeira.Duling, Ennis. \\"Thomas Anburey at the Battle of Hubbardton: How a Fraudulent Source Misled Historians,\\" Vermont History. Winter/Spring (2010), 2, 11. British vessels broke through the boom and bridge, and followed the American boats to Skenesborough where that afternoon they destroyed the remainder of the fleet and captured the cannon and supplies. Brigadier General Simon Fraser and about 1200 men pursued the Americans on foot. The next morning, July 7, they met at the Battle of Hubbardton. By 18th-century standards it was a British victory, but more recently the battle has been called a \\"classic example of a rear guard action.\\" As a result of Hubbardton, Fraser stopped his pursuit of the main American army.Williams, John. The Battle of Hubbardton: The American Rebels Stem the Tide. Vermont Division for Historic Preservation (1988), pg. 5.  British and German occupation  Following the American withdrawal, Mount Independence was occupied by both British and German troops. For time, wounded American prisoners from the Battle of Hubbardton were treated in the new hospital on the Mount. More than six hundred German troops of the Prince Frederick Regiment defended the fortifications on the southeast side of the Mount where the fort might be attacked from land. Brigadier General Henry Watson Powell had overall command of the forts. On September 18, Americans surprised Ticonderoga in attack that is known as Brown's Raid after Colonel John Brown of Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Mount Defiance was taken by Vermont Ranger Captain Ebenezer Allen. Two hundred ninety-three British soldiers were captured, and 118 American prisoners were set free. Old Fort Ticonderoga was threatened.\\"John Brown and the Dash for Ticonderoga.\\" The Bulletin of the Fort Ticonderoga Museum, vol.II, no.1 (Jan 1930). The attack on Mount Independence was commanded by Colonel Samuel Johnson and then by militia brigadier general Jonathan Warner, both of Massachusetts. Shots were exchanged and a surrender note was sent and ignored. One British officer laughed at the American effort. \\"It is an undenyable [sic] truth that the Mount was never attacked by the Rebels otherwise than by paper,\\" wrote Lieutenant John Starke, captain of the schooner-of-war Maria.\\"Col. John Brown's Attack of September, 1777, on Fort Ticonderoga,\\" Bulletin of the Fort Ticonderoga Museum, vol. XI, no. 4 (July 1964), pg. 209. The Americans withdrew on September 21. On November 8, following Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga, British and German forces took what they could load aboard their vessels; threw other supplies in the lake; burned barracks, houses, and bridges; disabled about 40 cannon; and retreated to Canada.Collections of the Vermont Historical Society.

It is likely that George Washington visited Mount Independence during the summer 1783 after the fighting had stopped but before the Treaty of Paris was signed. In 1785 Matthew Lyon, future U.S. congressman, salvaged cannon and other scrap iron on the site for his iron forge in Fair Haven, Vermont. Mount Independence became a stop for early tourists. It is likely that future U.S. presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison visited in their 1791 tour of lakes George and Champlain. Historian and travel writer Benson J. Lossing visited for his 1853 The Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution. He described the Mount as covered with second growth trees except where the parade grounds were.Lossing, Benson J. The Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution. Harper& Brothers (1860), vol. 1, pgs. 147‚Äì148. During the nineteenth century and much of the twentieth century, Mount Independence was farmland, used for grazing sheep and cattle and for maple sugaring. Maple sugaring continues today. In 1911 Stephen Pell of Fort Ticonderoga purchased at the northern end of Mount Independence. Beginning in 1961, the State of Vermont began to purchase parcels of land at the southern end of Mount Independence. Today the Fort Ticonderoga Association and the Vermont Division of Historic Preservation have joint stewardship of the Mount. In the late 1960s, the Vermont Electric Power Company (VELCO) proposed building a nuclear plant, to be known as Hugh Crossing, in Orwell. The plan called for damming East Creek to make a 1700 acre cooling pond about a from where the creek meets Lake Champlain. Both historical and environmental concerns led to the project's defeat.Peebles, \\"Orwell's East Creek Valley,\\" 2‚Äì4. In 1996, the Vermont Division of Historic Preservation opened a Visitor Center and museum at the southern end of the Mount.

Phillip Calvert (c. 1626 - c. December 22, 1682), also known as Hon. Philip Calvert, was the fifth Governor of Maryland during a brief period in 1660 or 1661. He was appointed by the royally chartered proprietor of Maryland, Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore (1637‚Äì1715), as a caretaker to replace Lt. Gen Josias Fendall (1628‚Äì1682), the fifth/sixth? provincial governor. Life Calvert came to Maryland on the first expedition under first colonial governor Leonard Calvert (1606-1647), younger brother of the second Lord Baltimore Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605-1675). In 1656, he was made secretary of the Province and one of its Councillors. After the treason and overthrow of Governor Fendall, Calvert became governor in 1660, and displayed clemency in pardoning Fendall. In 1661, Capt. Charles Calvert (1688‚Äì1734), illegitimate son of the Proprietor, was made Governor, and Philip was appointed Deputy-Lieutenant and Councillor of the Province. After this, he negotiated a treaty with the Dutch in which they agreed to abandon the disputed territory on the Delaware River.

Examination of these remains provided scientists and historians with significant insight regarding life in 17th century Maryland. DNA analysis in 2016 showed the male adult and the infant have a father-son relationship, verifying the infant as a child of Phillip Calvert.

The band's sound evolved considerably through its career, starting off as a Bay Area-influenced punk band, moving on to a much heavier metallic-tinted sound to finally taking on a much lighter brand of melodic punk as the years passed. The band's career ended in 2012 following Tony Sly's death on July 31 of that year. History No Use For a Name was formed in 1986 by longtime friends Dodge, Papoutsis and Koff. The early rehearsals of the band had taken place at a warehouse in Sunnyvale owned by Koff's father, where they also came up with the name for the band. During this era, the band was fronted by Papoutsis' friend John Meyer. Initially a four piece, it later expanded to a six piece, adding as a co-vocalist Ramon Gras and a second guitarist Doug Judd. The band experienced many line up changes during this period. In 1987, Dodge left to play in another Bay Area punk band, Stikky, while in summer that year, both Meyer and Judd left the band with Tony Sly replacing Judd on guitar. This line-up first appeared on Maximum RocknRoll's 1987 Turn it Around compilation, with the song \\"Gang Way\\". In 1988, Gras fell out with the rest of the band and left before an important show at Gilman and a live appearance on the KFJC radio show. In a tight spot, the band asked the former guitarist Dodge, who before the formation of No Use had sung in other local bands, to rejoin as vocalist, which he agreed. This line-up of the band recorded two EPs; No Use For a Name on Woodpecker Records and Let 'em Out on on Slap A Ham Records. In 1989, Dodge left again which allowed Sly to take over vocals and songwriting. NUFAN's first album, Incognito, was released in 1990 by New Red Archives. It was the only album by the band recorded as a trio. In 1991, Dodge rejoined on second guitar and they released their second album, Don't Miss the Train, in 1992 before signing up with Fat Mike's label Fat Wreck Chords in 1993. In late 1992, Dodge left the line-up, and was replaced by the guitarist Robin Pfefer, who took over on lead guitar so that Sly could step down to rhythm and concentrate on singing. No Use for a Name also released their first record on Fat Wreck Chords that year, The Daily Grind (EP), which turned out to be highly successful. Ed Gregor replaced Pfefer on lead guitar soon after the release of The Daily Grind. In 1995, after the release of Leche Con Carne, their third full-length album, Chris Shiflett and Matt Riddle joined the band to play guitar and bass guitar, replacing Gregor and Papoutsis respectively. With the punk music breakthrough in 1994, No Use for a Name received a larger audience after releasing this album, thanks to their video for the song \\"Soulmate\\" which was played on the MTV show 120 Minutes. This was the first video from Fat Wreck Chords to appear on MTV. In 1997, after the success of Making Friends, the band toured the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan. After releasing More Betterness!, Shiflett left the band in 1999 to join the successful Foo Fighters, being replaced by Dave Nassie. Two years later, the band released a live album, Live in a Dive: No Use for a Name on Fat Wreck Chords and, in 2002, No Use for a Name released its sixth studio album, Hard Rock Bottom. The band released its eighth full-length studio album, Keep Them Confused, on June 14, 2005. It takes a more political position than earlier releases. A greatest hits collection, All the Best Songs, was released on July 10, 2007. A new fourteen song full-length studio album entitled The Feel Good Record of the Year was released on April 1, 2008. In 2009, when promoting the album in Europe, Nassie left the band to join the Bleeding Through. In August 2009, the band announced that Nassie had been replaced by Chris Rest, Lagwagon's guitarist and founding member of Rich Kids on LSD.Lagwagon-ba harapott a No Use for a Name ShortScore.net (August 22, 2009.) In December 2010, Koff told the band that he would need time off from touring to go full time with his snowplow business and he was eventually replaced by a new full- time drummer, Boz Rivera (of King City, Rich Kids on LSD, and The Mad Caddies). =Sly's death= Tony Sly died in his sleep on July 31, 2012. \\\\- Riddle, Rest and Rivera played a tribute performance to Sly at the Envol & Macadam Festival in Qu√©bec City on September 8, 2012, along with the former No Use for a Name members Nassie and Koff. This was intended to be the band's final performance, with Riddle commenting, \\"This is the last No Use for a Name show ever. No one wants to do this without Tony,\\" The band's final show before Sly's death had also been in Quebec, at the D-Tox Rockfest in Montebello on June 15, 2012. but they reunited twice more as No Use and Friends for Fat Wreck Chord's 25th Anniversary Show in August 2015, and Groezrock 2016 in Belgium.

He was appointed by the royally chartered proprietor of Maryland, Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore. Following his death, Wharton was briefly succeeded by Cecil Calvert, infant son of Charles Calvert, before the next Governor, Thomas Notley, was appointed. Life Wharton emigrated to Maryland from the English colony in Barbados in 1670. He quickly became a successful planter and politician in the colony, holding several political offices and amassing 11 slaves and more than before his death only six years after his arrival. Once in the colony, Wharton married Elizabeth Sewall, the daughter of a politically prominent local settler named Henry Sewall. Wharton became a member of the Governor's Council in 1672 and became the Deputy Governor in 1676, with de facto gubernatorial authority, for a brief period before his death. At the time, the nominal Governor of the colony was Cecil Calvert, the infant son of the colony's proprietor. In reality, the Governor's Council led by Wharton ruled the colony, and he is listed by the Maryland State Archives as having been a colonial governor. Wharton's appointment passed over four more senior members of the Council, including Philip Calvert. The appointment came at a dangerous time for the colony, when threats from both within and outside its settlers loomed. Settlers on the western shore feared an attack from hostile Native Americans, and earlier that year the colony had armed some friendly tribes in preparation for just such an eventuality. Next door in Virginia, Bacon's Rebellion threatened the colonial order itself. These twin crises reached a peak in July, when the rebellion in Virginia succeeded in toppling its colonial government and settlers on the western shore were warned to arm themselves against an imminent native attack. In the midst of this crisis, and only a little more than a month after assuming office, Wharton died. He had only governed the colony from Charles Calvert's departure on June 16, 1676 until he named Thomas Notley as his successor just prior to his death in July of the same year. Upon his death, he left behind one son, Henry Wharton, and his wife, Elizabeth. She later remarried a man named William Digges.

In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Union, serving in the Soviet Navy after that as T-335. Construction and commissioning Originally classified as a \\"coastal minesweeper,\\" AMc-127, Barrier was reclassified as a \\"minesweeper,\\" AM-150, on 21 February 1942. She was laid down on 7 December 1942 at Tampa, Florida, by the Tampa Shipbuilding Company, Inc., launched on 23 February 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Eugenie Bradford, the wife of U.S. Navy Lieutenant L. M. Bradford, Assistant Technical Officer (Hull) at the builders yard, and commissioned on 10 May 1944 with Lieutenant Donald T. Ehrmann in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945= Following fitting out and shakedown training, Barrier transited the Panama Canal late in July 1944 and made a stop at San Francisco, California, early in August 1944 before beginning duty in the waters of the Territory of Alaska on 14 August 1944. She performed convoy escort and minesweeping duties in the Aleutian Islands for the next 11 months. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Barrier proceeded to Cold Bay in the summer of 1945 to begin the training of her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945-1956= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Barrier was decommissioned on 19 July 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-335 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Barrier to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-150 on 7 February 1955. Disposal The Soviet Union scrapped T-335 in 1956. Unaware of the ship's fate, the U.S. Navy carried Barrier on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her name on 1 January 1983.

It is often used to describe a social and relaxed situation. It can also indicate belonging, time spent with loved ones, catching up with an old friend or just the general togetherness that gives people a warm feeling. A common trait to all descriptions of gezelligheid is a general and abstract sensation of individual well-being that one typically shares with others. All descriptions involve a positive atmosphere, flow or vibe that colours the individual personal experience in a favorable way and in one way or another corresponds to social contexts. Being a vague, abstract notion, the word is considered by some to be an example of untranslatability, and one of their hardest words to translate to English. Some consider the word to encompass the heart of Dutch culture.Seth Stevenson, \\"The Quest for Gezellig,\\" in \\"Should I Move to Amsterdam,\\" Slate 23, Aug, 2005, available at http://www.slate.com/articles/life/welltraveled/features/2005/should_i_move_to_amsterdam/the_quest_for_gezellig.html. See also \\"Gezellig ‚Äî a word that encompasses the heart of Dutch Culture,\\" at http://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/155-gezellig  Etymology  The word derives from gezel which means 'companion' or 'friend'. During the Middle Ages a gezel was also the Dutch term for a 'journeyman', which in the Dutch guild system formed a group around a single master craftsman; hence the added meaning of 'belonging'.Van Dale etymologisch woordenboek 'Gezelligheid' translation; first draft  Use  Gezellig in English language could be used in places or with a party of people (one or more) that are 'easy to relax into' and 'heartening'. The adjective gezellig can be used in a wide variety of situations:All examples given come from the book The Undutchables, by C. White. * A room, restaurant, or caf√© can be gezellig (meaning 'cozy' or 'inviting'). * A person can be gezellig (meaning 'inviting' or 'pleasant' or 'funny', 'convivial' or 'sociable'). * A party can be gezellig (meaning 'relaxed atmosphere with nice people and cozy surroundings'). * A visit to one's grandparents can be gezellig (meaning 'togetherness'). Gezellig can also be used as an exclamation, which can either carry the meanings described above or be used sarcastically or ironically or to express enthusiasm for an upcoming event such as one of the above. The antonym to gezellig is ongezellig, which is used to describe places and situations that are uninviting, lacking in warmth or atmosphere, a person who is cold, distant, unsociable, unwilling to engage in a social situation.  Similar words  * The Norwegian and Danish word hygge () is very close in meaning. Etymologically, it is related to the Dutch word heugen, meaning 'to remember', and verheugen, meaning 'to look forward to'. * The German term Gem√ºtlichkeit (of which gemoedelijkheid is its Dutch cognate), invoking coziness and comfort and which has also been adopted by the English language, covers some of the possible meanings of gezellig, but not all. Although the German term Geselligkeit does look a lot like the Dutch word, it has a different meaning. * Norwegian also has the word: koseleg, meaning a 'sense of coziness' and 'human warmth in an agreeable environment'. * Swedish uses a term whose concept is very close: mysig, a pleasant and warm atmosphere of togetherness in a pleasant setting.

He was ordained in 1660. After a period of service as chaplain to Sir George Saville, later (1679) Lord Halifax, he came, as Rector to Eyam in 1664, with his wife Catherine, (daughter of Ralph Carr, Esq., of Cocken, County Durham).

Patrick Wallis, February 2005, London School of Economics (Department of Economic History) For example, despite insisting all villagers should remain in Eyam, Mompesson had his own children sent away to Sheffield in June 1666, just before the quarantine was agreed. At this time he also desired to send his wife Catherine with them but she refused to leave him, later succumbing to the plague. Mompesson did many things to help the village during the plague including preventing the spread of it by filling pockets drilled in the Boundary Stone full of vinegar for trading. This helped stop the spread of the plague by sterilising any coins that came in or out of Eyam.

It opened in 1838‚Äì1839 and it was successful in making an operating profit, but it was always desperately short of capital. It used the track gauge of . When the Aberdeen Railway was authorised in 1845, it leased the Arbroath and Forfar line to form part of its main line connecting Forfar and Aberdeen; it opened in 1848. The Aberdeen Railway was to be a standard gauge line and the A&FR; had to alter its track gauge. The A&FR; line formed part of the main line from Stirling to Aberdeen, and when the North British Railway started running to Aberdeen in 1881, their trains too ran over a very short section of the A&FR.; Nearly all of the A&FR; line was closed in 1967 when the former NBR route was selected as the only route to Aberdeen, and the short section immediately north of Arbroath is the only section of the A&FR; still in use. History =Conception and authorisation= In the early years of the nineteenth century there was an explosion in the volume of textile production in Forfarshire as industrialisation was introduced. The transport of raw materials and lime for agricultural purposes to inland towns, and of the finished products to market, were hampered by the poor transport facilities of the town. In 1817 the magistrates of Arbroath considered the construction of a canal to link Forfar, but the proposal was not adopted.David Turnock, The Historical Geography of Scotland Since 1707, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1982, As the need for a transport connection became more pressing, the idea of a railway was proposed, and in 1826 Stevenson and Blackadder surveyed a railway route; they planned an inclined plane to descend into Arbroath; the final approach to the harbour was to have been through the streets. This scheme too did not proceed, but it was revived in 1824, by which time a waggonway was a viable alternative; Robert Stevenson supervised the survey. The route would have involved a rope-worked inclined plane to descend to Arbroath Harbour; it too was not progressed. In 1835 a number of prominent citizens of Arbroath commissioned a review of possible routes for a railway, examining the waggonway proposal; technology had now proceeded to the point where a railway was the natural transport medium. The Edinburgh firm of railway engineers Grainger and Miller had been commissioned to carry out the review, and they proposed a route rather different to Stevenson's; the Dundee and Newtyle Railway had opened in 1832, and involved street running in Dundee itself. This was now seen as undesirable, and the final access to Arbroath Harbour was changed to be on dedicated land. The estimated cost of construction was ¬£36,871, and the scheme was launched to the public at a meeting of 7 August 1835; ¬£40,000 was subscribed within a month. A local man, William Lindsay Carnegie, was the dynamic force in promoting the railway scheme.C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722 - 1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, Niall Ferguson, The Arbroath & Forfar Railway, the Dundee Direct Line and the Kirriemuir Branch, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2000, Grainger and Miller were now instructed to carry out a detailed survey of the route so as to present a Parliamentary Bill. Hostility was encountered from the owner of Guthrie Castle, and from the turnpike trustees, and considerable revision to the initial route was incorporated. As the planning progressed, there was also a large increase in the price of materials, particularly iron for rails and chairs, and Grainger and Miller increased their estimate of cost to ¬£70,000. Grainger and Miller selected the track gauge of 5 ft 6 in (1,676 mm) as it seemed to them a suitable gauge; it was also proposed for the neighbouring Dundee and Arbroath Railway (for which they were the engineers). They had already used 4 ft 6 in on the coal lines of Lanarkshire, and were planning 4 ft 8.5 in for the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, so clearly the idea of a railway network was not yet known to them.David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Whishaw later reported that the engineer, Mr Grainger, > considers the English gauge [of 4ft 8¬Ωin] too narrow, and the Great Western > gauge [of 7ft 0¬ºin] too wide; he has, therefore, taken something like a > mean, which would enable him to allow sufficient space for the proper > construction of the locomotive engines, and also afford more useful space in > the carriages. The Parliamentary Bill was submitted to the 1836 session. Fierce opposition was experienced, chiefly from the turnpike trustees. Nonetheless the Act was duly authorised on 17 May 1836Whishaw says 19 May 1836 for a line from the harbour at Arbroath to Forfar. In the same session the Dundee and Arbroath Railway was authorised; it too was to run to the harbour at Arbroath.Leslie James, A Chronology of the Construction of Britain's Railways, 1778‚Äì1855, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1983, The desirability of the two lines connecting was obvious, and it was agree that this would be at Almericloss (adjoining Catherine Street). Old Almerie Close was a gentleman's residence off Guthrie Port immediately east of the Brothock Water, and New Almerie Close was a gentleman's residence near the junction of the present-day Bridge Street and Weavers Court.There are several variations of the spelling in use. This was very close to the main line of the Arbroath and Forfar line, and the significance of Almericloss is simply that a connection between the two lines there was contemplated.Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959John Wood, Plan of the Town of Arbroath from an Actual Survey, T Brown, Edinburgh, 1822 However at this stage the Dundee and Arbroath line was to follow closely the sea front into Arbroath from the west, and reaching Almericloss was impracticable. The D&AR; surveyed an alternative entry to Arbroath, described as the high level line, but the extra cost of this deterred actual implementation of the route, and although the authorising Acts for both companies referred to branches to Almericloss, there was no definite agreement to build them. =Construction and opening= The Arbroath and Forfar Railway in 1838Grainger and Miller designed the railway as a single line with passing places every 600 yards (550 metres) or so;It is not clear whether this arrangement was actually implemented; by the time the railway was built the more conventional system of more widely spaced passing places and timetabled train movements seems to have prevailed. this was their custom at the time, based on horse-drawn waggonways with no fixed timetable. The track was to consist of rails on stone blocks, and the track gauge was to be 5 ft 6in (1,384 mm). At this stage the Directors realised there was no body of experience regarding locomotives, and Grainger was commissioned to tour the manufacturers and users of locomotives to determine the appropriate specification. Cash flow soon became a serious problem; the Company found that many subscribers failed to respond to callsSubscribers only had to pay a small deposit at first; as work progressed, the Company would \\"call\\" for incremental payments in stages, but in the worsening financial climate, many initial subscribers defaulted. and the company had to take a loan of ¬£15,000 from the British Linen Bank. Contractors too had a problem; small concerns found it difficult to pay workers currently even though they would be paid later. The owner of Guthrie Castle made considerable objections to the railway, claiming that it would diminish his amenity. After much negotiation he was allocated ¬£1,400 by the A&FR; to build a railway bridge over his entrance gateway in an ornate style. It was \\"convincingly disguised as a castellated entry to the castle's main drive, [consisting] of a perpendicular Gothic archway flanked by octagonal towers with castellated tops and lancet windows.\\"Gordon Biddle and O S Nock, The Railway Heritage of Britain, Michael Joseph Limited, London, 1983, The expenditure on land acquisition, construction and rolling stock all exceeded the estimates, and as the construction neared completion, successive increases were tabled, ending at ¬£103,904. Two quarries were gearing up in anticipation of the advantage of rail connection: at Letham and Leysmill, within about 5 miles (8 km) of Forfar. In October 1838 some mineral traffic from the quarries to Forfar was carried. From Saturday 24 November 1838 passenger traffic between Forfar and Leysmill was started, using horse traction as the locomotives were not ready.W A C Smith and Paul Anderson, An Illustrated History of Tayside's Railways, Dundee and Perth, Irwell Press, Clophill, 1997, On 3 December 1838 the first locomotive was ready and the line was fully opened from Forfar to Arbroath.Ferguson, page 30; Carter and Awdry say 3 January 1839; Thomas and Turnock say Arbroath to Guthrie 4 December 1838 and Guthrie to Forfar 1 March 1839.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, =Early operations= There were two passenger trains each way at first.Apparently seven days a week. With only one locomotive, Victoria, primitive in its technology at this early date, reliability was soon an issue. Between 4 and 13 December Victoria was out of service and horse haulage had to be resorted to. In January Victoria was derailed at Arbroath, again necessitating horse traction. On 15 March 1839 a second locomotive, Caledonia, was delivered. The passenger service was increased to three daily trains. Goods and mineral traffic was picking up to the extent that additional wagons, and materials to make additional sidings, had to be procured. Trips to and from the Leysmill quarry were additional to the other train services, and the shortage of wagons meant that empty wagons returned there were reloaded at once; the locomotive often returned to Arbroath to get water while the loading took place. On 14 May 1839 the third locomotive was delivered; it was named Britannia. All the locomotives were of the 2-2-2 wheel arrangement. Traffic continued to increase steadily and at the annual general meeting in June 1839 weekly passenger journeys of more than 1,500 and weekly goods carryings of over 800 tons were reported, leading to a profit for the half-year of ¬£3,614. However the positive revenue position was underlain by heavy indebtedness, ¬£35,000 being owed to banks. In mid-August the passenger train service was further enhanced to four trains each way daily. Friockheim station from an old postcardTo resolve the shortage of capital, which was preventing very obviously needed improvements, an Act authorising an increase in share capital was passed on 3 April 1840; it authorised an additional ¬£55,000 of capital. Writing in 1842 following a site visit in 1841, Francis Whishaw reported that > We were much surprised, when examining this line in September last, to see a > party of reapers travelling by the third-class railway-carriages in > preference to walking to their work; and we found on enquiry that this was > by no means an isolated case, but of everyday occurrence. In fact, with the > low fares adopted on this line, it is more economical for the poor man to > ride than to walk. The line ran from \\"near the harbour\\" at Arbroath, with a passenger station at Catherine Street. The line ran broadly north to the kirk at St Vigean's (where the present-day line diverges right), and then continued north-west to Friockheim and then west to Guthrie and Forfar. The Forfar station was in the angle between Playfield (now Victoria Street) and Bailiewellbrae Road (now Carsburn Road). The line rose about 221 feet from Arbroath to Forfar: the steepest gradient was 1 in 130, and the curvature was gentle. The length of the line was a little over 15 miles. Although opened as a single line, the formation was made for a double line. In common with the neighbouring Dundee and Arbroath Railway, it had a track gauge of 5 ft 6in. Whishaw reports that the engineer, Mr Grainger, > considers the English gauge [of 4ft 8¬Ωin] too narrow, and the Great Western > gauge [of 7ft 0¬ºin] too wide; he has, therefore, taken something like a > mean, which would enable him to allow sufficient space for the proper > construction of the locomotive engines, and also afford more useful space in > the carriages.Francis Whishaw, The Railways of Great Britain and Ireland > Practically Described and Illustrated, 1842, reprint 1969, David & Charles > (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, The track was formed of parallel (i.e. not fish-belly) rails of 48 lbs per yard on timber cross-sleepers. The turntables were 12 feet in diameter. (This refers to wagon turntables, commonly used at this date for siding connections.) Apart from the terminal stations, there were six intermediate stations at Colliston, Leysmill, Friockheim, Guthrie, Auldbar Road, and Clocksbriggs, though at the start, \\"no great expense had been incurred in the erection of intermediate station-houses\\".Letter dated 25 February 1841 from the Secretary of the A&FR; in connection with the accident on the line on 12 February 1841, quoted in Reports to the Committee of Privy Council , volume XLI, 1842 =Linking with the Dundee and Forfar Railway= Arbroath, looking south; the new joint station is at top right; the A&FR; line to Catherine Street and the docks went straight onAs has been described, both the A&FR; and the Dundee and Forfar Railway had powers to build branches to Almericloss, intended as a joint goods depot and exchange point. In fact the A&FR; line passed immediately adjacent, but the D&AR; line hugged the sea front at Arbroath, and that company failed to build the authorised connecting line. In 1839 a horse omnibus was provided between the two passenger stations, and some attempt was made to co-ordinate the passenger timetables so as to allow connections. The following year it was agreed to make the connecting line. The D&FR; station was at Ladyloan about where Gayfield Park is today. The A&FR; had reached the docks from the beginning, and the connection was made by extending the D&FR; a short distance eastwards and upgrading the A&FR; line.It is not easy to follow Ferguson on this; on page 30 he says that the line opened in December 1830 \\"to Arbroath Harbour\\". On page 41 he says that \\"The line of track laid between the Dundee & Arbroath's station in Ladyloan and the Arbroath & Forfar's station ran straight up West Grimsby Street, crossing South and North Grimsby and Millgate Street before making a trailing connection with the Arbroath & Forfar's line where that line divided to enter its Catherine Street terminus.\\" This was the alignment of the A&FR; harbour line. There were no through passenger trains; in fact it is not clear that passenger trains ran on the line; and if they did whether D&AR; trains ran to the A&FR; station or A&FR; trains to the D&AR; station. The 1843 Bradshaw shows the two lines running with separate passenger timetables and a note in the D&AR; section that \\"Passengers wishing to proceed, will find a [road] coach waiting to convey them, free of charge, between the Arbroath station of the Forfar railway and the Arbroath station of this railway.\\"Bradshaw's Monthly General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide, 3rd Mo (March) 1843, London There was however a pooling arrangement for goods wagons across the two networks. =Financial downturn= The railways of ArbroathIn the first years of operation, the railway was running at a healthy profit; its financial difficulties were confined to lack of capital. It had resolved that problem by issuing 5% preference shares under the 1840 Act. That money significantly reduced the available money for distribution to ordinary shareholders. Moreover, the original permanent way was not as durable as had been hoped, and significant sums had to be expended on upkeep; in addition the government passenger tax was a heavy burden. In 1842 there was no dividend for ordinary shareholders and there was no money for necessary improvements on the line. =Trunk railways= The Arbroath and Forfar Railway had been a pioneering local railway. By the 1840s the English railway network was taking shape and a great deal of thought was given to connecting central Scotland with England, and bringing northern towns into the network. Amid considerable controversy, the Caledonian Railway was authorised in 1845 connecting Carlisle with Glasgow and Edinburgh; in the same session, there was a frenzy of railway authorisations, including the Scottish Central Railway, the Scottish Midland Junction Railway and the Aberdeen Railway. Together these lines were to link central Scotland with Stirling, Perth, Forfar and Aberdeen. In the preparation for the Bills for the 1845 Parliamentary session, the A&FR; was approached in March 1844 by the promoters of the Aberdeen and East Coast of Scotland Railway. (This soon became simply \\"the Aberdeen Railway\\".) They wished to build a line from Aberdeen to Friockheim, and run trains from there via Arboath to Dundee over the D&AR.; At the same time the promoters of the Scottish Midland Junction Railway were planning to build from Perth to Forfar, creating a through route from the south to Aberdeen partly over the A&FR.; In the frenzy of railway schemes at this time, there was now to be a line between Dundee and Perth, and the Aberdeen Railway was considering using that route to Perth. The SMJR seem to have taken offence, and in retaliation declared that they would build their own line from Forfar via Brechin to Laurencekirk. The threat may have been an empty one, but the A&FR; realised its own position was not strong. For some time there was controversy over the Forfar station; the SMJR proposed a line passing it, and joining the A&FR; line a mile or so on, facing away from the station. How would through trains call at Forfar? After much discussion the solution was agreed: the SMJR line would provide a Forfar station on its own line. Only now during the 1845 Parliamentary session, did it emerge that the trunk railways would be made to the standard gauge; the A&FR; and the D&AR; would have to alter their gauge to suit, and moreover to provide double track. The cost of the A&FR; part of that work was estimated to be ¬£43,600: money that the A&FR; could not hope to raise. The solution was to lease the line to the Aberdeen Railway and allow it to carry out the works. This was agreed and a lease charge of 5.25% on the capital value of the converted A&FR; line was agreed; in addition 50% of any operating profit (after payment of the lease charge) would come to the A&FR.; The effective date was to be 1 February 1848. =Getting the line ready for main line operation= On 31 July 1845 several important Scottish lines were authorised; these included both the Aberdeen Railway and the Scottish Midland Junction Railway. In July 1846 the Dundee and Arbroath Railway commenced to build the \\"high level\\" connection between its line and Almericloss, just beyond the A&FR; Catherine Street station; there was to be a new joint passenger station near the A&FR; station, facing Keptie Street. The route left the original main line west of Rosemount Road and followed the present-day alignment across the north-west flank of the town. The A&FR; was not so quick to take action, but work started later laying a new standard gauge line on the north side of the existing single track broad gauge line. The new track would have transverse timber sleepers and wrought iron rails, but the old track was simply to be regauged, not modernised. The Aberdeen Railway objected to that and required the old track to be strengthened in modern materials. This required considerable extra cost, and the A&FR; now had to seek yet further additional funds to pay for the work. In addition the locomotives and rolling stock needed to be converted, or new equipment obtained. A considerable quantity of rolling stock was considered to be unsuitable for conversion and was sold or scrapped. The locomotives Victoria and Caledonia were converted, but three other engines and much rolling stock was sold at auction on 28 December 1848. Britannia and Princess were purchased by a Canadian company, the Montreal and Lachine Railroad, working there and on the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad until 1859. On 7 July 1847 the first standard gauge trains ran on the A&FR;, and work started on converting the gauge of the remaining broad gauge track. The link at Arbroath with the D&AR; had been in use for goods trains since 23 December 1847, and passenger trains used the link from 1 February 1848, using a temporary joint station structure at first, and the A&FR; station became a goods depot. The Ladyloan D&AR; station and the lien approaching it closed immediately. The new permanent joint station opened fully much later, on 14 December 1858.The Joint Station is referred to as \\"Arbroath Junction Station\\" on some Ordnance Survey maps of the period. =The Aberdeen Railway opens= The Aberdeen Railway started operation on 1 February 1848; the Arbroath and Forfar line, leased in perpetuity, was simply a branch of the larger concern, which itself was just one link in a chain of railways. For a period the Aberdeen Railway, itself gripped by shortage of capital, was only open as far north as Bridge of Dun. (The A&FR; Company continued in existence, receiving and distributing the lease charge, until 1923.) The railways at FriockheimThere was a triangular junction with the A&FR; main line; the north apex was at Glasterlaw, with the south (Arbroath) apex at Friockheim; the west apex was at Guthrie. However the Guthrie fork was not properly connected and was not open at first. Friockheim station was not at the apex junction, but a little on the Guthrie side; Aberdeen to Forfar trains therefore passed the junction and reversed to the station to make the call, then continuing on their journey; this practice had been specifically prohibited by the Board of Trade.Ferguson, page 78; he does not say when the Guthrie arm of the triangle opened, but it seems to have been shortly after the main line opening. In fact the majority of the Aberdeen Railway traffic took the Guthrie curve and ran to Perth via Forfar and the SMJR. Much Dundee traffic travelled via Forfar and the Dundee and Newtyle Railway; until October 1849 this still had its own track gauge of 4 ft 6.5in (1,384 mm), so transshipment and change of train were necessary for a few years. =The SNER and after= The numerous small railway companies in the area would eventually combine. The Aberdeen Railway operated in a loose arrangement with the SMJR and the SCR, with a common pool of locomotives and rolling stock, but in 1856 that arrangement came to an end, when the Aberdeen Railway and the Scottish Midland Junction Railway merged to form the Scottish North Eastern Railway. For the time being the Scottish Central Railway went its own way. The A&FR; lease transferred to the SNER. The new company concentrated its traffic from Aberdeen to the south via Forfar, and the line into Arbroath fell into disuse. Its track was lifted in 1857. However animosity between the SNER and the SCR later resulted in traffic being diverted via Arbroath, requiring reinstatement of the Friockheim line; it was relaid as a single line, opening on 1 April 1863. The 1836 Act authorising the A&FR; had specified that the line to Arbroath docks should have gates at the several road level crossings in Arbroath; this had never been done and following several accidents, and the Commissioners of Police requested in May 1856 that the gates be provided. The SNER negotiated with them, and at length it was agreed that gates would be provided at Millgate Street only. Lengthy legalistic prevarication followed, legal opinion indicating among other things that the Act had required bridges, and therefore no-one had the right to demand gates at a level crossing. It appears the matter was eventually dropped. In 1865 and 1866 respectively the SCR and the SNER were further absorbed by the Caledonian Railway, forming a continuous line under single ownership from Carlisle to Aberdeen. The Caledonian control ended the reason for diverting trains away from the Forfar route, and the Friockheim curve was closed again, on 1 November 1867. Parliament was uncomfortable with the formation of large railway companies, and in granting the amalgamation Bill, it gave running powers over much of the northern part of the system to the North British Railway. The NBR pressed the point further, and obtained authorisation in 1871 to build a line from a junction at St Vigeans, a little north of Arbroath, to Kinnaber Junction via Montrose, giving it access to Aberdeen over the former Aberdeen Railway route. The construction of the Tay Bridge was proceeding in the 1870s, and the NBR applied for joint ownership (with the Caledonian Railway) of the Dundee and Arbroath line; and for running powers over the former A&FR; line from the joint Arbroath station to the junction at St Vigeans, and also to the docks at Arbroath over the A&FR; harbour line. Furthermore, as the NBR Montrose line would not be ready for some time, the NBR requested running powers over the Friockheim - Glasterlaw spur, which had twice been lifted and reinstated, and again lifted. The spur was ready on 26 July 1876. In 1870 the SNER opened its Dundee and Forfar direct line. This joined in to the A&FR; line east of Forfar, facing towards the station. Goods trains started running on 12 August 1870; approval for opening for passengers was refused at first because of signalling shortcomings, but passenger operation started on 14 November 1870. In 1879 the portion of the former A&FR; (now Caledonian) line between Arbroath and St Vigians Junction was transferred to the Dundee and Arbroath Joint company, in view of the NBR involvement on the line. On 28 December 1879 the Tay Bridge fell into the firth, and the NBR now ran goods trains via Perth and Dundee; passengers crossed the Firth by ferry to Broughty Ferry. The NBR opened its line from St Vigeans to Montrose for goods only at first on 1 March 1881. In 1902 the Friockheim viaduct (on the spur between Friockheim Junction and Glasterlaw) was in need of major reconstruction work; this was carried out over two years at considerable expense to the Caledonian: the major user was the NBR. Nonetheless traffic soon declined; Caledonian Railway trains between Dundee and Aberdeen were discontinued from 1 February 1908 and the spur line closed once again, this time finally.Ferguson, page 115; on page 161 he says January 1908. Between 1907 and 1912 the Arbroath station was reconstructed and modernised. =Grouping and nationalisation= At the end of 1922 it was intended that all the main line railways of Great Britain would be \\"grouped\\" in accordance with the Railways Act 1921. The Caledonian Railway was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with an intended vesting date of 1 January 1923. Technicalities prevented all the legal requirements being finalised by the due date, although for practical purposes the transfer took place. The Arbroath and Forfar Railway had not operated its line since 1848: it was only a financial company, and it argued that the grouping of managements of the railways need not affect it. This proposal was turned down, and the A&FR; shareholders received ¬£146 of LMS 4% stock for every ¬£100 of their own shareholding. In 1936 the line was singled between Guthrie Junction and Letham Mill,. The railways were nationalised in 1948; the LMS became part of British Railways. Following the end of World War II local railway usage declined substantially, and the line between St Vigeans Junction at Arbroath and Guthrie was closed. The former NBR service between Arbroath and Montrose continued, and stub lines to the quarries continued. On 4 September 1967 the through services between Perth and Forfar ceased, and the former NBR route was the sole main line to the north. The former A&FR; line closed at the same time. The only residue of the earlier network was the short section from Arbroath station to St Vigeans Junction, operated as part of the remaining Dundee - Arbroath - Montrose route. That remains in use at the present day. Locomotives At the beginning there were three locomotives, Victoria, Britannia and Caledonia, all six wheeled tender engines, with five- foot driving wheels and 3 ft 6in carrying wheels. They had outside cylinders and inside bearings. Carriages The carriages were of three types: \\"Mixed\\" with a central first-class compartment and second class at each end, \\"Second\\" class only and \\"Third\\" class only. The first class compartments were glazed, while the second class were provided with curtains. The third class were without roofs but had seats. Current operations Apart for the section between Arbroath (new) and St Vigean's Junction operated by Network Rail, with passenger services primarily operated by Abellio ScotRail as the Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line, the railway is closed.

It was launched on 11 September 1961 as a technical test programme. Today it is one of the four public TV channels in Austria. ORF 2 is available via DVB-T in Germany near the Austrian border and in parts of Munich. It is funded by a mixture of advertising breaks and a television licence fee; as such, unlike its German equivalents (which are generally available free-to-air), ORF 2 and its sister stations are encrypted over satellite.  History  ORF 2 started broadcasting three days a week as a \\"Technical Test Program\\" (Technisches Versuchsprogramm) on 11 September 1961. In 1967, the Versuchsprogramm was renamed as FS2 (Fernsehen 2 - Television 2), and its broadcasting days were increased to five days a week, which remained the case until 1 September 1970 when it began broadcasting daily. On 2 May 1988, regional news programmes known as Bundesland heute (The States Today) were introduced for each Austrian state. On 26 October 1992, FS2 was renamed as ORF 2. On 9 January 2012, a complete design change took place, similar to that of ORF eins a year prior. In line with the clear design of ORF eins, a vertical navigation bar was introduced as a central on-air element to join together programme credits, idents, promotions and commercial breaks. The red and white design is designed to underline the strong Austrian identity of the station.http://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/medien/418431_Human- touch-fuer-ORF2.html  Programming  In contrast to ORF 1, which focuses on TV series, movies and sports, ORF 2 broadcasts more Austrian-oriented and cultural programs. The most important news broadcast Zeit im Bild is broadcast several times a day, with the flagship bulletin being broadcast at 7:30pm each night. Bundesland heute (news for the federal states) is broadcast directly before this at 7:00pm; nine regional window programs are broadcast - one for each state. In the broadcasting area of Tyrol and in South Tyrol, which is part of Italy, S√ºdtirol heute is broadcast from Monday to Friday at 6:30 pm, which is produced by the ORF Landesstudio Tirol in Innsbruck. = Children= = Entertainment = *Eurovision Choir (2017) *Eurovision Young Musicians = Information = *Zeit im Bild = Series = *Gomorrah (Gomorrha - Die Serie) (2015-2016) *Prime Suspect (Hei√üer Verdacht) (2009, 2011) *Tatort (2006‚Äìpresent) = Sport = = Talk=  Reception  All nine regional feeds of ORF 2 can be received via satellite: these are all encrypted and can only be watched by viewers who have an ORF viewing card, which is available to anyone who pays the ORF licence fee. An international version of ORF 2, known as ORF 2 Europe, has been broadcast unencrypted over satellite in Europe since July 2004; certain programmes for which ORF does not have the rights to broadcast outside Austria are replaced with a video feed of ORF 2's teletext service, accompanied by the audio of √ñ1. Many of ORF 2's programmes, such as some Zeit im Bild bulletins, are also broadcast or repeated on 3sat. Since October 2006, ORF 2 has been broadcast terrestrially via DVB-T in Austria.

The 27-month contracts from the U.S. Army's Aviation and Missile Command is for a competitive risk-reduction phase. Each team submitted its proposal in the spring of 2011, with contract award expected in the first quarter of 2012. However, in September the Army and Navy requested the JAGM program be terminated. JAGM survived a budget reduction in 2012 with reduced funding.

George Richmond RA Origins Charles Paul Phipps was the eighth son of Thomas Henry Hele Phipps (1777‚Äì1841), of Leighton House, Westbury, Wiltshire, and Mary Michael Joseph Leckonby (1777‚Äì1835). The Phippses had originally emerged as prominent Wiltshire clothiers in the 16th century. Over the next hundred years prosperity propelled them into the ranks of the landed gentry but, by the early 19th century, they found themselves in rather reduced financial circumstances. Coffee merchant In 1830, at the age of 15, Phipps was sent to Rio de Janeiro with twenty pounds in his pocket to seek his fortune. In 1837 he went into partnership with his brother, John Lewis Phipps, buying out the Brazilian coffee business of Heyworth Brothers. Despite a number of alarms, the business eventually flourished, becoming for a while one of the largest coffee exporters from Brazil. Between 1850 and the mid-1870s, the volume of coffee exported by the firm increased from 94,000 to about half a million bags per annum (valued at ¬£2,000,000).Richard Graham, Britain and the Onset of Modernization in Brazil (Cambridge University Press, 1972), page 76 Political career In 1869, Phipps was elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Westbury, by 499 votes to 488 for the Liberal candidate, Abraham Laverton. He lost his seat to Laverton in 1874 by 22 votes. Phipps died on 8 June 1880, having suffered a stroke the previous year. Family In 1844, Phipps married Emma Mary Benson, who came from a mercantile family, being the daughter of Moses Benson of Liverpool and granddaughter of Moses Benson (1738‚Äì1806). Their eldest son, Charles Nicholas Paul Phipps, was also subsequently MP for Westbury and High Sheriff of Wiltshire. Their second son, William Wilton Phipps, was the grandfather of both Joyce Grenfell and Simon Wilton Phipps MC, the Bishop of Lincoln.

In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Union, serving after that in the Soviet Navy as T-336. Construction and commissioning Originally classified as a \\"coastal minesweeper,\\" AMc-128, Bombard was reclassified as a \\"minesweeper,\\" AM-151, on 21 February 1942. She was laid down on 7 December 1942 at Tampa, Florida, by the Tampa Shipbuilding Company, Inc., launched on 23 February 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Vivian Broadwater, and commissioned on 31 May 1944 with Lieutenant David M. Elder, USNR, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945= After shakedown training, Bombard transited the Panama Canal at the end of July 1944. From there, she voyaged directly to Samoa, departing the Panama Canal Zone on 1 August 1944 and arriving at Tutuila on 29 August 1944. On 2 September 1944, she left Tutuila and made stops at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, and San Francisco, California, before arriving in the waters of the Territory of Alaska at the end of the first week in November 1944. Minesweeping exercises, patrols, and convoy escort missions kept her busy until the summer of 1945 when, having been selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - she began familiarization training for her new Soviet crew at Cold Bay.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945-1963= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Bombard was decommissioned on 19 July 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-336 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Bombard to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-151 on 7 February 1955. Disposal The Soviet Navy struck T-336 from its vessel register in 1963. Unaware of her fate, the U.S. Navy kept Bombard on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her on 1 January 1983.

(ed.), Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Companionage, Kelly's Directories Ltd, Kingston-upon-Thames, 1968, p.942 Sir Manasseh Masseh Lopes, 1st Baronet (27 January 1755 ‚Äì 26 March 1831), of Maristow in the parish of Tamerton Foliot, Devon, was a British Member of Parliament and borough-monger. Parliamentary career Lopes was a member of a wealthy family of Portuguese Jews, and was born in Jamaica. His family were sugar planters and slave-owners in Jamaica before he came to the UK. In 1798 he had acquired Maristow House near Roborough in Devon, which became his family seat. He had a London house in Fitzroy Square. He had also for many years been investing part of his fortune in acquiring influence in a number of parliamentary boroughs. By the law as it stood at that period, no member of the Jewish religion could be elected to Parliament. (Many Christian denominations were similarly prohibited.) In 1802, Lopes converted to Christianity, and later the same year he entered Parliament as Tory member for New Romney. He subsequently also represented Evesham from 1807 and Barnstaple from 1812. In 1810, he bought control of the pocket borough of Westbury from Montagu Bertie, 5th Earl of Abingdon when the latter sold the manor of Westbury. Westbury was a burgage borough where the right to vote was attached to the ownership of certain properties; Lopes had bought all but two of these \\"burgage tenements\\", giving him the absolute power to name both of Westbury's MPs. (Unlike bribery, transactions of this sort were perfectly legal.) Between 1814 and 1819, he gave one of those seats to his nephew and heir, Ralph Franco. Meanwhile, Lopes was exerting his influence in various boroughs on behalf of the government, and in 1805 he was created a baronet, with a special remainder to his nephew Ralph Franco, son of his sister Esther. (Ralph, who inherited the baronetcy on his death, later changed his surname to Lopes). In 1810 he was appointed High Sheriff of Devon.The House of Commons 1790-1820 In 1819, Sir Manasseh was discovered to have bribed the voters in two separate constituencies at the previous year's general election. Such corruption was common, but reformers were looking for a cause celebre to give prominence to their campaign, and it seems likely that, as a foreign Jew, Lopes was seen as an ideal villain for the purpose. In his own Barnstaple constituency, he was alleged to have spent ¬£3000 on bribing the voters, and after investigation his election was declared void. Meanwhile, at Grampound in Cornwall, although no official protest had been entered against the election result, proceedings had been taken under the criminal law and Lopes was convicted, fined ¬£1000 and jailed for two years. As a result of the scandal, the already notoriously corrupt borough of Grampound was permanently deprived of its right to return MPs. Lopes' sentence was remitted in September 1820, and he put himself into Parliament at Westbury in a by-election in November. In 1829, the Duke of Wellington's Tory government decided to legislate for Catholic Emancipation, a policy which was heretical to their own Ultra-Tory supporters. The Home Secretary, Robert Peel, whose own Oxford University constituency was one of the greatest strongholds of opponents of Catholic Emancipation, felt compelled to resign and fight a by-election to receive a mandate for his change of policy, and was defeated. To allow Peel to return to the Commons in time to move the bill, Lopes vacated his own seat at Westbury and elected Peel in his place. This provoked considerable hostile comment, not least because the government had responded to the Anglican establishment voting against them by acquiring a seat from a Jewish-born borough owner. Lopes reportedly expected to be rewarded for providing his seat at so vital a moment with a peerage, but he was disappointed. Although Peel had no need of the seat after the general election which came the following year, Lopes did not stand again. Death Sir Manasseh died in 1831 aged 76.

Biography Born in McComb, Mississippi, Jones was principally a utility infielder and pinch-hitter. He played 262 games at second base, 186 at third base, 158 at 1st base, 18 in the outfield, and 1 at shortstop. In 907 major league games, he compiled a .235 batting average with 548 hits, 268 runs scored, 237 runs batted in, 91 doubles, 19 triples, 41 home runs, and 20 stolen bases. Jones was a highly recruited prospect while playing at Baton Rouge High School. To gain the edge in recruiting, the Red Sox involved Jones' boyhood hero, Ted Williams, in the effort, and Jones ended up signing with Boston. He played for Boston from 1964 to 1969. He had his best season in 1967, the Red Sox \\"Impossible Dream\\" season. Dalton led the American League with 13 pinch hits and had a career- high .289 batting average. He also had several key hits for the Red Sox during the pennant drive. On September 18, 1967, he hit a 10th-inning home run in Detroit to beat the Tigers. In the last two games of the season, Jones went 3-for-5 and scored the game-winning run in the final regular season game. Jones also gave a tremendous performance in the 1967 World Series. He was Boston's starting third baseman in Games 1‚Äì4 and served as a pinch hitter in two other games. He was 7-for-18 with a .389 batting average and .421 on-base percentage in the World Series‚Äîsecond only to Carl Yastrzemski (who hit .400 for the Series) among the Red Sox. Jones (second from left) and other Red Sox personnel with Mayor of Boston John F. Collins (at right) in October 1967 Jones was traded to the Detroit Tigers before the 1970 season. He played two seasons with the Tigers. On July 9, 1970, Jones hit a towering fly ball into the right field upper deck in Detroit with the bases loaded. What should have been a grand slam ended up being a three-RBI single, as Jones passed teammate Don Wert between first and second base. Jones was called out but the three baserunners scored. Interviewed in July 2006, Jones blamed Wert for the embarrassing incident that Jones is now best remembered for. The ball was a towering fly ball, which may or may not have had the distance to make it into the right field overhang at old Tiger Stadium. Jones felt that Wert should have been halfway to second base, prepared to advance if it was a home run, and prepared to return to first if it was caught. Instead, Jones recalled that Wert was returning to first to tag up. Jones says he was already at first when the ball landed in the upper deck, and he passed Wert just 1 or 2 steps past first base. Jones' major league career ended in 1972 with the Texas Rangers managed by his boyhood hero, Ted Williams, who had helped scout and sign Jones for the Red Sox when Jones was a high school senior. In 1973, Jones played with the Peninsula Whips, the Triple-A team in the Montreal Expos organization. After that effort, Jones realized he would not be making a comeback and retired from baseball. After his playing career ended, Jones worked for a time at a bank and spent five years working for Exxon.

Daniel was a son of George Roger Dean, who fought in the Colonial line, and Mary Campbell who was reared with her sister by the Duke of Argyl at Inveraray Scotland, the clan Campbells' ancestral home. The National Register and an Ohio Historic Inventory, dated 11 October 1974, list the historic site at 199 N. Ballard Road, Xenia, as having five buildings dating from the 1820s on along Caesar's Creek in Greene County, Ohio. The National Register listing was expanded by a boundary increase adding 199 Ballard in 1994, and renaming as the Dean Family Farm Historic District. Daniel Dean, born October 20, 1766 in Ireland was a son of George Roger Dean, whom DAR archival records list as a Pennsylvania sergeant and militiaman in the 1770s, along with his elder brothers James and David Dean. A weaver by trade, Daniel Dean lived briefly in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia before meeting and marrying Jannet \\"Jenny\\" Steele (1768-November 18, 1841), a Scots-Irish girl of Steele's Tavern in Augusta County, Virginia. The couple relocated near Mount Sterling, Kentucky, where Dean built a mill, a house for the couple and another for his sister and mother, both named Mary, whom he brought from Ireland to Kentucky via Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1790. Daniel and Jannet had the first of their 11 children while in Kentucky. But when Ohio became a free state in 1803, Dean, an ardent abolitionist, scouted out the new lands north of the Ohio River with his brother-in-law, Henry Barnes, a skilled builder whose son later would become Greene County's wartime sheriff and treasurer. Dean, shortly thereafter, bought on Caesar's Creek near the settlement of Xenia, but he spent several years litigating to perfect his title. Once his title was secure, Dean joined Barnes and their families in relocating via Fort Washington (later Cincinnati) to Greene County in September 1812. They first dined using as a table a huge, flat rock‚Äîthen began a lucrative business in which Dean harvested and milled timber for lumber used by Barnes to build homes in and near Xenia, Ohio. Dean's son, Joseph (1804‚Äì83), wed Hannah Boggs (1809‚Äì88)and, according to Dean Family records, Joseph built the first substantial two-story home on the family farm in 1823, a house that still stands. Daniel Dean, descended from Covenanter Presbyterians, was a church stalwart. At least 36 of his 111 progeny enlisted and served honorably in the Union Army during the Civil War, according to records read at an 1880 Dean family picnic. The elder Dean, who died January 24, 1843, at age 77, is buried alongside his wife, Jannet, in the Dean Family Cemetery in New Jasper Township. The cemetery and farm, privately owned, were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The historic Ballard Road Covered Bridge stands just off Route 35 nearby and spans a fork of Caesar's Creek. Greene County (Ohio) Public Library archives feature maps, from 1855, 1874 and 1896, depicting the original Dean Family Farm acreage divided among Daniel's heirs ‚Äî Joseph, William, John, Levi, D. S. Dean and others. Lands lie along the Jamestown Turnpike, now U.S. Route 35.

He was appointed by the colony's proprietor Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore. Joseph attempted to maintain control of the colony in the proprietor's name, but religious turmoil related to the Glorious Revolution in England led to Joseph's being removed from office by Protestant colonists and the Calvert family losing control of the colony. Term as Governor The Catholic Calvert family established Maryland as a place where English Catholics, who were a religious minority, could find religious tolerance. However, many of the colonists who arrived in Maryland were Protestant. In 1681, Protestant colonists, especially members of the Anglican Church, began a series of local rebellions against proprietary control by Calvert. Calvert appointed Joseph in the hope that he would be able to stop these rebellions. It is not clear whether Joseph was actually appointed Governor or the head of the colony's Council of Deputy Governors. Legally, the Governor of the colony from 1684 was Calvert's young son, Benedict Leonard Calvert. However, executive power in the colony was for all practical purposes led by the Council, which included a number of prominent colonists. Despite this, the State of Maryland includes Joseph on their list of proprietary Governors. =Protestant Revolution of 1689= By the time Joseph arrived in Maryland, religious conflict in England had reached a peak during the events of the Glorious Revolution, in which the Catholic King James II was overthrown and replaced with the Protestant William of Orange. It would take time for this news to arrive in the colony. Joseph, an Irishman and like Calvert a Catholic, was a strong supporter of the King. Soon after his arrival, he asked the Assembly to create a holiday on the date of the birth of James II's heir. He also implemented a number of unpopular reforms at the request of the proprietor. Export of tobacco was limited to high-quality cask tobacco more easily produced by large landholders. In addition, Calvert had ordered that all future tax payments were to be made in specie rather than in tobacco. When news reached the colony that the King had been deposed, Joseph attempted to maintain control by asking planters to turn in their weapons and temporarily cancelling the meeting of the colonial assembly scheduled for April. Protestant settlers began gathering in armed groups, partially fueled by rumors that the Catholics would ally with Native Americans to drive Protestants out of the colony. Joseph attempted one final time to convince the colonial assembly to support the deposed King, but Protestant colonists seized control of the colony in July. Col. Henry Darnall, Deputy Governor of Maryland and a Roman Catholic. In 1689, Maryland Puritans, by now a substantial majority in the colony, revolted against the proprietary government, in part because of the apparent preferment of Catholics like Joseph and Deputy Governor Colonel Henry Darnall to official positions of power. Led by Colonel John Coode, an army of 700 Puritans defeated a proprietorial army led by Colonel Darnall.Roark, Elisabeth Louise, p.78, Artists of colonial America Retrieved February 22, 2010 Darnall later wrote: \\"Wee being in this condition and no hope left of quieting the people thus enraged, to prevent effusion of blood, capitulated and surrendered.\\" The victorious Coode and his Puritans set up a new government that outlawed Catholicism, and Darnall was deprived of all his official positions. =Flight from Maryland= Joseph and other prominent Catholics fled the colony, possibly taking some of the colony's arms and ammunition stores with them. Joseph was replaced with John Coode, a leader of a group known as the Protestant Associators, who had been a primary instigator of the rebellion. Although John Coode and his followers later claimed that the rebellion had been a peaceful one, they were accused, among other crimes, of plundering the estates of those who supported the proprietary regime and embezzling the colony's revenue. Coode and his followers claimed that in addition to the religious concerns that underlay the rebellion, the previous regime had not adequately provided for the poor in the colony and had instead burdened them with high taxation. In addition to replacing Joseph, the new colonial leaders were eventually successful in having proprietary control removed from the Calvert family and in barring Catholics from voting, bearing arms, or serving on juries. In 1704 an Act was passed \\"to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province\\", preventing Catholics from holding political office. Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the American Revolution.

Journalists and record companies began using the term in the mid-1950s to describe a new current within jazz which incorporated influences from rhythm and blues, gospel music, and blues, especially in saxophone and piano playing. David H. Rosenthal contends in his book Hard Bop that the genre is, to a large degree, the natural creation of a generation of African-American musicians who grew up at a time when bop and rhythm and blues were the dominant forms of black American music. Prominent hard bop musicians included Horace Silver, Charles Mingus, Art Blakey, Cannonball Adderley, Miles Davis and Tadd Dameron. Hard bop is sometimes referred to as \\"funky hard bop.\\" The \\"funky\\" label refers to the rollicking, rhythmic feeling associated with the style. The descriptor is also used to describe soul jazz, which is commonly associated with hard bop.

The building was adjacent to the CCTV Headquarters and owned by China Central Television, was scheduled for completion in May 2009. The TVCC has been rebuilt and was opened in 2012. At 8:27 p.m. on 9 February 2009, on the last day of the festivities marking Chinese New Year, the entire building caught fire due to a nearby unsanctioned fireworks display; it was put out six hours later.Andrew Jacobs, Fire Ravages Renowned Building in Beijing, The New York Times, 9 February 2009 The incident, and its coverage by Chinese state media, caused a furor in China. CCTV officials had carried out powerful pyrotechnics without the required permit from local government, and ignored repeated police warnings not to hold them.

Xinhua reported, and the municipal public security bureau confirmed, that Beijing police detained an official of CCTV. Xu Wei (ÂæêÂ®Å), in charge of the CCTV construction site, was taken to a police station in eastern Beijing's central business district, suspected of being the organiser of the fireworks display.

CCTV later apologized to the public for the inconvenience, mainly traffic re-direction, they caused. The Fire Brigade said that the fire began on the building's roof and spread to the lower floors, fed by high winds. Toxic fumes and a lack of working sprinklers were said to have hampered efforts to extinguish the fire.Andrew Jacobs, China TV Network Apologizes for Fire, The New York Times, 10 February 2009 An amateur video that was uploaded on the Internet showed the fire starting after a shell from the fireworks landed on the roof of the uncompleted construction. One CNN report noted that \\"the top of the building was exploding\\". Another observed that the fire spread quickly and that the tower was completely engulfed in flames within less than 13 minutes. \\"It was obvious that there was a lot of debris on site, [which] ignited very quickly\\". =Investigation= No detailed damage estimate was released.

According to Caijing, the actual cost of the fireworks display was CNY350,000; however, CCTV was billed 1 million for it by a legal entity controlled by Xu Wei, the construction manager.

The leaked memo read: \\"No photos, no video clips, no in-depth reports,\\" and further, \\"The news should be put on news areas only and the comments posting areas should be closed\\".

A large number of commentaries and spoofs (often using the trendy image of Grass Mud Horse) also reflect netizens' common critical view of CCTV as a powerful and monopoly state-run propaganda machine. Some of the sharper and more critical posts were quickly being deleted by the authorities, but many humorous images and cartoons are being widely distributed. Jeremy Goldkorn of the Los Angeles Times, who was the editor of a website that tracks Chinese media, said, \\"[A]mong China's young, educated and urban, the stodgy network (CCTV) has long been a subject of ridicule, both for its low production values and its propagandistic news coverage....But the fire‚Äîwhich engulfed what was to be the Mandarin Oriental hotel, a dramatic, angular tower that stands next to the now-iconic CCTV building‚Äîprovided a new touchstone for critics, prompting the government to move quickly to mute the outrage.\\" =Internet users in China= Despite the lack of images on the state media, photographs and videotapes of the fire, taken with cameras and cellphones, swiftly found their way to blogs and forums including major portals such as Sina, Sohu, and Youku. Media reported that Chinese citizens on the internet were taking sarcastic and comical pot-shots at CCTV. It noted there was \\"a storm\\" of criticism that the state broadcaster which created one of the year's biggest news stories failed to report the event promptly, or honestly. Parodies of the incident were also rampant, including edited images often relating to other Chinese internet memes, such as the Grass Mud Horse. = Rebuilding = The Beijing Television Cultural Center as seen in July 2011. Construction has resumed after the fire. The initial images of the blaze suggested that the tower might be nearly destroyed. However Rem Koolhaas said that \\"they are simply rebuilding it as it was, because there was no structural damage.\\" The complex's main building, the doughnut-shaped structure, was not damaged. The building, which was originally scheduled to open in 2009, did not see any progress towards opening or being visibly repaired by the end of that year. It is currently being repaired,https://www.flickr.com/photos/photo- architect/5027050433/, Flickr, 10 September 2010 and is still slated to open. Mandarin Oriental Beijing was only postponed due to the fire at CCTV's new site. At present, the specific opening time has not yet been known. It is reported that another Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Wangfujing will open first. In addition, the demolition work of Xinyuan Building No. 3 on the north side of the hotel has not been completed (11 years have passed), so the opening hours of CCTV's Mandarin Oriental Hotel will continue to be postponed. The No. 3 Building of Hujialou Xinyuan has also been transformed into a residential building in the core area of the CBD. This has caused great pain and inconvenience to the residents. Since CCTV is still in accordance with the 2001 compensation standard, compared with the rapid development of housing prices today, the gap is huge, so there are still nearly 100 residents in the building. Since the fire in 2009, CCTV has replaced five directors before and after, but it has no question about the demolition of the unfinished residential building.

He was the first official royal governor appointed by the British crown after the colony was removed from the proprietary control of the Calvert family during the Glorious Revolution. Copley engaged in a series of political struggles with the colonial assembly and the colonial secretary, Thomas Lawrence, in the year between his arrival and his death the next year. Term as Governor Copley arrived in the Maryland colony following a Protestant rebellion that had overthrown the proprietorship of the Catholic Calvert family. The Protestants, who were the majority in the colony, had ejected their leaders after a brief conflict, echoing the Glorious Revolution that had occurred in England in 1688. From the overthrow of the proprietary government in 1689 until the arrival of Copley in 1692, Maryland had been governed by leaders of the rebellion, who called themselves the Protestant Associators. Their rule was somewhat catholic; the only courts that met at the time were the county courts and the associators used their executive power to punish their enemies. Copley's arrival in the colony in 1692 heralded the return of British control to the colony, though the leaders of the rebellion took care to find ways to cement their power in the elected lower house of colonial government, the assembly. Having felt that their rights were abused by a strong executive power prior to the rebellion, they sought ways to prevent a similar situation under royal control. They appointed their own clerk, a man named John Lewellin, and created a number of standing committees designed to ensure the continuity and power of the assembly. Among these were a committee on elections, which would establish that the legislature itself would have control of how its members were elected. In addition, a committee on aggrievances handled complaints from the citizenry, a committee of laws was responsible for overhauling the legal code of the colony, and a committee on accounts oversaw economic and financial legislation. Dealing with the assembly was not the only challenge Copley faced. There were significant salaries to be derived from colonial offices, and at the same time Copley himself was appointed Governor, Thomas Lawrence was appointed Secretary of the colony, a position from which he might derive great wealth. Lawrence and Copley had argued even before their arrival in the colony, and Lawrence sailed on a later ship because of this argument. Before he arrived in September 1692, two other men had been doing the work of the Secretary and taking the proceeds that accrued with the work. As Lawrence was attempting to recoup that money, Copley made a deal with the assembly to further weaken his opponent and to increase his own coffers. The assemblymen were interested in determining exactly which government officials received how much money, in order to prevent the sort of nepotism that had occurred in the proprietary government. Copley agreed to sign legislation to that effect. Authorized by that legislation, the assembly took some of the fees that had accrued to the Secretary and allowed the Governor to receive them instead. Copley, in turn, took other fees from the Secretary's office and gave them to Nehemiah Blakiston, one of the leaders of the Protestant Associators who now sat on the Governor's council, the upper house of the legislature. Lawrence became a rallying point for Marylanders who opposed Copley's rule and that of the Governor's council. They supporting him as he continued the power struggle in a fight over the appointments of county clerks. Meanwhile, the legislature and Governor continued the work of rebuilding colonial government following the rebellion. They rewrote the legal code of the colony, adopting many laws that had existed previously and passing new ones to address some of their grievances with the proprietary government and strengthen the institution of slavery. They also established the Church of England as the state religion of the colony, and passed laws restricting the practice of other religions. In the midst of these efforts, Copley, like many recent arrivals to the colony, suddenly took sick and died. His enemy Thomas Lawrence took over, one of a series of people who would briefly serve at the helm of the colony before the arrival of the new royally-appointed governor, Francis Nicholson.

Nine armed Moluccans pulled the emergency brake around 09:00 and took about 50 people hostage. The hijacking lasted for 20 days and ended with a raid by the Dutch anti-terrorist special forces, during which two hostages and six hijackers were killed. At the same time, four other South-Moluccans took hostages at an elementary school in Bovensmilde, around 20 km (12 mi) away. This was the second train hijacking in the Netherlands and, like the train hijacking in 1975 in Wijster, was perpetrated by Moluccans. Background After fighting for the Dutch in the Dutch East Indies, the South Moluccans were forcibly exiled to the Netherlands, with the Dutch government promising that they would eventually get their own independent state, Republic of South Maluku. After about 25 years of living in temporary camps, often in poor conditions, the South Moluccans felt that the Dutch government had failed to fulfil its promise. It was then that some members of the South Moluccans' younger generation started a series of radical action to bring attention to their cause. See Republik Maluku Selatan for more information about the RMS case. Developments At the same time four other South-Moluccans started taking hostages at a primary school in the village of Bovensmilde; they took 105 children and five teachers hostage. With these combined actions the hijackers wanted to force the (recently resigned) Dutch government to keep their promises about their RMS, break diplomatic ties with the Indonesian government and release 21 Moluccan prisoners involved in the hostage actions in 1975. An ultimatum was set for 25 May at 14:00 with the hijackers threatening to blow up the train and the school. The hostages were forced to help blinding all the windows so for a long period nobody knew about what happened inside the train; it was only near the end of the hostage taking that electronic eavesdropping devices were installed by marines. About 2000 marines and soldiers were stationed both at the train and the school. For the date of 25 May, the elections for the Dutch parliament were planned. The leaders of the different parties agreed to cancel their election campaigns but the elections itself would take place on the planned date. After the ultimatum expired, the hijackers announced new demands; They wanted an airplane from the airport of Schiphol and to fly out with the 21 to be freed prisoners, the five teachers, and all hijackers. By means of electronic eavesdropping, minister of Justice Van Agt (under resignation) knew that the hostages were not in danger, so the government let this second ultimatum pass as well. * 09:00 23 May: Start of the hijack * 24.May: The national broadcaster NOS reads the letter with the demands * 25 May: Elections for national parliament, ultimatum expires without anything happening * 26 May: A handcuffed hostage is taken outside the train and then taken aboard again * 28 May: Hostages clean up the train, 60 activists offer themselves as alternative hostages * 29 May: Negotiations about releasing a pregnant woman are cut off * 30 May: Second week of crisis * 31 May: For the first time the hijackers ask for a negotiator * 1 June: The hijackers ask for an ambulance but later retract the request * 4 June: Two negotiators talk for hours with the hijackers * 5 June: Two pregnant women, including Annie Brouwer (later mayor of Utrecht), are allowed to leave the train * 8 June: An ill passenger is released * 9 June: Two negotiators talk again to the hijackers for hours * 05:00 June 11: In the morning the crisis is ended after 482 hours Negotiators Day 18: negotiators arrive at the train J.A. Manusama, then president of the RMS, and Rev. Metiarij acted as negotiators during the crisis. Because of some disease in the school (probably caused by the food distributed in the school), the hijackers decided to release the children, but keep the teachers. According to medical doctor Frans Tutuhatunewa (later successor as RMS president), there was no health issue with the hostages in the train. Nevertheless, the health conditions of these hostages were used as an argument for the later attack on the train. The attack On 11 June 1977 at 05:00, almost three weeks after the start of the hijacking, six F-104 jet fighters of the Royal Netherlands Air Force overflew the train at low altitude, with the purpose of disorienting the hijackers and also make the hostages duck down to the floor of the train where they would be relatively safe. One of the pilots was Dick Berlijn, who later became Chief of the Netherlands Defence Staff. Then marines of the special anti-terrorist unit Bijzondere Bijstands Eenheid (BBE) started shooting at the train; an estimated 15,000 bullets were shot at the train. The marines aimed at the first class and in-between compartments with the doors because they knew these were the areas where the hijackers were hiding. One of the hostages killed was in such a compartment because she had been allowed there by the hijackers. Six hijackers were killed. Aftermath Freed hostages leave the train Three hijackers survived and were later convicted to sentences from six to nine years. In 2007 there was a memorial service for the killed hijackers;Article in NRC newspaper Two of the hijackers, motivated by a conversion to Christianity, had a meeting with former victims in 2007.Description of TV- program of the EO(public evangelical broadcaster) According to official sources, six of the hijackers were killed by the crossfire of bullets shot at the train. However many Moluccans believe that they were killed deliberately. On 1 June 2013 it was reported that an investigation by journalist Jan Beckers and one of the former hijackers, Junus Ririmasse, had concluded that three and possibly four of the hijackers were still alive when the train was stormed and executed by marines. In November 2014, it was revealed that Dries van Agt, Justice Minister at the time, allegedly ordered that none of the hijackers were to leave the train alive. An in-depth investigation, of which the results were published in November 2014, concluded however that no execution has taken place, but there were unarmed hijackers killed by marines.

The band released their debut album titled ... And Justice for Y'all in 2001 and released their second album Sixteen Tons in 2003, both albums were released via their first record label Berserker Records. = 2004-2011: God Luck and Good Speed, Jason...

In 2009 a deluxe double LP version on the album was also released. The band was also announced as a support act for the American heavy metal supergroup Down. The band was later announced as one of the acts to play at 2010's Hellfest among the likes of Arch Enemy, Architects and Gwar. The band entered the studio for their fourth album with producer Steve Albini in early January 2010 who also produced their last album God Luck and Good Speed, and also Arik Roper will be designing the album cover as he did for the band's previous albums. Not long after they entered the studio, Dave \\"Dixie\\" Collins accidentally shot himself in the foot, blasting off one of his big toes, whilst he was cleaning his favorite shotgun and was reported to be bedridden for the next few weeks during his recovery. This ultimately led to the band postponing their recording session with Steve Albini until after their tour in March and April. Despite the setback caused by the accident, the band announced that their next album will be titled Jason...The Dragon and was set for a release later that year, they also announced that their March/April tour will now be called the \\"Nine Toe\\" tour in reference to Collins losing his big toe in the accident. The band headlined again in September 2010 after a few other injuries to the band members were reported, in which Keko had torn his meniscus after returning from their previous headlining tour and Dave Shepherd had also broken his pinkie finger while supporting Black Cobra in Europe in July, however, did not prevent the group from returning to Albini to record the album, unlike the previous two accidents. The album was finally released on March 15, 2011 after all the setbacks caused by the band's injuries throughout 2010. The band went on tour in the US to support the release of the album however had to cancel the last few shows due to Dave Shepherd breaking his hand which disallowed him to play guitar. = 2011-present: Record deal, new drummers, and Goliathan = In November 2013 it was announced by French record label Season of Mist had officially listed Weedeater as part of their roster, and the label re-released all of the band's previous albums digitally in December.

The court of delegates chose him to serve, as their colonial agent, in London in appreciation for his services, in Monserrat. Later, from 1706 onwards, Blakiston was agent, for the Virginia Colony, in London. Then, in 1715, he was returned as the member of parliament for Mitchell. He was a loyal Whig who consistently voted with the administration during this period. Death Nathaniel Blakiston died at the end of February 1722.

The path runs for from the Steamship Authority ferry terminal in Woods Hole to North Falmouth.  History  The trail was built on the right-of-way of the Old Colony Railroad's Woods Hole branch line, which was built in 1872. In 1893, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NH) leased the Old Colony and took over service on the line. Passenger service was discontinued in 1964, the NH merged with the Penn Central system in 1969, and Penn Central went bankrupt in 1970. The creation of the trail began in 1977, when the Town of Falmouth purchased the section of the bankrupt line running from downtown Falmouth to Woods Hole for $329,000. In 2009, the trail was extended an additional from downtown Falmouth to North Falmouth. Freight service on this section ceased in 1989. While the Woods Hole-Falmouth section of former railroad is owned by the Town of Falmouth, the Falmouth-North Falmouth section is owned by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and is not officially abandoned. The name of the trail is a reference to the patriotic song \\"America the Beautiful\\". The author of the song's lyrics, Katherine Lee Bates, was born in Falmouth, and there is a plaque commemorating her poem near mile marker 2. The Bourne Rail Trail is a planned rail trail paralleling the active rail line from North Falmouth to Bourne, where it will connect with the Cape Cod Canal path. In 2019 and 2020, the state awarded $385,000 for design of the first two phases. Route description The Shining Sea Bikeway's northern trailhead is at the former site of the North Falmouth Railroad Station on County Road in North Falmouth. For the first , the path runs adjacent to active track used to haul trash off- Cape from the Upper Cape Regional Transfer Station on Joint Base Cape Cod. The path runs south roughly parallel to Route 28A through the villages of North Falmouth and West Falmouth. Between North and West Falmouth, it passes through a cranberry bog and crosses the horse trails at Bourne Farm. In West Falmouth, it passes near Chapoquoit Beach and then runs through the Sippewissett Salt Marsh. After the salt marsh, the path turns southeast and climbs slightly into the village of Sippewissett and then turns southwest and enters downtown Falmouth. At this point, there is a connection across Route 28A to the southern end of the Moraine Trail, including Goodwill Park, Grew's Pond, and Falmouth Pumping Station https://www.savebuzzardsbay.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/05/map_shining-sea-bikeway.pdf. In Falmouth, the path runs through a Steamship Authority parking lot and passes the former Falmouth Railroad Station, which is used as a bus station. At Woods Hole Road, the path reaches its downtown parking lot, which was its northernmost trailhead until the 2009 extension. It then crosses Woods Hole Road and continues southwest past Salt Pond to Surf Drive Beach. At Surf Drive, the path follows the beach for and then heads inland. Turning east, it passes through another Steamship Authority parking lot and ends at the Steamship Authority ferry terminal and the former site of the Woods Hole Railroad Station in the village of Woods Hole.

Taxonomy The phylogenetic position of Lamontichthys remains uncertain. It has been considered to be sister to Harttia, whereas Lamontichthys shows much more similarities with Pterosturisoma microps of the monotypic genus Pterosturisoma, which only differs from Lamontichthys by the number of pectoral fin rays. Species There are currently six recognized species in this genus: * Lamontichthys avacanoeiro de Carvalho Paix√£o & Toledo-Piza, 2009 * Lamontichthys filamentosus (La Monte, 1935) * Lamontichthys llanero Taphorn & Lilyestrom, 1984 * Lamontichthys maracaibero Taphorn & Lilyestrom, 1984 * Lamontichthys parakana de Carvalho Paix√£o & Toledo-Piza, 2009 * Lamontichthys stibaros Isbr√ºcker & Nijssen, 1978 Distribution and habitat Lamontichthys is distributed in the northwestern part of South America in the upper Amazon and Orinoco River drainages, and in the Lake Maracaibo region. Species in this genus occupy the same ecological niche as those of Harttia. They mainly live in the mainstream of rivers, on rocky and sandy bottoms. Description Sexual dimorphism in Lamontichthys includes hypertrophied odontodes on the pectoral spines in mature males. In all species of Lamontichthys, there is one pectoral fin spine and seven pectoral fin rays on each fin, as opposed to the rest of Loricariinae species which have one pectoral fin spine and only six pectoral fin rays. Ecology Lamontichthys is an open brooder; eggs are laid on an open surface such as rocks, submerged wood or plants, and are generally exposed to the current. Females lay a few large-sized (1.4-1.8 millimetres or .056-.071 in in diameter) yellowish eggs during each spawning event.

Its shape is categorized as being flexuous filamentous, with lengths of 275 and 550 nanometers. The virus has a limited host range, and barley appears to be the only known susceptible host.Ed. M.J. Adams. (1975). Barley Yellow Mosaic Virus. Descriptions of Plant Viruses. Web. http://www.dpvweb.net/dpv/showdpv.php?dpvno=143 The virus is transmitted via Polymyxa graminis, which is a plasmodiophorid protist, through the resting spores that survive in the soil, and eventually zoospores.You, Y. and Shirako, Y. (2013), Evaluation of host resistance to Barley yellow mosaic virus infection at the cellular and whole-plant levels. Plant Pathology, 62: 226‚Äì232. Eastern Asia is the most affected region, but the virus can be found worldwide. Current agricultural practices have been ineffective at eliminating the virus, but breeding resistance appears to be the only way to help reduce the disease.Iida, Y., Ban, T., and Konishi, T. (DATE). Linkage analysis of the rym6 resistance gene to Japanese strain II of barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV-II) in barley. Barley Genetics Newsletter, 29: 31-33. Symptoms of barley yellow mosaic virus on barley cultivar Igri. Hosts and Symptoms Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is the only current known host for the virus. Other species of Hordeum have been experimentally innocultated and exhibited similar symptoms, but this has since been categorized as a different strain of disease called barley mild mosaic virus. When dealing with viruses, it is important to understand that symptoms are not reliable in diagnosing the specific virus. That being said, the signature symptom exhibited by the barley from the virus is a yellowing and mosaic flecking of the youngest leaves that often appears in the winter or early spring.Brunt, A.A., Crabtree, K., Dallwitz, M.J., Gibbs, A.J., Watson, L. and Zurcher, E.J. (eds.) (1996). Plant Viruses Online: Descriptions and Lists from the VIDE Database. Version: 20 August 1996.' URL Early on the plant leaves begin to show a pale green color, and over time the changes become more drastic with severe yellowing and mosaic patterns. In addition, leaf curl, stunting, and necrosis can all be observed.You, Y., and Shirako, Y. (2012). Influence of amino acid position 132 in VPg on replication and systemic infection of barley yellow mosaic virus. Virus Research, 166: 121-124 The symptoms are categorized as systemic, due to the spread of the disease throughout the plant. Once the virus enters the plant through the root cells via Polymyxa graminis it is able to multiply and spread throughout the plant. The symptoms arise due to the virus's ability to hack into the plant cells' machinery, which disrupts the normal cycle of the plant. Disease Cycle This picture shows resting spores of Polymyxa graminis, the vector of Barley Yellow Mosaic Virus. Barley Yellow Mosaic Virus (BaYMV) is a virus, and therefore doesn't divide, produce energy, or have any reproductive structures. The only way BaYMV is able to multiply is by \\"taking over\\" host cells and manufacturing more viruses. It is spread through the protist Polymyxa graminis, so its disease cycle largely depends on that of P. graminis. P. graminis is a soil-borne pathogen, so it is spread by tools, water, animals, and other means of physically moving soil. BaYMV overwinters in the resting spores of P. graminis, and can survive decades in this state. When P. graminis invades the roots of a plant and begins growing in the root cells, the BaYMV is transmitted from protist to barley through zoospores.Mosaics. HGCA Cereal Disease Encyclopedia. Web. http://www.hgca.com/minisite_manager.output/3673/3673/Cereal%20Disease%20Encyclopedia/Diseases/Mosaics.mspx?minisiteId=26 It then can enter barley plant cells and use the cell machinery to make more virus, thus infecting the plant. The virus does this by using its coat protein to gain access into plant cells, and then taking over cell machinery in the nucleus. It uses the cell machinery to manufacture more virus, and can rapidly reproduce this way. Once a plant is infected, there is no known way to \\"cure\\" the plant, so the plant stays infected indefinitely. The virus remains in the resting spores in the soil, and in this way it can infect other plants, overwinter, or be spread via cultivation or harvest (spreading the soil). BaYMV is known as a systemic plant pathogenic virus, which means it is transmitted throughout the plant via the plant's natural pathways. Once the virus has taken over the cell's machinery and begins copying the virus, it is then able move from cell to cell via movement proteins, which are produced by the virus.Carrington, J., Kasschau, K., Mahajan, S., and Schaad, M. (1996). Cell to cell and long-distance transport of viruses in plants. American Society of Plant Physiologists, 8: 1669-1681. The virus continues to travel until it eventually gets into the vascular system, from which it can travel throughout the plant and continue to infect new plant cells. Environment BaYMV is found mainly in Eastern Asia and Western Europe. Common countries to find the virus include Japan, China, Ukraine, Greece, Germany, English, Belgium, and France. It has also recently been discovered in Poland.M. Je≈ºewska* and K. Trzmiel (2009). First report of barley yellow mosaic virus infecting barley in Poland. New Disease Reports. Web. http://www.ndrs.org.uk/article.php?id=019032 The conditions which favor the virus are cold winters and mild, wet autumns. This is because factors which are conducive to virus infection are conditions that favor Polymyxa graminis, the organism that transmits the virus. Polymyxa graminis is a protist and thus thrives in wet conditions, so this would favor BaYMV activity.Polymyxa Graminis. Plantwise Knowledge Bank. Web. http://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/Datasheet.aspx?dsid=42776 If conditions are dry, infection may occur in lower and wetter regions of a field because the wet conditions will allow the zoospores of P. graminis to swim with ease.Cadle-Davidson, L. and S. M. Gray. 2006. Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus. The Plant Health Instructor. DOI: 10.1094/PHI-I-2006-0424-01 Management Patches of barley yellow mosaic virus in field of barley, cultivar Panda, growing at Hemel Hempstead, UK. Once a plant is infected with BaYMV, it is infected for the plant's lifetime. When the virus is in the soil, it remains there in the resting spores for years. It can also infect barley roots in autumn, remain there for the winter, and then infect the upper part of the plant in spring through the phloem. We currently do not know of a way to cure a plant with this disease. For this reason, prevention is key when trying to control this disease. Chemical controls, crop rotation, and soil sanitation have all proven rather ineffective at combatting the virus. Resistance is the main way of controlling BaYMV at this time. Researchers have discovered 15 recessive and 3 dominant genes that are resistant to the virus, but none of them are completely resistant. Furthermore, new virulent strains of the virus are constantly emerging. Even when a certain gene provides resistant to one strain, there are oftentimes other strains that it is susceptible to. To further complicate matters, the mechanism of resistance is still unknown. However, since resistance yields the best results at this point, this is the primary measure of control. Resistant cultivars are sold across Europe and have been used with mild success. A study performed in Japan yielded positive results for resistance to BaYMV when using Kashimamugi, Haruna Nijo, and Haganemugi, which are all barley cultivars. These cultivars yielded no symptoms after inoculation, and it appears specific genes are responsible for resistance. Importance The main problem with the BaYMV, or any cereal virus for that matter, is that it is an important cash crop for a number of different uses. Some examples include animal feed, beer and alcohol production, and a number of other essential items. This valuable resource has suffered tremendous losses due to the barley yellow mosaic virus. Numbers have reached upwards of 50% yield loss in the United Kingdom at times, and up to 80% yield loss in Japan. This would equate to losing 255 million dollars in one year in the UK, and even more in Japan if barley yields remain steady.\\"Barley Farming in the UK.\\" UK Agriculture. N.p., n.d.

His work involving defective Chrysler minivan lift gate latches resulted in a $262.5 million jury verdict. Chrysler recalled more than 4 million minivans. Together with Tab Turner, Watts spearheaded the litigation nationwide against Firestone Tire Company and Ford Motor Company for defective Firestone tire failures, causing rollover of Ford Explorer vehicles. By the close of the litigation, Watts and Turner had recovered hundreds of millions of dollars in recoveries for their clients, and the two corporate behemoths had been forced to publicly apologize and to recall more than 17 million defective tires. Watts tried the first case in the country in other product defect litigations, including cases involving Rezulin, a diabetes drug that caused liver damage, which ultimately was recalled; Sulzer Hip Implants, where oily residue on implants caused the product to fail, and where his punitive damage verdict against the company led to a nationwide settlement of more than $1 billion involving the now-recalled defective implants; the drug Levaquin, where Watts obtained the only Plaintiffs' verdict in the United States. In total, Watts has achieved more than $1 billion in jury verdicts and arbitration awards, and more than $3 billion in settlement recoveries, on behalf of his clients. Watts repeatedly has been named one of the top trial lawyers in the United States. Having tried cases in courtroom across the United States, Watts frequently lectures other lawyers at seminars across the country.  Federal fraud trial  In September 2016, Watts was indicted on federal criminal fraud charges. The indictment alleged that he committed fraud when he signed up more than 40,000 clients along the coast after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. He was charged with \\"fabricating thousands of clients, including the representation of a dog by the name of Lucy Lu.\\" Before he was indicted, Watts's law firm reached a settlement with BP for $2.3 billion on behalf of 41,000 seafood industry workers. Watts' criminal trial began in July 2016. His brother was also a co- defendant. At the start of the trial, Watts fired his attorney and chose to represent himself in the case. On August 18, the jury acquitted Watts and his co-defendants on all criminal charges. However, the jury found guilty several people that Watts hired in Mississippi to gather clients for his litigation against BP.  Lawsuit against Watts for identity theft  On March 3, 2016, a $100 million lawsuit was filed for identify theft against two Texas attorneys (John Cracken of Dallas and Bob Hilliard of Corpus Christi) and one non- attorney (Max Duncan of Kerrville) in Harris County, Texas District Court. The attorneys were accused of using \\"case runners to steal the identities of Vietnamese-Americans damaged by spill.\\" Duncan helped finance this effort. After the case was filed, Watts' name was added as a co-defendant. However, on September 13, Watts was non-suited, meaning he was removed from the lawsuit.  Personal life  He has been married to Tammy, and the couple have three children, Taylor, Hailey, and Brandon. Mikal has two brothers David and Guy. Watts and his wife are actively involved in their church, Oak Hills Church is San Antonio, pastored by Max Lucado and Randy Frazee. Watts and his wife Tammy founded Rapha God Ministries, a ministry they founded in order to provide free Christian prayer counseling to those in need.Watts for US Senate Exploratory Committee Watts opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, but supports civil unions for same-sex couples.

In later stages of the disease, these streaks may become necrotic, and the heart of the pseudostem may rot, ultimately leading to death of the plant. Although not necessary to complete the life cycle, members of Caulimoviridae (as well as Geminiviridae) have been shown to integrate into their host genomes.

The lands incorporated into the diocese had been dominated by the nomadic Cumans since about 1100. Catholic missions began after Andrew II of Hungary granted Burzenland to the Teutonic Knights in 1211. After Andrew expelled the Knights from the territory in 1225, Dominican friars continued the Cuman mission. Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom baptized Boricius, an influential Cuman chieftain, two years later. Robert ordained a Hungarian Dominican friar, Theodoric, as the first bishop of Cumania in early 1228. Pope Gregory IX confirmed Theodoric's consecration on 21 March of that year, and the diocese was subordinate to the Holy See in 1229. The episcopal see was on the Milcov River, but its exact location is unknown. The diocese included Burzenland and lands east of the Carpathian Mountains. Vlachs (Romanians) who belonged to the Orthodox Church were a significant part of the diocese's population. They did not follow the Catholic bishop, and persuaded many Catholic Hungarians and Saxons to accept their Orthodox bishops. The diocese was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Europe in 1241, and its property was seized by neighboring landowners. A Franciscan friar was ordained to the see in 1334, but he and his successors (who bore the title Bishop of Milkovia) could not restore the bishopric and its estates.  History  = Background (before 1211) = Cuman stone statue The nomadic Cumans controlled the lands north of the Lower Danube and east of the Carpathian Mountains after about 1100. Archaeological research indicates that most settlements in the territory had been abandoned by that time. According to John Kinnamos, a Byzantine army which invaded the Kingdom of Hungary in 1166 \\"had passed through some wearisome and rugged regions and had gone through a land entirely bereft of men\\"Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus by John Kinnamos (6.3.261), p. 196. before entering Hungary across the Eastern Carpathians. Twelfth-century Sicilian Muslim geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi wrote that the two Cuman groups (the Black Cumans and White Cumans) were separated from each other by the Dniester River. Describing the eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary around 1150, Otto of Freising mentioned the \\"open land of the Patzinaks and the Falones\\"The Deeds of Frederick Barbarossa (1.32), p. 66. (the Pechenegs and Cumans, respectively). He described the territory as a \\"very fine hunting ground practically untouched by plow and hoe\\", suggesting a lack of agriculture. However, archaeological research has indicated that local inhabitants practised agriculture in the Prut-region settlements during the 11th and . According to the Hypatian Codex, Ivan Rostislavich‚Äîwho claimed the Principality of Halych (or Galicia)‚Äî\\"did harm to the Galician fishermen\\" on the Lower Danube (implying that portions of the lands between the Eastern Carpathians and the river were controlled by the princes of Halych). The Cumans were pagans who worshipped the sky, the earth and other natural elements. According to Niketas Choniates's chronicle, \\"the Vlachs, who had heard rumors\\"O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (2.4.131) , p. 74. of the escape of Andronikos Komnenus (a rebellious cousin of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I), captured him in 1164 at the borders of Halych. Choniates reported that Vlachs, Slavs and Cumans also inhabited the lands between the Carpathians and the Lower Danube, and the Vlachs' cooperation with the Cumans against the Byzantine Empire is well-documented. According to Anna Comnena, local Vlachs showed \\"the way through the passes\\"Anna Comnena: The Alexiad (10.3.), p. 299. of the Balkan Mountains to Cumans who invaded the Byzantine lands south of the Lower Danube in 1094. Peter and Asen, leaders of the 1186 rebellion of the Bulgarians and Vlachs against Byzantine rule, crossed the lower Danube to seek assistance from the Cumans in the summer of 1186 and returned \\"with their Cuman auxiliaries\\"O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (5.1.374) , p. 206. to continue the fight. \\"Cumans, with a division of Vlachs, crossed\\"O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (6.1.499) , p. 275. the lower Danube and invaded Thrace in 1199. However, conflicts between the Cumans and the Vlachs were also recorded. According to a 1250 royal charter, King Andrew I of Hungary dispatched Joachim, Count of Hermannstadt to lead an army of Saxon, Vlach, Sz√©kely and Pecheneg warriors to assist Boril in Bulgaria after \\"three chieftains from Cumania\\" rebelled against Boril of Bulgaria in the early 1210s. The reference to the Vlachs' participation in Joachim's campaign is some of the earliest evidence of Vlach communities subjected to Hungarian rule. The Vlachs had a special status, distinct from other commoners in the Kingdom of Hungary. They paid in-kind taxes, such as a quinquagesima (one- fiftieth) on their herds; Orthodox, they were exempt from the tithes paid by Catholic peasants. = Conversion of Cuman tribes (1211‚Äì1228) = King Andrew II of Hungary granted Burzenland in southeastern Transylvania to the Teutonic Knights in 1211, tasking them with defending his kingdom's borders and converting the neighboring Cumans. The king also authorized the Knights to erect wooden fortresses and expand their authority over the Carpathians. The Knights were allowed to invite colonists to their lands, and settlers were exempted from church tithes. According to a non-authentic papal bull written almost a decade later, their territory extended as far as the lower Danube and the \\"borders of the Brodniks\\" (the Siret region) in 1222. Papal letters also stated that an unspecified number of Cumans and their wives and children were willing to convert after the Knights defeated them. The Cumans' power diminished sharply after the Mongol victory over a coalition of Rus' princes and Cuman chieftains in the 23 May 1223 Battle of the Kalka River. The Teutonic Knights attempted to overthrow King Andrew, and asked Pope Honorius III to protect their lands. The king invaded the Knights' domain, expelling them in 1225. Andrew made his oldest son, B√©la, Duke of Transylvania the following year. Duke B√©la, who wanted to expand his authority over the neighboring Cuman tribes, supported the Dominican friars' missionary activities. Giovanni Bellini's portrait of St. Dominic, who decided to convert the Cumans before his death According to Friar Rudolf of Faenza's testimony during Saint Dominic's canonization, the founder of the Dominican Order \\"wanted to save all men, Christian and Saracens, but especially the Cumans and other pagans\\" and expressed \\"his desire to go to the Cumans and other infidels\\". The Dominican province of Hungary, one of the order's first territories, was created in the early 1220s. Paulus Hungarus, its first head, \\"decided to send some virtuous brothers\\" to the Cumans in the early 1220s; according to The Lives of the Brethren, written during the 1250s by Friar Gerard de Frachet, they were unsuccessful and returned. De Frachet wrote that the next Dominican mission to the Cumans reached the Dnieper River, but the friars \\"suffered hunger, thirst, lack of covering and persecutions; some of them were held captive and two were killed\\". Historian Claudia F. Dobre wrote that the \\"way for the Cumans' conversion was opened\\" after their defeat at the Kalka River, due to Duke B√©la's support of the Dominican missionaries. The nearly-contemporaneous Alberic of Trois-Fontaines wrote that a Cuman chieftain's son visited Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom in Hungary in 1227, asking the archbishop to baptize him and his 12 retainers. The Cuman nobleman also reported that his father and his 2,000 subjects were also willing to come to Transylvania to be baptized. Robert accepted the offer and went to Transylvania with three Hungarian prelates: Bartholomew le Gros, Bishop of P√©cs; Bartholomew, Bishop of Veszpr√©m, and Raynald of Belleville, Bishop of Transylvania. According to the chronicle of the Frisian Emo, they met the Cuman chieftain \\"Boricius, fourth in rank among the major Cuman leaders\\" and baptized him and his retainers in the presence of Duke B√©la. The number of Cumans baptised with their chief varies from source to source. Emo specified a \\"large number\\", Alberic noted 15,000, and the Chronicon Austriacum and other Austrian chronicles described 10,000 converts. According to The Lives of the Brethren, another Cuman chieftain who was \\"an even more important leader\\" was baptized \\"with about a thousand of his kinsmen\\". In a 31 July 1228 letter to Archbishop Robert of Esztergom, Pope Gregory IX expressed joy at the missionaries' success in \\"Cumania\\" and the neighboring \\"land of the Brodniks\\". = Creation and fall (1228‚Äì1241) = The conversion of thousands of Cumans was followed by the creation of the bishopric of Cumania. According to Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Archbishop Robert of Esztergom consecrated Theodoric bishop of the new diocese in 1228. The consecration of Theodoric, who had been a monk in the Dominican province of Hungary, was confirmed by Pope Gregory on 21 March. The pope urged the head of the Hungarian Dominicans to send new missionaries to the Cumans and praised Duke B√©la, who had decided to visit Cumania with Archbishop Robert. Pope Gregory IX, who confirmed the establishment of the Diocese of Cumania According to Pope Gregory's 1228 letter, the nomadic Cumans were willing to settle in newly-established villages and towns and build churches. However, relations between the Cumans and their priests were often tense; the pope advised Bishop Theodoric of Cumania in 1229 to show mercy to the newly-converted Cumans who had attacked clerics and not punish them for minor crimes. The pope exempted the Diocese of Cumania from the authority of the Archbishops of Esztergom on 13 September 1229, subjecting its bishop directly to the Holy See. Gregory IX urged King Andrew II of Hungary to allow the Teutonic Knights to return to Cumania in at least four letters between 1231 and 1234. Nevertheless, Hungary remained the principal ally of the Holy See in Southeastern Europe; Andrew II emphasized his claim to the newly-conquered lands by adopting the title \\"King of Cumania\\" in the early 1230s. Pope Gregory wrote to Duke B√©la on 25 October 1234, reminding him of his previous offer to build a church in Cumania and encouraging him to grant estates to the bishop of Cumania. The pope's next letter, written on 14 November 1234, stated that there were \\"certain people within the Cuman bishopric named 'Walati (Vlachs). The Vlachs did not receive their sacraments from the Catholic bishop, but \\"from some pseudo-bishops of the Greek rite\\". According to the pope, the Vlachs persuaded \\"Hungarians, Saxons and other Catholics\\" who had settled in Cumania to join the Orthodox church. Gregory IX authorized Bishop Theodoric to consecrate a Catholic bishop for the Vlachs, and asked Duke B√©la to help Theodoric impose his authority over the Vlachs. The pope's letter suggests that the Vlachs were a significant group (possibly the majority) among the peoples of Cumania, and they had their own local church hierarchy. The Mongols again invaded the easternmost regions of the \\"Cuman steppes\\", forcing tens of thousands of Cumans to seek refuge in Hungary or Bulgaria around 1240. The Bishopric of Cumania was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Central Europe in 1241. According to the contemporaneous Roger of Torre Maggiore, Bochetor and \\"other kings\\" led the Mongol army to the \\"land of the bishop of the Cumans\\"Master Roger's Epistle (ch. 20), p. 167. and annihilated the local army. The invaders destroyed the episcopal see and murdered many Dominican friars: = Aftermath (after 1241) = The Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century (the grey area east of the Sz√©kelys and the Banate of Severin was included in the bishopric of Cumania) The Mongols conquered the steppes as far as the Lower Danube. They massacred or enslaved many Cumans, but significant Cuman groups survived and preserved their separate identity in the Mongol Empire until the end of the 14th century. The Holy See did not abandon the idea of proselytizing in Cumania after the Mongol invasion, and Pope Innocent IV praised the Dominicans for their successful missions to the Cumans in 1253. However, Pope Nicholas III mentioned in a 7 October 1278 letter that Catholics had disappeared from the Diocese of Cumania because no bishop lived there since the destruction of the episcopal see. The pope urged Philip, Bishop of Fermo (his legate in Hungary) to investigate the situation in the former bishopric. Franciscan friars played an important role in Catholic missions to the lands east of the Carpathians. The Holy See had authorized the order to administer the sacraments, build churches and grant indulgences in Cumania in 1239, renewing the authorization six years later. Missionaries risked their lives in the lands subject to the Mongols in the first half of the ; \\"Saracens\\" murdered Friar Pietro da Unghera near Transylvania in 1314, and Friars Blasius and Marcus were martyred in Siret in 1340. Pope John XXII considered restoring the bishopric in 1332. In a letter addressed to Csan√°d Telegdi, the Archbishop of Esztergom, he wrote that \\"the powerful of those lands\\" had seized the property of the Diocese of Cumania. Hoping to receive royal support for his plan, the pope decided to make the Franciscan Vitus de Monteferreo (Charles I of Hungary's chaplain) bishop of Milkovia. Although the pope confirmed Vitus's ordination two years later, no evidence exists that the bishop ever visited his diocese. Other bishops were ordained to the see of Milkovia during the next century, but their attempts to regain the properties of the Diocese of Cumania were unsuccessful.  Territory and see  The borders of the Diocese of Cumania cannot be exactly determined. Roger of Torre Maggiore wrote that the Mongols crossed the Siret River before entering the Diocese of Cumania, which indicates that the river was the diocese's eastern border. A 1235 list of the Premonstratensians' houses in Hungary noted that \\"Corona\\" (now Bra»ôov in Romania) was in the Cumanian diocese, suggesting that it included southeastern Transylvania. According to historian Victor Spinei, \\"Southeastern Transylvania was included within the bishopric most likely to secure a constant source of revenue from the collection of tithes for the emerging ecclesiastical structure during the first years after the conversion of the Cumans\\". Spinei wrote that the Trotu»ô River must have formed the diocese's northeastern border, and the BuzƒÉu River its southeastern frontier. The location of the episcopal see is the subject of scholarly debate. In his 1278 letter, Pope Nicholas III wrote that the civitas de Mylco (on the Milcov River) was the seat of the Cumanian bishop. Nicolae Iorga identified civitas de Mylco with Odobe»ôti; Constantin C. Giurescu with Reghiu and then with Odobe»ôti, and Carol Auner with the CrƒÉciuna Citadel at C√¢mpineanca. According to archaeologists Adrian Andrei Rusu and Anton ParaginƒÉ, the see of the bishopric was in Foc»ôani or V√¢rte»ôcoiu (where small 13th-century forts were excavated). Two Cuman chieftains were buried \\"in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin\\", according to The Lives of the Brethren, indicating that at least one chapel was built in the see of the bishopric. The 1278 letter of Pope Nicholas also referred to the cathedral which had been destroyed by the Mongols. The Dominican Theodoric served as bishop under Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom from 1228 to 1234 or later; papal documents note an unnamed bishop of Cumania in 1235 and 1238.

The club was founded in 1961 by Jimmy Tindall (later a youth development officer for West Ham United), playing eight-a-side at first before progressing to 11-a-side within two years. The club had three 11-a-side teams to begin with, all playing in the Regent's Park League. Tindall's recruitment policy was to pick up only the best young players, stipulating that to play for Senrab, a player must have previously played for his district or county. In the early 1970s, so many Senrab players signed for Chelsea that former player Ray Lewington nicknamed Senrab \\"Chelsea Juniors\\". In 2014 Senrab were shortlisted for the Daily Mirror Pride of Sport Awards in the Local Team of the Year Category. Operation Senrab operates 15 teams for age groups ranging from 5 to 17 years old.

Several banks, for example, might chip in to fund one extremely large loan, with one of the banks taking the role of the \\"lead bank\\". This lending institution then recruits other banks to participate and share the risks and profits. The lead bank typically originates the loan, takes responsibility for the loan servicing of the participation loan, organizes and manages the participation, and deals directly with the borrower. Credit unions can also participate loans in the same manner. \\"Participations\\" in the loan are sold by the lead financial institution (\\"FI\\") to other FI's. A separate contract called a loan participation agreement is structured and agreed among the FI's. Loan participations can either be made on a pari passu basis with equal risk sharing for all loan participants, or on a senior/subordinated basis, where the senior lender is paid first and the subordinate loan participation paid only if there are sufficient funds left over to make the payments. Such senior/subordinated loan participations can be structured either on a LIFO (Last In First Out) or FIFO (First In First Out) basis (see FIFO and LIFO accounting). The most compelling reasons that financial institutions use participation loans are as follows: *Selling loan participations allows the lead bank to originate an exceptionally large loan that would otherwise be too large for it to handle by itself. By engaging other banks as participants, the lead bank can remain within its own legal lending limits and still come up with sufficient cash for funding. *Banks that buy loan participations share in the profits of the lead bank. If a lending institution isn't doing much business on its own, or is in a slow market, it can team up with a profitable \\"lead bank\\" in a healthier market to generate more lending income. *Buying participation loans is a way for banks to diversify their assets. By investing a variety of loans in different locales, they reduce their risk and exposure to potential losses if a calamity, such as a natural disaster or severe economic depression, were to strike their particular community. *Selling loan participations allows a bank to reduce its credit risk to a customer or specific community that entails greater than average risk. *Selling participation loans allows the lead bank to keep control of more of an important customer relationship or even an entire customer relationship of large customers of the bank, instead of sharing the relationship with other competing banks.

Bobo (i.e. bourgeois-Bohemian) chic was used in a similar sense. =Beach chic= \\"Beach chic\\" was the title of an article in 2006 by the Times fashion editor Lisa Armstrong about shopping for accessories to accompany a bikini.Times Magazine, 22 July 2006 These included a \\"cover-up\\" (e.g. a kaftan), flat sandals, a hat, a fake tan and - with the comforting footnote, \\"No, you will not look like a WAG [wife or girlfriend of a footballer]\\" - denture cleaner to whiten finger-nails. The Sunday Times referred to the Moroccan resort of Essaouira as the \\"boho/barefoot-chic beach\\" (the latter possibly a play on the term, \\"bare- faced cheek\\").Style, 18 June 2006 See also Seaside chic. =Boho-chic= Trend of fashion in the early 2000s (decade) which drew on earlier Bohemian and hippie styles. It was associated in particular with actress Sienna Miller and model Kate Moss. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have both become icons for this style. =Bon chic bon genre= :See Parisian chic =Camilla chic= Emulating the style, of which Burberry was a feature, of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, who married Charles, Prince of Wales in 2005.Susie Dent (2005) Fanboys and Overdogs =Casual chic= \\"Casual chic\\" (or \\"chic casual\\") is a difficult term to define, but can perhaps best be described as \\"dressing down\\" in a stylish way. In 2007, the clothing retailer Marks & Spencer suggested that some of the elements of \\"chic casual\\" were skinny jeans, \\"longline, clingy jerseys\\", \\"statement\\" bags and chunky jewellery, slouchy sweaters and hoodies with comfortable flats. Singer Victoria Beckham was identified as epitomising this style.Your M&S;, Spring 2007 Easy chic (\\"breezy blouses, slouchy knits and sexy denim\\") has similar connotations. =Chav chic= :See council house chic =Checkout chic= Referring to fashion ranges promoted by major supermarkets: \\"Tesco has stepped up its 'checkout chic' war with Asda by launching a design-led range of clothes to tempt female shoppers\\".Metro, 29 August 2006 Cheap chic was used in a similar sense, though more in terms of the comparison between prices at supermarkets and those of leading fashion houses: \\"You can achieve this season's look just by visiting your local supermarket\\".Metro, 31 August 2006 =Chelsea chic= Used by the Sunday Times (\\"The Sloane gets a sexy revamp\\") for fashionable trends among well-heeled \\"Sloane Rangers\\" (a portmanteau term coined in 1975 by Peter York, style editor of Harpers & Queen, from Sloane Square and the 1950s TV series The Lone RangerSee Oxford Dictionary of New Words, 1991) in the Chelsea area of south west London. =Communist chic= =Council house chic= \\"Council house chic\\"Susie Dent (2004) Larpers and Shroomers or chav chic (\\"Chav Chic might have sunk the house of Burberry\\"The Times Magazine, 26 June 2005) referred to the fashions of working class \\"chavs\\" who shared Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall's taste for Burberry check. See also Camilla chic. =Cycle chic= To be well dressed and smart in everyday clothes whilst cycling for ordinary journeys.Cycle Chic Manifesto, http://www.copenhagencyclechic.com/2008/04/cycle-chic-manifesto.html =Eco Chic= Eco Chic means the use of eco-friendly textiles, such as organic cotton, silk and hemp, and also reconstructed clothing. =Geek chic= \\"The look of a computer nerd\\".Dent (2003) The Language Report =Goth chic= Title of a \\"connoisseur's guide\\" by Gavin Baddeley (2002) to dark or Gothic culture. Among those associated with the \\"goth look\\" were the late 1970s punk band Siouxsie and the Banshees, American punk cabaret duo The Dresden Dolls, formed in 2000, and Betty Curse, described by The Times in 2006 as the \\"princess of Goth pop\\".The Times Knowledge, 3 June 2006 =Heroin chic= Heroin chic was a look popularized in mid-1990s fashion and characterized by pale skin, dark circles underneath the eyes and angular bone structure. The look, characterised by emaciated features and androgyny, was a reaction against the healthy and vibrant look of models such as Cindy Crawford and Claudia Schiffer. A 1996 article in The Los Angeles Times opened that the fashion industry had \\"a nihilistic vision of beauty\\" that was reflective of drug addiction, while U.S. News & World Report called the movement a \\"cynical trend\\". =Hick chic= Hick chic\\" was the subject of an article in Country Life in 2006 by Carla Carlisle, American-born wife of former British Member of Parliament, Sir Kenneth Carlisle. Lady Carlisle cited a friend's description of the term: \\"it's farmers' markets, four-wheel drive cars, labradors, Harris Tweed, Shaker furniture, Emma Bridgewater [tableware] ...\\".Country Life, 23 November 2006 \\"Hick\\" derives from \\"Old Hickory\\", a nickname for Andrew Jackson, US President 1829‚Äì37, a frontiersman who, like hickory wood, was known for his toughness. =High Street chic= Applied to the sort of \\"everyday\\" sense of style that might be spotted in any metropolitan or provincial setting; most likely to be associated with prevailing \\"shop window\\" fashions. In 2004 the Observer wrote of the singer Dido that \\"she drifts on stage dressed in high-street chic: faded denim and a tracksuit top, which she slips off to reveal a pink camisole vest\\".Observer\\", 1 August 2004 Samantha Cameron, wife of British Conservative Party leader and future Prime Minister David Cameron was described in 2006 as \\"spurn[ing] the designers ... for high street chic\\".London Lite, 2 October 2006 = Hippie chic= :Also known as Art-school chic and Talitha Getty chic Broadly similar to boho-chic (see e.g. London Evening Standard Magazine, 11 March 2005), the Hippie chic was associated in the mid-1990s with Tom Ford‚Äôs collections for the Italian house of Gucci and, indeed, various aspects of hippie fashion re-appeared periodically after the \\"Summer of Love\\" of 1967 when hippiedom and psychedelia were at their peak. Art-school chicSunday Times Style, 1 May 2005 had roughly similar connotations. Talitha Getty chic was applied by Hedley Freeman in the GuardianGuardian, 24 June 2005 to the hippie style associated in the late 1960s (and since) with the actress wife (died 1971) of John Paul Getty. Talitha Getty is said to have inspired Ford's hippie-style creations. = Marzahn chic = :Also known as Lichtenberg chic Refers to the clothing style seen in some eastern and northern parts of Germany. It is composed of sweatpants or tracksuits, baseball caps and running shoes, commonly in bright colors like neon pink or yellow. The name originates from the locality Berlin- Marzahn where this style can frequently be seen. It also refers to the clothing style of Cindy aus Marzahn, a fictional character played by German comedian Ilka Bessin. =Military chic= :Also known as Soldier chic Adoption of military gear such as camouflage patterned clothing, war medals, military insignia, surplus clothing or dog tag necklaces (adopted in the American Civil War) into fashion. The term and the similar soldier chic were widely applied c.2003-5, although in fact military apparel, such as the flight jackets worn by pilots during the Second World War, had frequently influenced fashion and paradoxically was often in vogue at times of anti-war feeling, such as in the late 1960s when protests against the Vietnam War were at their height (as, indeed, after the Iraq War of 2003): \\"One would have thought, given the unpopularity of armed forces activity in some quarters, that 'military chic' would not be, well, chic\\".Ken Kessler, The Times, 17 June 2006 =Nazi chic= Nazi chic is the incorporation of Nazi style clothing and culture, often used for shock value, as a form of rebellion against the status quo, although it is sometimes accompanied by a genuine sympathy for or adherence to the ideology of National Socialism. =Northern chic= Occasionally applied retrospectivelyFor example, The 60s: the Beatles' Decade, UKtv 2006 to aspects of the musical and cultural boom generated by the rock group, the Beatles, and other artists such as Gerry & The Pacemakers and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas in 1962-4 (the \\"Mersey Sound\\"). \\"Northern\\" is a reference both to Northern England (as also with \\"Northern soul\\") and Northern Songs, which published compositions by the Beatles' John Lennon and Paul McCartney. =Parisian chic= :Also known as Bon chic bon genre Frequently applied to anything stylish connected with the French capital Paris or to the style of French celebrities (e.g. actress Charlotte GainsbourgLondon Evening Standard magazine, 15 September 2006 or others living in Paris, such as the English actress Kristin Scott ThomasSee, e.g., The Times Guide to Paris Style & Fashion, October 2006). Variants included \\"Left Bank\\" or \\"Right Bank\\" chic (or even \\"Left Bank chic versus Right Bank polish\\").The Times Guide to Paris Style & Fashion, October 2006 Gainsbourg's mother, the British-born actress Jane Birkin, remarked that she would choose \\"English eccentricity over Parisian chic every time\\", adding, \\"chic you can learn - it's just a form of grooming\\".Sunday Times Style, 22 October 2006 The term bon chic bon genre or BCBG [\\"good style, good class\\"] was applied in the early 1980s to the French equivalent of British \\"Sloane Rangers\\", their typical \\"uniform\\" including a mackintosh, ballet shoes, trousers, a cashmere sweater, and accessories such as a \\"Birkin bag\\" and a Cartier Tank Fran√ßaise wrist-watch.Carola Long in The Times Guide to Paris Style & Fashion, October 2006 To a large extent, it refers to upper-class, or upper-middle-class, young men and women who are well-bred, or appear so, with good bones, slim bodies, and a sophisticated, but restrained and elegant, sense of style. In the U.S., the Ralph Lauren sense of style would be the equivalent. =Porn chic= \\"Porn chic\\" was first applied to films such as Deep Throat (1972) and Emmanuelle (1974) which were commercially successful and thus tended to bring \\"soft\\" pornography into the mainstream. Subsequently, it has been used to refer more generally to pornography in popular culture. =Prairie chic= Flat caps and floral dresses or aprons over jeans.For example, Daily Telegraph, 16 July 2003 =Radical chic= :Also known as Terrorist chic First coined by journalist Tom Wolfe in 1970, radical chic has since entered broad usage as a derogatory term for the pretentious adoption of radical causes by celebrities, socialites, and high society. =Rich-girl chic= Said to be \\"oozed\\" by a New York socialite in Plum Sykes' The Debutante Divorc√©e (2006). =Rock-girl chic= \\"Rock-girl chic\\" has meant different things during differing periods of music and fashion, but was often associated with a hippie image and was similar enough as a phrase to the slightly patronising \\"rock chick\\" to convey a sense of being a \\"groupie\\". This and similar terms, such as \\"boho-rock\\" (2006), were often applied to model Kate Moss, about whom Rebecca Ley from Times Online wrote that \\"Kate veers effortlessly between rock-girl chic and dripping-in-diamonds elegance\\".Times Magazine, http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article687726.ece Moss's relationship in 2005‚Äì7 with Pete Doherty of the group Babyshambles tended to emphasise the tag. =Rural chic= Applied by the Sunday Times to a fashion collection designed and modelled by Savannah Miller, Cotswold-based sister of actress and 2000s (decade) \\"boho-queen\\" Sienna Miller, for the Hong Kong based label, Shanghai Tang.Sunday Times Style, 20 August 2006 =Shabby chic= The deliberate use of worn and shabby materials in interior design or fashion. The effect of limewashing timber-framed buildings has been described as \\"shabby chic\\".James Boutwood, letter, Country Life, 19 October 2006 =Soldier chic= :See Military chic =Talitha Getty= :See Hippie chic =Terrorist chic= :See Radical chic =Tropical Chic= Tropical and Beach themed home accents that are influenced by island styles and tropical designs. Tropical Chic style includes modern appointments, yet casual island style living.Tropical Chic Style, Home Decorating News, 2 October 2008 =Waif Chic= Characterized by crochet-knit tops, over-sized sweaters that hang loosely off a thin frame, flats, and circle-frame glasses that accentuate a doe-eyed appearance. Waif chic first came to prominence in Cambridge, MA and is a popular look among college students and young professionals in the area. =Wilderness chic= Fashion trend inspired by clothing typical of hikers, climbers, and mountaineers.

The common symptoms for BSMV are yellow streaks or spots, mosaic, leaves and stunted growth. It is spread primarily through infected seed and can be spread through mechanical transfer of an infected and uninfected host. Plants infected with BSMV are more symptomatic in warmer temperatures. Resistant hosts and sterilization of equipment are the best ways to control the spread of the pathogen. BSMV has been known to reduce the yields of barley by up to 25%, but is not a major problem because of resistant varieties of barley.  Host and Symptoms  Barley stripe mosaic virus has a narrow host range. Horedum vulgare, commonly known as barley, is the main host for the virus. BSMV can also infect wheat, Triticum aestivum. Very rarely, BSMV can be seen in wild oats along with rye, maize, rice, sorghum, and millet. In experimental conditions, spinach, beetroot, and tobacco were able to be infected., Platz, G., Persley, D. and Plant Health Australia. (2009). Grains Industry Biosecurity Plan-Threat Specific Contingency Plan: Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus. Retrieved from http://www.planthealthaustralia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Barley- stripe-mosaic-virus-CP-2008.pdf] Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a useful tool that can differentiate between similar strains of barley stripe mosaic virus and provide quantitative results. ELISA works by using antibodies that are specific for a particular virus and the antibody-antigen interaction is mediated by a solid surface, which is usually a polystyrene multiwell plate.(2014). An introduction to ELISA. AbD Serotech.com. BioRad Laboratories, Inc. Retrieved from http://www.abdserotec.com/an-introduction-to-elisa.html. Common symptoms of BSMV are yellow to white mottling, spotting and streaking, necrosis and severe mosaic on leaves. Stunting is also very common. Symptoms can vary based on virus strain, host plant and environmental conditions. Symptoms are more prevalent in warm temperatures. Plants grown from infected seeds are severely stunted or could even die before emergence in very susceptible hosts varieties. Experimentally infected plants took 4‚Äì5 days for chlorotic symptoms to appear. Symptoms for BSMV are similar to barley stripe disease, a fungal disease caused by Pyrenophora graminea, though the two are caused by completely different pathogens and should be treated differently.  Disease Cycle  Barley stripe mosaic virus is not known to be transmitted through vectors. Rather, BSMV is confined to only plant tissues, of which it targets chloroplasts and nuclei within the mesophyll and epidermal cells. The virus can be indirectly spread to other plants because the virus can also aggregate in the seeds. Likewise, BSMV can be transmitted via mechanical inoculation to the plant. The main way the virus perpetuates itself is growth from an infected seed. The infection can persists for years inside the seed.Murray, T.D.; Parry, D.W.; Cattlin, N.D. (2008). Diseases of small grain crops: A color handbook. London, United Kingdom: Manson Publishing Ltd.  Environment  Unlike many viruses, there are no known insect vectors to spread the disease. Rather, BSMV relies on parent to offspring transmission. Temperature at which the infected plant is grown is critical to spreading and developing the disease. At higher temperatures, the symptoms are more severe. According to one study, when infected host plants were held at 7 ¬∞C, they took approximately 30 days to develop symptoms, and never were able to infect other potential hosts. However, at higher temperatures of 12-18 ¬∞C symptoms developed in 7‚Äì8 days and the virus was transmissible. However, it is still important to note that severity of symptoms don't always correlate with the amount of the virus present. Another found that the levels of virus present remained relatively constant over a range of 13 ¬∞C-25 ¬∞C and that the amount of virus present was related only to the age of the hosts and length of time that they were infected. Light intensity may also have an effect on the development of the disease symptoms. A study showed that heavily shaded infected plants showed little to no symptoms after 11 days when compared to non-shaded infected plants. A factor that affects the spread and severity of the virus is the species and variety of host, as some are more susceptible than others. For example, the barley variety CM67 is very susceptible. It has a much higher transmission rate than other varieties, and if symptoms are severe enough due to weather conditions, this variety can even be sterile. Another factor that affects the spread of the disease is the gametes bred to produce the offspring. One study found that about 10% of seeds produced from an infected harvest also contain the virus. One belief was that the virus could be spread to offspring by infected pollen grains, and because of this it was believed that it could potentially spread over long distances. However, an infected ovule is a more important factor for the spread of this disease. The disease is more likely to spread when an infected ovule produces progeny with infected pollen, with a 70% transmission rate. When an infected ovule is pollinated by an uninfected pollen there is only about a 66% transmission rate. In an uninfected ovule that is pollinated by infected pollen there is only about a 3% transmission rate to the offspring.  Management  The best way to control the virus is to plant with clean seed, since the virus is spread through infected seed. BMSV is also spread through mechanical transfer of the virus; reducing handling and movement through infected areas will help contain the disease. Sterilization of all tools and machinery, specifically irrigation systems, used in fields will reduce the spread of BMSV. Quaternary ammonium salts and hydrogen dioxides are two common commercial products used for sterilization of horticulture tools and machinery.Denny, G.C. and Vallad, G.E. Disinfection of horticulture tools. EDIS. University of Florida. retrieved from http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ep380 Removal of infected plants can help reduce the spread of the virus. In fields where the disease has gone unnoticed, allowing the virus to spread, it is important to prevent spread to other fields and prevent seeds from infected plants from being planted the next year, as they too are likely infected with virus. Chemical control and biological control are not known to exist for this virus. Host plant resistance is another form of management. Barley hosts differ in their susceptibility to BSMV. There are many types of resistant barley varieties including: Traill, Moreval, Modjo-1, Morex, Modjo, and CI 4197.  Importance  One study has found that the BSMV resistance gene shows Mendelian genetics and has shown to be dominant by complete mapping of the Bsr1 Barley Stripe Moasic Virus Resistance Gene in Brachypodium distachyon. Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus is one of the very few viruses that is transmitted through seeds for small grain cereals. BSMV mostly affects regions in Montana and North Dakota and have reduced yields by up to 25%. Shortly after its discovery, BSMV was found to be present in 97% of barley fields in North Dakota in 1954.Timian, R.G. (1971). Barley stripe mosaic virus in North Dakota. Farm Research. May‚ÄìJune issue To combat this, in 1957 Kansas, Montana, and North Dakota launched a seed certification program to obtain BSMV free barley seeds. The control program involved assaying seedlings for presence of the virus, and only seed foundations determined to be BSMV-free were used to produce certified BSMV-free seeds to be sold commercially. By 1972 a zero tolerance was placed on all certified seeds in Montana which led to a dramatic decline in yield loss due to BSMV. Similarly, in 1971 BSMV was eliminated in barley seeds in North Dakota.Sastry, K. S. (2013). Seed borne plant virus diseases. New Delhi, India. Springer India. However, despite not being a factor in crop production anymore, BSMV is still important in research, as various studies have shown that it can be used to study gene function via gene silencing in oat, wheat, and Brachypodium distachyon (a grass that is a model monocot for genetics research). One example of an accomplishment of BSMV gene silencing has been used to detect the location of powdery mildew resistance genes in barley. BSMV was the first virus-induced gene silencer found in monocots, which is important because many crops such as corn, rice, rye, sugarcane, sorghum, and the hosts of BSMV are monocots. This allows for a way to study the genes in monocots and for a way to compare the findings to those of the virus-induced gene silencing in dicots.

He was an ordained minister, theologian and political polemicist, and was the founder in 1788 of the Royal Literary Fund, of which he had been a proponent since 1773. Upbringing Williams was born in a house called Waunwaelod in Eglwysilan near Caerphilly. His early education was partly under John Smith, vicar of Eglwysilan, and he went on to a local school run by his namesake, David Williams. His father, William David, was converted to Methodism by Howell Harris; it was at his request that David Williams entered the ministry. Rev. David, an unfortunate speculator in mines and miners' tools, died in 1752; the family consisted of one surviving son and two daughters. His father on his deathbed made David promise to enter Carmarthen Academy to qualify as a dissenting minister. He studied there, with an exhibition from the London presbyterian board (1753 to Christmas 1757), under Evan Davies, a pupil of John Eames. The academy, hitherto Calvinist, had begun to acquire a heterodox repute. From February 1755 the London congregational board sent no students, owing to the alleged Arianism of Davies's assistant, Samuel Thomas. Davies himself resigned his chair in 1759 under suspicion of Arminianism. Williams' views were unconventional, largely thanks to his four years study at Carmarthen Academy, and he was regarded as a Deist. Ordination Williams was ordained in 1758 to the charge of the dissenting congregation at Frome, Somerset, on a stipend of ¬£45. This was the congregation from which Thomas Morgan, the deist, had been dismissed in 1720. Williams's theological views did not prove satisfactory. In 1761 he moved to the Mint meeting, Exeter, founded by James Peirce. Here he was reordained. He prepared A Liturgy on the Principles of the Christian Religion, which is said to have been adopted by his congregation. He soon quarrelled with 'elder members' who objected to his opinions. He retorted by finding fault with their morals. By way of an 'accommodation' he left Exeter about 1769 to take charge of a waning congregation in Southwood Lane, Highgate. To this congregation the father of John Wilkes used to drive in a coach-and-six. In this charge he appears to have remained till 1773. His withdrawal was ascribed by himself to 'the intrigues of a lady', and to no rejection of revelation, 'which he had taken for granted'. His successor, in 1774, was Joseph Towers. His first publication, The Philosopher, in Three Conversations, 1771, (dedicated to Lord Mansfield and Bishop Warburton), containing a project of church reform, drew the attention of John Jebb. With the co-operation of John Lee, a proposal was set on foot for opening a chapel in London with an expurgated prayer-book. Williams was to draw attention to the plan through the public papers. His communications to the Public Advertiser republished as Essays on Public Worship, Patriotism, and Projects of Reformation, 1773, were so deistic in tone as to put an end to the scheme. Letter to David Garrick A taste for the drama led to his acquaintance with David Garrick whom he met at the house of a hostess of 'the wits of the time.' With this lady he visited Henry Mossop, the actor, who attributed his misfortunes to Garrick's neglect. Williams wrote to the papers embodying Mossop's view, but the communication was not printed. Three months later he published his keen but truculent Letter to David Garrick, 1772. According to a note by John Philip Kemble in the British Museum copy there was a second edition; Williams, in an advertisement at the end of his Lectures, 1779, vol. i., claims the authorship of the Letter, and affirms that there was 'a surreptitious edition'. Morris, who reprints the Letter with a wrong date (1770), says it was withdrawn from sale. In the Private Correspondence of David Garrick, 1831, is a letter (2 October 1772), signed D. Ws hinting that the published 'Letter' was by 'a young man who is making himself known us a first-rate genius.... His name is Williams. He is intimate at Captain Pye's. Goldsmith knows him, and I have seen him go into Johnson's'. James Boaden, the editor of the 'Correspondence' calls the writer (evidently Williams himself) an 'arrogant boy '. On Mossop's death (18 November 1773) Williams wrote to Garrick, and received a touching reply. School and churches In 1773 Williams took a house in Lawrence Street, Chelsea, married Mary Emilia, a woman without a fortune, and set up a school. As the fruit of his ministry he published a volume of Sermons, chiefly upon Religious Hypocrisy (1774). His educational ideas, founded on those of John Amos Comenius, he embodied in his Treatise on Education (1774). Book-learning he subordinated to scientific training based on a first-hand knowledge of facts. He made a novel application of the drunken helot plan, obtaining from a workhouse a 'lying boy' as an object lesson. His school 'prospered beyond his expectations', but the death of his wife (in 1774) for a time unmanned him. He tore himself away, 'leaving his scholars to shift for themselves', and 'secluded himself in a distant country' for 'many months'. He went to Buxton, according to some accounts; he never returned to Chelsea. In 1774 Benjamin Franklin 'took refuge from a political storm' in Williams's house, and became interested in his method of teaching arithmetic. Franklin joined a small club formed at Chelsea by Williams, the manufacturer Thomas Bentley (partner of Josiah Wedgwood), and James \\"Athenian\\" Stuart. At this club Williams broached the scheme of a society for relieving distressed authors, which Franklin did not encourage him to pursue. It was noted at the club that most of the members, though 'good men', yet 'never went to church'. Franklin regretted the want of 'a rational form of devotion'. To supply this, Williams, with aid from Franklin, drew up a form. It was printed six times before it satisfied its sponsors, and was eventually published as A Liturgy on the Universal Principles of Religion and Morality, 1776. On 7 April 1776, Williams opened for morning service a vacant chapel near Cavendish Square (the building was replaced in 1858 by All Saints, Margaret Street), using his liturgy, and reading lectures, with texts usually from the Bible, sometimes from classic authors. He got 'about a score of auditors', who seem to have been persons of distinction. The opening lecture was published. Copies of the liturgy were sent to Frederick the Great and to Voltaire, who returned appreciative letters in bad French and good English respectively. International botanical travellers Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander 'now and then peeped into the chapel, and got away as fast as they decently could'. Williams's Letter to the Body of Protestant Dissenters, 1777, is a plea for such breadth of toleration as would legally cover such services as his. All the expenses fell on Williams, who was saved from ruin only by the subscription to his Lectures on the Universal Principles and Duties of Religion and Morality 1779. These lectures (critical rather than constructive, and not eloquent, though well written) were read at the chapel in 1776‚Äì1777. The experiment is said to have lasted four years, but it is probable that after the second year the services were not held in Margaret Street; they were transferred, on the advice of Robert Melville, to a room in the British Coffee House, Cockspur Street, Melville giving a dinner in Brewer Street after service, 'with excellent Madeira'. The statement by Thomas Somerville that Melville took him, in the period 1779‚Äì1785, to the service in 'Portland' Square is no doubt due to a slip of memory. Somerville's further statement that the 'dispersion of his flock' was due to Williams's 'immorality' becoming 'notorious' seems a groundless slander. No hint of it is conveyed in the satiric lampoon Orpheus, Priest of Nature 1781, which affirms, on the contrary, that Williams's principles were too strict for his hearers. The appellation 'Priest of Nature' is said to have been first given him by Franklin; 'Orpheus' ascribes it to 'a Socratic woollen-draper of Covent Garden'. Gregoire affirms that he had it from Williams that a number of his followers passed from deism to atheism. Williams now supported himself by taking private pupils. After the speech of Sir George Savile on 17 March 1779 in favour of an amendment of the Toleration Act, Williams published a letter on The Nature and Extent of Intellectual Liberty, 1779, claiming that religious toleration should be without restriction. It was answered by Manasseh Dawes. In the same year, and with the same object, he translated and published Voltaire's Treatise on Toleration, Ignorant Philosopher and Commentary on Beccaria. In 1780 he issued A Plan of Association on Constitutional Principles; and on the formation of county associations for parliamentary reform he published his Letters on Political Liberty (1782). This was translated into French the following year by Jacques Pierre Brissot, then in London conducting the Lyceum. Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Plati√®re, a friend of Brissot, visited London in 1784, when Williams made his acquaintance. Williams's publications at this period include Letters concerning Education 1785; Royal Recollections on a Tour to Cheltenham (anon.), 1788; Lectures on Political Principles 1789; Lectures on Education, 1789; Lessons to a Young Prince (anon.), 1790. Literary fund The idea of a \\"literary fund\\" to aid \\"distressed talents\\" was again suggested by Williams in a club of six persons, formed on the discontinuance of his Sunday lectures (1780), and meeting at the Prince of Wales's coffee-house, Conduit Street. Among its original members, besides Williams, were Captain Thomas Morris, John Gardner (vicar of Battersea), and perhaps the printer John Nichols. Fruitless applications were made after 1783 to William Pitt the Younger (who thought the matter very important), Charles James Fox, Edmund Burke, and Sir Joseph Banks. An advertisement was published (October 1786), 'with no material effect'. The death in a debtors' prison (1 April 1787) of Floyer Sydenham led Williams to press the matter. The club, not being unanimous, was dissolved, and another (of eight members) formed. At its first meeting (spring of 1788) the constitution of the Literary Fund, drawn up by Williams, was adopted, each member subscribing a guinea. An advertisement (10 May 1788) invited further subscriptions. The first general meeting to elect officers was held on Tuesday 18 May 1790 at the Prince of Wales's coffee-house. In the course of twelve years ¬£1,738 was distributed among 105 persons. The society was incorporated 19 May 1818; in 1842 it became the Royal Literary Fund. By the close of the century it possessed an income exceeding ¬£4,000, half from investments, and half from annual contributions. Later life At the instance of Dr. Hooper of Pant-y-Goetre and Morgan of Tredegar, Williams undertook to write a history of Monmouthshire, and in 1792 visited the county to collect materials. Shortly afterwards Roland, during his second term of office as minister of the interior, invited Williams to Paris. He went over about August 1792, was made a French citizen, and remained till the execution (21 January 1793) of Louis XVI, a measure which he strongly deprecated. While in Paris he published Observations sur la derniere Constitution de la France, 1793. He brought with him, on his return, a letter to William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, from Lebrun, minister of war, who wished to make Williams a medium of communication between the two governments; but no notice was taken of it. An engagement previously entered into for completing the continuation of Hume's History of England was cancelled, owing to the political odium incurred by his visit to France. His History of Monmouthshire, 1796, with illustrations drawn and partly engraved by his friend Gardner, and a very modest introduction, was considered a standard work on the subject; unfortunately it has no index. After the peace of Amiens (1802) he again visited France. It was surmised that he had been entrusted with some confidential mission by the English government. Before leaving he had published Claims of Literature, 1802, an authorised account of the Literary Fund. On his return he issued one or two anonymous political tracts, showing, it is said, a diminished confidence in revolutionary methods. His authorship of some anonymous publications is doubtful. On internal evidence he is credited with Egeria, 1803, intended as a first volume of a periodical devoted to political economy. His pecuniary resources failed him. He had suffered from paralytic attacks, and had a severe stroke in 1811, from which time his faculties declined. He was invited to take up his abode in the house of the Literary Fund, 36 Gerrard Street, Soho, and there he remained till his death, regularly attending the society's meetings. At a special meeting of the general committee, held without Williams's knowledge on 25 July 1815, it was resolved to offer him ¬£50 every six months, as evidence of the committee's 'attachment to the first principles of their society'. Only one instalment was paid before his death on 29 June 1816. A second instalment was handed to his niece and housekeeper, Mary Watkins. On 6 July he was buried in St Anne's Church, Soho, where there is a brief inscription to his memory. His will, dated 16 July 1814, left his papers to his executors, Richard Yates and Thomas Wittingham; his other property went to his niece and housekeeper, Mary Watkins (died 5 February 1845), who moved from Gerrard Street to Lower Sloane Street, and afterwards to King's Road, Chelsea. A memorial to Williams was erected in 1911 in the park adjoining Caerphilly Castle, now named David Williams Park. It was listed Grade II in 1999.

His governorship marked the beginnings of the restoration of the Calvert family's control of Maryland. Early Life and Family John Hart was a native of County Cavan, in Ireland. He was the son of Merrick Hart, of Crovert, and his wife Lettice Vesey. His maternal uncle was Archbishop John Vesey. Very few details of his early life survive, other than the fact that he served in Spain and Portugal during the War of the Spanish Succession.\\"Congressional Edition, Vol. 4011\\" pp. 233-234 John Hart married the widow Mary Purefoy, daughter of Henry Hart and Anne Beresford, daughter of Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet.Hart, Henry Travers \\"The Family History of Hart of Donegal\\" pg. 38 They had two children: a son Thomas, and a daughter Marylandia. Governor of Maryland Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore had witnessed his family's loss of their proprietary Province of Maryland in 1689, in part because of his family's Roman Catholic religion. Calvert calculated that the chief impediment to the restoration of his family's title to Maryland was his Catholicism, and he therefore converted to Anglicanism, deciding to \\"embrace the protestant religion\\", and gambling that this move would win back his family's lost fortune in the New World. Such a bold move would come at a cost. Benedict's father Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, furious at his son's apostacy, withdrew his annual allowance of ¬£450 and ended his support for his grandchildren's education and maintenance. Benedict was able to persuade the Crown to grant him an allowance of ¬£300 a year, and Queen Anne even acceded to his nomination of John Hart as governor of the province, on condition that Hart would share with Calvert ¬£500 per annum out of his profits from the office. Hart's governorship therefore marked the beginnings of the restoration of the Calvert family's control of Maryland. Governor of the Leeward Islands After the end of his time as governor of Maryland, Hart was appointed governor of the Leeward Islands, a position which he held from 1721-1727.

Overview of Properties  Organic compounds such as amino acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and phenols are highly enriched in the SML interface. Most of these come from biota in the sub-surface waters, which decay and become transported to the surface,Aller, J., Kuznetsova, M., Jahns, C., Kemp, P.

Dissolved Organic Materials in Surface Microlayers: Temporal and Spatial Variability and Relation to Sea State. Limnology and Oceanography, 28.3. 415-431 though other sources exist also such as atmospheric deposition, coastal runoff, and anthropogenic nutrification. The relative concentration of these compounds is dependent on the nutrient sources as well as climate conditions such as wind speed and precipitation. These organic compounds on the surface create a \\"film,\\" referred to as a \\"slick\\" when visible, which affects the physical and optical properties of the interface. These films occur because of the hydrophobic tendencies of many organic compounds, which causes them to protrude into the air- interface.Carlson, David J. (1982). Surface microlayer phenolic enrichments indicate sea surface slicks. Nature. 296.1. 426-429. The existence of organic surfactants on the ocean surface impedes wave formation for low wind speeds. For increasing concentrations of surfactant there is an increasing critical wind speed necessary to create ocean waves. Increased levels of organic compounds at the surface also hinders air-sea gas exchange at low wind speeds.Woodcock, A. (1953). Salt nuclei in marine air as a function of altitude and wind force. Journal of Meteorology, 10, 362‚Äì371.

They can be dispersed to heights of several meters, picking up whatever particles latch on to their surface. However, the major supplier of materials comes from the SML.

These materials can be transferred from the sea-surface to the atmosphere in the form of wind-generated aqueous aerosols due to their high vapor tension and a process known as volatilisation.

These aerosols are able to remain suspended in the atmosphere for about 31 days. Evidence suggests that bacteria can remain viable after being transported inland through aerosols. Some reached as far as 200 meters at 30 meters above sea level.

He played 18 years of professional baseball, including four years in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers (1937‚Äì1939) and St. Louis Browns (1940). In his major league debut in May 1937, Coffman won in an 11-inning, 4-2 pitching duel with Lefty Grove. Coffman compiled a career record of 15-12 in 313 innings pitched with a 5.60 earned run average. Biography =Early years= Coffman was born in Veto, Alabama, a \\"little town about 25 feet south of the Tennessee state line.\\" He graduated from high school in Athens, Alabama. Coffman's older brother, Dick Coffman, was a major league pitcher for 15 seasons. The older brother made his major league debut in April 1927 while \\"Slick\\" was a 16-year-old high school student. =Minor leagues= After graduating from high school, Coffman played semi-professional baseball with the local team in Athens, a member of the Bee Line League. After one year with Athens, he played with minor league team in Montgomery, Alabama, and Dothan in the South Atlantic League. He won 12 games and lost 10 in 1934 for the Charleroi Tigers in the Pennsylvania State Association. Coffman's pitching ultimately drew the attention of major league scouts, and he was signed by the Detroit Tigers. In 1935, Coffman was assigned to the Charleston Senators in the Middle Atlantic League. Despite an 8-13 record in 1935, Coffman's 2.87 earned run average and his fastball showed promise. In September 1935, the Tigers announced that Coffman would report to Beaumont, Texas for the 1936 season. At the time, the Charleston Daily Mail summarized Coffman's performance and prospects as follows: > \\"Coming from a southern family that has already produced one big league > pitcher, Coffman has a thorough knowledge of his position. His blazing fast > ball is his biggest threat and it has enabled him to strike out 161 batters > this year while walking 82. While his control isn't as good as Twardy's, it > is good enough considering he is a fast ball pitcher.\\" In 1936, Coffman won 13 games and lost 12 for Beaumont. Coffman later recalled, \\"I had a fine season with Beaumont, and expected to make this my last season in the minors, for a spell.\\" After the final game at Beaumont, the Tigers called three players up to the majors  Birdie Tebbetts, George Gill and Coffman. =Detroit Tigers= In 1937, Coffman attended spring training with the Tigers, and as he later recalled, \\"this time I intended to stay with the big club.\\" During the 1937 spring training sessions, he developed a \\"reputation of being a big talker and a fierce competitor.\\" On the trip to Detroit following spring training, the Tigers played an exhibition game in Cincinnati. Coffman combined with All-Stars Schoolboy Rowe and Tommy Bridges for a shutout. Despite his performance against Cincinnati, Detroit manager Mickey Cochrane told him after the game, \\"We are sending you to Toledo.\\" After unsuccessfully arguing that he had earned a spot on the Tigers' roster, Coffman told Cochrane, \\"I'll go to Toledo, but mark my word, I'll be back up in less than 30 days.\\" At Toledo, Coffman won six games for the Mud Hens, leading the Toledo Blade to report: \\"This 21-year-old right-handed pitcher of the Toledo Mud Hens is proving one of the sensations of the season in the American Association.\\"\\" Coffman was promptly called up to Detroit and joined the Tigers in Philadelphia, and Cochrane told Coffman that he would pitch the first game of a series in Boston. In Boston, Coffman recalled that the newspaper headlines reported that \\"the young upstart from the cotton fields of Alabama would pitch against the incomparable Lefty Grove.\\" On the day of his debut, Cochrane came into the clubhouse and announced that Eldon Auker would start the game. Coffman complained to Cochrane, \\"But Mickey you told me I would pitch today, and I'm prepared to do just that.\\" Cochrane responded, \\"I don't care what I told you. Go out there and bring somebody in like Schoolboy Rowe. Grove's pitching today and I want you to get off to a better start...you know we never score many runs off him.\\" Coffman replied, \\"Well let me tell you Mickey they won't score many runs off of me, either.\\" Coffman recalled that this was all Cochrane was waiting for, and he slammed his fist on a table and exclaimed, \\"OK kid I'll catch you.\\" In his first big league start, Coffman got the win against Grove, as the Tigers beat Boston, 4-2. Coffman and Grove both pitched complete games, and Coffman allowed eight hits in 11 innings; he also had a hit in Detroit's 11th inning rally. The Associated Press account of the game opened as follows: \\"Youthful George (Slick) Coffman, making his big- league debut with the Detroit Tigers, today pitched his teammates to an 11-lnnlng 4 to 2 victory over the Boston Red Sox.\\" For the remainder of the 1937 season, Coffman was used principally as a reliever by the Tigers, appearing in 28 games, but only five as a starter. He compiled a record of 7-5 in 101 innings pitched with a 4.37 earned run average. In 1938, Coffman continued in his role as a relief pitcher for Detroit. His 39 games was ninth most in the American League, and only six of his appearances were as a starter. He finished the 1938 season with a record of 4-4 and an earned run average of 6.02 in 95-2/3 innings pitched. When Coffman entered a game in 1938, one of the local writers grabbed the announcer's microphone and drawled, \\"Gawge (Slick) Coffman now pitchin' fuh Dee-troit.\\" Coffman reportedly had \\"an accent thicker than Judge Landis' hair.\\" Coffman was with the Tigers in June 1939 when Lou Gehrig was pulled from the Yankees lineup in a game at Briggs Stadium. Coffman recalled, \\"Gehrig took infield practice as always that day and many fans were unaware that a historic event was about to take place. We had already been informed by Manager Del Baker that Lou would not play. When the announcement was made that Gehrig was being removed from the lineup it shook a sellout crowd up like nothing before had ever done. They gave the Ole Iron Horse a standing ovation which one would have to see to believe.\\" =St. Louis Browns= After the 1939 season, the Tigers traded Coffman. He was initially traded with Benny McCoy to the Philadelphia Athletics for outfielder Wally Moses. However, the trade was cancelled when Judge Landis declared several Detroit players, including McCoy, to be free agents. After the first trade fell apart, Coffman was traded to the St. Louis Browns for catcher Billy Sullivan. Recognizing that Coffman was angry over the Tigers' decision to trade him, the Browns' manager designated Coffman as the Browns' starting pitcher on opening day in April 1940. In front of nearly 50,000 Detroit fans, Coffman beat Detroit's Bobo Newsom. One newspaper account reported, \\"The day's biggest turnout, 49,417 customers at Detroit, had to watch their Tigers take a 5-1 lashing by the St. Louis Browns behind the seven-hit hurling of George 'Slick' Coffman, whom Detroit discarded during the winter.\\" =Second run in minor leagues= Coffman played only one season for the Browns, but he remained active in baseball for another decade. He continued to play in the American Association and Pacific Coast League until 1949. His longest stint was five years with the St. Paul Saints in 1942 and 1945‚Äì1948. He finished his professional baseball career playing three games for the Toledo Mud Hens in 1949 at age 38. Overall, he went 63-74 in the minor leagues to go along with a 15-12 major league record. =Later years= In 1949, Coffman was hired by his former Detroit roommate Hank Greenberg to manage a minor league club in the Cleveland Indians organization. He later scouted for the Indians until a back injury forced him to retire from baseball. Coffman reportedly \\"loved baseball and loved to talk.\\" In 1953, Coffman attended a game in Detroit and was talking to Ted Williams when a photographer took their picture. The photograph appeared in the newspaper the next day with the caption, \\"A baseball oddity, Ted Williams with his eyes closed and Slick Coffman with his mouth shut.\\" Coffman died in 2003 at age 92 in Birmingham, Alabama.

Listed at , 160 lb., Cooney batted and threw right-handed. His father Jimmy Sr. and younger brother Johnny also played in the Major Leagues. A native of Cranston, Rhode Island, Cooney reached the Majors in 1917 with the Boston Red Sox, spending part of the season with them before playing with the New York Giants in . After that, he spent four years with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association, setting a personal mark with 12 consecutive hits in . Cooney came back to play once again in the Major Leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals (‚Äì), Chicago Cubs (‚Äì), Philadelphia Phillies () and Boston Braves (). His most productive season came in 1924 with St. Louis, when he hit a career-high .295 in 110 games including 20 doubles, eight triples, 57 runs batted in and 12 stolen bases, also career-numbers. In a seven-season career, Cooney was a .262 hitter (413-for-1575) with two home runs and 150 RBI in 448 games, including 64 doubles, 16 triples, and 30 stolen bases. Cooney died in Warwick, Rhode Island on August 7, 1991 at the age of 96. Triple plays While in Chicago, Cooney entered the record books as the sixth player in the modern era to turn an unassisted triple play. On May 30, 1927, in the fourth inning of a game against Pittsburgh, Cooney caught a line drive hit by Paul Waner, stepped on second base to retire Lloyd Waner, and then tagged Clyde Barnhart coming down from first base. One day after Cooney's fielding gem, Johnny Neun also turned an unassisted triple play. Despite their joint fame, Cooney and Neun never actually met, as they were playing in different leagues. (They did face each other in a minor league game in 1929, but didn't exchange words.) Finally, nearly six decades later, in 1986, Sports Illustrated arranged a conference call between the two. Cooney also had a hand in two more triple plays in his big-league career: first, he was credited with an (assisted) triple play (with Jim Bottomley and Rogers Hornsby) on July 30, 1924. Second, Cooney was called out when Glenn Wright pulled off an unassisted triple play on May 7, 1925. Oddly, it involved the same two men as the previous year's play: Cooney was on second while Hornsby was on first and Bottomley was batting.

Taxonomy  The phylogenetic position of Metaloricaria remains uncertain. Though classified in the tribe Harttiini in the subfamily Loricariinae, the length of the maxillary barbels (longer than in all other Harttiini), low number of teeth and their reduced size, reduction of the number of caudal-fin rays, and sexual dimorphism reminiscent of that seen in the Rineloricaria group, tend to support a closer relationship of Metaloricaria with the tribe Loricariini. Species There are currently two recognized species in this genus: * Metaloricaria nijsseni (Boeseman, 1976) * Metaloricaria paucidens Isbr√ºcker, 1975  Distribution and habitat  Metaloricaria is only known from the Guiana Shield in French Guiana and Suriname where the species occupy an ecological niche similar to that of Harttia. The species are rarely found in their natural environment and inhabit primarily streams over rocky and sandy substrates.  Description  Sexual dimorphism includes hypertrophied development of odontodes arranged in brushes along the sides of the head and on the spine and rays of the pectoral fins in mature males. Females also possess such brushes along sides of the head, but do not seem to develop pectoral-fin enlarged odontodes.

The song is about the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and Russia, resultant about-face consumerism and the passing of the Cold War nuclear threat. Song Like the rest of the album Roll the Bones, \\"Heresy\\" also marks the transition from the band's 1980s style to their sound of the 1990s where guitars are a prominent part of this song and keyboard and organ are played in the background. As with the vast majority of Rush songs since the album Fly by Night, Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson composed the song's music while Neil Peart wrote the lyrics. The percussion aspect of this song was noted in the Roll the Bones Tour program. Neil Peart explains, Lyrics The song speaks of the wall coming down, and the liberation of Eastern European from Communism which started in 1989 and continued through the early 1990s. While historians and journalists alike celebrated these events, Neil Peart took a different view of these monumental changes in Europe. In the Roll the Bones tour program, he asserted, The song speaks of capitalism with people who were now suddenly free buying up everything they've ever wanted to. The song concludes with the fact that all other countries that were not under the communist yoke were threatened by the possibility of nuclear war. Referring to the Cold War, the military spending, and building of nuclear bombs for that war, the song's main line was, \\"All those precious wasted years. Who will pay?\\" See also *List of Rush songs Notes Rush drummer Neil Peart discussed the topic of the end of the Cold War further in his fourth book, Roadshow: Landscape with Drums. This is one of only four songs by Rush which contains potentially offensive language: \\"All the crap we had to take\\". The other three are \\"Dog Years\\" from the album Test for Echo, in which Geddy sings \\"For every sad son of a bitch\\"; the third song is The Pass from the album Presto, containing the line \\"Christ, what have you done?\\"; and the fourth song is \\"Neurotica\\", also from Roll the Bones: \\"Snap!

The species appear to occupy the same ecological niche as those in Sturisoma. Description Sexual dimorphism and reproductive biology of Sturisomatichthys similar to Sturisoma. Sturisomatichthys is distinguished from Sturisoma primarily by the absence of a rostrum. Only one species, S. citurensis, from Panama, seems to be significantly different from all congeneric species in having an abdominal plate cover consisting of small platelets without any particular organization. Other species may represent a species complex with a short snout as in the genus Farlowella with reference to the representatives of the F. curtirostra group. The weakness of this diagnostic feature could lead to the synonymy of Sturisomatichthys with Sturisoma. Sturisomatichthys species grow to about in length.

Career  P38 had a short-lived career with the Royal Navy. Commissioned in October 1941, she was assigned to operate with the 10th Flotilla based in Malta in the Mediterranean in January 1942, under the command of Lieutenant Rowland Hemingway DSC, RN. On her first patrol she sank the Italian merchant ship Ariosto of 4,116 tons off Cape Afrika, Tunisia on 15 February 1942. 138 Allied prisoners of war aboard were lost. This was the only successful attack by P38.  Sinking  P38 left Malta on 16 February 1942, to intercept a very important large supply convoy for Axis forces off Tripoli, Libya. By 23 February, she was in position as the group of ships approached. Amongst them was the Italian torpedo boat Circe, equipped with German sonar and depth charge throwers. At 08:14 British time (10:14 Italian time), Circe reported a sonar contact at 1,800m with a submarine and that she was turning in to attack, ordering the convoy to turn to port. Shortly after 10:32 (Italian time), following a single attack in which all depth charges were dropped by Circe, P38 rose only to sink immediately again. At 10:40 (Italian time), after further attacks with depth charges and machine guns by the escorts Usodimare and Pessagno, as well as aircraft, during which one Italian rating was killed by friendly fire, P38 rose out of the water, her propellers still turning, steering planes set to surfacing, before crashing back beneath the waves at a bow-down angle of 40 degrees. A large patch of oil appeared on the surface as well as debris and human remains. P 38 was sunk in 350 metres of water in position 32 degrees 48 minutes north and 14 degrees 58 minutes east some east of Tripoli, off Cape Misuratha.

Lopes was born as Ralph Franco. His uncle, Manasseh Masseh Lopes, an MP and borough owner, was created a baronet in 1805, with a special remainder to his nephew. Ralph entered Parliament in 1814 as member for Westbury, a pocket borough controlled by his uncle, for which he initially sat until 1819. On his uncle's death in 1831 he inherited both the baronetcy and his estate, a condition of which was that he change his surname to Lopes. Included in the estate was the right to nominate the MPs at Westbury (though this did not survive the Great Reform Act of the following year), and he resumed his seat for the borough. Although he had originally sat as a Tory like his uncle, he now expressed his support for the Reform Bill and sat with the Whigs. Having been three times elected unopposed, Ralph switched his loyalties during the 1835 Parliament from the Whigs back to the Conservatives, and at the 1837 election a Whig candidate stood against him and defeated him, by the narrow margin of 98 votes to 96. However, at the next election, in 1841, Lopes was once again elected unopposed, this time as a Conservative. In 1847 he stood down in Westbury, not contesting the election, but two years later he returned to the Commons at a by-election for the Southern Devon county division. He held this seat until his death in 1854. His older son, Sir Massey Lopes, succeeded him as baronet; a younger son, Henry Lopes, 1st Baron Ludlow, served in Parliament and later as a Lord Justice of Appeal before being granted a peerage in 1897.

With this closure, the mission of the Fleet Sonar School was absorbed by other commands in the U.S. Navy's shore establishment. www.keyshistory.org References Category:United States Navy schools and training Category:Closed installations of the United States Navy ","title":"Fleet Sonar School"},{"id":"12264711","text":"James Joseph Cooney (July 9, 1865 ‚Äì July 1, 1903) was a shortstop in Major League Baseball who played from through for the Chicago Colts (1890‚Äì92) and Washington Senators (1892) of the National League.

He played professional baseball for 14 years from 1914 to 1927, including parts of five seasons in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers from 1916 to 1919 and in 1921. He appeared in 162 major league games, 123 as a pitcher, compiled a 16‚Äì25 win‚Äìloss record with a 3.13 earned run average (ERA). He also played for the Chattanooga Lookouts in 1915 and 1920 to 1927. Early years Cunningham was born in Sturgeon Lake, Minnesota, in 1894. Professional baseball Cunningham began his career in professional baseball in 1914 with Duluth White Sox of the Northern League. He appeared in 45 games for Duluth and compiled a 23‚Äì10 record. In 1915, Cunningham attended spring training with the Detroit Tigers, but was farmed out on April 2, 1915, to the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association. He appeared in 46 games for the Lookouts and compiled a 24‚Äì12 record. Despite playing for a team with a losing record, Cunningham led the Southern Association with a .667 winning percentage. On August 15, 1915, the Lookouts sold Cunningham back to the Detroit Tigers with the caveat that he need not report to Detroit until the Lookouts' season had ended. On March 29, 1916, Cunningham pitched a shutout in a spring training game with E. A. Batchelor writing that the spitball was his \\"most deadly weapon\\". Cunningham remained with the Tigers for a total of four years from 1916 to 1919, pitched in 123 games for the Tigers, including 36 as a starter, and compiled a record of 16‚Äì25 with a 3.13 earned run average (ERA) in 477 innings pitched. During the 1917 season, he ranked among the American League leaders with 44 pitching appearances (tenth) and 24 games finished (second). Cunningham was also a strong hitter for a pitcher. He had a career on-base percentage of .337 (.438 in 1919), 36 walks, 10 extra base hits and 13 RBIs. When Cunningham complained to manager Hughie Jennings about the injury-depleted Tiger outfield of 1918, Jennings had Cunningham play right field for three weeks. He appeared in 20 games as an outfielder in 1918, including 14 as the team's starting right fielder. In 1920, Cunningham returned to Chattanooga, appearing in 40 games and compiling a 19‚Äì21 record. On May 2, 1921, Cunningham returned briefly to the Tigers, appearing in one game as a right fielder without having a plate appearance. He was promptly returned to Chattanooga where he continued to play from 1921 to 1927. (confirming that Cunningham played for Chattanooga in 1921) He also played for the Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association from 1926 to 1927. Later years Cunningham died in 1972 at age 77 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

At the age of 14 he began painting, and at the age of 20 he opened his own studio in Providence, Rhode Island. He became friends with fellow artists Edward Bannister and George William Whitaker. Their meetings together resulted in the founding of the Providence Art Club on February 19, 1880. He married Charlotte Perkins in 1884. Their only child was born in 1885, they were separated in 1888, and they divorced amicably in 1894. Not long after, Stetson married Charlotte's cousin and closest friend, poet Grace Ellery Channing. After marrying Grace, Stetson moved to California, and then in 1901 they moved to Rome, Italy. Stetson died in Rome, Italy, in 1911.

The dome is in height and in diameter. It was designed by Thomas U. Walter, the fourth Architect of the Capitol, and constructed between 1855 and 1866 at a cost of $1,047,291 (equivalent to $ in ). The dome is not stone, but rather cast iron carefully painted to appear to be made of the same stone as the main capitol building. It is actually two domes, one inside the other, and the total weight is . The iron for the dome was cast by the foundry of Janes, Fowler, Kirtland & Company, owned by Adrian Janes in the Bronx, New York. The dome marks the origin on Washington, D.C. street maps. First dome The origin of the first dome began with the Capitol design contest sponsored by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, at the behest of President George Washington, in 1792. The winner of the contest, Doctor William Thornton, called for a dome in his original design for the building.. Most vividly, Thornton drew upon the Roman Pantheon for inspiration with the Neoclassical dome and associated portico.. United States Capitol with Charles Bulfinch dome, 1846Thornton's replacement, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, the second Architect of the Capitol, altered Thornton's design plan on the exterior by adding an octagonal drum to visually separate the bottom of the dome from the top of the building's pediment. The third Architect of the Capitol, Charles Bulfinch, altered the exterior profile of the plans still further by increasing the dome's height, which he later wrote was at the insistence of the President and Congress.. In 1822, Bulfinch requested funds for the construction of the center of the building, and President Monroe signed off on an appropriation of $120,000. This included the building of a double-dome structure, a stone, brick, and wooden interior dome to rise above the rotunda floor (matching the dimensions of the Pantheon), and a wooden exterior dome covered in copper that would rise to . Set at the crown of the exterior dome was an oculus wide, which provided illumination to the rotunda floor below. Bulfinch completed the project in 1823.. For more than two decades, the green copper dome of the Capitol greeted visitors to the nation's capitol, until the 1850s. Due to the growth of the United States and the expansion and addition of new states, the size of the United States Congress had grown accordingly and pushed the limits of the capacity of the Capitol. Under the guidance of the fourth Architect of the Capitol, Thomas U. Walter, extensions were built onto the north and south wings of the building. In the process, the new, longer building made the original Bulfinch dome appear aesthetically displeasing (and it had in any case been the object of much prior criticism). Congress, after lobbying by Walter and Montgomery C. Meigs (then Supervising Engineer), passed legislation to build a bigger dome in 1855. Second (current) dome 1859 cross-section drawing of the dome and supporting structure by Thomas U. Walter The current cast iron dome of the United States Capitol is the second dome to sit above the building. Plans began in May 1854 to build a new cast-iron dome for the United States Capitol, sold on the aesthetics of a new dome, as well as the utility of a fire-proof one.. Influenced by the great domes of Europe, Walter paid particular attention to the Pantheon of Paris, St Paul's Cathedral in London and St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, as well as the more recent Saint Isaac's Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, Russia, one of the first domes with an iron frame, by Auguste de Montferrand (1816‚Äì1858).The Capitol Dome, U.S. Capitol Visitor Center William Allen, Historian of the Capitol, described Walter's first design as > ... a tall, ellipsodial dome standing on a two-story drum with a ring of > forty columns forming a peristyle surrounding the lower half of the drum. > The upper part of the drum was enriched with decorated pilasters upholding a > bracketed attic. Crowning the composition was a statue standing on a > slender, columned tholus .... Walter drafted a drawing of the aforementioned design and displayed it in his office, where it drew the excited attention of members of Congress in 1854.. A year later, on March 3, 1855, President Franklin Pierce signed off on the appropriation of $100,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to build the dome.. Construction began after some practical changes to the original design (such as the reduction of the columns from 40 to 36) in September of that year with the removal of the dome raised by Charles Bulfinch. A unique scaffold was built inside the rotunda, designed to keep weight away from the weak center area of the floor, and a crane was set within to run on a steam-powered engine (fueled from the salvaged wood from the old dome).. Inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, March 4, 1861, beneath the unfinished capitol dome Over the next 11 years, the dome designed with an interior dome and exterior dome rose over the nation's capitol. By December 2, 1863, Walter was able to set the Statue of Freedom atop the dome. This was not accomplished until after Walter had been forced to revise the design of the dome to handle the statue, which had been delivered taller and heavier than requested.. Yet, the man who designed the dome did not see its total completion, because Thomas Walter resigned in 1865. His replacement, Edward Clark, assumed the role of finishing the last aspects of the dome. Just over a month later, in January 1866, Constantino Brumidi‚Äîwho had been hired to paint a fresco on a platform above the interior dome's oculus‚Äîremoved the scaffolding used during his work on the Apotheosis of Washington. This signaled the end of construction for the United States Capitol dome.. Some of iron were ultimately used in the construction that ran virtually 11 years. Inside, the interior dome rises to over the rotunda floor, and outside, the exterior dome ascends to including the height of the Statue of Freedom. The total cost of the dome was valued at $1,047,291 (equivalent to $ in ). Apotheosis of Washington Visitors standing on the balcony beneath the Apotheosis of Washington Visitation of the dome is highly restricted, usually offered only to members of Congress and their select guests. When looking up from the rotunda floor, the railing some above is barely visible. Visitors ascend a series of metal stairs between the inner and outer domes. They eventually wind their way to a balcony just underneath the Apotheosis of Washington. From this view, the painting is curved and distorted. From the balcony, metal stairs take visitors over the painting and up to the outside balcony under the tholos directly beneath the Statue of Freedom. Additional stairs lead up into the statue for maintenance. Within the columned tholus upon which stands the Statue of Freedom, is found the Session or Convene light which signifies one or both chambers being in a night session. https://www.aoc.gov/blog/capitol-illumination Restoration and conservation of the Capitol Dome's cantilevered peristyle and skirting occurred in 2012. In 2013, the Architect of the Capitol announced a tentative four-year, $10 million project to repair and conserve the Capitol dome. The project involved both interior work to the rotunda, and exterior work on the dome. The proposal would require erecting white scaffolding around the dome, stripping the paint, repairing the ironwork, repainting the dome, and installing new lighting. The work was needed because the dome, which last underwent repair and conservation in 1960, was rusting and some ironwork had fallen from the structure. Congress had appropriated no funds for the project, however. A $60-million, two-year restoration started in early 2014 included removing paint, priming and quickly repainting. Steel pins and \\"metal stitching\\" were used to repair cracks, and water damage inside was fixed. Scaffolding was erected around the dome in November 2014. The project was slated to be completed and the scaffolding removed in time for the 2017 presidential inauguration, and indeed all exterior scaffolding was removed by the end of summer 2016.

Built in 1872, it is best known for its well-preserved 1891 Victorian interior, with wood panelling and a series of booths around an island bar. It is a tied house owned by the Samuel Smith Brewery of Tadcaster, Yorkshire. About Being located near Bloomsbury, the British Museum and the University of London, it is patronised by academics. \\"I have especially fond memories of several lunchtime beer and sandwich sessions at the \\"Princess Louise\\" in Holborn\\" Building The building is protected by its Grade II* listing and has what has been described as \\"a rich example of a Victorian public house interior\\", by William B Simpson and Sons; who contracted out the work.Protz, R.(Ed.), Good Beer Guide 2006, As it is considered so historically significant even the men's toilets, with their marble urinals, are listed. The pub, which is also listed on National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors, was refurbished in 2007. The pub is unusual in that it retains its snob screens. In June 2009, the pub was joint winner of the best refurbishment class of the 2008 Pub Design Awards awarded annually by CAMRA. Author Peter Haydon included the Princess Louise in his book The Best Pubs in London and rated it No. 5 in the capital, saying it had \\"possibly the best preserved Victorian pub interior in London\\". History The pub was operated by Regent Inns from 1990 until 1998, when the lease was taken over by Samuel Smith. The Princess Louise is also notable for having been the venue for a number of influential folk clubs run by Ewan MacColl and others, which played an important part in the British folk revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s.

It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on November 15, 1998. The episode is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \\"Drive\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 11.0, being watched by 18.5 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder is trapped in a car by a seemingly deranged man, and Scully races to determine if the man is suffering from a deadly illness‚Äîand if Mulder is in danger of becoming the next victim of some sort of government conspiracy. The episode was written by Vince Gilligan, directed by Rob Bowman, and featured a guest appearance by Bryan Cranston. Gilligan cast Cranston to play the antagonist because he felt he could successfully humanize the role. Cranston's success in \\"Drive\\" later led to his casting as Walter White in Gilligan's AMC series Breaking Bad. Plot In a live news report, a high-speed car chase comes to an end in the Nevada desert. Assuming it to be a kidnapping, police pull the female passenger from the car and place her into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump (Bryan Cranston), is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman in the police car begins violently banging her head against the car window. As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a spray of blood across the window. Mulder and Scully get wind of this bizarre car chase as they're doing work in Buhl, Idaho investigating possible domestic terrorism. Mulder coerces Scully into taking a detour to Elko, Nevada on a hunch that this may be an X-File. Crump, who has started to develop symptoms of a sickness, is put in an ambulance. Mulder, wishing to speak to Crump, follows the ambulance, and ends up being kidnapped by Crump, who has escaped from the police. Mulder realizes that Crump is in a considerable amount of painful pressure and that the only way to alleviate this pressure is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of infection, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure. Initially, thinking that the FBI agent is part of a government conspiracy, Crump forces Mulder at gunpoint to drive, infuriating him along the way with antisemitic slurs. Eventually, Mulder and Crump make amends and attempt to work out a solution before it is too late. Mulder explains to Crump that Scully will meet them at the Pacific Coast, the end of the highway. There she will insert a needle into Crump's inner ear, hopefully relieving the pressure. Unfortunately, when Scully arrives, Crump has already died. Production right =Conception, writing, and filming= Vince Gilligan, the writer of \\"Drive\\", was inspired to pen the episode based on an earlier idea he had about a man holding an individual hostage on a Tilt-A-Whirl. Gilligan had pitched this idea at several previous story meetings and it soon became a recurring joke among the show's writers, many of whom felt that the premise lacked an X-Files-like mystery. Gilligan soon revised his story so that after the ride was shut off, the man's head would explode. This led to Gilligan researching various government experiments, and soon he learned about two real-life military experiments: Project HAARP and Project ELF.Meisler, p. 27 The former is an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), whereas the latter is a U.S. Navy experiment dealing with long wavelengths. Gilligan thus wrote a script that featured an individual who, due to a secret experiment involving soundwaves, could not slow down for fear of rupturing his head.Meisler, p. 28 Gilligan admitted that the episode was partially an homage to the action film Speed (1994), and contains a reference to the film: when Crump and Mulder discover that speeding west is the key to success, Mulder mentions that he thinks he \\"saw this movie.\\" The opening teaser footage is done in the style of a news report, a stylistic direction that IGN suggested was intended to echo the O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco chase from 1994. =Casting= Gilligan wanted Bryan Cranston to be the episode's antagonist because, \\"[The series] needed a guy who could be scary and kind of loathsome but at the same time had a deep, resounding humanity.\\" In an interview with The New York Times, Gilligan stated, \\"We had this villain, and we needed the audience to feel bad for him when he died. Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.\\" Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files very nearly did not cast Cranston; in fact, a different actor had already been cast when Cranston arrived to try out for the part. Despite the part having already been cast, Millikan allowed Cranston to audition and was very pleased with his performance, eventually choosing him for the part. Cranston's work on this episode would later have a major impact on his career, as it led to Gilligan casting him in the AMC series Breaking Bad. Initially, AMC executives were unsure of this decision as they were familiar only with Cranston's work on the sitcom Malcolm in the Middle. However, they were convinced after viewing his performance in \\"Drive\\". Gilligan, a fan of country musician Junior Brown, cast Brown as Virgil Nokes, the farmer who Mulder and Scully investigate at the beginning of the episode. Brown was flown in at the request and personal expense of Gilligan.Meisler, p. 29 Reception =Ratings= \\"Drive\\" first aired in the United States on November 15, 1998. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 11.0, with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 11.0 percent of all television-equipped households, and 16 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 18.50 million viewers.Meisler, p. 294 The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on March 14, 1999 and was watched by 0.70 million viewers, making it the sixth most viewed episode that week. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e March 8‚Äì14, 1999\\", listed under Sky 1 Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"He'll stop at nothing.\\" =Reviews= \\"Drive\\" received largely positive reviews from critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote positively of the episode, awarding it an A, and writing that the entry was \\"a great example of the engine that keeps great television moving.\\" Handlen noted that the climax of the episode was \\"as moving as it is suspenseful\\" and drew parallels between Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Mr. Crump and his eventual portrayal of Walter White from Breaking Bad, noting that both illustrate the idea that \\"you have to keep moving. If you stop, you die.\\" Review website IGN named it the ninth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series and complimented the interaction between Crump and Mulder, writing \\"it's the interplay between Mulder and Crump that makes this episode a standout. [...] Crump here is an antagonistic yet heartbreaking character, and as he and Mulder become unlikely allies in their 'drive,' 'Drive' in turn becomes a memorably scary X-Files episode [...] because of the perhaps most frightening element of the show's world ever: mankind itself, and the governments that supposedly protect us.\\" Colin Ellis from The Dashing Fellows called \\"Drive,\\" \\"arguably one of the best episodes post-Fight the Future of [The X-Files].\\" Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6‚Äì9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying \\"[T]hank God for 'Drive', which taps into the idea of Speed, the hit movie starring [Keanu] Reeves, but pushes it in an excitingly different direction.\\" He further went on to praise Gilligan's writing, noting that the writer took the premise of Speed and added \\"a wonderful X-Files twist\\".Kessenich, p. 15 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. Although she slightly criticized the case being investigated as \\"pure hokum\\", Vitaris praised Mulder and Scully's teamwork, and their ability to work together despite being separated. =Awards= \\"Drive\\" earned an ASC Award by the American Society of Cinematographers for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography ‚Äì Regular Series.

The Walt Disney Company's Disney Televenture subsidiary was a programming partner. No standard delivery technologies was chosen for Americast with cable, direct- broadcast satellite and microwave as options for partner companies to use. History Americast was founded in early 1996 by SBC, BellSouth, Ameritech and GTE. Southern New England Telecommunications later joined Americast in June 1996. In August 1996, Americast made an order with Zenith Electronics for $1 billion worth of digital set-top boxes. In July 1997, the company eliminated its programming and marketing departments outsourcing to Disney Televenture. By this time, Ameritech had built Americast systems in 29 locations. By 2000, the Americast system was considered to be too costly to run. Ameritech owner, SBC, put Ameritech's Americast unit up for sale in early 2000. SNET was expected to discontinue the Americast service in Connecticut in 2001. In May 2001, Ameritech's Americast unit was sold to Wide Open West, LLC.

It is usually a form of folk etymology, where the new factors may appear meaningful (e.g. hamburger taken to mean a burger with ham), or may seem to be the result of valid morphological processes. Rebracketing often focuses on highly probable word boundaries: \\"a noodle\\" might become \\"an oodle\\", since \\"an oodle\\" sounds just as grammatically correct as \\"a noodle\\", and likewise \\"an eagle\\" might become \\"a neagle\\", but \\"the bowl\\" would not become \\"th ebowl\\" and \\"a kite\\" would not become \\"ak ite\\". Technically, bracketing is the process of breaking an utterance into its constituent parts. The term is akin to parsing for larger sentences, but it is normally restricted to morphological processes at the sublexical level, i.e. within the particular word or lexeme. For example, the word uneventful is conventionally bracketed as [un+[event+ful , and the bracketing un+event]+ful] leads to completely different semantics. Re- bracketing is the process of seeing the same word as a different morphological decomposition, especially where the new etymology becomes the conventional norm. The name false splitting, also called misdivision, in particular is often reserved for the case where two words mix but still remain two words (as in the \\"noodle\\" and \\"eagle\\" examples above). The name juncture loss may be specially deployed to refer to the case of an article and a noun fusing (such as if \\"the jar\\" were to become \\"(the) thejar\\" or \\"an apple\\" were to become \\"(an) anapple\\"). Loss of juncture is especially common in the cases of loanwords and loan phrases in which the recipient language's speakers at the time of the word's introduction did not realize an article to be already present (e.g. numerous Arabic-derived words beginning 'al-' ('the'), including \\"algorithm\\", \\"alcohol\\", \\"alchemy\\", etc.). Especially in the case of loan phrases, juncture loss may be recognized as substandard even when widespread (e.g. \\"the hoi polloi\\", where Greek hoi = \\"the\\", and \\"the Magna Carta\\", in which no article is necessary because magna carta is borrowed rather than calqued, Latin's lack of articles makes the original term either implicitly definite or indeterminate with respect to definiteness [in this context, the former], and the English phrase's proper-noun status renders unnecessary any further determination through the use of an article). As a statistical change within a language within any century, rebracketing is a very weak statistical phenomenon. Even during phonetic template shifts, it is at best only probable that 0.1% of the vocabulary may be rebracketed in any given century. Rebracketing is part of the process of language change, and often operates together with sound changes that facilitate the new etymology. Rebracketing is sometimes used for jocular purposes, for example psychotherapist can be rebracketed jocularly as Psycho the rapist, and together in trouble can be rebracketed jocularly as to get her in trouble.See p. 146 in Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2003), Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew. Palgrave Macmillan. Role in forming new words Before the increased standardization of the English language in the modern period, many new words entered its lexicon in exactly the way just described. A 15th century English cook may once have said something like: \\"Ah, I found this ewt and this nadder in my napron while baking numble-pie.\\" A few generations later the cook's descendant would have said: \\"Ah, I found this newt and this adder in my apron while baking (h)umble-pie.\\" Over the course of time these words were misheard and resegmented: ewt became newt, nadder became adder, napron became apron, numble-pie became (h)umble pie. The force behind these particular resegmentations, and by far the most powerful force behind any such resegmentations in the English language, was the 'movable-n' of the indefinite article a(n), of the possessive pronouns my(n) and thy(n), and of the old dative case of the definite article the(n). The biforms no/none, the prepositions in and on, the conditional conjunction an 'even,' the shortened form 'n 'and,' and the inflectional endings in -n may also have played a part. Through the process of prothesis, in which the sound at the end of a word is transferred to the beginning of the word following, or conversely aphaeresis, in which the sound at the beginning of a word is transferred to the end of the word preceding, old words were resegmented and new words formed. So through prothesis an ewt became a newt. Conversely through aphaeresis a nadder became an adder, a napron became an apron, and a numble-pie became an (h)umble-pie. Many other words in the English language owe their existence to just this type of resegmentation: e.g., nickname, ninny, namby-pamby, nidiot/nidget, nonce- word, nother, and notch through prothesis of n; auger, umpire, orange, eyas, atomy, emony, ouch, and aitch-bone, through aphaeresis of n.For examples of resegmentation in Middle English in various phonetic environments, see Steve Reece, Junctural Metanalysis in Middle English, in Reece, Steve, Homer's Winged Words (Leiden: Brill, 2009) 15-26. Also Reece, Steve, \\"Some Homeric Etymologies in the Light of Oral-Formulaic Theory,\\" Classical World 93.2 (1999) 185-199.https://www.academia.edu/30641357/Some_Homeric_Etymologies_in_the_Light_of_Oral- Formulaic_Theory Examples * The word hamburger's origins were in a form of ground meat dish originating from Hamburg, Germany (where it is still called Tartar steak). A possible bracketing for the original may be ham+burg]+er], but after its introduction into the United States, it was soon factorized as [ham+burger] (helped by ham being a form of meat). This led to the independent suffix -burger: chickenburger, fishburger, etc. In the original etymology, burg was town and burger was a resident, or something related to the town; after refactorization it becomes a chunk of meat for a sandwich, although a hamburger does not contain ham. * The English word outrage is a loanword from French, where it was formed by combining the adverb outre (meaning \\"beyond\\") with the suffix -age; thus, the original literal meaning is \\"beyondness\\" ‚Äì that is, beyond what is acceptable. The rebracketing as a compound of out- with the noun or verb rage has led to both a different pronunciation than the one to be expected for such a loanword (compare umbrage) and an additional meaning of \\"angry reaction\\" not present in French. * The English helico‚Ä¢pter (from Greek heliko- ('turning') and pteron ('wing')) has been rebracketed to modern heli‚Ä¢copter (as in jetcopter, heliport). * cybern‚Ä¢etics: (from Greek kubernƒÅn and -ƒìtƒìs) has become modern cyber‚Ä¢netics (as in cyberspace). * prosthodontics (= false teeth) is from prosth(o)- + Greek odont-; odont- = \\"tooth\\", and prostho- arose by misdivision of \\"prosthetic\\", which was treated as supposed stem prosth- and suffix -etic, but actually came from Greek pros = \\"in front of\\" and thƒì- (the root of the verb tithƒìmi = \\"I place\\"). * The dog breed, Labrad‚Ä¢oodle (a cross between a Labrador Retriever and Poodle) has been rebracketed to Labra‚Ä¢doodle, leading to the \\"doodle\\" suffix in other Poodle crossbreeds such as the Goldendoodle and Aussiedoodle. * The word alco‚Ä¢holic derives from alcohol (itself a junctureless rebracketing of Arabic al-ku·∏•l) and ic. Words for other addictions have formed by treating holic as a suffix: workaholic, chocoholic, etc. * In Romance languages, repeated rebracketing can change an initial l to an n (first removing the l by analyzing it as the definite article l, and then adding n by rebracketing from the indefinite article un), or the reverse. Examples include:Ti Alkire, Carol Rosen (2010). Romance Languages: A Historical Introduction, p. 305.  Latin *libellu (English level) becoming nivel in Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish, and niveau in French.  Latin unicornuus (English unicorn) became licorne in French, via unicorne >> un icorne (a unicorn), and finally, with juncture loss, l'icorne (the unicorn) >> licorne. * In Swahili, kitabu (\\"book\\") is derived from Arabic kitƒÅb. However, the word is split as a native Swahili word (ki + tabu) and declined accordingly (plural vitabu). This violates the original triliteral root of the original Arabic (K-T-B). * Many words coined in a scientific context as neologisms are formed with suffixes arising from rebracketing existing terms. One example is the suffix -ol used to name alcohols, such as methanol. Its origin is the rebracketing of al‚Ä¢cohol as alcoh‚Ä¢ol. The word alcohol derives from the Arabic al-ku·∏•l, in which al is the definite article and ku·∏•l (i.e., kohl), is based on the Semitic triliteral root '. The suffix -ome as in genome, is occasionally suggested as being a rebracketing of chromo‚Ä¢some as chromos‚Ä¢ome, but see discussion at Omics asserting a derivation from other, similar coinages. * In Scottish Gaelic the definite article is pronounced run together with vowel-initial nouns without audible gap. (Compare French.) This union has provided a rich source of opportunities for rebracketing. Historically the article's various case-, number- and gender-specific forms ended in either a vowel, a nasal or an /s/, the latter later becoming an /h/ over time. Over time, the last syllable of the article was either eroded completely or weakened and partially lost, but where rebracketing had occurred, what had been the final consonant of the article came to be treated as the initial of the following noun. Example: _an inghnean_ ( < _*(s)indƒÅ inigenƒÅ_ ) gave rise to an alternative form _an ighean_ 'the girl' this in turn becoming _an nighean_. As a second, more extreme example, the Scottish Gaelic words for 'nettle' include _neanntag, eanntag, deanntag_ and even _feanntag_. In addition, many forms of the article cause grammatically-conditioned initial consonant mutation of the following noun. The original cause of this mutation in the Celtic languages was an across-the-board change of pronunciation of certain non-germinate consonants where they were either trapped between two vowels, or else between a vowel or certain other consonants. Mutation gave rise to yet more possibilities for reanalysis, the form _feanntag_ mentioned earlier possibly being one such example. Calder 'A Gaelic Grammar' (1923) has a useful list.  Examples of false splitting  = In English = As demonstrated in the examples above, the primary reason of juncture loss in English is the confusion between \\"a\\" and \\"an\\". In Medieval script, words were often written so close together that for some Middle English scholars it was hard to tell where one began and another ended. The results include the following words in English: * adder: Middle English a naddre (\\"a snake\\") taken for an addre. * aitchbone: Middle English a nachebon (\\"a buttock bone\\") taken for an hach boon. * another, formed by combining \\"an other\\" into one word, is sometimes colloquially split into \\"a nother\\" and a qualifier inserted as in \\"a whole nother issue\\". * apron: Middle English a napron taken for an apron. * auger: Middle English a nauger taken for an auger. * decoy: Most commonly thought to stem from Dutch de kooi, in which de is the definite article and kooi means cage. An alternative theory is that the Dutch compound noun eendenkooi, earlier spelled eendekooi, meaning \\"duck decoy\\", from eend \\"duck\\" + kooi, was reanalyzed and split, in the process of being transferred to English, as een dekooi, in which een is the Dutch indefinite article. * eyas: Middle English a niyas (from French niais from Late Latin nidiscus (from Latin nidus = \\"nest\\")) taken for an eias. * humble pie: Middle English a numble taken for an umble (ultimately from Latin lumbulus, this is also an example of homorganicness). * impious: originally im-pious, now pronounced in American English as though imp-ious * lone: Middle English al one (all one) taken for a-lone. * newt: Middle English an eute (cognate with eft) taken for a neute. * nickname: Middle English an eke name (\\"an additional name\\") taken for a neke name. * the nonce: Middle English, for old English √æen ƒÅnes (the one [occasion]). * nuncle (dialectal form of uncle): Middle English mine uncle taken for my nuncle. * omelette: Seventeenth-century English loanword from French, developed there via earlier forms amelette, alemette and alemelle from la lemelle (\\"the omelette\\") taken for l'alemelle; ultimately from Latin lamella (\\"blade\\"), perhaps because of the thin shape of the omelette (SOED). * ought [\\"zero\\"]: Middle English a nought (\\"a nothing\\") taken for an ought. Ultimately distinct from Old English naught (\\"nothing\\"), of complex and convergent etymology, from na (\\"not\\") and wight (\\"living thing, man\\"), but cf. aught (\\"anything\\", \\"worthy\\", etc.), itself ultimately from aye (\\"ever\\") and wight (SOED). * tother: Old English (now dialectal) that other taken for the tother. * umpire: Middle English a noumpere taken for an oumpere. = In French = In French similar confusion arose between \\"le/la\\" and \\"l'-\\" as well as \\"de\\" and \\"d'-\\". * French d√©monomancie (\\"demonomancy\\") taken for d'√©monomancie (\\"of emonomancy\\"). * Old French lonce (\\"lynx\\") taken for l'once, thus giving rise to once (hence ), now more often applied to the snow leopard. * Old French une norenge ('an orange') taken for une orenge. * boutique from Greek-derived Latin apotheca, a change found in some Romance languages (e.g. Italian bottega, Spanish bodega, Sicilian put√¨a), a putative proto-Romance l'aboteca or l'abodega taken for la + lexeme. = In Dutch = Dutch shares several examples with English, but also has some of its own. Many examples were created by reanalysing an initial n- as part of a preceding article or case ending. * adder: As in English. * arreslee (horse-drawn sleigh): From early modern Dutch een (n)arreslede, from nar \\"fool, jester\\" + slede \\"sleigh\\". * avegaar \\"auger\\": As in English. * omelet \\"omelette\\": As in English. * spijt \\"pity, regret\\": From Middle Dutch despijt, from Old French despit \\"spite\\".

Many words in the Homeric epics that are etymologically inexplicable through normal linguistic analysis begin to make some sense when junctural metanalysis at some stage in the transmission is assumed: e.g., the formula eche nedumos hypnos \\"sweet sleep held (him)\\" appears to be a resegmentation of echen edumos hypnos. Steve Reece has discovered several dozen similar instances of metanalysis in Homer, thereby shedding new light on their etymologies. Also, Reece, Steve, \\"Some Homeric Etymologies in the Light of Oral-Formulaic Theory,\\" Classical World 93.2 (1999) 185-199. Some Homeric Etymologies in the Light of Oral-Formulaic Theory Juncture loss is common in later Greek as well, especially in place names, or in borrowings of Greek names in Italian and Turkish, where particles (ŒµŒπœÇ, œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ, œÉœÑŒøŒΩ, œÉŒµ) are fused with the original name.Marek Stachowski, Robert Woodhouse, \\"The Etymology of ƒ∞stanbul: Making Optimal Use of the Evidence\\" Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia 20: 221‚Äì245 (2015) C.

The lure is cast out and retrieved in a \\"walk the dog\\" fashion (side to side or zigzag motion). It is supposed to mimic an injured fish and comes in many different fashions but the most prominent is the minnow type. Any fish that takes its prey from the water's surface would be considered a targeted species with this lure.  History The Zara Spook was first developed by the Heddon company as a wooden lure named the Zaragossa 6500 series lures. In 1939 The plastic version was introduced and following the naming of other plastic lures Heddon added spook to the name to classify it as a plastic lure. The Zara Spook 9260 Series lures contained different types of hardware throughout their production. Heddon two piece hardware were the first hardware on the 1939 catalogued Zara Spook. Later lures through the 1940s and 1950s had surface hardware. Later models contained bell hardware and moulded hangers through the 1970s. In the mid-1990s, a 4-inch long model with three hooks was introduced, and a smaller 2-inch model has also been developed for light tackle fishing. The Zara spook and spin off models are one of a few lures still marketed under the Heddon brand name by EBSCO.  References  *Luckey, Carl F. Old Fishing Lures and Tackle 6th Edition,Iola WI 2002.

Playing career Born in Evart, Michigan, Egan played three seasons as a pitcher for the Detroit Tigers (1902) and St. Louis Cardinals (1905‚Äì1906). He started 3 games for the Tigers in September 1902. Despite pitching 2 complete games with a 2.86 earned run average, Wish was 0‚Äì2 for the Tigers. In 1905, Wish was 6‚Äì15 as a starter for the Cardinals (including 19 complete games) before an arm injury ended his playing career. Scout Wish joined the Tigers organization as a scout (and occasionally as a coach) in 1910 and remained with the club for over 40 years until his death in 1951. His discoveries as a scout included Hal Newhouser, Dizzy Trout, Jim Bunning, Roy Cullenbine, Hoot Evers, Dick Wakefield, Johnny Lipon, Stubby Overmire, Art Houtteman, and Barney McCosky. And it was at his urging that the Tigers traded Barney McCosky for George Kell in 1946. Egan reportedly started scouting Hal Newhouser when Newhouser was playing Legion ball at age 15. Egan developed a reputation as a tenacious talent scout. After his death, sportswriter Francis Stann wrote in Baseball Digest: > He used to descend into mine shafts to talk to fathers of boys who couldn't > sign contracts because they were under age. He's been known to time a visit > to a youngster's home while school still was in session and wipe dishes for > the mother awaiting the boy's return. 'Parents are often underrated people,' > Wish philosophized on occasion. 'I liked 'em on my side.' In addition to his player discoveries, Wish Egan is also credited with having chosen the Tigers' spring training location in Lakeland, Florida. An article from The Sporting News in 1933 included an interview with Egan about the new training location. The article credited Egan as \\"the Tiger scout, who selected the site.\\" The article also noted: \\"Egan made many contacts in Lakeland and found the city happy over the prospect of once more being the host to a big league club.
