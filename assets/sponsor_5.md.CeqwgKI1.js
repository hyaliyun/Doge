His work reimagined and reinvented objects from everyday life, such as a set of table and chairs or stacks of plates, turning them into monumental immersive sculptures. Los Angeles-based, Therrien was described as being possessed by a sense of wonder over commonplace experiences Early Life Therrien was born in 1947 in Chicago, Illinois. He moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his family when he was around five years old. After high school, he began his formal art education in Oakland at the California College of the Arts but then moved to Southern California. In 1970, he enrolled at Brooks Institute in Santa Barbara where he received a degree in photography while also studying painting at the affiliated Santa Barbara Art Institute. He went on to earn a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles.  Career  Therrien began exhibiting in galleries in Los Angeles and New York in 1975. His first major solo museum exhibition was at Los Angeles's then-brand new Museum of Contemporary Art in 1984. He was represented Leo Castelli in New York and Konrad Fischer in D√ºsseldorf throughout the 1980s and 90s, during which time his work received increasing international recognition. He was represented by Gagosian Gallery at the time of his death. In 1991, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a presented a major survey of his work. The works during this time were described as poetically reductive sculptures and paintings of simple but evocative shapes like snowmen, keyholes and chapels. The artist has said he has always been interested in \\"subjects with fables attached.\\" The objects he chose to recreate not only had to be beautiful to his eyes but they had to have a \\"universal\\" shape that is recognizable to everyone. Therrien's work underwent a shift in emphasis in the early 1990s, his sculptures becoming larger in scale and more clearly representational. He moved from making modestly sized handmade objects to industrially fabricated, large-scale immersive works. Around this time the artist said that \\"...as (my work) becomes less and less abstract in appearance‚Äî its shape more obviously derived from common objects‚Äî it also gets more thickly surrounded by abstractions, in the sense of associations or ideas it may refer to.\\" The artist's solo exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2000 examined the work at what proved to be a crucial moment in his career. The show featured monumental new sculptures, including Under the Table, 1994, No title (blue plastic plates), 1999, and three gigantic beards. \\"Therrien's recent work is at once playful and dark,\\" critic Christopher Knight proclaimed in his review of the LACMA show. \\"Therrien has been making exquisitely crafted sculptures that are easily recognized as objects encountered in the daily world. Yet, however recognizable the object, the sense of estrangement in these new sculptures is more pronounced than ever before.\\"  Selected Museum Exhibitions  * Public Art Fund, New York, Robert Therrien: Table and Six Chairs, 2005 * Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, California, Robert Therrien, 2007 * Kunstmuseum Basel, Switzerland, Robert Therrien: Works on Paper, 2008 * Tate Modern, London, ARTIST ROOMS: Robert Therrien, 2009-2010 * De Pont museum, Tilburg, Netherlands, Robert Therrien: Sculptures and drawings, 2011 * The MAC (Metropolitan Arts Centre), Belfast, Ireland, Robert Therrien: No title (table and four chairs), 2012 * The Contemporary Austin, Texas, Robert Therrien, 2015 * Denver Art Museum, Colorado, Robert Therrien: The Power of the Image, 2016 * Parasol unit, London, Robert Therrien: Works 1975-1995, 2016 * Tate Modern, London, ARTIST ROOMS: Robert Therrien, 2018 Therrien died on June 17, 2019, at the age of 71.

History Prior to the founding of the college in 2003, there were no facilities available in Ghana to train specialist doctors. Doctors who required training in specific fields had to do so outside the country through the West African College of Physicians and the West African College of Surgeons which were both located in Nigeria. Others sought training in other areas such as South Africa, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. This resulted in a high attrition rate especially in the case of medical practitioners that trained abroad on scholarships as many did not return to practise in the country. In an effort to curb the situation of brain-drain in the country, the Ghana Medical Association, health professionals, Ministers of health and various stakeholders in the country's health sector pushed for the establishment of a post graduate medical college in the country in the year 2000. A task force chaired by Professor George W. Brobby was set up in 2000 to make recommendations for the establishment of the National Postgraduate Medical College. An acting rector of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in the name of Paul K. Nyame was appointed in 2001 to establish a secretariat for the college. The college was inaugurated in 9 December 2003 by the then President John Agyekum Kufuor with Professor Samuel Ofosu-Amaah as the first President and Chairman of Council, Professor Paul K. Nyame as the Rector and Prof George W. Brobby as Vice-Rector of the college. The college started with an initial intake of sixty-four students.GNA,\\"Complex for College of Physicians, Surgeons\\", Ghanaweb, 28 November 2007. In September 2004, the first batch of residents were enrolled into the college. They graduated in September 2007. They were inducted as members of the Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons in December 2007.Rosemary Ardayfio,\\"Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons marks 15th Anniversary\\", Graphic Online, 10 December 2018. Programs The college has the mandate to organise training programmes, conduct exams, award certificates, influence health policy and undertake Continuous Professional Development (CPD). The College has 15 Faculties. Doctors who enroll in the college are run through a three-year membership program which qualifies them as specialists. They then study for two or three additional years depending on their specialty. Programs available for membership and fellowship for physicians include; Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Laboratory Medicine, Paediatrics and Child Health, Psychiatry, Public Health, Radiology, Oncology Radiation. For surgeons the programs are as follows; Anaesthesia, Paediatrics/Child Health, Dental Surgery and Subspecialties, Emergency Medicine, Otorhinolaryngology, Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Ophthalmology, Surgery and Subspecialties. The college also organises a modular membership programme in family medicine: accredited district hospitals are used as training centres to help train district doctors in family medicine. Training centres and sites The college uses various training centres to train specialists. Some of these include; the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, the Tamale Teaching Hospital, the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, the 37 Military Hospital, the Tetteh Quarshie Memorial Hospital, the Greater Accra Regional Hospital, the Accra Psychiatric Hospital and the Brong Ahafo Regional Hospital. The college also has training sites at the Princess Marie Louis Children's Hospital, the Koforidua Regional Hospital, the La General Hospital and the Volta River Authority (VRA) Hospital. The college has also accredited private specialist facilities to train its doctors in an attempt to expand its program. These facilities include; FOCUS Hospital, Nyaho Medical Centre, Lister Hospital and the Tema Women's Hospital. External connections The college fosters relationships with other like institutions for mutual support and benefits. The college has forged linkages with University of Michigan, United States of America. The university supports the college with the development of new programmes to suit the nation's needs. The college is also linked with the Ghana Physicians and Surgeons Foundation in North America; an association of Ghanaians practising in North America. These doctors assist the college with expertise and funding for the external rotation of residents of the College. The college is also linked with the Ghana Doctors and Dentists Association in the United Kingdom. The purpose of this relationship is to enrich the college's programmes by tapping into the knowledge of the doctors of the association while using their members as resource persons and trainers at the college.

Particularly, in the case of railway systems, his results are used for solving wheel-rail contact problems and railway dynamics. The linear elastic coefficients defined in his theory are known as the Kalker Coefficients.  Biography  Joost J. Kalker was born in a Jewish family. Joost J. Kalker and his family were persecuted during the German occupation of The Netherlands in World War II.  Professional work  His PhD dissertation of 1967 was entitled: ‚ÄúOn the rolling contact of two elastic bodies in the presence of dry friction‚Äù. In his thesis, Kalker proposed the mechanics behind frictional rolling with arbitrary lateral and longitudinal creep and spin. His basic assumption was to divide the contact patch between the two elastic bodies into two areas: adhesion area and sliding area. His theory made possible to calculate both creep forces and spin moment for rolling contact problems. His theory was first confirmed via experimental tests of creep forces conducted in England and Germany. In 1979, Kalker was appointed full professor at Delft University of Technology in applied mathematics. Kalker created two software with his theory: CONTACT and FASTSIM. He was member of the editorial board of the Journal Vehicle System Dynamics. Joost J. Kalker was advisor of six PhD researches: Max Viergever (1980), Francois van Geer (1987), Juergen Jaeger (1992), Gerard Braat (1993), Fr√©d√©ric Jacques P√©riard (1998) and Zili Li (2002).

Individual characters =Sigmund Ausfaller= Sigmund Ausfaller, a native of Earth, is a member of the Amalgamated Regional Militia (\\"ARM\\"), working in the Bureau of Alien Affairs on Earth. To protect puppeteer (and Earth) interests, in \\"Neutron Star\\" Ausfaller plants a bomb in the lifesystem of Shaeffer's ship, the Skydiver, so that Shaeffer will not attempt to steal it. Years later, in The Borderlands of Sol, when Shaeffer encounters him on Jinx, he offers Shaeffer and Carlos Wu a ride home to Earth on his ship, Hobo Kelly, in hopes of attracting the attention of whoever or whatever was causing ships to disappear when entering or leaving Sol system. Some years later, Ausfaller, having almost caught up with Shaeffer on Fafnir, is killed by Ander Smittarasheed in order to protect Smittarasheed's interest in the special nanotechnology autodoc developed by Carlos Wu, left on Fafnir when Carlos escaped from Feather Filip as she shot Shaeffer in the chest with an ARM punchgun. He is later \\"resurrected\\" by Wu's Autodoc and taken to one of the Puppeteer farming worlds by Nessus. Ausfaller appears in the Beowulf Shaeffer stories \\"Neutron Star\\", The Borderland of Sol, and \\"Ghost\\", and is mentioned in the story \\"Procrustes\\". He also appears in the non-Shaeffer novel Fleet of Worlds and is the main human character in its sequels Juggler of Worlds and Destroyer of Worlds. =Larchmont Bellamy= Larchmont \\"Larch\\" Bellamy, a native of Earth, is a wealthy human who owns the ship Drunkard‚Äôs Walk. A lean man with a lean face, a sharp-edged nose, prominent cheekbones and dark, deep-set eyes with shaggy black eyebrows, Bellamy is in prime condition. He is 300 years old and takes boosterspice, although he was born before that drug became available; initially, like all humans before boosterspice, he relied on the organ banks to keep him healthy. An outgoing, interesting man, Bellamy talks well; he tells old jokes but does it well, and he has some new ones, too. While not xenophobic, Bellamy tends to not think of aliens as people; Shaeffer remembers that he had said they should wipe out the Kzinti for good and all. Bellamy is the leader of a hunting party visiting Gummidgy when the Kdatlyno touch-sculptor Lloobee is kidnapped. When Shaeffer discovers that Bellamy is part of the kidnap plot, he and Emil Horne are captured by the kidnappers who intend to stage their deaths as an accident. Lloobee creates a diversion, allowing Shaeffer to escape, and Bellamy pursues him. Shaeffer rams Bellamy's ship with his aircar, forcing Bellamy to land, but neither Shaeffer nor Bellamy notice that the front landing leg of his ship fails to deploy, leaving the ship balancing with its gyros alone. When Bellamy tries to save his ship, it flips end-for-end, throwing him into the air to his death. Bellamy probably had a romantic relationship with fellow kidnapper Tanya Wilson; Margo Tellefsen told Shaeffer that she might attempt to kill him in revenge for Bellamy's death. Shaeffer characterized Bellamy as a person who could tolerate aliens but who didn't like them much. He also wondered if Bellamy's age was a factor in his decision to kidnap Lloobee; when a person lives for hundreds of years and their politics and morals change over time, Shaeffer wondered, did they become indifferent to the idea of morality? Bellamy appears in the Beowulf Shaeffer story \\"Grendel\\". =Teela Brown= Teela Brown was a member of the crew recruited by Puppeteer Nessus for an expedition to the Ringworld. Her sole qualification was that she was descended from \\"lucky\\" ancestors, six generations of whom were born as a result of winning Earth's Birthright Lottery. The consequence of her state was that she'd led such a charmed and worry-free life that she was emotionally immature and unprepared for \\"harsh reality.\\" The Puppeteer saw this as a kind of artificial selection, tending to breed for a psionic power of good luck. He hoped Teela would bring luck and success to the entire expedition. Teela is a descendant of a former lover of Louis Wu. Her age in Ringworld is given as twenty, though there are conflicting data in later books. She joins the Ringworld expedition, and eventually becomes separated from the group. She meets a Ringworld native called \\"Seeker,\\" and decides to remain with him on the Ringworld while the remainder of the crew returns to human space. In The Ringworld Engineers, when a second expedition returns to the Ringworld, it is revealed that Teela has become a Protector-stage human. Her new instincts force her to protect the Ringworld population. When she realizes those instincts are driving her toward an unacceptable choice, she manipulates the other characters into killing her. Further details of her life become sketchy as the Ringworld story continues through three more novels. Her story is the subject of guesswork and deduction by the other characters, and subject to inconsistent retconning among the works. The influence of her luck is a significant factor in several parts of the narrative. According to the story in Ringworld (expanded in the Known Space novel Juggler of Worlds), the Puppeteers intervened with human reproduction beginning several generations in the past, with the intention of breeding humans for luck. This would be possible because they believed luck to be an inheritable psionic ability. They suspected such an ability was latent in humans already, having come to regard humanity as an unusually lucky species. The plan worked by manipulating the reproductive laws of Earth. To stem overcrowding, the planet had strict birth control laws, limiting the number of children each person could have. The Puppeteers caused the further adoption of a Birthright Lottery, whereby any person could win the opportunity to reproduce more often. Since reproduction could be affected by pure chance, luckier people would have more children, who would inherit that luck. Therefore, the power of luck should become stronger and more widespread in each generation. In Ringworld's Children we learn that Teela Brown and Seeker had a child, who remained on the Ringworld after the end of the Fringe War. Louis speculates that Teela's luck might work for the survival of her genes, rather than Teela herself. The existence and nature of Teela's luck is debated back and forth by the characters throughout the four- book series. For most of the first book, Louis believes her to be only a statistical fluke. That is, he believes that Nessus only picked a person who had been lucky in her life so far, not one who actually causes luck to happen. But by the end of the series Louis says he believes the luck is real, because he sees no other explanation for the appalling coincidences that have swirled around her life. Niven has described the problems that such a character and such a trait pose to his story and to his fictional universe. He calls it \\"Author Control\\" to illustrate the plot and story limitations it imposes on the creative process. The story \\"Safe at Any Speed\\" is set in a time when the Teela Gene is more common among humans. Niven says there will not be more stories from this time: \\"Stories about infinitely lucky people tend to be dull.\\"Introduction to \\"Safe at Any Speed\\" as published in Tales of Known Space (Del Rey Books 1975) This indicates that the author felt constrained to develop story lines around Teela consistent with the view that luck is genetic and inheritable‚Äîany hardship inflicted upon Teela which appears unlucky on first glance must thereafter be revealed as concealing a silver lining of greater import in order to maintain indeterminacy, at the expense of dissipating plot tension (Teela was never in any danger really)‚Äîregardless of the views expressed by various characters within the narrative. Teela can also be viewed as a lampshade trope, by bending narrativium to function as a plot device (\\"a hero will always win when outnumbered, since million-to-one chances are dramatic enough to crop up nine times out of ten\\"). =Gil Hamilton= Gilbert Gilgamesh Hamilton is one of the few science fiction detectives to appear in the genre. He is often called \\"Gil the Arm\\", both due to his affiliation with the ARM world police force, and his unusual psychic ability. Born in Topeka, Kansas, to flatlander parents near the end of the 21st century (it is established he was born in the month of April, but 2086, 2091, 2093, and 2097 are all given as years in various stories), he emigrates to the Belt as soon as he becomes an adult. There he begins work on an arduous ten-year apprenticeship towards the acquisition of his singleship licence. During this time he works as a member of small multi-person crews. After completing several successful trips, Gil loses his right arm. While attempting to move an asteroid with explosives, crew leader \\"Cubes\\" Forsythe miscalculates, which results in the destruction of the valuable rock. A fast moving piece of shrapnel penetrates the ship, slicing off Gil's arm and killing Forsythe instantly. The remaining crewmember, Owen Jennison, quickly seals the hull breach, stops Gil's bleeding, and manages to get him to life-saving medical facilities in time. While recuperating from his injury, Gil broods over his future as a Belter. Their ship is missing a crew member, Gil is missing an arm, and Owen's reputation is ruined because he took (what Belters consider) unacceptable risks to get Gil back to safety. In the low gravity of Ceres base, Gil discovers that he has a psi power. His brain, still remembering the \\"image\\" of his lost arm, can use it much as he did his own arm. He can feel and manipulate objects via ESP and telekinesis, respectively. Finding a third crewman, Homer Chandrasekhar, they make several highly profitable trips over the following year. Gil finds his \\"imaginary arm\\", though not strong, to be an asset, as he can reach through walls, and accomplish tasks beyond the ability of a normal person. After six months, Gil has earned enough to repay all his medical fees, with a comfortable cash reserve left over. Despite much disapproval from Owen and Homer, Gil decides to return to Earth and seek to get his citizenship back. On Earth, he can easily get a transplant to replace his missing arm. In the Belt he would have to pay exorbitantly high fees for a transplant, or settle for a prosthetic. Gil, by a quirk of his own nature, can not live with a prosthetic. Gil receives his new arm, but finds he can still dissociate his imaginary arm from his real one, and reach through walls, flesh, and even vidphone screens to manipulate objects he sees in them. Shortly afterward, Gil finds out that his new arm had not come from a condemned criminal as he had hoped, but from the captured stock of \\"organleggers\\", black market dealers in illicit organ transplants. To make amends, Gil joins the ARM, the elite global police force. As an ARM, Hamilton is a high-tech detective, who hunts organleggers and other criminals for a living. With his unusual psi power, he is formidable and highly feared among his enemies. His exploits are detailed in five \\"Gil 'the Arm' Hamilton\\" stories. The stories are noir style, told in first person, and frequently involve exotic technology and locked room mysteries: * \\"Death by Ecstasy\\" (1968) * \\"The Defenseless Dead\\" (1973) * \\"ARM\\" (1975): Hamilton is called to the scene of a murder. The victim is Dr. Raymond Sinclair, a brilliant scientist who has invented a mysterious device that creates a bubble of accelerated time. The murder scene is a locked apartment at the top of a high- rise, where the prime suspect is a beautiful young woman whom Gil refuses to believe is the killer. * The Patchwork Girl (1980) * The Woman in Del Rey Crater (1995) The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton (1976) contains the first three novellas. Flatlander (1995) () is a collection of all five Gil Hamilton novellas and novels. =Emil Horne= Emil Horne, a native of Jinx, is a top- flight computer programmer. He meets Shaeffer on a trip from Down to Gummidgy and they struck up a quick friendship. Horne is short and strongly built like most natives of Jinx, a high-gravity world. His ability to ask the right questions when programming complex problems also helps him deduce the probable identities of the kidnappers when the Kdatlyno touch sculptor Lloobee is kidnapped from the Argos as it was about to enter Gummidgy system. Despite Shaeffer's caution and some misleading comments that led Horne to believe he was wrong about Larchmont Bellamy and his crew being the kidnappers (Horne wasn't wrong but Shaeffer didn't want him running in with stun-guns blazing), they are taken prisoner when they attempt to infiltrate the location where Lloobee is being held, a cave created with a Slaver disintegrater tool, which Horne locates by having Shaeffer fly high above the ground to see the dust created by the tool. When he attempts to enter the cave, however, a stun-gun set in the \\"on\\" position a facing the door renders Horne unconscious. He is returned along with Lloobee after Shaeffer escapes from the kidnappers with Lloobee's help. Emil Horne appears in the Beowulf Shaeffer story \\"Grendel\\" and is mentioned in the story The Borderland of Sol. =Sharrol Janss= Sharrol Janss, a native of Earth, is Shaeffer's wife and the mother of their daughter, Jeena and another child, name unknown, whom she was pregnant with when Shaeffer encountered Ander Smittarasheed on Fafnir in 2655. Sharrol first met Beowulf Shaeffer on Earth when she picked his pocket, and was later formally introduced to him by Dianna and Elephant as a fourth for bridge. Sharrol also has two children by Carlos Wu, Tanya and Louis, as part of an arrangement between the three so that Bey and Sharrol could raise children together on Earth. Sharrol suffers from Flatland Phobia, a fear of changes to a person's environment, gravity, etc. which makes them psychologically unable to bear space travel or being away from Earth. She was employed at the time she met Shaeffer as a computer analyst for Donovan's Brains, Inc. She had been previously employed by the Epcot-Atlanta police. During her childhood her father ran a lobster ranch in Boston. She was able to travel to Fafnir asleep inside Carlo Wu's special autodoc and later was frozen for travel to Home when Ander Smittarasheed located Bey on Fafnir. Sharrol Janss appears in the stories Flatlander, Procrustes and Ghost, and is mentioned in the stories Grendel and The Borderland of Sol. =Alice Jordan= Alice Jordan is a Belter and a Goldskin, a member of the Belt Police in the mid-twenty-fourth century. Together with flatlander Roy Truesdale, they set out for the Kuiper Belt in search of Jack Brennan, a human turned Protector who has been abducting humans for study. In Destroyer of Worlds (by Niven and Edward M. Lerner), Alice is found in a stasis field in a singleship by Outsiders. They sell the singleship containing her to Sigmund Ausfaller who releases her from stasis. Ausfaller deduces that Brennan put Alice in stasis and sent her far from the danger described in Protector because she is pregnant with his descendant. Alice later becomes involved with Louis Wu, in (by the same authorial team) Betrayer of Worlds and Fate of Worlds. =Nessus= Nessus is a member of the technologically advanced alien race known to Humans as Pierson's Puppeteer, and amongst themselves as Citizens. Nessus, like almost all Puppeteers ever met by humans, is insane by Puppeteer standards. Sane Puppeteers are far too cautious (cowardly from the human perspective) to go off-world or interact with non-Puppeteers, thus only insane individuals like Nessus can manage to act as business liaisons or ambassadors to other species, as he does with humans and others. Nessus demonstrates traits that in humans would be diagnosed as manic-depressive disorder, displacement, and at times, extreme suggestibility. His interactions with humans cause him to be one of the few Puppeteers to ever show any support for Human interests as coequal to Puppeteer interests. He is also directly responsible for the presence of Sigmund Ausfaller on New Terra Nessus is featured in the short story \\"The Soft Weapon\\" (printed in the 1968 collection Neutron Star) and is one of the expeditionaries to the Ringworld in the 1970 book of the same name. Nessus is also a central character of the Fleet of Worlds series of Ringworld companion novels (Fleet of Worlds, Juggler of Worlds, Destroyer of Worlds, Betrayer of Worlds, and Fate of Worlds), which opens about 200 years before Ringworld and ends following Ringworld's Children. =Peter Nordbo= Peter Nordbo is an astronomer and noble on Wunderland, and during the First Man-Kzin War, was pressed into service for the Kzin following their occupation of the world. At the height of the occupation, he discovered a source of bizarre radiation on a world many lightyears away, and was taken to investigate by the scientifically minded Kzin who oversaw him. During the flight, forces under Buford Early and Ulf Reichstein Markham liberated Wunderland, and Nordbo was convicted of collaboration and stripped of all of his possessions. In order to secure his release and clear his name, his daughter Tyra secured the help of Robert Saxtorph and his ship to investigate. They found that Peter had discovered a remnant of the Tnuctipun, a black hole powered hyperdrive that could also be used as a powerful Hawking radiation beam weapon. Peter had freed himself from the Kzinti and was reunited with Tyra, and after the weapon was destroyed by the Kzin, returned to Wunderland to free his name. =Gregory Pelton= Gregory Pelton, (aka \\"Elephant\\" for a certain anatomical resemblance to a feature of the large Earth land animal), a native of Earth, is probably the richest human alive. His great-to-the-eighth grandmother invented the transfer booth. It is rumored that he actually owns known space, and gets income from renting it out, and that General Products Corporation is actually a front for him. Pelton lives in a house on the side of a cliff in the Rocky Mountains on Earth, and having spent a lot of time in space resents being called a flatlander. Pelton is of average height but strongly built, looking not so much overweight as solid. Most humans in this period of time on Earth are in excellent health, with autodocs to maintain their bodies and boosterspice to prevent aging; Pelton presumably uses both. Pelton and Shaeffer's personalities tend to complement each other, and they quickly made friends when Shaeffer first encountered him aboard the Lensman, bound for Earth from Jinx after Shaeffer's fateful trip to the core of the Milky Way galaxy. Pelton can be cordial and pleasant but also very direct and blunt when it suits him. He is patient but his patience has limits, and while he is as cautious as anyone he can sometimes act without thinking, a trait that would have gotten him killed if Shaeffer had not talked him out of landing on the protosun's planet when they visited it in 2645, as the planet, named \\"Cannonball Express\\" by Pelton and Shaeffer, was composed of antimatter, which would have destroyed even Pelton's General Products-hulled ship, the Slower Than Infinity. Indeed, the hull eventually disintegrated due to annihilations by antimatter particles but Pelton and Shaeffer were able to escape and managed to return to Jinx. After Shaeffer and Pelton returned from Cannonball Express Pelton made plans to return but when government agencies became involved the plan bogged down in details. Ander Smittarasheed told Shaeffer that as of 2655 it was unclear whether Pelton was still involved in the project at all. Shaeffer and Pelton still maintained contact after the trip to Cannonball Express; when Shaeffer secretly emigrated to Fafnir with Sharrol, their children, and Carlos Wu and Feather Filip, Elephant gave him the money he received from General Products Corporation for the indemnity on his General Products hull, destroyed by exposure to antimatter particles from the Fast Protosun's solar wind; the money was deposited on accounts in Fafnir and Home, where the group planned to emigrate to, using assumed identities, after secretly arriving on Fafnir. Gregory Pelton appears in the Beowulf Shaeffer story Flatlander and was mentioned in the stories Grendel, The Borderland of Sol and Ghost. In Juggler of Worlds, Pelton is powerful enough to control the SecGen of the fictional UN, and becomes a wanted criminal on the run, the authors' way of explaining why he never returns to the Known Space universe. =Regional President of We Made It= This Pierson's Puppeteer, a native of the Fleet-of-Worlds working for General Products in Known Space, contracted with Shaeffer to pilot a spaceship in a close fly-by of newly discovered neutron star BVS-1 to discover what killed the first two explorers to make the attempt, Peter and Sonya Laskin. After Shaeffer's return from BVS-1, the puppeteer also agreed to pay Shaeffer one million stars in return for his silence concerning whether the puppeteer homeworld had a moon. The Regional President of We Made It appears in the Beowulf Shaeffer story Neutron Star. =Regional President of Jinx= This puppeteer (called \\"Honey\\" by an overly tired Shaeffer at one point, due to his female-sounding voice), also worked for General Products. He contracted with Shaeffer to pilot a Quantum II hyperdrive ship (named Long Shot by Shaeffer) to the core of the Milky Way galaxy, where Shaeffer discovers the core explosion. The Regional President of Jinx appears in the Beowulf Shaeffer story At the Core. =Ulf Reichstein-Markham= Ulf Reichstein-Markham was born on Wunderland in 2390, the son of a solar system Belter. Following the occupation of Wunderland by the Kzinti in the First Man-Kzin War, at the age of 18 he joined the \\"Free Wunderland Navy,\\" what purported to be a resistance group but was little more than a band of space pirates occupying the Serpent Swarm (Alpha Centauri's asteroid belt). He was responsible for the capture of the United Nations spaceship Catskinner, whose crew later were responsible for the assassination of Chuut-Riit. He also came under the control of a Thrint who escaped its Slaver stasis field before being destroyed by the Catskinner AI. By the time Wunderland was liberated in 2420, Reichstein-Markham had become an admiral, and then was chosen to be Minister of War for the free Wunderlander government. He finally died in the year 2443 after being selected to chair the Interworld Commission, an early form of pan-human government established after the peace treaty with the Kzin was signed. Prior to his death, he had used his position to give the secret of hyperdrive to the Kzin disguised as a diplomatic packet, in the hopes of creating a lasting peace of equality between the two races. Although he did not live to see it, Reichstein-Markham's treachery meant that, far from his intentions, the Kzin would grow strong enough to launch four additional wars of conquest against the human worlds. =Beowulf Shaeffer= =Lit Shaeffer= Charles Martin Shaeffer is nicknamed \\"Little\\" Shaeffer and is known to most of his friends simply as \\"Lit\\". A Belter, born in the late 21st century, he is First Speaker for the Belt Political Section when Kzanol the thrint is revived from stasis in the early 22nd century. He is friends with Lucas Garner and has visited with him at least once on Farmer's Asteroid, one of the Belt Bubbleworlds. Lit's nickname comes from the fact that he spent a good deal of time in low and zero-g during his body's growth period, and is now unusually tall. The Shaeffer family is very active in Belt politics, and are likely ancestors of Beowulf Shaeffer, but this is never established definitively. Lit Shaeffer is featured in the novels World of Ptavvs, Protector and in the short story At the Bottom of a Hole. =Ander Smittarasheed= Ander Smittarasheed, a native of Earth, was hired by Shaeffer to ghostwrite his neutron star story and again four years later to write his galactic core story. Athletic and well-built, easily able to have any woman for the asking, Ander tends to dress in wild flatlander style even when offworld. He has a square face, thin blond hair and a solid-looking jaw that Shaeffer compared to a prey turtle's. Ander presents himself as cool yet affable, but manages to come off (at least to Shaeffer) as being smug. When Shaeffer advertised for a ghostwriter after his neutron star episode Ander answered and managed to push himself into the situation before Shaeffer's guard was completely up. He was a very competent writer, which surprised Shaeffer, and the neutron star recording sold well, as did the core piece they did together four years later. That was the last Shaeffer saw of Ander until he appeared on Fafnir ten years later, looking for him. Smittarasheed is in the employ of Sigmund Ausfaller, an ARM and agent for the Bureau of Alien Affairs. Ander was tasked with finding Shaeffer and questioning him about the threat level of certain alien races, notably the puppeteers. This may have been done to delay Shaeffer until Ausfaller could arrive and take him into custody, but Ander did not have time to contact Ausfaller until after his initial interview with the crashlander. However, when Shaeffer offers to sell Ander the location of Carlos Wu's nanotech autodoc, Ander understands the impact of such technology (evidenced by Shaeffer's altered appearance) and is interested in spite of himself. The lure of Carlos Wu's special autodoc proves too tempting for Smittarasheed. When Ausfaller appears to take Shaeffer into custody, along with local money (probably for bribing local officials; he never intended to give it to Shaeffer), Smittarasheed kills him with the ARM punchgun left in Shaeffer's hotel room by Sharrol and taken by Ander and offers to split the money with Shaeffer for the location of Carlos's autodoc. Shaeffer agrees but leaves Fafnir without the money, knowing that the Fafnir police can link the punchgun to another crime, a survival jacket with a ragged hole through it, made by the same weapon. With Ander holding the weapon, he would be linked to that death as well as Ausfaller's. And Smittarasheed did not reckon, Shaeffer knew, on just how many Fafnir police were Kzinti who had elected to stay on that world when it was acquired by Earth in the Fourth Man-Kzin War. Smittarasheed's final fate is revealed in ‚ÄúJuggler of Worlds‚Äù, where Ander is killed in a firefight with Kzniti Fafnir police. Ander Smittarasheed appears in the framing story Ghost. =Nick Sohl= Nicholas Brewster Sohl is a Belter, born in the mid 21st century, he is First Speaker for the Belt Political Section when Phssthpok the Pak Protector arrives in the Solar System in the early 22nd century. Together with Lucas Garner they track Phssthpok and Jack Brennan to Mars, where they find Brennan has become a protector himself (and has killed Phssthpok). =Speaker-to-Animals= Speaker-to-Animals (or later Chmeee) is a junior diplomat who is trained to deal with other species without reflexively killing them. He is recruited by Nessus, a Pierson's Puppeteer, as a member of an expedition to explore the Ringworld. Speaker is a Kzin, a member of an extraterrestrial race of large tiger-like beings. He is a trained diplomat posted to the United Nations. His title (in place of a name he has yet to earn) is a polite reference to how Kzinti refer to non-Kzin races. Following their return to Known Space, he is given the name of \\"Chmeee\\" (the \\"ch\\" is pronounced like a guttural German \\"ch\\", as in \\"ach\\") and given breeding rights by the Kzinti Patriarch. In the sequel The Ringworld Engineers Chmeee, along with Louis Wu, is kidnapped by the Hindmost (the exiled leader of the Puppeteers). The Hindmost wants Louis and Chmeee to uncover the secret behind the creation of the Ringworld. Chmeee appears briefly in The Ringworld Throne and Ringworld's Children. His son, Acolyte, is a supporting character in these novels. As a member of the Kzin species, Speaker-to-Animals is extremely dangerous and always ready to fight despite the fact that he is a diplomat. He was the one that caused the most damage to the Ringworld village of Zignamuclikclik and were he not a part of the Docile Kzinti project, he probably would have leveled the village to the ground. He is also responsible for the expedition's safety on Ringworld and therefore is in charge most of the time. Chmeee is approximately tall and weighs . He, like all kzinti, is covered with a thick coat of long fur that comes in various combinations of orange, yellow, and black. His face has black fur across the eyes resembling a bandit's mask, or the facial markings of a raccoon. His tail is naked and similar in appearance to a rat's tail. Kzinti ears are hairless, pink, and shaped liked a segment of a Chinese parasol (or cocktail umbrella); they can fold back flat against the head for protection during a fight. Chmeee was badly burned during Ringworld; and as a result, his body was covered with scars. After involuntarily receiving an injection of the Kzinti analog of boosterspice, his scarring gradually disappeared. However, he acquired new scars after a fight with a Pak protector in The Ringworld Engineers. =Margo Tellefsen= Margo Tellefsen, a native of Earth, is the captain of the Argos, bound for Gummidgy, when it is boarded and one of its passengers is kidnapped. She is slim and lovely with long, dark hair that she wore in a \\"free fall\\" effect. She has green eyes. Shaeffer considered her lovely enough (by flatlander standards) to make a fast fortune on tridee if she wanted to. Shaeffer believes that Margo is in collusion with the kidnappers, which she confirms when Shaeffer confronts this after his escape. Margo revealed that she is Bellamy's mother and therefore well over 300 years old. Shaeffer, intrigued by her request for him to stay with her for two years while Sharrol and Carlos Wu are having children for Bey and Sharrol to raise on Earth, agrees to stay with her during that time. Margo Tellefsen appears in the Beowulf Shaeffer story Grendel. =Tanya Wilson= Tanya Wilson, a native of Earth, is a companion of Larch Bellamy and one of the four people who kidnapped the Kdatlyno touch sculptor Lloobee from the spaceship Argos. Shaeffer met her when he arrived at Elephant's house during lush-hour one day. She is about 300 years old. Details on her physical appearance are sparse. She has a voice that is rich and fruity, according to Shaeffer, with a flatlander accent that doesn't ring quite true and is probably displaced in time. When Emil attempted to storm the cave where Lloobee was being held, he stunned Wilson before being stunned himself. After Shaeffer was captured she returned to the campsite, the cover story for her injury was that she was scratched by one of the native species of Gummidgy. After Bellamy was dead, Margo Tellefsen, who was Bellamy's mother, warned Shaeffer that Tanya Wilson had been in love with her son and would probably try to kill him. Tanya Wilson appears in the Beowulf Shaeffer story Grendel. =Carlos Wu= Carlos Wu, a native of Earth, is one of only about 120 people with an unlimited parenthood license due to his incredible genius and resistance to disease and injury. His intelligence allowed him to solve the Sealeyham Limits Problem, and to design a new autodoc based on nanotechnology. Along with being a genius mathematician, he is also a playwright and composer. Wu is an easygoing and pleasant fellow, although he broods over feeling trapped by the ARM keeping constant track of his whereabouts and activities. He is reluctant to disclose his thoughts on the cause of ships disappearing near Sol system, even when the hyperdrive in Sigmund Ausfaller's ship, Hobo Kelly, completely disappears as they approach Earth. Carlos and Bey are returning to Earth; Bey in order to be with his love, Sharrol Janss, and their two children, Tanya and Louis (both of whom were fathered by Carlos). Carlos, perhaps having a resurgence of flatland phobia, has agreed to return there with Ausfaller. Carlos and Bey meet with Dr. Julian Forward and discover that he has found a quantum black hole and is using it to make ships in hyperdrive disappear. Forward takes them hostage and attempts to destroy the Hobo Kelly, but Ausfaller fires on his ships and Shaeffer manages to damage his equipment, temporarily losing control of the quantum black hole, which Forward, sensing defeat, allows himself to be drawn into. Ausfaller rescues Bey and Carlos and they continue on to Earth where Bey rejoins Sharrol and their children and Carlos resumes his own life on Earth. Carlos and Sharrol Janss had a casual sexual relationship before Sharrol met Shaeffer, although Carlos may have been more interested in her than she in him, since he tried to convince her at one point to leave Earth with him because he felt smothered by the overprotective ARMs who were tasked with protecting his life. When Shaeffer and Janss decided to have children but Shaeffer was denied a parenthood license due to his albinism, they agreed that Carlos would father two children with Sharrol and she and Bey would raise them. Eventually Wu formed a relationship with Feather Filip, an ARM agent tasked to protect him and he and she created a plan to secretly emigrate from Earth to another planet. To minimize the chance they would be found they planned to bring others along to disguise the size of their group (the ARM would presumably be looking for two people, not a larger group). They brought Bey and Sharrol into the plan. Feather had located a ship that would transport them to Fafnir. From there, they would take the place of a family named Graynor, a group of two men, two women and two children. That family would secretly emigrate to Wunderland, where Feather had set up funding for them, while they would move on to Home. However, after reaching Fafnir, Feather turned on them, shooting Shaeffer in the chest with the punchgun, to show Carlos what she was capable of, so he would stay with her. Instead, Carlos ran with the children, Tanya and Louis, and managed to emigrate to Home without Feather's help. A year and a half later, when Ander Smittarasheed caught up to Bey and Sharrol on Fafnir, she was frozen for shipment to Home along with their daughter Jeena and their unborn child. While on Earth Carlos lived underwater at the United Nations-protected Great Barrier Reef on Earth. Carlos Wu appears in the Beowulf Shaeffer stories The Borderland of Sol and Procrustes, and is mentioned in the stories Grendel and Ghost. =Louis Wu= Fictional alien species In the process of exploring space, humankind encounters several intelligent alien species, including the following (in alphabetical order): =Bandersnatch= The Bandersnatch (plural bandersnatchi) is a fictional alien species in Larry Niven's Known Space universe. The species is named for Lewis Carroll's Bandersnatch. Niven's first story to discuss the Bandersnatchi was World of Ptavvs, published in 1966. That story relates the way that they were named as follows: Bandersnatchi are described as enormous herd animals, twice the size of an Apatosaurus with a slug-like shape and completely white, slick skin. A sauropod-like neck, with no head, extends about as high as the bandersnatch's body. The tip is thick and rounded, entirely featureless, other than two tufts of black bristles (sense organs). At the front of the body, low to the ground, is a large mouth adapted to scooping a form of mutated yeast out of shallow ocean-like yeast colonies. Niven's works describe Bandersnatchi as one giant cell with long chromosomes as thick as a human finger, rendering them impervious to the mutagenitive effects of radiation and therefore unable to mutate. As single cells, they reproduce asexually by budding. Their nerves have no cell body and no nuclei; nothing to separate them from other specialized protoplasm. The Bandersnatchi also have 6 large hearts, each weighing about 11 pounds. The brain is large, shaped long and narrow, and is encased in a bony cage. The skull is one end of this jointless, flexible, very strong cage that keeps them from ever shifting position. In the Known Space universe, the Bandersnatchi were created by the Tnuctipun during the Thrintun empire (~1.5 billion BCE) as a food source with a flavor nearly irresistible to the predatory Thrintun. As such, the Thrintun had no objection to their large size. While the Thrintun believed that the Bandersnatchi possessed no intelligence, they were actually sentient beings resistant to their telepathic mind control abilities and were used by the Tnuctipun to spy on the Thrintun until a slave rebellion. This immunity to the Thrintun psychic abilities also allowed them to survive the mass-suicide command used at the end of the Tnuctipun-Thrintun war. However, because Bandersnatchi chromosomes are so thick and resilient that they never mutate, they therefore cannot evolve, and have remained biologically unchanged for the past two billion years. Bandersnatchi are portrayed as surviving on the planet Jinx, with isolated populations also scattered throughout the galaxy, including the planet Beanstalk and the 'Maps of Jinx' in the Great Oceans of the Ringworld. On Jinx, Bandersnatchi allow themselves to be hunted in exchange for specialized tools and devices, such as mechanical 'arms' specifically designed for their massive bodies, along with keeping the Bandersnatchi population in check and providing the humans with something to fight. The Hunter's equipment is restricted by agreement to make things more equal; about 40% of the hunters do not return. Along with Grogs and Dolphins, Bandersnatchi are described as a \\"Handicapped\\" (with a capital \\"H\\") race, in that they are sentient but do not possess any prehensile limbs. =Chuquen= The Chunquen are a slave species of the Kzinti, remarkable to their captors for the sentience of both sexes. (\\"They fought constantly.\\")Larry Niven, \\"The Warriors\\", Tales of Known Space (Del Rey, 1985), 261. Their homeworld is watery; they resisted the Kzinti invasion with missiles fired from submarines.Hal Colebatch and Jessica Q. Fox, A Man Named Saul, in Man-Kzin Wars XIV, Baen Books, 2013 : \\"\\"We kzin,\\" he continued, \\"have at times destroyed species in our wars, but never willingly or wantonly. Even when the Chunquen fired missiles at us from their submerged sea-ships, we only boiled part of their seas.\\"\\" Apparently they were exterminated before the Kzinti first encountered humans. =Grogs= The Grogs are Sessile sentient creatures, shaped like furry cones. They are eyeless, earless, and have a prehensile tongue. They can also control animals telepathically. The Grogs are thought by some to be the descendants of the Thrintun species, after 1.5 billion years of atrophy. =Gw'oth= The Gw'oth (singular Gw'o) are alien creatures first encountered in Larry Niven and Edward M. Lerner's collaborative Fleet of Worlds series of novels (a subset of Niven's Known Space future history). The Gw'oth resemble starfish and inhabit the ocean under the ice of their home world, the moon Jm'ho. When linked together ‚Äì using a vestigial talent that few Gw'oth retain ‚Äì they can form a powerful biological computer. One such instance is named Ol't'ro. Ol't'ro is composed of 16 Gw'oth individuals who link themselves together into a 'meld' or ensemble mind called a Gw'otesht. Ol't'ro is featured prominently throughout the Fleet of Worlds series. Ol't'ro's ultimate fate is unknown after the Fate of Worlds book in the series. Whether Ol't'ro died in the explosion of planets or somehow escaped is left unanswered. Ol't'ro had just solved the mystery of Type II hyperspatial travel so it is possible but unknown that the Gw'otesht managed to escape in that fashion. =Jotoki= The Jotoki (singular Jotok) are a fictional alien race, first described in the novelette \\"The Survivor\\" by Donald Kingsbury, in Man-Kzin Wars IV.\\"The Survivor\\", Donald Kingsbury, The Man-Kizin Wars IV, 1991, Baen (August 1, 1991), . Jotoki resemble large, spindly starfish. They have a torochord (ring-shaped) instead of a notochord, with five \\"self-sections\\" (apparently semi-independent brains) that operate the Jotok's body cooperatively. The Jotoki begin life as small aquatic swimmers, most of which are eaten by predators; in time, five of the survivors will merge to form one collective organism, which grows into an arboreal adolescent form; its tails become arms, and its fins differentiate into fingers. When it grows large enough, the Jotok imprints itself on an adult (if one is available) and enters a stage of rapid learning and brain growth. A Jotok who desires a family can simply go into the wilderness and \\"harvest\\" an adolescent of the proper age (a property that Kzin slavers later exploit). Unimprinted adult Jotoki are considered feral, and regarded as little more than animals. Since the five subunits that make up one Jotok individual are not necessarily genetically related, reproduction does not require sex; a Jotok can simply find a pond and deposit its offspring to begin the cycle again. Before their enslavement, Jotoki operated in groups called \\"clanpods\\", as part of their former planet-wide tradeweb. Details of this arrangement are not known. Jotok technological specialties included gravity polarizers, linguistics and biotechnology. They had the ability to force-grow clones to adulthood. The Jotoki were also experts at trade. Their interstellar trade empire was quite developed for its time, but after Kzinti were used as mercenaries for many years, the Kzinti revolted and conquered the Jotoki. The Jotoki became the slaves and food-animals of the ferocious Kzinti. In \\"modern\\" times (i.e. during most of the Known Space stories), Jotoki are a seldom-seen slave race of the Kzinti. The Kzinti believe that there is a free Jotoki fleet wandering amongst the stars, which would have provided their most strenuous opposition (excepting humans). In Man-Kzin Wars XI, it is established that surviving Jotoki swimmers inhabited a Wunderland swamp near a crashed Kzin cruiser. Although the swamp was rendered uninhabitable, by the end of the book it is established that humans recovered some Jotoki and are attempting to breed a free Jotok species. The success of this is unknown, since earlier- written but chronologically later Niven works do not mention free Jotoki.\\"The Survivor\\", Donald Kingsbury, in The Man-Kizin Wars IV, 1991, Baen (August 1, 1991). . =Kdatlyno= The Kdatlyno are chiefly known for their touch sculpture, their sonar \\"vision\\". Their race was formerly subjugated by the Kzinti until freed by the humans. In appearance they are a physically large and powerful bipedal species with muscular build, rough scaly skin, retractile claws and thick hides, growing up to eight feet tall. They have no eyes, having evolved on a world which instead drove the development of echolocation rather than vision. Kdatlyno are one of the few sentient races that can physically intimidate an adult Kzin, and there is at least one mention of them being used as elite Imperial Guards for the Kzinti Patriarch, presumably due to both their great strength and their uninvolvement in Kzin imperial court politics. The short story \\"Grendel\\" features the Kdatlyno Lloobee, a touch- sculptor who works primarily for a human audience. =Kzin= =Martians= The Martians are primitive but intelligent humanoids who lived beneath the sands. Martians burst into flames when brought in contact with water. Martians killed many of the early human explorers on Mars, principally because they concealed their existence, and they weren't suspected. In the novel Protector, the Martians were wiped out when Jack Brennan caused an ice asteroid to crash into the surface of Mars, raising the average humidity of the atmosphere. Some Martians still exist on the \\"Map of Mars\\" on the Ringworld. =Morlocks= The Morlocks are semi-sentient humanoid cave dwellers on Wunderland. They, like humans, descended from a failed attempt by Pak Protectors to colonize Sol and nearby star systems.Hal Colebatch, \\"Catspaws\\", in Man-Kzin Wars XI. Named by humans for the creatures in H.G. Wells' The Time Machine. =Outsiders= The Outsiders are many-limbed beings that are invariably described as a cat o'nine tails with a fattened handle. Their body composition includes ultra-cold superfluid helium. Outsiders are estimated to be the most advanced species in Known Space, possibly the Galaxy, but the extent of their development remains unknown. Though they have the technology to produce advanced faster-than-light drives, they rarely use them, preferring to travel the \\"slow\\" way, just below the speed of light. They do possess a \\"reactionless drive\\" technology that allows them to reach this speed almost instantaneously. In Ringworld's Children Louis Wu says that the Outsiders have \\"something better\\" than hyperdrive but this is not elaborated on. They spend all of their time following starseeds and acting as information brokers to space-faring sentient races throughout the Milky Way. Their prices can be very high and scaled to the estimated impact the information will have on the civilization of the client race. Their most common wares are interstellar propulsion systems of various types. The Outsiders maintain a strict commercial ethos regarding any form of knowledge, which shrouds them in a secrecy only wealth can penetrate. They do not haggle. They will answer any question, even those about themselves, if you are willing to pay the price. Personal questions about the Outsiders have been priced beyond the ability of any individual or government to pay (on the order of a trillion credits). In \\"Peace and Freedom\\", it is revealed that starseeds are in fact packages of microorganisms designed to seed new planets with life, thus creating new customers for the Outsiders. They are reluctant to reveal this information because they are ashamed, since one of their starseeds created the Thrint, which destroyed nearly all intelligent life in the galaxy several billion years ago. Another theory behind the Outsiders-Starseed connection is that Starseeds actually carry Outsider 'spores;' as the Outsiders are a small numbered species their offspring are of great importance to them. The Outsiders are thought to have evolved on a cold world with no atmosphere, similar to Neptune's moon Nereid, which they lease from the Earth government. They live on thermoelectricity by lying with their heads in sunlight and their tails in shadow; the temperature difference sets up a current. In some of the later Known Space stories it has been suggested that the Outsiders do not use hyperspace as its conditions are lethal to them because they would be unable to generate thermoelectricity. Outsider 'ships' are equipped with an artificial 'sun' for their journeys between systems, but because of the nature of their 'ships' the hyperspace 'blind spot' would absorb this artificial light, killing Outsiders who remained in hyperspace too long. (The canonicity of this material is debatable as it was not written by Niven.) The novel A Darker Geometry by Gregory Benford and Mark O. Martin revealed that the Outsiders were created by a race of extra-dimensional aliens seeking to escape the heat death of their own universe. Edward M. Lerner revealed in an online chat (as 'EML') that Larry Niven had ruled A Darker Geometry as definitely non-canonical and incompatible with the then forthcoming Juggler of Worlds, which was co-authored by Niven and Lerner. Juggler of Worlds introduces a number of possible retcons to established Outsider history. While in most of the Known Space Series, the name \\"Outsiders\\" refers to the aforementioned species, in stories that happen before the discovery of aliens the term \\"Outsider\\" refers to any alien that might make contact with mankind. The Outsiders may have inspired the Melnorme, from Star Control 2, another highly advanced and very mysterious species. The Investor species in Shaper/Mechanist stories by Bruce Sterling have a similar ethos but an altogether different biology. =Pak Protectors= =Pierin= The Pierin are a rare multi-limbed species which developed on a planet with lower gravity than Earth, thus Pierin spend much time in the air. They have horns on their heads and wide membranous wings. They speak in raspy screeches and atonal clicks. Pierin are described as curious and friendly to the point of being nosy. They were able to develop a small space-faring civilization before being enslaved by the Kzin. Their planet of origin is known as Pierin, orbiting a star in the constellation Reticulum. At some point Human beings tried to ally with them against the Kzin. They eventually were liberated from slavery during the Man-Kzin wars.The Ringworld Engineers, Larry Niven, Del Rey; 9th THUS edition (November 12, 1985) =Pierson's Puppeteers= =Thrintun= The Thrintun (singular Thrint; also, Slavers) are an ancient species that ruled a large empire, including the region of Known Space, through telepathic mind control about 1.5 billion years ago. A technology created by one of their slave races was the stasis field, which makes its contents impervious to harm and provides indefinite suspended animation, which has figured in several Known Space stories. Thrintun were small (approximately 1.25 meters tall), highly telepathic but not particularly intelligent (with their mind control, they did not need to be), reptilian, with green scaly skin, pointed teeth, and a single eye. The species was depicted in Barlowe's Guide to ExtraterrestrialsBarlowe, 100. =Tnuctip= The Tnuctipun (singular Tnuctip) were small, arboreal pack predators, averaging about 3‚Äì4 feet long. Their heads were long and lean, and their eyes opened laterally. They were highly intelligent (IQ estimated around 130‚Äì140, according to the short story \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\") and social. As befits their carnivorous nature, they were also ruthless, aggressive, and cunning. Their word for alien most closely translates to \\"food that talks\\". Two billion years before humans evolved, the galaxy was ruled by the Thrintun, who telepathically enslaved other species, including the Tnuctipun. The Tnuctipun invented most of the technologies from that era, including stage trees (trees containing solid rocket fuel in their trunks, originally used as cheap rocket boosters, which in the present era of the Known Space universe had evolved to seed themselves across star systems), sunflowers (flowers with integral parabolic mirrors that can focus sunlight to deadly effect), and stasis fields (a time dilation device). They were also known to have direct conversion of mass to energy and a telepathy shield (these two technologies are lost by the time most Niven stories take place). In order for the Tnuctipun to think creatively, the Thrintun allowed them some limited freedom. The Tnuctipun used that freedom to stage a rebellion against their masters, the culmination of a carefully thought out, centuries-long plan. In the novel World of Ptavvs, the protagonist Larry Greenberg, a telepath who reads the mind of a Thrint, theorizes that some of their inventions were traps: Bandersnatchi, thought to be non-sentient livestock, were in fact intelligent, created as spies immune to telepathy. Sunflowers turned against their masters and burned Thrint homes to the ground. Other Tnuctip inventions were designed to shape Thrint society to weaken it. Sunflowers encouraged a trend for the slavers to live in isolated manors, surrounded by slaves. Mutated racing viprin (fast-running creatures raced for entertainment and gambling) ruined the existing viprin herding business, which along with other similar inventions led to an economic depression prior to the Tnuctip revolt. The war escalated until the Thrintun, rather than accept defeat, employed a device that amplified the sphere of influence of a Thrint's mind control to encompass the entire galaxy. And they gave a simple command: Die. And everything in the galaxy that had evolved a backbone perished, including any Thrintun not protected by a stasis field. The Bandersnatchi were one of the only sentient races that survived this on a large scale, because they were already immune to telepathic commands. This course of events is alluded to in the novel World of Ptavvs and a still functioning suicide amplifier itself is discovered in the short story \\"Peter Robinson\\" by Hal Colebach, at which point it is destroyed. Several other Tnuctip inventions are inadvertently discovered in the various known space novels, including a prototype hyperspace shunt, discovered during the first Man-Kzin War (in the novelette Inconstant Star by Poul Anderson). The Kzinti lose the war before they can bring news of it home, and the device itself is lost. A recent Man-Kzin Wars short story ‚Äì \\"Teacher's Pet\\" by Matthew Joseph Harrington, in Man-Kzin Wars XI ‚Äì claimed that the Tnuctipun are responsible for creating the Pak Protectors. As with most Man-Kzin Wars material, its canonicity has not been confirmed by Niven. In 1968, Niven worked with Norman Spinrad to draft a story outline entitled Down In Flames, in which much of the history of Known Space is revealed to be a hoax, and in which it is revealed that the Kzin are the Tnuctipun. The outline was published in Tom Reamy's fanzine Trumpet, and released on the internet, but was never intended to be completed or published,\\"Future Histories\\", The Bulletin of the Science Fiction Writers of America, Summer 1989, Vol. 23 #2, issue 104. and was superseded by the Ringworld series of novels. =Trinocs= The Trinocs are named for their three eyes; they also have three fingers on each hand and a triangular mouth. They are described as bipedal humanoids, with long legs, short torsos, and improbably flexible neck vertebrae. An unconfirmed source states that they breathe a \\"primordial reducing atmosphere\\" mainly composed of methane and ammonia, and are culturally paranoid, at least by human standards. First encountered by Louis Wu in the short story \\"There is a Tide\\". =Whrloo= The Whrloo are meter-tall insectoids with long eyestalks,Paul Chafe, Destiny's Forge. their homeworld has low gravity with a thick, dense atmosphere. They never saw the stars until they were enslaved by the Kzinti. =Others= Also figuring in some stories are dolphins and other intelligent cetaceans, and various offshoots of Homo sapiens including the associate lineage of the hominids of the Ringworld. Most life in Known Space shares similar biochemistries, since they evolved from the Thrintun practice of seeding barren worlds with food yeast which they used to feed their slaves. Over a billion years, the Thrintun food yeast evolved into the different life forms in Known Space. In-universe terms =Belters= A Belter refers to a resident of the Asteroid Belt around Sol, sometimes known as the Sol Belt to differentiate it from Alpha Centauri's Serpent Swarm. Rugged and highly individualistic, Belters make their living by mining the ores from the asteroidal rocks. Belters inhabit the main belt, trojan asteroids of the outer planets, centaur planetoids and NEA's. Transient by nature, the only home they typically own is their pressure suit, and perhaps their singleship. As a form of heraldry, Belters decorate their skintight suits with elaborate (and often expensive) torso paintings. Most Belters, male and female, sport what is known as the Belter Crest: shaving their heads on the sides, leaving a strip of hair down the center resembling a mohawk. However, the hair in the back can be of any length, particularly for women. In lieu of (or perhaps in addition to) a wake for their dead, Belters have a custom known as the ceremonial drunk. When a Belter dies, his or her close friends will typically get intoxicated (either alone or in groups according to one's nature or circumstance) and reminisce about the deceased. The Belt Government collects a 30% tax on all cargo sold within the belt. However, one can avoid paying the tax by smuggling one's cargo to an Earth facility, which collects no taxes. The caveat is that, if one is caught smuggling by the Belt police (known as goldskins due to the color of their spacesuits), one will forfeit all of one's cargo to the Belt Government. To a Belter, smuggling is considered \\"illegal but not immoral\\". It is considered equivalent to a parking violation on Earth. If caught, one simply pays the fine and that is the end of it. According to the novel Protector, the Belt government is a meritocracy; Lit Shaeffer was chosen for a leadership position by aptitude test, and \\"worked [his] way up\\". =Flatlanders= Flatlander refers to any human born on Earth, in contrast to those who live on other planets or space habitats. The derogatory term was coined by Belters, whose space habitats are either enclosed, or located on large asteroids with visibly curving horizons. Whereas from any point on the surface of Earth the horizon looks flat. Of the stable population of approximately eighteen billion people living on Earth from about the 23rd century onwards, very few wind up leaving the planet for any length of time. Many suffer from the so-called flatland phobia, a chronic fear of leaving the confines of the environment in which humans evolved. Their reaction to changes in gravity, atmospheric composition, and sunlight hue can include nausea and continual panic attacks. Those who do venture into space, of course, tend to take exception to the word, as they have left the planet with no ill effects, and even relish partaking of the same adventures and benefits of space travel that non-Earthbound humans enjoy. Gregory Pelton is one of these, goading Beowulf Shaeffer into calling him a flatlander even after having traveled to a number of planets in Known Space.

The factory helped Daniel Pratt become the leading producer of cotton gins in the world and was one of the South's most important cotton mills. It became the largest gin factory in the world and supplied gins to Russia, Great Britain, and France. In 1899, it merged with other manufacturing companies to become the Continental Gin Company. It was the oldest continuously-operated industrial complex in the state of Alabama until 2012 and is now named Continental Eagle after the company name of the current owners. History Early in the 1830s, Daniel Pratt purchased an estimate of one thousand acres of land on Autauga creek at around twenty-one dollars an acre from Joseph May. The land was to be paid in four instalments from 1836 to 1838. The purchase of this land was the starting point for Pratt's Manufacturing Company. Slave labor was used to build the factory and Yankees helped to pay for the financial portion. The factory began as a small sawmill and used the creek to power the machines used in the factory. During 1846, this factory was one of the most important cotton mills in the South, and in his Prattville Manufacturing Company. In 1854, Pratt built a three-storey brick building to manufacture a thousand gins a year. It is locate directly behind the Daniel Pratt Gin Factory and produced over nine hundred cotton gins to supply Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. Two of his goals of creating the factories were to employ poor whites and create a \\"village of good morals and good society\\". By 1860, The town of Prattville became a village with many manufacturing companies and blacksmiths coming into town. During the Civil War, the factory helped Daniel Pratt become the leading manufacturer of cotton gins in the South. Pratt became very wealthy from selling gins in the midst of the Civil War. The Prattville Dragoons, the first group of men from Prattville to serve in the Civil War for the Confederate Army, were supplied with uniforms from the mill. After the Civil War, Pratt continued to make gins and became the first millionaire in the South until he died on May 13, 1873. The Prattville Manufacturing Company continued as the Continental Gin Company when it merged with other companies in 1899. It continued to operate until the current owners, Continental Eagle, stopped production in 2012. Labor In the 1800s, the South was a major agricultural area and used enslaved labor to pick cotton and various other resources. Enslaved labor was also used in the industrial field. Years before Pratt's arrival, Autauga County's slave population was over fifty percent. Pratt owned a few slaves prior to his coming to Autauga County. He defended slavery and told his father in 1827 \\"that to live in any country it is necessary to conform to the customs of the country in part.\\" On his way to Autauga, he brought his wife, two slaves and enough material to build fifty gins. Pratt needed more physical labor to clear the land and build his factory, so he purchased twenty slaves to assist him. On completion of the factory in 1839, Pratt's ownership of slaves increased over the years. Enslaved labor was used in the factory, along with whites that Pratt wanted to help. After the Civil War, Pratt released his slaves and hired some into the factory with pay. He also helped \\"poor whites\\", mostly women and children, so he could create a town of \\"good morals\\". By 1860, Pratt employed around 140 poor white women and children. The gin factory produced over one thousand gins per year. Recent history In 2012, the current factory owner Continental Eagle stopped production and closed down the factory. On December 29, 2014, the factory building was set for auction. Many companies have interest in purchasing the buildings, but city officials tried to find a way to save the historic property. The board invested thousands of dollars to the property, with permission from Continental, to fix the roofing. The buildings are being auctioned to hopefully bring in developers to boost the popularity of the town.

Windsor-Clive played first-class cricket for Cambridge University between 1910 and 1912. He served in the First World War with the Coldstream Guards and was killed in action on 25 August 1914. He was the first first-class cricketer to be killed in the war. Life and military career Windsor-Clive was born at Hewell Grange near Redditch to Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth, and his wife, Alberta Victoria Sarah Caroline. He was educated at Eton College, where he played for the college cricket team from 1907 to 1909. From there he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge. While studying at Cambridge he made his debut in first- class cricket for Cambridge University against Essex at Fenner's in 1910. He played first-class cricket for Cambridge until 1912, making seven appearances. In his seven matches, he scored 108 runs with a high score of 22, while with his left-arm medium pace bowling he took 3 wickets with best figures of 3 for 56. In addition to playing first-class cricket, Windsor-Clive played minor counties cricket for Glamorgan between 1908 and 1912, making four appearances in the Minor Counties Championship. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Territorial Force. In December 1913, he was transferred from the Territorial Force to the Coldstream Guards, at which point he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Shortly after the beginning of hostilities in the First World War, Windsor-Clive left for France with the 3rd Battalion aboard the on 12 August 1914. The battalion soon reached Harveng in Belgium, where they set up defensive positions. The following day the allied Retreat from Mons began. The Coldstream Guards fell back to Landrecies, where they defended the north-western sector of the town. At some point between 19:00 and 20:00 on 25 August 1914, Windsor-Clive was killed by a German shell, which also killed his batman, Frank Lethbridge. He was the first first-class cricketer to fall in the war. His body was recovered and he was buried at the Landrecies Communal Cemetery. His brother-in-law, Hugo Charteris, was also a first-class cricketer.

S. Eliot Prize for poetry in 2004. The collection has two parts, in a variety of forms, including sonnet and terza rima. It was praised by critics, who remarked on its emotional power and its attempts to recollect places and people in poems that use ekphrasis to incorporate and emulate elements of cinematography and photography. Content The first part of Reel contains poems in terza rima. The opening (title) poem takes a tour through Szirtes' native city, Budapest, which he left in 1956 with his family on his 8th birthday, during the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1956. It is dedicated to his wife, the artist Clarissa Upchurch. The second poem is also a memorialization, but of a person: the German-born writer W. G. Sebald, who like Szirtes emigrated to England and like him lived in East Anglia. (Sebald was the author of a novel called Austerlitz, and the poem is called \\"Meeting Austerlitz\\".) The second part of the collection, \\"The Dream Hotel\\", contains poems in other forms, including a sonnet sequence about getting older. One critic called these poems \\"human and humane\\". It includes three poems inspired by Sebasti√£o Salgado, a Brazilian documentary photographer. Themes, style, form Reel, according to Paul Farley, a poet and critic who was on the jury that awarded Szirtes the T. S. Eliot Prize, is a collection concerned with memory and mnemonics. The title poem memorializes Budapest and contains Hungarian street and place names, which Szirtes weaves into the English language by adhering to terza rima, the rhyme scheme made famous by Dante's Divine Comedy: > The city is unfixed, its formal maps Are mere mnemonics where each shape > repeats Its name before some ultimate collapse. The train shunts in the > sidings, cars pull in By doorways, move off, disappear in gaps Between the > shops. It is like watching skin Crack and wrinkle. Old words: Andr√°ssy √∫t > And Hal t√©r. Naming of streets: Tolbuhin, M√ºnnich... the distant smell of > rotting fruit, Old shredded documents in blackened piles, Dead trees with > squirrels snuffling at the root. The title poem, and much of the first half of the volume are in terza rima (a three-line stanza using chain rhyme in the pattern ABA BCB CDC). Szirtes commented on the form: \\"I adapted Dante's terza rima because it is an ideal episodic narrative form, (as in the Commedia) each verse clipping into the next, each section sufficient to articulate a central event\\". The tercet's episodic quality Szirtes notes is seen also by critics, who linked it to cinematography; Dave Mason comments that the collection's \\"first sixty pages contain poems and sequences in terza rima, often headlong, racing through ideas and images like a film unspooling\\". Photography and cinema are important to Szirtes, who is especially attracted to ekphrasis, the literary trope in which a place or a work of visual art is described vividly and in detail. The title, Reel, refers to the reel used in cinema, and both the reel and the act of filming are explicitly referred to in the poems. The title poem is itself, in a way, cinematographic, since it (also) describes the city of Budapest as a movie set where it stands for Berlin. According to Farley, \\"memory plays out as footage\\", and he cites Szirtes, \\"bells of the city chime, round upon round. / The film rolls on. A car sweeps round the bend\\". The image is important in Szirtes' life and work: he arrived in England as a child with only a box of photographs, he studied painting as well as writing, and critics note the importance of the \\"captured image\\" in his poetry. In a 2011 interview, Szirtes described the visual effect of individual tercets of poems in Reel by comparing them with \\"a film clip that contains its own brief narrative, each episode part of a broad theme\\". T. S. Eliot Prize, critical responses The T. S. Eliot Prize is the most prestigious award for poetry by an Irish or English poet. Szirtes, when asked about the effects of the prize, said it brought him a lot more attention and assured him in the \\"poetic vocation [which] is psychologically insecure\\". Paul Farley, critiquing the collection for The Guardian, praised Szirtes as a \\"visionary formalist\\". David Mason, in The Hudson Review, said \\"it's high time his work was better known on this side of the Atlantic\\". John Taylor, in a review of Szirtes' New & Collected Poems (2008), called the seven-part sequence on Sebald \\"one of his most moving poems\\".

His diverse output includes compositions, academic papers, talks (TED (conference)) and musical performances. He has worked with a number of artists including Tim Minchin, Pat Martino, John Williams, Tod Machover, Steve Winwood and Brian Eno and research bodies such as the Wellcome Trust, UCL Neuroscience, British Library, Science Museum, Aldeburgh Music and the Smithsonian Institution. Mermikides is widely recognised as a leading figure in data sonification. His 2004 work Bloodlines, written with his sister Dr Alex Mermikides, received critical acclaim.Bloodlines was created by translating his daily blood results, whilst suffering from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia, into each second of a musical composition. He currently holds the position of Reader in Music, Head of Composition and Director of the MMUS Programme at the University of Surrey. He is also a professor of Jazz Guitar at the Royal College of Music in London and previously held the post of Head of Music Technology and Lecturer in Music at the Royal Academy of Music. In 2014 Mermikides co-founded the International Guitar Research Centre (IGRC) with Stephen Goss and John Williams.  Background  Milton John Mermikides was born in Hampton, England in 1971 to CERN nuclear physicist Michael Mermikides and Law Student Olga Lioufis. He travelled widely as a child, receiving music classes from Ivor Cutler at Fox Primary School in Kensington, London and eventually attending Highgate School in North London. He gained a BSc in Analytical and Descriptive Economics from the London School of Economics and a BMus in Jazz Performance and Composition from Berklee College of Music (Boston, USA). Whilst at Berklee he studied Jazz Improvisation with Ed Tomassi, Hal Crook and John Damian. Mermikides is an atheist and sceptic and a vocal opponent to the Anti-vax movement. He has been associated with the sceptic movement and has collaborated with George Hrab (with several appearances and references on his podcast and an interview of George by Milton on his album Trebuchet ‚Äì the 'Virtual liner notes' ), the QED conference (for which he wrote the theme tune), the James Randi Educational Foundation and The Amazing Meeting. He was also interviewed on Meet the Skeptics.  Compositions  His music blends data sonification, Jazz, modernist, generative, world music, IDM, groove, rock and electroacoustic genres. These are informed by research into musical theory, cognition & perception, scientific concepts, natural processes, algorithmic composition, microrhythm and improvisation. He has referred to this radical blending of styles, concepts and processes as ‚Äúliminalism‚Äù, a \\"challenging, blending and melding of the boundaries of musical style, and of the limits of music perception, processes and accessibility\\". His data sonification work Bloodlines was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Midweek, and featured in the Times Higher Education Supplement. A later data sonification work, Careful, was featured in The Guardian. He has written music for plays (Derry Playhouse), Film Scores (Martino: Unstrung), arrangements for string quartet (D Rail, played live on BBC Radio 4's Intune), sound installations (Microcosmos at the Royal Academy of Music). In 2018, Milton Mermikides was interviewed by Evelyn Glennie on BBC Radio 4 on data sonification and his translations of Bridget Riley prints into music.  Collaborations  Mermikides has collaborated extensively with a diverse range of artists, academics and scientists. Collaborations include; writing the score for Pat Martino's film Martino:Unstrung (2008), arranging and production credits (with Bridget Mermikides) on Tim Minchin's Storm animation, and arranging music for Brian Eno for Hiroko Koshino's fashion shows in China and Japan. Mermikides was previously guitarist and arranger for band Stax (previously called Souled Out) with singer Sam Brown whose guest artists included Steve Winwood and Tim Rice. He has also worked with Sleep experts and his Sound Asleep project was exhibited in the Design Museum, London, and featured on BBC Radio 4 Inside Science. Most recently he has been working with Professor Morten Kringelbach of Oxford University drawing parallels between circadian rhythms and musical theory, culminating in a presentation of new music at a public lecture hosted by the British Neuroscience Association. In 2006 Mermikides founded the Eclectic Guitar Orchestra (Milton's Big EGO) ‚Äì a guitar orchestra made up entirely of eminent guitarists. Members have included Craig Ogden, John Williams, Paco Pe√±a, Jake Willson, Thomas Leeb, Declan Zapala, Stephen Goss, Gary Ryan, George Hrab and Bridget Mermikides. He is currently working in collaboration with music technology pioneer Peter Zinovieff.  Academic Output  Mermikides gained a PhD from the University of Surrey in 2010 for his thesis ' Changes Over Time'. His academic output consists of many published articles including 'Rondo All Turca', for Total Guitar Magazine, 'On Composing: How To Be A Successful Computer-based Composer' (2010) for Computer Music Magazine Special: Making It, 'Parallel Worlds', '5 Decades of the Jam Band' 'Extreme Guitar Concepts' and 'Bossa Appreciation' (2014) for Guitar Techniques Magazine. He has also contributed chapters to many books including Music and Shape published by Oxford University Press and frequently shares articles on music theory on his website. He has given many keynote presentations, including a talk for TEDx Groningen in April 2016 entitled 'Everything we do is music'., at the Hong Kong Academy of the Performing Arts in 2018 as part of the 3rd Altamira Guitar Symposium and the International Guitar Research Centre, The British Sleep Society, Royal Physiological Society, Studium generale and the Frank Mohr Institute. In 2019 he shared a keynote presentation with Jim Al-Khaleli at the University of Surrey Doctoral Conference. In 2015 was hailed a 'Rap Genius' by Gareth Malone OBE for his satirical instruction article on writing a generic Eurovision song. He has also written an article on the controversial 432 Hz Movement and has been interviewed as an expert in ancient Greek Tuning on BBC Radio 3 Music Matters. He was supervisor for Bill Bruford's PhD at the University of Surrey. Milton's work features in many publications including The Oxford Handbook of Computer Music, Nature Immunology, New dramaturgy: international perspectives on theory and practice, Medical Humanities Journal, Consciousness, Theatre, Literature and the Arts and The Anatomy of the Science Play.  Leukaemia and Fundraising  In 2004 Milton Mermikides was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. On 8 April 2005, he received a life saving bone-marrow transplant from his sister Dr Alex Mermikides. Whilst undergoing intensive radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment, he set up a website ‚Äì miltcentral.com (now archived on his website miltonline.com) ‚Äì and produced regular blog posts and videos from Charing Cross and Hammersmith Hospitals documenting his treatment for leukaemia and bone marrow transplant. His courage and productivity during this period was inspirational to many fellow cancer sufferers and received global attention from leukaemia patients, carers, scientists, schools, skeptical groups and musicians. This later led to a scholarship from the James Randi Educational Foundation, and appearing as a judge in the final of the 2006 Air Guitar World Championships in Oulu, Finland.

The Pohjois-Haaga mass grave is a grave in Lassila, Helsinki, Finland, near the Pohjois-Haaga railway station that dates to the time of the Finnish Civil War in 1918. 28 men of the Red Guards or civilians thought to have been affiliated with them executed by the German Baltic Sea Division soldiers are buried at the site. History During the Battle of Helsinki, on 12 April 1918, advancing German troops executed ca. 40-50 men they had apprehended, who mostly belonged to the Red Guards. The executions took place around 8 p.m. at a bog that located halfway between the Vihdintie Roundabout and Riistavuori. When the locals had fetched from the pile of bodies their family members, the rest, people from out of town, were transported to a pit in an uninhabited location near-by. The grave was located along an artillery lane close to Base no. XXIV of the Krepost Sveaborg, a fortification that was built to shield Helsinki in the event of war. The events leading up to the executions or the identities of all those executed are not known for certain. According to one version, the Germans found ca. 150 persons in a cellar at 12 Vanha Viertotie, people belonging most to the Reds. The Reds had flown a white flag to signal that they would surrender, but someone had opened fire killing two German soldiers. After this, the Germans ordered all the men in a line along the road and selected every third to be executed. Another version has it that the executions were a reprisal for the German commander, General R√ºdiger von der Goltz‚Äôs car having been shot at. On the other hand, it was said that the local White Guards had played a part in the events. This is said because many of those executed belonged to the local Red Guards or were leaders of the working class. It is also said that people slated for execution were taken from their homes and brought to the site. According to a traditional view, Estonian Deputy Prime Minister J√ºri Vilms and his companions Arnold J√ºrgens and Johannes Peistik as well as their guide Aleksei R√ºnk, executed on 12th or 13th April on the grounds of the T√∂√∂l√∂ Sugar Factory, had also been buried in the same mass grave. Estonian investigators exhumed in December 1920 four bodies that they identified as Vilms, J√ºrgens, Peistik, and R√ºnk on the basis of their clothes, and they were reburied in Estonia. Finnish historian Seppo Zetterberg has later come to the conclusion that the story of Vilms‚Äô execution in Helsinki and burial in the Haaga mass grave is unreliable and possibly made up. The Pohjois-Haaga mass grave is now a protected site that belongs to the city of Helsinki. The site has a memorial erected in 1919, made by stone workers of the city, with no text but the year 1918 inscribed. There is also a metal fence around the grave. In May 1996, the city of Helsinki added a plaque with information of the events leading to the creation of the mass grave. With regard to the fate of Vilms, the plaque contained numerous errors. In December 2015, a new plaque was placed at the grave, with no mention of Vilms or his retinue. According to the new plaque, 28 men had been buried in the grave, when there were a total of 45 or 46 men executed. A large wooden cross had been erected by unknown people at the site of the 1918 executions in Etel√§-Haaga, but it was taken away in the early 1930s. It was replaced twice, but finally taken away for good when the street Eliel Saarisen tie was built in the late 1940s.

Created in 2006 after the Government of Argentina rescinded the contract with \\"Aguas Argentinas\\", a corporate group that had granted concession during the Carlos Menem's administration in the 1990s. This way, 90% of the company remained under the control of the Ministry of the Interior, Public Works and Housing, later falling into the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works when it was reformed back into its own ministerial portfolio. AySA's operation area includes the Buenos Aires autonomous city and 25 partidos of Greater Buenos Aires.  History  =Background= In 1824 the government of Buenos Aires, under the administration of Bernardino Rivadavia, took out an international loan from Baring Brothers to build the port of Buenos Aires and the construction of a potable water system in the city. Nevertheless, those works were never carried out.El servicio p√∫blico de agua potable y saneamiento by CARLOS HERMANN G√úTTNER on InfoJus On July 18, 1912, \\"Obras Sanitarias de la Naci√≥n\\" (OSN) was established by Law 8,889 as part of the first Sanitation Plan of 1909 under the presidency of Roque S√°enz Pe√±a. OSN began to expand its area of operation, reaching cities outside Buenos Aires Province. By 1910, 14 capital cities of Argentina had a running water system, with four of them also including sewer system. After Per√≥n was deposed by the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora in 1955, the investments decreased abruptly, leaving the preventive maintenance behind. From then on, only urgent works were carried out, resulting in a deterioration of the service, also affected by the rampant inflation in the country. Since the 1960s, OSN associated with local cooperative companies that supply services to small cities (less than 50,000 people each), decentralising operations. In 1973, under the H√©ctor C√°mpora administration, a plant was built in General Belgrano to supply areas of the Buenos Aires south region. Works finished in 1975.Akhmouch A.

The line consists of 373 miles of track running from Baldwin, Florida (just west of Jacksonville) west through Tallahassee to Pensacola. The line also has a short branch from Tallahassee north to Attapulgus, Georgia. The line connects to CSX lines in Baldwin, Pensacola, and Attapulgus. The FG&A; began operation on June 1, 2019, after RailUSA acquired the line from CSX Transportation. The Jacksonville- Pensacola line was the route of the Gulf Wind streamliner from 1949 to 1971. After two decades of freight-only service, passenger service resumed in 1993 when the route of Amtrak's Sunset Limited was extended beyond New Orleans to Orlando. Amtrak service was suspended in 2005 due to damage to track and trestles by Hurricane Katrina, and has never resumed east of New Orleans. Lines and history Tallahassee station. The station was used by the Sunset Limited prior to 2005. The 373 miles of the Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad comprise the main line between Baldwin and Pensacola, as well as the Bainbridge Branch between Tallahassee and Attapulgus, connecting with CSX Transportation rails at each end of the line. CSX has trackage rights on the line but plans to use them only if their lines to the north are impassable. =Baldwin to Chattahoochee= The main line dates back to the mid-1800s. The line from Baldwin to Chattahoochee was first built as the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad from Lake City to Jacksonville in 1857. The Pensacola and Georgia Railroad built the line between Quincy and Lake City which was completed by 1863. The line would then be extended east to Chattahoochee to connect with the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad. In 1882, the lines were acquired by Sir Edward Reed, and were renamed together as the Florida Central and Western Railroad. Two years later, Reed brought the Florida Central and Western and several other Florida railroads he had purchased under the umbrella of what was named the Florida Railway and Navigation Company, which, in 1888, was renamed the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad (FC&P;). In 1900, a year after purchasing the majority of FC&P; stock, the newly organized Seaboard Air Line Railway (a predecessor of CSX Transportation) leased the FC&P; and, in 1903, acquired it outright. CSX previously operated this segment as their Tallahassee Subdivision. =Chattahoochee to Pensacola= The main line continues west from Chattahoochee to Pensacola, Florida. This segment of the main line was originally built in 1881-1883 by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, operating it as a subsidiary, the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad. William D. Chipley and Frederick R. De Funiak (General Manager of the L&N;), both of whom are commemorated in the names of towns later built along the P&A; line (Chipley and DeFuniak Springs), were among the founding officers of the P&A.; The line was merged into the L&N; in 1891. In 1982, the L&N; was merged into the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, which in 1986 became part of CSX Transportation, operating this segment as its P&A; Subdivision (a reference to the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad). =Bainbridge Branch= The Bainbridge Branch runs from the FGAR Mainline in Tallahassee north to Attapulgus, Georgia, where it connects to CSX's Bainbridge Subdivision, which continues north to Bainbridge, Georgia. The Bainbridge Subdivision was first built in 1901 by the Georgia Pine Railway. The line was only intended to be a shortline for logging, but since it provided an additional rail route from Georgia into Florida, traffic increased. As a result, the line was renamed the Georgia, Florida and Alabama Railway by the end of 1901. The GF&A; Railway bought the Carrabelle, Tallahassee and Georgia Railroad in 1906, which ran from Tallahassee south to Carrabelle. The Georgia, Florida and Alabama Railway, which extended from Richland, Georgia, to Carrabelle, Florida, at its greatest extent, became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1927. The Seaboard lines, after various other mergers, became part of CSX Transportation in 1986. This line was previously part of CSX's Bainbridge Subdivision. The line's milepost numbers begin in Tallahassee at 52 and increase from there. This is due to the fact that the numbering still reflects the line's full length to Carrabelle, which was mile 0 before the track between there and Tallahassee was abandoned.

The film received acclaim from critics, who praised the animation, story, voice acting and music. Premise Joe Gardner, a middle school music teacher, has long dreamed of performing jazz music onstage, and finally gets a chance after impressing other jazz musicians during an opening act at the Half Note Club. However, an untimely accident causes Gardner's soul to be separated from his body and begin to proceed to the Great Beyond, and Gardner escapes to the Great Before, a world where souls develop personalities, quirks, and traits before being sent off to Earth. There, Gardner must work with souls in training at the Great Before, such as 22, a soul with a dim view on the concept of life, in order to return to Earth before his body dies and also avoid a soul-counter named Terry, who goes to earth to find Joe and bring him back to the afterlife to meet her quota.

Production =Development= In January 2016, it was announced that Pete Docter, head of Pixar, was working on a new film. In June 2018, it was announced that Docter was planning to complete his film despite being appointed Chief Creative Officer at Pixar after John Lasseter's departure. In June 2019, Pixar announced a new film titled Soul with Docter directing and Dana Murray producing, with a synopsis released on Twitter about a cosmic journey through New York City. Murray said that the film will \\"(take audiences) to a world where no one's ever been, well, for a long time\\", while co-writer/co-director Kemp Powers said that it is \\"completely different\\" to Docter's previous films. Powers also said that the film will answer important questions in \\"a really fun way\\". Tina Fey also contributed to the screenplay, having helped to write her character's lines. Pixar chose to portray the film's main character as a musician, because they wanted a \\"profession the audience could root for\\", and settled for a musician after trying for a scientist, which \\"[didn't feel] so naturally pure as a musician's life\\". Docter described Soul as \\"an exploration of, where should your focus be? What are the things that, at the end of the day, are really going to be the important things that you look back on and go, 'I spent a worthy amount of my limited time on Earth worrying or focused on that'?\\". According to Docter, once they settled on the main character being a jazz musician, the filmmakers choose to make the character African-American, as they felt it made sense due to how closely African-Americans have been tied to jazz history.Soul - \\"Finding Soul\\" Conversation - Essence Festival Powers originally joined as co- writer early in development to help write the character of Joe, but he was ascended to co-director after his extensive contributions to the film, making him Pixar's first African-American co-director.'Soul' Producer Murray Reflects on Cannes-Selected Animated Feature Powers based several elements of Joe on his personal life, as the character's story shared several elements with Powers' own, but also wanted him to \\"trascend [his] own experience\\" in order to make the character more accessible. In order to portray accurately African- American culture within the film, the filmmakers hired several consultants with whom they worked closely with througth the film's development; among them were several Pixar employees, musicians Herbie Hancock, Terri Lyne Carrington and Jon Batiste, and stars Questlove and Daveed Diggs. =Casting= On August 24, 2019, Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, Questlove, Phylicia Rashad and Daveed Diggs were announced as starring in the film. Soul is Pixar's first film to feature an African-American protagonist. On March 17, 2020, Angela Bassett announced she was in the cast. On April 13, 2020, John Ratzenberger joined the voice cast. On May 4, 2020, Powers announced that Richard Ayoade joined the film's voice cast. On October 9, 2020, Graham Norton announced he was in the cast. Later that month, on October 15, Rachel House, Richard Ayoade, Alice Braga, Wes Studi, Fortune Feimster, Zenobia Shroff, Donnell Rawlings and June Squibb were announced to be in the cast. =Animation= The filmmakers animated the souls featured in the film in a \\"vaporous\\", \\"ethereal\\", and \\"non physical\\" way, having based their designs on definitions about souls given to them by various religious and cultural representatives. Docter described it as \\"a huge challenge\\", as the animators are \\"used to toys, cars, things that are much more substantial and easily referenced\\", though he felt the animation team \\"really put some cool stuff together that's really indicative of those words but also relatable\\". According to Murray, several artists helped create the souls' designs by giving their suggestions and opinions on how they should look.Creators of Pixar's 'Soul' share their vision Pixar animators created an \\"unprecedent\\" technique of line drawing to complete the film's screen image. According to co-director Kemp Powers, the animators used lighting as a way to indicate that there are characters of color in \\"The Great Before\\".Interview: How the directors of Pixar‚Äôs Soul artfully animated the afterlife Cinematographer Bradford Young worked as a lighting consultant on the film. Animators used footage of several music performers, including jazz composer Jon Batiste, performing as reference for the film's musical sequences. =Music= During the 2019 D23 Expo, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross were revealed to be composing the film's score, while Jon Batiste will be writing jazz songs for the film. Soul is also the first Pixar film directed by Docter since Monsters, Inc. (2001) not to scored by Michael Giacchino. Batiste composed jazz music for the film's New York City sequences, while Reznor and Ross wrote an instrumental score for the scenes taking place in \\"The Great Before\\". Batiste said that he wanted to create jazz music that felt \\"authentic\\", but also \\"accesible to all ages\\". He also wanted the themes to tie into the \\"ethereal nature\\" of \\"The Great Before\\" while still being on Earth. Batiste also sometimes worked with Reznor and Ross to \\"blend the two worlds, musically\\". Cody Chesnutt also wrote, produced, and performed an original song for the film, titled \\"Parting Ways\\".'Soul' Trailer: Pixar Sneaks 'Parting Ways' Song from Studio's First Black-Led Feature Batiste also arranged a new version of the song \\"It's All Right\\", originally performed by The Impressions, for the film.\\"Jazzy Pixar 'Soul' Song Debuts on 'Dancing With the Stars Release Soul was originally scheduled for theatrical release in the United States on June 19, 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed to November 20, 2020. This slot replaced Disney Animation's film Raya and the Last Dragon, whose release was delayed to March 12, 2021. On June 3, 2020, Soul was selected as part of the line-up for the 2020 Cannes Film Festival. On September 8, 2020, it was announced that the film would have its world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival on October 11, 2020. On September 15, 2020, Variety reported that Disney was considering the cancellation of the film's theatrical release replacing it with a premiere of the film on Disney+, though a Disney insider disputed the claim. On September 17, Soul was selected as part of the line-up for the Rome Film Festival, as the opening film on October 15, 2020. On September 23, amid a shuffle of release date changes from Disney, the studio announced that the film will stay theatrical on November 20. However, on October 8, 2020, Disney announced that the film's theatrical release had been cancelled altogether, and it would premiere exclusively on Disney+ on December 25, 2020. But it will play theatrically in countries where movie theaters have reopened and that don't have Disney+. Unlike Mulan, the film will not be released as a \\"premiere access\\" release, and will be free for all subscribers. A new 2D animated short film from Pixar's \\"SparkShorts\\" titled Burrow was initially announced to appear before the film had it premiered theatrically. On October 9, 2020, it was announced the short would also premiere on Disney+. That same day, it was announced the film would be the subject of a documentary chronicling Pixar's attempts to finish making the film during the pandemic. No further details were announced as to how and when it will be released. Reception On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, Soul has an approval rating of 100% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The site's critics consensus states, \\"A film as beautiful to contemplate as it is to behold, Soul proves Pixar's power to deliver outstanding all-ages entertainment remains undimmed.\\" According to Metacritic, which compiled nine reviews and calculated an average score of 94 out of 100, the film received \\"universal acclaim\\". Joe Utichi of Deadline Hollywood called the film \\"a joy to behold\\". Kaleem Aftab of IndieWire gave the film an \\"A‚Äì\\", calling it a \\"captivating journey\\" and writing: \\"Like some of the best jazz compositions, it uses a traditional framework to veer off in many unexpected directions, so that even the inevitable end point feels just right.\\" Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"peak Pixar\\" and \\"miles ahead and sublime in every sense\\", especially praised the soundtrack. Jason Solomons of TheWrap said the film \\"aims admirably high, yet ultimately can't quite fulfill the scale of its ambitions\\" but \\"it pops with colorful visuals and gentle wisdom while the story clips along despite the dizzying height of the concept.\\" References  External links   Category:2020 films Category:2020 comedy films Category:2020 computer-animated films Category:2020 fantasy films Category:2020s animated films Category:2020s American animated films Category:African-American animated films Category:African-American films Category:American 3D films Category:American computer-animated films Category:American films Category:American fantasy films Category:American ghost films Category:Animated films about death Category:Disney+ original films Category:English-language films Category:Films about the afterlife Category:Films directed by Pete Docter Category:Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films scored by Atticus Ross Category:Films scored by Trent Reznor Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films with screenplays by Pete Docter Category:Jazz films Category:Pixar animated films Category:Walt Disney Pictures films ","title":"Soul (2020 film)"},{"id":"61083245","text":"SP Books is an independent publishing house specialised in the publication of limited facsimile editions of literary manuscripts..SP Books: Manuscripts and prints - SP Books (Editions des Saints Peres) .Publishers Weekly: SP Books Finds Niche with Reproductions of Classic Manuscripts .Newsweek: The French publishing house bringing authors' manuscripts to life .

She was a gold medal winner in 1908 at the Moscow Conservatory and had a major performing career in Russia both as a soloist and in a chamber ensemble, the Luboshutz Trio, with her sister, the violinist Lea Luboshutz and her brother, the pianist Pierre Luboshutz. She was the first Soviet cellist to be awarded the title ‚ÄúHonored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.‚Äù Early life Born in Odessa, Ukraine, her first teacher was her father. Her mother supported the family by selling pianos. After graduating from the cello class of the Odessa Conservatory in 1903, Anna followed her sister Lea to the Moscow Conservatory and joined Alfred von Glehn's cello class in the fall of 1904. She also studied piano with Dmitri Veiss. Although she was recognized first and foremost as a cellist, her piano playing was distinguished enough that she accompanied some of the great artists of the day including the violinist Eugene Ysaye when he came to Moscow. While a student at the Conservatory, she became part of an all-female piano trio featuring her sister as violinist and Esther Chernetskaya as pianist (all three would end up as gold medal winners at the Conservatory). A patron, Evgenii Frantsevich Vitachek, was so impressed with her playing that he loaned her a Guadagnini cello while she was a student. Upon her graduation, Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov took up a collection and purchased the cello for her. Career When Chernetskaya decided to leave the trio, she was replaced briefly by another female pianist, Rosa Kaufman Pasternak, mother of the Nobel prize-winning writer, and the trio played at Leo Tolstoy's memorial in Moscow. Thereafter, Anna's brother, the pianist Pierre Luboshutz, took Rosa's place and the three siblings formed the Luboshutz Trio, an ensemble that performed throughout Russia including one tour in 1913-1914 that took them to over 50 cities. Anna also appeared regularly with the basso Fyodor Chaliapin and in concerts organized by Serge Koussevitzky. She also soloed with orchestras conducted by Arthur Nikisch and Emil Cooper. Following the Russian Revolution, Luboshutz decided to remain in the Soviet Union with her husband, Nikolai Shereshevsky, a distinguished physician who was treated well by the new regime. After the Revolution, she toured constantly throughout the Soviet Union performing not only in concert halls but in factories, aboard naval ships of the Northern Fleet, and even, on one occasion, deep underground in a coal mine in the Donats Basin region for the workers. When back in Moscow, she performed almost daily on radio, not only playing compositions for cello but also transcribing and performing works from her sister's violin repertoire. From 1931 to 1939, she was a regular soloist with the Moscow Philharmonic. In 1939, the Philharmonic honored her with an award which bore the inscription: ‚ÄúYou are an artist whose conscientiousness and commitment to her work serves as an example to others.‚Äù Her final concert was on February 19, 1947. Anna was the first Soviet cellist to be awarded the title ‚ÄúHonored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.‚Äù With it came special status, a lifetime stipend, and the right to be buried in the cemetery at the Novodevichy Monastery, the most honored burial place in Moscow. Anna was also honored at a gala event in Moscow on January 22, 1969, after her eightieth birthday. The host for the evening was the leading Soviet cellist of the time, Mstislav Rostropovich. A musical family Luboshutz's sister Lea was a celebrated violinist who emigrated to the United States and taught at the Curtis Institute of Music. Her brother Pierre Luboshutz formed a well-known duo-piano team with his wife Genia Nemenoff. Her nephew, Boris Goldovsky, started his career as a pianist but became an opera impresario and teacher.

With this machine 11 GPs, 2 Driver Championships and 2 manufacturers World Championships were won. History MV Agusta had started participating in road racing with motorcycles in the late 1940s and initially concentrated on the 125 and 500 cc classes. Piero Remor built the 125 \\"Bialbero\\" (\\"twin-cam\\") for the 125 cc class. The machine was subsequently bored to 175 cc because that class was still very popular in Italy and almost all major brands built production racers for it. The 175 cc machine was further bored to slightly above 200cc, so that in 1955 it was possible to compete in the 250cc class with the MV Agusta 203 Bialbero. After one race the capacity was further increased to 220cc. With that machine, Bill Lomas completed the 1955 season, finishing in third place in the World Championship. MV Agusta also won the constructor's title. In 1956, a new single-cylinder was developed from the 220 with a fully-fledged 250 cc engine: the MV Agusta 250 Monocilindrica Bialbero. This machine was good for the world title of 1956, but in 1957 they had to bow their heads to FB Mondial. Tarquinio Provini became world champion on the Mondial 250 Bialbero. Development The 250 Biclindrica (\\"two-cylinder\\") was developed in the new department in Cascina Costa, a neighbourhood in the south of Samarate in response to the dominance of the Mondial 250 Bialbero. This was the first racer that MV Agusta had developed entirely by itself. The single-cylinder still had all the characteristics of the pre-war Benelli 250 and the four- cylinder models were based on the Gilera 500 4C. The machine was first used at the 1957 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps by John Hartle, who won the race. After Roberto Colombo died during practice at Spa, MV Agusta withdrew from the 250 cc class for the rest of the season, so the machine was not used again that year. The fall of 1957 proved be a turning point for world road racing championships. All major Italian brands (Mondial, Moto Guzzi, Gilera and MV Agusta) decided to withdraw en bloc from the World Championships. The costs of racing were huge and disproportionate to the sales. For Moto Guzzi and Gilera this was especially so, because their income was solely from motorcycle sales. Mondial was able to make some money with transport tricycles and for Agusta, motorcycle production was still more a hobby than a profession. Count Domenico Agusta reversed his decision and continued the racing activities. Without other factory competition for the 1958 season, MV Agusta elected to use the tried and tested single-cylinder. Tarquinio Provini won four of the six 250 cc races that season and became a world champion by a huge margin, and MV won the Constructors Championship. The twin-cylinder machine was used by the works riders of Carlo Ubbiali and Tarquinio Provini for the 1959 season. Some privateers competed on the older single-cylinder machine. Technical data The engine was very slim. It was an air-cooled, twin-cylinder, four-stroke engine with double overhead camshafts (DOHC). The camshafts were driven by a gear train. The valves had diameters of 34 mm (inlet) and 32 mm (outlet) and had an angle of 90 ¬∞ between them. The cylinders were tilted 5 ¬∞ forward. The engine had a bore and stroke of 53 mm √ó 56 mm. Engine power was 36 bhp at 12,500 rpm, an improvement over the 250 single's 29 bhp. That was a very high end speed for that time and many experts thought that the engine would not be reliable using so many revs. A wet sump lubrication system was used and the ignition system was by ignition coil. Two Dell'Orto SS 31 A carburetors were used. A dry multi-plate was driven by gears from the crankshaft. The gearbox had six or seven gears, dependent on circuit, and was of the cassette type. Final drive was by chain. The machine was extremely slim, and probably developed by Arturo Magni. The frame, a chrome molybdenum double cradle, exhibited all the characteristics of Magni's later frames. The tube diameter was 25 mm √ó 1.2 mm. The front fork was a telescopic fork, and the rear suspension was swingarm with hydraulic shock absorbers. 210 mm drum brakes were used front and rear, the front being Results ;1957 The machine was only entered in one race in 1957, the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps, which John Hartle won on the 250 Bicilindrica. ;1959 In the opening race of the season, the Lightweight TT, Tarquinio Provini won with Carlo Ubbiali second, less than 1/2 second behind. Ubbiali won the next race at Hockenheimring, followed by Provini winning at the TT Circuit Assen.Tarquinio Provini career statistics at MotoGP.com Ubbiali also won the final race, the Nations Grand Prix at Monza. Ubbiali became world champion and Provini runner up. MV Agusta won the 250 cc Constructors Championship. ;1960 For the 1960 season, Provini left to ride for Moto Morini and was replaced by Gary Hocking.Gary Hocking career statistics at MotoGP.com Hocking convincingly won the first race of the season at the Isle of Man, Ubbiali, in second place, was over a minute behind. The 1 - 2 was reversed at Assen and Spa with Ubbiali winning both. The situation reversed again the German GP at the Solituderennen where Hocking came out on top. Ubbiali won the final two rounds (Ulster and Monza) the become World Champion, with Hocking runner-up. MV Agusta again won the 250 cc Constructors Championship. ;1961 Carlo Ubbiali retired at the end of the 1960 season, leaving Hocking as the sole MV Agusta rider in the 1961 season. Hocking won the first race at the Montju√Øc circuit in Spain, and retired in the Lightweight TT. The rest of the season was dominated by Mike Hailwood on the 4-cylinder Honda RC162.Mike Hailwood career statistics at MotoGP.com MV Agusta withdrew from the 250 cc class. ;1966 In February 1966, Giacomo Agostini rode the machine to victory in a non-championship race in Spain.

However, rumours of a Leeds based team playing out of the 1800 capacity Planet Ice Leeds arena were circulating months beforehand. In joining the league, they became the first ever hockey team to play out of the city. The Chiefs name was selected by Planet Ice following the results of a fan poll. The 'Chiefs' moniker won the poll, results of which were announced on 16 May 2019, having beaten the alternatives; Cotton Kings and Mighty Mammoths. Former Whitley Warriors Defenceman Sam Zajac was announced as Player-coach of the team on 10 May, 2019. Zajac's first signing for the Chiefs was former Manchester Phoenix captain, Defenceman Luke Boothroyd. In November 2019, head coach Sam Zajac launched an urgent appeal after a large amount of the team's equipment was stolen from an apartment block in Batley. This included new helmets that hadn't even been worn yet, along with sticks and gloves used by the players all season. Despite this, the Chiefs confirmed their weekend games would go ahead as planned via a statement on Twitter. In their first National League season, the Chiefs finished 10th. They won 13 games, losing 36, achieving 28 points overall. The season was curtailed in March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first five months of the season, the Chiefs were required to play home games elsewhere, due to a delay in the opening of their rink. The first game at their Elland Road arena was against Sheffield Steeldogs on 31 January 2020.

At the orders of the investigating judge, he was in charge of investigating the Municipal Newspaper Archive of Madrid, noting the names of writers and journalists together with comments on the character of the alleged crimes that they would have committed in their literary pieces. In addition, he was a member of several courts martial related to the Special Press Court, highlighting the one against the poet Miguel Hern√°ndez, sentenced to death in March 1940 - a sentence which was later commuted to 30 years in prison. Baena Toc√≥n figured as secretary of the same, despite not having the necessary qualifications for it, having passed only a few law courses. In June 1966, Baena Toc√≥n was appointed Comptroller of the City Council of C√≥rdoba, position he held until his retirement.

Secretly, the cults have come together to unleash an unknown catastrophic force. These cults are devoted to the Princes of Elemental Evil and serve the Elder Elemental Eye. Each cult is led by a prophet: * The air cult, Cult of the Howling Hatred, is led by the elf princess Aerisi Kalinoth * The earth cult, Cult of the Black Earth, is led by the male medusa Marlos Urnrayle * The fire cult, Cult of the Eternal Flame, is led by the tiefling Vanifer * The water cult, Cult of the Crushing Wave, is led by the sailor Gar Shatterkeel This campaign takes characters from level 1 through level 15 as adventurers battle the elemental cults across the North and work to uncover their true agenda. It is set in the Forgotten Realms year 1491 DR.

A ghost kitchen contains the kitchen equipment and facilities needed for the preparation of restaurant meals but has no dining area for walk-in customers. Restaurants that use ghost kitchens may have a different physical location for walk-in customers, or may be a delivery-only ghost restaurant. A ghost kitchen differs from a ghost restaurant in that a ghost kitchen is not necessarily a restaurant brand in itself and may contain kitchen space and facilities for more than one restaurant brand. Terminology A ghost kitchen may also be known as a delivery kitchen, virtual kitchen, shadow kitchen, commissary kitchen, dark kitchen, ghost line, or cloud kitchen.  Background  Ghost kitchens have emerged as a business model in response to the rapid growth in consumer demand for restaurant delivery meals, and the lower costs incurred by using kitchen facilities located outside of high-rent, high-foot-trafficked urban locations. In addition to equipped kitchen space, ghost kitchen operators can offer point of sale and ordering software that accommodates various delivery platforms (GrubHub, UberEats, DoorDash, e.g.) and dedicated parking areas for delivery drivers. Using a ghost kitchen allows established restaurants with dining-in service to expand their delivery operations without adding stress to the existing kitchen, frees up parking taken by the delivery vehicles, and allows them to enter new neighborhoods at lower cost.

Tepper, published in 2000. It describes Earth's contact with a confederation of intelligent alien races. The Fresco was on the shortlist (\\"honor list\\") for 2001 James Tiptree, Jr. Award Plot Multiple alien races have discovered Earth. Two members of one of those races, ‚ÄúChiddy‚Äù and ‚ÄúVess‚Äù of the Pistach, approach Benita Alvarez-Shipton and ask her to carry a device to the authorities that will communicate their message. Benita uses this as an opportunity to escape her abusive husband. The device ultimately reaches the U. S. President, and the Pistach envoys arrange a personal meeting with him. Having noticed Earth's forays into space, the Pistach envoys have been sent to evaluate Earth for membership in a confederation of intelligent races. Failing to qualify for membership exposes Earth to sequestration from space travel and predation by the three other races that have become aware of Earth. The envoys point out some issues that Earth needs to resolve and then take various actions to assist with those problems. The envoys also insist that Benita act as their official intermediary. Throughout the book, one of the envoys, Chiddy, explains the history of Pistach and their religion in journal entries. The Pistach religion and way of life are driven by the stories revealed in the eponymous Fresco, a series of seventeen painted panels. Age and soot and grime have darkened the panels beyond recognition, so the Pistach rely on the Compendium which contains annotated copies of the Fresco panels. When rebel Pistach take possession of the Fresco and clean the panels, it is revealed that the stories told in the Compendium are contradicted by the actual paintings, threatening the entire body of principles on which Pistach society is based. To prevent the Pistach from withdrawing their protection of Earth, Benita and a group of artists from Earth put the Pistach to sleep with sarsparilla and secretly repaint the panels to be in accordance with the Compendium. The changes to the panels are acclaimed a miracle. Theme Tepper uses the contrasts between Earth religions and the Pistach religion to explore the emergence of male-dominated religions. In Aliens in Popular Culture, Edward James observes that Tepper's satire explores the \\"take me to your leader\\" trope.

Behavior New colonies are typically founded by a male-female pair, but alternatively sometimes by a same-sex female pair, in which case reproduction is parthenogenetic.

These male pairs of termites cannot reproduce, but by cooperating they are able to survive long enough that one or both has the potential to later replace a male in another colony. This male can then reproduce by mating with the female there . The queen is succeeded by asexual reproduction, in which an aged queen lays eggs with no openings for sperm to enter through, effectively making a clone of herself .

One of them, a young woman of 22, who was the target of the attack, died more than a month later in the hospital. The attacker was identified as Carlos Hualpa Vacas, who belonged to the victim's work environment.  Attack  It was around seven o'clock at night., and a man with covered with a hood and dark glasses got on the bus and he sat on the back of the vehicle. Then got up and moved forward three seats to spray a fuel a woman who was sitting and after set fire to her, which also reached at least 10 other passengers, and finally escaped the scene by burning him- self arm a little.  Investigation  The testimonies of the witnesses, the recordings of the security cameras, as well as a clue given by the sister of the mortal victim helped to find the author of this fact. Hualpa Vacas had asked absent him-self from his job the day after the attack because his arm was burned. This coincides with the version of the bus driver, who said that the author of the attack fled with his limb on fire, a crucial detail. The bus driver also said that Hualpa Vacas had his head covered with a green hood and dark glasses; Other witnesses added that he was wearing a black backpack. The security cameras of the area captured a person with these characteristics. The victim's sister had received a warning message before the attack. She had asked him to wait for her at the bus station, because she was afraid of \\"a man named Javier who was chasing her\\". The police went to the workplace of Hualpa Vacas, which he had to enter at 9:00 a.m, but when they knew he was on leave because the previous night had suffered an accident, they reinforced his hypothesis. When Hualpa Vacas peeked out at the door of his house he was intervened and immediately reduced, and it was confirmed that he had a burn on his left hand and forearm, as reported by the driver of the bus in which the attack occurred. In his testimony to the Police, Hualpa revealed in detail his plan. And according to the policemen who questioned him, without showing any remorse. Hualpa Vacas wanted to justify his actions and pointed out that he did not want to kill Eyvi √Ågreda if not \\"just disfigure her\\" and that he had planned the attack long time ago, so a month earlier he bought the gasoline in a yogurt bottle, but it had no value for execute it. One of the versions that he formulated is that he had injured himself cooking in his house; but he also said that he burned himself because he was very nervous when he realized that his name was given as a suspect. \\"When nobody had mentioned it with certainty and we had only given his second name,\\" one of the policemens explained. The truth is that he could not say where he was treated for the burn he presents, which is bandaged after application of a substance, probably to relieve pain. This case received extensive media coverage, both for the number of victims of this attack and for the way in which Eyvi was attacked. This was a representative case of the high numbers of murders of women registered in Peru.  Reactions  * C√©sar Villanueva, president of Ministers Council, tweeted: \\"The National Police is in full investigation of the facts to find the person responsible for this attack, we are going to incorporate the most drastic measures to solve this problem, which is so unacceptable, that it is acts of violence against women\\".

M. Guffey Petroleum Company, with intention of transporting oil and petroleum products to ports along the East Coast of the United States and Europe. In January 1914 the tanker ran into a gale and broke in two and sank with a loss of twenty six men. Design and Construction Early in 1907 J. M. Guffey Petroleum Co. following planned expansion of their pipeline system from Oklahoma to Port Arthur, decided to add a large tanker of approximately 10,000 deadweight to its existing fleet of older vessels, enlarging their oil carrying capabilities. A contract for this vessel was awarded to the New York Shipbuilding Co. and Oklahoma was laid down at the builder's shipyard in Camden (yard number 53) and launched on 29 February 1908, with Miss Mildred Fessenden Taber of New York City, daughter of George H. Taber, general manager of the J. M. Guffey Co., serving as the sponsor. The ship was of the spar-deck type and had two main decks. The ship was equipped with wireless of De Forest type and submarine signal system, and had electrical lights installed along the decks. The tanker had her hold subdivided into sixteen cargo tanks fitted for carrying oil in bulk with a total capacity of approximately 2,520,000 gallons and had a cargo pump room with two duplex pumps located just aft of the main oil tanks. In addition, the tanker had eight extra compartments on the wings, with two of them being designed to carry freight cargo and the other six served as summer oil tanks. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, and had a depth of . Oklahoma was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 9,800. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom extending under her forepeak and boiler room, and a single 424 Nhp (3,200 ihp) vertical triple expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three single-ended Scotch boilers fitted for coal. At the time of her construction the vessel was one of the biggest tankers ever built in the United States. The sea trials were held from April 11 through April 13, during which the tanker was able to achieve top speed of , about 3/4 of a knot over her contractual speed. After successful completion of the sea trials, Oklahoma was turned over to her owners approximately a week later and officially commissioned on April 25. Operational history After delivery to her owners the tanker loaded a full cargo of petroleum consigned to the Anglo-American Oil Company and departed Philadelphia for United Kingdom on 7 May 1908. After reaching and unloading her cargo at Belfast on May 21 and Dublin on May 23, the ship sailed back to Philadelphia arriving there on June 8, thus successfully completing her maiden voyage. On her second trip to England in June 1908 the tanker grounded on the upper end of Tinicum Island while travelling down Schuylkill River with a cargo of 2,400,000 gallons of oil, but was able to refloat herself on the rising tide and proceed to her destination. After two more trips from Philadelphia, the tanker was reassigned to a different route and started carrying oil from Port Arthur to United Kingdom for the remainder of 1908. Starting in 1909 Oklahoma was put on a domestic coastal route carrying oil and petroleum products from Gulf ports of Port Arthur and Beaumont to refineries in Philadelphia and New York. She continued serving this route without interruptions for the remainder of her career. On 4 January 1911 while attempting to dock in Port Arthur the tanker rammed and cut in half the barge Saratoga belonging to the Texas Company also causing minor damage to the wharf totaling in excess of 10,000. In October 1910 Oklahoma became a center of a wireless hoax, when multiple vessels and shore stations picked up a wireless call for help pretending to be coming from her. Several ships searched for presumably stricken tanker including revenue cutter but found no trace of the ship. The cutter finally was able to contact Oklahoma next day who was way down south on her way to Port Arthur and reported that everything was normal and they never sent a distress call. =Sinking= Oklahoma departed for her last voyage from New York in ballast on 3 January 1914 bound for Port Arthur. The tanker was under command of captain Alfred Gunther, had a crew of thirty eight men and also had on board one passenger, captain Loring A. Cates, who was on his way to Port Arthur to assume command of another Gulf Refining vessel. The ship was heading first to the Delaware Breakwater to pick up a barge and resume her trip down south. In the evening of January 3 the tanker ran into a very strong nor'easter of the New Jersey coast, with winds averaging and gusts up to . The same storm devastated a seashore community of Seabright causing over 1,000,000 in damages. As the storm raged, Oklahoma maintained her engines running so she would not be driven towards the shore. At around 07:30 on January 4, as captain Gunther was giving the ship's position to the wireless operator (believed to be approximately ), a huge wave swept over the side of the vessel breaking her in two with the stern being swung around and laying alongside the bow. Thirty two men were trapped on the stern as it started to fill quickly. Two lifeboats were quickly lowered, one containing approximately 20 men commandeered by captain Cates, and another with eleven men in it. Captain Gunther and seven other crewmen were left on the bow section of the tanker, which continued to float and showed no signs of sinking. Both lifeboats drifted away from the wreck leaving captain Gunther and seven crewmen alone on the ship bow. At about 15:00 on January 4 Spanish steamer SS Manuel Calvo noticed a floating derelict and closed in to investigate. An attempt was made to lower a lifeboat but as soon as it was lowered, a high wave came in and smashed the lifeboat against the ship's side injuring three men in the process. Due to continuing strong winds and rough seas still present in the area nothing could be accomplished and the vessel left after about an hour of trying. At approximately 05:00 on January 5 German steamer SS Bavaria noticed distress signals and by about 08:00 approached the wreck. By then, the weather had subsided significantly allowing Bavaria to lower a lifeboat and take off all eight men from the fore section of the tanker. British steamer SS Tenadores also arrived at the scene as Bavaria was finishing up the rescue operation and stood by until all survivors were safely on board the German vessel. One lifeboat with eleven men in it was spotted at around 13:20 on January 4 by a lookout from Booth Line steamer SS Gregory. The lifeboat had a sail hoisted which helped to keep it from being overwhelmed by the waves. However, as soon as survivors noticed Gregory they dropped the sail and their boat almost immediately capsized. Three officers from the Booth liner jumped in the water and managed to bring back six survivors, with one of them dying from exposure on the deck of the steamer. In response to a radiogram sent by the steamer Manuel Calvo in the late afternoon of January 4, the US Coast Guard cutter was dispatched from Newport to help the sinking vessel. The cutter had to fight through the same gale as Oklahoma which slowed her down considerably. At around 16:00 on January 5 a lifeboat was spotted with a man sitting upright in it. A surfboat was launched by Seneca and a man and two dead bodies were recovered from the waterlogged lifeboat. An attempt was made to resuscitate a man for two hours on board the cutter but he never regained consciousness. In the afternoon of January 6 Seneca located the upside-down floating fore section wreck of Oklahoma about southeast from the Fenwick Island Lightship. After examining it and determining that it could not be safely towed, mines were attached to the body of the wreck, but they failed to explode. As it was getting dark, the cutter decided to stand by waiting for daybreak. In the morning of January 7 it was decided not to use mines and instead the cutter fired sixteen shots from her rapid-fire six-pounder guns causing the wreck to rapidly sink in approximately of water. Subsequent investigation into the wrecking of Oklahoma established that her loss was unavoidable when her bow and stern were both buoyed up by high seas causing the ship to break in two. In addition, a lack of law controlling and standardizing vessel construction was blamed for the wreck.

Consisting of 100 townhomes, Scotland community's roots date back to the late 19th century, when former slaves bought land in Potomac.  Background  Beginning in the late 1870s and through the 1880s, former slaves began to take ownership of what would become the Scotland property. Two principal early families were the Masons and Doves, with descendants still living in the community. This was one of about 40 communities former slaves formed in Montgomery County. Today, these historic African American enclaves include Lincoln Park in Rockville, Ken-Gar in Kensington, Tobytown in Potomac, Stewartown and Emory Grove in Gaithersburg, and Lyttonsville in Silver Spring. Known as \\"Snakes Den\\" until the 1920s, Scotland's approximately 50 families provided a pool of inexpensive labor for nearby farmers. With declining agriculture, many of the men of the community were laborers, drivers, trash collectors and golf caddies for wealthy whites, while women such as Geneva Mason were seamstresses, cooks, maids and baby sitters for white families in the area.Nikki Hauspurg, \\"Save Our Scotland: An oral history with Joyce B. Siegel\\", Dreyfuss Library, St. Andrew's Episcopal School; OH HAU, 2004 In 1927, the community was strengthened with the addition of a Rosenwald School. The community continued to suffer due to segregation and discrimination even as surrounding areas began a transition from farming communities into housing and other developments. While surrounding (almost entirely) white communities were built, Scotland remained without water, electricity, and had unpaved roads into the 1960s. In the mid-1960s, community efforts led to a 100 townhouse (75 rented, 25 privately owned) development and the institution of community self- governance which continues to this date. In 2014, the community center was renovated and in 2018 the 75 rental properties underwent a major renovation and upgrade.  Save Our Scotland  As Scotland's infrastructure remained undeveloped and the housing stock deteriorated, by the early 1960s, housing and other development activities were pressuring the Scotland community. Speculators sought to buy land for potential housing developments and Montgomery County sought land to create and expand Cabin John Park. Once stretching miles along Seven Locks Road, by 1964 the community had just 48 acres with 35 homes described as \\"shacks\\", with 23 condemned. In fall 1964, Scotland's future \\"looked bleak\\" as the Inverness North townhouse development would pave over the stream that was the community's primary water source. Geneva Mason (L) and Joyce Siegel (R) with Scotland zoning sign (Photo: Alan R. Siegel, courtesy of Montgomery History) In 1964, Joyce B. Siegel -- \\"a young, white Bethesda woman\\"‚Äîbecame engaged with the Scotland community. > It looked like Scotland would quietly disappear until a seemingly > unimportant event occurred just before Christmas of 1964. Onto the scene > came Mrs. Joyce Siegel, a housewife from nearby Bethesda, who drove up to > deliver a load of toys for Scotland's children. It was Siegel's first look > at the community, and she was horrified by what se saw and heard. Siegel soon began to mobilize support across the broader Montgomery County communities to \\"Save Our Scotland\\" with a formal committee structure created in February 1965 (with Scotland residents (such as Geneva Mason), ministers, and Mrs. Siegel on its board of directors). Save Our Scotland built heavily on faith communities. > \\"We just feel that it is basically morally wrong for affluent people, real- > estate operators, and others, to drive these people out of houses just > because they do not have enough money and because their skin is not white.\\" > Rev. Carl Pritchett, Pastor, Bethesda Presbyterian Church, President, Save > Our Scotland, 1966 . The group leveraged the human resources of the Washington, D.C., area: many current or former Federal employees volunteered their time bringing critical expertise to navigate emergent challenges in what was a rather complex set of processes over time. To secure government grants, Scotland Community Develop, Inc, formed. A $78,400 grant funded legal and other support for designing a plan for adequate housing in Scotland. The resulting plan required numerous land actions, Federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) financing, and razing the existing homes. As an indication of the complexity of the process, 26 citizens' associations were convinced to support the necessary rezoning. After many years of extended struggle, negotiation, and planning, the Scotland Development Corporation took control of land and built 100 townhouses (25 owned and 75 rental) on ten acres in the late 1960s and early 1970s to replace the deteriorating existing housing stock. > Robert Weaver visits Scotland (for groundbreaking?)

For example, the Architectural Forum magazine devoted a five-page spread to Scotland. The Scotland Community Development had impacts beyond Scotland, itself. Members testified in front of the U.S. Senate committee for a rent-supplement program that had been created to help the Scotland community. Members also testified to the Maryland General Assembly for tax exemptions for housing non-profits. These still existed decades later. The Scotland community, which includes a community center\\"Tour of Scotland Community Center\\", Montgomery County Parks Department video about the Bette Carole Thompson Community center, July 8, 2015 (2013-14 renovated LEED Gold Recreation Center), is self-governed by the Scotland Community Civic Association. In 2018, the 75 rental units underwent a $14 million renovation program. = Not just about housing stock = The Save Our Scotland effort and the resulting external engagement sought to support the Scotland community. For example, a study hall began in the community's church basement. By 1966, this was open three nights a week and half the community's school children attended each session. When this started, this was almost solely assistance from outside the community but the outside volunteers supported Scotland parents as they took over supervising the tutoring.  Plans to Prosper You exhibit  In June 2019, the American University Museum opened the Plans to Prosper You summer exhibit focused on three African American communities (Tobytown, Mesopotamia, and Scotland) in Montgomery County. This exhibit includes oral histories of Scotland residents, memorabilia from the Scotland Eagles from the regional Negro baseball league, and photos/background related to the Save Our Scotland activity.

On 5 February 1920 the decree was represented by the minister Carlo Ferraris and on the next 25 June it was represented again by the minister Arturo Labriola of Giolitti V Cabinet. It was converted only in 1923 through a decree giving law force to the provision. The entity was renamed as Cassa nazionale per le assicurazioni sociali ('National Fund for Social Insurances). A \\"Personal Booklet\\" issued by the CNAS office of left The Mussolini Cabinet changed the National Fund into the Istituto nazionale fascista della previdenza sociale ('National Fascist Institute of Social Security') or INFPS. Its first president was Giuseppe Bottai, succeeded in 1935 by Bruno Biagi. Subsequent interventions made by Italian lawmakers expanded significantly the purposes of the institute to which were assigned the management of first interventions in benefit of the income already in 1939. In 1944 the institute became the Istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale, a public entity with legal personality and autonomous management. During the period 1968‚Äì1972, the Italian State introduced retirement pensions and social pensions for every citizen over 65 years and under a certain income threshold. The extraordinary wage supplementation fund and early retirement were introduced along with tax relieves for the production. In 1978 the National Healthcare Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) was established and INPS had been charged of collecting illness contributions and pay the related benefits. The law n. 88 of 9 March 1989 had reformed INPS and financially divided the assistance from the social security. Since the nineties various social security institutions of category, managers and some professional orders, have been merged into INPS, with the assumption by the latter of the related debts and savings on administrative costs, deriving from pension management by a single body. Since 1992, reforms had been oriented to contain the social security bubble caused by the generous reforms of the seventies such as baby pensions, retirement pensions and inflated pensions. In 1995 the separated management was introduced, obligatory for autonomous and para-subordinated workers.  Description  = Funding system = INPS gives pensions and other social security services with taxes derived for about the 70% from mandatory contributions for obligatory insurances and for the remaining 30% through direct transfers by the State. The law decree n. 201 of 6 December 2011, known as \\"Salva Italia\\" (Saving Italy), ordered the incorporation of INPDAP and ENPALS into the INPS, transferring to it the related functions and increasing the number of subscribers on INPS funds to the 95% of Italian workers. With this new law, the transition from the corporative social security model to the universal one started with the Dini reform has been confirmed. = Administration = Vittorio Conti had been president of INPS since 1¬∫ February 2014 as commissioner after the resignation of Antonio Mastrapasqua. On 1¬∫ October 2014, Tiziano Treu became president as extraordinary commissioner. On 24 December 2014, former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced the nominee of the economist Tito Boeri as new president of INPS. During the Council of Ministers of 21 May 2019, Pasquale Tridico has been chosen as the president of INPS. = Name in minority languages of Italy = In the Italian regions where there is bilingualism, the name and abbreviation of INPS are translated: * In Aosta Valley, bilingual Italian/French, Institut national de la pr√©voyance sociale (INPS) * In South Tyrol, bilingual Italian/German, Nationalinstitut f√ºr Soziale F√ºrsorge (NISF)  Activities  = Social security administration and management = INPS Legal medical centre in Milan. The main activity of INPS consists on providing pensions and other services of social security to who has the right. It also does contributory activity collecting the contributions. The services are based on a mandatory insurance relationship and are funded with the contributions of employed workers, elaborated as a percentage of the wage. = Management of services supporting income = Along with pensions, the institute pays all the services supporting the income such as: * Unemployment benefits * Benefits for sick leave * Benefits for maternity leave * Allowances to the family unit * Interventions of ordinary and extraordinary wage supplementation fund * Interventions of the guarantee fund for severance packages * Interventions against tuberculosis * Interventions for spa healthcare * Mobility allowances * Interventions for rural unemployment * Interventions according to law n. 104 of 2 May 1990 * Payment for assistance services provided by the comune (check after the third son) * ISEEIndicator of the equivalent economic situation. declarations * Management of medical control visits for private workers * Management of authorizations for the right to the allowances to the family unit = Welfare = \\"Welfare\\" pensions (civil disability, integration of pension at minimal treatment, social check) are considered as welfare state interventions and they are managed by INPS outside an insurance relationship. These pensions are mostly funded by public financings for INPS. = Inspection = The vigilance activity of INPS is aimed to control the precise payment of contributions according to the law as well as the compliance with the mandatory rules in benefit of the employee. Already required by law n. 483 of 14 November 1992, this kind of activity has been regulated by INPS itself. The main purposes are the contrast to the contributive evasion, unreported employment and undue receipt of social security benefits. INPS issues an annual operative plan tending to the fight against unreported employment and to the systematic control of regularity in payments and the contributive fairness (using the benefits) of the various subjects required to pay contributions. This plan premises an accurate analysis of the territory aimed to target the intervention areas and the kind of companies at high risk of evasion, as well as to define the commodity sectors to be considered for an inspection. New elements regarding the planning process have been introduced, increasing the effectiveness of the inspective action done by the institute. The new planning process of the supervision plan foresees a strong interaction with the regional headquarters which can suggest specific hypothesis of inspective action within their competence. INPS performs often its inspective action jointly with labour inspectors, the Command of the Carabinieri for job tutelage, as well as INAIL, the Service for prevention and security in workplaces of public local healthcare companies and the Guardia di Finanza. = Other activities = INPS performs other activities related to its competences, including: * Medical visits for ascertaining disability and inability, as well as for the access to spa treatments through agreements with local companies * Management of databases related to the calculation of the indicator of the equivalent economic situation which allows the use of some benefits in social services * Required activities for the withdrawal of contributions, including the subscription of companies, the opening of an insurance account for employed and autonomous workers, the denounce of the report regarding housework and the release of the insurance account and certification statement * Granting a certified email address to all the users subscribed on the official website of INPS.  Publishing  INPS issues the quarterly journal Informazione previdenziale, edited by the advocacy of the institute and dedicated to the issues about work rights and social security.  Legal aspects  INPS, as a public entity, does not declare profits and it is based on a solidarity agreement between generations. The solidarity aim and the absence of profit do not configure INPS as a company. The social security is managed by a public entity according to the Italian Constitution. However, the \\"private-sector assistance may be freely provided\\" but the article means that the social security tutelage for workers represents a fundamental purpose of the Italian State according to its Constitution. This kind of social security organization based on public entities complies with the principles of European community rights. The Court of Justice of the European Union has stated that a legal monopoly of social security entrusted to public entities does not represent an abuse of dominant position at all and therefore it is not disputable before the antitrust authorities according to the article 86 of the EU Treaty. Reports of the European Union declare the right to assistance and social security in the event of old age, without any specification if this right has to be secured by the State or private entities. The right to social security in the event of old age has not a specific or dedicated regulation but it is combined with the protection in cases like maternity, illness or accidents at work.

A total of 45 persons suspected of belonging to the Red Guards were executed by German troops at a bog at 8 o‚Äôclock p.m. at the site of the present Eliel Saarisen tie, halfway from the Pit√§j√§nm√§ki roundabout to the tunnel leading to the Huopalahti Station, at the site of a pedestrian crossing. 28 of those executed were buried in the Pohjois-Haaga mass grave, which is located close to the current Pohjois-Haaga railway station. During the Battle of Helsinki, the German Baltic Sea Division advanced on 11 April to Lepp√§vaara, Espoo. A group of Reds sought shelter in the cellar of Carl Theodor Ward‚Äôs garden in South Haaga, at 12 Vanha Viertotie. When the Germans arrived there, shots were exchanged, and two German soldiers were killed. The executions were said to be a retaliation for this. According to another version, shots were fired at the car of the German commander R√ºdiger von der Goltz, and the executions were a revenge for this. During the night, the cellar became a prison, and while some Reds were allowed to go free, others were brought there in their place. The Reds were interrogated through interpreters, but not for long, as the Germans wanted to move on. 25 male prisoners were handed over to the Finnish Whites, and rest of the male prisoners were ordered to form a line by the near-by road, and every third was selected to be executed. They were ordered to march to a near-by bog, where the Germans shot them. After that the families of the victims were allowed to identify them and take them to be buried. The rest of the bodies, most likely people not from Helsinki or the Rural Municipality, were loaded on to carts driven by horses and taken a couple of kilometres away to be buried in a pit that had been dug in connection of the building of Krepost Sveaborg. A modest wooden cross was erected at the site of the executions, but it was lost when a road was constructed at the site. Afterwards, the Finns blamed the Germans for the events, and vice versa. The local Workers‚Äô Association did not want to study the events, and in addition, its minutes for 1916‚Äì18 had disappeared. They were found in ca. 2008 in Turku, in the archives of √Öbo Akademi. The names of 24 or 25 of those executed are known, but the names of 20 victims are still not known. In 1920, the bodies in the North Haaga mass grave were exhumed, and the Estonians present thought they identified the body of their former Estonian Deputy Prime Minister J√ºri Vilms. According to the story the Estonians told at the time, Vilms and his retinue had been in Suursaari, where the Germans allegedly had captured them and brought them to Helsinki on a ship named Regina and then shot them at the T√∂√∂l√∂ Sugar Factory and then buried them in the North Haaga mass grave. Vilms had been a conspicuously tall man, and such a man was found in the grave. Three bodies were then transported to Estonia and buried in Viljandi County. Later it turned out that the Regina had not been to Suursaari or even moved anywhere from Helsinki during that spring. In the 2000s the idea came up that the matter could be investigated with the help of DNA technology, but Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja thought that such an investigation would be considered offensive in Estonia, and consequently, nothing was done about the matter. In 2008, a document was found in the Military Archives of Sweden, according to which Vilms was executed in May 1918 in Hauho. Vilms‚Äô name was for a long time in a plaque at the mass grave in North Haaga, but in 2015 a new plaque was placed there without his name. This was the only mass execution that the Germans organized in Finland.

He also gave an interview about the book in Swebbtv. Torssell is a writer at Nya Tider and identifies himself as a soft nationalist and patriot.  Background  Torssell became a sailor at the age of 15 and graduated as a sea captain. In his youth, he became a member of the Centre Party and later as one of the founders of Green Party in 1981. He left the party quickly with the motivation that they had a large distance to ordinary Swede. Today he believes that both Milj√∂partiet and Left Party are opportunistic. According to Torssell, after the Swedish political establishment seized to serve the Swedish public he became a patriot and a soft nationalist. He was a writer at Avpixlat, but left the agency in the election of 2014 due to their political agenda. He continued as a columnist at Nya Tider which he believes is more liberal. He published five articles about MS Estonia.  MS Estonia  On September 27, 1994, MS Estonia left Tallinn with 989 passengers on board and in the night it wrecked in the Baltic Sea. Shortly after the incident, Stefan Torssell was hired at the Swedish Maritime Administration and met the victims families and began investigating the event on his spare time. After publishing his book \\"M/S Estonia: svenska statens haveri\\" Torssell eventually participated in an interview with Swebbtv where he criticized the Swedish Government who at the time of the incident, in 1994, failed to respond properly to the emergency. Torssell states in his book, wikt:transcribed from the audio recordings of the radio, that a large bang was heard and that the captain sounded an SOS-alarm to the Swedish and Finnish authorities that the ship was sinking. Torssell has hypothesized that the then Prime Minister Carl Bildt knew that Russian arms were on board, and that retrieving the ship would uncover possible secret and political scandals and chose to label it as an accident. In 2015, Stefan Torssell arranged a lecture where he stated that after 15 hours of emergency, Carl Bildt stated that the reason of the wreck of Estonia was a \\"design flaw\\" on the side. The committee he arranged for the investigation confirmed his theory. The Swedish government, with Mona Sahlin, chose to give the situation a \\"grave peace agreement\\" (gravfrid in Swedish) resulting in the errand being closed due to respect of the victims family members. The incident of Estonia has never been investigated publicly by a third party actor despite the United Nations resolution IMO A.849(20) about international sea crash investigations in paragraf 13 which states that all investigation must be re-opened against when new evidence are presented which opposes previous conclusion. According to Henning Witte, a German-Swedish attorney who ran a special investigation of the incident, the ship was sunk as a result of an attack and Swedish authorities sought to cover it up. The investigation of Witte was supported by the families of the victims and survivors however the chief of Swedish committee investigating Estonia, Ann-Louise Eksborg, opposed any new evidence which contradicted the official theory. Expressen published an article in 2008 by Torssell where he, along other deputies and reporters co-authoring, states that the public investigation of Estonia has been halted through oblivion, gags, pressure from state executives, classified reports, destroyed documents, edited records, video recordings and absence of responsibility.  Politics  Stefan Torssell has criticized Alternative for Sweden (AFS) for their neutrality in the Palestina-Israel situation. In April 2019 Torssell became elected as the party leader of Landsbygdspartiet Oberoende (LPO).

The club's chairman was August Rossa. FC Basel played their home games in the Landhof in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.  Overview  Basel played a total of 30 matches in their 1918‚Äì19 season. 14 of these were in the domestic league and 16 were friendly matches. There were nine test games played in the Landhof and seven away games. Of these friendlies, nine were won and six ended in a sporting defeat. The test home match against Nordstern Basel, played on the Football Association day, was abandoned during play. Following a crude foul, the FCB's right half was injured and had to leave the pitch. His team then demanded the exclusion of the Nordstern player, who had already been noted negatively during the morning. The referee did not respond to the request, therefore the entire FC Basel team walked off the pitch. The referee abandoned the game and awarded the victory forfeit 3:0 to Nordstern. The domestic league, Swiss Serie A 1918‚Äì19, was divided into three regional groups, East, Central and West, each group with eight teams. FC Basel and the two other teams from Basel Nordstern and Old Boys were allocated to the Central group. The other teams playing in this group were Aarau, Luzern and Biel-Bienne and the two teams from La Chaux- de-Fonds, √âtoile-Sporting and FC La Chaux-de-Fonds. FC Basel did not play a very good season, suffering six defeats. They ended the season in fifth position with 13 points. In their 14 games Basel scored 27 goals and conceded 26.

There were several variants, of which only the 1934 S.15K was serially produced. One restored example remains active in 2019. Design and development The 1930 S.15 led to Jakob Spalinger's long series of wooden, gull wing gliders. The earlier versions of the type are not well recorded but all had high wings with rectangular inner panels, tapered outer panels and pairs of single external bracing struts. They lacked the gull wing which characterized later Spalinger designs; this only appeared in 1934 with the aerobatic S.15K. Many of its features were maintained in his later aircraft. The S.15K has a single spar wing, with central, interal diagonal drag struts. In front of the spar and struts the wing is plywood-covered, forming torsion resistant D-boxes. The rest of the surface is fabric-covered. The wing is mounted on the top of the fuselage rather than on the short pedestal of the earlier variants and braced on each side by a single strut from the spar to the lower fuselage. Between these struts the inner 25% of the span has about 8¬∞ of dihedral, with 0¬∞ beyond. The central third of the span is rectangular in plan; beyond, the wing is straight-tapered, mostly on the trailing edges, out to elliptical tips. Ailerons occupy most of the tapered trailing edges. Its fuselage is a ply-covered, hexagonal section structure with deep vertical sides. The nose is blunt and the cockpit just ahead of the wing leading edge. Some had open cockpits, others one-piece, rear-hinged canopies. A short landing skid runs back a little beyond the wing bracing struts. The fuselage narrows aft to a conventional tail with a narrow, short, ply-covered fin carrying a rounded, slightly pointed, largely fabric-covered balanced rudder which reaches down to the keel. The roughly triangular but blunt tipped horizontal tail is mounted on top of the fuselage, forward of the rudder hinge. The tailplane has ply-reinforced leading edges but elsewhere, like the elevators, is fabric covered. The earlier S.15 variants differed from each other chiefly in span and aspect ratio according to their intended role, though the shortest span variant, the S.15A, was not completed. Only the S.15K reached production, with twenty-one built. Details and dates are given below. Operational history The S.15 filled the same training role as that of the Grunau Baby in Germany and was able to exploit thermals to set local records. Though the details of most of these flights are lacking, the high performing S.15C Milan recorded one of over three hours. Ten S.15Ks remained on the Swiss register into the 1950s, a few flying on to the end of the 1960s. Two were sold to Belgium in 1951 and one of these, originally HB-449 but OO-ZIW after its move, was restored to flight in 2015 as HB-449 again. In 2019 it is the only Spalinger S.15 flying.

It was formed in August in the Transcaucasus Military District as a Georgian National division. It saw its first action in August, 1942, in the 37th Army and in the course of the final push by the 1st Panzer Army in October it was overrun and nearly destroyed, although it was never actually disbanded. In December what remained was moved to the 45th Army on the border with Turkey where it stayed for the duration of the war.

For most of 1941 it was under command of the 47th Army near the southern borders of the USSR, and for the first half of 1942 it was part of the 46th Army.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 108 On March 4 Col. Isidor Andreevich Silagadze took over the division's command. Battle of the Caucasus As of July 7, when German Army Group A began its part of Operation Blue, the division was in 46th Army in Transcaucasus Front, where it remained as late as August 1. Over the next two weeks, as the German advance continued into the Caucasus region the division was transferred to the 37th Army and the Front organized a viable defense as reported on August 13:The Army had pulled back to the Baksan River before the German XXXX Panzer Corps began its drive on Mozdok on August 16. The Army continued to hold this line into early September, now with the 2nd Guards Rifle, 275th, 295th and 392nd Rifle and the 11th NKVD Rifle Divisions. The 37th's mission at this time was to prevent the III Panzer Corps' 23rd Panzer and Romanian 2nd Mountain Divisions from advancing south towards Nalchik.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 114, 415, 423, 433, 437 Meanwhile, having seized Mozdok on August 25, the XXXX Panzer Corps and LII Army Corps crossed the Terek on September 2 with the immediate objective of Malgobek 22km to the southwest and the eventual goal of reaching Ordzhonikidze. This assault would proceed at a relative snail's pace due to terrain and heavy Soviet resistance. On September 23 - 24 the 23rd Panzer advanced southward and captured two towns on the Terek, badly damaging the 295th and 11th NKVD Divisions on the right wing of 37th Army in the process. However, in late September the push on Ordzhonikidze stalled. On October 9 Colonel Silagadze handed his command to Col. Georgy Ivanovich Kuparadze, who would be promoted to major general on November 10. The German offensive was renewed on October 25 in the directions of both Nalchik and Ordzhonikidze, targeting the 37th Army which was the weakest of those in the Northern Caucasus Group and had no armor whatsoever. III Panzer Corps began with a powerful artillery preparation and heavy air strikes which, among other things, hit the Army headquarters, killing many staff officers and destroying its communication system. At 1000 hours the Romanian 2nd Mountain Division attacked at the boundary of the 392nd and 295th Divisions and soon gained 8km, or about half the distance to Nalchik, as the Soviet divisions reeled back to the south and east.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 550, 556, 558, 574, 578-79 III Panzer Corps continued its rapid advance on October 27 - 28. 2nd Romanian captured Nalchik on the 28th, while also pressing the remnants of the 2nd Guards and 392nd back into the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. Despite the division's woes, on November 5 the German drive on Ordzhonikidze was stopped on the city's outskirts.Glantz, Armageddon, pp. 581, 584 It disappeared from the Soviet order of battle in November and December,Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 108 but reappeared near the end of December, now in 45th Army along the Turkish border.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 28 =Further service= The division would remain on this quiet sector for the duration of the war. On December 7 General Kuparadze was replaced by Lt. Col. Stepan Artimevich Beruchashvili; Kuparadze would serve as commander of the 12th Rifle Corps for the duration and into the postwar. Beruchashvili was replaced by Col. Ilya Omanovich Rasmadze on January 6, 1943, but on March 11 was replaced by Col.

He was the 1,500th person to be executed in the United States since capital punishment was resumed in 1976. He was sentenced to death for the 1996 murder of corrections officer Donovan Corey Parks. Murder On March 28, 1996, Wilson and his accomplice Robert Earl Butts Jr. (May 14, 1977 - May 4, 2018) came across off- duty prison guard Donovan Corey Parks, outside a Walmart in Milledgeville, Georgia. Butts had worked with Parks at a local Burger King and asked if they could get a ride in his car. Parks agreed and took the two men in his car. Butts was sitting in the front passenger seat of the vehicle and Wilson was sitting in the back as they left the parking lot. Parks was then fatally shot by one of the two men with a sawn-off shotgun. He was ordered out of his car and shot in the back of his head as he lay on the ground. His dead body was found lying face down on a residential street not far from the parking lot. Butts and Wilson fled in the stolen car, which they later burned after being unsuccessful in their attempt at finding someone to sell it to. Trial and execution Butts and Wilson were arrested four days after the murder and each man accused the other of pulling the trigger. They were both gang members in the Folk Nation street gang. Prosecutors claim they murdered Parks to achieve a higher status within their gang. Both men were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1997. In December 1999, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed on direct appeal. Wilson next petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. The petition was denied in a written opinion by the state superior court, which was summarily affirmed by the state supreme court, and denied review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Wilson then filed another petition for habeas corpus, now in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, which was denied. In December 2014, a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, also rejecting Wilson's petition. In August 2016, the full en banc Eleventh Circuit again rejected the petition by a vote of 6-5. In April 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed and remanded by a vote of 6-3 in Wilson v. Sellers, finding that the Eleventh Circuit had erred under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by failing to consider the reasoning in lower, earlier, written state court decision. In August 2018, the Eleventh Circuit again denied Wilson's petition. Butts was executed by lethal injection on May 4, 2018 at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison, 10 days before what would have been his 41st birthday. On May 28, 2019, Wilson's final petition for certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States. Eight days later, Wilson received an execution date of June 20, 2019. The Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles denied clemency for Wilson on the morning of his execution date. He requested a last meal of one medium thin-crust pizza with everything, 20 buffalo wings, one pint of butter pecan ice cream, some apple pie and grape juice. Wilson was executed by lethal injection on June 20, 2019. He became the 1,500th person to be executed in the United States since capital punishment was resumed in 1976 after Gregg v. Georgia. His execution was carried out at 9:52 p.m. ET at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Butts County, Georgia after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay of execution.

November 2001. Khmer Master Musician Yoeun Mek tries to play the one-stringed kse diev instrument for the first time. Mek met Sok Duch, who was the only surviving master of that instrument, teaching at Wat Bo in 2001. Yoeun Mek (1939 - 2014) was a Cambodian musician who joined the Cambodian Master Performers Program (now Cambodian Living Arts) in 1999, an organization founded by his friend Arn Chorn-Pond to preserve Cambodian music, arts and rituals and keep traditional instruments from going extinct. The program, in its quest to preserve Khmer music, sought out Cambodia's \\"nearly extinct instruments and the people who can make and play them.\\" 80-90% of the musicians of the country were \\"purged\\" by the Khmer Rouge from 1975-1979. Out of the people who could play the traditional instruments to a high level, the Cambodian Master Performers Program estimated that only 100 to 200 musicians had survived the executions, which targeted almost everyone with an education, those who understood a foreign language, and many artists (including musicians, writers, and filmmakers). Yoeun, who had made his first tro sor when he was 15, was a \\"master\\" of the tro family of instruments, especially the tro sau thom and tro u. He also knew enough about the khim, takhay, drums and chheng to include them in his teaching traditional wedding songs. In 1975, when the Khmer Rouge took over the capitol at Phnom Penh, he would have been about 36. His friend Arn would have been 9-years old that year. Both Yoeun and Arn were in the same Khmer Rouge work camp together; working in the fields by day, and playing music for the soldiers in the evening. His friend may have saved his life by begging the soldiers to let Yoeun play with the small group that entertained them. Rather than play traditional Cambodian music, Yoeun was permitted to play revolutionary music with communist themes: \\"the dances depict hardworking people, farmers working together, people digging canals and people laboring in the sun to fix railroad and so on.\\" Separately from the soldiers, Yoeun taught his friend traditional music that was forbidden by their government. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Yoeun worked for his country's new government, in the State Department of Art and Culture until he retired. He set up a barbershop and was found by his friend Arn, who hired him to teach his instrument at the Cambodian Master Performers Program.

Gates and a literary critic discuss Our Nig, Wired for BooksOur Nig: Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, Geo. C. Rand and Avery, 1859. In 1897, Joseph Conrad penned a novella titled The Nigger of the 'Narcissus, whose titular character, James Wait, is a West Indian black sailor on board the merchant ship Narcissus sailing from Bombay to London. In the United States, the novel was first published with the title The Children of the Sea: A Tale of the Forecastle, at the insistence by the publisher, Dodd, Mead and Company, that no one would buy or read a book with the word \\"nigger\\" in its title, not because the word was deemed offensive but that a book about a black man would not sell. In 2009, WordBridge Publishing published a new edition titled The N-Word of the Narcissus, which also excised the word \\"nigger\\" from the text. According to the publisher, the point was to get rid of the offensive word, which may have led readers to avoid the book, and make it more accessible. Though praised in some quarters, many others denounced the change as censorship. The writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten took the opposite view to Conrad's publishers when he advised the British novelist Ronald Firbank to change the title of his 1924 novel Sorrow in Sunlight to Prancing Nigger for the American market, and it became very successful there under that title. Van Vechten, a white supporter of the Harlem Renaissance (1920s‚Äì30s), then used the word himself in his 1926 novel Nigger Heaven, which provoked controversy in the black community. Of the controversy, Langston Hughes wrote: Ten Little Niggers was the original title of Agatha Christie's 1939 detective novel, named for a children's counting-out game familiar in England at that date; it was renamed first to Ten Little Indians and then in the early 1980s to And Then There Were None. Flannery O'Connor uses a black lawn jockey as a symbol in her 1955 short story \\"The Artificial Nigger\\". American comedian Dick Gregory used the word in the title of his 1964 autobiography, written during the American Civil Rights Movement. Gregory comments on his choice of title in the book's primary dedication: \\"if ever you hear the word \\"nigger\\" again, remember they are advertising my book. Labi Siffre, the singer-songwriter best known for \\"(Something Inside) So Strong\\", entitled his first book of poetry simply Nigger (Xavier Books 1993). The use of nigger in older literature has become controversial because of the word's modern meaning as a racist insult. = Huckleberry Finn = 1885 illustration from Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, captioned \\"Misto Bradish's nigger\\" Mark Twain's novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885) has long been the subject of controversy for its racial content. Huckleberry Finn was the fifth most challenged book during the 1990s, according to the American Library Association. The novel is written from the point of view, and largely in the language, of Huckleberry Finn, an uneducated white boy, who is drifting down the Mississippi River on a raft with an adult escaped slave, Jim. The word \\"nigger\\" is used (mostly about Jim) over 200 times. Alt URL Twain's advocates note that the novel is composed in then-contemporary vernacular usage, not racist stereotype, because Jim, the black man, is a sympathetic character. In 2011, a new edition published by NewSouth Books replaced the word \\"nigger\\" with \\"slave\\" and also removed the word \\"injun\\". The change was spearheaded by Twain scholar Alan Gribben in the hope of \\"countering the 'pre-emptive censorship'\\" that results from the book's being removed from school curricula over language concerns. The changes sparked outrage from critics Elon James, Alexandra Petrie and Chris Meadows. = British literary usage = \\"How the Leopard Got His Spots\\" Several late- nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century British literary usages suggest neutral usage. The popular Victorian era entertainment, the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta The Mikado (1885), twice uses the word nigger. In the song As some day it may happen, the executioner, Ko-ko, sings of executing the \\"nigger serenader and the others of his race\\", referring to white singers with their faces blacked singing minstrel songs. In the song A more humane Mikado, the Mikado sings of the punishment for older women who dye their hair or wear corsets, to be \\"Blacked like a nigger/With permanent walnut juice.\\" Both lyrics are usually changed for modern performances. The word \\"nigger\\" appears in children's literature. \\"How the Leopard Got His Spots\\", in the Just So Stories (1902) by Rudyard Kipling, tells of an Ethiopian man and a leopard, both originally sand-colored, deciding to camouflage themselves with painted spots, for hunting in tropical forest. The story originally included a scene wherein the leopard (now spotted) asks the Ethiopian man why he does not want spots. In contemporary editions of \\"How the Leopard Got His Spots\\", the Ethiopian's original reply (\\"Oh, plain black's best for a nigger\\") has been edited to, \\"Oh, plain black's best for me.\\" The counting rhyme known as \\"Eenie Meenie Mainee, Mo\\" has been attested from 1820, with many variants; when Kipling included it as \\"A Counting-Out Song\\" in Land and Sea Tales for Scouts and Guides (1923), he gave as its second line, \\"Catch a nigger by the toe!\\" This version became widely used for much of the twentieth century; the rhyme is still in use, but the second line now uses \\"tiger\\" instead. The word \\"nigger\\" is used innocently and without malice by the child characters in some of the Swallows and Amazons series, written in the 1930s by Arthur Ransome, e.g. in referring to how the (white) characters appear in photographic negatives (\\"Look like niggers to me\\") in The Big Six, and as a synonym for black pearls in Peter Duck. Editions published by Puffin after Ransome's death changed the word to 'negroes'. The first Jeeves novel, Thank You, Jeeves (1934), features a minstrel show as a significant plot point. Bertie Wooster, who is trying to learn to play the banjo, is in admiration of their artistry and music. Tellingly, P.G. Wodehouse has the repeated phrase \\"nigger minstrels\\" only on the lips of Wooster and his peers; the manservant Jeeves uses the more genteel \\"Negroes\\". In short story \\"The Basement Room\\" (1935), by Graham Greene, the (sympathetic) servant character, Baines, tells the admiring boy, son of his employer, of his African British colony service, \\"You wouldn't believe it now, but I've had forty niggers under me, doing what I told them to\\". Replying to the boy's question: \\"Did you ever shoot a nigger?\\" Bains answers: \\"I never had any call to shoot. Of course I carried a gun. But you didn't need to treat them bad, that just made them stupid. Why, I loved some of those dammed niggers.\\" The cinematic version, The Fallen Idol (1948), directed by Carol Reed, replaced this usage with \\"natives\\". Virginia Woolf, in her 1941 posthumously-published novel Between the Acts, wrote \\"Down amongst the bushes she worked like a nigger.\\" The phrase is not dialogue from one of the characters, nor is it in the context of expressing a point of view of one of the characters. Woolf's usage of racist slurs has been examined in various academic writings.Lee, Hermione: \\"Virginia Woolf and Offence,\\" in The Art of Literary Biography, Oxford Scholarship Online: October 2011; reviewed by McManus, Patricia: \\"The \\"Offensiveness\\" of Virginia Woolf: From a Moral to a Political Reading\\" in Woolf Studies Annual, vol. 14, Annual 2008. The Reverend W. V. Awdry's The Railway Series (1945‚Äì72) story Henry's Sneeze, originally described soot-covered boys with the phrase \\"as black as niggers\\". In 1972, after complaints, the description was edited to \\"as black as soot\\", in the subsequent editions. Rev. Awdry is known for Thomas the Tank Engine (1946). Music 1851 song lyrics The folk song \\"Oh! Susanna\\" by Stephen Foster had originally been written in four verses. The second verse describes an industrial accident which \\"kill'd five hundred Nigger\\" by electrocution. The 1932 British song \\"The Sun Has Got His Hat On\\" originally included the line \\"He's been tanning niggers out in Timbuktu\\" (where \\"He\\" is the sun). Modern recordings substitute other lines. The Bohemian composer Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k wrote the String Quartet No. 12 in 1893 during his time in the United States. For its presumed association with African-American music, the quartet was referred to until the 1950s with nicknames such as \\"Negro Quartet\\" and \\"Nigger Quartet\\" before being called the \\"American Quartet\\". In the 1960s, record producer J. D. \\"Jay\\" Miller published pro-racial segregation music, with the \\"Reb Rebel\\" label featuring racist songs by Johnny Rebel and others, demeaning black Americans and the Civil Rights Movement.John Broven, South to Louisiana: The Music of the Cajun Bayous. Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican, 1983, p. 252f. The country music artist David Allan Coe used the racial terms \\"redneck\\", \\"white trash\\", and \\"nigger\\" in the songs \\"If That Ain't Country, I'll Kiss Your Ass\\" and \\"Nigger Fucker\\".Myspace.com David Allen Coe In 1972 John Lennon and Yoko Ono used the word in both the title and in the chorus of their song \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World,\\" which was released as both a single and a track on their album \\"Sometime in New York City.\\" Duston, Anne. \\"Lennon, Ono 45 Controversial\\" Billboard 17 June 1972: 65 On Bob Marley and the Wailers' 1973 song \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\", Marley can be heard singing the line, \\"Don't be a nigger in your neighborhood\\" during the outro. In 1975 Bob Dylan used the word in his song \\"Hurricane\\". In 1978 Patti Smith used the word prominently in her song \\"Rock N Roll Nigger\\". The punk band the Dead Kennedys used the word in their 1980 song \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\" in the line, \\"Bragging that you know how the niggers feel cold and the slum's got so much soul\\". The context is a section mocking champagne socialists. Rap groups such as N.W.A (Niggaz with Attitudes) re-popularized the usage in their songs. One of the earliest uses of the word in hip hop was in the song \\"New York New York\\" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five in 1983. Responding to accusations of racism after referring to \\"niggers\\" in the lyrics of the 1988 Guns N' Roses song, \\"One in a Million\\", Axl Rose stated: \\"I was pissed off about some black people that were trying to rob me. I wanted to insult those particular black people. I didn't want to support racism.\\"MNeely, Kim (April 2, 1992). \\"Axl Rose: The RS Interview\\". Rolling Stone. Retrieved December 20, 2007. The term white nigger is also used in music, most notably in Elvis Costello's song \\"Oliver's Army\\", see below. Since the 2010s the word nigger has been used with increasing frequency by African Americans amongst themselves or in self-expression, the most common swear word in hip hop music lyrics. As a result, it is a word that is heard daily by millions of all races worldwide who listen to uncensored hip hop and other music genres, while being socially unacceptable for anyone but African Americans to utter. Ta-Nehisi Coates has suggested that it continues to be unacceptable for people who are not of African ancestry to utter the word nigger while singing or rapping along to hip-hop, and that by being so restrained it gives White Americans (specifically) a taste of what it's like to not be entitled to \\"do anything they please, anywhere\\". Counterpoint to this standpoint is the open question of whether daily, frequent exposure by non-Black Americans to African Americans using the word will inevitably lead to a dilution of the extremely negative perception of the word among the majority of non-Black Americans that currently consider its use unacceptable and shocking. Theater The musical Show Boat, which subverts anti- miscegenation laws, from 1927 until 1946 features the word \\"nigger\\" as originally integral to the lyrics of \\"Ol' Man River\\" and \\"Cotton Blossom\\"; although deleted from the cinema versions, it is included in the 1988 EMI recording of the original score. Musical theatre historian Miles Kreuger and conductor John McGlinn propose that the word was not an insult, but a blunt illustration of how white people then perceived black people. The Moore's Ford lynchings, also known as the 1946 Georgia lynching, has been commemorated since 2005 with a yearly re-enactment. According to a volunteer actor playing one of the victims, this living memorial \\"consist[s] largely of older white men calling him ‚Äúnigger,‚Äù tying a noose around his neck, and pretending to shoot him repeatedly\\" Cinema One of Horace Ov√©'s first films was Baldwin's Nigger (1968), in which two African Americans, novelist James Baldwin and comedian Dick Gregory, discuss Black experience and identity in Britain and the United States.Horace Ov√© biography, BFI Screenonline. Filmed at the West Indian Students' Centre in London, the film documents a lecture by Baldwin and a question-and-answer session with the audience.\\"Baldwin's Nigger (1968)\\" at IMDb.\\"Baldwin's Nigger (1969)\\", BFI Screenonline. Mel Brooks' 1974 satirical Western film Blazing Saddles used the term repeatedly. In The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977), the sequence titled \\"Danger Seekers\\" features a stuntman performing the dangerous act of shouting \\"Niggers!\\" at a group of black people, then fleeing when they take chase. Stanley Kubrick's critically acclaimed 1987 war film Full Metal Jacket depicts black and white U.S. Marines enduring boot camp and later fighting together in Vietnam. \\"Nigger\\" is used by soldiers of both races in jokes and as expressions of bravado (\\"put a nigger behind the trigger\\", says the black Corporal \\"Eightball\\"), with racial differences among the men seen as secondary to their shared exposure to the dangers of combat: Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) says, \\"There is no racial bigotry here. I do not look down on niggers, kikes, wops or greasers. Here you are all equally worthless.\\" Gayniggers from Outer Space, a 1992 English-language Danish short blaxploitation parody, features black homosexual male aliens who commit gendercide to free the men of Earth from female oppression. Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995) featured a scene where villain Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) required New York City Police Department Lt. John McClane (Bruce Willis) to wear a sandwich board reading \\"I hate niggers\\" while standing on a street corner in predominantly-black Harlem, resulting in McClane meeting Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) as Carver rescued McClane from being attacked by neighborhood toughs. American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino has been criticized for the heavy usage of the word nigger in his films, especially Jackie Brown (1997), where the word is used 38 times and Django Unchained (2012), used 110 times. =The Dam Busters= During World War II, a dog named Nigger, a black Labrador belonged to Royal Air Force Wing Commander Guy Gibson. In 1943, Gibson led the successful Operation Chastise attack on dams in Nazi Germany. The dog's name was used as a single codeword whose transmission conveyed that the M√∂hne dam had been breached. In Michael Anderson's 1955 film The Dam Busters, based on the raid, the dog was portrayed in several scenes; his name and the codeword were mentioned several times. Some of the these scenes were sampled in Alan Parker's 1982 film Pink Floyd ‚Äì The Wall. In 1999, British television network ITV broadcast a censored version with each of the twelve utterances of Nigger deleted. Replying to complaints against its censorship, ITV blamed the regional broadcaster, London Weekend Television, which, in turn, blamed a junior employee as the unauthorised censor. In June 2001, when ITV re-broadcast the censored version of The Dam Busters, Index on Censorship criticised it as \\"unnecessary and ridiculous\\" censorship breaking the continuity of the film and the story.ITV attacked over Dam Busters censorship, The Guardian, June 11, 2001 In January 2012, the film was shown uncensored on ITV4, but with a warning at the start that the film contained racial terms from the historical period which some people could find offensive. Versions edited for US television have the dog's name altered to \\"Trigger\\". In 2008, New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson announced that he was spearheading a remake. Screenwriter Stephen Fry said there was \\"no question in America that you could ever have a dog called the N-word\\". In the unrealized remake, the dog was to be renamed \\"Digger\\". Stand-up comedy Some comedians have broached the subject, almost invariably in the form of social commentary. This was perhaps most famously done by stand-up comedian Chris Rock in his \\"Niggas vs. Black People\\" routine. Richard Pryor used the word extensively before pledging to remove it from his lexicon, having had a change of heart during a trip to Africa.

The machine won three GPs and with it MV Agusta won that year's 250 cc Constructors Championship. History Meccania Verghera Agusta SpA in Gallarate manufactured helicopters, but its director, Count Domenico Agusta, was a big fan of motorsport and he had already taken the first steps towards road racing with his own motorcycles in the late 1940s. In 1950 he hired Piero Remor and Arturo Magni, two designers who had successfully worked for Gilera. They first made the MV Agusta 125 Bialbero, which bore similarities to the Benelli 250cc racer, and the MV Agusta 500 4C, an almost exact copy of the Gilera 500 4C. Eventually the count wanted to race in more and more classes, and so the racing department was commissioned to design a racing engine for the 250cc class. MV Agusta 203 Bialbero By 1955, the 125 Bialbero had already been enlarged to 175 cc version, because the 175 cc class was still very popular in Italy at the time. The machine was further expanded to 203 cc to compete in the 250 cc World Championship. MV Agusta selected their riders from three retained riders dependent on the race: Bill Lomas,Bill Lomas career statistics at MotoGP.com mainly because of his knowledge of the British circuits, Umberto MasettiUmberto Masetti career statistics at MotoGP.com and Luigi Taveri.Luigi Taveri career statistics at MotoGP.com Lomas had a busy season, as he was also employed by Moto Guzzi in the 350 and 500 cc classes. The Isle of Man TT, in particular, was a busy week for him, as he started in four classes: the Lightweight 125 cc TT (fourth with the MV Agusta 125 Bialbero), theLightweight 250 cc TT (first with the MV Agusta 203 Bialbero), the 350cc Junior TT (first with the Moto Guzzi Monocilindrica 350) and the 500cc Senior TT (seventh with the Moto Guzzi Monocilindrica 500). Two wins for Lomas, but also the first win for the 203cc MV Agusta. Masetti and Taveri also started in the Lightweight 250 cc TT, but both dropped out. MV Agusta 220 Bialbero After the 1955 Isle of Man TT the machine was further enlarged to 220 cc by increasing the bore. At the next race, the German motorcycle Grand Prix at the N√ºrburgring, only Taveri started and finished fourth. In Assen, Taveri won convincingly, with a 41 seconds ahead second placed Masetti. Hermann Paul M√ºller finished third on the NSU Sportmax. Although only third, it was clear that he was competition for the world title. However, the rankings of Taveri and Masetti were very important for the constructors' title. In the Ulster Grand Prix, M√ºller was only sixth, but MV Agusta did not do well, Masetti was in third and Lomas fourth. In the final race, the GP des Nations at Monza, Carlo Ubbiali, who was already 125 cc world champion, won the 250cc class for MV Agusta, with Lomas fifth and Masetti sixth. The world title went to \\"HP\\" M√ºller, Bill Lomas came in second, Luigi Taveri fourth, Umberto Masetti fifth and Carlo Ubbiali seventh. MV Agusta won the constructor's title. In 1956 the MV Agusta 220 Bialbero was succeeded by a fully-fledged 250cc machine, the MV Agusta 250 Monocilindrica Bialbero. Technical data The 203 Bialbero had an air-cooled, single- cylinder, four-stroke engine with double overhead camshafts (DOHC). The camshafts were driven by a gear train. The valves were at an angle of 90¬∞ to each other and were closed by hairpin valve springs. The bore and stroke were 68 mm √ó 56 mm, giving an engine displacement of 203.4 cc. After the Isle of Man TT, the bore was increased to 71 mm, giving a capacity of 220 cc. A Wet multi-plate was driven by gears from the crankshaft. The machine had five gears and the rear wheel was driven by a chain. The MV Agusta had a double cradle frame that was constructed from chrome molybdenum tubes with a diameter of 25 mm √ó 1.2 mm. The front fork was a telescopic fork, and the rear suspension was swingarm with hydraulic shock absorbers.

Founded in 1945 the club was the reforming of Gedania Danzig. History =Gedania Danzig= The badge used by Gedania Danzig Formed on 15 September 1922, Gedania was an ethnic Polish football team who played in the Free City of Danzig (present day Gda≈Ñsk, Poland). A sports club was created by the gymnastics club Towarzystwo Gimnastyczne Sok√≥≈Ç (Falcon Gymnastic Company) and was initially given the name Polonia Danzig, Polonia being the Latinized name for Poland. The local authorities opposed this name however with the club settling for the name Gedania Danzig, Gedania being the Latinized name of Gda≈Ñsk/Danzig. The footballing section of the sports club was not formed until 1933, and competed in the German lower divisions. After moderate success with two 3rd-place finished and two 2nd-place finishes within the space of 4 years, Gedania Danzig was forced to cease operations due to the Nazi occupation of Poland. After the occupation of Danzig, the club's president, Henryk Kopeck, and two vice-presidents, Konrad Zdrojewski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Dƒôbowski were shot. Most of the players and footballing staff were sent to concentration camps. In total 75 people associated with Gedania before its operations ceased died during the war. =Gedania Gda≈Ñsk= Gedania was formed on 16 May 1945 after the liberation of Gda≈Ñsk using the name KS Gedania. After some initial success in the football leagues Gedania soon found themselves playing in the lower divisions. In 1987 the team was involved in a merger with MOSiR Gda≈Ñsk. The team experienced a second merger in 2003, this time with Flotylla Gda≈Ñsk. In 2006 the football section of the sports club left and changed its name to GKS Gedania 1922 in reference to the year the initial Gedania sports club was formed. The team moved to their new home in 2012, a sports and recreation complex at Aleja Hallera 201. In 2015 Gedania were promoted to the fourth tier finishing runners-up in their league. This was managed due to the team winning 14 of their final 15 games, and amassing a 13-game winning streak. Rivalries Having played in the regional leagues for most of their history Gedania's rivalries have been teams from the Gda≈Ñsk area, and as a result games involving the Gda≈Ñsk Derby. In the early years of their formation Gedania had a strong rivalry with Lechia Gda≈Ñsk, playing 9 times between 1945-51. The derby between the two teams was not contested again for over 50 years until the two teams last played in 2004. Since the turn of the century Gedania has been involved in more derbies, with the club playing Stoczniowiec Gda≈Ñsk 14 times in the league over 10 seasons from 2001-2011 and have played Jaguar Gda≈Ñsk in the league most seasons since 2012. Another of Gedania's rivals local rivals are Portowiec Gda≈Ñsk who they first played in the 1970s. The two teams last played during the 2014-15 season. Colours Gedania's home colours are typically mainly white shirts with a red detail, white shorts, and always having blue socks. These are the same colours that were used by Gedania Danzig who often wore white and red striped shirts, blue shorts, and blue socks. In recent years the club has often had a white shirt with a red diagonal sash, the away shirt being the opposite design with a red shirt and white sash.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building, receiving around twenty thousand visitors annually.  History and features  The parish of Howick dates back to 1158 when a priest named Asket is recorded, but there was a church here long before his time. The original temple was built in Norman style, it was destroyed by a fire in 1746 and was replaced by what the church guide calls 'a curious Ionic temple'. That 'Ionic' building burnt down in turn and was replaced by the present church in 1848, which was designed by the architect FJ Francis. This Neo-Norman style temple is a typically Victorian building, with round-arched Romanesque windows and doors. Francis extended the church eastward by the addition of a chancel and vestry, and westward by the bell-cote. The church is closely related to the Greys of Howick Hall, and many of the members of the Grey family are buried in the churchyard. The most famous and important of them was Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, who served as Prime Minister between 1830‚Äì1834. It was during his tenure that the Reform Act 1832 was passed, paving the way for representative democracy. But today he is best remembered not for his political achievements, but for the tea that bears his name. The Greys did more than just go to church. Maria Copley, 3rd Countess Grey (1803‚Äì1879), was a sculptress. She carved the gargoyles that decorate the exterior north wall. Mabel Palmer, 5th Countess (1884‚Äì1958), commissioned the paintings behind the altar and the baptismal font, and are regarded with mixed feelings. Michael Fisher, the second Anglican Bishop of St Germans, recounts the experience with the family of Charles Grey, 5th Earl Grey in his memoir For the Time Being: A Memoir, he mentions that they were devout High Church Anglicans, but the churchmanship of St Michael's is unclear.

She occupied leadership positions in human rights groups starting in the 1980s. Influences and activism Along with a strong family tradition of activism, Lucas' social involvement was influenced by Algeria's period of decolonisation and the subsequent challenges to women's rights posed by religious fundamentalists. She left a university position in human rights research and teaching in the 1980s to help establish the group Women Living Under Muslim Laws (in 1984) and become its first international coordinator. She is also a founding member of the Women Human Rights Defenders Coalition. Lucas co-founded Secularism is a Women's Issue in 2006. The organization advocates against allowing separate legal frameworks for people or specific faith communities, such as courts using Sharia law, arguing those regimes are often detrimental to women's rights. The group also collects and distributes information on the situation of secularists and atheists in countries where Muslims make up a large part of the population. It also advocates for secularism in Europe. Current interests Lucas is interested in how European societies respond to religious fundamentalism, as well as to xenophobic movements. Comparing theocracy (immutable law handed out by god) to democracy (laws evolving through decision by people), Lucas argues any rules based on religion are by nature anti-democratic. The debates around immigration in European countries adds a complex dimension to that debate, for Lucas: \\"Unfortunately, the European Left and Far-Left, that should be our natural allies, have not yet understood that they should not throw themselves in the arms of Muslim fundamentalists in order to counter the traditional extreme right parties‚Ä¶\\" She also works to uncover the history of atheism and feminism in countries where Islam has major influence.

It does academic and advocacy work in the fields of women's rights and secularism, focusing on the impact on women of laws inspired by Muslim religion or customs. Origins The network started out as a loose organization with no fixed membership, where individual and groups assumed responsibility for specific initiatives. It attracted women affected by Muslim laws, whether they are Muslims or not, bringing together religious believers, human rights advocates, secularists and atheists. Until Marieme Helie Lucas retired as international coordinator in the late 1990s, it remained a fluid organization without clearly defined staff positions. Research and current work The network coordinates research exploring the mechanism by which laws affecting women borrow from cultural practices and colonial laws in addition to religious dogma, to eliminate progressive laws and restrict women's freedom. It also facilitates communication between women's groups across Africa and Asia, sharing success stories and helping to coordinate international actions. It conducted studies and advocated on issues such as forced marriage of girls and stoning. The group's research on the impact of Muslim family law led to the founding of the Musawah campaign in 2009. Some governments look unfavorably upon the group's work. Collaboration with Women Living Under Muslim Laws was mentioned as a motive for the 2016 arrest of both Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Homa Hoodfar by Iranian authorities.

Following his grandfather's death, Ala al-Dawla became embroiled in the ensuing succession struggle. Though he initially possessed a strategic advantage, he was eventually overtaken by his more successful rivals. Ala al- Dawla died in exile after numerous failed attempts to gain the throne. Early life and career Ala al-Dawla was born in Herat in June/July 1417, the eldest son of Baysunghur Mirza, as well as the only one born of a free wife. His father was himself a son of the Timurid Sultan Shah Rukh. His mother, Jan Malik Agha, a daughter of the Timurid officer Amir Chulpan Qauchin, had been previously married to Baysunghur's cousin Iskandar Mirza. Unlike his younger brothers, Ala al-Dawla was raised at the royal court alongside his cousin Abdal-Latif Mirza by their grandmother, the empress Gawhar Shad. It is likely that she and Shah Rukh were grooming the boys, the firstborns of their two eldest sons, as potential successors to the throne. However, Ala al-Dawla quickly emerged as his grandmother's favourite. Upon Baysunghur's premature death in 1433, Ala al-Dawla, then sixteen years old, inherited his father's position as amir-e diwan, as well as his post as governor of Mazandaran, a strategic position and important in the empires defence against Uzbek tribes. However, the prince's focus appears to have been more on the affairs of the royal court rather than his official posting. The following year, he participated in his grandfather's third campaign in Azerbaijan against the Qara Qoyunlu. When Shah Rukh fell ill in 1444, Gawhar Shad, anticipating his death, pushed the powerful Amir Firuzshah to support Ala al-Dawla's succession to the throne, angering the other princes. When Shah Rukh recovered from his illness and learned of this, he rebuked Firuzshah, who was unable to bear the disgrace and subsequently died of illness. War of succession Shah Rukh died of illness in his winter quarters in Rayy soon after putting down the revolt of another grandson, Sultan Muhammad, in March 1447. Gawhar Shad, who had been with him, quickly dispatched a message to Ala al-Dawla, who had been left as Shah Rukh's deputy in Herat, informing him of the sultan's death. However, whilst she and Abdal-Latif were escorting the body back to Herat for burial, the latter turned on his grandmother, taking both her and the corpse hostage. His reasons for this are uncertain, with it being possible that he was attempting to preempt Ala al-Dawla and advance his own claims to the throne. Alternatively, this may have been part of a pre-arranged plan to support the claims of his father Ulugh Beg, who was by this point Shah Rukh's last surviving son. Ala al-Dawla, who had been biding his time in Herat, declared himself sultan upon learning of the situation, and distributed his grandfather's treasury among the troops. The prince's soldiers then launched an attack against his renegade cousin, freeing the dowager empress and rescuing his grandfather's body, which he had buried in the Gawhar Shad Mausoleum in Herat. Over the following few months, the various regions of the Timurid Empire were parcelled off by Shah Rukh's descendants, with the respective princes opting to remain cautious and defensive. During this time, Ala al-Dawla was in an enviable position, holding the wealthy region of Khorasan, which included his grandfather's former capital of Herat. In addition to this, he commanded the allegiance of most of Shah Rukh's nobles, as well as enjoying the favour of the influential dowager empress Gawhar Shad. The hiatus ended in May when Ulugh Beg, who was ruling from Samarqand, took Abu Bakr, son of Muhammad Juki captive and stationed his own troops in Balkh, which had formerly been the latter's territory. When Ulugh Beg heard that Ala al-Dawla had gathered his army in a move to block him, his amir's advised him to make peace with his nephew. Ala al-Dawla, who had just learned that his brother Abul-Qasim Babur was making raids near Herat, agreed to the proposal, allowing Ulugh Beg to keep much of Abu Bakr's former territories. As Ala al- Dawla marched to Mashhad to confront his brother's forces, the amirs of both princes urged them to make an alliance, pointing out that Ulugh Beg was aiming for total conquest over his rivals. They agreed to a border at Khabushan and returned to their respective capitals. In the winter of that year, Ala al- Dawla became embroiled in a quarrel with Abdal-Latif, who had been stationed in Balkh as his father's governor. Ala al-Dawla launched a campaign against his cousin and plundered the region. Ulugh Beg used this as a pretext to attack and together with Abdal-Latif, he launched an invasion against his nephew in the spring of 1448. The two armies met in Tarnab, where Ala al-Dawla was defeated, forcing him to withdraw to Abul-Qasim Babur in Astarabad. Mashhad was occupied by Ulugh Beg's forces, while Abdal-Latif conquered Herat. With this failure, Ala al-Dawla lost much support among his followers and never recovered his former pre-eminence. Even his grandmother Gawhar Shad appears to have doubted him, taking refuge instead with his brother Sultan Muhammad in Isfahan, bringing with her many of her relatives, nobles and a large number of troops. Conflict with his brothers By February 1449, Abul- Qasim Babur had gained control of Herat, having earlier inflicted a defeat on Ulugh Beg. Though Ala al-Dawla was still with him at this point, Abul-Qasim Babur was now undoubtedly the more prominent of the two. In spite of this, Ala al-Dawla still remained a threat due to his popularity among the population of Khorasan as well as his receiving their grandmother's continued favour. Abul- Qasim Babur therefore opted to imprison him alongside his son Ibrahim. However, Ala al-Dawla soon escaped, fleeing first to Ghur and then to Sistan. When his brother continued to pursue him, he retreated to Yazd, then held by Sultan Muhammad. Ala al-Dawla, alongside Gawhar Shad, encouraged Sultan Muhammad to march on Herat, which resulted in the defeat of Abul-Qasim Babur's forces and the capture of the city. Like his brother, Sultan Muhammad was concerned by Ala al-Dawla's continued support in the region and sent him away to Kabul to act as governor. However, by 1451 Ala al-Dawla had gained the support of the Arlat tribe, with whom he had marriage ties, allowing him to make another attempt for the throne. Whilst Sultan Muhammad was absent fighting their brother, Ala al-Dawla took control of Herat with the aid of the city's population. Sultan Muhammad, then facing an insurgency amongst his nobles, was unable to counteract this, instead being forced to devote resources to reestablishing his control over his central territories. However, Abul-Qasim Babur used this opportunity to attempt to retake Herat himself. On his approach Ala al-Dawla retreated to Balkh, though even in his absence it required a long siege by Abul-Qasim Babur to gain the city's surrender. In June of that year, Ala al-Dawla made a bid to capture Samarqand from Abdallah Mirza, who had taken the city following the deaths of Ulugh Beg and Abdal- Latif. Ala al-Dawla seized the cities of Shapurqan, Balkh and Hisar, from where he planned to launch his invasion. Abdallah marched out from Shahrisabz to meet him, though both armies separated without fighting, with each ruler returning to their respective cities. Ala al-Dawla then followed with another attempt to take Herat, this time while in league with the Qara Qoyunlu, which also failed. This resulted in him being blinded by Abul-Qasim Babur as punishment. Final years and death In the following years, Abdallah Mirza was executed by Abu Sa'id Mirza, a grandson of Shah Rukh's elder brother Miran Shah, while Sultan Muhammad was killed by Abul-Qasim Babur, who himself died in 1457. The latter's successor, his eleven-year-old son Mahmud, was driven out of Herat by Ala al-Daula's son Ibrahim after a rule of only a few weeks. However, Ibrahim himself fled upon the approach of Abu Sa'id in July of that year, though the latter failed in capturing the city. These conflicts attracted the attention of Jahan Shah, the ruler of the Qara Qoyunlu, who defeated Ibrahim near Astarabad, forcing him to withdraw to Herat, where he was soon joined by Ala al-Dawla and his forces. However, neither had the strength to resist Jahan Shah and were forced to abandon the city, which was captured in June 1458. The following spring, the two princes made an alliance with Sultan Sanjar, who was a grandson of Shah Rukh's eldest brother Umar Shaikh, against Abu Sa'id. The two forces met in the Battle of Sarakhs, where Abu Sa'id emerged victorious. While Sultan Sanjar was captured and executed, Ala al-Dawla and his son escaped, though Ibrahim died only a few months later. Ala al-Dawla himself died in 1460, while in exile in the Caspian province of Rostamdar. He was buried in the Gawhar Shad Mausoleum complex in Herat.

In the late 1930s it changed its name to Radio Times. Radioprogram The first edition of Radioprogram was issued in July 1934. It covered the weekly programs for Melbourne's six major radio stations (3AR, 3LO, 3UZ, 3DB, 3KZ and 3AW) for the week 14‚Äì20 July.A copy is in the possession of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne. The programs for Cinderella station 3AK, which mainly broadcast in the early hours of the morning when other Melbourne stations were closed, were not included in early editions. Radioprogram displayed a dark brown cover with details of the magazine in white print. The first edition did not have any front-cover illustration, but later editions did. Issue No.1 was 122 x 184 mm; it soon evolved into 134 x 215 mm. By at least the beginning of 1936, the program guide had been expanded to include 3AK's schedules, as well as summaries of some interstate programs, along with an abbreviated list of some shortwave radio station's programs. It also included the programs for 3XY which had opened in 1935.Copies of some 1936 editions are in the possession of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne. The editor was Henry Drysdale Bett https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/289510https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bett-107 who was assisted by his brother, John Gordon Bett, and by Tam William Mappin, the Assistant Editor.Interview by Albert Isaacs with T.W.

It was renamed Radio Times.Some copies are in the possession of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne. After a short period in which Radio Times was printed in conventional black ink on white paper, it adopted a distinctive black ink on green paper format. After a few years, the Herald and Weekly Times decided that Radio Times was affecting the sales figures for the Listener- Inhttps://televisionau.com/2017/06/remembering-listener-in-tv-scene.html and therefore told newsagents that if they continued to sell Radio Times, all HWT publications would be withdrawn. In this era, HWT publications, including The Herald and The Sun News-Pictorial, would have accounted for a large percentage of all newsagents' sales. The Victorian Railways' bookstalls were the only newsagent chain large enough to stand up to the HWT and continue to stock Radio Times. With this one exception, Radio Times could only be obtained from milk bars. The details of the feud with HWT were reported in a number of editions of Radio Times. Until he died in 1969, H.

The Carmen (CPL 1431) survives in only one manuscript, Parisian Cod. Lat. 8084, a copy of the works of the Roman Christian poet Prudentius. It is found on folios 156r‚Äì158v.Markschies, Christoph (2006). \\"Carmen contra paganos\\". In: Christine F. Salazar and Francis G. Gentry (eds.). Brill's New Pauly. Leiden: E. J. Brill. It is not a work of high calibre. Its Latin is difficult to parse and often ungrammatical. Its prosody is often unmetrical. Its anti-pagan theme and tone are similar to that of the Carmen ad Antonium. It provides early evidence for the Christian reception of Virgil. The Carmen is written from a Christian perspective. It describes how an unnamed prefect (either a praefectus urbi or a praefectus praetorio) restored pagan practices at Rome, which offended God, who duly brought about his death. Theodor Mommsen identified the prefect with Virius Nicomachus Flavianus, who killed himself in 394 when the victory which his pagan sacrifices were supposed to secure failed to happen at the Battle of the Frigidus. On the basis of this identification, Mommsen published the poem under the name Carmen adversus Flavianum. An alternative theory identifies the patriarch of the Carmen with Gabinius Barbarus Pompeianus, who was prefect at Rome when Alaric besieged the city in 408‚Äì09. In response to the Gothic threat, Pompeianus permitted pagan rites to be celebrated, but he was lynched by a mob during a riot over food. The author of the Carmen is unknown. Fran√ßois Dolbeau suggested that it might have been Damasus I, who was pope between 366 and 384. This theory is incompatible with either of the proposed identifications of the prefect above. It is consistent with the prefect being Vettius Agorius Praetextatus, who died in 384. This sets the poem in the time of the pagan reaction led by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. The mountain is situated in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Mount Lago, to the north. Precipitation runoff from Monument Peak drains east into Monument Creek, and west into Eureka Creek, which are both part of the Methow River drainage basin. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Blackcap Mountain (left) and Monument Peak from Slate Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Harris is an American researcher and businessperson. He is best known for his work in artificial intelligence, and is founder of the companies AICorp and EasyAsk, originally known as Linguistic Technology Corporation. Early life and career Harris was born in 1947. He received his PhD from Cornell University in 1970, where his dissertation was entitled A Model for Adaptive Problem Solving Applied to Natural Language Acquisition. It focused on the process of how a robot might learn a language's vocabulary and grammar from exploring a room receiving commentary from a human. He then became an assistant professor, and later an associate professor, of Mathematics at Dartmouth College, and developed the first computer educational programs at the university. In 1973 he developed the Dartmouth Computer Chess Program, where he led a team of undergraduates to develop a computer chess program that competed in national computer chess tournaments. Harris also worked in helping machines solve language problems. As a researcher, he studied the area of Natural Language Data Base Query, providing the ability to ask ordinary English questions about the contents of computer databases. The research system was named ROBOT. Early papers of his were published in journals including the International Journal of Man-Machine Studies and the Journal of Cybernetics. In 1977 Harris was a Visiting Professor at the MIT AI Lab. Business career Harris cofounded Artificial Intelligence Corporation (later known as AICorp) in 1975, serving as CEO and Chairman, where he developed the mainframe product, INTELLECT, which was available for purchase as of 1981, and became a widely used natural language mainframe interface product in the early 1980s. The system used a basic lexicon of 400 words automatically augmented by the words and names in the database itself. In 1983, Intellect became the first software product created by an outside vendor to be sold by IBM. Through the product, Harris became one of the first entrepreneurs to make a profit based on artificial intelligence technology. In 1988 he also co-developed the Knowledge-Base Management System (KBMS), which enabled an inference engine to reason over information stored in relational databases. AICorp went public in 1990, trading on the NASDAQ. In 1994, Harris founded Linguistic Technology Corporation, which did business as EasyAsk, which enabled English language questions to be asked on personal computers about information in databases or on the internet. In 2005 EasyAsk was acquired by Progress Software. From 1995 to 2005, Harris served on the Board of Directors for Progress Software. Books In 1986 Harris co-authored the book Artificial Intelligence Enters the Marketplace with D.B.

Life was very hard on people in Izard County during the Civil War due to tremendous destruction, isolation, and failing crops. However, the family that remained in North Carolina were still in touch with those that attended the Campbell family reunion in Union Grove, North Carolina in 1925. The rest of his children remained in north Iredell County and neighboring Wilkes County, North Carolina. Growth of Perciphull's estate Campbell Mill on Hunting Creek Campbell Bridge and Mill on Hunting Creek Perciphull was too young (age nine in 1776) to be a soldier in the American Revolution. Adam Campbell's land north of Hunting Creek was deeded to his son William R. in 1783, probably upon Adam's death. That land was deeded to Claiborne Howard and Thomas Huie later in 1805 when William moved west. Adam's land south of Hunting Creek was deeded to his wife, Elizabeth in 1783, where she probably lived with Perciphull and his sister, Sarah, until she married. This land was deeded to Perciphull in 1795. On this land, he began to build a moderately prosperous plantation, including house and mills on the Hunting Creek in the early 1800s. He gradually accumulated slaves to help run the plantation and mills. By 1850, he owned 21 slaves. Perciphull accumulated a considerable estate during his lifetime. According to deeds on file in the Iredell County Courthouse, Perciphull Campbell bought an additional 1,081 acres of land north and south of the Hunting Creek and on the waters of the Rocky Branch between 1798 and 1836. *May 15, 1798, Peciphull bought land on a creek bank near points of rock and Lunceford's line from Elizabeth CampbellIredell County Deed Book C, page 118, Perciphull Campbell Grantee, Elizabeth Campbell Grantor, May 15, 1798; Witnesses: Theophelus Campbell, John Morgan, Nimrod Lunceford (Jurat) * 1819, Perciphull bought several tracts of land (250, 151, 20 acres) on Hunting CreekIredell County Deed Book J, page 575 (Eli Lunceford, Sept 11, 1818, $400, Hunting Creek on Deals and Owens Branches, 250 acres, witness Theo M Campbell and John Campbell, proven in February session 1819), page 576 (Reuben Morgan, Sept 19, 1818, $301.25, north side of Hunting Creek to Surry County line, 151 acres, witness Theo M Campbell, Sampson Ball, registered Feb 15, 1819), page 705 (Thomas Rash, May 19, 1812/1820, $30, on banks of Hunting Creek, 20 acres, witnesses Theophilus Campbell and Perciphull Campbell, Jr.) * May 10, 1822, Perciphull bought additional 160 acres of land on Hunting Creek from Alexander Hall and Stephen Sharpe for $200 and Iredell County Deed Book L, page 207 (Alexander Hall, Stephen Sharpe, 160 acres, $200) filed on May 10, 1822 and issued in the February session 1823; Deed Book L, page 375 (Martin Morgan, $50, filed February 2, 1821, parcel of land on waters of the Rocky Branch section of Hunting Creek, witness Thomas Mahaffey, John Campbell, and A Gill) * 1829, Perciphull bought a parcel of land on Hunting Creek from Martin Morgan for $100Iredell County Deed Book N, page 456 (Martin Morgan) * 1836, Perciphull bought 750 acres on Big Rocky Creek for $4,000. Perciphull Campbell, Sr. lived here until his death. His home on Rocky Creek was later called the J.P. Bolin homeplace. His son, Perciphull Campbell, Jr. occupied his home and mill on Hunting Creek after his father moved to Rocky Creek.Iredell County Deed Book T, page 94 (Sandy R. White), witnesses John R. Campbell and Perciphull Campbell, Jr. Perciphull Campbell was a justice of the peace in Iredell County. In this capacity, he was able to perform marriages. In a local poll, six of the couples that he married were known to be pro-Andrew Jackson in the presidential election of 1828. On September 8, 1843, Perciphull sold two acres of land on Hunting Creek for $10 to a committee of Iredell County School District Number 4 for the purpose of building a free school. School District 4 was located on the north side of Hunting Creek.Iredell County Deed Book W, page 183, September 8, 1843, Grantor: P. Campbell, Sr.; Grantee: School District #4 committee =House and mills= Alice Campbell on the porch of the Perciphull Campbell house in about 1930 Perciphull built his first home on Hunting Creek in about 1820. This property included a smoke house, main house in the I-frame style, grist mills powered by the Hunting Creek using tubs, slaves, and later a covered bridge over the Hunting Creek. The principal crops on the estate were wheat, rye, oats, and corn (most widely produced). When Perciphull died, his oldest living son, Perciphull Campbell, Jr. inherited the Hunting Creek house and mill. Perciphull Campbell, Jr. lived there with his wife, Tabitha, from 1836 until his death in 1863. After Perciphill Campbell, Jr.'s death, his wife Tabitha lived on the estate with their oldest son, Leolin V. Campbell. Leolin died intestate in 1888 and the estate was first owned by his estranged wife, Margaret Emma (Buxton) Campbell. After she died in 1864, the estate passed to his daughter by his first marriage, Alice Campbell, who lived there until she died in 1939. Although the mill was a working mill into the 20th century, few remnants remain. The house on Hunting Creek was still occupied in 2019. The covered bridge was still there in the late 1930s and was the last covered bridge in Iredell County. After Alice's death, the estate was no longer owned by Perchiphull Campbell's descendants. Perciphull, Sr. and Jr., Leolin, and Alice Campbell are all buried at the Campbell Family cemetery near the unincorporated town of Union Grove., alternate URL There was severe flooding in Iredell County in August 1848 that left only three mills operatingthe Campbell Mill, Jennings mill, and the Diffy Mill.The Heritage of Iredell County, 1980, published by the Genealogical Society of Iredell County, PO Box 946, Statesville, North Carolina 28677, , 642 pages with index, article number 54, pages 62-63 =Slaves= Perciphull did not own any slaves in 1790.

Founding of the town of Williamsburg Perciphull lived in an area that was about 20 miles north of Statesville, the first town in Iredell County. Statesville was created on the site of the old Fourth Creek Congregation in 1789. The earliest church in the area where Perciphull lived was Grassy Knob Baptist Church (established in 1794), where he was amongst the first members according to the church history. The nearest town of any size was Houstonville, established by Christopher Houston as the second Iredell County town in 1789 and a post office was established there in 1804. Christopher Houston thought the north end of the county needed a town. However, Christopher moved to Tennessee in 1815 and the town of Houstonville never became more than a small community. There was a need for a town in the north end of the county. With his growing stature as a successful planter, Perciphull was chosen as one of the commissioners appointed by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1815 to lay out a new town, Williamsburg, in north Iredell County. The other commissioners were Amos Sharpe (brother of William Sharpe, Reuben Morgan (son of Theophilus Morgan), and John Cowden. Williamsburg was the second town to be established by legislative act in Iredell County. The town was laid off on lands owned by William Harbin and James Moody. Early land records show a King Street and Stewart Street in Williamsburg. A post office was established in Williamsburg in 1817 with William Harbin as postmaster. There is some evidence that a tavern owned by William Harbin existed in Williamsburg before 1830 and there are family traditions of a horse racing circuit near the town. William Harbin gave the land where the tavern was located to form a church, Macedonia Methodist Church which continued to the 21st century. Jesse Fraley and his brother John A. Fraley had a general store in Williamsburg as early as 1842. Other pre-Civil War towns in this area included New Hope Forge (post office established in 1827) and Crater's Mill (post office established in 1851). After the U.S. Civil War, the town of Williamsburg was overshadowed by the communities of Harmony and Union Grove. Most of Perciphull's descendants that remained in North Carolina lived closer to Union Grove and Harmony. The post office in Williamsburg lasted until 1905. Eventually, the charter for the forgotten town of Williamsburg was repealed by the state legislature in 1971. Religion and death Tombstone of P. Campbell (born Apr 13, 1767, died June 6, 1853) Masonic Symbol Perciphull Campbell died on June 6, 1853 and was buried in the Campbell Family Cemetery, along with his wife who predeceased him. According to Perciphull's tombstone inscription, he was a Mason. He was a Baptist and worshipped at the Grassy Knob Baptist Church (established in 1794), which was the only church in the area before 1800. Zion Baptist Church, near Union Grove, was established on June 4, 1825. His descendants have and continue to worship at both churches.History of Grassy Knob Baptist Church Descendants 1925 Campbell Family Reunion, Union Grove, North Carolina After Perciphull's death on June 6, 1853, some of the descendants of Perciphull Campbell continued to live and work in Union Grove Township well into the 21st century. Beginning in 1925, the Campbell family began a tradition of family reunions and documented the history of the Campbell family descended from Perchipull Campbell. There were between 2,000 and 2,500 people at this first reunion. Through 1925, the family that remained in Union Grove Township continued to correspond with relations that had moved to Izard County, Arkansas before the U.S. Civil War. The History of the Campbell Family was compiled in 1925 by Henry Pierce Van Hoy using locally available property records, wills, and oral traditions. (He was a descendant of Sarah Campbell, daughter of John R. Campbell, who married William A. Van Hoy.) It was given out at the first annual Campbell family reunion in Union Grove, Iredell, North Carolina. Later generations using modern genealogical methods with greater access to records of the time of Adam Campbell and his descendants have verified and added to the history in the 1925 history.

History 3ve, pronounced as ‚ÄúEve‚Äù, was a botnet that was halted in late 2018. The botnet was first discovered in 2016 by White Ops, and was active since at least 2013. The discovery led to the start of a 2017 FBI investigation. The botnet 3ve utilized the malware packages Boaxxe and Kovter to infect a network of PCs. They were spread through emails and fake downloads, and once infected, the bots would generate fake clicks on online advertisements. The clicks would be used on fake websites, which hosted ads and then absorbed the ad revenue from the false impressions. Bots were able to mimic desktop and mobile traffic in order to evade detection, and went through several evolutions of tactics to grow over time. At its peak, the botnet controlled more than one million residential and corporate IP-addresses, largely within Europe and North America. It is estimated that 1.7 million PCs were infected over time, clicking on more than ten thousand fake websites with more than 250,000 total webpages, taking in ad revenue from about sixty thousand digital advertising accounts placing the false ads. The network issued more than three billion fraudulent daily ad bid requests. About thirty million dollars was stolen over the time the botnet was in use. Closure The bot net was shut down through a collaboration of multiple organizations, including White Ops, Google, Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center. Other organizations involved included Adobe, the Trade Desk, Amazon Advertising, Oath, Malwarebytes, ESET, Proofpoint, Symantec, F-Secure, McAfee, and Trend Micro. Following the end of investigation that took down the botnet, the Department of Justice issued thirteen indictments against eight individuals, in a case led by United States Attorney Richard P.

History Methbot was first tracked in 2015 by cybersecurity firm White Ops, and the botnet saw rapidly increased activity in 2016. The botnet originated in Russia (though it was not state sponsored), and utilized foreign computers and networks in Europe and North America. The infrastructure consisted of 571,904 dedicated IPs, 6,000 domains, and 250,267 distinct URLs, each of which could only house a video ad, and used variants of the names of famous publishers to fool those looking into the domains. This led the operators to game the system, leading ad selection algorithms to select these fake web pages over larger corporate pages from legitimate companies, and charge advertisers at a premium. About 570,000 bots were used to execute clicks on those websites, ‚Äúwatching‚Äù up to 300 million video ads a day while the bots mimicked normal computer user behavior. Estimated clicks per day generally reached between 200 and 300 million per day. The botnet relied on data servers instead of more traditional botnets that rely on infected PCs and mobile devices. At its peak, Methbot was making its operators‚Äîwhich were dubbed the Ad Fraud Komanda‚Äîup to between three and five million dollars per day for between $180 million and $1 billion dollar in losses to the ad industry, while some other estimates were nearer to half a million per day. At the time, it was the largest and most profitable ad fraud network established, before it was discovered in late 2016.

It was created by Yin Wang and Ben Anderson in 2014. History In 2012, Wang and Anderson came up with the idea for a convention-like community while attending an anime convention in Boston, Massachusetts. Later that year, they would release two apps revolving around K-pop and photography that allowed fans of those subjects to chat freely. In 2014, Amino was officially released, and the K-pop and photography apps previously released became the first Amino communities. In July 2014, Anderson and Wang launched the parent company of Amino Apps, Narvii, and received $1.7 million dollars in seed funding. Growth The Amino app grew quickly, with 47 communities being launched in the first year. Fandoms had migrated from websites like Facebook and Reddit to Amino, partly because of the app's mobile-native experience. Before 2016, when a user wanted to join a new Amino, they had to download another app for the Amino they wanted to join. In 2016, Amino Apps launched a centralized portal that hosted every Amino community in one app, meaning users no longer had to download multiple apps. In the same year, ACM, an app that allowed users to create their own communities, was launched. This resulted in the number of communities on Amino skyrocketing to over 2.5 million. Features The main feature of Amino is communities dedicated to a certain topic that users can join. Users can also chat with other members of a community in three ways, text, voice, or screening room, which allows users to watch videos together while voice chatting. Other features include polls, blog posts, image posts, wiki entries, stories, and quizzes. In some rare cases, posts that are very well-made and have been noticed by a community‚Äôs administration will end up receiving a Feature, making it appear on the wiki‚Äôs front page along with other featured content. In 2019, Amino introduced six original short-form animated series, labeled \\"Amino Originals,\\" produced by independent artists from across the internet. ATJ's \\"Little Red,\\" a re-imagining of Little Red Riding Hood, premiered on November 15th, 2019. \\"Little Red\\" was joined by five other shows in late December. Sophie Feher's \\"The Reef,\\" a comedy featuring an aspiring marine biologist meeting a merman, premiered on December 27th alongside \\"Princely,\\" an LGBT fairy tale created by Matt Bruneau-Richardson of Tiny Siren Animation. \\"Spaced Out,\\" an alien abduction comedy by Michael Jae, and YouTuber Alex Clark's \\"Wyndvania II\\" premiered on December 28th. Mysie Pereira's fairy tale \\"Turned to Stone\\" and Marcin Pawlowski's \\"Stranded\\" premiered on December 29th, 2019. Administration On each community, there are two types of staff members, these being ‚ÄòLeader‚Äô and ‚ÄòCurator.‚Äô Leaders are the highest rank, having access to all features on the community such as being able to edit themes, feature content, punish members, and many more. Curators on the other hand, have less perks, and mainly focus on managing the community when Leaders aren‚Äôt around. Curators are usually the ones who feature posts, or post important announcements for users to see. Funding Amino received $1.7 million dollars in seed funding in July 2014. In September 2015, Amino received $6.5 million in Series A funding. In Series B and C funding, Amino received $19.2 million and $45 million, respectively. Amino has raised a total of $72.4 million dollars over those four funding rounds. Amino Apps is also partnered with All Ages of Geek. Apps Users who manage popular communities which get noticed by Narvii Inc. were capable of receiving a separate application for their community only, however this has changed and all activity now takes place in the Amino app. = Community Manager = This application is what users use to create and manage their own community in Amino.

The show received a script order and was developed by Craig Silverstein and Warner Bros. Television but was not developed any further than the scripting stage. NBC would later go on to produce Grimm, a police procedural set in a world where fairytales are real. On December 8, 2008 it was announced that ABC had picked up the rights to develop a pilot of Fables for the 2009‚Äì2010 television season. Six Degrees creators and executive producers Stu Zicherman and Raven Metzner was writing the script for the hour- long drama, again set up at Warner Brothers Television, while David Semel came on board to direct.

Since then, there has been no further announcements. Fables video game On February 17, 2011, Telltale Games announced The Wolf Among Us, an episodic graphic adventure game based upon Fables. With the first of its five episodes released on October 11, 2013 (and the final episode released on July 8, 2014), the game is canon with the comic book universe and is set as a prequel to the comic book. In July 2017 Telltale Games announced that a second season of The Wolf Among Us was in production, and was planned to be released sometime in 2018. However, it was announced in May 2018 that the game was delayed and was rescheduled for release in 2019 before ultimately being cancelled in September 2018 following the studio's closure. =The Books of Magic film= A film version of The Books of Magic has been in development hell for many years. It was originally optioned by Warner Bros. for some years before the first Harry Potter book was published, with Neil Gaiman signing on as executive producer in 1998. After several years of drafting and redrafting, the script moved so far from the original concept that Gaiman and Paul Levitz advised the filmmakers that any audience seeing it expecting a film based on the comic would be disappointed, and decided to develop the movie themselves. They worked with screenwriter Matt Greenberg, who had written early drafts of the original script, to come up with some closer to the original story, but nothing came from this. =Astro City= Astro City film In 2003, Ben Barenholtz, Jonathan Alpers and Kurt Busiek hoped to develop an Astro City film, with Barenholtz as producer and Alpers as lead scripter, but the plans did not take off, whereupon Barenholtz subsequently took the project to Working Title Films. In July 2010, it was announced that Working Title had acquired the rights to make a live-action feature film adaptation of Astro City. Busiek was to write a script treatment, and also to executive-produce, along with Barenholtz and Alpers. On May 10, 2013 Kurt Busiek reported that Working Title's option had lapsed but he was in negotiation with another party. Astro City TV series In March 2018, FremantleMedia North America announced a live-action Astro City TV series with a pilot episode written by Busiek and Rick Alexander. There have been no developments since. =The American Way film= In 2018, John Ridley is working with Blumhouse Productions to adapt his comic into a film and direct. There has been no further development since. =Codename: Knockout film= In 2001, Codename: Knockout artist Louis Small, Jr. reported that Warner Bros. had picked up the option to adapt the comic series into a film, and commissioned a script, but nothing coming out of this. =Y: The Last Man film= The film rights to the Y: The Last Man series were acquired by New Line Cinema (a sister company to Vertigo), and in July 2007 screenwriter Carl Ellsworth and director D. J. Caruso were attached to the project with David S. Goyer as a producer. Caruso intended on finishing the script in the summer and filming during the fall of 2008. The script would be a rewrite of the original draft written by Jeff Vintar. Although Vintar's draft was faithful to the original comic book and considered by many to be a success, the higher-ups at New Line Cinema seemed unable to fully embrace the material. A subsequent draft by Vaughan himself, which departed from his own comic considerably, was even less successful in convincing the studio to proceed. Caruso maintained that the source material was too much to be told in one film and his team decided to concentrate on the best first film they could, which would end somewhere around issue 14 of the comic series. The entire comic series as a whole would be plotted into three films. Actor Shia LaBeouf, who has worked with these writers for the films Disturbia and Eagle Eye, has previously stated that he is unwilling to play the role of Yorick. According to LaBeouf, the role is far too similar to the character Sam Witwicky, which he portrays in the Transformers series. In an interview conducted by collider.com, LaBeouf stated that there is still a chance that he would be starring. Caruso planned to use a real monkey, and not a CGI construct, to play Ampersand. Caruso also said he would like to have Alicia Keys for the part of Agent 355. Zachary Levi, who plays the lead in the TV series Chuck, has expressed interest in playing Yorick as he is a fan of the comic book series, even going as far as having his character Chuck Bartowski read the Y: The Last Man graphic novel in the episode \\"Chuck Versus the Nacho Sampler\\". Caruso remained \\"loosely attached\\" to the project, but New Line refused to acquiesce on its development as a stand-alone film as opposed to the trilogy Caruso (who has since moved on to direct the science fiction film I Am Number Four) preferred. Caruso, maintaining \\"I didn't think that you could take Yorick's story and put it in to a two-hour movie and do it justice... I just feel like it's too much for one screenplay,\\" ultimately walked away from the project. In March 2012, former Jericho writers Matthew Federman and Stephen Scaia entered final negotiations to write New Line's adaptation of the series, following in the footsteps of Vintar, Vaughan, and Ellsworth. J.C. Spink, Chris Bender and David Goyer were attached to produce; Mason Novick and Jake Weiner are executive producers. Reports in September 2012 suggested New Line was enthusiastic about the draft screenplay produced by Federman and Scaia, and had begun the process of meeting potential directors to hire for the project. In January 2013, it was announced that Dan Trachtenberg will direct the film. In June 2013, producer David Goyer announced having \\"a script that's as close as it's ever been,\\" and suggested the film could go into production in 2014. However, in January 2014, Brian K. Vaughan stated \\"It's my understanding that the rights to Y: The Last Man will revert to co-creator Pia Guerra and me for the first time in a decade if the planned New Line adaptation doesn't start shooting in the next few months.\\" On September 24, Trachtenberg tweeted that the film was \\"Not happening. But it's in trusted hands (the creators).\\" In a subsequent interview he noted that in fact, \\"The rights reverted back to Brian quite a few months ago.\\" A television series called \\"Y\\" starring Diane Lane as Yorick Brown's mother Senator Jennifer Brown, Imogen Poots as Yorick's sister Hero Brown, and Lashana Lynch as Agent 355 is set to premiere on FX in 2020. =We3 film= New Line Cinema announced in June 2005 that it had optioned We3, with that comic's writer, Grant Morrison, then in negotiations to write the screenplay. On December 9, 2008, it was reported that John Stevenson, director of Kung Fu Panda was attached to the project as a director, and that New Line Cinema was no longer involved.Turek, Ryan. \\"Stevenson Attached to Direct Comic Adaptation We3\\" Shock Till You Drop. December 8, 2008 , the status of the film is that Morrison has written the script, but the project appears to have stalled, partially due to concerns over the level of violence. Morrison said in an interview that \\"Relativity Pictures keeps saying they're doing it, and they still haven't done it\\", and that he cannot say anything more as it stands. =FBP: Federal Bureau of Physics film= In April 2014, Deadline announced the production of a movie adaptation of Vertigo's FBP: Federal Bureau of Physics. Justin Marks and David Goyer will be reuniting for the production of the film, with Nellie Reed producing. Since then, there has been no more announcements. =Early attempt of DMZ TV series= In February 2014 it was announced that Syfy is planning on making a TV series adaptation of the DMZ comics with former Mad Men writers and executive producers Andre and Maria Jacquemetton. Executive producer for the pilot is David Heyman, who previously worked on Harry Potter, Gravity and is working on the film adaptation of the Vertigo comic series Fables. In October 2019, Ava DuVernay was announced as a producer of the HBO Max iteration of the series, with DuVernay directing the pilot and Roberto Patino as writer and showrunner. =Amped/Jacked TV series= In April 2015, it was announced that Supernatural creator Eric Kripke is writing the comic book series called Amped (later retitled Jacked) for DC and Vertigo to be released in fall 2015. In the same time it was announced that USA Network are developing a TV adaptation of the comic book series. Kripke will serve as both writer and executive producer of the show. The series will be co-produced by Kripke Enterprises and Warner Horizon Television. No production news has followed since. =The Exterminators TV series= In July 2008, Showtime announced that it would develop the Vertigo series The Exterminators as a one-hour drama.

The pilot order was given on March 7, 2016. In February 2017, Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi began directing the pilot, but in November, after WGN saw the pilot episode, they decided to abandon the series. =100 Bullets= 100 Bullets TV series On June 23, 2011, IGN reported that David S. Goyer, co-writer of Dark City and The Dark Knight, was attached to executive produce and write a TV series based on 100 Bullets for Showtime. However, in a June 2013 interview with Ain't It Cool News, Goyer stated that the project got \\"incredibly close\\" at Showtime before being turned down due to a multitude of mass shootings across the United States. He called the sudden turn of events \\"frustrating\\", further stating, \\"At one point, I thought it was going to happen at Showtime. It got to the three-yard line.\\" 100 Bullets film On April 28, 2014, SciFiNow reported The Wall Street Journal release of information regarding upcoming Warner Brothers films based on DC Comics properties. The films that were revealed to be in development included the much anticipated Justice League film; Shazam!, Fables, and 100 Bullets were among the other films listed, and are currently in varying stages of production. In August 2015, it was announced that a film adaptation is being produced by Tom Hardy with the option for him to star in the film. It was to be written by Chris Borrelli and distributed by New Line Cinema. =The Sandman film= Throughout the late 1990s, a film adaptation of The Sandman was periodically planned by Warner Bros., parent company of DC Comics. Roger Avary was originally attached to direct after the success of Pulp Fiction, collaborating with Pirates of the Caribbean screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio in 1996 on a revision of their first script draft, which merged the \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" storyline with that of \\"The Doll's House.\\" Avary intended the film to be in part visually inspired by animator Jan ≈†vankmajer's work. Avary was fired after disagreements over the creative direction with executive producer Jon Peters, best known for Batman and Superman Lives. It was due to their meeting on the Sandman film project that Avary and Gaiman collaborated one year later on the script for Beowulf. The project carried on through several more writers and scripts. A later draft by William Farmer, reviewed at Ain't It Cool News, was met with scorn from fans. Gaiman called the last screenplay that Warner Bros. would send him \\"not only the worst Sandman script I've ever seen, but quite easily the worst script I've ever read.\\" Gaiman has said that his dissatisfaction with how his characters were being treated had dissuaded him from writing any more stories involving the Endless, although he has since written Endless Nights. By 2001, the project had become stranded in development hell. In a Q&A; panel at Comic-Con 2007, Gaiman remarked, \\"I'd rather see no Sandman movie made than a bad Sandman movie. But I feel like the time for a Sandman movie is coming soon. We need someone who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with Lord of the Rings or Sam Raimi had with Spider-Man.\\" That same year, he stated that he could imagine Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: \\"I would always give anything to Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do Sandman then as far as I'm concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman.\\" In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a Sandman film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced in an interview in early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told Deadline Hollywood in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film's script. According to Deadline.com, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film's script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead. =HBO's Preacher TV series= HBO announced in November 2006 it was adapting Preacher as a one-hour television series, with a pilot episode written by Mark Steven Johnson and directed by Howard Deutch.Kit, Borys. \\"HBO hears word, brings 'Preacher' to small screen\\".

Blog@Newsarama, August 26, 2008 Later it was announced that AMC bought the rights for a TV adaptation developed by Sam Catlin, Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen and Neal H. Moritz. =Transmetropolitan film= Co-creators Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson were approached about making a Transmetropolitan film adaptation, with Patrick Stewart's production company Flying Freehold Productions offering to option the rights in February 2003. Later, the burgeoning Internet boom led to an offer to create an online animated film series, with Stewart providing the voice of Spider Jerusalem, but the project never fully developed. Ellis and Robertson have been rumored to have indicated that they would like to see Tim Roth play Jerusalem; however, during a panel at London's Kapow! comic convention Ellis said that there is no chance of seeing Spider Jerusalem on the big screen and Tim Roth was not discussed to play him, and explained that production costs would be too high to bring Transmetropolitan to the big screen. In 2010, Ellis noted in his Twitter account that production discussions have ceased.Warren Ellis on Twitter, June 12, 2010. =Death: The High Cost of Living film= Since the late 1990s, a film based on Death: The High Cost of Living, to be called Death and Me, was under production at New Line Cinema. Neil Gaiman wrote the screenplay, and would also direct, with Guillermo del Toro as executive producer. Gaiman spent several days on the set of del Toro's film Hellboy II: The Golden Army to get pointers on how to direct.Del Toro Wants Gaiman On Death Other than two additional scenes at the beginning (set in a Tibetan monastery and Alaska), and a move from New York City to London for the main setting, the screenplay was relatively unchanged from the comic script. After being in development hell for several years, work on it was renewed in 2007, but quickly derailed again due to the WGA strikes.Death: The High Cost of Striking According to Gaiman, the studio \\"may still be New Line, but Warner Independent is keen on it too.\\" Shia LaBeouf may have had a role in the film, possibly as the lead character Sexton, due to his help in trying to get the movie developed.Neil Gaiman Looks Beyond ‚ÄòStardust‚Äô And Into ‚ÄòDeath‚Äô On October 14, 2010 it was reported in an interview with Gaiman that as of June or July, DC and Warner Bros. had closed down work on the film and it was unclear if they would start it up again.The Vulture Transcript: Neil Gaiman on Comics, Twilight, Twitter Etiquette, Killing Batman, and Sharing Porn With His Son =V for Vendetta TV series= In October 2017, it was announced that Channel 4 was developing a television series based on V for Vendetta.

Since then, there has been no further announcements. =Survivors Club TV series= In November 2018, it was announced that The CW was developing a television project based on the Survivors Club comic series from Sweet/Vicious writer Jared Frieder and Hart of Dixie producer Len Goldstein. Since then, there has been no further announcements. =Ex Machina film= On July 14, 2005, New Line Cinema announced that they picked up the rights to make a film based on the Ex Machina comic book series. On 17 January 2020, it was announced that Oscar Isaac would produce and star as Hundred in a film adaptation. The film is set to be retitled The Great Machine in order to avoid confusion with the film Ex Machina and Isaac's previous involvement in said film. =League of Extraordinary Gentlemen = League of Extraordinary Gentlemen reboot The Tracking Board reported on May 26, 2015, that 20th Century Fox and Davis Entertainment had agreed to develop a reboot with hopes of launching a franchise. The report stated that a search was underway for a director who could help \\"continue to develop the reboot\\". John Davis told Collider in an interview that the reboot will be a female- centric film.

Should the project go to series, showrunner Erwin Stoff would also executive produce. Neither Moore nor O'Neill would be producers on the series. It had also been reported that the pilot episode would still be broadcast, even if Fox opted not to green-light the series.Bibel, Sara (July 9, 2013).

RED TV series NBC was developing a RED TV series with the Hoeber brothers, Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Mark Vahradian. There have been no new production announcements since. =Global Frequency TV series= Mark Burnett prepared a Global Frequency television series for 2005 with Michelle Forbes as Miranda Zero, Josh Hopkins as Sean Flynn, Jenni Baird as Dr. Katrina Finch and Aimee Garcia as Aleph. The characters of Sean Flynn, an ex-policeman who accidentally stumbled on a Global Frequency mission, and Katrina Finch, a brilliant scientist with expertise in multiple fields, were created especially for the series. Unlike the comic book, which had an ever- changing cast of field agents, Flynn and Finch were to be regulars along with Zero and Aleph, with other Frequency members coming in as and when necessary in supporting roles. This would allow for the character continuity expected of a television series and yet allow other characters to be killed off as in the comic book. A pilot episode, based heavily on the first issue of the comic book, was produced, but The WB (the original intended network) did not commission the series. John Rogers was the principal creative force behind the television incarnation, writing the pilot episode, with Ellis credited as producer and creator. Other writers waiting to come on board included David Slack, Ben Edlund and Diego Gutierrez. The pilot was directed by Nelson McCormick. The unaired pilot was leaked onto the Internet in June 2005 and continues to be downloaded and shared, primarily via BitTorrent and other P2P networks. Although it was popular and critically acclaimed, according to Ellis himself the leaking of the pilot annoyed Warner Brothers to the extent that they killed the project. In November 2009, Production Weekly's Twitter feed revealed that a new television adaptation of Global Frequency was being worked on by The CW Television Network and writer Scott Nimerfro. In November 2014, it was announced that Fox was producing a new Global Frequency pilot, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and written by Rockne S. O'Bannon. In February 2015, bleedingcool.com revealed that Fox will not order the pilot for Global Frequency due to problems with the script. =Battle Chasers film= In March 2003, Twentieth Century Fox has optioned feature rights to Battle Chasers with Gil Netter attached as a producer. There has been no further news since. =The Boys film= Variety reported in February 2008 that Columbia Pictures had optioned the comic for a film adaptation, to be produced by Neal H. Moritz, and Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi writing the screenplay. In August 2010, Adam McKay said that he had been signed on to direct the film. McKay added, \\"They already have a script and we're doing a rewrite on it so hopefully getting the whole thing into shape in the Fall with maybe a shoot happening in January.\\" Columbia Pictures reported in February 2012 that it had dropped its option regarding a film adaptation of The Boys. However, Adam McKay said in a Twitter response that Paramount Pictures had picked it up, and that it was still in the works. On April 30, 2013, Manfredi and Hay were hired by Paramount to write the film, though the project never came to fruition. Later it was announced that Amazon Prime bought the rights for a TV adaptation developed by Eric Kripke, Evan Goldberg, and Seth Rogen. =Darkchylde film= In August 2007, Randy Queen, creator of the comic book character Darkchylde, revealed to Newsarama that a movie is in the works. In an interview with Nicholas Yanes from scifipulse.net, Queen was asked and responded to a question about a film/television adaptation of Darkchylde: \\"Yanes: For years now there have been rumors of Darkchylde being turned into an animated series, miniseries for a cable network and movie. Are you able to comment on Darkchylde's potential future on in television and film? Any actresses you'd love to play Ariel? Queen: A movie makes so much sense it's ridiculous, and all I can say is that we are working on it. I know that's a frustrating answer for fans, but it's a frustrating process. It's probably best for me not to comment on actresses, so we'll just all have to wait and see.\\" Test footage from the set of Darkchylde emerged in July 2010 and on October 31, 2010, it was announced John Carpenter was to direct. Since then, there has not been any further announcements, falling into development hell. =Sleeper film= In August 2008, Tom Cruise and Sam Raimi were in the process of creating a movie adaptation of Sleeper with Warner Bros., in which Cruise may have starred and Brad Inglesby writing the screenplay, but this rumor went cold. In November 2013, the magazine Variety reported that Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Todd would produce the film and Shawn Ryan and David Wiener to pen the film. Since then, there has not been any further announcements, falling into development hell. =Ocean film= In 2007, the comic had been optioned by Gianni Nunnari and Nick Wechsler, who have history with films based on comics, the former produced 300 and the duo were slated to produce the film based on Ronin. Ryan Condal, writer of the spec script Galahad, had been approached by Warner Brothers to produce a screenplay for them. Since then, there has been no further announcements. =Mad animated series attempts= A 1974 Mad animated television pilot using selected material from the magazine was commissioned by ABC but the network decided to not broadcast it. Dick DeBartolo noted, \\"Nobody wanted to sponsor a show that made fun of products that were advertised on TV, like car manufacturers.\\" The program was instead created into a TV special, and is available for online viewing. In the mid-1980s, Hanna-Barbera developed another potential Mad animated television series that was never broadcast.

She was the first Commissioner for Equal Opportunity appointed by the Victorian Government under the Equal Opportunity Act 1984, an office which she held until 1994. In this position she was responsible for monitoring the Equal Opportunity Act; the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, and the Commonwealth legislated Sex Discrimination Act 1984. Simultaneously, in 1986, she was appointed a Commissioner of the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia, a position she held until 1990. In 2000 Rayner became the first Director of the office of Children's Rights Commissioner for the city of London, UK. in 1994 the Australian Federal government appointed her to the Institute of Family Studies to undertake a special project to fight child abuse. Rayner used her time in her official positions, and as an author and activist, to address issues and support campaigns for the rights of women in society and the rights of children in the legal system. Many of her activities in these spheres have been innovative and thus publicly and politically controversial. Early life and education Rayner is a great granddaughter of the New Zealand politician and Minister for Native Affairs, John Bryce. She was born in Dunedin, New Zealand into an observant Protestant family, the second of three children. She completed her primary and secondary education at Columba College, Dunedin, and at the age of sixteen her family moved to Western Australia, where she began her study of law. Having graduated with honours in law from the University of Western Australia, Rayner was admitted to the Bar in 1972 and, at age 27, established her own legal firm. She also practised as a solicitor advocate in Perth from 1975. As a barrister she joined the Independent Western Australian Bar Association in 1985. Career In 1986 she was appointed a Commissioner of the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia a position she held until 1990. In 1987 she completed a Churchill Fellowship on the rights of children in the legal system of the United Kingdom. In 1988 she was elected Chairman of the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia. From 1990 until 1994 Rayner held the office of Victorian Commissioner for Equal Opportunity in Victoria, the body responsible for monitoring the application of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984; Racial Discrimination Act 1975, and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986., and the Commonwealth legislated Sex Discrimination Act 1984‚Äô'. In a 1994 dispute with the newly elected government led by Jeff Kennett regarding Rayner's stance against the closure of women's prisons in Victoria, the Act was amended and the office of Commissioner was abolished. Later in 1994 the Australian Federal government appointed her to the Institute of Family Studies to undertake a special project to fight child abuse. Rayner then joined the national law firm Dunhill Madden Butler (later Norton Rose Fulbright) where she practised industrial, workplace relations and discrimination law for seven years (1994-2001). Until 2000 Rayner chaired both the Financial Planning Association's independent Dispute Resolution Scheme, and the Board of Directors of the National Children's and Youth Law Centre Inc. In 2000, Rayner moved to London to work with the Lord Mayor of the Greater London Authority, as the founding Director of the independently funded Office of the Children's Rights Commissioner for London implementing provisions of United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (2003). Rayner resigned as Acting Commissioner of the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia amid an accusation of corruption of which she was later acquitted. She had warned a dying friend that he should be careful what he said on the phone as authorities could be listening. The jury judged it to be a \\"slip of the tongue\\", made in a moment of distress without criminal intent. In reply to a question by ABC journalist Rachael Kohn, Rayner described the incident. > I was (falsely) accused of acting with the corrupt intention of perverting > the course of justice, by visiting a long-term friend of mine who was dying > in a hospice. He had been found to have been stealing from the parliament > and to have been using drugs, which were totally out of character.

For the last fifteen years Rayner has been a prolific commentator in the online current affairs periodical New Matilda. Articles include analyses of animal rights, indigenous policy, human rights, funeral celebrancy and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the London bombing attacks, and Michael Jackson‚Äôs victims. https://newmatilda.com/?s=Moira+Rayner In Eureka Street she wrote defending Victorian Police Commissioner Christine Nixon. Spiritual journey Rayner was raised in a very observant Presbyterian family in which she claims to have been influenced to believe in high ideals of justice and fairness. Later on she explored various forms of religious belief. She was particularly influenced by the early spiritual teaching of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as 'Osho') known as the Orange People and their deep focus on meditation. She spent time in the Rajneesh community in Pune, India and in Oregon in the USA . In recent years she has become deeply influenced by the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. As a member of the teaching team at the Campion Centre of Ignatian Spirituality in Kew, Victoria, she guides persons in the Spiritual Exercises.

Built in 1915 to house a printing company, it later was home to a junior college, a prep school, a Masonic Temple, a school district office, a sheriff's substation, a live-in studio for a photographer, a karate studio, a commercial business, and community events. In 2017, the building, in a state of disrepair, was put up for public auction and purchased for $300,000 by the non-profit Atascadero Printery Foundation, which plans to restore and remodel it as a community center.  History  The founder of the city, and publisher by trade, Edward Gardner Lewis built the edifice in 1915 for the printing of his magazines and periodicals. Sources vary on the dimensions of the building, ranging from to . In 1916, 100,000 copies of the Atascadero News were printed here. At the time, Lewis had several magazines in circulation targeted to women, as well as a national daily newspaper. For a period, the San Francisco Chronicle Sunday circular was also printed in the building. Some sources cite that the site housed the first and largest rotogravure printing press in the United States, while others say it was at least the first in the Western United States. During the printing house era, nearly one million copies of print media were published in the printery, making it \\"the largest and most prolific operation in America\\". The printing company closed in the late 1920s and the building housed two prep schools before being purchased by the Masonic Temple Association in the 1950s. Around 1994, the Masons donated 99% of the building to the City of Atascadero with the hopes of it being renovated into a youth center, and a later condition that if it were not, ownership would revert to the Masons. The city decided it was more cost-effective to build a community center rather than retrofit an older building to make it earthquake- safe, but wanted to hold on to the ownership of the former printery. The 2003 San Simeon Earthquake heavily damaged the building, preventing its use by the public; it was deemed in 2017 to require $9 million in restoration. Nonprofit foundation ownership A nonprofit foundation was started in 2015 to save the building from disrepair and to gain possession of it from an LLC of local citizen Kelly Gearhart, recently convicted of fraud. Gearhart had plans to turn the building into an events center that would be used by the public at least four times a year to comply with the Masons' agreement with the city government. These plans were delayed by the legal issues Gearhart was involved in, yet prevented the city from entering the premises with Gearhart's assets being taken into bankruptcy. The building was scheduled for public auction in May 2016 with a $1 million lien and $400,000 in back taxes. In 2017, it was revealed that the purchase would require $283,000 from the newly formed nonprofit, the Atascadero Printery Foundation, and that they had raised around $40,000. The foundation then began direct negotiations with the United States Attorney's Office to see if a deal could be made to release the lien. In 2017, the property ended up in an online public auction along with the other Gearhart properties. The Atascadero Printery Foundation won the bid at just over $300,000, with $60,000 coming from donations and the remaining monies from an anonymous donor as a loan. The group plans to remodel the grounds for a \\"multipurpose, community facility\\" including a community theater, after-school arts programs, senior citizens' club, museum, and more. As of 2018, the foundation was seeking $8 million to complete restorations and remodels for the building to fulfill the vision of becoming a community center, and had planned many fundraising events to work toward this goal. Historic status The building was nominated in 2000 and secured historic status on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

The bell tower near the Peperbus. The Peperbus (Afrikaans for \\"pepper pot\\") is an unusual, hexagonal building on Meyburgh Street, Fraserburg, in the Karoo of South Africa. Along with the Old Parsonage Museum and the Afrikaner Protestant church, earlier an Anglican church designed by Sophy Gray, the Peperbus is one of three national heritage sites the province maintains in the town. A Baster, Adam Jacobs, built the Peperbus in 1861 according to plans drawn up by the Rev. Carl Arnoldus Bamberger, first pastor of the Fraserburg Reformed Church. D.A. Scholtz described it as a shack resembling an 18th-century Baroque pavilion with its curved lines and geometric design. A line drawing holds the building as 10 m from foundation to ceiling, but the building itself is around 8 m. It was originally intended to be the market house, whose bell would open the market. The local market gradually declined in importance, but the Peperbus went on to serve as the town's first library and an office or study for the magistrate, the town clerk, and the curate. It became a municipal election site and provided a place for the AACV to store their hospital furniture. Around 1951, it was the school board office. In the 1960s, the city council established a committee to promote it as a museum, but it would be empty for many years, and in April 2016, long-needed restoration work began.  Description by D.A. Kotz√© (1951)  At the centennial celebration of the Fraserburg Reformed Church in 1951, D.A. Kotz√© said of the Peperbus: > A description of Fraserburg will...not achieve its purpose without an > account of its most typical feature, namely the Peperbus. No more complete > is Pisa without its Leaning Tower, Egypt without its Sphinx, or Babel > without its Tower, than Fraserburg without its Peperbus.\\" To the passing > outsider, the structure seems to be of little note, but the attentive > visitor with an eye for the unusual can find much of interest that later > draws them in. The Peperbus is a hexagonal stone building, around 28 feet > high. It stands in the middle of town in the marketplace on a widened stone > foundation. Opposite the door lies a sliding window. Just above the big door > is the strikingly large cockpit window 2.5 m in diameter with its six > equally large glass panes. The hexagonal walls gradually taper in turn to a > hexagonal dome and a hexagonal tower. The tower features a long, small > window of about 3.5 by 1.5 ft on each side. It is arched at the top. A > weather vane lies at the top. The foundation, walls, dome, tower, and black- > and-white weathercock make a beautiful contrast to the blue background of > the Karoo sky. In earlier times, there was a large bell in the tower. The > beam it hung on can still be seen today. The bell now hangs between two > pillars next to the Peperbus. The Peperbus was designed by the Rev. > Bamberger (Fraserburg's first NGK pastor . The Peperbus bell served as an > evening bell at 9:00, marking the curfew after which Cape Coloreds were no > longer allowed on the streets. When the constables ceased to enforce this > law, the bell was hung by the building's side. Though the legislation had > become a dead letter, the bell continues to ring at the same time each > night. If it stops being run, something seriously wrong will have arisen > with regards to our respect for our heritage. Some years ago, there was some > talk of demolishing the Peperbus because it was too difficult to repair. > After fierce blowback from the community, the City Council agreed to leave > the Peperbus alone but to provide electric night lighting to dissuade > vandalism.

Acquired by UPS in 1995, SonicAir was eventually absorbed into the UPS Logistics Group. Sonic Air Courier Inc. was originally founded by Ray Thurston in 1976 to provide same-day and off- hour shipment of time-critical parcels. The company name would later combine into one word, SonicAir. Thurston's beginnings in the transportation industry go back to the age of thirteen when he worked as a bicycle messenger after school and summers for his father's messenger service. One year after finishing college, Ray's father died, and he assumed control of the business at twenty-three. After several failed attempts to purchase the business from his stepmother, Ray went on to form a new company, SonicAir Couriers, a same- day courier servicing the entire United States. Ray evolved SonicAir by adding warehousing, distribution, supply chain software and consulting to their services. SonicAir ad element from the early 1990s. Sonic Air Courier Inc., acquired Air Couriers International Inc. (ACI) in May 1984. SonicAir at the time was a 7 million dollar company acquiring a 19 million dollar company there were many challenges ahead and some difficult times. On time performance was only at 85%, and the company had experienced significant financial losses. SonicAir committed itself to the principles of quality improvement and management to turn the company around. The turnaround was so successful that SonicAir was named a \\"Great Comeback\\" by Success magazine in August 1990 and \\"Turnaround of the Year\\" in 1990 by Venture Capital Magazine. SonicAir developed the Field Support Bank in 1984 as the company strategically located warehousing to complement its existing same-day service. The company continued to add services as the needs of its customers dictated. SonicAir's Field Support Bank business continued to grow with great success for the next ten years attracting the attention of both the United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express (FedEx). In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir. It was initially operated as an independently run UPS Logistics Group Company providing worldwide service parts logistics planning, transportation, central parts distribution, returns management, reverse logistics, SmartCourier Field Repair, depot repair and warehousing for after-sale, time-critical product support. In 1997 SonicAir would begin to be branded as a wholly owned subsidiary of UPS. Growth as part of a UPS subsidiary was rapid, and in February 1999 SonicAir announced that it would be tripling the size of its Louisville operation. On September 5, 2000, SonicAir became the UPS Logistics Group and many of the initial services it offered would become eventually become UPS Express Critical.

History The house was built during the time of the Wisconsin Territory, prior to 1848. For the first several years of its existence, it belonged to Qu√©b√©cois immigrants. It originally belonged to Jean Baptiste Caron. Later, it was bought by Guillaume St. Germain. He and his wife, who has been named as either Madeline or Magdelaine, moved into it. In 1890, Nina Dousman McBride bought the house. She rented it out to Charles Gremore. Gremore later bought the house and moved it to its present location, on an island in the Mississippi River in the late 19th or early 20th century. In 1902, George Coorough purchased it. An addition was added in 1916. The house remained in the Coorough family until 1978, when it was acquired by the City of Prairie du Chien. It was added to the State Register of Historic Places in 2017 and to the National Register of Historic Places the following year.

The freeway runs between a junction with NC 11 south of Ayden to an interchange between U.S. Highway 264 (US 264), US 13, NC 11, and NC 903 north of Greenville, wrapping around the west side of Ayden and Winterville and the northwest side of Greenville. The southern of the route is known as the Greenville Southwest Bypass, a freeway planned to alleviate traffic on the NC 11 and Stantonsburg Road corridors. The remaining segment of the route is concurrent with US 264\\\\. The Greenville Southwest Bypass was proposed due to the recent increased population growth of Greenville, which has led to congestion along the NC 11 corridor. Additionally, the bypass was also planned to help aid growth and development within the area. As such, the Southwest Bypass Land Use Plan was adopted by the Pitt County Board of Commissioners on October 15, 2018, in order to guide the design and scale of future development along the corridor. Route description The route begins as the Greenville Southwest Bypass at a partial interchange with NC 11 south of Ayden. The four-lane rural freeway wraps around the west side of Ayden, continuing north to an interchange with NC 102\\\\. The route continues northward through rural areas of Pitt County, including the Renston Rural Historic District, bypassing Winterville to the west and coming to two closely spaced diamond interchanges with Forlines Road and US 13/US 264 Alternate (Dickinson Avenue). West of Greenville, the Greenville Southwest Bypass ends at a cloverleaf interchange with US 264 and Stantonsburg Road, with the NC 11 Bypass freeway continuing north concurrent with US 264\\\\. Wrapping around the city of Greenville to the northwest, the route intersects NC 43 and NC 33 before terminating at a folded diamond interchange with US 13/NC 11/NC 903, from which US 264 continues to the east as a four-lane limited-access expressway. History In December 2007, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) completed a final environmental impact statement and also identified the preferred alternatives for the project. Due to the bypass's proposed routing passing through the Renston Rural Historic District, the design was modified in 2007 in order to lessen the freeway's impact on the district. The design changes included removing a proposed interchange at NC 903 and shifting the alignment of the bypass eastward. In August 2008, NCDOT released a record of decision for the project, detailing the chosen alternative. The acquisition of the right-of-way was completed in January 2015. Construction on the project began in September 2016, and the project was expected to be completed in June 2020. In May 2015, NCDOT awarded a $159 million contract to Barnhill Contracting, Sanford Contractors and HDR Design Group to design and construct the project, which was built via the design- build method. Initially, the project, which meets Interstate Highway standards, was expected to cost a total of $231.8 million, including $159 million for construction, and be completed by June 2020. However, the project was ahead of schedule and was expected to cost less than the original estimates and be completed by November 2019. The Greenville Southwest Bypass opened to traffic on November 22, 2019.

It carried out its duties by maintaining correspondence with colonial governors, conducting inquiries, hearing complaints and interviewing merchants and colonial agents. The information so obtained was used to advise King and Parliament. The new board did not exercise executive authority and had no significant powers of appointment.

Club career A graduate of IBTE, Asyraf has been with the national youth team setup since 2013 when he was sent to Myanmar for the 2013 AFF U-16 Youth Championship at the age of 13. His first league experience was the 2016 Brunei Premier League with Tabuan U17, finishing third in the league. He also had a hand in Tabuan U17's path to the FA Cup semifinals of that season with the winner against Jerudong FC in the previous round. In the next year, Asyraf's age group was pushed up to the 2017‚Äì18 Brunei Super League as Tabuan Muda 'A' and he managed to score nine goals against the likes of MS PDB and Kota Ranger FC. However the Young Wasps finished sixth at the league's conclusion, and Asyraf's age group was disbanded in the following season. Asyraf moved to Kota Ranger in the 2018-19 season, and this was the season when he finally emerged as one of the brightest talents in Brunei. He scored 10 goals for the season including a hattrick against IKLS FC on 16 November. In mid-season, he was invited to a trial at UiTM F.C. along with Azwan Ali Rahman. He then scored the winner in the final of the season's FA Cup to deliver Kota Ranger's maiden FA Cup triumph. In the final match of the regular season against champions MS ABDB, after an abandoned game in which he scored, he was crowned the Best Player of the league. International career Asyraf is one of the few players who have progressed to full international level since Stephen Ng's first foray into developing Brunei's young footballers in 2013. His contemporaries include Amin Sisa and Nazirrudin Ismail. Taking over from Ali Ismail, Ng won his first game against Guam 4-1 at the 2014 AFC U-16 Championship qualification round held in Laos. Although Nazirrudin scored in that game, Asyraf was left on the bench. Two years later at the July 2015 AFF U-16 Youth Championship, Asyraf played all five games at the group stage of the competition. The Young Wasps managed a draw against Timor-Leste, but lost the next four. Two months later, he was immediately promoted to the Brunei national under-19 football team along with several other under-16 teammates for the 2016 AFC U-19 Championship qualification matches in Myanmar. The age gap was proved to be too much as Brunei let in 18 goals in four games without reply. Asyraf was called up for the Under-19s for a double header in 2017, namely the 2017 AFF U-18 Youth Championship and also the 2018 AFC U-19 Championship qualification in Myanmar and South Korea respectively. He played in all four group games at the AFF tournament, scoring against the Philippines (3-2) and Vietnam (1-8). The Young Wasps finished fourth in the table with three points. A month later in Paju, Brunei lost the first three games in the AFC tournament, but managed to salvage a 2-2 draw against Timor-Leste via goals from Abdul Hariz Herman and Hanif Aiman Adanan. In 2018, Asyraf was selected to represent Brunei Under-21 for the 2018 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy held in his home country in April. Coach Mario Rivera preferred to place Hanif Aiman Adanan on the right and Faiq Bolkiah as a lone striker, restricting Asyraf to only a single 45-minute appearance against Myanmar in the final group game. Brunei lost the crucial game 0‚Äì1 and failed to progress to the knockout phase. Asyraf received his first Under-23 callup in March 2019 for the 2020 AFC U-23 Championship qualification matches held in Vietnam. He did not play a part in the first game against the hosts where Brunei were drubbed 6-0. He was given a start by Stephen Ng in the next game against Thailand in which Thai rising star Suphanat Mueanta also featured, resulting in a 0-8 demolition. Things had gotten better for Asyraf in the final game against Indonesia when he was tasked to take a second-half penalty five minutes from time after a foul on Azreen Sa'oda by Muhammad Riyandi. Asyraf had his penalty saved and slotted the rebound wide, but Riyandi was judged to step out too early resulting in his dismissal. Azim Izamuddin Suhaimi scored the retake to put Brunei back in the game at 2-1. Brunei would subsequently lose in dramatic fashion as Nazirrudin Ismail's stoppage time penalty was saved by the opposition striker Dimas Drajad to keep the three points to Indonesia. After an outstanding 2018-19 campaign for Kota Ranger, Asyraf was selected for the full national team by Robbie Servais for the two-legged 2022 World Cup qualification matches against Mongolia in June 2019. Asyraf started both games opposite of Nazirrudin at the right side of a 4-3-3 formation. Brunei lost 2-3 on aggregate in the end, eliminating the Wasps from the 2022 World Cup and the 2023 Asian Cup.

Career =Early career= Rafael Grampola was still an u-20 player with Rio Preto when he played his first competitive games in the 2008 Copa Paulista. After scoring ten goals in the competition, he was promoted to the senior team to play in the second division of the 2009 Campeonato Paulista. After a successful campaign, scoring seven goals, he was signed by Ipatinga for R$250,000. At Ipatinga he made his national league debut as a substitute in the 2009 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B game against Fortaleza. This was his one and only appearance in the competition, and in 2010 he signed initially for Atl√©tico Sorocaba to play the second division of 2010 Campeonato Paulista and then for Caxias do Sul who were to play in 2010 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie C. He was unable to break into the team at Caxias do Sul, and joined Sergipe at the end of the season. Here he quickly became an idol of the club, as top scorer of the 2011 Campeonato Sergipano and being voted best forward in the competition. =Bahia= Good performances for Sergipe came to the attention of Bahia who signed Rafael Grampola on a deal until the end of 2012. He initially went into the under-23 squad to play in 2011 Copa Governador do Estado da Bahia, where he scored two goals against Feirense. He did not repeat this success, and was loaned to Monte Azul in December 2011 to again play in the second division of Campeonato Paulista. He returned to Bahia with an injury, and with Sergipe still owning 20% of the player's rights, an internet campaign was started by fans of the club to secure his return. Instead, he was transferred to An√°polis, and subsequently loaned out to clubs competing in the lower divisions of Campeonato Goiano. =Mexico and Gama= In December 2013, Rafael Grampola signed for Mexican Ascenso MX side Zacatepec, where he didn't have agood experiece, getting injured and struggling to get back in the team. After eight months he returned to Brazil with Gama. At the start of his career with Gama he was not popular, being booed by fans during the semi-final of the 2015 Campeonato Brasiliense, however he scored two goals in the final which secured the tournament victory In 2016, although the club did not win any title, Rafael Grampola still had a good season, being top scorer in both Campeonato Brasiliense and 2016 Copa Verde. =Bragantino= In June 2016, Rafael Grampola signed for Bragantino, to play in 2016 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B. He scored seven goals in the tournament, but it was not enough to save the team from relegation. Towards the end of the season there was interest in him from Paysandu, but he stayed at Bragantino for the 2017 second division Campeonato Paulista season, scoring eight goals to help the club return to the top division as runners-up. =Joinville= In May 2017, Rafael Grampola transferred to Joinville to play in 2017 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie C. He scored 13 goals in 15 games, including four in the 8‚Äì1 win over Mogi Mirim, and finished as top scorer in the competition. He followed this with seven goals, including two hat-tricks, in the 2017 Copa Santa Catarina. His total of 20 goals in 19 games made him the top scorer in Santa Catarina state football in 2017. In the 2018 Campeonato Catarinense he was joint top scorer with nine goals, and was chosen as joint best forward in the end of championship awards. However he could not prevent Joinville from suffering relegation from 2018 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie C in the second half of the year. S√©rie A with Paran√° With relegation confirmed and the season over, Joinville extended Rafael Grampola's contract, and a loan move was agreed to transfer him to Paran√° for the remainder of the 2018 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A season. He made his top-flight debut on 5 August 2018 against Cear√°, a game that ended in a 1‚Äì0 defeat..

In the film series, he was portrayed as the vengeful ghost of an African-American man who was brutally murdered for a forbidden interracial love affair in the 19th century and would haunt and kill anyone who called the name of the Candyman before a mirror five times in a row. The character is portrayed in Candyman (1992), Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995) and Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999) by Tony Todd, who is set to reprise the role in the upcoming Candyman (2021), a direct sequel to the original 1992 film. Appearances =Literature= Before the film adaptions, the character of the Candyman originated from the short story, \\"The Forbidden\\" from the anthology collection, Books of Blood by Clive Barker. According to the story, the description of the Candyman's appearance was: :He was bright to the point of gaudiness: His flesh was a waxy yellow. His thin lips are pale blue. His wild eyes are glittering as if their irises are set with rubies. His jacket was a patchwork and his trousers are the same. He looked, [Helen] thought, almost ridiculous with his bloodstained motley and the hint of rouge on his jaundiced cheeks. The literary version's face was described as \\"lurid\\" and \\"jaundiced\\" while his scent was like candy-floss. The iconic hook and bees are introduced in the short story as well as the other characters such as Helen, but the Candyman's race, name, place of origin or backstory are never brought up and was introduced with the film series. The element of summoning him by saying 'Candyman' in front of a mirror was also absent. The mere doubt of his existence was enough to draw him forth. =Films= The Candyman's first appearance in film was in Candyman (1992) which the female protagonist named Helen Lyle was investigating an urban legend that was revolving around an enigmatic figure that was known only as the Candyman which seemed to be connected to a series of grisly murders in the vicinity of Cabrini‚ÄìGreen, Chicago where at least 26 victims are ripped open \\"from the groin to the gullet\\" by an unknown perpetrator who left no trace behind, but the body. The denizens of the city block all seemed convinced that the \\"Candyman\\" was behind it which was a specter who could supposedly be summoned by repeating his name five times in front of a mirror and was reported to have a large metal hook in place of one hand. Helen was left in doubt about this after encountering a living gangster who adopted the alias of the Candyman to intimidate others. He assaulted Helen who concluded that the stories that she heard are nothing more than fairytales after this. This vocal denial of the Candyman finally brought the actual ghost of the Candyman out. He revealed himself to Helen by claiming that since she doubted his existence, he must shed the innocent blood to keep the myth of himself alive. He slaughtered the dog of and kidnapped the baby boy of a resident named Anne- Marie McCoy as well as brutally murdering Helen's friend and colleague named Bernadette by framing Helen for those acts. The Candyman boasted about how everyone that she loved including her husband named Trevor would abandon her and surrendering herself to him and becoming part of his urban legend would be her only option now. Helen was institutionalized, but the Candyman slaughtered her psychiatrist and allowed her to leave the facility. Helen who returned to Cabrini‚ÄìGreen discovered that she may be the reincarnation of the former Candyman's lover by explaining why he would target her in particular. She eventually discovered the missing baby in a bonfire, but the residents who saw the Candyman in it came out in a mob to burn the murderer. Caught in the fire, Helen managed to save the baby for Anne-Marie, but at the cost of her own life. Trevor who was attempting to \\"summon\\" Helen by repeating her name five times in front of a mirror unexpectedly succeeded and was brutally butchered by her by revealing that she became part of the Candyman's deadly legend. The Candyman appeared again in the sequel, Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995) three years after Helen's death where he slaughtered Professor Philip Purcell who appeared in the first film and the novel and was supposedly a leading authority on the urban legend of the Candyman. He was unconvinced that the legend had any supernatural element to it and he tried to prove it wrong by saying Candyman five times in the mirror of his own glossy book. This led to his gruesome death by the Candyman shortly after. Ethan Tarrant who was a descendant of the Candyman himself was made a suspect of this crime due to carelessly having made apparent threats against the professor publicly just before his murder while also having no alibi. Development =Concept and creation= The backstory of the Candyman being the son of a slave and a painter who became the lover of a wealthy landowner's daughter was not present in The Forbidden or the name of Daniel Robitaille. As soon as Tony Todd and his co-star, Virginia Madsen were cast as Candyman and Helen respectively, Bernard Rose, the director of Candyman (1992) gave them free hands to flesh out their character's backstories themselves as part of the creative process. Rose explains that \\"the Candyman is not black in Clive's story. In fact, the whole back story of the interracial love affair that went wrong is not in the book. Everything that's in the book is in the film, but it's been amplified.\\" Todd came up with the character's backstory during rehearsals with Madsen. The name Todd designated for the character was \\"Granville T. Candyman\\" who had a forbidden and interracial love affair with a white woman he was painting a portrait of, leading to his fatal lynching by an angry mob. The name of Granville was never used in the first film, leaving the character still nameless. The name that was ultimately designated for him in the sequel would be Daniel Robitaille. This backstory was supposedly set in Chicago. The element of New Orleans was added with the Farewell to the Flesh. =Characterization= The Candyman is largely driven by a need to sustain his legacy, killing those who doubted his existence in order to ensure that the rumor of him is kept alive. He has been described as a \\"ghoul fueled by the ‚Äúfaith‚Äù of his believers.\\" He is forced to deal with his followers to make them believe again and punish the interloper who led them astray.\\" In Draculas, Vampires and Other Undead Forms: Essays on Gender, Race and Culture, the Candyman's nature is likened to a vampire, elaborating that similar to the vampires: \\"[Candyman] possesses the capacity to hypnotize his prey such that they appear to desire their victimizations\\" Tony Todd compares his ability to invoke fear, suggestion and seduction to the DC Comics villain, Scarecrow. He also compares his character to the Phantom of the Opera and the Hunchback of Notre Dame in that they are all \\"monsters\\" who use both tenderness and terror to win the (Unanswered) love of the female protagonists. Virginia Madsen confirmed that the Candyman was intended by to be an \\"African American Dracula\\", adding that she thought that it's \\"appealing to the African American community because they finally had their own Dracula\\". He has been compared specifically to Gary Oldman's Dracula from Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), being \\"not only dark, but tall and handsome; a (Literally) tortured artist and a hopeless romantic, very much in the mould of Gary Oldman's Dracula\\". Bernard Rose also claimed that the biblical story of Samson was an inspiration for the Candyman's story, elaborating that \\"Samson dismayed his parents by taking a Philistine wife, pausing only to slay the young lion whose carcass bred bees and ran with honey. The Candyman outraged bigots by his love for a white woman and was murdered by being smeared with honey and staked out for the killer bees.\\" In Day of the Dead, it is established that the lynch mob chanted his soubriquet of Candyman five times before he died, explaining why he would appear at that count. The element of summoning the specter by chanting his name repeatedly in front of a mirror can be traced back to the urban legend of Bloody Mary. In the short story, the character describes his state of existence as an urban legend, saying \\"I am rumor. It's a blessed condition, believe me. To live in people's dreams; to be whispered at street-corners; but not have to be\\" while the film version says \\"I am the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom. Without these things, I am nothing\\". Legacy Candyman was 9th on both Fandango and Bloody Disgusting's list of top 10 slasher icons and 8th on an older Bloody Disgusting list. Based on poll-based reader input, Rolling Stone listed him as tenth among the horror villains. Joblo.com has Candyman as fifth on their list of horror boogeymen while ComingSoon.net has him as seventh on their list of slasher villains. =In popular culture= McFarlane Toys released an action figure of the Candyman in the Movie Maniacs Series 4 in 2001. Further action figures are set to be released in November 2019 by NECA.

It sells ingredients derived from insects for animal nutrition and in particular aquaculture. Through to the production of a new source of quality, natural and competitive protein, InnovaFeed aims to participate in the development of sustainable aquaculture. According to the SOFIA report, it is expected that by 2030, production from capture fisheries and aquaculture will increase to 201 million tons/year, an 18-percent increase from the current level of production of 171 million tones/year. This sector requires an increasing supply of proteins and lipids adapted to the nutritional needs of fish. InnovaFeed has the objective of setting up local production systems. This is made possible by the exclusive use of agricultural by-products to feed its insects, generating no additional impact on natural resources consumption. In addition, insect droppings are valued as organic fertilizers.  History  = Creation = InnovaFeed was created in 2016 by 4 engineers, Cl√©ment Ray, Guillaume Gras, Aude Guo and Bastien Oggeri, whose objective was to find alternatives feedstocks. Today, Cl√©ment Ray, Bastien Oggeri and Aude Guo are running the company. = Industrial deployment = In June 2016, InnovaFeed joined a scientific hub called √âvry's Genopole, which enabled it to pursue several research and development projects and to develop its technology. Since October 2017, it has been operating a pilot production unit located near Gouzeaucourt (France 59) in the Cambr√©sis region to validate its industrial scale processes and to start commercializing its products. On 27 September 2018, InnovaFeed publicly announced the construction of a new production site in Nesle with a capacity of 10,000 tons of insect protein per year. This future production unit will be implemented next to the Tereos Group's starch manufacture in order to allow industrial synergies between the two sites: by-product upcycling, energy and logistical savings. On Monday, May 21, 2019 was laid the foundation stone of the site of Nesle. InnovaFeed announced that by 2022, five new plants will be deployed on the same model as the Nesle site. = Funding = InnovaFeed first funding round in mid-February 2018 enabled it to secure ‚Ç¨15 million from a group of investors led by AlterEquity, a fund that invests in companies whose activities address a major social or environmental challenge. In November 2018, InnovaFeed announced that it had completed a second round of funding, securing an additional ‚Ç¨40 million. The transaction involved a group of European and Asian investors led by Creadev. This investment will enable to strengthen the team as well as support and accelerate InnovaFeed's industrial development on several new production sites. = Business development = In 2017, InnovaFeed entered in a partnership with the French retailer Auchan to collaborate on the development of new value chains to deliver insect-fed fish. Auchan first approached the trout industry, an emblematic species of French Aquaculture. In June 2018, the first insect-fed trout were commercialized in Auchan Retail France stores as part of a trial. On July 3, 2018, a tasting of the first trout fed with an insect protein-based feed was organized in partnership with Auchan Retail France . Thetwo Michelin star chef Remy Giraud from the Domaine of Hauts de Loire who prepared the trout said ‚ÄúThe insect-fed trout has better conservation, a meat that is more durable. And for the taste, the insect-fed one is much superior and has an excellent texture in the mouth.‚Äù Since November 2018, the ‚Äúinsect-fed‚Äù trout have been available continuously in 52 Auchan stores in the Ile-de-France and Nord Littoral regions with the plan to expand the scope of the project to the rest of France by the end of 2019. This approach was the result of the collaboration between InnovaFeed, fish feed manufacturers and fish farmers referenced by Auchan Retail France.  Technology  = Black Soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) = The insect used in the InnovaFeed process is the larvae of the Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens). This insect species has been approved by the European Commission for animal feed breeding because it does not transmit pathogen for humans and is non-aggressive.  Breeding techniques  The by-products used to feed the insects do not generate the consumption of additional natural resources and do not compete with human food. Insect droppings are used as a natural fertilizer for local organic agriculture.  Industrial processes and quality  InnovaFeed is approved by local authorities for the processing of Category 3 (L) animal by-products in accordance with art. 24.1.a of document CE 1069/2009 (FR 59 269 001).

These services are generally celebrated according to set forms contained in the various local editions of the Book of Common Prayer. The Daily Offices may be led either by clergy or lay people. In many Anglican provinces, clergy are required to pray the two main services daily.  History  One of the first pages of the psalter in a service book used for the canonical hours before the Reformation, showing the beginning of Matins on Sunday. Shown is the direction to sing Venite and Psalms 1 and 2. The Anglican practice of saying daily morning and evening prayer derives from the pre- Reformation canonical hours, of which eight were required to be said in churches and by clergy daily: Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. This practice derived from the earliest centuries of Christianity, and ultimately from the pre-Christian hours of prayer observed in the Jewish temple. The first Book of Common Prayer (1549), which first presented the modern Anglican Daily Office services in essentially the same form as present. The first Book of Common Prayer of 1549 radically simplified this arrangement, combining the first three services of the day into a single service called Mattins and the latter two into a single service called Evensong (which, before the Reformation, was the English name for Vespers). The rest were abolished. The second edition of the Book of Common Prayer (1552) renamed these services to Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, respectively, and also made some minor alterations, setting the pattern of daily Anglican worship which has been essentially unchanged in most cathedrals and other large churches ever since, continuing to the current edition of the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer of 1662. In most Anglican provinces, ordained ministers are required to say Morning and Evening Prayer daily; devout lay Anglicans also often make this a part of their spiritual practice. Historically, Anglican religious communities have made the Daily Office a central part of their communal spiritual life, beginning with the community at Little Gidding established in the 17th century by Nicholas Ferrar. Regular use of Morning and Evening Prayer from the Book of Common Prayer was also a part of the \\"method\\" promoted by John Wesley and the early Methodist movement. Since the Oxford (Tractarian) and ritualist movements of the 19th century, interest in the pre-Reformation practice of praying the office eight times a day has revived. Before his conversion to Roman Catholicism, the Tractarian priest John Henry Newman wrote in Tracts for the Times number 75 of the Roman Breviary's relation to the Church of England's daily prayer practices, encouraging its adoption by Anglican priests. The praying of \\"little hours\\", especially Compline but also a mid-day prayer office sometimes called Diurnum, in addition to the major services of Morning and Evening Prayer, has become particularly common, and is provided for by the current service books of the Episcopal Church in the United States and the Church of England. The Anglican forms of the Daily Office have spread to other Christian traditions: as mentioned, the Anglican Morning and Evening Prayer services were a central part of the original Methodist practice. The popularity of choral Evensong has led to its adoption by some other churches around the world. In addition, since the Roman Catholic Church established the Pastoral Provision and the Anglican Use in the United States, and continuing into the current personal ordinariates for former Anglicans who have joined the Roman Catholic church, forms of Morning and Evening Prayer based on the Anglican pattern have come into use among some Roman Catholics, contained in the Book of Divine Worship and its successor publications.  Liturgical practice  Traditional Anglican worship of the Daily Office follows the patterns first set down in 1549 and 1552. Since the 20th-century liturgical movement, however, some Anglican churches have introduced new forms which are not based on this historic practice. This section will describe the traditional form, which is still widely used throughout the Anglican Communion. The Book of Common Prayer has been described as \\"the Bible re-arranged for public worship\\": the core of the Anglican Daily Office services is almost entirely based on praying using the words of the Christian Bible itself, and hearing readings from it. = Confession and absolution = According to the traditional editions of the Book of Common Prayer since 1552, both Morning and Evening Prayer open with a lengthy prayer of confession and absolution, but many Anglican provinces including the Church of England and the American Episcopal Church now no longer require this even at services according to the traditional forms. = Opening responses = The traditional forms open with opening responses said between the officiating minister and the people, which are usually the same at every service throughout the year, taken from the pre-Reformation use: \\"O Lord, open thou our lips; and our mouth shall show forth thy praise\\", based on Psalm 51 and translated from the prayer which opens Matins in the Roman Breviary. Then follows \\"O God, make speed to save us\\" with the response \\"O Lord, make haste to help us\\", a loose translation of the Deus, in adjutorium meum intende which begins every service in the pre-Reformation hours, followed by the Gloria Patri in English. = Psalms and canticles = A major aspect of the Daily Office before the Reformation was the saying or singing of the Psalms, and this was maintained in the reformed offices of Morning and Evening Prayer. Whereas for hundreds of years the church recited the entire psalter on a weekly basis (see the article on Latin psalters), the traditional Book of Common Prayer foresees the whole psalter said over the longer time period of one month; more recently, some Anglican churches have adopted even longer cycles of seven weeks or two months. At Morning Prayer, the first psalm said every day is Venite, exultemus Domino, Psalm 95, either in its entirety or with a shortened or altered ending. During Easter, the Easter Anthems typically replace it; other recent prayer books, following the example of the Roman Catholic Liturgy of the Hours as revised following the Vatican II council, allow other psalms such as Psalm 100 to be used instead of the classical Venite. After the Venite or its equivalent is completed, the rest of the psalms follow, but in some churches an office hymn is sung first. After each of the lessons from the Bible, a canticle or hymn is sung. At Morning Prayer, these are usually the hymn Te Deum laudamus, which was sung at the end of Matins on feast days before the Reformation, and the canticle Benedictus from the Gospel of Luke, which was sung every day at Lauds. As alternatives, the Benedicite from the Greek version of the Book of Daniel is provided instead of Te Deum, and Psalm 100 (under the title of its Latin incipit Jubilate Deo) instead of Benedictus. The combination of Te Deum and Jubilate has proven particularly popular for church music composers, having been set twice by Handel, as well as by Herbert Howells and Henry Purcell. At Evening Prayer, two other canticles from the Gospel of Luke are usually used: Magnificat and Nunc dimittis, coming respectively from the services of Vespers and Compline. Psalms 98 and 67 are appointed as alternatives, but they are rarely used in comparison to the alternatives provided for Morning Prayer. = Bible readings = The introduction to the first Book of Common Prayer explained that the purpose of the reformed office was to restore what it described as the practice of the Early Church of reading the whole Bible through once per year, a practice it praised as 'godly and decent' and criticized what it perceived as the corruption of this practice by the mediaeval breviaries in which only a small portion of the scripture was read each year, wherein most books of the Bible were only read in their first few chapters, and the rest omitted. While scholars now dispute that this was the practice or intention of the Early Church in praying their hours of prayer, the reading of the Bible remains an important part of the Anglican daily prayer practice. Typically, at each of the services of morning and evening prayer, two readings are made: one from the Old Testament or from the Apocrypha, and one from the New Testament. These are taken from one of a number of lectionaries depending on the Anglican province and prayer book in question, providing a structured plan for reading the Bible through each year. = Preces and collects = Usually the Apostles' Creed is said congregationally following the readings and canticles, then Kyrie eleison. The Lord's Prayer is said or sung and then the precesIn modern use the term 'preces' is often used to refer to the opening responses, and 'responses' the part of the service after the creed, due to a misunderstanding of the name Preces and Responses, a common title for choral settings of both of these parts of the service. The historical usage of the term in liturgics, however, is to refer to the part of the service nearer the end. (also called suffrages) are said in a responsive pattern similar to that which opens the service. The versicles and responses follow an ancient pattern, including prayers for the civil authorities, for the ministers of the church and all its people, for peace, and for purity of heart. Then the minister prays several collects. The first is usually a collect of the day, appropriate to the church season. According to the Church of England's prayer books and those modelled on it, there then follow two collects: at Morning Prayer, they are taken from the pre-Reformation orders for Lauds and Prime, respectively; and at Evening Prayer from Vespers and Compline. = Anthem = The rubric of the Book of Common Prayer of 1662 then reads 'In Quires and Places where they sing here followeth the Anthem.' At choral services of Mattins and Evensong, the choir at this point sings a different piece of religious music, which is freely chosen by the minister and choir. This usage is based on the practice of singing a Marian antiphon after Compline, and was encouraged after the Reformation by the directions of Queen Elizabeth I's 1559 directions that 'for the comforting of such that delight in music, it may be permitted, that in the beginning, or in the end of common prayers, either at morning or evening, there may be sung an hymn, or suchlike song to the praise of Almighty God'. = Closing = In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, five additional prayers were added to close the service. These were, in order, for the monarch, for the royal household, for the clergy and people, a concluding prayer taken from the Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom, and a benediction based on 2 Corinthians 13:14 often referred to by Anglicans simply as 'the grace'. In modern practice, the anthem is usually followed by some prayers of intercession, or sometimes a sermon, before the congregation is dismissed Nonetheless the use of some of the five prayers, especially the grace and the Prayer of St Chrysostom, remains common.  Music  A choir rehearsing for choral Evensong in York Minster Since the services of Morning and Evening Prayer were introduced in the 16th century, their constituent parts have been set to music for choirs to sing. A rich musical tradition spanning these centuries has developed, with the canticles not only having been set by church music composers such as Herbert Howells and Charles Villiers Stanford, but also by well-known composers of classical music such as Henry Purcell, Felix Mendelssohn, Edward Elgar, and Arvo P√§rt. Evening Prayer sung by a choir (usually called 'choral Evensong') is particularly common. In such choral services, all of the service from the opening responses to the anthem, except the lessons from the Bible, is usually sung or chanted. Settings of the opening responses and the section from the Kyrie and Lord's Prayer up to the end of the collects are suitable for both Morning and Evening Prayer and are usually known by the title 'Preces and Responses'; settings of the canticles differ between the two services and, especially in the latter case, are usually called a \\"service\\" (i.e. 'Morning Service' and 'Evening Service'). Almost every Anglican composer of note has composed a setting of one or both components of the choral service at some point in their career. In addition, the freedom of choirs (and thus composers) to select music freely for the anthem after the collect has encouraged the composition of a large number of general religious choral works intended to be sung in this context. The sung Anglican Daily Office has also generated its own tradition in psalm-singing called Anglican chant, where a simple harmonized melody is used, adapting the number of syllables in the psalm text to fit a fixed number of notes, in a manner similar to a kind of harmonized plainsong. Similarly to settings of the responses and canticles, many Anglican composers have written melodies for Anglican chant. The psalms and canticles may also be sung as plainsong. This is especially common during Lent and at other penitential times.

The installation consisted of two sculptures, named We Come in Peace and Benaam, which means \\"nameless\\" in Urdu. We Come in Peace was a tall standing figure, while Benaam was a long figure lying prostrate. According to AM New York, the We Come in Peace sculpture was gender fluid.

The title of the installation makes reference to a 1951 film, The Day the Earth Stood Still.

He is venerated on July 1. Life Peter is known only from menologies. He was the son of the patrikios Constantine, who according to the Synaxarium Constantinopolitanum held the position of strategos. Peter was born during the joint reign of Irene of Athens and her son Constantine VI (780‚Äì796).. Peter also held the rank of patrikios, and served as commander of the elite Scholai regiment during the sole reign of Irene of Athens () and as commander of the Hikanatoi regiment under her successor, Nikephoros I (). He fought in the disastrous Battle of Pliska in 811, and was taken prisoner along with 50 other officers by the Bulgars. Peter managed to escape \\"miraculously\\" through the aid of John the Theologian, became a monk on the Bithynian Olympus, along with Joannicius the Great, with whom he lived together as his disciple for 34 years. After Joannicius' death in 846, Peter returned to Constantinople, where he built a church in the ta Evandrou quarter. He lived in a hut nearby and died eight years later, on 1 July 854. The veracity of his life after 811 has been questioned by John Wortley, who considers his monastic life a legend. Rodolphe Guilland suggested an identity with a patrikios of the same name, mentioned in the history of Theophanes the Confessor, who participated in the overthrow of Irene in 802, and who in 809 calmed an army mutiny against Nikephoros. However, this person is stated by Theophanes to have been killed at Pliska.

Written by SM Entertainment songwriter Kenzie and Sara Forsberg with production by Timothy 'Bos' Bullock and MZMC, \\"RBB (Really Bad Boy)\\" is primarily an \\"addictive\\" R&B; and dance-pop song with influence from jazz and hip hop, with the lyrics expressing the charm of a \\"bad boy\\".[6][7] It was released as the lead single from its eponymous extended play on November 30, 2018 by SM Entertainment and Iriver Inc as the distributor, along with an accompanying horror-themed music video. Upon its release, \\"RBB\\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics who deemed it \\"controversial\\" and \\"unfamiliar\\" to the public. The song however, gained compliments for its \\"unapologetic\\" boldness thanks to the group's experimental path. Domestically, it achieved moderate success in its native country, becoming their eleventh top-ten entry on Gaon Digital Chart, while being a bigger success outside of their native country, peaking at number one on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales.  Background and release  Three months after the release of their second summer special release Summer Magic, SM Entertainment confirmed that Red Velvet would return in November with a new extended play, titled \\"RBB\\" on November 30, 2018 and its eponymous lead single title. During a V Live broadcast, member Yeri stated that the preparation for the album was longer than their other releases, while member Seulgi noted that the song would be \\"very different\\". Following a music video teaser uploaded one day prior, the song's music video was released on November 30, 2018 to coincide with the parental extended play's digital release.  Composition  \\"RBB (Really Bad Boy)\\" was composed and produced by SM Entertainment songwriter Kenzie, producer Timothy 'Bos' Bullock, singer-songwriter Sara Forsberg (known professionally as SAARA) and MZMC. In an interview with Balloon Days, Bullock revealed that \\"RBB\\" was the last song to be composed during his 2-week writing camp at Seoul, South Korea, without knowing \\"who the songs were going to end up going to\\". The demo version was originally guided by Bullock himself and co-composer Forsberg, with additional Korean lyrics written by Kenzie after. Originally recorded in Korean, an additional English version was also recorded and included as the sixth track of the extended play, marking the group's second song to be recorded in English following their earlier release \\"Bad Boy\\". Described \\"RBB\\" as the sequel to their previous single \\"Bad Boy\\", \\"RBB (Really Bad Boy) is an \\"addictive\\" R&B; and dance-pop track with \\"funky beat and brassy horns\\", which draws influence from hip-hop and jazz music. It was their sixth single to follow the \\"Velvet\\" sonic concept. With a tempo of 150 beat-per-minute, \\"RBB\\" is a fast verse-chorus form song in the key of D major. According to producer Bullock, he \\"wanted to create something with lots of fun energy\\" which made the listeners \\"want to move\\", thus using 808's for the bass of the song. The main melody was played by a trumpet and a trombone, being one of the first songs produced by Bullock to use such elements. In addition, the bridge was said to take heavy influence on R&B; and jazz music, which \\"would be a good contrast and add dynamics to the song\\", said the producer. Lyrically, the song expresses the charm of a \\"bad boy\\" that attracts the girls' attention, no matter how all the other friends say. The group's vocals span from the low note B3 to the head voice note of D6 (D7 in exclamation, being the whistle/scream note by member Irene). Furthermore, the song is heavily ornamented with melisma and vocal harmonization, all of which appeared throughout the song - from the intro to the last head run by member Wendy.  Promotion and music video  To promote \\"RBB\\", a video teaser containing excerpts of the song was released on November 28, 2018, 2 days before the actual release date. A day after, Red Velvet held a special V Live broadcast in which they introduced the preview of all the songs before performing a small part of the choreography for \\"RBB\\". The group then performed the song live for the first time on the music program Music Bank, an hour before the official release time. It was then followed by performances on other music programs and year-end music awards, such as Show! Music Core, Inkigayo, and The Fact Music Awards. The music video for \\"RBB\\" was choreographed by Janelle Ginestra, Kaycee Rice and Choi Sun-hee, while being directed by director Oui Kim of GDW production team. whom had previously worked with labelmate NCT on several of their releases. The \\"whimsical, move-infused\\" video features a Halloween-theme consists of a werewolf as the main protagonist - \\"bad boy\\" of the video chasing and haunting the girls while they are looking to find out the werewolf as well. Choreography scenes are incorporated throughout the video between different retro-inspired and horror-theme sets, with one of them referring to the 1980 film The Shining as members Irene and Yeri reprised the Grady twins image. In several scenes, a Howliwood (a wordplay on the verb \\"howl\\" and the famous Hollywood billboard) sign can be seen up close in the background as well. Upon its release, the video received positive reacts from magazines and blogs such as Billboard, Idolator and Forbes. The \\"fun, creepy ascetic\\" video was regarded as a \\"B-movie schlock retrofitted to K-pop perfectionism\\", according to Forbes contributor Caitlin Kelley.  Critical reception  Following its release, \\"RBB (Really Bad Boy)\\" received generally mixed to positive reviews from international critics. Writer Mike Nied of Idolator described the song as \\"the banger\\" that boasts \\"a fiercely danceable production\\" with a \\"sing-along chorus\\", while Chase McMullen of The 405 chose the song as the \\"Track of the Day\\", praising it for upping \\"the ante on boisterous, feminist fun\\" from \\"Bad Boy\\", while still staying \\"in true Red Velvet fashion\\". In the same article for the video, Caitlin Kelley of Forbes remarked that \\"As a whole, \\"RBB\\" is like if cocktail music became anthemic pop and then soundtracked a horror movie. The harmonies are complex, and vocal ad libs fill every nook and cranny of empty space\\". Crystal Bell of MTV commented that while \\"RBB (Really Bad Boy)\\" is a song that really shouldn't work. It's a cacophony of sounds, rhythms, shrill ad-libs, complex harmonies, and a whole lot of brass\\" on the first listen, it was \\"unapologetically bold and loud\\" for a lead single that makes it \\"so unabashedly Red Velvet\\". She then concluded that with the group's \\"distinct vocal charms and tight harmonies, no two Red Velvet songs sound the same ‚Äî and while \\"RBB\\" may be a divisive entry in the group's discography, you can't say it isn't 100 percent them\\". Writer Lo of Seoulbeats described the song as a track \\"bursting with hook\\", while applauding its \\"lighter harmonies\\". The song also received mixed reviews, however. In an EP review of writer Kelley Burridge on United K-Pop, \\"RBB\\" was said to recall the group's previous hit \\"Dumb Dumb\\" with a \\"small let down of the chorus\\", though she later clarified that it wasn't \\"to say that the song is bad\\". In South Korea, writer Kim Sang-hwa of OhmyStar said the song received mixed reactions from the public but claimed that for those who follow the group and their music, this is normal for a Red Velvet release, that unpredictability is common for their title tracks and \\"RBB (Really Bad Boy)\\" is no exception. They added further that they're \\"controversial\\" because they're \\"unfamiliar\\", stating that they're welcome to those who are seeking something new.  Commercial performance  The song performed moderately at its home country. With only one day counted for charting, \\"RBB\\" debuted at number 26 on the Gaon Digital Chart for the 48th week chart issue before moving up to number 10 where it peaked the following week, thus giving the group their eleventh top-ten entry on the chart.

It stars Tom Moore, Dorothy Revier, and Norman Trevor, and was released on December 20, 1927. Plot When her car breaks down during a rainstorm, Glenna Marsh seeks refuge in a hunting lodge she stumbles upon. When the lodge's owner, Peter Dane, comes home to find her there, he understands her predicament and allows her to stay the night. Marsh is a socialite, who frequently throws parties, at which gambling can be found. She invites Dane to her next party, which is scheduled for a few days later. One of her frequent guests, with whom she also has a romantic dalliance, is Cole Norwood. Unbeknownst to Marsh, Norwood is a card sharp, who is using her social position to gain access to her wealthy friends, who he is fleecing. When the day of the party arrives, Dane attends, and there is an attraction between Marsh and him. During the course of the party, Marsh witnesses Norwood cheating by taking cards from the discard pile. Horrified, she exposes him and orders him from her house. As the party breaks up, Dane stays behind to comfort Marsh. Norwood returns and accuses Marsh of being his paramour and business partner. While the former is true the latter is not, and a fight ensues between Dane and Norwood. During the fight, a drape catches fire. Norwood knocks Dane temporarily senseless, and is about to kill him, when Marsh grabs a revolver and shoots Norwood. Dane revives and he and Marsh flee, unable to get to Norwood to pull him from the flames. However, Marsh's butler, Fleet, who was helping Norwood in his cheating scheme, does pull Norwood from the flames, but he is horribly burned. When he recovers, Norwood's face is so horribly disfigured that he is unrecognizable. He takes on the name of Felipe Vincenti, who poses as a newsman from South America. He gets Fleet to go to the police and say that Marsh killed Norwood, who has been presumed dead, in order to prevent Norwood to reveal to Dane that Norwood and Marsh were lovers. Then in his new persona, he leads the campaign to get Marsh convicted of his murder. She is eventually tried and convicted of the murder, and is sentenced to hang. However, as she waits on the gallows, she is saved when Dane forces Fleet to confess that he lied about the murder, and reveals the true identity of Vincenti. Cast * Tom Moore as Peter Dane *Dorothy Revier as Glenna Marsh *Norman Trevor as Cole Norwood/Felipe Vincenti *Jed Prouty as Geoffrey Fuller *Otto Hoffman as Fleet Production In late November 1927 it was announced that Tom Moore and Dorothy Revier would be appearing in the film. Priscilla Dean had originally been cast in the leading role, and the film had been advertised to theater chains with her in the part. Shortly later, in the first week of December, Byron Haskin's involvement in the picture as director was revealed, and production had begun on the film. It was Haskin's first directing assignment under his new contract with Columbia. In mid-December Norman Trevor was added to the cast in dual roles. The film was released on December 20, 1927. Reception Harrison's Reports gave the film a lukewarm review based on the film's content, which they found morbid. They did not like the fact that the final moment of the picture portrayed a woman on the gallows awaiting her death. They did find the early plot nicely done.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. The house is a relatively rare example of a rural Queen Anne made with patterned masonry, and is one of the few remnants of the former hamlet of Williams. History In 1870, what was then known as the Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad constructed a line through this area, passing through what was then the hamlet of Williams. The line was leased to the Michigan Central Railroad in 1871, and the easy access to transportation spurred a small agricultural and industrial boom in the area. The soil of the surrounding area was a sand and clay mixture, and by 1885 there was a brick- making factory located in Williams, which was soon joined by a mill and charcoal factory, as well as two other, independent brick-making businesses. One of the brick-makers was Patrick Shields, who arrived in Williams in 1890 and purchased a factory near the railroad, just north of where this house now stands. Shields had previously worked in a brickyard in nearby Kendall, Michigan, another hamlet along the railroad. Shields's brick-making business was a success, and in 1900 he constructed a large brick home for his family near the brickyard. The Shields had a large family, and also used space in the house as a gathering place for community event. However, 1900 was the high point for the community of Williams, which reached a population of 125 and began declining soon after. The other two brickyards had closed by 1901, and the Shields brickyard lasted only until about 1910. Patrick Shields died in 1913, but his family continued to live in the house until the late 1930s or early 1940s, when new owners moved in. Description The Patrick and Sarah Shields House is a large, three-story, red brick Queen Anne house, with a footprint defined by overlapping rectangles. The main section of the house contains three steeply-pitched roofs sections: a large, hipped central section with two lower gabled portions which intersect. A large wrap-around porch runs across the front of the house and encircles about half of the main floor; a second, smaller porch is in the rear. The brickwork is laid in stretcher courses through most of the house. At the top of doors and windows, bricks are laid in decorative patterns to form hoods. More decorative brickwork is located under the second story eaves. The house has six exterior doorways, some opening onto the porch. The first and second story windows are one-over- one wood sash and frame unit with stone sills. The third floor windows, located in the gable ends, have been replaced. The gable ends are clad with fishscale shingling.

It was built on the ruins of an ancient Castle called Bivai close to the Alps Dolomites located in northeastern Italy.  History  The ancient castle was called Bivai from the Italian word Bivio (the fork) due to its structure. Since 407 AD the castle of Bivai belonged to the Teuponi family, descendants of Teupo, captain of the Goths. The Teuponi were part of the Guelph fraction and considered to be excellent warriors like Pietro Teupone who took part in the First Crusade and Giorgio Teupone who was nominated captain by Ezzelino da Romano. They were also generous benefactors like the Knight Giovanni Teupone, last member of this family, who donated part of his wealth to the Church of S. Vittore and to the Cathedral of St. Peter located in Feltre. During the 17th century the Venetian Villa was built and in the 19th century Count Carlo Azzoni Avogadro, after being nominated Mayor of Santa Giustina, commissioned the last changes and alterations still present today.  Architecture  The symmetry of the 17th-century structure has been modified by adding a lower body during the 19th century. A small cottage borders the garden defining the margins of the property and it is connected to the main body through an arched portal which is used as one of the entrances to the Villa. The floor of Villa degli Azzoni Avogadro is made out of wood while in the recently restored apartments, the material is ceramic.  Today  Count Jacopo degli Azzoni Avogadro, descendant of the family, and owner of the Villa is re-launching the structure by turning the old barn into tourist apartments and a restaurant. He also planted five hectares of vines and in collaboration with the company Tesla, he installed connector chargers for electric cars respecting environmental sustainability. Villa degli Azzoni Avogadro recently hosted some art events like a concert by Italian singer Giorgio Conte, brother of Paolo Conte, and it has also been a movie set for the feature film Affitasi Vita directed by Italian director Stefano Usardi. In 2009 Count Jacopo degli Azzoni Avogadro bought Haubach Palast in Berlin originally designed by English architect Ernest George and turned its apartments into Haubach Residence.

He was particularly known for the opera librettos which wrote for the Italian composers Achille Peri, Carlo Pedrotti, and Antonio Cagnoni as well as his translations of French operas for their first performances in Italy, including Meyerbeer's L'Africaine. Biography Marcello was born in San Giovanni Lupatoto, a small town near Verona. He showed an early talent for music and poetry and at the age of 16 composed his first opera. His family sent him to Novara where he studied music and composition under Saverio Mercadante. He then followed Mercadante to Naples where he continued his studies in singing and composition and joined the circle of young writers around the writer and librettist Giovanni Emanuele Bidera. During that time, he composed two operas which were never performed. He also began working as a translator and librettist. He produced two librettos for operas by Carlo Pedrotti composed when Pedrotti was a student, Antigone and La sposa del villaggio. Neither of which was ever performed. However, Pedrotti's Lina, again with a libretto by Marcello, premiered in Verona in 1840 to a favourable reception by both the audience and the critics. In 1839, Marcello had also completed the libretto for Mercadante's opera Il bravo when the original librettist, Gaetano Rossi, fell ill. His activities in the next few years included writing the libretto for Luigi Petrali's opera Sofonisba which premiered at La Scala in 1844 and translating the libretto of Hal√©vy's opera La Juive into Italian, part of which was performed at the Teatro Regio di Parma in 1845. He left Naples during the 1848 uprisings and returned to Northern Italy. He spent some time in a villa on Lake Garda and then settled in Turin. He taught singing and piano there, and wrote music criticism for the journal Rivista contemporanea. In 1854 he also founded the journal, Il trovatore. In October 1859, after the French-Piedmontese troops had secured the city, Marcello moved to Milan where he spent the rest of his life. The 1850s and 60s saw the premieres of multiple operas with librettos by Marcello, including four more by Pedrotti, Achille Peri's Giuditta, and Filippo Marchetti's opera Romeo e Giulietta based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Unusually for Italian Romeo and Juliet operas, Marcello based the libretto's structure and narrative closely on Shakespeare's play rather than on the source narratives which had inspired the play. In 1865 Marcello's Italian translation of Meyerbeer's L'Africaine was heard throughout Italy and in London's Royal Opera House. In the early 1840s Marcello had become seriously ill and was told that he had hypertrophy of the heart from which he would not recover. A friend then introduced him to the Swiss physician Jacques Etienne Chevalley de Rivaz who had practices in Naples and the island of Ischia where he owned a spa at Casamicciola. Chevalley de Rivaz urged him to leave behind his ambitions and frenetic life in Naples and enter into his care at the spa. Marcello spent three months there and against all expectations recovered sufficiently to resume his career. After his recovery he wrote a poetic paean to Ischia entitled Ischia. Canti tre. Twenty years later he revised and published the poem with a lengthy dedication letter to Chevalley de Rivaz whom he credited with saving his life and being his \\"second father\\". The letter was dated 5 July 1863. Chevalley de Rivaz died in Ischia later that year. Marcello died in Milan in 1865 at the age of 47 after what his obituary described as a brief illness.

He is the current Editor-in- chief of the journal, Language Testing.  Career  Harding obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in Linguistics at the University of Melbourne in 2002. Later he got his Master of Arts degree in Applied Linguistics and a PhD degree in Applied Linguistics at the University of Melbourne in 2008. Since 2011 Harding has been a professor at the Department of Linguistics and English Language of Lancaster University, United Kingdom since 2010. On 19 April 2017, Harding along with Charles Alderson and Tineke Brunfaut were selected as the winner of the International Language Testing Association (ILTA) Best Article Award. The award-winning paper, Towards a Theory of Diagnosis in Second and Foreign Language Assessment: Insights from Professional Practice Across Diverse Fields, was published in 2015 in the journal Applied Linguistics. The study investigated how diagnosis is theorized and carried out across a diverse range of professions with a view to finding commonalities that can be applied to the context of second and foreign language assessment. On the basis of interviews with professionals from fields such as car mechanics, IT systems support, medicine, psychology and education, a set of principles was drawn up to facilitate inform a comprehensive theory of diagnostic assessment in a second or foreign language. On 9 October 2018, Harding was an invited speaker at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.. He delivered a speech entitled \\"English as a Lingua Franca and Language Assessment: Challenges and Opportunities\\". As of 2019, he is a co-editor of the journal Language Testing. Research In a journal article, published in 2012 in Language Testing, Harding investigated the potential for a shared-L1 advantage on an academic English listening test featuring speakers with L2 accents. Publications Harding has published in several major journals such as Applied Linguistics, Language Testing, Language Teaching, Assessing Writing, and Language Assessment Quarterly.

He showed promise as a juvenile in 2018 when he won one minor race and ran well in both the Autumn Stakes and the Vertem Futurity Trophy. In the following year he showed top class form over a mile, winning the Dee Stakes, St James's Palace Stakes and Prix du Moulin as well as finishing second in the Sussex Stakes. As a four-year-old he won the Queen Anne Stakes. Background Circus Maximus is a bay horse with a small white star bred in Ireland by Flaxman Stables, a breeding company run by the Niarchos family. During his racing career he has been jointly owned by Flaxman Stables and the Coolmore Stud. He was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became one of the world's leading stallions, earning his tenth champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland title in 2018. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found Minding and Ruler of the World. Circus Maximus's dam Duntle was a top-class performer who won five races including the Sandringham Handicap, Desmond Stakes, Amethyst Stakes and Duke of Cambridge Stakes. She was a female-line descendant of Lady Winborne, a half- sister to Allez France. Racing career =2018: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut Circus Maximus started the 5/1 favourite in a 23-runner field for a maiden race over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 26 August. Ridden by Ryan Moore he finished fifth, four and three quarter lengths behind the winner Breaking Story, after being hampered in the last quarter mile. On 22 September at Gowran Park the colt was partnered by his trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien in a maiden over one mile on heavy ground and recorded his first victory as he came home two lengths clear of the Ger Lyons trained Army Recruit despite hanging badly to the left in the closing stages. The colt was then sent to England and stepped up in class for the Group 3 Autumn Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 13 October and Donnacha O'Brien partnering the stable's best fancied contender Magna Grecia the ride on Circus Maximus went to Seamie Heffernan. After briefly taking the lead a furlong out he was outpaced in the closing stages and finished third behind Persian King and Magna Grecia. Two weeks later Circus Maximus was promoted to Group 1 level when he was one three O'Brien trainees to contest the Vertem Futurity Trophy over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Wayne Lordan he ran fourth behind Magna Grecia, Phoenix of Spain and Western Australia, beaten a length by the winner after hanging left in the closing stages. =2019: three-year- old season= Circus Maximus began his three-year-old season by starting the 5/4 favourite for the Dee Stakes (a trial race for the Epsom Derby) over ten and a half furlongs at Chester Racecourse on 9 May. Partnered by Moore he took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and despite hanging left yet again he kept on well to win by a length and a quarter from his stablemate Mohawk. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"Ryan said he was very happy at a mile-and-a-quarter but he wouldn‚Äôt mind stepping up if he needed it... this horse could be a Derby possible... He's lazy, but they're better being a little bit lazy than over-racing.\\" In the 2019 Epsom Derby over one and a half miles on 1 June the colt was partnered by Frankie Dettori and went off the 10/1 sixth choice in a thirteen-runner field. He stumbled at the start but recovered to settle in fourth place but was unable to quicken in the last quarter mile and was eased down by Dettori to come home sixth behind his stablemate Anthony Van Dyck. On 18 June Circus Maximus, equipped with blinkers for the first time, was dropped back in distance for the Group 1 St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot when he was ridden by Moore and started at 10/1. Too Darn Hot was made favourite, while the other nine runners included Phoenix of Spain, King of Comedy (Heron Stakes), Skardu (Craven Stakes), Shaman (Prix La Force) and Royal Marine. Racing in heavy rain, Circus Maximus broke quickly and settled in second place behind Fox Champion before taking the lead in the straight. He saw off the challenges of Phoenix of Spain and Too Darn Hot before denying a late charge from King of Comedy on the wide outside to win by a neck. After the race O'Brien explained that the colt had not originally been intended to run in the race and had only been entered when his owners paid a supplementary fee of ¬£45,000 fifteen minutes before the deadline earlier that week. He went on to say \\"It was a big challenge for the horse. We were worried that the pace was going to be completely different over a mile. We just put the blinkers on him just to sharpen him a little bit. He needed to be focused very quick and he didn't have a lot of time to learn about it\\". Circus Maximus was matched against older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 31 July. After tracking the front-running Phoenix of Spain he took the lead in the straight but was overtaken by Too Darn Hot and beaten half a length into second place. In the International Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse three weeks later, Circus Maximus set the pace before fading in the last quarter mile and coming home seventh behind his stablemate Japan. On 9 September the colt was sent to France and went off at odds of 4.1/1 for the Prix du Moulin over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Romanised headed the betting after winning the Prix Jacques Le Marois while the other eight runners included Olmedo (Poule d'Essai des Poulains), Line of Duty (Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf) and Phoenix of Spain. After racing in third place Circus Maximus moved up to dispute the lead 200 metres from the finish and got the better of a closely contested struggle with Romanised to win by a nose. Circus Maximus hung to the left in the closing stages and slightly impeded the runner-up but after an inquiry by the racecourse stewards the result was allowed to stand. Ryan Moore commented \\"He was the best horse on the day and was always holding off the second. He had a bit more left in the tank. He's obviously well suited to a mile. There were six group 1 winners in the field and you have to be very happy with what he's done.\\" An appeal by Romanised's connections failed to overturn the decision. For his final run of the year Circus Maximus was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Santa Anita Park on 1 November and started joint-favourite alongside the four- year-old filly Got Stormy. He recovered from a poor start and stayed on well in the straight but never looked likely to win and came home fourth behind Uni, Got Stormy and Without Parole. =2020: four-year-old season= The flat racing season in Britain and Ireland was restructured as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and Circus Maximus made his first appearance in the Queen Anne Stakes which was run behind closed doors at Royal Ascot on 16 June. With Moore in the saddle he went off the 4/1 favourite in a fifteen-runner field which also included Mustashry, Billesdon Brook, Accidental Agent, Terebellum (Prix de la Nonette), Mohaather (Greenham Stakes), Skardu (Craven Stakes), Plumatic (Prix du Muguet) and Duke of Hazzard (Celebration Mile). After tracking the 40/1 outsider Marie's Diamond, Circus Maximus took the lead approaching the final furlong before being overtaken by the filly Terebellum but rallied to regain the advantage in the final strides and won by a head. Aidan O'Brien, watching the race from his training base in Ireland commented \\"That's him exactly. He's like a fighter. If he doesn't get his blood up then he doesn't perform. He can be quite lazy so he needs the fast tempo of a mile. He loves getting eyeballed. He's a very good horse. He is very tough, he travels, quickens, and then toughs it out.\\" Pedigree  References  External links * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart ‚Äì Circus Maximus Category:2016 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 1-x ","title":"Circus Maximus (horse)"},{"id":"61089494","title":"Sudden Sky"},{"id":"61089495","text":"Julia Elizabeth (Poppy) Kennedy (23 December 1839 - 9 December 1916) was a British classical scholar. She was a supporter of women's suffrage and higher education for women. Life Julia, the daughter of Janet and Benjamin Hall Kennedy, was born in 1839 in Shrewsbury. She had four siblings: Charlotte Amy May Kennedy (1832‚Äí95), Marion Kennedy (1836‚Äí1914), Edith Janet Kennedy (1842‚Äí1922), and Arthur Herbert Kennedy (1846‚Äí85). The Kennedy family moved to Cambridge in 1867, when Benjamin took up the Regius Chair in Greek at the University of Cambridge. Julia was taught philology under Walter William Skeat, and was described by John E. B. Mayor in 1871 as \\"an intelligent member of his Latin class for ladies\\". In 1877 she passed the Cambridge Higher Local Examinations. In the 1880s she gave lectures on Anglo-Saxon at Girton College. In 1890 she was elected to membership of the Cambridge Philological Society. She was active in the women's suffrage movement. In 1908, Julia Kennedy and Rosamund Philpott were the first women to stand for election in the Cambridge Town Council elections. Kennedy's Revised Latin Primer Kennedy's Latin Grammar was first published as the Public School Latin Primer in 1866, based on an earlier Latinae Grammaticae Curriculum, or a Progressive Grammar of the Latin Language written by Benjamin Hall Kennedy.Stray, Christopher. \\"Primers, Publishing, and Politics: The Classical Textbooks of Benjamin Hall Kennedy.\\" The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, vol. 90, no. 4, 1996, pp. 451‚Äì474.

However, the revised version was not written by Benjamin Kennedy himself, but Julia and Marion Kennedy: Julia wrote the philological introduction, and her sister Marion had provided the examples. Letters from Julia to the publisher concerning issues related to copyright raised in 1914 demonstrate the extent of their involvement, and highlight Benjamin Kennedy's reluctance to produce a revised version: \\"My father was only prepared at first for a comparatively slight revision...it was not easy to make him see the extent and far reaching quality of the alterations which were called for, both by the rapid growth of comparative philology and by the newer methods of teaching.\\"Letter from Julia Kennedy to Longmans, 20 February 1915, excerpt in Stray, Christopher. \\"Primers, Publishing, and Politics: The Classical Textbooks of Benjamin Hall Kennedy.\\" The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, vol. 90, no. 4, 1996, pp. 451‚Äì474.

Kennedy's letters to the publishers of the Revised Latin Primer are part of the Longman Group archive held at the University of Reading. A radio musical about the role of Julia and Marion Kennedy in writing the Revised Latin Primer and the fight for women's access to higher education was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2019, narrated by Mary Beard.

A declared socialist, some of his most popular work depicts issues of class struggle and poverty. His work also appeared in advertisements for Liberty bonds and war savings stamps during World War I.  Early life  William Balfour Ker was born in Dunnville, Ontario, Canada on July 25, 1877. He had Scottish ancestry. His mother, Lily Florence Bell Ker, was first cousin of the inventor Alexander Graham Bell, and his father, William Ker, was a Scottish businessman and banker. The family moved to the United States in 1880, where Ker was later naturalised. He had two brothers who survived him. Ker was raised in North Yakima, Washington, and at age 18 studied law at George Washington University and began attending evening classes in illustration. The Yakima Herald reported that by February 1896 he was a reporter for the Washington, D. C. Daily Post, and by December 1896 was studying art in Paris. He ended up as an artist in New York City.  Career  Balfour Ker's cover for Life, Thanksgiving 1904 Christmas 1904 cover for Life Ker painted covers for Life magazine, including Thanksgiving and Christmas issues. Some of his illustrations for Life were published as postcards by the Detroit Publishing Company. Politically, he was a committed socialist, and this was often reflected in his art. His most famous and most- reproduced (in the form of prints)) image was From the Depths, originally published in John Ames Mitchell's book The Silent War (1906). Copies also circulated under the name The Hand of Fate. One of the former prints is held by the United States' Library of Congress. According to the LoC, it depicts: From the depths (circa 1906) The People's History of Classics research project based at King's College London note that in the background of the image are: The art historian Carolyn Haynes observes: During the First World War, Balfour Ker also designed posters advertising United States government war savings stamps for the United States Treasury.  Personal life  Ker was married twice. His first marriage was to Mary Ellen Sigsbee, a fellow socialist and a feminist, whose father, Charles D. Sigsbee, had been captain of the USS Maine during the Spanish-American War. The marriage was conducted against her father's wishes, after an 1898 elopement. They first lived in Greenwich Village, but after a period working in Paris, the marriage failed and they divorced in 1910. Following their divorce, Sigsbee married Anton Otto Fischer. All three were artists and former students of Howard Pyle. Ker and Sigsbee had a son, David (1906‚Äì1922), who was adopted by Fischer. Ker's second wife was Josephine Reeder Phillips, an American model, whom he married in England in 1914. They lived there and in France, before returning to the United States. They had four children, some before he divorced Sigsbee. These included three sons and a daughter, Yosene Balfour Ker, who was a model featured in several paintings by the artist John Sloan, and whose own daughter was the actress Tuesday Weld (born Susan Ker Weld). Ker died on October 20, 1918, in New York City, at the age of 41. Phillips died within a few years, leaving their four children, ranging in age from four to ten years, as orphans. On discovering that they were in the care of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Newark, New Jersey, Alexander Graham Bell wrote to the society, and to John Adams Kingsbury in April 1922, offering assistance.

It was the only nuclear reactor in Venezuela and one of the first reactors in Latin America. Currently, it is used as a gamma ray facility for microbiological sterilization of surgical supplies, packaging, medicine and dry food.  Characteristics  The RV-1 was a pool-type material testing reactor (MTR) with a capacity of 3 megawatts of thermal power. It contained 20% enriched uranium as core fuel and used light water as both coolant and neutron moderator.  History  During the regime of president Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, Venezuela became member of the International Atomic Energy Agency after purchasing the RV-1 reactor from General Electric in 1956. The project was supported by the administration of United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower, to help promote the Atoms for Peace program, with the United States donating US$300,000 for the construction of the reactor. The reactor was constructed in the grounds of the Venezuelan Institute of Neurology and Brain Research (IVNIC, now known as IVIC - Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research) under the supervision of Humberto Fern√°ndez-Mor√°n; he never saw the project finished, as he went into exile after the P√©rez Jim√©nez regime fell in 1958. The reactor reached criticality in 1960 and was used for several decades to perform physics research, radiochemistry, production of radioisotopes and as neutron source. RV-1 was last operated in March 1991 and the decision to permanently shutdown the reactor was made in 1997. The core was later dismantled and sent back to the United States. = Repurposing and cancelled sequels= The Venezuelan government approved 2.1 million dollars to repurpose the reactor in 2010. Under the name 'Pegamma', IVIC received the authorization in 2004 to use the renewed reactor facility as an industrial irradiation plant, with a cobalt-60 gamma rays source with a capacity of 1 megacurie. Venezuela later announced plans to build a nuclear power station in 2010. The government signed an agreement with Russia for the purchase and installation of two new nuclear reactors, but after the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, President Hugo Ch√°vez announced a halt to plans on building a nuclear power plant.

Commercial products Poster for \\"Nigger Hair\\" tobacco, later known as \\"Bigger Hair\\" In the US, the word nigger featured in branding and packaging consumer products, e.g., \\"Nigger Hair Tobacco\\" and \\"Niggerhead Oysters\\". As the term became less acceptable in mainstream culture, the tobacco brand became \\"Bigger Hair\\" and the canned goods brand became \\"Negro Head\\". An Australian company produced various sorts of licorice candy under the \\"Nigger Boy\\" label. These included candy cigarettes and one box with an image of an Indian snake charmer. Compare these with the various national varieties and names for chocolate-coated marshmallow treats, and with Darlie, formerly Darkie, toothpaste. Plant and animal names Orsotriaena medus, once known as the nigger butterfly Some colloquial or local names for plants and animals used to include the word \\"nigger\\" or \\"niggerhead\\". The colloquial names for echinacea (coneflower) are \\"Kansas niggerhead\\" and \\"Wild niggerhead\\". The cotton-top cactus (Echinocactus polycephalus) is a round, cabbage-sized plant covered with large, crooked thorns, and used to be known in Arizona as the \\"niggerhead cactus\\". In the early 20th century, double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) were known in some areas of Florida as \\"nigger geese\\". In some parts of the U.S., Brazil nuts were known as \\"nigger toes\\". The \\"niggerhead termite\\" (Nasutitermes graveolus) is a native of Australia. Colors A shade of dark brown used to be known as \\"nigger brown\\" or simply \\"nigger\\"; other colors were also prefixed with the word. Usage as a color word continued for some time after it was no longer acceptable about people. Nigger brown commonly identified a colour in the clothing industry and advertising of the early 20th century. Nicknames of people Nig Perrine During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War US Army General John J. Pershing's original nickname, Nigger Jack, given to him as an instructor at West Point because of his service with \\"Buffalo Soldier\\" units, was euphemized to Black Jack by reporters.Vandiver, Frank E. Black Jack: The Life and Times of John J. Pershing ‚Äì Volume I (Texas A&M; University Press, Third printing, 1977) , p. 67. In the first half of the twentieth century, before Major League Baseball was racially integrated, dark-skinned and dark-complexioned players were nicknamed Nig; examples are: Johnny Beazley (1941‚Äì49), Joe Berry (1921‚Äì22), Bobby Bragan (1940‚Äì48), Nig Clarke (1905‚Äì20), Nig Cuppy (1892‚Äì1901), Nig Fuller (1902), Johnny Grabowski (1923‚Äì31), Nig Lipscomb (1937), Charlie Niebergall (1921‚Äì24), Nig Perrine (1907), and Frank Smith (1904‚Äì15). The 1930s movie The Bowery with George Raft and Wallace Beery includes a sports-bar in New York City named \\"Nigger Joe's\\". In 1960, a stand at the stadium in Toowoomba, Australia, was named the \\"E. S. 'Nigger' Brown Stand\\" honoring 1920s rugby league player Edwin Brown, so ironically nicknamed since early life because of his pale white skin; his tombstone is engraved Nigger. Stephen Hagan, a lecturer at the Kumbari/Ngurpai Lag Higher Education Center of the University of Southern Queensland, sued the Toowoomba council over the use of nigger in the stand's name; the district and state courts dismissed his lawsuit. He appealed to the High Court of Australia, who ruled the naming matter beyond federal jurisdiction. At first some local Aborigines did not share Mr Hagan's opposition to nigger.Monaghan, Peter: Taking a Stand, July 29, 2005 in The Chronicle of Higher Education, available at Hagan appealed to the United Nations, winning a committee recommendation to the Australian federal government, that it force the Queensland state government to remove the word nigger from the \\"E. S. 'Nigger' Brown Stand\\" name. The Australian federal government followed the High Court's jurisdiction ruling. In September 2008, the stand was demolished. The Queensland Sports Minister, Judy Spence, said that using nigger would be unacceptable, for the stand or on any commemorative plaque. The 2005 book The N Word: One Man's Stand by Hagan includes this episode. Place names Many places in the United States, and some in Canada, were given names that included the word \\"nigger\\", usually named after a person, or for a perceived resemblance of a geographic feature to a human being (see Niggerhead). Most of these place names have long been changed. On July 27, 1962, citing a standard of \\"offensive to many\\", and \\"no one now would suggest a new name including the word\\", Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall sent a letter to the United States Geological Survey's board chairman to press for a plan to remove the use of the word \\"nigger\\" anywhere it appeared in the organization's topographical maps product, and to request a policy for and change of all occurrences of it on its maps. This led to a wider codified policy by the USGS against use of any ethnic slur in any map name. Where \\"nigger\\" appeared on USGS map objects and another suitable name had not been offered, it was changed to \\"negro\\", by 1967. In West Texas, \\"Dead Nigger Creek\\" was renamed \\"Dead Negro Draw\\"; both names probably commemorate the Buffalo Soldier tragedy of 1877. Curtis Island in Maine used to be known as either NegroIsland chronicler Charles McLane says \\"Curtis Island was known as Negro Island from Revolutionary Times to the 1930s ...\\" or Nigger Island.An early postcard shows it as \\"Nigger Island.\\" cf. The island was renamed in 1934 after Cyrus H. K. Curtis, publisher of the Saturday Evening Post, who lived locally.McLane, Islands of the Mid-Maine Coast Vol. I at p. 124 It had a baseball team who wore uniforms emblazoned with \\"Nigger Island\\" (or in one case, \\"Nigger Ilsand\\"). Negro Head Road, or Nigger Head Road, referred to many places in the Old South where black body parts were displayed in warning (see Lynching in the United States). Some renamings honor a real person. As early as 1936, \\"Nigger Hollow\\" in Pennsylvania, named after Daniel Hughes, a free black man who saved others on the Underground Railroad, was renamed Freedom Road. \\"Nigger Nate Grade Road\\", near Temecula, California, named for Nate Harrison, an ex-slave and settler, was renamed \\"Nathan Harrison Grade Road\\" in 1955, at the request of the NAACP. Sometimes other substitutes for \\"nigger\\" were used. \\"Nigger Head Mountain\\", at Burnet, Texas, was named because the forest atop it resembled a black man's hair. In 1966, the First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson, denounced the racist name, asking the U.S. Board on Geographic Names and the U.S. Forest Service to rename it, becoming \\"Colored Mountain\\" in 1968. Other renamings were more creative. \\"Nigger Head Rock\\", protruding from a cliff above Highway 421, north of Pennington Gap, Virginia, was renamed \\"Great Stone Face\\" in the 1970s. Some names have been metaphorically or literally wiped off the map. In the 1990s, the public authorities stripped the names of \\"Niggertown Marsh\\" and the neighbouring Niggertown Knoll in Florida from public record and maps, which was the site of an early settlement of freed black people.Racial slurs deleted from Fla, maps JET, (magazine), July 1992, Johnson Publishing A watercourse in the Sacramento Valley was known as Big Nigger Sam's Slough. Sign replaced in September 2016 Sometimes a name changes more than once: a peak above Santa Monica, California was first renamed \\"Negrohead Mountain\\", and in February 2010 was renamed again to Ballard Mountain, in honor of John Ballard, a black pioneer who settled the area in the nineteenth century. A point on the Lower Mississippi River, in West Baton Rouge Parish, that was named \\"Free Nigger Point\\" until the late twentieth century, first was renamed \\"Free Negro Point\\", but currently is named \\"Wilkinson Point\\". \\"Nigger Bill Canyon\\" in southeast Utah was named after William Grandstaff, a mixed-race cowboy who lived there in the late 1870s. In the 1960s, it was renamed Negro Bill Canyon. Within the past few years, there has been a campaign to rename it again, as Grandstaff Canyon, but this is opposed by the local NAACP chapter, whose president said \\"Negro is an acceptable word\\". However the trailhead for the hiking trail up the canyon was renamed in September 2016 to \\"Grandstaff Trailhead\\" The new sign for the trailhead was stolen within five days of installation. A few places in Canada also used the word. At Penticton, British Columbia, \\"Niggertoe Mountain\\" was renamed Mount Nkwala. The place-name derived from a 1908 Christmas story about three black men who died in a blizzard; the next day, the bodies of two were found at the foot of the mountain. John Ware, an influential cowboy in early Alberta, has several features named after him, including \\"Nigger John Ridge\\", which is now John Ware Ridge. Canadian Geographical Names.

After Wilson became a flying instructor and a short period as manager of the Mercury Aviation Company, founded by one of his students, Cecil B. DeMille, Wilson became more and more skilled in performing stunts, including wing-walking, and left the company to become a professional stunt pilot, specializing in Hollywood aviation films.Wynne 1987, pp. 16‚Äì17. Production started on Three Miles Up in 1927 at the newly-established Wilson Aero Service at Glendale Airport, California. Art Goebel, another actor/pilot was involved. Wilson had joined with his brother, Roy, another pilot, to create a fixed-base operation that not only worked on Hollywood films but also offered charter and passenger flights.Wynne 1987, p. 59. Wilson worked together with stuntmen like Frank Clarke and Wally Timm and also for film companies, including Universal Pictures. After numerous appearances in stunt roles, he started his career as an actor in 1923 with the serial The Eagle's Talons.Wynne 1987, pp. 5‚Äì17. Wilson produced his own movies until 1927, when he went back to work with Universal. Reception Aviation film historian Stephen Pendo, in Aviation in the Cinema (1985) said Three Miles Up was only one of a long list of aviation films that showcased Wilson's talents. He alternately wrote, acted and flew in a career that \\"spanned more than 10 years, and he acted in more films than any other professional pilot.\\" Pendo 1985, pp. 7‚Äì8, 11. In Three Miles Up , Pendo noted the aerial stunts featured Wilson who \\"as a former ace forced into crime and then trying to escape his situation.\\" The film had Wilson in a spectacular stunt, jumping \\"from one plane to another by lassoing one aircraft and swinging on the rope.\\"Pendo 1985, p. 7.

Life Ana Joaquina dos Santos e Silva was a member of the privileged Afro-Portuguese class who had a leading position within the business community of Portuguese Luanda, where white Europeans consisted of a mere thousand people at the time. She emerged as one of the leading slave traders of the booming slave trade between Angola and the Empire of Brazil in the 1830s- and 40s. The slave trade was formally banned in 1836, but continued in practice in Angola, where the economy was dominated by it. She owned several plantations for sugar and coffee, and a three stories palace residence in Luanda, which later became a museum. When Brazil banned slave trade in 1850 and the trade discontinued in practice, she had established herself as a successful banker, investor and financier of merchants, authorities and transport business.

Younghusband, Marie- Antoinette, Her Early Youth (1770-1774), Macmillan, 1912 She served as the dame d'atours to queen Marie Antoinette in 1771-1775. She is known to have curbed the expenses of the queen's wardrobe during her time in office and created order in the queen's economy, which was however ruined by her successor. Life She was the daughter of Louis-Jules Mancini-Mazarini, duke de Nivernais (1716‚Äì1798) and Fran√ßoise-Ang√©lique Ph√©lypeaux (1715‚Äì1781), and married in 1760 to duke Louis Hercule Timol√©on de Coss√©-Brissac (1734‚Äì1792). They had a son who died early, and a daughter who lived to adulthood. =Appointment= In September 1771, she was appointed dame d'atour to the Dauphine after the death of her predecessor, Amable-Gabrielle de Villars. Her appointment took place in the midst of the conflict between Marie Antoinette and Madame du Barry, and she was given the office on the request of du Barry because her spouse was an ally of du Barry and she was expected to share his loyalties and act as the agent of the royal mistress. In reality, however, she turned out to have the opposite opinions of her spouse, and allied with the crown princess against the royal mistress. Despite having du Barry to thank for her office, she refused her invitations and demonstrated her loyalty to the crown princess, which resulted in a chain of court scandals. =Dame d'atour= Ad√©la√Øde Diane de Coss√© was described as an honest and serious- minded person. When she took on her duties, she was reportedly chocked over the disorder and extravagance in the household of Marie Antoinette. In 1771, Marie Antoinette was not yet interested in fashion, and the financial disorder of her household was the result of the neglect by Ad√©la√Øde Diane de Coss√©'s predecessor in the office. Amable-Gabrielle de Villars had been given the office of dame d'atour to Marie Antoinette upon her arrival in France because the entire household of the former queen had been transferred to the new crown princess upon her arrival, and de Villars had merely kept her position. In reality, however, Amable-Gabrielle de Villars had by 1770 became too old and infirm to manage her office, and during her tenure, the Household of the Dauphine had abused her de facto absence to drain the Dauphine's economy. Ad√©la√Øde Diane de Coss√© managed to bring the finances in order and cooperated well with Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau. She kept her office when Marie Antoinette became queen in 1774. She resigned in protest in 1775 when the queen reintroduced the office of Surintendante de la Maison de la Reine for her favorite Marie Th√©r√®se Louise of Savoy, Princesse de Lamballe. de Coss√© was temporarily succeeded as dame d'atour by Laure-Auguste de Fitz- James, Princess de Chimay, but more permanently by Marie-Jeanne de Mailly. By this point, Marie Antoinette had developed an interest in fashion, which was to eventually ruin her finances. The private economy of Marie Antoinette's wardrobe was not to be met with any restrictions until de Mailly's successor Genevi√®ve d'Ossun took office and started to work toward curbing it. =Later life= Ad√©la√Øde Diane de Coss√© spent the majority of the following years in Italy and in Nice, at that time a part of Savoy, as the warmer climate was judged better for her health. Her son, born in 1771, also suffered from bad health, and she took him to Italy to improve, but he died in 1775. She lived estranged from her husband, who was the lover of Madame du Barry from 1785 until his death. On the outbreak of the French revolution in 1789, she had been in Italy since 1787, and remained she there during the revolution. In 1792, she was widowed when her husband was murdered during the September massacres. Her father was imprisoned during the Reign of Terror, and she herself was placed upon the list of emigr√©e's and her fortune in France was confiscated. In 1797, her father, who had been released, was of ill health. She successfully applied to have herself removed from the emigr√©e list on the grounds that she had never emigrated during the revolution, and have her confiscated property restored by recommendation of general Joubert, and she returned to France in September 1798.

National league National League is the highest professional tier in Swiss men's hockey. Governing body The Swiss Ice Hockey Federation organizes amateur and professional ice hockey in the country. The Spengler Cup is one biggest ice hockey tournaments in the country. Notable Swiss players in the NHL Although Switzerland is not known for producing a large number of top class hockey players there are quite a few that have gone on to have had success at the professional level. In recent years, the amount of Swiss influence on hockey at the international and NHL level is growing. = David Aebischer = Mark Streit Aebischer was a goaltender drafted in the 6th round by the Colorado Avalanche. Although mostly relegated to backup duties for most of his career he was a member of the Stanley Cup winning Avalanche in the 2001 finals. This was notable as he was the first player from Switzerland to win the Stanley Cup. Aebischer also later played for the Montreal Canadiens and the Phoenix Coyotes along with various Swiss teams. = Mark Streit = Streit was named the 13th captain in New York Islanders franchise history. This was a major milestone for hockey in Switzerland as Streit was the first Swiss player to be named the captain of an NHL franchise. He has also served as the captain of Team Switzerland at the Winter Olympic Games. Streit was drafted in the ninth round of the 2004 NHL Draft. He also later played with the Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Montreal Canadians. = Jonas Hiller = Jonas Hiller Although Hiller went undrafted he was able to have a successful NHL career in which he played in over 400 games. Hiller started his career in Anaheim with the Ducks in 2007. He played in Anaheim for seven years before spending the final two years of his career with the Calgary Flames. = Nino Niederreiter = Nino Niederreiter is an NHL forward currently playing for the Carolina Hurricanes. Niederreiter made history in the 2010 NHL draft when he was selected fifth overall by the New York Islanders. Although not initially finding much success initially with the Islanders, Niederreiter hit his stride after being traded to the Minnesota Wild for Cal Clutterbuck in 2013 scoring a career high 25 goals in the 2016-2017. = Roman Josi = Roman Josi After being drafted in the second round of the 2008 NHL draft by Nashville he made his debut in 2011. Josi made some history in the 2013 World Championships by becoming the first player to win MVP and Best Defenseman for Switzerland in the history of this tournament in route to helping Switzerland earn a Silver Medal. Josi has since played in two NHL All Star games and been named captain of the Predators. = Timo Meier = Meier is among the emerging young group of highly touted Swiss to enter the NHL in recent years. Meier was the ninth overall pick in the 2015 NHL draft by the San Jose Sharks. He was able to crack the NHL in the 2016 season and scored a career high 30 goals and 66 points in the 2018-2019 season. = Nico Hischier = Nico Hischier After being a major success playing in the QMJHL for Halifax, Hischier was considered a top prospect in his draft class and was ranked number two out of North American Skaters. This was why it was a slight surprise when the New Jersey Devils drafted him over Nolan Patrick in the 2017 draft although he has proven to be more successful than Patrick in terms of games played and scoring. Hischier broke the record for highest drafted Swiss player previously held by Niederreiter when he was selected first overall by the Devils in the 2017 NHL draft. = Other Notable Players = There have been other hockey players of Swiss nationality to have played in the NHL recently and in the past. Some of these include Martin Gerber, Raphael Diaz, Yannick Weber, Luca Sbisa, Reto Berra, Sven Andrighetto, Kevin Fiala, Denis Malgin, Sven B√§rtschi, Ga√´tan Haas, Dean Kukan, Joel Vermin, Christoph Bertschy, Mirco M√ºller, Gilles Senn, Calvin Th√ºrkauf and Jonas Siegenthaler.

While the guild of fashion merchants, Marchandes de modes, was not created before 1776, the profession had existed for a least half a century, and became reality after the success of merchants such as Duchapt. She had clients among both the Parisian aristocracy as well as the ladies-in-waiting of the Court of Versailles.

She emigrated to Charleston, South Carolina during the Haitian Revolution, and has been called the first free African to have emigrated voluntarily and freely to USA. Life Anne Rossignol was born as the daughter of the Frenchman Claude Rossignol and the African signare Madeleine-Francoise of Gor√©e. She accompanied her father and his legal French wife to France as a child in 1736. In the documents, she was referred to as her father's natural mulatto daughter. =Gor√©e= She returned from France to Gor√©e on an unknown date. By birth she belonged to the privileged Afro-France signare community of Gor√©e: her sister Marie-Therese became the sister-in-law of the French Governor of Gor√©e Jean-Baptiste Estouphan by her marriage to Blaise Estouphan de Saint-Jean in 1749. Anne Rossignol was noted to be living in Gor√©e in the 1750s, where she had a son and a daughter, Armand and Marie-Adelaide, with the Frenchman Aubert, an official of the Compagnie des Indes. As other signare's, she would have participated in the slave trade. =Saint-Domingue= In 1775, Rossignol emigrated with her children from French Gor√©e to Cap-Francais in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. On Saint-Domingue, she became a successful businesswoman in slave trade and investments in real estate. She owned a number of buildings in Le Cap, some of them luxurious and located in parts of town normally inhabited mainly by white people, and resided in a palatial building. She also owned a number of personal slaves aside from the slaves she traded in. Her living standard rivaled some of the richest white people of the colony. In 1786, her daughter married the white surgeon Guillaume Dumont, and was given a dowry larger than what was given to many of the richest white planters of the colony. She is noted as one of the three richest coloured women in the colony, alongside Zabeau Bellanton of Cap-Francais and Jeanne- Genevieve Deslandes of Port-au-Prince. =South Carolina= During the Haitian revolution, Anne Rossignol fled to Charleston, South Carolina in the United States with her daughter and her white son-in-law (her son having returned to Gor√©e). She is referred to as the perhaps first African to have freely emigrated to the United States. In Charleston, she established herself as a slave owner and planter and died as a very rich woman. Her life story is considered uncommon among the Free people of color, particularly in the United States.

Biography Paul Slevogt was born in Possendorf, a small town in central southern Germany which more recently, in 1994, was subsumed into Weimar. He was educated at a succession of schools in the area and then, in 1615, enrolled at the nearby University of Jena. He emerged five years later with a Magister degree and immediately started teaching. In 1621 he moved to Braunschweig where he became \\"Konrektor\\" (loosely, \\"deputy head\\") at the town's secondary school (\\"Gymnasium\\"). The virtuosity he displayed with his Latin verse won him plaudits and at least one important prize as a poet. Nevertheless, after three years he moved back south to the University of Jena where he remained for the rest of his career. In 1625 he accepted a professorship in Hebrew and Greek. He was also offered a professorship in Theology,wshich he turned down. He nevertheless took part in the Church Visitation of 1650. Slevogt took his share of administrative responsibilities at Jena, serving at various times as dean of the philosophy faculty and also serving three summer terms, in 1633, 1643 and again 1649, as the University Rector. Daniel Stahl, the Jena professor of Logic and Metaphysics died in May 1654. Slevogt was given the opportunity to take over that professorship. However, he himself suffered a stroke in August 1654, and after failing to make a full recovery died following a further stroke in June 1655. His body was buried at St. Michael's, the principal Protestant church in Jena. Family Paul Slevogt was married twice. His first marriage took place at Jena in 1627 and was to Ursula Freyer (1608-1636)), the daughter of a leading Jena syndic, Wolfgang Freyer (1578-1634)) and his wife, born Ursula H√ºbner (1585-1612), who as the daughter of a former mayor also came from a prominent family. Paul Slevogt's second marriage took place in 1640, also at Jena, and was to Barbara Catharina Ringler (1621-1695), the daughter of a judge. The first marriage resulted in the births of at least six children, of whom at least three survived to adulthood. The second marriage produced at least a further six children of whom four survived to adulthood. Two of the children from the second marriage achieved a measure of notability: * Johann Philipp Slevogt (1649-1727) became a law professor. * Johann Adrian Slevogt (1653-1726) became a physician.

Her husband was responsible for the slave ship that transported slaves to Cuba, while Mary Faber was responsible for the operations of the Rio Pongo: since her husband was likely almost constantly absent, she had virtually all the power in the fort, and her husband is not noted to have been involved in business there after the middle of the 1830s. There were reportedly 6,000 slaves on the Faber property in 1827. =Slave trade = To avoid the actions of the Royal Navy Anti-Slave Squadron, which made raids and destroyed slave forts after the abolition of the British slave trade, she, like other slave traders, transformed their forts into plantations, to camouflage the slaves to domestic workers not intended for export. Through her responsibility for the company's base, Mary Faber was also responsible for the complicated policy of alliances and balance of power with local tribes and other merchant families, as the region was dominated by slave-based free slave traders who were operating in various alliances with local tribes and sometimes involved in conflict and warfare with each other. Mary Faber had her own private army, which she commanded during conflicts. In the years 1838‚Äì40, she waged war against her trading rival William Ormond in Bangalan. Ormond was allied with certain actors in Freetown, which meant that Faber could portray him as a Mulattoo ally and made it possible for her to ally with the Fula tribe, whose chief pulled back his protection from Ormond, which gave Faber the victory and made her the region's premier trader. In 1842, Mary Faber and her colleague Bailey Gomez Lightburn joined their armies to help their allies, the Fula, to plunder the Susu capital, Thia, when weakened by throne fighting, and installing their own candidate there, which benefited Fula, Faber, and Lightburn. The 1840s are described as a great flowering period for the region's trade. At the same time, like other slave traders, Faber began gradually transferring its interests to peanut and coffee cultivation, although the slave trade continued in parallel. =Decline= On January 17, 1852, the British and Sierra Leone, in agreement with the domestic ruler, imposed a ban on the slave trade of the region, a ban which the lower river region had already adopted. Mary Faber, who perceived the treaty as a hostile act from the lower river trader in alliance with Freetown's \\"mulatto\\" and also as a way of releasing the lower river's Susa tribe from her allied Fula tribe power, which would hurt her business, closed alliance with her colleagues Lightburn and Charles Wilkinson and ravaged the Susu region by the lower river. The war ended with a defeat for Faber and her allies (1855), and her slave fort was burned down. The Faber family rebuilt their fort and continued business. In 1852, Mary Faber handed over the company to her son William Faber, who continued the slave trade until at least 1860. Mary Faber was last mentioned by missionaries in 1857, then only in the role of family matriarch and mother of William Faber.

Early life, education, work, communism  Drever was born in Leith, one of eleven children of an Orcadian couple, dock labourer George Drever and his wife Louisa n√©e Balfour. He was schooled at Leith Academy and became Dux in 1928. Despite his poor home background he went to the University of Edinburgh and graduated with a B.Sc in chemistry with First Class Honours and competed a Ph.D. Then he was working for Imperial Chemical Industries in Manchester as a research chemist, before being made redundant, which he claimed was due to his political activism as a communist in 1937, he later worked as a metallurgist for the English Steel Corporation in Sheffield. He spent some time teaching in the National Council of Labour Colleges. When he first volunteered for overseas service in the cause of anti-fascism, he was declared as 'too important to lose' to the UK communists.  Volunteering for the International Brigades  Banner calling Scottish workers to support the Spanish Civil War Drever was one of around 500 Scottish volunteers who went to Spain in 1937 to fight for the Republicans and the working class struggle against fascism. He had been a working class communist/socialist and although unfit for normal military service was willing to fight for this cause. He had originally volunteered for Abyssinia when invaded by Mussolini but his service was refused. Through the local communist party Drever heard the call for 'our best comrades' to go to Spain, and felt he was one of these 'best' to go. He was given a rail ticket and did not tell his parents or friends. He was 27 years old. His purpose was not just to fight fascism in Spain but to be trained in weapons ready for 'revolution' back at home. Drever was also one of those who were pragmatically aware that the Republican cause was unlikely to succeed, even before he left. He was considered it strange that fellow communist thought he would not need to carry his own pack as a volunteer soldier, as he was from the educated classes. The volunteers assembled at the London Communist Party HQ before arriving in Paris and sending his mother a postcard \\"don't worry'. The group entered Spain secretly on foot through the Pyrenees and were greeted at Figueras by some hungry Republican soldiers and local people before travelling on by train to Tarazona for basic training. In the battalion Drever was attached to first, the political attache was a Bob Cooney from Aberdeen. His first shock was the destruction of towns they marched through together such as Belchite, where he was posted with Jimmy Rutherford, a fellow Edinburgh volunteer from Newhaven whom he had known for couple of years through the Labour League of Youth and Communist Party at home was a Spanish speaker. Their group got cut off for three days from the rest during a group tank attack and in the confusion came across the enemy and were taken prisoner with John Goldstein, another Spanish speaker from the battalion.  Prisoner of war and return  The prisoners had really expected to be executed at once, but were taken by train to a prison camp at Valladolid, with only tinned fish, bread and figs to eat en route, at stopping points local women gave them water. That camp included Spanish deserters and international prisoners including Germans and Poles. The experience was grim with little food, poor sanitation and lice infestation. They were then moved to a larger camp at Burgos where the German Gestapo were selecting prisoners such as Jews and non Europeans, who were taken and never returned. His comrade Jimmy Rutherford, who had been in Spain before, despite being only 21 also expected to be chosen (as he had disobeyed an interdict on returning to Spain), and was indeed selected and executed. Drever wrote in code to inform their Communist Party comrades in Edinburgh of his loss. At his next prisoner camp in Palencia, Drever met other Scots like Donald McGregor, who was also dead by the time Drever was interviewed in 1986. On return after 9 months imprisoned, with his family having been wrongly informed that he was killed in action, and memorials in Leith and his home area of Westray, Orkney, on his return there was celebration organised by Tom Murray at the Free Gardeners' Hall, Picardy Place and an article appeared in the Edinburgh Evening News. Drever was said to feel some sort of 'survivor guilt', returning home before the battles were finished and some of fellow soldiers were killed. He was pleased that his mother did not repay the death insurance that had been claimed, although he had to pay his return fare from Spain to the British Government. He had trouble finding employment in any of the Edinburgh chemical firms (having been declared dead, as a known Communist) and so had to move to Sheffield. The British Special Branch did confirm in 1967 that 'blacklisting' had taken place in his case and his lack of career progress in both military and civilian life could be attributed to his beliefs and activism in the Spanish Civil War.  Later recognition  Drever kept in touch with fellow volunteers in the International Brigade Association, attending gatherings in Spain and Germany. He was interviewed in the 1980s in a collection of personal stories from the Scottish International Brigade and his photograph hung in the National Galleries of Scotland. Memorial to Scottish international brigade volunteers in the Spanish Civil War; in Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh Drever also was in a group pictured for Glasgow Herald 5 December 1981 and in the National Galleries newsletter in 2009 with a photograph from 1986, when a memorial to volunteers was unveiled in Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh. His son David wrote to the National Galleries in 1986, that his family: > ..have his death certificate, issued by the Republican government in > Spanish, which was sent to my grandmother after he was lost in action. Also > his obituary, as a well known Leith communist, appeared in local newspapers > and in the Orkney Herald at the time (both his parents were from Westray). > In addition a memorial meeting was held to celebrate his life - and no doubt > to raise further funds for the struggle. The story had a happy ending and he > turned up very alive and was repatriated after the fall of the Republic... > ...Socialist politics remains the lifeblood of our family and his children > and grandchildren are immensely proud of his part in one of the great > democratic struggles of the 20th century. > References Category:Spanish Civil War Category:Scottish chemists Category:University of Edinburgh Category:1910 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Leith Category:Prisoners of war held by Spain Category:Blacklisting in the United Kingdom ","title":"George Drever"},{"id":"61089995","text":"The 2019 3. divisjon (referred to as Norsk Tipping-ligaen for sponsorship reasons) is a fourth-tier Norwegian football league season.

The leading developer of Model 107, China's first indigenously designed general-purpose electronic computer, she has been called the \\"Mother of Computer Science in China\\". She and her husband Yang Liming were both elected academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1991. In 2010, she was honoured with the inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award from the China Computer Federation. In 2015, the China Computer Federation in memory of academician Xia, the predecessor of computer science in China, awards the Xie- Piesu Award annually to female scientists and engineers recognised for their \\"outstanding contributions and achievements in the computer science, engineering, education and industry.\\"  Early life and education  Xia was born on 28 July 1923 in Chongqing, Sichuan, to a literary family. Her grandfather, Xia Fengxun (Â§èÈ£éËñ∞), who had passed the imperial examination for the xiucai degree during the late Qing dynasty, spent forty years as a teacher. Her father, Xia Hongru (Â§èÈ∏øÂÑí), who had passed the provincial imperial examination for the juren degree, ran a school in Jiangjin County, Chongqing. Her mother, Huang Xiaoyong (ÈªÑÂ≠ùÊ∞∏), was a teacher at the Jiangjin Girls' Middle School and headmistress of Jiangjin Girls' Primary School. Under the private tutelage of her family, Xia built a solid foundation in ancient Chinese prose and mathematics at a young age. At fourteen years old, Xia was accepted into Nanyu Secondary School (now Chongqing Nankai Secondary School), where she consistently placed at the top of her class and excelled in mathematics. In 1939, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Xia was forced to transfer to the National No. Nine Middle School in Jiangjin County. She graduated high school in 1940 at the top of her class and began her undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at the National Central University the same year. After attaining her bachelor's degree, Xia pursued postgraduate studies at the Telecommunications Research Institute of National Chiao Tung University (Chongqing) from 1945 to 1947. In 1947, Xia began a PhD in electrical engineering at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, where she earned her doctorate with a thesis entitled \\"On Parametric Oscillations in Electronic Circuits. (II) A Graphical Analysis for Non-Linear Systems\\" in 1950.  Career  Two years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Xia and her husband Yang Liming returned to China in 1951. She took up an appointment as an associate researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University. In the fall of 1952, mathematician Hua Luogeng initiated the development of China's first electronic computer, and recruited Xia and two other scientists to lead the project at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). This became the turning point in her career. Four years later, she became a founding professor of the Institute of Computing Technology of the CAS, where she spent the remainder of her career. After the two other scientists, and Wang Chuanying, both left the project, Xia led the development of China's first indigenously designed general-purpose electronic computer, Model 107, in 1958. She has been acclaimed as the \\"Mother of Computer Science in China\\". Xia made numerous contributions to the research and design of high-speed computers in China. She is also credited with designing a high-speed array processor and a range of multiple parallel computers. She helped establish the Chinese Journal of Computers in 1978 and the Journal of Computer Science and Technology, the only English language journal in the computer field published in China, in 1986. In March 1956, Xia taught China's first course in computer theory, and wrote Principles of the Electronic Computer, the first systematic computer science textbook in China. When the University of Science and Technology of China was founded in 1958, Xia was in charge of establishing its computer science department. She taught more than 700 students from 1956 to 1962. Xia advised more than 60 graduate students, two of whom won top national prizes for Ph.D. dissertations. Her students included Li Guojie, who led the development of the Sugon supercomputers; and , the chief architect of the Loongson CPU. When Loongson unveiled China's first indigenously designed CPU in 2002, Hu named it Xia-50 to celebrate her five-decade-long career in computer science. In 1991, Xia Peisu and her husband Yang Liming were both elected as academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In recognition of her contributions to China's computer industry, the China Computer Federation honoured Xia with its inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010, along with .  Personal life  In 1945, Xia met Yang Liming, an alumnus of National Central University. They married in 1950, when they were both studying at the University of Edinburgh. Yang later became a prominent theoretical physicist. The couple had two sons, Yang Yuenian and Yang Yuemin. The children followed the footsteps of their parents: Yuenian became a computer scientist, and Yuemin a physicist. Xia died on 27 August 2014, aged 91.

Giordani studied in Milan where he encountered the Salesians of Don Bosco alongside his brother Camillo. His brother was inspired to become a priest while Giordani was inspired to become a catechist and evangelist catering to the needs of the local children and adolescents. His work at a Salesian-managed oratorio was where he would meet his future wife (whom he married in 1944) during the time he did mandated service with the Italian armed forces during World War II. He had three children and followed them to Brazil to do volunteer work in the missions there. His time there was short-lived as he died suffering a heart attack while giving an address to a crowd. The process for Giordani's beatification launched in Milan (rather than Brazil where he died as would be the custom) in 1994 and he became titled as a Servant of God. The cause took a step forward in late 2013 after Pope Francis titled him as Venerable upon confirming that Giordani had practiced heroic virtue throughout his life. Life Attilio Giordani was born in Milan on 13 February 1913 as the first of three children to Arturo Giordani and Amalia Marucco. His father was a railroad worker who each winter morning would go to bring a basket of coal to two poor old men before going to work. His mother was a housewife who suffered from frequent bouts of illness. He had two siblings: sister Angela (who became a professed religious in the Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco) and brother Camillo (b. 3.4.1923). From 1922 he started to attend school in the Oratorio di Sant'Agostino dei Salesiani with his brother Camillo under the direction of the Salesians of Don Bosco religious congregation. Their influence prompted Camillo to pursue a path in the priesthood while inspiring Giordani to take an active role in parish initiatives and to become a catechist among adolescents like the Salesians did. Giordani was an active member in the Saint Augustine parish that the Salesians managed. He would attend his brother Camillo's ordination to the priesthood (which he received from the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster) on 25 March 1950 in Milan. He also served as a soldier in the Italian armed forces at intermittent periods between 23 July 1934 until 8 September 1944 just before World War II ended; he was first sent from Milan to the Greek-Albanian front before serving in other areas. He was also a worker in the Pirelli Industries in Milan around this stage. He married fellow catechist Noemi D'Avanzo on 6 May 1944 (the parish priest Pietro Lajolo presided over the marriage rite) and the pair had three children together (son Pier Giorgio in 1945 and daughters Maria Grazia in 1947 and Paola in 1952). He was a diligent catechist who was noted for his intelligence and cheerfulness and was also known to have possessed a good sense of humor when he did his catechizing and evangelizing. Giordani also helped start the Crusade of Kindness movement in the 1950s which received the blessing of the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Giovanni Battista Montini (the future Pope Paul VI) and the support of the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (the future Pope John XXIII). Giordani suffered a heart attack in 1962 which forced him to suspend his usual activities for a long period of rest in Deiva Marina. His three children (Pier Giorgio had married Laura sometime in the 1960s) moved to Brazil to be volunteer missionaries in a mission that was organized in Mato Grosso do Sul under the direction of the priest Ugo De Censi. He himself - after discussing the matter with his wife - decided that the pair would join them in Brazil in 1972 to help in their work despite his ill health which was in gradual decline. He and his wife arrived in Brazil from the Genova port (leaving on 21 June 1972) on board the ship \\"Giulio Cesare\\" in Poxoreu. He had some knowledge of the Portuguese language but did not become fluent in it. His daughters Maria Grazia and Paola returned to their homeland in October 1972 for work reasons. He died from a heart attack on 18 December 1972 in Campo Grande. He had been speaking to a crowd of people before he felt weak and suffered a fatal heart attack. He reclined his head on the shoulder of Ugo De Censi before turning to his son Pier Giorgio and managed to whisper to him to continue in his stead. His remains were returned home on 23 December and buried in a grave at Vendrogno but moved later to the Basilica di Sant'Agostino in Milan (his old parish and the church the Salesians managed). Beatification process The beatification process launched in the Milan archdiocese in a diocesan process that Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini opened on 21 November 1994 and later closed at a special Mass on 19 January 1996. The process saw the accumulation of documents and witness testimonies from those who knew Giordani such as his children. This diocesan investigation was carried out despite the fact that the formal introduction to the cause did not come until the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) edict and titled Giordani as a Servant of God on 22 November 1994. The C.C.S. later took charge of the investigation and issued a decree validating the diocesan investigation on 20 March 1997 and receiving the Positio dossier for evaluation in 2001. Nine theologians confirmed their approval for the cause at their congress held on 5 February 2013 while the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. likewise confirmed their approval for it at their meeting held some months later on 24 September 2013.

This trend would increase throughout Ch√°vez's tenure, later culminating in the Venezuelan refugee crisis. From the beginning to the end of Ch√°vez tenure, it was estimated by the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) that 1.5 million Venezuelans (four to six percent of the country's total population) had emigrated.  History  = Election of Ch√°vez = In 1998, when Ch√°vez was first elected, 14 Venezuelans were granted asylum in the United States; according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 1,086 Venezuelans were granted asylum in the 12-month period ending in September 1999. Ch√°vez's detractors said that they were concerned with his \\"history of violence\\" ‚Äì leading a failed military coup d'√©tat attempt. His promises to allocate more funds to the impoverished also concerned wealthy and middle- class Venezuelans, triggering the first wave of emigrants fleeing the Bolivarian government. = 2002 coup d'√©tat attempt = After the coup d'√©tat attempt in April 2002 and years of political tension following Ch√°vez's rise to power, Venezuela experienced a spike in emigration. A May 2002 cable from the United States embassy in Caracas to United States agencies expressed astonishment at the number of Venezuelans attempting to enter the United States. By June of that year, many Venezuelans with family or links to other countries had emigrated; others, who had immigrated to Venezuela, began to leave due to economic and political instability. = Re-election of Ch√°vez = Following the 2006 presidential elections and Ch√°vez's re-election, visits to emigration websites by Venezuelans increased; visits to MeQuieroIr.com (Spanish: I want to leave) rose from 20,000 in December 2006 to 30,000 in January 2007, and there was a 700 percent increase in visa applications from Venezuelans at vivaenaustralia.com.  Causes  Ch√°vez's promise to allocate more funds to the impoverished concerned wealthy and middle-class Venezuelans, triggering the first wave of emigrants fleeing the Bolivarian government. Later in his tenure, Ch√°vez would seize private property and target political opponents, sparking increased uneasiness and ultimately emigration. Andr√©s Bello Catholic University Economic and Social Research Institute head Anitza Freitez stated that during the Ch√°vez presidency, \\"individual development prospects and individual security\\" were the main causes of emigration from Venezuela.  Deterrents  Venezuelans also chose not to emigrate during the Ch√°vez administration; an increased emigration rate was prevented due to deterrents. Though Venezuelans faced increased unrest later in Ch√°vez's tenure, they were also prevented from leaving the country due to economic issues such as the Great Recession and because they lacked destination locations. According to professor Manuel Gomez of Florida International University, Venezuelans at the time \\"weren't willing to sacrifice their social and professional status for a lesser life\\", though this would change as the crisis in Venezuela intensified.  Effects  The United States embassy in Caracas stated in May 2002 that the \\"drain of skilled workers could have a significant impact on Venezuela's future\\". This sentiment would also be shared later by Newsweek, with the magazine stating in 2009 that \\"the outrush of Venezuelan brainpower is gutting universities and thinktanks, crippling industries and hastening the economic disarray that threatens to destroy one of the richest countries in the hemisphere\\" and that \\"the biggest export of the Bolivarian revolution is talent\\". By 2009, 9,000 Venezuelan scientists resided in the United States while 6,000 lived in Venezuela and it was estimated that more than one million Venezuelans had emigrated in the ten years that Ch√°vez was president. According to the Central University of Venezuela (UCV), an estimated 1.5 million Venezuelans emigrated between 1999 and 2014.  Destinations  Many of the wealthy Venezuelans emigrated to the United States, mainly choosing to reside in Miami, Doral and Weston, Florida, while others decided to settle in Panama City. Venezuelan oil professionals utilized their trade to work in Canadian oil industries.

He was named after Justin Hayward, the front man for the musical group The Moody Blues. His father is Terry Martin Walker, a real estate appraiser. His mother, Deborah, and father divorced in 1985 after nine years of marriage. Walker says that he was raised by a \\"a single working mom\\" who \\"made indescribable sacrifices to provide me, the first in my family to graduate from college, with the opportunities she didn‚Äôt have herself.\\" His step-grandfather, Norton Cohen, was president of the Acme Paper Stock Company and a prominent member of Louisville's Jewish community, while his maternal grandfather, Frank R. Metts, was a millionaire real estate broker who the New York Times characterized as a \\"power broker in Kentucky.\\" Walker grew up in a Democratic household, though his mother had supported Republican Mitch McConnell when Walker was 8 years old. Walker became active in Republican politics at an early age. While in high school, Walker's step-grandfather arranged to have Walker interview Mitch McConnell for a class paper. In 2002, while he was a college student, Walker interned for McConnell. Walker earned his Bachelor of Arts from Duke University in 2004 and his Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 2009, where he served as Notes Editor on the Harvard Law Review. While at Harvard, now-Associate Justice Elena Kagan, then dean of Harvard Law School, recommended him for a clerkship with Justice Anthony Kennedy. In 2004, he worked on the re-election campaign of George W. Bush. Walker later worked as a speechwriter for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in the Bush Administration.  Legal career  Upon graduating from law school, Walker served as a law clerk to then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He then clerked for Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy of the Supreme Court of the United States. During the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court, Walker gave 119 interviews to the media defending Kavanaugh, and gave several paid speeches to the Federalist Society. He has been a member of the Federalist Society since 2006. From 2015‚Äì2019, Walker served as an associate professor at the University of Louisville School of Law, where he taught legal writing. In July 2018, Walker had a paper published in The George Washington Law Review reflecting on President Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey and arguing, \\"calls for an independent F.B.I. are misguided and dangerous... the F.B.I. must not operate as an independent agency. It must be accountable to the President.\\"  Federal judicial service  = District court = On June 19, 2019, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Walker to serve as a United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. Walker was nominated to the seat vacated by Judge Joseph H. McKinley Jr., who took senior status on June 9, 2019. The American Bar Association (ABA) rated Walker \\"not qualified,\\" saying that Walker \\"has a very substantial gap, namely the absence of any significant trial experience.\\" In a letter, the chairman of the ABA committee said \\"it has no questions about Walker's temperament or integrity and that it believes he has great potential to serve as a federal judge.\\" On June 24, 2019, his nomination was sent to the Senate. On July 31, 2019, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On October 17, 2019, his nomination was reported out of committee by a 12‚Äì10 vote. On October 24, 2019, the Senate voted 50‚Äì39 to invoke cloture on his nomination and later that day his nomination was confirmed by a vote of 50‚Äì41. He received his judicial commission on October 25, 2019. His service terminated on September 2, 2020, due to appointment to another judicial position. In April 2020, Walker blocked Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer from implementing an order preventing drive-in church services on Easter to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Walker compared the order to \\"the pages of a dystopian novel\\", and said that Fischer \\"criminalized the communal celebration of Easter\\". Vox described Walker's opinion as \\"oddly partisan\\", noting that there was no actual ban on drive-in church services, and that Fischer had twice attempted to contact the court to communicate this fact, which would have rendered the case moot. The Volokh Conspiracy described the opinion's rhetoric as \\"over-the-top\\"; the decision irrelevantly listed deceased former Klan members affiliated with the Democratic Party. In August 2020, Walker ruled that photographer Chelsey Nelson is not bound by the Louisville Fairness Ordinance and cannot be compelled to photograph same-sex weddings, which she opposes due to her Christian faith. = D.C.

He was best known for his portrayal of villains in the melodramas that flourished at London's Adelphi Theatre in the 19th century. He also played more sympathetic characters and, for a time, was under the management of Sir Henry Irving at the Lyceum. He toured extensively with productions around England and the provinces, as well as spending a season in India, two seasons in Australia and three in the USA.  Early life  Cartwright was born on 7 March 1851 in Clerkenwell, London to George Morley, a farmer from Berkshire turned wheelwright, and Caroline (n√©e Lane) who was of Huguenot descent from Bethnal Green, London. The family lived in Warren Street in central London. Educated at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, he became a government clerk in London, a position his parents had organised for him. But the lure of the stage drew him to Birmingham in 1873, where he put himself forward for a role in a burlesque performance of Don Giovanni and changed his name to Charles Cartwright to avoid being found out by his parents. He spent the following year travelling around England in search of acting and singing engagements to develop his stage skills. In 1874, he became a stock actor at the Prince of Wales theatre in Liverpool. He appeared in burlesques and operettas until the arrival of the actress Jennie Lee heralded a move to more serious drama and an opportunity for a stand out role as Chadband in Little Jo, an adaptation of Charles Dickens' Bleak House.  Career  Following Little Jo's transfer to London‚Äôs Globe Theatre in 1876, Cartwright moved away from burlesque to join the company at the Theatre Royal in Manchester, taking on a number of roles in Shakespearean revivals under the management of Charles Calvert. After appearing as Osric in Henry Irving‚Äôs touring production of Hamlet, Cartwright joined the company at the Lyceum on its return to London. His first role at the Lyceum was as Irving‚Äôs stunt double in a production of Vanderdecken, a play by W.G. Wills and Percy Fitzgerald in which Irving's character falls off a cliff. Subsequently, Cartwright stayed at the Lyceum for two years, first under the management of Sidney Frances Bateman and then Irving. He performed in a range of classical plays but found a talent for making villains credible, such as Job Trotter in the Dickens' adaptation, Pickwick. But in 1879, some ill-judged comments led to Cartwright leaving the Lyceum. The company was on tour, sailing from Scotland to Ireland, when Henry Irving became ill with seasickness. Cartwright quipped that Irving didn't look like the young Hamlet. When the company was back in London, Irving informed Cartwright that his role in the forthcoming Hamlet revival would be that of the servant of Polonius - a part with barely any lines. Cartwright left Irving's company and travelled to Bombay, where he had been hired to manage the launch programme of 35 musical and theatrical productions at the city's new Gaiety Theatre, which opened on 6 December 1879. = 1880s = Arriving back in London in 1881, Cartwright joined William Creswick's company at the Surrey Theatre for a Shakespearean revival season, before joining Edwin Booth‚Äôs 1882 tour in the north of England. In Liverpool, he appeared as Troy in J Commyns Carr‚Äôs adaptation of Far From the Madding Crowd. The popular adaptation, in which Thomas Hardy was personally involved, premiered on 27 February 1882, before going on a provincial tour and then transferring to London. He established himself in London and, in 1883, appeared with Kyrle Bellew and Marie Litton in a hugely successful production of Moths, an adaptation by Henry Hamilton of a novel by Ouida. He would go on to reprise his role in Moths a number of times in London, the provinces and colonies. The success of Moths guaranteed Cartwright a steady stream of leading roles. In 1887, he joined the company at the Adelphi Theatre in London, appearing in a number of productions alongside Olga Nethersole and William Terris. He was in 102 consecutive performances of The Silver Falls, winning plaudits for his powerful and clever characterisation of the villain and appeared in long runs of melodrama such as The Bells of Haslemere, The Union Jack and Harbour Lights. = 1890s = The heavy performance and touring schedule took a toll on Cartwright's health. In October 1890, in search of a better climate, he took a company on a ten month tour of Australia, opening in Melbourne's Bijou Theatre, on contract to the Brough and Boucicault Comedy Company. After Australia, Cartwright returned to the Adelphi, where his performances included Oliver Cromwell in The White Rose (23 April ‚Äì 10 June 1892) and Jeptha Grimwade in 200 performances of William Pettit‚Äôs A Woman‚Äôs Revenge (1 July 1893 ‚Äì 3 March 1894). In between engagements at the Adelphi, he broke away from playing villains to portray more sympathetic characters. He became involved in producing and directing plays, looking for new works, particularly literary adaptations. In 1894, he directed The Two Orphans (12 May ‚Äì 18 June 1894) at the Adelphi, with himself in the lead role and with Marion Terry playing one of the sisters. He was also in contact with authors and playwrights, among them Thomas Hardy, with whom he worked in Liverpool, and Oscar Wilde, who asked Cartwright to stage The Duchess of Padua. In 1895, he went into business with the theatre manager Henry Dana, taking out a 21-year lease on the Trafalgar Theatre. His first move was to change the name of the theatre to the Duke of York's, after gaining the approval of the future King George V. Opening with a successful run of Walter Frith‚Äôs Her Advocate, he eventually sub-let the theatre to the team behind The Gay Parissienne, which ran for 369 performances. In early 1899, Cartwright sailed to Australia for a second tour at the invitation of Harry Rickards, with a repertory of seven plays for which he had secured the Australian rights. Cartwright had assembled a company from London, this time with Beatrice Lamb as his leading lady. At a farewell dinner before his departure, Charles Wyndham and Max Beerbohm Tree delivered speeches rebuffing Clement Scott‚Äôs incendiary views on acting which he had published in January 1898 as 'Does the theatre make for good?' News of the farewell party and its speeches was extensively covered in the media of the day. The tour took in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth, before sailing back to England in October 1898. = 1900s = Cartwright began to concentrate once again on producing and directing plays. Setting up the London Matinee Syndicate Ltd., he solicited investment in theatrical productions with the promise of 10% returns. Investors in this scheme would have seen dividends from Cartwright's staging of English Nell at the Prince of Wales, with Marie Tempest in the title role. It ran for 176 performances, one of which was captured as an early film. Buoyed by these successes, Cartwright travelled to America for the 1904-5 season, having assembled a group of actors including his brother-in-law Edmund Lyons for a run of Zwangwill‚Äôs Leah Kleschna at the Manhattan Theatre. With Minnie Fisk in the lead role and Cartwright playing the manipulative Kleshna, the play was a critical and commercial success, running for 131 performances. Less popular was Cartwright's attempt at writing. The production of The Proud Laird, a play he had co-written with Cosmo Hamilton, closed after being described by The New York Times as \\"muckle ado aboot naething‚Äô. Other successful plays in the tour were Zwangwill's Merely Mary Ann and Nurse Marjorie. He returned to Broadway for the 1906-7 season and in 1910-11 toured California in David Belasco's production of The Lily, taking in the Clunie Theatre in Sacramento and the Mason Theatre in Los Angeles, before arriving back in England towards the end of 1911.  Death  On 3 April 1912, while performing in Chester Bailey Fernald's play 98.9, Cartwright suffered a stroke which forced him into retirement. He died of acute bronchitis and syncope at his home in Swiss Cottage on 25 May 1915, survived by his wife Eva and their daughter Edith. He is buried at St Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green.

In its day, according to The Literary History of Alberta, it was considered Alberta‚Äôs leading literary magazine. It started as an annual publication and then became biannual. Over the years, Dandelion featured fiction, poetry, visual art and reviews. Contributors consisted of emerging and established Canadian authors including Joan Clark, Edna Alford, Carol Shields, Robert Hilles, W. P. Kinsella, Robert Kroetsch, Guy Vanderhaeghe, Aritha van Herk, and Karen Connelly, among others. Facing financial and operational difficulties in the late 1990s, the magazine moved to the University of Calgary Department of English where it was rebranded as dANDelion and published by a series of editorial collectives and faculty advisors until 2011.  History  =1970s= Dandelion Magazine was the brainchild of then Calgary-based writers Joan Clark and Edna Alford. In the early 1970s, they were participants in a writers' workshop at the University of Calgary led by poet and faculty member Christopher Wiseman. During coffee breaks, they talked about starting a literary magazine where emerging Alberta writers could publish their work. The first issue was produced in the summer of 1975 at the Dandelion Artists‚Äô Cooperative located at the historic Deane House in Calgary‚Äôs Inglewood neighbourhood. Early editions were typewritten, stapled chapbooks with cardstock covers featuring a silkscreened dandelion flower by visual artist Velma Foster. For the first four years, the editors used their own funds to publish the annual magazine. Each edition of the magazine was launched at a public event in various locations around Calgary, including the Deane House. The emergence of Dandelion Magazine was part of a decade literary critic Bruce Meyer called \\"a period of intense literary activity in Canada.\\" In the 1970s, there were \\"more active writers than at any other time in Canadian history, and there were more magazines available to publish their work than ever before.\\" In 1978, the magazine listed an editorial advisory board composed of Christopher Wiseman, Robert Kroetsch, Eli Mandel and Velma Foster. In later editions, W. P. Kinsella, Joan Clark, Edna Alford and Dale Fehr were added to the masthead. The City of Calgary closed the Dandelion Artists‚Äô Cooperative in 1978 to turn the Deane House into a restaurant and teahouse. The magazine borrowed space at the Alexandra Centre nearby, eventually establishing a business office there.

With the aid of thieves Dmitry Ignatovich and Sergey Astafurov, the gang robbed numerous places around the Vitebsk Region and Brest Region, with Pugachev and Burdenko themselves killing two girls and two car enthusiasts. For their crimes, the criminals received their respective punishments. Members * Sergey Pugachev (b. 1972) - a former entrepreneur, noted for once selling pantyhose on the market. * Alexander Burdenko (b. 1974) - originally attending the same school in Polotsk along with Ignatovich, Burdenko entered the Yaroslavl Higher Military Financial School, where he was later kicked out of for lack of discipline. While living in Russia, he had received a suspended sentence for robbery. According to sources, his favorite type of item to steal is gold. * Dmitry \\"Dimka\\" Ignatovich (b. 1974) - originally attending the same school in Polotsk along with Burdenko, Ignatovich was sent to a prison colony for theft, from which he later escaped, hurting an officer in the process. He managed to become a proficient thief afterwards. * Sergey Astafurov (b. 1970) - described as an \\"authoritative\\" thief by his fellow gang members, Astafurov, despite being a big talker and heavy drinker, had the ability to deal with any kind of alarm. It is also noted that one member of the gang practised occultism in order to bring them luck, much to the amusement of his co-conspirators. However, it is unclear who that member is. Formation The thirst for profit between the former school buddies would eventually make them cross paths again, with Ignatovich borrowing $200 from Burdenko, giving him a Makarov pistol as deposit. Later on, Burdenko introduced Ignatovich to Pugachev, and in turn, the former let Astafurov into the gang. Crimes In the span of three years, the gang would rob a large number of facilities, assault multiple victims, steal money and engage in banditry. The following crimes are their most notable: =2001= * Ignatovich and Astafurov stole an office safe from an entrepreneur, containing $250‚Äì300 dollars. However, one of them was scared off by the watchman. * During the summer months, Pugachev and Burdenko, under the influence of alcohol, lured two girls on separate occasions into their Volvo with the aim of stealing their gold jewelry. The first victim, 24-year-old Valentina Balchugina, had her head smashed in with an iron pipe. The other victim, 20-year-old Poland-based dancer Sveta Golovach, an acquaintance of the criminals, was strangled with a belt. The gold was then shared between the two. =2002= * Pugachev and Burdenko would regularly travel from Polotsk to the Lepiel-Polotsk Highway, bordering with the Russian town of Opochka. They would install spikes on the road, camouflage themselves and their guns, binoculars and radios, and wait for victims. On the night of April 21, 2002, they were unlucky, and drove home in a bad mood. While passing through the village of Kolektivniyi, the duo noticed a lone Mitsubishi Galant along the road. The car belonged to Russian car enthusiast Nikolay Petrachkov, from Slantsy, who had lost contact with his friends near the village of Kingisepp. Burdenko shot the sleeping Petrachkov through the glass, and at Pugachev's request, finished him off with a headshot. The victim's money and cellphone were taken, and his blood-soaked Galant was burned in a forest in the Rossony District. * A few months later, a similar event was repeated, when Pugachev shot and killed another car enthusiast from Slantsy named Georgy Romanov. His corpse was also buried in the forest, with his Volkswagen Passat also being burned. =Spring 2002 to November 2003= * Several raids were carried out by the quartet on companies, enterprises, apartments and villas of wealthy people in the Vitebsk Region and Brest Region, with the loot amounting to around 130 million rubles. The criminals stole computer equipment, car batteries, washing machines, gas stoves and gold jewelry, all of which would be sold in their native Polotsk. =2003= * The quartet prepared for at least a week to kidnap the Novopolotsk-based Kovalevich family, who were currency traders, for a ransom worth $30,000. Burdenko was tasked with watching the victims. On June 26, 2003, in broad daylight, he informed his accomplices that the spouses were entering the apartment. When they exited the elevator, the husband and wife were shot with the Makarov and an improvised revolver. Although severely injured, Mr. Kovalevich managed to fight off the criminals with a fishing pole, while his wife hanged back with a bullet in her stomach. The elevator doors then miraculously closed, with the spouses managing to crawl out in the street and call for help. They were later transported to a hospital and saved by the doctors. However, the gang had escaped through a pre-planned route: through the roof. =Undated= * Among their numerous robberies, another notable attack on a family was done by the gang. Three of them had tried to break into the dacha of Ivan Stepanovich N., with his wife and 3-year-old child present, all camouflaged, carrying batons and handcuffs. Although Ivan was beaten up and his arm broken, his wife managed to close the door in the attackers' faces before calling the police. Because of this, the criminals were scared off and ran away. Discovery and capture On September 11, 2002, the decomposing body of an unidentified man was found by forester Alexander Zholudev. The victim had a bullet from a Makarov lodged into his head. Although some detectives had the feeling this would quickly become a cold case, inspector Yevgeny Gulyaev, who was recently on a business trip to Slantsy, noticed a group of drivers along the road. When one of their cars broke down, he asked them if any of their colleagues had gone missing, with one replying that somebody indeed had: Georgy Romanov. The corpse found in the forest was quickly identified as that of Romanov by the traffic police, but soon after, another body was discovered along the same road. The authorities, who had learned that Petrachkov had also gone missing in the area, connected the dots when a bullet was also found in the head of this body as well. Both killings pointed towards a gang operating in the area. Later on, another forester by the name of Alexander Sergeevich recalled that several months earlier, he had seen a strange man hanging around the burial site at 5 o'clock in the morning. When they approached the man, he quickly entered his car and speeded away. The criminals were eventually captured when the cellphone belonging to Petrachkov, which Burdenko registered in his name, was traced and monitored by the police. After a month of close observation, the operatives moved in to arrest the criminals on November 13, 2003. Just a few days before, one of the gang members, Astafurov, sensed that there was some kind of ambush awaiting him in his home, and so he hid in a box storing potatoes. Trembling with fear, he spent two days in there before being discovered and arrested. However, Burdenko remained the only one uncaptured, with policemen only confiscating some of his items for examination. To the authorities' surprise, however, Burdenko himself later appeared in the police department, demanding that they return the things seized during the search. He was arrested on the spot, and other evidence was discovered in his apartment: $4,000 dollars, an investigator's handbook for investigating banditry, a book about Russian pistols, a radio, handcuffs and a cache of Makarovs. Quickly realising that they had been watched, the gang confessed to all of their crimes. Trial and sentences When charged, the other members rallied behind their leader Burdenko, accusing the police of beating them into confessing. Meanwhile, Balchugina's mother, driven to despair by the fact that the criminals never revealed where her daughter's corpse was hidden, believed that she was still only kidnapped, and set out to Moscow to look for her. As for the gang, after five hours of deliberation, Justice Leonid Petrov handed out the following verdicts: * Sergey Pugachev - sentenced to death and subsequently executed in 2005. * Alexander Burdenko - sentenced to life imprisonment in a special regime colony. * Dmitry Ignatovich - sentenced to 18 years imprisonment in a reinforced regime colony. * Sergey Astafurov - sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in a reinforced regime colony.

Early life and education Valerio was raised in Bushwick, Brooklyn in New York City. Her father was a Honduran merchant seaman, and her stepfather worked at the laundry facilities of a hospital. Her mother ensured they had a sit-down family meal every night and strictly kept Valerio to a homework schedule. She had three siblings; her mother and some of her siblings had obesity-related health problems including diabetes and hypertension. She was already overweight by the time she was in high school, though she signed up to play field hockey anyway. She recalls that the first practice, which involved running laps, left her so sore that it was painful to move the following day. Eventually, she came to enjoy running as part of practices. She also discovered her talent for singing, and attended The Juilliard School during the weekends after a successful audition. Because of her love of music, Valerio attended Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio for college. While there, she studied the Spanish language as well as vocal performance. Running career After she experienced a health crisis in her early thirties and was notified of artery inflammation, Valerio began exercising more regularly. Soon, she was running a 5K race every week. She found she enjoyed running longer distances, and has since run marathons and ultramarathons; additionally, she participates in trail running. She began documenting her running experiences as a large-bodied woman on her blog, Fat Girl Running, which she started in 2011. While reception to her blog was generally positive, she notes that there have been detractors. She said, \\"I think there‚Äôs some inherent racism and sexism going on, especially with body image and body shape. They don‚Äôt like to see me on a cover of a magazine because I do not represent what fitness means to them.\\" A typical running pace for her is a thirteen-minute mile. As of 2018, when not training for an event, she ran an average of each week. Awards and honors In 2018, she was named a National Geographic \\"Adventurer of the Year\\". She appeared on the cover of Women's Running magazine for their September 2017 issue. Nichols and Sarah Menzies created a brief video about Valerio with funding from REI called The Mirnavator. Personal life She married Cito Nikiema, originally from Burkina Faso, after they met in New York City. Together, they have a son.

The company's line ran from Fair Haven, New York, on the south shore of Lake Ontario, to Athens, New York, in the Southern Tier and just over the border from Sayre, Pennsylvania. The company was incorporated in 1865 and became part of the Lehigh Valley Railroad system in 1895. Most of its line was abandoned by the Lehigh Valley Railroad between 1937‚Äì1979; the portion between Harford Mills, New York, and Owego, New York, is owned by the Tioga County Industrial Development Agency and operated by the Owego and Harford Railway.  History  The Lake Ontario, Auburn and New York Railroad, chartered in 1852, had graded a line between Fair Haven and Auburn, New York, but ran out of money without ever laying track. The new Southern Central Railroad was chartered on September 6, 1865, to complete this work and build a line from Fair Haven due south to Owego, New York, where it could interchange traffic with the Erie Railroad. The railroad opened between Owego and Auburn on March 8, 1870. The Erie was at that time still a broad gauge railroad, which made interchange with the standard gauge Southern Central difficult. With financial assistance from the Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Southern Central built south from Owego toward the state line at Athens, Pennsylvania (later Sayre), and an interchange with the Pennsylvania and New York Railroad, a Lehigh Valley Railroad company. This extension opened on January 3, 1871. The northern part of the line to Fair Haven finally opened on December 1, 1871. Financial problems led to the Lehigh Valley leasing the company in 1887. The debts were such that in 1895 the Lehigh Valley formed a subsidiary, the Lehigh and New York Railroad, to buy the Southern Central in a foreclosure sale; after which the Lehigh Valley leased the Lehigh and New York. The latter company was merged into the Lehigh Valley at the end of 1949. Under the Lehigh Valley the line was known first as the Lehigh and New York Branch, then later as the Auburn Branch.  Route  = Auburn Branch = The line from North Fair Haven to Sayre measured . It interchanged with several other railroads, including the New York Central Railroad, New York, Ontario and Western Railway, Erie Railroad, and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. The Lehigh Valley abandoned the coal dock at North Fair Haven cut back the northern end of the line to Fair Haven in 1937. After World War II the Lehigh Valley gradually abandoned the branch. In 1952‚Äì1953 it further cut back the branch from Fair Haven to Cato, New York. The construction of the New York State Thruway in 1954 eliminated the interchange with the New York Central at Weedsport, New York, leading to a further abandonment between Cato and Auburn, New York in 1957. In 1968 the Lehigh Valley Railroad, now under Pennsylvania Railroad control, abandoned the branch between Auburn and Moravia, New York. In the last years of Lehigh Valley operation the line north of Owego was split off into two secondary tracks: * the Mead Secondary, from end of the line just north of Moravia to Freeville, New York, where it interchanged with the Lehigh Valley's Elmira and Cortland Branch * the Freeville Secondary, from Freeville south to Owego The remaining Auburn Branch between Sayre and Owego was not included in Conrail, given the parallel Erie Lackawanna Railway main line, and abandoned after April 1, 1976. = Owego- Harford = Although the New York Department of Transportation spent $832,000 to rehabilitate the line north of Owego, neither of the two secondary tracks was included in Conrail. Additional subsidies from the state of New York led to Conrail operation of the entire Sayre‚ÄìMead line, although the line was abandoned north of Locke, New York, after August 31, 1976. Ownership remained with the bankrupt Lehigh Valley Railroad. In April 1978 the Lehigh Valley further abandoned the portion between Locke and Dryden, New York. A final abandonment in 1979 removed the line between Dryden and Harford Mills, New York. On January 1, 1980, the Delaware and Hudson Railroad replaced Conrail as the operator of the line north of Owego. In 1981 the Tioga County Industrial Development Agency (IDA) acquired the line from the trustees of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, then leased it back to the D&H.; The D&H; terminated the lease in 1985 after the close of the Arco Petroleum Products storage facility in Harford Mills. The Tioga Central Railroad operated both freight and excursion service on the line from 1986‚Äì1992, when the IDA replaced them with the Owego and Harford Railway, which continues to operate the line today.

Background  Screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment is an evidence-based, public health approach aimed at delivering early intervention and treatment services for individuals at risk of developing substance use disorders (SUDs) and those who have already developed these disorders. \\"SBIRT is recognized to include the use of validated screening tools, assessing for substance use risk and problems, sharing expert health promotion and disease prevention advice, and conducting interventions that encourage substance use reduction and/or referral to treatment‚Äù, says the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in their policy statement for SBIRT and adolescents. The SBIRT model was developed by the Institute of Medicine as a result of a recommendation that encouraged community-based screening for health risk behaviours, including substance use. Unhealthy and unsafe alcohol and drug use are major preventable public health problems resulting in 3 million deaths every year worldwide, as reported by WHO. Research shows SBIRT to be most effective with patients with unhealthy alcohol or drug use who do not have a substance use disorder; therefore, the primary goal of SBIRT is intended to reduce the harms and societal costs associated with the risky use of such substances before the problem elevates to a disorder.  Three major components  As explained by SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration), SBIRT consists of three major components: *Screening: A healthcare professional assesses a patient for risky substance use behaviours using standardized screening tools in any healthcare and school-based healthcare setting. *Brief Intervention: A healthcare professional engages a patient showing risky substance use behaviours in a short conversation, providing feedback and advice. *Referral to treatment: A healthcare professional provides a referral to brief therapy or additional treatment to patients who screen in need of additional services = Screening = Screening in primary care settings is recommended by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force for alcohol misuse accompanied with brief behavioral counseling interventions for those engaged in risky or hazardous drinking to reduce alcohol misuse. Screening using formal screening tools or questions can quickly assess the severity of substance use, though importantly, this procedure is distinct from simply asking whether someone drinks alcohol or uses drugs. Individuals at certain levels of risk may receive tailored feedback on risky behavior, which can greatly influence patient behavior. Screening large numbers of individuals present an opportunity to engage those who are in need of treatment and refer them to correct resources. Efforts to provide an evidence base for alcohol screening and brief intervention in primary health care settings have been started since the 1980s in the US and the World Health Organization. This research led to the development of reliable screening tools for alcohol and drug abuse, such as the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test, the CAGE, and the Drug Abuse Screening Test. Research also extended to understanding the best mode of administration of such screening assessments, as part of a clinician interview via a questionnaire, or electronically. Using computers as a means of screening has been in evolution for two decades and recent studies have shown promise for this method. One such study examined the effect of electronic screening with personalized feedback on adolescent health risk behaviours in a primary care setting. In a randomized clinical trial, involving 300 youth randomly assigned to receive screening through an electronic screening tool called Check Yourself with personalized feedback vs usual care, youths who received the electronic screening intervention were more likely than controls to receive risk counseling and also, scored lower on risk behavior. Evidence supporting the effectiveness of screening in primary care settings continues to grow and the positive evidence from this research has encouraged national demonstration programs in the US to control substance abuse, such as King County's Best Start for Kids. In the United States, the dissemination of SBIRT technologies has been strongly supported by SAMHSA's SBIRT initiative. Universal, annual screening identifies unhealthy use of alcohol and drugs, and it's reported that 75-85% of patients will screen negative. For those who screen positive, further assessment is needed to determine the level of risk associated with their use. = Brief intervention = Following the screening, if it is determined that individuals substance use is hazardous, brief intervention is conducted. The brief intervention aims at providing detailed feedback, which focuses on increasing insight and awareness regarding substance use and instills motivation towards behavioral change. Originally, the brief intervention utilized brief advice approaches, whereas current U.S. SBIRT efforts focus on motivational interviewing approaches of various lengths. Intervention usually includes giving feedback on the risks and negative consequences of substance use, advising on modifying alcohol and drug use and suggestions options to choose from to modify risky behavior, hence encouraging the individual to exercise decision making. An important strategy used to conduct Brief Intervention is FRAMES; _F_ eedback on the risk for alcohol problems, _R_ esponsibility: where the individual with alcohol misuse is responsible for change, _A_ dvice: about reduction or explicit direction to change, _M_ enu: providing a variety of strategies for change, _E_ mpathy: with a warm, reflective, empathic and understanding approach and _S_ elf- efficacy of the misusing person in making a change. = Referral to treatment = In cases where brief intervention has shown to have a little effect, the individuals are referred to treatment. A referral is usually indicated for only about 5% of people screened.  Applications & Implementation of SBIRT  The applications of SBIRT are very flexible so it can be delivered in various settings, including, primary care centres, school-based health centers, clinics, and other community settings provide excellent opportunities for early intervention with at-risk substance users and for intervention for persons with substance use disorders. SBIRT has proved its importance in many medical settings in facilitating early identification of risky substance use, therefore many recent studies are exploring new approaches to understanding SBIRT and how best to implement the intervention to achieve the greatest positive results.

It was described by A. J. Mix in 1938. Taxonomy Taphrina polystichi was described in A. J. Mix in 1938. Mix notes that the fungus was originally identified as Exoascus filicinus by Coker, though this is not listed as a synonym of the species. A molecular phylogenetic study of the genus suggested that T. polystichi and T. virginica were conspecific. However, the authors described a new species based on the strains of T. polystichi and T. virginica in a later study using molecular phylogenetics and physiology, but they did not synonymize the taxa. Description Taphrina polystichi causes 0.5 to 1 cm, yellowish or whitish swollen spots on leaves. Ascogenous cells are produced on both sides of the leaf, but asci are only produced on the upper leaf surface. Asci are stalked and are 30-46 by 4-8 micrometers. Ascospores are elliptic and 3-6 by 2-4 micrometers. In a trials of nitrogen utilization, T. polystichi was able to use ammonium chloride, ammonium citrate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, magnesium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, dl-alpha alanine, l-arginine, dl-aspartic acid, l-glutamic acid, dl-histidine, and dl-valine. In trials of carbon utilization, T. polystichi was able to use dextrose, sucrose, maltose, melezitose, trehalose, dextrin, inulin, and mannitol. It was unable to use lactose, rhamnose, inositol, i-erythritol, xylose, and succinic acid. The ability to use mannitol and the inability to use xylose and succinic acid distinguished it from the other species tested.

His positions included the Schutzhaftlagerf√ºhrer of the Auschwitz-Birkenau men's camp, where he oversaw the selection process for the gassing of thousands of detainees. He was later transferred to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, where he held the post of the Lagerdirektor, second only to the overall camp commander Fritz Suhren. With Suhren on the run, Schwarzhuber was the highest-ranking defendant during the first Ravensbr√ºck trial. In front of the British military tribunal he was indicted for war crimes, sentenced to death and subsequently executed in 1947. Early life and career Schwarzhuber was born on 29 August 1904 in Tutzing, at this time part of the Kingdom of Bavaria in the German Empire. He trained as a printer and married his wife in 1936, with whom he fathered two children. As an early supporter during the rise of Nazism he joined the NSDAP and the SS in 1933. By 1935 he was trained for the position as block leader in the Dachau concentration camp. At the outbreak of World War II he was transferred to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he acted as commander of the Klinkerwerk sub-camp. Auschwitz In September 1941 Schwarzhuber was again reassigned and moved to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. As a Lagerf√ºhrer, he was responsible for several inmate blocks and regularly mingled with the prisoners. He was regularly drunk at work and built up relationships with some of the Kapos. Nevertheless, he fulfilled his job dutifully as overseer of parts of the extermination camp. In November 1943 he was promoted to Schutzhaftlagerf√ºhrer and took over the command of the Auschwitz men's camp. In this position he was also responsible for the selection process, which determined who was sent to the work camps and which prisoners were sent to the gas chambers. Thousands of inmates who were chosen by Schwarzhuber during this process were immediately killed. However, there were also a few instances of him pulling out non-eligible groups of inmates from the 'gas-queue' and 'protecting' them by putting them into the regular men's prison camp. In November 1944 he returned to Dachau, now in charge of several sub-camps of the Kaufering concentration camp complex. This tenure did not last long, and he received his final deployment to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp in January 1945. Ravensbr√ºck and trial In Ravensbr√ºck, Schwarzhuber was directly responsible for the women's camp. With almost all of the Ravensbr√ºck inmates being women, Schwarzhuber effectively commanded the entire complex, second only to overall camp leader Fritz Suhren. The camp was overcrowded; sanitation and food supply were insufficient. Many people froze to death due a lack of clothing and heating. To combat the overcrowding, daily executions of about 50 inmates were ordered at the start of 1945. The killings were so cruel, that several camp deputies refused to oversee the murders until Schwarzhuber took over and the executions proceeded uneventfully. Ravensbr√ºck was initially not intended to be an extermination camp, but during the last months of the war, deaths spiked massively. Thousands of women were killed in a newly built provisional gas chamber, coinciding with Schwarzhuber's arrival in the camp. The Ravensbr√ºck camp was captured by the British Army in April 1945 and Schwarzhuber was detained. The British launched a series of trials against the camp personnel starting in December 1945. With the main camp leader Fritz Suhren having fled, Schwarzhuber was the highest-ranking official indicted during the trial. He pleaded 'not guilty' and claimed to have attended only one mass execution in the camp, when 150 women were gassed at once in the chamber. It is not clear who gave the order to start mass executions in Ravensbr√ºck‚Äîwhether it was Suhren as overall commander or even Heinrich Himmler personally‚Äîbut with Schwarzhuber in charge of the women's camp, significant responsibility nevertheless fell on him as deputy commander. Schwarzhuber was found guilty and subsequently sentenced to death. The execution was carried out on 3 May 1947.

Amos, 483 U.S. 327 (1986), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court decided that the exemption of religious organizations from the prohibition of religious discrimination in employment in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act is constitutional. Appellee Arthur Frank Mayson worked for 16 years an organization operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was terminated from employment when he \\"failed to qualify for a temple recommend, that is, a certificate that he is a member of the Church and eligible to attend its temples.\\"Corporation of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327‚Äì349. He filed suit in district court, arguing that his firing violated discrimination on the basis of religion in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The district court agreed. The case was appealed directly to the Supreme Court (under Title 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1252). The Supreme Court reversed, holding that Title VII's exemption of religious organizations from the prohibition on religious discrimination, even in secular activities, did not violate the First Amendment. History and District Court ruling In the early 1980s, five individuals were terminated from employment at Deseret Gymnasium, a non-profit facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, which was operated by the Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the LDS Church. The reason for termination was \\"solely because each of them was unable or refused to satisfy the Mormon Church worthiness requirements for a temple recommend.\\"Amos v. Corporation of Presiding Bishop, 594 F.Supp. 791‚Äì831 (Utah 1984). The individuals filed suit, alleging impermissible discrimination on the basis of religion in violation of ¬ß 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They argued that section 703 stated, \\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer‚Äî(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual‚Äôs race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\\" with the exception that \\"it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to hire and employ employees . . . on the basis of his religion, sex, or national origin in those certain instances where religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.\\"42 U.S.C. ¬ß 2000e‚Äì2(a), (e)(1) [section 703(a)(1) and (e)(1) in the original bill]. The LDS Church argued that section 702 protected the organization in its employment decisions, because the act included an exemption: \\"This subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State, or to a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities.\\"42 U.S.C. ¬ß 2000e‚Äì1(a) (section 702 in the original bill). The individuals responded that permitting a religious organization to discriminate \\"against employees performing secular, non-religious jobs on the basis of religion would violate the establishment clause of the [F]irst [A]mendment.\\" The district court concluded that the individuals were engaged in non- religious activity but noted that section 702 protected religious organizations in their employment decisions related to any position in the organization, no matter how religious or nonreligious the activity was. The court then addressed whether the exemption violated the Establishment Clause by using the Lemon test. The court ruled that the exemption permitted by section 702 violated the second prong of the Lemon test (principal effect not advancing or inhibiting religion) because the section \\"singles out religious entities for a benefit, rather than benefiting a broad grouping of which religious organizations are only a part\\" and \\"burdens the free exercise rights of employees of religious institutions who work in nonreligious jobs.\\" Supreme Court rulings =Majority opinion= In reversing the district court on the supposition that section 702 singled out religious entities for a benefit, the Court stated that it had \\"never indicated that statutes that give special consideration to religious groups are per se invalid\\" and that \\"[w]here, as here, government acts with the proper purpose of lifting a regulation that burdens the exercise of religion, we see no reason to require that the exemption come packaged with benefits to secular entities.\\" In addressing the issue of a free exercise burden of employees, the Court noted that \\"it is a significant burden on a religious organization to require it, on pain of substantial liability, to predict which of its activities a secular court will consider religious.\\" Further, although the appellee's \\"freedom of choice in religious matters was impinged upon, [] it was the Church (through the COP and the CPB), and not the Government, who put him to the choice of changing his religious practices or losing his job.\\" The Court also reiterated, \\"A law is not unconstitutional simply because it allows churches to advance religion, which is their very purpose. For a law to have forbidden \\"effects\\" under Lemon, it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through its own activities and influence. . . . [W]e do not see how any advancement of religion achieved by the Gymnasium can be fairly attributed to the Government, as opposed to the Church.\\" =Concurrence in judgment by Brennan and Marshall= Justices Brennan and Marshall agreed with the court on the significant burden issue, stating that nonprofit organizations should be categorically exempt from religious discrimination issues because the prospect that a court would attempt to determine whether or not the nonprofit activity was reasonably religious or related to the religion's purposes would \\"chill\\" religious activity. =Concurrences in judgment by Blackmun and O'Connor= Though he wrote a brief separate opinion, Blackmun stated he basically agreed with O'Connor's reasoning that the Court's majority opinion could be read too deferentially toward religion, and that though in this particular case the judgment was correct, there was concern that profit-making enterprises run by religions may be improperly exempted from religious discrimination laws. Implications According to Google Scholar search results, the Court's ruling (or one of the concurring opinions) has been relied on in about 2,700 court cases as of June 2019, indicating that this case has had substantial impact on the development of First Amendment religion case law. The case is also cited in thousands of articles and books on case law.

Plot  Elena, 35, is a cynic about relationships. Jake, 26, is a romantic. They meet randomly and have what they both presume to be a one-night-stand. They meet again, and consumed by infatuation, they spend day and night together, missing work, and talking into the early hours. Jake seamlessly moves in with Elena and she reveals a secret: for fear of rejection she lied about her age. She's not 28, she's 30. A few hours later she's 32. A couple of hours after that she's 34... Jake finds it funny that she has aged six years in five hours, and doesn't care. Elena insists the age difference is a problem - her parent's divorce has given her a fundamental mistrust of relationships. She pushes Jake away professing that she is ready to have children and he is too young ‚Äì their relationship will not last. Jake's mum died when he was seven and he was bought up by his father who was devoted to his wife, and has not had another relationship since her death. Jake has inherited a surety about love and commitment which Elena cannot resist. Jake tells Elena he wants nothing more than to make a family with her and he doesn't want to waste any time. They start to make love. Six months later Elena isn't pregnant. A casual trip to the GP to check things are okay leads to tests at the hospital and a tense appointment where they are told that there is nothing wrong with either of them, but because they have been trying for over six months they should put themselves on the list for an IVF date in another six months‚Äô time. Elena has a horrible sense of foreboding. They have already embarked on a journey from which there is no turning back. Jake is optimistic. He is convinced that they will manage to conceive before the months are up. Elena is uplifted by Jakes optimism and buys into the idea that they will manage to have a baby naturally. The months go by. Sex becomes strategically timed. It leads to nothing but disappointment and IVF starts to feel inevitable. Elena and Jake try to face it with optimism. They put it to the back of their minds that the odds of IVF resulting in a pregnancy are low. They embrace the injections and appointments and interventions. It is an opportunity to have a baby. It will be worth it. But it fails. They both begin to privately doubt the possibility of ever having a family. They take out their disappointment on each other. Elena has a growing paranoia that Jake will leave her if she doesn't give him a child. A second round of IVF fails. An explosive argument leads to Elena telling Jake to leave. Jake tells Elena if he goes he will never come back. After time apart, Elena attends her best friends wedding and when she returns home that evening she gathers Jake's remaining belongings and texts him suggesting they meet so she can deliver them to him. They meet in a cafe and Elena breaks down. She is still profoundly in love with him and she tells him he was right when he said that they already were a family and that what they had together was too special to lose. Jake walks out abruptly leaving Elena in tears. He goes to stay with his dad and talks to him about Elena. He tells his dad that he doesn't know what to do, he and Elena had a perfect relationship just like his dad and mum did and he doesn't know how to get that back. His dad explains to Jake that perfection is just an illusion. He asks Jake if he still loves Elena and Jake nods. He then asks him what he will do if they never have children together; Jake covers his face with his hands. In the penultimate scene Jake sits alone, thoughtful. In the final scene, we see Elena walking through the park on an Autumnal afternoon. She eventually comes to Jake who is stood waiting for her. They walk towards and embrace each other tenderly.

Ian Freer of Empire magazine noted the film's heartfelt, indie-romance aspirations, describing Only You as \\"that rare effort that could go toe-to-toe with its American counterpart, a passionate, moving love story told with nuance and heart\\".Freer, Ian (July 8, 2019) Empire Only You Review Similarly Peter Bradshaw described it as \\"a poignant and compelling Venn diagram of passion and heartache\\".Bradshaw, Peter (July 10, 2019) The Guardian 'a sad, tender and gloriously sexy love story' Phil de Semlyen in Time Out called Only You a \\"compassionate, complex relationship drama will get you right in the feels\\",De Semlyen, Phil (July 4, 2019) Time Out 'Only You review' while in Sight & Sound Pamela Hutchinson reflected Wootliff's storytelling ability, 'a beautifully written screenplay, with a subtly symmetrical structure signposted by two spins of the mournful, urgent I Want You by Elvis Costello, but primarily driven by two recognisably familiar, fully realised characters'Hutchinson, Pamela (August 1, 2019) Sight & Sound 'Only You review: a love forged in childlessness' In The Observer Mark Kermode felt Only You was 'a perfectly realised story of love and longing' and 'a terrifically engrossing drama about two wholly believable characters, made with the kind of wit, honesty and raw emotional intimacy that pierces right to the heart of their relationship'.Kermode, Mark (July 24, 2019) The Observer 'Only You review ‚Äì a perfectly realised story of love and longing' In The Evening Standard, Charlotte O'Sullivan was quick to point out the original take on the subject matter, 'O‚ÄôConnor has argued that Only You is ‚Äúas important as I, Daniel Blake‚Äù.

Plot It is an interesting story of a young, street-smart girl, Pakhi (Chahat Pandey), who does what it takes to get her way. She uses her silky voice quality to entice her cheating uncle who had duped her dead dad. He has also taken over their house, making her mom slog like a slave. Cut to the other lead, we have B-Grade actress, Natasha (Reeva Chaudhary). However her biggest drawback is her husky voice which puts paid to her efforts to get launched by big film producer, Kapadia (Rajesh Kumar).The latter clearly tells Natasha‚Äôs manager, Akash (Manas Shah), that he can sign her only if they get a sexy voice to dub for her. Accordingly, they hold an RJ competition where a desperate for a job Pakhi also turns up. Here too, she pulls a fast one to get ahead in the long line of wannabe contestants (reverses her token number from 221 to 122). As Akash and Natasha insult her regarding the racy audition lines, she puts up a perfect act, but then walks out. Natasha and Akash love her voice but she is nowhere to be found. The real 121 had a bad voice. As fate is to have it, Pakhi finds a job as personal assistant with Natasha, who entrusts her with the job of finding the missing voice. Pakhi is adamant on not helping Natasha out, but needs her salary, so plays along. The male lead is budding photographer, Naksh (Zaan Khan), who is being forced by his eccentric granny, Ba (Sarita Joshi), to give up his passion and take over the family catering business. Natasha‚Äôs car crashes into Naksh‚Äôs set of wheels, and Pakhi uses that to curry favour with the actress. Pakhi keeps bumping into Naksh, who she again uses (calls him a husband to get a car for Natasha). To make matters worse, she and her mother become tenants in his house by impressing Baa. Natasha pulls every trick in the book to force Kapadia‚Äôs hand, even hires women to smear ink on her in an attempt to get publicity. Unknowingly scuttles the plan, but then helps get more media mileage, courtesy a well-orchestrated drama at the press conference, which the fourth estate very easily swallows. Unable to wait any longer, Kapadia chooses another talent. Upon hearing this, a very enraged Natasha drops in at his office and manhandles the new gal. The assault video goes viral and an angry Kapadia reads Akash the riot act. By then, the penny has dropped on Akash about the token change, but even here Pakhi moves a step ahead, dropping ink on the register, so her name is not legible. In the meantime, Pakhi who was fooling Naksh, helps him win a competition. Akash finally finds out the truth about Pakhi.Akash tells Natasha that Paakhi is the girl who have that voice that Natasha wanted.Paakhi refused to dub for Natasha.After that Natasha blackmails Paakhi by showing a edited video made by Natasha in which baa pours poison in orphan children's food.Then Paakhi dubs for Natasha.After that Naksh and Paakhi fall in love with each other.Then natasha tells the truth of Paakhi to Naksh that Paakhi dubs for her.Finally naksh knows the truth.The twist ends up Paakhi marrying Naksh.

Nowadays the dilapidated chateau is being reconstructed by volunteers from the town sponsored by the deputy of mayor. Neogothic chateu Galanta main wing  History  The family \\"Esterhazy\\" had a major role in the history of the town. They built several buildings. The most important one was the chateau, originally designed as a Renaissance fortress- like residence, from the year 1633. The building was designed by the brothers Daniel and Pavol Esterhazy. Construction started in 1633, during the first large economic expansion of the family. The main wing, the east entrance Another member of the family Imrich, a bishop from Nitra, had it reconstructed in Baroque style in 1736. Only marble fireplaces have been preserved from this reconstruction It was given its present neo-Gothic appearance inspired by English Gothic in 1861.The latest and most radical modernisation was in 1861 based on romantic English Gothic style \\"Zachr√°≈àme spolu n≈° Neogotick√Ω ka≈°tieƒæ v Galante\\" (official website of the Castle)]\\"Pamiatkov√Ω objekt - podrobnosti\\" Official Record at Register nehnuteƒæn√Ωch NKP The tower, east side  Appearance  . The chateau is a monumental building with a U-shaped ground plan. The side wings create a closed courtyard. The two storeyed entrance wing used to be residential. There is a ceremonial staircase leading into the main rooms on the first floor. The side wings used to be farm houses. = Exterior = The original U-shaped ground plan has been partially preserved until today. The right wing has been separated from the main one and completely reconstructed.  The side wings  The tower, detail of the third floor Both of the side wings have escalated frontage, each level is decorated with profiled quatrafoil and a little roof over it. The shape of the frontage copies the shape of a saddle roof, whilst it is taller and makes the wings appear more monumental than they actually are. It may appear that the side wings were not jointed to the main wing in the first place since the profilation of the frontage is repeated on the other side of the side wings facing the main wing just a couple of meters far from it. Since the side wings were originally used as stable there are only three small front windows in a row, centrally placed on the wall. All the windows are exactly alike; with a pointed arch on the top and no extra decoration.  The main wing  The main wing is now being reconstructed since it was in almost fatal condition. The wing is a two storied residence with one dominating feature - a four storied tower on the west side. The whole wing escalates from the bottom to the top. The plinth is simple stone work, just as the first floor. The windows have rectangular shape, but apparently used to have a pointed arc on the top. The cornice dividing the first and the second floor is also rustic and minor. While on the second floor, the windows are decorated with a simple edicule without any tympanon. The windows are united by another plain cornice. The chateau does not have a whole entablature, only the cornice and an arc-shaped frieze with added blind circle windows. The main entrance used to be from the west side of the main wing. It appears like a one part triumphal arch connected to the wing.  The tower  The side wing, original frontage The tower is accented by four axially symmetrical bow windows reminding four smaller towers on the top. The placement of windows on the tower is obscure. They have the same shape (narrow with a pointed arc on the top) but they differ in size and a number in each storey. The most decorated ones are on the second floor, pointing to the importance of the floor. These windows slightlyresemble a triumphal arc. There are three equally long windows with two columns dividing them. In the bottom there is a low blind attic supported by two round corbels. A peculiar feature of the tower are small round windows above the third floor, they probably represent a reference to the decor of the frieze. . The tracery in the windows is very simple (round) and made of stone. The same is repeated on the west side in the middle part of the main wing. = Interior = Many historical rooms have not been entirely preserved, only some of the details, especially the vaults. The rooms differ in types of vaulting. Usually, they are rib vaults supported by funnel-like corbe s. An eye-catching element is the handrail of the main staircase. It is crafted in Gothic style and probably used to be gold plated.  The chateau nowadays (2019)  The building is in a bad condition caused by poor care of the town council during communism and after the Velvet revolution. In 2012 the reconstruction began, due to interest of one of the Galanta's deputy and volunteers, which are organised by the Voluntary association Neogotick√Ω ka≈°tieƒæ v Galante (Neo- Gothic chateau in Galanta).
