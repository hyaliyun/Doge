The State party of Rajasthan presented an overview of the process for the selection of component sites for the series of Hill Forts and the criteria selected. The criteria set resulting in the selection process followed the four following perimeters: The forts adapted to the Geography of the Hilltops, the fortifications were power centers, they included sacred grounds, and the fort was designed with urban settlements. Rajputs adhered to architectural texts that categorized different typologies of fortifications based on their geography. The earliest literary references differentiated four types of forts; Hilltop Forts, Water Forts, Forest Forts, and Desert Forts. This series of world heritage sites was created solely on the Hilltop Forts of Rajasthan. This and excluded many forts solely based on typology such as Junagarh Fort which is a ground fort. Furthermore forts that were not designed for urban settlement were excluded. Mehrangarh, although situated on a hilltop, was a fortified citadel for the court which lacked an urban settlement for the civilians. An initial list Forts of Rajasthan was created based on all forts recorded by the Archaeological Survey of India. Of the hundreds of fortifications, 54 forts were further examined as they shared integral characteristics of Rajput military architecture. The State party explained how from this initial listing, a smaller group was selected made of 24 of the most significant forts of Rajasthan which all shared key aspects of Rajput Fortifications. This number was soon shortlisted to 13. From this list five forts were initially selected, all of which were located on the Aravalli Range, and belonged to different clans. The sixth fort, Jaisalmer was later added into the series.

The KazISS provides research related to international and domestic affairs as well as the social and economic development of Kazakhstan. The KazISS aims to provide predictive research and analysis for the country's leadership. History  =Establishment = KazISS' predecessor was the Center for Strategic Studies, established in 1992. The center was reorganized to become a full-fledged research institute by its first Director Umirserik Kassenov, a career diplomat. The idea to found an institution of strategic studies was supported by Vice-President of Kazakhstan Yerik Asanbayev. The Kazakhstan Institute for Strategic Studies was ofiicially founded on 16 June 1993, under the Decree of President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Its mission was to provide predictive research and analysis of strategic issues of external and internal nature for further development of Kazakhstan. In the first years of its functioning, the Institute experienced a number of difficulties mostly due to the lack of material resources and qualified experts in international and domestic political affairs]. The KazISS started to employ the graduates of the Kazakh State University and the Kazakh State University of World Languages, orientalists and scholars from the Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences. Initially, in terms of foreign policy analysis, the KazISS focused on the issues of national interest and security threats to Kazakhstan. Domestic issues, being increasingly pressing, gradually gained more attention of the KazISS experts. In the yearly 1990s, the KazISS offered its analysis on the background of comprehensive reforms of political, social and economic nature. The major task before the institute was to find the best ways that would enable the new nation to pursue its external and internal course. At first, the KazISS mainly dealt with the issues of nuclear arsenal deployed in the territory of Kazakhstan and its participation in the START I. The experts soon expanded their research scope embracing geopolitics and international security. Soon Director Kassenov and other KazISS experts established contacts and cooperation with a number of prominent think tanks abroad. Umirserik Kassenov and his colleagues made considerable efforts to apply their potential and influence so that the nuclear issue would be solved positively for Kazakhstan. As the result, in 1994‚Äì1995 Kazakhstan received security guarantees from the world nuclear powers in exchange for the agreement to abandon the Soviet nuclear arsenal. As the Institute gained experience and reputation in Kazakhstan, a number of prominent figures of world politics paid their visits, namely Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1993 and former United States Secretary of State James Baker in 1996. Umirserik Kassenov succeeded in gathering a team of professionals with expertise in nuclear physics, economics, Sinology, Islamic studies and other fields. Ye. Arynov, M. Spanov, R. Zholamanov, K. Khafizova, D. Yeleukenov, K. Syroyezhkin, A. Sultangaliyeva and many others contributed greatly into the work of the Institute under his leadership. Later K. Abuseitov and some other experts were employed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In turn, a number of young career diplomats joined the KazISS experts‚Äô pool bringing their practical experience that immediately affected quite positively the overall performance of the institute. Since then the two structures continue to coperate. Umirserik Kassenov largely contributed to the success the Institute achieved in the first years of its functioning. However, due to the frictions with the Administration of President of Kazakhstan, the first Director of the Kazakhstan Institute for Strategic Studies eventually resigned from his post in 1997. =Late 1990s= In the late 1990s the KazISS had rather difficult period; throughout the year there were three directors. Lev Tarakov managed to prevent complete dissolution of the KazISS and persuaded some experts to return. Director Tarakov laid the foundations of the current structure of the KazISS. More importantly, he introduced new research methods, strengthened the ties with the analytical staff within the Presidential Administration and launched the Kazakhstan-Spectrum journal. Alma Sultangaliyeva succeeded Lev Tarakov as the Director of the KazISS. Being an academician orientalist, a new director made the KazISS analysis receive more academic character, more attention was paid to the issues of Islam. The shift of the analytical focus proved well-timed as the Islamic factor in the world politics and particularly in Central Asia grew in importance. In 1998, Yermukhamet Yertysbayev headed the institute. Director Yertysbayev had both a political and academic background. He was able to establish an active dialogue with the opposition. = Current Developments = Maulen Ashimbayev and Bulat Sultanov, January 11, 2013. In 2000, the new management was appointed at the KazISS led by a young academic Maulen Ashimbayev who previously had supervised analytical work for the Presidential Administration. The institute was then accountable to Marat Tazhin and the Center of Political Analysis under the President. In the context of aggravated international situation, growing security threats in Central Asia posing mainly by Afghanistan, 9/11 and subsequent US-led anti-terrorist operations as well as significant geopolitical changes, the KazISS enhanced its interaction with the Security Council and other security and analytical structures. The analysis conducted at the KazISS reflected these developments. Under Ashimbayev the Institute intensified its work in all directions: external and internal security, strategy for Kazakhstan in the new international environment, sustained economic development and Caspian issues. Maulen Ashimbayev established steady communication with the Presidential Administration; the analytical materials prepared by the Institute were directly conveyed to the recipients therein. The number of publications increased dramatically; the Institute started to issue four journals; two in Russian, one in Kazakh and one in English. Director Ashimbayev made Kazakh a full-fledged working language at the KazISS. The number of analytical materials and publications in the Kazakh language redoubled. In 2005 Bulat Sultanov was appointed the Director of the KazISS, who converted his extensive diplomatic experience into a broader cooperation of the institute with foreign research and analytical institutions. The KazISS established partnership relations with the number of European, primarily German structures, namely the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), the Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES), George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies. The cooperation of the KazISS expanded and included Asian partners in China (Shanghai Institute for International Studies), India (Jawaharlal Nehru University) as well as Russia (the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, the Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation). On April 11, 2014 KazISS was relocated in Astana by the decree of the president of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. On October 16, 2014 Erlan Karin has been appointed director of KazISS by the order of the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. On the same day president signed a decree according to which institute will plan their activities on the current and future objectives from the president, the head of the Presidential Administration of the Republic of Kazakhstan and its relevant deputy, and will work under the general direction of the Presidential Administration of the Republic of Kazakhstan and operational management of the relevant Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

The history of the Jews in Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, in India, began in the late eighteenth century when adventurous Baghdadi Jewish merchants originally from Aleppo and Baghdad chose to establish themselves permanently in the emerging capital of the British Raj. The community they founded became the hub of the Judeo-Arabic speaking Baghdadi Jewish trading diaspora in Asia. In the early nineteenth century the community grew rapidly, drawing mostly on Jewish migrants from Baghdad and to a lesser extent on those from Aleppo. Historically it was led by a flourishing merchant elite trading in cotton, jute, spices and opium issued from the leading Jewish families of Baghdad and Aleppo. Mercantile Baghdadi Jewish families based in the city tied together through bonds of marriage or commerce the smaller Baghdadi Jewish communities trading across Asia including in Rangoon, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai with the larger Jewish communities in Mumbai and the Middle East. During the late nineteenth century Kolkata was a minor intellectual centre of Iraqi Jews before the Baghdadi Jews began to slowly transition from a Judeo-Arabic identity towards a more Judeo-British and one under the leadership of the mercantile Sassoon, Ezra, Elias, Gubbay, Belilios and Judah families. In their heyday such mercantile Kolkata Jews sponsored numerous leading religious and charitable institutions in Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq. During the mid twentieth century the Baghdadi Jewish community peaked at over 6,000 members during the Second World War as smaller communities fled Japanese invasions or internments. This highpoint was followed by a precipitously decline in numbers. The community largely emigrate after Indian independence in 1947, leaving overwhelmingly to London and to a lesser extent Israel. This migration followed the turmoil of partition, the breakdown of the colonial trading system in Asia, severing historic trade flows between the Middle East and Asia, and the birth of a Jewish state in Palestine. The few remaining adopted a Judeo-Indian identity and achieved prominent positions in the military, politics and the arts. In the early twenty-first century fewer than twenty Jews remain in the city with their descendants today concentrated in the Jewish communities of Britain, Australia and in Israel. The synagogues that remain are some of the last surviving and presently accessible heritage sites founded by Iraqi Jews. Today, especially in the United Kingdom, to which the wealthier Baghdadi Jewish families were drawn, Jews tracing roots to Kolkata now enjoy prominence in British culture and media.  Early history  During the British rule in India, Kolkata was a thriving metropolis, the capital of British India and the commercial hub of India. It attracted numerous trading communities including the Jews. The first recorded Jewish immigrant to Kolkata was Shalom Aharon Obadiah Cohen, who arrived in Kolkata in 1798. Cohen was born in Aleppo in present-day Syria in 1762. He arrived in Surat in the year 1792 and established himself as a trader before moving to Kolkata. In 1805, his nephew Moses Simon Duek Ha Cohen arrived in Kolkata. He married his eldest daughter Lunah. In the early nineteenth century the Baghdadi Jews began to settle in large numbers in Kolkata, thus outnumbering the Jews from Aleppo. The community grew rapidly, in terms of both size and prestige, as Jews from Iraq fled the persecution of the rule Dawud Pasha (1817-1831) in what was then a province of the Ottoman Empire, including many of the most illustrious families of Baghdad. The Iraqi Jews, mostly from Baghdad, soon outnumbered the original settlers from Aleppo. By the end of the nineteenth century the Kolkata community numbered some 1,800 people.  Culture  Throughout its heyday the Baghdadi Jewish community was dominated by its leading families including the Ezras, Elias, Judahs, Sassoons, Belilios and Musleahs. These leading families intermarried over the generations. The Ezra family was the dominant family in the Baghdadi Jewish community for much of its history and much of the communal political history of the Baghdadi Jews of Kolkata revolved around the acceptance or opposition to their dominance. However this merchant elite whose firms amassed fabulous wealth, employed a great many of the Baghdadi Jewish community, whilst running the community's religious institutions and funding its charitable system, numbered less than forty families. The rest were shopkeepers, pedlars, brokers, artisans, factory workers or clerks. As a rule the community stuck to trade, finance and commerce with relatively few of the Baghdadi Jewish community entered either government service or the professions. As many as fifty percent of the Baghdadi Jewish community of Kolkata was poor and dependent on communal Jewish charity. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the grand merchant families who formed the nucleus of the Baghdadi Jewish community travelled widely building their fortunes across the Middle East and Asia. They continuously strove to maintain a balance between embracing the European culture that characterized the mostly British elite upper class to which they aspired, and a steadfast fidelity to their ancestral faith and traditions. They expressed their devotion to Jewish traditions through the sponsoring of elaborate synagogues, religious seminaries, ritual scrolls and books across Asia and the Middle East. Nevertheless, the identity of the community evolved. The first generation of Jewish settlers in Kolkata in the early 19th century spoke Judeo-Arabic at home and adhered to their Arabic style of costumes in public. Slowly and unevenly this began to change as their the second generation of Jews born in Kolkata adopted European dress and lifestyle and English as their language of communication. By 1906 it was recorded that as amongst the wealthier Jews in their habits and dress were European though their vernacular remained Arabic. Amongst lower social classes older generations retained Arabic style of dress while younger generations had adopted the European one. Their identities evolved too from a Judeo-Arabic identity towards a Judeo-British one. The Calcutta home of Moise Abraham Sassoon, in the early 20th century. One of the grand residences of the Baghdadi Jewish merchant elite. Kolkata in the late nineteenth century was a minor centre of Iraqi-Jewish intellectual production with numerous Judeo- Arabic newspapers, closely covering events in Baghdad and the Middle East, with books in Hebrew ans Judeo-Arabic printed in Kolkata. In the early twentieth century intellectual production in Kolkata declined with as Judeo- Arabic cultural production declined. A new wave of English language and Zionist orientated newspapers and clubs flourishing in the mid twentieth century before Indian Independence. Middle class and poorer Jews were the ones drawn to Zionism and its new popular community associations. Throughout the closing decades of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century the community grew more British-orientated in cultural habits, dress and aspirations. However the Baghdadi Jews of British India, including Kolkata, were denied the legal inclusion as Europeans during British rule.In 1885, the Baghdadi Jews were reclassified as from the government from European to native. It has been argued their late arrival in India and pale skin, as well as social habits and styles of dress, had seen them initially classified as European. The community was horrified to discover in 1885 their schools were no longer classified as European. For the remainder of British rule the Baghdadi Jews struggled to be recognised as European. They sought exemption from the 1878 Indian Arms Act which forbade natives from carrying arms but were not successful. They sought to be moved from the non-Muslim native electorate to the European electoral roll in 1929 and 1935 for elections to the Bengal Legislative Council, but were not successful. Many were resentful that the British would not socialise with them or permit them membership of the whites-only clubs that elite life in colonial Kolkata revolved around or shared a sense the British were conquerors who ignored the Jews. The intellectual leadership of the Kolkata community amongst the Baghdadi Jewish community in Asia and its higher educational level can be noted in the fact that of all the memoirs written of Indian Baghdadi Jewish almost all were written by members of the Kolkata community.  Emigration  Following Indian Independence majority of the Baghdadi Jewish population began to rapidly emigrate to London, to where the richer Baghdadi Jewish merchant families had been drawn for a generation. The community was deeply affected by the Great Kolkata Killing of 1946 that saw 4,000 killed and 100,000 made homeless in seventy-two hours of Hindu-Muslim communal violence. Rioting between 1945 and 1947 also killed numerous Europeans. Scenes of devastation that unsettled the Baghdadi Jewish community included vultures feasting on piles of human remains in the streets of Kolkata. Both the extreme violence of Indian Partition between Hindus and Muslims and the Bengal Famine witnessed during World War Two frightened the Baghdadi Jewish community and led them to believe there was no future for them in the city. Mass emigration began in a moment of extreme economic dislocation. In the space of a few years the transnational colonial trading system in which they had prospered was dismantled. In India, new economic regulations enacted by the Indian Government restricted imports and controlled foreign exchange, seriously hampering the business of the Baghdadi Jewish merchants families which led the community. The merchant elite families emigrated rapidly as there was talk of the imposition of socialism and the nationalization of banks and they felt emigration was essential to secure their wealth. They are unsure whether they would be soon stop being able to take money out of the country. The emigration of the wealthier families saw their businesses close and since they employed other Baghdadi Jews those too began to seek jobs abroad. The atmosphere in Calcutta at independence, rocked by Hindu-Muslim riots as millions were displaced and hundreds of thousands died across the country in partition was unsettled. The Japanese invasion of China, Burma and Singapore has already seen a mass flight of the Baghdadi Jews settled there to Kolkata. Many of these were able to secure refugee status in the United States. Within a few years of Indian Independence a sequence of political explosions closed their historic markets. These including the communist takeover in China, the mass flight of Iraqi Jews to the new state of Israel, the collapse of the Dutch East Indies and successive nationalist revolutions in Iraq, Syria and Egypt. This crippled many firms as effectively the Indian Ocean trading system had ceased to be. Emigration of Baghdadi Jewish business owners was soon followed by those they employed. Most Baghdadi Jews felt they now had to choose which citizenship to choose. From 1947 to 1952, all those living in India still held British Indian passports. Consequently, all those Indians who wanted to emigrate and could afford the fare left India. By 1951 only 1,500 Jews remained in Kolkata. The wealthier Baghdadi Jewish merchant families from Kolkata with ties to the British establishment and the Sassoon family settled in West London where they soon formed the majority of the historic Spanish and Portuguese Jews Congregation in Maida Vale. Those less wealthy settled in Golders Green in North London. By the early 1960s Golders Green had become home to a larger Baghdadi Jewish diaspora from Shanghai, Burma, India and Singapore who founded numerous small synagogues following the Mizrahi Jewish rite. By the end of the 1950s there were more Kolkata Jews in Golders Green than in Kolkata at the time. There was also a great desire in the Baghdadi Jewish community to settle in Australia but following 1948 the country secretly implemented an immigration policy excluding Jews from the Middle East and Asia from settling in the country frustrating Baghdadi Jews from emigrating there. However, in the early 1950s the Baghdadi Jews alongside other minority populations in India were granted the right to migrate to Australia as the White Australia immigration policy was progressively dismantled. This saw considerable Baghdadi Jewish emigration from Kolkata to Australia. It has been estimated a third of the Baghdadi Jewish community of Kolkata eventually settled in Sydney in Australia with the remainder not departing to Britain settling in Israel. Despite support and interest in Zionism in Kolkata before World War Two relatively few of the Baghdadi Jews from Kolkata eventually settled permanently in Israel. Baghdadi Jews from India settled in concentration in Ramat Eliyahu, Ashdod and the Kurdani neighborhood near Haifa and in across Israel's major cities. Broadly those that did settle in Israel did not maintain a communal identity but merged with the wider Iraqi Jewish community. Those that stayed in India embraced new Judeo-Indian identities in the new state. However, in the Kolkata the Jewish population had shrunk to 700 people by 1969. The mass refugee influx and a sharp rise in radical left politics had further unsettled West Bengal. The 1960s saw further communal riots and the Congress Party lose power in 1967 to the United Left Front, the first of a series of hard left alliances to govern West Bengal, which remained in power for the rest of the twentieth century. The late 1960s saw the renaming colonial legacy companies and families depart as the left wing government severely impacted trade. Against this background the rich fabric of community institutions and charitable support networks unravelled with the departure of the remains of the merchant family elite. The closing of the B.N. Elias mills in 1973 deprived many Baghdadi Jews of jobs and formed one of the final blows to the Jewish community in the city. Without the historic leadership and charity of the merchant families communal life became hard to maintain. Barely 200 Jews remained by the mid-1990s. Lack of opportunities for both business, high quality education and in particular for Jewish marriages in Kolkata speeded up the community's dissolution in the late twentieth century. By the early twenty-first century less than twenty Jews remained in the city.  Synagogues  Magen David Synagogue in Kolkata Interiors in Magen David Synagogue, Kolkata Genizah at Jewish Cemetery, Kolkata The Jewish community established five independent synagogues in Kolkata, out of which regular prayers are only heard in one. The first synagogue, now known as the Old Synagogue, was built by Shalome David Cohen. One of the pivotal figures in building the synagogue of Kolkata was Ezekiel Judah. Ezekiel Judah was an esteemed talmudist who led the Baghdadi Jewish community in Kolkata in spiritual matters during his lifetime, building two synagogues. He was a leading indigo merchant who traded in silks and muslins. A descendant of Solomon Ma‚Äôtuk his family name was seen as highly aristocratic amongst Iraqi Jews. One of his sons by his first wife was a leader of the Jews in Baghdad. Another son conducted a Yeshiva in Jerusalem founded by Ezekiel Judah at which ten scholars constantly studied the Torah and recited prayers. For a year after Ezekiel Judah's death, his sons invited scholars from Jerusalem, Syria and Baghdad as well as the poor of Calcutta to study the Torah. In 1825, Ezekiel Judah built the Neveh Shalom Synagogue on Canning Street. It was rebuilt in 1911. In 1856, Ezekiel Judah and David Joseph Ezra built the Beth El Synagogue on Pollock Street. It was rebuilt and extended in 1886 by Elias Shalom Gubbay. In 1884, Elias David Joseph Ezra built the Magen David Synagogue in memory of his father David Joseph Ezra. Along with Ezekiel Judah this construction made the other pivotal figures in building the synagogues of Kolkata were the Ezra family, both David Joseph Ezra and his son Elias David Joseph Ezra. The Ezra family were seen as one of the preeminent Baghdadi Jewish merchant families in the city in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The name Ezra was seen as a highly aristocratic name amongst Iraqi Jews. Today the three surviving synagogues of Kolkata were restored in the early twentieth-first century and are unique in being some of the few surviving currently accessible synagogues built by Iraqi Jews. Two further synagogues formerly existed but have not survived as part of Kolkata's Jewish heritage. The smaller Magen Aboth, dating back to 1897, is now demolished and Shaare Rason, dating to 1933, is now closed. Jewish cemetery The Jewish cemetery in Kolkata is located on 45, Narkeldanga Main Road in Kolkata (zip code 700011). The first recorded death in the Kolkata Jewish community was Moses de Pas, an emissary from Safad, now in Israel, who died in 1812 in Kolkata.

It consisted of a gravel runway and a simple small building as a terminal. Plans for an airport in Kj√∏llefjord were first launched in the mid-1960s. The bush airline Norving was the main proponent as they intended to operate an air taxi and air ambulance service. Construction started in 1973 and the airport opened in 1974. The same year the close-by and larger regional airport, Mehamn Airport opened and Kj√∏llefjord was only used sporadically. It became abandoned during the 1980s. History The first official proposals for an airport at Kj√∏llefjord were launched by a Finnmark County Municipality-appointed committee which in published a report in 1966. It recommended that six regional airport be built in Finnmark, including both Mehamn and Kj√∏llefjord. As Finnmark had lowest priority on the state-financed construction of regional airports, Norving took initiative to start construction of smaller and simpler airfields in select communities, including Kj√∏llefjord.Melling: 64 The airline therefore contacted the municipality in December 1969 and proposed that an airfield be built within a year, which it could operate with its Britten-Norman Islander aircraft.Melling: 65 The airline also looked into two other locations on Nordkinnhalv√∏ya, Mehamn and Gamvik.Melling: 66 When the Civil Aviation Administration started planning an airport for the area, it considered both Kj√∏llefjord, Mehamn and Gamvik as locations for the regional airport, deciding in the end to build at Mehamn.Lian: 91 Planning of the airport was started by A/L Kj√∏llefjord Flyplass in early 1973. Its first main task was to raise funding.Melling: 107 In addition to donations from the community, Lebesby Municipality gave a NOK 1-million grant. Construction started in the summer of 1973, but an early winter forced completion to be delayed until early 1974. The airport opened the same year as the regional Mehamn Airport, located away. The construction of Mehamn Airport included upgrading the road from Mehamn to Kj√∏llefjord and Gamvik to all-year standards. The airfield was occasionally used for ambulance flights, although this was normally only done when Mehamn Airport was closed because of fog.Melling: 108 The airport received permission in 1978 to operate public flights. Norving applied for permission to operate taxi route flights, but this was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications because it would drain part of the catchment area of Mehamn Airport. Kj√∏llevik Airport became disused during the 1980s, although both the runway and terminal remain, in a dilapidated state. For a while it was used as a storage area during construction of a windmill park. Facilities The airport had a gravel runway. A simple shed was used as a terminal, which included waiting areas for passengers and radio equipment.

Previously, he served as head of the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC) office in Damascus, in addition to his work with al-Hayat, and as a senior writer for Forward Magazine in Damascus. Hamidi's work focuses on strategic issues in the Middle East, with special insight into Syria's internal and regional politics. He is also a Research Fellow and co-founder of the Syrian Studies Center at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. Hamidi is also a co-founder of the Arab Investigative Journalism Program (ARIJ).http://ipj.lau.edu.lb/outreach/2005/04_arij/amman.php Hamidi was married to writer and novelist Dima Wannous. Early life Hamidi was born in 1969 in Idlib Governorate. His father worked as a truck driver and died in a car accident when Hamidi was three years old and he grew up in poverty. In 1986, Hamidi was able to move to Damascus to study journalism at Damascus University through a government stipend. His English professor at the time, Abdullah Dardari, was also a correspondent for the London-based Arab daily al- Hayat. Dardari, who later became Deputy Prime Minister of Syria in 2005, helped Hamidi find work as a secretary at his al-Hayat bureau in Damascus. Career Hamidi replaced Dardari as al-Hayat correspondent when the latter left to work for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). His 1996 coverage of the Arab League Summit in Cairo and the US presidential election, was highly acclaimed and helped bring him to a prominent place between Syrian journalists. Hamidi also delved into the Kurdish issue, interviewing Abdullah √ñcalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Syrian authorities responded by suspending his journalism credentials but he continued to meet and interview Kurdish politicians, most of whom, like Jalal Talbani and Massoud Barzani, rose to power in Iraq after downfall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Hamidi also conducted interviews with high-profile Palestinian leaders including Fathi Shaqaqi, head of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine who was assassinated in Malta days after his interview with al-Hayat, his successor Ramadan Shalah, and Khaled Mashal, head of the political bureau of Hamas. As an independent correspondent his credentials have been suspended by the Syrian government several times. Hamidi's coverage of the Syrian-Israeli peace talks in Shepherdstown aroused significant controversy. His outline of ‚Äúthe working document‚Äù, appeared dangerously similar to the actual agreement. The Israeli press immediately pursued the story, saying that Hamidi had leaked the information on orders from the Syrians. The Syrian team, on the other hand, accused him of leaking it through information obtained from the Americans. The talks, code-named ‚ÄúMushroom Diplomacy,‚Äù were supposed to be strictly confidential and allowed to grow‚Äîsimilar to mushrooms‚Äîin darkness. Hamidi went on to cover the death of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and the subsequent inauguration of his son Bashar al-Assad as president. His coverage of the following period, known as the Damascus Spring, and his interviews with Syrian opposition figures earned him the reprimand of the Syrian government and his journalist credentials were suspended several times. In 2002 he reported on Syria's preparations for the Iraq War. The government accused him of spreading \\"false information\\" and he was arrested on 23 December 2002. He remained in solitary confinement until 25 May 2003 and was later acquitted in court in 2005.

Carpenter introduced the Western Australian College of Teaching Act 2004 which was passed by Parliament in June 2004. The purpose of the College was to enhance the status of the teaching profession and teachers and to administer the registration of teachers in Western Australia. The act requires a board of 19 members, nine to be appointed by the minister and ten to be elected by members. When WACOT was established in 2004 the minister appointed all 19 members with ten being temporary appointments until an election could be held, at some point in time after March 2006. The foundation chair of WACOT was Brian Lindberg, who later faced criticism for his decision to deregister teachers who had refused to pay their registration fee, despite acknowledging there was a teacher shortage at the time. In October 2006 the election of the board by members was declared void by the electoral commission after the discovery that the rules that governed the election were illegal. The WACOT board then rewrote the election rules and submitted them to Parliament, who found them unsatisfactory, resulting in an even longer election delay. In September 2007, about 1,600 teachers faced deregistration for refusing to pay membership fees. Many teachers were boycotting WACOT for their inability to hold an election or effectively represent teachers. The election was eventually held in December 2007 with the ten board members elected. By 2008, about 2,000 teachers were facing deregistration despite a teacher shortage for non-payment of their fees. the board of WACOT had held an extraordinary meeting and had agreed to deregister non-paying members. Complaints levelled at WACOT included lengthy delays in processing registrations, sending out multiple demands for payment despite payment having been made, teachers having no involvement in the board, the board failing to hold elections, poor value for the fees being paid and a poor level of service offered by the college. The executive director of WACOT, Dr Suzanne Parry, said \\"the majority of teachers whose registration had been cancelled should be able to be reinstated within a day of supplying their paperwork\\" and that \\"many teachers were confused about the difference between annual membership renewal and re-registration\\" to justify why schools would be left without teachers. WACOT was eventually dissolved in 2012 by Peter Collier following a litany of failures, and replaced with the Teacher Registration Board of Western Australia. Collier had remarked that the implementation of the TRBWA had been made necessary by the \\"high level of dissatisfaction among teachers in relation to the manner in which the registration process was being managed\\".

Film von Habiba Djahnine  Life  Djahnine was born in 1968 in Tizi Ouzou. In the nineties she was one of the prominent feminists in her country. Her sister was a feminist activist as well and until 1995 president of Thighri N'tmettouth (Women in Protest); she was killed by Muslim fundamentalists on February 15, 1995, during the Algerian Civil War (1991‚Äì2002).Prince Claus Fund (June 2012) Report from the 2012 Prince Claus Awards Committee Afrika Spotlight, Africa in the Picture 2008 The civil war divided the feminists into supporters of the Algerian army, and on the other hand those who opposed the cruelty of the central power. In the second decade of the 21st Century she replied on this era that she is not an activist anymore, however she still considers herself a feminist. Meanwhile, she holds a critical stand to the development of the feminist movement in former days, which she tries to catch in her films frequently.Le Monde (March 15, 2011) Habiba Djahnine, documentariste dans un pays sans cin√©ma Arab Shorts (2012) biography After the civil war many feminists changed their focus to culture. As Djahnine did, who was co-founder of Association Ka√Øna Cin√©ma, and in 2007 of Cin√©ma et M√©moire Association. Next to that she published the volume of poetry Outre-Mort (Beyond Death), wrote humoristic articles for French, and Algerian magazines and wrote a number of short stories. Since 2003 Djahnine is consultant and curator of several international film festivals, like Rencontres Cin√©matographiques de B√©ja√Øa where fifty to sixty new films are presented annually. It hosts space for the film industry for debate, networking and the exchange of knowledge. Next to this festival, she organized other initiatives like Arab Shorts for the German Goethe-Institut. In 2006 Djahnine returned to Algeria, where she looked back to the death of her sister and the political situation of that moment. One question that was occupying her was \\"Why was dialogue impossible?\\" This question was an important theme in her documentary Lettre √† ma soeur (Letter to my sister) that she issued one year later and, like her other productions, was issued outside of Algeria as well. In Lettre √† ma soeur she tries to refute violence to be a solution to social disputes. Her documentaries reveal factual facets of Algeria, its history and the consequences of it on its society. With her own atelier, B√©ja√Øa Doc, she offers film education to young Algerians with attention to all facets of the profession, like film history, production, distribution and film scripting. All students must complete a film on the life in their own community.

We still own photographs of ourselves together, when we were young. 'Een vreemde ervaring die Couperus verwerkte in de Stille Kracht', in De Telegraaf, 22 August 1987 In 1893 Louis Couperus received a letter from Oscar Wilde, in which he was complemented with his novel Noodlot; this book was translated into English by Clara Bell. As a result of the correspondence Elisabeth Couperus-Baud was asked to translate Wilde's book The Picture of Dorian Gray. 'Hoofdmomenten uit Louis Couperus' leven en werken', in De Sumatra Post, 26 February 1932 After her marriage to Louis Couperus, Couperus-Baud was active as a critic of her husband's work and made readable copies of his handwritings.

To her publisher, L.J. Veen, she wrote: everything you want (\\"Comme vous voulez\\"). De vrouw naast Louis Couperus, in the Algemeen Dagblad, 12 October 2001 In 1899 she wrote the first of what had to become a series of travel letters in the Dutch magazine Hollandia, however only one letter was published.

It is located on the east side of the Perkiomen Creek, which flows south into the Schuylkill River. The population was 1,318 at the 2010 census. It is served by the Harleysville post office with the zip code of 19438. The village of Woxall was originally known as Kroppestettel, which in Pennsylvania Dutch means Crowtown. The village was later named Mechanicsville. By the end of the eighteenth century, the town contained a hotel and restaurant, town hall, shoe shop, wheelwright, and 12 homes. The village kept the name Mechanicsville until 1888 when a post office was established. A new name needed to be selected for the post office because another Pennsylvania town had the same name. After much discussion, residents submitted the name Noxall, \\"Knocks All\\" to postal authorities. The name had been read on the side of a bar of a box of soap in the village store. Evidently, they misread the \\"N\\" for a \\"W\\" and approved the name Woxall for the post office. The Village of Woxall grew up near the Old Goshenhoppen Church, erected in 1744, where Lutheran and Reformed congregations met. With the arrival of the railroad in 1868, Salfordville, which prospered without railroad or trolley, grew around an old inn. By 1877, it contained a post office, general store, cigar factory, and 19 homes. Other villages include Bergey, known in 1893 as Branchville, and Salford, called Rudy in the early 1900s. These two villages, along with Woxall and Salfordville, were noted for their general stores that sold a variety of items including fine clocks, furniture, barrel molasses, and quilting thread. Woxall can be classified as a rural area, featuring agriculture fields, woods, and some housing developments which have been built since 2002.

He joined the Mexican Army in the summer of 1995, and served at the Presidential Guard assault battalion unit at some point in his military career until he resigned in 1999. After not finding a job, Vargas Garc√≠a was recruited to work as a lieutenant for Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, a drug trafficking organization, in 2005. He eventually became one of the leading members in Los Zetas until he was arrested along with a kidnapping ring in 2007. Criminal career Nabor Vargas Garc√≠a was born in Pachuca, Hidalgo on 12 July 1976. He joined the Mexican Army on 28 June 1995 but stepped down from active duty four years later on 1 July 1999, registering for the Army reserves. During his tenure in the Army, he had served at the Presidential Guard assault battalion. After being unemployed for at least six years, Vargas Garc√≠a was recruited by Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former leader of the drug trafficking organization known as the Gulf Cartel. Vargas Garc√≠a later became one of the leading lieutenants and founders of the cartel's former muscle, Los Zetas. During the late 1990s, several other members of the Mexican military deserted to form part of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, and were given better payments than in the Armed Forces. While working in Los Zetas, Vargas Garc√≠a commanded a group of Zeta members in the Mexican states of Campeche, Tabasco, and Chiapas. He was a pioneer in smuggling narcotics for Los Zetas through this region of southern Mexico, and was able to create a pathway for illegal goods flowing from Canc√∫n to Matamoros, Tamaulipas in the northeastern part of the country. Vargas Garc√≠a worked for the drug lords Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano and Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez after C√°rdenas Guill√©n was extradited to the United States. He also controlled human trafficking rings of illegal aliens from Central America. He was also involved in several kidnappings in Campeche, including the abduction of four syndicate leaders of a petroleum company. In March 2010, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) listed several drug traffickers, including Vargas Garc√≠a, on the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), which freezes all their assets in the U.S. and prohibits American companies from doing business with them. =Arrest= The extinct Federal Preventive Police (PFP), the SIEDO agency and Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR), along with Mexican soldiers and the Campeche state police, arrested Vargas Garc√≠a and 20 kidnappers of the Gulf Cartel in Ciudad del Carmen on 18 April 2007. Vargas Garc√≠a, alias Z-20 and El D√©bora, is currently imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (\\"Altiplano\\") in central Mexico. He had pending charges on drug trafficking, kidnapping, and for violating the Mexican federal law prohibiting the use of illegal weaponry. In fears of retaliation from organized crime, the sub attorney general of Campeche, Jorge Obrador Capellini, along with subdirector of security in the municipality, N√©stor Hern√°ndez Dom√≠nguez, including four policemen, resigned from their duties several days after the arrest of Vargas Garc√≠a. Exactly three months after the arrest on 18 July 2007, the municipal police chief of Ciudad del Carmen, Germ√°n Soto L√≥pez, was assassinated by unknown gunmen. His body was found dead by law enforcement with three gunshot wounds on his face inside a Chevrolet Tornado. The motives behind his death are unclear, but several local media outlets indicated that Soto L√≥pez's assassination may be linked to the arrest of Vargas Garc√≠a. Informant role After Vargas Garc√≠a was arrested, he became an informant for the Mexican authorities, and confessed several aspects of the logistics structure in Los Zetas. He explained to the authorities that Los Zetas employed a project called La Expansi√≥n, which meant in the insides of the criminal underworld when several members of Los Zetas would go into a city and establish smuggling routes, and control or kill off opposition groups. The second phase of this process was known as La Contracci√≥n, when they would set up networks of radiocommunication in an area, organize safe houses, and call on gunmen to protect specific places. He also confessed in 2007 that the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas had several training camps in the states of Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas, where their members would learn how to use assault rifles and received military training. This training intended to keep gunmen at a top level to ensure that the top leaders of the criminal organization were protected, secure drug shipments, and eliminate potential threats from rival gang members. Kingpin Act sanction On 24 March 2010, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Vargas Garc√≠a under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with fifty- three other international criminals and ten foreign entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from engaging in any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. See also *Mexican Drug War Sources =References= =Bibliography= * Category:1976 births Category:Mexican mob bosses Category:Los Zetas Category:Living people Category:Mexican prisoners and detainees Category:People from Pachuca Category:People sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act Category:Founding members of Los Zetas ","title":"Nabor Vargas Garc√≠a"},{"id":"38343489","text":"The Union Professional League was a professional baseball league that played for less than two months in 1908. The league was founded by businessman Alfred Lawson (1869‚Äì1954), who had briefly pitched for the Boston Beaneaters and the Pittsburgh Alleghenies in the National League (founded 1876) in 1890; he would later become known for his philosophy known as Lawsonomy and for his success in the aviation business. History The league was established in December 1907. Lawson had founded an outlaw baseball league before the 1907 season; he called it the Atlantic League, a name also used by multiple other eastern leagues in baseball history. Lawson took three Atlantic League teams with him when he founded the Union Professional League. The final list of teams included clubs from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Newark, New Jersey; Elizabeth, New Jersey; Paterson, New Jersey; Brooklyn, New York; Washington, DC; Wilmington, Delaware; Reading, Pennsylvania and Baltimore, Maryland. Lawson decided to run the new league without utilizing a salary cap, multi-year contracts or a reserve clause. To keep players from contract jumping, Lawson intended to withhold a large amount of each player's weekly salary until the end of the season. Biographer Jerry Kuntz wrote that sportswriters \\"dubbed the effort the 'Onion League,' because it was cheap and smelled bad.\\" Play opened in late April 1908 and the league ran into problems almost immediately. The entire east coast was dealing with frequent rain. The Washington club, for example, experienced nine rainouts in May, with six of them occurring in a nine-day stretch. This, combined with the fact that the league had not attracted star players from the established leagues, contributed to poor attendance and low revenue. As players sometimes went unpaid, they began to leave the league. The league folded in June of its inaugural season.

The use of popular music in the classroom was unusual in Germany at the time. In 1998 the principals formed a publishing house, which subsequently became known as Lugert Verlag. The firm later diversifie, producing magazines and audio media and selling musical instruments. Forte, their score-writing program, was first released in 2005. Functionality The program can import MIDI, MusicXML and karaoke files, as well as the CapXML file format of the Capella notation program, and can export songs in MIDI and MusicXML formats for sharing with other tools such as the open-source MuseScore and LilyPond programs. It also allows users to save music scores as JPEG, TIFF or EPS files. Three of its tools include the Music Ruler, which allows users to enter notes; the audio sequencer, which allows users to record or import audio and play it in conjunction with their composition; and the complex scores, which allows users to write elaborate pieces. Recent versions of the program feature the ability to automatically transpose notated music among various keys, while their ScanScore 2 module performs optical music recognition on medium- to high-resolution PDF, JPEG, TIFF or PNG files of music score images, generating reasonably accurate MusicXML input for further processing within the main Forte program; this feature, however, is only available in the company's Premium edition.FORTE 11 and ScanScore 2 ‚Äì Sheet Music Digitized, 6 Nov. 2019, ScanScore.

After being nominated for an Academy Award, the film was released along with all the other 15 Oscar- nominated short films in theaters by ShortsHD.  Plot  The film is a retelling of Adam and Eve's story (as found in the first three chapters of the Book of Genesis) from Dog's point of view. Dog is shown in the Garden of Eden, exploring its environment and encountering various animals. Its doggy nature is revealed in various scenes from territory marking to barking at a passing mastodon to attempting to befriend a lemur. One day in the savanna, it encounters the newly created Adam who is also exploring Eden. Adam feeds Dog some grains, pets it and moves on. The next day, Adam is high up on a tree, interacting with a bird, when Dog sees him again. Adam tosses down a fruit to Dog and climbs down. He is surprised that Dog is fascinated by the branch (now stripped of fruit) he is holding. When he throws the branch away, Dog fetches it back. Dog is excited when Adam (who knows all animal languages) barks like it. They become friends and explore Eden together. One day, Dog sees Adam with a new creature, Eve with long red hair. Dog attempts to interest Adam in a game of fetch but Adam throws the stick extremely far away in order to get rid of Dog. When Dog returns with the stick, Adam and Eve are gone. Dog waits all day for him to return. At night, Dog (with stick) wanders Eden and sees a panther with a dead rabbit in its mouth. It starts to rain. Dog then sees Adam and Eve, wearing clothes, running through the forest. He chases after them, barking joyously but when Adam turns around, his face is so distorted and sinister, Dog runs away terrified. Other animals also flee them. Adam and Eve stop and stand facing away from each other. They look ashamed, dejected and alone. The next day, Adam and Eve emerge from Eden and enter a bleak desert. They are clothed in rough animal fur. Dog sees them leave, takes a step out of Eden, pauses and then returns to Eden. It then dashes out with the stick in its mouth and runs towards them. In the last scene, Dog lays the stick at a surprised Adam's feet. Adam kneels down and pets Dog and tells Eve who Dog is. Eve kneels down in front of Dog and hugs and kisses it. Adam and Eve walk off together. They are holding hands and so close they seem like one person. Dog walks right by their side.

Plot Sultan Darsjah Alam (Astaman) is the beloved leader of a prosperous eastern kingdom. The sultans of neighbouring kingdoms, jealous of this prosperity, connive and conspire to cause his downfall. However, Darsjah Alam remains focused on his own kingdom and is protected by a magical ring. However, prophecy foretells that, if the ring is lost, disaster will strike. In the heavens live three goddesses, the sisters Laila Kesoema, Koemala Djoewita, and Ratna Moetoe Manikam (Ratna Asmara). Though Ratna and Laila get along well and want only to bring blessings to the earth, the brash Koemala has different intentions. Ratna and Koemala soon come into conflict over Darsjah Alam. Koemala attempts to woo Darsjah Alam, who - sensing that she does not love him - rejects her advances. In response, Koemala plots to send demons and jinns to destroy his kingdom. Laila overhears Koemala's scheming and tells Ratna, who in turn consults the elder god Batara Guru. He refuses to intervene, instead saying that Koemala's attack would be a test of Darsjah Alam's faith. On Earth, Darsjah Alam is playing sepak raga in his courtyard when his ring is pulled off his finger by an unseen force. Shocked by this event, Darsjah Alam goes to the lakeside to meditate whilst the minister and palace staff chase after his ring. Upon arriving, Darsjah Alam sees a swan and hears a disembodied voice tell him to take it by the mouth. When he does so, the swan transforms into Ratna, who returns the sultan's ring and offers herself as his bride, should he accept her three conditions: he may not ask her name, origin, or lineage. Darsjah Alam agrees, and the two are married. A year passes, and Darsjah Alam and Ratna have their first son, Bahroel Alam. As the kingdom prepares for an enormous celebration, Koemala - jealous of her sister's happy life - plans to disrupt the festivities. She transforms one of her servants into a human sultan named Indraboemi, who travels to the palace with his entourage. He spreads discord among the royal guests and palace staff; as the son of the sultan and an unknown woman, he says, Bahroel Alam lacks the heritage to be a proper sultan. After the guests leave, Darsjah Alam goes to Ratna and asks who she is and where she came from. Ratna takes him to the lakeside, where she answers his questions then disappears. Darsjah Alam is soon taken to the land of the jinns, where Koemala takes him and casts him into a fire, turning him into a sheep. Indraboemi, meanwhile, is sent back to the palace to reign in Darsjah Alam's place. As his first act, he has a minister take Bahroel Alam away. On his journey abroad, the minister meets Laila, who is passing as a human woman. They live in the forest for eighteen years, raising Bahroel Alam as if he were a poor boy. One day, while searching for fruit, Bahroel Alam discovers an overgrown palace, where he meets an old woman. She tells him that he is the son of the true sultan and sends him on his way, giving him an arrow in parting. Upon arriving home, Bahroel Alam throws the arrow at a passing sheep, having been overcome with a sudden urge. The sheep transforms into a dead Darsjah Alam. The old woman whom Bahroel Alam had met earlier comes and sprinkles flower petals over his body, bringing him back in life. The old woman then reveals herself as Ratna and says that the people are again in need of Darsjah Alam. Laila, having returned to the heavens, rains down an army to help Bahroel Alam take control of the palace. Upon their arrival, Indraboemi flies into the sky to escape, higher than Bahroel Alam can fire his arrows. Ratna thus grants the young man the power of flight, allowing him to chase after Indraboemi and slay him. Meanwhile, in the heavens, Laila fights and defeats Koemala. Darsjah Alam is reinstated as sultan to much rejoicing. Production Ratna Moetoe Manikam was directed by Sutan Usman Karim, under the pseudonym Suska. He had worked as an editor for the Padang-based daily Persamaan, and had directed Panggilan Darah (1941) for Oriental Film before joining The Teng Chun's New Java Industrial Film (JIF). The's company produced the film Ratna Moetoe Manikam. Inspired by the success of The Thief of Bagdad (1940), Suska realised that a modernised version of a classic story could be successful. He therefore adapted the plot for Ratna Moetoe Manikam from a stage drama entitled Djoela Djoeli Bintang Tiga, a staple of stamboel stage performances. The film starred Ratna Asmara, Astaman, Ali Joego, and Inoe Perbatasari. Ratna Asmara and Astaman shot their roles film concurrently with Andjar Asmara's Noesa Penida. Hajopan Bajo Angin handled artistic direction. Release According to director Tan Tjoei Hock, filming was interrupted by the Japanese occupation in early 1942; the Japanese forces closed all local production houses, including New JIF. Tan reportedly finished filming the work by order of the Japanese overlords. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that it was released during the occupation, which lasted until 1945, but he does not specify a year. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

It is also the third-deadliest nightclub fire in history, behind the Luoyang Christmas fire and the Cocoanut Grove fire in 1942. Incident Santa Maria The party, called \\"Aglomerados\\", organized by students from six universities and technical courses at the Federal University of Santa Maria, began on Saturday, 26 January 2013 at 23:00 UTC. Two bands were scheduled to perform that night (\\"Pimenta e seus comparsas\\" and \\"Gurizada Fandangueira\\"). In the early morning hours of 27 January 2013, a fire broke out while students from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) were holding a freshers' ball. A stampede occurred following the fire, and a lack of exit signs and emergency exits allegedly contributed to the deaths. Most of the victims were between 18 and 30 years old. Witnesses have said either a flare or fireworks lit by band members may have started the fire. Brazilian police stated that the fire began when the band Gurizada Fandangueira ignited a pyrotechnic device (similar to a signaling flare) while performing on stage. The flare then ignited flammable acoustic foam in the ceiling. According to the authorities, other reasons for the high death toll include the lack of emergency exits (the only access in and out of the building was the front door) and the fact that the number of people inside exceeded the maximum capacity by hundreds. About 90% of the victims succumbed to smoke inhalation. Many people died as they either tried to hide in bathrooms or, in panic mistook them for exits. At least 180 bodies were removed from the bathrooms. More than 150 were injured by the crush at the front door and the rapidly accumulating smoke within the nightclub. 14 injuries were attributed to severe burns caused by flames, with eight victims succumbing to their injuries in the days and weeks following the incident. More than 90 people were hospitalized. Colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo of the Rio Grande do Sul Fire Department stated that the club's front door was locked. De Melo told CNN: \\"This overcrowding made it difficult for people to leave, and according to the information we have, the security guards trapped the victims inside.\\" The fire has the second-highest death toll for an entertainment event in Brazil; it is second only to the 1961 Niter√≥i circus fire, which killed more than 500 people. Investigation Illustration of the nightclub fire. Based on an investigation and the accounts of survivors, the cause of the fire was found to be an illegal firework device that ignited the acoustic foam on the ceiling. Two co-owners of the nightclub and two members of the band were arrested and questioned by police. One of the owners of the nightclub tried to commit suicide while still being treated at the hospital; however, one of the police officers guarding his room noticed the attempt and intervened. The state fire department found that the premises did not have enough emergency exits and was not authorized to use fireworks. The fire department, however, did issue a permit for the club to operate. The permit stated that the club had two emergency exits. The fact that false information was used by the club and approved by the fire department resulted in a state investigation of the authorities responsible for supervising the nightclub, including the city hall and the fire department itself. It was also reported that the fire extinguishers in the club may have been artificial or were disabled at the time. On 30 January, the nightclub's owner deflected blame to \\"the whole country\\", as well as to architects and inspectors who were commissioned with ensuring the building's safety, according to his lawyer. By that time, the death toll was at least 235.\\"Club Owner Faults Brazil, Officials in Deadly Fire\\", Express (Washington, D.C.), 31 Jan 2013, p. 6, citing AP sources.

Rousseff declared three days of official mourning. Santa Maria's city government established thirty days of official mourning.

Several morphologically distinct species are recognized.Kolesnikov A.V., Grazhdankin D.V. & Maslov A.V. (2012). ‚Äì Arumberia-type structures in the Upper Vendian of the Urals. ‚Äì Doklady Earth Sciences, 447 (1), 1233-1239.  Description  Initially discovered by Glaessner and Walter (1975), Arumberia was described as a problematic cupped- body fossil of an Ediacaran soft-bodied organism characterized by hollow compressible ribbed bodies composed of flexible tissue. Brasier (1979) deemed it a pseudofossil arising from turbid water flow in shallow marine or deltaic environments, due in part to physical and morphological similarities to flume- induced structures previously observed by Dzulynski and Walton (1965). Arumberia appears as a poorly-delimited series of fine parallel grooves arising from a single region or point. Arumberia banksii consists of an array of straight to gently curved parallel to subparallel ridges (rugae) about 1 ‚Äì 3 mm wide and separated by flat to gently concave furrows of 1 ‚Äì 7 mm in width. Relief from ridge top to furrow bottom is less than 1 mm. Ridge ranges in length from 1.5 cm to 14.5 cm. Generally the ridges are parallel, but they also bifurcate. Ridges are developed on plane and rippled surfacesPandey S.K., Kumar S. (December 2009). Note on the occurrence of Arumberia Banksi and associated fossils from the Jodhpur Sandstone, Marwar Supergroup, western Rajasthan. Journal of the Paleontological Society of India. 54 (2): 171‚Äì178..  List of Species  There are four species of Arumberia that have been formally recognized. Arumberia banksi has thin siliciclastic biolaminites known as rugose structures including those with subparallel or fanning-out series of rugae (Arumberia banksi s.str.) and sub-parallel series of branching rugae (Arumberia vindhyanensis). The Arumberia multykensis variety is found in greenish gray siltstones as series of near-parallel ridges with positive hyporelief up to 1 mm wide and 0.5 mm high, with 10 mm spacing between the ridges while A. usavaensis occurs as a series of near parallel ridges on the wavy surfaces on linguoid ripple marks which stretch along the paleoflow direction and flatten out as microterraces on the leeward side of the ripples. Arumberia usavensis is found on both upper and lower surfaces of sandstone beds as well as inside sandstones and siltstones. Arumberia beckeri and Arumberia ollii are morphologically distinct from A. banksi and are filamentous and ribbon-shaped compressed macrofossils which host authigenic clay minerals and are most likely unrelated to Arumberia.Kolesnikov, A.N.

Locations  Arumberia was first described in Neoproterozoic red sandstones of the lower Arumbera sandstone formation of the Amadeus Basin in Northern Territory, Australia. It has since been found in Argentina, Newfoundland, England, Wales, northeastern Europe, the eastern Sayan Mountains in Russia, Central India, and Rajasthan.Davies, N.S., A.G. Liu, M.R.

(April): 1‚Äì10. Available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep30590. Identity The identity of Arumberia is controversial. Arumberia has been originally interpreted as a 5‚Äì20 cm high cup-like organism, apparently composed of flexible tissue, attached to the sea bottom by a blunt apex or, later, as a colonial organism made of flexible, thin-walled tubes tightly joined together through their length. Affinities with Ernietta, Conostichus, Pteridinium, Palaeoplatoda, Phyllozoon and Bergaueria and Chuaria have been conjectured. Spheroidal objects found along with Arumberia have also been interpreted as \\"dispersable stage\\" of Arumberia itself. Arumberia has been interpreted as a microbial mat morphotype developed in response to environmental perturbations in terminal Ediacaran shallow marine basins Conversely, a non biological interpretation has been put forward Past experiments reproduced Arumberia-like traces from flume experiments and from the flux of water around small objects. The absence of Arumberia-like structures after the Ediacaran period could be due to the unique properties of the microbial mat that covered the sea floor at the period. However, there is still debate, with recent analysis of Urals' Arumberia-like structures leaning towards a biological interpretation as an organism adapted to shallow water environments. The rugae of Arumberia are considered to form from exclusively biological processes as observed in modern microbial mats and not from sediment desiccation, cracking or other abiotic processes. Fine wisps of organic material have been observed in thin section of Arumberia cut perpendicular to bedding planes, further suggesting that Arumberia was a living organism. Recent work describes Arumberia as the fossilized remains of highly organized shallow marine microbial colonies;Kolesnikov A.V., Marusin V.V., Nagovitsin K.E., Maslov A.V. & Grazhdankin D.V.(2015). ‚Äì Ediacaran biota in the aftermath of the Kotlinian Crisis: Asha Group of the South Urals. ‚Äì Precambrian Research, 263, 59-78. a microbially-induced sedimentary structure (MISS),;Gehling J.G.

Jolivet, and I. Dmitri. 2017. An introduction to the special issue of the BSGF: Insights into the geology and paleontology of Siberia from French-Siberia. BSGF - Earth Sci. Bull.: 1‚Äì8. However, an alternative interpretation of the Ediacaran facies where Arumberia is found is that they were coastal gyspiferous paleosols of intertidal to supratidal settings. Terminal Ediacaran (560 Ma) facies in Baltica dominantly contain biomarkers (hopane and sterane ratios) characteristic of bacterially-dominated communities in shallow marine oligotrophic settings. These values reflect a high ratio of bacterial to eukaryotic biomass and suggest these ecosystems were nutrient-limited and dominated by bacterial communities, which may have imposed growth constraints and evolutionary modifications to Ediacaran organisms like Arumberia. = Burial Compaction and Diagenesis= The original interpretation of Arumberia as a conical or cup-shaped depression structure is contrary to modern interpretations of Arumberia as a bulge or impression. Extensive burial from overburden typical in areas where Arumberia is found would greatly compact any bulge or depression of a typical soft-bodied marine metazoan; however, it has been suggested that diagenic silicification, ferrugination or pyritization can provide critical fossil rigidity during burial Tarhan, L.G., Hood, A.S., Droser, M.L., Gehling, J.G., And Briggs, D.E.G., 2016,Exceptional preservation of soft-bodied Ediacara biota promoted by silica-rich oceans: Geology, v. 44, p. 951‚Äì954, doi:10.1130/G38542.1Mapstone, N.B. and McIlroy, D., 2006, Ediacaran fossil preservation: taphonomy and diagenesis of a discoid biota from the Amadeus Basin, central Australia: Precambrian Research, v. 149, p. 126‚Äì148, doi:10.1016/j.precamres.2006.05.007. which supports the soft-body marine metazoan description of Arumberia.

Analysis of thin sections of Arumberia show remarkable resistance to compaction, which may have been due to the presence of a pyrite sole-veneer. The diagenetic oxidation of pyrite to hematite can remove all traces of the pyrite sole-veneer, so it is difficult to determine the true influence of pyritization on burial compaction in Arumberia. Alternatively, the remarkable resistance to burial compaction may be due to the presence of a resistant biopolymer like chitin which is typical in marine and terrestrial lichens alike Exactly how the fossils are preserved remains controversial, and more research into the taphonomy of Arumberia and other Ediacarans is needed.

Bates' first appearance on Chinese television was during the 2010 Chinese Bridge language contest, in which he received first prize and the eloquence prize. The show aired in front of a TV audience of almost 300 million. Bates has gone on to present TV shows for the Discovery Channel and has founded several companies in China. In 2017, Bates made the Forbes 30 under 30 list. Early life Liam Bates was born in the canton of Vaud outside Geneva, Switzerland to an American mother and a British- Zimbabwean father. At school he spoke French. He later went on to study Chinese and film at the University of British Columbia in Canada. Television career Following Bates' Chinese Bridge success in September 2010 he joined The Travel Channel China as their newest host, where he began a regular travel series filmed throughout the Chinese countryside. His first shows focused on rural life in Hunan, Guizhou and other Chinese provinces. Each show had Bates spending a week living with farmers and learning about their local cultures. In 2011 Bates and 'The Travel Channel China' team spent two weeks in his home country of Switzerland, filming several aspects of Swiss life: chocolate- making, Alpine cowherding and cheese production, Swiss military. The resulting television show broke numerous records in China, with the first 30-minute episode registering 1.5 million views on video-sharing website Youku alone. Bates became more widely known in China than in his home country. In early 2012 Bates began a new series, A Love for Adventure (ÊàëÁà±Â§ßÂÜíÈô©) and the Last Tribe (ÊúÄÂêéÁöÑÈÉ®ËêΩ). In this show, he travelled around the world seeking out small tribes who have maintained their traditional lifestyles in order to learn their survival techniques. In 2016 Bates completed filming of a new series for the Discovery Channel, \\"Expedition X: Silk Road Rising\\". Entrepreneur Bates started his first company in 2006 at 17 years old, Beijing-based Bridges to China. In 2014 Bates co-founded Kaiterra (formerly Origins Technology), a startup that develops IoT hardware and software products to measure global air quality and pollution levels. Kaiterra has raised an undisclosed amount from angel investors in an initial round of funding in January 2015. In April 2016, Kaiterra's consumer air quality monitor, the Laser Egg, entered the Apple Stores across China. In 2017, Bates and Kaiterra co-founder Jessica Lam were selected for the Forbes 30 under 30 list. Hangzhou Ambassador In May 2013 Bates was officially appointed tourism ambassador to the Chinese city of Hangzhou. Bates was awarded a $55,000/year contract to regularly visit and explore Hangzhou, sharing his experiences on social media under the title of the 'Modern Marco Polo'. This made him the first foreigner ever to be appointed by China's government in such an official role. Xiangsheng Bates was formally invited to begin the study of xiangsheng (a traditional form of \\"crosstalk\\" comedy) by famous Chinese comedian Ding Guangquan after his success in the Chinese Bridge contest. In February 2012, in a traditional ceremony at the Confucius Institute, University of Hawaii, he was formally accepted into the xiangsheng hierarchy when he took Ding Guangquan to be his Shifu. Today xiangsheng is still a large part of Bates' work, and he performs regularly on China Central Television. Other work Bates became known publicly through Chinese Bridge and his travel shows, but he gradually expanded into other activities, including hosting live events and leading outdoors/survival courses. His popularity as a performer and foreign personality on Chinese television has grown steadily: his Chinese micro-blog has grown to tens of thousands of registered followers in just two years.

He was the older brother of Abdullah al-Ghumari and Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari. As a child, he studied in Morocco's traditional madrasa system, memorizing the entire Qur'an, in addition to the traditional Islamic texts Alfiya, AjƒÅr≈´mƒ´ya and Bulugh al-Maram. In 1921, he traveled to Egypt and enrolled in Al-Azhar University, returning to Morocco upon the death of his father. Ghumari went to Egypt a second time in 1931 when his younger brothers Abdullah and Muhammad also enrolled in the university. Due to fears regarding activity of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, his brother Abdullah was sentenced to ten years in prison on accusations of ties to the group in 1961. Ahmad al-Ghumari, upon hearing the news of his younger brother's long sentence, fell ill and died eight months later. Career Ghumari authored more than one hundred books. He was well known for a debate which acrimoniously began between him and fellow hadith scholar Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani, and later continued with Ghumari's younger brother Abdullah and Albani.Muhammad Moin, \\"Ahmed Al-Ghumari on Al-Albani\\". Al-Sunnah: 8 March 2011. Despite the older Ghumari's attestation to Albani's high level of knowledge and respected status in Hadith studies, the nature of the debate between them became personal and involved character attacks. Like the rest of his family, Ghumari was a leader of the Siddiqiyya Sufi order,Abd al-Aziz al- Ghumari, Ma Yajuz wa ma la Yajuz fi al-Hayat al-Zawjiyyah, pg. 9. Amman: Dar al-Fath, 2009. a branch of the larger Shadhili order. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali claimed that al-Ghumari had chosen to live a very simple life and eschewed material excess.Hassan Kettani, Fiqh al-Hafizh Ahmad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari, pg. 58. Amman: Dar al-Bayariq, 2001. Jordanian National Library #2001/6/1146 Views Although a practitioner of Sufism, Ghumari criticized some Sufis, especially the rival Naqshbandi order.Gibril Haddad, The Ghumari School. 6 December 2002: Living Islam. Last updated 2 June 2003. Like Ibn Hazm, Ghumari viewed scholarly differences of opinion as wrong and he often used harsh language when responding to intellectual opponents. Having originally followed the Maliki school of thought like most of Muslim scholarship in Morocco, al-Ghumari later switched to the Shafi'i school for a period and finally opted for absolute independent reasoning.Hassan Kettani, Fiqh al-Hafizh, pgs. 61-62. Unlike most of Moroccan scholarship, al-Ghumari opposed the Ash'ari school of theology.Hassan Kettani, Fiqh al-Hafizh, pg. 62. Muhammad Abu Khubza, among other Moroccan scholars, also claim that al-Ghumari temporarily adhered to the Zaidiyyah school of Shia Islam.

Grants ;Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The School District applied to participate in 2006-07 and was denied funding by the PDE. In 2007-08, Harrisburg City School District applied again receiving $585,907. The district received $136,749 in 2008-09, for a total funding of $692,809. Among the public school districts in Cambria County, the highest award was given to Greater Johnstown School District which received $463,166. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell, as part of his 2009-10 state budget. ;Project 720 Project 720 was a high school reform program implemented for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth‚Äôs high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and to meet the needs of diverse learners.

Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Harrisburg City School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. According to the Center for Disease Control‚Äôs biannual national study of high school students in 2009, five percent of Pennsylvania students did not go to school for at least one day because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to or from school.

It is one of fourteen high schools in the Jefferson County School System. School colors are purple and white, and the athletic teams are called the Tenacious Tigers. Minor competes in AHSAA Class 6A athletics.  History  Minor High School was established to serve the communities of McDonald's Chapel, Edgewater, Mulga, Bayview, Minor Heights, Docena, Crumley Chapel, Sandusky, Hillview, Westwood, Adamsville, Cardiff, Forestdale, Graysville, and Brookside. On February 13, 1922,Meeting Minutes, Jefferson County Board of Education, 1918-1922 Minor High School, named for John W. Minor, opened to 95 students. Serving as principal was Mr. W. C. Petty. According to The Birmingham Post, Minor was the \\"pride and joy\\" of the Jefferson County Board of Education, costing $100,000 ($75,000 for the building and $25,000 for equipment). Minor's first full year of operation began on September 11, 1922. With a faculty of seven, Minor served grades nine through twelve and consisted of a 301-member student body. In addition, Minor also established its athletic program, fielding a football team, a girls' basketball team, and a tennis club the same year. In June 1923, Minor graduated its first class of fourteen seniors. Catastrophe struck at 6:30 a.m. on Friday, January 22, 1926 when a fire, originating in the chemistry laboratory, consumed the school and forced its temporary closure. Minor reopened its doors in 1927 after the main building was rebuilt. A gymnasium, extra classrooms, and a library were added later. From its first season in 1922, Friday night football was a community event, but because of inadequate facilities, most football games were played at the opponent's field. In 1953, through the efforts of the communities served, Minor built a lighted football field and stadium. A press box was later added in 1960. Minor experienced various expansions through the years: an office wing and classrooms in 1963, a lunchroom and band room in 1970, additional classrooms when Dixie Junior High School became available, and a new field house and gymnasium. These additions doubled the campus size. In the late 1980s, Minor faced the task of renovation. Instead of refurbishing the school's old building, the Jefferson County Board of Education decided to retire the old school and build a new facility that would expand the school to include the 9th grade. In September 1988, classes began in the new building located in Adamsville. In 1996, a new lighted stadium was built at the Adamsville site. The 2001-2002 school year opened with a new wing consisting of seventeen new classrooms and three science labs. The necessity of a second gymnasium was soon evident. In 2002-2003, a new practice gymnasium was added to the campus. Working in conjunction with Wal-Mart and the Jefferson County Commission, Minor High School is currently building several practice athletic fields with a projected use by the soccer, softball, and football teams as well as a secondary practice location for the band.  Student profile  Enrollment in grades 9-12 for the 2013-14 school year is 1,003 students. Approximately 85% of students are African-American, 13% are white, and 2% are Hispanic. Roughly 70% of students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. Minor has a graduation rate of 83%. Approximately 83% of its students meet or exceed state proficiency standards in mathematics, and 76% meet or exceed standards in reading. The average ACT score for Minor students is 20.  Athletics  Minor competes in AHSAA Class 6A athletics and fields teams in the following sports: * Baseball * Basketball * Football * Indoor Track & Field * Outdoor Track & Field * Soccer * Softball * Volleyball * Wrestling Minor won the state championship in boys' basketball in 1998.

It was formed in 2011 and ceased operating in 2014. Mid-Sea Express started as air charter operator and non-scheduled air taxi headquartered at Mactan-Cebu International Airport in Lapu-Lapu City in Central Visayas, in the Philippines. As Fil-Asian Airways, its slogan was \\"The Asian experience\\". The airline was operated from major airports such as Mactan-Cebu International Airport in Cebu, Francisco Bangoy International Airport in Davao City and Zamboanga International Airport. History =As Mid-Sea Express= thumb Mid-SEA Express (MSE) takes its name from the Middle of South East Asia, the region in which it operates and founded by Capt. Ronan D. Villanueva. MSE began operating as Island Helicopter Services, which was established in 2008. In 2011, after seeing the need to service the neighboring islands around Cebu, Mid-Sea Express began operating unscheduled air transportation, and acquired an aircraft with a Short Take-off and Landing Capability, an 8-seater BN-2A Islander. Starting a daily flight schedule from Cebu to Tagbilaran City, Bohol. A month later, Cebu‚ÄìBantayan Island was also opened. Then, it was successively followed by flights to Camiguin and Siquijor islands utilizing a 21-seater British Aerospace Jetstream 32EP aircraft. MSE also opened routes from Cebu to Tandag, Bislig, Guiuan, and vice versa, to serve foreign and local travelers, focusing solely on routes which were previously not serviced via air travel. In 2011, the Mid-Sea Express began operations for non-scheduled air transportation, initially covering Cebu- Tagbilaran as its launching route. It launched an 8-seater Britten-Norman Islander which proved convenient and affordable to passengers in terms of time and cost. Tagbilaran City is a short distance to Lapu-Lapu City. In the month following its launch, it began flights to Bantayan Island in northwestern Cebu. MSE also opened routes from Cebu to Tandag, Bislig, and Guiuan vice versa to serve foreign and local travelers. MSE solely serve routes which were not accessible via air travel. Mid-SEA Express (MSE) represents its name as Middle of South East Asia founded by Capt. Ronan D. Villanueva, that started its operation as Island Helicopter Services, that was established in the year 2008. After seeing the need to service the neighboring islands around Cebu, he acquired an aircraft with a Short Take-off and Landing Capability, a BN-2A Islander. Starting a daily flight schedule from Cebu to Tagbilaran City, Bohol, then a month after, Cebu‚Äì Bantayan Island was also opened. Then, it was successively followed by flights to Camiguin and Siquijor islands. The re- opening of this new routes has further developed its eco-tourism potential and further improved the access not only for the foreign tourist but also for the local Filipino communities. All these air services further boost tourist arrival and provide a faster convenient air access. Mid-Sea Express‚Äô vision of \\"Bridging the Island\\" has been achieved through their consistent adding of unserved routes to both Filipino citizens and foreign travelers alike. The goal of Mid-Sea Express was to further promote the tourism potential of smaller islands while still serving the routes and destinations that are in high demand. With the large and ever-increasing tourist demand in Bohol, the Cebu-Bohol flights are helping increase the island's chances of making a name among the world's travelers, just as Boracay recently did in a recent worldwide publication. MSE expanded its operation and added new routes to connect Cebu-Tagbilaran City, Bohol-Davao and Cebu-Bohol, Bohol-Cagayan de Oro, utilizing a 21-seater British Aerospace (BAE) Jetstream 32EP aircraft. With the increasing demand of passengers traveling to destinations solely served by MSE and with high demand of cargoes needed to be transported from far flung areas to main islands. By April 2012, the airline temporarily ceased its international operations as it prepared for the relaunch of flights under the new brand using a bigger aircraft to accommodate more passengers and cargoes at the same time. =As Fil-Asian Airways= In 2013, Mid-Sea Express re-branded itself to become Fil-Asian Airways under new management. The new airline is set to relaunch flights on old routes of Mid-Sea Express using bigger aircraft. On March 27, 2013, its first commercial flight as Fil-Asian Airways commenced between Zamboanga and Cebu. Closure In 2014, Fil-Asian Airways folded due to numerous operations issues including unpaid salaries of employees, non-payment of bills and recurring technical glitches on its lone aircraft due to wear and tear.

He was appointed simultaneously Home Minister and interim Education Minister in 1935 under the K≈çki Hirota administration. Ushio was selected for his opposition to the military, lack of political party ties and noted strength at bureaucratic innovation and reform, and for these same reasons his appointment came under criticism from many vested interests. In 1938, Ushio was made a member of the Privy Council, and in 1946 became the final Vice-Chairman of the Privy Council before that body was dissolved by order of the American occupation authorities. Ushio was chairman of a committee of thirteen councilors assigned to review and comment on the new post-war Constitution of Japan.Moore. Partners for Democracy, page 166 References * Moore, Ray. A.

She was the sister of theologian Carl Wulff Noack. In 1902 Noack went to Copenhagen where she earned a living painting porcelain at the Aluminia faience factory. She then attended Vallekilde Folk High School, specializing in sculpture and qualifying as an apprentice in 1910. She continued her studies there under Ivar Bentsen who exerted a considerable influence on her, together with other artists, especially Joakim Skovgaard, from the folk high school environment. In collaboration with Skovgaard, she helped to decorate the ceiling of Viborg Cathedral (1948) working as a wood carver. There she also met Niels Larsen Stevns and Arne Lofthus, both of whom encouraged her to work independently as a sculptor.Eske K. Mathiesen, \\"Astrid Noack\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon. Retrieved 27 January 2013. Period in Paris In 1920, on a grant, Noack went to Paris which at the time was the focus of the most significant trends in sculpture. She met Adam Fischer who played an important part in her development and in conveying French ideas to Scandinavia. She also befriended Lena B√∂rjeson who had founded the Acad√©mie Scandinave free school of sculpture which arranged exhibitions and informal instruction. She studied French Gothic sculpture with the French sculptor Jean Osouf until in 1926 she became a pupil of Fischer and of the French sculptors Charles Despiau and Paul Cornet who helped her to develop her own style. She was the only women to benefit from the French approach to Classical Modernism. Return to Denmark Atrid Noack: \\"Young Man\\" (1948) Kungsladug√•rd, Gothenburg After 12 years in Paris, Noack returned to Copenhagen in 1932 as a result of currency restrictions. She exhibited at the Gr√∏nningen, slowly gaining recognition. Between 1936 and 1950, she lived and worked in a courtyard building R√•dmandsgade 34 in N√∏rrebro. She produced many busts, including some of children. Among her most notable creations are Holtepigen (1937) in French limestone, St√•ende Kvinde (1942) in teak, her statue of Anna Ancher (1939) for the garden of Skagens Museum and Det korsf√¶stede Menneske (1945), an unusual depiction of Christ's crucifixion. Style Noack's sculptures are inspired by contemporary French art. Expressing an intense relationship between life and art, they focus on the human figure, often simply standing, sitting or kneeling. At a time when mankind was frequently treated with contempt, Noack strove to demonstrate her faith and trust in the human community. Her works are sincere, emanating an almost pious hope that people would again come together. Exhibitions and awards Noack exhibited frequently, not just in Denmark but in Paris, Budapest, Helsinki and Rome. In 1955, Kunstforeningen arranged a large retrospective exhibition, as did Holstebro Art Museum in 1988.

It is known for its calcareous grassland and most of the area is now a nature reserve. In the past, the area served as a military airfield, a Displaced Persons camp and a military training area. From 1950 to 1994 the Canadian and British armed forces used the area as base camp for extensive tank exercises in the L√ºneburg Heath ‚Äî thus the name \\"Camp\\". Ecology Heidschnucken on the open grassland. The area's dry and nutrient- poor sandy soil provides a habitat for numerous endangered plants such as the sea thrift, childing pink and wild thyme. The dominant species is sheep fescue. Other rare plants include filago and the hairgrass Corynephorus canescens. The grassland provides nesting for various birds, among them the woodlark, the skylark and the titlark. Leaving the paths is prohibited during the nesting season from April to July, dogs must be kept on a short leash. A herd of Heidschnucken sheep keeps the grass short. In 1995, the Lower Saxony Landesamt f√ºr √ñkologie classified the area as worthy of priority protection. It is the largest calcareous grassland in all of Lower Saxony or even northern Germany. The open grassland area is deemed one of the 'natural wonders' of the L√ºneburg Heath Nature Reserve. Aside from those areas put to new uses ‚Äî see section Today below ‚Äî various parts of the former DP camp are now private property with some tracts of land used for farming. Woodlands have increased in size since the military departed in the mid-1990s. History =Military airfield (1938-45)= Establishment After the Nazis came to power in 1933 they soon initiated a policy of re-armament and this involved creating new military facilities. The L√ºneburg Heath was of interest to the military due to its low population density and relatively unproductive soil. The Wehrmacht thus established numerous outposts in the region or expanded existing ones. Among those were large-scale training areas. Other installations later became POW camps in the war. One eventually turned into Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. In 1938, the Deutsche Luftwaffe claimed a sizeable area near Reinsehlen to establish a military airfield. The designated airfield measured roughly 250 hectares. Farmers were expropriated without compensation, but those who owned herds of Heidschnucken were allowed to leave them to graze on the grasslands of the airfield. The area originally was slightly hilly and sandy, partially covered by heath as well as oak and birch trees. There was a basin containing the source of the Fintau stream in the middle of the area. Construction started by leveling and deep ploughing the land. As the sandy soil with a layer of hardpan was too infertile for the desired grass-covered airfield, plenty of peat and dung was used as fertilizer. The airfield was connected to roads, among them the Reichsstrasse 3 (today B3). A concrete ring road surrounded the area. Wooden huts were erected on the airfield, housing air traffic control, crew quarters, a mess hall and a military hospital. For camouflage, the buildings were covered by peaked roofs under mats of reeds. There was even a fake church steeple. Hostile air reconnaissance was supposed to see a simple Heidedorf (heath village). Ammunition bunkers, hangars, repair shops and subterranean fuel tanks were constructed. The largest building was the KdF-Hall of around 840 square metres, which served as cinema and multipurpose hall. Construction materials and supplies for the airfield arrived via a loading station connected to the nearby Heidebahn. An extension linked the airfield's ammunition bunkers to the Heidebahn. Operations Second to last remaining ammunition bunker in 2012, since demolished. The airfield was used for both training and operations. Its codename for radio communication was Posemuckel. The first plane landed on 13 September 1939, shortly after World War II had started with the German invasion of Poland. During the war, the Luftwaffe set up several anti-aircraft gun and searchlight emplacements around the perimeter. Various units of the Luftwaffe used the Reinsehlen airfield for training and to test new equipment. Plane types flying from Reinsehlen included bombers like the Heinkel He 111, transport planes like the Ju 52 which pulled gliders of type Gotha and fighters like the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. After the air war moved to Germany, Messerschmitt Bf 110 were stationed at the airfield. Training involved inter alia bombing runs in which bombs made of concrete were dropped onto heath surfaces east of the railway line. Among those housed on the airfield were forced labourers from Eastern Europe as well as Soviet and Polish POWs. Their labour was used to expand the facilities including road construction in and around the military area. Eventually the military area stretched all the way to the H√∂pen (a hill) in the southwest, extended beyond the Reichsstrasse 3 in the east and was supposed to be bounded by a new ring road going north from Schneverdingen towards Wintermoor in the west and the Wintermoorer Strasse in the north. End of the war Hangar originally built by the German air force, used today by glider pilots at Airfield H√∂pen In 1945, during the final phase of the war, newly developed subsonic jet planes like the first jet-powered bomber Arado 234 were stationed at the airfield and the runway was extended by several hundred metres. At that time, many Ju 88 bombers were 'parked' at Reinsehlen, probably due to a lack of fuel and pilots. Isolated strafing attacks aside, the airfield was never attacked or bombed on a large scale, although it was known to British air recon. On 7 April 1945, a US bomber fleet numbering over 1,000 planes entered German airspace to destroy the remaining military targets before the advance of American ground troops. The airfield at Reinsehlen was on the target list, but due to cloud cover the bombers were unable to find it. As a last-ditch attempt to stop the advancing Allies, an anti-tank ditch was begun and farmers from the area were ordered to plow deep furrows into the airfield's manoeuvring area to make it unusable. However, once British troops arrived, there was no resistance due to a lack of weapons and personnel. The Germans handed over the airfield to the British without a fight on 17 April 1945. A few hours before, German soldiers had burned the remaining planes. Damage to the airfield was quickly repaired by the British. It became known as Advanced Landing Ground B-154 Reinsehlen and before the war ended on 8 May (VE Day), Royal Canadian Air Force planes operated from Reinsehlen, including Spitfires of 127 (RCAF) Wing, No 403 (Wolf) Sqn that came to Reinsehlen on 28 April. =Post-war military use (1945-50)= Immediately after the end of hostilities in the area, members of the Royal Canadian Air Force occupied the airfield Reinsehlen. In late April 1945, they expelled the families living in five neighbouring farms. Meanwhile, Wehrmacht ammunitions were destroyed, often endangering civilians nearby. In addition, some concrete roads, a runway and other facilities in the northwest were blown up. In the course of 1945 glider pilots started to use the remaining airfield. Reportedly, they were British officers stationed in the L√ºneburg area. The Canadians remained in the barracks through the winter of 1945/46. Relations between the occupying forces and the DPs were quite bad, as glider draglines smashed repeatedly into crops and some fields tilled by the DPs were confiscated in 1947 for use by the Allied forces' gliding club. The club also claimed the former ammunitions bunkers as storage space, evicting some of the refugees. Training exercises by ground forces in the L√ºneburg Heath during the early post-war period involved an area of around 48,000 hectares, of which 3,000 were in a designated nature reserve. Until 1949 British and Canadian forces engaged in training exercises right up to the foot of Wilseder Berg, which is today the centre of the L√ºneburg Heath Nature Reserve. =Displaced Persons camp (1946-50)= Former DP camp huts, now private property. Former hospital, now private property. Establishment In February 1946, the British military government in Allied-occupied Germany told the local authorities of the county of Soltau to expect substantial numbers of refugees. Since Allied bombing raids on major cities had caused an acute shortage of housing even for the existing population, the additional influx of people put a massive strain on housing resources in the occupation zones. To accommodate some of these refugees, the military authorities provided the former airfield buildings at Reinsehlen. There was a total of around 60 buildings, including a large number of so- called Protektoratsbaracken, which measured 42 metres long by 12.5 metres wide. Importantly for a potential refugee camp site, Reinsehlen sported a water works and primitive sewage systems leading to a sump some two kilometres from the centre of the camp. However, the buildings had been totally stripped of all furnishings (including windows, doors and wiring) by Canadian and British troops and by German civilians. Local authorities provided a basic supply of ovens, beds and other furniture. Operations There was not much time for preparations. The first 200 refugees arrived on 10 March 1946. To help feed them, sections of the airfield were transformed into farmland and vegetable gardens. By May, the camp housed 420 people. Then a train arrived with over 1,500 refugees, most of them old people or women and children from Silesia. They came from a camp in Poland, where the food supply had been very inadequate. This influx caused massive overcrowding in the camp. There were not enough jobs in the area, so most of the camp's inmates became dependent on welfare handouts. Paratyphoid fever became a problem. Over its period of operations from 1946 to 1950 the DP camp housed an average of around 1,500 people, making it one of the largest of its kind in Northern Germany. There was a continuous inflow of around 20 to 50 people per month ‚Äî soldiers returning from captivity and Germans resettled from Denmark and Schleswig- Holstein. Around 60% of the refugees hailed from Silesia, the others came mainly from Eastern Prussia, the Baltic states, Volhynia, Galicia or the Sudetenland. Initially, there were only around 100 able-bodied men, who mostly worked in agriculture or the timber industry. By 1947, businesses founded in the camp employed more than 300 people. The camp administration and hospital (see below) employed more than 70. A school and kindergarten for 350 children were set up. Church services were held in the former KdF-Hall. The Landkreis Soltau administered the camp, but the inmates elected a camp council and a Lagerleiter (administrator). Hospital When the DP camp became operational, a 150-bed hospital was established in the former officers' quarters of Reinsehlen airfield. Due to malnutrition and the prevalence of infectious diseases among many of the arriving DPs, medical care was a priority. In 1946, average daily occupancy was around 95 patients. As a result of the camp's overcrowding, typhoid fever, TBC and jaundice remained problems in the camp. Through 1950, care in the hospital was mainly run by around 15 Sisters of Saint Elizabeth, most of them expelled from Silesia. After the camp was closed in November 1950, the hospital continued to operate under its own administration. Eventually it became an outlet of the Kreiskrankenhaus Soltau. When the latter moved to new premises in 1968, the Reinsehlen facility was finally closed. Dissolution Tank tracks crossing a path near Wilsede, circa 1960. Sewagepump Station, built by the British Armed Forces, now disused. Storage shed, originally built by the British Armed Forces. The former British garrison HQ, today used as a hostel. The British forces had seized the former airfield from the Wehrmacht in 1945. They then had ceded most of it to the German authorities for use as the DP camp, barring those areas used by the gliding club. However, by 1949 there was increasing interest in establishing a training camp for ground forces in the area. In August, the former Kdf-Hall, used for church services, as a school and cinema by the refugees had to be vacated within three days ‚Äî it was wanted as a cinema for the training troops. In late September, the British issued an eviction order to the German authorities, stating that the whole DP camp should be vacated within eight weeks. Offered alternative accommodations in Munster were deemed even worse than the facilities at Reinsehlen and rejected. After an intervention by Heinrich Albertz, the Lower Saxony Minister for Refugee Affairs, the closure of the camp was postponed until the end of 1950. This would allow time for the construction of new and appropriate housing, using funds supplied by the Landesregierung (regional government) of Lower Saxony. Most of the refugees eventually resettled in Hamb√ºhren, where ammunition bunkers in a former Wehrmacht depot were transformed into housing units with some active help by the camp inmates themselves. Around 200 people moved to Emmelndorf, today part of Seevetal, where a new housing development was built for them. Some 200 DPs moved to Schneverdingen. =Military training area (1950-94)= Once the DP camp was closed in 1950, British and Canadian armed forces used the area under the name Reinsehlen Camp as starting point and base camp for tank military exercises on the Soltau-L√ºneburg Training Area. Although the Canadians soon left, the British forces stayed for over 40 years. Units from various duty stations of the British Army of the Rhine and even from the UK came to engage in training exercises in this area. Armoured vehicles were transported here mainly by train, to the camp's own loading ramps or via railway stations in the vicinity. Movement to and from the training areas was by the Bundesstra√üe 3 which was connected to the camp by a road. Soldiers lived in tents and later in Nissen huts, dozens of which occupied the open grassland area. By the early 1950s, the Canadians mostly stopped using the training area. From 1952 on, however, the British were using the camp on a permanent basis. The camp was part of \\"SLTA\\", in British military parlance, or the Soltau-L√ºneburg-Training-Area. This was named after an accord between the governments of Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom, which was drawn up in 1959, ratified by the Bundestag in 1961 and which came into force on 1 July 1963, called the Soltau-L√ºneburg Agreement () or SLA. The agreement reduced the training area from 48,100 hectares to 34,500 hectares. Yet these 345 square kilometres were the only military training area in the western world inhabited by civilians. Around 6,500 people lived in the actual training area, with another 15,000 in next-door Schneverdingen. Since the Bundeswehr also used the L√ºneburg Heath for exercises, and semi-annual war games were held by German, Dutch and American forces from other nearby bases, the local population was subject to substantial hardships. At times, there were dust clouds over the Osterheide rising up to 300 feet and the noise pollution from tank engines went on at all hours. Crops were destroyed, woodlands damaged, paths made unusable, ammunitions, oil and other refuse were left behind by training troops. Rules that banned mock combat in the immediate surroundings of farms and villages were often ignored. In addition, many serious and even deadly accidents occurred involving tanks and other military vehicles, often left in the road at night with no lights on. Locals formed action groups but failed to make any headway, as support from the federal German government was vital in all dealings with the Allied forces but was not forthcoming. Environmentalists also protested the fact that even after core areas had been excluded from the training grounds, around 1,600 hectares of nature reserve were still \\"doomed by the agreement to be devastated\\". In July 1967, Queen Elizabeth II visited Reinsehlen Camp on occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Royal Tank Regiment, stationed in Soltau at the time. The Queen is the regiment's Colonel-in-Chief. A military parade was staged on the former airfield, involving 270 armoured vehicles and 800 troops. In 1980, the sewage sumps in the camp were abandoned when it was connected to the Schneverdingen sewer system. Two years later, in 1982, Reinsehlen Camp also started to receive its water supply from the town. There was some controversy when ‚Äî following terrorist attacks in Northern Ireland ‚Äî the British suddenly closed a civilian road that passed through the northern end of the camp. Massive protests by locals caused a speedy reversal of that decision, however. In the 1980s, British forces constructed a large facility for cleaning tanks after exercises and a concrete road that connected it to the loading station at a total cost of 1.5 million DM. Reinsehlen Camp was part of a total of 4,600 hectares of red areas (named after the colour used on the maps in the SLA), in which military training was allowed all year. Only after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1990, the British started to refrain from training during the region's peak tourist season, the period when the heather blooms. On 17 October 1991, German Minister of Defence Gerhard Stoltenberg and British Secretary of Defence Tom King signed an understanding for a phased end to training in the Soltau-L√ºneburg area by 1994. The SLA finally lapsed on 1 July 1994 and the British forces left Reinsehlen. The 256th Mobile Civilian Plant Group, stationed at Reinsehlen, consisted of around 100 German civilian employees. They were responsible for cleaning up damage caused by the exercises and helped to repair some of the environmental degradation in the camp area after the British withdrawal. The unit was disbanded in 1997. Today After the British troops left, renaturalization work started in the area as well as in the nearby Osterheide (not to be confused with Osterheide further south), where the actual tank exercises had been conducted. Over the decades these training activities had inflicted substantial damage to the environment. The camp was searched for areas of contamination and in two places elevated readings of chemical pollution were discovered. In total, the British government spent around 10.2 million DM through 2001 to restore the \\"red areas\\". In 1997, the town of Schneverdingen purchased most of the camp area from the Federal government of Germany, to whom it had reverted when the British left. After that most of the military structures were torn down. The last of the around 100 Nissen huts is today located in the open-air museum at Kiekeberg. Former officers' mess, today conference venue of the Alfred Toepfer Akademie f√ºr Naturschutz and hotel restaurant. Transformer station built by the British Armed Forces, featuring the painting Zwischenr√§ume and with one of the benches of Parcours next to it The Alfred Toepfer Akademie f√ºr Naturschutz (Alfred Toepfer Academy for Nature Conservation or NNA), now uses the camp's former officers's mess as offices and for seminars. A new hotel was constructed, mostly from wood, with its low structures aiming to blend into the landscape whilst referencing the architecture of military camps. Two of the former tank repair shops are used as conference venues and they also host occasional cultural events (like movie screenings). The former garrison headquarters of the British is now the G√§stehaus, an adjunct to the hotel offering cheap hostel-type accommodation. To the west of the L171 road, a former military hangar is still in use by glider pilots of the gliding club LSV Schneverdingen. This regional airport is known today as H√∂pen Airfield. In late October 1998, the Dalai Lama came to Reinsehlen Camp for a week to give an instruction in the basic tenets of Buddhism to a daily audience of more than 10,000 people. A tent city measuring 25,000 square metres was erected for this event. More recently, a hig rope course opened in the facility previously used to clean the tanks. The camp area also features numerous works of installation art. The sculptor and painter moved into the camp's former stables and turned them into a studio. In 2005, his first work was Zwischenr√§ume, a painting on the back wall of the transformer station located in the middle of the open field. In 2007, he designed the Bent Pyramid. Other works by Schmidt at Reinsehlen Camp include Slat Humans and the Lavender Laybyrinth. Schmidt died in 2010, and the artist's studio has now been converted into additional conference space for the hotel. Spread over the open grasslands are works by Jeppe Hein, called Parcours, made up of various types of benches.

The main entrance to the hotel was on Prince of Wales road and is constructed from red and buff ornamental brickwork. Some time during the inter-war years the cast iron and glass covered entranceway was removed.  History  Following the arrival of the railway into Cromer in 1877 (Cromer High station) and 1887 (Cromer Beach station), wealthy London lawyer, Benjamin Bond CabblePretty Villas & Capacious Hotels: By Cromer Preservation Society Guides No:3 ;Edited by F.J Weatherhead: Published:2006 of Cromer Hall proposed that land on the western outskirts of the town, be used to develop the town and attract wealthy holiday makers from the south east to Cromer. He proposed that the land, which he had acquired be sold off in lots and used to develop residences, hotels and holiday homes for these expected wealthy visitors. The Eversley hotel was part of this scheme and was constructed between 1902 and 1903 and was built for Misses Burton who instructed Norwich architect Augustus F Scott to design their new hotel. Scott was also the town surveyor and had been involved in overseeing the new western development scheme since 1887.Augustus Frederic Scott Retrieved 27 January 2013 The hotel opened for business in 1903 at the height of Cromer's very short golden era of as a fashionable holiday destination for the wealthy Edwardian holiday makers, which lasted up until the time of the First World War. A long slow decline began from then. During the Second World War the War Office commandeered the hotel, along with many of the others in Cromer, to billet troops sent to this part of the coast to guard against the threat of Invasion. The Eversley, like many of these hotels did not fare well and had been badly abused by the troops. After the war had finished the town was left with an abundance of run down hotels. To make matters worse, holiday makers began making their way to countries with warmer climates. Like many others the Eversley was closed down. Several of the hotels including the Grand, Albany, and the Metropole were demolished.Discover the lost hotels of Cromer Cromer Museum Brief History Guide No:1, By Mortimer Massingham: Published by, Norfolk Museums & Archaeology Service.

Cranefield (Cambridge University Press, 1991) Lounsbury spent his childhood in Boston and later studied at the Massachusetts Agricultural College, where after graduation he stayed on as instructor. In 1893 the Department of Agriculture for the Cape Colony grew concerned about the incidence of phylloxera in the vineyards, and asked for recommendations from L. O. Howard, Head of the Division of Entomology of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, who suggested Lounsbury. When the post was offered to Lounsbury in 1895 at an annual salary of ‚Ç§600, he accepted, married Rose Linda Davis (6 September 1872 - July 1920) who was an assistant in Albany to the New York State Entomologist, and set off for Cape Town shortly before his 23rd birthday. As soon as he had settled in, Lounsbury requisitioned a bicycle and typewriter - the typewriter was bought with government funds, the bicycle had to be purchased from his own money. He started work from a small office with no secretary or assistant, but on his retirement in 1927 he was Chief of the Division of Entomology of the Union of South Africa with 25 professional entomologists working under him, and a sound international reputation. By 1896 he had constructed a fumigation chamber using hydrogen cyanide to sterilise imported plants - the first such government installation in the world - and by 1897 the first regulations controlling the importation of plants had been drafted. His first two or three years at the Cape were devoted to plant pest control. By 1898 his interest in ticks as disease vectors had been awakened. His interests also extended to collecting fungi and other cryptogams. Because of the limited space available at his office, Lounsbury was obliged to house his tick host animals in a miscellany of buildings, such as builder's sheds, scattered over Cape Town. Cattle, goats, sheep and dogs were kept without serious objections from neighbours or health authorities. Only in 1903 was a stable to accommodate the animals built some miles out of town. In 1902 there was an outbreak of what was initially thought to be Redwater in the Transvaal. Arnold Theiler sent specimens of Blue tick (Boophilus decoloratus, now known as Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus), known to be the usual vectors for Redwater, taken from infected cattle to Lounsbury in Cape Town. There, surprisingly, they caused no disease when introduced to healthy cattle, leading to the discovery that the disease was not Redwater, but a new protozoan parasite East Coast fever or Theileria parva transmitted by the tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Biological control was initiated in South Africa at the turn of the century when cottony cushion scale in citrus orchards was brought under control. Originally identified in 1878 in New Zealand, it is now found worldwide in citrus orchards and is controlled by the ladybird beetle Rodolia cardinalis. Another successful program was the virtual eradication of Opuntia vulgaris by the use of cochineal insects in 1913. Control of the Eucalyptus snout beetle followed in 1925 with the introduction of the egg parasite Anaphes nitens, a wasp native to Australia. Integrated pest management saw a swing away from pest eradication to pest control with a goal of minimal harmful side effects, reduced environmental damage, little consumer risk and ecological sustainability.Integrated Pest Management in the Global Arena He was a foundation member of the S. A. Biological Society, and was awarded the S.A. Medal by the South African Association for the Advancement of Science in 1915.

The tournament finals between Temerario Infernal and Oficial AK-47 ended in a double pin, and as a result both wrestlers were shaved completely bald while still in the ring. Production =Background= Mexican lucha libre, or professional wrestling, has a long- standing tradition around the wrestling mask and its role in both lucha libre and the culture of Mexico itself. In 1940 the Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet match\\", was invented where a wrestler would either bet their mask or their hair (or on rare occasions their career) on the outcome of the match. If a masked wrestler lost the match he would be forced to remove his mask, state his given name and then never be allowed to wrestle with that mask on again. If an unmasked wrestler lost a Lucha de Apuestas he or she would be forced to have all his/her hair shaved off while standing in the middle of the ring, suffering the humiliation in front of everyone in attendance. Over time the Lucha de Apuestas matches became more prestigious than championship matches in Mexico and would often headline major shows. It is unclear exactly when the Rouleta de la Muerte (Spanish for \\"Roulete of Death\\"), some times also referred to as Ruleta Rusa (Russian Roulette), tournament concept was created. The concept of the tournament is similar to another lucha libre staple the Parejas Suicidas (\\"Suicide Teams\\") or Relevos suicida (\\"Suicide Relays\\") match. in a Parejas Suicida teams of two, often composed of rivals, have to wrestle against each other, the losing team is then forced to fight each other as \\"punishment\\" for losing the match. In a Ruleta de la Muerte the number of teams is expanded, often to four or eight teams. these teams face off and the losing team in each match moves on to the next round, until the team that loses the finals of the tag team portion are forced to face off for either their mask or their hair. The earliest recorded Rouleta de la Muerte was held on October 11, 1975 by at the Plaza de Toros Mexico in Mexico City. In the tournament As Charro and Gallo Tapado defeated Chicano Power and Sangre Fria, forcing them to unmask, as well as winning 40.000 Pesos. IWRG held their first Ruleta de la Muerte tournament in 1998 as well, part of their Arena Naucalpan 21st Anniversary Show held on December 20, 1998 and saw the masked Mega defeat Judo Suwa, forcing the Japanese wrestler to be shaved bald as a result. In 2006 they held another Ruleta de la Muerte tournament, this time as part of their 2006. For this event the tournament format was slightly modified, using two first round matches where six wrestlers fought to stay out of the final Lucha de Apuestas match. In the end, the masked Coco Verde pinned Dr. Cerebro, forcing Dr. Cerebro to have all his hair shaved off. In 2009 IWRG held the 2009 Ruleta de la Muerte show, with the eponymous tournament as the focal point. In the finale, Gringo Loco defeated Chico Che after the team had lost two matches to get in the finals. =Storylines= The event featured eleven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds or storylines. Being a professional wrestling event matches are not won legitimately through athletic competition; they are instead won via predetermined outcomes to the matches that is kept secret from the general public. Event During the second match of the night La Cobra began targeting Chicano, trying to get him to submit on more than one occasion. After Chicano, Carta Brava Jr. and Eita defeated La Cobra, Rel√°mpago and Saruman, La Cobra challenged Chicano to defend the IWRG Intercontinental Lightweight Championship but Chicano did not accept the match at the time. For the 2012 Ruleta de la Muerte tournament IWRG booked masked wrestlers Hijo de Pirata Morgan, S√∫per Nova and Trauma I alongside unmasked wrestlers Eterno, Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000, Oficial AK-47, Temerario Infernal and Veneno for the eponymous Ruleta de la Muerte tournament. The eight-man tournament started out with a battle royal, used to determine the matches for the first round of the tournament. In the closing moments of the match Hijo de Pirata Morgan executed a Piledriver move on Oficial AK-47, with Oficial AK-47 looking like he got knocked unconscious as a result. Moments later El Hijo de Pirata Morgan was eliminated and thus the match was won by S√∫per Nova and Oficial AK-47, who as a result had to wrestle in the last first-round match, giving them the most time to rest. In the first round Trauma I defeated Veneno, Eterno defeated Temerario Infernal and Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 defeated Hijo de Pirata Morgan by using a small steel chain on him, cheating his way to victory. In the final first round match S√∫per Nova dove out of the ring and hit Oficial AK-47 as he was making his way to the ring, a further flying move missed and instead S√∫per Nova struck the guardrail with his shoulder. Moments later Oficial AK-47 threw the referee into the crowd, drawing a disqualification. S√∫per Nova was taken to the back on a stretcher to have his shoulder examined. As a result, the four winners were out of the tournament, keeping their mask or hair safe. In the second round Veneno defeated Temerario Infernal to get out of the tournament. Oficial AK-47 has his tag team partner Oficial 911 at ringside for his match with El Hijo de Pirarata Morgan, with Oficial 911 trying to distract the referee throughout the match. In the closing moments of the match Oficial AK-47 used a piledriver move on El Hijo de Pirata Morgan, the same way Hijo de Pirata Morgan had done in the battle royal. In this case the referee saw the illegal move being used and disqualified Oficial AK-47, sending him to the finals of the tournament as a result. Temerario Infernal and his corner-man Alan Extreme tried to rush Oficial AK-47 in the ring to get a quick win, but Oficial 911 made sure that did not happen. Throughout the match both corner- men interfered and at one point the referee was knocked out by accident. In the end both wrestler ended up in a pinning position, with both men's shoulders on the ground at the count of three. Both Oficial AK-47 and Temerario Infernal tried to get an additional fall to break the tie, but the referee ruled that his decision was final and that both wrestlers lost and had to have their hair shaved off as a result of the loss. This marked the first Ruleta de la Muerte tournament in IWRG that ended with both wrestlers having to be shaved bald.

Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the fathers of children born out of wedlock had a fundamental right to their children. Until the ruling, when the mother of a child born out of wedlock was unable to care for the child, through death or other circumstances, the child was made a ward of the state and either placed in an orphanage or foster care or given up for adoption.  Background  Joan and Peter Stanley had lived together off and on for 18 years; they had three children together. When Joan Stanley died, the state held a dependency proceeding, declared the three minor children to be wards of the state, and placed them with court appointed guardians. Peter Stanley appealed the decision, as the state had never provided him a hearing to determine whether he was a fit parent, which would have occurred for a married father under similar circumstances. Mr. Stanley claimed that his lack of hearing violated (1) his Fourteenth Amendment right of equal protection and (2) Due Process. The case made it to the Illinois Supreme Court, which ruled that while there had been no determination of his fitness as a parent, the state was nonetheless justified in depriving him of parental rights based on the sole fact that he had not been married to the mother. Whether or not Mr. Stanley was a fit parent was irrelevant. In filings with the US Supreme Court, the State of Illinois argued that all unwed fathers are unfit parents, making it unnecessary to provide each unwed father a hearing.  Decision  The US Supreme Court found in favor of Mr. Stanley by arguing that as a matter of due process, unwed fathers are guaranteed the same rights as married or divorced fathers. The state assumes custody of children involving other categories of parents only after a hearing is held to determine their parental fitness, and it requires proof of negligence to deem them unable to provide primary care. Thus, the same process must be applied for children born to parents outside of wedlock. The Court also held that Illinois' denial of unwed fathers a hearing and extending it to all other parents (wed fathers, both wed and unwed mothers) violated the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun held that states had the right to draw an arbitrary distinction between and wed unwed fathers to protect the welfare of the child. They argued that Mr. Stanley had 18 years to assume the burden. They also argued, \\"I believe that a State is fully justified in concluding, on the basis of common human experience, that the biological role of the mother in carrying and nursing an infant creates stronger bonds between her and the child than the bonds resulting from the male's often casual encounter.\\" He essentially argued in favor of the tender years doctrine, which had already begun being eliminated from state statutes that determined custody after divorce.  Aftermath  The case was an important step for the rights of fathers and children. Until then, most states held a similar position to Illinois: unwed fathers were de facto unfit to care for their children, and their children should instead be made wards of the state. Perhaps the most important implication of the case was for custody law regarding divorce, as most states had held to the tender years doctrine, which held that mothers were better suited biologically as primary caregivers than were fathers. The few states who had yet to change the laws were in effect put on notice that if the Supreme Court was supporting equal protection for unwed fathers, it would do so for divorcing fathers as well.

Shiva is worshiped as Padikasunathar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Soundaranayagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The 8th century Saiva saint poet Sundarar has sung praise about the temple in his works. The temple is associated with Pugalthunai Nayanar, one of the 63 Nayanmars, whose birth place was Alagaputhur. There are various inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from Cholas. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks during the 16th century. The temple is built in Dravidian architecture with a three- storied gopuram, the gateway tower. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Padikasunathar and Soundaranayagi being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and two precincts. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., and two yearly festivals on its calendar.  Legend  Vimana of the presiding deity Praises of the temple have been sung in the Thevaram. Alagaputhur is the birthplace of Pugalthunai Nayanar, one of the 63 Nayanmars. As per legend, Pugazh Thunai was a poor farmer, but a staunch devotee of Shiva, used to bring pots of water for the ablution of the presiding deity of the temple. During a year, there was heavy famine in the region and people were suffering. Pugazh Thunai still continued his service of offering water. On account of his old age and senility, he feel sick and fell over the image of the presiding deity. He prayed to Shiva to relieve the people off the suffering. Shiva was pleased by his devotion and started offering a coin (called padikasu in Tamil) daily on account of which both the saint and the region were relieved. He continued his service and Shiva considered him one among the 63 nayanmars on account of his unflinching devotion. History The temple finds mention in historical records as a Maadakoil built by Kochengat Chola. An inscription on the northern wall of the central shrine (ARE 283 of 1908) that the temple was built by Pullai Sattan Karivelar Gandaradittan alias Mummadi-Solvarayyar and offered lands to the temple. An inscription (ARE 283 of 1908) dated to the 22nd regnal year of Rajaraja I indicates a gift of land to the temple by Tirupattur Mahadevar. Another inscription (ARE 283 of 1908) from the 28th regnal year indicates gift of lamps to the temple. The record (ARE 289 of 1908) of building the shrine of Suryadevar and a gift of land was made during the fourth regnal year of Rajendra I. The temple was reconstructed using stone during the period of Rajaraja, but was seemingly rebuilt during the start of 20th century.  Architecture  The Padikasu Nathar Temple is located in the village of Alagaputhur which is situated at a distance of 6 kilometres from Kumbakonam on the way to Tiruvarur in Thanjavur district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. There are shrines to Shiva, Vishnu and Murugan. The idol of Shiva is a swayambhumurthy. There are images of Surya and Chandra close to entrance tower indicating the legend that both of them worshiped Shiva at this place. The temple has two precincts and all the shrines are enclosed in concentric granite walls. The temple is approached through a three tiered gateway tower on the eastern side. The sanctum is located axial to the gateway tower and the flagstaff located ahead of the entrance tower. The presiding deity in the form of lingam is housed in the sanctum. The shrine of the consort is located in a south facing shrine close to the sanctum. The image of Sundarar and Paravai Nachiyar is housed in the hall leading to the sanctum. Worship and festivals Shrines inside the temple The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 6:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Ardha Jamam at 8:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Mahalingeswarar and Pirguchuntaragujambigai. There are weekly rituals like ' and ', fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. The most prominent festival of the temple, Maasimagam, is celebrated for ten days during the Tamil month of Maasi (February - March). The festival deity of Padikasunathar and his consort circumambulate the temple and the streets in the village in different vehicles. The other festivals in the temple are Nayanmar Guru Puja and Asesha Ayilya In literature It is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams - Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Tevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar saints Tirunavukkarasar and Thirugnana Sambandar. The temple is revered in the verses of Tevaram, the 7th century saivite canonical work by the three saint poets namely, Appar, Sampantar and Sundarar. Appar has glorified the temple in five, Sundarar in one and Sambandar in six verses. There are nine holes in front of the presiding deity in the sanctum indicating that the planets come in the form of Vayu. Unlike other temples where Sun and Moon face east, but in this temple, they face each other. It is believed that the temple priests are heirs of Pugazhthunai Nayanar. As a worship practice, devotees places two coins at the pedestal of the presiding deity and take one back as a talisman.

New Jersey State Police As a trooper, Hopson investigated fatal accidents, homicides, suicides, sexual assault, armed robbery, narcotics, and spearheaded the missing person investigation of Karen Zendrosky (#C02085-393). The Zendrosky investigation spanned 24-years, Hopson coordinated a multi-agency effort to search for human remains, initiated wiretaps on the suspected murderer, gathered witness testimony, and later received commendations for moving the cold case forward. Trooper Hopson was then selected to the NJSP State Governmental Security Bureau where he was responsible for the security operations for the Dept. of Education, Dept. Environmental Protection, Dept. of Health and Human Services, Dept. of Agriculture, Dept. of Taxation, and the supervision of state proprietary security guards. In 2005, Hopson stopped and arrested suspected gang members in possession of a \\"Molotov Cocktail\\" (gasoline and motor oil used as an incendiary device) who allegedly planned to use the device against a rival. \\"The efforts of the troopers involved in this arrest thwarted a potentially deadly situation.

He appears to have accused Wauchope of being a Tory, presumably a reference to the fact that the Unionist mantle had passed from the Liberal Unionists to the Conservatives in Edinburgh South, perhaps judging that this would drive some former Liberal Unionist voters back to the Liberal fold, perhaps also appealing for working-class votes in recalling Wauchope's stance in 1892 when he refused to support the Eight Hours Bill proposing the restriction of the working day for miners.E I Carlyle, revised Roger T Stearn, Andrew Gilbert Wauchope; in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-13 Wauchope spoke on the same day, in the evening, at the Edinburgh Literary Institute. He responded by saying there was no disgrace in being a Tory. On social issues, he added that much had been done for the working man by the Tories and if returned as MP he would work as hard for the working man as anyone calling himself a Liberal.The Times, 12 June 1899 p8 Dewar renewed this attack on the state of the Unionist coalition later in the campaign, again alluding publicly to Wauchope's devout Toryism, and arguing that Liberal Unionism was now dead in the constituency.The Times, 16 June 1899 p11 Nonetheless, Wauchope did receive a letter of recommendation from Joseph Chamberlain, the leading Liberal Unionist and at that time Colonial Secretary urging all Liberal Unionists in the constituency to vote for him.The Times, 19 June 1899 p8 Dewar, it was reported, devoted most of his limited campaigning time to meeting workmen. Apart from social questions he also spoke in favour of the taxation of ground values and for the idea of Home Rule All Round, moves towards devolution or elements of self-governance to all parts of the United Kingdom, although he was known to support Gladstone on his policy on all out Irish Home Rule. Dewar also spoke in favour of the disestablishment of the Anglican Church.The Times, 12 June 1899 p8 Wauchope was now focusing on foreign policy and the efforts of the government to promote peace. He also received the support of various Protestant church groups who were concerned about the religious implications of Home Rule in Ireland and aspects of Britain's relationship with the Vatican.The Times, 12 June 1899 p8 The result Dewar gained the seat for the Liberals with a majority of 831 votes.The Times, 20 June 1899 p10 A separate by-election in the neighbouring seat of Edinburgh East which took place a few days later also resulted in a lower share of the vote for the Liberal Unionists.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1885-1918;Macmillan, 1974 p498 Despite this apparent trend however Dewar lost the seat to a Liberal Unionist rival, albeit narrowly, at the general election of 1900 when there was also a modest revival in the Liberal Unionist vote in Edinburgh East.

It was governed by the Soltau-L√ºneburg Agreement (, SLA) between the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. The area was located in the L√ºneburg Heath in the state of Lower Saxony and was used particularly by tanks and other armoured vehicles.  History  In spite of the establishment of the Bergen Training Area in 1935 and the two training areas in Munster (1893 and 1916), the protected areas of the L√ºneburg Heath Nature Reserve were initially out-of-bounds for military purposes. During the Second World War, however, German military installations were built here, including a Luftwaffe observation post on the Wilseder Berg, a satellite hospital for the city of Hamburg in Wintermoor and a military airfield near Reinsehlen. Reinsehlen Camp was used as a base for British armoured exercises in the L√ºneburg Heath from 1950 to 1994. Today it is an important area of sandy calcareous grassland After the Second World War, Canadian forces and units of the British Army of the Rhine conducted military exercises on the L√ºneburg Heath from 1945 as part of their occupation rights. There was initially no defined training area. The site of the former German military airfield became Reinsehlen Camp and was used continuously by British armoured units from 1950. In the early years, the occupying forces continually extended their exercise area until they reached as far as the Wilseder Berg, but they pulled back again in the late 1940s. From 1948 they no longer exercised all year round, but restricted training to eight months of the year. The president of the Nature Reserve Society (Verein Naturschutzpark) or VNP, Alfred Toepfer, fought for the preservation of the reserves, but the British commander-in- chief only offered farmland and grassland areas that were desperately needed to feed the population. In the wake of the integration of West Germany into the West, the country joined NATO in 1955, whereupon the occupation statute ceased to operate. The Paris Peace Treaties contained a new regulation for the presence of foreign troops in West Germany, which henceforth became known as \\"Sending States' Forces\\", stationed in Germany to help defend the country against possible invasion by the Soviet-controlled Warsaw Pact. In 1956 the Canadians largely stopped exercising in this area. That year the British withdrew from an area of 600 hectares near Haverbeck, after major protests by the locals.  Agreement  On 3 August 1959 the Federal Republic of Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom signed a special agreement in Bonn permitting exercises in the area of Soltau-L√ºneburg in order to be able to train to defend Germany in the event of attack during the Cold War. The agreement was included in Article 19 of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). Due to its protracted ratification, the law was not published in the statute book until 1961 and it went into force on 1 July 1963 as the Soltau-L√ºneburg Agreement (Soltau-L√ºneburg-Abkommen). In 1965 a Standing Committee for the Soltau-L√ºneburg Agreement (St√§ndiger Ausschuss f√ºr das Soltau-L√ºneburg- Abkommen) was formed. It handled complaints, strove to balance the interests of different parties and coordinated civilian and military issues. The agreement permitted stationed troops to conduct exercises all-year-round within the specified area. Villages and farmsteads were not to be used as military objectives and armoured vehicles could not move on Sundays or public holidays.  Location  The Soltau-L√ºneburg Agreement designated an area, 40 km long and 10 km wide, between the towns of Soltau and L√ºneburg, with an area of about 34,500 hectares, in which some 26,000 people lived. The federal government rented about 12% of the area, of which the stationed forces were given about 4,600 hectares as red areas for their continuous and unrestricted use. 3,700 hectares of red area belonged to the present-day county of Heidekreis, the remaining 900 ha to the county of L√ºneburg. Before the agreement the military had been using 48,000 hectares for training purposes. The red areas were set aside purely for the stationed troops, the Bundeswehr were not permitted to exercise on them.  Impact  Around 1,800 landowners were required, under the agreement, to make their property available for military purposes. With over 1,600 hectares, the Nature Reserve Society was one of the landowners affected and they refused to accept the Soltau-L√ºneburg Agreement from the outset, although their opposition came to nothing. Another 1,600 hectares belonged to private landowners. In 1970, several landowners were allowed to return their estates to agricultural use. In the mid-1970s, the VNP unsuccessfully sued, citing the unconstitutionality of the agreement before the county court in L√ºneburg. As a result of armoured vehicle training, the heathland of the red areas increasingly resembled a desert. The areas were not, however, placed out-of-bounds like a normal military training area and the public could enter them. In a few cases there were accidents as a result of visitors tampering with training munitions. No live firing was permitted in the area, however. During the 1970s, an average of 1,500 armoured vehicles and 30,000 soldiers exercised in the training area each year under the terms of the agreement. As a result, traffic on the local roads was heavy due to troop movements and there was an increased risk of accidents. The local population had to put up with noise, dust and vibration. In addition, the harvests were sometimes affected and roads damaged by the movement of heavy military loads. However, significant compensation for the damage caused was regularly paid by both the British and German governments in accordance with the SOFA.  Protests  In Schneverdingen a citizen's initiative was begun in 1986 to reduce the military impact in the L√ºneburg Heath. They gathered 13,000 signatures demanding the end of the Soltau-L√ºneburg Agreement. Its members organised many protests. In 1988 they collected around 100 oil drums from the red areas and protested to the Lower Saxon parliament in Hanover. In 1990 they obstructed the railway ramp at Reinsehlen Camp to prevent the off-loading of tanks. In 1991, the blockade of an underpass near the camp was set up to prevent tanks entering the heath. In another citizen's initiative was started in Amelinghausen in 1988 to reduce military exercises. In 1992, both movements, together with other environmental organisations, demanded that the minister president of Lower Saxony, Gerhard Schr√∂der, put an end to the exercises and the agreement.  End of the Agreement  In 1989, at the end of the Cold War, the Soltau-L√ºneburg Agreement was renegotiated by defence ministers, Gerhard Stoltenberg, and Tom King, in order to reduce the impact of exercises on the local population. In 1990, a break in training of several weeks was agreed during the time when the heath was in bloom during the peak tourist period of August and September. In addition no tanks were permitted to use the red areas on Sundays and public holidays. Villages were given a 400 metre wide buffer zone from armoured exercises and tanks were not permitted to drive through them at night. After German reunification, the two defence ministers, Stoltenberg and King, reached an agreement on 17 October 1991 for the cessation of training in the heath. On 31 July 1994 the Soltau-L√ºneburg Agreement ran out and the last red areas were returned to the VNP. They have subsequently restored the areas with the assistance of the Federation.

It was the last major action on the Eastern Front. Russian forces were unable to put up any serious resistance due to the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and subsequent Russian Civil War. The armies of the Central Powers therefore captured huge territories in the Baltics, Belarus, and Ukraine, forcing the Bolshevik government of Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk.  Background  Bolsheviks took power in Russia during the October Revolution and announced that Russia would be withdrawing from war. Talks with the Central Powers started in Brest-Litovsk on 3 December 1917 and on the 17th a cease-fire went into effect. Peace talks soon followed, starting on 22 December.Tucker and Roberts (2005), p. 662 As negotiations began, the Central Powers presented demands for the territory that they had occupied during the 1914‚Äì1916 period, including Poland, Lithuania and western Latvia. The Bolsheviks decided not to accept these terms and instead withdrew from the negotiations, eventually resulting in the breakdown of the ceasefire.Mawdsley (2007), p. 31‚Äì32 Leon Trotsky, head of the Russian delegation, hoped to delay talks until a revolution occurred within Germany, which would force them out of the war.Tucker and Roberts (2005), p. 662-663 Trotsky was the leading advocate of the \\"neither war nor peace\\" policy and on 28 January 1918 announced that Soviet Russia considered the war over.Mawdsley (2007), p. 32 This was unacceptable to the Germans who were already transporting troops to the Western Front. The German Chief of Staff, general Max Hoffmann, responded by signing the peace treaty with Ukrainian People's Republic on 9 February and announced an end to the cease-fire with Russia in two-days time on 17 February, leading to the resumption of hostilities.Tucker and Roberts (2005), p. 663 While negotiations were ongoing, Soviet Commander-in-Chief Nikolai Krylenko oversaw the demobilization and democratization of the Russian army, introducing elected commanders, ending all ranks, and sending troops home. On 29 January, Krylenko ordered demobilization of the whole army.Mawdsley (2007), p. 34  Offensive  The German offensive in Livonia and Estonia. German troops in Kiev, March 1918. On 18 February, the German and Austro-Hungarian forces started a major three-pronged offensive against the Soviets with 53 divisions. The northern force advanced from Pskov towards Narva, the central force pushed towards Smolensk, and the southern force towards Kiev.Woodward (2009), p. 295 The northern force, consisting of 16 divisions, captured the key Daugavpils junction on the first day. This was soon followed by the capture of Pskov and securing Narva on 28 February. The central forces of the 10th Army and XLI corps advanced towards Smolensk. On 21 February Minsk was captured together with the headquarters of the Western Army Group. The Southern forces broke through the remains of the Russian Southwestern Army Group, capturing Zhitomir on 24 February. Kiev was secured on 2 March, one day after the Ukrainian Central Rada troops had arrived there. Central Powers armies had advanced over within a week, facing no serious Soviet resistance. German troops were now within of Petrograd, forcing the Soviets to transfer their capital to Moscow. The rapid advance was described as a \\"Railway War\\" (der Eisenbahnfeldzug) with German soldiers using Russian railways to advance eastward.Mawdsley (2007), p. 33 General Hoffmann wrote in his diary on 22 February: > It is the most comical war I have ever known. We put a handful of > infantrymen with machine guns and one gun onto a train and rush them off to > the next station; they take it, make prisoners of the Bolsheviks, pick up > few more troops, and so on. This proceeding has, at any rate, the charm of > novelty.Gilbert (2008), p. 399 = Political impact = As the German offensive was ongoing, Trotsky returned to Petrograd. Most of the leadership still preferred continuing the war, even though Russia was in no position to do so, due to the destruction of its army. At this point Lenin intervened to push the Soviet leadership into acceptance of German terms, which by now had become even harsher. He was backed by other senior communists to include Kamenev, Zinoviev, and Stalin. After a stormy session of Lenin's ruling council, during which the revolution's leader went so far as to threaten resignation, he obtained a 116 to 85 vote in favour of the new German terms. The vote in the Central Committee was even closer, seven in favour and six against. In the end, Trotsky switched his vote and German terms were accepted; on 3 March, the Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk. On 24 February, one day before the arrival of German troops to Tallinn, the Estonian Salvation Committee declared the independence of Estonia. German occupation authorities refused to recognize the Estonian government and Germans were installed in positions of authority.Parrott (2002), p. 145  Aftermath  Territories occupied by the Central Powers during and after Operation Faustschlag. The Bolshevik capitulation on 3 March only ended the advance along a line from Narva to Northern Ukraine, as with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk the Soviet government gave up all rights to Southern Russia. During the next few months, the southern Central Powers forces advanced over 500 miles further, capturing the whole of Ukraine and some territory beyond. German operations also continued in the Caucasus and Finland, where Germany assisted the White Finnish forces in the Finnish Civil War. Under the treaty all Russian naval bases in the Baltic except Kronstadt were taken away, and the Russian Black Sea Fleet warships in Odessa were to be disarmed and detained. The Bolsheviks also agreed to the immediate return of 630,000 Austrian prisoners-of-war.Gilbert (2008), p. 402 With the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Soviet Russia had given up Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine, enabling those territories to develop independently from Russian influence.

The man on the poster is Guo Mingyi. Guo Mingyi (; born December 1958), is a Chinese philanthropist from Anshan, Liaoning. He became famous due to the large number of generous deeds which were popularised by the Communist Party of China as a role model along the line of the 'learn from Lei Feng' propaganda campaign. Biography Guo Mingyi's career started with him joining the army in 1977. He became a member of the Communist Party of China in 1980 and was demobilised from the army in 1982. He started work for Angang/Anshan Iron and Steel Group working at Qidashan mine, just north of Anshan. He was noted for his diligence and commitment to work, as well as his philanthropic works. These included attending his work two hours early every day for 15 years, many blood donations, campaigns to find bone marrow donors for children with leukemia and donating significant amounts of money to fund poor children's education, despite his own low earnings. He continues to live with his family in a single room, 40 square metre apartment that he first moved into in the 1980s. He has been offered improved accommodation but passed it up so that other colleagues could get better housing. For these acts, from 2010 onwards he has received many national level awards. In 2011, a movie biography of Guo Mingyi was produced. The movie was directed by Chen Guoxing and Wang Jing, with the lead part played by Hou Yong and supporting parts by Jiang Hongbo, Li Qin and Feng Yuanzheng. Guo is an alternate member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; he is ranked close to the end of the list of alternate members, which is ranked by number of confirmation votes received at the 18th Party Congress. His elevation to the Central Committee was notable in that he had no political or business experience prior to his joining the elite committee. In 2013, he was named a vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. =The \\"Father-like Smile\\" Gaffe= On Oct 23, 2013, Guo Mingyi posted on Sina Weibo describing an encounter with Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of Communist Party and president of China. In the post he used the phrase \\"smile like an affectionate father\\" () for Xi. The post raised a lot of attention and mockery because Xi is only 5 years his senior. Guo removed the phrase afterwards.

It has gained viral notoriety for being a no-budget action film, produced on a reported budget of under $200 though producer Alan Hofmanis admitted that it was a meager $85. A trailer for the film was uploaded to YouTube in January 2010, and has been viewed over 3.5 million times as of June 2020. The original version of the film was lost due to power outages and \\"strained conditions\\", while the surviving version of Who Killed Captain Alex? released online includes an English \\"Video Joker\\" commentary that adds in running gags about the characters. Plot Captain Alex, one of the most decorated officers in the Uganda People's Defence Force, is sent out to destroy the evil Richard and his Tiger Mafia, a criminal organization that controls the city of Kampala from the shadows. After Captain Alex captures Richard's brother during a commando mission in Wakaliga, losing countless men in the process, Richard sets out for revenge. He sends a female spy to seduce Captain Alex for the Tiger Mafia to capture him. Later that night, a scream is heard from the tent, and Captain Alex is found dead ‚Äî but nobody is sure who killed him. Captain Alex's brother, a Ugandan Shaolin Monk nicknamed Bruce U (a play on Bruce Lee as he is known for his exceptional kung fu skills), arrives in Kampala in search of the murderer. After getting into a fight with nearby temple martial artists, he meets the temple's master. Bruce U desperately begs the master to help him on his mission for vengeance, but the master refuses, saying that martial arts should not be used for vengeance and rage, but instead for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Bruce U leaves in frustration, with the master reminding him to bring a cake in their next meeting. After spending the night in a tree, Bruce U wakes up and begins his training routine. As he prepares his breakfast, he encounters a woman named Ritah, one of Richard's wives who has lost her memory after being shot by Richard (Richard has so many wives they are expendable). The UPDF, now deprived of a leader as magnificent as Alex, struggles to formulate a capture plan for Richard. However, after analyzing a map of Uganda, they find a jungle area that links to the suspected warehouse that Richard is currently hiding in. Meanwhile, Richard tells Puffs, his subordinate from Russia, to steal a helicopter from the military and bomb Kampala. As Puffs wreaks havoc on Kampala with the helicopter, Bruce U is captured by the Tiger Mafia. Now in the warehouse, Bruce U finds himself face to face with Richard, who commands Puffs' assassins to attack Bruce U and fight him one on one. Bruce U however, challenges all of them at once until he is overwhelmed by one of the assassins' kickboxing styles. Just in the nick of time however, the military closes in on the warehouse and forces the Tiger Mafia to evacuate. After the Ugandan military tracks down Richard, an action sequence ensues including several helicopters, myriad explosions, and an immense body count. Following an extended ambush, a chain reaction kills Puffs and overwhelms Richard to the point where he is wounded and taken into custody, while swearing revenge in the sequel. In the end, however, as the government places Uganda under martial law, no one knows who killed Captain Alex.

Puffs as Puffs * Kaggwa Bonny as Minister * Babirye Ssekweyama as Vicky * Bisaso Dauda as Rock * Musisi David as Tom * Ssebanja Ivan as Master * VJ Emmie as the voice of Video Joker Production The film was produced on an estimated US$200 budget. Production began in late 2009 in the ghettos of Nateete. Filmmaker Isaac Godfrey Geoffrey Nabwana (nicknamed Nabwana IGG) was inspired by his love of Hollywood action movies and martial arts films from childhood. The helicopter scenes in the film were based on Nabwana's experiences during the Ugandan Bush War where he and his brother were chased by a helicopter. Nabwana shot the film in January 2010 and edited it using a computer he assembled from old parts. The film's props and camera equipment were fabricated from scrap metal at a machine shop next to Nabwana's house. The actors supplied their own costumes; one of them was given a mask so he could play two different roles in the same scene. Squibs used to simulate gunshot wounds were made from condoms filled with red food coloring and tied to fishing lines before being taped to the actors' chests; Nabwana previously used cow blood, but was forced to discontinue it after one of his actors developed tetanus. Throughout the film, a panpipes cover of the Seal song \\"Kiss from a Rose\\" can be heard.  Release and reception  Who Killed Captain Alex? has sold over 10,000 copies in DVD sales in Uganda and pirated copies of the film have sold an estimated 10 times of that amount. The official trailer of the film uploaded to YouTube on 30 January 2010 quickly developed a cult following and currently has over 3 million views. The film itself was uploaded on Wakaliwood's YouTube channel on March 1, 2015. It currently has over 5 million views. The film was released alongside Bad Black in the Wakaliwood Supa Action Vol. 1 Blu-ray/DVD combo by the American Genre Film Archive (AGFA) on 14 May 2019. The Blu-ray release features the option to watch Who Killed Captain Alex? with or without the VJ Emmie narration, plus subtitles in 40 languages, and welcome videos by Nabwana IGG for 14 countries. Who Killed Captain Alex? was generally received well by critics and audiences alike, who saw it as an endearing \\"so bad it's good\\" experience, despite its limitations. Sequel Nabwana IGG had completed work on the 2010 sequel Tebaatusasula (Luganda: \\"Those Who Were Screwed Over\\") when a massive power surge in Wakaliga destroyed the hard drive that contained the film footage, resulting in it being a lost film. On 2 March 2015, Wakaliwood set up a Kickstarter campaign to raise US$160 for the film Tebaatusasula: Ebola. The studio was able to receive US$13,181 from 374 backers by 1 April. Tebaatusasula: Ebola serves as the direct sequel to Who Killed Captain Alex? and a remake of the lost Tebaatusasula film.

Patola-weaving is a closely guarded family tradition. There are three families in Patan that weave these highly prized double ikat saris. It is said that this technique is taught to no one in the family, but only to the sons. It can take six months to one year to make one sari due to the long process of dying each strand separately before weaving them together.Patola was woven in Surat, Ahmedabad and Patan. Highly valued in Indonesia, became part of the local weaving tradition there. The weave To create a patola sari, both the warp and weft threads are wrapped to resist the dye according to the desired pattern of the final woven fabric. This tying is repeated for each colour that is to be included in the finished cloth. The technique of dyeing the warp and weft before weaving is called double ikat. The bundles of thread are strategically knotted before dyeing. Patola saris from surat, Ahmedabad and Patan are renowned for their colourful diversity and geometrical style. History ''' Silk weavers of the salvi caste from the state of Maharashtra chose Gujarat as the home for their renowned patola fabric. It is believed that salvis went to Gujarat in the 12th century with the intention of acquiring the patronage of the Chaulukyas Rajputs, who ruled all of Gujarat and parts of Malva and south Rajasthan at the time, with Anahiwad Patan as the capital. Legend says that over 700 patola weavers came to the palace of Raja Kumarpal,on the personal request of king himself. The Solanki(Chalukya) rulers used to dress in patola silk themselves on special occasions. It is broadly accepted belief that these Salvis originally belonged to the region, which now lies at the middle of the present day Marathawada and Vidarbha divisions of Maharashtra state. The art of Patola weaving is an ancient one. According to some historians, the art of Patola weaving was known also in the 4th Century in ‚ÄúAjanta‚Äù caves, which resembles the tie-dyes technique of patola. Ajanta Caves were patronized by the Vatsagulma branch of the Vakataka dynasty, which controlled a vast area of Deccan during the 3rd, 4th & 5th centuries A.D. Vatsagulma is presently the 'Washim' district of the Vidarbha Division of Maharashtra. After the decline of the Solanki empire, the salvis founded a rich trade in Gujarat. Patola saris quickly became a sign of social status among Gujarati women and girls, especially as part of stridhan, items that a woman can claim as her These art of patan is more than 850 years old Design and pattern Patola sari is mainly use in Gujrati people & sari design is very micro and old traditional Indian culture design like old khatli design hand made silk thread use and multi color thread use the design is old Indian temple related and nature design like flower and rangolis that is main concept of sari. here are four distinct patterns which are woven primarily in Gujarat by the salvi community. In Jain and Hindu communities, double ikat saris with entire designs of parrots, flowers, elephant, and dancing figures are generally used. In Muslim communities, saris with geometric designs and flower patterns are typical, being worn mostly for weddings and other special occasions. Maharashtrian Brahmins wear saris woven with plain, dark coloured borders and body, and a bird design called Nari Kunj.

Thales Alenia Space is in charge of supplying the satellite bus. Within the framework of the project, a facility for assembly, integration and testing of spacecraft (UMET) up to mass will be established in Turkey, which is considered as a critical infrastructure. The project is valued at more than ‚Ç¨ 250m. The satellite with resolution is intended for use of reconnaissance over any location on Earth without geographical restriction. Additionally, it will carry out various civil applications on mapping and planning, landcover survey, geology, ecosystem monitoring, disaster management, environmental control, coastal zone management, and water resources. Dispute with Israel Israel started a pressure campaign on the French company Thales Group, which is one of the shareholders of Telespazio. Israel expressed its fear that the high resolution imagery taken by G√∂kt√ºrk-1 over its territory could eventually fall into the wrong hands. Israel, which supplies some of the critical electro-optical parts of the satellite's high-technology camera system to Thales Group, stipulated that G√∂kt√ºrk-1 should be made incapable of taking imagery as long as it is over Israel. Turkey, after having received such information, demanded from the contractor Thales Group that it has to prove the satellite can take imagery from any location desired. The French producer initially rejected this demand, but later decided to accept it, after the Turkish government responded by stopping the payments. Turkish bureaucrats also requested the launch of the satellite to be made by an experienced and well-known space company. Thales Group, on the other hand, originally proposed to commission a launch company without too much experience in order to cut the costs. Launch After numerous delays due to political and business disputes, which were finally solved, the satellite was launched from the Guiana Space Center at 13:51:44 UTC, on 5 December 2016, on flight VV08 of the European Space Agency's Vega rocket. Four years earlier, G√∂kt√ºrk-2, another Earth observation satellite of the G√∂kt√ºrk series (however with lower resolution compared to G√∂kt√ºrk-1) was successfully placed in orbit on December 18, 2012.

He was a specialist sprinter who recorded all his important wins at distances between five and six and a half furlongs. After finishing unplaced in his only start as a two-year-old he showed good, but unexceptional form in handicaps the following season. In 1984 he improved to become a top-class performer, winning the Prix de la Porte Maillot and the Prix Maurice de Gheest in France and the Diadem Stakes in England. He made further improvement to become recognised as the best sprinter in Europe in 1985, winning the Temple Stakes, King's Stand Stakes, July Cup and William Hill Sprint Championship. After a poor run in the Breeders' Cup Mile he was retired to stud where he had limited success as a sire of winners. Background Never So Bold was a \\"big, rangy, good-looking\\" bay horse with a small white star bred by the Mount Rosa Stud. During his racing career he carried the red and white colours of Edward Kessly. He was trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by Robert Armstrong, who had trained another outstanding sprinter in Moorestyle, and was ridden in most of his races by the American jockey Steve Cauthen. Never So Bold was sired by Bold Lad, the leading British and Irish two-year-old of 1966, whose other offspring included the 1000 Guineas winner Waterloo. His dam Never Never Land was an unraced sister of Bombazine, who produced the St Leger winner Bruni. Racing career =1982-1983: early career= Never So Bold's only race as a two-year-old came on 29 October at Newmarket Racecourse when he finished eighth of the twenty runners in a maiden race. In the following season he lost his first three races but then developed into what the independent Timeform organisation described as \\"quite a useful handicapper\\". He won three races including the Great St. Wilfrid Stakes over six furlongs at Ripon and the Pearce Duff Stakes over seven furlongs at Ascot. He ended the year with a Timeform rating of 100. =1984: four-year-old season= On his first two starts as a four-year-old Never So Bold was beaten in a handicap race at Newmarket at was then tried at Listed class in the John of Gaunt Stakes at Haydock Park Racecourse, where he finished second to Mr Meeka. The colt's rise to the top of the sprint division came in June when he won the Prix de la Porte Maillot, a weak-looking Group Three event over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. In the Group One July Cup at Newmarket he started a 33/1 outsider but exceeded expectations by finishing second to the three-year-old Chief Singer, and ahead of the leading sprinters Committed and Habibti. In August, Never So Bold made a second visit to France and recorded his most important success up to that time when he won the Prix Maurice de Gheest (then Group Two, now Group One) over 1300 metres at Deauville. Later that month he was beaten a neck by Prego in the Group Three Hungerford Stakes over seven furlongs when he appeared to tire in the closing stages. On his next appearance he was ridden by Tony Murray in the Vernons Sprint Cup at Haydock and finished third, beaten a short head and half a length by Petong and Habibti. On his final appearance he won his first British Group race when he beat Fortysecond Street by one and a half lengths in the Diadem Stakes at Ascot. By the end of the year, he was rated 128 by Timeform, representing an improvement of 28 pounds on his 1983 rating. It had been intended that the colt would be retired to stud at the end of the year, but when an injury prevented him from taking the required medical checks the decision was taken to keep him in training for one more season. =1985: five- year-old season= Never So Bold began his final season in the Temple Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse in May. Racing over the minimum distance of five furlongs for the first time he took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by half a length from the three-year-old Primo Dominie. On 21 June Never So Bold started 4/1 second favourite for the Group One King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot. Ridden by his trainer's brother-in-law Lester Piggott, Never So Bold took the lead two furlongs from the finish and quickly went clear of his opponents. He won by three lengths despite being eased down by Piggott in the closing stages: according to Timeform he \\"slaughtered\\" the opposition. There was some concern after the race when the winner appeared to be lame, the result of a condition which caused internal bleeding in his left foreleg after exercise. The condition recurred after the July Cup at Newmarket, but did not affect Never So Bold in the race, as he accelerated from off the pace to win by two and a half lengths from Committed. At York Racecourse on 22 August, Never So Bold won his third consecutive Group One race as he beat Primo Dominie by two lengths in the William Hill Sprint Championship (now the Nunthorpe Stakes). In his two remaining races, Never So Bold failed to reproduce his best form. In October he was made odds-on favourite for the Prix de l'Abbaye but did not produce his usual acceleration and finished fourth to Committed. He was then sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Mile at Aqueduct Racetrack in November. Racing over the distance for the first time in two and a half years he was never in contention and finished tenth behind Cozzene. He was then retired to stud with a syndicated value of ¬£1.8 million. Assessment In 1985 Never So Bold was officially Europe's fourth best older horse, with a rating of 130 placing him behind Sagace, Rainbow Quest and Pebbles. Following a \\"recalibration\\" of historic ratings in 2013, the ratings of all horses in the 1985 classification were moved down by three pounds, giving him a new official rating of 127. The independent Timeform organisation disagreed, assigning Never So Bold a rating of 135 (level with the filly Pebbles), making him the highest-rated older male horse of the year as well as their champion sprinter. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Never So Bold the twenty-fifth best British or Irish trained sprinter of the 20th century. Stud record Never So Bold was initially based at the Brook Stud at Newmarket, later moving to the Cheveley Park Stud and then the Britton House Stud in Somerset before arriving at the Wood Farm Stud in Shropshire in 1995. He was not a successful sire, the best of his offspring being the Diomed Stakes winner Eton Lad and the Wokingham Stakes winner Venture Capitalist. He was, however, the damsire of Presvis, a gelding who earned prize money of more than ¬£4 million, winning races including the Queen Elizabeth II Cup and the Dubai Duty Free Stakes. Never So Bold died of heart failure at Wood Farm on 8 February 2000. Pedigree * Never So Bold was inbred 3 x 4 to Nasrullah, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

Book Cafe operates in partnership with leading cultural NGO Pamberi Trust to offer both diverse entertainment to the public at large as well as a space for artistic development ‚Äì especially a platform for younger artists. book Cafe is known for its diversity of music and puts on a musical show almost everynight of the year. Almost every artist in Zimbabwe has performed at the Book Cafe.  Background  In the first eight years since the foundation, the Book Caf√© organized 7,500 concerts and events, 650 public debates, 70 book presentations and 35 theater performances, and did it offer stage to 150 international touring acts.Zimbabwe Online Press (27 December 2012) Pamberi Trust Book Cafe in Harare will be shut down at the end of the year The Book Caf√© was originally created by Paul Brickhill, in order for his band, Luck Street Blues featuring Miriam Mandipira, David Ndoro and his son Tomas Brickhill, to have a venue. Among the nearly 1000 concerts the band performed between 1995 and 2005, most of them took place at The Book Caf√©. The Book caf√© has been called a free space, a liberated zone, an embassy of change. It is a hub for artists ‚Äì a place to meet, work, network and share ideas. It is a place of free expression, of entertainment, of generosity. Book Cafe offers a space to eat, to drink to discuss ‚Äì to enjoy music, theatre, fashion and film. Book Cafe is also home to The Spoken Word and comes alive each and every month with Sistaz Open Mic and the House of Hunger Poetry Slam. Book Cafe is becoming a Community Arts Centre -a space where artists and the public can meet each other, can connect with each other and share ideas and inspiration. Book Cafe has been credited with the revaluation of many traditional forms of music, particularly of jazz fusion and African jazz. For instance did it result in the increase of popularity of the use of the traditional mbira by young people.Power of Culture (August 2007) Harare Book Caf√© the hub of Zimbabwe's cultural life One fifth of the budget originates from sponsors and is being used to organize workshops and readings of for instance the Book Caf√© Academy of Performing Arts (BOCAPA). The remaining income comes from the revenue of consumptions and entrance fee.  Temporary closure and move  Book Caf√© was served with notice of eviction from its revered Fife Avenue location in 2011. From 1 January 2012 it ceased operating in that iconic space that had become an artists‚Äô home. The year began amidst ruins, with the daunting task of securing alternative space, re-locating all operations, refurbishing and re-equipping. At the time, the organisation was reminded of its roots, that it was established in 1981 by war veterans (several engaged in cultural work), it grew out of the struggle initially as Grassroots Books, transformed into Book Caf√© in 1997, and finally founded Pamberi Trust in 2002 as the development wing of a social enterprise. 2012 turned out to be our year of resilience. While events and concerts fell to 276 from a peak of 909 (2011, in twin venues including Mannenberg), this was a major accomplishment since the new Book Caf√© was closed for 5 months and operating ‚Äòpartially‚Äô for another 4 months, in effect a cumulative total of 60% ‚Äòdowntime‚Äô. About 75% of basic refurbishment was completed by the end of 2012. Our new home is bigger, central and offers more scope for expansion. The Book Caf√© bookshop, closed in 2008, re-opened late in the year. A film screening and workshop facility took shape, making possible weekly screenings of relevant local and African films. Staging, technical and venue facilities were upgraded. The projects office (our ‚Äòengine room‚Äô of ideas) moved to larger dedicated space at the back. Impressive progress was made in information dissemination. Several epic arts and social discussions took place. Historic concerts were held in the year, Sulumani Chimbetu breaking Book Caf√© attendance records, Oliver Mtukudzi weaving his magic to full houses, while extraordinary arts collaborations took shape, notably Victor Kunonga with maestro Bheki Khoza (SA) and Chiwoniso Maraire with Tumi and The Volume (SA). The success of the October Jazz and World Music Festival laid foundations for the future. And who could forget Jamaican D‚Äôbi Young's mind- blasting poetic performance at Poetry Africa, at which young Zimbabwean poets including Flowchyld and Madzitatiguru also distinguished themselves. The year ended aptly, with the largest ‚Äò16 Days Against Gender-based Violence‚Äô series of events on record at Book Caf√©. Poetry and gender programmes retained all their exuberance; brilliant young poets emerged. Jazz and Mbira highlights were fabulous. Despite sometimes desperate struggles during this, Book Caf√©‚Äôs hardest ever year, our hopes and dreams were fulfilled. I am not sure I have ever seen such an outpouring of exciting and skilled youth arts talent since our inception in 1997, well done to the young artists! Amongst this, Pamberi Trust continued its management role in the 16-country African Music Festivals Network, helped establish pioneering civil society and arts platforms, and contributed nationally towards festival platforms in Gweru, Bulawayo, Chimanimani, Harare and local initiatives around the country. Book Caf√©, under Pamberi Trust remit, entered 2012 as a Prince Claus Award laureate (the first venue in Africa to receive this), established to recognise outstanding cultural accomplishment in African, Asian and Latin American regions. Rigorous standards are applied and the Award is globally recognised. Pamberi Trust was awarded for services to arts development, support for emerging artists, innovation, and for nurturing of the principle of ‚Äòfreedom of expression in the arts‚Äô. Freedom of Expression in culture has profound traditions in struggles for emancipation in the formerly colonized world, including Zimbabwe, from which traditions Pamberi Trust and Book Caf√© draw inspiration. This principle is enshrined in the new constitution of Zimbabwe (2013), and features centrally in the UNESCO protocol on ‚ÄòThe Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions‚Äô (2005), sometimes called the most important cultural agreement of the last 50 years, since it emphasizes protection of our cultural assets from abuse by multi-national corporate power. Zimbabwe is signatory (2008), alongside 129 countries. Mid-March 2012 the Book Caf√© was reopened on a new location, at the Samora Machel Avenue on the corner of the Sixth Street. The opening was heralded by two five-hour concerts.Financial Gazette Harrare (30 March 2012) Zimbabwe: Book Cafe Springs Back to Life  References   External links  *Impression with photos Category:Zimbabwean culture Category:Musical theatre organizations Category:Theatres in Zimbabwe ","title":"The Book Caf√© (Zimbabwe)"},{"id":"38345785","text":"Tino Wenzel (born 18 December 1973 in Ibbenb√ºren, North Rhine-Westphalia) is a German sport shooter.

It took place in January 2013 within the Northern Mali Conflict. Prelude A few days after taking the towns of Konna and Diabaly, the French and Malian forces continued their progress on Timbuktu and Gao. In the latter city, about 60 Islamists were killed on January 13 by French bombing according to testimonies of inhabitants. Three days before the attack, a hundred special forces commandos were sent to the scene. After the capture of Diabaly, the special forces advanced in Gao, the largest city in northern Mali, with a population of about 100,000. Between 21 and 24 January, the French traveled 500 kilometers, while the road being monitored by the air force, and finally stopped in the evening of 24 a few dozen kilometers from Gao.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 287-288.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 303. Forces in presence MUJAO forces still present in Gao were no longer very important, with about 60 fighters divided into two groups defended the Wabaria Bridge which guard the southern entrance of the city. The first group is posted at the level of a toll, the second is placed further upstream. To take the city, the French army engages in front line its special forces (COS). About fifty men are responsible for taking the bridge, others the airport. A total of 88 Special Forces soldiers took in the fighting in Gao. They had come mainly from the 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment ( 1st RPIMa) and Air Parachute Commando No. 10 (CPA-10). This force was supported by two Tiger helicopters and two Gazelle helicopters, while five Puma helicopters were tasked with carrying six groups of marine commandos. Behind the special forces, an important 15-kilometer French-Malian column is also moving on Gao. However, it will not take part in the fight, the action of the special forces proving sufficient to drive the jihadists out of the city. The French side is close to 100 soldiers with six ERC-90 armored vehicles. The Malian army engaged for its 466 soldiers commanded by Colonel Samak√© with two BM-21 and fifty pick-up. In total, the column counts 563 Malian and French soldiers and 93 vehicles.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 310.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 287. Taking of the bridge of Wabaria The fight began the night of 25 to 26 January, during the day French soldiers took position and snipers were placed on a hill overlooking the village of Wabaria and the river. The city is watched from the sky by C-130 and Atlantic planes. Shortly before midnight, the men of the 1st RPIMa go to the entrance of the Wabaria bridge. The jihadists then send a pickup loaded with explosive, but it is destroyed in an impressive explosion by the French fire when it comes to about five meters from their position. A motorcycle is also destroyed and four jihadists are killed. Supported by the snipers, the men of the 1st RPIMa and the CAP-10 take control of the south entrance of the bridge, but they prefer not to go further for fear of traps. For their part, Rafale aircraft intervene three times and hit several buildings in the area, they also destroy an armored BRDM-2.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 305.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 308-309.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 304. Capturing the airport On January 25 , around 7 pm, the attack on Gao airport began with the striking of fighter planes against six buildings and two BTR-60 armored vehicles that were destroyed. Then at 0.50 am, two Puma helicopters dropped off about 10 CAP-10 soldiers to assess the runway 13. Gao airport is not defended by the jihadists, however, the latter have abandoned on the track of the PT-76 light tank carcasses, hoping to prevent any landing. Despite this, a space is identified as sufficient to allow the aircraft of the Poitou squadron to land. Within minutes, and despite the darkness, the dust and the carcasses of the armored vehicles, three C-160 Transall aircraft and a C-130 Hercules aircraft made an assault landing and managed to land men and equipment before taking off again. The French commandos are then in control of the airport without having to fight, to their surprise they find that the jihadists did not pose any trap on the spot. A few hours later, three other planes assaulted and landed 144 men of the 1st regiment of paratroopers (1st RCP). The latter take over from the special forces and take charge of the airport.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 312-313.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 307. Skirmishes in Wabaria At the Wabaria bridge however, fighting resumes in the morning. At 4 am, shortly before dawn, sporadic gunfire took place between the jihadists and the French soldiers supported by helicopters. Residents are also starting to leave their homes to cheer on the soldiers. Some Islamist fighters take advantage of the crowd to hide themselves and approach the French, they are nevertheless recognized and reported by Malian civilians. They try to retreat into the wild, but they are spotted around 7 o'clock. The belligerents oppose in a brief exchange of fire and the four jihadists are all mown down by machine-gun fire. Around 9 am, another pickup loaded with explosive and driven by two suicide bombers, dark on the French troops, but it is also destroyed by machine gun by the soldiers of the special forces. Around 12:30, five jihadist pickups arrive near the Wabaria bridge. They are however spotted and a sniper opens fire with two bullets. One of them touches a supply of ammunition in the back of a vehicle, causing a strong explosion. Ten Islamist fighters then abandon their pickups and retreat. The fugitives are hunted for nearly four hours, the French open fire with a machine gun, a mortar and even a Tiger helicopter, but the jihadists manage to escape, only two of them are wounded by a sniper.Jean- Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 311-312.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 306Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 309. Capture of Gao On January 26, Gao Airport and Wabaria Bridge were under control. However, the city, located 6 kilometers from the airport, is not immediately attacked. Throughout the day of January 26, Special Forces soldiers and paratroopers camp on their positions. However, jihadists are still present in the area, gunshots and explosions occasionally break out. Meanwhile, the Franco-Malian column set in motion and advance on Gao. The French were commanded by a battalion commander of the 3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment ( 3rd RPIMa) and the Malians by Colonel Major Didier Dacko. On January 26, around 6 o'clock in the morning, the first elements of the column make their junction at Douentza with the 466 men of Colonel Samake. The Malians and the French continue their route for 400 kilometers and finally reach the Wabaria bridge on January 27 at around 3 am. Reinforcements take over from COS forces. After two hours of rest, the soldiers cross the bridge and connect with the parachute fighters stationed at the airport. The Malian special forces and the French armor then enter the morning in the city of Gao , abandoned by the jihadists. The Malian and French soldiers are welcomed as liberators by the population of Gao. However in the following days acts of revenge are committed by residents, especially against Tuareg and Arabs. Looting is taking place and people suspected of being close to MUJAO have been injured or arrested. The men of MUJAO abandon Gao, but in the evening, around 22 hours, two pickups are spotted and attacked north of the city by a Tiger helicopter from Ouagadougou. The two vehicles are destroyed and their 10 occupants are killed according to Colonel Thierry Burkhard, spokesman for the French General Staff. But according to Jean- Christophe Notin , the number of jihadists killed is more precisely 13.Jean- Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 309Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 318.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 317.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 332 References External links * NY Times article Category:Conflicts in 2013 Category:2013 in Mali Category:Battles involving France Category:Gao Region Category:Mali War Category:January 2013 events in Africa ","title":"Second Battle of Gao"},{"id":"38345832","text":"Mount Pleasant, also known as the Samuel Cahoon House, is a historic home located near Smyrna, Kent County, Delaware.

The surname is of English and Irish origin and comes from Latin clericus. Variants include Clerk and Clark. Clarke is also uncommonly chosen as a given name. Irish surname origin Clarke is a popular surname in Ireland. The Irish version of the surname is believed to have come from County Galway and County Antrim and spread to County Donegal and County Dublin. The name is derived from the Irish Gaelic sept √ì Cl√©irigh, meaning \\"clerk\\". English surname origin Clarke as well as Clark is also a widespread surname in England. The English version is of Anglo-Saxon origin and was used in the Middle Ages for the name of a scribe or secretary. The word \\"clerc\\", which came from the pre 7th century Olde English \\"Cler(e)c\\" (meaning priest), originally denoted a member of a religious order but later became widespread. In the Middle Ages, virtually the only people who could read and write were members of religious orders, linking the word with literacy. Thus the surname became a popular term for a literate man, particularly for the professional secretary and the scholar. The English surnames \\"Clarke\\" and \\"Clark\\" are both spelling variations of the surname \\"Clerk\\". 'Nobby' is the nickname most commonly used in English for those with the surname Clark or Clarke.  People with the surname  * A.

On 15 September 1691 he was killed by a cannonball at the Siege of Limerick. He had married twice: firstly Lucy, the second daughter of George Brydges, 6th Baron Chandos, with whom he had a daughter, Lucy and secondly Dorothy, the daughter of Patrick Allen. He had no heir and thus both titles became extinct. His daughter Lucy married Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton who it is generally thought wrote the words of Liliburlero, and despite his notoriously debauched lifestyle, was a dominant force in English politics from the 1690s to his death in 1715.

The markers were erected in 2008 and 2010 on 22 sites along the borders of the Jewish quarter, where from 1940‚Äì1943 stood the gates to the ghetto, wooden footbridges over Aryan streets, and the buildings important to the ghetto inmates.  Description and unveiling  In order to preserve the memory of the perished Jewish quarter, the Jewish Historical Institute and the City Monument Protection office took the initiative to feature in the public space of the Polish capital its most characteristic points on its former boundaries. The markers were designed by Eleonora Bergman and Tomasz Lec in cooperation with Ewa Pusto≈Ça-Koz≈Çowska and Jan Jagielski. Each marker consists of three elements: * a bronze plaque 60 cm by 70 cm (24 inches by 28 inches) with the map representing the ghetto‚Äôs farthest borders and the pre-war street network featured on the map of Warsaw, and a pin indicating the exact location of the marked place; * a plaque made of acrylic glass 36 cm by 50 cm (12 inches by 20 inches) with information in Polish and English about the place, its role in the history of the ghetto and one or two historical photos, proceeded by a brief history of the Warsaw Ghetto: :By order of the German occupation authorities, the ghetto was cut off from the rest of the city on November 16, 1940. The ghetto area, surrounded by a wall, was initially 307 hectares (759 acres); with time, it was reduced. Starting in January 1942, it was divided in two parts called the small and large ghettos. Approximately 360,000 Warsaw Jews and 90,000 from other towns were herded into the ghetto. Nearly 100,000 died of hunger. During the summer of 1942, the Germans deported and murdered close to 300,000 people in the gas chambers of Treblinka. On April 19, 1943, an uprising broke out in the ghetto. Until mid-May, fighters and civilians perished in combat or in the systematically burned ghetto buildings. The remaining population was murdered by Germans in November 1943 in the Majdanek, Poniatowa and Trawniki concentration camps. Only a few survived. :To the memory of those who suffered, fought and perished. :The City of Warsaw, 2008. * cement strips 25 cm (10 inches) wide with the cast iron bilingual sign MUR GETTA 1940/GHETTO WALL 1943 placed in sidewalks and lawns showing the exact location of the ghetto walls. The dates 1940-1943 have symbolic meaning as the years when the Warsaw Ghetto existed. Therefore, they should not be treated literally because most of the commemorated places were excluded in 1941-1942, one site was included into the ghetto in 1941, and two ‚Äì in 1942. Most plaques were placed on the 2.3 m (7.6 ft) tall cement posts that were specially designed on sett pavement; the rest were placed directly on the walls of the buildings and structures. The markers were built between April and November 2008 and were inaugurated on 19 November 2008 by the mayor of Warsaw Hanna Gronkiewicz- Waltz. On 27 January 2010 on the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the 22nd marker was unveiled on site of the preserved ghetto wall in Sienna Street. The project was financed by the City of Warsaw and the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage.  Locations of the markers  * W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders Street corner of ≈öwiƒôtojerska Street ‚Äì here, on the site of the former Nalewki Street stood one of the most important ghetto gates. Through this very gate at 5.30 am on 19 April 1943 the German, Latvian, and Ukrainian troops under the command of Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg entered the ghetto. They were met with Jewish resistance, which sparked off the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. * Biela≈Ñska Street corner of Corazziego Street - here the ghetto included the Great Synagogue in T≈Çomackie Street and Central Judaic Library. This area was excluded from the Jewish district on 20 March 1942. * Bonifraterska Street near Miƒôdzyparkowa Street ‚Äì this point, at the former intersection of Bonifraterska and ≈ªoliborska Streets, was the northeastern corner of the ghetto. Over the northern part of Przebieg Street there was a wooden footbridge ‚Äì one of four such structures built in the Warsaw Ghetto. * Ch≈Çodna Street corner of Elektoralna Street ‚Äì commemorates the City Court building on Leszno Street (currently ‚ÄúSolidarno≈õci‚Äù Avenue) that was not included into the ghetto and became a meeting place for people from both sides of the wall and a key point for Jews endeavoring to escape to the Aryan side of Warsaw. In 1950, Bia≈Ça Street, which led to the Court from the south, was rebuilt approximately 200 meters to the west. * Ch≈Çodna Street at the intersection with ≈ªelazna Street ‚Äì the marker commemorates exclusion from the ghetto in December 1941 the area west of ≈ªelazna Street, as a result of which the Jewish district was divided into two parts called the large and the small ghettos. In order to ease heavy pedestrian traffic on ≈ªelazna Street (the only street that connected the two ghettos) on 26 January 1942 a wooden footbridge was erected over Ch≈Çodna Street, becoming one of the symbols of Holocaust after the war. * 41 Ch≈Çodna Street ‚Äì here, from 16 November 1940 to December 1941, the western boundary of the ghetto ran along the eastern edges of the premises marked by Wronia Street; also one of the original 22 ghetto gates (in operation till November 1941) closed Ch≈Çodna Street from the west. In December 1941, this part of the Wola district was excluded from the Jewish quarter and its border was moved to the middle of ≈ªelazna Street. * 1 Parade Square (eastern wall of the northeast corner of the Palace of Culture and Science with the Studio Theater) ‚Äì the southeast boundary of the ghetto ran along the premises here. On 5 October 1941 the ghetto border was moved to the middle of Sienna Street. * Drzewiecki Avenue near Iron-Gate Square ‚Äì from this point westwards a narrow strip of land was excluded from the ghetto due to the role of Ch≈Çodna Street as an important east-west transport corridor. It included Mirowskie Market Halls, Mirowskie Barracks, and St. Charles Borromeo church up to ≈ªelazna Street. * Drzewiecki Avenue near John Paul II Avenue (southern wall of ‚ÄúHale Mirowskie‚Äù shopping precinct) ‚Äì this was the northern boundary of the small ghetto that ran from here westwards along the existing walls that divided the premises. * Dzika Street near John Paul II Avenue ‚Äì after the minor expansion of the ghetto in January 1942, this became the northwest corner of the Jewish quarter. * Dzika Street near the intersection with Stawki Street ‚Äì here, opposite the Umschlagplatz, a ghetto gate was in operation from January 1942. * 55 Freta Street (on Franciszka≈Ñska Street side) ‚Äì this was the eastern edge of the northern part of the Jewish quarter. The New Town was excluded from the ghetto in December 1941. * M≈Çynarska Street (on the wall of the Jewish Cemetery near its border with the Muslim Cemetery) - this brick wall along M≈Çynarska Street and the PowƒÖzki Cemetery was the northwestern boundary of the Jewish district from 16 November 1940 to December 1941 (the date the Jewish Cemetery was excluded from the ghetto). * 49/51 Okopowa Street (on the wall of the Jewish Cemetery on Anielewicza Street side) ‚Äì the second marker commemorating Warsaw‚Äôs largest Jewish necropolis and the adjacent Skra sports field. The latter was the only large undeveloped plot in the ghetto. In time it became a burial site with both individual and mass graves, as well as a place of executions, victims of which are honored by the nearby Monument of Jews and Poles Common Martyrdom. Many of those killed during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 were also buried here. * 53 Sienna Street (in the courtyard of Henryk Sienkiewicz High School) - a part of the southern boundary of the ghetto made from the existing wall between Sienna 53 and Sienna 55 estates. On 5 October 1941, the border of this part of the Jewish quarter was moved to the middle of Sienna Street. * ‚ÄúSolidarno≈õci‚Äù Avenue between the Warsaw Chamber Opera building (no 76b) and the Calvinist parish house (no 76a) ‚Äì this so- called \\"evangelical enclave\\" included the Calvinist church, the parish house, Dzia≈Çy≈Ñski Palace, the Evangelical Hospital and a few buildings in Mylna Street. It was surrounded on all sides by the ghetto and the only connection with the Aryan part of the city was through the estate at 5 Przejazd which had been demolished in September 1939. This location enabled the Calvinist clergy and parishioners to provide assistance to the Jews in the ghetto. * Stawki Street near Okopowa Street ‚Äì here the boundary of the Jewish quarter ran along the southern wall of Temler & Szwede tannery, which was not included in the ghetto. * ≈öwiƒôtojerska Street corner of Nowiniarska Street ‚Äì the only remaining fragment of the wall surrounding the northern part of the ghetto is preserved here. * ≈öwiƒôtokrzyska Street in Boles≈Çaw Kontrym ‚Äú≈ªmudzin‚Äù square ‚Äì the eastern boundary of the southern part of the ghetto ran here along the existing walls that divided the premises. In March 1941, the ghetto border was moved to the west to Bagno Street. * Twarda Street near the intersection with Z≈Çota Street ‚Äì this was the southwest corner of the ghetto. One of its original 22 gates stood here and operated from 16 November 1940 till 20 January 1941. * 63 ≈ªelazna Street on the wall of the former Duschik & Szolce metal works factory building (on Grzybowska Street side) ‚Äì here stood one of the major gates to the small ghetto. * ≈ªelazna Street near the intersection with ‚ÄùSolidarno≈õci‚Äù Avenue (on the wall of the prewar building of public schools no 10, 17, 56 and 119, currently the seat of the Wola District Office at 90 ‚ÄúSolidarno≈õci‚Äù Avenue‚Äù) ‚Äì here was one of the main gates to the ghetto, opposite the building of the ‚ÄúCollegium‚Äù Society at 84 Leszno Street (non- existent now), which housed the Labor and Statistics Departments of the Jewish Council. In September 1941 that building, being a Jewish island on the Aryan side, was connected to the ghetto by a wooden footbridge at the second floor level over ≈ªelazna Street.

It was designed by well-known American architect George O. Garnsey, whose other designs include the Ogle County Courthouse in Oregon, Illinois and Queen Anne style homes such as the Ellwood House in DeKalb, Illinois.  History  Construction of The Menominee Opera House was funded \\"primarily through the sale of stock by a group of prominent lumber barons who desired to enhance the cultural life of the community\\". Early performances included the talents of John Philip Sousa, Maude Adams and Texas Guinan. The opera house was also used for political rallies, suffrage meetings and local productions as well. The diminishing popularity of live entertainment, brought on by the rise of motion pictures, caused the facility to shift its primary focus from live performances to movies. However, the opening of a competing movie theater quickly proved too much for the opera house. The facility closed its doors in 1929. After ownership of the building was turned over to the city, The Menominee Opera House served as a local community auditorium (a.k.a. Civic Auditorium) from 1929 until around 1945. At which time, it was opened once again as a movie house under the name of The Menominee Theater. In addition to movies, the re-opened entertainment venue still managed to bring in a few live acts as well, including performances by big band leader Tiny Hill. Despite a successful re-opening of the facility that had at one time been the pride of the city, the new era would be short-lived. Around 2 AM on March 9, 1950, a fire broke out in the boiler room under the stage. By the time that the fire was discovered, flames were already rising out from the roof. Although firefighters were able to contain the fire before it reached the auditorium, the damage sustained as a result of the fire was increased due to the freezing of the water used to battle the blaze in the harsh winter cold. Overall, the cost of the damage was estimated at around $30,000 - a total loss. However, after the fire, the building was purchased during bankruptcy proceedings. The new owner re-purposed the building as a warehouse. This action saved it from being torn down.  Future  While the ultimate fate of this historic building has balanced the line between restoration and condemnation, there have been several different efforts over the past few decades to restore The Menominee Opera House. The most recent group was put together in 2004 under the name of The Menominee Opera House Committee, Inc. After two years of fundraising, this non-profit organization of local volunteers was given the deed to the building by the Vennema family corporation, which had owned it since 1979. Their goal is summed up in the group's objective: \\"Restoring the historic Menominee Opera House to become a multifunctional performing arts center\\". Fundraising efforts and restoration work by The Menominee Opera House Committee, Inc. are currently in full swing. They were awarded a $45,000 grant in June 2012 and a $27,000 grant in May 2015 by the State Historic Preservation Office of Michigan. The group also had its first in a series of planned live events titled \\"Theatre in the Ruin\\" on September 14, 2014. The event included four musical acts. It was the first time that a scheduled live performance had taken place in the building in over 70 years. Although the overall pace of the project work has increased in recent years, the restoration is still expected to take several years to complete depending on funding.

The demonstration is considered to mark the beginning of a movement for civil rights in the Soviet Union.  Demonstration  = Background = In September 1965, writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel were arrested and accused of having published anti-Soviet material in foreign editorials. The prosecution argued that the writings amounted to the criminal offense codified in Article 70 of the RSFSR Criminal code, anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda. While most Russian critics of the trial emphasized issues of conscience and creative freedom, a small minority headed by mathematician Alexander Esenin-Volpin took another position. They were convinced that legitimate criticism should focus on the fact that the proceedings were not in adherence to existing law, specifically to the provisions guaranteeing an open trial. = Preparation = Alexander Esenin-Volpin, together with physicist Valery Nikolsky, artist Yuri Titov and Titov's wife Elena Stroeva, began to plan a gathering in Pushkin Square, across the street from the office of the newspaper Izvestia.

The meeting itself was to exemplify strict obedience to the Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of assembly and meetings.Article 125 \\"in conformity with the interests of the toilers and in order to strengthen the socialist system\\" guaranteed \\"freedom of assembly and meetings\\". Aryeh L. Unger: Constitutional Development in the USSR: A Guide to the Soviet Constitutions, New York: Pica Press. 1982. p. 156; http://constitution.garant.ru/history/ussr-rsfsr/1936/ The participants were to restrict themselves to the single demand for an open trial for Sinyavsky and Daniel, as per Article 111.Article 111 stated that \\"examination of cases in all courts shall be open, in so far as exceptions are not provided for by law.\\" Unger, Constitutional Development, p. 154 Responses to this proposal by their acquaintances were mostly negative. Many saw the idea as utopian and dangerous: While it was unclear whether the meeting would help Sinyavsky and Daniel, participants in any such meeting were likely to be arrested, their careers ruined. The idea of such a \\"glasnost meeting\\" did find support among small circles of high school and university students such as Irina Yakir, Yuri Galanskov, Yuliya Vishnevskaya, and Vladimir Bukovsky, who learned of the plan through the informal networks of the Moscow intelligentsia. Among them were several veterans of the unofficial Mayakovsky Square poetry readings and the literary group SMOG. A one-page \\"Civic Appeal\\" (–ì—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ) was drafted by Volpin and Nikolsky. It was distributed via samizdat and disseminated by supporters around Moscow University and other liberal-arts institutions. Citing the articles of the Soviet Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure regarding open courts, the appeal reminded readers of the \\"millions of Soviet citizens\\" who had perished because of official lawlessness: = Demonstration = On 5 December, about 50 participants and roughly 200 sympathetic observers gathered on Pushkin Square. Signs were unfurled with the slogans \\"Respect the Soviet Constitution\\" and \\"We demand an open trial for Sinyavsky and Daniel.\\" The meeting itself lasted less than twenty minutes. KGB officials sent to monitor the gathering quickly confiscated the signs and detained their bearers for several hours. About forty participating and onlooking students were expelled from their universities. Yuliya Vishnevskaya and Leonid Gubanov were held in a psychiatric ward for a month for distributing the appeal. Vladimir Bukovsky had been arrested three days before the planned demonstration and was held in a ward for eight months.  Aftermath  = Publicity = While the Soviet press ignored the event, it was picked up by Western media such as the New York Times. The BBC and Voice of America broadcast the news into the USSR. Possibly owing to the publicity of the demonstration in the West, the trial was declared open. In fact, only people with special passes approved by the KGB were allowed to enter the court building, and the proceedings and records remained closed to foreign observers. = Dissident movement = The demonstration is considered the first organized action of the Soviet dissident movement. Similarly, the spontaneous, uncensored production and circulation of the \\"Civic Appeal\\" was one of the first uses of informal networks of text- sharing, later called \\"samizdat\\", for political purposes. \\"Glasnost meetings\\" on 5 December became an annual event in Moscow. They attracted luminaries such as Andrei Sakharov, who joined the event on Constitution Day 1966 after an invitation to gather \\"five-ten minutes before six p.m. and exactly at six, remove out hats with the others, as a sign of respect for the Constitution and to stand in silence, bare-headed, for one minute.\\" The meetings continued until Constitution Day was moved to 7 October in 1977. The \\"legalist\\" approach of demanding that existing laws and guaranteed rights be observed by the state was taken up by subsequent dissident figures. So-called defenders of rights (pravozashchitniki or zakonniki) avoided moral and political commentary in favor of close attention to legal and procedural issues. It became a common cause for diverse social groups in the dissident millieu, ranging from academics to activists in the youth subculture. Underground coverage of arrests and trials became more common and led to the founding of the Chronicle of Current Events in April 1968. The unofficial newsletter reported violations of civil rights and judicial procedure by the Soviet government and responses to those violations by citizens across the USSR. The rights-based strategy of dissent soon merged with the idea of human rights. The years following the Soviet Union's signing of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1968 saw the emergence of a Soviet human rights movement. It included figures such as Valery Chalidze, Yuri Orlov, and Lyudmila Alexeyeva. Special groups were founded such as the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR (1969), the Committee on Human Rights in the USSR (1970) and the Helsinki Watch Groups in Moscow, Kiev, Vilnius, Tbilisi, and Erevan (1976‚Äì77).  Other  In 1995, a book featuring recollections of the meeting by the participants was published by Memorial. The demonstration is also recounted in the 2005 documentary They Chose Freedom.

It was established in 1946 and is now‚Äîalongside Theater heute‚Äîone of the leading magazines on theatre in the German-speaking world. In 1996, the Theater der Zeit publishing house began to publish books. History Following its establishment in summer 1945, Bruno Henschel & Sohn publishers (later Henschelverlag Kunst und Gesellschaft) commissioned journalist Fritz Erpenbeck to establish a magazine on theatre. In July 1946, the first issue of Theater der Zeit appeared. Max Reinhardt was on the cover, Erpenbeck's lead article was entitled \\"Zeittheater oder Theater der Zeit?\\" (\\"Historical theatre or theatre of history?\\"). Until March 1992, the magazine appeared on a monthly basis, with short periods at the beginning of the 1950s and 1960s when it appeared fortnightly. To start with, Theater der Zeit provided information about theatre in the fledgling German Democratic Republic (GDR, AKA East Germany) and abroad. From the early 1950s, however, the magazine increasingly came under the ideological influence of the State Commission for Affairs of the Arts, the precursor of the GDR Ministry for Culture. Only after de-Stalinisation in the mid-1950s was the magazine open to critical discussions‚Äîbut still dependent on political climate and control. With the establishment of the Association of Theatre Professionals in the GDR in December 1966, the aim of which was to shape the theatre scene by means of self-control in line with socialist ideology, the magazine's editorship was handed over to the association. The Henschelverlag retained responsibility for personnel, print, and distribution. Although this ultimately increased political pressure on the magazine, editors were able to strengthen their networks within the theatre scene by attending colloquia and festivals and by travelling abroad. As a result, Theater der Zeit increased its practical relevance, thereby strengthening its reputation and increasing its print run in the 1970s and 1980s. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, the editors elected Martin Linzer as their new editor-in-chief. Practical relevance continued to be the main aim of the magazine, with Theater der Zeit slowly opening itself up to the theatre scene in the old states of the former West Germany. Nevertheless, a drastic drop in the number of copies printed could not be prevented. Even a reduction in personnel, an increase in the cover price, and a new layout could not offset the subsidies that had once been paid by the GDR Ministry for Culture. With no alternative for the Henschelverlag than to stop production, the last magazine appeared in March 1992. In May 1992, several former employees of the magazine set up a special interest group under the name of the former magazine. In May 1993, the group produced the first issue of Theater der Zeit. Die Zeitschrift f√ºr Theater und Politik under the editorship of Martin Linzer. Having been completely reworked, the magazine initially appeared every two months. Since 2000, the magazine has once more been published on a monthly basis. Members of the magazine's advisory board include artists and researchers such as Friedrick Dieckmann, Erika Fischer-Lichte, and Heiner Goebbels. The magazine's current editor-in-chief, Harald M√ºller, have been in position since 2007 (2007-07/2014 with Frank Raddatz). Today Alongside the regular monthly publication, the magazine has released a number of special issues, such as the July 2008 special issue that spoke out for the preservation of the opera house of the Berlin State Opera as designed by Richard Paulick. International theatre is one of the main editorial foci. Each September issue is published in two languages and contains the portrait of a specific country. To date, these issues have focused on theatre in Finland (2014), The Netherlands and Flanders (2013), London (2012), Iran (2011), Cuba (2010), South Africa (2009), Chile (2008), Canada (2007), Japan (2006), France (2005), Mexico (2004), Italy (2003), the Baltic States (2002), the Netherlands (2001), Poland (2000), and Russia (1999). Book publishers Since 1996, Theater der Zeit has published books on theatre-relevant subjects. The first publication was the work book Kalkfell on the occasion of the death of the German playwright, Heiner M√ºller. Since then, the \\"work books\\" have appeared on an annual basis as a double issue in July/August as part of the regular annual magazine subscription. Furthermore, the publisher has around 200 titles in its back catalogue. About 40 new books are published each year; they include several book series that focus on e.g. personal portraits, theatrical training, plays, scientific research, and architecture.

It took place on January 13, 2011, at Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico.

During her time in Brussels PINK was influenced by designer-artist Rapha√´l Opstaele, poet Marcel van Maele, poet and visual artist Marcel Broodthaers (in whose vernissage of his Mus√©e d'Art Moderne, D√©partement des Aigles she participated at his home in Brussels in 1968)Goldwater, Marge, et al. MARCEL BROODTHAERS catalog Walker Art Center, Minneapolis 1989 (EN) and architect Jef de Groote. In the autumn of 1968, the Laboratory of Theatrical Research at Louvain University commissioned Andr√© Desrameaux and PINK to create an experimental theatre piece. The resulting performance, Erektion,Leclercq, Catherine & Devillez, Virginie (eds.) MASS MOVING ‚Äì un aspect de l'art contemporain en Belgique ‚Äì √âditions Labor, Brussels 2004 (FR). used text and vocalization by actors on a multi-level, wire-mesh stage over the audience. Erektion began a new art group, Mass Moving, which focused on art in public spaces. Participating in a performance artwork by James Lee Byars in the Wide White Space Gallery (Antwerp) in 1969Harten, J√ºrgen (ed.) (1986), James Lee Byers ‚Äì The Philosophical Palace - St√§dtische Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf, p. 106 (DE/EN) moved PINK toward the visual arts. Utrecht cultural deputy Jan Juffermans commissioned PINK, Opstaele and De Groote (who became Mass Moving) to create an outdoor event in the city center. The result, Motion (1969), was Mass Moving's first art intervention in an outdoor public space. A number of art-intervention projects on the scale of city life were created in public spaces in Europe, Africa and Japan. In January 1976, at the end of the Sound Stream project, Mass Moving disbanded. =Travels and return to the Netherlands, 1972‚Äì1980= After Mass Moving's Ludic Environment Machine (L.E.M.) project for the Sonsbeek Buiten De Perken outdoor art festival in ArnhemSONSBEEK BUITEN DE PERKEN (1971) catalog I&II; Sonsbeek, Arnhem (I) p.118,119,204 (II) p.27 (NE/EN) and the Butterfly Project (Venice Biennale, 1972),Lebeer, Irmeline (1972) \\"Mass Moving\\" Chroniques de L'ART VIVANT nr. 32, Paris p.11 ff (FR) PINK left Mass Moving and settled in the Netherlands. From 1972 to 1980, she worked on performance works with and for postgraduate students and professionals in a number of fields. During this period the artist traveled to West Africa to research local rituals, studied Japanese theater with Yoshi Oida at Peter Brook's Centre International de Recherche Th√©√¢trale in Paris and witnessed ancient rituals by Motohisa Yamakage in Japan.See for an introduction on ancient Shinto history and rituals: Yamakage, Motohisa THE ESSENCE OF SHINTO ‚Äì Japan's spiritual heart - Kodansha International, Tokyo 2006 (EN).

He is also called Tasabur≈ç-tanuki (Â§™‰∏âÈÉéÁã∏), Yashima no Hage, and Yashima no Kamuro (Â±ãÂ≥∂„ÅÆÁ¶ø). He is counted as one of the \\"three famous tanuki of Japan\\", along with Danzaburou-danuki of Sado and Shibaemon-tanuki of Awaji. He is also famous due to his appearance in the Studio Ghibli animated movie, Heisei Tanuki Gassen Ponpoko.Êùë‰∏ä2011Âπ¥„ÄÅ126-127È†Å„ÄÇ Legend In the past, there was a tanuki who was wounded by a fatal arrow shot, but was saved by Taira no Shigemori. To pay his debt of gratitude, the tanuki swore to protect the Taira clan. This wounded tanuki's descendant is said to be Yashima no Hage- tanuki.Ëµ§Â°ö1995Âπ¥„ÄÅ99‚Äì100È†Å„ÄÇ After the Taira clan was ruined, Hage-tanuki became the protector deity of Yashima-ji, the 84th temple on the Shikoku 88-temple pilgrimage. His skill at transformation was called the best in Japan, and he achieved the rank of supreme commander of the tanuki in Shikoku. In times of extreme cold, 300 tanuki of his household would gather together, and he would show phantom magic to Minamoto no Yoshitsune's Yas≈ç Tobi (ÂÖ´ËâòÈ£õ„Å≥) and Yumi Nagashi (ÂºìÊµÅ„Åó), as happened during the Genpei War. One story of Hage-tanuki's death is that he was shot and killed by a hunter. In another version, he died in a contest of disguises with Shibaemon-tanuki of Awaji.ÂÆÆÂ¥é1980Âπ¥„ÄÅ227‚Äì231È†Å„ÄÇ According to the latter story, while the three famous tanuki were all boasting about how they were the best in Japan, Hage-tanuki embarked towards Awaji, and challenged Shibaemon-tanuki to a contest of disguises. On the day of the match, Shibaemon saw countless naval ships appearing at sea. While Shibaemon was still in a state of surprise, believing war had broken out, the boats disappeared, and Hage-tanuki appeared. The fleet had been Hage-tanuki's disguise, successfully tricking Shibaemon. In response to Hage-tanuki's boasts of victory, Shibaemon-tanuki said that he would disguise himself as the daimy≈çs royal procession. On the next day, a splendid procession appeared. Hage-tanuki praised Shibaemon in a loud voice, but was reprimanded by a soldier for his insolence and was killed by a spear; it had been the real Daimyo's procession. Shibaemon, who thought this unfortunate, courteously gave him a funeral service. After Hage-tanuki's death, his spirit moved to dwell in Awa Province (now Tokushima Prefecture), and started to possess humans. In the years of Kaei, in Hayashimura, Awa district (now Awa city), he possessed a female hairdresser, made predictions, and was said to have dropped a tanukitsuki (tanuki possession).ÂæåËó§1922Âπ¥„ÄÅ282‚Äì290È†Å„ÄÇ In the great war between tanuki that occurred in the closing years of the Edo period, the Awa Tanuki Gassen, in the village of Higaino (now Komatsushima city), spoke through possessed people and told of an event involving Hage-tanuki.

Afterwards, in the First Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, Hage-tanuki departed with many of his followers towards Manchuria. Yashima no Hage-tanuki performed many good deeds, so now in Takamatsu he is called Minoyama Daimy≈çjin (ËìëÂ±±Â§ßÊòéÁ•û).

Among its religious devotees, the statue is sometimes known as Our Lady of Luck or Our Lady of Good Luck due to the Chinese symbology of \\"Fu\\" (Á¶è) associated with the styling posture of the entire image. The original image is currently enshrined in the National Shrine and Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Sheshan, in Shanghai, China. Background The city of Shanghai, located on the east coast of China, was an important access point to the Yangzi River Valley. As a treaty port it was also home to an international community. Shanghai served as the missionaries‚Äô port of entry to China, a depot to gather supplies needed for the interior missions, a place of relaxation and safety from political strife, and a place to connect with a Chinese Catholic culture that went back to the 1600s.\\"Shanghai: Sheshan Marian Shrine\\", The Passionists, May 24, 2013 History Our Lady, Help of Christians; Sheshan Basilica The shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Sheshan is located in Songjiang District, western Shanghai, and is dedicated to Our Lady Help of Christians of Sheshan. In 1863, the then Superior of the Jesuit community in Shanghai purchased property on the south side of the mountain of Sheshan, and built a retreat house for retired Jesuit Fathers, with a small chapel next door. On March 1, 1868, the Bishop of Shanghai, Bishop Adrien Languillat, SJ, consecrated the chapel and blessed the image of Our Lady Help of Christians, which was copied from Our Lady of Victory in Paris.\\"History of the Shrine to Our Lady of Sheshan\\", Agenzia Fides, May 23, 2008 During the attack of the Taiping Rebellion, the Superior of the Jesuit community in Shanghai, Fr. Gu Zhen Sheng, promised the Blessed Virgin that if the diocese was spared from attack, he would build a basilica in thanksgiving for Our Lady's special protection. On April 15, 1873, Bishop Languillat of Shanghai consecrated the Basilica on the hilltop. Since then, Our Lady of Sheshan has become the special protector of the Diocese of Shanghai. In 1874, Pope Pius IX granted an indulgence for all pilgrims who completed a pilgrimage to the Shrine during the month of May. In May 1981, the People's Government of Shanghai returned the Sheshan Basillica to the Shanghai Catholic Diocese. The Statue of Our Lady of Sheshan In 1924, the first conference of bishops met in Shanghai and adopted the image of the reported apparition as Our Lady of China, or Our Lady Queen of China, and a painting depicting the mother of God bearing the child Jesus was commissioned and hung in the local church. The annual procession dates back to that year.\\"Pilgrimage to Our Lady o Sheshan\\", China Bulletin, The Claretians, June 1, 2013 The image is a remake of the previous re-interpreted image of Mary Help of Christians, who is the Marian patroness venerated in the National Shrine-Basilica of Sheshan, the first historical basilica erected in Eastern Asia. During the Cultural Revolution, the original statue was destroyed, with only the dragon base remaining. Additionally, a traditional image of Mary Help of Christians continues to be highly venerated in the Sheshan Basilica, enshrined atop its main high altar.Tran C.S.J.B., Anh Thu. \\"The Shrine of Our Lady of Sheshan\\", Marian Shrines in China, St. Francis Xavier Church (Chinese Community), Vancouver, BC. Canada, 2009. In April 2000, a new statue was constructed and was blessed by Bishop Aloysius Jin Luxian. The new image features the stand-erect Blessed Virgin Mary carrying a Child Jesus on her head, while his arms outstretched in a cruciform gesture. At the base is the original Chinese dragon, representing the Devil with a trident tail, being crushed and defeated by the Madonna. In 2008, a copy of the statue was given to Pope Benedict XVI, who then invoked the Marian title through his Prayer to Our Lady of Sheshan. The pontiff requested that the prayer be recited more devoutly on May 24, the feast of Mary Help of Christians to whom the Basilica of Sheshan holds under Marian patronage. The Shanghai Government then banned pilgrimages to the sanctuary from neighboring dioceses.Cervellera, Bernardo. \\"Our Lady of Sheshan, persecution and division\\", AsiaNews.it, May 25, 2010 In May 2012, a wooden replica statue was processed by Chinese American Catholics in New York, United States.

In May 2007, Pope Benedict XVI released a Letter to Chinese Catholics, in which he asked that May 24 each year be celebrated as a World Day of Prayer for the Church in China.

In summer 2012, she sang again with the Bavarian State Opera at the Munich Opera Festival, singing the role of the Second Norn in Richard Wagner's G√∂tterd√§mmerung. On June 21, 2013, Barton won the Song Prize at the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition.BBC News Wales ‚Äì \\"Cardiff Singer of the World: Jamie Barton wins song prize\\". Accessed June 23, 2013 On June 23, she won the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World. The only person in the history of the competition to win both prizes before was Romanian tenor Marius Brenciu. She is represented by Columbia Artists Management and Verismo Communications. Critical reception The Guardian reviewing the 2013 Cardiff Singer of the World results: \\"She is a great artist, no question, with an imperturbable steadiness of tone, and a nobility of utterance that invites comparison not so much with her contemporaries as with mid-20th century greats such as Kirsten Flagstad and Karin Branzell...her performance of Unbewegte Laue Luft, marked her out as one of the great Brahms interpreters of our times.\\" Opera News has described Barton as a \\"rising star\\" with a \\"sumptuous voice\\". In a review of a recital at the Kennedy Center in 2009, Anne Midgette said that Barton had a \\"big voice\\" and \\"sang very well\\" but \\"showed [a] penchant for mugging\\". In May 2015, Musical Toronto wrote about Barton's singing in Verdi's Requiem with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra: \\"Jamie Barton‚Äôs gleaming mezzo and exemplary legato was such a pleasure ‚Äì no wonder she took Cardiff! Her Liber Scriptus, Quid sum miser, and Lux Eterna were all amazing. She was not afraid to use chest voice, but it was very musical and without vulgarity.\\" Recordings * Andr√© Previn- Brief Encounter ‚Äì Elizabeth Futral (soprano); Nathan Gunn (baritone ); Jamie Barton (mezzo); Kim Josephson (baritone).

The main aim of the landing, part of the German invasion of Norway, was to sever the undersea telegraph cable between Arendal and the United Kingdom. The German force landed unopposed, with the Norwegian torpedo boat based in the town choosing to evacuate rather than take up the fight against the surprising arrival of the Germans. The Norwegian naval commander cited concern for civilian casualties and a glum view of his chances as reasons for not resisting. While the initial German occupation of Arendal took place without serious incident, panic broke out the following day and led to many civilians abandoning the town, following unfounded rumours of an incoming British bomber raid. Five days after the German occupation of Arendal, the town saw the establishment of the first organized resistance group in Norway. The Arendal Group operated from 14 April 1940 until crushed by the Gestapo four months later. Background After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Norway declared her neutrality in the conflict. During the following months Norwegian neutrality was repeatedly ignored and violated by both the Axis and the Allies. On the part of the Germans, the violations included U-boat attacks on both Allied and neutral shipping within Norwegian territorial waters. The Norwegian Armed Forces were ill-equipped, poorly trained, only partially mobilized, and unable to efficiently defend Norwegian territory against neutrality violations.Haarr 2009, pp. 15-23, 27 On 16 February 1940, the British Royal Navy breached Norwegian neutrality in an operation to rescue 299 captive British sailors from the German auxiliary Altmark in the Norwegian J√∏ssingfjorden. Norwegian naval vessels observed the British operation, but did not intervene. Angered by the Altmark Incident, Adolf Hitler the next day ordered the invasion of Norway. Among Hitler's stated reasons for invading Norway was a need to pre- empt a potential British landing in Norway, a desire to secure the iron ore and other natural resources originating in or being supplied through Norway, and to secure Germany's northern flank while giving the Kriegsmarine easier access to the Atlantic Ocean. Hitler's concern about potential British landings in Norway was encouraged by Norwegian fascist leader Vidkun Quisling, who claimed that an alliance between the United Kingdom and Norway's Labour Party government was in the making. General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst was given overall command of the invasion of Norway.Haarr 2009, pp. 3-8 Map showing the location of Arendal in Norway Prelude In the plans for an attack on Norway presented on 29 February 1940 to Hitler by General von Falkenhorst, Arendal was one of the Norwegian towns and cities to be captured in the initial invasion wave. Like the port town of Egersund, which was also to be seized, Arendal had a land station for one of the two undersea telegraph cables between Norway and the United Kingdom. The Germans set out to cut the cable to the United Kingdom, as well as securing the telegraph cables to Denmark and Cuxhaven in Germany. Arendal was also important as a telegraph junction for the southern parts of Norway, with German personnel tasked to listen in on Norwegian communications. Isolating Norway from the outside world was an important part of the German effort at pacifying the Norwegian population and discouraging resistance to the occupation.Haarr 2009, pp. 10-11, 215Fr√∏strup 1998, p. 30Bj√∏rnsen 1990, p. 39 The task of seizing Arendal fell on Gruppe 4 of the German invasion fleet. The primary objective of Gruppe 4 was the capture of the main port in Southern Norway, Kristiansand. A single torpedo boat, Greif, was detached from the task force on 8 April, Gruppe 4 having left Weserm√ºnde in Germany at 05:00 the same day.Haarr 2009, pp. 81, 101, 215 Before proceeding on her own, Greif had been escorting the E-boat tender Tsingtau off the west coast of Denmark.Fr√∏strup 1998, p. 28 In Arendal there was much tension due to the sinking of the German transport Rio de Janeiro off the nearby port of Lillesand that day. Rio de Janeiro, a covert troopship en route to Bergen with 313 Luftwaffe personnel and anti-aircraft guns, had been intercepted and torpedoed off Lillesand by the Polish submarine Orze≈Ç. Some of the German survivors told Norwegian police officers that they had been on their way to Bergen to \\"help the Norwegian government protect the country's neutrality\\". Twelve wounded Germans were admitted for treatment at Arendal and Aust-Agder Hospital in Arendal. The regional newspaper Agderposten, based in Arendal, ran an extra edition on the Rio de Janeiro sinking and reports of German fleet movements off Southern Norway.Fr√∏strup 1998, pp. 24-27 Opposing forces =German= The German force tasked with the capture and occupation of Arendal was the 90-strong 234th Bicycle Squadron of the 163rd Infantry Division, commanded by Rittmeister Smith von Wesentahl, with an attached unit of ten signals personnel. The signals personnel were to operate the town's telegraph station and sever the telegraph cable to the United Kingdom.Haarr 2009, p. 215Derry 1952, p. 27 Transporting the landing force to Arendal, and providing support in case of Norwegian resistance, was the Raubvogel class torpedo boat Greif, commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Wilhelm-Nikolaus Freiherr von Lyncker and carrying torpedo boat flotilla commander Korvettenkapit√§n Wolf Henne. Once the army troops were on shore and in control of the town, Greif was to sail off and rejoin the rest of Gruppe 4 at Kristiansand. The Germans did not expect resistance at Arendal, the town being unfortified and without a garrison. =Norwegian= The sole Norwegian military unit in Arendal was the 75-ton 2. class torpedo boat , commanded by Lieutenant Thore Holthe. Following reports of German ships off Denmark and at the entrance to the Oslofjord, Lieutenant Holthe had put his 18-man crew on increased readiness and brought up ammunition for the vessel's 37 mm guns and 7.92 mm machine gun. In accordance with Norwegian mobilization plans a company of infantry was supposed to be set up to defend Arendal. However, no mobilization orders had been issued prior to the German attack, so the town lay undefended on the landward side.Bj√∏rnsen 1990, p. 162 Landing As Greif made her way towards Arendal, the torpedo boat encountered thick fog, forcing Kapit√§nleutnant von Lyncker to decrease the vessel's speed, delaying the arrival at Arendal. According to the operational plans for the invasion, all the German landing groups were to arrive at their targets simultaneously at 04:15. Greif arrived at Arendal at 08:20. At 01:00, still more than seven hours from their objective, the Germans had received radio reports of fighting taking place in the Oslofjord.Bj√∏rnsen 1990, p. 382Haarr 2009, p. 216-217 All the lighthouses along the southern Norwegian coast, from Marstein Lighthouse in the west to the Swedish border in the east had been turned off the previous evening, on the orders of Commanding Admiral Henry Diesen of the Royal Norwegian Navy.Dannevig 1973, p. 183 Although spotted by customs personnel as she made her way through the narrows leading to the town, the reports of the intruding warship did not reach Lieutenant Holthe on board Jo.Fr√∏strup 1998, p. 35 As Greif entered the harbour in Arendal at 08:30, she was spotted from Jo. At the time, Jo had been about to set off for Lyng√∏r to join the fellow torpedo boats and in order to operate as a group. Norwegian neutrality rules regulated that since Arendal was not a protected war port, Lieutenant Holthe was required to have orders before opening fire at any intruder. As he had no orders or information to act on, and Jo was in an unfavourable position to attack, the torpedo tubes of the moored naval vessel pointing inland, Lieutenant Holthe refrained from opening fire. Greif reached the quay without encountering any resistance other than a few rifle rounds fired by a customs officer and his son. The 100-strong landing force quickly disembarked and occupied the town. By 09:00, Greif set off for Kristiansand. During the short time Greif spent in Arendal, Lieutenant Holthe on Jo considered carrying out an attack, but avoided engaging due to the fire power of the German warship, and the numerous civilian onlookers crowding the quay area.Fr√∏strup 1998, pp. 36-40 As Greif was about to depart Arendal, a Norwegian Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11 seaplane (F.328) landed in the harbour next to the German torpedo boat. The Norwegian seaplane was one of four that had escaped from Kristiansand before the German attack on that city. Before the Germans reacted to the M.F.11, the Norwegian aircrew realised that Arendal had been captured, and took off. Chased by anti-aircraft fire, the M.F.11 flew south to the nearby unoccupied village of Fevik.Fr√∏strup 1998, p. 42Hafsten et al. 2005, pp. 66-67 The bicycle-mounted German infantry seized control of the town's railway station, post office, police station and telegraph building. The undersea cable to the United Kingdom, which unbeknownst to the Germans had been inoperable for more than three months, was severed.Taraldsen 1999, p. 133 As they took control of the town without encountering any opposition, the Germans also seized a cache of rifles which had been used by the Norwegian authorities to provide military training to civilian volunteers in the months prior to the invasion. Before the Germans reached the Norwegian Army's air raid station and the Royal Norwegian Navy's group centre in Arendal, the administrative officers there had made their way out of the town.Fr√∏strup 1998, p. 43 Aftermath After Greif had left Arendal, Lieutenant Holthe took Jo out of the harbour and set up an ambush east of the town in case the German warship came back in that direction. Some time later on 9 April, Jo steamed to Lyng√∏r where she met up with Grib and Ravn. The three torpedo boats spent the next eight days trying to support the Norwegian land forces being mobilized in Telemark county, surviving several air attacks during the time. After considering evacuating the torpedo boats to the United Kingdom, and dismissing the idea as infeasible, Lieutenant Holthe and the other commanders scuttled their vessels off Lyng√∏r on 17 April. The crews went home and the ship commanders tried to join Norwegian forces in Western Norway. Although the population of Arendal had reacted calmly to the German invasion, rumours soon began to circulate about a supposed Allied bombing raid scheduled for 12:00 on 10 April. Most of Arendal's population fled the town in panic in the early hours of 10 April. It took several days before the majority of the evacuees had returned.Fr√∏strup 1998, p. 48-49 The German landing force were housed in a school building, and Rittmeister von Wesentahl arranged meetings with the local Norwegian authorities to ensure their cooperation in accordance with the rules of occupation. Arendal's mayor agreed to help maintain calm in the town. On 14 April, five days after the German invasion of Norway and the bloodless conquest of their town, a number of Arendal's citizens founded the Arendal Group.Taraldsen 1999, pp. 135-136 The Arendal Group is generally regarded as the first organized resistance group in occupied Norway during the Second World War. The group, mostly men employed in the shipping industry, initially functioned to provide supplies to the Norwegian forces fighting at Vinje in Telemark. After the fighting at Vinje ended on 5 May, the group continued their activities with intelligence work until discovered by the Gestapo on 14 August 1940. Close to 100 people were arrested in connection with the Arendal Group.Taraldsen 1999, pp. 136-139 References =Notes= =Citations= =Bibliography=     * Category:Arendal Category:Norwegian campaign Category:Battles of World War II involving Germany Category:Battles and conflicts without fatalities Category:April 1940 events ","title":"Capture of Arendal"},{"id":"38346994","title":"Supai Group"},{"id":"38347007","text":"Mount Saint Canice Convent Mount Saint Canice was a Catholic convent first opened in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia by the Good Shepherd Sisters in 1893.

Girls as young as eleven were turned over to the Good Shepherd sisters. While there was a school at Mount Saint Canice, the curriculum was very basic. These younger girls were also forced to work in the laundry. Many young women who came to Mount Saint Canice pregnant were forced to give up their babies for adoption. Most women were released after varying lengths of stay; however, some stayed all their lives. The Good Shepherd mother convent in Australia was Abbotsford, a commercial laundry that provided (unpaid) employment for girls and women and generated income for the Convent (1863 - 1975).

Historian Adele Chynoweth writes about the Good Shepherd Sisters denying history: There are no precise figures for the number of girls who slaved in the ten Magdalene laundries run by the Good Shepherd Sisters in twentieth century Australia. This is because the order of the Good Shepherd Sisters has not released its records. We do know, as a result of the Federal Senate Report on Forgotten Australians (2004)http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate_Committees?url=clac_ctte/completed_inquiries/2004-07/inst_care/report/index.htm that the Good Shepherd laundries in Australia acted as prisons for the girls who were forced to labor in workhouses laundering linen for local hospitals or commercial premises. The report also described the conditions as characterized by inedible food, unhygienic living conditions and little or no education. In 2008, in Federal Parliament, Senator Andrew Murray likened the Convent of the Good Shepherd, \\"The Pines,\\" Adelaide, to a prisoner-of-war camp.http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=15140. Good Shepherd Australia's Province Leader, Sister Anne Manning writes: \\"We acknowledge, that for numbers of women, memories of their time with Good Shepherd are painful. We are deeply sorry for acts of verbal or physical cruelty that occurred: such things should never have taken place in a Good Shepherd facility.

History of the area Before humans, the land was under thousands of feet of ice during the Wisconsin Glaciation. After melting glaciers left kettle lakes such as nearby Gold Key Lake, the land was left rock-strewn and rough. Considered a part of the Glaciated Low Plateau section of Pennsylvania, the land is slightly varied in elevation with the Sunrise Lake's main dam measured at 1309.8 feet above sea levelhttp://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a109214.pdf Before the arrival of European settlers, the land now encompassing most of Pike County was the domain of the Lenape people. The Lenape were expelled from the area after the Walking Purchase of 1737, which placed a large amount of new territory under the control of the Province of Pennsylvania. The land was next under conflict because it was claimed by settlers from Connecticut, eventually fueling the Pennamite‚ÄìYankee Wars between 1769 and 1784. After the Revolutionary War, the former colony became today's Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and land began to be settled. Like many of the private lake communities in the area such as Gold Key and Woodlands, the land which is now Sunrise Lake was originally purchased by a private developer and subdivided into residential housing.

From the copies of such gravestone it is known that Natalis governed the church of Milan for fourteen months, that he died at 72 and that he founded the church of San Giorgio, having obtained a donation, probably from Ratchis, king of the Lombards. Other traditional information about his life, such as his surname Marinoni and his scholarship in Latin and Hebraic, have no historical basis.

Bell (born August 7, 1991) is an American football tight end for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth round of the 2015 NFL Draft. He played college football at Oklahoma, where he received the nickname Belldozer, a play on words due to his large frame and running style. Early years Bell attended Bishop Carroll Catholic High School in Wichita, Kansas, where he played as a quarterback. As a senior in 2009, he threw for 2,752 yards with 32 touchdowns. He was ranked as the sixth best pro-style quarterback recruit by Rivals.com. He was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 43rd round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign with the team. College career Bell accepted a football scholarship from the University of Oklahoma and was redshirted in 2010. In 2011, he was the backup quarterback to Landry Jones, but appeared in the Sooners jumbo package, leading to 44 rushing attempts for 171 yards and 13 touchdowns. As a passer, he completed one of four passes for eight yards and an interception. He was the MVP of the 2011 Insight Bowl after rushing for 51 yards on 10 carries with three touchdowns. As a sophomore in 2012, he was again the backup to Jones and was used mostly in the jumbo package. He rushed for 201 yards on 60 attempts with 11 touchdowns and completed 9-of-16 passes for 107 yards. As a junior in 2013, he appeared in 11 games out of 13 games (8 starts), missing the contest at Kansas State University and the 2014 Sugar Bowl.

He discovered art at age fifteen, after deciding that he could not be a musician. He received training in Tijuana and Mexico City, with his first success in the 1980s. His style has been described as neo-figurative, minimalist and coarse, and he creates his works in series usually related to the apostles, flowers, birds and women, especially those related to Nayarit. He has had over 150 individual exhibitions both in Mexico and abroad and continues to work from his home state. Life Vladimir Cora was born in San Diego el Naranjo en the municipality of Acaponeta, Nayarit. His father named him after Vladimir Lenin, and his last name is derived from that of the Cora people who are native to his home state. He played with lace, white paper and paintbrushes as a child, but did not discover art until he was a teenager. At age fourteen, he wanted to be a musician, inspired by Carlos Santana, but says that he had to give it up for ‚Äú‚Ä¶having clumsy hands.‚Äù He discovered art at age fifteen, working as a delivery boy for his aunt's pharmacy in Mazatl√°n. There he came across a magazine cover with a reproduction of a Monet painting. He took some classes and began by reproducing images he saw in publications. He has stated that when he discovered art, he decided that it was what he was born for. Frustrated with his progress, he decided to run off to Mexico City and he remembers his first time seeing the Palacio de Bellas Artes. Struggling to survive and learn art, he was in the city only six months before he hitchhiked his way to Tijuana. There he also had problems finding shelter until someone gave him room and board in exchange for some of his drawings, but he did manage to attend some classes. After Tijuana, he returned to Mazatl√°n where he met with family disapproval but he says he never regretted it. Later, he entered the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" but only stayed for a year and a half. There he met Gabriel Macotela, who introduced him to Gilberto Aceves Navarro. He also worked in Rufino Tamayo‚Äôs studio and learned various techniques that he used in his own work, but says he never tried to imitate his teacher's work. Since beginning his career, he has mostly lived off his art, teaching classes as well in various places. When he works, he is in his studio from morning until night and often does not even go out to eat. He remains in his native Nayarit and has never considered living in Mexico City to further his career or fame. His routine is early, getting up at 6am to run, then drink coffee to begin painting at 730. He considers himself reclusive and tends to shy away from social events. However, he does value connections with other artists and sharing ideas with them. When he is not painting he enjoys his aviary where he has a number of parrot and macaw species. He has defined himself as a romantic who should have been born in the 18th century. He met his wife in 1986 and they eloped. They were separated for three years, reunited in 1989 and shortly after his first daughter Adilene was born. They did not have the religious ceremony until 1999, with painter Manuel Felgu√©rez and his wife Mercedes as witnesses. The couple has two other children, Vladimir and Lica. He does not like to fly and prefers to travel in automobile when he has to travel. Career Cora with one of his sculptures at a 2013 exhibition Cora has had over 150 individual exhibitions and has participated in many more collective ones. He had his very first exhibition in 1974 in Nayarit. He began to be able to live off his art around 1981, when he had an exhibition in Puerto Vallarta, where all thirty three pieces sold in one night. He used the money to buy a car. In 1982 he entered two pieces at the first Rufino Tamayo biennale in Oaxaca. One received a prize which allowed him to meet the famous Oaxacan painter. Since then he has had his work exhibited in a wide variety of galleries and cultural centers in Mexico such as the Museo Regional de Nayarit, the Instituto Regional de Bellas Ares in Mazatlan, the Ex-Convento del Carmen in Guadalajara, the Museo de Arte Moderno in Culiac√°n and the Galer√≠a HB in Mexico City. In 2004, he created a series of pieces such as paintings, graphic work and sculpture with fellow Mexican artist Jazzamoart and exhibited them. The series Los Ap√≥stoles was on display in front of the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 2010. In 2013, he exhibited a series called ‚ÄúReminiscencias‚Äù at the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, of which he is a member. Outside of Mexico he has had exhibitions in Palm Springs, CA, Havana, Lima and Miami. He exhibited at the Kodak Gallery in the SoHo section of New York in 2008. Cora has spent most of his professional life working from his native Nayarit, rather than in Mexico City like most Mexican artists although he has a workshop in California. Much of his work has a relationship to this state, such as Danza de p√°jaros (Bird Dance) painted for the International Festival of Migratory Birds in San Blas. For this series, he built a cabin on the Palmar de Cuautla beach to observe the birds there. In 2010, Cora donated a work called El Coraz√≥n m√°s grande del Mundo to the city of Guanajuato and the Festival Internacional Cervantino. The piece was vandalized with graffiti and the removal of several parts. The bronze sculpture is in the shape of a human heart, which represents Nayarit, with twenty niches that represent the state‚Äôs twenty municipalities. The piece was taken out of Guanajuato because the city could not guarantee its security. He received an honorary mention at the first Rufino Tamayo Biennal, the Gran Premio de Confraternidad de Cuatro Cultural at the first Iberoamerican Painting Biennal of the Instituto Andino de Artes Populares in Miami and the Fine Arts Prize of the government of Nayarit. Artistry Cora is a painter and a sculptor. He began painting with oils on canvas and then began to work with acrylics and enamels. Today he mixes the mediums, for example enamels over previously painted oil and sometimes adding texture and volume to paintings, but prefers acrylics because they dry faster. His paintings are medium-sized but some are large, and his work, especially the addition of enamel, has been described by Mexican art critic Teresa del Conde as giving a Northern Mexican or Chicano look. Later he began sculpting, starting with wood, then plaster and bronze. His sculptures tend to be either small scale with a popular art character or sculptures of medium or large size. Many of his sculptures are made modifying natural formations such as tree roots or twisted tree trunks. His bronze works show influence from Alberto Castro Le√±ero, which whom he has worked. Much of his work is classified as neo- figurative. His work has been described as a ‚Äú‚Ä¶ skillful exercise of composition and color, of the transformation of color to a primordial form‚Ä¶‚Äù He often paints without sketching first once he has a theme as he likes to be spontaneous. Cora believes that art should relate to ‚Äúancestral memory‚Äù and old myths applied to modern reality. His development as an artist has not experienced serious changes in direction or jumps from one style to another. He has maintained a consistent identity, using rich colors in a minimalist style. His painting technique is not sophisticated or elegant but rather expressionist, coarse and spontaneous. His use of light and color shows influence from Rufino Tamayo. Northern Mexican influence in his work comes from classes in Tijuana as well as exhibitions and work done in Laguna Beach and other cities in California. Almost all of his work is done in series, based on a theme. Recurring themes in his work are the Twelve Apostles, flowers, fruit, birds and female nudes. His depictions of women are often related to the concepts of desire and devotion, often with the body partially hidden to give a sense of looking onto a private scene. When the woman is completely shown, she often assumes monumental proportions with a solid anatomy. Female themes have included a series on ‚ÄúSe√±orita Tecuala,‚Äù a stereotype of tropical women from Nayarit and his wife, who was the inspiration for the series, ‚ÄúNatura: Flores para Mary‚Äù which was exhibited at the Jos√© Luis Cuevas Museum . His more recent work often gives the sense of looking onto a private moment. Casa Museo Vladimir Cora The Casa Museo Vladimir Cora was founded by the artist in 1999. It contains a collection of his works from the 1980s to the present as well as pieces from the Castro Le√±ero brothers, Rufino Tamayo, Francisco Toledo, Sebasti√°n, Manuel Felgu√©rez, Vicente Rojo and Gabriel Macotela.

She is affiliated with the NgƒÅti Hau and NgƒÅti Hine hap≈´ of NgƒÅpuhi and NgƒÅti Wai.  Life  Harawira has been an outspoken political commentator and a civil rights campaigner. She was part of a small group which formed the Waitangi Action Committee in 1979 to shut down Waitangi Day celebrations until the Treaty of Waitangi was honoured. Dame Whina Cooper, Eva Rickard and Titewhai Harawira led a hikoi at Waitangi in 1985. In 1990 she went to the Netherlands to ask the government there to take back the name \\"New Zealand\\" so that the original MƒÅori name \\"Aotearoa\\" could be used instead. She is on the New Zealand Maori Council, and she is a talkback host at Radio Waatea. For many years Harawira has escorted New Zealand Prime Ministers at Te Tii marae, Waitangi, during Waitangi celebrations. In the 1970s Titewhai as a member of NgƒÅ Tamatoa advocated for a \\"friend in court\\" for MƒÅori who were appearing in court in the cities. This program later evolved into the Duty Solicitor. NgƒÅ Tamatoa also promoted Te Reo MƒÅori in primary schools and Hana Te Hemara presented a petition of over 30,000 signatures to parliament in 1972, which led to the Maori Language Act, the development of Kohanga Reo, Kura Kaupapa, Wharekura, Maori Television, Iwi Radio and WƒÅnanga. NgƒÅ Tamatoa leadership, asked Titewhai and Witi McMath to approach Whina Cooper to lead the Hikoi Whenua - the Maori Land March in 1975, to stop the alienation of MƒÅori land. In 1974 she stood unsuccessfully for the Auckland City Council on a Labour Party ticket. In 1975 she unsuccessfully sought the Labour Party candidacy for the electorate alongside 26 other aspirants following the retirement of Hugh Watt, but lost to Frank Rogers. In 1989 she was jailed for nine months for assaulting a patient at a mental health unit she ran. In 2006, a delegation from Te Taumata Kaumatua o Ngapuhi Nui Tonu went to Parihaka to meet with elders and to participate in a consultative visit of the United Nations Special Rapporteur, Rodolfo Stenhagen.

Architecture The ARC building, in addition to Baker University Center and Adams Hall, is one of several new buildings to feature Federalist architecture, as demonstrated in brick and stone cement work. The ARC building connects both Stocker Center and Irvine Hall, making it easy for collaborating researchers to work together. Already at the forefront of diabetes and cancer research and drug development, specialized research-designated floors, with ‚Äúsuite-style‚Äù laboratories encourage further breakthroughs and even more biotechnological work. Ten researchers from the Russ College and OU-COM tackle major health and technology issues in the 22 laboratory spaces, with one floor devoted to diabetes research and one floor devoted to cancer research. There are also additional laboratories set aside for the recruitment of further research talents to Ohio University. The building has 13 classrooms. The Academic and Research Center now contains all of the Russ College's learning space. The architecture and interior design were developed with collaboration in mind. Almost all of the furniture in the ARC is mobile, easily creating group spaces, and smaller study nooks with comfortable chairs and tables distributed throughout the building.

It was constructed in 1941 to physically separate Black and white homeowners on the sole basis of race. The wall no longer serves to racially segregate homeowners and, as of 1971, both sides of the barrier have been predominately Black. The wall begins across the street from the northern boundary of Van Antwerp Park, on Pembroke Avenue between Birwood and Mendota streets. It extends north until just south of 8 Mile Road. An exposed stretch of the wall with no homes to the east runs through Alfonso Wells Memorial Playground, between Chippewa Avenue and Norfolk Street. Community activists and Detroit residents collaborated in 2006 to turn this portion of the wall into a mural. Paintings have depicted, for example, neighborhood children blowing bubbles, a group of a cappella singers, Rosa Parks's boarding the bus signifying her contribution to the Civil Rights Movement, and citizens protesting for equitable housing policy. Background The Detroit Wall shortly after construction in 1941 The World War I industrial economy of Detroit afforded opportunities for women and Black men to become more active participants in the labor force of the city. A large percentage of white men were drafted to fight in the war, leaving many of their jobs vacant and needing to be filled. This allowed Black citizens to fill empty job positions, causing a large demographic shift in the makeup of the Detroit workforce. In light of more job opportunities, the city experienced an increase in the population of Black people seeking economic and social mobility. But as white men were returning from war and more Black citizens entered the city, competition for scarce housing increased tensions between the two groups. White residents took over most private-sector housing, pushing Black residents to less desirable areas of the city. The Great Depression furthered the scarcity of housing as the population continued to soar. The New Deal legislation implemented under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt intended to make private housing more accessible to citizens. The Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) was created in 1933, followed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). In short, these programs reduced barriers to housing by offering discounted payment plans spread out over 20-30 years. These policies significantly improved home-ownership accessibility for working-class white Detroit residents and promoted single-family units. Yet according to Thomas J. Sugrue, a Detroit scholar and historian, Black residents did not benefit from the New Deal era of legislation because \\"local governments had the final say over the expenditure over the federal funds, the location of projects, and the type constructed.\\" As a result of local government bodies being composed of white politicians, white residents received federal funding, while Black residents were left to seek housing with no aid. The primary concern of white Detroit residents was maintaining racial homogeneity. Local policies allowed for the prevention of Black \\"infiltration\\" into white neighborhoods due in part to the HOLC members serving as federal appraisers. They identified areas that were \\"safe\\" for banks to issue loans to by giving each neighborhood a rating: A, B, C, or D. An \\"A,\\" or \\"green,\\" was practically guaranteed a loan, largely due to the fact that these areas were homogeneously white and affluent. In turn, a \\"D,\\" or \\"red,\\" neighborhood was occupied by Black residents who were systematically prevented from receiving a loan. This became a phenomenon across the United States known as red-lining. In Detroit specifically, red-lining preserved racial homogeneity and increased racial tensions. For example, if a Black family moved into a white neighborhood, the rating of the neighborhood would change and everyone‚Äôs property value would decrease, creating resentment among the two communities. Between 1930 and 1950, three out of five homes purchased in the United States were financed by FHA, yet less than two percent of the FHA loans were made to non-white home buyers. Without any financial aid, Black neighborhoods became starkly different than white neighborhoods. Renovations, purchasing homes, and rent in these areas were far too expensive to afford, causing deterioration in these areas and overall lower living standards. The appearance of Black neighborhoods solidified white resident's opinions that Black residents were a detriment to any neighborhood. Thomas J. Sugrue wrote, ‚Äúthe decaying neighborhoods offered seemingly convincing evidence to white homeowners that blacks were feckless and irresponsible and fueled white fears that blacks would ruin any neighborhood that they moved into.‚Äù Additionally, the New Deal was perceived differently by the federal and local level. In Detroit, these policies caused debates between public housing and private home-ownership, two commodities that those living in Detroit believed could not work together. These debates were often racial, with public housing aimed to help Black people in the city and private home-ownership aimed at helping middle class white people become homeowners. The debate over public housing was centered around the belief that such an idea would threaten the private sector. Affordable living for the lower class, usually minorities, meant interference with a successful, free market real estate. Community groups determined to keep their neighborhoods segregated lobbied against public housing projects, and contractors found business working in private housing. The 8-mile Wyoming neighborhood, where this wall is located, was one of many that was significantly affected by the housing crisis. This neighborhood is located outside the city and was described as a farmland where residents pooled resources in order to build their own homes. The houses were small, but the residents were proud of their homes they built up from nothing. In 1938, the Detroit Housing Commission conducted a survey and found residents living here to be among the poorest in Detroit. Despite this, the residents of this neighborhood were both independent and secure with over 90% of residents living in these single family built homes. Eight Mile Community and Construction Due to redlining, the Eight Mile area was extremely poor and was considered a \\"blighted area\\". After World War II, a developer saw the area as a new spot to construct an all-white subdivision. HOLC appraisers viewed this as high-risk because of how close it was to the neighborhood occupied by Black people. FHA, as a result, was unable and unwilling to lend out loans for home construction. Sugrue reports, \\"the developer worked out a compromise with the FHA, garnering loans and mortgage guarantees in exchange for the construction of a foot-thick, six-foot-high wall, running for a half-mile on the property line separating the Black and white neighborhoods.\\" Contractors and realtors were able to attract whites to this area because the wall would \\"protect them\\". It served to keep property values high and to keep the neighborhoods racially segregated. It became known as the Detroit Eight Mile Wall, the \\"Detroit Wailing Wall\\", and the Birwood Wall.  Wall Today  The wall still stands in the Eight Mile area to this day. The Wall‚Äôs function has transformed from being a racial barrier to a backyard fence and mural for the current residents of this community. The residents are aware that the Wall was originally meant to be racially divisive, but now Black people live on both sides of it. In 2006, a portion of the Wall was converted into a mural by Detroit residents and community activists. It serves as a reminder and recognition of history, but also of a hopeful, more colorful future.

It aired on Fox in the United States on January 27, 2013. Plot Tina decides to audition for the Wagstaff School News, a school news program taught by Mr. Grant the Video Comm Teacher. When Tammy, her former icon/best friend from \\"Bad Tina,\\" manipulates Tina into talking excessively slower than usual, she ends up as Staff Intern, making Tammy the anchor, Andy and Ollie Pesto the field reporters, and Zeke the sports broadcaster. When she sees that the Wagstaff School News is all about gossip instead of expected news, she is left with no choice until she finds out about a series of defecations committed by a \\"serial pooper,\\" classified by her as the \\"Mad Pooper,\\" but to Linda as \\"The Butt-ler.\\" As a result of this, she makes her own newscast called Tina News to share to the public about the Mad Pooper, drawing more attention to Tina News than the Wagstaff School News, angering Mr. Grant and Tammy. When the WSN makes a reenactment showing Tammy dressed up as Tina taking a \\"#2 in the library,\\" the whole school believes that the culprit is Tina, resulting in her being sent to the principal's office. Though when Tina believes that the Mad Pooper will strike at the anti-smoking assembly in the gymnasium, Louise distracts the school secretary, Tina makes a run for it and confronts the Mad Pooper, who is revealed to be nobody else than Zeke. He claims he was responsible for being the Mad Pooper so he could stimulate the attention towards Tina News and then poops in the gymnasium. Louise, who also is in the gym, pushes Tammy towards the falling turd, but it doesn't strike her. Back at the Wagstaff School News, Tammy hails Louise as a hero \\"for saving her hair\\" and claims that Zeke \\"is not in trouble because his family moves around a lot.\\" Mr. Grant, on behalf of the WSN, apologizes to Tina for making the school think that she was the Mad Pooper and presents a new WSN special, the Tina Table, hosted by Tina herself. Meanwhile, Louise tricks Gene into thinking that he will grow up to look like Bob, so she makes him look like Bob, making Linda impressed and Bob feeling impersonated. Over the next few days Gene continues to copy his father, further angering and annoying Bob and making him feel more impersonated. When the Belchers run to the anti-smoking assembly after being called to the school (because Tina was sent to the principal due to the accusations made by the WSN), Gene changes back into his own self due to his ambition of seeing someone poop in the school, resulting in Bob being glad that he is normal again and Linda sad because she will miss her \\"muppet baby Bobby.\\" Reception Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A‚Äì, saying \\"Here's the thing: Tina's plot hinges on Louise being smart about everything and equally willing to cause trouble. She can't record her investigations without a camera‚Äîwhich is uncovered by Louise. She can't get airtime without Louise's semi-accidental skill at blackmail. And she can't get away from the principal's office without Louise getting in trouble to get there then springing Tina with expert manipulation.

Phylogenetically Aphroditeola is classified in the Agaricales near the Hygrophoraceae. Little is known about its biology except that the type species can be grown in culture from basidiospores and it produces pinkish to reddish-orange mycelium. In other literature and web sites the type species is called by synonymous names Hygrophoropsis morganii or Hygrophoropsis olida or incorrectly labelled Hygrophoropsis rufescens, a misapplied name.

He was probably a friend of Dante Alighieri who made him into the main character of the 2nd canto of the Purgatorio (the second part of the Divine Comedy). All that is positively known about him is what is found in Dante's work and it has been impossible to identify him with absolute certainty with any of the Casellas named in contemporary documents. To whatever is said of him in Dante's work one can add (with some degree of probability) information furnished by the earliest commentators of the Divine Comedy: Pietro di Dante, Benvenuto da Imola, Buti and Landino give him as being born in Florence, while an anonymous early commentary of the Divine Comedy gives him as being born in Pistoia. Mentions of this Casella in documents probably include a mention (Casella dedit sonum, i.e. \\"Casella set [this] to music\\") in Codex Vaticano 3214 that he set to music a madrigal by Lemmo da Pistoia, and a mention of him in a sonnet by Niccol√≤ de' Rossi. From what is said of him in Purgatorio, 2nd canto, it appears that he was a friend of Dante, that he died before 1300 and that he set to music poetry by Dante himself, namely the canzone Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona found in Dante's Convivio and possibly some other short poems by Dante, and from specifically line 107 in the 2nd canto, it may be possible to infer that the amoroso canto (\\"amorous song\\") that Dante connects with Casella is a specific indication that Casella's music was (at least in part) in the monodic style which accompanied Occitan lyric poems, or Italian lyric poems in the Occitan manner.

Though deployed at different times in support of Federal operations in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi, the majority of its combat service took place in Arkansas. During the ill-fated Camden Expedition (part of Nathaniel Banks' Red River Campaign), it was one of three infantry regiments that, along with the Thirty-sixth Iowa and Seventy- seventh Ohio infantry, comprised the 2nd Brigade of the Third Division commanded by General Frederick Salomon. This division and brigade formed part of the Union VII Corps under Major-General Frederick Steele. A sizable portion of the regiment was killed or captured at the Battle of Marks' Mills on 25 April 1864; the prisoners were sent south to Camp Ford in Tyler, Texas, where eleven of them perished.McLean, pg.33. The remaining elements were transferred northward, and ended their wartime service guarding Confederate prisoners-of- war at Camp Morton in their own home state.National Park Service‚ÄîCivil War Regiments database Due to the relative lack of large-scale engagements in the areas where it was deployed, the 43rd did not fight in many battles, nor did it suffer large combat losses during the war. A total of two officers and 41 enlisted men are recorded as having been killed or mortally wounded during the conflict, while five officers and 200 men perished due to disease.National Park Service ‚Äì 43rd Indiana Infantry In addition, 121 were recorded as deserting, while 285 were unaccounted for.Wesley Wilshire Norris. Initial organization An 1855 map of Indiana. The counties from which the 43rd was recruited were located in the west central part of the state. The 43rd Indiana was created on 11 September 1861 at Camp Vigo in Terre Haute, Indiana by order of Governor Oliver P. Morton, who commissioned William E. McLean as lieutenant colonel of the regiment, with orders to organize it and prepare it for duty.McLean, pg. 6. Fourteen companies were raised, and George K. Steele of Rockville was appointed colonel. However, Steele's advanced age and physical infirmities led him to resign in January 1862, upon which McLean was promoted to colonel and given overall command of the regiment, which he would retain until the end of the war.McLean, pg. 8. McLean was given a brigade command that included the 43rd and two other regiments during the Camden Expedition, but he reports that he retained formal command of the regiment until the end of the warthough day-to-day command passed to Major Wesley W. Norris. The regiment was formally mustered in for Federal service on 27 September 1861.Civil War Archive ‚Äì 43rd Indiana Its original strength was 985 officers and men; these would be augmented over the next four years by 1154 recruits, with 165 veterans reenlisting. Four of the fourteen initial companies were allotted to the newly formed 31st Indiana; the remaining units of the 43rd, together with the counties from which they were recruited, were:43rd Indiana Infantry RosterMcLean, pp.37‚Äì41. *Co.

According to Colonel McLean, the men who joined the 43rd were \\"probably not Sabbath School or YMCA models,\\" but nor were they the \\"coarse combination of the fighting devil and the jolly, boisterous rowdy\\" that he said were created by \\"Miss Nancy novelists\\" after the war to sell the stories they wrote about it.McLean, pg. 7. He went on to describe the men of his regiment in these terms: Private James Gilmore of Co. H, who would go on to a distinguished local legal career after the war, offers this portrait of \\"the reckless disregard\\" displayed by some of his regimental comrades‚Äîlike soldiers of all ages‚Äî\\"for the moral precepts taught [them] in [their] youth:\\" Early actions On 12 October 1861, the 43rd Indiana left Camp Vigo for Spottsville, Kentucky, where it briefly joined Brigadier General Thomas Crittenden's 5th Division (14th Brigade) in the Army of the Ohio.McLean, pp. 8‚Äì9. While there, it guarded the locks on the Green River from local Confederate sympathizers, but saw no combat.McLean, pg. 76. The 43rd was next transferred to then-Brigadier General John Pope's new Army of the Mississippi, where it was brigaded with the 46th Indiana in the second brigade of Brigadier General John Palmer's third divisionORA I, vol. 8, pg. 2. after briefly being assigned to the second division. It was present for the attack on New Madrid and the taking of Island No. 10. The regiment was part of a night march from New Madrid to Point Pleasant in New Madrid County, Missouri, with most of its soldiers detailed to drag a 32-pound Parrott Gun‚Äîweighing about 4,200 pounds‚Äîas part of the siege operations to be conducted there.McLean, pg. 10. Veterans of the regiment would later credit this event with causing the 'premature physical decay of many of the very best men of the regiment.' Following the capture of Island No. 10, the Second Brigade (the 43rd and 46th Indiana Regiments) was ordered to cooperate with the Mississippi River Squadron of the Federal Navy, operating on the Mississippi River under the command of Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote in operations against Fort Pillow.McLean, pp. 10‚Äì11. They took up positions around the fort for five weeks, during which time not one weapon was fired in anger by either regiment,McLean, pg. 11. until the Confederates were compelled to evacuate on 3‚Äì5 June 1862.Civil War Online Occupation of Memphis The fall of Ft. Pillow left the Mississippi River open as far south as Memphis, Tennessee, which was occupied by Federal forces after a naval battle on the river adjacent to the city. The 43rd and 46th Indiana were the first two Union regiments to enter Memphis,McLean, pg. 12. where they reported a 'pleasant, if not cordial' reception, despite 'a few sullen looks from some of the more radical of its population.' After two weeks of occupation duty, the two regiments were replaced by other Federal troops, and the 43rd was ordered to Helena, Arkansas. Action in Arkansas Hindman Hill, successfully defended by the 43rd Indiana and other Federal units during the Battle of Helena =Early movements= Up to this point, the 43rd Indian had not seen any real action, but this was about to change. Upon their arrival in Arkansas, the regiment was ordered to move up the White River, where a few insignificant skirmishes were fought with local Confederate militia. While camped at Clarendon, some unarmed, swimming soldiers of the 43rd were sniped at from the woods across the river. After their comrades returned fire with no discernible effect, the Hoosiers retaliated for the incident by taking every piece of furniture from each house in the village, which they then chopped up and used for firewood.McLean, pg. 106. After joining Leonard F. Ross's abortive Yazoo Pass Expedition in Mississippi in early 1863 (where marshy ground prevented the regiment‚Äîor any Federal Army units‚Äîfrom playing any significant role), the regiment returned to duty in Arkansas, where it would meet its first great test.McLean, pp. 12‚Äì13. =Battle of Helena= Helena, Arkansas was a town on the Mississippi River that served as headquarters for the Federal military District of Eastern Arkansas. Initially occupied by 20,000 Union troops and heavily fortified, the town's defenses were badly denuded when four-fifths of the garrison was reassigned to operations around Vicksburg, Mississippi. With only 4000 Federal troops left to defend the city, Helena proved a tempting target for Confederate forces under Lieutenant General Theophilus H. Holmes.Battle of Helena, Arkansas Holmes resolved to attack it, in part to relieve pressure on the vital Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg, and also to prevent the city from being used as a staging ground for any further incursions into Arkansas. With Colonel McLean having been promoted to command of the First Brigade in Brigadier General Frederick C. Salomon's Thirteenth Division, command of the regiment during the battle passed to Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Major.Order of Battle, Battle of Helena Holmes launched his attack at daybreak on 4 July 1863, apparently unaware that Vicksburg was surrendering to Union General Ulysses Grant that same day. During the battle, the 43rd was stationed to the southwest of town, amidst the substantial fortifications of Hindman Hill, where it faced attacking troops of Brigadier General James F. Fagan's Second Brigade of Sterling Price's Division. A misunderstanding of Holmes' orders caused Fagan to attack at first light, a full hour before the rest of his division became engaged. Felled trees prevented his artillery from coming up to support his attack, with the result that the Confederates were forced to advance into the face of murderous Federal rifle and cannon fire, including that of the 43rd. Despite this, Fagan's men managed to take the outer trenches, but were then stopped cold and forced to withdraw by 10:30 AM together with the remainder of the attacking force, leaving the Union in control of Helena.Battle of Helena Casualties for the regiment totalled three killed and six wounded.Statement of Casualties in 1st Brigade: 43rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry. Following the battle, the 43rd Indiana was mentioned in dispatches by the Commanding General of all Federal forces at Helena, General Prentiss, for its \\"very efficient service on the left wing of the center.\\"McLean, pg. 122. In a speech given four days later, Col. McLean told his regiment: \\"the Rebels came to get Helena, but succeeded in only getting hell.\\"McLean, pg. 14. =Capture of the 37th Arkansas Regiment= The flag of the 37th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, captured at the Battle of Helena One of the Confederate regiments involved in Fagan's attack on Hindman Hill during the Battle of Helena was the 37th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, which had previously been the 29th Arkansas. During the Confederate withdrawal, elements of the 43rd Indiana, together with elements of the 33rd Iowa and the 33rd Missouri, managed to capture nearly the entire 37th Arkansas.McLean, pp. 14‚Äì15. McLean gives the entire credit to his own regiment (naturally!), but other reports indicate that the 33rd Iowa and 33rd Missouri were equally involved. Lieutenant-Colonel William H. Heath, commanding the 33rd Missouri, reported:Howerton, Brian This testimony was given by Lieutenant-Colonel Cyrus H. Mackey, commanding the 33rd Iowa: Brigade commander Col. Samuel A. Rice (of the 33rd Iowa) never credited any specific unit with the taking of the 37th Arkansas, but the captured colors were credited to his own regiment. Major General Frederick Steele =Capture of Little Rock= Not long after the Battle of Helena, Major General Benjamin Prentiss, commanding the Union forces in Arkansas, was replaced by Major General Frederick Steele; his force was renamed the Army of Arkansas. Steele, a seasoned and competent officer who had acquitted himself well under General William T. Sherman's command on the Vicksburg Campaign, immediately set out to capture the Arkansas state capital at Little Rock. Moving west, the Federal army brushed aside Confederate resistance at the Battle of Bayou Fourche (sometimes called the Battle of Little Rock), and occupied Little Rock on 10 September 1863.McLean, pp. 15‚Äì16.National Park Service Battle Summary ‚Äì Battle of Bayo Fource The Camden Expedition =Initial movements= In early 1864, General Grant (who had assumed overall command of all Federal forces) decided to implement a strategy of simultaneous movement against the Confederates on several fronts, from Virginia to Texas. The portion of this assault involving Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas was called the Red River Campaign. The plan called for two separate armies to move simultaneously toward Shreveport, Louisiana, one from the northwest and the other from the southeast. Steele's Army of Arkansas (the smaller of the two) was to move southwest from Little Rock, while a much larger force under Major General Nathaniel P. Banks was to advance up the Red River itself, from New Orleans. The two groups were to link up in Shreveport and advance into Texas, in an effort to take that state out of the war.McLean, pp. 16‚Äì18. The Arkansas portion of this campaign was named the Camden Expedition, and it got underway on 23 March 1864 with Steele's departure from the Little Rock Arsenal.Baker, pp. 4. Steele's force initially consisted of the 3rd Division of the VII Corps (including the 43rd Indiana) and two cavalry brigades, totaling about 6,800 menBaker, pg. 4. and 76 pieces of artillery.McLain, pg. 30. The 43rd was part of the Second Brigade of Brigadier General Salomon's Third Division, and its brigade commander was its own Colonel McLean. Two other regiments were included in the Second Brigade: the 36th Iowa Infantry and the 77th Ohio Infantry.Forsythe. Steele's first objective was Arkadelphia, Arkansas, which he reached on 29 March. He had ordered Brigadier General John M. Thayer and his 3600 Federals from Fort Smith to join him there, but Thayer failed to arrive on schedule.Baker, pp. 4‚Äì5. With his limited rations dwindling, Steele chose to push on in the direction of Camden, where he planned to wait for Thayer, resupply his forces, then continue toward Shreveport.McLean, pg. 18. The Federals were initially opposed by Major General Sterling Price, a Confederate commander from Missouri whom they had previously fought at Helena and who had subsequently been placed in charge of all Southern forces in Arkansas.Baker, pg. 5. At this point in the campaign, Price had three cavalry divisions at his disposal containing a total of eight brigades; these were led by three top-noch, battle-hardened commanders: Brigadier Generals John S. Marmaduke, James Fagan and Samuel Maxey. The brigades, while under their assigned strength, were composed largely of seasoned veterans and were well- trained. =Battle of Elkin's Ferry= Elkin's Ferry battle site After tiring of waiting for Thayer to arrive at Arkadelphia, Steele left for Camden on 1 April. He first advanced toward the Little Missouri River in southwest Arkansas. Finding all the bridges destroyed, and being harried by Brigadier General William Cabell's cavalry (which had joined Price's army), Steele ordered Salomon's Third Division to take and hold a to seize a ford known as Elkin's Ferry on the afternoon of 2 April 1864. Salomon in turn tasked the 2nd Brigade commanded by Colonel William McLean of the 43rd Indiana with this objective. McLean initially ordered the entire 36th Iowa Volunteer Infantry, augmented by two companies of the 43rd Indiana across to the south shore. A 2-gun section of 6-pound guns commanded by Lieutenant Charles Peetz of Battery E, 2nd Missouri Light Artillery Battery was also sent across that evening. The 36th Iowa had been the lead division in the 2nd Brigade's marching echelon on that day, and it was thus chosen to cross first, however elements of the 1st Iowa Cavalry had arrived at the crossing well in advance of the 2nd Brigade in mid-afternoon and had moved to the south shore to set up a dismounted picket line a mile and a quarter south from the ford. Three companies of the 36th Iowa‚ÄîA, D and Gdeployed forward a considerable distance from their regiment, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel F.M. Drake and, as nightfall descended, these companies were ordered to sleep on their arms in that forward position. Following a forced march, the 43rd arrived at the crossing after dark that evening.McLean, pp. 18‚Äì19, Baker, pg. 6, Drake, The Campaign of General Steele, Iowa Commandery, Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, 1893 The morning of April 3 was quiet at the ford and a party of officers and men from the 36th Iowa were ordered out to forage for meat or game, as the entire VII Corps had been placed on a meager issue of half- rations since leaving Little Rock. Returning with 50 small pigs, they spent a quiet morning butchering and distributing the pork to the men. At 1 pm, firing was heard to the front, and as it grew steadily louder, it was clear to Drake at his advance position that a general assault was in progress. At this point McLean ordered a full retreat of his brigade from the south shore, except for 3 companies of the 43rd Indiana. Colonel Charles Kittredge, commanding the 36th Iowa‚Äîand Drake's superior‚Äîcomplied with McLean's retreat order, taking the balance of his regiment, 7 companies, to the north shore, and sending a messenger to Drake to do the same. When Drake received the order to pull back, he believed it was not an advisable action under the circumstances and gave the order for Companies A, D and G to \\"Stand Fast!\\" Advancing on a personal reconnaissance, Drake discovered the 1st Iowa troopers fully engaged in a hot skirmish a full mile and a quarter from the river. Ordering his 3 companies forward, he directed the 1st Iowa cavalrymen to drop back and join his own firing line. Drake saw that a strong enemy force was in front, and this was confirmed when a Confederate officer rode forward to surrender to Drake under a white flag. Drake ordered a cease fire until the deserter rode across. Realizing he had known the officer before the war, Drake learned from him tha he was an aide to rebel General John Marmaduke, and that Marmaduke was present on the field with 2,500 rebel troops. A very hot fight soon resumed, and after two hours the Iowans were driven back only about 80 feet. Drake and his three companies, augmented by three companies of the 43rd Indiana‚Äîno more than 600 men‚Äîsuccessfully repulsed the Confederate assault on April 3. Late in the day Marmaduke sent a force through the dense woods to Drake's left in a flanking attempt. Drake ordered the three companies of the 43rd Indian to the left too meet the enemy flanking move and the Indianans repulsed the enemy with heavy enemy losses. Upon reaching his objective, McLean immediately ordered a squadron of cavalry to cross the shallow river and serve as an advance picket to warn of any Confederate movements toward the river. Sure enough, three cavalry brigades under General Marmaduke‚Äîabout 7500 troopers altogether‚Äîarrived during the night and prepared to assault the Federals at dawn. Marmaduke ordered Brigadier General Joseph Shelby to lead the attack.Baker, pg. 6. In his after-action report, Colonel McLean reported that the enemy probed his lines during the early morning hours; McLean countered by ordering four companies of the 43rd to cross the river and advance into the timber, driving the enemy pickets back while additional elements of the 43rd, supported by the 36th Iowa, crossed behind them and took up positions along the road leading away from the crossing. At 6:00 a.m. on the morning of the 4th, the 43rd and 36th were attacked by Marmaduke's brigade. Though heavily outnumbered, they resisted for two hours before falling back upon their reserves at the ford. McLean's call for reinforcements was met by two additional regiments (the 29th Iowa and the 9th Wisconsin), but before they could be deployed on the battlefield, the enemy withdrew.McLean, pp. 19‚Äì21. Total losses for both sides were slight, with 38 casualties on the Union side, compared to 54 for the ConfederatesNational Park Service Battle Description (including 18 killedMcLean, pg. 21.). =Battle of Prairie D'Ane= After its victory at Elkin's Ferry, the Army of Arkansas‚Äîincluding the 43rd Indiana‚Äîwas joined by Thayer's division, which had finally caught up with them on the 9th.Baker, pg. 7. This combined force (now totaling about 10,400 effectives) emerged from the forest into an open prairie about 30 square miles in area, known as Prairie D'Ane. To the west lay Washington, the Confederate capital of Arkansas; to the south was the Red River and Shreveport, while the fortified town of Camden sat to the east. Since the 43rd had spearheaded the assault on Elkins' Ferry, Steele relegated it to rear-guard duties during this phase of his army's movement. Upon entering the prairie, Steele found Marmaduke waiting for him. Guarding the approaches to Washington, the Confederate general had thrown up breastworks in an attempt to delay the oncoming Federals until his commander, General Price, could arrive with the rest of their army. Price had been reinforced by the arrival of Brigadier General Richard Gano's cavalry brigade from the Indian Territory (Oklahoma). The two sides engaged on 10 April, with the Third Brigade driving the Rebels back about a mile before being stopped. The 43rd Indiana did not arrive on the battlefield until after midnight on the 11th, just in time to join a night battle‚Äîa rare event during the Civil War‚Äîin which Shelby's Southerners assaulted the Federals, without success.Baker, pg. 8. Inconclusive skirmishing continued over the next two days. Believing that Steele intended to capture Washington, Price withdrew most of his forces in the direction of that town; when he realized that the Federals were heading for Camden, instead, he returned to Prairie D'Ane and launched a counterattack on Thayer's division (which was serving as Steele's rearguard) on the 13th. After a four-hour contest, the Confederates were forced to withdraw, and Steele proceeded to occupy Camden after a brief skirmish with Confederate forces there.Battle of Prairie D'AneBaker, pg. 9. =Poison Spring= Upon arriving in Camden, Steele did not find the supplies he had hoped to secure, so he sent 1250 of his men (not including the 43rd) on a foraging expedition to nearby Britton's Mill. There they found a large quantity of corn (supplemented, according to local histories, with items taken from nearby farms and houses),Wilson's Raid Before Poison Springs but were ambushed by a sizable Confederate force while transporting it to Camden; the foraging party barely escaped, minus the badly needed food and most of their horses and wagons.Baker, pp. 10‚Äì14. Further bad news followed: Steele learned that General Banks had been decisively defeated in Louisiana, and was now in full retreat toward New Orleans.McLean, pg. 24. This left Lieutenant General Kirby Smith, commanding all Rebel forces west of the Mississippi River, free to concentrate on Steele's relatively small army, which was trapped deep in enemy territory amidst the snake-infested swamps and forests of south-central Arkansas. Smith accordingly moved three divisions of infantry toward Camden, intending to combine them with Price's forces to drive Steele from Arkansas and perhaps even change the course of the war.Baker, pg. 10. Although Steele was aware of the precarious position he was in, he was determined to hold Camden for as long as he could, in an effort to salvage something from his campaign.Baker, pg. 14. On 19 April Smith and his reinforcements arrived at Woodlawn; the newly combined Southern army‚Äînow under Smith's direct command‚Äînumbered almost 20,000 men, nearly double Steele's force, and was now poised to attack Camden and destroy the Federal Army of Arkansas.Baker, pg. 15. Smith immediately ordered Generals Price and Fagan to deploy 4000 cavalry between Camden and Little Rock, to cut off the only route of retreat for Steele. The Confederates set out on 19 April, but news soon reached them that caused them to disobey their orders and turn toward a tiny crossroad named Mark's Mills, instead‚Äîresulting in disaster for the 43rd Indiana, but leading to the salvation of the rest of the Federal force. =Disaster at Mark's Mills= Mark's Mill, just above the village of Edinburg (now New Edinburg) Running desperately low on supplies, Steele turned to the small Federal base at Pine Bluff, about 35 miles from Camden,McLean, pg. 42. as the last remaining source of food for his forces. He accordingly ordered the 43rd Indiana (then down to about 400 men),McLean, pg. 48. together with three other regiments and additional cavalry and artillery (around 1800 men in all), to take 400 wagons there on 23 April for supplies.McLean, pg. 42, 48. Col. McLean was on a duty assignment at Camden, so command of the regiment fell to Major Wesley W. Norris. The 43rd took the lead, with the wagon train stretching more than a mile along muddy forest roads. Encountering muddy ground along the rain-swollen Morrow River, expedition leader Lieutenant Colonel Francis Drake of the 36th Iowa chose not to push through the mire to Pine Bluff, and instead camped about eight miles outside of town. He did so unaware that two brigades of Price's cavalry with over 4000 troopers were nearby.McLean, pg. 22. Though Norris tried to warn Drake of movement in the woods to his front during the night, Drake laughed off his concerns and told Norris‚Äîa combat veteran of the Mexican War‚Äîthat he \\"got scared too easily.\\" Early on the morning of 25 April 1864, following a difficult crossing of the Moro, the 43rd and its sister units resumed their march toward Pine Bluff. Soon the 43rd encountered several abandoned Confederate campsites to their front, but reports of a large Confederate presence in the area were discounted by Drake, who \\"roundly\\" cursed Major Norris and ordered the regiment to pick up its pace.McLean, pp. 42‚Äì43. As the 43rd emerged into a small clearing known as Mark's Mills, it was attacked by Fagan's dismounted brigade, including the 1st Arkansas Cavalry.Baker, pg. 17. The Hoosiers drove the Southerners back, but were quickly hit on their right flank by additional Confederates under the command of Brigadier General William Cabell. The 43rd, supported by the 36th Iowa, now found itself facing the 1st Arkansas, together with the 2nd Arkansas and Thomas M. Gunter's cavalry battalion. The 43rd and 36th were forced back toward a few log cabins in the center of the clearing, where their artillery raked the oncoming Southerners and was blasted in return by Hugely's Arkansas Battery. Just when it seemed that things could not get worse, the 43rd and 36th were now hit on their left flank by Jo Shelby's cavalry, and found themselves fighting an overwhelming force (outnumbering them two-to-one) attacking from three directions at once. Of the 33 members of the 43rd's Co. G who went into the fight, 23 were killed or wounded within the first thirty minutes.McLean, pg. 49. Despite valliant efforts by the 77th Ohio and the 1st Iowa Cavalry to prevent the ensuing encirclement, the Federals found themselves surrounded in the clearing and fighting for their lives. The battle lasted for four hours altogether, until they were finally compelled to surrender. One supporting artillery battery was reportedly wiped out to the last man, with its mortally wounded lieutenant firing a final gun into the oncoming Rebels before succumbing to his injuries.McLean, pg. 49. McLean says that the battery was wiped out, but Baker says they (assuming both were talking about the same battery) were forced to take cover under some log cabins, where they were later captured by the Confederates. Baker, pg. 18. According to Sergeant John Moss of Co. G, the regiment did not give up en masse; rather, continual charges by the Southerners resulted in the capture of small numbers of men each time, until only about 50 of the 43rd remained who had not been killed, wounded, run off or captured. When asked by these last remaining troops to surrender them, Norris refused, saying he would never surrender anyone but himself‚Äîand that only if he was forced to. He and the others made for the woods, but Norris' horse was shot out from under him and he lost a boot; he and his comrades were finally forced to give up only 100 yards from Shelby's command.McLean, pg. 49‚Äì50, 118. 211 members of the 43rd were taken prisoner; others managed to escape and made their way back to Steele's main force.McLean, pp. 22‚Äì23. =Aftermath of the battle= The 43rd Indiana's regimental history tells of a Federal paymaster with over $175,000 in Greenbacks among those captured at Mark's Mills; the money fell into Confederate hands, and was allegedly used by Southern authorities in a futile attempt to purchase the freedom of Confederate prisoners confined in Chicago, Illinois.McLean, pg. 23. The captured prisoners were robbed of their personal effects, and many were stripped and forced to march into captivity completely naked.McLean, pg. 50. The Confederates left the Union dead on the field for three days before any attempt was made to bury them, while several African American civilians accompanying the column were shot down in cold blood after the battle.Arkansas Encyclopedia ‚Äì Battle of Mark's Mills. See also Baker, pg. 18. The prisoners were marched south to Camp Ford in Tyler, Texas, where many died before the whole group was released in 1865. Although Colonel Drake would later go on to a successful political career in his home state of Iowa, including winning the Governorship of that state, the regimental historian of the 36th Iowa wrote that the men of the 43rd Indiana held him in supreme contempt long after the war, for \\"leading them straight into ambush by his dithering indecisiveness\\" at Mark's Mills.History of the 36th Iowa Infantry Regiment, under \\"Post Script\\". Confederate General Cabell paid tribute to the courage and tenacity exhibited by his enemies during the battle. \\"[My] men,\\" he wrote, \\"never fought better. They whipped the best infantry regiments that the enemy had‚Äî'old Veterans', as they were called... The killed and wounded of Cabells Brigade shows how stubborn the enemy was, and how reluctantly they gave up the train.\\"After-Action Report of General Cabel . Nevertheless, the debacle at Mark's Mills is considered by some historians to be the worst defeat ever suffered by Federal forces west of the Mississippi.Mark's Mills Battle Site , pg. 9. Ironically, the disastrous defeat at Mark's Mills was credited with saving the remainder of Steele's army from annihilation. Fagan and Shelby had been ordered to get between Steele's force and its original base at Little Rock; had they done so, there is no question that their overwhelming numbers, combined with additional units advancing under their commander Kirby Smith, would have surrounded Steele and compelled his destruction or surrender. By disobeying their orders and engaging Drake's brigade at Mark's Mills, Shelby and Fagan caused a delay in the Rebel advance that proved to be just long enough for Steele to evacuate Camden (which he did, immediately after hearing of the disaster his forces had suffered) and lead the battered remnants of his Army of Arkansas to safety.McLean, pg. 24, 52. =Camp Ford, Texas= Lithograph of Camp Ford in Tyler, Texas, drawn by James Mc'Lain, a former prisoner of war in the camp In the regimental history, Sgt. Moss relates that the captured members of the 43rd Indiana were taken together with the remaining prisoners to Camden, which Steele had evacuated the previous day. There they were housed in an old cotton barn, under the command of a Confederate Major named Hill, whom Moss credited with being a \\"gentlemen, and treated us the best he could under the circumstances.\\"McLean, pg. 53. The prisoners were marched first to Shreveport, then to Tyler, Texas, home to Camp Ford, the main Confederate POW camp for that district. Upon arrival at the prison camp, Moss and the others quickly learned that their new home was an eleven-acre compound surrounded by a log palisade sixteen feet high.Camp Ford ‚Äì History Inside the prison, a line was drawn around the premises ten feet from the fence, called the \\"dead line;\\" anyone crossing that line was subject to be shot by the guards. No barracks of any kind were available, so the Federal prisoners were forced to live and sleep outdoors until the Confederate commandant permitted some of them to gather brush from outside to construct crude shelters. Food rations were issued in the evening, according to Moss, and consisted of corn meal, which was first poured out on a blanket, then distributed with three-quart cups. Cattle were sometimes brought into the enclosure and shot by the guards; the prisoners were issued one axe and three pocketknives to cut up the meat, which was then distributed among them.McLean, pg. 118. Moss reports that he was able to forge passes to leave the camp, which he used to help several of his fellow prisoners escape.McLean, pp. 53‚Äì54. One captured escapee was strung up until he was near death, then let down, revived and then hanged over and over again because he refused to divulge who had helped him escape.McLean, pg. 54. Ultimately, Moss got out of the camp himself, and after several harrowing experiences managed to reach Federal lines in Little Rock, with help from a few Union sympathizers he met along the way.McLean, pp. 55‚Äì70. Upon arrival, he and his companions were taken to General Steele, who 'received us with hospitality' and ordered his commissary to supply them with whatever they needed, after which they were furloughed.McLean, pg. 70. The remaining members of the 43rd who survived Camp Ford were released in 1865 and reunited with their regiment, which had by that time returned to Indiana. =Retreat from Camden= Meanwhile, as the captured members of the 43rd Indiana were being moved to Camp Ford after the Battle of Marks' Mills, the small portion of the regiment that had managed to escape made its way back to Camden, where General Steele now prepared to evacuate the town in great haste. These men were combined with members of the 36th Iowa into a Casual Detachment, under the command of Captain Marmaduke Darnall of the 43rd's Co. B.History of the 36th Iowa Regiment, see under \\"Battle of Jenkins' Ferry\\". Knowing the precariousness of his situation, Steele decided to beat a hasty retreat all the way back to Little Rock, where substantial Federal fortifications and garrison troops could shelter him. First, however, he had to cross the Saline River, which had been flooded by the spring rains, before the Confederates (consisting of Holmes', Walker's, Fagan's, and Shelby's units, plus Smith's own divisions and a newly arrived Texas division under John G. Walker) could stop him. Unknown to Steele, his adversary had already suffered a couple of setbacks. Two of Kirby Smith's cavalry brigades had to be dispatched to Oklahoma to deal with reported Federal threats in that region,Baker, pg. 20. while his other units saw every effort they made to get between the fleeing Federals and the Saline River stymied by the speed of their march or topographical hindrances.Baker, pp. 20‚Äì21. =Battle of Jenkins' Ferry= The site of the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry. At the time of the battle, the river was much wider than this, due to heavy spring rains and flooding. The Federal army reached the Saline at a crossing called Jenkins' Ferry at 2pm on 29 April, with heavy rains turning an already soggy river bottom into a sea of nearly impassable mud. With their regiments and wagon train strung out through the swampy timber along the riverbank, the Federals struggled to erect a pontoon bridge to get their artillery and supply trains to safety. Knowing that he would be unable to cross all his wagon train before dark and that Smith's army was rapidly closing on his position, Steele ordered his men to construct breastworks on the Confederate side of the river, in anticipation of an imminent attack. 4000 Federal troops under Brigadier General Samuel Rice were ordered to man these fortifications, and hold off the Southerners until Steele and the rest of the army could get over. The Federal cavalry and about half of the supply train managed to cross under cover of darkness, but the remainder were still waiting to cross when dawn broke.Baker, pg. 21. In the coming battle, the remnants of the 43rd Indiana would fight under the direct command of General Salomon, Rice's immediate superior. Colonel McLean describes the situation:McLean, pg. 25. The Confederates, having brought up their forces during the night, started their attack before dawn on the morning of 30 April. They quickly found that the Federals were hidden behind strong fortifications with impenetrable timber and swamp on their flanks, leaving only about 400 yards of open ground for the attackers to advance through. The Southern advantage in numbers was largely negated as they were forced to attack with only one brigade at a time; these troops sank up to their knees in muck as they staggered through the thick smoke, fog, pouring rain and murderous Federal fire toward the Union line, with only limited artillery and cavalry support due to the conditions.Baker, pp. 21‚Äì23. Two Confederate Brigadiers were killed and another badly wounded during the assault, while General Rice was also mortally wounded on the Union side.Baker, pg. 23. But his stubborn resistance paid off: by 3:00 pm that afternoon, Steele's army had crossed the Saline with their artillery and supply train, though 900 wagons reportedly had to be left behind.According to McLean, their spokes were all cut, so they would be useless to the Confederates. McLean, pg. 25. Federal infantry and artillery now deployed on the other bank of the river, to protect the rearguard as they crossed in turn; the pontoon bridge was then destroyed behind them, making it impossible for Smith and his Southerners to pursue any further.Baker, pg. 24. Three days later, Steele's tattered remnants limped into the safety of Little Rock; McLean reported that \\"the retreat presented no evidence of order, the troops not marching by companies or in their proper organizations, but every man was apparently animated by the sole purpose to save himself.\\"McLean, pg. 27. Colonel McLean spoke very highly of the courage and fighting skill manifested by the \\"Arkansas Colored Regiment\\" (the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry), which was made up of recently liberated slaves, at Jenkins' Ferry. Admitting that he and others had wondered how these men might perform under fire, McLean spoke glowingly of their \\"cool courage\\" and \\"noble service\\" as they charged \\"with a whoop and a yell\\" against the oncoming Confederates, shouting \\"here comes your Ironclads!\\" as they did so.McLean, pg. 26. According to McLean, total losses for Steele's Army of Arkansas were 5000 men killed, wounded or captured, out of an original force of about 12,000 men. He also lost 2000 wagons to the enemy, together with 5000 horses and mules; out of 76 pieces of artillery Steele started out with, less than six made it back with him to Little Rock.McLean, pg. 30. Baker reports vastly different statistics, crediting the Federals with 10,400 men after Thayer's column reached them at Camden, offset by approximately 2,750 casualties and the loss of 600 wagons and 2500 horses and mules. See Baker, pg. 24. McLean's own 2nd brigade, including the 43rd Indiana, 36th Iowa and 77th Ohio, had less than 300 men fit for duty, after the campaign was over.McLean, pg. 30. Return to Indiana Camp Morton, the final wartime assignment for the 43rd Indiana. =Kentucky= After their return to Little Rock, the remnants of the 43rd Indiana were furloughed for thirty days and sent to Indianapolis, where they were welcomed by Governor Morton and other Indiana notables.McLean, pg. 31. They were asked to delay their trips home to go to Frankfort, Kentucky, to help defend that city against a possible raid by Confederate General John Hunt Morgan. The 43rd accordingly set out for the Bluegrass State, but Morgan's attack failed to materialize, so the 43rd returned to Louisville to await further orders. Near Eminence, Kentucky, the regiment engaged in a slight skirmish with some local guerrillas that would prove to be their last combat of the war.McLean, pg. 32. =Camp Morton= Upon their return to Indiana, the veteran members of the 43rd were allowed to take their furlough, and then they were augmented with fresh recruits and assigned to new duty at Camp Morton in Indianapolis, a Federal prison camp. Here they spent the rest of the war guarding Confederate prisoners, though Colonel McLean repeatedly requested a return to the front for himself and his men‚Äîjust so long as it wasn't Arkansas. Four times, the War Department issued appropriate transfer orders, but each time, Governor Morton and others used their political connections to ensure that the regiment remained where it was. During the Nashville Campaign of Confederate Lieutenant General John Bell Hood, the 43rd volunteered for service with the forces defending Tennessee under General George Thomas, but again, they were ordered to stay at Camp Morton.McLean, pp. 32‚Äì33. In March 1865, the members of the regiment being held at Camp Ford were released, and rejoined the regiment in Indianapolis. On 14 July 1865, the regiment was mustered out of Federal service at Camp Morton, and sent home.McLean, pg. 33. Regimental anecdotes =\\"Foraging\\"= Throughout history, soldiers have told ofttimes humorous tales of their experiences while serving in war, and the men of the 43rd Indiana were no different. Private James Gilmore, of Co. H, shared some anecdotes in the regimental history. He reports, for instance, that some members of the regiment would resort to an elaborate subterfuge in their efforts to augment their rations. While on the march, during mid-afternoon, a private would hand his rifle to one of his companions, then slip silently out of the ranks and disappear. Later, two additional soldiers would drop out from the same company, this time while carrying their rifles. Later that evening, when the regiment went into camp, the three soldiers would reappear, with the first carrying a pig, sheep, chickens or some other food item stolen from local citizens. When stopped by the guards, the two armed soldiers would identify themselves as having just captured a forager, and would be passed through the lines without further ado to take their 'prisoner' to the provost. Needless to say, after much wandering about unsuccessfully 'trying' to find headquarters, the three would simply slip back to their unit, where they and their friends would make quick work of their ill-gotten gains.McLean, pp. 89‚Äì90. =Infantry vs. cavalry= On another occasion, Gilmore reports coming upon some cavalry at a Kentucky plantation, where they had dragged a large piano from the house and one of them was trying to make his horse play it with his hooves. \\"While we were watching this uncalled-for and forbidden piece of vandalism,\\" he writes, \\"there was a sudden commotion among the horsemen.\\" A group of infantrymen from the 43rd had located several bee hives to the rear of the mansion, and had grabbed the bee gums and come running around the side of the house, with bees streaming out of the hives behind them. Dashing straight through the startled troopers, the footsloggers noted with delight that the bees attacked the miscreant horsemen, while they carried off the honeycombs and consumed them at their leisure.McLean, pp. 90‚Äì91, =The beer monopoly= Gillmore reports that instead of establishing a regular canteen, it was the custom in the Federal Army for each regimental commander to designate one man to sell beer to his comrades for a period of time, after which another man would be named to the same position for the same period.McLean, pg. 94. This franchise was highly coveted, as its holder had a chance to make a profit from his monopoly. A certain \\"Joe M.\\" was accordingly designated; he procured a barrel of beer, took it to the back of his tent and set up shop, selling beer for ten cents per glass. One customer objected to this price, informing Joe that he had just bought beer at a different location for only five cents. Outraged (as he was supposed to be the only man selling alcohol at that time), Joe demanded to be taken to see his competitor, upon which he was led outside and behind his tent, where a comrade had cut a small hole through the canvas, tapped the barrel from the outside, and was selling Joe's own beer at five cents per glass. According to Gillmore: \\"that end of the beer saloon was suddenly and effectively closed.\\" =Federal 'coffee' and 'whiskey'= Sadly, not all pranks pulled by members of the 43rd were in good humor. Gillmore reports that certain members of the regiment saw an opportunity to make extra money due to the scarcity of coffee in the South during the Civil War. He reports that soldiers of an entire company would pool their rations of coffee, boil it all until all the liquid had been gotten out of the grains, then keep the coffee for their own use while selling the useless grains (after drying them for a time) to local citizens at the extraordinary price of one dollar per pound. Complaints to regimental officers and provosts were laughed off, said Gillmore, and the whole episode simply \\"winked at\\" by those in authority.McLean, pg. 95. In another episode, three members of the 43rd met up with a local Southerner named \\"Pat,\\" who ran an illegal saloon close to the regimental camp. Considering him to be \\"legitimate prey\\" on account of the exorbitantly high prices he charged for his merchandise, they secretly conspired with him to supply one 40-gallon barrel of stolen whiskey for the price of five dollars per gallon. The soldiers took an empty 40-gallon barrel, filled up a one-quart canteen with whiskey, then fitted the neck of the canteen through the bunghole, hooked a brass faucet to it, and sealed it. They filled the remainder of the barrel with 39 gallons and 3 quarts of water, then took it hurriedly to their unsuspecting partner in crime. Insisting that they had to beat feet, the unscrupulous Yankees demanded that their victim take a taste, then pay them the $200 cash he had promised to give them. He turned the tap (connected to the canteen of whiskey), took a quick swig, then shook the barrel to ensure that it was full. Satisfied, he handed over the cash and the miscreant Hoosiers skedaddled. As Gillmore explains, Pat had assumed the whiskey was stolen, and since he had previously agreed to receive what he knew to be stolen property, he dared not report the fraud to the regimental authorities.McLean, pp. 110‚Äì11. slaves, c. 1862, in the Eastern Theater ='Levy contributions'= Sometimes, pranks played by soldiers turned into indefensible crimes. As with most Federal units, the 43rd usually had a sizable number of African American 'contrabands' (runaway slaves) living near its camps whenever it was in garrison. Some of its more unscrupulous members would shamelessly defraud these poor refugees of any money they might possess. Gillmore reports that one soldier dreamed up a scheme in which he would walk around with a ledger in his hand, inquiring for the name of any black men he happened to meet. Upon receiving an answer he would open the ledger, pretend to look for his name, then inform the man \\"in an authoritative tone\\" that the government demanded that he work thirty days on the fortifications, or else pay this soldier (as its 'representative') ten dollars in cash.Federal troops were paid $13 per month, at this time. See Soldier Pay Anyone who refused, said he, would be sent beyond Federal lines and left to the mercy of the Confederates. The hapless freedman, feeling himself to be without recourse, would give all the money he had to the grifting soldier to have his name removed from the fictitious 'list.' Eventually, reports Gillmore, the practitioners of this scam (and there were more than one) were discovered and court-martialled, after which it ceased.McLean, pg. 109‚Äì110. =Whiskey commandos= Unlike beer, whiskey was utterly forbidden to the men of the 43rd while in the field. During their sojourn in Helena, Arkansas, several members of the regiment were detailed to unload a shipment of whiskey for the commissary, which was rolled into a large warehouse that had been built on stilts over the Mississippi River. Gillmore reports that one enterprising soldier had mentally measured the precise location of the whiskey barrels, so carefully that later that night, he and some friends made their way past the guards to the underside of the building, where they bored a hole through the flooring, straight up into one of the barrels. The whiskey was then allowed to flow through the hole into \\"camp kettles, mess pans and canteens,\\" which were quietly taken back to the regimental billet. The perpetrators of this daring raid were never discovered, and Gillmore reports that \\"the wholle affair was regarded as a joke upon the Commissary, who probably squared his shortage by reporting the whiskey as 'captured.'\\"McLean, pp.95‚Äì96. =Biblical bacon= Gillmore reports that bacon rations were usually delivered to the regiment in large hogsheads, weighing between six hundred and twelve hundred pounds apiece. The bacon was packed into the barrels at its point of origin by a man whose initials were \\"B.C.\\"; accordingly, these initials were stamped onto each barrel, together with its precise weight. On one occasion, a certain Sergeant came with a detail of men to collect his Company's bacon ration. One of the soldiers picked out a barrel labelled '1145 B.C.', upon which his Sergeant told him to leave that one and take the one marked '736 B.C.'McLean, pp. 100‚Äì01. \\"That was packed 1145 years before Christ,\\" the non-com explained; \\"we want bacon as fresh as we can get it.\\" Unit assignments During its service (starting 12 October 1861), the 43rd Indiana was assigned to the following units: *October to December, 1861: 14th Brigade, Army of the Ohio. *December, 1861 to February, 1862: 14th Brigade, 5th Division, Army of the Ohio. *February to April, 1862: 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Army of Mississippi. *April to July, 1862: 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, Army of Mississippi. *July to December, 1862: Helena, Arkansas, District of Eastern Arkansas, Department of Missouri. *December, 1862 to January, 1863: 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, District of Eastern Arkansas, Department of the Tennessee. *January to February, 1863: 1st Brigade, 12th Division, XIII Corps, Army of the Tennessee. *February to July, 1863: 1st Brigade, 13th Division, XIII Corps. *July to August, 1863: 1st Brigade, 13th Division, XVI Corps (served in this unit during the Arkansas Expedition in August, 1863). *August, 1863 to January, 1864: 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, Arkansas Expedition. *January to April, 1864: 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, VII Corps, Department of Arkansas. *April to May, 1864: 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, VII Corps (for the Camden Expedition). *July, 1864 to July, 1865: Assigned to guard duty at Camp Morton, Indiana. *Mustered out: 14 July 1865.

A disciple of Abdelhamid Ben Badis, he was active in the Islamic reformation of Algeria and the Algerian War of Independence. He directed the Friends of the Manifesto and Liberty Party's (in French: Amis du Manifeste et de la Libert√©, AML) Federation in Constantine, and was a member of the Central Committee and Deputy of the Constantine region from 1947 to 1951. In 1954, Omar Derdour became a political worker within the National Liberation Front (FLN) and undertook a great deal of propaganda and mobilization in France in 1955 and 1956 and then in Cairo, Egypt and throughout the Arab world. After independence, Omar Derdour devoted himself to teaching, became a founding member of the Islamic Institute, and founded numerous other Muslim institutions and schools.  Early years Derdour was born on 13 October 1913 in Hidoussa, a small village in the municipality of Teniet El Abed, in the heart of the Aur√®s Mountains. He was born into a family of scholars which hailed from the Ouled Abdi Valley in that mountain region. The village lies He learned the Quran in his great-grandfather's zawiya (a Maghrebi Islamic school). Derdour went to Tolga where he studied at the school of Sheikh Ali bin Omar for two years, and was given a thorough Islamic education in language and jurisprudence. In 1932 Sheikh Abdul Hafiz al-Hashemi took Omar Derdour to Constantine and introduced him to Sheikh Imam Abdelhamid Ben Badis, who agreed to accept him as a pupil on the condition that he passed an examination. In 1933 Derdour joined the \\"Green Mosque\\" (Djam√¢a El Akhdar) and began studying under Sheikh Abdelhamid Ben Badis. He would remain there for seven years. In 1934, Ben Badis appointed Derdour teacher in the two mosques of Sidi Guemouche and Sidi Bouma√¢za in Constantine. In 1936, he became the close assistant of Ben Badis in organizing the courses.  Return to Hidoussa In 1936 Omar Derdour and a group of fellow students founded a division of the Algerian Muslim Scholars Association and became active in education in the fields of religious and national awareness. In 1937, Derdour returned to his village to establish a madrasa for the education of children and adults. Ben Badis considered him the \\"soul of the Islahiste movement in the Aures\\". At the end of 1937, the French authorities became aware of his activities and imprisoned him in Batna for \\"inciting the population to civil disobedience\\". Derdour was released on 6 January 1938, but was imprisoned a second time in August 1939 to complete his four-month sentence and was fined 8,000 francs. He was released in September 1939 upon the outbreak of World War II (1939-1945). During the war the authorities suppressed all political activities, and he was forced to limit himself to non-political education. Struggle for independence  Derdour, second from the right Derdour, second from the left Omar Derdour directed the AML Party's Federation in Constantine, and was a member of the Central Committee and Deputy of the Constantine region from 1947 until 1951. The purpose of the AML party was to publicize and defend the Manifest du Peuple Algerien; anti-French, it demanded equal rights for the Muslim population and an autonomous Algeria federated with France, the colonial power. Between July 1955 and January 1956 he lived in Vichy, France, working with the National Liberation Front (FLN) on defining the objectives and approach of the revolution. Derdour moved to Cairo, meeting Sheikh Mohammed Bashir Brahimi and other members of the Revolutionary Command. He was given the task of travelling to the Arab countries to raise support for the Algerian revolution. Derdour was based in Cairo until he moved to Tunisia in 1960. He taught soldiers on the Algerian border until independence was achieved in 1962. Independent Algeria After Algeria gained independence, Omar Derdour devoted himself to teaching Islam and Arabic. He founded the first Islamic institute in Batna in May 1963, followed by the creation of similar institutions in several cities across the country, reaching 10,000 students. In 1981, Derdour was appointed director of the institute in Sidi Okba for training imams and regional inspectors of religious affairs in Batna, Khenchela and Oum El Bouaghi, holding this position until his retirement. In 1986, Derdour was appointed regional inspector of Religious Affairs in Batna and Khenchela provinces. In the 2000s he built a mosque and a zawiya in the locality of El Hamza in the municipality of Oued Taga and a school in the village of his birth. On 19 March 2009 Abou El Kacem Omar Derdour died after a long battle against the effects of a stroke. He was buried in Tazoult.

Individuals with autism have both specific difficulties with memory and memory strengths. Memory difficulty is not part of the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD); but, it is a common difficulty experienced by many individuals with this diagnosis.Crane, L., Pring, L., Jukes, K., & Goddard, L.

This article emphasizes declarative and non-declarative memory functions and their connection with autism. Habbi, Harris, Pollick and, Melville (2019) in their meta-analysis reported a connection between autism and working memory. Working memory impairments appear to involve both phonological and visual spatial arenas. Among areas of strength are certain types of visual memory and intact rote memory, with some individuals showing very good rote memory.  Overview  Autism is a spectrum disorder which presents many challenges to the study of autism and memory function. It is important for researchers to be able to collect data across the spectrum and develop experimental designs to study both individuals with high functioning autism (HFA) and those with moderate- low functioning autism (M-LFA). Methods to classify individuals into one of these groups include intelligence testing, which enables researchers to make methodical comparisons and analyses between HFA and M-LFA individuals. Alternatively, in recent years, ‚Äúmixed‚Äù studies of both HFA and M-LFA participants are done as well. Some of the earliest references to the topic of autism and memory date back to the 1960s and 70s when several studies appeared proposing that autism should be classified as an amnesic disorder. What is now diagnosed as autism, was formerly diagnosed as developmental amnesia. Subsequent studies had mixed results; some found support for impaired memory, others found evidence of relatively intact memory function. Even though the view of autism as an amnesic disorder of memory has now been rejected, there are still many studies done on the deficits in memory function that are associated with autism. Furthermore, in the memory studies there were observations of memory dysfunctions in autism that were consistent with a deficit in executive functions. Theories have been developed stating that the memory deficits are a reflection of primary deficits in executive function, or of a primary deficit in the processing of complex information. It has been difficult to get consistent results in autism research. One of the reasons for this is that the autistic population is very diverse, with differences in development and cognitive levels. However, there are a couple of findings that have been replicated in several studies: *Children with autism do not use organizational strategies or context to support memory. For example, when remembering words, children with autism demonstrate the same level when they are in a random group and when they are semantically or syntactically organized. *Compared to other children, those with autism use fewer strategies spontaneously in order to retrieve information. *Children with autism have much more difficulties with memory for complex material - for instance, for young children, recall of digits was easiest, of sentences more difficult, and of stories the most difficult. *Visual memory for some types of material is an area of strength, but children with autism also show certain difficulties with complex material.  Declarative memory  Declarative memory is memory which can be consciously recalled, such as facts and knowledge,.Ullman MT. Contributions of memory circuits to language: the declarative/procedural model\\" Cognition 2004; 92: 231‚Äì70. For instance, autobiographical memory is an example of declarative memory. Declarative memory includes semantic and episodic memory. Semantic memory involves the recollection of facts, and episodic memory involves the recollection of previous experiences in life. Studies on individuals with ASD have shown impairments to their episodic memory but a relative preservation of their semantic memory. The brain regions that play a major role in declarative learning and memory are the hippocampus and regions of the medial temporal lobe. Little research has been conducted on M-LFA individuals and memory function. Memory profiles of M-LFA individuals and of HFA individuals seem to be similar, but there is some evidence that declarative memory impairment is consistently greater for M-LFA individuals than for HFA individuals. = Autobiographical memory = One aspect of autobiographical memory is the self-reference effect, which means that typically people have a stronger memory for information that is relevant to themselves. It has been theorized that individuals with ASD have diminished psychological self-knowledge, but an intact physical self-knowledge. As a result, these individuals show impaired autobiographical episodic memory and a reduced self-reference effect (which may each rely on psychological aspects of the self-concept) but do not show specific impairments in memory for their own rather than others‚Äô actions (which may rely on physical aspects of the self- concept). Impaired memory binding may also play a role, meaning individuals with autism have a hard time remembering events where they were involved. Individuals with ASD are able to encode events at perceptual and objective levels, but they are unable to encode events in a subjective manner. A 2012 study conducted by Laura Crane et al., like previous studies, suggests that adults with ASD experienced a reduction in the speed of recall of the autobiographical memory as well as the detail of memory in comparison to typical adults. However, the study results suggest that when adults with ASD were able to retrieve these memories their accounts were qualitatively similar to typical adults. = Prospective memory = The landmark study conducted by Jones et al. in 2010 was the first to examine evidence-based prospective memory impairment for ASD individuals. The primary findings of this study provide evidence suggesting that poor social and communication skills in ASD individuals have an effect on their prospective memory function. With these demonstrated connections between social communication skills and prospective memory, several hypotheses have arisen concerning what specific aspects of diminished social skills are influencing prospective memory impairment. Prospective memory relies heavily upon social motivation‚Äîlike the desire to be socially included, insight and perception into other people's emotions, and the ability to read social cues. Individuals with ASD are largely tuned out to these types of social motivation, which then affects their prospective memory. Difficulty reflecting upon one's own mental state and the mental state of others, self-awareness and self-monitoring deficiencies likely also play a role in impaired prospective memory. A recent study conducted by Altgassen et al. in 2012 also suggested that even though there are differences between individuals with ASD and typical adults when it comes to planning performance and organizational skills, there is no significant difference between individuals with ASD and typical participants when it comes to rule adherence.Altgassen, M., Koban, N., & Kliegel, M. (2012). Do adults with autism spectrum disorders compensate in naturalistic prospective memory tasks?. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 2141‚Äì2151. In fact, ASD individuals tend to follow rules very closely once they have been learned. These findings suggest that everyday organizational task rules are not always evident in ASD people, and if they were targeted as rules it would be easier for them to follow. Prospective memory in autism has not been widely studied, so further research needs to be conducted in this field in order to investigate if there is supporting evidence to this claim. = Explicit memory retrieval =  Cued recall  Cued recall, research has been conducted primarily with HFA individuals, but some studies have shown common weakness on cued recall tests for both groups of HFA and M-LFA individuals. In another study, testing a HFA group and a control group of non-ASD individuals revealed that the ASD group made more intrusion errors on recall trials. This evidence also supports the hypothesis that ASD individuals may have a deficit in cued recall. Studies about temporal order memory and ASD participants also indicate that temporal order memory for verbal information is impaired in ASD individuals. However, there is also contradictory evidence for these claims. A 2001 study conducted by Mottron et al. found that ASD individuals, unlike typical individuals, do not benefit more from semantic rather than phonological cues.Mottron, L., Morasse, K., & Belleville, S. (2001). A study of memory functioning in individuals with autism. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 253-260. ASD individuals do not always conform to the Levels of Processing principle, since they benefit the same from deep and superficial recall cues. In a recency judgment task study conducted by Gras-Vincendon et al., evidence suggested that temporal context memory is not impaired in individuals with HFA. The study proposes this is due largely because the recency judgment task involves more automatic than organizational processing. The researchers proposed that the supposedly impaired temporal order memory for verbal information found in Bennetto's work is actually due to difficulty with general complex verbal stimuli.  Recognition  Recognition in HFA individuals has been widely studied. Overall, these studies conclude that the majority of HFA individuals have intact recognition ability. Non-social stimuli recognition is often superior, or ‚Äúrobustly intact‚Äù, although there is some evidence suggesting that HFA individuals have difficulty with complex scenes and color combinations. For example, HFA individuals exhibit intact recognition of non-social stimuli such as written words, spoken sentences, pictures of common objects, and meaningless patterns or shapes. For HFA individuals impaired recognition have been found in object-location and object-color recognition tests, and recognition of words encoded self- referentially. For more information regarding recognition of social stimuli for individuals with autism, see the face perception page. Contrary to the plethora of HFA recognition memory studies, the study of recognition for M-LFA individuals is considerably lacking. The studies that do exist predominantly point to impaired recognition of pictures, words to name objects and other non-social stimuli. Four delayed recognition studies reported recognition impairment for M-LFA participants. Additionally, four of the seven primary studies of non-social stimuli recognition revealed significant impairment of non-social stimuli for M-LFA individuals. The other three studies were less reliable because of methodology. Boucher, Lewis and Collis gathered data supporting poor facial recognition, something widely observed for M-LFA individuals.  Implicit/Non-declarative memory  Implicit memory is non- declarative memory that relies on past experiences to help recall things without actively thinking of them. Procedural memory, classical conditioning and priming are all included in implicit memory. For example, procedural skills, such as riding a bike, become so natural over time that one does not have to explicitly think about them. The brain regions that process implicit memory are the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Research suggests that both HFA and M-LFA individuals show strong implicit memory function. HFA individuals display intact implicit memory for non-social stimuli, unimpaired classical conditioning and performance on other implicit learning tasks. HFA individuals displayed normal perceptual and conceptual priming. Studies concerning implicit memory in M-LFA individuals are sparse and further study is needed. As mentioned above, there are very few reliable studies of non- declarative memory for M-LFA. However, there are some speculations. Some consider that the impaired motor skills evident in many cases of M-LFA may suggest impaired procedural learning. Other studies, including Walenski (2006) and Romero-Muguia (2008), also think that ASD behavior is indicative of implicit memory function. For example, many ASD individuals have exceptional implicit perceptual processing abilities in mathematics, the arts and in musical improvisation. Furthermore, there is speculation that because M-LFA individuals are often characterized by habit and routine, habit formation is likely unimpaired. Gordon et al. (2007) studied how procedural learning is affected by autism and found that even M-LFA individuals are capable of learning an implicit sequence with the help of behavioral training. Behavioral treatments and therapies used with M-LFA individuals are usually very helpful, suggesting that implicit knowledge can be acquired and conditioning is intact. Behavioral treatments and therapies used with M-LFA individuals are usually very helpful, suggesting that implicit knowledge can be acquired and conditioning is intact.  Memory strengths  Although many people who have been diagnosed with autism suffer some memory difficulties, there are some who excel with memory. There are some individuals with HFA who have been diagnosed with Savant syndrome, such as Kim Peek. Those who are considered savants have abilities, usually related to memory, that are far above average, while also experiencing mental disabilities. Savants can also excel in a range of skills other than memory, including math, art and music. While those who are diagnosed with autism have a higher probability of having savant skills, men are also more likely that women to exhibit these skills. Howlin et al. (2009) studied a group of 137 individuals with autism, ranging from HFA to M-LFA, and found that 28.5% of them had savant skills. Another well-known savant is Daniel Tammet, who gave a Ted talk on his experience with synesthesia. Synesthesia is a condition that causes the senses to be perceived differently. Those who have it may experience colors, tastes, sounds and shapes while perceiving numbers, letters and people‚Äôs faces or names. It is more common for individuals with autism to have synesthesia or savant syndrome, compared to the rest of the population.  Neurological  Studies suggest that memory deficit observed in ASD has a biological explanation linked to abnormalities in the hippocampus and other neural regions responsible for strategic regulation, such as the amygdala and the frontal cortex.Wojcik, D. Z., Moulin, C. A., & Souchay, C. (2013). Metamemory in children with autism: Exploring \\"feeling-of-knowing\\" in episodic and semantic memory. Neuropsychology, 19-27.  Further research  Across the board, it is agreed that there is an urgent need for more research concerning M-LFA memory function. Specifically, there are about half as many M-LFA studies on memory compared to HFA. Very few studies of implicit/non-declarative memory exist and almost no brain studies. Almost all of the M-LFA studies are conducted with school-aged children, so there is a great need for a wider age range in memory studies. Very little mapping of the developmental process of ASD has happened, so there is an overall need for longitudinal studies of individuals with ASD across their lifetime. Replication and extension of prospective memory research is needed as well as further cross-sectional and comparison studies for HFA and M-LFA. Recently a specific call has been issued for the investigation of total loss of declarative memory in significantly low-functioning, nonverbal individuals with ASD.

He devoted time to a number of civil and human rights organizations, was one of the early leaders of the Chinese Benevolent Association in Vancouver, and was \\"perhaps the most influential person\\" in the city's Chinatown. He was sometimes referred to as the \\"spokesman for Chinatown\\", or as \\"mayor of Chinatown\\" by Vancouverites, to the resentment of some Chinese Canadians in the community. Foon Sien sought to end discrimination against Chinese Canadians and other minority groups, and was an ardent activist to grant or recognize their rights, particularly regarding immigration and family reunification. Early life He was born Wong Mun Poo () on 7 July 1899 in Guangdong and moved to Cumberland, British Columbia in 1908 with his parents. His parents, who had become successful merchants, hoped he would build a career in Imperial China, and had wanted to send him to China for a proper education; he spent time after school reading Four Books and Five Classics when he was 10 years old. Their hopes were dashed when revolutionary Sun Yat-sen visited Cumberland from his exile in the United States on a fund-raising trip in 1911, leaving an impression on Foon Sien, who resolved to study law. After he completed high school, he moved to Vancouver and became one of five Chinese students to enroll at the University of British Columbia (UBC). He became the president of the Chinese Students' Alliance of Canada. Foon Sien was also a member of the Chinese Canadian Club (Tong-yuen Wui), established in Victoria in 1914. Career He graduated from UBC, and was hired as a court interpreter by Alexander Malcolm Manson, the Attorney General of British Columbia. He became embroiled in controversy over the Janet Smith case, as Manson, private detective Oscar Robinson, Forbes Cruickshank of the British Columbia Provincial Police, and police detectives Sam North and James Hannah kidnapped Foon Sing Wong, a suspect in the murder. The suspect was held for months, beaten, and questioned by the detectives with translation provided by Foon Sien. The English-language Vancouver press exposed him as an employee of the detective agency, which performed services for police agencies off the record. The kidnapping elicited outrage amongst both Chinese and English-speaking residents of Vancouver, and a group of unnamed \\"older Chinese merchants\\" filed an official complaint about Foon Sien's actions to the attorney general. Foon Sien's role was seen as a conflict of interest, as he was translating for the court and assisting the investigation. He established the Kwong Lee Tai Company, a Chinese legal broker employing interpreters to handle \\"all cases either civil or criminal, such as immigration, deportation, merchant certificates, contracts or leases with occidental people\\". In 1942, he founded the Chinese Trade Workers' Association, one of several associations he would establish throughout his life. The Chinese Benevolent Association, established in 1906, often consisted of Chinese merchants with the \\"financial and social influence\\" to conduct business outside Vancouver's Chinatown. In 1937, following suit with the Benevolent's Association earlier leaders Yip Sang and Won Alexander Cumyow, he was named publicity agent for the association's aid-to-China program during the Second Sino-Japanese War, as his activities had already established him as proficient in 'public relations' before the advent of World War II. In 1948, he became the organization's co- chairman, a position he held until 1959. During this time, the CBA achieved its peak from the influence of his connections outside Chinatown, claimed by one author to have connections to membership in the Liberal Party of Canada, and his \\"wide acquaintance with mainstream journalists and leaders of other minority groups\\". He supported the Liberal Party of Canada throughout his life, but supported Progressive Conservative candidate Douglas Jung in the Canadian federal elections of 1957 and 1958. Jung became the first Chinese Canadian Member of Parliament. Journalism and activism In 1944, he drafted and signed a petition with Gordon Won Cumyow, Esther Fung, Ann Chian, Joe Leong, Henry Lee, and Andrew Lam as members of the Chinese Canadian Association. It contained seven points requesting the right for Chinese Canadians to vote in elections in British Columbia, and was sent to the Government of British Columbia and the Government of Canada. In 1945, he was hired to the editorial staff of the New Republic Chinese Daily in Victoria. He also contributed to other publications, such as the Chinatown News. In 1945, he began a campaign for Canadian governments to grant voting rights to Chinese Canadians. These were granted federally and provincially by 1947, and municipally by 1949. After the Chinese Immigration Act was repealed in 1947, he became an important figure for the elimination of the remaining immigration restrictions in Canada, particularly regarding the separation of Chinese Canadian families as a result of those restrictions, and to seek redress for the head tax. He travelled to Ottawa annually from 1949 to 1959 to meet and lobby politicians, earning him fame. He appeared often in mainstream media coverage about the subject, and the Chinese Canadian media covered his trips exhaustively, even including itineraries and \\"editorial support\\". This led to Foon Sien being regarded as a spokesman for the Chinese community, and increased his influence and that of the CBA. In 1953, the CBA distributed a leaflet to endorse candidates for the federal election. His lobbying for the liberalization of Canadian immigration law eventually \\"enabled hundreds of families of Chinese origin to reunite\\", as Chinese Canadians could sponsor husbands, wives, unmarried offspring, and elderly parents. The Chinese Canadian Citizens Association presented him an award for his activities. Despite this, Foon Sien was viewed as a controversial figure by some in the Chinese community, who believed he was \\"manipulating the CBA for his personal aggrandizement\\", or resented him being referred to as \\"mayor of Chinatown\\" by the mainstream media, though such criticism was not widespread. In 1959, he resigned from the CBA committee. In 1959, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Immigration Department began an investigation into an alleged racketeering operation by Chinese Canadians to illegally bring Chinese immigrants to Canada. The RCMP conducted raids of residences, businesses, and organizations of leaders of Chinese Canadian communities, seizing passports, visas, and other documents. More than 30,000 were seized in Vancouver, many of which were translated by officers from the Hong Kong Police Force, acting as undercover agents. Foon Sien considered these raids to be part of systemic human rights violations: \\"The situation resembles a country under martial law. If the government does not restrict such actions, the basic rights and freedoms of the people are endangered.\\" Chinese community associations conducted media counter-campaigns; ultimately, few people were convicted for such immigration schemes. The CBA suffered damage as a result of these raids, as it had been implicated in the racketeering scheme by the police, and its prestige and influence waned as a result. In the 1960s, he was an activist against some developments in Vancouver, particularly those in Chinatown. In 1963, he resigned from a consultative committee arranged by mayor William Rathie to \\"underline his determined opposition\\" to the Strathcona Rehabilitation Project development that he deemed would result in \\"the equivalent of a Berlin wall\\" separating business and residential areas of Chinatown. It would raze 30 acres for a high-rise building at MacLean Park and the Raymur-Campbell public housing project, some of which was land expropriated from Chinese property owners. Rathie suggested the group represented by the Chinese Benevolent Association to submit its own plans for the development, which was favourably received by the community. However, Vancouver City Council approved the developers plans the subsequent week, but also stated they'd accept input from architects consulting for the CBA. Foon Sien died in Vancouver on 31 July 1971, and his funeral was one of the most attended in Chinatown. Legacy On 26 August 2008 he was registered in the Persons of National Historic Significance, a register of people designated by the Government of Canada as being nationally significant in the history of the country. Many of his papers, as well as newspaper clippings and other works, are archived in the Special Collections division of the University of British Columbia Library. John Atkin listed Foon Sien as one of the Top 10 Vancouverites in an April 2011 column for the Vancouver Sun.

Construction began in 1993, mostly by Burgess who says he had a visionary commandment from God to build a treehouse. It became a popular local attraction and was unofficially called the largest tree house in the world. It was closed by the state on August 30, 2012 for fire code violations. On October 22, 2019 the tree house completely burned to the ground under unknown circumstances. History and description The exterior of the treehouse Horace Burgess, a local minister, was praying in 1993 when he said God told him, \\"If you build a tree house, I'll see that you never run out of material.\\" Inspired by the vision, Burgess began building the treehouse and continued working on it for the next 12 years. The 97-foot-tall tree house and church was supported by a still-living 80-foot-tall white oak tree with a 12-foot diameter base, and relied on six other oak trees for support. He built it using 258,000 nails with a nailgun, and about 500 pounds of penny nails driven by hand. The treehouse was located on Beehive Lane in Crossville, Tennessee. Over time, Burgess' treehouse became a popular tourist attraction. Burgess officiated 23 weddings in the treehouse church, and when not in service, the sanctuary doubled as a basketball court. Although there is no Guinness World Records category for largest treehouse, it was often referred to as the world's largest. Pete Nelson, the host of \\"Treehouse Masters\\" on Animal Planet, who has written six books about treehouses and owns a business building them, said it was \\"by far\\" the largest in the world. In August 2012, the structure was closed to public access by the state because it had become a public attraction but did not follow building and fire safety codes. The structure stood vacant and dilapidated for years, becoming a frequent target of vandalism. On October 22, 2019, the treehouse and its supporting trees completely burned to the ground in an intense inferno lasting about 15 minutes. The fire department responded, however by the time they arrived nothing was left to save. Fire officials said there was no electricity on site and no electric storms. The recent new owner of the treehouse, who had no insurance, declined to open an investigation. Burgess said most of the marriages he officiated there had not lasted, and that he was relieved after the fire; the treehouse had \\"always been a pain\\" he said.

Political foray  Hendry, was on New Westminster city council from 1879‚Äì80 and elected mayor in January 1889. He resigned in July because of a conflict of interest with him being involved with the New Westminster Southern Railway Company.  Legacy  John Hendry Park is a 27.31-hectare park at 3300 Victoria Drive and 15th Avenue in Vancouver, British Columbia. Hendry's introduction of steam donkeys and railways were the model for the lumber industry of the 20th century. In 1926, Hendry's daughter Aldyen, who was married to the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, Eric Hamber, donated some mill property to the Vancouver Park Board with the condition that it be named after her father. It is still known as John Hendry Park.

Shand on The Early History of the Morioris Before that time and until the 1920s, however, a small group of prominent anthropologists proposed that the Moriori people of the Chatham Islands represented a pre-MƒÅori group of people from Melanesia, who once lived across all of New Zealand.\\"Imagining Moriori: A history of ideas of a people in the twentieth century\\", Jacinta Blank, MA Thesis, 2007 While this idea lost favour among academics, it was widely published and incorporated into school textbooks which has extended its life in the popular imagination.For example The Cyclopedia of New Zealand of 1902\\"Imagining Moriori: A history of ideas of a people in the twentieth century\\", Jacinta Blank, MA Thesis, 2007 Some early visitors to New Zealand did speculate that the original New Zealanders might be descended from ancient Greeks, Romans or Egyptians, and some Christian missionaries thought that the MƒÅori ancestors belonged to the lost tribes of Israel.K. R. Howe. p 1 'Ideas of MƒÅori origins', Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 9 Nov 12 In more recent times, outside of academia a similar variety of speculation of New Zealand's first settlers has occurred. These ideas typically incorporate aspects of conspiracy theories as they are in opposition to the last 100 years of academic research.  MƒÅori oral traditions  MƒÅori oral tradition provides a sort of backbone for pre-MƒÅori theories which sometimes cite the now-discredited Great Fleet hypothesis. More remote traditions speak of all manner of spirits, fairy folk, giants, and ogres living in parts of New Zealand when MƒÅori arrived. The pale-skinned are perhaps the most well-known, which NgƒÅti Kura, NgƒÅti Korakorako, and NgƒÅti T≈´rehu are said to be sub- groupings of. In oral tradition, taught weaving and net-making to the MƒÅori, and could not come out during the day. were similar in that they could not tolerate sunlight, so they lived in the ocean. In south Westland, KƒÅti MƒÅhaki ki Makaawhio's Te Tauraka Waka a Maui Marae is named in honour of a tradition stating that MƒÅui landed his canoe in Bruce Bay when he arrived in New Zealand. In a myth collected from Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora, MƒÅui threw a giant to the sea and buried him underneath a mountain to create the area around Banks Peninsula. A well-known story is how MƒÅui fished up the North Island out of the Pacific Ocean, which Te Rangi Hƒ´roa of NgƒÅti Mutunga suggests might be a way to say he 'discovered' the island out of the blue, though the rest of the myth is very fanciful in saying parts of his canoe became different areas of both islands. In the traditions of NgƒÅi Tahu's Waitaha descendants, RƒÅkaihaut≈´ of the was the first man to set foot in the South Island by digging up the many lakes and waterways and filling them with fish. He brought with him the ancestors of the groups Te KƒÅhui Tipua, Te KƒÅhui Roko, and Te KƒÅhui Waitaha. According to Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata of NgƒÅti Porou, RƒÅkaihaut≈´ did not go south at all, but rather his legend was brought down there. Some accounts may say he is an ancestor of Toi through a daughter that stayed behind in Te PatunuioƒÅio, who himself is an ancestor of KƒÅti MƒÅmoe, Te KƒÅhea, NgƒÅpuhi, NgƒÅti RƒÅhiri Tumutumu, and HƒÅwea in some tellings. HƒÅwea might have alternatively been a different tribe that arrived on the before or at a similar time to Waitaha before merging with them, with other ancient tribal groupings possibly including the Maero and Rapuwai. In NgƒÅi T≈´hoe traditions, Toi's 'ancestor' Tƒ´wakawaka was the first to settle the country aboard , \\"but only his name is remembered\\". A man named Kahukura took Toi's own canoe, the , and returned to Hawaiki. He sent back to the new lands with the canoe, which in NgƒÅti Kahungunu traditions was accompanied by Kiwa, who later sailed around to Gisborne and became the first man there. Kupe and Ngahue were both contemporaries famous for exploring New Zealand before notable migration voyages began. The latter discovered pounamu, the former introduced the first dogs () and created Lake Grassmere to drown Te KƒÅhui Tipua - described as 'giants' or 'ogres' who were said to be living in Marlborough at the time. Both Kupe and Ngahue returned to Hawaiki, though Ngahue came back with the after a war with Uenuku. In tradition, the local NgƒÅti Hotu and NgƒÅti Ruakopiri of Lake Taupo and Lake Rotoaira were harassed by NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa, and later pushed to extinction in the King Country by the Whanganui MƒÅori.  Early European speculation  Elsdon Best with fellow ethnographer Percy Smith. The two most prominent academic proponents of pre-MƒÅori settlement.Photograph by kind permission of the Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand, reference number: 1/2-028237-F During the 19th century, ideas about Aryan migrations became popular and these were applied to New Zealand. Edward Tregear's The Aryan Maori (1885) suggested that Aryans from India migrated to southeast Asia and then to the islands of the Pacific, including New Zealand.K. R. Howe. p 2 'Ideas of MƒÅori origins', Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 9 Nov 12 The writing of Percy Smith and Elsdon Best from the late 19th century theorised about pre-MƒÅori settlement. Their work inspired theories that the MƒÅori had displaced a more primitive pre-MƒÅori population of Moriori (sometimes described as a small-statured, dark-skinned race of possible Melanesian origin), in mainland New Zealand ‚Äì and that the Chatham Island Moriori were the last remnant of this earlier race.  Recent revivals of pre-MƒÅori settlement theories  Don Brash, formerly leader of the New Zealand National Party and highest profile proponent of pre-MƒÅori settlement theories. Time=30:20 Although modern New Zealand archaeology has largely clarified questions of the origin and dates of the earliest migrations, some theorists have continued to speculate that what is now New Zealand was discovered by Melanesians, 'Celts', Greeks, Egyptians or the Chinese, before the arrival of the Polynesian ancestors of the MƒÅori. Some of these ideas have also been supported by politicians and media personalities. An earlier presentation of the theory of pre-Polynesian European settlement of New Zealand was Kerry Bolton's 1987 pamphlet Lords of the Soil, which states that \\"Polynesia has been occupied by peoples of the Europoid race since ancient times\\". Other books presenting such theories have included The Great Divide: The Story of New Zealand & its Treaty, (2012) by Ian Wishart, a journalist, and To the Ends of the Earth by Maxwell C. Hill, Gary Cook and Noel Hilliam, which claims that New Zealand was discovered by explorers from ancient Egypt and Greece. Historians and archaeologists dismiss the theories. Michael King wrote in his history of New Zealand, \\"Despite a plethora of amateur theories about Melanesian, South American, Egyptian, Phoenician and Celtic colonisation of New Zealand, there is not a shred of evidence that the first human settlers were anything other than Polynesian\\", and Richard Hill, professor of New Zealand Studies at Victoria University of Wellington, said in 2012, \\"Not one of [the theories] has ever passed any remote academic scrutiny.\\" Hugh Laracy of the University of Auckland called them \\"wild speculation\\" that has been \\"thoroughly disposed of by academic specialists\\". Another historian, Vincent O'Malley, and the New Zealand Archaeological Association regard the theories as having a racist or at least a political element, seeking to cast doubt on Waitangi Tribunal claims. Scott Hamilton in \\"No to Nazi Pseudo-history: an Open Letter\\" further explains objections to the theories of Bolton and Martin Doutr√© (and the website Ancient Celtic New Zealand). = Purported evidence =  Places  A site frequently related by theorists as evidence of pre-Polynesian settlers is the Kaimanawa Wall, which some claim is a remnant of ancient human construction that the MƒÅori could not have built because they did not build with stone in such a way. Controversial author Barry Brailsford claimed that 'Waitaha elders' said it was built before their arrival. Several anthropologists and geologists have concluded the formation to be a natural ignimbrite outcrop formed 330,000 years ago. A ground-penetrating radar scan of the area surrounding the formation confirmed that it is not part of a pyramid as the rock has no regularities or chambers for a depth of 12 metres, and no metal had been found under a geomagnetic scan. Boulders originally on a hill in Silverdale, Auckland have been argued by Martin Doutr√© in a 1999 book to be artefacts left by a pre-Polynesian Celtic population, who according to the theory came to be known as the , and used the boulders as part of a system spanning around the area, used for calendar tracking and survey functions. Bruce Hayward, a Geological Society spokesman, says the boulders were formed in the ocean 70 million years ago and naturally pushed into the hills over time. The Moeraki Boulders are another patch of boulders which are found on the Koekohe Beach in Otago. Other supposed structures and creations of pre- Polynesian settlers are described as the Waipoua 'stone city', the 'Waitapu Valley (Maunganui Bluff) solar observatory' including Puketapu hill and a mountain at Hokianga, a 'stone village' in the Tapapakanga Regional Park, and all manner of petroglyphs and carvings found throughout the islands. Most of these ideas are propounded by Doutr√©.  'White people'  David Rankin, a NgƒÅpuhi elder, has drawn attention to MƒÅori legends suggesting that people, some of them with fair skin, were already present in the islands when Polynesians arrived, and has claimed the existence of a conspiracy among academics to suppress inquiry. In his theories, he draws on ideas from Ian Wishart and Maxwell Hill. Theorists commonly point to one Mrs Matamua as a source of evidence that pale-skinned MƒÅori with golden hair and green eyes did and do exist. Mrs Matamua claims to be one of roughly 2,000 living descendants of NgƒÅti Hotu (as well as of NgƒÅti Maru, NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa, and Whanganui MƒÅori), further claiming the group's ancestors left Iran through Borneo long ago. After taking a DNA test with the National Geographic Society's Genographic Project, her maternal haplogroup has been identified as B4, and her regional results turned up 28% northeast Asian, 20% southeast Asian, 18% Oceanian, 12% northern European, 12% Mediterranean, 6% Sub-Saharan African, and 4% southwest Asian, and her reference populations were to the Vietnamese and Puerto Ricans. Mrs Matamua additionally claims that NgƒÅi T≈´hoe \\"are of NgƒÅti Hotu.\\" Theorists may claim that Persians were exiled from the area west of India to Peru after sailing around southern Africa, only to be chased out again to Rapa Nui with Hotu MatuÍûåa being their leader at the time, and then spreading out into the rest of Polynesia, thus ending up with a Pre-MƒÅori group that had been chased half-way around the world to ultimately settle in New Zealand. A study published to the Nature journal by Stanford University on 8 July 2020 concluded that around roughly 1150‚Äì1230 AD a 'single shared contact event' had taken place between Polynesians and coastal Colombian Amerindians before the settlement of Rapa Nui. The study analysed 807 individuals from 17 island populations and 15 Pacific coast indigenous American groups, with the earliest admixture having been found in the southern Marquesas Islands, which seemingly spread to the nearby islands and eventually reached Rapa Nui by 1380 AD. Future research will be needed to assess the possibility that there may have been more contact events, and explore other alternative hypotheses. 'Giant' skeletons such as a decayed specimen found 7 feet below sand at the Saltwater Creek spit in Otago during 1875 and a stone adze next to a tree stump that was reportedly discovered 25 feet underground in Auckland during March 1874 are cited as further examples of ancient, forgotten history. T. H. Cockburn-Hood seemed to suggest in 1874 that the volcanic layers that the stump was found under had been deposited from Rangitoto leading some to believe that the stump and adze were at least 30,000 years old, though more recent research concludes that Rangitoto is only about 600 years old. Alleged giant skeletons are attributed to folkloric beings, such as the Maero or Te KƒÅhui Tipua.

It covers the deposition of James VII, his replacement by his daughter Mary II and her husband William III of Orange and the political settlement thereafter. Scotland and England were linked but separate countries, each with its own Parliament; decisions in one did not bind the other. Issues included religious freedom but also arbitrary rule and the divine right of kings; the Revolution ended a century of political dispute by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown. In 2016, one of its amendments, the 1689 Claim of Right, was referenced in legal arguments as to whether Scotland was bound by Brexit. James became King in February 1685 with widespread support in both countries but tolerance for his personal beliefs did not apply to Catholicism in general. James suspended the English and Scottish Parliaments when they refused to pass his measures and ruled by decree; it was this response that most damaged him. The birth of James Francis Edward in June 1688 replaced Mary with a Catholic heir and caused widespread civil disorder in Scotland and England. A coalition of English politicians issued a declaration known as the Invitation to William, agreeing to support Dutch military intervention to enforce Mary's rights as heir to the English throne. On 5 November 1688, William landed in South-West England and James fled to France on 23 December. Despite playing little role in the Invitation, there were many Scots in William's invasion force, including the Scots Brigade under Hugh Mackay. Scottish politicians were closely involved on both sides; many of William's advisors were Scots exiles like Leven and Melville, while James' closest counsellors were Scots Catholic converts, the Earl of Perth and his brother Melfort. On 7 January 1689, the Scottish Privy Council asked William to take over pending election of a Conventionto agree a settlement. In February 1689, William and Mary were appointed joint monarchs of England; in March, the Convention met to agree a Settlement for Scotland. Background James VII & II c. 1685 as Army Commander The Glorious Revolution in Scotland has been poorly understood because...no full-scale treatment...exists comparable to those we possess for England and we have no scholarly analysis of the Scottish constitutional settlement of 1689 (as encapsulated in the Claim of Right and the Articles of Grievances) on a par with...the English Declaration of Rights. Differences between the Glorious Revolution in Scotland and England stemmed from the impact of the 1638-51 Wars of the Three Kingdoms and 1660 Restoration. The events of 1688-90 can only be understood in the context of decades of almost constant conflict. Close links between religion and political ideology meant disputes caused huge dislocation and damage; casualties in the Civil Wars were proportionally higher in percentage terms than those of the 1914-18 World War. Presbyterian versus Episcopalian now implies differences in both structure and doctrine, but this was not the case in the 17th century. Episcopalian meant governance by bishops, appointed by the monarch, while Presbyterian structures were ruled by Elders, nominated by congregations; in Scotland, both sides were doctrinal Calvinists. Since bishops sat in the Scottish Parliament, arguments over their role were as much about politics as religious practice. Changes of regime in 1638, 1651 and 1661 led to the victors excluding their opponents, making the contest for control of the kirk increasingly bitter. As Charles II had no legitimate children, his brother James was heir to the Scottish and English thrones. In 1669, he secretly converted to Catholicism; when this became public knowledge in 1679, the Parliament of England attempted to exclude him from the English throne. Support for James was far greater in Scotland; the 1681 Scottish Succession Act confirmed his status as the legal heir 'regardless of religion,'. The Act also stated its aim was to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the dreadfull consequences of a civil war.' This was reaffirmed in the 1681 Scottish Test Act, with the crucial qualifier all government officials and MPs 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.' Tolerance for James' personal beliefs did not extend to Catholicism in general, and his failure to appreciate that distinction ultimately led to his deposition. Deposition of James VII William III and Mary II depicted on the ceiling of the Painted Hall, Greenwich. In 1685, James' position in Scotland was more secure than England. The 1681 Scottish Succession and Test Acts made obedience to the monarch a legal obligation, 'regardless of religion' but in return confirmed the primacy of the Church of Scotland or kirk. Argyll's Rising collapsed due to lack of popular support; repealing the Test Act undermined James' Episcopalian base while rewarding the dissident Presbyterians who backed Argyll. The perception James was willing to ignore his commitments, his Coronation Oath and his own supporters undermined his policies. They were also badly timed, since the October 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau revoked tolerance for French Protestants, creating an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 refugees in the next five years. The killing of over 2,000 Swiss Waldensians in 1686 reinforced fears Protestant Europe was threatened by a French-led Catholic counter-reformation. In June 1688, two events turned dissent into a crisis; the birth of James Francis Edward on 10 June created a Catholic heir, excluding James' Protestant daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange. Prosecuting the Seven Bishops seemed to go beyond tolerance for Catholicism and into an assault on the Episcopalian establishment; their acquittal on 30 June destroyed James' political authority. In 1685, many feared civil war if James were bypassed; by 1688, anti-Catholic riots made it seem only his removal could prevent one. James's chief advisor, the Earl of Sunderland secretly co-ordinated with Henry Sydney to prepare the Invitation to William, assuring him of support from across the English political class for armed intervention. Anxious to secure English financial and military support against France, William landed in Brixham on 5 November with 14,000 men; as he advanced, much of the Royal Army deserted and James went into exile on 23 December. Parliament offered the English throne to William and Mary in February 1689; a large majority agreed Mary should replace her father but William's demand he be made joint monarch and sole ruler if she died was only narrowly approved. In Scotland, the split within the kirk made William more important; his Calvinism meant Presbyterians saw him as a natural ally, while the Episcopalian minority needed his support to retain control. Convention of Estates Parliament House, where the Convention of Estates met in March 1689 On 7 January 1689 the Scottish Privy Council asked William to take over government pending a Scottish Convention that would agree a settlement. 70 of the 125 delegates elected in March were classed as Presbyterian, with a tiny minority loyal to James; this made the Convention a contest between Episcopalians and Presbyterians over control of the kirk and the limits of Royal authority. On 12 March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th a Letter to the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment for non-compliance. Public anger meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to fear for their safety while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with the Duke of Gordon holding Edinburgh Castle for James and Viscount Dundee recruiting Highland levies. This exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops. The English Parliament held James had 'abandoned' his throne; in Scotland, the Convention argued he 'forfeited' it by his actions, listed in the Articles of Grievances. This was a fundamental change; if Parliament could decide James had forfeited his throne, monarchs derived legitimacy from Parliament, not God, ending the principle of Divine Right of Kings. In an attempt to preserve Episcopalianism, the Scottish Bishops proposed Union with England but this was rejected by the English Parliament. On 11 April, the Convention ended James' reign and adopted the Articles of Grievances and the Claim of Right Act that made Parliament the primary legislative power in Scotland. On 11 May 1689, William and Mary accepted the Scottish throne and the Convention became a full Parliament on 5 June. Dundee's rising highlighted William's reliance on Presbyterian support and he ended attempts to retain the Bishops, leading to the 1690 Act of Settlement restoring Presbyterianism. The Glorious Revolution in Scotland resulted in greater independence for Parliament and kirk but the ending of Episcopacy isolated a significant part of the political class; this would be a major factor in debates over the 1707 Act of Union and the Scottish Jacobite movement. Parliament George Melville, 1st Earl of Melville, leading figure in the first Williamite government Key figures in the new government were Lord Melville, who joined William in the Netherlands in 1683 after the Rye House Plot and the Earl of Stair, a former member of James VII's administration. In 1689, Melville was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland with Stair as Lord Advocate, a combination intended to minimise Presbyterian dominance of Parliament. The first session was a stalemate over abolishing Episcopacy in the Kirk and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body that decided what legislation Parliament could debate. As a result, Parliament refused to approve taxes or nominations for legal officers, effectively closing the law courts and William blocked implementation of legislation by withholding Royal Assent to Acts approved by Parliament. A majority of MPs formed themselves into an anti-government group called the Club, led by Sir James Montgomery, previously one of William's chief supporters but angered by Melville being preferred as Secretary of State. While some like Montgomery simply resented exclusion from office, most opposed the government on political grounds and primarily wanted to eliminate the Committee of the Articles. The government compromised by agreeing to remove bishops from the kirk but resisted abolition of the Committee of the Articles before Parliament was suspended on 2 August, following the Battle of Killiecrankie. Parliament reconvened in April 1690 in an atmosphere of high tension due to the Jacobite war in Ireland, fears of an Irish invasion of Scotland and continuing unrest in the Highlands. An alleged Jacobite conspiracy called the Montgomery Plot was uncovered, involving Montgomery, the Marquess of Annandale and Lord Ross. In the resulting panic, Melville agreed to abolish the Committee of the Articles, although it is still unclear how serious the plot actually was. Its principal objective achieved, the Club disintegrated, and on 7 June Parliament approved an Act ending Episcopacy and a grant of taxes. The constitutional settlement that emerged from the 1689 and 1690 Parliamentary sessions was less radical than in 1641. The Crown retained important prerogative powers, including the right to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament but in return abolition of the Committee of Articles gave Parliament control of the legislative agenda. Religious settlement Archbishop Sharp; his killing in May 1679 was symptomatic of the deep divisions within the Scottish kirk Conflicts between Protestors and Resolutioners during the Protectorate, then Episcopalians and Cameronians after 1660 had left deep divisions while also normalising the eviction of defeated opponents. The kirk's General Assembly meeting in November 1690 was the first since 1654 and even before it convened, over 200 conformist and Episcopalian ministers had been removed from their livings. This meant the Assembly was overwhelmingly composed of radical Presbyterians who rejected any measure of Episcopalianism or the reinstatement of those already evicted. Despite being a fellow Calvinist, William was more tolerant towards Episcopalians, seeing them as potential allies while recognising the dangers of alienating an important political constituency. However, the Assembly eliminated Episcopacy and created two commissions for the south and north of the Tay which over the next 25 years removed almost two-thirds of all ministers. The General Assembly of 1692 refused to reinstate even those Episcopalian ministers who pledged to accept Presbyterianism leaving many presbyteries with few or no parish clergy. William issued two acts of indulgence in 1693 and 1695 restoring ministers who accepted him as king; nearly one hundred clergy took advantage of this and a further measure of indulgence in 1707 left only a small remnant of Jacobite Episcopalians and some Society people. The final settlement was closer to that of 1592 rather than the more radical position of 1649 and the degree of independence between kirk and State remained ambiguous. Despite the theoretical abolition of lay patronage, heritors and elders retained the right to nominate candidates for their own parishes who could then be \\"called\\" by the congregation. Jacobite resistance The Scottish Parliament was dominated by Presbyterians, with a small group of Stuart loyalists known as Jacobites from Jacobus, Latin for James. This included members of the Catholic minority, conservative Episcopalians or those with personal ties such as Viscount Dundee, his military chief in Scotland. The vast majority were unenthusiastic about either James or William, while the Jacobites were also split between Protestant and Catholic factions. Dundee led a campaign in Scotland to support James' landing in Ireland, where clan rivalries or simple opportunism were often more important than allegiance to William or James. The Presbyterian Macleans joined the Jacobites in order to regain territories in Mull lost to the Campbells in the 1670s, while the Jacobite Keppoch MacDonalds tried to sack Inverness and were bought off only after Dundee intervened. Despite victory at Killiecrankie in July, the Jacobites suffered heavy losses including Dundee himself. Organised resistance ended with defeat at Battle of Cromdale on 1 May 1690, although it took another two years to enforce allegiance to the new regime. Assessment The Glorious Revolution settled the dominance of the Presbyterians in the Church of Scotland and the Whigs in politics but alienated a significant segment of the political class. The Whig dominance continued in both Scotland and England well into the mid-eighteenth century. As in England, the Revolution confirmed the ascendancy of Parliament over the Crown but by removing bishops from the kirk, it alienated a significant segment of the political class. In the long-term, Episcopalianism rather than Highlander or Lowlander was a key determinant of Jacobite support in both 1715 and 1745. Scotland's involvement in the Nine Years War and the War of the Spanish Succession ultimately led to the Acts of Union and the creation of Great Britain, as the danger of a divided succession between Scotland and England drove the need for a lasting resolution.

Smith, Gregory J. Barlow, Xiao-Feng Xie. Smart and scalable urban signal networks: methods and systems for adaptive traffic signal control. U.S. Patent No. 9,830,813, 2017. (Continuation-in-part (CIP) to 9,159,229). is an adaptive traffic control system developed by researchers at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. Surtrac dynamically optimizes the control of traffic signals to improve traffic flow for both urban grids and corridors; optimization goals include less waiting, reduced traffic congestion, shorter trips, and less pollution. The core control engine combines schedule-driven intersection control with decentralized coordination mechanisms.Hu, H-C and S.F. Smith, ‚ÄúSoftpressure: A Schedule-Driven Backpressure Algorithm for Coping with Network Congestion‚Äù, Proceedings 27thInternational Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Melbourne, Australia, August 2017 Since June 2012, a pilot implementation of the Surtrac system has been deployed on nine intersections in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Surtrac reduced travel times more than 25% on average, and wait times were reduced an average of 40%. A second phase of the pilot program for the Bakery Square district has been running since October 2013.Barlow, G.J., S.F. Smith, X-F Xie and Z.B. Rubinstein, ‚ÄúReal-Time Traffic Control for Urban Environments: Expanding the Surtrac Testbed Network‚Äù, 2014 World Congress on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Detroit, MI, September 2014. In 2015, Rapid Flow Technologies was formed to commercialize the Surtrac technology. The lead inventor of this technology, Dr. Xiao-Feng Xie, states that he has no association with and does not provide technology supports for this company. Design The Surtrac system design has three characteristics. First, decision making in Surtrac proceeds in a decentralized manner. Decentralized control of individual intersections enables greater responsiveness to local real-time traffic conditions. Decentralization facilitates scalability by allowing the incremental addition of controlled intersections over time with little change to the existing adaptive network. It also reduces the possibility of a centralized computational bottleneck and avoids a single point of failure in the system. A second characteristic of the Surtrac design is an emphasis on real-time responsiveness to changing traffic conditions. Surtrac adopts the real-time perspective of prior model-based intersection control methods which attempt to compute intersection control plans that optimize actual traffic inflows. By reformulating the optimization problem as a single machine scheduling problem, the core optimization algorithm, termed a schedule-driven intersection control algorithm, is able to compute optimized intersection control plans over an extended horizon on a second-by-second basis. A third characteristic of the Surtrac design is to manage urban (grid- like) road networks, where there are multiple competing dominant flows that shift dynamically through the day, and where specific dominant flows cannot be predetermined (as in arterial or major crossroad applications). Urban networks also often have closely spaced intersections requiring tight coordination of the intersection controllers. The combination of competing dominant flows and densely spaced intersections presents a challenge for all adaptive traffic control systems. Surtrac determines dominant flows dynamically by continually communicating projected outflows to downstream neighbors. This information gives each intersection controller a more informed basis for locally balancing competing inflows while simultaneously promoting establishment of larger \\"green corridors\\" when traffic flow circumstances warrant. Criticism The Surtrac system uses closed-circuit television cameras to sense traffic conditions. Surveillance of public places with CCTV networks has been criticized as enabling totalitarian forms of government by undermining people's ability to move about anonymously. Images gathered by CCTV cameras can be analyzed by automatic number plate recognition software, permitting fully automated tracking of vehicles by the license plates (number plates) they carry. Similarly, facial recognition software can analyze such images to identify and track people by the shape of their faces. However, type of video camera used does not have sufficient resolution to detect license plates or recognize faces. It has been suggested that the benefits of traffic optimization have never been scientifically justified. It inherently favors motorized traffic over alternate modes such as pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users and may promote more auto use.Michael J.

Black Pepper contains high concentrations of piperine. The bioenhancer quercetin is inter alia included in the peel of apples and grapes. The gingerols from ginger act as bioenhancers. Allicin from garlic enhances the effect of a fungicide. Bioenhancers or bioavailability enhancers is a new chapter in medical science first scientifically established in 1979 after the discovery of world's first bioenhancer Piperine. It is a pocket friendly drug technology which reduces the destruction, wastage and elimination of several orally administered drugs inside the body. Definition Bioenhancers are defined as substances that increase the bioavailability and bioefficacy of active substances with which they are combined without having any activity of their own at the dose used. Besides several classes of modern drugs like antibiotics, anti cancer drugs, cardiovascular drugs, anti inflammatory, central nervous drugs, etc., they also increase the bioavailability of vitamins and nutrients. Increased Bioavailabiity means increased levels of drug in the blood stream available for drug action. Increased Bioefficacy means the increased effectiveness of the drug due to increased bioavailability and also due to other mechanisms. Significance of Bioenhancers Due to an increased bioavailability, the dose and cost of active drug can be reduced, making the formulation cheaper and safer, better tolerated, having better efficacy, better compliance and having lesser risk of developing drug resistance as in case of antibiotics. As it benefits the dose economy, it is particularly of great value to poor ill diseased segment of society. For example, by reducing the required dose of expensive toxic Rifampicin by 60 percent, it correspondingly reduces the cost and side effects of Rifampicin while treating the dreaded disease Tuberculosis. History Bioenhancers or bioavailability enhancers as a term and chapter did not exist in any modern scientific literature prior to 1979. The term bioavailability enhancers was first coined in 1979 at Indian Institute of Integrative medicine, Jammu, formerly RRL, Jammu, by Indian scientists (Dr. C. K. Atal, the Director of institute RRL Jammu proposed the hypothesis of increased bioavailability of drugs from a clue during research on traditional medicinal drugs). Subsequently, the concept of bioavailability enhancers was scientifically researched and scientifically established by him and his research team at RRL Jammu. The institute then discovered and scientifically validated Piperine as the world's first bioenhancer using Sparteine and Vasicine which became the world's first experimentally bioenhanced drugs. Dr. Atal also initiated the bioenhanced anti tubercular drug research project using Rifampicin which later resulted in development of world's first bioenhanced anti tubercular drug formulation. This DCGI approved formulation was officially released by Indian government at Anusandhan Bhawan Delhi on world tuberculosis day 2011, and also presented to Mr. Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft same day at a function at Le Meridian in Delhi. After the discovery of bioenhancer Piperine in 1979, a new chapter was added in medical science. Since then it has generated global interest and research in the field and has led to discovery of many other new bioenhancers. Piperine remains the most potent and extensively researched bioenhancer till date. It is safe, effective, extremely economical and easily manufactured for commercial use. It is also a broad spectrum bioenhancer acting on several classes of modern drugs as noted elsewhere. Classification bioenhancers can be classified according to their source of origin, either plant based or animal based or else according to their site of action. Bioenhancers so far almost exclusively discovered in plants, increase the bioavailability of other substances in different ways: * Increase of absorption in the intestine * Inhibition of degradation in the intestine and the liver by inhibition of drug metabolising enzymes (inhibiting first pass mechanism of destruction of drugs). * Inhibition of elimination in the drug in gut and through bile by inhibition of efflux pumps. * Increase of drug permeability of pathogens. * Inhibition of defense mechanisms of pathogens or tumor tissue (such as efflux of drugs) * Increasing binding possibilities on binding sites (such as DNA and proteins) of the pathogen * Improving overcoming of the blood-brain barrier 'Reduced bioavailability of orally administered drugs by Destruction, elimination and wastage inside the body ‚Ä¢ After oral ingestion and absorption, drugs reach the blood stream where the drug needs to attain a certain desired drug level in the blood to cause desired drug action. ‚Ä¢ After oral ingestion and absorption, drugs while passing from the gut via the liver to blood stream are inadequately absorbed, wasted, eliminated and destroyed and therefore a reduced percentage of ingested dose reaches the blood stream resulting in lower drug levels in blood. ‚Ä¢ Therefore, more quantity of drug has to be ingested to compensate for the losses in order to achieve desired blood levels which in turn increase the cost and side effects of drugs. Billions of Dollars are wasted globally in various countries due to poor bioavailability of drugs, which is a huge financial burden on any nation, particularly poor developing countries. This is particularly relevant in serious and dreaded diseases on mankind like tuberculosis for which treatment is expensive, toxic and prolonged and for which an emergency situation has been declared by UN due to emergence of AIDS and development of serious drug resistance. 'BENEFICIAL ROLE OF BIOENHANCERS' Reduced dose- Bioenhancers prevent this wastage of ingested drugs inside the body and increase quantity of drug reaching the blood, therefore a reduced dosage of oral drug is sufficient to achieve the desired blood levels. Reduced burden on raw material of country -This reduced dose needed for desired drug action means beneficial effect on raw materials consumption required to develop drugs which is a great savings for any country. Ecological advantage- This also translates into ecological advantage in case of rare and expensive plant based drugs as less trees or plant have to be consumed to produce drugs, an example being the costly anti cancer drug Taxol derived from very slow growing Yew trees . Reduced drug cost- This reduced dose in turn also reduces the cost of drugs. Reduced adverse reactions- This reduced dose in turn also reduces the side effects of drugs. Improved compliance- Lesser side effects also improve drug tolerability, drug compliance and promote completion of treatment. Reduced drug resistance- This improved tolerability and compliance in turn reduces risk of developing dangerous drug resistance. Added hepatoprotective and gastroprotective actions of bioenhacer piperine reduces gastrointestinal side effects and hepatotoxicity of primary active drug which further makes formulation safer, better tolerated and again reduces drug toxicity and drug resistance. This is a great advantage to poor patients, poor countries and for dreaded diseases of man.  Examples of bioenhancers  The following examples of bioenhancers give an insight into the current pharmacological research and show how with pepper, curry, ginger and other herbal ingredients in food a lack of nutrients or insufficient effects of active agents can be prevented: Piperine, an ingredient of pepper, promotes intestinal absorption by activation of the Œ≥-glutamyltranspeptidase and inhibits the degradation of many compounds, by inhibiting different enzymes: aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH), ethylmorphine N-demethylase, Uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronyltransferase (UGT), P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4. Especially the latter two enzymes contribute significantly to the first-pass effect. Piperine acts as bioenhancer to vitamins (A, B1, B2, B6, C, D, E, K), amino acids (lysine, isoleucine, leucine, threonine, valine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and methionine), minerals (iodine, calcium, iron, zinc, copper, selenium, magnesium, potassium, manganese), herbal compounds (including ginsenosides, Pycnogenol), and drugs (such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, rifampicin, ampicillin, tetracycline, vasicine, pyrazinamide, fexofenadine, resveratrol, epigallocatechin, curcumin). Allicin from garlic enhances the effect of the fungicide amphotericin B on yeast cells by affecting the transport of the fungicide into the yeast vacuole. Curcumin which inter alia is found in curry inhibits like piperine the enzyme CYP3A4 and affects the transport function of P-glycoprotein. In combination with curcumin an increased bioavailability of the active compounds celiprolol and midazolam was detected. Ginger promotes due to the gingerols the intestinal absorption of many compounds (including drugs) and elements. In most cases, ginger acts synergistically with piperine. Glycyrrhizin, a saponin of the liquorice plant, promotes the action of numerous antibiotics and the antifungal agent clotrimazole. Quercetin, a flavonoid from fruits and leaves, acts like curcumin and piperine. It increases the bioavailability of the active agent paclitaxel used to treat cancer. Application of research results The bioenhancer technology is primarily targeted for toxic drugs, expensive drugs, scarce drugs, poorly bioavailable drugs or drugs which need to be given for prolonged periods. However it can also be used in any drugs influenced by bioenhancers. The discovery and characterization of bioenhancers has led to several patent applications. Piperine is marketed as bioenhancer in mono preparations and as a component of dietary supplements that contain different vitamins, curcumin, resveratrol or Coenzyme Q10. Since bioenhancers can reduce the dosage and cost of expensive medication while making treatment safer, its application has for the first time been done in humans in treating tuberculosis for which the existing drugs are toxic and expensive and need to be administered over prolonged periods. In India where low treatment costs for medical care are essential, the drug Risorine is approved against tuberculosis. Besides the antibiotics rifampicin and isoniazid it contains piperine.

Career Wild won a bronze medal in the parallel giant slalom at the 2013 FIS Snowboarding World Championships and gold medals in the parallel slalom and parallel giant slalom at 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which made him the first snowboarder ever to win two medals at the same Winter Games. Wild originally competed for the United States, but after the 2010 Winter Olympics, the United States Ski and Snowboard Association shut down its alpine snowboarding program. According to a 2014 story by Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports, Wild had been viewed by US snowboarding officials \\"as an enfant terrible, someone who didn't understand alpine's place in the [USA] snowboarding power structure. Halfpipe is king, with slopestyle creeping up in importance, and snowboardcross racing third.\\" One of Wild's former coaches indicated that before its closure, the alpine snowboarding program had a budget of $135,000, a fraction of the funding needed for an internationally competitive team. This is mainly caused by the fact that the United States remains the only country in the world not to fund its Olympic Committee, that is why available funding is limited.teamusa.org Instead of ending his career, Wild opted to leave the country; when he married Russian snowboarder Alena Zavarzina in 2011, Wild applied for Russian citizenship. After winning gold for Russia at the Sochi Olympics, Wild commented, \\"Russia is a country that made it possible for me to win. Had I stayed in the US, I'd probably be still sitting at home, doing some ordinary job, doing something banal, and not interesting. I always wanted something different ‚Ä¶ It is just amazing that I won this gold for Russia. Some may think, 'This guy still stays American.' ‚Ä¶ And that is not true! I am not some American guy who decided it would be easier to get to Olympics in a country where snowboarding is undeveloped. I have chosen the harder path to success, and I have walked it all the way.\\"Profile , sovsport.md; accessed February 14, 2014. Wild received more than $400.000 in bonuses from the Russian government for winning two gold medals. He was also presented with a brand new SUV. Unlike the United States, where the Olympic Committee is a non-governmental structure, the Russian government not only funds the Olympic Committee and athletes, but also rewards them with cash for winning medals.https://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45ikgk/russia/#3751b1403088 Wild received the Order For Merit to the Fatherland Award 4th class with Russian President Vladimir Putin handing the state awards.https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-36830502/russia-operated- state-sponsored-doping-programme References External links * FIS- Ski.com Profile Category:Living people Category:American male snowboarders Category:Russian male snowboarders Category:1986 births Category:American emigrants to Russia Category:Russian people of American descent Category:Snowboarders at the 2014 Winter Olympics Category:Snowboarders at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic snowboarders of Russia Category:Medalists at the 2014 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Russia Category:Olympic medalists in snowboarding Category:Sportspeople from Washington (state) Category:People from Klickitat County, Washington Category:Naturalised citizens of Russia ","title":"Vic Wild"},{"id":"38348392","text":"100% may refer to:  Music  * 100% (band), a South Korean all male group * 100% (Beverley Knight album), 2009  100% Tour, a tour to promote the album * 100% (Jimsaku album), 1993 * 100% (Lotta Engberg album), 1988 * 100% (Negazione album), 1990 * 100% (Angela Dimitriou album), 1998 * \\"100%\\" (Big Pun song), 2000 * \\"100%\\" (Lotta Engberg & Triple & Touch song), 1988 * \\"100%\\" (Mariah Carey song), 2010 * \\"100%\\" (Mary Kiani song), 1996 * \\"100%\\" (Senidah and RAF Camora song), 2019 * \\"100%\\" (Sonic Youth song), 1992 * \\"100%\\" (Victor och Natten song), 2016 * \\"100%\\", a song by Angelspit from Krankhaus * \\"100%\\", a song by Moloko from Statues  Other uses  * 100% (comics), a comic published in 2002 and 2003 * 100% (game show), a British game show that aired from 1997 to 2001 * The number one  See also  * Percentage * 99% (disambiguation) * 1% (disambiguation) ","title":"100%"},{"id":"38348416","text":"In mathematics, a Hodge algebra or algebra with straightening law is a commutative algebra that is a free module over some ring R, together with a given basis similar to the basis of standard monomials of the coordinate ring of a Grassmannian.

It was created by Chris Chibnall, who acted as an executive producer and wrote all 24 episodes, and produced by Kudos Film and Television and Imaginary Friends. The series is set in Broadchurch, a fictional English town in Dorset, and focuses on police detectives DI Alec Hardy (David Tennant) and DS Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman). The series features an ensemble cast that in addition to Tennant and Colman includes Jodie Whittaker, Andrew Buchan, Carolyn Pickles, Arthur Darvill, Charlotte Beaumont, Vicky McClure, Adam Wilson and Matthew Gravelle. The first series, which premiered on 4 March 2013, focuses on the death of local 11-year-old Danny Latimer and the impact of grief, mutual suspicion and media attention on the town. Danny's family (his mother, Beth, father, Mark and sister, Chloe) are a key focus for the first series. The second series, which premiered on 5 January 2015, follows the dual storylines of bringing Danny's killer to justice and a case from the past returning to haunt Hardy. The third and final series, which premiered on 27 February 2017, focuses on the rape of a local woman at a birthday party, while the Latimer family go to extreme lengths to move on from Danny's death. Chibnall has indicated that the third series will be the last and that he originally envisioned Broadchurch as being a trilogy. All three series received positive reviews and praise for the writing, cinematography and character development. Episodes Development =Conception= Broadchurch creator and writer Chris Chibnall described the project as a labour of love. He conceived Broadchurch in about 2003 while working on his first series, Born and Bred. The concept was for Broadchurch to explore how a child's murder affects a small, close-knit local community, and how the characters react to the media attention and the mutual suspicion that arises. The series' location was partly inspired by the Jurassic Coast in Dorset, where Chibnall lived. Chibnall says that he initially did not have a location in mind for the series, but the opportunity to improve his work-life balance made setting the show in Dorset appealing. From 2006 to 2011, Chibnall had spent most of his time travelling about the UK and Ireland, working on Torchwood, Law & Order: UK, and Camelot. Setting the show in Dorset meant Chibnall would not have to spend time away from his home and family. Chibnall's decision to set the show on the Jurassic Coast also helped him generate more ideas for the show and tighten the writing. For example, Dorset-born poet and author Thomas Hardy's surname was used for one of the main characters (DI Alec Hardy). Hardy's use of the term \\"Wessex\\" was used to name the fictional Wessex Police, and character Jack Marshall reads the Hardy novel Jude the Obscure. The series' name also came from the Dorset setting. Chibnall invented the name \\"Broadchurch\\" based on two settlements in Dorset: \\"I thought a lot about the literary heritage of this county. In true Thomas Hardy style I came up with a compound location name of Broadchurch combining the hamlets of Broadoak and Whitchurch.\\" =Writing= The Jurassic Coast of Dorset provided inspiration for Broadchurch. Chibnall wrote the script for Broadchurch on spec after his work on Camelot ended. He began using whiteboards in May 2011 to create backgrounds for each character and craft the plot of the series‚Äîwhich he envisioned as being a trilogy. Series one was written to work both as the first of a trilogy and as a self-contained drama. He believed the first series should be self-contained in case the show did not do well in the ratings and a second series was not commissioned. Chibnall was assisted in this process by his friends, Sam Hoyle (a television script executive) and television director James Strong. The series was influenced by two American television shows, Twin Peaks (created by Mark Frost and David Lynch) and Murder One (created by Steven Bochco, Charles H. Eglee, and Channing Gibson). The story was nearly finished on the whiteboards when Chibnall began writing the script. After about two weeks, Chibnall had a draft of the first few episodes, but he had not yet settled on a killer. About two weeks later, Chibnall woke one morning and realised the main suspect should be Joe Miller, DS Ellie Miller's husband. By making Joe the main suspect, Chibnall focused the series more closely on Ellie, and improved the narrative structure of the series so that it became about two families (the Millers and the Latimers). He then redrafted the first script and re-plotted and re- outlined the series. However, Chibnall kept the script loose enough that he could choose another character as the murderer, in case his preferred solution leaked to the press during shooting. Only the first few episodes were written before filming began. Chibnall waited until casting was complete and he saw the actors perform their roles before writing subsequent scripts. These later scripts were shaped to take advantage of each performer's take on their role. =Production approval= In autumn 2011, Chibnall pitched Broadchurch to Laura Mackie, the Head of Drama at ITV, who proved very enthusiastic about the proposal. Just a few days after she finished reading the scripts, she suggested Chibnall contact Kudos Film and Television, a production company. Mackie then brought the show to ITV Director of Television Peter Fincham. Broadchurch was green-lit by Fincham almost immediately for airing in early 2013. Although ITV made a sizeable financial investment in Broadchurch, additional funds were needed because of the cost of the large ensemble cast. Additional funds were sought from international partners, who would then win distribution rights in their territories. Before principal photography began, ZDF (German public-service television broadcaster) and BBC America (the American cable and satellite television network jointly owned by the BBC and AMC Networks) both provided additional funding. Broadchurch was created and written by Chibnall, and produced by Kudos Film and Television in association with Shine America and Imaginary Friends. Chibnall served as executive producer along with Kudos' Jane Featherstone, while Richard Stokes was producer. Series 1 The first series of Broadchurch premiered on 4 March 2013 at 9:00 p.m. on ITV. =Casting= David Tennant joined Olivia Colman as the co-lead in Broadchurch. The role of Reverend Paul Coates was written with actor Arthur Darvill in mind and was the first role cast. The role of DS Ellie Miller was second, as actress Olivia Colman was Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and the role was offered to her without the need for an audition. DI Alec Hardy was the third role cast, and the part was offered to David Tennant without the need for an audition. All the remaining parts were cast through auditions, which took several weeks. Although Chibnall had determined who the murderer was by the time casting began, those who auditioned for the programme were not told the killer's identity. The roles of Mark Latimer (father of the murdered child) and Karen White (a reporter for a national newspaper who comes to Broadchurch to challenge DI Hardy) were cast after Colman, Darvill and Tennant. The role of Beth Latimer was cast after Mark Latimer and Karen White. Matthew Gravelle was cast as Joe Miller, DS Miller's husband, Gravelle auditioned along with many other actors for the role, but Chibnall has said the casting team early on considered Gravelle their top choice for the role. The producers knew this was a critical casting decision: whoever they hired to play Joe Miller would need to act with great power in the final episode, so they researched Gravelle's past acting roles and watched as many of his performances as they could find. Chibnall paid particularly close attention to the Welsh language television series ', in which Gravelle had recently played a lead role. =Principal photography= James Strong directed five episodes of series one of Broadchurch; Euros Lyn directed three. Matt Gray was both director of photography and camera operator, and said he approached Broadchurch as if it were a documentary film, rather than a television drama. In Britain, very few scripted television programs are filmed in the order seen on the air; it is far more common to shoot out-of-order. Usually, scripts are broken down into their component scenes and shots first. Scenes using the same locations or sets are shot at the same time, to minimise the time and expense of moving cameras and equipment. Broadchurch, however, was shot in order, to keep the identity of the murderer a secret until the end of the production. East Cliff and Beach in West Bay, Dorset, provided the scene for Danny Latimer's murder in the series. Most of Broadchurch series one was shot on location to heighten the reality and intimacy of the series, and because the Dorset coast was integral to setting the mood of the drama. The first cast read-through occurred at Bloomsbury Central Baptist Church in London on 7 August 2012. Principal photography began on interior sets at Vision Studios on 13 August 2012. Location shooting began the first week of September. Most location photography occurred in the town of Clevedon in north Somerset. Some scenes were also shot in the towns of Bridport and West Bay in Dorset. Three locations were used in the area around Yate, South Gloucestershire, and two in Bristol. Other filming locations included Shepton Mallet, Portishead, and Weston-super-Mare, and the villages of Eype and Flax Bourton. The oft-seen cliff where Danny Latimer's body is found, and which features heavily in the visuals of Broadchurch, is Harbour Cliff and Harbour Cliff Beach in West Bay. Many of the villages involved in the shooting of Broadchurch received a boost in tourism, especially in West Bay and Bridport. Not all shooting was done on location. Some sets were built at Vision Studios near Bristol, because equipment needs made it impractical to film on location. Two shots required green screen shots to composite images together. These \\"green screen\\" shots were filmed at Waterloo Film Studios in London. Rehearsal on Broadchurch was kept to a minimum. To heighten the raw and tension-filled tone of the show, actors were often prevented from seeing the space they were to perform in until shooting began. Almost no improvisation of dialogue occurred on the set. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right. Director James Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural than subsequent takes. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes. Principal photography on Broadchurch series one concluded on Tuesday, 4 December 2012. =Secrecy= Chibnall was determined to ensure that the identity of the killer did not leak until the final episode aired. One reason for the secrecy was commercial: it encouraged viewers to keep watching. But Chibnall also believed it would enhance the acting, as actors could not in any way telegraph or signal their innocence or guilt. Several means were employed to maintain secrecy. All cast and crew were required to sign documents in which they agreed not to reveal the killer's identity. In part, secrecy was maintained by the way scripts were written. Performers were given the first two scripts at the start of principal photography, but additional scripts were written only after Chibnall had observed the actors bringing their characters to life. Once the scripts for episodes six, seven, and eight were finished, they were released all at once over a single weekend Even after the final three scripts were distributed, just 29 people knew the killer's identity while the final episodes were filmed, including the four cast members critical to the \\"reveal\\". Actor Oskar McNamara, who played Danny Latimer, was informed about the killer's identity several days in advance, in part so that he could prepare and in part so the scene could be choreographed and rehearsed. These three episodes were then shot together. =Music= Icelandic musician √ìlafur Arnalds composed the music and sounds for Broadchurch series one. Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall had long been a fan of Icelandic composer and musician √ìlafur Arnalds, and owned all of his albums. While writing Broadchurch, Chibnall listened constantly to √ìlafur's music. He later told √ìlafur that the \\"entire feel of the show was inspired by\\" his music. √ìlafur agreed to join the production in December 2012. To compose the music for the first series of Broadchurch, √ìlafur read the show's scripts to put himself in the right mood. He also researched sounds which might be heard in the Dorset area. He then improvised at the piano and composed several themes, some for the series as a whole and some for characters. √ìlafur also composed certain sounds using synthesisers and electronic sound generators to go with certain spaces, such as the cliffs. Once he saw the completed footage for the first episode, he rearranged some themes to fit the imagery, and composed some new themes as well. Because there was so little time between his being hired and the air date, √ìlafur composed very quickly and spent very long days at work. He had just four months to generate about 30 minutes of sound and music for each episode, spending one-and-a-half to two weeks on the music for each episode. Despite the time crunch, √ìlafur credited Chibnall's relaxed attitude as the key to the music's success. The music for Broadchurch deliberately avoided a typical orchestral score, which √ìlafur felt sounded too large and perfect. The score was written for a string quartet and piano, accompanied by electronic sound. Recording, which took just five days, was done in an empty church in Reykjavik. The musical soundtrack to Broadchurch series one includes four pieces: \\"So Close\\" (the only one to have lyrics), \\"Suspects\\", \\"Arcade\\", and \\"Broken\\". \\"So Close\\" plays at the end of each episode. √ìlafur collaborated with the singer Arn√≥r Dan of the Icelandic band Agent Fresco, with whom he had worked on his third studio album, For Now I Am Winter, released in February 2013. Arn√≥r wrote the vocal melody, while √ìlafur wrote the rest of the song. Chibnall contributed the lyrics. According to Chibnall, the song holds clues to the killer's identity. The Broadchurch (Music From the Original Soundtrack) extended play album was released on 15 April 2013 by Mercury Classics, a division of Decca Records. A second edition that includes songs from the first two series (excluding \\"Broken\\" from the first edition) was released in January 2015. An album for the third series, titled Broadchurch - The Final Chapter (Music from the Original TV Series) was released on 1 April 2017. Some of √ìlafur's work for Broadchurch appears in the trailer for the Fantastic Four movie reboot. =Media releases= The first series of Broadchurch was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom by Acorn Media UK on 20 May 2013. The series was released on DVD in the United States on 1 April 2014 by Entertainment One. Series 2 After the first series ended, ITV announced that Broadchurch would return for a second series. The show's creator, Chris Chibnall, told The Daily Mirror in the summer of 2013 that \\"the focus of the next series will be on how the shattered community rebuilds itself after the grisly events\\" of series one. Series one actor Will Mellor, who does not appear in series two, strongly implied in an interview that a new murder would not be the focus of the second series, while David Tennant told the Associated Press that the series would go in a \\"very unexpected direction\\" which he called \\"as gripping as the first season.\\" Chibnall said he mapped out the show's plot and characters on several whiteboards in his office. \\"You have to be very methodical,\\" he said about plotting Broadchurch. \\"It's like a mathematical puzzle where you put all these blocks together and move them around for the most satisfying thing.\\" =Casting= David Tennant, Olivia Colman, Andrew Buchan, Arthur Darvill, Jodie Whittaker, Charlotte Beaumont, Joe Sims, Carolyn Pickles, Jonathan Bailey, Pauline Quirke, Tanya Franks, Simone McAullay and Adam Wilson are returning cast members. Neither Tennant nor Colman was contractually obliged to return. Without them, Chibnall said, \\"We would not have done it, absolutely. Luckily they wanted to come back because they weren't contracted to.\\" New series two cast members include Marianne Jean-Baptiste, James D'Arcy, Eve Myles, Charlotte Rampling, Meera Syal and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Rampling plays Broadchurch resident Jocelyn Knight. It was near her home that Danny Latimer argued with the postman a week before his death. Myles plays Claire Ripley, Jean-Baptiste's character is Sharon Bishop and Waller-Bridge plays Abby Thompson. =Secrecy= Before broadcast, the plot of series two was closely guarded. Cast members were sworn to secrecy about the details and required to sign non-disclosure agreements. Actor Andrew Buchan said cast members were told little about the plot, except on a need-to-know basis as they prepared for their performances in each episode. Actor Joe Sims said that actors only receive two scripts at a time to ensure that they did not know where the plot was headed. Several different endings for series two were filmed. In August 2014, Erin Kelly, author of a book adaptation of Broadchurch, said that writer Chris Chibnall inserted a one-line clue about Series 2 into her book three days before the book was due to begin printing. Kelly said the clue comes early in the novel. Although it does not spoil the plot, she said, it does provide a hint about it. The clue involved the argument the postman had with Danny Latimer. Jack Marshall identifies the location as being near Jocelyn Knight's home. On 19 December 2014, ITV revealed that Charlotte Rampling's character is named Jocelyn Knight. =Filming= St Andrew's Church in Clevedon serves as St. Bede's, the Broadchurch parish church. The second series filmed under the code name \\"Tea and Sympathy\\" in Devon, Dorset, North Somerset, and the town of Reading in Berkshire. A car park next to the West Bay Hotel in Bridport served as the production's base camp. Each episode took 12-and-a-half days to film. Filming began in late May 2014. Shooting has taken place outside the George Hotel in Bridport, at a Munchees caf√© in Reading, and at the Riverside Restaurant, Wynn's funfair, the seafront, and The Lazy Lizard nightclub in the town of Weymouth. A few scenes were shot on a beach between Freshwater Beach and East Beach in West Bay. St Andrew's Church in Clevedon has been used to depict the Broadchurch parish church and graveyard. Other Clevedon filming locations include Marshall's Field and Hill Road, and the house used to represent the Latimer family home in Lavington Close. The Forum building on the campus of the University of Exeter was used to represent the Wessex police station, while another campus structure served as a local courtroom. Some filming occurred in Bracknell Forest, in particular the Jennett's Park suburb and the John Nike Leisuresport Complex in Bracknell. The shopping district in Bracknell was decorated to mimic the Christmas holidays for filming. The production team was criticised by the West Bay coastguards in June 2014 for filming too close to the edge of East Cliff at West Bay, Dorset. Severe weather and recent rock-slides left the cliffs unstable, and a coastguard volunteer said the production team should have used stakes, safety lines, harnesses, and helmets. A spokesperson for the Broadchurch production defended the film crew, noting that the production team had received all necessary filming permits, had visited the site numerous times to ensure safety, and taken other reasonable health and safety precautions. James Strong, who directed five of the eight episodes in series one, directed the first two episodes of series two. Jane Featherstone and Chris Chibnall continued as executive producers, with Chibnall acting as lead writer again. Filming for series two of Broadchurch concluded the night of 12 October 2014. Final scenes were shot at the village of Eype in Dorset. =Promotion and broadcast= On 9 November 2014, two 20-second teaser trailers began airing on ITV, each titled \\"The End Is Where It Begins\\". On 16 November 2014, a third 20-second teaser trailer aired on ITV, in two versions, voiced by characters Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller, respectively. These were also titled \\"The End Is Where It Begins\\". A fourth, series two trailer was released on 11 December. The first episode aired on 5 January 2015, on ITV in the UK and TV3 in Ireland. The Canadian TV channel Showcase and TV One in New Zealand both debuted series two on 11 January 2015. and ABC first showed it on 15 February 2015 while BBC America aired the second series in the United States beginning on 4 March 2015. Series 3 On 1 December 2014, a number of media outlets reported that ITV had commissioned a third series of Broadchurch. Later that day, ITV denied that a third series had yet been commissioned. ITV confirmed that Broadchurch, as well as Tennant and Colman, would return for a third series immediately after the series two finale on 23 February 2015, repeating the use of \\"Broadchurch will return\\" after the closing credits. In February 2016, Olivia Colman gave an interview on This Morning where she stated that the final series would be shot in May 2016, and said that she did not yet know anything about the plot. On 12 April 2016, ITV officially announced the casting for the third and final series, with Jodie Whittaker, Andrew Buchan, Arthur Darvill, Carolyn Pickles and Adam Wilson returning. Filming for the third series began in May 2016 and broadcast started on 27 February 2017. Miller and Hardy investigate a serious sexual assault. Creator Chris Chibnall said, ‚ÄúWe have one last story to tell, featuring both familiar faces and new characters. I hope it‚Äôs a compelling and emotional farewell to a world and show that means so much to me.‚Äù Critical reception Series one of Broadchurch won critical acclaim.

This included 6.15 million live viewers (25.2 percent audience share), with another 716,000 viewers (4.4 percent) on time-delayed viewing via digital video recorder, timeshifted channels (+1), and similar media and technologies. This was the best premiere episode of a weekday new drama series in the United Kingdom since ITV's Whitechapel debuted in January 2009. Broadchurch attracted an average weekly audience of 7.1 million \\"live\\" viewers during its run. After accounting for time-delayed viewing, Broadchurch averaged 9.2 million viewers per episode. An average of 8.4 million viewers (33 percent audience share) watched the final episode of Broadchurch. About 8.8 million viewers tuned in at the start of the show, and a peak of 9.3 million viewers saw the murderer revealed. But only 7.9 million viewers remained with the episode after the reveal. Broadchurch series one was not a rating success in all countries, however. When it aired on BBC America in the United States, ratings were negligible. American consumption of the series on iTunes, Amazon.com, and other streaming video sites was also small. The premiere episode of series two drew an average of 7.3 million viewers. for a 30.1 percent share on 5 January 2015. An average of 300,000 viewers watched it on ITV+1 an hour later. The episode opened with 6.8 million viewers at 9 pm, and ended with 8.7 million viewers (with a peak viewership of 8.9 million). Broadchurch was the second-most-watched programme of the evening, with the most-watched being Coronation Street (which had a peak audience of 8.3 million). The series two premiere drew 800,000 (28.1 percent) more viewers than the series one premiere, and was 22.6 percent higher than average ITV viewership (5.2 million) in the same time-slot over the past 12 months. The consolidated rating made this episode the highest rated drama episode on ITV in 2015. But ratings dropped significantly afterward. Viewership for the second episode fell to just 6.11 million viewers (a 22.4 percent share) after accounting for ITV+1 viewership. That was the lowest overnight viewership rating for the series since episode five of series one. It was still good enough to win its timeslot, however. Overnight ratings dropped again for the third episode to just 5.2 million viewers, the lowest for any episode of the series. Overnight viewership dropped again for episode four, reaching a low of 5.6 million viewers. However, the series still won its timeslot, beating Silent Witness. Awards Broadchurch series one was nominated for seven BAFTA awards. Olivia Colman won Best Actress, David Bradley won Best Supporting Actor, and the show was named Best Drama Series. The show competed for the BAFTA Audience Award, but lost to \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (Doctor Who), which Tennant also starred in. At the BAFTA Craft Awards, √ìlafur Arnalds won Best Original Television Music, while James Strong was nominated for Best Director-Fiction for \\"Episode One\\", Mike Jones was nominated for Best Editing- Fiction for \\"Episode Eight\\", Catrin Meredydd as nominated for Best Production Design, and Chris Chibnall was nominated for Best Writer-Drama.

It also won a Peabody Award for its distinguished and meritorious contributions to excellence in quality television. Broadchurch series three won the award for best Crime Drama at National Television Awards in early 2018. This was the first year the award was presented and Broadchurch was competing against Sherlock, Line of Duty and Little Boy Blue. Julie Hesmondhalgh was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role but lost to Vanessa Kirby from The Crown. Adaptations In early 2014, the Fox Broadcasting Company in the United States announced it had licensed the rights to Broadchurch and would produce a U.S. version of the series, to be named Gracepoint. The Fox series also starred David Tennant, was created and written by Chris Chibnall and directed by James Strong.; Fox specifically said Gracepoint would have a different ending from Broadchurch. Gracepoint began airing on 2 October 2014. Following very low ratings, Gracepoint was not renewed for a second season. The French channel France 2, on which Broadchurch aired in February 2014, also announced an adaptation. The French series, produced in association with Shine France, was titled Malaterra and was directed by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade.

Born in Warsaw, she was the eldest child and only daughter of John II Casimir Vasa, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, by his wife Marie Louise Gonzaga. Life The solemn baptism of the Princess took place on 2 August 1650 in St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw, her birthplace. Sacrament was performed by Maciej ≈Åubie≈Ñski, Primate of Poland. Godparents were Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor (for whom Prince Karol Ferdynand Vasa stood proxy) and his recently new consort Eleonora Gonzaga (for whom the Princess Theodora Christine Sapieha stood proxy), and Pope Innocent X (represented by Nuncio Giovanni de Torres). Since her birth, Maria Anna was destined to enter in the Carmelite Order, because her parents are devoted Catholics and planned this for her. Soon her preparation for this began, but she suddenly died aged thirteen months in Warsaw. Maria Anna's funeral took place on 12 August 1651 in the Church of the Carmelite sisters in Warsaw. The little princess was buried in a carmelite habit at the great altar. Her remains were changed from location several times. In 1652, placed in a golden coffin, she was moved to Church of the Holy Spirit, and in 1663 was finally placed under the altar of the Carmelite convent in the old Kazanowski Palace, where the Charitable Center Res Sacra Miser stands today.

The sculpture depicts a female figure in a reclining position on its right side, with its weight supported on its right hand and right leg. The left hand rests on the left thigh, with the left knee slightly raised but feet together. The drapery emphasises the female figure, but the facial features are abstracted and barely picked out, with two holes for eyes. Background Henry Moore was a war artist in World War II. He made a series drawings of people sheltering from The Blitz in the London Underground, usually swathed in thick clothes. These drawings sparked an interest in drapery which was renewed by the classical sculptures that Moore saw during a 1951 trip to Greece. He was attracted by the ability of the drapery to draw attention to some parts of the human form by lying tightly on the shoulders, thighs or breasts while concealing other parts where the wrapping falls slack, and also by the varied textures created by small and large folds in the material. Moore made a series of sculptures of draped human forms in the 1950s after he was commissioned to create a sculpture for the new UNESCO Headquarters building in Paris. He wanted to create a figure in an architectural context, and turned to the seated human form. His Draped Reclining Figure, 1952‚Äì53 was a precursor to these later draped figures. He completed the first major work in the series in 1955, with a maquette, Draped Seated Woman: Figure on Steps (LH 427), cast in a series of 10. This became the working model for the full‚Äìsize sculpture that became his Draped Seated Woman 1957‚Äì58. The reclining figure is a dominant theme of Moore's work, with perhaps half of his sculptures in a reclining position. He made a similar work in a reclining position, Draped Reclining Woman 1957‚Äì58. Moore ultimately abandoned these ideas for the UNESCO commission, and his UNESCO Reclining Figure 1957-58 (LH 416) is a much more abstract reclining form in travertine. Sculpture Moore's sculpture depicts a female figure in a reclining position. It measures approximately long. It is usually displayed mounted on a flat bronze or stone base. Seven casts of the completed sculpture were made for sale, numbers 1 to 6, plus an artist's cast (0/6). They are currently displayed in the UK, Germany and the US: * the Tate Gallery in London (displayed at Glyndebourne) (2/6) * the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at University of East Anglia in Norwich (formerly at Sir Robert Sainsbury's house in Bucklebury) * the Pinakothek der Moderne at the Bayerische Staatsgem√§ldesammlungen in Munich * the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart * the Norton Simon Museum of Art in Pasadena (0/6) * a private collection. The only cast to remain in private hands (5/6) was sold at Christie's in London in June 2008 for nearly ¬£4.3m, from the estate of J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia Simons Miller, formerly displayed at the Miller House and Garden in Columbus, Indiana. The German copies are known as Die Liegende (The Recliner) or Die Grosse Liegende (The Large Recliner).

In 1813, Thurleigh, or Thurley, is recorded as being in the Hundred of Willey and the Deanery of Eaton.

It was used initially for training both RAF and Polish personnel, but in 1942 was turned over to the USAAF and four squadrons of B-17 Flying Fortresses moved in, and over the next three years flew 341 bombing missions. A memorial to these men stands in the village. Events and characters from the USAAF's time at Thurleigh were used as the basis of the novel and film Twelve O'Clock High. After the war the airfield was used by the Royal Aeronautical Establishment for research and development work. The runway was extended, necessitating the closure of the road between Thurleigh and Keysoe, and the demolition of the hamlet of Backnoe End. In 1968‚Äì71 the Commission for the Third London Airport (the \\"Roskill Commission\\") considered Thurleigh as one of its four short- listed sites, along with Cublington, Foulness (later known as Maplin Sands) and Nuthampstead.Roskill (1971). Report, Commission on the Third London Airport. London: HMSO. The RAE was largely closed down in the 1990s and the site is now used by various commercial enterprises. Geography Thurleigh is about 6 miles (10 km) north of the county town of Bedford. As well as the village centre, the parish is spread across five \\"Ends\\", local parlance for a hamlet ‚Äì Church End, Cross End, Scald End, Backnoe End and Park End, covering an area of about six square miles. The land is undulating boulder clay, ranging in height from 200 ft. to 275 ft. above sea level. A stream runs through the Parish to the south forming a valley which cuts through to the underlying Oxford Clay. The countryside around is in the main used for arable farming. A former airfield to the north of the village is now a business park and motor sports track. There are only minor roads in the parish, though the A6 and B660 are just a few miles away. These roads however are used as a rat run and a 2007 survey recorded 600 vehicles per hour on Mill Road during the morning and evening rush hours, and 121 HGV's throughout the day. Demography The population of the civil parish, recorded in the 2001 census, is 696, and their mean age is 38.6 years with 88 of the people being over the age of 65 years. 372 of the population are considered to be economically active. There were 272 dwellings, of which 9 were unoccupied. Economy Part of the site of the former airfield now accommodates Thurleigh Business Park, and the runway is currently used for storage of cars. Another part of the site is used by Bedford Autodrome, a corporate hospitality centre. This includes Thurleigh Museum which is dedicated primarily to the airfield and life in the area during World War 2. Other major employers include Jackson Demolition, Monster Events, Star Hire and a number of agricultural businesses. Community, sport and recreation Regular events are held at the Village Hall, the Church, the Playing Field Club and the parish's only pub, the Jackal. There has been a hall in the village since 1927, and the current building dates from the 1980s. A youth club meets there bi-monthly. The playing field is used for cricket and football, and has a small children's play area. It is a registered charity. The Playing Field Club, built in the 1970s, provides changing rooms for the cricket team, which is the only organised sports team in the village. There are about 30 miles (48 km) of footpaths and bridleways within the parish. There are a few bus services that stop in the village. Thurleigh Primary School and Pre-School takes children aged between 2¬Ω and 11 years old, and Breakfast Club and After-School extends the hours of care for the children of working parents. Older children are served by Sharnbrook Academy. Landmarks St Peters Church, Thurleigh The Parish Church of Saint Peter is a grade II* listed building dating from approximately 1130, with 14th- and 15th-century additions and restored in the 1880s. The former vicarage was finished in 1750 for vicar Robert Lerogne. Other listed buildings include a windmill tower, built c.1890, and dwellings dating mainly from the 17th,18th and 19th centuries. The Baptist Chapel was built in 1888 on the same site as an earlier building. Thurleigh Castle was a medieval timber, motte-and-bailey, castle, but only earthworks survive today. In addition to the USAAF memorial previously mentioned, there is a War Memorial near the church to the men of the village who gave their lives in two world wars. Part of the village is a conservation area. References External links * Thurleigh Parish Website * Thurleigh A History of the County of Bedford, Volume 3, William Page, 1912 * Thurleigh in 1986.
