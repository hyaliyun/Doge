Biography  Holm was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1923 and grew up on a farm near Waiau in North Canterbury. She attended Rangi Ruru Girls' School in Christchurch and studied English and philosophy at Canterbury University College, and Victoria University College in Wellington. = Environmental work = In 1966, Holm moved back to Christchurch and decided to take action against the city's ongoing problems with smog in the winters. She joined the Clean Air Society and served as secretary and president. The society was successful in having the city recognise the role of open fires in homes in the production of smog, and as a result the city passed an open-fire ban. She also worked with the Clean Air Council, the New Zealand Association for Environmental Education, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and Action on Smoking and Health. In 1972, Holm was a representative to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, Sweden. In the 1988 Queen's Birthday Honours, Holm was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the environmental movement. In 2004, she received the Outstanding Contribution Award from Environment Canterbury for her work for clean air and environmental education in the Canterbury Region. In 1979, in collaboration with Julie Fitness, Jean Shalders and the Canterbury Environmental Centre, she helped publish a 27 page booklet about air pollution, covering such topics as where pollutants come from, what harm pollutants do and why Christchurch was, at that time, the air pollution capital of New Zealand. The booklet was republished in 1989 with assistance from a New Zealand Environmental Grant and Epicentre. The Environment and Peace Centre (Epicentre) was a collective of committed to preservation of the environment and working for peace.  Controversy  The open fire ban and later phrase out of solid-fuel burners was, and still is, controversial. Opponents argue that burning wood and coal is less costly and more self-sufficient than cleaner home heating options. The city of Christchurch is prone to air pollution in the winter for a combination of reasons. In winter, when a high pressure system settles over the South Island, it brings cold temperatures and light winds. Locally, air flow is restricted by the terrain and a strong temperature inversion forms. The residents feel the cold. Their response is to fire up their home heating. For many, this means a wood or coal burning fire. With little wind to disperse the coarse particles emitted from home fires, smog builds up under the inversion layer. In summer, it‚Äôs windier and winds tend to blow pollution away. In 1997, there were approximately 15,500 open fires, 3,500 closed coal burners and 31,000 wood burners in the city. In the 1990s the number of high pollution nights per year averaged 30; in 1999 it peaked at 60; in 2018 there were 3. = Historical work = In the 1980s, Holm returned to the University of Canterbury to complete a master's degree in history; she wrote her thesis on her grandfather George and his six siblings, and later published the research as a book, Nothing but Grass and Wind. She was also a keen genealogist and travelled the country visiting cemeteries and photographing headstones. The Canterbury History Foundation awarded Holm the 2005 A. C. Rhodes Memorial Award in recognition of this work. In the same year, she published her book on the lives of early surveyors, and became the first woman appointed an honorary member of the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors. = Publications = *Air Pollution.

Not far from his mother's estate of Rokeby, where he had spent summers, Ferncliff was a working farm with dairy and poultry operations, as well as stables where he bred horses. In 1902, his son and heir John Jacob Astor IV commissioned Stanford White to design a large sports pavilion (called the \\"Ferncliff Casino\\"), which included one of the first indoor pools in the United States. The sports pavilion was later converted into a residence (called \\"Astor Courts\\") for his son, Vincent Astor. After the death of Vincent Astor, the 2,800 acre estate was broken up. Some parcels (such as the gatehouse, staff quarters, teahouse and dairy barns) became private homes. Two hundred acres were donated for the founding of the Ferncliff Forest nature preserve. An additional donation of land led to the establishment of a nursing home and rehabilitation center on the former estate property.Ferncliff Nursing Home and Rehabilitation Center Background William Backhouse Astor Jr. was the son of William Backhouse Astor Sr. (1792‚Äì1875) and his wife, Margaret Rebecca Armstrong (1800‚Äì1872). His mother was the daughter of Senator John Armstrong Jr. and Alida Livingston Armstrong, and she had grown up at the Armstrong estate (La Bergerie) at Barrytown in Dutchess County, New York. William Jr. was born in 1829. His parents purchased his mother's childhood home from her widowed father in 1836. Margaret renamed the estate Rokeby, as the area around the Mudder KillMudder Kill Topo Map in Dutchess County NY reminded her of the glen in Sir Walter Scott's poem of that name. Rokeby became the family's summer home. Upon the death of William Sr. in 1875, Rokeby passed to Margaret Ward Chanler, daughter of William Jr.'s late sister Emily. History William B. Astor Jr.'s Ferncliff mansion, shown and demolished during the 1940s The area that became Ferncliff was first inhabited by the Wawyachtonoc, a tribe of the Mahican confederation, known locally as the Sepasco Indians, after Lake Sepasco. By the early 1800s, the land was occupied by farms. Around 1853, William Jr. purchased several small farms a few miles south of Rokeby. He then established Ferncliff Farm, where he built an Italianate mansion overlooking the Hudson River on River Road in Rhinebeck. He continued to purchase adjoining properties, and the estate eventually had a mile and a half of Hudson River frontage. At Ferncliff, he bred racing and trotting horses.\\"Astor, William\\", The National Cyclopedia of American Biography, Vol.1, J. T.

His father was a wealthy merchant in New York City,\\"Suckley family papers (1791-1885)\\", Clements Library, University of Michigan while Thomas became a property developer in Manhattan. His mother, Catherine was the daughter of John Rutsen, whose maternal grandfather was Gilbert Livingston, son of Robert Livingston, Lord of Livingston Manor. Suckley inherited from his mother 125 acres of land at Mt. Rutsen, on the north of the village of Rhinebeck. In 1876, he donated the land at Mt. Rutsen to the New York Methodist Conference to establish a retirement community for ministers.Morse, Howard Holdridge. Historical Old Rhinebeck, Echoes of Two Centuries, Rhinebeck. 1908, p. 397 By 1900, the farm that supported the retreat was failing, and the Methodist Conference sold 106 acres to John Jacob Astor IV. Apart from operating a working dairy and poultry farm, Astor maintained his father's stables, but switched to breeding hackney and carriage horses. The indoor tennis court In 1902, John Jacob IV commissioned New York architect Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White to design the Ferncliff Casino (the term \\"casino\\" referring to a sports pavilion) for entertaining guests. (It was also known as \\"Tennis House\\".) The Beaux-Arts style building was completed 1904.

At 15, he took part in a work placement opportunity at a recording studio, where he learnt the techniques of audio production. Career beginnings Ed Case began his music career in the illegal rave scene of the late 1980s. This was followed by a stint working in hardcore and drum & bass clubs. Case however made his name in the UK garage scene of the late 1990s. He hosted a show on pirate radio, Freek FM. He released a string of underground hits, including \\"Something in Your Eyes\\" featuring Shelley Nelson,Nick Harvey, which peaked at 38 in the UK top 40. This track represented a dual turning point, since it was the first time Case had had a track chart, and prior, Case had only used vocal samples, and it was the first time he had worked with a live vocalist in his studio. Ed Case achieved a greater level of mainstream pop fame with his remix of Gorillaz' \\"Clint Eastwood\\". He selected that track to remix because the original was 'quite slow', and he thought that his best contribution could be made in the form of a more energetic version, featuring MC Sweetie Irie.

The weapons used are weapons such as hand grenades and explosives intended for either civilian or military use. Legal authorities use the term allm√§nfarlig √∂del√§ggelse genom spr√§ngning (English: damage by explosive blast) and media in Sweden use the shorter term spr√§ngd√•d. This crime was not categorized separately prior to 2017. In 2018 there were 162 explosions, and in the first nine months of 2019 97 explosions were registered, usually carried out by criminal gangs. According to Swedish police commissioner Anders Thornberg in 2019, there is no international equivalent to Sweden's wave of bombings. Usage of hand grenades reached a significant peak in 2016. According to police in Gothenburg and Malm√∂ in 2016, the use of hand grenades by criminals in Sweden is a phenomenon which is unusual for all comparable countries both inside and outside the EU. According to criminologists Manne Gerell and Amir Rostami, the only other country that keeps track of hand grenade explosions is Mexico. While Mexico has a murder rate 20 times that of Sweden, on the specific category of grenade explosions per capita the two countries were comparable at the time. According to police authorities, many of the hand grenades used are weapons which originate from the Yugoslav Wars, and the hand grenades found by the police are exclusively the ex-Yugoslavian M75 hand grenade. Explosions have occurred in both rich and low-income areas. Swedish police do not record or release the ethnicity of convicted criminals, but Linda H Straaf head of intelligence at National Operations Department says they are from poor areas and many are second- or third-generation immigrants. Swedish media sometimes are accused of not covering the topic enough, but a 2019 study by polling company Kantar Sifo found that law and order was still the most covered news topic on Swedish TV and radio and on social media. In 2019, Denmark, worried about the bombings in Sweden, introduced passport controls on its border checkpoints with Sweden for the first time since the 1950s. In September 2019, police in Malm√∂ issued a general warning to be vigilant for explosive devices when walking the city at night.  Perpetrators  According to police the attackers are part of the same gangs which also increasingly engaged in gun crime leading to a wave in shootings. While there were 17 deadly shootings in 2011, there were 45 in 2018. Ethnicity is not recorded and published for either suspect or convicted criminals, but according to police intelligence chief Linda H Staaf many are second or third generation immigrants, are members of disadvantaged groups and have grown up in disadvantaged areas.  Geographic distribution  Most of the attacks were earlier recorded in low-income suburbs in Malm√∂, Gothenburg and Stockholm. In a more recent trend, more affluent districts also experienced attacks, such as a detonation in Bromma.  Timeline of noted bombings  According to a December 2018 Swedish Television interview with researcher , Sweden has a high number of hand grenade attacks compared to neighbouring countries Denmark, Norway and Germany. While gun homicides were on the rise in the 2011-2018 time span, according to a study at Malm√∂ University the number of hand grenade attacks had shown a strong increase in the same period and a total of 116 hand grenade detonations were recorded. Rostami said criminologists in Sweden do not know why there was a strong increase and why Sweden has a much higher rate than countries close by. = 2012 = In 2012 the Swedish National Forensic Centre investigated 88 incidents involving explosives. = 2014 = * 1 December, Malm√∂: Malm√∂ District Court was targeted by a bomb attack which was powerful enough to destroy the entrance of the building and also damaged windows and balconies of nearby buildings in a detonation which caused no personal injury.

He had experience in combat, territorial and education. Much of his career was spent in special forces, Sandhi Yudha RPKAD Group (Kopassus) and later at the Kostrad 17th Airborne Infantry Brigade. Early life He was born at Tarutung, North Tapanuli, North Sumatra, Indonesia (then Dutch East Indies) on 17 June 1939. He was the 5th son of 10 brothers from the couple Amin Husin Abdul Mun'im Tanjung and Siti Rawani Hutagalung. The middle name \\"Edno\\" in the name is adjusted to the order of birth (E is the 5th letter of the alphabet). He was a Batak by ethnicity with Muslim religious faith. Career Feisal Tanjung had served in ABRI after graduating the National Military Academy in 1961. After serving at the Pattimura Military Command, he served in the Army Regiment Command (RPKAD). In the 1960s, the name Tanjung Company was a legendary company'. He was involved in the cleansing of the PKI in Java and had led Operation Lembah X in Papua. His career was spent in Kostrad, RPKAD (now Kopassus), then the Infantry Armament Center. He was once Commander of the Kodam in Kalimantan (Tanjungpura). From Tanjungpura, Feisal Tanjung was later appointed as Commander of Seskoad in 1988 and has long held that position. Feisal Tanjung holds the rank of major general for 7 years. The name of the Seskoad Commander Maj. Gen. Feisal Tanjung began to become a hot discussion after becoming the DKM (Military Honorary Council) for the Santa Cruz tragedy in Timor Leste in 1991. President Soeharto's appointment of Feisal Tanjung at that time surprised many people because at that time the Army Chief of Staff Edi Sudrajat did not recommend his name as a candidate for the DKM chairman. The most tangible results of the DKM recommendations were the removal of General Maj. Gen. Sintong Panjaitan - one of the officers who shined at that time - from the post of Udayana Military Commander. In addition, Brigadier General Rudolf Warouw was also dismissed from the Commander of the East Timor Operations Command with Captain Choki Aritonang and several of his subordinates as executing officers in the field. Everything was removed as a reaction of the government was adopting international demands for the responsibility for riots in Santa Cruz, East Timor which tarnished the image of the Republic of Indonesia at that time. While serving as Commander of the Armed Forces, there was friction between the stronghold of General TNI Feisal Tanjung and the stronghold of TNI General R. Hartono (KSAD), as well as rumors of the classification of ABRI Hijau and ABRI Merah Putih.

ABRI Commander Feisal Tanjung, who at that time was the Head of ABRI's General Staff (Kasum), had not previously been predicted as a candidate for the Commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces, considering that at that time there was another strong candidate, TNI General Wismoyo Arismunandar who was then serving as Army Chief of Staff (KSAD). Feisal Tanjung is an ABRI officer who holds the highest position without going through the KSAD level. Previously, TNI General LB Moerdani also drove to the position of ABRI Commander without going through the KSAD position, but from the position of Defense and Intelligence Assistant / ABRI / Kopkamtib concurrently Deputy Head of BAKIN. Family life Feisal Tanjung was married to Dr. Masrowida Lubis. They had three children, Astrid Tanjung, Yasser Tanjung, and Yusuf Tanjung.

During her first years Link√∂ping sailed as a merchant in the North Sea and the Baltic but was sold in 1882 to the wealthy coffee trader and businessman Antoine Cyrille Frederik Gam√©l in Copenhagen. The ship was renamed Dijmphna in memory of Gam√®l's mother, Maria Dijmphna Verves, reinforced for sailling in ice and equipped as polar expedition vessel, all paid for by Gam√®l.  The Dijmphna expedition  The purpose of the expedition and the reason for purchasing the ship was the idea proposed by Andreas Peter Hovgaard that an undiscovered land mass existed north of the Taymyr Peninsula. The aim of the expedition was to find this land mass and follow the eastern coast towards the North Pole. The expedition was a contribution to the first International Polar Year and one of the goals was to join with the Dutch expedition led by Maurits Snellen, on the Norwegian polar ship Varna. Route of the Dijmphna expedition in the Kara Sea Dijmpna left Copenhagen on 18 July 1882, with provisions for 27 months, and two weeks later than Varna had left Amsterdam. Leader of the expedition was Andreas Peter Hovgaard, with lieutenants Niels Theodor Olsen and Alfred Garde as second and third commanding officers. On board was also the botanist Theodor Herman Holm. The expedition sailed along the coast of Norway, across the Barents Sea and to the southern tip of Novaja Zemlja, which was reached on 7 August 1882. Heavy drift ice was encountered in the Kara Sea, preventing further progress. Botanical studies were undertaken on Novaja Zemlja while waiting for ice conditions to improve. Only a month later, on 7 September, did Dijmphna make its way into the Kara Sea. Here the expedition rescued a Russian hunter, Bibikof, who had been stuck on Novaja Zemlja for two years. After Bibikof had been sailed to the mainland, south of Vaygach Island, Dijmphna finally made contact with Varna. Varna was stuck in the ice and as Dijmphna tried to assist her, Dijmphna itself got stuck as well. On Christmas Eve 1882 the ice movements became so violent that Varna was crushed and the crew was transferred to Dijmphna to overwinter on the small ship together with its own crew. The ice did not loosen grip of the ships before the middle of July 1883, where Varna finally sank and Dijmphna could continue its voyage. Snellen continued his studies, now from small boats and sledges, along the coast of Novaja Zemlja. On 25 August 1883 Snellen and his crew met the ship A.E. Nordenski√∂ld, sent to look for them, and they were brought back to Hammerfest, where they could wire a message to Gam√©l that Dijmphna and crew were fine. That was the first sign of life heard from Dijmphna for more than a year. However, the trouble for Dijmphna was not over. On 2 August, the day after Snellen left the ship, the propeller shaft broke and the ship was again stuck in the ice. The ice did not loosen its grip until 13 September, where they could continue by sail and warping, until they finally arrived at Vard√∏, Norway in beginning of November. Here they were able to repair the ship and continue the journey homeward. Dijmphna made a short call in Gothenburg and finally arrived in Copenhagen on 9 December 1883, to receive a royal welcome.

Ukrainian cyclist, sportsman and aviator. He was the second Russian pilot after Mikhail Efimov. Utochkin had a nickname \\"the Man of all kind of sport\\" and \\"the Academician of sports\\" - swimming, diving, rowing and sailing, running, pistol shooting, ice skating, fencing, soccer, tennis, horse riding, wrestling, boxing. One of the most notable natives of the Black Sea port of Odessa in the early years of the 20th century.Bio Biography Sergey Utochkin was born in 1876 in the family of an Odessa merchant. Parents died early, so Seryozha and his two brothers grew up and were brought up ‚Äúin people‚Äù. At one time, he lived with a gymnasium teacher, an alcoholic, who hanged himself in the attic at the next binge. The wife, having discovered the dead spouse, went crazy with grief and stabbed her children with a kitchen knife. Utochkin was saved by a miracle, but remained a stutter for life. For the first time Utochkin took off in a balloon on October 1, 1907. He flew over Odessa - at an altitude of 1,400 meters. Alexander Kuprin, who, together with Sergey, overcame about 20 versts in 12 minutes, testified: ‚ÄúI would, without thinking for a second, fly with our pilot on his future airplane.‚Äù Kuprin described this man with these words: > ‚ÄúHe was taller than average, stooped, long-armed, red-haired, with blue eyes > and white eyelashes, all freckled. He always dressed elegantly, but, as is > often the case with very muscular people, the dress on him sat a little > baggy. He shaved his mustache and beard and wore a direct thorough parting, > which gave his face a resemblance to the face of an English boxer, circus > artist or jockey. He was ugly, but in moments of revival - in a smile - > charming. Of the many people I have seen, he is the most striking figure in > terms of originality and spiritual scope.‚Äù Spring of 1910, in Odessa rich paper publisher of \\"Southern Thought\\" Baron S. Ksidias bought a plane. Sergey Utochkin asked permission from Ksidias, got on an airplane, looking like a huge boxed kite, took off and flew without any instruction and training - a rare case in the history of aviation. Facts One of his flights to Nizhyn was enthusiastically watched by young Sergei Korolev, future general designer and creator of spacecraft. For three years, Sergei Utochkin traveled to 600 large and small cities of the Russian Empire, where he flew an airplane in front of the public. Utochkin was the first man who rode down the famous Potemkin Stairs by cycle and car. In 1962, Dovzhenko Film Studios in Kiev released a film about Sergey Utochkin - ‚ÄúIn the Dead Loop‚Äù, where the star of Soviet film actor Oleg Strizhenov starred.

During outbreak, 1062 people were infected with Rift Valley fever and 394 people died between December 2006 and December 2007. Rift Valley fever (RVF), a phlebovirus in the bunyaviradae family transmitted by mosquito bite and contact with infected animal blood, mainly infect livestock that come into infectious contact with a viral reservoir but human beings can also be infected. The outbreak began after a heavy El Ni√±o rain season across East Africa left greater than usual breeding ground for aedes aegypti mosquitos, with particularly heavy rainfall of over eastern Kenya, central Tanzania, and southern Somalia. While most people infected with the virus experience a relatively mild, flu-like illness without hospitalization, around 8% will develop a severe illness that can include eye disease, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever and death. During this outbreak, 37% of the 1,062 hospitalized, lab-confirmed RVF cases (via anti-RVF ImG) assays turned out to be fatal. Boran cattle in Kapiti, Keya. Butchering livestock transmitted the virus.  Epidemic  Marshlands west of Lake Baringo were flooded, contributing to populations of mosquitos that could spread RVF. = Kenya = Unusually heavy rains in Kenya's eastern and coastal regions caused widespread flooding in October 2006 and provided extensive breeding grounds for mosquitos capable of transmitting Rift Valley fever. On 30 November 2006 a man identified as the RVF index case began to show symptoms in Kenya's Garissa County, and he checked into a hospital the next day. By mid-December, the Ministry of Health had received reports of deaths from an illness featuring fever and generalized bleeding. Mild cases had likely gone undetected for weeks before the region's mosquito populations climbed after one of the area's heaviest recorded rain seasons. 11 deaths from RVF were reported in Garissa by December 20. Cases of began to cluster in Garissa and Baringo counties areas that had been having high livestock mortality and morbidity rates, which attracted the Kenya Ministry of Health's attention. The WHO alerted the Global Outbreak and Response Network (GOARN) on December 22 and, in response to a January 2 request for help, sent an 11-member team from GOARNS partners to assist the Ministry of Health in addition regional, provincial governments. The outbreak peaked on December 27, when Garissa's authorities issued a ban on slaughtering livestock. Other county's began to follow suit with their own bans on the slaughtering of animals, wary of transmission from slaughtered animals. The Baringo district experienced a total of 169 cases of RVF. A ban on the slaughtering of animals was imposed by the Kenyan Ministry of Health. = Somalia = Heavy rainstorms over southern Somalia in December brought about and influx of mosquitos that quickly spread the disease among domestic herds. By late December, 3 cases had been confirmed in Lower Juba and dozens of other cases were suspected across Somalia's southern regions. On 20 February 2007, 51 deaths were reported in Somalia. = Tanzania = Cases of RVF were first reported in livestock on 18 January 2007, with the first human case being confirmed in the Arusha region in mid-February. By mid-March, new clusters of the disease were detected in the Dodoma and Morogoro regions. By 3 May 2007, 264 cases and 109 deaths had been confirmed by authorities.  International response and research  In Kenya the CDC Atlanta-Special Pathogens Branch began training staff for the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, sending them a PCR testing machine and reagents for detecting RVF in samples. The United Nations Emergency Coordination group send funding and equipment to Tanzania, while the WHO sent teams to train Tanzania's clinicians in patient care and diagnostic testing. Virologists collected over 296,000 mosquitos and tested over 72,000 for Rift Valley Fever via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, with positive results from mosquitos in the Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, and Masonia species. The virus was also observed for the first time to be infecting Ae. pembaensis, Cx. univitattus, and Cx. bitaeniorhynchus mosquitos. Most human cases were the result of viraemic exposure to animal tissue.  Aftermath  The last case of RVF was confirmed in the Rift Valley Province and died in the Baringo District on 9 March 2007. At least 394 hospital confirmed cases of RVF were ultimately fatal. The outbreak highlighted the necessity of monitoring livestock for RVF before disease can become widespread enough in herds to significantly spread to humans. Even though animals in Baringo County had shown signs of disease since December 2006, the first human case was not reported until 25 January 2007. The CDC in partnership with the University of Edinburgh began establishing surveillance teams to monitor emerging pneumonias, diarrheal disease, and febrile illnesses West Kenya's domestic animal herds, with the goal of such increased surveillance being to detect future outbreaks in animals before they reach humans.

Of Icelandic heritage, he specialised in the early medieval period and Norse history. He was the author of Early Voyages and Northern Approaches, the first volume in the Canadian Centenary Series, a collection of historical texts by leading historians to commemorate the centennial of Canada in 1967. Early Voyages and Northern Approaches proved controversial because of Oleson's theory that the Thule culture, the predecessor of the Inuit, was the result of inter-mingling between Norse people from Greenland and Iceland, and Arctic inhabitants of the pre-existing Dorset culture. This thesis helped explain the origins of the Thule culture, and the contemporaneous gradual disappearance of the Norse settlements in Greenland. The book attracted considerable academic criticism, but Oleson was not able to publish any rebuttals as he died shortly after it was published.  Early life and family  Oleson was born in 1912 in the village of Glenboro, Manitoba, to Gudni Julius Oleson and Gudrun Kristin Thomson, who were from the Icelandic community at Gimli, Manitoba. He studied history at the University of Manitoba with an interest in early medieval European history and the Norse culture, graduating with an MA in Roman history in 1936. He went on to post-graduate studies at the University of Toronto, including studying at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. His dissertation was published in 1955 as The Witenagemot in the Reign of King Edward the Confessor.Memorable Manitobans: Tryggvi Julius Oleson (1912-1963). He married Elva Hulda Eyford. The couple had three children.  Academic career  = Teaching = Returning to Manitoba, Oleson began his teaching career at the Jon Bjarnason Academy, a private Icelandic school in Winnipeg. He later lectured in history at the University of British Columbia and at United College (now the University of Winnipeg).The Norsemen in America (Ottawa: Canadian Historical Association, 1963) (CHA Historical Booklet No. 14), p. 2. In 1950, he joined the history department at the University of Manitoba,J.M. Bumsted, \\"Oleson, Tryggvi Julius\\", in Dictionary of Manitoba Biography (Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press, 1999), p. 192. becoming a full professor in 1957. Oleson was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1956. He was inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. = Early Voyages and Northern Approaches = In the early 1960s, two major Canadian historians, Donald Creighton and W.L. Morton, planned the Canadian Centenary Series as a centennial project to commemorate the centennial of Canadian Confederation. They envisioned a multi-volume historical series written by leading historians, covering the history of Canada up to 1967. They asked Oleson to write the first volume in the series, covering the early European explorations in what became Canada. Oleson published Early Voyages and Northern Approaches in 1963.Tryggvi J. Oleson, Early Voyages and Northern Approaches (Toronto: McClelland and Stewart Ltd., 1963. The book covered two different aspects of the early European explorations: the westward expansion of the Norse, to Iceland, Greenland and the northern portions of Canada, and later European explorations in the Arctic, primarily by English explorers searching for the North-West Passage to Asia. His primary thesis in relation to the early Norse explorations was that the Thule culture of the High Arctic was the result of inter-marriage and cultural fusions between the Norse settlers of Greenland, moving west into the Arctic, and the pre-existing Dorset culture. In support of this thesis, Oleson relied on his interpretation of archaeological evidence, such as the structure of stone shelters in the eastern Arctic which he saw as similar to Icelandic structures; the development of a sea-culture including whaling from small boats, which he saw as similar to Norse practices, and a body of academic historical research from Icelandic scholars, which was not generally available to Canadian researchers.Graham A. MacDonald, \\"Tryggvi J. Oleson and the Origins of Thule Culture: A Controversy Revisited\\", Manitoba History, Number 15, Spring 1988. He also relied on the Norse sagas, which have several descriptions of encounters between Norse and indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Oleson's thesis also helped to explain the gradual disappearance of the Norse settlements in Greenland. In his view, they did not simply disappear; rather, the Norse gradually fused with the Dorset peoples of the High Arctic. = Academic response = Oleson's thesis was controversial and attracted considerable opposition and critical reviews, particularly from practitioners of Arctic archaeology. The prevailing interpretation was that the Thule culture had its origins in Alaska and had moved eastward. Oleson's thesis was that the Thule originated in the eastern Arctic and gradually moved westward. Several reviewers challenged Oleson's interpretation,David B. Quinn, \\"Review: Early Voyages and Northern Approaches, 1000‚Äì1632 by Tryggvi J. Oleson\\" Canadian Historical Review, Volume 46, Number 1, March 1965.J. H. Parry, \\"Reviewed Work: Early Voyages and Northern Approaches, 1000-1632 by Tryggvi J. Oleson\\", Speculum, Vol. 40, No. 3 (Jul., 1965), pp. 533-535. particularly William Taylor, who was one of the leading experts in Arctic archaeology at the National Museum of Canada,William E. Taylor, Jr., \\"Reviewed Work: Early Voyages and Northern Approaches by Tryggvi J. Oleson\\", Arctic, Vol. 17, No. 1 (March 1964), pp. 61-62. as well as Wilcomb E. Washburn from the Smithsonian Institution.Wilcomb E. Washburn, \\"Review: Early Voyages and Northern Approaches, 1000‚Äì1632\\", American Historical Review, Volume 70, Issue 3, April 1965, pp. 802‚Äì803. The one contemporary review which was more favourable was from Thomas E. Lee, another archaeologist from the National Museum of Canada, who wrote that he had read Oleson's \\"tremendous work\\" six times, cover to cover, and thought it was \\"...by far the most important and instructive single work to come out of Arctic research in this field in recent times.\\"Thomas E. Lee, ‚ÄúReview,‚Äù Culture, 28 (1), 1967. The general editors of the Centenary Series were somewhat taken aback by the criticism and sometimes hostile reaction to Oleson's book, but were hampered in their ability to respond by his death. The approach which they took was to re-issue the book five years later, and to include some of the critical response to the thesis of cultural fusion as a forward to the text. More recently, there has been a re-examination of Oleson's work and treatment of his sources, and a more favourable view of his position has sometimes been stated.  Death  Oleson died in 1963, shortly after Early Voyages and Northern Approaches was published.

A notable victim of relegatio was Ovid. Origins Under the early Republic, citizens could be cut off from the community ‚Äì fire and water ‚Äì by the ‚Äòinterdictio aquae et ignis‚Äô; and to forestall this sometimes went into voluntary exile (exilium), where citizenship might be maintained or lost, but property would normally be retained. By contrast relegatio was mainly employed to expel foreigners from Rome: only under the late Republic did it begin to be applied to political figures within Rome. Under the empire The emperors made relegatio one of their main weapons of banishment, alongside deportatio. Relegatio might be for a specific period or for life; it might be to a fixed spot, or simply outside Rome/Italy: thus Tacitus describes how one senator ‚Äúchose the famous and agreeable island of Lesbos for his exile‚Äù. In any case it remained a softer penalty than the alternative of deportatio, which generally entailed loss of citizenship and property as well as banishment to a specific spot. Ovid in his exile made play of the fact that he remained a citizen in charge of his property in Rome, though he was unable either to have his relegatio rescinded, or his exile switched to a pleasanter spot. By contrast, Juvenal (at least in Gilbert Highet‚Äôs reconstruction) was subjected to deportatio; and though his sentence was eventually repealed he returned to Rome a ruined man. Under the later empire, jurists set up a hierarchy of banishments: temporary relegatio/permanent relegatio/relegation to an island or fixed spot/deportatio. Cultural echoes Epictetus praised a stoic senator who heard he had been condemned in his absence: ‚Äú ‚ÄòTo exile‚Äô, says he, ‚Äòor to death?‚Äô - ‚ÄòTo exile‚Äô - ‚ÄòWhat about my property?‚Äô - ‚ÄòIt has not been confiscated‚Äô - ‚ÄòWell then, let us go to Arica [first stop outside Rome] and take our lunch there‚Äô‚Äù.

Conditions and situations for these sorts of military victories against the odds have been numerous. Some victories have been pivotal to the conflict they were part of, or provided inspiration for the other forces. In many cases, because of the heroic and remarkable nature of the victories, the events have become famous in that culture. In many cases, they have lifted morale of the forces, and been remembered many years, if not hundreds of years later, by that culture or historians.  Situational conditions for military victories against the odds  There are often similar factors involved that contributed to victories by a force that is in the minority, in terms of numbers. Sometimes military victories against the odds are achieved because the larger force is caught unexpectedly, where the smaller force has surprised the larger force giving it an advantage. In some cases, complacency is a factor - the larger force is unprepared for a serious battle because of their distinct size advantage, underestimating. This was the case at Battle of Okehazama where the larger force was so confident, they had started drinking in the encampment, when the smaller force attacked. In some cases, either by luck or good management, the smaller force killed the leader and the larger force broke upon the break down of the chain of command. This was the case at the Battle of Galveston and the Battle of Okehazama where both leaders were killed and the remaining forces, while still larger, left the combat.Johnson, Rob \\"Outnumbered, Outgunned, Undeterred: Twenty Battles Against All Odds\\" Thames & Hudson, 1 Oct. 2011 In some cases, the soldiers in the minority, while fighting a larger force, were simply better trained or had better morale. This was the case at the Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814) where the British regulars, well trained and with good morale, charged less well trained US troops, and forced them to flee, even though outnumbered 12 to 1. In some cases, subterfuge was used. In WW2, a group of just 5 Germans under the command of Fritz Klingenberg, fought Garrison troops and captured the city of Belgrade with thousands of troops in it, by pretending to be an entire army.  Famous military victories against the odds  = Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814) = The battle of Lacolle Mills (aka the second battle of Lacole Mills), occurring on 30 March 1814 during the War of 1812, saw just 80 British 13th Regiment of Foot (later reinforced), in combat with a much larger force of 4000 US troops (who were also armed with artillery). Being bombarded by artillery from the US forces, the leader of the British forces, Richard Handcock initially only had 80 British regulars entrenched in the Lacolle Mill against the overwhelming force. The stout stone blockhouse resisted most of the US artillery John K Mahon \\"The War of 1812\\" Di Capo 1972 p 217 Desperate, and running low on ammunition, Handcock's 80 men fixed bayonets and charged the US artillery, but was pushed back because of the overwhelming numbers. However, a French Canadian force of 400 in the area, hearing the gunfire, came to Handcock's aid. With the new men, Handcock again fixed bayonets and charged the artillery position, this time overwhelming them. The US troops, 4000 strong, fled the battlefield against the British/Canadian forces who only numbered some 500 in total. Major General James Wilkinson, the US commander, was subsequently relieved of command. John K Mahon \\"The War of 1812\\" Di Capo 1972 p 217The battle was a major triumph for the British troops. = Battle of Okehazama = This battle saw an army of 30,000 samurai led by Imagawa Yoshimoto defeated by a smaller army of just 3000 led by Oda Nobunaga. The smaller army made the pretense of being in camp, while actually sneaking out. Because of the size advantage, the larger army was in camp and celebrating previous victories. The smaller army attacked the large army, who were still in their camp and in complete disarray. The larger army panicked and fled in disorder. In the confusion, the leader of the larger force, Imagawa Yoshimoto came out of his tent, assuming the noise to be his own drunken men, and was killed by the invading force. = Battle of Brownstown = In the war of 1812, 24 Native Americans attacked 200 US troops. ‚ÄúA PROBLEM IN LOGISTICS.‚Äù The War of 1812 in the Old Northwest, by Alec R. Gilpin and Brian Leigh Dunnigan, Michigan State University Press, 1958, p 97 The US troops approached a forest and were fired at from the Indians hidden in it, at which point some of the US infantry fled. The leader of the US troops, Major Thomas Van Horne then ordered a withdrawal, at which point the whole US unit broke and fled in disorder. The Indians achieved the military victory against the odds, even though they were outnumbered 8 to 1. ‚ÄúThe Militia and the War in the West.‚Äù Citizen-Soldiers in the War of 1812, by C.

Quimby, Michigan State University Press, 1997, page 39. = Battle of Longewala = This battle saw 4000 Pakistani soldiers and 40 tanks attack 150 Indian troops, with a detachment of 10 camels and 1 jeep. The Indian troops used subterfuge, stringing barbwire and putting up minefield markers, in areas where there were in fact no mines. The Pakistani units were forced through inferior terrain and funneled into kill zones where the numerical advantage didn't help them. The Pakistani advance stalled, not able to advance, and then eventually retreated once more Indian troops arrived. The Pakistani forces lost 200 troops in total, compared to Indian losses of just two men, and 5 camels. James Hatter, writing in the British media at the time, compared it to the Battle of Thermopylae. = Battle of Gate Pa = The Battle of Gate PƒÅ on 29 April 1864, battle saw a larger, better armed group of British regulars attacking Maori warriors in New Zealand. The British commander, with 1700 men, attacked a group of 200 Maori. Prickett, Nigel. ‚ÄúMAORI CASUALTIES AT PUKEHINAHINA (GATE PA), 29 APRIL 1864.‚Äù Records of the Auckland Museum, vol. 41, 2004, p. 41 The Maori, through subterfuge and successful ambush techniques, beat the British, resulting in 31 British being killed and 80 wounded, and then left the area. 25 Maori died in the engagement.

The massive but piecemeal Zulu attacks on Rorke's Drift came very close to defeating the much smaller garrison. After repeated attacks, the Zulu force was depleted and no reinforcements were sent for further assaults on the position. Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to the combatants, it was the largest amount of Victoria cross medals awarded by the British Government at any one battle.Perrett, Bryan \\"Last Stand: Famous Battles Against The Odds\\" Cassell Military Paperbacks Chapter 5. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the British lost only 17 dead to 351 Zulus. Cormac O'Brien \\"Outnumbered: Incredible Stories of History's Most Surprising Battlefield Upsets\\" Fair Winds Press 2010 = Agincourt = The Battle of Agincourt (1415) saw a depleted English army, led by Henry V and composed of 3000 longbowmen, achieve victory over a superior French army of 30,000 cavalry and heavy infantry. The English achieved this unexpected victory through a combination of better tactics, favorable terrain, and the missile superiority of the longbow.Cormac O'Brien \\"Outnumbered: Incredible Stories of History's Most Surprising Battlefield Upsets\\" Fair Winds Press 2010Bennett, Matthew \\"Agincourt, 1415: Triumph Against the Odds\\" Prager Publishing, 2005 Henry V personally led his troops into battle and participated in hand-to-hand combat. The English adopted a defensive stance, erecting wooden fortifications and raining down arrows on the advancing French army. When the English archers ran out of arrows, they dropped their bows and using hatchets, swords, and the mallets they had used to drive their wooden stakes in, counterattacked the now shaken, fatigued, and wounded French men- at-arms massed in front of them. The French forces had sustained heavy losses, and were bogged down in the mud and encumbered in their heavy plate armor. The counter-attack from the English was a decisive blow, and the rest of the French army, having witnessed the slaughter, fled the field of battle. Henry V's victory at Agincourt, against a numerically superior French army, crippled France and started a new period in the war during which Henry V married the French princess Catherine, and their son, Henry, was made heir to the throne of France as well as of England. The battle saw the death of between 6000 and 9000 French troops, with comparatively few English losses. = Capture of Belgrade by Fritz Klingenberg = During World War II Fritz Klingenberg, leading a reconnaissance patrol into Belgrade, sneaked into the city through enemy lines with just 6 men. The Yugoslav Army had thousands of men stationed in the capital, having retreated to the city from the countryside in order to make a defense against the invading German army. After a number of firefights with Yugoslav troops, Klingenberg made his way to the centre of the city. Using captured trucks, and parading captured Yugoslav troops, he presented himself to the Mayor, pretending to be a larger force. The Mayor surrendered to his forces, at which point Klingenberg gathered a number of German flags from the embassy and ran them up various flagpoles in the city. The Yugoslav troops gave up, believing that there had been a general surrender. Shortly, another smaller force of 15 Germans came into the city and started also pretending to be a larger group, by driving captured vehicles repeatedly around the city so as to appear to be greater in number. Sometime later, the actual German Army arrived at the outskirts of the city, expecting to have to fight their way into the city (which had a substantial troop presence), they for a while refused to believe the city had been captured by Klingenberg. Belgrade was then fully occupied by the German Army later the same month and Belgrade became the seat of the puppet Nediƒá regime, headed by General Milan Nediƒá. Klingenberg was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for the capture of the city. See also *List of military disasters. *Last stand.

Outside his work in comics, Cavedon was also an accomplished musician, being a member of the Milan College Jazz Society and had the desire to become a filmmaker. In 1953 he shot a short documentary on 16mm and the next year his short film Arturo was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Cavedon would casually return to the film industry in the next few years, including Renato Dall'Ara's assistant on Scano Boa and directing a part of the anthology comedy film I soldi. His comic Isabella was published between April 1966 and October 1976 with 263 issues. The comic was later adapted into a film by Cavedon and directed by Bruno Corbucci in his film Ms. Stiletto.. Cavedon and Barbieri created several other comic series following Isabella such as Jacula, Hessa, Lucrezia, Messalina, Lucifera, and Jungla. Barbieri and Cavedon parted ways with Barbieri in 1972 creating his own company which was the biggest rival to Cavedon's group in the 1970s for erotic comics.

The Old Netherlands Bank building (, ) is a building on Church Square in the South African administrative capital of Pretoria. The building carries the name of the former Nederlandsche Bank voor Suid-Afrika (now Nedbank) and is one of the protected buildings on the western side of the Square.  History  = Bank building = On March 23, 1888, the Nederlandsche Bank en Credietvereniging voor Zuid-Afrika (\\"Dutch Bank and Credit Union for South Africa\\") was founded in Amsterdam. The same year, a primary branch office was established in Pretoria, the capital of the then South African Republic (ZAR). By 1898, the bank had already opened four branches in the Republic. Dutch architect Willem de Zwaan was commissioned thus in 1896 to designed a building for the Netherlands Bank. He designed it in the Dutch Renaissance style. All the wrought iron work was done by the F.W. Braat company out of Delft, Netherlands. On December 2, 1997, the bank opened its doors in the new building. When completed, it was the Netherlands Bank's third branch, and was one of seven bank branches located around Church Square. In 1914, a fire destroyed the second (top) floor of the building. When the Old Netherlands Bank registered its South African branch under the name Nederlandse Bank in Suid-Afrika (\\"Dutch Bank in South Africa\\") as an independent subsidiary in 1951, the South African government bought the property, which has remained in its hands ever since. Nedbank kept its headquarters on the ground floor until 1953, when it moved to Johannesburg. The first floor was rented out to the Zuid-Afrikaansche Fabrieken Voor Ontplofbare Stoffen (\\"South African Factory for Explosive Substances\\"). = University = From 1975 to 1977, the building was used as a headquarters for the Department of Architecture at the University of Pretoria. The University has also used the building as a temporary exhibition space, making it a key destination for connoisseurs of architecture. Therefore, State President of South Africa Marais Viljoen declared the western edge of Church Square a national monument. The entrance of the Old Netherlands Bank building in Pretoria has tulip motifs in the Jugendstil style. In 1993, a commemorative plate was revealed bearing the names of 64 schools in Pretoria that advocated for the national monument designation.  Current use  The Tshwane Tourist Information Centre began offering the building as a local office in 2000 for the Vereniging voor Vreemdelingenverkeer. The Centre rents the building from the provincial government of Gauteng. The offices on the first floor served as the new Local Economic Development en Business Library.  Architecture  The facade of the building is sandstone, while the sides are red brick. The joints are rounded with occasional cut joints for accent, common in the Dutch Renaissance style. The fencing and interiors are rendered in Art Nouveau. Including a cast-iron railing with tulip accents, such fencing was made by Braat.

Production Although best known for his erotic fumetto comic series Isabella, director and screenwriter Giorgio Cavedon had worked in the film industry making a documentary in 1953 and having some credits in the early 1960s films including directing part of the Italian comedy anthology film I soldi. Cavedon began work on Ombre on July 9, 1979. It was filmed on location in Milan and at Icet-De Paolis Studios in Milan.

The album was produced by Mike Shipley. The album's lead single, \\"How Did I Get By Without You\\" peaked at No. 89 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and remained on the chart for eight weeks. It also reached No. 20 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" was also issued as a promotional single. Background After the release of his fourth studio album, Rover's Return, in 1987, Waite joined the supergroup Bad English. When Waite left the group in 1991, he took some time away from the music business before returning to his solo career. He told The Record in 1995: \\"Being in Bad English was too much of a compromise. Instead of being true to the artistic side, there was this incredible pressure to keep producing the same kind of hits.\\" Waite's return to his solo career was based on his \\"pure love of the music\\", with the material on Temple Bar inspired by Waite's recent divorce: \\"I wanted to describe my life to me and to tell the truth\\". When Waite was offered a contract with Terry Ellis' new label Imago, Waite agreed on the condition that the album he made \\"wouldn't be a rock record\\". Speaking of the period on his official website, Waite recalled: \\"Terry Ellis gave me generous deal and I was able to move back into the city for several months to record. It's the only time I've ever had the head of a company tell me to make the record I wanted to make. I did. Temple Bar was the best I'd done to that point.\\" Reception Upon release, Stephanie Riefe of the Hartford Courant described the album as an \\"accessible, easy listen\\" and wrote: \\"Temple Bar is full of trademark Waite touches: great turns of phrase and truckloads of sentimentality. The surprise is that it's good. The music is pleasing, and the lyrics aren't so fluffy that they float off the page.\\" Brian S. Maloney of the Santa Cruz Sentinel considered the album to be \\"much more promising\\" than the material produced by Bad English.

It was recorded live in France in Limoges and Poitiers in October 1978, and in Reims in 1981. The album was released on LP by AAA in 1983, and on CD by AYAA in 1991. The CD release includes an extra track recorded via correspondence in 1991‚Äì92 by Coxhill in London and Frith in Munich. Background Fred Frith began playing with Lol Coxhill in the early 1970s, which introduced Frith to the London improvised music scene. Coxhill went on to perform as a guest with Henry Cow, a group Frith was a member of at the time, on several occasions between 1972 and 1977. In 1974 Frith also played with Coxhill in Welfare State, a British performance art group. Bill Smith and Dan Lander stated in their book Music Is Rapid Transportation that Coxhill's improvisation technique had a \\"lasting impact\\" on Frith. In October 1978, shortly after Henry Cow split up in August that year, Frith and Coxhill undertook a short tour in France, playing in Limoges and Poitiers. Several years later in 1981, they participated in an unscheduled performance at a concert in Reims. The material on French Gigs was taken from the 1978 tour and the 1981 concert. Reception In a review of the LP release of French Gigs at AllMusic, Eugene Chadbourne compared the tone of Coxhill's soprano saxophone to that of Sidney Bechet, but added that Coxhill often explores contexts beyond that of traditional jazz. Chadbourne said Frith's tabletop guitars add \\"a magnificent sort of orchestral accompaniment\\" to Coxhill, and praised Frith's production for avoiding the trap of reducing the collection to \\"meaningless highlights\\". Chadbourne looked forward to a CD release of the album where he hoped that additional material would be added. Reviewing the album in The Wire, Richard Scott said Coxhill and Frith cover a wide range of musical styles, making generic categorisation impossible. He described the recording as \\"sometimes expansive, beautiful, lush, sometimes dry, scratchy and obscure\\". He said the duo \\"pace around each other, provide contexts for each other, listen and respond in ways that rarely amount to any particular style or approach.\\" Coxhill's saxophone at times sounds like bagpipes, and Frith's guitar like an orchestra, and \\"[a]s such there is not a lot to go on, and no particular reason why it should work as well as it does\\". Scott concluded: \\"It's great: one of the few recordings of improvisation that continues to beguile and seduce after several listens.\\" Track listing All tracks composed by Lol Coxhill and Fred Frith. =LP release= Sources: Liner notes, Discogs. =CD release= Sources: Liner notes, Discogs.

It is the third title to be created and released by Exact for the X68000 platform late into its commercial life span, which was a few months before being discontinued in the same year by Sharp Corporation. Taking place in the fantasy world of Fail Land, the players take control of young princess Rilule on a journey to rescue the kidnapped female magicians of her country as well as a young man named Sol from their captivity by a dark witch and her demonic followers, who have invaded and terrorized upon the inhabitants of the floating land masses, in order to save her kingdom from peril. Its gameplay mainly consists of action RPG combining exploration, platforming and shoot 'em up elements, with a main two-button configuration. Despite its late release on the computer, √âtoile Princesse proved to be one of the most popular titles from Exact among the X68000 userbase with its colorful graphics, sound design and gameplay that would eventually lead it to being nominated for a \\"Game of the Year\\" award by Japanese magazine Oh!X, before ultimately losing against other titles on the system. After its release, Exact would go on to develop their fourth and last title for the X68000; Geograph Seal, which was released a year later to equally positive critical and audience response.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. √âtoile Princesse is primarily an action role-playing game with adventure, platform, puzzle and run and gun elements that is played in a top- down perspective reminiscent of KiKi KaiKai, Twinkle Tale and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, where the players initially take control of the main protagonist Rilule across various stages of varying thematic set in the world of Fail Land where the main objectives are to rescue each of the multiple playable characters that have both their own main weapon and special ability, free Sol from his imprisonment as well as defeating the dark witch, the main antagonist, and her legion of monsters in order to ultimately restore peace to the country.√âtoile Princesse („Ç®„Éà„ÉØ„Éº„É´„Éó„É™„É≥„Çª„Çπ) „É¶„Éº„Ç∂„Éº„Éû„Éã„É•„Ç¢„É´ (X68000, JP) Most of the levels featured in the game, although linear in nature, are large and populated with obstacles and enemies which involve the players on traversing them by jumping, running and solving puzzles while shooting and dodging enemies that roam around the playfield. The stages also feature multiple buildings and routes to explore, encouraging the player with exploring them in order to find items hidden in treasure chests such as fruit and leaf that restores health and magic respectively, keys, among other beneficial items, while players can also collect other useful items that are randomly dropped by enemies after defeating them. Rilule and the other playable characters can shoot projectiles and unleash powerful magic spells representative of their ability against enemies and one of the dark witch's creations that act as a boss at the end of the each stage, which must be fought in order to progress further through the game, which is mostly linear as well compared with the stages. After defeating a boss, one of the captured playable characters is rescued and recruited to the party, which up to three can be taken alongside before starting any stage but only one can be used during gameplay, while every character on the currently selected party members shares the same HP and MP meters between each other. Controlling the characters is done with a directional pad, which moves the player character in eight directions, as well as both an attack and a jump button. Charging a powerful magic spell attack is done by holding the attack button down that depletes MPs. Pressing either both action buttons or the shift key on a keyboard allows access to the inventory screen to choose a character or item. Once a stage is completed, players can save or load their current progress as well as return to the title screen before entering any stage. If the HP meter is completely depleted by enemy attacks, the game is over. Prior to starting a playthrough, players have access to the options menu at the title screen of the game, where various settings can be adjusted.  Synopsis  √âtoile Princesse takes place in the fantasy world of Fail Land, a set of floating land masses above the skies where a self-centered and careless young princess named Rilule, who is capable of controlling the power of the stars, resides peacefully in the room of her castle alongside her elder mentor, who enters and warns Rilule about demons that have suddenly appeared all over the country and began terrorizing its inhabitants, as well as sealing female magicians like her in order to minimize powerful opposition against them but believing is not an important matter, she does not care at first until her mentor shows a poster indicating that a young man named Sol was kidnapped by a dark witch, who is responsible for the occurring monster rebellion changes her thought, prompting Rilule to save her people and the kingdom from impending peril.  Development and release  √âtoile Princesse was the third title to be developed and published by Exact for the Sharp X68000 and it was in development since 1992, with plans to be released on November 27 of the same year and early previews of the game showcasing both a different GUI design during gameplay and character selection screen as well, which were redesigned before its eventual launch in Japan on March 26, 1993, late into the commercial life span of the computer and before being discontinued in the same year by Sharp Corporation with a retail price of JP¬•9,800. The game is compatible with multiple X68000 machines, including the X68030 and features support with multiple Roland MIDI sound modules.  Reception  √âtoile Princesse was positively received from audience and critics alike since its release. Nishikawa Zenji from Oh!X magazine praised multiple aspects such as the graphics, sound design and gameplay. Although it was released late during the commercial life span of the platform, the game proved to be a popular one among the X68000 userbase in Japan, which would eventually led it in being nominated for a \\"Game of the Year\\" award from Oh!X magazine but lost against other titles such as Akumaj≈ç Dracula and Street Fighter II‚Ä≤.

Suggested common name for this species are the pygmy clingfish and the seagrass clingfish. Description Opeatogenys gracilis has a short snout which is depressed and triangular in shape. Its general shape is rather similar to that of the two-spotted clingfish (Diplecogaster bimaculata). The dorsal and anal fins are relatively small and situated close to the caudal fin. The pectoral fins are modified to form the suction disc, a characteristic of clingfishes. The colour can be greenish or orange with light blue spots and there is a white line along the back. The maximum total length is . Distribution Opeatogenys gracilis occurs only in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from the coasts of the Algarve eastwards to the Levant. Until specimens were collected off southern Portugal, it had been considered to be endemic to the Mediterranean. Within the Mediterranean, O. gracilis has been recorded off the coast of Malaga, Spain, Algeria, Cyprus, France, Sicily and off Sfax in Tunisia. Habitat and biology Opeatogenys gracilis is found on the leaves of seagrasses such as Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa and on the fronds of algae, attaching to the leaves or fronds with the sucking disc formed by the modified pectoral fins. It is thought that this small fish only lives for a few years. Adults feed on small invertebrates which also live on the leaves of seagrass. The pelagic larval stage of this species lasts for an mean of 14.6 days. Off Sicily, the preferred prey was found to be copepods of the order Harpacticoida. Taxonomy and etymology Opeatogenys gracilis is a clingfish and is placed in the family Gobiesocidae. It was originally described as Mirbelia gracilis by Giovanni Canestrini from a type locality given as the Mediterranean Sea. In 1955, John Carmon Briggs placed it in the monotypic genus Opeatogenys. In 1957, Briggs described a second species of Opeatogenys, O. cadenati, from the coasts of western Africa. The generic name is derived from the Greek opeatos which means an \\"awl\\" and genys which means \\"cheek\\", while the specific name gracilis means \\"slender\\".

Part of the Black Christmas series, it is the loose second remake of the 1974 Canadian film Black Christmas, after the 2006 film, and follows a group of sorority sisters at Hawthorne College as they are preyed upon by an unknown stalker. The film stars Imogen Poots, Aleyse Shannon, Lily Donoghue, Brittany O'Grady, Caleb Eberhardt, and Cary Elwes. Development of the project began in June 2019, when Jason Blum announced that he would produce the film through his studio Blumhouse Productions. On the same day, Sophia Takal was announced as director and co- writer, and principal photography began soon after, lasting for 27 days in New Zealand. Black Christmas was released in North American theaters on December 13, 2019 by Universal Pictures, coinciding with Friday the 13th. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $18 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. Plot While walking home, Hawthorne College student Lindsey is impaled with an icicle by a trio of masked figures. The rest of Hawthorne College is preparing for the Christmas holiday break. Riley Stone, a student at the College's Mu Kappa Epsilon (ŒúŒöŒï) sorority, is still struggling to move on from being raped by Delta Kappa Omicron (DKO) fraternity president Brian Huntley (which no one besides her close friends believed her about despite Brian being forced to leave). Her sorority sisters Kris, Marty, Jesse, and Helena are taking part in the DKO talent show with a dance choreographed by Riley. Riley gives Helena her lucky comb. Meanwhile, Kris has drawn the ire of the DKO fraternity and Riley and Marty's lecturer Professor Gelson following a petition from her requesting that university founder and notorious misogynist Calvin Hawthorne's bust be moved away from the main building and another requesting Gelson be fired due to his refusal to teach books written by women. While at her job at a coffee shop, Riley learns that Brian will be back in town to oversee the talent show. She also meets Landon, a friendly boy from the DKO fraternity who takes a liking to her. The group arrives at the DKO fraternity where Riley catches a glimpse of a strange ritual involving new pledges for DKO and a black goo leaking out of the Calvin Hawthorne bust. She also stumbles across Helena about to be sexually assaulted by one of the frat boys. Riley intervenes and sends a tipsy Helena home. Riley takes Helena's place in the talent show and upon seeing Brian in the crowd, performs a song with her sorority sisters blasting the rape culture at the fraternity and stating that Brian did rape Riley. The girls leave in high spirits and Riley bonds with Landon. Meanwhile, back at the MKE house, Helena is abducted by Lindsey's attacker. The next day the girls start to receive threatening DMs from a Calvin Hawthorne account similar to what Lindsey had received before she was murdered. Meanwhile, sorority sister Fran is also killed by the masked man. Concerned that Helena has seemingly not gone home to her parents as planned, Riley alerts campus security who are apathetic and assume Helena has run off with a boyfriend. After a strange encounter with Gelson outside the DKO fraternity, where she finds a list of the MKE girls among some papers he dropped, Riley returns home. Marty and her boyfriend Nate have an argument and she kicks him out of the house that night while Riley and Kris argue over Kris' uploading the talent show video online and Riley now fears retaliation from members of the fraternity. Jesse goes to the attic to get some Christmas lights and is murdered, her body left in the attic. Riley, Kris, and Marty receive more threatening messages before being attacked by a bow-wielding assailant who injures Marty. The girls lock themselves in a room and Riley ventures out to retrieve her phone. Meanwhile, Kris goes to the attic to warn Jesse and discovers her body. Nate arrives back at the house looking to apologize and is promptly murdered. Riley then uses Nate's car keys to kill the masked man. She reunites with Kris and Marty and they are attacked by two other masked men. Marty is gravely wounded but manages to buy Riley and Kris enough time to hide in the kitchen before dying. The pair overpower and kill the attacker. They remove his mask after being alarmed that they are covered in black goo instead of blood. Riley identifies him as an DKO pledge she saw at the ritual and is alarmed by a strange look in the pledge's eyes. The pair escape the house in Nate's car and Riley theorizes that Hawthorne, who was known for dabbling in black magic, is responsible for the killings via his bust and the black goo it emitted. Kris shoots down the idea and suggests they go to the police but Riley demands they go to the DKO fraternity to fight. They argue and Riley heads off to confront the frat herself. She encounters Landon and enlists him to help her enter the fraternity. Meanwhile, Kris stumbles across Lindsey's sorority, which had angered DKO for not wanting to take part in the talent show. She discovers Lindsey's sorority sisters are also being attacked by other DKO pledges and manages to rescue them. At the DKO house, Riley and Landon break in, but Landon is cornered by the frat brothers who convince him to be a pledge. Riley witnesses the Hawthrone bust leak the black goo before discovering Helena, who is tied up but still alive. Attempting to rescue Helena, Riley unties the bonds securing Helena's hands behind her back but is suddenly knocked unconscious by an DKO member. Riley awakens to find herself sitting tied up on a chair. She is confronted by Gelson, Brian, and the DKO frat boys who have inducted Landon as a pledge. Gelson explained that after Kris forced the bust's relocation to the fraternity they discovered Hawthorne's plan, involving a spell and the black goo, to keep unruly women in check. The goo allows the spirit of Hawthorne to possess the fraternity's pledges and send them out to murder any women that stepped out of line. It is also revealed that Helena has been secretly working with the fraternity and stole several items from her sisters that allowed the possessed pledges to easily locate their targets. One of the pledges murders Helena despite her willingness to be a \\"good woman\\" to the frat as a show of power to Riley. Brian forces Riley to bow to him, but she plans to attack him; at the same moment Kris and Lindsey's surviving sorority sisters enter and fight the fraternity. Riley overpowers and kills Brian. She then smashes the Hawthorne bust. Kris sets Gelson on fire and the women and Landon escape, locking the frat brothers inside and leaving them to burn to death. As the traumatized group watch the frat house burn, Riley watches with newfound bravery. In a mid-credit scene, the cat that was the MKE sisters' pet is seen licking the black liquid.

In addition, Greg Gilreath and Zac Locke, also from Divide/Conquer, served as executive producers for the project. Also, in June, Sophia Takal was announced as the film's director, having previously worked with Blum on his Into the Dark series for Hulu, while Imogen Poots, Aleyse Shannon, Brittany O'Grady, Lily Donoghue, and Caleb Eberhardt were cast in the starring roles. Also that month, Cary Elwes was added to the cast. Director Takal worked extensively to make this vision of Black Christmas as feminist as she could, stating in an interview, \\"I wanted to make a movie where instead of feeling objectified or watched from a distance, the audience felt seen.\\" It is the first Black Christmas film in which Bob Clark was not involved in the production process, as Clark had died in 2007. Bob Clark had produced and directed the original Black Christmas (1974), and had been an executive producer on the 2006 remake of the same name. Unlike the previous two version of Black Christmas, the remake was rated PG-13 by the MPAA, a rating Takal sought in hopes of making it accessible to new audiences, especially young women who were interested in horror, and opening up discussions on major issues like sexual assault, although she was ready to fully commit to utilizing the higher R rating if the ratings board would not grant it. However, she would not use the PG-13 rating to water down the film's violence to a large degree, making it only slightly less violent than the original film. Production began in New Zealand on June 23, 2019. Principal photography occurred for 27 days around Dunedin and Oamaru, with the University of Otago providing the setting. Filming concluded on July 31, 2019. Release In the United States and Canada, Black Christmas was released on December 13, 2019, coinciding with Friday the 13th. Reception =Box office= Black Christmas grossed $10.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $8.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $18.5 million. In the United States, the film was released alongside Jumanji: The Next Level, and Richard Jewell, and was initially projected to gross $10‚Äì12 million from 2,100 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after making $1.4 million on its first day (including $230,000 from Thursday night previews), estimates for the film were lowered to $4.5 million. It ended up debuting to just $4.2 million, finishing fifth at the box office. The film fell 57% to $1.8 million in its second weekend, finishing in tenth. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 38% based on 104 reviews, with an average rating of 4.37/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Better than the 2006 remake yet not as sharp as the original, this Black Christmas stabs at timely feminist themes but mostly hits on familiar pulp.\\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 49 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"D+\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an \\"awful\\" average 1.5 out of 5 stars, with 38% saying they would definitely recommend it.

He is the founder and director of Operation Black Vote and the Advisory Chair of the Government of the United Kingdom Race Disparity Unit. He has been a crossbench member of the House of Lords since October 2019.  Early life and education  Woolley was born in Leicester on 24 December 1961, and was raised by his adoptive parents Phillis and Dan Fox. He grew up on the St Matthew's estate which he described as, \\"a working-class council estate but it was a hard-working council estate. You never felt that you were short of anything.\\" Woolley's adoptive parents fostered a number of other children during his childhood, Dan Fox died when Woolley was fourteen years old. Woolley left school without A-Levels and started his working life in an apprenticeship as a car mechanic. He moved to London at the age of nineteen and spent four years in advertising for The Rank Organisation in Wardour Street, before deciding to study Spanish and Politics at Middlesex University. During his studies, Woolley spent time in Costa Rica and Colombia, he went on to earn a Master of Arts in Hispanic literature at Queen Mary University of London.  Career  Woolley become engaged with British politics, joining the campaign group Charter 88. He started to research the potential impact of a black vote, which Woolley argued could influence electoral outcomes in marginal seats. These findings encouraged Woolley to launch Operation Black Vote in 1996. Operation Black Vote has launched voter registration campaigns, an app to inspire and inform black and minority ethnic (BME) individuals and worked with Saatchi & Saatchi on a pro bono advertising campaign. Woolley also worked to empower communities and to integrate better politics education into the school curriculum. The Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation estimated that Woolley's efforts encouraged millions of people to vote. Much of his work has been around nurturing BME civic and politic talent: the then Home Secretary Theresa May said in a speech in Westminster in 2016, \\"Today we celebrate a record number of BME MPs in parliament - 41. British politics and British society greatly benefits when we can utilise diversity‚Äôs teaming talent pool. That‚Äôs why today we are announcing that in the months ahead we will begin a new MP and business shadowing scheme\\". Woolley served as a Commissioner for the Equality and Human Rights Commission. In 2008, the Government Equalities Office released Woolley's report How to achieve better BME political representation. He was appointed to the Equalities Commission in 2009. He has launched two governmental investigations, including REACH, which looked to tackle the alienation of black youth, as well as working with Harriet Harman on the political representation of black and minority ethnic women. He worked with Bernie Grant, Al Sharpton, Naomi Campbell and Jesse Jackson on grassroots campaigns highlighting racial discrimination. In 2017 Operation Black Vote, the Guardian newspaper and Green Park Ltd launched the Colour of Power, to date the most in-depth look at the racial make-up of Britain's top jobs across 28 sectors that dominate British society. The results were reported in The Guardian: \\"Barely 3% of Britain‚Äôs most powerful and influential people are from black and minority ethnic groups, according to a broad new analysis that highlights startling inequality despite decades of legislation to address discrimination\\". He has called for local councillors to become more diverse, after it emerged that of the 200 councillors in South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset and North Somerset, no one was from a black or minority ethnic background. In May 2019, Woolley and Operation Black Vote launched a ground-breaking report into more than 130 key local authorities that emphasised the lack of BME representation. In over one third of those local authorities, many with sizeable BME populations, they either had no or just one BME councillor. Along with former Downing Street advisors Nick Timothy and Will Tanner, Woolley is seen as the inspiration and one of the architects for the Government of the United Kingdom Race Disparity Unit, and served as the Advisory Chair. He has worked with the Open Source Foundation on their global drugs policy projects. He secured ¬£90 million of funding to encourage disadvantaged young people to work. When Operation Black Vote started, there were four black or minority ethnic members of parliament; as of 2019, there are over 50. He has written for The Guardian, Huffington Post and The Independent. = Awards and honours = Woolley has been included in the Powerlist every year since 2012. He was selected as one of the Evening Standard's Most Influential People in 2010. In 2010 and 2011 he was selected as one of The Daily Telegraph's 100 Most Influential People. In 2012 he was awarded an honorary doctorate for his equality efforts from the University of Westminster. Woolley received a Knighthood in the 2019 Birthday Honours for his services to race equality. He said he had to think hard about accepting the honour: \\"Many black or minority ethnic individuals have to think hard about whether to take an award or not, particularly those offered an award with empire in its title ... It's a difficult choice and whatever decision they make I fully support them. In the case of the knighthood, I didn't have to make that exact call. It has more to do with medieval times and the 13th century than empire\\". Woolley was nominated for a life peerage to sit as a Crossbencher in the House of Lords by Prime Minister Theresa May in her 2019 Resignation Honours List. He was created Baron Woolley of Woodford in the London Borough of Redbridge, on 14 October 2019..

Maud West (born Edith Maria Barber; 15 September 1880 - 13 March 1964) was an English detective. Early life and family West was born in Deptford on 15 September 1880, the illegitimate daughter of Mary Anne Barber. Career West worked as a draper's assistant before founding her detective agency in London in 1905, her office was in Albion House on New Oxford Street. Much of West's work was connected with divorce, missing persons and blackmail cases but she was an accomplished self-publicist and had risen to prominence as 'London's Lady detective' by the 1920s. In an edition of The Sphere in 1926, West was featured in Sketches of People in the Public Eye alongside the composer Richard Strauss, the performer Little Tich and inventor Richard H Granger. The feature said of West: ‚Äúon several occasions she has found herself confronted with a revolver in the hand of a desperate man, and only pluck and a sense of humour has saved her life.‚Äù West wrote about her adventures in Pearson‚Äôs Weekly and regional and tabloid newspapers; although much sensationalised and of dubious accuracy, her stories included entertaining tales of how she'd unwittingly been hired by German intelligence during WWI and travelled to South Africa to bring a 'dope fiend' back to England. West prided herself on her use of disguise and promoted her work by distributing photographs of herself in various guises. In 1926, West claimed that she had been invited to a seance to shoot a revolver at a spirit in order to test whether the apparition was real or not, she stated, ‚ÄúThis experience will be the most remarkable in the whole of my career, and there can be few women who have packed more excitement and adventure into their lives.‚Äù In 1932, West was involved in the high-profile divorce case of Lord Inverclyde whose solicitors instructed West's detective agency to conduct surveillance of his second wife, June Tripp. West was a councillor for the Municipal Reform Party from 1934 - 1937 in Central St Giles ward, London. In 1939, West closed her detective agency and retired.  Personal life  West married Harry Elliott in May 1901 and the couple had six children together. Elliott sometimes worked for his wife's detective agency and died in 1950. Death and legacy West died on 13 March 1964.

Biography  In the year AD 1355 (Magh, Shukla Paksha Dwitya , Vikram Samvat 1412), Shri Bawa Lal ji incarnated in the village of ‚ÄòKasur‚Äô near Lahore, Punjab. His father was Shri Bohlamal Ji and mother was Krishna Devi Ji. He left his home at the age of 8 in search of his Guru Chetan Swami and went to Lahore. From Lahore he went to Behra, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Riyas, Rajouri, Kashmir, Mansarovar (Kailash Parvat) and then moved towards Badrinath and Kedarnath. Eventually, he reached Punjab. On reaching Lahore, near Shahdra at the bank of river Ravi he had darshan of his Guru Chetan Swami. Baba Lal Dayal Ji is mentioned in famous historical works including Samudra Sangama, ·∏§asanƒÅt al- ‚ÄòƒÄrifƒ´n, Majma ª al-Bahrayn, DabistƒÅn-i MadhƒÅhib and Mathnawi-i KajkulƒÅh. 'McGill University PhD Thesis'  Temples  = Main Temple: Lal Dwara Dhianpur = Shri Dhianpur Dham is the most sacred holy place for pilgrimage among the followers of Shri Bawa Lal Sampradaya. Dhianpur is a village in Gurdaspur district in the Indian state of Punjab. Located about 20 km from Batala city, it is well known for the ashram of Baba Lal Dayal, a fourteenth century Hindu religious saint of the Punjab.[1] The 2001 census of India recorded Dhianpur as having a population of 3,095 forming 510 households.[2] In A.D. 1495, Shri Bawa Lal ji arrived at this place with Shri Dhiandasji, Shri Gurumukh Lal ji and Shri Kashi Ram ji and was so impressed with the beauty and calm atmosphere that he gave it the name ‚ÄòDhianpur‚Äô after the name of his disciple Dhiandas. Shri Dhianpur Dham temple complex which is situated on a hillock has the sacred Samadhi of Supreme Lord Shri Bawa Lal Ji and Shri Gurumukh Lal Ji, the first successor of Lord Shri Bawa Lal Ji, Vyas Gaddi and Ram Mandir. Shri Dhianpur Dham is visited by hundreds of thousands of people from throughout the world. Ludhiana city has also temple of Shri baba Lal dyal ji situated at new shivaji nagar, ludhiana since 1970  Notable Interactions with Prince Dara Shikoh  Prince Dara Shikoh, elder son of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, was depressed and did not have the courage to face his father Shah Jahan due to the defeat in Khandhar battle in A.D. 1653. He started residing in Lahore. Looking at his depressed state Shah Jahan‚Äôs Mirmunshi Chandra Bhan Brahman advised Dara Shikoh to meet Shri Bawa Lal ji. On hearing his praise, he was influenced and wanted to have darshan of Shri Bawa Lal ji. He held a series of interviews, in the form of dialogue with Shri Bawa Lal ji and discussed with him about the life of the ascetics, relationship between the guru and the devotees, the circles of life and death, idol worship, path of spiritual salvation and various other topics. DƒÅrƒÅ held discussions with LƒÅl DƒÅs in Lahore during the period 1652 C.E. to 1653 C.E. Dara held LƒÅl DƒÅs in the highest regard as evidenced by the introduction and praise. He introduces LƒÅl DƒÅs with the following words in his ·∏§asanƒÅt al-‚ÄòƒÄrifƒ´n267:[DƒÅrƒÅ, HasanƒÅt, 49.] \\"BƒÅbƒÅ LƒÅl Mundiyya, who is amongst the perfect Gnostics ‚Äì I have seen none among the Hindus who has reached such ‚ÄòirfƒÅn and spiritual strength as he has.\\" Three Aphorisms --- He also quotes three aphorisms that he heard directly from LƒÅl DƒÅs. * In the first, LƒÅl DƒÅs is quoted as having said ‚Äúdo not become a Shaykh, or a walƒ´, or a miracle worker; rather, become a sincere faqƒ´r (faqƒ´r-i bƒ´sƒÅkhtagƒ´).‚Äù[Ibid. 55.] * In the second aphorism, LƒÅl DƒÅs tells DƒÅrƒÅ that ‚Äúin every community there is a perfect Gnostic, so that God shall grant salvation to that particular community through him. Therefore, you should not condemn any community.‚Äù[Ibid. 49.] * In the third and last aphorism, LƒÅl DƒÅs, on the authority of Kabƒ´r, describes four types of guide: The first type is like gold, for they cannot make others similar to themselves; the second type is like an elixir -- whoever reaches them becomes gold, but they cannot transform others; the third type is like the sandalwood tree, which has the ability to create another sandalwood tree if that tree is prepared for it, but not otherwise; the fourth type is like a lamp, and he is the one known as the ‚Äúperfect guide,‚Äù indeed from one lamp a hundred thousand lamps are illuminated.[272 HasanƒÅt, 54.]‚Üê  Ram Sundar Das Ji  On November 1, 2001 Shri Ram Sundar Das ji was enthroned as the Acharya of Shri Dhianpur Dham. Shri Ram Sundar Das Ji is the 15th Vaishnavacharya of Shri Dhianpur Dham and the present divine successor of Shri Bawa Lal ji.

These were the third all-Cardiff elections since the creation of the county borough. The previous elections were in November 1890 and the next elections were in November 1892 The result of the election saw no overall change in composition of the council. Background Cardiff had become a county borough in April 1889. In July 1890 the town's ward boundaries were redrawn, increasing the number of electoral wards from five to ten. On 25 July the General Purposes Committee of the council had redistributed the existing councillors over the ten wards. Not all council seats were included in each contest, because the three councillors in each ward stood down for election in three-yearly rotation. Elections normally took place on 1 November each year. Because 1 November 1891 fell on a Sunday, the 1891 elections took place on 2 November. The council consisted of 30 councillors who were elected by the town's voters and ten aldermen who were elected by the councillors. Ten seats were up for election in November 1891. Overview of the result Contests took place in seven of the ten electoral wards, namely Canton, Cathays, Central, Grangetown, Riverside, Roath and South. In three wards - Adamsdown, Park and Splott - the (Liberal) councillors were elected unopposed. Prior to the election, three of the seven contested seats were held by the Liberal Party and four by the Conservatives. This remained the case after the results were announced. In comparison with 1890, the Liberals had an overall increase in votes of 299, in comparison with 127 for the Conservatives. The Conservatives concentrated their campaigning in the Central and South wards, though in the South ward the retiring Conservative councillor only won by one vote. =Council composition= Following these elections, the council's Liberal majority remained, with 26 Liberal members, 13 Conservatives and one Liberal Unionist.

In 1957, Manchete magazine described the construction of the station as follows: \\"(‚Ä¶) With [passenger] traffic increasing day by day, especially after the start of the railway services from the docks, and to avoid future complications with the lateral avenues of the new Mangue Canal, opened by the Comiss√£o Construtora do Cais do Porto (Docklands Construction Commission), the director Francisco de Paiva Ramos, on 25th May 1903, suggested elevating the line between S√£o Crist√≥v√£o and S√£o Diogo, removing the level crossing on the Praia Formosa, Figueira de Melo and S√£o Crist√≥v√£o Roads. The idea was approved, and the project was executed by the Se√ß√£o T√©cnica da Linha (Technical Section of the Line), under the leadership of the engineer Carlos Euler, helped by his colleague M√°rio Martins Costa. The line elevation works, which included the construction of a metallic viaduct over the canal, near Leopoldina Station, started in 1905, with Jos√© de Andrade Pinto being the chief line engineer.

In early 2019, it was revealed that Radazz were one of five teams entered into the new Islands Conference of the 2019 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League. The teams consisted of players from across the East New Britain province, and were sponsored by Warangoi Properties. The team struggled to find their feet in the opening half of the season, losing their opening two matches against Chebu AROB FC and West Tribe FC, before picking up their first victory against Gazelle FC, winning 3‚Äì0. A draw with Greengold Liners saw them enter the halfway stage in fourth place. However, the team rebounded, securing return victories against Chebu and Tribe, before a draw with Gazelle and victory against Greengold saw them enter the final day in second place. However, having played all their matches, they could only watch as playoff rivals Chebu and West Tribe won their final day fixtures, knocking them down to third.

She has been serving as councillor and Spokesperson of Citizens Group of the City Council of Madrid.  Biography  Villac√≠s was born in Madrid in 1975 and her first studies were on La Salle de San Rafael charter school. She lived in Virginia, U.S. between 1992 and 1995. She obtained her degree on law in 2000 by CEU San Pablo University and in 2002 she obtained a Master in Tax Advice and Tax Law by the Comillas Pontifical University. According to her, she decided to be a lawyer while watching the movie 12 Angry Men of Sidney Lumet. In June 2003, she became responsible for the Tax, Labour and Commercial Law Areas at Legalitas, a law firm in Spain. As an analyst of legal issues, she regularly collaborated in well-known television shows such as Amigas y conocidas, El gato al agua, Espa√±a Directo and La ma√±ana de La 1. It was precisely at a television gathering, where she met the Citizens Party President Albert Rivera. A voter of Citizens, Villac√≠s began to collaborate with the party in September 2014, advising on local taxes, and she finally joined the party in early 2015. In February 2015 she held a meeting with far-right party Vox, where the later party offered her a position in the list for the 2015 regional election to the Assembly of Madrid but she preferred to maintain the commitment to Citizens. That same month, she ran as a pre-candidate in the Citizens' primary process to determine the party's Mayoral candidate for Madrid. She imposed over the other pre- candidate, Jaime Trabuchelli, commanding 60% of the votes. The Citizens list for the May 2015 Madrid municipal election headed by Villac√≠s obtained 7 councillors. She could not vote for herself because, at that time, she was a registered dweller in Villanueva del Pardillo. During the 2015-2019 Madrid City Council' meeting she acted as Spokesperson of her political group. She renovated her seat for the period 2019-2023 in the 26 May 2019 municipal election. Her list won 11 seats, 4 up from the 7 seats obtained in 2011. Her party and the far-right Vox endorsed the conservative candidate Mart√≠nez- Almeida in the investiture vote that took place during the opening session of the new council on 15 June 2019. As part of the investiture agreement Villac√≠s became First Deputy Mayor (and Vice-Mayor).

By the following day it was confirmed that power had been restored to most of Argentina and Uruguay, and Argentine President Mauricio Macri promised a full investigation. The blackout is believed to have been caused by an operational misbehavior from Transener, a transmission lines operator in Argentina. A 500 kV line running from Colonia El√≠a to Campana, crossing the Paran√° Guaz√∫ river, was down on undergoing maintenance to repair the tower number 412, whose base had been suffering from erosion by the river. The company made a bypass for this tasks, using a nearby overhead line, but missed to reflect that network grid change in the Automatic Generation Shutdown system (in spanish: DAG), which is designed to alert energy generators of network changes that would require a lower of energy generation. This caused, after a short circuit which lowered demand, an excess of power generation in the grid, a lack of synchronization of power plants, loss of balance, and a low frequency in the network. In about 30 seconds, a succession of automatic disconnections from the grid caused a blackout that came to affect 50 million users in the continent. Timeline At 7:07 a.m. (UTC-3) on 16 June 2019, Argentina's power grid \\"collapsed\\", according to Gustavo Lopetegui, the country's Energy Secretary. The failure occurred in the Argentine Interconnection System. In total, an estimated 48 million people lost power. The blackout affected most of Argentina (Tierra del Fuego in the country's far south was not affected) and Uruguay, along with parts of Paraguay. Although some media reported blackouts in parts of Chile and parts of southern Brazil, this claim was denied by the Chilean and Brazilian national authorities. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri called it \\"unprecedented\\". Argentine distributor of electricity Edesur announced on Twitter at 7:50 a.m. that all of Argentina and Uruguay had lost power as a result of the incident. It caused disruptions in subways and trains, but did not affect electric and non-electric airborne transport. According to Edesur, power had already been restored to some parts of Buenos Aires by 10 a.m.; Edesur reported that it might take many hours to restore power to all affected customers. By 1:30 p.m. power had been restored across 75% of Uruguay. By mid- afternoon 50,000 people had power restored in Argentina; north of R√≠o Negro, coastal cities and the metropolitan areas of Uruguay also had power restored, as confirmed via Twitter by Uruguay's government-owned power company UTE. By the evening, it was announced that power had been restored to 98% of Argentina. By 17 June, it was confirmed that power had been restored to most of Argentina and Uruguay. Argentine President Macri promised a full investigation. Citing official sources, Argentine media reported that the outage was linked to a failure in the transmission of electricity from the Yacyret√° hydroelectric dam. Impact People voting in the local elections at the Formosa Province, during the blackout. Because the distribution of drinking water was affected by the power outage, Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos, one of Argentina's biggest water companies, warned people without power to limit their use of water. The blackout had an impact on local gubernatorial elections taking place in Argentina, where the lack of power forced voters to fill out ballots in the dark, using their mobile phones as flashlights. In some regions of the country, the elections were postponed by authorities. Medical patients who were dependent upon home equipment were urged to attend local hospitals, where similar devices were still operational, as they were powered by backup generators. Investigation Investigations into the cause of the outage are being undertaken by both Edesur and the Argentine government. An independent energy expert in Argentina attributed a role in the blackout to \\"systemic operational and design errors\\" in the country's energy infrastructure. Argentine Energy Secretary Gustavo Lopetegui said it was unlikely to have been caused by a cyberattack. Preliminary reports suggested that the blackout likely originated from a fault in a 500 kV circuit from the municipality of Colonia El√≠a to Belgrano, a suburb of Buenos Aires. A second 500 kV circuit from Colonia El√≠a to Mercedes subsequently tripped under automatic action; the cause of that trip is still under investigation. A third 500 kV line from Colonia El√≠a to Nueva Campana was out of service at the time owing to construction work.  Aftermath  The Ente Nacional Regulador de la Electricidad set the fee for the wholesaler energy distributor Transener. The maximum fee would be either 10% of the annual earnings or 50% of the monthly ones; Transener earned $9,838.5 million in 2018. Distributors Edenor and Edesur turned off 38% of the service, which harmed the situation as it was required a 52% to compensate the outage. Cammesa, the institution that regulates those distributors, explained that this was an automatic process, and that this failure was a consequence of badly programmed systems. Cammesa would redirect the money of the fees to the users, who would get a tax credit as compensation. Those credits would be of a uniform amount, unrelated to the actual time each user was without energy.

It is one of the largest meat processors in the country, and also has vegetable processing and distribution. The chief executive officer is Darren Thomas. The company is vertically-integrated from a cattle feedlot near Tintinara through processing, chilling or freezing, distribution and sales of meat, seafood and vegetables. History The company was founded as T and R Pastoral by Chris Thomas and Bob Rowe in 1988. The company originally bought livestock and contracted out for meat processing. It bought the Murray Bridge abattoir in 1999 with 230 employees. It bought the Lobethal abattoir in 2003. In 2006, it also bought an abattoir in Western Australia and a defunct one in Port Pirie at which time it was the sixth-largest meat processor in Australia. The Thomas family took outright ownership in 2008. The company was renamed to Thomas Foods International in 2013. At that time, it was Australia's third- largest red meat processor and largest family-owned processor. It processed 5000 cattle and 120,000 lambs per week at four sites, including one at Wallangarra. In 2012, Thomas Foods International took up a 50% share in Holco meat storage and distribution. It was Australia's largest exporter of lamb and mutton, to over 80 countries. The company added one of Australia's largest potato processors, Mondello Farms in 2013. That business was renamed to Thomas Foods International Fresh Produce in 2014. A fire at the Murray Bridge abattoir in January 2018 destroyed the meat processing line. Over the following months, production was increased at Lobethal in the Adelaide Hills and at Tamworth in New South Wales, but production was not restarted at closed facilities in Port Pirie or Wallangarra. In June 2019, Thomas Foods International announced that rather than rebuilding at the existing site in Murray Bridge, it would build a replacement on a new site eight kilometres away.

Early life Marie Misamu comes from a family of eight children. She starts singing at the age of 11. After school, her friends gather around her to listen to her sing. She will then develop the gospel style alongside Evangelist Debaba. She participates in the album of the brother Del (Musamaliya) then with Debaba himself and she releases the album Nazhirea, Who's that girl ?. In this album, is the song \\"Reconnaissance\\" that Marie Misamu known to the public of the DRC, Congo-Brazzaville and other countries. She married at the age of 19 and gave birth to her daughter Ruth in May 1994. It is with this album, Nazhirea, Who's that girl ? Marie Misamu begins to make a name and knows the success. Her voice, her repertoire, her style, her multiform talent make her known far beyond the borders of the Congo. The historian S√©bastien Fath sees her as \\"a great pioneer of this new history of African Gospel that will one day write\\". In early 2016, she announces her retirement and her feeling of insecurity on BestAfrica Radio broadcast on B-One Tv. She dies on January 16, 2016, of a cardiac malaise. In addition to music, she was a stylist, model maker, seamstress and decorator. With her talents, she participates in a film where she is in a relationship with Felix Wazekwa. Following his death comes the DRC debate on the difference between religious (Christian) music and non-religious music (world music) because Marie Misamu rubbed shoulders with everyone, and wondered about the desirability of tributes by artists who do not practice religious music. Music career After working with brother Dieka Mbaki Claude, aka brother Debaba and participating in several concerts, Marie Misamu decided to make a solo career. Thus she released the album B√©atitudes, est-ce que ? in 2003, the album which did not have much success, probably because of its character \\"International\\". It was only in 2004, that his solo career gained momentum with the release of the album Myst√®re du Voile with songs like \\"Eh Yahweh\\" sung in collaboration with Mike Kalambay, \\"Reconnaissance\\", \\"Bilaka\\", etc. This album whose main language is Lingala was among the best albums of Christian music in 2005 in the DRC. The album was sold to other countries around the world and this allowed Marie Misamu to be promoted to the Muana Mboka event (the Muana Mboka Trophy) in 2005 in Kinshasa. In 2006, Marie Misamu went on tour out of her homeland to sing God and unite Christians around the world. Upon her return to Kinshasa, she is again promoted for the second time at the event Muana Mboka of the 4th edition. In 2008, she released the album \\"Myst√®re du Voile (Volume 2)\\" where we can find songs like: \\"Salela ngai bikamwa\\", \\"Masolo ya kati\\", \\"Associ√©\\", etc. Then, she collaborates with other Christian musicians like Charles Mombaya and continues to perform concerts in Africa and Europe. Then, she does not release an album until 2014 year when her third album Myst√®re du Voile, Volume 3: La R√©surrection, in which she sings with her daughter Ruth Misamu on the song: Resurrection. The titles having a clip taken from his last album are Saison, Reconnaissance and Nzambe ya ba defis. Finally, Marie Misamu leaves 7 solo albums on the market: Nazhirea, Who's that girl ?, Vall√©e ya Bacca, Beatitudes, est-ce que ?, Myst√®re du Voile, Myst√®re du Voile (Volume 2), Face B Elonga (100% Adoration) and Myst√®re du Voile 3: La R√©surrection except the one where she sings duet with Debaba and those where she makes collaborations.

From her birth she suffered from a rare skin disease that weakened her over time and which would cause skin tears and blistering. Her condition also forced frequent visits to the hospital and blood transfusions. Zanetta tried to put her illness behind her (offering her sufferings to God) so that she could live a normal adolescent life with her friends and in her free time collaborated with her local parish. Zanetta (since 1973) worked with the Focolare Movement that she joined after being drawn to their charism and that of its founder. Her beatification process commenced in late 2004 and she became titled as a Servant of God. The cause culminated on 23 March 2017 after Pope Francis acknowledged that she lived a life of heroic virtue and so named her as Venerable. Life Daniela Zanetta was born in Maggiora in Novara on 15 December 1962 as the eldest of three children to the middle-class and devout Carlo Zanetta (1936/7-26.6.2017) and Lucia Villa. Her brothers born after her were Fabrizio (b. 1967) and Emanuele (c. 1973) and a paternal uncle was Gino. Zanetta was born nine months following her parents' marriage though upon her birth was hospitalized once the midwife noticed a strange mark on the infant's leg. The doctors diagnosed this as a rare skin condition that had been seen in Italian infants six times in the past in which not a lot was known about it. The doctors predicted that she would not last the week and so she was baptized at once before being placed with her mother in a quarantined area because it was believed that the infant could be infectious. In her childhood she was known for having achieved good results at school and was seen as a bright student. But in her fifth grade she suffered a hand and leg paralysis and the beginning of pyorrhea that required urgent treatment and also led to some of her teeth needing to be extracted. Zanetta served as a leader in a local parish group consisting of adolescents as she was at the time and also collaborated in other parish initiatives that included visiting ill children in hospital. Her free time was spent with her friends as she tried to put her condition past her though such activities were often interrupted due to frequent medical treatment or hospital visits. Her condition did make her prone to sudden hospitalization (such as when suffering severe anemia) and sometimes blood transfusions which weakened her. Zanetta often needed doses of medication in order to regulate the disease and her eyes would redden due to the condition. In 1973 she had her first encounter with the Focolare Movement that Chiara Lubich had founded and she ended up becoming a member in the movement. Zanetta would maintain correspondence with Lubich on some occasions. Her condition allowed to appreciate the goodness of life even if there was suffering in it. This manifested when she learned about a conference of Italian doctors who were advocating for euthanasia. Zanetta opposed euthanasia (and also abortion) and wrote a response on 4 November 1984 to the local magazine Famiglia Cristiana urging people to see the goodness of all life despite its occasions of suffering. From 26 October 1983 until her death she kept a journal in which all her thoughts were written to Jesus Christ detailing her spiritual reflections. Zanetta also met Pope John Paul II in Arona in November 1984 who embraced her and she later received the Eucharist from him during the papal Mass. In 1984 she had a surgical procedure before doctors suggested that she be cared for at home since the disease was too advanced for doctors to be able to do more for her. Zanetta did not leave home much following this though did have doctors continuing to assist her at home. Doctor Cavagnino - who aided her around this stage - said that she had the \\"precise and determined will to live\\" and that she \\"was bursting with love for others\\". In her final months she often wrote articles and reflections for her parish bulletin. Her condition worsened in February 1986 and she would later predict to her mother that she would die in April and even gave her three dates (she predicted 7 and 21 in addition to 14 when she did die). Zanetta managed to inform her parents on 10 April 1986 of how best to distribute her savings to the poor despite it being a modest amount. Zanetta received the Eucharist on 13 April and said (a few times): \\"Thank you, thank you for everything\\" before she entered into a coma. Zanetta regained consciousness the following evening at 7:50pm and died smiling with her parents and brothers at her side at 10:10pm on 14 April 1986. Beatification process The beatification process opened on 28 September 2004 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause made) edict and titled Zanetta as a Servant of God. The cause opened in the Novara diocese under the then-Bishop (now cardinal) Renato Corti on 17 October 2004 in a diocesan process that lasted until 29 April 2006 collecting documentation and witness interrogatories (including from her relatives). The documentation was sent to the C.C.S. in Rome who issued a decree on 22 February 2008 validating the process (the decree was issued to highlight that the diocesan process was not inconsistent with C.C.S. rules for conducting beatification processes on the diocesan level). The postulation (the officials leading and coordinating the cause) compiled and submitted the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 2014 for evaluation. Nine theologians issued their approval to the cause in late 2016 while the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members likewise approved it some short months later. Zanetta became titled as Venerable on 23 March 2017 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged that Zanetta had practiced heroic virtue throughout her life. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Francesca Consolini.

Ray Stahl, and starring Steve Forrest, Martha Hyer, Tetsu Nakamura, Heihachir√¥ √îkawa, and Dekao Yokoo. The full film was shot in Tokyo, Japan. The plot was, in fact, created so as to educate American viewers of such Japanese traditions as a Kabuki theater presentation, a Buddhist religious ceremony, and a geisha house. Despite these features, the Japanese people were presented as stock characters or buffoons. Martha Hyer didn't play the main role in the film yet got the top billing. Plot Two American soldiers‚ÄîRocky Wilson (Steve Forrest) and Archie McGregor (Archer MacDonald)‚Äîserve in the Korea War. One day they are on the leave in Tokyo. The easygoing duo wants to visit night clubs and bars, but GIs are not allowed to enter there. Therefore, the two want to find civilian clothing to do what they want. They go to a recommended black market shop and buy new cloth. Archie discovers strange pills in the breastpocket of the suit jacket, and the sales clerck wants to cancel the deal, but they are interrupted by the military police. Rocky and Archie are trailed to a bar where Mr. Nakano (Tetsu Nakamura), who is a powerful gang leader, encounter them and invites them to visit his home, mentioning that there is a geisha school there. Rocky Wilson and Archie McGregor are accompanied by stewardess Peggy Barnes (Martha Hyer), who is actually a government spy trying to track down the mysterious pills because they are very powerful explosives, even more dangerous than an nuclear bomb. Mr. Nakano, assisted by his henchmen and some geishas, tries to get the pills from Archie but failes to do so because one geisha girl, Michiko, informs Peggy who, in turn, informs the police. The police captain forcefully invites Zoro (Dekao Yokoo), a powerful hypnotist, to get involved in the events. The gangsters keep on chasing the pills, but the conjuror-magician finally manages to subdue the villains. The two soldiers are left in the Peggy Burnes's custody.

Taxonomy  Pseudomys vandycki was described in 1990 by Henk Godthelp. The author assigned the specific epithet vandycki in honour of Stephen Van Dyke of the Queensland Museum, acknowledging his contributions to the understanding of mammalian systematics in Australia. The holotype is an incomplete jaw retaining the first and second molar, discovered at the Chinchilla Rifle Range site in 1983. The species is allied to the Mesembriomys-group, but the phylogeny and biogeographic history of Australasian murids is subject to ongoing research.  Description  Pseudomys vandycki is a medium-sized species of the genus, similar in size and dentition to the ash-grey mouse Pseudomys albocinereus found in Southwest Australia. The morphology of the first molar's crown is characteristic to the species, the first cusp is rectangular and nearly perpendicular to the second and third cusp. Contemporary species of Pseudomys are unspecialised foragers, eating a variety of plants and fungi with invertebrates often included in the diet. The rodents' success in other parts of the world is well represented in the diversity of Australian mammal fauna, however, this species and Zyzomys rackhami are the only fossils of the murid family to be discovered and described.  Distribution and habitat  The site of discovery was the Chinchilla fossil site, located in the southeast of Queensland, and the species is only known at this location. The deposit was uncovered in sandstone associated with rivers and lakes and dated to the late Pliocene epoch. Pseudomys vandycki is regarded as an \\"old endemic\\" mammal of Australia, part of an early radiation of the rodents into the continent that represented the only terrestrial placental mammals to colonise Australia during the tertiary period. The Chinchilla area was open forest in the Pliocene, with an increasingly warm and seasonally variable climate. The dominant vegetation was eucalyptus woodlands that were displaced by grassland as the climate of the region became warmer and drier.

The Old Parsonage Museum in Fraserburg is the first parsonage that the Fraserburg Reformed Church, the local congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK), built for its pastor, five years after the congregation's founding in 1851. It has for many years housed the local museum and is one of three national heritage sites in the Karoo town. Its restoration around 1979 was the largest of several projects in the region carried out around that time, including that of the Peperbus, a former Anglican church and gunpowder magazine. The building was completed at the beginning of 1856 by Henry Burnett. The plan was approved by the church council, but the Rev. Carl Arnoldus Bamberger (invested here in 1854) had a major role in the design, including metric rather than English-measured doors. During the planning of the restoration, research in the Cape Church archives and other local sources uncovered much information about the building's history.  Design  The church council rejected a plan for a gabled house - similar to those found in Prince Albert today - in favor of a more \\"modern\\" Plan using wolf ends instead. The facade includes a front door with a fanlight and four sash windows. A small entryway leads to two lobbies and a dining room with curved walls vaguely reminiscent of Baroque architecture. The kitchen, servant quarters, and stable are housed in a back wing, giving the building an L-shape. The wings were two rooms wide. At the side and back are swinging tails, each with 15 windows built in the Cape Dutch style, one that had become obsolete around 1815 in the Boland but remained in use in other regions until the end of the 19th century. Although the council opted for a modern style, the building has a medieval character in many ways. The pioneers of the veld had lived in seclusion from Europe, and thus their conservatism preserved architectural traditions that had disappeared elsewhere. Despite medieval elements, it cannot be said to be a Gothic house. In fact, the only Gothic Revival detail is the dining room fireplace decoration, probably made by the elders. The wolf ends are more reminiscent of a Dutch hallehuis (free-standing barn) of the High Middle Ages. The use of thick solder beams with broad boards is a tradition Cape houses of the 18th century brought from earlier times in Europe. The hinge work on many doors, windows, and shutters is almost identical to that in 15th-century northern Germany. The open hearth is another typical Cape throwback to old European tradition. A stable under the same roof as the living space, unheard of by then in the Boland, occurs in the Old Parsonage. The walls above the swinging tails and the side and back doors are notably unlatched. On the contrary, flat arches were mingled, a common late Gothic feature. The total absence of Neo-Classical decoration on the exterior further gives the building medieval qualities. Baroque and Neo-Classical influence can also be shown, however, in the symmetrical facade and geometric positioning of the windows vis-a-vis the front door. The curved walls of the rooms by the front door can best be explained by the Rev. Bamberger's love of the Baroque. The interior doors in the front wing have six panels each, and the frames are enclosed with wooden arches in the Neo-Classical style. Although the dining room patio door doesn't line up with the front door, the garden gate was built right opposite it. Despite the disparate influences, the house was unmistakably Cape Dutch with its thatched roof, white walls, white frame, and green shutters. By its dimensions, it could even be considered a manor.  Use and changes  Over the years, the building has been drastically altered. In 1877, a veranda was built over the front porch, and a new stable was built in the back yard. The old stable was divided into a shed and a barn, requiring the barn door to be moved a meter to the right. Since the thatched roof was becoming full of holes, architect Carl Otto Hager, who also designed the second NGK church in town, installed a corrugated iron roof in 1892. The walls were also raised by about a meter to allow ventilation holes. Some swinging tails on the back and sides were replaced with large sash windows. A flat-roofed study was built to the right of the main structure in 1895. The porch veranda was renovated in 1948, and in the 1950s, large steel windows were installed in the old shed to make it a sunroom. Collectively, the changes made the house unrecognizable from what it was a century earlier. The house underwent less changes on the interior. The ceiling beams in the front wing were nailed with small boards in 1911. The kitchen hearth was removed and one of the rooms was set up as a bathroom with a cement floor. The Old Parsonage was often threatened with demolition. When a new parsonage was planned in 1959, many wanted it built on the old one's grounds. After the new parsonage opened elsewhere, the church council indeed decided to tear down the old building, but there were fortunately willing tenants.  Restoration  In 1974, planning began for the \\"restoration\\" of the Old Parsonage. This would entail, among other things, the outfitting of several rooms with yellow wood floors, the replacement of several windows with ones of different dimensions, and the building of a Cape Dutch arbor over the front porch. The building's rescue from such alteration was only secured in November 1974, when the Museum Committee secured permission of other local organizations (since 1978, a Museum Union has taken the place of the committee). The committee was able to stop the ill-advised \\"restoration plan\\" of the church council and began building a town museum. For four years, the committee struggled to raise money, obtain exhibits, and secure recognition from the provincial government. Unable to gain such recognition, they decided at the end of 1978 to begin construction and get recognition afterwards. A renowned Cape Town architect raised in Fraserburg kindly drew up a blueprint. Since the Museum Union's funds were scanty, at first only urgent needs could be addressed. Later additions were removed by the local Rotary Club, plaster was replaced on the exterior and in three rooms, swinging tails in the old style replaced the steel windows, the kitchen hearth was rebuilt, square-cut stone was restored to the porch, and the garden gate was rebuilt according to the residents' memories. The work began in April 1979. There was just enough money to pay for the above work, and instead of donating money, well-wishers were asked to donate building materials. Luckily, a Cape Couloured builder with much knowledge of old construction methods and materials strove to make all the new work authentic. Without his expertise, the kitchen hearth would have been impossible to restore. Shortly after work began, the municipal government invested R5,000. With that, the roof could be replaced. To save money, a pair of farmers volunteered to truck in beams from Great Brak River and thatch from Stilbaai. Over four weeks, a great many volunteers under the direction of the pastor, Dr. Adelbert Scholtz (a member of the Simon van der Stel Foundation and chairman of the Museum Union), worked together to dismantle the corrugated iron roof and restore the thatch. The dimensions of the old wolf ends were very carefully measured. Afterwards, a Monsignor Afrika van Elim finished the deck work in two weeks. Thus the building was restored to its original appearance. Before the work began, there were several criticisms of the Museum Union plan. After completion, almost all the community approved, since after all most of them were involved in one way or another. Many museum pieces were donated. Along with the existing collection, they created a comprehensive overview of the pastoralist's life, past and present. The National Monuments Council (South Africa and Namibia) took it upon themselves to designate the Old Parsonage as a heritage site. After the Museum Union finances reached suitable levels, the following projects were undertaken: the replacement of a pair of 1892 windows with older types, the removal of the ceiling boards from 1911, the commissioning of 1857-era wallpaper, and the reconstruction of the backyard stable from 1877. A mule still had to be housed somewhere, and a kliprondawel (corbel hut - a kind of building unique to the region) needed planning, but only the latter was eventually built.

His siblings include former Secretary of Health Alberto Romualdez Jr. and footballer Johnny Romualdez. He is also the nephew of former House Speaker Daniel Z. Romualdez and is related to Imelda Marcos, with her children: Imee, Bongbong, Irene and Aimee being his second cousins. On his mother's side, his maternal grandfather was a Spanish explorer named Don Juan del Gallego who founded the town of Del Gallego, Camarines Sur. His uncle Manuel del Gallego became governor of Camarines Sur in the 1940s. He is also related to actress Heart Evangelista through her mother, Maria Cecilia del Gallego-Payawal, who is his first cousin. He went to Ateneo de Manila University Grade School from 1954 to 1962 and to Ateneo de Manila University High School from 1962 to 1965. In 1965, he and his family moved to New York City after his father's election to the World Medical Association. There, he studied at Forest Hills High School from 1965 to 1966. During this time, Romualdez worked as a part-time waiter in Manhattan and as a grocery-boy at an A&P; supermarket in Queens. Romualdez returned to the Philippines in 1966 where he went to De La Salle College. In 1970, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from the university.  Career  RIght after graduating college, Romualdez started working as a TV newscaster and then anchor for NewsWatch, a newscast television program that aired on Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS). He rose to become executive assistant to the station's chairman of the board, and eventually was president and vice chairman of the Board of the Television Corporation of the Philippines. In 1989, he coordinated the media group for the official visit of then-Vice President Salvador Laurel to the United States. He also coordinated then- President Joseph Estrada's working visit to the U.S. in 1999. He was also a member of the business delegation of presidents Ramos during his visit to the U.S. and Mexico in May 1997 and to APEC Canada in November 1997; Aquino III during his visits to China, Japan and New Zealand; and Duterte during his official visit to Japan.

Romualdez also held various positions including being vice president of the Rotary Club of Manila, executive vice president of the Philippine Trade Foundation, and chairman of the Philippine offices of several US-based multinational firms, including FCB Manila and Weber Shandwick Philippines. From January 2016 to September 2017, he was the honorary consul of Luxembourg to the Philippines. He is currently the President and CEO of Stargate Media Corp., an affiliate of the Philippine Star and the publishing company of PEOPLE Asia magazine, where Romualdez is the publisher. He is also a columnist at the Philippine Star. = Ambassador to the United States = From July to December 2016, Romualdez was appointed by President Duterte as his Special Envoy to the United States. In December 2016, he was asked by President Duterte to be the Ambassador of the Philippines to the United States. However, he declined the offer saying he could not assume the post for at least six months since he was to have an emergency operation for an eye ailment in January. His appointment as special envoy was later renewed on July 9, 2017. On July 24, 2017, Romualdez was finally nominated by the President to be the Philippines' Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States of America. He was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on August 23, 2017 and took his oath on August 29. He presented his credentials to United States President Donald Trump on November 29. He is the third member of the Romualdez family to occupy the post after his uncle Eduardo Romualdez and first cousin, once removed Benjamin Romualdez served from 1971 to 1986. In May 2018, Ambassador Romualdez and the Philippine Embassy were criticized for choosing to celebrate their Independence Day celebrations at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. Despite the criticisms, however, the 120th Philippine Independence Day celebration still went through with the embassy defending their choice of venue by calling it \\"elegant and historic\\" for the occasion. As ambassador, Romualdez facilitated the return of the Balangiga bells back to the Philippines. He represented the Philippine government during the official turnover ceremony of the bells in November 2018 and was present during the welcoming ceremony and handover of the bells in Villamor Airbase in December.  Personal life  Romualdez is married to Maria Lourdes Marquez-Romualdez. They have four children.

The newspaper came on the scene as a technological leader, with a Goss Urbanite press and eventually a custom-built facility in the Colonia Doctores neighborhood. It was printed in color, a rarity for Mexican papers of the time, which often remained in black-and-white for several more decades. It was often considered loyal to governments in power. The newspaper had a traditional emphasis on society and entertainment news. It sponsored the El Heraldo de M√©xico Awards, an annual media and sports award, given out between 1966 and 2002. =Diario Monitor= In October 2003, Jos√© Guti√©rrez Viv√≥, host and president of Grupo Monitor, associated with the Monitor radio newscast and Mexico City's Radio Monitor 1320/1560, acquired El Heraldo de M√©xico and its sister daily, El Heraldo de Puebla.

The highway was built from 1968 to 1973 in several stages and was intended to provide seaport access for Zambia and to expand the transport options for Zambia, Malawi and the then Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo). Description The Tanzam Highway is about 2400 km long and is paved. The road leads largely through very mountainous areas to an altitude of over 2000 m. It starts in Dar es Salaam, the largest city of Tanzania, and passes through the regions of Coast, Morogoro, Iringa, Njombe, Mbeya and Songwe. The highway crosses the Mikumi National Park between Morogoro and Iringa. In Zambia it is part of the Great North Road and is marked T2; in Tanzania it bears the label T1. In the vicinity of Iringa, the highway passes by the site of a battle near Ilula-Lugalo, where a monument commemorates the defeat of the German colonial troops on the Hehe on 17 August 1891. In Zambia, the Great North Road crosses the Kapiri Mposhi and Nakonde areas. The distance between Nakonde and Kapiri Mposhi is approximately 832 km. Within Tanzania, the Tanzam Highway connects with four major routes: * in Chalinze, the main road to Tanga and to Kilimanjaro, Arusha and Nairobi * in Morogoro, the road to Dodoma in the west, then to Singida, Tabora, Mpanda, Shinyanga, Bariadi, Geita, Mwanza, Musoma, Bukoba and Kigoma * in Makambako there is a road up to Songea, going on to Mtwara * Uyole/Mbeya is on the road to Malawi through Tukuyu,Rungwe and Kasumulu, Kyela. West from Makambako, Tanzam frequently runs along the TAZARA Railway. This road is the main link between East Africa and Southern Africa. Significance During the apartheid era in South Africa and the civil wars in Angola and Mozambique, this highway, together with the TAZARA Railway, provided Zambia's the only safe access to a seaport (Dar Es Salaam), which was a prerequisite for the survival of the Zambian economy.

She was the second wife of John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute, and the mother of the 3rd Marquess. Cardiff's Sophia Gardens are named after her. Family background Sophia was the daughter of Flora Campbell, 6th Countess of Loudoun, and her husband Francis Rawdon-Hastings, Earl of Moira. Her father became Governor-General of India and Governor of Malta and was raised to the rank of Marquess of Hastings in 1816. He died in 1826. Sophia's elder sister was Lady Flora Hastings, a lady-in-waiting at the court of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Lady Flora died in 1839 of a tumour, in circumstances that gave rise to a scandal in the court, and was nursed by Sophia. Their mother died in the following year. Lady Flora wrote poetry, and after her death Sophia edited an edition of her poems. Sophia married the Marquess of Bute, who was fifteen years older than her, on 10 April 1845 at Loudoun Castle, Ayrshire,Mosley, Charles, editor.

He had no children from his first marriage, and died aged 54 in Cardiff, only three years after his second marriage, leaving a six-month-old son who succeeded to the marquessate. Sophia's first pregnancy had ended in a stillbirth. Her son John, the 3rd Marquess, was born on 12 September 1847 at Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, Scotland. Philanthropy The marchioness's Scottish roots did not prevent her taking an interest in the city of Cardiff, where her husband had had vast commercial and industrial interests. Sophia was an early supporter of the Welsh language; seeking to learn it herself, giving money for the establishment of the Welsh college at Llandovery, and providing financial assistance for the Eisteddfod. She was also responsible for donating the land and financing the construction of All Saints Church for Welsh-speaking Anglicans, in Tyndall Street, Cardiff. She took a particular interest in the appointment of clergy to livings in South Wales. In 1848 she wrote to her husband's agent, expressing her dismay at the action of the then Lord Chancellor, the Earl of Cottenham, who had the patronage of the parish of Llanilid and had presented the parish, \\"where hardly anyone speaks English, (to) a man without Welsh\\". In 1858, it was Sophia who granted the people of Cardiff the use of the Bute estates between Cathedral Road and the River Taff for use as the town's first public park. The 18-acre park, named Sophia Gardens, was financed by the Marchioness and included a lodge, flower beds, landscaping and an ornamental pond, supervised by her head gardener and ready to be opened by the summer. Death The marchioness died, aged fifty, in Edinburgh, with her twelve-year-old son at her bedside. In her will, she left provision for almshouses to be built near Edinburgh, which she specified were to be named the \\"Flora Almshouses\\" after her mother and sister. Summary of the will of Sophia Frederica Christina, Marchioness of Bute. The young marquess arranged for a cast to be taken of his mother's face. A post-mortem confirmed the cause of death as Bright's disease. The marchioness was buried in the family vault at Rothesay on the Isle of Bute.

One was a Renault Premium 250.18 truck and the other was a Renault Mascott-Master can that it was carrying. Another Renault Premium 410 cab was also severely damage along its nearside along with the other vehicles surrounding. The main cause was put down to the primary vehicle involved being un-roadworthy with the fire being started by faulty wiring within the engine compartment, particularly the starter motor.

They are related by marriage to the family of Richard Nixon, who was Eisenhower's vice-president, and was later the 37th president of the United States. Family tree  Family background  The Eisenhower family home, Abilene, Kansas The Eisenhauer (German for \\"iron hewer/miner\\") family migrated from Karlsbrunn in Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken, to America, first settling in York, Pennsylvania, in 1741, and in the 1880s moving to Kansas. Accounts vary as to how and when the German name Eisenhauer was anglicized to Eisenhower. Eisenhower's Pennsylvania Dutch ancestors, who were primarily farmers, included Hans Nikolaus Eisenhauer of Karlsbrunn, who migrated to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1741. Dwight D. Eisenhower's lineage also included English ancestors and Scottish ancestors. Parents and siblings The great grandson of Hans Nikolaus Eisenhauer was Jacob Eisenhower, a Kansas farmer. Jacob's son, David Jacob Eisenhower (1863‚Äì1942), was Dwight D. Eisenhower's father. David Jacob was a college-educated engineer, despite his own father Jacob's urging to stay on the family farm. David owned a general store in Hope, Kansas, but the business failed due to economic conditions and the family became impoverished. The Eisenhowers then lived in Texas from 1889 until 1892, and later returned to Kansas, with $24 () to their name at the time. David worked as a railroad mechanic and then at a creamery. Eisenhower's mother, Ida Elizabeth (Stover) Eisenhower, born in Virginia, of predominantly German Protestant ancestry, moved to Kansas from Virginia. She married David on September 23, 1885, in Lecompton, Kansas, on the campus of their alma mater, Lane University.

On October 12, 1927, Eisenhower married Helen Elsie Eakin (1904‚Äì1954), with whom he had a son, Milton Stover Eisenhower, Jr., in 1930 and a daughter, Ruth Eakin Eisenhower, in 1938. Earl also achieved a measure of notability, having been elected to a term in the Illinois House of Representatives, from 1965 to 1967.

Immediate family =Mamie Eisenhower= Mamie Eisenhower, painted in 1953 by Thomas E. Stephens While Eisenhower was stationed in Texas, he met Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa. Doud was the second child born to John Sheldon Doud (1870‚Äì1951), a meatpacking executive, and his wife, Elivera Mathilda Carlson (1878‚Äì1960).Susan Eisenhower, \\"Mrs. Ike: Memories and Reflections on the Life of Mamie Eisenhower\\" (Capitol Books, 2002) She grew up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Colorado Springs, Colorado, Denver, Colorado, and the Doud winter home in San Antonio, Texas. Her father, who retired at age 36, ran a meatpacking company founded by his father, Doud & Montgomery (\\"Buyers of Live Hogs\\"), and had investments in Illinois and Iowa stockyards. Her mother was a daughter of Swedish immigrants. She had three sisters: Eleanor Carlson Doud, Eda Mae Doud, and Mabel Frances \\"Mike\\" Doud. Doud and Eisenhower were immediately taken with each other. He proposed to her on Valentine's Day in 1916. A November wedding date in Denver was moved up to July 1 due to the pending U.S. entry into World War I. They moved many times during their first 35 years of marriage. =Children= The Eisenhowers had two sons, Doud Dwight \\"Icky\\" Eisenhower, and John Eisenhower. He is the most recently serving U.S. president (as of 2020) to have had only sons. Five of his successors ‚Äì L. Johnson, Nixon, Clinton, G.W. Bush, and Obama ‚Äì only had daughters. Doud Eisenhower Doud with his parents, Mamie and Dwight. Doud Dwight Eisenhower (September 24, 1917 ‚Äì January 2, 1921) was the first son of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower. He was named \\"Doud\\" in honor of his mother (whose maiden name was Doud) and \\"Dwight\\" in honor of his father. He was commonly called \\"Ikky\\" (pronounced as \\"icky\\") by his parents. Doud was born in San Antonio, Texas, then he and his mother moved to Denver, Colorado while his father was stationed at Camp Meade in Maryland. Regarding Dwight's family contacts while on the U.S. Army's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy, biographers Lester and Irene David wrote: > He called Mamie several times a week [while on the convoy], beginning each > call with requests for news about Icky. How was he growing? What new > mischief had he gotten into? Once Mamie interrupted with, \\"Listen here...how > about asking how your wife is?\\" Chastened; Ike chatted for a moment about > Mamie but soon turned the conversation to Icky again. Mamie gave up. Eisenhower Center After he and his family relocated to Fort Meade in Severn, Maryland, his mother hired a 16-year-old local girl as a maid. She had been recovering from scarlet fever. In December 1920, shortly before Christmas, Ikky caught scarlet fever from her. Though his mother tried desperately to save him, even calling a specialist from Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Ikky died on January 2, 1921. His father referred to this incident as \\"the most shattering moment of their lives, one that almost destroyed their marriage\\". Mamie and Dwight blamed themselves for Ikky's death; had they checked the girl's background, they would have found out that she had scarlet fever. In his biography of Eisenhower, Stephen E. Ambrose wrote: > These feelings had to be suppressed if the marriage was to survive the > disaster, but suppression did not eliminate the unwanted thoughts, only made > them harder to live with. Both the inner-directed guilt and the projected > feelings of blame placed a strain on their marriage. So did the equally > inevitable sense of loss, the grief that could not be comforted, the feeling > that all the joy had gone out of life. \\"For a long time, it was as if a > shining light had gone out in Ike's life,\\" Mamie said later. \\"Throughout all > the years that followed, the memory of those bleak days was a deep inner > pain that never seemed to diminish much.\\" On January 7, 1921, less than a week after his death, Ikky was buried in Fairmont Cemetery in Denver, Colorado. Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death. In 1966, he was re-interred at the Eisenhower Presidential Center. His parents were buried next to him. In 1967, Eisenhower would look to Ikky's death as \\"the greatest disappointment and disaster of my life, the one I have never been able to forget completely\\". For the rest of his life, he sent Mamie flowers on Ikky's birthday each year. John Eisenhower John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower (August 3, 1922 ‚Äì December 21, 2013) was born in Denver, Colorado. John served in the United States Army, his decorated military career spanned from before, during, and after his father's presidency, and he retired from active duty as a brigadier general in 1963 and then altogether in 1974. Coincidentally, John graduated from West Point on D-Day, June 6, 1944. After his military service, he became an author and military historian, and served as U.S. Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971, during the administration of President Richard Nixon, previously his father's vice president. John Eisenhower married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10, 1947, only a few days before her twenty-first birthday. Barbara was born on June 15, 1926, in Fort Knox, Kentucky, into an Army family. She was the daughter of Col. Percy Walter Thompson (November 8, 1898 ‚Äì June 19, 1974) by his wife Beatrice (n√©e Birchfield). Col. Thompson was commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces. John and Barbara had four children: David, Barbara Ann, Susan Elaine, and Mary Jean. David, after whom Camp David is named, married Richard Nixon's daughter Julie in 1968. John and Barbara divorced in 1986 after thirty-nine years of marriage. In 1988, Barbara married widower Edwin J. Foltz, a former vice president at the Campbell Soup Company. She died on September 19, 2014, in Gladwyne, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. In 1988, John married Joanne Thompson. He lived in Trappe, Maryland, after moving there from Kimberton, Pennsylvania.

Convicted of the 1963 strangling of Zenovia Clegg, and a suspect in two murders in his native Maine, it is also suggested that Terry could've been responsible for even more killings, including several attributed to the Boston Strangler. He died in prison in 1981, from pulmonary embolism, after suffering from lung cancer. Early life Charles was born on May 26, 1930 to parents Frank Terry and Oakland-born Susie Terry (n√©e Pelkie). He also had an older sister, Frances. The Terry family managed a store selling hand-braided rugs on Pleasant Street, while Frank worked at the Kennobec Canoe Company, owned by his brother George. Little Charlie was regarded as a normal boy with a loving attitude towards his parents, but at the age of 4, he hit his head on a rock and nearly drowned in the Messalonskee Lake. He was found unconscious and floating face-down in the water, and was speedily resuscitated. According to his parents, this incident would later permanently change him. In 1935, Terry enrolled into the North Grammar School, moving for a short time to the Brookside Elementary before returning to North Grammar. On December 19, 1941, the family moved to Winslow, where Charles attended the Winslow High School until the 10th grade, when he quit. At school, the youngster was often described as a misfit and a loner by his classmates, never getting along with teachers and infamous for stealing, especially from the boys' locker room. On one instance, he was caught stealing from the workshop of the McQuillan family by the two boys, John and Robert. Being much bigger than them, he picked up a rock and threw it at the brothers, hitting John on the back of the head, leaving a permanent scar. In an act of revenge, the McQuillans strung wires between two trees and awaited for Terry's return. When they saw him snooping around again, they lured Charles into chasing them, resulting in his neck hitting the wire and Terry falling on his back. After this, he stopped visiting the workshop. On another occasion, the 15-year-old Terry stole a brand-new bike from a boy named Billy. However, Billy teamed up with Lee Hapworth, who lived near Terry in Winslow, and they managed to steal a canvas boat owned by the latter. When Charles' father came to them, they demanded that his son return the bike, and a short while later, the bike turned up at the Hapworths' farm. Early crimes Standing tall at 6 feet, 5 inches (1, 95 meters) and very slim, the 17-year-old soon joined the Marine Corps, serving from 1947 to 1949. He was dishonorably discharged after he was arrested and convicted of stealing a vehicle while absent on leave. While incarcerated, Terry alleged that he was raped by other inmates. Three months after his release, in April 1951, the now-21-year-old assaulted two women on the same evening in Kennebec County, raping one of them. He was quickly returned to prison for 8 years, where he was unpopular with fellow inmates, as he constantly destroyed property, drew obscene pictures and was a public disturbance. Terry was released in 1958, and on November 1 of that year, he married Theresa Lessard LaRochelle, from North Vassalboro, a divorce√© with two children. The following year, Charles was arrested for assaulting a Maine woman in her 50s, breaking her jaw in two places and cutting her scalp. While serving his sentence in the Maine State Prison, he was diagnosed as an intelligent psychopath with a sexual sadism disorder. Although Theresa divorced Terry in 1961, after his release, the two became acquainted again, resulting in a son named Mark Shawn LaRochelle being born on July 26, 1962. Charles denied the claim of being the child's father. Over the following years, he had several jobs, including working as a truck driver, painter and laborer, but struggled to keep them. In 1962, he was fired from two jobs he held in his native Waterville: from the-then Crescent Hotel for not following orders, and from the Wyandotte Worsted Co. for having a criminal record. During this period, Terry was noted for having lived in several locations: New Orleans, New York, Waterville and Boston. Murders =Shirley Coolen= On May 26, 1951, the 24-year-old Coolen was found strangled with her own scarf in a flower garden in Brunswick. Charles Terry is suspected in her killing, but was never charged. =Patricia Wing= On June 3, 1958, the 29-year-old Oakland native was killed in a remote wooded area in Fairfield, allegedly after being picked up by a man with whom she was having an affair. Wing's lover, Augusta business executive Everett Savage, Jr., was charged with her murder, but was only convicted of assault and served his time in prison for it. However, it is believed that Terry had actually killed Wing. =Donna Kimmey= On December 17, 1962, stewardess Donna Kimmey was strangled in Kenner, Louisiana. Terry would later tell New York investigators that he had been in New Orleans in December 1962. =Zenovia Clegg= According to his confession, on May 30, 1963, Terry and the 62-year-old Clegg, a victim of cancer who wore scarves to cover the surgical scars on her neck, had arranged to have sex at a hotel in Times Square. However, Zenovia humiliated Charles because of his impotence. The enraged man then began beating Clegg, strangling her with her scarf while on the bed, tying it into a bow afterwards. After that, he sexually assaulted her naked body with a liquor bottle, posing it in a sexual manner, before leaving the premises. A few days later, a maid discovered the body, as well as a pear placed next to the victim's right leg. Arrest, sentence and death Seven days after the discovery of Clegg's body, a team of detectives led by Thomas J. Cavanagh, Jr. managed to track down Terry in a Greenwich Village bar. He was quickly arrested, and under interrogation by Cavanagh, Terry quickly confessed to the killing, describing it in graphic detail. For this, he was quickly charged with murder, convicted and sentenced to die in the electric chair. However, taking into account his mental state, a judge later commuted his sentence to life imprisonment. On April 15, 1981, Terry, who was suffering from lung cancer, died in prison from pulmonary embolism. Connection to the Boston Strangler While examining the Clegg crime scene, Det. Cavanagh noted that it shockingly resembled the recent murders in Boston. Not only that, but during an interrogation, Terry himself confessed to visiting Boston on the weekends, coinciding with the time that the Strangler's five victims had been killed. However, the Boston police, fearing scrutiny from the media, weren't interested in Cavanagh's findings. Also, he wasn't allowed to continue his interrogation until Terry's confession for the New York killing was taped. Boston police were informed, and within hours, the then-Chief of Homicide Unit John Donovan arrived in New York City, with the intention of questioning Terry. However, the latter refused to talk to the former. With the help of other retired detectives, nicknamed the \\"Over the Hill Gang\\", Cavanagh continued to investigate the Boston killings, with the hope of somehow connecting Terry to at least some of them. During the process, he employed the help of his son Brian, now a prosecutor in Broward County, Florida. Two of the detectives, James Macken and James Le Curlo, travelled to Boston, and managed to discover that Terry had stayed at two rooming houses only blocks away from some of the stranglings. However, the Boston police chased them out of town before they could continue. John Spencer, a Fort Lauderdale psychiatrist and expert in sex-related crimes and killings, agreed with the theory, noting that there was no way that Clegg was Terry's first murder: In 2014 Confessions of the Boston Strangler, a documentary from Northern Light Productions, investigated Charles E. Terry's life.

Motta has an interdisciplinary practice making work in film, photography and sculpture. Motta's practice challenges dominant ideas about sexuality and gender using a myriad of archival material, art historical references, and the body.  Early life and education  Motta was born and raised in Bogot√°, Colombia. He received a BFA from The School of Visual Arts in 2001 and an MFA from Bard College in 2003. Motta attended the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program two years later.  Work  In 2008, Motta had his first show in Philadelphia at the Institute of Contemporary Art. Titled Carlos Motta: The Good Life, the large-scale documentary project, which began in 2005, explored the history and effects of US interventionist policies in Latin America. More than 300 interviews were conducted between the artist and civilians in 12 different Latin American cities. In 2009, Motta had his first a solo exhibition in New York at MoMA PS1, New York, titled On-site 1: Carlos Motta. The exhibition included two newspapers and black vinyl mural and investigated the School of the Americas (SOA)-a Cold War institution sponsored by the U.S. government to train Latin American soldiers in counterinsurgency tactics and various military tactics. One year later, Motta showed at the Museo de Arte del Banco de la Rep√∫blica in Bogot√°. In 2012, the artist began working on the database documentary wewhofeeldifferently.info as part of the New Museum's Museum as Hub program. The culmination of the project, titled We Who Feel Differently, approached and re-negotiated the idea of sexual and gender \\"difference\\" in terms of greater equality. The project included an exhibition, several public events, and symposium with guest speakers. At The Tanks in 2013, Motta organized the symposium Gender Talents: A Special Address which included artists and activists like Esben Esther Pirelli Benestad, Giuseppe Campuzano, J. Jack Halberstam, Beatriz Preciado, Dean Spade, Wu Tsang & Safra Project, Del LaGrace Volcano and more. Motta has frequently exhibited with Galerie Vermelho, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, and P.P.O.W.

After winning two minor races in the autumn of 2016 he made significant improvement in the following spring to take the Mainichi Hai and the Satsuki Sho. Later that year he finished fifth in the Tokyo Yushun and second in the St Lite Kinen. As a four-year-old in 2018 he failed to win in six starts but ran well in several major races, finishing third in the Osaka Hai and the Mile Championship and fourth in the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho. In 2019 he recorded his first victory in almost two years when he won the Osaka Hai. Background Al Ain is a bay colt with a white star and two white socks bred in Japan by Northern Farm. The horse entered the ownership of Sunday Racing and was sent into training with Yasutoshi Ikee. He was named after a city in Abu Dhabi. He was from the seventh crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. Al Ain's dam Dubai Majesty was a top class performer on dirt in the United States, recording her biggest win when taking the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint as a five-year-old in 2010. Two days after her Breeders' Cup win the mare was put up for auction at the Fasig-Tipton Kentucky November select breeding stock sale and bought for $1,100,000 by Northern Farm's Katsumi Yoshida. She was a descendant of the Virginia-bred mare Knight's Gal who was the female-line ancestor of many good winners including Palace Malice and Mutafaweq. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Al Ain began his racing career with a win in an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1600 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 29 October. On 13 December at Hanshin Racecourse he followed up by taking the Senryo Sho over the same distance, beating Kyohei and thirteen others. =2017: three-year-old season= Al Ain's trainer Yasutoshi Ikee On his three-year-old debut, sixteen days after his final run of 2016, Al Ain was moved up in class to contest the Grade 3 Shinzan Kinen at Kyoto on 8 January and sustained his first defeat as he came home sixth of the fifteen runners behind Kyohei, Taisei Starry, Persian Knight, Trust and My Style. After a break of two and a half months the colt returned for the Grade 3 Mainichi Hai (a trial race for the Satsuki Sho) over 1800 metres at Hanshin in which he was ridden by Kohei Matsuyama and started the 6.7/1 second favourite behind Satono Arthur in an eight-runner field. After racing in second place he took the lead in the straight and won by half a length from Satono Arthur with Kiseki half a length back in third. On 26 April, with Matsuyama again in saddle, started a 21.4/1 outsider in an eighteen-runner field for the 77th running of the Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at Nakayama Racecourse. The filly Fan Dii Naa (winner of the Flower Cup) started favourite while the other contenders included Suave Richard (Tokinominoru Kinen), Cadenas (Yayoi Sho), Persian Knight, Rey de Oro, Win Bright and Satono Ares (Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes). After tracking the leaders in the early stages Al Ain turned into the straight in fifth place behind Clincher and began to thread his way to the front. Fan Dii Na took the lead, before giving way to Persian Knight but Al Ain maintained his run, gained the advantage in the final strides and won by a neck. Matsuyama, who was winning his first Grade 1 race said \\"I can't believe we won! He ran a strong race last time so I was quite confident today. He wasn't responding well in the last two corners but stretched really well in the straight. He's easy to ride so I think he'll have no problem with the extra distance in the Derby.\\" Six weeks after his win at Nakayama Al Ain was stepped up in distance and started the 5.3/1 fourth choice in the betting for the 2400 metre Tokyo Yushun. After being slightly hampered early in the straight he stayed on well on the outside without ever looking likely to win and came home fifth behind Rey de Oro, Suave Richard, Admirable and My Style, beaten just over two lengths by the winner. Christophe Lemaire took the ride when Al Ain returned from his summer break to contest the Grade 2 St Lite Kinen (a trial race for the Kikuka Sho) over 2200 metres at Nakayama on 18 September. He started odds-on favourite but after taking the lead in the straight he was overtaken and beaten into second place by Mikki Swallow. The Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres at Kyoto on 22 October was run in heavy rain on soft ground. Starting the 3.9/1 second choice Al Ain moved to the outside to deliver his challenge in the straight but could make no headway and came home seventh of the eighteen runners behind Kiseki. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Al Ain was given a rating of 118, making him 90th best horse in the world, the eighth best horse in Japan, and the seventeenth best three-year-old colt. =2018: four-year-old season= Al Ain began his third campaign in the Grade 2 Kyoto Kinen on 11 February when he finished second to Clincher with Rey de Oro in third place. In the Grade 1 Osaka Hai at Hanshin on 1 April he was ridden by Yuga Kawada and started second favourite at odds of 2.6/1. After tracking the leaders he took second place behind Suave Richard in the straight but lost the runner-up spot to Persian Knight in the final strides. Four weeks later the colt was sent to Hong Kong for the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Sha Tin Racecourse and finished fifth of the eight runners behind Pakistan Star. Al Ain returned from the summer break on 23 September at Nakayama when he finished second by a neck to Rey de Oro in the Sankei Sho All Comers. In the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho at Tokyo on 28 October he raced in second place for most of the way but was unable to quicken in the closing stages and camehome fourth behind Rey de Oro, Sungrazer and Kiseki. In November the colt was dropped back in distance to contest the Mile Championship over 1600 metres at Kyoto. Ridden by Kawada, he tracked the leader Aerolithe before taking the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the last 100 metres and finished third behind Stelvio and Persian Knight. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Al Ain was again given a rating of 118, making him 78th best horse in the world. =2019: five-year-old season= On 10 March 2019 Al Ain made his first appearance as a five-year-old in the Grade 2 Kinko Sho over 2000 metres at Chukyo Racecourse and came home fifth of the thirteen runners behind Danon Premium, Lys Gracieux, Air Windsor and Persian Knight. Ikee felt that the horse was unsuited by the \\"shifty\\" ground but admitted \\"He does have a difficult side and, mentally, things won't change\\". On 31 March at Hanshin Al Ain (equipped with blinkers) was ridden by Yuichi Kitamura when he started at odds of 21.2/1 in his second attempt to win the Osaka Hai. Blast Onepiece started favourite in a fourteen-runner field which also included Kiseki, Persian Knight, Wagnerian, Air Windsor (Challenge Cup), Stelvio, Sungrazer (Sapporo Kinen), Epoca d'Oro and Makahiki. Kitamura settled the horse on the inside behind the leaders as Epoca d'Oro set a steady pace from Kiseki. As the field entered the straight Al Ain made a forward move to take the lead 200 metres from the finish and kept on well to win by a neck from Kiseki with Wagnerian another neck away in third. After the race Kitamura commented \\"We had a good draw and everything worked to our advantage. He was able to focus using the blinkers and he responded well so I just concentrated on keeping him comfortable\\". Al Ain's next appearance saw him made the 7.4/1 fifth choice in the betting for the Grade 1 Takarazuka Kinen at Hanshin on 23 June. He ran in third place for most of the way in a strongly-run race but was unable to make any significant progress in the straight and finished fourth behind Lys Gracieux, Kiseki and Suave Richard. He returned for an autumn campaign but made no impact in three races. He finished fourteenth behind Almond Eye in the Temmo Sho, sixteenth to Indy Champ in the Mile Championship and eleventh behind Lys Gracieux in the Arima Kinen.

In 2018, Burke executive produced the film, O.G. which premiered on HBO on February 23, 2019. In February 2019, it was announced that Burke had signed Saint Jhn to his management company, Circle of Success. Burke has spoken about how meeting Saint Jhn pushed his management vision further, as he heard Saint Jhn's music at a listening party. According to Burke, \\"The night [Roc Nation co-founder Tyran Smith], played a preview of Saint Jhn's new album, I drove home listening to Collection One and had an immediate sonic connection to his music.\\" Shortly after, Burke became Saint Jhn's manager. = It's a Hard Truth, Ain't It = In August of 2020, Biggs took to social media to announce an Emmy nomination for ‚ÄúIt's a Hard Truth, Ain't It‚Äù. Kareem Burke co-directed and executive produced the project and it premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival alongside O.G., another film that was produced at Indiana‚Äôs Pendleton Correctional Facility during the same period. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Hard Truth...‚Äù documents thirteen incarcerated men as they study filmmaking while exploring a therapeutic process of how they landed in prison with lengthy sentences. The men all received directors credit for the film along with O.G. director Madeleine Sackler. Several of those thirteen men were also cast as first-time actors in O.G., having the opportunity to work with Tony, Golden Globe, and Emmy winning actor, Jeffrey Wright. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Hard Truth Ain‚Äôt It‚Äù is the first widely released documentary to be directed by men still incarcerated in a maximum security prison.

Construction on the church was likely completed in 1658. The church is dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua and is constructed in the Baroque style with a Rococo frontispiece. The convent and church fell into ruin by the end of the 19th century; Archbishop Jer√¥nimo Thom√© da Silva allowed a commission to demolish and sell the contents of the 1915; it lacked the funds to demolish the church, but sold its contents to Jos√© Mariano Filho in 1916. The monumental fa√ßade of the church served as a model for Baroque churches across the Northeast Region of Brazil; it and its intricate garden remain on the site. The church and convent were listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1941. History View of nave and chancel Pope Alexander VII (1599-1667) separated the Franciscan Province of Santo Ant√¥nio in Brazil from the Province of Santo Ant√¥nio in Portal in the mid-17th century. Frei Antonio de Santa Maria Jaboat√£o conceived the idea of a convent removed from the city of Salvador. Father Jo√£o Batista accepted the donation of two small pieces of land from Father Pedro Garcia, owner of the Engenho Velho sugarcane plantation. Batista considered moving the order to Maragogipe, but began construction of a large-scale convent and church on the Iguape site. A novitiate was established on the site in 1654, the second in Brazil, and materials for a new structure were accumulated from the surrounding area. Construction began in 1658 and the church was consecrated in 1660; it was likely not fully completed at this point. Completion of the church likely dates to 1686, as evidenced by a marker located at the entrance of the convent with the date. Construction of the church and convent are similar to that of the Convent and Church of Saint Anthony, which was consecrated in 1650. A hospital was established at the church and convent in 1686; it was transferred to Cachoeira in 1729 and is known as the Hospital S√£o Jo√£o de Deus. There were twenty friars at the convent in 1759. The novitiate ceased in 1824, and the convent had only five residents by 1857. By 1888 the convent and church were \\"only serving as a lair to the nocturnal birds\\". The Franciscans abandoned the convent in the early 20th century. They donated the convent and church was donated to the Archdiocese of Salvador on January 19, 1915. Archbishop Jer√¥nimo Thom√© da Silva formed a commission to survey the condition of the convent and church; the commission demolished the convent and sold both the building materials and interior elements of the building. The commission lacked the funds to demolish the church and sold the property to Jos√© Mariano Filho in 1916. Mariano Filho removed or sold the church images, azulejos, floors, linings of the nave, furniture in jacaranda, and lavabo in lioz; elements of the church that were removed to Solar Monjope, his residence in Rio de Janeiro were lost with its demolition in the 1970s. The balustrades in carved jacaranda of the church and convent were transferred to the entrance of the Federal Ministry of Education building in Salvador. Location The Convent and Church of Saint Antony is located on the Iguape estuary of the Paragua√ßu River far from the city center of Cachoeira. Access to the church and convent was by river for much of its history; roads to the community of Iguape were only constructed later. The church and convent is set back from the Iguape on a slight embankment, but a single wing of the convent extends out to the river. Structure Ruins of the convent The Convent and Church of Saint Antony is a large-scale complex consisting of a two-story church, convent, and garden that leads to the mooring. Its walls are of mixed masonry. The church and convent has a stone quay on the Iguape; the quay it is still active. =Church yard= A multi-level garden extends from the quay up to the entrance of the church. The walls on either side of the garden are decorated with large volutes and other Baroque decorative elements. A large cross sits in the church garden on the second level from the quay. It has a monumental pedestal in the shape of a polyhedron. The pedestal is of sandstone and richly decorated in stylized floral, shell, seashell, tropical fruit, and mask motifs. The courtyard of the convent sat on the other side of the wall that extends to the water. A veranda once extended from the top of the wing that extends to the river; it was called \\"the best and only source of pleasure for the friars in this house\\". =Convent= The convent consisted of two courtyards, one lower and one higher towards the convent. The conical hooded chimney of the kitchen remains. A well was located at the far end of the convent; an aqueduct delivered water to the kitchen. =Frontispiece= The frontispiece of the Church of Saint Antony represented a new design; it spread widely to Franciscan churches in the Northeast of Brazil. Its design, closely following the independence of the Franciscans in Brazil from those in Portugal, was like a \\"resounding like a cry for freedom.\\" =Tower= The church tower sits back from the church and convent. It has an octagonal dome. =Church= The frontispiece is in the Baroque style and faces the river. It has a wide covered gallery with five semi-circular arches, three of them occupied by wooden doors. Five choir windows are above the portals. In contrast, the fa√ßades of the convent and the Church of the Third Order are, in comparison, sober. The pinnacle of the fa√ßade is in three parts with five semi-circular arches. The flaming rococo pediments, according to the art historian Germain Bazin, display elements of Chinese architecture, probably via the influence of architecture in the Portuguese colony of Macau. A bell tower rises above the right side of the church; it is recessed from the fa√ßade. The design of the church is similar to that of the convents of Carmo, Gra√ßa and Desterro, in Salvador, all constructed in the same period. The church plan is typical to others of the period; it has a rectangular plan with a single nave with two side aisles superposed by tribunes and a cross sacristy. Its side corridors are superposed by tribunes and a deep chapel. The church interior was richly decorated, but very little remains of its original decoration. Protected status The lavabo of the church was listed by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938; the site of the ruins of the convent and church were listed as a historic structure at a later date. Access The ruins of the church and convent are open to the public and may be visited.

He represented Nike, Inc. as the supplier of team hockey jerseys and other apparel for the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). His work included the supply of uniforms for 49 Ice Hockey World Championships, four Winter Olympic Games, and more than 75,000 hockey jerseys. He received the Paul Loicq Award from the IIHF for contributions to international ice hockey in 2012. Early life Angus was born July 31, 1952, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He attended Appleby College in Oakville, Ontario, before studying business administration and management at Sheridan College from 1970 to 1972. Career Angus began working for Nike, Inc. hockey operations in June 1995. He was in charge of the contract between the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and Nike as an official supplier. He coordinated the supply of hockey jerseys and off-ice apparel for teams in the IIHF's top divisions at the Ice Hockey World Championships and the Winter Olympic Games. His work included supplying 49 Ice Hockey World Championships events and four Winter Olympic Games. During that time he supplied the IIHF with more than 75,000 hockey jerseys. He worked directly with IIHF member associations on the design of each national jersey, and was able to customize each jersey at the arena with the player's name and number. His work meant that he was often the first person to arrive and the last to leave at championship events. When National Hockey League (NHL) players participated in the Olympics, he was on call to produce replacement jerseys by the next day for last-minute roster changes due to injuries. Angus produced special occasion jerseys for the IIHF centennial celebrations in 2008. These included throwback-style jersey designs for the top-division teams which became popular collector's items. For ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics, he incorporated \\"discovery pieces\\" into each jersey for Canada and other countries. Angus felt that the \\"discovery pieces\\" which were national motifs and symbols sewn into the jersey design, noticeable at a close distance, was his favourite work. He said that the 2010 Winter Olympics was his busiest time when he produced 1,300 game-quality jerseys, which included complete sets of home and away jerseys for each men's and women's team. He also produced additional jerseys for each NHL player to contribute to charities, which included disaster relief fundraising and the \\"Hockey for Haiti\\" program, and online auctions for Olympic memorabilia. Later life The IIHF bestowed the Paul Loicq Award on Angus in 2012, in recognition of his contributions to international ice hockey. He was later credited by the Hockey Hall of Fame for donations made to its collection during the 2014‚Äì15, and 2016‚Äì17 seasons. He retired from Nike in February 2019.

Victory closed in 2019. Description Victory Bar was an Orwellian-themed bar and gastropub located at the intersection of Southeast 37th Street and Southeast Division Street in Portland's Richmond neighborhood. The bar had dated television screens broadcasting a collection of curated live music videos. The collection, called Victory Vision, featured performances by David Bowie, The Kinks, and The Who. The interior was decorated with propaganda posters reminiscent of George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and stripe-painted rifles. Initially, the bar served small plates for wine pairings, and later focused on Belgian beers. According to Willamette Week Andi Prewitt, Victory offered \\"solid, affordable cocktails alongside warm and filling dishes like the perennial favorite spaetzle\\". History Yoni Laos and Amalie Roberts opened Victory Bar in late 2006 or January 2007. Victory was named Willamette Week inaugural Bar of the Year in 2013. The newspaper's Matthew Korfhage said at the time, the bar \\"isn't shiny or new or even particularly fashionable. It's just a goddamn winner.\\" Eric Moore was an owner, as of 2012. Laos was the sole owner, as of 2014. On June 13, 2019, management unexpectedly confirmed plans to close of Facebook, posting: \\"It's the last nights of Victory my friends. Come say goodbye tonight or tomorrow.\\" Victory Bar's last day of operations was June 14. Laos, who decided to move on to \\"new and more creative adventures\\", said of the closure: > When I was about five years old, growing up in a small town in Arizona, an > old Obi-Wan Kenobi-type sage stopped me on my tricycle and he told me this: > 'Son, if you want to make it big in this world... think about serving > absinthe milkshakes to people while playing Dr. Hook music videos in the > background.'

I spent 13 years in this building. Can't > a guy move on to new adventures? Victory was replaced by a cocktail bar called The Automatic. Owner Andrew Finkelman said, \\"Victory Bar was open for 13 years and it was a classic bar, so I‚Äôm keeping the bones. I think people who liked Victory Bar will like The Automatic.\\" Reception The bar has been described as \\"beloved\\".

Scottish Studies Review, 5 (1). pp. 57‚Äì73. ISSN 1745-3186 at note 2. He was well known as a BBC radio broadcaster by the 1930s. Early life He was born in Greenock, the son of Matthew Blake, machinery manufacturer, and his wife Ursula Scott McCulloch. He was educated at Greenock Academy and Glasgow University. He then trained as a solicitor. During World War I he served in the British Army and was wounded during the Gallipoli Campaign. After the war Blake worked at the Glasgow Evening News, where Neil Munro was editor from 1918. At this period he had contact with Red Clydeside through his dramatic works, sitting on the council of the Scottish National Players. As a playwright, he came under the influence of Andrew P. Wilson. London journalist Blake moved to London where he stayed from 1924 to 1932. There he was an editor of John O'London's Weekly, replacing Sidney Dark as subeditor and writing a number of columns, to 1928; and then edited the Strand Magazine. The Porpoise Press and Faber & Faber The Porpoise Press, in existence from 1922 to 1939, was founded in Edinburgh by Roderick Watson Kerr and George Malcolm Thomson. Blake had contact with Thomson from 1923, when the Press published his one-act play The Mother. Thomson's 1927 book Caledonia broached the \\"condition of Scotland\\" question that preoccupied Blake and other Scottish intellectuals into the 1930s. Late in 1929, Blake was introduced to Geoffrey Faber, by Frank Vigor Morley. He became in 1930 a director of Faber & Faber, playing a role in the Porpoise Press: Faber & Faber effectively took it over, through interest in Scottish national literature. Morning Tide (1931), a novel by Neil Gunn, was an immediate commercial success for the Press. At this point Thomson and Blake were aligned in nationalist politics. Thomson's 1931 pamphlet The Kingdom of Scotland Restored, advocating a form of Scottish home rule, had Blake's approval, and the Introduction was signed by Blake, Andrew Dewar Gibb, Moray McLaren and William Power. By that year, Blake had joined the National Party of Scotland (NPS). Gunn became involved in the efforts, which succeeded, to merge the NPS, of the left, with the conservative Scottish Party; on Thomson's account, Blake encouraged Gunn to do so. Returning to Scotland in 1932, Blake worked for the Porpoise Press, which in 1934 published William Power's My Scotland. Both Gibb and Power later became leaders of the merged Scottish National Party. Blake and Thomson then fell out, with Thomson resigning from the Press in 1933. It published his Scotland That Distressed Area in 1935. Blake's The Shipbuilders was published the same year, by Faber & Faber. They differed in method: Thomson offered partisan polemics, Blake a journalist's realism expressed as a novel. Later life Blake lived at The Glenan, Helensburgh and elsewhere. He was a radio broadcaster and literary journalist; and was visited by T. S. Eliot. He had a regular position on This Week in Scotland, BBC Scottish Region Radio. This was despite some reservations on the part of Andrew Stewart, Scottish Programme Director, who thought Blake's nationalist views were too overt, and would have preferred Eric Linklater. Blake died in Glasgow's Southern General Hospital on 29 August 1961, survived by his wife Eliza Malcolm Lawson (Ellie), whom he had married in 1923. Works =Fiction and films= Blake's novels have been described as \\"resolutely realistic, serious, socialistic, and nationalistic\\". Their social realism included addressing industrialisation and urban poverty, topics neglected in Scottish literature until the 1920s and 1930s. He wrote a number of \\"Glasgow novels\\", as well as other fiction.Elliot, Robert David (1977) The Glasgow novel. PhD thesis, University of Glasgow. Hugh Macdiarmid discussed in 1926 a \\"new Glasgow school\\" of novelists, listing figures of whom only Catherine Carswell attained the same sort of stature as Blake.

The poem appeared during the height of the First Iraqi-Kurdish War in which the Soviet Union was involved. In 1968, an agricultural college lecturer named Mykola Kots was sentenced to seven years in camp and five years in exile after disseminating copies of the poem wherein the word 'Kurd' was replaced with 'Ukrainian'. Summary The poem has six stanzas and begins with a description of chauvinists invading the land of the Kurds. In the first four stanzas, Symonenko addresses a Kurdish friend and encourages him to fight the invader and oppressor who aims at eradicating the Kurdish language and the Kurdish people. By the end of the fourth stanza, Symonenko introduces the word 'our' and asserts that chauvinism and its deceits are the worst foes of both Kurds and Ukrainians. Analysis Svitlana Kobets of the University of Toronto argues that the poem became \\"a symbol of national resurrection and resistance to Soviet oppression\\". When the poem was secretly disseminated, it became associated with the aspirations to liberate Ukraine from the Soviet Union, and Symonenko's take on the Kurdish liberation movement gave the Ukrainian liberation movement a universal meaning. Symonenko himself asserted that historical parallels were needed because the common denominator was chauvinism, and argued that Ukrainians would end up in the same situation as the Kurds regarding statelessness if they did not fight the Soviet regime. Nataliya Romanova points out the similarities between the writing in \\"Kurds'komu bratovi with the poem \\"Kavkaz (–ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑) by Taras Shevchenko, arguing that by using Shevchenko as a prototext (source text), Symonenko echoed the sentiments of resistance against Russian rule which were prevalent in the works of Shevchenko.

He worked at increasingly senior levels as a university professor, successively at the universities of Hamburg (1925‚Äì1930), Leipzig (1930‚Äì1947) and Munich (1947‚Äì1963). Viewed by admirers as one of the leading latinists of his generation, he advanced the study of Latin literature, producing important studies of Sallust, Virgil, Horace and Tibullus which continue to engage scholars. Biography Friedrich Klingner was born into a Protestant family in Dresden, where he also attended school. Albrecht Klingner (1865‚Äì1939), his father, worked as a teacher. His paternal grandfather had been a master shoemaker. Friedrich Klingner's mother, born Martha P√∂nitz (1865‚Äì1941), was also the child of a teacher. He began his university studies in Classical Philology at T√ºbingen in 1914 but was obliged to abandon this course after one term because of the outbreak of the First World War. He was involved in the fighting, but was able to resume his studies at Berlin where his teachers included Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Eduard Norden and Paul Friedl√§nder. He was influenced, in particular, by Friedl√§nder. When Friedl√§nder took a promotion which involved a switch to the University of Marburg, Klingner followed him there. It was at Marburg that in the space of just three years he passed his state teaching exams and received both his doctorate (1921) and habilitation (1923). His doctoral dissertation was published in the Philologische Untersuchungen series: it concerned The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius. In 1923 he returned to Berlin where he took appointments as a research assistant and librarian. He became part of the circle around Werner Jaeger, and came to know, among others, Otto Regenbogen, who became a friend. After only two years in Berlin, and still aged only 31, Klingner accepted a full professorship at the newly established University of Hamburg. The teaching chair in classical philology had fallen vacant with the early death of the first incumbent, Otto Plasberg. Klingner remained at Hamburg till 1930. In 1930 he moved to Leipzig where he succeeded Richard Heinze (who had died) and whose seat as a member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences and Humanities he also took over. He taught at Leipzig till 1947, which means he was there throughout the twelve Hitler years. The new government took power in January 1933 and rapidly transformed the country into a one-party dictatorship. In November 1933 Friedrich Klingner was one of approximately 900 university professors who were persuaded to sign the \\"Declaration of the German Professors in support of Adolf Hitler\\" (\\"Bekenntnis der deutschen Professoren zu Adolf Hitler\\"). The full horrors of National Socialist government had yet to unfold, but as they did, and more particularly after 1945, those who had signed the declaration suffered varying levels of reputational damage. Leipzig was liberated in 1944 by US forces, but US occupation of the region was not envisaged in the agreements that the allied governments had already established, and in July 1944 the Americans withdrew and the Soviets moved in. The entire central third of Germany was to be administered as the Soviet occupation zone (relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet-sponsored Germany Democratic Republic (East Germany). Leipzig University would become the leading university in the new country. In 1947, however, with the drift of future political developments becoming increasingly clear, Friedrich Klingner received and accepted an invitation to move again, this time to the University of Munich (in the American occupation zone). His transfer to Munich had indeed been expected to take place ten years earlier, but at that time it had been blocked for political reasons. He continued to undertake teaching and research at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich until his retirement in 1962 or 1963, after which his involvement with the university continued. As an emeritus professor he also continued to publish his research. Friedrich Klingner served as rector of Munich University during the 1957/58 academic year. He was a full member of the \\"Philosophical Historical Class\\" at the Saxon Academy of Sciences and Humanities between 1935 and 1947, and retained his connection as a corresponding member between 1947 and 1968 despite the political and physical division of Germany which became increasingly stark between 1945 and 1961. He was a corresponding member of the Vienna-based Austrian Academy of Sciences and Humanities between 1956 and 1968. He belonged to the Swedish Academy between 1957 and 1968 and, closer to home, was a full member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities between 1947 and 1968. Works Friedrich Klingner was one of the leading latinists of his generation, and must, with Eduard Fraenkel, share much of the credit for the growing attention paid to Latinistics during the twentieth century. His researches covered classical and post-classical Latin literature. He did not hesitate to draw on earlier Greek and Latin texts where a piece of work required it. He was \\"making waves\\" even with his habilitation dissertation on Boethius in which he highlighted numerous problems with the then widely respected opening thesis of Hermann Usener that the Boethius work was in large part derivative from the Protreptikos of Aristotle. Klingner separated out and spelled out the distinctive influences of cynic, stoic, neoplatonic and christian views of the world. Of particular importance were Klingner's researches on the Roman historians, epic poets and lyric poets. He demonstrated that Sallust had his own historical perspective and was not simply some latter-day version of Posidonius. Along with Hans Drexler (though the two were working independently of one another) he refuted the thesis that the historical writings of Sallust were simply partisan presentations on behalf of one particular political party. In 1930 he turned his focus to the life-time output of Virgil, identifying a structural unity in a body of work that was many decades in the making. Klingner published works by the lyric poet Horace after painstaking analysis of the handwriting, contributing insights and clarifications in a new critical edition which, half a century after his death, continues to command wide respect. He also contributed important work on Greek literature. In respect of the Iliad and the Odyssey he determined through stylistic analyses that only the \\"Dolonie\\" and \\"Telemachy\\" could be seen as later insertions.

The Fregoso family monopolized the Dogate's lifetime office, becoming the dynasty who produced the highest number of doges in the history of the Republic.  History  Originating from the locality of Val Polcevera, on the hill above Rivarolo, they were enterprising merchants, active in the political affairs of the city from the 13th century, with Rolando, a castellan from Voltaggio, Gavi and Porto Venere. The family had a strong influence on Genoese political life and thirteen members of the Fregoso family became doges; the first of them was Domenico di Campofregoso, but the most famous was certainly Paolo Fregoso, emblematic personage of a political history dominated by ambition and by the calculation of circumstances which was generally a characteristic of the family. In addition to the Doges, other personalities distinguished themselves in various fields, military like Abraham , Augustine and Cesare Fregoso, writers like Antoniotto or ecclesiastics like Federigo Fregoso. The Fregoso family lost its political importance in the first half of the 16th century with the end of the Dogate of Ottaviano Fregoso, imprisoned by the Spaniards and died in prison in Ischia. In 1528, the family was incorporated in the Alberghi of the families De Fornari and De Ferrari ; resumed its name in 1576, but since then it no longer had any historical importance.

Its collapse was one in a long line of similar collapses over the preceding few years, of companies purporting to be Islamic banking companies, with investors in India and the United Arab Emirates, that investigating authorities afterwards stated to have been Ponzi schemes, including: Heera Group; Morgenall, Capital Plus, and Capital Infrastructure (all collapsed in 2018); Injaz International, Ajmera, Aleef, Aala Ventures, Ambidant, and Burraqh; and Sunfeast Infotech, SpeakAsia, MMA Forex, Gold AE, Ferryland Tourism, UT Markets and Exential Group. Total losses to investors over 14 such companies have been conservatively estimated at with the loss due to IMA alone estimated at  Precursor and founding in 2013  The precursor to I Monetary Advisory was a company co-founded in 2006 by Mohammad Mansoor Khan and a business partner by the name of Iliyas, which they gave the name Iliyas-Mansoor Advisory. This company was not successful, and was dissolved in 2008. Mansoor Khan's next company kept the same IMA initials. Founded in 2013, according to records at the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and contrary to claims made on the company's own website, I Monetary Advisory Private Limited was presented as an Islamic banking company. Mansoor Khan encouraged ulemas and other people with influence in the Muslim community to believe that it was a continuation of the same company founded in 2006 and was a successful business of several years' standing, promising them that the company would build hospitals and schools. Under the umbrella of the IMA Group, it later diversified into other businesses, including jewellery (with the name IMA Jewels a.k.a. IMA Jewellers), real estate (IMA Builders and Developers founded in 2017), bullion trading (IMA Bullion and Trading founded in 2014, IMA Bullion in 2015, and IMA Gold), groceries (Mulberry Greens), pharmacy (Frontline Pharma), hospitals (Frontline Multispeciality Hospital), and publishing. Amongst other things, the publishing company subsidiary published an edition of the Qur'an, and several books by author Muhammed Shuaibullah Khan (Goat of Charity, Features of the Islamic Marriage, and Investment in Joint Stock Companies); the construction company was involved in the construction of Madrassa Maseehul Uloom; and the educational subsidiary funded a computer lab in Darul Uloom Deoband. Further interests included supermarkets, planned shopping malls, and a raft of other subsidiaries (all structured as partnerships): IM Digital, IM Trends, IM Entertainment, IM Zayee, MMK Institute of Education (established 2015), and IMA Women Empowerment Business Module (established 2015).  Official investigations begin  The company first came to the attention of authorities in 2015 because of the large discounts that IMA Jewels was giving on purchases of gold in its stores, but nothing was done because of a legal loophole and inaction by investors. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) suspected the company of being a Ponzi scheme and tipped off the Revenue Department. However, the latter was unable to take action for two reasons: first, the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act (PIDFE) only allowed action to protect depositors, and an Islamic banking company is structured so that people paying money to it are legally partners in the business and not investors making deposits; and second, no-one actually complained whilst the company was still paying them. By 2017, Mansoor Khan was being investigated, with searches of his properties by the Revenue Department in April of that year, and his not having filed income tax returns since 2015. On 16 November 2018, the Assistant Commissioner of Bangalore North Sub-Division issued a forfeiture notice against IMA, which Mansoor dismissed in a public statement posted on Facebook. That same month, a public notice was issued by the Revenue Department asking for investors with complaints to come forward; however, none did. In the following month, December, Mansoor Khan contended in a formal reply to investigators that the company did not accept deposits from investors, but dealt in precious stones and metals; that it did not require licence from the RBI or the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI); that lack of depositors meant that the PIDFE Act did not apply; and that the company was a Limited Liability Partnership with partners not depositors. The authorities could have taken action with the SEBI and RBI attaching the company's properties, as they had in other earlier cases of other companies, had not the assistant commissioner's powers to do so been curtailed by the Karnataka state government at the same time, for unrelated reasons.  Closure and aftermath  In March 2019, the company ceased paying dividends to investors. The company's offices were closed to customers on 29 May 2019. Complaints by investors, which numbered 41,000 within three weeks of the closure, finally enabled investigators to proceed where they had been unable to before. By 17 June 2019, the Indian police were investigating allegations that the company had been a Ponzi scheme, and where the investors' money had gone. By the end of June 2019, complaints had risen to 51,500, a Special Investigation Team had been formed, and SIT raids to the offices of various IMA businesses had recovered in precious stones and metals, with a further in properties attached by the Enforcement Directorate and in an account with HDFC Bank held in confidence under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). Mansoor Khan had deposited in bank accounts, paying in tax under the terms of the PMGKY amnesty. Mansoor Khan claimed on social media that the company actually had had in assets. The total loss to investors was being estimated by police at , with the Enforcement Directorate stating that based upon an analysis of 105 bank accounts related to IMA it believed that Mansoor Khan had received . = Politicians affected = Claims reputedly made by Mansoor Khan on WhatsApp embroiled R. Roshan Baig in the affair, by asserting that Baig had failed to return in money that was intended to fund Baig's political campaign. Mansoor's accusations were vehemently denied by Roshan in a post to Twitter, where he asserted that his only relationship to IMA Group companies was \\"as a legislator\\" and in relation to the work that IMA had done with a school in his constituency. However, a week later Baig was suspended from the Congress Party for what an official party statement described as \\"anti-party activities\\"; with newspaper reports speculating that members of his party had considered the claimed link to IMA being the final straw that tipped the balance against a party member who had been highly critical of the party and its leadership, and who had already threatened to leave it. Other projects connected to Baig were a mushaira and the printing of a newspaper (both discussed further on), and Haj training camps, all funded by IMA. = Schools and hospitals = The school in Baig's constituency was the V.K. Obaidullah School in Shivajinagar, whose future was uncertain immediately following the closure of IMA. It had been partly administered by the company per an agreement with the Karnataka government made in 2015, with the state providing just 15 teachers and IMA paying for 90, at a cost of per annum. Mansoor Khan had previously, in March 2018, threatened to pull IMA's support from the school in another posting to social media. Eleven days after IMA closed, the 92 staff that it (by then) employed stopped turning up to work, prompting the government to transfer state teachers from other schools in order to make up. The government found that none of the IMA-employed primary school teachers had passed the Teachers Eligibility Test, a requirement to be employed by the state as a primary school teacher, and that some of the IMA-employed teachers did not have teaching qualifications. State-employed staff at the school claimed that IMA- employed staff had been employed in return for investing in IMA companies, rather than on the basis of having qualifications (some did not even have a Secondary School Leaving Certificate) and that IMA had operated with the goal of eventually employing all of the teachers at the school. The existing state- funded staff comprised 2 primary school teachers and 11 high school teachers (the numbers employed having risen slightly since 2015), to which were added a further 22 primary school teachers and 2 high school teachers. Policemen were employed to cover for the IMA-employed school watchmen who had also stopped working, and students below primary school level were given a leave of absence. Parents and others did not find this satisfactory. The state-funded schools from which teachers had been transferred found themselves short of teachers; and the transferred teachers could instruct in the Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu languages, but could not teach in English, which is what parents at VKO had signed up for when enrolling their children at the school. Attempts were made to distance Frontline Multispeciality Hospital, located on the Venkataswamy Naidu Road in Shivajinagar, from IMA when the problems surfaced. The IMA name and logo were removed from the sign on the front of the hospital. The hospital reported that it did not have funds to pay for the worth of pharmaceutical supplies that had been delivered to it on credit, and that it was operating with a skeleton of its normal staff of 100 people. At the associated Frontline Pharma chain of pharmacies, stock bought on credit was boxed up and sent back to its suppliers and the company was shut down, as it had no money to continue operating. Employees at Frontline Pharma and in other companies in the group were also hit by the investigating authorities seizing all documents from the human resources department, which included the originals (demanded by the company from employees) of school mark cards, passports, and (in the case of the pharmacists) DPharma certificates. These documents being necessary for future employment elsewhere, police assured them that they would be returned. Many of the employees had also invested in the scheme, but were unable to register their formal complaints with the police alongside other investors out of fear of reprisals, with the police instead setting up a complaints counter especially for IMA employees at another location separate from the counter for investors. = Newspapers = The collapse also affected the Bangalore and Hubli edition of The Siasat Daily, a franchise operated under the banner of the main paper, whose printing IMA had been financing since 2017. The involvement of IMA had seen the Bangalore and Hubli edition change to all-colour and expand to 20 pages, transfer to new and bigger premises, and employ more staff; before, as the company began its collapse in 2018, reducing to 16 pages per issue and, by the time of its last issue on June 10, 12 pages. IMA did not pay full salaries after April 2019, with the final payments the following month excluding all freelance stringers and being limited to enrolled staff only. Funded by IMA, Baig had held a mushaira in the Bangalore Palace in March 2019 to celebrate 20 years of the Bangalore and Hubli edition.

For the war in Libya, the Corps of Engineers established the first regular large-scale use of wireless in the field. The sole precedent ‚Äì but on a more limited scale ‚Äì was that of the German army during the Herero Wars in South West Africa (the present Namibia) in July 1906. Camels transporting wireless equipment The Italian wireless stations became important in the wake of the initial landings, and were used for communications between the fleet and the Corps of Logistics. In charge of the wireless detachment in Tripoli was the then Lieutenant Luigi Sacco, who arrived in Libya on 9 October 1911 a few days after the outbreak of hostilities. On 16 December he was joined in Tripoli by Italian inventor and radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi, who with Sacco and in the presence of the commander of the Italian expeditionary force, General Caneva, conducted a series of tests with Italy using a simple wire aerial laid out on the sand. Marconi's experiments demonstrated the feasibility of a wireless telegraphy network across a desert terrain lacking in infrastructure, as was the case in places such as Libya. During the following months the WT detachment would set up a network that was controlled from a 1.5 kW spark transmitter on the quayside of the Turkish fort at Tripoli. Other stations were set up at Misurate, Sirte, Misda and Beni Ulid. One major problem was how to transport the WT stations across sandy desert tracks. Luigi Sacco was obliged to move the equipment via camels, the only convenient means in such a situation. Using camels, the Corps of Engineers soon set up new wireless stations along tracks that had been secured. Wireless would play an important role and highlight the potential of this new means of communication, also for military purposes. It was a means with potential ‚Äì but also with risks because wireless transmissions can easily be intercepted. With regard to the tests that he carried out with Marconi, Luigi Sacco would write, \\"It is obvious that the enemy can do the same ‚Äì hence the need to always encipher wireless transmissions.\\"Luigi Sacco, Relazione sugli esperimenti compiuti dal comm. Marconi nei giorni 16 e 17 dicembre 1911 a Tripoli, Tripoli 1911. This weakness would only be fully appreciated during World War I, at the start of which only the French and Austrian armies had well organised cipher departments. In Italy it was left to Luigi Sacco to set up the first cipher department at the army high command.

Israeli settlements in the Golan Heights are widely regarded as illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. It will be under the jurisdiction of Golan Regional Council.

It is a type of homophobia in which, despite acceptance of sexual diversity is expressed, prejudices and stereotypes that marginalize or underestimate LGBT people are perpetuated. Liberal homophobia is a practice that is based on understanding relationships and sexuality as private issues and, therefore, accepting individual freedom over them as long as they do not emerge in the public sphere. However, members of the LGBT movement maintain that sexual orientation is an inherently public issue because heterosexuals are not constrained to hide their relationships in public as gay people are. Liberal homophobia is expressed in many areas from which the need to make sexual diversity visible is criticized, such as the LGBT pride parades, awareness campaigns in schools, being out of the closet or having non- heterosexual mannerisms, without taking into account the discrimination that LGBT people face. Authors such as Alberto Mira and Daniel Borrillo consider that this is a type of homophobia that is characterized by the \\"yes, but...\\". Homosexuality is benevolently tolerated, provided it is silenced and heterocentric normality is accepted. Any transgression of that norm is rejected as victimist, ghettoed, activist or proselytizer.

The Homily on the Archangel Uriel ( or 'The Sermon of Urael') is an Ethiopian homiliary containing a collection of miracles and sermons in honour of the Archangel Uriel. The homiliary itself belongs to a larger collection of homilies dedicated to the angels (). It is attested in two G«ù ø«ùz manuscripts, namely the earlier 'short' recension (EMML 1835) and the later 'long' recension (EMML 1841), both preserved in the monastic library of D√§br√§ ·∏§ayq. The earlier one was copied during the reign of Emperor Zara Yaqob (1434‚Äì1468), while the other has been dated to the seventeenth century on palaeographic grounds. The veneration of Uriel seems to have become more popular after Zara Yaqob, the first church in Ethiopia dedicated to him was built by Emperor Na'od (reigned 1494‚Äì1508). The Old Testament apocryphal books, 4 Ezra and 1 Enoch (both are considered canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church), serve as the primary base for the homiliary. In general, it depicts Uriel as one of the great archangels, and as the who has interpreted prophecies to Enoch and Ezra, and the helper of both of them. The homiliary is influential over the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church traditions about the Archangel Uriel, it comprises dozens of homilies and miracles attested in more than thirteen manuscripts. The miracle story of A Miracle of the Archangel Uriel Worked for Abba Giyorgis of Gas«ùƒçÃ£ƒçÃ£a is taken from the . According to the , at the time of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Uriel dipped his wing in the blood and water flowing from Christ's flank and filled a vessel (cup) with it. Carrying the cup, he fled to Ethiopia and sprinkled the blood on many places to sanctify them for building churches. Thus Uriel is often depicted carrying a chalice filled with the blood of Christ in Ethiopian Orthodox iconography.

Wolfer was also co-founder of the prestigious H√©der clan and ancestor of the powerful and infamous K≈ëszegi family, which ruled whole Transdanubia at the peak of its power. Arrival to Hungary According to the Illuminated Chronicle, Wolfer and H√©der belonged to the Counts of Hainburg. Mark of K√°lt's work incorrectly ‚Äì accidentally or intentionally ‚Äì refers to Grand Prince G√©za (c. 972‚Äì997), father of Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary, in fact, Wolfer and H√©der arrived to Hungary during the first regnal years of the minor G√©za II of Hungary (definitely before 1146, when H√©der was already mentioned as isp√°n). The brothers' place of origin is in dispute. Simon of K√©za's Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum writes that Wolfer and H√©der came from \\"Vildonia\\" with forty armored soldiers, referring to Burgruine Wildon in Styria, however the castle itself was built only after 1157 thus that identification is incorrect. Johannes de Thurocz says in his work Chronica Hungarorum that the two knights originated from Hainburg of \\"Alemannia\\", therefore the Duchy of Swabia. Presumably Mark of K√°lt's version is closer to the truth, as there was a certain knight Wolfger von Erlach in the first half of the 12th century in Hainburg. As later the H√©der clan was named after H√©der and not after his elder brother, historian J√°nos Kar√°csonyi argued that H√©der \\"was more talented than Wolfer or lived a very long time [after his brother's death]\\". Life in Hungary Burg G√ºssing, which was built by B√©la III of Hungary on the pedestal of the short-lived and confiscated K√ºsz√©n monastery, established by Wolfer in 1157 Both Wolfer and H√©der became strong confidants of G√©za II, whose reign was characterized by his confrontation with Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, who attempted to extend his influence over the Kingdom of Hungary. Wolfer appeared as a witness in various royal charters of G√©za II issued in the period 1156‚Äì1158, which confirmed his frequent presence in the royal court. Sometime before 1161, Wolfer also negotiated with Eberhard I, Archbishop of Salzburg, who was considered a strong pillar of Pope Alexander III and domestic opposition figure to the Emperor following the controversial 1159 papal election. Through his envoy, Wolfer, King G√©za recommended an alliance and promised protection to Eberhard against Frederick Barbarossa. The narration of the archbishop's letter to the Hungarian king, issued in 1161, confirms that Wolfer was deceased by then. In 1157, Gervasius, Bishop of Gy≈ër contributed and permitted the foundation of the Benedictine Abbey of K√ºsz√©n (later N√©met√∫jv√°r, present-day Burg G√ºssing in Austria), to comes Wolfer, who donated several surrounding lands and vineyards to the monastery. Gervasius subordinated the monastery to the Pannonhalma Abbey and dedicated the new monastery to Virgin Mary. The establishing charter of the K√ºsz√©n Abbey was preserved through a shortened transliteration from 1230, as a result formerly some historians doubted its authenticity. According to historian Rich√°rd Horv√°th, Wolfer did not erect a wooden fort there, contrary to the narrations of the medieval chronicles. The establishing charter also emphasizes the mount of K√ºsz√©n was an \\"uninhabited wasteland\\" before the erection of the abbey. As the founder of the monastery, Wolfer was buried there. However a few decades later, B√©la III of Hungary (r. 1172‚Äì1196) confiscated the Abbey of K√ºsz√©n from the Benedictines and, based on the walls of the abbey, built a royal castle (called N√©met√∫jv√°r, or simply √öjv√°r, \\"New Castle\\", today G√ºssing in Austria) on top of the hill in the late 1170s or early 1180s, because of its significant strategic location along the Imperial border. He compensated its parton, comes Hencse (Wolfer's son) with the patronage of the newly constructed abbey of Kapornak in Zala County. Wolfer's great-grandson was the powerful lord Henry K≈ëszegi, whose family ruled the whole Transdanubia and the northern portion of Slavonia independently of the royal power at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries.

The project began in 1998 but was canceled by Congress in 2000. The Discoverer II concept dates back to June 1996, when the Director of Central Intelligence's Small Satellite Review Panel concluded that: \\"...now is an appropriate time to make a qualitative change in the systems architecture of the nation's reconnaissance assets... We see the opportunity to move towards an operational capability for the country, at least for imagery systems, that consists of an array of smaller, cheaper spacecraft in larger numbers which is at least as useful as those currently planned and to transport them to space with substantially smaller and less costly launch vehicles.\\" The Defense Science Board (DSB) was then asked to establish a Task Force on Satellite Reconnaissance (the so-called \\"Hermann Panel\\") to review all major aspects of such small satellite systems for defence. In its January 1998 report, the Task Force recommended that a modified STARLITE program be initiated, as a \\"Military Space Radar Surveillance Program,\\" in an effort to achieve broad-area, all-weather, near-continuous radar access that could be integrated with military operations. In February 1998 DARPA, the Air Force and the NRO established a joint program to undertake a \\"Space-based Radar Risk Reduction and Demonstration Program\\". The Discoverer II constellation was envisioned to be 24 satellites, each configured with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) radar systems. Each satellite was envisioned to cost approximately $100 million. The constellation would allow for a very rapid revisit rate (about 15 minutes) to most areas of the earth for near-continuous surveillance of terrestrial and maritime vehicles, and could produce Interferometric SAR images for high-resolution terrain mapping. When needed, constellation tasking could be directed by a deployed Joint Task Force tactical commander. On February 22, 1999, three contractor teams were selected, led by Lockheed Martin Astronautics, Spectrum Astro, and TRW Defense Systems Division. After a study phase, the project planned to launch two experimental satellites for demonstration and risk reduction. The project apparently suffered difficulties, and was canceled by Congress in 2000.

The Littlemore Priory scandals took place between 1517 and 1518. They involved accusations of sexual immorality and sometimes brutal violence among the Benedictine nuns and their prioress at St Nicholas' Priory in Littlemore (thus \\"Littlemore Priory\\"), in Oxfordshire, England. The priory was very small and poor, and had a history of troubled relations with its bishops, dating back to the mid-1400s. The scandal that came to light in 1517, however, became enough of a cause c√©l√®bre to contribute to the priory's eventual suppression in 1525. Katherine Wells, the prioress of Littlemore at that time, ran the priory with strict and often violent discipline. She was accused of regularly putting nuns in the stocks for extended periods, as well as physically assaulting them. She also had a baby by the priory's chaplain and had pawned the priory's jewels to pay for the child's upbringing. She entertained men in her parlour, even after the bishop had been made aware of the accusations, which involved heavy drinking. At least one other nun also had a child. On one occasion a number of the nuns broke out of the priory through a window and escaped into the surrounding villages for some weeks. William Atwater, the Bishop of Lincoln, launched an investigation into the rumours of the nuns' irregular lifestyle. Trouble continued, however, and in a subsequent inquiry the bishop heard complaints from both the prioress and the nuns, who made accusations against each other. Wells was summoned to the bishop's court in Lincoln to face charges of corruption and incontinence which eventually led to her being dismissed from office. The end of the affair is unknown, as records have not survived. Historians consider it likely it was behaviour such as was found at Littlemore that encouraged Cardinal Wolsey's suppression of it, and a number of houses, in an attempt to improve the image of the church in England during the early 1520s. Wells, still acting prioress at its closure, received a life pension; the house became a farmstead and was gradually pulled down. One original building remained in the 21st century. Background The Benedictine priory at Littlemore was founded in the 12th century by Robert de Sandford in the latter years of the reign of King Stephen. Always a small house, from around 1245 the priory's history is obscure, going unmentioned in both episcopal and government records. By the later Middle Ages, it was reported that the seven nuns of Littlemore were not living according to their rule. In 1445 the priory was visited by agents of William Alnwick, Bishop of Lincoln. Following their inspection, they reported the nuns failed to fast and ate meat every day. Furthermore, the prioress, Alice Wakeley, regularly received a Cistercian monk and a lay clerk in her rooms to indulge in drinking sessions. There was much local gossip, and it appears to have been common knowledge that the nuns shared beds, apparently because the main dormer was structurally unsafe. The bishop instructed the nuns were to use separate beds, and that no lay persons, \\"especially scholars of Oxford\\", were to be allowed admittance to the priory. By the early years of the 16th century, the congregation had been reduced to a prioress and five nuns; three of these, Elizabeth, Joan and Juliana, were sisters surnamed Wynter. Atwater investigates, 1517 On 17 June 1517 Littlemore Priory was visited by Dr Edmund Horde, a commissary of Bishop William Atwater of Lincoln, accompanied by the episcopal chancellor, Richard Roston. The reasons for his visit are unknown, although Eileen Power suggests that around this time, Atwater \\"had awakened to the moral condition of Littlemore\\". Horde's subsequent comperta, which were presented as findings of fact and were effectively accusations, were comprehensive. Firstly, he suggested the nuns had lied to him on their prioress's orders from the moment he arrived. They had told him all was well,\\"omnia bene\\", within Littlemore; he discovered this was not the case. Investigators such as Horde were expected to be thorough, \\"examining each member of the house, going into the minutest details, and taking great pains to arrive at the truth\\". Horde reported the prioress, Katherine Wells, had had an illegitimate daughter by Richard Hewes, a chaplain from Kent, who was probably responsible for the priory's sacraments. Thomson suggests this had clearly happened some years earlier, but had been either \\"concealed or deliberately overlooked by the authorities\\". The nuns said Hewes still visited two or three times a year and was due again in early August. While he was there, Hewes and Wells lived as a couple, and their child dwelt among the nuns. Horde wrote that Wells, intending her daughter to make a good marriage, had stolen Littlemore's \\"pannes, pottes, candilsticks, basynes, shetts, pellous [and] federe bedds\\" and other furniture from the common store for the girl's dowry. According to the bishop's records, although the nuns pleaded with Wells to give Hewes up, \\"she had answered that she would not do so for anybody, for she loved him and would love him\\". Clandestine sexual relationships were not the sole purview of the prioress; at least one other nun, probably Juliana Wynter, had also had a child by John Wikesley, a married Oxford scholar, two years previously. For their part, the nuns complained to Horde that Wells was a brutal disciplinarian; when they tried to broach the subject with her, she would have them put in the stocks. The historian Valerie G. Spears has suggested Wells was obsessed with discipline; on the one hand this was \\"self-defeating\\", and on the other encouraged by the nuns' servility. The nuns also complained that no effort had been put into maintaining the priory or its buildings, and they pointed out damaged and leaking roofs and walls. Essential outbuildings had been leased by Wells to the priory's secular neighbours, and she had kept the rents herself. They also protested their decrepit clothing, poor and insufficient food and bad ale. Horde discovered the bulk of the priory's foundation wealth, including its jewellery, had been pawned or spent on the prioress's \\"evil life\\". At the same time, the nuns lacked basic necessities, including food and clothing, and could not purchase anything for themselves as the prioress regularly confiscated their stipends. They said Wells sent these funds outside the priory to be distributed among her relatives. They complained her general behaviour also set a bad example: rather than spend her days in contemplation or the administration of the house, she would roam the surrounding countryside with no companion other than a young child from a nearby village. Horde heard that such a state of affairs was damaging recruitment: women who may have been thinking of taking the veil at Littlemore saw the conditions they would be expected to live under and went elsewhere instead. It was claimed on at least one occasion a potential recruit had not only walked out immediately, but had proceeded to advertise the poor state of the priory throughout Oxford. Potential benefactors were also being deterred. The church historian Philip Hughes suggests that nuns demanded that Horde remedy their complaints. They had requested permission to leave the house for another if he could not, possibly out of fear of Wells's expected retribution after he had left. =Visit of the bishop= Littlemore's circumstances appear not to have changed over the next year. On 2September 1518, Atwater visited Littlemore personally. Although he had \\"to bring about some reformation\\" at Littlemore, the bishop was disappointed. On this visit, Wells complained to him that nuns refused to obey her. She reported that Elizabeth Wynter \\"played and romped\\" in the cloister with men from Oxford, and, aided by her sisters, had defied the prioress's attempts to correct her. For example, the prioress explained she had put Elizabeth in the parlour stocks only for three of her colleagues, the two other Wynter sisters and one Anna Wilye, to break the door open and release her. Wells must have locked Wynter in, as her rescuers broke the lock as well. The four of them then set fire to the stocks and barricaded the door against Wells. She summoned aid from neighbours and servants, but before help could arrive, the nuns had broken the window and escaped into a nearby village. There they hid with a sympathetic neighbour, \\"one Inglyshe\\", for some weeks, and were apostastised as a result. They had also been persistently disrespectful during the mass, playing games, chattering and laughing loudly throughout, acting with generally wanton behaviour, \\"even at the elevation\\", despite their supposed obedience to attentiveness and decorum. Wells complained that even though it had been two years since Juliana Wynter had given birth, she had learned nothing of the errors of her ways and still eagerly sought the company of men. The nuns, for their part, complained that the prioress had sold off all their wood and that Hewes had stayed with the prioress for over five months. Worse, after the previous visitation, she had ruthlessly punished those who had spoken the truth about Littlemore to Edmund Horde. Anne Wilye had spent a month in the stocks, and Elizabeth Wynter had been physically beaten in the chapter house and the cloister. The bishop was told, when Wynter eventually returned from the village with her absconding colleagues, how Wells had hit Elizabeth \\"on the head with fists and feet, correcting her in an immoderate way\\", and repeatedly stamped on her. The nuns also claimed that, despite Wells's promises to Atwell, Hewes had continued to visit the prioress since the Horde's visitation. Logan suggests it may have been Elizabeth who had reported Wells to Horde during the 1517 visit and that this was the prioress's revenge. One nun, Juliana Bechamp, who seems to have remained uninvolved in the various troubles, told the bishop that she was \\"ashamed to [be] here [under] the evil ruele [of] my ladye\\". The scandals besetting Littlemore Priory were by then very much public knowledge, and both prioress and nuns had their supporters in the City of Oxford. The historian Peter Marshall has described them as \\"eye-catching\\", and Spears suggests they provided \\"the sensationalist media of the day with profitable copy\\". =Confession of the prioress= A few months following his visit, Bishop Atwater summoned Katherine Wells to his court in Lincoln. She faced numerous charges including incontinence and deliberate immorality. Bowker says the proceedings lasted several days during which she was interrogated by both the bishop and his officials including Dr Peter Potkyn, the episcopal canonist at counsel. At first Wells denied the accusations, but the weight of Horde's evidence forced a confession. She revealed her daughter had died in 1513, and that she had given Richard Hewes some of the priory's silver plate since then, including a silver goblet worth five marks. She claimed to have maintained the same lifestyle for the previous eight years, but that no one had enquired into Littlemore's affairs in all that time. Rather, she said, the priory had had no contact with officialdom except for one occasion when she had received some ecclesiastical injunctions a few years before. On the final day of the hearing, Atwater gathered the evidence and pronounced his judgment. As punishment, Wells was dismissed from her office, although she was permitted to carry out the day-to-day duties the house required until a replacement had been organised. This was on the strict condition that she would do nothing apart from this without Horde's personal authorisation, especially in regard to matters of internal discipline. The historian J. A. F. Thomson has described the situation, specifically the bishop's dismissal of Wells in the knowledge that she would have to be allowed to continue, as demonstrating the \\"inadequacy of visitations as a means of enforcing discipline\\". The medievalist Eileen Power agrees that \\"it shows how inadequate, in some cases, was the episcopal machinery for control and reform\\" of such institutions as Littlemore. She places the blame for Littlemore's condition squarely on Wells's shoulders, with her \\"habitual incontinence [and] persecution of her nuns\\", whom she describes as \\"a particularly bad prioress\\". Power notes that such a situation was far more likely to arise in small, poor houses, which medievalist F. D. Logan suggests were often already \\"struggling for survival\\", than in houses with independent wealth. Spears agrees with Power on Wells's irresponsibility, suggesting that if her nuns subsequently behaved poorly, \\"it would be surprising\\" if this was not the result of observing, learning and copying her behaviour and approach. Spears notes that, as Wells utilised \\"erratic and aggressive\\" discipline, so the nuns seem to have behaved reciprocally towards her. Aftermath Sampson Strong's portrait from c.1610 of Cardinal Wolsey, with Wolsey's new college in the top-left background Historians do not know what, if any, action Atwater took regarding Littlemore following his visit, as subsequent records no longer exist and neither Littlemore or its inhabitants receives further mention in the bishop's Registrum. Nor do we know what, if any, measures Horde took while the priory was in his care. By 1525, the King's chief minister, Cardinal Wolsey, was in the process of founding his new school of humanist education Cardinal College, Oxford. He needed funds for the building. To raise what he needed he requested and acquired a papal bull authorising him to suppress several decayed monasteries of his choice. In Wolsey's eyes, this also had the benefit of helping repair the church's reputation in England, which decadent houses and their inhabitants had helped give it. Littlemore was one of the priories he chose for dissolution. Power argued the condition of the house and its reputation for scandal, on top of Wolsey's wish to expand the University, justified this decision. That Littlemore had proved itself intractable, unable to reform itself or to allow itself to be reformed, probably made it a likely candidate for dissolution, which Margaret Bowker says was \\"the only way to prevent its disobedience spreading\\". Hughes has described Littlemore as being, to Wolsey, simply a house \\"that would never be missed\\". At the time of its closure, Littlemore Priory was worth around ¬£32 per annum.¬£ in 2018. Over the next few years, its lands and revenues were given over to Wolsey's new college. The inhabitants received no further punishment. Indeed, as the last prioress, Katherine Wells was given an annual pension of ¬£6 13s 4d,¬£ in 2018. and those nuns who had been apostatised on account of their misbehaviour were absolved. When Wolsey fell from power in 1529, Littlemore Priory, along with the rest of his wealth and estates, escheated to the crown. Eileen Power has described Littlemore's conditions in the early 16th century as making it \\"one of the worst nunneries for which records survive\\". She suggests it illustrates that although Thomas Cromwell exaggerated the case, there was clearly some basis in recent history for the allegations of decadent institutions and scurrilous behaviour that he used as justification for the wholesale dissolution of the monasteries of 1536‚Äì1539. As for Bishop Atwater, Bowker has suggested that, although he made conscientious efforts to reform recalcitrant houses within his jurisdiction, Littlemore Priory is merely one example of his failure to come to grips with the problem throughout his career. She does argue, though, that Atwater's efforts in this direction anticipated, in a small way, Martin Luther's attempted reforms of the church. The few buildings that made up the priory were soon turned into farmsteads. Only the east range of the Littlemore Priory's cloister survived into the 21st century, and it became a Grade II* listed building in July 1963, when it was being used as a country club. Described by Nikolaus Pevsner's Buildings of England as \\"a rectangular building with a small gabled block\\", this had originally housed the nuns' dormitory on the first floor and the chapter house and prioress's parlour on the ground. It was converted into a pub in the late 20th century, although this was closed in June 2013. The pub's closure presented the opportunity for an archaeological survey of the site. A number of \\"very unusual burials\\" were discovered within the priory's precincts, including one who had likely been a prioress, a body which had received a blunt-force trauma to its head, and a woman who was buried with a baby.

After completing her undergraduate studies at the University of Geneva, she entered medical school at the Free University of Brussels and completed her Doctor of Medicine in 1896 at the University of Paris. She opened a medical practice in France but decided two years later that she preferred research and moved back to Brussels. Operating as an assistant at the Solvay Institute of Physiology, she lectured and conducted research into muscle and nervous system fatigue. Convinced that science could solve societal challenges, Joteyko expanded her research in order to study how science could improve the lives of workers while leading to improvements in industrial efficiency and productivity. This led her to conduct investigations on children, examining how educational facilities could optimize the potential of their students by drawing on scientific methodology. She served as president of the Belgian Neurological Society beginning in 1904 and received numerous awards for her research, including the Desmath Prize of the Imperial and Royal Academy of Brussels, the Dieudonn√©e Prize of the . In addition, she was frequently recognized with prizes by the French Academy of Sciences. In 1916, Joteyko was appointed as the guest chair of the Coll√®ge de France, becoming the first woman to lecture at the institution. Returning to Poland after the establishment of the Second Republic in 1919, Joteyko had difficulty finding full-time employment. She lectured at the National Pedagogical Institute and the National Institute of the Deaf in Warsaw and was later appointed director of the Pedagogical Institute until it was dissolved in 1926. She continued working, lecturing at the and the Free Polish University, as well as serving on the committees of various governmental ministries as an advisor on employment and education. In 1926, she completed her post-doctoral degree at the medical faculty of the University of Warsaw, but illness curtailed her further involvement in research. She is considered to be one of the people who developed the schooling system in Poland. Early life J√≥zefa Franciszka Joteyk√≥wna was born on 29 January 1866 in , Romanov volost of the Skvyra uezd in Kiev Gubernia of the Russian Empire (today village of Pochuiky is located in Popilnia Raion, Zhytomyr Oblast). Her parents were Karolina (n√©e OdrowƒÖ≈º-Kurza≈Ñska) and Lucjan Joteyko. Her family, which included a sister, Zofia, and two brothers Mieczys≈Çaw and , was descended from landowning Lithuanian nobility and members of the Polish intellectual elite. She and her siblings grew up on the large family estate, but to improve their opportunities for education, the family moved to Warsaw in 1873, after leasing the property in Poczujki. Joteyko began her studies with her mother and Madame Perosette, a French tutor. In 1876, the family moved to Smolna Street, near the Sierakowska Boarding School. Joteyko was enrolled there but only attended a for few months because her mother thought the instruction in sciences was inadequate. As the only other schooling option at the time was for Joteyko to attend a government school, which required assimilation of Russian culture, her mother organized private tutoring at home with Polish professors. After seven years of study, Joteyko prepared to take the examination to become a private teacher. Though she spoke four languages and passed her other tests, Joteyko did not pass the Russian language examination. Rather than retake it, she decided to continue her education abroad, as women were banned from studying at the University of Warsaw. Michalina Stefanowska, 1909 Opting to go to Geneva, where her maternal uncle Zygmunt Mi≈Çkowski lived, Joteyko enrolled in the University of Geneva in 1886 to study physical and biological sciences. When she arrived in Switzerland, she cut her hair short, wore tailored dresses with a more masculine style, and was rumored to smoke. She met the former high school teacher, Michalina Stefanowska, with whom she established both a personal and professional relationship. After two years of study, Joteyko graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree and briefly returned to Warsaw. In 1889, she and her family moved to Brussels, where Joteyko entered the Faculty of Medicine of the Free University of Brussels. Her father's illness forced the family to return to Warsaw in 1890. Joteyko did not return with them but instead moved to Paris, where Stefanowska was studying physiology. Within a few months, her father died and the family was threatened with bankruptcy. Joteyko left France briefly and went to Saint Petersburg to take the financial matters in hand. She was able to rescue some of the family capital and with her share, she returned to Paris and rented an apartment with Stefanowska. Enrolling in medical studies under Charles Richet at the University of Paris, Joteyko completed her Doctor of Medicine in 1896, receiving the faculty award for her dissertation \\"La fatigue et la respiration √©l√©mentaire du muscle\\" (Fatigue and elemental muscle respiration). Career =France and Belgium= For the next two years, Joteyko practiced medicine in Paris but found she disliked the routine. In 1898, she accepted an offer to move to Belgium, as an assistant at the Solvay Institute of Physiology. She also lectured on experimental psychology at the Casimir Laboratory of the New University of Brussels. In 1903, she became the director of the Casimir Laboratory and a prot√©g√©e of . She published papers on physiology and her research into the effects of anesthesia by means of ether or chloroform on muscles, nerves, and the nervous system. Joteyko was particularly interested in muscle and central nervous system fatigue and increasingly worked on methods to quantitatively measure fatigue. Her scientific works were recognized with numerous honors, including a joint award in 1900 with Casimir Radzikowski for the Desmath Prize of the Imperial and Royal Academy of Brussels; a co-honor in 1901 with Stefanowska for the Dieudonn√©e Prize of the and with Victor Pachon for the Montyon Prize of the French Academy of Sciences; and in 1903 co-honors with Paul-√âmile Garnier and for the Lallemand Prize of the French Academy of Sciences and the Monyton Prize with Stefanowska and Radzikowski. J√≥zefa Joteyko (seated) and Varia Kipiani, 1910 In 1904, Joteyko became president of the Belgian Neurological Society and chaired the organization's congress in Li√®ge the following year. In 1906, Stefanowska left Paris and returned to Poland, becoming headmistress of a girl's secondary school. Joteyko strongly objected to her partner leaving, but Stefanowska was tired of research and wanted to return to teaching. She convinced Joteyko, whom she referred to as her towarzyszka ≈ºycia (life companion), with the promise that they could write letters and visit each other. Though she continued to research physiology, Joteyko began lecturing on pedagogical psychology at teacher's seminars in Charleroi and Mons. In 1908, she founded and became editor of the Revue Psychologique, a journal which explored developments in the field of psychology from a scientific and educational perspective. Through her work there, she met and began collaborating with a young, Georgian scientist, Varia Kipiani, who served as a secretary to the Revue. The two women carried out joint research on vegetarianism, to which they both adhered and were awarded the 1908 Vernois Prize of the Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine. Joteyko organized summer Paedological Seminars inviting international scholars to participate. Joteyko and Stefanowska published their last joint paper, \\"Psychophysiology of Pain\\", a synthesis of their studies on pain, in 1909. Joteyko, along with social reformers in France and Belgium, believed that science could solve societal issues. She was a staunch feminist and believed that all fields of employment should be open to both men and women. Collaborating with Charles Henry, she sought to use scientific study and instruments to graph social phenomena and draw comparisons with biological data. By measuring and graphing, for example, physical and intellectual fatigue, Joteyko argued that military training would produce better results if limited to six months. In studies on workers, she concluded that industry could improve on efficiency and production, as well as the lives of workers, by evaluating the mental and physical fatigue factors involved in various tasks. She suggested basing pay on the effort required to accomplish a job, as a means of equalizing wages for various tasks, rather than basing pay on factors like gender. These studies led her to investigations on children and how educational facilities could apply scientific methods to improve and optimize the potential of their students. In 1911, Joteyko organized and chaired an international Paedological Congress hosted in Brussels. The following year, she founded and developed the curricula for the International Paedological Faculty of Brussels. Kipiani came to work at the Faculty as a laboratory assistant. Learning of the work Joteyko was doing, Maria Grzegorzewska came to Brussels to study in 1913. Joteyko, who led the Faculty until World War I broke out, became a mentor to Grzegorzewska and was a significant influence on her scientific development. The two women developed a special friendship of mutual admiration and respect for each other and would remain life-long companions. The war interrupted her ability to continue with research and she turned instead to humanitarian work. Though she founded the Committee of Assistance for Poles Residing in Belgium, Joteyko left the country in 1915. She first joined Grzegorzewska in London and the two soon migrated together to Paris. In 1916, Joteyko was appointed as the guest chair of the Coll√®ge de France. Her appointment marked the first time a woman had been allowed to lecture at the 386-year-old institution. Her first lecture was delivered on 24 January 1916. She also began lecturing at the Sorbonne and in 1918 lectured at the University of Lyon. She was awarded the Gagner Prize in 1916 and the Bellion Prize in 1918, both from the French Academy of Sciences; the Vernois Prize of the Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine in 1917 and the Grand Prize Saintour by the Coll√®ge de France in 1918. As many Polish intellectuals and political figures had fled the country to avoid Germanization and Russification programs during the 123 years of the Partitions of Poland, the war offered a chance to Polish nationals to restore their state as an independent nation. These exiled Poles began gathering materials abroad that they would need to develop institutions in an independent Poland. In 1918, she and Grzegorzewska founded the Polish Teaching League (Ligue Polonaise d'Enseignement, Polska Liga Nauczania) with the purpose of helping collect materials on education and teaching methodology. =Return to Poland= Unable to gain full-time employment, in 1919 Joteyko returned to Poland with Grzegorzewska soon after the Second Republic was established. She applied to the University of Warsaw to chair the experimental psychology department, but was rejected. Joteyko believed that the rejection was caused by an aversion to women in Polish scientific circles, as well as the fact that she lived with long-term female partners. Grzegorzewska, who had found employment with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Enlightenment to manage special education development for schools, institutions and educators, helped Joteyko find work as a lecturer at the Pa≈Ñstwowy Instytut Pedagogiczny (National Pedagogical Institute) and in Warsaw. A year later, Joteyko was offered the chair of the General and Pedagogical Psychology Department at the Institute. She brought her private laboratory equipment from Brussels to establish the workshop for the Pedagogical Institute. Using various instruments, she taught her students to measure fine motor skills, rates of reaction to stimuli, and spatial orientation, as well as analyzing psychological results from such examinations as the Binet-Simon intelligence, Otis mental-ability, and Stanford educational tests. In 1921, Joteyko joined the editorial committee of the Rocznik Pedagogiczny (Pedagogical Yearbook) and the following year was appointed as vice-chair of the Pedagogical Commission for the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Enlightenment. At the time, there was no unified educational standard for school systems in Poland and the facilities that existed favored the upper classes. Lobbying for universal education, Joteyko suggested free schooling for impoverished or rural students and a scholarship system for gifted students. In her opinion, no matter their financial situation, pupils needed to be able to learn so that society would benefit from their education and skill. She recommended mandatory schooling for all students until the age of 14 when aptitude tests would be used to determine a university or vocational path. Recognizing that developmental levels varied for students over time, she advocated a second aptitude test at 18. Noting that students attending craft schools tended to be locked into certain trades, she stressed that all teachers should be adequately trained to provide basic education, as well as training in a trade. This would allow vocational students to change the direction of their professional specializations, and thereby create more qualified workers. In her quest to democratize education and dismantle class biases, Joteyko advocated for special education courses and institutions which taught students with disabilities. She pressed for the creation of schools which addressed their particular needs and allowed students to achieve the maximum education under conditions suitable to their mental abilities. She stressed that schools should be secular, believing that religion was a matter of personal preference and its introduction into education limited the development of tolerance and compassion for others. Convinced that schools would benefit from professional counsellors, she insisted that each facility employ a psychologist, both to offer professional guidance and to collect scientific data on students with a view to creating better methods of education. Educational standards were codified in Articles 117‚Äì120 of the Polish constitution of 1921 and were amended in 1926, though her ideas were only marginally accepted by many Polish teachers at the time. From 1922, Joteyko lectured at the , which had been organized by Grzegorzewska. That year, and again in 1926, she chaired the Polish delegation to the International Congress on Moral Education. Beginning in 1924, she served as an editor of the Biuletyn Ko≈Ça Psychologicznego (Psychological Circle Bulletin). In 1926, a year after the Pedagogical Institute closed, she began teaching at the Free Polish University, but was unable to conduct research there as it did not have a laboratory. Joteyko presented her last lecture at the State Institute of Special Education in 1926 and founded the quarterly Polskie Archiwum Psychologii (Polish Archives of Psychology), serving as its editor. The following year she was appointed to serve on a committee of the Economic Ministry and on the Labor Protection Council of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. Also in 1926, she completed her post- doctoral degree in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Warsaw. Death and legacy Joteyko's grave in PowƒÖzki Cemetery. In the late 1920s, Joteyko developed a heart condition which became more serious in 1927. Her companion Grzegorzewska cared for her during her final illness. She died on 24 April 1928 in Warsaw and was buried in the PowƒÖzki Cemetery. Her funeral procession was led by First Marshall J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki. At the time of her death, Joteyko was widely respected for her work, and, along with Marie Curie, was one of the most internationally recognized Polish scientists. She is also remembered as a pioneer in educational reform in Poland. Her pedagogical approach to educational reform recognized that education included care not only of what students were learning, but of their physical and mental well-being, and adequately trained educators who fostered and inspired learning. Joteyko published 262 works and left a collection of research in manuscript form. During her lifetime, she was appointed as a member of the Royal Society of Medical and Natural Sciences of Brussels and the Belgian Neurological Society in 1902, a member of the Association of French Chemists in 1903, and from 1904 a member of the Polish Philosophical Society in Lviv. She became an honorary member of the Accademia di fisica e chimica (Academy of Physics and Chemistry) of Palermo and toward the end of her life served as chair of the Polish Society of Psychotechnics (Polskie Towarzystwo Psychotechniczne). There is an elementary school in Grodzisk Mazowiecki and a middle and high school, in Krak√≥w, which bear her name. Notes References =Citations= =Bibliography=     External links * .

Background =Devolution= =Independence referendum= =Brexit= =Constitutional reform= Establishment The Citizens‚Äô Assembly is one strand of the Scottish Government‚Äôs three-pronged approach to determine constitutional and governance change for Scotland. The others are the establishment of a legal framework providing the option for a referendum through the 'Referendums (Scotland) Bill' and cross-party talks to identify areas of agreement on constitutional change. Principles The Assembly will be conducted according to the following principles: Independence from government: including through the appointment of an impartial and respected convener or co-conveners, an arms-length secretariat, and expert advisory groups. Transparency: at all levels of the operation of the Assembly, from the framing of the questions, to the selection of members and expert witnesses, through to proactive publication and live-streaming of deliberative sessions and clarity about what the outputs will be used for. Inclusion: extending not just to those invited to take part as members, but also to the operations of the Assembly itself. Access: the wider public must be able to see and comment upon the work of the Assembly, and stakeholders must feel that they and their interests have a route into the Assembly. Balance: the information used to build members‚Äô (and the wider public‚Äôs) learning must be balanced, credible and easily understood. Cumulative learning: embedded into the design of the Assembly, to ensure members develop a rich understanding of the issues considered and have time to do so. Open-mindedness: the Assembly will be a forum for open-minded deliberation between participants, ensuring the public see it as a genuine process of enquiry, and to help ensure that it receives an open-minded response from the parliament and government. Format and personnel The assembly will have 120 members who represent a cross-section of Scottish society. The individuals will be broadly representative of Scotland‚Äôs adult population in terms of age, gender, socio-economic class, ethnic group, geography and political attitudes. Members will be identified by early September, with the Assembly meeting on six weekends between the autumn and Spring 2020. MSPs, MPs, MEPs, councillors and members of the House of Lords, political party staff, public appointees and senior public and civil servants will be ineligible to sit on the Assembly, as will representatives and officials of relevant advocacy groups. David Martin, former Member of the European Parliament for Scotland, and Kate Wimpress, from a charity and arts background, took office as co-conveners on 6 August 2019. Criticism The Citizens' Assembly has received criticism with some claiming the initiative is being used as a tool to achieve independence. Pro-independence journalist Neil Mackay has criticised the Scottish Government's approach to the citizens' assembly due to its announcement being alongside planning for a referendum on independence and SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC's comments on the links between a citizens' assembly and its links with independence. Counter to this, Citizens' Assembly Co-convener David Martin said that under his chairmanship, the Citizens' Assembly will remain independent of Government and non-partisan, with the Assembly deciding amongst its members how to approach its remit without interference. Martin also called Cherry's comments 'unhelpful' making the task of establishing the assembly 'ten times harder'. The Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats alongside campaign group Scotland in Union have called for a boycott of the Citizens' Assembly. Scottish Labour have not stated a stance on the citizens' assembly, with Chairman David Martin aiming to establish a non-partisan assembly that will reduce the fears of unionist participants.

The project was resurrected in 1968. Neither version was ever used in a race. The only surviving model is now in the MV Agusta factory museum. 1957 prototype =Background= MV Agusta had won the championship in the 500, 250 and 125 cc classes of the 1956 season. However, the 1957 season promised stiff competition, especially in the premier 500 class, where the Moto Guzzi V8 and the Gilera 500 4C had shown great potential. Undecided whether to go down the road of evolutionary refinement, as Gilera had, or innovation, like the Moto Guzzi, Count Agusta opted for a dual strategy that included the development of the victorious \\"500 4C\\" and, simultaneously, the commissioning of a new multi-cylinder engine that could produce higher revs and therefore outperform the proven four-cylinder. The outline of the project was conceived in the first months of 1956. Sporting director Nello Pagani was in charge of the project, which was carried out with the maximum secrecy. The engine had cylinders and cylinder head made of light alloy was equipped with separate cylinders with cast iron liners. Like the four-cylinder models it featured double overhead camshafts with two valves per cylinder. Six Dell'Orto SS26A carburettors were used. The frame was derived from the \\"500 4C\\": a double cradle in steel tubes, with detachable front tubes to facilitate assembly and maintenance. =350 cc version= The 350 cc was a logical development from the 500 cc version. The machine provided enough power, but this did not outweigh the extra weight. The twin camshaft engine (the camshafts were driven by spur gears between cylinders 3 and 4) had two valves per cylinder. The bore was 44 mm and the stroke 38.25 mm. Six Dell'Orto carburetor supplied the mixture which was ignited from a Lucas magneto. A Double cradle frame was used, the lower tubes of which could be detached for easy removal of the engine. In 1957, the six-cylinder 350 cc was used only once, in practice for the 1957 Grand Prix of Nations in Monza by Nello Pagani. After Moto Guzzi, Gilera and Mondial retired from racing at the end of the 1957 season, the project was shelved. 1968 prototype =Background= The remarkable success of the two-stroke Yamaha twins had greatly impressed Count Agusta who, at the end of the 1967 season, needed to find a counter to the predictable supremacy of Japanese motorcycles in the years to come. Discarding the idea of a two-stroke engine, considered unsuitable for the prestige of the brand, the best solution seemed to him to further split the 4-stroke engine, doubling the number of cylinders the \\"350 3C\\", following the example of the fearsome Honda RC174 with which Mike Hailwood had won the 350 class in the 1967 World Championship. =Development= Taking advantage of the past experience of the \\"350 six cylinder\\", abandoned in the previous decade, the MV technicians quickly prepared a prototype, following the same six-cylinder DOHC, light alloy format, but with a new 4-valve head. The engine now had a 46 mm bore and a 35 mm stroke. To overcome the previous problems due to overheating of the lubricant, a radiator was provided for cooling the oil. The chassis included the best components from specialists, such as the Borrani wheel rims, Ceriani brakes and suspension. Equipped with the 7-speed gearbox and six Dell'Orto SS16 carburettors, the prototype had a dry weight of 149 kg and developed a power of 75 bhp 75 bhp (56 kW) @ 16.000 rpm, giving a top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h). Mike Hailwood rode this bike in 1968 at Monza in testing. The bike was tested in the early months of 1969 by Giacomo Agostini at Modena, who rejected it due to the heavy weight, the difficulty in tuning and, above all, the increased width. Despite the great power, the greater weight and frontal area entailed a noticeable decrease in manoeuvrability and cornering; qualities on which the Bergamo-born champion based his driving style. Agostini's rejection of the prototype and refusal to participate in its development gave the company management serious problem. In other circumstances, as had previously happened, any rider who had refused to follow the instructions of the MV team would have been replaced immediately, but Agostini now drew the favour and admiration of a good part of the sports audience from all over Europe and moreover, he had won six world titles with the MV, some of which were taken from Mike Hailwood and his Hondas. Not being able to fire him and, at the same time, not wanting to abandon the project, the decision was taken to recruit a second driver with good technical knowledge and a decidedly aggressive driving style. Angelo Bergamonti was hired for development of the six-cylinder prototype and to be a teammate to Agostini in the World Championship. In 1970 a single 350 6C bike was built in the motorcycle workshop. It was continuously developed, but was not obtaining the desired results, precisely because of the defects already identified by Agostini who in that year, achieved double success in the 350 and 500 champinships with the \\"tricilindriche\\". Giacomo Agostini tested it again in 1971 while testing in Modena. =Abandonment= The development of the \\"350 6C\\" continued into the first months of 1971, to be finally abandoned after the opening race of the Temporada Romagnola, in which Bergamonti lost his life, and new regulations that limited the maximum number of cylinders to four in the world championship.

Carroll. It provides an overview of psychometric research using factor analysis to study human intelligence. It has proven highly influential in subsequent intelligence research; in 2009, Kevin McGrew described it as a \\"seminal treatise\\". The majority of datasets analyzed in the book were later compiled and made freely available on the Woodcock-Mu√±oz Foundation Human Cognitive Abilities online archive. Content Human Cognitive Abilities is divided into three parts: an introductory background section, a section discussing the different domains of cognitive ability, and a section discussing more general issues related to the study of such abilities, such as the three-stratum theory. Reviews Douglas A. Bors reviewed the book favorably in the Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology, concluding that \\"It undoubtedly is a book that anyone interested in cognitive abilities would wish to explore because of its encyclopedic, in- depth coverage of the topic.\\" In the journal Gifted Child Quarterly, Michael C. Pyryt of the University of Calgary described the book as \\"...a remarkable achievement that should be of interest to everyone in gifted education\\" and \\"an important contribution to the field of individual differences.\\" Neville A. Stanton stated that \\"The work presented...appears to be as exhaustive as it is comprehensive.\\" In another favorable review, Timothy Z. Keith predicted that the book \\"...will become a sourcebook for researchers and an invaluable resource for others interested in human cognitive abilities.\\" Robert B. Burns of the University of California, Riverside praised it as \\"truly a remarkable book\\" and as \\"simply the finest work of research and scholarship I have read\\". Influence According to Schneider & McGrew, Human Cognitive Abilities was the first ever book to present \\"an empirically based taxonomy of human cognitive abilities...in a single, coherent, organized, systematic framework\\". They also described Carroll's book as \\"a much-needed Rosetta stone\\" for future human intelligence researchers. Arthur Jensen referred to the book as Carroll's \\"crowning achievement\\" and \\"a truly monumental work. It was a fulfillment of something that most of us would agree needed to be done, but it seemed too vast an undertaking to imagine how it could ever be done effectively and adequately.\\" In 1998, Carroll himself described the book's publication as \\"the most bracing event of my life\\" over the previous few years.

Biography =Early life= She was likely born around 100 BC to a Patrician family. It has been conjectured among some historians, among them Ronald Syme, that she was likely a sister of Aulus Postumius Albinus and the Postumia who was the mother of Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus. =Marriage= She married Servius Sulpicius Rufus, a famous lawyer. The couple had a son named Servius Sulpicius Rufus together (who would be the father of Sulpicia). Cicero early on identified her as a faithful wife and speaks of her with politeness in some of his leters. None-the less she was identified by Suetonius as one of Caesar's many mistresses. Cicero possibly makes an innuendo towards the affair in one of his leters. Historians Tyrrell and Purser have proposed that Postumia may have been the one who encuraged her son to join in Caesar's army during the Civil War, when his father sides with Pompey. In 49 BC she accompanied her son to a conference with Cicero about her husband's political future. Catullus's poem Postumia has been identified as likely being the Postumia satirized in Catullus 27th poem, where she is portrayed as a drunken hostess of a party. It's possible that Catullus lambasted her as a way to get at her male relatives, or because he knew she was one of Caesar's lovers. Cultural depictions Postumia appears as a frequent character in Robert Harris Cicero trilogy of novels. Her marriage to Rufus and affair with Caesar are featured in the novels to varying extents. She also appears in the Masters of Rome series by Colleen McCullough, in the book Caesar's Women she is brought up as a potental marriage candidate by Caesar, but his mother and other female relatives dismiss her, stating that she is a drunkard and her family is not prominent enough for him to marry into.

The coins were minted in 1776 and examples were made on pewter, brass, and silver planchets.  History  The United States started issuing its own banknotes in 1776 after the start of the American Revolutionary War, denominated in Continental Currency. While no legislation authorizing a dollar coin has been discovered, but no resolutions from July 22, 1776 through September 26, 1778 mentioned the one-dollar banknote, suggesting that it was to have been replaced by a coin. Benjamin Franklin designed both sides of the coin. The obverse features the sun shining on a sundial, the Latin motto \\"Fugio\\" (I flee/fly), and \\"Mind your business\\", a rebus meaning \\"time flies, so mind your business\\". The reverse features 13 chain links representing a plea for the Thirteen Colonies to remain united. = Controversy over coin status = An article in the January 2018 issue of The Numismatist argued that the Continental Currency dollar coin may not have been a coin at all, but a token produced in Great Britain as a souvenir. The article cited the fact that there is no contemporary record of the pieces having been commissioned by the Continental Congress or in the anywhere in the colonies until long after the revolution.  Production  Elisha Gallaudet engraved the coin dies, according to numismatist Eric P. Newman. An estimated 6,000 coins were minted, probably in New York. Today, about a hundred dollars survive, struck in pewter. Historians surmise that much of the original mintage was melted due to wartime demand for the alloy. Only a few silver examples are known to exist. This composition was most likely standard for circulation. However, the idea of a silver dollar might have been scrapped, as the United States had no reliable supply of silver during the war. Several brass trial strikings are also known.  Varieties  As with other early United States coinage, the dies for the Continental dollar coin were hand-punched, meaning no two dies were the same. One of the known obverse varieties was accidentally made with \\"CURRENCY\\" misspelled \\"CURENCY\\". Another variety, known as the \\"Ornamented Date\\", was also made with a misspelled \\"CURRENCY\\", this time as \\"CURRENCEY\\". The blundered die was corrected by punching a \\"Y\\" over the \\"E\\" and an ornamental figure was engraved over the original \\"Y\\".  Later use of the design  The 1787 Fugio cent, the first officially circulated coin of the United States, incorporated many elements of the design of the Continental Currency coin. alt= An adaption of the Continental Currency dollar coin appears on the reverse of the \\"Founding Father\\" variety of the 2006 Benjamin Franklin silver dollar.

Binswanger-Mkhize (born in Kreuzlingen (Switzerland) in 1943, died August 4, 2017) was a Swiss economist.GoogleScholar webpage of Hans P. Binswanger-Mkhize. Retrieved June 16th, 2019. His research focused mainly on agricultural economics in developing countries.  Biography A native of Kreuzlingen, Hans Binswanger studied first at the University of Paris, where he earned a certificate in political sciences in 1964, followed by a MS in agricultural sciences from the ETH Zurich in 1969. In 1973, Binswanger completed his PhD in economics at the North Carolina State University. After his PhD, Binswanger worked at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Hyderabad from 1975 to 1980, during which he also briefly held a position as research associate at Yale University. From 1980 to 2005, Binswanger worked in various positions for the World Bank, before taking up a position as senior fellow at the Amsterdam Institute for Development, which he held until his death. Moreover, Binswanger was professor extraordinarius at the Tshwane University of Technology (South Africa). His research was acknowledged by the American Agricultural Economics Association with a fellowship in 1997, through another fellowship from the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences in 2002 and with the Elmhirst Medal of the International Association of Agricultural Economists in 2006.  Research Binswanger's fields of work combined topics from agricultural economics, development economics, political economy, the economics of technology, and environmental economics. In terms of research output, he ranked among the top 3% of economists registered on IDEAS/RePEc.Hans Binswanger-Mkhize is ranked 1693rd among 56171 researchers registered on IDEAS RePEc. Retrieved June 16th, 2019. = Economics of Technical Change and Its Impacts, and Agricultural Mechanization= A key area of Binswanger's research has been the economics of technical change in agriculture, in particular agricultural mechanization, and its impacts. In an early study of technical change in U.S. agriculture in 1912‚Äì68, Binswanger shows that the adoption of innovations is induced by changes in relative factor prices, although these changes have to be very large.Binswanger, H.P. (1974). The measurement of technical change biases with many factors of production. American Economic Review, pp. 964‚Äì976. This concept of induced innovation and its relationship with technology, institutions and development is further explored in 1978 in an eponymous book co-authored with Vernon W. Ruttan.Binswanger, H.P., Ruttan, V.W. (1978). Induced innovation: Technology, Institutions, and Development. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. In the 1970s and 1980s, Binswanger also conducted research on agricultural mechanization. For instance, summarizing the literature on the economics of tractors in India, Pakistan and Nepal, Binswanger argues that surveys of tractor use fail to find statistically significant impacts on growth in yields, timeliness or gross farm returns, and ‚Äì at least until the 1980s ‚Äì tractors failed to support South Asian agricultural growth.Binswanger, H.P. (1978). The economics of tractors in South Asia. International Crops Research Institute for the Semi- Arid Tropics. Reviewing historical patterns of agricultural mechanization, Binswanger shows that in both developed and developing countries power- intensive processes were mechanized first, followed by control-intensive operations, with small manufacturers (and not the public sector or corporate research) typically initiating the process of inventing new types of machinery.Binswanger, H. (1986). Agricultural mechanization: a comparative historical perspective. World Bank Research Observer, 1(1), pp. 27‚Äì56. Together with Prabdhu Pingali and Yves Bigot, Binswanger also investigated patterns of agricultural mechanization and the evolution of farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting that many technological failures were due to mismatches between technological strategies, farming systems and countries endowments of land, labour and climate.Pingali, P., Bigot, Y., Binswanger, H.P. (1987). Agricultural mechanization and the evolution of farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.Binswanger, H., Pingali, P. (1988). Technological priorities for farming in sub-Saharan Africa. World Bank Research Observer, 3(1), pp. 81‚Äì98. Overall, reviewing the effect of technical change and commercialization in agriculture on the poor until the late 1980s, Binswanger concluded that these dynamics stimulate growth in agriculture, rural development and food supply, though these don't generally lend themselves to poverty targeting.Binswanger, H.P., Braun, J. (1991). Technological change and commercialization in agriculture: the effect on the poor. World Bank Research Observer, 6(1), pp. 57‚Äì80. = Economic Behaviour under Risk and Uncertainty= In the 1980s, Binswanger turned to the study of economic behaviour in agriculture under risk and uncertainty. Through an experiment in rural India, he notably found large discrepancies between experimental measures of risk aversion and certainty equivalents elicited through interviews, with the experimental measures suggesting that, for high payoffs, nearly everybody was moderately risk averse, with even wealthy individuals not significantly less risk averse; more specifically, Binswanger observed decreasing absolute risk aversion, increasing partial risk aversion, declining relative risk aversion, and asset disaggregation.Binswanger, H.P. (1980). Attitudes towards risk: Experimental measurement in rural India. American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 62(3), pp. 395‚Äì407.Binswanger, H.P. (1981). Attitudes towards risk: Theoretical implications of an experiment in rural India. Economic Journal, 91(364), pp. 867‚Äì890. Summarizing the literature on risk aversion and farmers' credit constraints, Binswanger and Donald Sillers find that farmers in developing countries are almost universally risk averse and show why many lenders would ask rural borrowers for collateral, giving credence to the view that small farmers may be at a disadvantage because of credit constraints.Binswanger, H.P., Sillers, D.A. (1983). Risk aversion and credit constraints in farmers' decision-making: A reinterpretation. Journal of Development Studies, 20(1), pp. 5‚Äì21. Finally, Binswanger and Mark Rosenzweig document how farmers adapt the composition of their agricultural investments in response to the exposure of the profitability of their agricultural activities to weather risk.Rosenzweig, M.R., Binswanger, H.P. (1993). Wealth, weather risk, and the composition and profitability of agricultural investments. Economic Journal, 103(416), pp. 56‚Äì78. = Agricultural Production Relations and Econometric Studies= Many of Binswanger's studies of agricultural dynamics are econometric, with early works including e.g. the measurement of elastcities of factor demand and substitutionBinswanger, H.P. (1974). A cost function approach to the measurement of elasticities of factor demand and elasticities of substitution. American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 56(2), pp. 377‚Äì386. and a microeconomic approach to induced innovation.Binswanger, H.P. (1974). A microeconomic approach to induced innovation. Economic Journal, 84(336), pp. 940‚Äì958. In a study with Maw-Cheng Yang, Alan Bowers and Yair Mundlak on the determinants of cross-country aggregate agricultural supply, Binswanger finds only weak short-run supply elasticities within countries.Binswanger, H. et al. (1987). On the determinants of cross-country aggregate agricultural supply. Journal of Econometrics, 36(1‚Äì2), pp. 111‚Äì131. Further work of Binswanger has investigated the policy response of agriculture, highlighting agriculture's low price short-run price elasticity, the role of investments in infrastructure, institutions and public goods, and the effects of structural adjustment programmes.Binswanger, H. (1989). The policy response of agriculture. World Bank Economic Review, 3(Supp. 1), pp. 234‚Äì262. Last, Binswanger, Rosenzweig and Shahidur Khandker describe how the availability of education infrastructure and rural banks co-determine agricultural investment and agricultural output's price responsiveness, with public infrastructure investments in turn being determined by agroclimatic potential and bank locations being influenced by public infrastructure investments.Binswanger, H.P., Khandker, S.R., Rosenzweig, M.R. (1993). How infrastructure and financial institutions affect agricultural output and investment in India. Journal of Development Economics, 41(2), pp. 337‚Äì366. With Rosenzweig, Binswanger has developed an influential model of agricultural production and its behavioural and material determinants that facilitates the analysis of barriers to the emergence of rural financial markets and efficient agricultural factor markets, along further implications.Binswanger, H.P., Rosenzweig, M.R. (1986). Behavioural and material determinants of production relations in agriculture. Journal of Development Studies, 22(3), pp. 503‚Äì539. By contrast, earlier work of Binswanger and Rosenzweig addresses contractual arrangements, employment and wages in rural labour markets. Binswanger, H.P., Rosenzweig, M.R. (1981). Contractual arrangements, employment and wages in rural labor markets: A critical review. New York: Agricultural Development Council. Another major contribution of Binswanger's research ‚Äì together with Klaus Deininger and Gershon Feder ‚Äì is an analysis of the power relationships governing rental and sales markets for agricultural land in developing countries and their impacts on policy distortions, revolts and reforms.Binswanger, H.P., Deininger, K., Feder, G. (1995). Power, distortions, revolt and reform in agricultural land relations. In: Behrman, J., Srinivasan, T.N. (eds.). Handbook of Development Economics, vol. 3. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 2659‚Äì2772. = Environment, Natural Resource Management and Policies= In the 1990s, Binswanger's research turned increasingly towards environmental topics. For instance, he showed that general tax policies, special tax incentives, the rules of land allocation and the agricultural credit system in Brazil all contributed to the acceleration of deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, increasing in the process the size of land holdings and reducing the chances of the poor to become farmers.Binswanger, H.P. (1991). Brazilian policies that encourage deforestation in the Amazon. World Development, 19(7), pp. 821‚Äì829. Turning to water rights, Binswanger (together with Mark Rosegrant) makes the case for tradable water rights as a means to formalize and secure the water rights held by water users, reduce transaction costs and induce the internalization of opportunity costs and negative externalities (e.g. due to irrigation).Rosegrant, M.W., Binswanger, H.P. (1994). Markets in tradable water rights: potential for efficiency gains in developing country water resource allocation. World Development, 22(11), pp. 1613‚Äì1625. Addressing the relationship between natural resource degradation and population growth in Colombia, Binswanger (with Jon Heath) argues that rather than being population-driven, natural resource degradation is mainly driven by policies that constrain poor people's access to land.Heath, J., Binswanger, H. (1996). Natural resource degradation effects of poverty and population growth are largely policy-induced: the case of Colombia. Environment and Development Economics, 1(1), pp. 65‚Äì84. = Land Policy and Land Reform= Since the mid-1990s, Binswanger has also extensively written about land policy and land reform. Studying South Africa's case, Binswanger and Deininger argue that the dualistic structure of its farm structure ‚Äì a few very large, highly productive farms often owned by Afrikaner and many relatively small farms owned by native Africans ‚Äì cannot be explained due to economies of scale in the commercial sector, but is instead due to systematic historical distortions in land allocation, output markets, and access to infrastructure, rural finance and public services;Binswanger, H.P., Deininger, K. (1993). South African land policy: The legacy of history and current options. World Development, 21(9), pp. 1451‚Äì1475. the topic of land reform in South Africa is further explored with regard to policies, markets and mechanisms with Johan van Zyl and Johann Kirsten.Van Zyl, J., Kirsten, J., Binswanger, H.P. (1996). Agricultural land reform in South Africa: Policies, markets and mechanisms. Oxford: Oxford University Press. At the turn of the century, Binswanger and Deininger examine the evolution of the World Bank's land policy, highlighting (i) the desirability of owner-operated family farms, (ii) the need for markets permitting land transfers to more productive users, and (iii) an egalitarian asset distribution. To this, they add the relative cost effectiveness of communal tenure systems, the assessment of titling programms based on efficiency and equity, the potential of land rental markets, the integration of the development of land-sale markets into broader rural development initiatives, the success of decentralized and market-oriented approaches to land reform, and the need for adaptation to local conditions.Deininger, K., Binswanger, H. (1999). The evolution of the World Bank's land policy: principles, experiences, and future challenges. World Bank Research Observer, 14(2), pp. 247‚Äì276.Van den Brink, R. et al. (2005). Consensus, confusion, and controversy: selected land reform issues in sub-Saharan Africa. Washington, D.C.: World Bank. = Rural Finance= In a study by Binswanger and Khandker, both argue that the impact of credit expansion on agricultural output in India has been insubstantial, with the programme having a positive return on investment only under very optimistic assumptions.Binswanger, H.P., Khandker, S.R. (1978). The impact of formal finance on the rural economy of India. Journal of Development Studies, 32(2), pp. 234‚Äì262. More recently, Binswanger- Mkhize has argued on the subject of weather index-based agricultural insurance that its prospects for upscaling are poor, given that better-off farmers tend to already be insured through income diversification and social networks, whereas poor farmers are too cash constrained to afford the premia for an insurance that will pay out at earliest after harvest. Binswanger-Mkhize, H.P. (2012). Is there too much hype about index-based agricultural insurance? Journal of Development Studies, 48(2), pp. 187‚Äì200.

She was known for her work in finite geometry and for her books aimed at young mathematicians. Early life and education Cofman was born on 4 June 1936 to a prominent ethnically German but Hungarian-speaking family (variously spelled Cofman or Zoffmann) in Vr≈°ac, then in Yugoslavia and now part of Serbia. Her father was a brewer, but the family brewery (founded in 1859) was closed by the occupying Germans in World War II and then nationalized by the newly- established communist government of Yugoslavia in 1946. Her grandfather was a mathematics teacher, and her uncle was the town mayor. Growing up in Vr≈°ac, Cofman learned Hungarian, Serbian, German, Russian, English, and later French and Italian; her facility with languages became useful for her mathematics studies. In 1954, she joined the first cohort of mathematics students in the Faculty of Philosophy in Novi Sad, now part of the University of Novi Sad. She finished her studies there in 1958 and became a high school mathematics teacher in Zrenjanin. She returned to Novi Sad (newly founded as a university) in 1960, as an assistant to geometer Mileva Prvanoviƒá and in the same year was responsible for the university's first mathematics publication, of her lecture notes on straightedge and compass constructions. She traveled to Rome in 1961 to work with Lucio Lombardo-Radice then, returning to Novi Sad in 1963, defended her Ph.D., the first mathematical doctorate at Novi Sad. Her dissertation was O konaƒçnim nedezargovim ravnima generisanim ƒçetvorotemenikom [Finite Non-Desarguesian Planes Generated by Quadrangles]. Career After completing her doctorate, Cofman did postdoctoral research as a Humboldt Fellow at Goethe University Frankfurt. She became a lecturer at Imperial College London in 1965 and then, after a year visiting the University of Perugia, took a position at the University of T√ºbingen in Germany. In the mid-1970s she moved to Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, at a time when her interests began to shift as well, from finite geometry to mathematics education. At Mainz, she became the doctoral advisor of mathematics popularizer Albrecht Beutelspacher, through whom she has many academic descendants. She left the university in 1978, and became a mathematics teacher at Putney High School in London from 1978 to 1993. It was during this time that she wrote her books for young mathematicians.

It was created by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in 2008 and have become a collaborative project between the NHGRI and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) since 2010. As of September 2018, it has included 71,673 SNP‚Äìtrait associations in 3,567 publications. A GWAS identifies genetic loci associated with common traits and disease through the analysis of categorized variants across the genome and the catalog provides information from all published GWAS results that meet its criteria. The catalog contains publication information, study groups information (origin, size) and SNP- disease association information (including SNP identifier, P-value, gene and risk allele). Over the years, the GWAS catalog has enhanced its data release frequency by adding features such as graphical user interface, ontology- supported search functionality and a curation interface. The GWAS catalog is widely used to identify causal variants and understand disease mechanisms by biologists, bioinformaticians and other researchers. Some GWAS identified common genomic loci that are associated diseases include: cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes and breast cancer.  Accessibility of data  The public can gain access to the GWAS Catalog‚Äô s data in three ways: # The NHGRI web interface‚Äôs search: provide information on traits and study publication and an tab-delimited file that is available for download. # Interactive interface: provide a visualization of all SNP- associated traits in the GWAS catalog as well as SNPs‚Äô positions on human chromosomes. And all SNPs are associated with a particular trait are displayed with web links to related literature from different databases. # Ensembl, the UCSC Genome Browser, the PheGenI and other data portals provide access to the GWAS catalog through providing web links.  Applications  Some current applications of the GWAS Catalog include the use of studies on the genetics of human diseases and the heritability of human traits. The GWAS catalog data can also be used as a pool of markers for SNP studies.

Toklas by English biographer Diana Souhami. Overview Gertrude & Alice opens with a brief portrait of the relationship between Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. Souhami devotes two chapters, respectively, to the early years of Gertrude Stein and the early years of Alice B. Toklas. The book then moves to a chapter on Stein's \\"first love,\\" for a fellow student named May Bookstaver, a Bryn Mawr College graduate whom Stein met while studying in the medical school at Johns Hopkins University. The book covers Stein's move to Paris with her brother Leo, where they established a household on the Rue de Fleurus. A chapter is devoted to the meeting of Stein and Toklas, another to the establishment of a partnership between them, and a third to their \\"marriage.\\" Other chapters cover their experience of World War I, the famous men and women they associated with, their country house in Bilignin, France, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, Stein and Toklas's tour of America, their experiences of World War II, their experiences after the war ended, and Toklas's life after Stein's death. The book contains 43 black-and-white illustrations. Reception Souhami's book received mixed reviews in the press. Among the more laudatory reviews, Nolan Miller and Gerda Oldham wrote in The Antioch Review, \\"[a]lthough Souhami writes with no personal knowledge of the protagonists, she has managed to compose (from letters, memoirs, and the published works of both) an intimate portrait of two forceful and distinctive women who met in Paris in 1907 and lived together until Gertrude Stein died in 1946.... Altogether, this delightful compilation makes a coherent story.\\" An unsigned review in The Woman's Art Journal was similarly positive: \\"Diana Souhami has mined both archival and published material on the relationship between Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas.... Souhami writes entertainingly about their patronage of young, avant-garde artists, the development of their art collection, and their legendary salons, which were central to Paris's cultural life for almost 40 years.\\" Kirkus Reviews wrote that \\"the odd, legendary, and passionate collaboration between Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas is eyed with detailed objectivity by London critic Souhami ... Souhami's nonjudgmental (sometimes witty) reporting serves the reader well by scrutinizing this idiosyncratic pairing in all aspects, appealing and not.\\" Two scholarly reviewers, Linda Wagner-Martin and Anne Charles, were less impressed with the book. Linda Wagner-Martin in American Literature complained that \\"[o]ne of the problems with the book is that her focus on the two makes them exactly that‚Äîcollege-educated, upper-class Jewish women, products of turn-of-the-century social and moral patterns. It unfortunately omits Gertrude's claim to gloire, her writing and‚Äîperhaps in some ways as interesting‚Äîher philosophy of twentieth-century art and letters. When Souhami, herself a British novelist, announces in her preface that she is not concerned with Stein's writing, the reader is forced to wonder why the book was written. Anne Charles in the NWSA Journal lamented the way the book was documented and written: \\"The fact that Souhami's aim is emphatically not academic is clearly conveyed at the end of her brief preliminary remarks when she explains her often incomplete and confusing documentation system as an effort 'to avoid cluttering the text with footnotes.' In addition, Souhami's sometimes infelicitous descriptive displays are illustrated early as she encapsulates Stein and Toklas, in part, as 'two odd-looking ... women.'\\" See also * The Autobiography of Alice B.

Classical mechanics For the simple case of single particle with mass m moving along one dimension x and acted upon by forces F_i, the program of classical mechanics is to determine the state x:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} by solving Newton's second law, :m\\\\,x(t) = \\\\sum_i F_i, for x(t) given sufficient initial conditions for a second order ordinary differential equation, typically x(0),x'(0)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. If these forces are conservative, Newton's law becomes :m\\\\,x(t) = \\\\sum_i -\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}U_i(x)}{\\\\mathrm{d}x}. In 3 spatial dimensions, the state \\\\mathbf{x}:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^3 is determined by solving Newton's second law, :m\\\\,\\\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\\\sum_i \\\\mathbf{F}_i, for \\\\mathbf{x}(t) with corresponding initial conditions, typically \\\\mathbf{x}(0),\\\\mathbf{x}'(0)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^3. For a system of N particles, Newton's law applies to each particle, constraining an aggregate state \\\\mathbf{x}:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{3N}. Exact solutions exist for many systems of interest, and numerical methods exist for and have been applied to large systems including the pre-solar nebula and planetary atmospheres. =Reformulations= In Lagrangian mechanics for the same system, the state \\\\mathbf{q}:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{3N} solves Hamilton's principle \\\\frac{\\\\delta S}{\\\\delta\\\\mathbf{q}(t)}=0 where the action functional is defined as :S[\\\\mathbf{q}] \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(\\\\mathbf{q}(t),\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}}(t),t)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}t. In Hamiltonian mechanics with canonical coordinates (\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\mathbf{p}) and Hamiltonian function \\\\mathcal{H}(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\mathbf{p},t), the state \\\\mathbf{q}:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{3N} is determined by solving :\\\\mathbf{q}'(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{p}}\\\\quad,\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{p}'(t) = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{q}}\\\\quad,\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial t} . Quantum mechanics For a single particle with mass m constrained to the x-axis and subject to a scalar potential U(x,t), the program of quantum mechanics is to determine the wave function \\\\psi:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to L_{2}(\\\\mathbb{R}^{1},\\\\mathbb{C}) where \\\\psi(x,t) solves the Schr√∂dinger equation, :i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\psi(x,t) = \\\\left [ \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2} + U(x,t)\\\\right ] \\\\psi(x,t) given particular initial conditions, for example \\\\psi(x,0) in L_{2}(\\\\mathbb{R}^{1},\\\\mathbb{C}). Here, L_{2}(X,E) indicates the L2 subspace or \\"square-integrable\\" subspace of the function space f:X\\\\to E. In three dimensions with scalar potential U(\\\\mathbf{x},t), the state \\\\psi:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to L_{2}(\\\\mathbb{R}^{3},\\\\mathbb{C}) solves the Schr√∂dinger equation, :i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\left [ \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + U(\\\\mathbf{x},t)\\\\right ] \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x},t) for corresponding initial conditions, for example \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x},0) in L_{2}(\\\\mathbb{R}^{3},\\\\mathbb{C}). Strictly speaking, the space of physically distinct pure states is not the aforementioned L2 complex space but rather rays in the projective Hilbert space, which itself stems from the representation theory of C*-algebras. Exact solutions have been found for simple systems like the Hydrogen atom, notably excluding Helium and more complex atoms, while numerical methods exist and have been applied at the molecular level. =Classical limit= The values of the position-space wave function above are the coordinates of the state vector in the position eigenbasis, expressed as \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\langle\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\psi(t)\\\\rangle. The time evolution of the state vector is generated by the Hamiltonian operator \\\\hat{H}, yielding the general Schr√∂dinger equation i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\psi(t)\\\\rangle = \\\\hat{H} \\\\psi(t)\\\\rangle, whose formal solution is the unitary time translation operator \\\\hat{U}(t), :\\\\psi(t)\\\\rangle = \\\\hat{U}(t)\\\\psi(0)\\\\rangle = e^{-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{H}t}\\\\psi(0)\\\\rangle. Expanding the following transition amplitude yields a path integral, taken over all paths \\\\mathbf{y}:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^3 from \\\\mathbf{y}(t_1)=\\\\mathbf{x}_1 to \\\\mathbf{y}(t_2)=\\\\mathbf{x}_2, :\\\\langle\\\\mathbf{x}_2\\\\hat{U}(t_2-t_1)\\\\mathbf{x}_1\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\mathbf{x}_2e^{-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{H}(t_2-t_1)}\\\\mathbf{x}_1\\\\rangle = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{y}(t_1)=\\\\mathbf{x_1}}^{\\\\mathbf{y}(t_2)=\\\\mathbf{x}_2} e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\mathbf{y}]} \\\\,\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{y}, and convolving this with an initial wave function yields the Lagrangian formulation of quantum mechanics, the path integral formulation, :\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}_2, t_2) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{x}_1} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{y}(t_1)=\\\\mathbf{x_1}}^{\\\\mathbf{y}(t_2)=\\\\mathbf{x}_2} e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\mathbf{y}]} \\\\,\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\,\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}_1,t_1) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{x}_1. In the limit \\\\hbar\\\\to 0 (i.e. as \\\\hbar/m c becomes infinitely smaller than the length scale of interest), the relative contribution of the path \\\\mathbf{y} that solves the classical equations of motion becomes infinite, and consequently \\\\hat{U}(t) will transport a decohered wave packet localized at \\\\mathbf{x}_1 (e.g. \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x},t_1)\\\\approx\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}_1)) along its classical path with no quantum effects, generating Hamilton's principle and the program of classical mechanics above. Quantum field theory For a field in d spatial dimensions with mass m and value in V, the program of quantum field theory is in theory to obtain the wave functional \\\\Psi : \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to L_{2}(\\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\to V,\\\\mathbb{C}) that solves i\\\\hbar\\\\partial_0\\\\Psi[\\\\phi(\\\\cdot),t] = \\\\hat{H} \\\\Psi[\\\\phi(\\\\cdot),t] with :\\\\hat{H} = \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^d x \\\\left[ \\\\partial_0\\\\hat{\\\\phi}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\hat{\\\\pi}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - \\\\mathcal{L}[\\\\hat{\\\\phi},\\\\mathbf{\\\\partial}\\\\hat{\\\\phi}] \\\\right] given suitable initial conditions, hypothetically \\\\Psi[\\\\phi(\\\\cdot),0]:L_{2}(\\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\to V,\\\\mathbb{C}). However, finding an exact solution exceeds current mathematical capabilities for all cases except free particle propagation. In practice, calculations consist of determining scattering amplitudes with perturbative approximations or of numerically approximating corresponding lattice field theories. =Classical limit= The values of the wave functional exist in the field operator's basis as \\\\Psi[\\\\phi(\\\\cdot),t]=\\\\langle\\\\phi(\\\\cdot)\\\\Psi(t)\\\\rangle, where the state obeys i\\\\hbar\\\\partial_0\\\\Psi(t)\\\\rangle=\\\\hat{H}\\\\Psi(t)\\\\rangle. Expanding the formal solution yields a path integral, taken over every field path \\\\chi:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to V^{\\\\mathbb{R}^d} from \\\\chi(t_1)=\\\\phi_1 to \\\\chi(t_2)=\\\\phi_2, :\\\\langle\\\\phi_2e^{-i\\\\hat{H}(t_2-t_1)/\\\\hbar}\\\\phi_1\\\\rangle = \\\\int_{\\\\chi(t_1)=\\\\phi_1}^{\\\\chi(t_2)=\\\\phi_2} e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\mathbf{\\\\chi}]} \\\\,\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{\\\\chi} and convolving this with an initial wave functional yields :\\\\Psi[\\\\phi_2,t_2] = \\\\int_{\\\\phi_1} \\\\int_{\\\\chi(t_1)=\\\\phi_1}^{\\\\chi(t_2)=\\\\phi_2} e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\mathcal{S}[\\\\mathbf{\\\\chi}]} \\\\,\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{\\\\chi} \\\\,\\\\Psi[\\\\phi_1,t_1] \\\\,\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\phi_1. In the limit \\\\hbar\\\\to 0, the relative contribution of the field path \\\\chi that solves the classical equations of field motion dominates, and covariant classical field theory is recovered. =Non-relativistic limit= Every free quantum field \\\\hat{\\\\phi} can be decomposed in terms of its annihilation operators as :\\\\hat\\\\phi(x)=\\\\hat a(x)+\\\\hat b^\\\\dagger(x)=\\\\int \\\\frac{d^3p}{(2\\\\pi)^3} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\hbar\\\\omega_\\\\mathbf{p}}} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\hat{a}_\\\\mathbf{p}e^{-i p\\\\cdot x/\\\\hbar}+\\\\hat{b}_\\\\mathbf{p}e^{-i p\\\\cdot x/\\\\hbar}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where the momentum space annihilation operators are integrated to yield the operator-valued distributions \\\\hat{a}(x) and \\\\hat{b}(x), and the energy-momentum relation gives (\\\\hbar\\\\omega_\\\\mathbf{p})^2=E^2=\\\\left(m c^2\\\\right)^2+(pc)^2. In the non- relativistic limit c\\\\to\\\\infty, this becomes \\\\hbar\\\\omega_\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\approx E\\\\approx m c^2 and the phase e^{-i\\\\omega_\\\\mathbf{p}t} and measure (2\\\\hbar\\\\omega_\\\\mathbf{p})^{-1/2} factor out, yielding :\\\\hat{a}(x)\\\\to\\\\frac{e^{-i m c^2 t/\\\\hbar}}{\\\\sqrt{2mc^2}}\\\\hat{A}(x),\\\\quad \\\\hat{b}(x)\\\\to\\\\frac{e^{-i m c^2 t/\\\\hbar}}{\\\\sqrt{2mc^2}}\\\\hat{B}(x). Consequently the field's Lagrangian L = (\\\\hbar c)^2\\\\partial_a\\\\phi\\\\partial^a\\\\phi^\\\\dagger - (mc^2)^2\\\\phi\\\\phi^\\\\dagger reduces to :L = \\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger(i\\\\hbar\\\\partial_t + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 abla^2}{2m})\\\\hat{A} + \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger(i\\\\hbar\\\\partial_t + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 abla^2}{2m})\\\\hat{B} + \\\\text{h.c.} as the annihilation operators dissociate and behave as two separate Schr√∂dinger fields (representing the particle and anti-particle), whose occupied states each independently obey the Schr√∂dinger equation and yield the program of particulate quantum mechanics above. Other routes Other routes may encounter issues in defining localized particle states. In the Heisenberg picture and the non-relativistic limit, e^{i m c^2 t/\\\\hbar}\\\\langle\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\hat{\\\\phi}(x)0\\\\rangle (with \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\rangle a one-particle state with momentum \\\\mathbf{k}) is often identified with a momentum space wave function, but this cannot be localized. When attempting to reduce a relativistic quantum mechanics to non-relativistic quantum mechanics, although the Hamiltonian H=(\\\\mathbf{p}^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4)^{1/2} yields the Newton-Wigner propagator and defines a Lorentz scalar \\\\psi, unfortunately this propagator is not Lorentz invariant.

It is loosely based upon the battle of Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi on Ganry≈´-jima island against Sasaki Kojir≈ç, who is also known as Sasaki Ganry≈´, hence the reasons for the abbreviated name of the game. In the game, players assume the role of either Musashi or Suzume on a journey to defeat a resurrected Kojir≈ç and his legion of evil ninjas and monsters terrorizing Kyoto.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot showcasing Yasha-hime, the first boss of the game. Ganryu is a side-scrolling hack and slash action-platform game similar to Shinobi and Strider where the players take control of either Miyamoto Musashi or Suzume through five stages set in Japan, where the main objective is to rescue Otsu from an evil clan of ninja servants led by a resurrected Sasaki Kojir≈ç, the main antagonist of the game, alongside with one of his creations that act as a boss at the end of the stage in order to progress further through the game. Each of the two playable characters have their own advantages and disadvantages that comes into effect during gameplay, with Musashi being the strongest but least agile while Suzume is the most versatile but least strongest respectively. In addition to the regular single-player campaign, there is also an alternating two player mode, where two people can play through the game by taking turns after one of the players die. All of the levels featured in the game, although linear in nature, are large and populated with obstacles and enemies which involve the players on traversing them by jumping and running while slashing and dodging enemies that roam around the playfield. The stages also feature multiple hidden rooms and routes to explore, encouraging the player with exploring them in order to find hostages that grants various rewards for the effort, such as onigiri or takoyaki which restores health, or ry≈ç currency to receive extra points. Items and additional sub-weapons are also scattered in treasure chests across the stage to be collected. If players sustain too much damage, their player character is killed after the health bar is completely depleted and respawns on a checkpoint location but once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. If a memory card is present, the players are allowed to save their progress and resume into the last stage the game saved at. Controlling the characters is done with a joystick, which moves them left and right. Attacking enemies is performed by pressing the A button, while B makes the character jump and C activates a grappling hook that allow players to pull forward, swing onto the latched object as well as attack enemies at a distance. Players can also perform a jump kick move with the B button that not only attack enemies, but allows their character to climb walls. By holding A, players can unleash a powerful attack against enemies after charging, however, it leaves them exposed to enemy attack.

On April 14, 1612, Miyamoto Musashi fought a duel against fencer Sasaki \\"Ganry≈´\\" Kojir≈ç in the shores of Ganry≈´-jima island using a bokken carved from an oar but prior to the battle, Musashi saw a glimpse of the lengthy ≈çdachi under possession of Kojir≈ç and proceeded in making a wooden sword of greater length compared to his rival. Musashi eventually emerged victorious from the short fight after striking Kojir≈ç on his forehead that left him fatally wounded on the sand, with the former departing from the location without finishing in killing the latter, proving his point and ultimate goal of defeating him to detractors who called Musashi a coward for the act towards his rival. A month has passed since the defeat of Kojir≈ç at the hands of Musashi, who is planning to meet in Kyoto with his love, Otsu, who is joined by her young sister Suzume, a kunoichi from the Iga clan to escape. During this period, a series of kidnappings are occurring in Kyoto at the hands of a mysterious and sinister ninja clan. Before Musashi arrived the city, Otsu was kidnapped by the ninja clan while Suzume was momentarily out, which prompts Musashi and Suzume to form a team in order to rescue Otsu and the kidnapped citizens from the clan. On their venture, the duo faces a number of ninjas as well as monsters and eventually find the author responsible for all the occurring kidnappings in Kyoto; Sasaki \\"Ganry≈´\\" Kojir≈ç, who has a scar on his forehead and had risen from death reincarnating as a vengeful demonic demigod embedded with rage and evil known as Chaos, obtaining a power far beyond his imaginations and challenges both Musashi and Suzume to a final duel in Ganry≈´-jima. Due to their mutual love towards Otsu, Musashi and Suzume confront Chaos in an arduous fight, which results in the evil demigod being destroyed once and for all, with the duo finally reuniting with Otsu. Musashi and Otsu eventually married, while Suzume assumes the role of her sister in the Iga clan as a priestess.  Development and release  Ganryu was previewed in a 1998 issue of video game magazine Neo Geo Freak alongside other then-upcoming titles from Visco Corporation for the Neo Geo MVS such as Battle Flip Shot and Captain Tomaday, featuring different visuals compared with the final release in 1999. Although it was never originally ported to the Neo Geo AES, an officially endorsed conversion of the game by independent developer and publisher JoshProd was released for the console in June 2016. A year later, an officially licensed emulated port by Visco for the Dreamcast was also released by JoshProd and RushOnGame worldwide on September 30, 2017.

It was made at a factory owned by Pasquale Antonibon, who was already making fine maiolica in fashionable styles, which continued to be made alongside the porcelain. Production of porcelain began in 1762 and ended when Antonibon died in 1773. But it resumed in 1781, when Francisco Parolin (or Parolini) leased the factory for twenty years in a partnership with the Antonibons, known as the \\"Parolin period\\".Le Corbeiller, 8; Battie, 103Bagdade, 163 This lasted until 1802.Pair of Lovers, \\"Parolin period (1781‚Äì1802)\\" in the Metropolitan. Production of porcelain continued intermittently until 1835. Initially soft-paste porcelain was made, but some hard-paste porcelain from about 1765, though soft-paste pieces are still assigned dates after this. Some of the factory's products are also classified as terraglia, the Italian version of Staffordshire creamware, a fine earthenware. The production was generally similar to that of the Cozzi porcelain factory in Venice itself, and used the same clays, so it can be difficult to distinguish between the two.Le Corbeiller, 8; Battie, 103 Covered bowl and stand, c. 1765, hard-paste Bassano was the home of the prolific publishing house of the Remondini family, whose large output included popular prints, wallpaper, book illustrations, and decorative prints. These provided a ready source of images for the porcelain-painters of Le Nove, of whom the head was Giovanni Marcon, brought in by Parolin and still working for Baroni in about 1820.Vase in the V&A; Lane, Arthur, Italian Porcelain, 24, 1954, Faber; Battie, 103  History  Cups and saucers with insects, after 1775 The factory had been founded in 1728 by Giovanni Battista Antonibon, and taken over by his son Pasquale in 1751. For his production of porcelain he hired Sigusmund Fischer, who had worked at Meissen porcelain.Hallwyl Museum notes (In Swedish) He also sent Lorenzo Levantin, an employee, to work in the French Vincennes porcelain factory to learn their secrets.Favaro, 295 Porcelain production seems to have started in 1762, but was then paused until 1765 as Antonibon was ill. Some of the employees had by then gone to work for the Cozzi porcelain factory.Le Corbelier, 8 By 1768 production was on a large scale.Favaro, 302 In 1762 Pasquale Antonibon reported to the state that his operation consisted of 136 workers in the factory and 100 \\"pedlars\\" selling the wares. He had four large and twelve small kilns, and owned plots where he could extract materials.Favaro, 294 By 1768 he reported he had 6,000 pieces of porcelain in stock.Favaro, 295 In 1778 the factory, by then leased out, employed 120 workers making maiolica and 30 porcelain;Favaro, 305 in 1787, in the Parolin period, there were 37 porcelain-makers.Favaro, 307 The first two periods, under the ownership of Pasquale Antonibon and Parolin, are regarded as much the best, although William Chaffers describes some early pieces by the next owner, Giovanni Baroni, as \\"very charming\\", and notes the marks of Fabbrica Baroni pieces belonging to William Ewart Gladstone. Production of porcelain continued intermittently until the Antonibon family resumed operations in 1825. They made some porcelain until 1835, thereafter only making earthenwares of various types.Chaffers, 430‚Äì431; Battie ignores later periods In 1784 Pasquale's son Giambologna was old enough to take over the management of the family assets.Favaro, 303  Economics and politics  Cup and saucer Both the Cozzi and Le Nove factories used kaolin from the only known Italian source, Mount Tretto in the Dolomites, now in Schio, controlled by Bortolo Facci. He exploited this position by charging such a high price that Cozzi porcelain was more expensive in Venice than imported pieces. The price rose from 46 lire per carro (load) in 1765 to 100 lire per carro from 1770, then 110 from 1780. By the 1790s the Tretto deposits seemed to be running out. Both Cozzi and Le Nove lobbied the government hard to ameliorate this situation by monopolies and import duties, against each other and foreign manufacturers, but smuggling of foreign porcelain into Venice reduced the effectiveness of these.Favaro, 294‚Äì302 The Venetian government archives include extensive collections of petitions, complaints and reports throughout the 18th century documenting these efforts by the Antonibons and other owners, and some allegations of sabotage at the factories, enticing away of workers, and the theft of moulds.Favaro, 276‚Äì302 According to some scholars,Favaro, 294 (note) cites Arthur Lane, later supported by Raffaella Ausenda. the samples of supposed \\"Le Nove porcelain\\" sent by Antonibon to the Venetian government supporting a licence application in 1758 may actually have been made by the long-closed Vezzi porcelain factory in the 1720s, with painted decoration recently added in Nove.Favaro, 294 Before they began making porcelain, the Antonibons already enjoyed water rights enabling them to build grinding- mills,Favaro, 282 a ban (shared by other manufacturers) on their workers joining competitors without a four-year break,Favaro, 285 and from 1756 a monopoly on the manufacture of maiolica within five miles of Nove, affecting at least one rival in nearby Rivarotta.Favaro, 288‚Äì289 However, the Antonibons attempts to get a monopoly on the use of moulds were never successful.Favaro, 286 A local competitor complained of Pasquale Antonibon's \\"haughty and fierce nature\\" and the \\"authority and diligence\\" he used to get his way.Favaro, 288 In 1773 the various privileges were renewed, except for the maiolica monopoly, which changing Venetian policy now deprecated.Favaro, 302 In 1778 new porcelain factories in the republic's territories were banned, to protect the existing three manufacturers, Cozzi, Le Nove and a factory in Este, Veneto.Favaro, 306 After a further renewal in 1793, all privileges were revoked at the end of 1794 under a new policy.Favaro, 308 File:Plate MET LC-14 102 407.jpgMaiolica plate, c. 1750 File:Covered bowl and stand MET DP-12278-004.jpgDetail of cover for bowl, c. 1765, hard-paste File:Figures, late 18th century (CH 18429605-4) (cropped).jpgPersonification of the Americas (from a set of the continents), unglazed biscuit porcelain File:Pastoral Group MET ES6495.jpgPastoral Group, Parolin period, hard-paste File:Pair of lovers MET ES197.jpg Pair of Lovers, \\"Parolin period (1781‚Äì1802)\\", hard-paste File:Vase MET SF06 387ab img1.jpgVase, Parolin period, hard-paste  Notes   References  Battie, David, ed., Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain, 1990, Conran Octopus, *Chaffers, William, Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain, 1874 edition, online *Favaro, Giovanni, \\"Old and New Ceramics\\", in Lanaro, Paola (ed), At the Centre of the Old World: Trade and Manufacturing in Venice and on the Venetian Mainland (1400‚Äì1800), 2006, Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, Victoria University (Toronto, Ont.), , 9780772720313, Google Books *Le Corbeiller, Clare, Eighteenth-century Italian Porcelain, 1985, Metropolitan Museum of Art, , 9780870994210, fully online Category:Ceramics manufacturers of Italy Category:1762 establishments in Italy Category:Porcelain Category:Italian companies established in 1762 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1762 ","title":"Le Nove porcelain"},{"id":"61060608","text":"The 1990 Chadian coup d'√©tat took place on 3 December 1990 when the forces of the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), a Libyan‚Äìbacked rebel group under the leadership of General Idriss D√©by, entered the Chadian capital N'Djamena unopposed.

Prior to directing the film, Andolfi worked in film in the amateur theatre and claims to have worked in developing stories for Lanciostory. He based the film on his work in theatre and comics and real life experiences. Among the cast includes Andolfi who is credited as Eddy Endolf and Annie Belle and adult film actress Zaira Zoccheddu. After the film's release, Andolfi re-edited the film in 1995 and re-released it under the name Talisman. This version of the film included footage from documentaries and newsreels and footage from The Serpent and the Rainbow. Plot Production Marco Antonio Andolfi worked first at a sewing machine company as a technician while working in amateur theatre on the side. While attempting to work in film in the 1970s, he stated he worked writing plays and photonovels for Lanciostory magazine. The story and screenplay for the film were based on a real-life event that happened to Andolfi who stated that in Naples he had a bejeweled cross he was going to give to a woman in Naples, when two people in motorcycles came by and took it off his neck. Andolfi stated he retrieved the cross and combined this real-life story with stories from his plays and comics. Andolf managed to get funding from the state due to Article 28 of the 1965 cinema law that allowed for state funding for films with cultural or artistic aspirations. Andolfi stars in the film under the name of Eddy Endolf, stating that this was done as \\"distributors would not even take me into consideration\\". Among the cast were pornographic film actor Zaira Zoccheddu and actress Annie Belle. Belle was suffering from alcohol abuse at the time and stated in a later interview that she did not remember anything about the film. Release Cross of the Seven Jewels was distributed theatrically in Italy on 30 April 1987 by Compagnia Distribuzione Internazionale. Andolfi assembled a re-edited version of the film in 1995 titled Talisman, with scenes taken from documentaries, newsreel footage and from the film The Serpent and the Rainbow. Reception Italian film critic and historian Roberto Curti described the film as having a reputation of being \\"one of the worst Italian movies ever made\\".

The restaurants served German cuisine. Joe Baum, the president of Restaurant Associates, opened the first branch of Zum Zum in the Pan Am Building in concert with the opening of the 1964 World's Fair. The restaurants were unique in offering only counter seating. The menu included a variety of German wurst and freshly smoked meats. New York Times restaurant critic Craig Claiborne wrote about the food: \\"The Zum Zum's sausages, whether bauernwurst or a frankfurter, are well seasoned and with good texture. The sausage salad, on the other hand, is an interesting idea but disappointing in preparation. Like the restaurant's potato salad, it seems vitally lacking in ingredients that would elevate its character, chopped onion, for example, chopped pickle and more herbs such as parsley. It is too bland for one palate.\\" The Zum Zum logo featured a sausage in the shape of the letter \\"U\\". It was designed by George Lois and Kurt Weihs in 1963. Zum Zum was mentioned in the 1974 Jobriath song \\"Scumbag,\\" which in turn inspired a reference to \\"Zom Zom's\\" in the Gary Numan song \\"Down in the Park.\\"In a 1995 webchat (http://webb.garynuman.info/confession/9511.html), Numan acknowledged that this name was inspired by \\"a Jobriath song\\" (presumably \\"Scumbag\\" from the Creatures of the Street album, in which \\"Zum Zum Zum Zum Zum Zum Zum restaurant\\" is mentioned).

It \\"disintegrated\\" in the spring of 1935 due to pressures of the Great Depression and \\"absence of strong leadership.\\" About half its chapters were absorbed into other fraternities. History Sigma Delta Rho was founded at Miami University on January 8, 1921 under the name of Delta Sigma Rho, and had received recognition from the university as a new local fraternity under that name. However, it was discovered that there was a previously existing national recognition (~honor) society of the same name, thus after several months, when plans were made for expansion into a national organization the chapter changed its own name, switching the order of the first two letters, to avoid confusion.See Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha for the recognition society whose name was in conflict. Incorporated then as Sigma Delta Rho under the laws of the State of Ohio, the chapter was the fifth social fraternity to be founded at Miami.See the Miami Triad for further information. Sigma Delta Rho honored five founders: * Gilbert L. Stout * Albert O. Grooms * Aurthur Baker * Herbert Ansteatt * Roe Bush The official badge of the society was a cross pat√© form√© purpure (formed of purple) with edges or (gold), connected by four chains of five links each; this was superimposed with a mascle (a lozenge-shaped device), or (also gold), enclosing the letters Œ£ŒîŒ° on a field of argent (silver).

The Epsilon chapter was noted to have originally formed as a local called Kappa Alpha Chi. * Ohio - - Zeta Chapter * Franklin & Marshall - - Eta Chapter - Became Alpha Gamma chapter of Alpha Kappa Pi in 1936, eventually Alpha Sigma Phi's Beta Pi chapter. * Hillsdale - - Theta Chapter * Tri-State College - - Iota Chapter Demise According to Baird's, disagreement developed among its chapters as to the policies of the fraternity. Additionally, financial problems caused by the Great Depression and a lack of strong leadership all led to a downfall in the spring of 1935. Fellow national fraternity Alpha Kappa Pi gained the chapters at Franklin and Marshall, Toledo, and Cincinnati. This national later merged with Alpha Sigma Phi. The Illinois chapter banded together with a faltering chapter of Beta PsiBaird's says \\"Beta Psi\\". Could this be have been the Alpha chapter of Beta Sigma Psi, which closed in 1940? to form a new chapter of Pi Kappa Phi.

During the general election in 1996, he defeated Moon Hee-sang from the National Congress for New Politics (NCNP). In 1997, he left the NKP and joined the National Party - New (NPN) in order to endorse Lee In-je as the upcoming President. Hong stood up as a nonpartisan candidate in 2000 despite of his lost. He temporarily came back as MP after the by-election in 2003, till he lost just after a year. After involving several controversies, Hong officially came back as MP in 2012. He was then re-elected in 2016. As one of the politicians supporting ex-President Park Geun-hye, he endorsed her as President in 2007. He unsuccessfully ran as the parliamentary leader of the Liberty Korea Party (LKP) in 2017. In 2019, Hong announced to leave the LKP. A minor political party named the Korean Patriots' Party elected Hong as the party president along with incumbent Cho Won-jin, and the party officially changed their name as the Our Republican Party (ORP). On 10 February 2020, Hong was sacked from the ORP after long-time conflicts with Cho. He then formed the new party named Pro-Park New Party.

Hofmann, Louis Mader and John Rasmussen, who are almost exclusively known for their paintings of the almshouse in Berks County, Pennsylvania, done in an early folk art style. They were all born in Germany. The almshouse The almshouse, located in Cumru Township, Shillington, was originally the property of Governor Thomas Mifflin and was known as Angelica Farm. The first building, a home for the insane, was constructed in 1824. Separate houses for male and female inmates were established in 1832. A modern hospital was added in 1874, devoted to caring for the infirm, sick, disabled, and feeble-minded as well as the insane. A report, prepared in 1885, found that the insane were not receiving adequate care and should be transferred to a state hospital. By the early 20th century, their focus had shifted almost entirely to caring for the infirm and elderly. The outdated complex was demolished in 1957 and part of the land was taken by the local school district.\\"The Berks County Almshouse\\", @ Asylum Projects. The almshouse served as the model for the \\"Diamond County Home for the Aged\\" in The Poorhouse Fair; a novel by John Updike. The painters Berks County Almshouse by Hofmann (1878) =Charles C. Hofmann= Hofmann appears to have spent most of his life in this and similar institutions. He was born c.1820, exact place unknown, and emigrated to the United States in 1860. By 1865, he was living in Reading, Pennsylvania. From then until 1872, he was an itinerant portrait painter along the Schuylkill River.Biography @ AskArt, That year, he was committed to the Berks County Almshouse for vagrancy and \\"intemperance\\". While there, he completed two watercolor views and later did eight paintings on canvas and tin. Despite the fact that poorhouses of that time were uniformly dirty and neglected, his paintings are all positive and highly idealized. There is some evidence he had been trained as a lithographer. In fact, most of his works are circled by vignettes, which was common practice in contemporary lithographs.Biography @ the National Gallery of Art. He would be intermittently confined to almshouses for drunkenness throughout the remainder of his life. In between, he painted farmscapes and businesses on commission. Many of his paintings feature a bearded man with a bottle; believed to be a self-portrait. In 1882, he was admitted to the almshouse with a broken arm, died there a few months later of \\"dropsy\\", and was buried in the nearby potter's field. Three of his works are held by the National Gallery of Art. Berks County Almshouse by Mader (1895) Berks County Almshouse by Rasmussen (1880) =Louis Mader= Mader was born in 1842 and emigrated to the United States in 1867. He first entered the Berks County Almshouse in 1892 and painted at least eight views of the almshouse during the next three years. He left there in 1899 and there is no further record of him. The only non-almshouse painting attributed to him is a mural in a home in Parkesburg, Pennsylvania.Biography @ the National Gallery of Art. His aerial view of the almshouse, created in 1895, is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art. =John Rasmussen= He was born in 1828 and emigrated to the United States in 1865. Like Hofmann, he was originally committed to the almshouse for vagrancy and drunkenness. He would stay from 1879 until his death in 1895. While there, he became a friend of Hofmann and was inspired to do similar paintings. These are his only known works, although the Reading City Directory had listed him as a painter for several years.Biography @ AskArt Hofmann sold paintings locally. When he died in 1882, Rasmussen began to sell his works to Hofmann's former clients. After his death, he remained virtually unknown until 1968, when the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum held a retrospective show of all three Almshouse painters. His paintings may be seen at the Reading Public Museum and the American Folk Art Museum.

In subsequent months more cases and deaths were reported. The cause of outbreak is unclear. Malnutrition, climate, hygiene, inadequate health facilities, and lack of awareness are considered as contributing factors. The lychee fruit toxins are also cited as plausible cause of AES.  History  Outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) have occurred previously in the northern regions of Bihar state and eastern regions of Uttar Pradesh state of India. The first case of AES in Muzaffarpur district was recorded in 1995. There were 143 deaths in 2013, 355 in 2014, 11 in 2015, four in 2016, 11 in 2017 and 7 in 2018. In most recent years, the death toll had remained under 20.  Outbreak  In June 2019, an outbreak of AES occurred in 222 blocks of Muzaffarpur and the adjoining districts in Bihar. As a result of the outbreak, total 154 children died in first three weeks of June 2019. A total of 440 cases of AES were admitted to hospitals in these three weeks. At least 85 children of them died at the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), the largest state-operated hospital in Bihar, while at least 18 children died at the Kejriwal Matrisadan, a trust-run hospital, in these weeks. Most of them were aged between 1 and 10 years. In subsequent months of July, August and September; at SKMCH; 30, 18 and at least 12 cases were reported. Total 647 cases of AES including 161 deaths were reported between 1 June and 20 September 2019.  Syndrome  The term acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) was coined by the World Health Organisation in 2008. The symptoms of AES include an acute onset of fever and associated clinical neurological manifestations such as mental confusion, disorientation, delirium, convulsions, or coma. Early symptoms include headaches and vomiting, along with sudden hypoglycemia (drops in blood sugar levels), but may lead to coma, brain dysfunctions, and inflammation of the heart and lungs. Those that survive AES may have long-term neurological weaknesses. The severe hypoglycemia can cause death. The syndrome is locally known as chamki fever in Bihar.  Cause  The cause of the outbreak is unclear. AES can be caused by different microorganisms including virus, bacteria, fungi, parasites and spirochetes, as well as chemicals and toxins. AES mostly affects children below 15. In India, AES was chiefly associated with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) before 1975. The JEV cases and outbreaks became more frequent and endemic regions developed between 1975 and 1999. After 1999, non-JEV cases and outbreaks of AES were increasingly reported caused by other viruses including Chandipura virus (CHPV), Nipah virus (NiV), and enteroviruses. After 2012, it is observed that the cause shifting to JEV. Initial examination shows little sign of the JEV or other viral routes in the affected children. A study by AIIMS Patna found the presence of enterovirus. High temperature, humidity, malnutrition, poor hygiene and lack of awareness are known aggravating factors of AES. Cases of AES tend to occur during the country's monsoon season. In June 2019, the temperature in Muzaffarpur had remained above and the rains were delayed which might have aggravated the situation. It was the second-longest heatwave in the region. Poverty and malnutrition is widespread among children in the region. Malnourished children lack a buffer stock of sugar as glycogen in the liver which puts them at higher risk of hypoglycemia. Awareness campaigns were carried out in March‚ÄìApril 2019 but were not conducted later due to the 2019 Indian general elections. The local administration was not watchful due to the few cases of AES in recent years. Lychee fruits, which naturally include toxins related to encephalitis, are suspected to have been a contributing factor in the outbreak.The region is the largest producer of lychee fruits in India. A 2014 study published in Lancet found that the methylene cyclopropyl acetic acid and hypoglycin A found in unripe lychee (Litchi chinensis) fruit can cause hypoglycemia and cited them as plausible cause of AES outbreaks. A diet heavy on unripe lychee fruits without having an otherwise full meal later in the day may put malnourished children at risk of hypoglycemia. Others disputed the findings citing the unlikeliness of very large consumption of unripe lychee fruits, lack of cases in healthy, well-nourished children and many other pediatric illnesses causing hypoglycemia. Health officials reported that most of the victims suffered severe hypoglycemia. The hospitals and primary health centres lacked the required facilities to treat children.  Government response  The Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar announced an ex gratia payment of to the next of the kin of the children who died from AES. He also visited the hospital and ordered the expansion of the hospital. The union minister of health Harsh Vardhan visited and announced the set-up of 100-bed pediatric ward at the SKMCH as well as five virology laboratories in Bihar. He also announced the upgrade of the India Meteorological Department‚Äôs observatory in Muzaffarpur for better study of climate. Seven pediatric intensive care units are being established. The interdisciplinary team consisting of experts from Indian Council of Medical Research, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, National Institute of Malaria Research; National Institute of Nutrition, National Institute of Virology; National Institute of Epidemiology and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi was formed and sent to Bihar to study the syndrome and establish the cause. The Supreme Court ordered the Bihar government to file an affidavit to show the competence of medical facilities and other hygiene conditions in the state in the wake of the deaths. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) sent notices to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Bihar government over the deaths and asked for a report in four weeks.

College of Pharmacy, Ahmedabad in 1950. Ketan R. Patel is the current Chairman & Managing Director of the company. Milan R. Patel is Joint Managing Director of the company. Litigation In 2016, Troikaa Pharmaceuticals filed a petition in Delhi High Court seeking license cancellation of Diclofenac Sodium Injection 75 mg/ml, manufactured by Themis Medicare Pvt Ltd and marketed by Novartis India Ltd. under the brand name Voveran 1ml. Troikaa claimed that the diclofenac sodium 75 mg/ml injection contained Transcutol-P which caused damage to the kidneys. In July 2018, India's Drug Regulator canceled the license granted to M/S Themis Medicare for the sale of Diclofenac injection 75 mg/ml containing Transcutol-P. In 2012, Troikaa Pharmaceuticals filed a patent infringement suit in Ahmedabad district court against Ahmedabad-based Lincoln Pharmaceuticals and Delhi-based Akums Drug & Pharmaceuticals Ltd, saying the two companies had infringed upon its patented high concentration, low viscosity diclofenac injection. The case was continued by Gujarat High Court, and ordered to Akums Drugs not to infringe, and dismissed Linclon Pharma's appeal. In 2008, Troikaa filed a suit for infringement of design against a company manufacturing D-shaped tablets. The company had challenged that Troikaa's D shaped tablet registration was invalid. The suit was transferred to the High Court of Gujarat and later in its first case under the Designs Act, the High Court decided in favor of the Troikaa.
