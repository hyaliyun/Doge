The church was built in the early 16th century but has been greatly altered so that, apart from the tower, the visible parts of the church date from the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. Since 1996 St Mary Magdalene's has been part of the Richmond Team Ministry, which also includes the churches of St John the Divine and St Matthias. It has a strong musical tradition and offers choral services each Sunday. History The initial chapel was built in around 1220. The church was entirely reconstructed during the reign of Henry VII who, after rebuilding the royal palace of Sheen, renamed Sheen as Richmond in 1501. The two bottom sections of the tower that survive from this period were re-faced in flint in 1904. In the early 17th century, a south aisle was added to the nave. The north aisle was added in 1699. The original nave and the south aisle were rebuilt in 1750, and iron window frames replaced the original windows in 1850. The plaster ceiling over the nave was replaced in 1866 by the architect Arthur Blomfield with timberwork, described by Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"inappropriate\\". Blomfield also constructed new galleries and replaced the box pews with bench pews. In 1903‚Äì04 the architect George Frederick Bodley replaced the chancel with a new chancel, two chapels (Chapel of All Souls and Chapel of All Saints) and a vestry in a Neo-Gothic style. The tower was faced with flint and stone to match the east end. The north and south galleries were removed at this time. The west gallery was removed in 1935‚Äì36. =Burials and monuments= James Thomson Richard Yates in a dozen roles, 1826 lithograph * Richard Attenborough, Lord Attenborough (d. 2014), actor, filmmaker, entrepreneur, and politician, who lived on Richmond Green.

It was the second film to be produced under the PERFINI banner. Detailing the show of force in which the Indonesian republican army retook the capital at Yogyakarta for six hours, the film utilised much of the cast and crew from Ismail's previous work Darah dan Doa (1950). The film was a success in Indonesia and continued to be screened on the state television channel into the 1980s, even after two further films about the event were released. Plot Amidst the Indonesian National Revolution, the Dutch colonial army has launched an assault on the Indonesian capital at Yogyakarta. After being overrun, the Indonesian Army withdraws, to continue the fight as guerrillas. In the city proper, the Indonesian populace suffers extensively. In early 1949, the Sultan of Yogyakarta, Hamengkubuwono IX, orders a show of force: the guerrilla soldiers are to take back the city, hold it for six hours, and then withdraw. This attack, intended to show that the Dutch had not put down the Indonesian forces and thus embarrass the returning colonists in front of the United Nations, goes as planned on the morning of 1 March. The Netherlands recognises Indonesia's independence by the end of the year. Cast *Rd Ismail *Del Juzar *Aedy Moward *Agus Muljono *M. Sani Production Enam Djam di Jogja was directed and produced by Usmar Ismail. It was his second film dealing with the national revolution following Darah dan Doa (The Long March) the preceding year, which had followed the Siliwangi Division's long march to West Java. The black-and-white film Ismail also wrote the film's story, with Gajus Siagian handling the screenplay. In the film's opening credits, he wrote that it was intended to show the \\"tight cooperation between the people, army, and government\\" without which the 1 March General Assault could not have happened and commemorate those who had fallen fighting for the nationalist cause. Enam Djam di Jogja retained much of the same crew as Darah dan Doa, including cinematographer Max Tera, music arranger G.R.W. Sinsu, and editor Djohan Sjafri. Cast members who returned from the earlier film included Del Juzar, Aedy Moward, and Rd Ismail. Filming was completed on location in Yogyakarta, at sites which had seen action during the assault. Ismail and his crew were aided in their filming by persons who had seen the events depicted. After funds were depleted, Ismail took a loan from a local cinema owner to ensure he could complete Enam Djam di Jogja. Release and reception Before Enam Djam di Jogja was released in early 1951, Ismail had to endure a lengthy censorship process. The Indonesian censorship bureau, according to the film critic Salim Said, took issue with the depiction of Dutch soldiers; in the end, numerous scenes showing them were cut. Critical reception at the time was mixed: a review in the magazine Aneka, for instance, found that the shots could have been better, but the performances were better than usual for domestic works. The Indonesian film archive Sinematek Indonesia holds both a 35 mm and VHS copy of Enam Djam di Jogja. Allusions to the title, in other Indonesian works, were made as late as 1991. Two further films have been released detailing the General Assault of 1 March: Abbas Wiranatakusuma's Janur Kuning (Yellow Coconut Leaves; 1980) and Arifin C. Noer's Serangan Fajar (Dawn Attack; 1982). Unlike Enam Djam di Jogja, these two films emphasised the role of future President Suharto ‚Äì who is not present in Ismail's version. At the time these two films were released, Enam Djam di Jogja continued to be screened on the state television network TVRI. Eventually Janur Kuning was broadcast annually on the anniversary of the assault, before it and Serangan Fajar were withdrawn from broadcast in 1998 for attempting to manipulate history and create a cult with Suharto in the centre, following Suharto's downfall.

The presiding deity of the temple is goddess Kali, hence the name Kalibari or Abode of Kali. The temple is famous for its Kali Puja and Durga Puja which is held on October/November of every year during Dusshera and Diwali. About Kalibari In 1974, a piece of Land measuring about 2000 sq. yds was donated by the late Shree S.Madhusudan Reddy, ex-M.L.C. Malkajgiri a devotee of Ma Kali, to the Hyderabad Kalibari trust for building a Kali Temple. Subsequently, a number of devotees, in particular the late Lala Chowdhury Maman Ram Agarwal, a philanthropist came forward in collecting / offering donations substantially for the construction of the Kalibari at Vivekanandapuram, Neredmet, Secunderabad. The organization started in 1974 and the foundation stone was laid by the Swamy Ranganathanandaji Maharaj, the then President of Ramakrishna mission Hyderabad. On 28 August 1976, an idol of Kalimata, which was made out of a single piece of black stone, was purchased from \\"Chitpur\\", West Bengal, which was in the pattern of Kalimata of Dakshineshwar temple at Kolkata. It was installed by Swamy Ranganathanandaji Maharaj of Ramakrishna Mission and the late Raja Sagi Suryanarayana Raju, the then Minister for Endowments, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh was the chief guest on this occasion. The idol sthapana and Pran Pratistha of the goddess was done by the late Sree Gostha Behari Bhattacherjee, Vidyaratna, a famous Tantric priest of famous \\"Chunagali Kali Temple\\" of Kolkata. Late Sree A.K.Ganguly, the 1st priest of Hyderabad Kalibari, assisted him in performing the pooja under vedic and tantric ways in accordance with shastrik injunctions. Swamy Ranganathanandaji Maharaj was approached for guidance. He suggested that the Kalibari should be named as the \\"Hyderabad Kalibari\\". Many devotees visit the holy Kalibari premises in search of solace. Today Hyderabad Kalibari performs all the festivals related to Bengal, viz. Saraswati puja, Annapurna Puja etc. All Amavasya (new moon) Pujas where Kali is worshipped in the temple. Devotees in large numbers gather on all such occasions. The Kalibari also has a free school for children where Bengali is taught. Also dancing and singing are taught every Sunday. The children take part in the social programmes which happen year round.

Biography After an apprenticeship as a carpenter, Amberg studied at the Royal Danish Academy's architecture school (1856‚Äì1865) while receiving instruction from Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll, Christian Hansen and Ferdinand Meldahl. In 1874, he won the Academy's gold medal and spent the following two years travelling, mainly to Greece and Turkey. Amberg exhibited at Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition (1863-1884), in Exposition Universelle (1878) in Paris, the Nordic Industrial, Agricultural and Art Exhibition (1888) in Copenhagen, and Copenhagen's City Hall exhibition (1901). Amberg won a competition to design Christiansborg Palace in 1887. Amberg's design was used in the replacement building in H√∏jbro Plads after St Nicholas Church was destroyed in the fire of 1795. Amberg's approach, like that of his contemporaries, was influenced by the Historicist requirement to adopt one or more historical styles in every assignment. He designed buildings in the Faroe Islands, including a residence in Thorshavn and Ejde Church (Ejde Kirke) on the island of Su√∞uroy (1880‚Äì1881); both with characteristic pyramid spires. His Tinghus in the centre of Esbjerg (1891) and the manor at Vindeholme near Nakskov (1913) are also notable. His greatest achievements were, however, in the area of restoration and renovation work including that on the town hall of Ribe (1882‚Äì1884) and Ribe Cathedral (1882‚Äì1904) as well as the old priory at Mariager Abbey (1891‚Äì1892).Leo K.

The 12-page newspaper has been published weekly since late August 2012.

Later on, an online version was produced and some of the articles are translated into English. However, the priority is the newspaper itself, say its editors, because many in Syria do not have access to an Internet connection. Therefore, the printed version of the newspaper is widely distributed in major cities in Syria, such as Damascus (the capital), Homs and Aleppo. The 12-pages weekly newspaper (as it was launched at first) is edited by pioneer reporters, defied the long-felt fear by Syrian journalists, to express the voice of the people taking the streets. \\"Hurriyat\\" aims to connect with all segments of the Syrian society, particularly those supportive of the government. In addition to providing a review of the week‚Äôs events on the streets in Syria, it offers analysis of the current economic and social sectors in Syrian cities and towns, and a forecast of developments in both these sectors in the near and far futures, along with the simultaneous development in the Syrian political sector. \\"We want to motivate protesters and keep their spirits high...but also give all Syrians an alternative to the mainstream, state-controlled media.

He is known for his work with the sculptor Clemente Susini in preparing highly detailed and accurate wax anatomical models. Birth and education Francesco Antonio Boi was born in Olzai, Nuoro, Sardinia in 1767, the son of a farmer. As a child he showed a high level of intelligence, and was sent to the Franciscans of Fonni in Sardinia to train for a career in the church. At the time, the church provided the only way in which someone from a poor family could obtain an education. He remained at the seminary until he was eighteen. He completed his studies in grammar, literature and philosophy, but then became interested in medicine and left the friars to attend the University of Cagliari. On 22 October 1795 he graduated as a doctor of medicine, and was given a teaching position in the university. Career On 13 September 1796 Boi was appointed Associate Professor by royal decree, and on 16 March 1799 he was made Professor of Anatomy. Although the chair of anatomy had been founded in 1764, until Boi was appointed it had been filled by professors from other disciplines. Boi lectured at Cagliari for three years, but there were few students enrolled in the faculty. In 1801 he therefore asked for permission, which was granted, to visit other universities to continue his study of anatomy. Boi first visited the University of Pavia, where the famous anatomist Antonio Scarpa (1752-1832) was the professor of anatomy, and then the University of Pisa before going on to Florence. There was no university in Florence, but there was a flourishing school of anatomy at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova under Paolo Mascagni (1755-1816), whose friend Felice Fontana (1730-1805) was the founder and director of La Specola Wax Museum. Charles Felix (1765-1831), the younger brother of King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia (1759-1824), financed Boi during his stay in Florence. Boi began to study anatomy in Florence under Mascagni. He initially assumed his maternal name of Pirisi, but his skill and knowledge of anatomy soon became apparent, and he was forced to reveal himself. He began a close collaboration with Mascagni, with whom he formed a deep friendship. It was during these years that he worked with the sculptor Clemente Susini at La Specola in preparing wax anatomical models for teaching purposes. Charles Felix had commissioned Boi to help prepare the models, for which Boi undertook the dissections that Susini then reproduced in wax. Charles Felix purchased the wax models for his Museum of Natural History and Antiquities at considerable expense. In 1805 Boi returned to Cagliari, where he resumed teaching, bringing the wax models with him. In 1818 he was appointed Minister of Health of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which included not just the island of Sardinia but also the territories of Liguria, Piedmont and Savoy. In 1824 he was knighted. On his retirement in 1844 he was made a professor emeritus of the faculty. He died in Cagliari on 15 May 1850. Work Most of Boi's lectures have been lost, and none of his work was printed, so he is known now mainly by the high reputation he earned during his life and for the wax models that he helped to create. Some of Susini's most important works are held in Cagliari, and were based on dissection by Boi. They highlight the nerves and do not show lymphatics in the brain, correcting a mistake made in Susini's earlier waxes. They represent the convolutions of the human brain, and show the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems in accurate detail. It is clear that Susina and Boi worked closely together to ensure a high level of anatomical accuracy. The Cagliari models, with expressive faces and harmony of colors, are also artistic masterpieces. The models were transferred to the anatomy department of the University of Cagliari in 1858. In 1963 they were placed on display in a room in the Institute of Anatomy. In 1991 they were transferred to the Clemente Susini's Anatomical Waxes Museum (Cagliari) located in the Cittadella dei Musei in Piazza Arsenale, where they are now on display in a pentagonal room.

Eight days after her parents had reported her missing her body was discovered in L√∂tsj√∂n a lake in Sundbyberg; she had been raped and strangled to death. News media was filled with reports of the murder and her playmate Jan Sparring was interviewed by several media; Sparring later became a known singer in Sweden. A month after her body was discovered, media reported that her killer must have a dog and that jute fibers had been found on her coat. Police also stated that they were searching for a black car in connection with her murder. Soon a 33-year-old man, Olle M√∂ller, was arrested and interrogated. M√∂ller who was born in Michigan in the United States and had moved to Sweden at a young age, was a known athlete in Stockholm. On 17 January 1940 M√∂ller was released by the police and the newspaper Aftonbladet set a 10,000 kronor reward for any tips that would lead to Johansson's killer being arrested. In December 1940, M√∂ller was once again arrested and this time he was prosecuted and on 7 March 1940 he was sentenced to ten years hard labour for \\"attempted rape and assault with death occurring\\". M√∂ller appealed his sentence, but his sentence was upheld in two more appeals and, on 26 June 1942, his sentence was finalised. However, over the following years the trial received a lot of criticism and accusations of false testaments, with rewards for those who testified against M√∂ller. In 1984, one of the witnesses against M√∂ller at his trial revealed that they had falsely testified that they saw M√∂ller with Gerd Johansson. M√∂ller was released from prison on 11 September 1948, after serving six years of hard labour. M√∂ller was later sentenced once again, this time for the murder of Rut Lind in 1959. After M√∂ller's death in 1983, his daughter continued to fight for her father to be officially acquitted of Gerd Johansson's murder. She took her claim to court that her father should be officially acquitted of the 1939 murder, because of witness confessions of untrue testimony in court. Her claim was denied by the supreme court of Stockholm on 24 May 1985. In 1998, a DNA test was made on the clothes of Gerd Johansson, but no certain results could be determined. Olle M√∂ller och or√§ttvisan was a book released in 2010 by Henry Sidoli, covering the murder case. In 2012, the book M√∂rdaren i folkhemmet by Lena Ebervall and Per E Samuelson was released about the Johansson murder case. M√∂ller himself released a book in 1966 called Jag √§r oskyldig (I'm innocent) about the case.

It was the first mass-market German magazine and pioneered the format of the illustrated news magazine.

In 1894, Leopold Ullstein, the founder of the publishing house Ullstein Verlag, bought it.Mila Ganeva, Women in Weimar Fashion: Discourses and Displays in German Culture, 1918-1933, Screen cultures, Rochester, New York: Camden House, 2008, , p. 53. In 1897 it cost RM 1.50 per quarter; by comparison the Illustrirte Zeitung of Leipzig, which had been founded in 1843, had approximately twice as many pages and cost RM 7 per year, prohibitively expensive for all but the well to do.Werner Faulstich, Medienwandel im Industrie- und Massenzeitalter (1830-1900), Geschichte der Medien 5, G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2004, , p. 73 Technical advances including photo-offset printing, the linotype machine and cheaper production of paper later made it possible to sell it for 10 pfennigs an issue, which was within the reach even of workers. At the suggestion of the business manager, David Cohn, Ullstein lifted the subscription requirement, and it was then sold in the street (which had been illegal until 1904), at station kiosks and in drinking establishments as well as by a force of female subscription sellers, and became the first mass-market periodical in Germany.de Mendelssohn, pp. 104-08. (The price doubled to 20 pfennigs in November 1923 when the currency was stabilised after the runaway inflation of the early 1920s.de Mendelssohn, p. 256.) Once it no longer required a subscription, the Berliner Illustrirte fundamentally changed the newspaper market, attracting readers by its appearance, particularly the eye-catching pictures. The first cover created a sensation, featuring a group portrait of officers who had been killed in a shipwreck. Initially it was illustrated with engravings, but it soon embraced photographs. Beginning in 1901, it was also technically feasible to print photographs inside the magazine, a revolutionary innovation. Building on the example of a rival Berlin publication, August Scherl's Die Woche, Ullstein developed it into the prototype of the modern news magazine. It pioneered the photo-essay,Mary Warner Marien, Photography: A Cultural History, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2002, , p. 235. had a specialised staff and production unit for pictures and maintained a photo library. With other news magazines like the M√ºnchner Illustrierte Presse in Munich and Vu in France, it also pioneered the use of candid photographs taken with the new smaller cameras.Brett Abbott, Engaged Observers: Documentary Photography Since the Sixties, Exhibition catalogue, Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2010, , p. 6. In August 1919, a cover photograph of the German President Friedrich Ebert and Minister of Defence Gustav Noske on holiday on the Baltic coast, clad in swimming trunks, caused heated debate about propriety; within a decade, such informality would seem normal.Gail Finney, Visual Culture in Twentieth-Century Germany: Text as Spectacle, Bloomington: Indiana University, 2006, , p. 225.

The novel was published in English translation as Helene. Appeal to the common reader also included competitions; for example, in May-June 1928, a contest called B√ºb oder M√§del offered prizes to readers who could correctly identify the sex of young people in six photographs.Maud Lavin, \\"Androgyny, Spectatorship, and the Weimar Photomontages of Hannah H√∂ch\\", New German Critique 51, Autumn 1990, pp. 62-86, p. 75.

From 1926 to 1931, news periodicals in Germany had their own aircraft deliver copies to remote places; Luft Hansa then took over this function. Under the Third Reich, the Berliner Illustrirte like all other German publications was subject to Joseph Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry.

After the war, the Ullstein family regained control of the publishing company but beginning in 1956, gradually sold it to Axel Springer.

Volume 1, Land Birds, appeared in 1797. Volume 2, Water Birds, appeared in 1804. A supplement was published in 1821. The text in Land Birds was written by Ralph Beilby, while Bewick took over the text for the second volume. The book is admired mainly for the beauty and clarity of Bewick's wood-engravings, which are widely considered his finest work, and among the finest in that medium. British Birds has been compared to works of poetry and literature. It plays a recurring role in Charlotte Bront√´'s novel Jane Eyre. William Wordsworth praised Bewick in the first lines of his poem \\"The Two Thieves\\": \\"Oh now that the genius of Bewick were mine, And the skill which he learned on the banks of the Tyne.\\" The book was effectively the first \\"field guide\\" for non-specialists. Bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species, from life if possible, or from skins. The common and scientific name(s) are listed, citing the naming authorities. The bird is described, with its distribution and behaviour, often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents. Those who provided skins or information are acknowledged. The species are grouped into families such as \\"Of the Falcon\\", using the limited and conflicting scientific sources of the time. The families of land birds are further grouped into birds of prey, omnivorous birds, insectivorous birds, and granivorous birds, while the families of water birds are simply listed, with related families side by side. Each species entry begins on a new page; any spaces at the ends of entries are filled with tail- pieces, small, often humorous woodcuts of country life. British Birds remains in print, and has attracted the attention of authors such as Jenny Uglow. Critics note Bewick's skill as a naturalist as well as an engraver. Approach Red-necked Grebe\\" The preface states that \\"while one of the editors of this work was engaged in preparing the cuts, which are faithfully drawn from Nature, and engraved upon wood, the compilation of the descriptions .. (of the Land Birds) was undertaken by the other , subject, however, to the corrections of his friend, whose habits had led him to a more intimate acquaintance with this branch of Natural History\\", and goes on to mention that the compilation of text was the \\"production of those hours which could be spared from a laborious employment\\", namely the long hours of work engraving the minutely detailed wood printing blocks. What the preface does not say is the reason for this statement about the \\"editors\\", which was an angry stand- off between Bewick and Beilby, caused by Beilby's intention to have an introduction which merely thanked Bewick for his \\"assistance\\", and a title- page naming Beilby as the sole author. Bewick's friend (and his wife's godfather) Thomas Hornby heard of this, and informed Bewick. An informal trade panel met to judge the matter, and the preface was the result; and Beilby's name did not appear on the title-page.Uglow, 2006. pp. 259‚Äì261. Each species of bird is presented in a few pages (generally between two and four; occasionally, as with the mallard or \\"Common Wild Duck\\", a few more). First is a woodcut of the bird, always either perched or standing on the ground, even in the case of water birds ‚Äì such as the smew ‚Äì that (as winter visitors) do not nest in Britain, and consequently are rarely seen away from water there. Bewick then presents the name, with variations, and the Latin and French equivalents. For example, \\"The Musk Duck\\" is also named on the line below as \\"Cairo, Guinea, or Indian Duck\\", and the next line \\"(Anas moschata, Linn.‚ÄîLe Canard Musque, Buff.)\\" provides the scholarly references to the giving of the Latin binomial by Linnaeus and a French description by Buff[on].Bewick, 1797‚Äì1804. The text begins by stating the size of the bird. Bewick then describes the bird, typically in one paragraph, naming any notable features such as the colour of the eyes (\\"irides\\"), the bill, the legs, and plumage on each part of the body. Next, the origin and distribution of the species are discussed, with notes or quotations from authorities such as John Ray, Gilbert White and Buffon. Bewick then mentions any other facts of interest about the bird; in the case of the musk duck, this concerns its \\"musky smell, which arises from the liquor secreted in the glands on the rump\\". If the bird hybridizes with other species, this is described, along with whether the hybrids are fertile (\\"productive\\"). Vigors in 1825. hide, at end of \\"Sabine's Snipe\\" Finally, Bewick acknowledges anyone who helped. The musk duck is stated to have been drawn from a \\"living specimen\\" which was however \\"excepting the head, entirely white\\", unlike the \\"general appearance\\" shown in the woodcut; the bird \\"was lent to this work by William Losh, Esq., of Point Pleasant, near Newcastle\\". Losh, one of Bewick's many collaborators, was a wealthy partner in Losh, Wilson and Bell, manufacturers of chemicals and iron. Many of the birds, especially the rarer species, were necessarily illustrated from skins rather than from life. For example, for the Sabine's snipe, \\"The author was favoured by N. A. Vigors, Esq., [who had described the supposed species] with a preserved specimen, from which the above figure is taken.\\" In A Memoir (posthumously published in 1862), Bewick states that he intended to \\"stick to nature as closely as I could\\", but admits that he had \\"in several cases\\" to rely on the stuffed \\"preserved skins\\" of his neighbour Richard Routledge Wingate. The grouping of species gave Bewick difficulty,Uglow, 2006. p. 249. as the scientific sources of the time did not agree on how to arrange the species in families, or on a sequence or grouping of those families. Bewick for example uses family groups like \\"Of the Falcon\\", in which he includes buzzards and sparrowhawks as well as what are now called falcons. The families of land birds are further grouped into birds of prey, omnivorous birds, insectivorous birds, and granivorous birds, while the families of water birds are simply listed, with what seemed to be related families, such as \\"Of the Anas\\" (ducks) and \\"Of the Mergus\\" (sawbill ducks), side by side. In this way the book takes the form of, and sets a precedent for, modern field guides. Indeed, the French naturalist Fran√ßois Holandre (1753‚Äì1830) assembled a field guide using Bewick's woodcuts as early as 1800. Each account is closed with a miniature woodcut known from its position in the text as a tail-piece. These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision. Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail- piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river. Outline=Land birds= Hanging washing with pigs and chickens: an uncaptioned tail-piece in Volume 1: Land Birds. Like many others, this has a humorous touch, with a bird leaving muddy footprints on a newly laundered shirt. The first volume \\"containing the History and Description of Land Birds\\" begins with a preface, an introduction, and a list of technical terms illustrated with Bewick's woodcuts. The introduction begins: > In no part of the animal creation are the wisdom, the goodness, and the > bounty of Providence displayed in a more lively manner than in the > structure, formation, and various endowments of the feathered tribes. The birds are divided into granivorous (grain eating) and carnivorous groups, which are explained in some detail. The speed, senses, flight, migration, pairing behaviour and feeding of birds are then discussed, with observations from Spallanzani and Gilbert White, whose Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne was published in 1789. The pleasure of watching birds is mentioned: > To the practical ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification in > being able to ascertain the distinguishing characters of birds as they > appear at a distance, whether at rest, or during their flight; for not only > every genus has something peculiar to itself, but each species has its own > appropriate marks, by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost > with certainty.Bewick, volume 1, Land Birds, 1847 edition. \\"Introduction\\". Great Bustard\\". A horseman and pair of greyhounds gallop after another bustard in the background. Bewick also mentions conservation, in the context of the probable local extinction of a valuable resource: \\"Both this and the Great Bustard are excellent eating, and would well repay the trouble of domestication; indeed, it seems surprising, that we should suffer these fine birds to be in danger of total extinction, although, if properly cultivated, they might afford as excellent a repast as our own domestic poultry, or even as the Turkey, for which we are indebted to distant countries.Bewick, volume 1, Land Birds, 2nd edition, 1847. \\"Little Bustard\\".\\" The 1847 edition, revised with additional woodcuts and descriptions, is organized as follows, with the species grouped into families such as the shrikes: =Water birds= Bird's eggs from sea-cliffs: uncaptioned tail-piece in Volume 2: Water Birds. Bewick has chosen a seabird theme, but humans are closely involved, and the birds are a useful resource. The second volume \\"containing the History and Description of Water Birds\\" begins with its own preface, and its own introduction. Bewick discusses the question of where many seabirds go to breed, revisits the subject of migration, and concludes with reflections on \\"an all-wise Providence\\" as shown in Nature. \\"The Heron. Common Heron, Heronsewgh, or Heronshaw. (Ardea cinerea, Lath.‚ÄîH√©ron cendr√©, Temm.)\\" woodcut The 1847 edition is organized as follows: ; Foreign Birds The 'foreign birds' are not grouped but just listed directly as species, from Bearded Vulture to Mino. Fifteen birds are included, with no description, and despite their placement in the table of contents, they appear at the front of the volume as an 'Appendix'. Reception Sparrow-Hawk\\" shows textures Bewick achieved with engraving tools on the end-grain of hard boxwood. In 1805, the British Critic wrote that it was \\"superfluous to expatiate much on the merits of a work\\" that everyone liked because of \\"the aptness of its descriptions, the accuracy of its figures, the spirit of its wood engravings, and the ingenious variety of its vignettes.\\" The 1829 Magazine of Natural History commented that \\"Montagu's Ornithological Dictionary and Bewick's Birds .. have rendered [the] department of natural history popular throughout the land\\". Ibis, reviewing the Memoir of Thomas Bewick, written by himself in 1862, compares the effect of Bewick and Gilbert White, writing \\"It was the pages of Gilbert White and the woodcuts of Bewick which first beguiled the English schoolboy to the observation of our feathered friends\\", and \\"how few of our living naturalists but must gratefully acknowledge their early debt to White's 'History' and to the life-like woodcuts of Bewick!\\" The reviewer judges that \\"Probably we shall not wrong the cultivated annalist of Selborne by giving the first place to Bewick.\\" However, comparing them as people, \\"Bewick has not the slightest claim to rank with Gilbert White as a naturalist. White was what Bewick never was, a man of science; but, if no naturalist, Bewick was a lover of nature, a careful observer, and a faithful copier of her ever-varying forms. In this, and in this alone, lies his charm.\\" The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannicas entry on Thomas Bewick describes \\"the British Birds\\" as \\"his great achievement, that with which his name is inseparably associated\\", observing that \\"Bewick, from his intimate knowledge of the habits of animals acquired during his constant excursions into the country, was thoroughly qualified to do justice to this great task.\\" British Birds, reviewing a \\"lavishly illustrated\\" British Library book on Bewick, writes that \\"No ornithologist will ever regard Thomas Bewick, known primarily for The History of British Birds (1797‚Äì1804), as a naturalist of the same standing as contemporaries such as Edward Donovan, John Latham and James Bolton\\", noting however that Bewick helped to define \\"a certain English Romantic sensibility\\". More directly, the review notes that \\"Bewick was aware that his role was to offer a modest guide to birds that the common man not only could afford but would also want to possess.\\" Bewick was not \\"a scientist, but he was a perfectionist\\". The book's text was written by \\"failed author\\" Ralph Beilby, but the text is \\"almost extraneous\\" given Bewick's masterpiece. The Tate Gallery writes that Bewick's \\" best illustrations ... are in his natural history books. The History of British Birds (2 vols, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1797‚Äì1804) reveals Bewick's gifts as a naturalist as well as an engraver (the artist was responsible for the text as well as the illustrations in the second volume).\\" The article notes that the book makes \\"extensive use of narrative tailpieces: vignettes in which manifold aspects of north-country life are expressed with affection, humour and a genuine love of nature. In later years these miniature scenes came to be more highly regarded than the figures they accompany.\\" Dissenting from the general tone of praise for Bewick, Jacob Kainen cites claims that \\"many of the best tailpieces in the History of British birds were drawn by Robert Johnson\\", and that \\"the greater number of those contained in the second volume were engraved by Clennell. Granted that the outlook and the engraving style were Bewick's, and that these were notable contributions, the fact that the results were so close to his own points more to an effective method of illustration than to the outpourings of genius.\\" Kainen argues that while competent, Bewick \\"was no Holbein, no Botticelli‚Äîit is absurd to think of him in such terms‚Äîbut he did develop a fresh method of handling wood engraving.\\" Yellow Wagtail\\" shows the bird in its habitat by fresh water, with a detailed illustration including figures in the background. The Linnean Society writes that the History \\"shows that he was also an excellent naturalist, a meticulous observer of birds and animals in their habitats.\\" The University of Maryland writes that \\"The Birds is specific to those species indigenous to Britain and is incredibly accurate due to Bewick's personal knowledge of the habits of birds in the wild acquired during his frequent bird-watching expeditions.\\" It adds that \\"Bewick's woodcarvings are considered a pinnacle example of the medium.\\" Jenny Uglow, writing in The Guardian, notes that \\"An added delight was the way he filled the blank spaces with 'tail-pieces', tiny, witty, vivid scenes of ordinary life.\\" She describes the importance of Birds in Jane Eyre, and ends \\"He worked with precision and insight, in a way that we associate with poets such as Clare and Wordsworth, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Elizabeth Bishop. To Bewick, nature was the source of joy, challenge and perpetual consolation. In his woodcuts of birds and animals as well as his brilliant tail-pieces, we can still feel this today.\\" However, in her biography of Bewick, she adds that \\"The country might be beautiful but it also stank: in his vignettes men relieve themselves in hedges and ruins, a woman holds her nose as she walks between the cowpats, and a farmyard privy shows that men are as filthy as the pigs they despise.\\"Uglow, 2006. p. 314. Hilary Spurling, reviewing Uglow's biography of Bewick in The Observer, writes that when Birds appeared, people all over Britain \\"became his pupils\\". Spurling cites Charles Kingsley's story of his father's hunting friends from the New Forest mocking him for buying \\"a book 'about dicky-birds\\", until, astonished, they saw the book and discovered \\"things they had known all their lives and never even noticed\\". John Brewer, writing in the London Review of Books, says that for his Birds, \\"Bewick had acquired national renown as the artist who most truthfully depicted the flora and fauna of the British countryside.\\" He adds that \\"Bewick's achievement was both technical and aesthetic.\\" In his view, Bewick \\"reconciled nature, science and art. His engravings of British birds, which represent his work at its finest, are almost all rendered with the precision of the ornithologist: but they also portray the animals in their natural habitat ‚Äì the grouse shelters in his covert, the green woodpecker perches on a gnarled branch, waders strut by streams ...\\" He observes that \\"Most of the best engravings include a figure, incident or building which draws the viewer's eye beyond and behind the animal profile in the foreground.

John Reed throws the History of British Birds at Jane when she is ten; Jane uses the book as a place to which to escape, away from the painful Reed household; and Jane also bases her artwork on Bewick's illustrations. Jane and Mr Rochester use bird names for each other, including linnet, dove, skylark, eagle, and falcon. Bront√´ has Jane Eyre explain and quote Bewick: > I returned to my bookBewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress > thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain > introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank. > They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of 'the solitary > rocks and promontories' by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, > studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to > the North Cape > Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy > isles Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy > Hebrides. partridge, showing a reaper finding he has just killed a bird sitting on its nest; the image inspired a scene in Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield. The English romantic poet William Wordsworth began his 1800 poem The Two Thieves; or, the Last Stage of Avarice with the lines > Oh now that the genius of Bewick were mine And the skill which he learned on > the banks of the Tyne. Then the Muses might deal with me just as they chose, > For I'd take my last leave both of verse and of prose. Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) contains a scene where the grandfather as a young man is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used the image on the title- page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).

It was a war between an indigenous African force drawn from a heterogeneous coalition of local peoples who rose against the French Army. At its height in 1916 the rebels mustered from 15,000‚Äì20,000 men and fought on several fronts. After about a year and several setbacks, the French army defeated the insurgents and jailed or executed their leaders but resistance continued until 1917. The war started after the 1915 rainy season when a group of representatives from around a dozen villages gathered at Bona where they resolved to take up arms against the French occupiers. This took place in the context of World War I and introduction of conscription for the French Army. There was also widespread optimism that the colonial government could be beaten at this moment of weakness. It went through various phases as the colonial army organised two suppression campaigns but initially failed in its purpose, in the face of fierce opposition and superior tactics. The Volta-Bani War is one of the most significant armed oppositions to colonial government anywhere in Africa. It was the main reason for the creation of the colony of Haute Volta (now Burkina Faso) after World War I, by splitting off seven districts from the large colony of Haut-S√©n√©gal and Niger. The name \\"Volta- Bani War\\" was coined in the book West African Challenge to Empire: Culture and History in the Volta-Bani War, which is an anthropological analysis and detailed description of these confrontations, on the basis of military archives documents and an elaborate understanding of the region based on ethnographic fieldwork and oral history. The book won the Amaury Talbot Prize of the Royal Anthropological Institute for 2002. A fictional account of the revolt was the subject of one of the important early literary works of West Africa, Nazi Boni's Cr√©puscule des temps anciens (1962).

Gerald McRaney was originally cast as Jack Long, with Larry Breeding co- starring as Neal Townsend. McRaney signed on for It's Not Easy when it appeared that his CBS detective series Simon & Simon was on the cancellation block. A test pilot was shot with McRaney and Breeding, and after ABC picked up the show, the project soon faced recasts. Shortly after ABC ordered episodes for the fall, CBS announced that Simon & Simon was renewed for the 1982-83 season, rendering McRaney unavailable. The producers then sought out a replacement while ABC moved It's Not Easy off the September schedule. By late in the summer, Ken Howard was chosen to replace McRaney. Plans were moving forward to shoot a second pilot when Larry Breeding was killed in a car accident on the Hollywood Freeway on September 28, 1982, and dealing with his loss preempted the show's development for several more months. It's Not Easy finally resurfaced on ABC's development slate in the spring of 1983, with Bert Convy taking over the role of Neal Townsend, and with a fall premiere date that year.

The accession to the throne was celebrated in several ceremonies, rites and feasts.  Origins  The Palermo stone The coronation feast was not one event but rather as a long lasting process including several festivals, rites and ceremonies lasting up to a full year. For this reason, Egyptologists today describe the year that a new pharaoh accessed to power as the \\"year of the coronation\\".Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt: Strategies, Society and Security. Routledge, London 2001, , p. 209 - 213.Siegfried Schott: Alt√§gyptische Festdaten (= Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur. Abhandlungen der Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaftlichen Klasse. Bd. 10, 1950, ). Verlag der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz u. a. 1950.Margaret Bunson: Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt. Infobase Publishing, 2009, , p. 87 - 89. The earliest depictions of rites and ceremonies concerning an accession to the throne may be found on objects from the reign of the predynastic king Scorpion II, circa 3100 BC. At this time, the change between rulers may have been marked by wars and invasions from neighboring Egyptian proto-kingdoms. This is similar to the military action taken by enemies of Egypt in later history: for example, upon hearing the news of Hatshepsut's death, the king of Kadesh advanced his army to Megiddo in the hope that Thutmose III would not be in a position to respond. From king Narmer (founder of the 1st Dynasty) onwards, wars between Egyptian proto-kingdoms may have been replaced by symbolic ceremonies and festivals.Winfried Barta: Thronbesteigung und Kr√∂nungsfeier als unterschiedliche Zeugnisse k√∂niglicher Herrschafts√ºbernahme. In: Studien zur alt√§gyptischen Kultur (SAK). 8, 1980, , p. 33‚Äì53. The most important sources of information about accessions to the throne and coronation ceremonies are the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, a black basalt stone slab listing the kings from the 1st Dynasty down to king Neferirkare Kakai, third pharaoh of the 5th Dynasty. The stone also records various events during a king's reign, such as the creation of statues, city and domain foundations, cattle counts and religious feasts such as the Sed festival. The stone also gives the exact date of a ruler's accession to the throne. The first year of a ruler on the throne, the \\"year of coronation\\", was not counted in a king's regnal year count, and the stone mentions only the most important ceremonies that took place in this year.  Ceremonies  As already mentioned, the coronation included several, long lasting festivals, rites and ceremonies the king had to celebrate first, before he or she was allowed to wear the crown(s) of Egypt. The following describes the most important ceremonies: The Narmer Palette, showing Narmer smiting an enemy and, on the reverse, the two serpopards. ;Unification of Upper and Lower Egypt The \\"unification of Upper and Lower Egypt\\" may have been connected with the traditional \\"smiting of the enemy\\" in predynastic times, a ritual in which the leader of the defeated realm was struck dead with a ceremonial mace by the victorious king. The most famous depiction of this ritual may be seen on the ceremonial palette of king Narmer. On the reverse of the palette, mythological and symbolic elements have been added to this picture: the two serpopards (leopards with unusually elongated necks) with entwined necks may symbolize a more peaceful unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. Another symbolic depiction of the unification feast appears on a throne relief dating to the reign of king Senusret I, second pharaoh of the 12th Dynasty. It shows the deities Horus and Seth wrapping a papyrus haulm and a lotus haulm around a trachea ending in a djed pillar, an act representing the enduring unification of the two lands under Senusret I. ;Circumambulation of the White Walls The ceremony of the \\"circumambulation of the White Walls\\" is known from the inscriptions on the Palermo stone. According to legends, the \\"White Walls\\", in Egyptian Inebu Hedj, today's Memphis, were erected by the mythical king Menes as the central seat of government of Egypt. The circumambulation of the walls of Memphis, celebrated with a ritual procession around the city, was performed to strengthen the king's right to the throne and his claim to the city as his new seat of power. ;Appearance of the king The feast \\"appearance of the king\\" is likewise known from inscriptions on the Palermo stone. This feast was held immediately after the coronation, as a confirmation of the king's right to rule. After the end of the year of the coronation, the feast was celebrated every second year. Much later Egyptian sources reveal that this feast comprised three steps: first was the \\"appearance of the King of Upper Egypt\\", in Egyptian khaj-nisut, then came the \\"appearance of the king of Lower Egypt\\", in Egyptian khaj-bitj, and finally the \\"appearance of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt\\", khaj-nisut-bitj. The earliest known mention of this feast dates back to king Djoser, first pharaoh of 3rd Dynasty. ;Sed feast Ebony year label of Den performing a ritual race part of his Sed festival. One of the most important feasts of Ancient Egypt linked with a king's time on the throne was the Sed festival, the heb-sed. It included many complex rituals, which are not fully understood up to this day and which are seldom depicted. The first celebration of the feast was held during the year of the coronation. After that, the next celebration was held in the 30th year of the pharaoh on the throne, and the Sed festival was thus named by the ancient Greeks as the Triakontaeteris, meaning \\"30-year-jubilee\\". After this jubilee, the Sed feast was normally celebrated every third year, although this rule was broken by various pharaohs, in particular Ramses II who celebrated a total of 14 Sed festivals in 64 years on the throne. Early dynastic rulers, for which at least one Sed feast is archaeologically attested, include Narmer, Den, Qa'a, Nynetjer and possibly Wadjenes. Rare depictions of rites associated to the Sed festival come from Old Kingdom reliefs found in galleries beneath Djoser's step pyramid at Saqqara, as well as from Dashur, dating to the reign of Sneferu (the founder of the 4th Dynasty). Some kings simply claimed to have celebrated a Sed festival, despite archaeological evidences proof that they did not rule for 30 years. Such kings include Anedjib (in the 1st Dynasty) and Akhenaten, in the 18th Dynasty. ;Sokar feast The \\"Sokar festival\\" is ‚Äì alongside the Sed festival ‚Äì one of the oldest festivals. It is already mentioned on predynastic artefacts and often mentioned on ivory labels belonging to the kings Scorpion II, Narmer, Aha and Djer. The early forms of this feast included the creation of a ceremonial rowing boat with a cult image of the god Sokar. The boat was then pulled by the king to a sacred lake or to the Nile. Another ritual was the erecting of a richly loaded djed-pillar. In early times, the feast was celebrated during the coronation in attempt to mark the (physical or symbolic) death of the predecessor, from 2nd dynasty onwards, the Sokar feast was repeated every sixth year, the fifth celebration coincided with the Sed festival. As far as is known, the ceremony of the Sokar feast was connected as well to the coronation of a new king as to the foundation of his future tomb. Sokar was the god of the underworld and one of the holy guardians of royal cemeteries. ;Suckling of the young king This ceremony was introduced during the 6th dynasty under king Pepy II who accessed to the throne aged 6. The \\"suckling of the young king\\" was never performed practically but rather represented through small figurines depicting the king as a naked toddler, sitting on the laps of the goddess Isis, being breastfed by her. This representation may have been created to ostentate the divine nature of the pharaoh. The king breastfed by Isis may have inspirated later Christian artists to create the Madonna and child portraits. Later pharaonic pictures show the king as a young man being breastfed by the holy Imat-tree.  Throne rights = Inheritance rights = The right to the throne of Egypt was normally inherited by direct filiation, the eldest son being the heir of his father. Occasionally the throne was inherited between brothers, for example from Djedefre to Khafra. It is worth mentioning a possible case of peaceful throne succession via interfamiliar negotiation which may have happened at the end of Nynetjer's rule. Because he possibly decided to separate Upper and Lower Egypt, he may have chosen two of his sons at the same time to rule over the two lands. A later example, namely that of Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai, may provide a case of dynastic problems between two separate but related royal houses. It is possible that one of Sahure's son, Shepseskare, tried to succeed his nephew Neferefre on throne after the latter died unexpectedly. This is likely to have created a dynastic feud as Nyuserre Ini, a son of Neferefre, finally assumed the throne only a few months later. The throne could also be obtained by marriage in case the only living heir was a woman as may have been the case from Sneferu to Khufu.Silke Roth: Die K√∂nigsm√ºtter des Alten √Ñgypten von der Fr√ºhzeit bis zum Ende der 12. Dynastie. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2001, . = Election = In this context, Egyptologists such as Sue D'Auria, Rainer Stadelmann and Silke Roth point to a problem mostly ignored by mainstream of scholars: There have demonstrably been crown princes, especially during the Old Kingdom period, who held the highest imaginable honorary and functionary titles at their lifetimes, but they never became kings, despite the fact, that they definitively survived their ruling fathers. Such known crown princes include: Nefermaat, Rahotep (both under the reign of Snofru), Kawab and Khufukhaf(crown princes of Khufu), Setka (crown prince of Radjedef) and, possibly, Kanefer. The famous vizir Imhotep, who held office under king Djoser, was even entitled as \\"twin of the king\\", but Djoser was followed by either Sekhemkhet or Sanakht, not by Imhotep. This leads to the question as what exactly happened during the election of the next throne successor and who of the royal family was allowed to raise any inheritance claims. It also remains unclear, who of the royal family was permitted to vote for the throne successor. The exact details of the election process are unknown, because they were never written down. Thus, no contemporary document explains as under which conditions a crown prince received inheritance rights and why so many crown princes were never crowned.Sue D'Auria: Offerings to the Discerning Eye: An Egyptological Medley in Honor of Jack A. Josephson. BRILL, Leiden 2010, , p. 296-300. Rainer Stadelmann points to an ancient society within the Egyptian elite, which existed as early as the predynastic time: the \\"Great Ten of Upper Egypt/Lower Egypt\\". These two societies consisted of altogether twenty elite officials of unknown origin, who possibly were responsible for the solving of any political and dynastic problem. Stadelmann explains, that most of all known, traditional offices were described in their missions and functions, except for the office \\"One of the Great Ten of...\\". And yet, this very title seemed to have been one of the most regarded and wanted, as only officials with many honorary titles were bearing it (for example, Hesyra). For this reason, Stadelmann and D'Auria believe, that the \\"Great Ten\\" consisted of some kind of royal court of justice.

They have outstanding mechanical properties at room temperature combining high strength (ultimate tensile strength of up to 800 MPa) and ductility (elongation to failure up to 100%) based on a high work-hardening capacity. TWIP steels have mostly high content in Mn (above 20% in weight %) and small additions of elements such C (<1 wt.%), Si (<3 wt.%), or Al (<3 wt.%). The steels have low stacking fault energy (between 20 and 40 mJ/m2) at room temperature. Although the details of the mechanisms controlling strain- hardening in TWIP steels are still unclear, the high strain-hardening is commonly attributed to the reduction of the dislocation mean free path with the increasing fraction of deformation twins as these are considered to be strong obstacles to dislocation glide. Therefore, a quantitative study of deformation twinning in TWIP steels is critical to understand their strain- hardening mechanisms and mechanical properties. Deformation twinning can be considered as a nucleation and growth process. Twin growth is assumed to proceed by co-operative movement of Shockley partials on subsequent {111} planes.  History  First steel based on plasticity induced by mechanical twinning was found in 1998 which had strength of 800 MPa with a total elongation of above 85%.Oliver Gr√§ssel and Georg Frommeyer, Effect of martensitic phase transformation and deformation twinning on mechanical properties of Fe‚ÄìMn‚ÄìSi‚ÄìAl steels, Material Science and Technology, Vol. 14 (1998) No. 12, pp. 1213-1216. These values vary with deformation temperature, strain rate and chemical composition.Georg Frommeyer, Udo Br√ºx and Peter Neumann, Supra-Ductile and High-Strength Manganese-TRIP/TWIP Steels for High Energy Absorption Purposes, ISIJ International, Vol. 43 (2003) pp. 438-446.Oliver Gr√§ssel, Lars Kr√ºger, Georg Frommeyer and Lothar Werner Meyer, High Strength Fe-Mn-(Al,Si) TRIP/TWIP Steels Development -Properties- Application, International Journal of Plasticity, Vol. 16 (2000), pp. 1391-1409. Researchers have shown that increased work hardening attributed to the partitioning of the austenite grains is the main contributing factor to the overall elongation of TWIP steels in which the mechanical strain of twinning have a rather small contribution.Bo Qin and Harshad Kumar Dharamshi Hansraj Bhadeshia, Plastic strain due to twinning in austenitic TWIP steels, Materials Science and Technology, Vol. 24 (2008) No. 8, pp. 969-973.  Compositions  TWIP steels usually contain large concentrations of Mn because it is crucial to preserve the austenitic structure based on the ternary system of Fe-Mn-Al Sato K, Tanaka K & Inoue, Determination of the a/g Equilibrium in the Iron Rich Portion of the Fe-Mn-Al System, ISIJ International, Vol. 29 (1989), pp. 788-792. and control Stacking Fault Energy (SFE) of the Iron-based alloys.P.Y.

Choi, Driving Force for Œ≥‚ÜíŒµ Martensitic Transformation and Stacking Fault Energy of Œ≥ in Fe- Mn Binary System, Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A, Vol. 31A (2000), pp. 355-360. The addition of aluminium to Fe-high Mn TWIP steels is because it increases SFE significantly and therefore stabilizes the austenite against phase transformations which can occur in the Fe-Mn alloys during deformation.Jianfeng Wan, Shipu Chen, T.Y. Hsu and Xu Zuyao, The stability of transition phases in Fe-Mn-Si based alloys, CALPHAD, Vol. 25 (2001) , pp. 355-362. Furthermore, it strengthens the austenite by solid-solution hardening.J. Charles, A. Bergh√©zan and A. Lutts, Structural and Mechanical Properties of High-Alloy Manganese-Aluminum Steels, Journal de Physique Colloques, Vol. 43 (1982), pp. C4-435.  Properties  Total and uniform elongation of the Fe‚Äì55Mn‚Äì3Al‚Äì3Si wt% TWIP steel as a function of the test temperature; strain rate Œµ=10‚àí4.s‚àí1. 0.2% proof and ultimate tensile strength of the Fe‚Äì55Mn‚Äì3Al‚Äì3Si wt% TWIP steel as a function of the test temperature; strain rate Œµ=10‚àí4.s‚àí1. Austenitic steels are used widely in many applications because of their excellent strength and ductility combined with good wear and corrosion resistance. High-Mn TWIP steels are attractive for automotive applications due to their high energy absorption, which is more than twice that of conventional high strength steels, and high stiffness which can improve the crash safety.

In a racing career which lasted from June 1967 until August 1968 he ran nine times and won six races. In 1967 he was unbeaten in three starts including the Gimcrack Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes and was officially rated the best two-year- old in Britain. In the following year he was defeated by Sir Ivor in the 2000 Guineas but won the St. James's Palace Stakes and the Sussex Stakes. He was then retired to stud where he proved to be a very successful stallion before his death at the age of eleven. Background Petingo was a big, powerfully- built bay horse with a white blaze and white socks on his hind legs. He was bred by Nicholas Hall's Pinfold Stud at Marthall, near Knutsford in Cheshire. He was sired by Petition, whose wins included the Eclipse Stakes and who was best known at stud for getting the outstanding filly Petite √âtoile. His dam, Alcazar was a French-bred daughter of the Ascot Gold Cup winner Alycidon and won one minor race at Newmarket Racecourse. As a descendant of the broodmare Straight Sequence, she came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 22 which produced Queenpot (1000 Guineas), Northjet (Prix Jacques Le Marois, Prix du Moulin) and Flying Paster. As a yearling Petingo was bought for 7,800 guineas by the veteran trainer Frederick Lakin \\"Sam\\" Armstrong, who had enjoyed his greatest success in the late 1940s with the classic winners My Babu and Sayajirao. Armstrong was acting on behalf of the Greek shipping company director Captain Marcos D. Lemos in whose royal blue and white colours the colt raced. The colt was trained by Armstrong at his St Gatien stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career=1967: two-year-old season= Petingo made his first racecourse appearance at Newmarket in June. In the Felix Leach Stakes he faced twenty other two-year-olds and won impressively by five lengths. After a break of two months he returned at York Racecourse in August when he was moved up in class to contest the Gimcrack Stakes (now a Group Two race). Ridden by Lester Piggott, Sam Armstrong's son-in-law, he was made the 7/4 favourite and won very easily by six lengths from Cheb's Lad. The form of the race was boosted when the runner-up won the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September. Only two horses appeared to oppose Petingo when he made his third and final appearance of the season in the Middle Park Stakes (now Group One) at Newmarket in October. With Piggott again riding, he won at odds of 1/4. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best British and Irish two- year-olds, Petingo was assigned top weight of 133 pounds, one pound ahead of Vaguely Noble. =1968: three-year-old season= Despite being offered the ride on Petingo, Piggott elected to ride the Irish-trained Sir Ivor in the 2000 Guineas. When Petingo appeared for the first time as a three-year-old he was ridden by Joe Mercer in the Craven Stakes (now Group Three) at Newmarket in April. He started at odds of 2/5 and won in \\"breathtaking\\" style by four lengths to take his unbeaten run to four. The 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance two weeks later saw Petingo made the 9/4 second choice in the betting behind Sir Ivor, who started the 11/8 favourite. Petingo and Joe Mercer moved past the front-running So Blessed to take the lead two furlongs from the finish but was overtaken by Sir Ivor in the closing stages. He finished second, beaten one and a half lengths with Jimmy Reppin taking third place. On his next appearance, Petingo was sent to France for the Prix Lupin over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Racing beyond a mile for the first and only time he finished unplaced behind Luthier. In June Petingo returned to England for the St James's Palace Stakes (now Group One) over one mile at Ascot Racecourse. Reunited with Piggott, he started the 10/11 favourite and won from Atopolis and Berber. A month later Petingo was sent to Goodwood Racecourse for the Sussex Stakes (now Group One), which at that time was restricted to three and four-year-olds. He led from the start and won by four lengths in what the Bloodstock Breeders' Annual Review described as \\"a majestic canter\\" at odds of 6/4 from World Cup, a colt who had won the Jersey Stakes at Ascot and went on to win the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in autumn. His winning time equaled the Goodwood course record. Petingo's last race was the Wills Mile (now Group Two), run in August over the same course and distance as the Sussex Stakes. He finished second when attempting to concede six pounds to Jimmy Reppin. Piggott reported that Petingo \\"was never going at any stage\\" and the colt was subjected to a post-race drug test. At this time it was announced that Lemos had sold a 90% stake in the horse to the Irish breeder Tim Rogers and would retire to stud at the end of the season. Assessment As noted above, Petingo was officially rated the best two-year- old in Britain in 1967 in a strong year. The independent Timeform organisation were even more impressed with the colt, giving him a rating of 135 which made him not only the season's best two-year-old, but the best horse of any age to race in Europe in 1967. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Petingo the nineteenth best British or Irish two-year-old of the 20th Century. Stud career Petingo had a successful but brief stud career in Ireland, completing seven full seasons as a breeding stallion before his death from a heart attack at the Simmonstown Stud, Celbridge, County Kildare in February 1976. His best winners included Satingo (Grand Crit√©rium), Miss Petard (Ribblesdale Stakes), Pitcairn (Wills Mile, sire of Ela-Mana-Mou) and English Prince (Irish Derby, sire of Sun Princess). Petingo's greatest success was posthumous. In 1978 his daughter Fair Salinia won The Oaks to give her sire his first British classic winner whilst Sandy Creek won the William Hill Futurity. His 1975 covering of a mare named La Milo resulted in a bay colt named Troy who won The Derby, Irish Derby, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes and the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup in 1979. Troy's achievements led to Petingo becoming that year's Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland. Petingo was also the damsire of Petoski and the sire of Three Legs who was exported to New Zealand where he sired the Japan Cup winner Horlicks.

Hugh 'Bulldog' Drummond. Plot Dr Stedman is murdered by an intruder in his study and two toy soldiers are stolen from his desk. The next day, Hugh Drummond reads about the murder in the newspaper. He is approached by a friend, Phillip Coleman, who tells him that he owns two similar figures and that he has received first offers, then threats to sell them. According to Coleman, the soldiers are 900 years old, dating back to the time of William the Conqueror. Coleman leaves the two painted lead figures with Drummond for safety and asks him to look into the affair. To flush out whoever is trying to get the figurines they plant a press story that Drummond has bought them from Coleman. When a woman, who introduces herself as journalist Estelle Gorday, visits Drummond's apartment, she recognizes the right figures out of a collection that Drummond has assembled on his mantle piece. Drummond and his friend Longworth then visit Stedman Manor and meet the daughter of the victim, Cynthia. She tells them that her father's figures were very similar to those brought by Drummond but different in detail and that they were part of a set of 13 soldiers that Dr Stedman bought at auction together with an Anglo-Saxon palimpsest. He was translating that when he was killed and the scroll was also taken. Dr Stedman was convinced that the statues were exceedingly valuable and he received an offer to buy them from a man called Vane. Vane offered a multiple of what Stedman has paid and left very angry when rejected. Drummond and Longworth follow an invitation by Ms Gorday. While they are there, Vane breaks into Drummond's apartment and steals the two soldiers. Coleman and Seymour, another friend of Drummond's, shadow him to a Soho flat. Seymour fetches Drummond and they return to Soho. Drummond and Longworth go up. A knife is thrown at them and they find Vane dead and the soldiers missing. The next day, Drummond and his friends are at Inspector McIver's office when Ms Stedman identifies the dead man as Vane. Drummond visits Gorday and tells her that he smelled her perfume at the Soho flat. He searches her place and finds the palimpsest. She admits to working for Vane, who was a collector who owned the other soldiers. Drummond next shows the palimpsest to Ms Stedman in the presence of Coleman. He tells them that he has done research on the soldiers: the figurines show the 13 last leaders of the Anglo-Saxons before the Norman Conquest. Before being defeated, King Harold hid his treasure at a manor near London and had the parchment with a map and instructions written, whilst the figures served as the cipher/key to find the hiding place. After the battle of Hastings, the soldiers were dispersed. Monks overwrote the parchment and the original writing was only rediscovered by Dr Stedman. Drummond, Cynthia Stedman and Coleman go to the spot shown on the map. The current house dates to King George I and is occupied by an antiques store. Inside, they discover a medieval fireplace and walls. When they inquire about the soldiers, the store owner asks them to leave. Later, Ms Gorday visits Drummond and threatens him with a gun, demanding the palimpsest. She admits to being the daughter of the shop keeper, Mr Prager. He owns the other nine soldiers and wants the four others and the palimpsest. Prager and his daughter hired Vane to find them but were horrified when he killed Dr Stedman. She admits to being at Soho and to throwing the knife at Drummond. Ms Stedman comes to the store with the parchment, shadowed by Seymor and Longworth. They wait outside and meet Ms Gorday/Prager and Drummond when they arrive. Entering, they find Prager dead. Drummond discovers Coleman with all 13 soldiers inside the shop. Coleman attacks but is overpowered. They call the police and find Cynthia, who said Coleman had asked her to come and that she had been hit on the head on arrival. Drummond arranges the soldiers on a pedestal just like in the drawing and their weight distribution opens a secret door. They find the treasure. The arriving McIver takes a figure, causing the stone door to start closing. Coleman tries to flee but is shot and then trapped and crushed by the door. The others manage to leave the secret room when the figure is replaced. Cast * Tom Conway as Capt.

Haller played with Wayne County & the Electric Chairs, The Flying Lizards, The Lords of the New Church, Paint and Savage Republic. He was half of the duo Autumnfair. Career Haller grew up in the west of England. An orphan, he was raised by a minister and his wife. Haller's first venture into the music industry was promoting a Roxy Music in Chippenham July 1972. He had the foresight to book the band for low fee when they were unknown, By the time the date arrived they were well-known and it was a great success. Haller moved to London and in 1975 formed the Rockets, recruiting guitarist Andy Colquhoun, later of the Pink Fairies. Haller was a founding member of Wayne County & the Electric Chairs, and the one constant member through the band's history. As part of the burgeoning punk scene the band were subject to gobbing and were forced to take a brief hiatus after Haller developed hepatitis as the result of a direct hit into his mouth. Wayne County and The Electric Chairs released an EP Electric Chairs 1977, plus a single on Illegal Records. This was followed by \\"Fuck Off\\"/\\"on The Crest\\", recorded as a single for Safari Records and supported with a European tour. In 1978 the band released their first, self-titled album, as well as an EP, Blatantly Offensive'. The band performed the song 'Paranoia Paradise' in the movie Jubilee by Derek Jarman. Prior to the band's third album, Haller bought a synthesizer and began learning it. In subsequent rehearsal sessions with the group he would often opt to play synthesizer or Farfisa organ instead of bass. After the band's third album, County departed, returning to the US. The Electric Chairs continued as a 3-piece of Haller (bass, keyboards, vocals), Henri Padovani (guitars, vocals) and J. J. Johnson (drums, percussion). A single, \\"So Many Ways\\" (on which Haller took lead vocals) / \\"J'attends Les Marines\\", was released in late 1979. The record, produced by David Cunningham, took a more electronic and atmospheric direction. However the band couldn't sustain themselves commercially, and fell out with management and label. The three former Electric Chairs then formed a new group, the Mystere Five's, with vocalist/guitarist Chris Reeves and non-musician Marc \\"Frenchy\\" Gloder. A single, \\"No Message\\"/\\"Shake Some Action\\", launched Gloder's label Flicknife Records. A second single, \\"Never Say Thank You\\"/\\"Heart Rules The Head\\" soon followed. Both were well received but by 1980 the band moved on to other projects. Haller contributed synthesizer to the Flying Padovanis debut single \\"Western Pasta\\"/\\"Vas Plus Haut\\", released in 1981 and formed Paint with vocalist Jonathan Hughston. Paint never took off and Haller was soon recruited by The Lords of the New Church to play keyboards on a tour. On his return he joined Johnson in The Flying Lizards, playing bass on two songs on the 1981 Fourth Wall album, \\"In My Lifetime\\" and \\"A Train\\". Haller relocated to Los Angeles in 1983, working as a motorcycle messenger to get by. Within a couple of years he hooked up with Thom Fuhrmann of Savage Republic to form the duo Autumnfair, who were accompanied by a revolving line up of Savage Republic associates. The band ceased operating in 1989, however a 10\\" EP Glaciers And Gods was released in 1991. In 2002, an Autumnfair retrospective CD Autumnfair ‚Äì 1986 - 1989 was released. In 2007, Haller joined a reformed Savage Republic. An EP Siam was released, followed by an album 1938 and the band toured widely including the North East United States, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Poland and Greece. In March 2010, Fuhrmann stated that AutumnFair would return to the studio to record. Death Haller passed away in Claremont, California on December 16th 2012.

He is mainly known for his duet with Desireless, French pop star of the 80s (\\"Voyage, Voyage\\"). His work is a bridge between different worlds: from classical music to electro & pop, through progressive, symphonic, dark & experimental music.  Biography  Influenced by bands such as King Crimson, Gentle Giant and Robert Wyatt, he created at the end of the 90s his first band, Thork, and produced a first album (Urdoxa, 2000). In 2006, Antoine Aureche created his acoustic project TAT, which allowed him to sign with the Swiss label Urgence Disk Records and to produce three albums (Quinta Essentia, 2006, Le Sperme De Tous Les M√©taux, 2007, and Testament, 2010). The purpose of TAT is experimental: to make a musical alchemy. Through this project, TAT collaborated with several underground artists such as Le Chiffre, Vx69 of Punish Yourself, Laurie Lipton & Laurent Courau from the Adobe Of Chaos. In 2008, Antoine created Operation Of The Sun, which allowed him to play a music which he had never played up to now: dancefloor electro music. Antoine produced a retrofuturistic debut album, Solar Squirrels Exodus, in 2009, and D√©sir Parabolique in 2011. This project led him to collaborate with new artists, such as Greta Gratos & The Eternal Afflict. In 2011, Antoine also met Desireless, and decided to create with her a new duet called Desireless & Operation of the sun. This project, like a bridge between pop and underground music, was supported by many collaborators such as Solar Fake, The Eternal Afflict, Oil 10, BAK XIII, Psyche. Since then, Antoine plays guitars and sings in concert with Desireless all over Europe (shows in Russia, Germany, Slovakia, Belarus, Belgium, Switzerland & France), from festivals (Wave Gotik Treffen, Montereau Confluences, W-Festival) to 80's shows (the duet has shared the top line of posters with Peter Hook of Joy Division, Front 242, Anne Clark, Human League, Thomas Anders of Modern Talking, Lio, Sabrina, Samantha Fox, Sandra). In 2018, Antoine started using a new pseudonym: Valfeu. As Valfeu, he released an electronic symphony, Faust, based on Goethe's tragedy. He worked on it with Sue Denim of Robots In Disguise, Desireless, Cheerleader 69, Titend & Music for the space. In February 2019, TAT evolutes and becomes Tat Resurrectio. With Tat Resurrectio, Antoine plays a new neo-folk show (featuring Le Chiffre, Nevah & Diabolus in Viola) as supporting act for Brendan Perry of Dead Can Dance. The city of Lyon (France) recognizes him as an official artist of the program \\"40 ans de Musiques Actuelles √† Lyon\\".  Hohner endorsement  Antoine Aureche was endorsed by Hohner in 2014 and he plays the G3T Hohner guitar.

Bouetel and C. Muizon. 2006. The anatomy and relationships of Piscobalaena nana (Cetacea, Mysticeti), a Cetotheriidae s.s. from the early Pliocene of Peru At least some individuals of this diminutive whale were preyed on by the shark C. megalodon.  Description  Skull This animal looked much like whales today, particularly small whales. The length was probably less than , and the skull of an adult was about one meter. Piscobalaena is known for some well-preserved specimens, including three young individuals and an adult. Some characteristics of the skull distinguish Piscobalaena from modern whales (such as the shape of the supraorbital process).  Classification  Described for the first time in 1989 by Pilleri and Siber,Pilleri, G. and Siber, H.J. 1989. Neuer Sp√§tterti√§rer cetotherid (Cetacea, Mysticeti) aus der Pisco-Formation Perus. In: G. Pilleri (ed.), Beitr√§ge zur Pal√§ontologie der Cetaceen Perus, 109‚Äì115. Hirnanatomisches Institut, Ostermundigen, Bern. Piscobalaena is known from fossils found in the Pisco Formation in Peru. Piscobalaena is considered a representative of Cetotheriidae a group of baleen whales with primitive characteristics similar to that of Balaenoptera, fossil species of which have been found mainly in the northern hemisphere. The closest relative of Piscobalaena appears to have been Herpetocetus, from the Mio-Pliocene of the northern hemisphere.  Palaeogeography  Other fragmentary remains attributed to Piscobalaena are also from Peru, but date a little older (late Miocene, about 10 million years ago). So it seems that this kind of whales were located in the Pacific coast of South America and evolved for at least five million years. Other fossils attributed with some doubt to Piscobalaena come from the Miocene Bone Valley Formation of Florida: If so, then Piscobalaena might have had a wider distribution than the Peruvian coast. This could have been because the Isthmus of Panama was open until at least Late Pliocene, allowing the passage of marine species from the Atlantic to the Pacific and vice versa. Other marine mammals found in the Pisco Formation include the odd dolphin Odobenocetops, the long-necked seal Acrophoca, and aquatic sloth Thalassocnus.

In 1988, prices started at about $2000, and went to $12,000+ for the 2467 with MCP CRT, all with 2 to 4 channels. Weight went from a light 3.5 lbs for the diminutive 212 all the way to 24 lbs for the 2467. These scopes come in many different models and the differences between them are not obvious.  500 series = 501 oscilloscope = The first number \\"5\\" stood for the screen's diameter, \\"01\\" indicated the first model. The early 501 contained advanced circuitry but it was too big and heavy on the bench. That was not enough to compete against the \\"big\\" competitors like Dumont, RCA, Varian, General Electric(?). Tektronix realized these drawbacks, and introduced the model 511 (designed by Howard Vollum, Milt Bave and others) = 511 oscilloscope  547 oscilloscope = The 547 was perhaps the most popular of the large size, valve type oscilloscopes. It was a single beam oscilloscope costing $1875 in 1968. The 547 was made popular largely because of the innovative \\"ALT\\" mode, which allowed for dual traces to be shown on a single beam oscilloscope, providing much of the functionality of dual-beam scopes for a fraction of the added cost. It was of interest to many users to be able to see more than one electrical signal on the screen at the same time, so they could be easily compared. There were two methods of doing this. One was a dual-beam oscilloscope. This was a very expensive approach, as two of everything was required. Tektronix oscilloscopes like this were the 502, 551, 555, and 556. Some of these had two time bases and two sets of horizontal deflection plates, so the horizontal scan of the two beams could be synchronized (triggered) separately from the other. Another way to do the same thing was to use an electronic switch in front of the vertical system in a single beam oscilloscope. This is called a \\"dual trace\\" oscilloscope. The switch worked to display 2 or 4 separate electrical signals on the screen. This required little duplication and added only a small amount to the cost. This is the technique used in all the dual and four-trace plug-ins such as the CA, 1A1, 1A2, Type M and 1A4.  2000 series  Tektronix 2235A The first 2000-series Tektronix oscilloscopes were introduced in the 1982 catalog. New models available that year were the 2213, 2215, 2335, 2336, and 2337. They offered excellent portability along with light weight and low power consumption. Very rugged, they were rated to withstand 50g. Most of this was due to the simplification of circuit design, and a lightweight switching power supply. They were significantly lighter than the 400-series. These early models were limited in bandwidth, but in 1984, that changed with the introduction of the 2465 and little brother, the 2445. Both models had 4 channels, but the 2465 bandwidth was 300 MHz, with triggering to match. Completely micro-processor driven and firmware controlled, these were a new breed, similar in appearance but not otherwise related to the 2200 scopes. By 1989, the 2465B had 400 MHz bandwidth with triggering beyond 500 MHz. The peak of the 2000-series seems to be in 1984, when there were no less than 21 models introduced for a total of 33 models offered. The 2430, the 2432A, the 2465B and the 2467B lasted until 1996. By the 1997 catalog, there were no longer 2000-series listed. Indicating a long 14 year production run. The main differences between the non-storage, non-digital analog 2200 series are as follows: the 2200 series is mostly 2 channel, with 2245, 2246, 2247, and 2252 being the 4 channel exceptions (the two extra channels having only two vertical attenuation values). The 2335 and 2336 are 2 channel, ruggedized versions mostly made for the military. The 2400 series are 4 channel, 2 of the channels having full attenuators. Otherwise, the main difference is bandwidth. The 2200 series is 20 - 100 MHz. The 2400 series starts out at 150 MHz (2445, 2445A) but goes up with the 2445B; 150 MHz for early units, 200 MHz for late units. The 2465 has a bandwidth of 300 MHz, the 2465A 350 MHz, the 2465B 400 MHz. The 2467 is a special case, having a micro-channel plate (MCP) CRT. This oscilloscope offers extremely high speed writing, making one-shot pulses at nanosecond duration visible in normal room light. In that aspect it was the only non-storage CRT to be able to do this. The same type of crt was used in the 7104. = Year introduced = Years in which the various models were introduced according to the Tektronix catalogs: * 1982: 2213, 2215, 2335, 2336, 2337 (first models) * 1983: (no new models) * 1984: 2235, 2236, 2445, 2465 * 1985: 2213A, 2215A, 2235L, 2236/01, 2465CTS, 2465DMS, 2465DVS * 1986: 2220, 2230, 2430 * 1987: 2225, 2245, 2246, 2430M, 2445A, 2455A, 2465A, 2465A-CT and -DM and -DV, 2467 * 1988: 2235/01, 2246/1Y, 2430A * 1989: 2201, 2205, 2210, 2245A, 2246A, 2246/1Y, 2247A, 2402, 2432A, 2440, 2465B, 2445B, 2465BCT, 2465BDM, 2465BDV, 2467B * 1990: 2211, 2232, 2235A, 2235A/01, 2235L, 2236A, 2431L * 1991: 2221A, 2252, 2402A, 2439, 2467BHD By 1994, the decline had started, no new 2000 models being listed after that, and by 1996, only the 2430A, 2440, 2465B, and 2467B were being offered. The TDS series had completely replaced the 2000 series. The 2247 and 2252 are very similar. The difference is that the 2252 has printing and programmable setups, useful in many applications. Both are excellent scopes. Oscilloscopes with cursors include the 2246, 2252, and all of the 2400 series (2445, 2465, 2467). Cursors allow doing measurements that are independent of the graticule. With a cursor-equipped scope, the user can accurately and quickly measure, as a minimum, voltage, time, and frequency of all or parts of the waveform. Accuracy varies, but even the most basic cursors give more accurate results than taking readings from the graticule. The TAS 465, an inexpensive analog 100 MHz scope, also has a cursor system. The 2445, 2465 and 2467 have an option called CTT, which links a highly accurate frequency counter with the cursor and readout system. The storage scopes go even further with various systems of parameter extraction. Because the waveform is a slice of time, digitized and stored in the scope's memory, the scope can work on that one set of data. In a flash, as many as twenty parameters, or attributes, of the signal can be derived and displayed on the screen. Scopes that can do parameter extraction may also be able to communicate to a computer over a GPIB setup, and do even more advanced math on the waveform. These include the 2430, 2432, and 2440 digital storage oscilloscopes.  2400 series  The Tektronix 2400 Series oscilloscopes were perhaps the most powerful instruments of their time, with the 2445, 2465, and 2467 being the top-end models and the 2430 series of digitizing storage oscilloscopes providing digital storage. They combined high bandwidth and sampling rates with automation features and waveform processing capabilities. In 1991, four models were available: 2430A, 2431L, 2432A, and 2440. Together with the 2402 and a PC, they constitute a complete waveform processing and analysis system. =Models= * 2430A: sampling rate 100 MS/sec, bandwidth 150 MHz * 2431L: sampling rate 250 MS/sec, bandwidth 300 MHz (no delay sweep, no glitch capture, limited AUTO SETUP) * 2432A: sampling rate 250 MS/sec, bandwidth 300 MHz * 2439: sampling rate 500 MS/sec, bandwidth 300 MHz (no delay sweep, no glitch capture, limited AUTO SETUP) * 2440: sampling rate 500 MS/sec, bandwidth 300 MHz * 2445: analog scope, bandwidth 150 MHz * 2445B: analog scope, bandwidth 200 MHz * 2465: analog scope, bandwidth 300 MHz * 2465A: analog scope, bandwidth 350 MHz * 2465B: analog scope, bandwidth 400 MHz * 2467: analog scope, bandwidth 350 MHz * 2467B: analog scope, bandwidth 400 MHz = Options = The important oscilloscope options are: * 01 - Digital Multimeter * 03 - Word Recognizer Probe Pod (P6407) * 05 - Video Waveform Measurement System * 06 - Counter/Timer/Trigger (CTT) * 09 - Counter/Timer/Trigger (CTT) with Word Recognizer (WR) * 10 - GPIB Interface * 11 - Probe Power * 1E - External Clock * 22 - Two additional Probes * 1R - Prep for rack mounting kit = TekMate 2402 and 2402A= The 2402 TekMate instrument extension is really an IBM clone computer that uses the oscilloscope as both keyboard and monitor. The 2402 has two floppy drives, the 2402A could be had with a hard drive in place of the second floppy. The 2402 communicates with the scope on the GPIB bus, and will transfer waveform data, programs and front panel setups both directions. Waveforms can be stored on floppy disks, processed by software in the 2402, and reloaded into the scope for display. As many waveforms can be stored as one has disks to store them on! The processor in the 2402 is an Ampro LittleBoard/PC running the NEC V40 CPU at 7.16 MHz. The processor in the 2402A is an Ampro LittleBoard/286 running at 16 MHz. They each come with about 1M of RAM. ;Keyboard A standard IBM PC/XT keyboard can be plugged into the 2402. The 2402A requires a PC/AT keyboard. It does not appear to be necessary however. All functions can be executed from menus on the oscilloscope itself. ;Monitor The 2402 had a 9-pin female connector for a CGA monitor. The 2402A had an EGA card. =Probes= Supplied probe was the P6137, a highly sophisticated probe featuring 10X, 400 MHz bandwidth with readout capability and auto setup activation =Printers and plotters= HC100 Color Plotter. The HC100 is a four-color plotter designed to make waveform plots directly from the Tektronix 2430-series oscilloscopes. It does not require an intervening controller. Under program control from the instrument attached by a GPIB cable, front panel commands can be used to plot digitally stored waveforms and printouts of instrument setup information. They are sometimes for sale, but do not always have the required GPIB interface. HC200 Dot Matrix Printer. This unit can be used to produce waveform plots as well as capturing setup information. It can be attached directly to the scope with a printer cable, so a GPIB is not required.  7000 series  The 7000 series, a high end modular oscilloscope family, was introduced in the early 1970s. The series included a readout system that would display the plug in's settings on the CRT. Some conventional single-beam oscilloscope models were the 7603 ($2,700 in 1983), 7704, 7704A (250-MHz BW, $4,260), 7904 (500-MHz BW, $8,910), 7904A, and 7104 (1-GHz BW with high brightness for single shot events, $20,160). The last digit of the model number indicated the number of plug in slots the mainframe had. The 7844 ($12,665 in 1983) was a dual-beam 400-MHz BW oscilloscope. The series also included some storage scopes: 7613 (variable persistence, $5,025 in 1983), 7623, 7633 (100-MHz BW, $7,765), and 7834 (400-MHz BW, $11,705). The series also wandered into digital oscilloscope territory. The 7854 waveform processing oscilloscope ($13,750 in 1983) could function as both an analog or a digital oscilloscope with GPIB. The 7612D programmable waveform digitizer ($26,400 in 1983) and the 7912AD programmable transient waveform digitizer ($24,800) were GPIB digitizers that did not have a display. The 7000 series had an extensive collection of plug ins. The 7Ann plug ins were amplifiers. The 7A18A was a 75-MHz, 1-Mohm, 5-mV/div, dual-trace amplifier ($1,180 in 1983). The 7A26 was similar but had a 200-MHz bandwidth ($1,910); the 7A29 ($2,530) was a 1-GHz, 50-ohm, single-channel amplifier. The series included differential amplifiers. The 7A22 differential amplifier ($1500 in 1983) had only a 1-MHz bandwidth, but its most sensitive range was 10-¬µV/div. The 7A13 differential comparator ($2,865 in 1983) has a 105-MHz bandwidth. The 7A13 differential comparator amplifier can subtract a DC voltage from the input and amplify around that voltage, a feature unknown to modern digital scopes. Looking at voltage rails is a situation where the 7000 series still shows off. For example, one could subtract the nominal core voltage (e.g. 1.1 V) and set the amplifier to 1 mV/div (finest) and see the quality of a processor's core voltage supply in detail. The 7Bnn plug ins were intended as time bases. There were several choices to match the mainframe's bandwidth. Two time base plug ins could communicate to obtain a delayed sweep feature (e.g., 7B80 and 7B85, $1,335 and $1,605 in 1983). Some time base plug ins included a delayed sweep in one module, such as the 7B53A or 7B92A ($1,430 and $3,175 in 1983). There were several digital or meter plug ins (7Dnn). For the first time in commercially available oscilloscopes, the 7000 series had a digital read-out system, so a plug in could display its settings or display the value of a measurement on the CRT. The 7D11 ($2,915 in 1983) was a digital delay, the 7D15 ($3,020) was a 225 MHz counter/timer, the 7D13 ($1,105) was a multimeter, and the 7D12/M2 ($2,815) was a sample-and-hold with an analog-to-digital converter. More exotic digital plug ins used the mainframe oscilloscope as a mere display unit. The 7D01 and 7D02 were logic analyzer plug ins. The triple- wide 7D20 programmable digitizer with GPIB ($7,750 in 1983) would turn an analog mainframe into a digital scope. The series also had some sampling technology plug ins, and many plug ins of this group used the S-series sampling and pulse generator heads. (The S-series sampling heads were used in the Tektronix 560-series sampling plug ins such as the 3S2, 3S5, 3S6). The 7S11 sampling unit ($1,780) was intended for a mainframe's vertical axis slot; it would take an S-series head, and that head would determine the bandwidth. The S-1 sampling head ($1,160 in 1983) had a 1 GHz bandwidth; the S-4 sampling head ($2,665) had a 25 ps risetime 12.4 GHz bandwidth traveling-wave sampler. The 7S11 would work in combination with the 7T11 ($4,460 in 1983) or 7T11A sampling sweep units as a time base. The 7T11 could trigger on a 1 GHz signal or it could synchronize to a 1 GHz to 12.4 GHz input. The 7S12 TDR/Sampler ($3,390 in 1983) was a double-wide time domain reflectometry plug in; it needed both a sampling head (such as the S-6 30 ps risetime 11.5 GHz pass through sampler, $2,295 in 1983) and a pulse generator (such as the S-52 25 ps risetime tunnel diode generator, $1,655 in 1983). The 7S12 could also perform as a sampling scope with a sampling head and a trigger recognizer head (S-53). The 7S14 dual trace delayed sweep sampler ($5,235 in 1983) was a complete 1 GHz sampler that did not use any S-series sampling heads. There were also a curve tracer plug in, the 7CT1N ($1,385 in 1983), and spectrum analyzer plug ins (e.g., 7L5, 7L12, 7L13, 7L14, 7L18). Combining a 7000-series storage oscilloscope mainframe with a non-storage spectrum analyzer plug in (7L12, 7L13) allowed a slow sweep with a display that did not fade away. The 7L5, 7L14 and 7L18 had their own internal digital storage and were capable of showing a stable display even when used in non-storage mainframes. GPIB bus In 1965, Hewlett-Packard designed the Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus ( HP-IB ) to connect their line of programmable instruments to their computers. Because of its high transfer rate at the time (nominally 1 Mbytes/s), this interface bus quickly gained popularity. It was later accepted as IEEE Standard 488-1975, and has evolved to ANSI/IEEE Standard 488.1-1987. Today, the name General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) is more widely used than HP-IB. ANSI/IEEE 488.2-1987 strengthened the original standard by defining precisely how controllers and instruments communicate. Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI) took the command structures defined in IEEE 488.2 and created a single, comprehensive programming command set that is used with any SCPI instrument. Many Tektronix instruments, including the 2430-series oscilloscopes, are available with GPIB interface cards.

This was the first New Year Honours since the accession of Queen Elizabeth II. The Honours list is a list of people who have been awarded one of the various orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom. Honours are split into classes (\\"orders\\") and are graded to distinguish different degrees of achievement or service, most medals are not graded. The awards are presented to the recipient in one of several investiture ceremonies at Buckingham Palace throughout the year by the Sovereign or her designated representative. The orders, medals and decorations are awarded by various honours committees which meet to discuss candidates identified by public or private bodies, by government departments or who are nominated by members of the public. Depending on their roles, those people selected by committee are submitted to Ministers for their approval before being sent to the Sovereign for final approval. As the \\"fount of honour\\" the monarch remains the final arbiter for awards. In the case of certain orders such as the Order of the Garter and the Royal Victorian Order they remain at the personal discretion of the Queen.

After his retirement, he became a well-known botanist. Early years Paul Cousturier was born on 14 April 1849 in Montereau, Seine-et-Marrte. His brother Edmond Cousturier was a painter and art critic, who married the artist Lucie Cousturier on 6 January 1901. Paul Cousturier entered the colonial administration in August 1885. On 16 August 1885 he was appointed Chief of the Administrative Secretariat of the French Establishments in the Gulf of Guinea under No√´l Ballay. On 24 October 1887 Cousturier was named sous-chef of the interior of the colony, where he introduced the colonial administration. He followed Ballay to Rivi√®res du Sud, and with him explored the Conakry region, where the city of Conakry was established in 1889. He assisted Ballay in delimiting the boundary between Rivi√®res du Sud and Sierra Leone. French Guinea In December 1891, Cousturier was named governor of Guinea, replacing Ballay. He was acting governor of the Rivi√®res du Sud region, now Guinea, between October 1891 and January 1892. He was again acting governor of Guinea from 22 July 1892 to June 1893 during the absence of No√´l Ballay. He was governor of Guinea again between 1895 and 1896, and was made acting governor of Guinea again in 1898. On 3 November 1900 he was named governor of French Guinea, holding this post until November 1904. The sixth annual Agricultural fair was held in Conakry on 15 February 1902. Alfa Yaya, chief of the province of Lab√© came to pay homage to governor Cousturier accompanied by more than 1,000 men and sixty horses. In 1902 Cousturier established a line of six customs posts from Dankaldou to Kolodougou along the Liberian border. Later career When he returned to France in November 1904 he had spent twenty years in Africa, apart from four leaves totaling twenty one months. He left for Saint Pierre and Miquelon the same month. He was governor of St Pierre and Miquelon for a year after leaving Guinea. After his retirement he devoted himself to botany, making long trips in which he explored the mountains of Corsica, Crete and Andorra. He became a member of the Botanical Society of France in 1911. Paul Cousturier joined the Soci√©t√© d'histoire naturelle de Toulon in 1912. He died on 27 July 1921 at Aix-en-Provence. His botanical collections and his correspondence with his colleague, the Abb√© Michel Gandoger, were kept by the University of Provence in Marseille.

Launch BILSAT-1 was launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome Site 132/1, Arkhangelsk Oblast in Russia by a Kosmos-3M space launch vehicle on September 27, 2003 at 06:12 UTC in a multiple- satellite payload launch along with six other satellites, namely Mozhayets-4 and Larets of Russia, NigeriaSat-1 of Nigeria, UK-DMC from the United Kingdom, South Korean STSAT-1 and Germany's Rubin 4-DS. It was placed in a polar, circular, sun-synchronous geocentric orbit at an altitude of with orbital parameters as period 98.5 min, apogee , perigee and inclination 98.2¬∞. Mission One of the four spacecraft of the DMC project, which is an organization for international space program cooperation formed by seven countries, namely United Kingdom, Algeria, China, Nigeria, Thailand, Vietnam and Turkey, BILSAT-1 was dedicated to studies on agriculture, forestry, hydrology, land cover/use and mapping, environment as well as urban area development. It was built at a cost of $14 million. The first images were from Cape Town, South Africa taken on October 18, Gulf of ƒ∞skenderun, Turkey taken on October 30 and Kuwait City taken on November 6, 2003. BILSAT-1 ended its mission in August 2006 due to battery cells failure. Payloads Turkey's first indigenously developed scientific microsatellite for remote sensing, BILSAT-1 was based on an enhanced SSTL-100 satellite bus. The satellite features a multi-spectral instrument called √áOBAN, which is a low-resolution 8-channel camera. The name is an abbreviation for \\"√áOk-BANtlƒ± Kamera\\" for \\"Multi-Band Camera\\". It has two imaging sensors, a 4-band visible and near- infrared (VNIR) sensor at a resolution of and a high-resolution panchromatic sensor at . The swath widths were for the VNIR and for the panchromatic sensor. The sensors had a 4-day repeat cycle. BILSAT-1 hosted a real time image compression module named GEZGIN, an abbreviation for \\"GEr√ßek Zamanda G√∂r√ºnt√º ƒ∞≈üleyeN\\", which is a digital signal processor using JPEG 2000 algorithm to compress images taken by the satellite. Further payloads are on board propulsion, GPS navigation device, a GPS attitude receiver and a control moment gyroscope. BILSAT-1 also hosted new technologies such as high-capacity solid-state data recorders and star trackers.

One late source lists seven. The sacred tokens most commonly regarded as such were the Palladium, the wooden image of Minerva (Greek Athena) that the Romans claimed had been rescued from the fall of Troy and was in the keeping of the Vestals; the sacred fire of Vesta tended by the Vestals, which was never allowed to go out; and the ancilia, the twelve shields of Mars wielded by his priests, the Salii, in their processions, dating to the time of Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome.Ovid, Fasti 3.422; Geraldine Herbert-Brown, Ovid and the Fasti: An Historical Study (Oxford University Press, 1994), pp. 76‚Äì77; R. Joy Littlewood, A Commentary on Ovid's Fasti, Book 6 (Oxford University Press, 2006) pp. 132‚Äì135; Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), p. 59; Andreas Hartmann, Zwischen Relikt Und Reliquie: Objektbezogene Erinnerungspraktiken in Antiken Gesellschaften (Verlag Antike, 2010), pp. 545‚Äì565. In the later Roman Empire, the maintenance of the Altar of Victory in the Curia took on a similar symbolic value for those such as Symmachus who were trying to preserve Rome's religious traditions in the face of Christian hegemony.Sabine MacCormack, The Shadows of Poetry: Vergil in the Mind of Augustine (University of California Press, 1998), p. 167; Symmachus, Third Relatio 8. The extinguishing of the fire of Vesta by the Christian emperor Theodosius I is one of the events that mark the abolition of Rome's ancestral religion and the imposition of Christianity as a state religion that excluded all others. In late antiquity, some narratives of the founding of Constantinople claim that Constantine I, the first emperor to convert to Christianity, transferred the pignora imperii to the new capital. Though the historicity of this transferral may be in doubt, the claim indicates the symbolic value of the tokens.Clifford Ando, \\"The Palladium and the Pentateuch: Towards a Sacred Topography of the Later Roman Empire,\\" Phoenix 55 (2001) 369‚Äì410, especially pp. 398‚Äì399. Servius's list The 4th- century scholar Servius notes in his commentary to Vergil's Aeneid that \\"there were seven tokens (pignora) which maintain Roman rule (imperium Romanum),\\" and gives the following list:Servius, note to Aeneid 7.188: septem fuerunt pignora, quae imperium Romanum tenent: acus matris deum, quadriga fictilis Veientanorum, cineres Orestis, sceptrum Priami, velum Ilionae, palladium, ancilia. # the needle of the Mother of the Gods (Acus Matris Deum), kept in the Temple of Cybele on the Palatine Hill.;It is disputed what the item was precisely. Meteor showers during the Second Punic War motivated the Romans, after consulting the Sibylline Books, to introduce the cult of the Great Mother of Ida (Magna Mater Idaea, also known as Cybele) to the city. With the aid of their ally Attalus I (241-197 BC), they brought the goddess' most important image, a large black stone that was said to have fallen from the sky, from Pessinus to Rome (Livy 10.4-11.18). This was called a baetylus # the terracotta four-horse chariot brought from Veii (Quadriga Fictilis Veientanorum), supposed to have been commissioned by the last king of Rome Tarqinius Superbus, which was displayed on the roof of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitolium; # the ashes of Orestes (Cineres Orestis), kept at the same temple; # the scepter of Priam (Sceptrum Priami), brought to Rome by Aeneas; # the veil of Ilione (Velum Ilionae), daughter of Priam, another Trojan token attributed to Aeneas;Vergil, Aeneid I.647-655. # the Palladium, kept in the Temple of Vesta; # the Ancile, the sacred shield of Mars Gradivus\\"He who walks into battle\\" given to Numa Pompilius, kept in the Regia hidden among eleven other identical copies to confuse would-be thieves. All twelve shields were ritually paraded each year through Rome by the Salii during the Agonum Martialis. Alan Cameron notes that three of these supposed tokens were fictional (the ashes, scepter, and veil) and are not named in any other sources as sacred guarantors of Rome. The other four objects were widely attested in Latin literature,Alan Cameron, The Last Pagans of Rome (Oxford University Press, 2011), n.p. edition online. but have left no archaeological trace.

The area constituting the province is under the de facto jurisdiction of North Korea. As South Korea does not recognize changes in administrative divisions made by North Korea, official maps of the South Korean government shows Hwanghae Province in its pre-1945 borders. The area corresponds to North Korea's North Hwanghae Province (except Kaesong which is claimed to be part of Gyeonggi Province) and South Hwanghae Province.

She won three of her five starts, including the Oaks Stakes in 1797. She was owned Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor, and later became a broodmare, with three of her foals placing in Classic races. Background Nike was a bay filly bred by Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor, and was foaled in 1794. She was sired by Alexander, who raced at Newmarket for Grosvenor. Alexander also sired a number of top horses, including 2000 Guineas winner Hephestion and the important Alexander mare. Nike's dam was Nimble, a daughter of Florizel. Racing career Nike's first race came in the Woodcot Stakes at Epsom Downs on 14 May 1796, when she beat Peeping Tom and two others. This was her only race as a two-year-old. She was entered to run in the Bolton Stakes at Newmarket in mid-May 1797, but was withdrawn before the race. She returned to Epsom Downs on 2 June, when she faced four rivals for the Oaks Stakes. Nike, who started as the 15/8 favourite, won the race from Mother Shipton. Rose, who was the second favourite, finished the race in second place. In her only other run of the season she finished unplaced behind winner Stamford in a Sweepstakes of 20 guineas each at Stamford in July. Six horses started the race, but the judge could only place the winner. In July 1798 she beat Doubtful and Cecilia to win a two-mile Sweepstakes of 10 guineas each at Stamford. At the end of the month she faced Dimple, Mother Shipton and Rose in the Queen's Plate at Chelmsford, which was run in three two-mile heats. In the first heat Nike finished second to Rose, but broke down in the second heat. The race was won by Mother Shipton, who finished last in the first heat. Nike was then retired to stud. Stud career As a broodmare at Earl Grosvenor's stud, she produced thirteen foals. They were: * Minima ‚Äì a bay colt foaled in 1799 and sired by Trumpator. He won a Sweepstakes of 10 guineas each in one-mile heats at Warwick and the Town Subscription Plate at Shrewsbury (four-mile heats) in 1802. * Nettle ‚Äì a bay colt foaled in 1800 and sired by John Bull. * John Bull colt ‚Äì a chestnut colt foaled in 1802. He broke his leg during breaking. * Eaton ‚Äì a bay stallion foaled in 1804 and sired by Sir Peter Teazle. Won his first three races as a three-year-old in 1807, before finishing third in the St. Leger Stakes. In 1808 he won four races at Newmarket and won a further six in 1809. He won three races in 1810, including the October Newmarket King's Plate. In 1811 he beat Derby winner Pope over three miles and won a King's Plate. Eaton stood as a stallion at Stoke Place near Windsor and was the damsire of Doncaster Cup winner Galopade. * Dee Nymph ‚Äì a bay filly foaled in 1806 and sired by Sir Peter Teazle. She raced in the Oaks in 1809, but broke down. She was later sent to Ireland. * Eccleston ‚Äì a bay stallion foaled in 1807 and sired by Cesario. He won a race at Newmarket and finished third behind Whalebone in The Derby in 1810. He won seven races in 1811 and two in 1812. In 1813 he won the Garden Stakes at Newmarket and one other race. * Barrosa ‚Äì a bay mare foaled in 1808 and sired by Vermin. She won the Produce Sweepstakes at Newmarket and was then runner-up in the 2000 Guineas in 1811. She also won the Portholme Stakes at Huntingdon. She won four races at Newmarket in 1812. She was later a broodmare for Lord Cavendish. Her descendants include dual Arc de Triomphe winner Ksar. * Mite ‚Äì a bay mare foaled in 1810 and sired by Meteor. She raced once, unsuccessfully, as the three-year-old. As a broodmare she produced ten foals. * Zadora ‚Äì a brown mare foaled in 1811 and sired by Trafalgar. She finished second in the Newmarket Stakes and won a race at Stamford, one at Lichfield and one at Walsall in 1814. In 1815 she won three races, including the Manchester Stakes. After retiring from racing Zadora was a broodmare at the 2nd Earl Grosvenor's stud. Through her daughter Alarm, her direct female line produced Kentucky Oaks winner Liahtunah and Champagne Stakes winner Oiseau. * Theodosia ‚Äì a brown filly foaled in 1812 and sired by Trafalgar. She died as a two-year-old. * Orontes ‚Äì a bay colt foaled in 1813 and sired by Trafalgar. He won his first three races as a three-year-old.

He is best remembered for his devotion to his openly unfaithful wife Frances, who despised him.  Early life William Holles Vane was the third son of William Vane, 1st Viscount Vane, and his wife Lucy (n√©e Jolliffe). His paternal grandfather was Christopher Vane, 1st Baron Barnard and Lady Elizabeth Holles (a daughter of Gilbert Holles, 3rd Earl of Clare and sister of John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle). He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 12 October 1730. His older brothers, Christopher and John, predeceased their father, and William succeeded to the viscountcy on 20 May 1734.  Unconventional marriage  The Viscountess Vane He married the widowed Lady William Hamilton in Marylebone on 19 May 1735. The marriage immediately proved to be a failure and the new Viscountess Vane tried to procure a legal separation. She did not hide her contempt for him or her extramarital relationships, but he was obsessed and remained devoted to her despite the social embarrassment brought to him by her continuous sexual infidelity and financial difficulties caused by her excessive spending. During their visit to Paris in 1736, she eloped with Sewallis Shirley, the sixth son of Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers. Lord Vane desperately tried to persuade her to return, employing about fifty people to search for her in August 1736 and promising a reward in the newspapers for any information about her location in January 1737. John Perceval, 1st Earl of Egmont, wrote: After Shirley left her, she took up a liaison with Augustus Berkeley, 4th Earl of Berkeley. In 1741, Vane offered her an income and a separate household on the condition she returned to him. Ten years later, she published Memoires of a Lady of Quality,It was included in the last volume of Tobias Smollett's Adventures of Peregrine Pickle. in which she describes her marriage and sexual escapades. Lord Vane is portrayed as a repulsive man whose sexual attempts \\"were like the pawings of an imp, sent from hell to teize [sic] and torment some guilty wretch\\". The narrative suggests that he suffered from erectile dysfunction. The couple spent the rest of their lives living in separate households, which (along with his efforts to bring his wife back) contributed to his financial downfall. Deeply indebted, Lord Vane was compelled to sell an estate in Staffordshire, Caverswall Castle, and give up his country seat in Kent. Lady Vane spent the last two decades of her life bedridden and died in 1788. Lord Vane died the next year at his home in Downing Street, London, and the Vane viscountcy became extinct.

January 1715 ‚Äì 31 March 1788), was a British memoirist known for her highly public adulterous relationships.  Early life and first marriage  Frances Anne Hawes was the daughter of Susanna and Francis Hawes, and probably born in Winchester Street, London. She was baptised on 14 January 1715 at St Peter le Poer. Her father, a stockbroker and clerk to the Treasurer of the Navy, became quite wealthy, and was appointed director of the South Sea Company in February 1715. However, he lost most of his fortune as a result of the Sufferer's Act of 1721, following the failed attempt to inflate the price of the South Sea Company's stock. Thus, the future Viscountess Vane grew up in a family plagued by financial problems and could expect little or no dowry. Described as the best minuet dancer in England, she was good-looking and vivacious enough to attract the attention of the 4th Duke of Hamilton's second son, Lord William Hamilton. Her father tried to prevent their relationship, but the couple eloped in May 1733, and Frances Hawes became known as Lady William Hamilton. The couple hurried to consummate the marriage to make it legally binding, fearing that her father might try to have it annulled. Lord William served as Vice-Chamberlain to Caroline of Ansbach but, as the second son, was himself poor enough for the queen to refer to the couple as \\"handsome beggars\\". The marriage was short-lived; Lady William was widowed on 11 July next year, shortly after delivering a stillborn child.  Second marriage  Lady William was soon pressured by her family, in-laws, and friends to accept the marriage proposal from William Vane, 2nd Viscount Vane. The couple married on 19 May 1735 in Marylebone, and Lady William thus became Viscountess Vane. The union became notoriously unhappy. Lady Vane openly despised the man who adored her, frequently ran away and tried to procure a legal separation. During the couple's visit to Paris in 1736, she fled with the 1st Earl Ferrers's sixth surviving son, Sewallis Shirley. Shirley and Lady Vane lived together in Brussels from 1736 until 1738. Her husband desperately tried to persuade her to return, paying people to search for her and promising a reward in the newspapers for any information about her location in January 1737. Lady Vane was not amused by his efforts. When Shirley left her, she embarked on a liaison with Augustus Berkeley, 4th Earl of Berkeley. The relationship with Lord Berkeley ended in 1741, when she accepted her husband's offer of an income and a separate household. Lord Vane and the society believed that her other lovers included Walpole's rival Sir Thomas Aston, 4th Baronet, and Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Fortescue, but Lady Vane denied the allegations and insisted they were her friends. Memoirs of a Lady of Quality Title page of the first edition of The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle In 1751, Tobias Smollett included the Memoirs of a Lady of Quality in his novel The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle. Though the memoirs, written in amatory fiction, were published anonymously and revised for publication by John Shebbeare, it was clear from the beginning that the \\"lady of quality\\" was Lady Vane. Horace Walpole wrote in a letter the same year: In her memoirs, the Viscountess Vane mocks contemporary social and moral conventions, and describes her emotional devastation following the death of her first husband. Walpole gossiped in the same letter: Lady Vane shocked society not only by refusing to portray herself as chaste, but also by unrepentantly advertising her adulterous relationships. In 1751, Samuel Richardson referred to her and other scandalous memoirists as \\"a Set of Wretches, wishing to perpetuate their Infamy\\". Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's reaction to the memoirs was more careful and restrained. In a 1752 letter to her daughter, the Countess of Bute, she wrote: \\"[Lady Vane's] History, rightly considered, would be more instructive to young Women than any Sermon I know. They may see there the mortifications and variety of misery are the unavoidable consequences of Galantrys.\\"  Later life and death  After the publication of her memoirs, Lady Vane spent most of her time in Bath, Somerset. Her erratic lifestyle soon ruined her husband's finances. Struck by an illness, she was bedridden for the last 20 years of her life. During that time, she contemplated converting to Roman Catholicism. She died childless on 31 March 1788 at her home in Hill Street, Mayfair, London, and was buried in the Vane family vault in Shipborne, Kent. Lord Vane, who had remained faithful to her despite the social humiliation caused by her sexual adventures, died the next year.

In April 1909, she was transferred to the Royal Mail West Indies service. In 1910, she was sent to the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast for conversion into a 320-capacity cruise ship with a new gross tonnage of 8,939. She was renamed RMS Arcadian on 21 September 1910 as the RMSP's liners had names beginning with the letter \\"A\\", and was registered at Belfast in September of the following year. She started her first world cruise in January 1912, the largest dedicated cruise ship in the world at that time. She was on the first leg of this voyage that Olave St Claire Soames met Lieutenant General Sir Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement, leading to their marriage in October of that year. Admiralty service, 1915‚Äì17 Arcadian sinking after being torpedoed. Men can be seen sliding down ropes into the sea In February 1915, Arcadian was hired by the Admiralty. On 7 April 1915 at Alexandria, General Sir Ian Hamilton came aboard and used Arcadian, together with the battleship Queen Elizabeth, as his headquarters ship during the opening phase of the Gallipoli Campaign.Hamilton, Ian (1920), Gallipoli Diary: Volume I, George H Doran Company, New York (p. 86) Once Hamilton's staff had transferred to a shore base at Imbros, Arcadian was employed as a troop ship in the Mediterranean. On 15 April 1917 Arcadian was en route from Thessaloniki (Salonika) to Alexandria with a company of 1,335 troops and crew and escorted by a Japanese Navy destroyer. Shortly after completing a boat drill, while 26 miles north east of the Greek island of Milos, Arcadian was hit by a single torpedo from the German submarine and sank within six minutes with the loss of 279 lives. A contemporary newspaper article described how four of Arcadian's overcrowded lifeboats were successfully lowered before she sank. Some of the dead were cooks and stokers who were working below decks. The escorting destroyer had two torpedoes launched at her while she was attempting to rescue men from the water; survivors reported that she had lowered three of her own boats while going \\"at full speed\\". More survivors, who had been clinging to a raft, were rescued at midnight by the Q-ship . Among the dead was the eminent bacteriologist, Sir Marc Armand Ruffer, who was returning to Alexandria after advising on the control of an epidemic among troops based at Thessaloniki.

Mount Logan () is located in North Cascades National Park in the U.S. state of Washington. Mount Logan is in a remote location of North Cascades National Park that requires hiking from a trailhead to reach the peak. The mountain itself is not a difficult climb, though the easiest approaches require traversing glaciers and ropes are recommended.Smoot pp. 93‚Äì97 The peak supports three glaciers including Banded Glacier to the north, Fremont Glacier to the southwest and Douglas Glacier on the southeast slopes. Climate Mount Logan is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.  Geology  The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It was fought on 18 August 684 between the Kalb-dominated armies of the Yaman, supporting the Umayyads under Caliph Marwan I, and the Qays under al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, who supported the Mecca-based Abdallah ibn al-Zubayr; the latter had proclaimed himself Caliph. The Kalbi victory consolidated the position of the Umayyads over Syria, paving the way for their eventual victory in the civil war against Ibn al-Zubayr. However, it also left a bitter legacy of division and rivalry between the Qays and the Yaman, which would be a constant source of strife and instability for the remainder of the Umayyad Caliphate.  Background At the death of Mu'awiya I (), the founder of the Umayyad Caliphate, in 680, the Muslim world was thrown into turmoil. Although Mu'awiya had named his son, Yazid I, as his heir, this choice was not universally recognized, especially by the old Medinan elites, who challenged the Umayyads' claim to the succession. Among them, the two chief candidates for the caliphate were the Alid Husayn ibn Ali, and Abdallah ibn al-Zubayr. Husayn at first attempted an outright revolt against the Umayyads, but this resulted in his death at the Battle of Karbala in October 680, leaving Ibn al- Zubayr as the leading contender. As long as Yazid lived, Ibn al-Zubayr denounced his rule from the sanctuary of Mecca but did not openly claim the Caliphate, instead insisting that the Caliph should be chosen in the traditional manner, by a tribal assembly (shura) from among all the Quraysh. After the open revolt of Medina against Umayyad rule, in 683 Yazid sent an army to Arabia that defeated the Medinans and laid siege to Mecca, the holiest city of Islam, but Yazid's death in November forced the expeditionary force to return home. Yazid was succeeded by his son, Mu'awiya II, but he died a few weeks later and never enjoyed any real authority outside the family's traditional stronghold of Syria. His death provoked a crisis, since his other brothers were too young to succeed. As a result, Umayyad authority collapsed across the Caliphate and Ibn al-Zubayr was accepted by most of the Muslims as their new leader: the Umayyad governor of Iraq, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, was evicted from the province, coins in Ibn al-Zubayr's name were minted in Persia, and the Qaysi tribes of northern Syria and the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) went over to his cause. The governor of Homs, Nu'man ibn Bashir al-Ansari, gave his allegiance to Ibn al-Zubayr, as did Natil ibn Qays, who expelled the pro-Umayyad governor of Palestine, his rival within the Banu Judham tribe Rawh ibn Zinba. Even some members of the Umayyad family considered going to Mecca and declaring their allegiance to him. In central and southern Syria, however, the Umayyad cause was upheld by the local tribes, led by the Banu Kalb under Ibn Bahdal and Ibn Ziyad. At their initiative, a shura of the loyal tribes was held at Jabiyah, where Marwan ibn al-Hakam, a distant cousin of Mu'awiya I who had been a close aide of Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (), was elected as the Umayyads' caliphal candidate.  Opening skirmishes and the battle of Marj Rahit  Marwan's election provoked the reaction of the Qays, who rallied around the Governor of Damascus, al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri. After vacillating between the two candidates, al-Dahhak was persuaded to recognize Ibn al-Zubayr, and began assembling his forces on the field of Marj al-Suffar near Damascus. In response, the Umayyad coalition marched on Damascus, which was surrendered to the Umayyads by a member of the Ghassanid tribe.. The two armies first clashed in mid-July 684 at the plain of Marj al-Suffar, and the Qays were pushed towards Marj Rahit, a plain some 17 kilometres northeast of Damascus (between the modern cities of Douma and Adra). Twenty days of skirmishing between the two camps followed, until the final battle took place on 18 August. The numbers of the two opponents are uncertain: al-Tabari puts Marwan's forces at 6,000, another tradition at 13,000 and 30,000 for Marwan and al-Dahhak respectively, while Ibn Khayyat inflates the numbers to 30,000 and 60,000 respectively. The traditions agree, however, that the Umayyad forces were considerably outnumbered. Marwan's commanders were Abbad ibn Ziyad, Amr ibn Sa'id al-As and Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad (another tradition has Ubayd Allah commanding the cavalry and Malik ibn Hubayra al-Sakuni the infantry), while only one of al-Dahhak's commanders, Ziyad ibn Amr ibn Mu'awiya al-Uqayli, is known. A plethora of anecdotes, individual accounts, and poems on the battle survives,cf. but the details of the battle itself are not clear, except that the day resulted in a crushing Umayyad victory: the main leaders of the Qays, including al-Dahhak, fell in the field. Nikita Eliss√©eff explains the Umayyad success by the possible defection of Qays-aligned tribes during the preceding weeks, eager to uphold the Syrian hegemony over the Caliphate. In addition, Eliss√©eff points out that the Umayyads still controlled the state treasury in Damascus, allowing them to bribe tribes to join them. The remnants of the Qays army fled to Qarqisiya under Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi, and Marwan was officially proclaimed as Caliph at Damascus.  Aftermath  The victory at Marj Rahit secured the Umayyads' position in Syria, and allowed them to go onto the offensive against Ibn al-Zubayr's supporters. Egypt was recovered later in the year, but an attempt to recover Iraq under Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad was defeated by pro-Alid forces under al-Mukhtar near Mosul in August 686. Abd al-Malik, who had succeeded his father Marwan I after the latter's death in April 685, thereafter restricted himself to securing his own position, while Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr defeated al-Mukhtar and gained control of all of Iraq in 687. In 691, Abd al-Malik managed to bring Zufar al-Kilabi's Qays back into the Umayyad fold, and advanced into Iraq. Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr was defeated and killed, and Umayyad authority re-established across the East. In October 692, after another siege of Mecca, Abdallah ibn al-Zubayr was killed, and the civil war ended.  Impact  The most enduring legacy of Marj Rahit was the hardening of the Qays‚ÄìKalb split in Syria, which was paralleled in the division and rivalry between the Mudar, led by the Banu Tamim, and the Rabi'a and Azd alliance in Iraq. Together, these rivalries caused a realignment of tribal loyalties into two tribal confederations or \\"super-groups\\" across the Caliphate: the \\"North Arab\\" or Qays/Mudar block, opposed by the \\"South Arabs\\" or Yemenis, although these terms were political rather than strictly geographical, since the properly \\"northern\\" Rabi'a adhered to the \\"southern\\" Yemenis. The Umayyad caliphs tried to maintain a balance between the two groups, but this division and the implacable rivalry between the two groups became a fixture of the Arab world over the following decades, as even originally unaligned tribes were drawn to affiliate themselves with one of the two super-groups. Their constant contest for power and influence dominated the Umayyad Caliphate, creating instability in the provinces, helping to foment the disastrous Third Fitna and contributing to the Umayyads' final fall at the hands of the Abbasids. Indeed, in the assessment of Julius Wellhausen, Marj Rahit \\"brought victory to the , and at the same time shattered the foundations of their power\\". The division continued long after: as Hugh N. Kennedy writes, \\"As late as the nineteenth century, battles were still being fought in Palestine between groups calling themselves Qays and Yaman\\".

Early life and musical training Kumar's late father Huleppa was a folk singer and a leather puppeteer. In 1968, when he was 12 years old, Venkatesh was taken by his uncle Belagallu Veeranna to the Veereshwara Punyashrama in Gadag, run by the Veerashaiva saint and Hindustani musician Puttaraj Gawai. For the next 12 years, he lived at the ashram and learned Hindustani singing in the Gwalior and Kirana styles under Gawai. Kumar blends these styles in his presentations, though he admits to influences beyond these gharanas, chief among them being Bade Ghulam Ali Khan of the Patiala gharana. His guru was also trained in Carnatic music, and as a result, there are traces of Carnatic elements in Pandit Kumar's music, especially in his sargam patterns. Career Kumar got his first break in 1993, 14 years after he left the ashram, when he received a invitation from Bhimsen Joshi to perform at the Sawai Gandharva Sangeet Mahotsav in Pune.

It is situated on H√∏jbro Plads a few steps away from Amagertorv and Str√∏get. The church building is noted for its fanciful Neo-Baroque long spire. The tower offers some of the best views of the city centre. History The original church building was constructed in the early thirteenth century and was one of Copenhagen's oldest church. In 1530, the Lutheran theologian Hans Tavsen (1494‚Äì1561) preached the first Lutheran sermon within Copenhagen in St Nicholas Church. The fire of 1795 burned down most of the building, and from 1805, it was no longer an official church. Though church ruins were demolished, the sturdy tower remains standing in the present day. Butcher stalls occupied the area around the tower until the second half of the 1800s when they were closed. The current building, which opened in 1912, is by a design of the architect, Hans Christian Amberg (1749‚Äì1815), representing a modern reconstruction of the destroyed church. The current spire is also a modern reconstruction of the original, financed in 1909 at the initiative and expense of the brewer Carl Jacobsen (1842-1914). He also financed the 1915‚Äì1917 repairs. The tower has served as a naval museum and its attic was at one time a library. It was also the focus of Hans Christian Andersen's drama, Love of Nicolai Tower performed in 1829 at the Royal Theatre. When the internationally notable Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen returned to Copenhagen in 1838 after living and working for 40 years in Rome, a flag was hoisted on the tower when his ship approached to alert residents of his arrival. Presently Nikolaj collaborates with a range of organisations locally, nationally and internationally in the realm of new artistic forms and media. The art center's focus is on Danish and international contemporary art. The first art exhibitions occurred at Nikolaj in 1957. Nikolaj gained prominence after the Fluxus performances of the 1960s. Nikolaj is focussing on contemporary art with two annual exhibitions, one by children, and another one by an older artist who is deemed to have had a pioneering effect on modern art. Jananne Al-Ani, Leonard Cohen, Andreas Emenius, Helmut Newton, and Kutluƒü Ataman have exhibited notably at Nikolaj.

Murphy.) In 2020, the United States Supreme Court ruled in McGirt v. Oklahoma that the land reserved for the Muscogee (Creek) Nation since the 19th century remains Indian country for the purposes of the Major Crimes Act. Background In preparation for Oklahoma's admission to the union on an \\"equal footing with the original states\\" by 1907, through a series of acts, including the Oklahoma Organic Act and the Oklahoma Enabling Act, Congress attempted to unilaterally dissolve all sovereign tribal governments within the state of Oklahoma. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held in 2017 that at least one tribe, the modern Muscogee (Creek) Nation, was never actually dissolved. Congress also transferred all tribal lands by land patent (or first-title deed) to either individual tribal members, sold to non-tribal members on a first-come basis (typically by land run), or was held in trust by the Federal government for the benefit of the members of the tribes. By 1936 the federal government had changed its policy with regards to Indian tribes, and Indian nations within the state of Oklahoma were reinstated by the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act. However, by that time, the State of Oklahoma was a sovereign state and the powers and authorities that other non-Oklahoma reservations possess could not be taken back from the State of Oklahoma. Congress tried to further rectify the situation through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which authorized substantial tax incentives based on certain business activity within Indian reservations. Congress wanted to insure these benefits would also be available in Oklahoma by including in the legal definition of Indian reservation the term former Indian reservations in Oklahoma. In a 1997 amendment, these lands were defined as those lands as the \\"then-current jurisdictional areas\\" of Oklahoma Indian tribes, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. Tax benefits In 1998 the IRS issued Notice 98-45 which established the boundaries of the Former Indian Reservations in Oklahoma. For tax purposes, current and former lands owned by Indian tribes are treated as if they are an Indian reservation, regardless of current ownership. Approximately 2/3 of the State of Oklahoma is treated as if it were an Indian reservation for tax purposes.

Tomaz Aquino Messias de Bragan√ßa (born April 6, 1924 in Bardez (then Portuguese India), died October 19, 1986, Lebombo Mountains, on the South African side) was a Goan physicist, journalist, diplomat and Mozambican social scientist at the Eduardo Mondlane University. He played a leading intellectual and political role in the campaign for the decolonialisation of Mozambique from its colonial power Portugal. Biography Aquino's parents were Jo√£o Paulo Proen√ßa Bragan√ßa and Ana Carlota Praxetes Ant√≥nia do Ros√°rio Sousa. Both lived in the former Portuguese colony of Goa on the west coast of the Indian subcontinent. He spent his childhood in Goa, where he attended school. The high school he studied at was the Liceu Nacional de Afonso de Albuquerque in the town then called Pangim (also Nova Goa, later called Panjim then Panaji). In 1945 he took part in a training course for Chemical Engineering in Dharwad, in what was then British India. Professional and political development As a young adult, Aquino de Bragan√ßa was in Portuguese East Africa in 1947, there to look for work. During this time he was confronted with the effects of the Portuguese colonial policy, which exercised a decisive influence on him for the rest of his life. Aquino de Bragan√ßa moved to Portugal by 1948, where he later met the writer Orlando da Costa, who was also from Goa, and who studied philosophy at the University of Lisbon. Here Aquino de Bragan√ßa also came across the physician Arm√©nio Ferreira and the Casa dos Estudantes do Imp√©rio, a centre for students from the African and other colonies of Portugal. At Panjim, Goa, April 2011, during the launch of the book on Aquino de Bragan√ßa. From left, Miguel Braganza (a relative), historian Prajal Sakhardande, litt√©rateur Dr Maria Aurora Couto, former Indian federal minister Eduardo Faleiro, author Silvia Bragan√ßa and Portuguese Consul-General in Goa Dr Antonio Costa Sabido. In 1951, Aquino de Bragan√ßa headed for France. In Grenoble and Paris, he studied physics. In both places, he met students who were aware of the role of Portugal as a colonial power, and had negative and critical positions on the same, including M√°rio Pinto de Andrade, Frantz Fanon, and Marcelino dos Santos. Aquino de Bragan√ßa developed at that time a strong political consciousness of the Marxist variety and lived with the hope that the colony of Goa could be independent from Portugal. On the basis of his shared ideas with other activists from various Portuguese colonies, he created personal bonds. Within such political activists, he developed a Paris- Casablanca Algiers group designated as an informal alliance, as a result of the Confedera√ß√£o das Organiza√ß√µes Nacionalistas das Colonias Portuguesas (CONCP, Conference of Nationalist Organisations of Portuguese Colonie). In 1957 Aquino de Bragan√ßa emigrated to Morocco in Algeria to take to teaching science. Here he married his first wife Mariana. Both the couple's children were born in Morocco. During this time he worked as a journalist and increasingly wrote for the Simon Malley-founded Afrique-Asie magazine in Paris. With the consent of King Mohamed V, he acted as the secretary of the editorial group of the Moroccan newspaper Al Istiklal and the private secretary of Ben Barka, a Moroccan opposition leader, whom he had met in Paris. When the PAIGC and the MPLA in 1961 set up an office of CONCP in Rabat to coordinate the political work of the independence movement of Portuguese colonies, together with the trade unionist and campaigner George Vaz, he represented the Goan People's Party within the new organization. His participation in this umbrella organization led to a growing influence in CONCP Secretariat and expanding contacts with leading figures in the liberation movements on the African continent. The Bragan√ßa family lived until 1962 in Morocco. In the same year they moved to Algiers in Algeria. During this time he worked under simple conditions and his journalistic activities offered only a modest living. He is co-founder of the weekly newspaper R√©volution Africaine, and wrote for the daily newspaper El Moudjahid. By this time, the government of the dictator Salazar had become aware of his political activities and therefore sought an arrest warrant for the Portuguese secret police (PIDE) dated March 14, 1962. All his activities were monitored by the PIDE and recorded in regular reports. In 1965, he is found as a participant of 3 to 8 October at the second CONCP conference in Dar es Salaam, which had Agostinho Neto as Secretary and was organised by M√°rio Pinto de Andrade (MPLA) and Amalia de Fonseca and Aquino himself. He participated as an author and co- author along with Pascoal Mocumbi and Edmundo Rocha of the conference documents (for example, \\"The political situation in Portugal\\" and \\"Liberation struggle in the Portuguese colonies\\"). On the recommendation of Simon Malley, he took on the task of commentator on issues in the Portuguese colonies since 1969 for Africasia, which later became Afrique-Asie. Together with Immanuel Wallerstein and Melo Antunes, the three-volume work Quem √© o inimigo (\\"Who is the enemy?\\") came about. It dealt with key issues of colonialism, and first appeared in 1978 in Lisbon. His work in Algeria reflects a stage of comprehensive journalistic activities with the objectives of promoting the African liberation movements and participation in logistical support, building their international profile and promoting the training of journalists. In this way, Aquino de Bragan√ßa was founder of the Algerian School of Journalism, where he taught courses in the sociology of journalism. During his varied activities he met leading figures of the liberation movements, was their counselor and was friends with a number of these people. From this group of people are M√°rio Pinto de Andrade, Ben Bella, Am√≠lcar Cabral, Samora Machel, Agostinho Neto and Eduardo Mondlane. After the Carnation Revolution of 1974 in Portugal, Aquino de Bragan√ßa decided to step up further engagement in Mozambique. This event had changed the balance of power in southern Africa completely. At the beginning of this new chapter of life, he was commissioned by Samora Machel in May 1974 with a political mission in Lisbon, in order to figure out the new negotiating partner for the FRELIMO in a situation where the power in a state of flux in the colonial capital, Lisbon. This led to a meeting with Ernesto Melo Antunes and first official contacts with M√°rio Soares, whom he had met earlier in Paris, and with the Portuguese Minister for inter-territorial contacts, Ant√≥nio de Almeida Santos. Aquino de Bragan√ßa introduced the first official talks on behalf of his future homeland of Mozambique with the new political forces of the former colonial power, Portugal. As a result, there developed intense working contacts between the two sides, which were largely driven by Victor Crespo for the Portuguese government and by Joaquim Chissano and Aquino de Bragan√ßa for Mozambican negotiator. In September 1974, representatives from both sides met in Lusaka for further negotiations. In this context, there were discussions between Samora Machel and Ramalho Eanes, who later became President of Portugal, a longtime General in Angola and a member of the Movimento das For√ßas Armadas. Cover of the English-language version of the Aquino biography. After the victory of FRELIMO in Mozambique, Aquino de Bragan√ßa waived aside a possible ministerial post in the government of Samora Machel. Instead, he took over the position of his adviser, founded in 1975 the Center for African Studies at the Eduardo Mondlane University in Maputo. The following year he was appointed director of this research area. The studies were concerned with development issues within Mozambique and the situation in the neighboring country of Rhodesia. The South African journalist and sociologist Ruth First took over as Director of Research here in 1977. She had previously taught at the University of Durham, UK. Together, they put together an international group of social scientists. The first project of its collaboration dedicated under the title \\"The Mozambican Miner\\", focussing on the Mozambican miners in South Africa.

The amicable relationship of trust with Samora Machel gave him a special place in post- colonial Mozambique. Within the government, Aquino de Bragan√ßa was nicknamed \\"the submarine\\", apparently because of his ability to work behind the scenes. Asked about his political creed, he described himself as an \\"anti-anti- communist.\\" Death Aquino de Bragan√ßa died on 19 October 1986 in a Tupolev Tu-134 plane crash in the Lebombo Mountains, near the border between Mozambique and South Africa. With him on board the plane were President Samora Machel and 33 other senior officials of the country he chose to live in and be part of. The causes of the crash were still unclear. Before his death, Bragan√ßa worked on the preparations for a meeting between South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha and Samora Machel, which could have resulted in a reduction of conflicts between the two countries.

Biography Howe was born in Princeton, New Jersey, on February 17, 1953, a child of academic parents: his father, Irving Howe (1920‚Äì1993), was a celebrated literary critic, historian of Jewish immigrants to America and a prominent American socialist; his mother, Thalia Phillies, was a classicist and academic. Howe received a B.A. in English from York University (1974) and a PhD in English from Yale University (1978). His dissertation, The Latin Encyclopedia Tradition and Old English Poetry, was the basis for The Old English Catalogue Poems: A Study in Poetic Form (1985). He taught at Rutgers University (1978‚Äì85), then at the University of Oklahoma (until 1991), and then at Ohio State University where he led the Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies (1995‚Äì2002). In 2002 he moved to California, to the University of California, Berkeley. He died of leukemia on September 27, 2006. Scholarship and influence Howe's Migration and Mythmaking, first published in 1989 and reprinted in 2001, was a study of Anglo-Saxon culture and literature. Howe argued that the Anglo-Saxons, descendants of peoples who had traveled from continental Europe to settle Britain and then returned to Europe to convert their pagan forebears (Howe discusses Wilfrid, Saint Willibrord, and Saint Boniface, in connection with such poems as Beowulf and Exodus), were very conscious of their return to Europe and saw themselves as an integral part of and parallel to \\"the Israelite and Hebrew migration in biblical history\\". The book \\"influenced a generation of scholars\\". In addition to his scholarship of Old English (and he was fond of discussing and publishing on parallels between Old English and modern culture and literature), Howe had an interest in geography and in American landscape and culture (including \\"theme parks, fast-food America, and construction cranes\\"), and published a number of (academic) articles in that field.

It was originally installed in the Chapel of Our Lady of Light on the Plaza and is presently housed in Cristo Rey Church, which was built for that purpose in 1940. Described as \\"the only one of its kind from the Spanish period in the United States\\" and \\"definitely one of the most extraordinary pieces of ecclesiastical art in the country\\", it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. with Description The reredos is over high and wide. It was carved from soft, white volcanic stone quarried near Pojoaque and was originally painted, though only traces of color remain. Reliefs carved into the stone depict a variety of religious iconography. At the crown of the reredos, God appears above the Mother and child (Our Lady of Valvanera). In the next tier of carvings, St. James the Apostle, the patron saint of Spain, appears on horseback in the center flanked by St. Joseph with the infant Jesus on the left and St. John Nepomuk, the protector of the Jesuits, on the right. The bottom row of carvings depicts St. Ignatius Loyola on the left and St. Francis Solano on the right. In the center is a niche that originally housed an oil painting of Our Lady of Light. When the reredos was moved to Cristo Rey Church in 1940, the stone slab that formerly adorned the front of La Castrense was placed in the niche. This depicts Our Lady of Light holding the infant Jesus while rescuing a human figure from the clutches of Satan. Some of the iconography is unusual in that it depicts Jesuit and Benedictine figures rather than strictly those of the Franciscans, who were responsible for most of the Spanish colonial churches in New Mexico. History The Chapel of Our Lady of Light, or La Castrense, was a military chapel on the south side of the Santa Fe Plaza which was built in 1760 by Governor Francisco Antonio Mar√≠n del Valle. To complete the interior of the chapel, Mar√≠n del Valle brought masons from Zacatecas, Mexico to carve a massive stone reredos. Archaeological investigations of the chapel site found chips of the same stone, suggesting that the carving took place on site. The building of the chapel was observed by Bishop of Durango Pedro Tamar√≥n y Romeral during his visit to New Mexico in 1760; he wrote A later visitor, Fray Atanasio Dom√≠nguez, recorded a very detailed description of the chapel in 1776. According to his measurements, La Castrense was about long overall and wide, extending to wide at the transept. The ceiling, supported by corbeled beams, was about high with a clerestory above the sanctuary. As to the reredos, he wrote Ultimately, although highly critical of many of the churches he visited in New Mexico, Dom√≠nguez conceded \\"Its interior is very attractive.\\" The chapel remained in use by Spanish, and later Mexican, troops stationed in Santa Fe until the 1830s. The chapel was last regularly used during the first term of Governor Manuel Armijo (1827‚àí29), who attended services in full uniform along with the military garrison. However, the Mexican government later withdrew its financial support for military chaplains and La Castrense was left empty, eventually falling into disrepair. By the time the U.S. Army occupied the city in 1846, the roof had fallen in and bones were sticking out of the earthen floor. The army repaired the chapel and turned it into a storehouse. When Jean-Baptiste Lamy arrived in Santa Fe as its new Vicar Apostolic in 1851, one of his first tasks was to take control of La Castrense and other property that he saw as rightfully belonging to the church. The Territorial Legislature had vowed not to interfere but Grafton Baker, the Chief Justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court, was opposed to handing over the chapel and drunkenly declared that he would hang Lamy if he tried to take it. This created an uproar in the heavily Catholic city and Baker, fearing for his own safety, was forced to back down. Lamy tried for a few years to revive the chapel, but without much success, and ended up selling it in 1859 to raise money for his new cathedral project. The building was converted into a store and remained standing at least until the 1870s, though it was later demolished. When the site was cleared for a new building in 1955, the foundations of La Castrense were uncovered and studied by archaeologists. Before disposing of the chapel, Lamy had the reredos and a stone medallion from the facade removed and transferred to La Parroquia, the main parish church of Santa Fe at the time. Later this church was replaced by St. Francis Cathedral. Once the cathedral was completed, the reredos was consigned to a small room behind the altar away from public view. In 1940, it was moved to the new Cristo Rey parish church on Canyon Road, which was built specifically to house it, and has remained there since. The church was designed by noted New Mexico architect John Gaw Meem.

The fourth tropical storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, it formed from an area of disturbed weather east of the Leeward Islands on July 13, 1909. Remaining weak for much of its early existence, the system began to intensify after nearing Jamaica. Curving towards the northwest, it reached hurricane strength on July 18 near the western tip of Cuba. Intensification stalled as it moved westwards across the Gulf of Mexico, but resumed as the hurricane approached the Texas coast. The storm intensified to a major hurricane on July 21 and subsequently reached its peak intensity with winds of prior to making landfall near Velasco, Texas. Once over land, the system began to quickly weaken, and dissipated near the Rio Grande on July 22\\\\. The hurricane caused 41 deaths and $2 million in damages, all of which were in Texas. Strong waves caused several offshore shipping incidents, and storm surge inundated areas of the Texas coast, though damage in Galveston was mostly mitigated by the Galveston Seawall. In Velasco, only eight buildings remained intact after the hurricane. Strong winds forced train closures and destroyed and downed various infrastructure. Heavy rains further inland peaked at 8.5 in (220 mm) in Hallettsville. Meteorological history A tropical depression was first noted at 1200 UTC on July 13, northeast of Grenada in the Windward Islands, with winds of , though whether it had a closed circulation at the time remains unclear. Nonetheless, the system remained a weak tropical depression for much of its early existence as it moved to the west-northwest through the eastern Caribbean Sea. Weather reports throughout the Caribbean during this time were sparse and according to Jos√© Partag√°s, a former meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, the system still may have not formed a closed circulation. This meant that the low was not classifiable, though the lack of data also meant that there was no evidence to support this claim and the system was kept as a tropical depression in HURDAT, the Atlantic Hurricane Database. However, once the depression was located south of Jamaica, it began to slowly strengthen and curve more towards the northwest, reaching tropical storm intensity by 0000 UTC on July 17\\\\. At the time, the system was expected to make landfall on the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Ships in the vicinity of the storm reported strong breezes associated with low barometric pressure. Despite predictions, the system curved from its initial west-northwest movement and more towards the northwest, towards the central Gulf of Mexico. The tropical storm continued to intensify, attaining hurricane strength as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale at 1800 UTC on July 18 after skirting past the Guanahacabibes Peninsula. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, intensification substantially lessened as the storm maintained its Category 1 intensity throughout July 19 and July 20\\\\. The hurricane curved in the gulf back to a more westerly direction, while moving at about . A minimum pressure reading of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg) was reported offshore south of Louisiana by the ship S.S. Paraguay at 1800 UTC on July 20. Strengthening resumed late on July 20th as the hurricane tracked almost parallel to the Louisiana coastline towards Texas. On July 21st, the storm attained its peak intensity as a modern-day Category 3 major hurricane, with sustained winds of 115 mph (175 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 959 mbar (hPa; 28.32 inHg). Later the same day, the hurricane made landfall at this intensity almost directly over Velasco, Texas, with maximum wind speeds stretching from the hurricane's center. Over the following 24 hours, the system rapidly weakened over land and lost tropical characteristics near the Rio Grande during the afternoon of July 22. Preparations and impact alt=Black and white contoured map of rainfall totals, ranging from to . As the hurricane approached Texas, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for potentially affected areas beginning on July 18\\\\. Ships and ports were also continuously notified on the oncoming storm, which helped to keep offshore shipping accidents to a minimum. Inland, as a precautionary measure, rail operations along the coast were halted for a duration of the storm's passage. At its landfall in Velasco, the hurricane caused a wide swath of damage along the Texas coast and areas further inland. Despite previously issued warnings, rough seas produced by the hurricane still caused several ship accidents. Strong waves forced several ships near Galveston to either become grounded or sunk. The derrick barge Miller and other craft were grounded along Galveston's West Bay. A large dredge was swept into the Galveston Causeway, snapping telegraph cables that ran along the length of the causeway. The Miriam was sunken by a submerged log, while the schooner Ed Gibbs was broken into pieces near La Porte. The steamboat El Siglo (The Century) remained stranded offshore for twelve hours in winds estimated at . Off of Mobile, Alabama, the high waves prevented ships from entering the Port of Mobile. Closer to the coast, the hurricane produced a storm surge of in Galveston and Velasco. However, due to the Galveston Seawall, much of the potential storm surge-related damage in Galveston was mitigated, though the seawall forced spray to rise in the air. Areas outside the seawall on the Galveston beach, including two fishing piers and pavilions were destroyed. On Galveston's Tarpon Pier, ten members of a fishing party perished after the pier collapsed, though six were rescued by the yacht Mayflower. In western areas of Galveston, where there was no seawall, inland areas were inundated under of water. However, Galveston's primary streets were submerged to a lesser extent, under of water. In Velasco, the tide was reported to have been higher than during the 1900 Galveston hurricane, which inundated the city under of water. Areas of Sabine Pass were also inundated by the high waves, and the Southern Pacific Railroad was submerged in water. alt=Old photo of a building that has part of its facade damaged. In Velasco, where the hurricane made landfall, only eight buildings remained intact after the storm's passage. Quintana, Columbus, and Columbia were also heavily affected, with all houses experiencing some form of severe damage. In Austin, homes were unroofed, and the storm was considered as the worst hurricane to affect Austin at the time. Heavy rains caused large amounts of driftwood to float down the Colorado River. In Austin, the driftwood struck the newly constructed Congress Avenue Bridge, carrying away of trestle and resulting in $10,000 in damages. Other cities also reported severely damaged homes and businesses. Galveston suffered minor damage, with reports of chimney damage and broken windows. Three sections of the Galveston Causeway were blown down by the strong winds. As a result, tug boats were forced to carry people and cargo to and from Galveston along West Bay. The Western Union Telegraph Company reportedly lost all direct communication with Galveston for a temporary period of time. Other telegraph companies in Dallas and Chicago also lost communications with the city. Property damage in Galveston was estimated at $100,000. Strong winds and gusts from the storm were reported as far inland as Eagle Pass. The winds uprooted trees and extensively damaged various crops, as well as downed power lines. In the Galveston Jetty, Rosenburg, and Brazoria, strong winds blew trains off of their tracks. Train stations and train depots along the coast also experienced considerable damage, with some depots being completely leveled. Maize fields which had been previously burned by wildfires caused by an ongoing drought in Kingsville were swept down, while cotton crops withstood the hurricane well. Oil derricks near Markham were blown down, and water wells were stripped of their machinery. In Alvin, barns and windmills were destroyed. Richmond also reported destroyed barns, as well as downed chimneys. Six prisoners escaped from the city's local jail after windows were blown in. Rice mills were downed in Eagle Pass. Damage was comparatively light in Louisiana. Heavy rains and storm surge inundated marshes, resulting in hundreds of reported cattle drownings. Cotton crops from Grand Chenier, Louisiana to Sabine Pass was destroyed by the rains and wind. Two deaths in Louisiana were reported in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. Further inland, the hurricane produced heavy rainfall in many areas, peaking at in Hallettsville, Texas, with rainfall totals of at least common in along the hurricane's track. Boerne, Fredericksbrug, and Columbia all set monthly records for 24‚Äëhour rainfall totals on July 21 and 22, with all three cities reporting totals of or greater. While the heavy rains caused damage in areas, it provided beneficial drought relief in other regions.

Glenn Miller and his Orchestra and Dick Jurgens and his Orchestra both charted with recordings of the composition. Background Elmer Albrecht originally composed the song in the early 1920s. At the time, he was a student at the Worsham College of Embalming in Chicago and worked at Louis Cohen‚Äôs funeral parlor on Clark Street. According to Albrecht, he originally worked out the tune on a piano in a back room of the funeral parlor which at the time held the corpses of twelve men killed in Chicago‚Äôs Tong Wars. Over the years, Albrecht, who continued to work as an embalmer, played the tune in honky tonks and small night clubs around Chicago. He offered it to Ted Weems, who turned it down. Then, in February 1941, he approached Dick Jurgens, whose band had a residency at Chicago's Aragon Ballroom. Albrecht worked nearby and had an arrangement to use one of the pianos at the venue during his lunch break. Albrecht made a nuisance of himself, and Jurgens, who was inundated with requests from song promoters, finally agreed to arrange Albrecht‚Äôs song for his orchestra . A short time later, Jurgens and his band were preparing to perform the tune (still nameless) on the radio. After a frantic effort by the radio announcer and two lyricists to come up with a title, Jurgens casually suggested ‚ÄúElmer‚Äôs Tune‚Äù and the name stuck. Jurgens recorded the song as an instrumental for Okeh Records (6209) on April 10, 1941. This version reached no.8 on the Billboard Best Selling Retail Records chart in October 1941. Glenn Miller recording Glenn Miller had the most successful recording of the song. His version reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts. The popularity of the tune prompted Glenn Miller to ask Jurgens if he could record a vocal version of the song. Robbins Music Company, the song‚Äôs publisher, hired Sammy Gallop to write the lyrics. Miller recorded his version of the song for RCA Bluebird (B-11274-A) on August 11, 1941 in New York with Ray Eberle on lead vocals and the Modernaires on backing vocals. This version was an even bigger success than Jurgens‚Äô recording, peaking at no.1 for one week on the Billboard Best Selling Retail Records chart for the week ending December 13, 1941, in a 20-week chart run.Song artist 6 - Glenn Miller..

His audacity earned him a reputation as the enfant terrible within the Alpine Club. He was also the head of the Middlemores Saddles leather goods company in Birmingham, England, after the retirement of his father, William Middlemore, in 1881.The London Gazette, 1 May 1882, page 3425, mentions partnership of William and Thomas dissolved due to retirement of William Thomas Middlemore had taken over the management of the company in 1868 and established a bicycle saddle factory in Coventry.  Mountaineering  The north-east face of the Aiguille Verte, with the Cordier Couloir marked in purple In August 1870 Middlemore climbed Monte Rosa, the Strahlhorn and the Wetterhorn with guide Jakob Anderegg of Meiringen while qualifying for membership of the Alpine Club. In 1872 he made a traverse of the Matterhorn together with Frederick Gardiner and the guides Jean-Joseph Maquignaz, Johann Jaun and Peter Knubel of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais. According to Claire Engel, Middlemore was one of the first alpinists to climb routes in the Alps of an unprecedented degree of difficulty and danger: Piz Bernina. Middlemore made the first ascent of the celebrated Biancograt (centre) The ethics of employing a guide and then taking him into an area where there was significant objective danger created a considerable controversy at the time. On 31 July 1876 Middlemore made the first ascent of the north-east face of the Aiguille Verte by what is now known as the Cordier Couloir with the London stockbroker John Oakley Maund, the Chamonix guide Henri Cordier, Grindelwald guides Johann Jaun, Andreas Maurer, and Jakob Anderegg. This book incorrectly gives the year of the Aiguille Verte climb as 1875. The route was not repeated until 1924, and according to Helmut Dumler is \\"one of the most respected achievements in the history of mountaineering, for the 900m couloir is set at an angle of up to 56¬∞\\". Engel notes that the party were all nearly obliterated by rockfall while they were crossing the bergschrund. On 7 August 1876 Middlemore and Maund, together with Henri Cordier, Jaun and Maurer, made the first ascent of one of the last remaining unclimbed 4000m summits of significance in the Alps: the east (and higher) summit of Les Droites. Again, their ascent was not without incident. In an article in the Alpine Journal Maund wrote: Two days later Middlemore, Cordier and Maund left Chamonix for Pontresina in the Bernina Range. Maund, suffering from poisoning having drunk from a can with a soldered brass nozzle, stayed behind in Geneva. Although Middlemore was himself ill, he made a number of important first ascents from his base in Pontresina with Maurer, Cordier and Jaun, starting with the first ascent of the serpentine Biancograt (\\"White ridge\\") on Piz Bernina on 12 August 1876, the Monte Rosso di Tschierva (a first ascent) and Piz Roseg from the Tschierva Glacier. On the first ascent of Piz Roseg's north ridge on 18 August Middlemore's foot was injured by a loose stone, causing him to faint from pain; Jaun prevented him from falling.The High Mountains of the Alps (Dumler, Burkhardt), p. 8.  Later life  Melsetter House, Hoy, Orkney Middlemore's father died in 1889, and Middlemore inherited the company outright. By this time Middlemore and his wife, Theodosia, were prominent figures in Birmingham. Middlemore sold the leather business in 1896. In 1898 he purchased the Melsetter Estate in the Orkney Islands of Scotland. The 40,000-acre estate included the island of Hoy and the smaller islands of South Walls, Fara and Rysa. Middlemore commissioned architect William Lethaby, a prominent figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement, to rebuild Melsetter House. Middlemore died of pneumonia at Melsetter on 16 May 1923.

It is the headquarters of the University of Bologna and of the rector of the university. History The Palazzo Poggi was built as the home of Alessandro Poggi and his brother the future Cardinal Giovanni Poggio. The building was erected between 1549 and 1560. The design of the Palazzo Poggi has been attributed to Bartolomeo Triachini. He was apparently given the commission for the Palazzo Poggi by the Bishop Giovanni Poggi shortly before he was elevated to Cardinal. Other sources attribute the design of the Palazzo Poggi to Pellegrino Tibaldi. Cardinal Poggi met Pellegrino Tibaldi after the painter moved to Rome in 1547, and later commissioned him to paint the Palazzo Poggi. Tibaldi, a native of Bologna, returned to the city in 1555 and painted frescos for the Cardinal in the palace and the family chapel. The frescoes are considered Tibaldi's masterpiece. In 1714 the Palazzo Poggi became the House of the Instituto dell Scienze of Bologna. The Institute of Sciences was founded by Luigi Ferdinando Marsili. The Tower Observatory (La Specola) was built between 1712 and 1725. The library was built in 1744 following designs by Giuseppe Antonio Torri and Carlo Francesco Dotti. The collection of images was begun in 1754. The monumental Great Hall of the institute was added to the north side of the palace in the eighteenth century, opened in 1756. The Institute of Science was a model learning establishment in Europe during the Age of Enlightenment and a key part of the University of Bologna. It enjoyed the protection of the Bolognese Pope Pope Benedict XIV (Prospero Lorenzo Lambertini). During the Napoleonic period, scientific equipment from the Institute was dispersed among different faculties (anatomy, optics, chemistry, geography, nautical science, physics, astronomy) and the historical collections were scattered in various museums. Only the library remained in the Palazzo Poggi, to form the nucleus of the future university library. The Palazzo is now one of the main buildings of the University of Bologna. At the end of the twentieth century, a cultural project was promoted by the University to return and gather the dispersed collections back to their historic home. Layout and usage The current appearance of the Palazzo Poggi, with a large courtyard with loggia and a large staircase to the piano nobile is due to the interventions by Cardinal Giovanni Poggi. The palace has fresco decorations mainly from the Mannerist and early-Baroque periods, the works include:Muuseo Palazzo Poggi mural decorations. *Rooms of Moses, David, and camerino of the Sphinxes by Prospero Fontana *Rooms of Susana and of the Zodiac by Pellegrino Tibaldi *Rooms of Camilla, Landscapes, the concert hall with Labors of Hercules, and of Winemaking Putti by Niccol√≤ dell'Abbate *Rooms of Grotteschi and Telemons by Fontana, Nosadella and Ercole Procaccini the Elder.

It was built around 1844 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Also known as Yglesia de Nuestra Senora de Candelaria de Dona Ana, it is adobe vernacular in style. With It is notable as the oldest example of an adobe vernacular church in southern New Mexico. According to its National Register nomination, its ornamentation and detail \\"is simple, reflecting the modest resources of the congregation that built it in the middle of the 19th century. The building is of a cruciform floor plan with thick walls made of adobe brick molded by the parishioners and carried up to the site from the valley land below. Until the 1920s, when it was covered with tongue and groove hardwood, the floor was of dirt which often had to be wetted to keep the dust down. As shown by the oldest available photograph of the church taken around 1910, it was built with a flat roof using the traditional viga (beam) and latilla (small poles laid across the vigas) ceiling, and sealed with packed mud that would routinely have to be maintained. This stark, massive structure of earth had a plain twin-leafed entrance with a small window above it. The windows along the church walls are the 6 over 6 double hung wood type. It was probably around the turn of the century that a small wood-louvered bell tower was built above the entrance. The church faces south onto an open dirt plaza which now serves as parking. A garden bordering the east side of the church is enclosed with a stone wall which features an open arch parallel to the church entry.\\" It is also a contributing building in the Dona Ana Village Historic District, listed on the National Register in 1996.

Early life  Shepard was born in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1945. Shepard first arrived in Spain with her father, an official with the U.S. Air Force, who was stationed at an air force base in Torrej√≥n de Ardoz. She moved to Madrid in 1963 to pursue studies in philosophy. However, she soon began modeling and appearing in Spanish television commercials, including a campaign for a brand of brandy. The roles would lead to more serious acting parts and she remained in Spain for the rest of her life. Her younger sister Judith Chapman is a television actress in the USA and had roles in Murder, She Wrote and The Young and the Restless.  Career  Her early television credits led to a small, debut film role in La ciudad no es para m√≠ (The City is Not For Me) in 1966, which launched her film career. She appeared in more than fifty films in Spain and Italy over the next twenty years, before retiring in 1988.

The television series was, in turn, adapted from Eric Chappell's stage play The Banana Box. Chappell adapted the play to television, and wrote the screenplay for this feature film. The film's director was Joseph McGrath. Leonard Rossiter plays Rupert Rigsby, the middle-aged landlord of a decrepit townhouse. Rigsby has fallen for his only female tenant, Ruth Jones (Frances de la Tour). Ruth, however, prefers Philip, who is much younger, more attractive, and more sophisticated than either Rigsby or her. Philip (Don Warrington) is not especially interested in Ruth, but he eggs Rigsby on in order to humiliate him. In adapting the television series to film, the setting was changed from Yorkshire to inner-city London. As Richard Beckinsale had died the year before, his character of Alan was rewritten with Christopher Strauli cast as a new character, art student John. The character of Alan is briefly referred to as having left Rigsby's house.

Its title is derived from French philosopher Alain Badiou's \\"Fifteen Theses on Contemporary Art\\". Maus said that he wrote the album in a \\"search for the perfect pop song\\". Upon release, the album was met with generally favorable reviews, a contrast from the reception of Maus' earlier work. Three singles were issued from the album: \\"Quantum Leap\\", \\"Believer\\" and \\"Hey Moon\\". Background After the release of Maus' first two albums, which generally drew negative reviews upon release, he was awarded a scholarship to study political philosophy at the University of Hawaii, where he had a day job as a lecturer. In the evenings, he continued working on music from his office. In 2009, Maus relocated from Hawaii to a secluded cabin in Minnesota, where he struggled to write material for a third album. He said that he eventually gave up, and instead began \\"doing lots of chemistry projects and chromatography experiments. I set myself on fire a few times heating inflammable solvents.\\" Meanwhile, he continued his studies at the European Graduate School in Saas Fee, Switzerland and earned his master's degree. He did not live in Switzerland, \\"but would go out there in the summers. It's like that Black Mountain thing that they did over here years ago, where they bring out all of the heavy hitters and you can study with them yourself.\\" One of his professors from the university was the French philosopher Alain Badiou, who would originate the title of the new album, We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves. Maus wrote the album in \\"search for the perfect pop song.\\" It included a cover version of Swedish singer-songwriter Molly Nilsson's \\"Hey Moon\\", which he described as \\"just banality, but like any great pop song, it‚Äôs much more than that. That‚Äôs what I was going for, to find something that was unassailable on all fronts, from a pop standpoint. Becoming the 'pitiless censor' myself.\\" Release Maus performing in 2011 We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves received largely positive reviews from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 20 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". New York Times writer W. M. Ferguson commented that, \\"Either because his songs evolved or because the culture caught up to him, there is now an audience for Maus‚Äôs music. ... by the end of his recent spring tour, he was doing his unhinged karaoke [concerts] to more or less packed houses.\\" Pitchfork highlighted the album as the moment's \\"Best New Music\\"; reviewer David Bevan wrote that it \\"is the most vibrant and toothsome expression of Maus' pursuits yet.\\" Jordan Redmond of Tiny Mix Tapes praised the album as \\"a lo-fi synth pop masterpiece that manages to give endless aural delights while still being intellectually engaging, and despite having been caught at the center of a whirlpool of current movements, all of which reflect some aspect of Maus‚Äô style, he has only cemented his identity as a singular, unimpeachable figure. When confronted with music like this, it‚Äôs impossible not to be a believer.\\" The Guardians Michael Hann wrote that the work is \\"hugely enjoyable, even without any theoretical justification.\\" PopMatters Maria Schurr compared the album's 1980s aesthetic to collaborator Ariel Pink's recent Before Today (2010), writing that Pitiless Censors is \\"less moody, more consistent in its sense of oddness and intrigue. ... as Before Today provided a breakthrough for Pink last year, We Must Become‚Ä¶ could very well do the same for Maus. The songs are clearly strong enough\\". Factmags Samuel Breen believed that while the music \\"is loaded with liminal pop anthems\\", it did not succeed at reflecting Maus' philosophical ideas: \\"too often these songs feel constrained by DIY ideologies and crude experimentation, and there are moments where the gulf between theory and sound could hardly be more distinct.\\" Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine awarded the album with a zero star rating, citing derivative synth instrumentation, \\"minimal accessibility\\", and \\"maximum pretension\\". He wrote that the album is \\"at best, like an unfinished video- game score and, at worst, like a Human League track played backward in a Walkman taped to the skull of a drowning man. Sometimes the instrumentals approximate a no-budget Disintegration in their misbegotten twinkliness, but no amount of lo-fi shimmer can compensate for the intentional inadequacy of the vocal lines and the utter lack of memorable melodies.\\" Track listing Note * \\"Cop Killer\\" is an arrangement of Peter Hajba's 1992 composition \\"Crystal Dragon\\" with newly-written lyrics by Maus.

It was first used as the rallying cry of the rebel forces during the Federal War, and it was subsequently incorporated into the country's coat of arms after the conflict ended in 1863.Carrera, p. 83 History According to an account by historian Jos√© Gil Fortoul, two French adventurers who had joined the forces of General Ezequiel Zamora near Barinas initially suggested that the customary ...your humble servant Spanish: Soy de usted atento servidor valediction in written communications be replaced with Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©, which was finally modified to Dios y Federaci√≥n. The phrase subsequently became emblematic of the rebel movement.Gallegos quoting Fortoul, p. 247 After the signing of the Treaty of Coche in April 1863 and the establishment of the new government by the victorious rebels, General Juan Cris√≥stomo Falc√≥n modified the official seal from 1836, replacing the word Liberty in the central ribbon with Dios y Federaci√≥n. The phrase would be used in subsequent redesigns of the seal until July 1930, when a decree replaced it with Estados Unidos de Venezuela,Carrera, p. 83 in reference to the First Republic of Venezuela. Later use Although without legal basis, the phrase has been traditionally considered the country's motto, even after it was officially abandoned. Today, its significance is more political than historical, since for many people in Venezuela it represents the desire to see a return to the decentralized federal system, away from the centralist and authoritarian regimes of recent years. The motto is still featured in the coat of arms of the state of Barinas. It was part of the state flag of Falc√≥n until 2006, and it is still used in official documents by the Judicial branch of Venezuela. Dios y Federaci√≥n was also used occasionally in official communications by the government of Alta California in the 1820s.Hittel, p. 106 See also * Coat of arms of Venezuela * History of Venezuela ReferencesBibliography  * Category:National mottos Category:Political catchphrases Category:History of Venezuela ","title":"Dios y Federaci√≥n"},{"id":"38207530","title":"Nick Howard discography"},{"id":"38207534","text":"Schwartz may refer to: *Schwartz (surname), a surname (and list of people with the name) *Schwartz (brand), a spice brand *Schwartz's, a delicatessen in Montreal, Quebec, Canada *Schwartz Publishing, an Australian publishing house *\\"Danny Schwartz\\", a police detective in the film Heat portrayed by Jerry Trimble *C.

Now in its 74th year of operation, the BAL continues to host art exhibitions, juried shows, and arts education for adults and children. It also maintains a permanent collection of art and art objects, primarily by local artists.  History  The league was founded in 1943 by a group of artists meeting weekly at the studio of Robert Stapp who decided to form a working group of painters to foster and stimulate fine arts and crafts in the Sabine area. Notable founding members included Will-Amelia Sterns Price and Tom Tierney. By 1944, the group moved to the YWCA and held its first art exhibition. It continued to hold annual membership exhibitions, traveling exhibitions, workshops, lectures, and summer art colonies taught by such accomplished national artists as Frederic Taubes and Jacob Getlar Smith. In 1949, the league raised the money to rent a house and formed the Beaumont Art Museum, now the Art Museum of Southeast Texas, which opened in 1950. The league organized many of the museum's activities over the coming years. In 1956, Colonel Sanford Perry Brown and his wife donated the money for a building (the Brown Gallery) at the Fairgrounds in North Beaumont. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the league moved several times while the museum remained at the Brown Gallery. The Browns donated funds for a second building in 1967 named the Scurlock Gallery. The league moved back to these buildings in 1968 and has remained there ever since. The museum expanded several times into other local buildings until finding its home in downtown Beaumont in 1987. In 1962, the league held the first Tri-State Exhibition, bringing in art from around Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. In 1998, this became the BAL National Exhibition, taking in art each year from around the country.

The film dramatizes the days leading up to Fountain‚Äôs disappearance near White Sands, New Mexico and the first, unsuccessful investigation of his apparent murder by John C. Fraser of the Pinkerton Agency. The film strongly suggests that Fountain‚Äôs disappearance was directly linked to his prosecution of Oliver M. Lee for cattle rustling. The narrative switches from Fountain‚Äôs investigation and arrest of Lee culminating in Fountain‚Äôs disappearance, to Fraser‚Äôs investigation, which concludes after a shootout at Lee‚Äôs ranch. Plot Mariana, a granddaughter of Albert Jennings Fountain, discovers her great grandson playing with her grandfather‚Äôs clothing and personal possessions. As she begins to tell him of Fountain‚Äôs history, the film flashes back to a New Mexico ranch in 1896, where Oliver Lee murders two ranchers and steals their cattle. Fountain, serving as Do√±a Ana County District Attorney, arrests a member of Lee‚Äôs gang in the case, and eventually apprehends Lee despite death threats. After Lee‚Äôs arraignment, Fountain is seen leaving town, never to be seen again. Following the disappearance, Pinkerton detective John C. Fraser arrives from Colorado to investigate and discovers Fountain‚Äôs wagon, disabled, where there is evidence of a struggle and blood. When suspicion leads to Oliver Lee, Fraser leads a small party to Lee‚Äôs ranch where they are ambushed by Lee and his gang. Fraser wounds Lee but ultimately retreats. The film ends with the case unresolved. Cast * Tim Maloney as Albert Jennings Fountain * Chris Norden as Oliver M. Lee * Algernon D‚ÄôAmmassa as John C.

Germain, 503 U.S. 249 (1992), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that an interlocutory order of a district court, sitting as an appellate court in a bankruptcy case, is in turn reviewable by the court of appeals when authorized under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1292. Although the Justices were unanimous in deciding the specific statutory interpretation issue concerning bankruptcy appeals that the case presented, they disagreed on the extent to which it was appropriate to refer to the legislative history of the statute in resolving the case.  Background  In the United States, bankruptcy cases and many lawsuits involving a bankrupt party are heard by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the appropriate judicial district. Appeals from Bankruptcy Court decisions are ordinarily taken to the United States District Court for that district. Under Section 158(d) of title 28 of the United States Code, appeals from final judgments of the district courts in bankruptcy cases may be taken to the Court of Appeals for the circuit. However, Section 158(d) contained no provision for appeals from interlocutory, or non-final, District Court decisions in such cases. A separate provision of title 28, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1292, addresses appeals from the District Court to the Court of Appeals where a District Court's decision is interlocutory, that is, is not the final decision in the case. (Section 1292 deals with all federal civil cases, as opposed to section 158 which deals specifically with bankruptcy cases.) Ordinarily, in the federal system, only final judgments may be appealed from the District Court to the Court of Appeals, under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1291. Section 1292 creates limited exceptions to this rule, including appeals from orders granting or denying injunctions, or cases in which the District Court and the Court of Appeals grant special permission to appeal. In a bankruptcy case pending in Connecticut, a dispute arose as to whether the parties were entitled to a jury trial. The Bankruptcy Court ruled in favor of a jury trial, and on appeal, the District Court affirmed. The defendant, Connecticut National Bank, then sought to appeal this interlocutory ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but that court held it had no jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a dispute as to whether a District Court's interlocutory order on a bankruptcy appeal was appealable to the Court of Appeals in the circumstances authorized under section 1292. The case was argued by Janet C. Hall, now a federal judge in Connecticut, for the petitioner, and by bankruptcy trustee Thomas M. Germain for himself as respondent.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the Court's opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter. In his opinion, Justice Thomas reviewed the language of the different statutory provisions, concluding that while there was some overlap between the provisions of Section 158 and Sections 1291 and 1292, each section also covers some cases that the other would not. Thomas observed that \\"[r]edundancies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting, and so long as there is no \\"positive repugnancy\\" between two laws ... a court must give effect to both.\\" Thomas asserted that the meaning of the statutes was clear from their wording. Therefore, he asserted, there was no need for the Court to examine the legislative history of Section 158. The opinion concluded that \\"[t]here is no reason to infer from either ¬ß 1292 or ¬ß 158(d) that Congress meant to limit appellate review of interlocutory orders in bankruptcy proceedings. So long as a party to a proceeding or case in bankruptcy meets the conditions imposed by ¬ß 1292, a court of appeals may rely on that statute as a basis for jurisdiction.\\"  Opinions concurring in the judgment  Two Justices, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor authored brief opinions \\"concurring in the judgment,\\" meaning that they agreed with the outcome of the case but not with the reasoning of the majority. Justices Byron R. White and Harry Blackmun joined O'Connor's concurrence. Justice Stevens began his opinion by stating that \\"[w]henever there is some uncertainty about the meaning of a statute, it is prudent to examine its legislative history.\\" Here, the legislative history of Section 158(d) contained no indication that this statute was intended to supersede Sections 1291 or 1292. Stevens stated that he agreed with the Court's decision for this reason, in addition to the majority's textual analysis. Justice O'Connor's one-paragraph opinion observed that the Court's decision did create some redundancy between the different provisions of title 28. However, she found it \\"far more likely that Congress inadvertently created a redundancy than that Congress intended to withdraw appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory bankruptcy appeals by the roundabout method of reconferring jurisdiction over appeals from final bankruptcy orders,\\" and joined in voting to reverse the Second Circuit's judgment only for this reason.

The Penitents were a group of pro- Alid Kufans led by Sulayman ibn Surad, a companion of Muhammad, who wished to atone for their failure to assist Husayn ibn Ali in his abortive uprising against the Umayyads in 680. Pro-Alid Kufans had urged Husayn to revolt against the Umayyad caliph Yazid but then failed to assist him when he was killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680. Initially a small underground movement, the Penitents received widespread support in Iraq after the death of Yazid in 683. They were deserted by most of their supporters shortly before the departure to northern Syria where a large Umayyad army under the command of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad was preparing to launch an assault on Iraq. In the three-day long battle that ensued at Ras al-'Ayn, the small Penitent army was annihilated and its senior leaders, including Ibn Surad, were killed. Nevertheless, this battle proved to be a forerunner and source of motivation for the later more successful movement of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi. Background The first Umayyad caliph Muawiyah's designation of his son Yazid as heir in 676 had been opposed by many who resented his rise to the caliphate. Hereditary succession was alien to Arab custom, where the rulership passed within the wider clan, and Islamic principles, where the supreme authority over the Muslim community was not the possession of any man. Opposition was led especially by the sons of a few prominent companions of Muhammad, who, according to Islamicist G. R. Hawting, could lay \\"some claim to be considered as caliphal candidates\\" by virtue of their descent. They refused to be bribed or cajoled into acknowledging Yazid. After Muawiyah's death in April 680, Yazid ordered the governor of Medina, where all his opponents were based, to obtain their obedience. Of these, Husayn ibn Ali and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr evaded the governor and escaped to Mecca. There Husayn received letters from the Iraqi garrison town of Kufa with the invitation to revolt against Yazid and regain his rightful place as the leader of the Muslim community which his father, Ali (), had previously held. Husayn sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to prepare the ground for his arrival. Ibn Aqil sent back a favorable report, urging Husayn to depart for Kufa. Shortly afterwards, Ibn Aqil was apprehended and executed by the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad and his supporters suppressed. Unaware of the situation, Husayn left for Kufa, but was intercepted and killed just outside of the town. His expected support never arrived. Belligerents=Penitents= tile-work in Kermanshah, Iran, depicting the Penitent army Some of Husayn's supporters in Kufa, who called themselves Penitents, blamed themselves for the disaster and decided to atone for their perceived sinful abandonment of their leader. Considering the prohibition of suicide in Islam, they decided to sacrifice themselves in a fight against the perpetrators of the massacre, to achieve salvation and martyrdom. Sulayman ibn Surad, a companion of Muhammad and old ally of Ali, was chosen as leader of the movement. Meanwhile Yazid died in 683 and Umayyad authority collapsed across the Caliphate, giving rise to the civil war known as the Second Fitna. Ibn Ziyad was expelled from Iraq and he fled to Syria. This afforded the Penitents their opportunity to act. A large-scale recruiting campaign was launched which met with considerable success and 16,000 men joined the movement. On the day of departure though, only 4,000 men arrived, of whom another 1,000 left on the way. Undeterred, the Penitents moved up the Euphrates River towards the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia). They were all mounted and well-equipped. =Umayyads= The short reign of Yazid's successor Muawiyah II ended with his death after a few weeks. With no suitable Sufyanid candidate to succeed him, Umayyad loyalists in Syria chose Marwan ibn al- Hakam, a cousin of Muawiyah I, as the caliph. Marwan's accession was challenged by several north-Syrian tribes led by Banu Qays who supported the cause of the Mecca-based counter-caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. Marwan defeated them with a small army of 6,000 at the Battle of Marj Rahit (684). Following the victory, he sent Ibn Ziyad back to Iraq. Realizing that his forces were not strong enough to reconquer the province, Ibn Ziyad set out to strengthen the Umayyad army by recruiting from various Syrian Arab tribes, which included even the tribes that had opposed Marwan at the Battle of Marj Rahit. By the time he faced the Penitents, Ibn Ziyad had raised a formidable army of Syrians. Battle On their march towards Syria, the Penitents made a short stay at al-Qarqisiya. The Qaysi refugees from the Battle of Marj Rahit of the previous year had entrenched themselves there and aided the Penitents with supplies. The Qaysi chief Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi informed Ibn Surad of the Umayyad troops' location and advised him to march on Ayn al-Warda (identified with modern Ras al-Ayn) and arrive there before the Umayyads, as the town could be used as a base of operations in the arid steppes. Given the large numerical disparity, Zufar urged him to avoid a pitched battle and instead divide his cavalry into small detachments and conduct constant skirmishes against their flanks, \\"firing arrows at them and thrusting at them in an open space for they outnumber you and you cannot be sure that you will not be surrounded\\". Noticing the absence of infantry in the Penitents' force, Zufar also advised to pair the detachments so that one could fight mounted and the other fighting on foot when needed. Despite showing sympathy, Zufar refrained from joining the Penitents outright, seeing no hope in their endeavor. Nevertheless he offered Ibn Surad to stay in al-Qarqisiya and fight the Umayyads alongside him, but Ibn Surad refused. Following Zufar's advice, the Penitents camped outside Ayn al-Warda, with the town in their rear. They rested for five days before the Umayyad army arrived. The total strength of the latter was 20,000, but it was divided into two units due to disputes between its two field commanders. Some 8,000 troops were under the command of Shurahbil ibn Dhi'l-Kala, and the rest were under Husayn ibn Numayr. Shurahbil arrived first, ahead of Ibn Numayr, and made camp. The Penitents attacked him and his troops fled. The next day, Ibn Numayr arrived with his troops. He called on the Penitents to surrender, who in turn demanded the surrender of the Umayyad army and the handing over of Ibn Ziyad, the supreme commander of the Umayyad forces, to be executed for his involvement in the death of Husayn. The battle began on Wednesday, 4 January. Ibn Surad divided the Penitents into three groups, sending two to attack the Umayyad flanks, while he himself remained in the center. On the first day, the Penitents were able to repel the Umayyads, but on the next day, Ibn Ziyad sent Shurahbil back to fight under the command of Ibn Numayr, and the numerical superiority of the Umayyad army began to prevail. Despite holding the ground, the Penitents suffered severe losses. On the third day of the battle, they were completely surrounded. Ibn Surad ordered his men to dismount and advance on foot to engage in one-on-one combat. The Umayyad army started raining arrows on them and the Penitents were almost annihilated. Ibn Surad fell to an arrow shot, and of the remaining four commanders, three were killed in quick succession. Finally, the Penitents' banner passed to the last commander, Rifa ibn Shaddad. At this point, the Penitents received the news that their supporters from al-Mada'in and Basra were on the way to join them, but they had been completely destroyed by now, so instead of waiting for the reinforcements, Rifa retreated with a few survivors and escaped to al-Qarqisiya during the night. Aftermath The small number of Penitents who survived felt remorse for not having fulfilled their vows of sacrifice. They went over to join another pro-Alid leader, Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, who had earlier been prevented by the Umayyad governor from assisting Husayn in the Battle of Karbala. Mukhtar had been critical of the Penitents movement for its lack of organization and political program. With Ibn Surad gone, Mukhtar became the undisputed leader of the pro-Alid Kufans. He had long-term plans and a more organized movement; he appropriated the Penitents' slogan of \\"Revenge for Husayn\\", but also advocated for the establishment of an Alid caliphate in the name of Ali's son Muhammad ibn al- Hanafiyyah. In contrast to the Penitents, which had been a purely Arab movement, Mukhtar also appealed to local non-Arab converts (mawƒÅlƒ´). In addition, he was able to win over an influential military commander and the chief of the Nakha tribe, Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar. With his combined forces, he seized Kufa, and consequently its eastern and northern dependencies, in October 685. Later he sent a considerably large and professional army of 13,000, which consisted mostly of infantry, under Ibn al-Ashtar, to fight the Umayyads. Ibn al-Ashtar destroyed the Umayyad army at the Battle of Khazir and killed Ibn Ziyad, Ibn Numayr, and Shurahbil. Mukhtar controlled most of Iraq, parts of the Jazira, Arminiya, and parts of western and northern Iran (Adharbayjan and Jibal), before he was killed by the Zubayrid governor of Basra Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr in April 687.

The regiment saw brief but intense action in the invasion of Normandy before being broken up to provide replacements to other units. Origin 153rd RAC was formed by conversion to the armoured role of the 8th Battalion, Essex Regiment, a hostilities-only infantry battalion that had been raised during 1940.https://web.archive.org/web/20051225191106/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/inf/044Essex.htm The battalion had been serving in 226th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), a Home Defence formation, when the whole brigade was converted into 34th Army Tank Brigade on 1 December 1941.Joslen, pp. 207, 389. The regiment served in the brigade alongside the North Irish Horse and 147 RAC and later 151 RAC (later redesignated 107 RAC) when the North Irish Horse was transferred elsewhere. In common with other infantry battalions transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, the personnel of 153 RAC would have continued to wear their Essex Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps.Forty pp. 50‚Äì1. During the conversion, surplus personnel were formed into 'R' Company, Essex Regiment, which soon afterwards was designated V Corps HQ Defence Company.153 RAC War Diary, December 1941, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 166/1438. Training 153 RAC began to receive its first Churchill tanks in March 1942; it had its full scale of equipment by the end of August. Having been billeted in Swindon, Wiltshire, the regiment moved with 34th Tank Brigade to Eastern England and then the South Coast for training.153 RAC War Diary, 1942, The National Archives, file WO 166/6945. At the end of 1942 it moved to Broome Park, Kent, which remained the regiment's base for the next year, utilising firing ranges across Southern England.153 RAC War Diary, 1943, The National Archives, file WO 166/11117. In early 1944, as training intensified for the coming Normandy invasion, 153 RAC moved to Folkestone in Kent, and then Headley, Surrey, before finally moving to its Marshalling Area near Portsmouth at the end of June.153 RAC War Diary, January‚ÄìJune 1944, The National Archives, file WO 171/881. Service 153 RAC was transported to Normandy from 2‚Äì4 July. As an independent brigade under 21st Army Group, 34th Tank Brigade could be assigned to support any infantry division that required the assistance of tanks, its regiments usually split up to form brigade groups with the infantry. On 9 July, 153 RAC was ordered to move to I Corps' front to prepare for an attack on Caen, but the fall of the city (Operation Charnwood) led to the cancellation of the move. 153 RAC finally went into action on 16 July, when 34 Tank Brigade supported 227th Brigade of 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division in an attack in the Esquay‚Äì√âvrecy area west of Caen. The object of the operation was to 'hold the attention of the enemy to that front while preparations for a breakthrough were being made east of Caen' 'Actions of 34 Tank Brigade 15‚Äì18 July 1944' in 153 RAC War Diary July 1944, The National Archives, file WO 171/881. (referring to the forthcoming Operation Goodwood).Ellis, p. 334. The last phase of 227 Brigade and 34 Tank Brigade's joint operation was an attack on the wooded area of Gavrus and Bougy by 8th Battalion, Royal Scots and 153 RAC. Some Churchill Crocodile flamethrowing tanks and Churchill AVREs were assigned to support the operation but were not used. The attack began at 05.30 on 16 July, and the final objective was reached by 10.25, but there were still enemy troops in the woods to be mopped up. An early casualty was the regimental commanding officer, hit in the back while climbing into his tank. At 14.50 the Germans counter-attacked with a mixed force, and the British claimed to have destroyed a Tiger tank. In a second counter-attack later in the afternoon the Germans lost another Tiger and three Panther tanks. The regimental war diary refers to 'a slogging match' throughout the rest of the day. Casualties included the commander of 'A' Squadron and four of his crews who crossed a ridge to deal with machine-guns on the flank. Their burnt-out tanks were discovered weeks later near √âvrecy.153 RAC War Diary, July 1944, The National Archives, file WO 171/881. The counter-attacks dwindled after 18.00, and 153 withdrew into its forward rally position. It was in this that the majority of the casualties occurred. A considerable number of tks were damaged and crews injured through intense mortar fire'. The following day, 153 RAC formed two composite squadrons, absorbing the remnants of 'A' Squadron. 'C' Squadron spent 17 July north of Bougy as an immediate counter-attack force, and was heavily mortared. 'B' Sqn supported an attack by 147 RAC and 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division. 'B' Squadron was soon engaged by enemy armour and the battle continued until nightfall, with casualties including the squadron commander. 153 RAC's total casualties for this two-day operation comprised 10 tanks knocked out or destroyed, 16 officers and 70 other ranks killed, wounded, or missing. The crews had been in their tanks for 30 hours without relief, either in action or instant readiness. Over succeeding days, the regiment was rested and reorganised. From 23 July, it returned to supporting other formations in a defensive role around Bougy and Maltot. In early August, its tanks fired in support of raids by 158th Brigade of 53rd (Welsh) Division trying to establish whether 10th SS Panzer Division was still in front.153 RAC War Diary, August 1944, The National Archives, file WO 171/881. It transpired that the Germans were withdrawing. On 5 August, 153 RAC made a rapid cross-country move to Mondrainville to support 177th Brigade of 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, which was attacking towards Mont Pincon. The operation was mounted so hurriedly that there was no time to organise a proper tie-up between tanks and infantry. Next, 153 RAC was transferred to support 197th Brigade of the 59th (Staffordshire) Division, which crossed the River Orne on 9 August. The following day, it followed the retreating enemy, carrying infantry aboard its tanks. The regiment continued in the line until 15 August, supporting infantry and helping to clear up pockets of resistance. Disbandment On 17 August, 153 RAC learned that it was to be disbanded, due to a severe manpower shortage, to provide replacements for other regiments. 'C' Squadron was transferred complete to 107 RAC; the rest of the personnel went to the other regiments of 34th Tank Brigade or to holding units. The regiment ceased to exist on 28 August 1944. 153 RAC was replaced in 34 Tank Brigade by 9th Royal Tank Regiment.Joslen, p. 207. NotesReferences * Major L. F.

Juutila foundry was founded in 1881. Juutila Foundry (Juutilan valimo or Metallivalimo H & E Juutilainen in Finnish) is situated in a village of Vehkalahti in Kaavi, Northern Savonia. Juutila Foundry Museum is in the old foundry building. It is a unique museum of its kind in the Nordic countries introducing the traditional sand casting method of the foundry. Juutila Foundry, Municipality of Kaavi, January 12, 2013  History  Juutila Foundry casts products out of bronze and brass. The foundry can make single pieces up to 500 kg (about 1100 lb). The different kinds of bells and mortars and pestles were one of the main products in the early history of the foundry. The products of Juutila were originally sold as far as in Vyborg and Sortavala in Karelia.Historic ironworks in Savo, 1999 Some of the products found their way even to St. Petersburg. Salminen, Anja: Valumestari Eljaksen kellot kaikuvat jouluna kautta maan, Taloussanomat, December 24, 1998, In the 1940s the foundry made a large number of school bells. Five men were working in the foundry then. In the 1960s Juutila Foundry started to make church bells, which became the main products in the 1980s and 1990s. Pohjois-Savon kulttuuriymp√§rist√∂selvitys, Kaavi, Pohjois-Savon liitto, 2009 Nowadays Juutila Foundry manufactures about half a dozen church bells annually. Foundry worked the first hundred years in an old workshop. The new foundry building of brick was built in 1982. = Craftsmanship since 1881 = Nowadays Mr Eljas Juutilainen carries on the tradition of his forebears by sand casting. The craft of casting and foundry work came to Juutila farm with Juutilainen's grandfather's uncle from nearby Juankoski ironworks. The history of Juutila Foundry dates back to 1881. Mr Eljas Juutilainen is a third-generation craftsman. He has been working at the foundry more than 40 years. Juutilainen was awarded Finnish State Award of Industrial Arts in 1975. Finnish Chambers of Commerce has given him Golden Medal of Merit. Cross of Merit of the Order of the Lion of Finland was awarded him by President of Finland.

His autobiography, They Call Me Baba Booey, was released on November 2, 2010. Early life and career Dell'Abate was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and raised in Uniondale, New York, on Long Island. He comes from a large Italian-American family. His father, Salvatore Dell'Abate, was a salesman for H√§agen-Dazs ice cream, while his mother, Ellen (n√©e Cotroneo) was a food demonstrator at Macy's in New York City and Fortunoff on Long Island. Dell'Abate attended Adelphi University, receiving the Richard F. Clemo Award his senior year, and he interned at several radio stations including WLIR. While working with Roz Frank, a traffic reporter on WNBC, he came into contact with Howard Stern.  The Howard Stern Show  Dell'Abate has worked on The Howard Stern Show since September 4, 1984: originally on 66 WNBC, then syndicated through K-Rock in New York City, and later broadcast on Sirius XM Radio. Dell'Abate was originally hired for $150 a week, with duties including getting Stern's lunch and scheduling guests for the show. Previously nicknamed \\"Boy Gary\\" (Howard called his college roommate Dr. Lew Weinstein \\"boy\\" when giving an order; preceded by \\"Boy\\" Lee Davis at WNBC), Dell'Abate's \\"Baba Booey\\" moniker originated on The Howard Stern Show on July 26, 1990, after telling a story of his prized collection of animation cels. In the course of discussing a Quick Draw McGraw cel he might purchase, he misstated the name of McGraw's sidekick Baba Looey as \\"Baba Booey\\". As is typical of the show, the rest of the cast \\"goofed\\" on his mistake, becoming especially merciless since he was mulling the purchase of a cel of a character without even knowing the character's correct name. Speaking to Howard at the end of the show, Dell'Abate said, \\"I think we've taken this as far as it will go.\\" Howard Stern replied, \\"Gary, we've only scratched the surface of this.\\" Dell'Abate remains Baba Booey to this day. Eventually, he titled his autobiography They Call Me Baba Booey. Dell'Abate later recalled that when he watched the cartoon as a child, Quick Draw would often call Baba Looey \\"Baba Boy\\", usually in frantic moments (\\"Help me, Baba Boy!\\"). Quick Draw's drawn- out pronunciation of \\"boy\\" often sounded like \\"booey\\", which led Dell'Abate to think that the character's name was actually \\"Baba Booey\\". \\"Baba Booey\\" as a term has become a mantra for fans of The Howard Stern Show and is often used during prank calls to live network television or radio broadcasts; for example, a call made by a prank caller nicknamed Maury From Brooklyn to ABC News during the low-speed police chase of O. J. Simpson's Ford Bronco through the streets of Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, signed off with \\"And Baba Booey to y'all!\\" Sportscaster Al Michaels explained to anchor Peter Jennings the significance of the phrase. In the 2012 Olympics, Freestyle wrestler Jake Herbert yelled \\"Baba Booey\\" as the camera panned over Team USA during the opening ceremony. Since then it has become a trend in sporting events where concentration and silence are expected, for spectators to shout \\"Baba Booey!\\" as in the case of the PGA Tour as soon as a golfer has completed his swing.  Personal life  Dell'Abate has been married since 1992 to Mary Dell'Abate (n√©e Caracciolo). They have two sons, Lucas and Jackson. After Dell'Abate's brother Steven died of AIDS in January 1991, Dell'Abate became a supporter of LIFEbeat: The Music Industry Fights AIDS and served as the charity's president. Dell'Abate wrote his autobiography, They Call Me Baba Booey, which was a New York Times best seller. It debuted at #6 on the NY Times Best Seller list in November 2010. In the book, Dell'Abate tells the story of his brother's death from AIDS, his mother's struggle with depression as well as his rise to executive producer of The Howard Stern Show. He was featured in the May 2007 issue of Sound and Vision magazine where his home theater was profiled. Dell'Abate is an avid New York Mets fan, and, on May 9, 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at a Mets game. The pitch did not go well, as it landed down the third-base line and hit an umpire. He later attended the 2015 World Series with fellow Howard Stern Show co-worker Richard Christy (who is a Kansas City Royals fan). Dell'Abate is also a fan of the New York Islanders hockey team, and was interviewed for the 2012 book, Dynasty: The Oral History of the New York Islanders, 1972‚Äì1984, by author Greg Prato. Dell'Abate's thoughts and memories of following the Islanders (he also interned for the television station that broadcast the team's games at the time, SportsChannel) are featured throughout the book, as well as several photos of Dell'Abate with Islanders players at a Stanley Cup victory parade in 1980.Dynasty: The Oral History of the New York Islanders, 1972-1984. Retrieved 2012-12-30. On Monday, March 14, 2011, Dell'Abate was appointed to the Greenwich, Connecticut Board of Parks and Recreation on a 119‚Äì64 vote margin.

It was situated immediately north of the present large building of North Devon District Hospital New Raleigh House, built after 1745 by Nicholas Hooper on ground immediately above the site of the ancient manor house of the Chichesters, reported as in ruins in 1745Dean Milles' Questionnaire of about 1745, the manor house of Raleigh was described as \\"Rawleigh in Ruins\\"(Reed, p.5) The historic manor of Raleigh, near Barnstaple and in the parish of Pilton, North Devon, was the first recorded home in the 14th century of the influential Chichester family of Devon. It was recorded in the Doomsday Book of 1086 together with three other manors that lie within the later-created parish of Pilton. Pilton as a borough had existed long before the Norman Conquest and was one of the most important defensive towns in Devon under the Anglo-Saxons. The manor lies above the River Yeo on the southern slope of the hill on top of which exists the ruins of the Anglo-Saxon hillfort of Roborough Castle. The historic manor of Raleigh is now the site of the North Devon District Hospital. Domesday Book Under the heading Terra(e) Ep(iscop)i Constantiensis (\\"Lands of the Bishop of Coutances\\" (Geoffrey de Montbray (died 1093)) and under the sub heading Infra scriptas t(er)ras tenet Drogo de Ep(iscop)o (\\"The undermentioned lands Drogo holds from the Bishop\\"), is the following entry for Raleigh, 28th of 99 Devon holding of the Bishop (translated into English): \\"Raleigh. Brictric held it before 1066. It paid tax for 1/2 hide. Land for 4 ploughs. In lordship 1 plough; 4 slaves; 1 virgate, 4 villagers and 4 smallholders with 1 plough and 1 virgate; meadow 2 acres; pasture 5 acres; woodland 30 acres; 2 cattle; 30 sheep; 16 goats. Value formerly and now 30 shillings\\". Drogo was probably \\"Drogo son of Mauger\\" mentioned in another nearby entry and was one of the Bishop's knights and his largest tenant in Devon, and held about 70 manors from him.Thorn, Caroline & Frank (Eds.), Domesday Book, Vol.9, Devon, Chichester, 1985, chap. 3 On the death of Geoffrey de Mowbray in 1093 his heir was his nephew Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria (died 1125), who rebelled unsuccessfully against King William II in 1095 and forfeited his lands to the crown. King William II then re-granted most of the de Mowbray lands to Juhel de Totnes (died 1123/30), the first feudal baron of Barnstaple.Thorn, Caroline & Frank (Eds.), Domesday Book, Vol.9, Devon, Chichester, 1985, chap. 3 The manor thus became a constituent part of the Feudal barony of Barnstaple and the barons remained the feudal overlords for many centuries. In the Book of Fees Raleigh was in the same ownership as Challacombe, which was also a Domesday manor held by Drogo from the Bishop of Coutances. In the 19th century Challacombe was sold by the Chichesters to the Fortescues of Filleigh. Raleigh family The holders of Raleigh through the 14th century were a family that took its name from the manor, the Raleigh family of Raleigh. The early ancestry of this Raleigh family, along with that of other Devon Raleigh families,Sir William Pole identified six different families, with different arms has been studied in much depth, largely as a result of enquiries into the origins of the famous Elizabethan adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh, but no clear early pedigree has emerged.See e.g. Brushfield, T. N., FSA, \\"Raleghana Part III, Remarks on the Ancestry of Sir Walter Raleigh\\", read at Totnes, August, 1900 This Raleigh family also held the manor of \\"Auvrington\\" (Arlington, Devon), as recorded in the Book of Fees, held from the overlord Philip de Culumbars (died 1342), of Nether Stowey, 2nd husband of Eleanor FitzMartin, sister and one of two co- heiresses of William FitzMartin (died 1326), feudal baron of Barnstaple.Thorn, Vol.2, chap38,1, quoting \\"Fees, p.782\\" Arlington was thus also inherited by the Chichesters from Raleigh. Thomasine Raleigh, daughter and eventual sole heiress of Sir John de Raleigh of Raleigh married Sir John Chichester. Her Inquisition post mortem states that she died on 7 August 1402.Inquisition post mortem 5 Henry IV (1403), no.36, quoted by Vivian, p.172.

He is the head of the Saudi Arabian royal family, the House of Saud. The king is called the \\"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\\" (), a title that signifies Saudi Arabia's jurisdiction over the mosques of Masjid al Haram in Mecca and Al-Masjid an- Nabawi in Medina, the title has been used many times through the history of Islam. The first Saudi monarch to use the title was King Faisal, however, King Khaled did not use the title after him. In 1986, King Fahd replaced \\"His Majesty\\" with the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and it has been ever since used by both King Abdullah and King Salman bin Abdulaziz. History King Abdulaziz (known in the West as Ibn Saud) regained his patrimony, which is known as today's Saudi Arabia in 1902. Restoring his family as emirs of Riyadh, he then established Nejd as his headquarters in 1922. Following the establishment of Riyadh as the capital of his state, King Abdulaziz then captured Hejaz 1925. Ibn Saud proclaimed his dominions as the Sultanate of Nejd in 1921, shortly before completing the unification of the region. He was proclaimed king/malik of Hejaz in 1926, and raised Nejd to a kingdom as well in 1927. For the next five years, Ibn Saud administered the two parts of his realm as separate units. In 23 September 1932, he formally united his territories into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Succession The kings since Ibn Saud's death have all been his sons, and all likely immediate successors to the reigning King Salman will be from among his progeny. Sons of Ibn Saud are considered to have primary claim on the throne of Saudi Arabia. This makes the Saudi monarchy quite distinct from Western monarchies, which usually feature large, clearly defined royal families and orders of succession, and use the absolute primogeniture system of succession. Muhammad bin Nayef was the first grandson of Ibn Saud to be in the line of succession before being deposed from the position of Crown Prince by a royal decree in 2017. Legal position Saudi Arabia is ruled by Islamic law (Sharia) and is an Islamic state. Other functions The king of Saudi Arabia is also considered the head of the House of Saud and prime minister. The crown prince is also the \\"deputy prime minister\\". The kings after Faisal have named a \\"second deputy prime minister\\" as the subsequent heir after the crown prince. Royal Standard The Royal Standard consists of a green flag, with an Arabic inscription and a sword featured in white, and with the national emblem embroidered in gold in the lower right canton. Royal Standard of the King The script on the flag is written in the Thuluth script. It is the shahada or Islamic declaration of faith: : : '''' :There is no other god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God.

Buildings are constructed of natural materials and energy obtained from renewable sources. Planning permission took some years to obtain, but has established a replicable template for similar future developments in Wales. Development The project was the first ecovillage in the UK to attain prospective planning permission, and this was achieved in 2009 after a three-year planning campaign culminating in a public hearing. The project had applied under an innovative local planning policy designed to support low-impact development. The policy required residents to live a sustainable lifestyle and substantially support themselves from land-based livelihood. Concept The ecovillage is centered on a Community Hub, from which courses, conferences and open days are run. It was constructed using local timber, straw bale insulation and locally sourced aggregate as well as incorporating various green technologies (such as a masonry stove, passive solar heating and a wood-fired kitchen). Funding for the Community Hub came from the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The project has been designed as a replicable template - with each household purchasing a 1000-year agricultural lease from the organisation which provides them with autonomy and security. Each household has access to approximately of land from which they derive food, fuel and income. One resident utilises permaculture techniques for managing the land, and electricity is generated by solar panels and a micro hydro turbine. The nine smallholdings demonstrate a range of natural building techniques though there have been challenges over compliance with building regulations which led to some of the residents being taken to court by Pembrokeshire County Council. These issues have since been resolved. The site is listed by RCAHMW and featured on Channel 4's Grand Designs, Series 17, Episode 6 in 2016. Post-establishment Since Lammas, the Welsh Government introduced a national low-impact policy, \\"One Planet Development\\", which creates a framework for land-based smallholdings and ecovillage projects to be established in Wales.Welsh Government, Technical Advice Note 6, Planning for sustainable rural communities, July 2010, 4.15 - 4.23 One house, built at a cost of ¬£27,000 over several years, was destroyed by fire in January 2018, with a total re-build estimate of ¬£500,000.

She is known for exploring powerful themes of family, and intense themes of racism faced by African Americans in the Deep South, in works that are accessible to young readers. She was awarded the 1977 Newbery Medal for her novel Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry and the inaugural NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature in 2003. Biography Taylor was born in Jackson, Mississippi in 1943, and is the great- granddaughter of a former slave who was the son of an African-Indian woman and a white landowner. As a young child she moved to Toledo, Ohio where she attended Toledo's public schools and eventually graduated from the University of Toledo in 1965. She then spent two years with the Peace Corps in Ethiopia, and, after returning to the United States, earned a master's degree in journalism at the University of Colorado where she was instrumental in creating a Black Studies Program as a member of the Black Student Alliance. She now lives in Colorado. Taylor's books chronicle the lives of several generations of the Logan family, from times of slavery to the Jim Crow era. Her most recognizable work is Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry (1976), which won the Newbery Medal in 1977 and has been integrated into the language arts curriculum in many classrooms across the United States. \\"Roll of Thunder\\" is flanked by several books that include titles such as Song of the Trees (1975), Let the Circle Be Unbroken (1981), The Road to Memphis (1992), and The Land (2001).\\"Logans series\\" at Goodreads.

The Newman Center's offices and chapel stand adjacent to the historic church. The structure, an example of Territorial Victorian Romanesque Revival architecture, was constructed with bricks fired nearby with clay from Fort McDowell and is adorned with twelve stained glass windows. The bell tower, rising above the double-door entrance, houses a bell constructed in St. Louis in 1903 specially for the church. A 2019-2020 renovation of the interior undertaken by Mary College at ASU, in conjunction with the All Saints Catholic Newman Center, added a new paint scheme and a mural of Our Lady of Guadalupe emblazoned with her words to St. Juan Diego, ‚Äú¬øNo estoy yo aqu√≠, yo que tengo el honor de ser tu Madre?‚Äù (Am I not here, I who have the honor of being your mother?)

Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure Ltd., 536 U.S. 88 (2002), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a corporation organized under the laws of a British overseas territory is considered a \\"citizen or subject of a foreign state\\" for purposes of federal court jurisdiction.  Background  Chase Manhattan Bank (which later became JP Morgan Chase) sued Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure Ltd., a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, in a dispute over a financing. Chase filed the suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Federal jurisdiction was based on alienage under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1332(a)(3), in that the suit was between a United States company and a \\"citizen or subject of a foreign state.\\" The District Court ruled for Chase, and Traffic Stream appealed. Although no jurisdictional issue had been raised in the District Court, on appeal the Second Circuit inquired sua sponte whether federal subject-matter jurisdiction existed over the action. The Second Circuit concluded that jurisdiction was lacking. The court reasoned that since the British Virgin Islands are a dependent territory rather than a \\"foreign state,\\" a British Virgin Islands corporation was not a \\"citizen or subject of a foreign state.\\" The Second Circuit panel relied on the Circuit's prior Matimak decision, which had reached the same conclusion concerning a citizen of Hong Kong prior to the transfer of Hong Kong from British to Chinese sovereignty. Traffic Stream petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari, with the support of an amicus curiae brief from the government of the United Kingdom. The Court agreed to hear the case.  Opinion of the Court  Justice David H. Souter wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court, reversing the Second Circuit's decision and holding that a British Virgin Islands company like Traffic Stream was properly considered a \\"citizen or subject of a foreign state\\" for jurisdictional purposes. The Court observed that Congress has authorized the federal courts to hear civil actions involving more than $75,000 between \\"citizens of a State and citizens or subjects of a foreign state.\\" A corporation incorporated under the laws of a foreign state is deemed a citizen of that foreign state. The Second Circuit's view was that because the British Virgin Islands are a British dependent territory rather than a sovereign state under British and international law, a British Virgin Islands company was not a citizen or subject of a foreign state for purposes of alienage jurisdiction. The Supreme Court disagreed, finding the distinction drawn by the Second Circuit to be \\"entirely beside the point of the statute providing alienage jurisdiction.\\" After surveying the political status of British territories such as the British Virgin Islands, as well as the constitutional and statutory history of alienage jurisdiction, the Court held that a British Virgin Islands corporation could be considered a citizen or subject of a sovereign state, the United Kingdom. The fact that British Virgin Islands residents are not citizens or subjects of the United Kingdom under British nationality law, the Court held, did not negate that they are citizens or subjects of a foreign state for purposes of the alienage jurisdiction statute. The Court also observed that its decision was consistent with the views of the governments of the United Kingdom, the British Virgin Islands, and the United States.

Ewert is best remembered as an official Comintern representative to the United States, China, Argentina, and Brazil during the late 1920s and 1930s. After being subjected to torture and sentenced to 13 years in prison for his political activity in Brazil, Ewert lost his sanity. He was granted amnesty in May 1945 and ultimately returned to East Germany, where he lived out the rest of his life in a series of medical facilities. Biography=Early years= Arthur Ernest Ewert was born November 13, 1890 in the town of Heinrichswalde, East Prussia (today's Slavsk, Russia). He was the son of an ethnic German poor peasant family.David P. Hornstein, Arthur Ewert: A Life for the Comintern. Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1993; pp. 5, 20. Largely self- educated, Ewert completed only a primary school education in a one-room rural schoolhouse.Patrick Major, \\"Arthur Ewert,\\" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: A-L. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pp. 297-298. Anxious to escape the drudgery of rural life, at the age of 14 Ewert accepted a position as an apprentice in an uncle's saddle-making factory in the urban center of Berlin. The growth of the automotive industry convinced the young Ewert that there was little future in saddle-making, however, so he left that trade to take a job as a worker in a Berlin steel works.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 5. Earning low wages to perform difficult and sometimes dangerous work in the steel plant proved to be a radicalizing experience for Ewert. Influenced by his older sister, Minna, who was an activist in the social democratic youth movement, Ewert himself joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP) in 1908 at the age of 18.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pp. 5, 7. In addition to socialist politics, Ewert's sister introduced him to a friend from work, the Polish-born Elise Szaborowski ‚Äî known to her friends as \\"Szabo\\" ‚Äî who was herself a committed Marxist.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 7. The pair began living together and would remain a couple for 25 years. =Life in Canada= Early in 1914 Ewert and Szabowski moved to Canada, where they began to achieve fluency in the English language. At the time of Canada's entry into World War I in the summer of that year Ewert and Szabowski were required as citizens of an enemy power to report to the legal authorities for internment for the duration of the war.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 9. Instead the couple chose to disappear into the political underground, where they were aided by Canadian Marxist opponents of the war. The couple traveled extensively through Canada and the United States in this period, interacting with others of like political mind and joining the new Socialist Party of North America (SPNA), a small revolutionary socialist organization launched in Canada in 1915.The Socialist Party of North America, primarily a Canadian organization, included some members in the Detroit metropolitan area. It was absorbed into the Communist Party of Canada in 1921. See: Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pp. 9-10. During this period the couple used the party pseudonyms \\"Gustav\\" and \\"Elsie\\" and procured false identity documents under the names \\"Arthur Brown\\" and \\"Annie Bancourt\\" to better avoid law enforcement officers.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pp. 10-11. Following the Russian Revolution of November 1917, Canadian authorities increased their scrutiny of domestic radicals and Ewert and Szabowski became persons of interest. An informer tipped off the authorities that the pair would be in Toronto for a party meeting on March 23, 1919 and plainclothes detectives picked up their trail from the gathering to a boarding house, where arrest and search warrants were served.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 11. According to the police communist propaganda and several handguns were found in the couple's room during the search. After an administrative hearing Ewert was deported to Germany a few months after his arrest, while Szabo was transported across Canada to an internment camp, pending her own deportation in February 1920 aboard a prisoner of war repatriation ship.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 12. The couple reunited in Berlin where they resumed their lives together anew. =German revolutionary= Wall posters from the ill-fated \\"March Action\\" of 1921, which resulted in defeat and discredit for the Communist Party of Germany. Returning to Germany early in the summer of 1919, Ewert joined the fledgling Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and became active in its work preparing the ground for a revolutionary overthrow of the German government.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 17. To support himself he went to work in Berlin as a laborer at the giant electrical corporation AEG (Allgemeine Elektricit√§ts-Gesellschaft), becoming one of the leading KPD activists among that company's workers. This period was marked by economic chaos, strikes, and streetfighting, in which the KPD frequently played the role of provocateur.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 19. Ewert was involved in this activity as a leading member of the loosely organized Greater Berlin Revolutionary Action Committee, established to organize urban workers into fighting groups to do battle with similar bands of ultra-nationalist demobilized soldiers.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 22. The leadership of Soviet Russia placed supreme importance on an early communist revolution in Germany to provide material support for the revolution in their own revolution backwards peasant nation. Substantial funds were funneled into Germany to support the organizing and propaganda efforts of the German communist movement.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 24. From 1920 onwards German-speaking veterans of the Soviet revolution and Russian Civil War were employed to establish paramilitary \\"military-political organizations\\" throughout Germany in preparation for armed insurrection.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 26. The leadership of the KPD was divided over the advisability of such preparations for armed struggle, with Hungarian Comintern plenipotentiaries Bela Kun and J√≥zsef Pog√°ny dispatched to Germany early in 1921 in an effort to win support for the strategy from faltering party chiefs.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 28. These preparations for a planned insurrection were ultimately short-circuited by events in Soviet Russia, including the March 1 Kronstadt uprising in which Baltic sailors took up arms against the Soviet regime, prompting more than two weeks of violent and bloody conflict between these revolutionary forces.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 29. In need of a diversion, the Communist International (Comintern) pushed forward with its plans for German insurrection in events which were later to be known as the March Action.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 30. On March 22, 1921 Communist paramilitary units exploded bombs and attacked police stations and government buildings throughout Central Germany in an attempt to spark the overthrow of the Ebert government. The chaos and killing which resulted from this coordinated offensive resulted in a debacle for the Communists, alienating a broad section of the public against the KPD and provoking an immediate reaction by the authorities, which easily put down the uprising. The Communist Party of Germany was decimated in the aftermath of the failed March Action and party leader Paul Levi was expelled for afterwards publishing a pamphlet which sharply criticized the Comintern for its tactics and role.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 31. In April 1921 the KPD leadership dispatched Arthur Ewert to the city of Halle to attempt to rebuild the party organization there following its destruction in the March Action. After only a couple weeks Ewert was arrested for his organizing activity, however, and he was transferred to the prison facility at Frankfurt, where he was held for two months with other communist activists without formal charges being filed.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pp. 31-32. The state was unable to produce evidence that Ewert was involved in fomenting armed insurrection, however, and he was subsequently released.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 32. =Political rise= Ewert was elected to the governing National Committee (Zentrale) and its Politburo by the 8th Congress of the KPD in January 1923.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch, \\"Arthur Ewert,\\" in Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern. Revised and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 110-111. Ewert was also elected as a KPD delegate to the 3rd Enlarged Plenum of Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) in 1923. During this interval Ewert was one of the top party leaders in Western Germany involved in the planning of the Communist Party's failed November 1923 revolutionary uprising. This activity made Ewert a wanted man with the legal authorities of the Weimar Republic and he was forced into hiding. Ewert was arrested in November 1926 but managed to escape and he returned to life in the underground until 1928. Ewert was voted off the Zentrale for factional reasons by the dominant party left wing at 9th Congress of the KPD, held in April 1924. Ewert and his co-thinkers Heinz Neumann and Gerhart Eisler were removed from the political scene for work in the Communist International in Moscow.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 61. Ewert was initially assigned to work in the Comintern's Balkan Commission, dealing with political affairs of the various Communist Parties of that region. Ewert was also put to work as a lecturer at the Comintern's International Lenin School, an institution established in 1925 for the intellectual and technical training of leading party cadres for life as \\"professional revolutionaries.\\" The fortunes of his \\"center\\" political faction soon improved in Germany, however, and Ewert was returned to his formerly held leading positions by the 10th Congress of the KPD in 1925 and re-elected by the 11th Congress in 1927. In 1926, Ewert was again selected as a delegate of the KPD to the 6th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI, at which he made use of his English-language skills as chair of the British Commission under the pseudonym \\"Braun.\\" Ewert was again elected to the 8th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI, held in Moscow in May 1927, where he chaired the American Commission, which attempted to resolve the ongoing factional war inside the Workers (Communist) Party of America. This was followed that same summer by his dispatch to the United States as the Comintern's Representative to the 5th Convention of the Workers (Communist) Party, during which time he used the pseudonym \\"Grey.\\" By 1928 Ewert was regarded as one of the top leaders of the KPD, reckoned by historian Patrick Major to have been the number two figure in the Communist Party of Germany after party leader Ernst Th√§lmann. He entered the German parliament, the Reichstag, in May 1928. Later in 1928 Ewert was tapped as the KPD's representative to the Executive Committee of the Communist International following Th√§lmann's apparent involvement in a corruption scandal. =Condemnation as \\"Conciliator\\"= Ewert returned from his Moscow posting to ECCI early in 1929 to resume work in the apparatus of the German Communist Party. He quickly found himself on the wrong side of a growing factional divide of the increasingly radical Third Period policies of the world communist movement as a leading member of the moderate \\"Conciliator\\" (Vers√∂hnler) faction. At the 10th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI, held in Moscow in 1929, Ewert came under fire from his factional opponents as a supporter of discredited Soviet leader Nikolai Bukharin, with KPD representative to ECCI Walter Ulbricht leading the attack of what he characterized as a \\"Bukharin‚ÄìHumbert-Droz‚ÄìEwert Group.\\"E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, Volume 12: Foundations of a Planned Economy, 1926-1929: Volume 3, Part 1. London: Macmillan, 1976; pg. 249. This charge was echoed by Joseph Stalin's right-hand man, Vyacheslav Molotov, who singled out Ewert by name among those \\"conciliators\\" who lent de facto political support to the more moderate political line of Bukharin and his co-thinkers inside the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks).Carr, Foundations of a Planned Economy, vol. 3, part 1, pg. 250. Ewert managed to salvage his political career by engaging in public self-criticism at the 12th Congress of the KPD, held in June 1929, followed by publication of an article entitled \\"The Bankruptcy of the Conciliators\\" in the official party newspaper. Despite this public reversal of previously held political positions, Ewert was removed from the top leadership of the German Communist Party and was thereafter no longer directly involved in German party affairs. =Comintern functionary= Ewert's familiarity with the English language and with the affairs of the America Communist Party made him a useful agent to the US, to which he traveled a false passport on Comintern business in 1930.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 127. Of primary concern to the Comintern was obtaining an independent assessment of the solidity of the hold over the party apparatus by the faction headed by Earl Browder and William Z. Foster, which had recently assumed control from deposed party leader Jay Lovestone. The use of Ewert ‚Äî a personal friend and former ideological ally of the expelled dissident Lovestone ‚Äî for this task was doubtlessly a form of loyalty-testing and assessment of whether Ewert retained political usefulness to the Comintern. Ewert seems to have passed the test, avoiding contacts with the Lovestone political organization and gaining the confidence and respect of the new American party leadership.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 128. In the fall of 1930 Ewert was formally assigned to the Comintern's Latin American department and he traveled with his common-law wife Szabo to Montevideo, Argentina to take over affairs of the Comintern office there.Stanley E. Hilton, Brazil and the Soviet Challenge, 1917-1947. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 1991; pp. 22-23. The posting was not a desirable one, but was rather a form of banishment of the ideologically suspect Ewert from the decision-making centers of the Communist Party of Germany and the Comintern.Hilton, Brazil and the Soviet Challenge, pg. 23. Ewert worked closely with Comintern representative A. Guralsky to win popular expelled Brazilian political leader Lu√≠s Carlos Prestes to the Communist cause, regarded as a top priority task. The pair were successful in formally bringing Prestes over to the Communist Party of Brazil (PCB) by May 1931, with Prestes capping his conversion with a trip to Moscow that fall. It is unclear whether Ewert accompanied Prestes to the Soviet Union, but he did turn up again in Moscow in the spring of 1931, his Argentine mission at an end.Hornstein, Arthur Ewert, pg. 130. In 1932 Ewert and his wife were dispatched as Comintern Representatives to the Communist Party of China, where they would stay until recalled to Moscow in 1934. From Moscow Ewert and Szabo were first sent to the United States, with Ewert using the pseudonym \\"Harry Berger\\" during his brief stay. From there the pair proceeded to Brazil as Comintern Representative to the Communist Party of Brazil. Following an abortive insurrection against the regime of Get√∫lio Vargas in November 1935, Ewert was arrested in Rio de Janeiro and was subjected to severe torture by authorities seeking the whereabouts of opposition leader Prestes. His wife Szabo was also subjected to police torture, being stripped, forced to suffer electric shocks, beaten, and burned with cigarettes ‚Äî all in the presence of Ewert.Stanley E. Hilton, Brazil and the Soviet Challenge, 1917-1947. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 1991; pg. 81. Despite the viciousness of the interrogation, neither Ewert nor Szabo betrayed their confidences under duress. Szabo was ultimately deported to Nazi Germany in September 1936, where she was incarcerated and would later die at the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp in 1939. Ewert underwent protracted interrogation, during which time he lost his sanity. He was finally brought to trial in May 1937, where he was convicted and sentenced to 13 years and four months in prison. =Later years= In May 1945 Ewert was granted an amnesty from prison. He returned by ship to the Soviet zone of control in Eastern Germany in August 1947 but the mental problems which followed his torture and imprisonment proved insurmountable and he was forced to be hospitalized in a sanatorium for the rest of his life. =Death and legacy= Ewert died on July 3, 1959 in Ebertswalde. In 1981 the government of the German Democratic Republic issued a postage stamp in Ewert's honor. FootnotesFurther reading * Robert J. Alexander, Communism in Latin America.

Sixth Avenue in Tucson, Arizona. It was designed by Bishop Henry Granjon of Tucson and built between 1916 and 1918. The Santa Cruz Catholic Church, or Santa Cruz for short, is significant for its construction using unstabilized mud-adobe bricks made in the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation. It is also the largest known mud-adobe building in Arizona, and the state's only surviving example of a major public building built of adobe. Santa Cruz was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. History The Santa Cruz Catholic Church was built Manuel G. Flores in the Spanish Colonial Revival style with Islamic nuances, including a minaret-like bell tower. The overall plan is that of a long rectangular basilica adjoined by the Convento surrounding a courtyard. All of the building's masonry is covered with white paint and plaster. The roof is a frame of wooden trusses and decking with a low pitch. The rood is surrounded by a parapet with decorated perforations and piers with baroque finials. A small dome was added to the top of the altar when it was expanded in the 1940s. A continuous choir loft on the eastern side of the building above the entryway creates a sequence of compression at the entry, which opens up into a tall space above the nave. A rectangular skylight on the western side of the building lights up the altar. Santa Cruz's bells rang for the first time at the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, when Granjon, after hearing about the surrender of Germany, ran to the church, climbed the steps of the tower, and rang the bells to announce Armistice Day to the city. The church, whose name means \\"Holy Cross\\" in English, was dedicated just a few months later in February 1919. In November 1924, some Mexican copper miners that were striking for better wages and better hours set some dynamite off inside the church, although nobody was hurt. The strikers, many of whom were veterans of the recently concluded Mexican Revolution and Carmelite exiles, caused a significant amount of damage to some of the building's trusses, which can still be seen today. Furthermore, the blast was so powerful that it blew the front door of the church off and cracked the building's plaster walls. Although the trusses have been repaired, to this day only a limited number of people can use the choir loft at one time.

Location Located near Ringk√∏bing on the west coast of Jutland, the church stands as a landmark over the surrounding fields and heath, giving perspective and character to the landscape. History Completed in the first half of the twelfth century, it is one of the oldest churches in the country. In 1771, the church's west gable was damaged by a storm. A heavy buttress now supports one wall. The porch was built in the 1500s in late Gothic style on the south side of the church, where the men's entrance once was. The women's entrance was on the north side of the church. The frescoes are dated to the sixteenth century. Restoration work was carried out in the 1960s. Architecture and fittings Emulating the design of earlier wooden churches and standing on a sloping foundation, Hover Church is built of hewn granite in the Romanesque style. The nave is rectangular, the chancel is almost square, and the four simply-glazed windows are small and high. Unlike most other Danish churches, Hover does not have a bell tower, but instead has a small bell that hangs under an overhang on the east gable.\\"Hover kirke\\", Nordens kirker.

In his short two-year career, he became the first Frenchman to reach the level of the English members of the Alpine Club, in the silver age of alpinism in the second half of the 19th century, which was dominated by the development of mountaineering in the Alps. With some of the Alpine Club's mountain guides and mountaineers, he led significant first ascents in the Mont Blanc massif and in the Dauphin√© Alps (the Massif des √âcrins).  Biography  A grandson of geologist Louis Cordier and a great-nephew of politician and scientist Louis Ramond de Carbonni√®res, Henri Cordier pursued studies at the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques, founded in 1872, where he received high honors. He was first attracted by the Pyrenees, to which he traveled in 1874, before visiting the Swiss Alps the following year. His brief Alpine career combined talent and audacity. In the 1876 season he succeeded in making eleven first ascents. He claimed to have climbed the western peak of the Meije that year, but was subsequently forced to retract the claim.  Major ascents  * 1874 - Mont Perdu, Vignemale and pic du Midi d'Ossau * 1876 - Attempt at la Meije (then one of the last virgin peaks), on the north face by les Corridors, with guides Jakob Anderegg, Andreas Maurer and J.

This steep snow and ice climb was not repeated until 1924 This book incorrectly gives the year of the Aiguille Verte climb as 1875. * 1876 - Voie Cordier on the north face of Les Courtes with Thomas Middlemore, John Oakley Maund and guides Jakob Anderegg, Andreas Maurer and Johann Jaun, 4 August * 1876 - Les Droites (east summit, highest point at ), with Thomas Middlemore, John Oakley Maund and guides Johann Jaun and Andreas Maurer, 7 August * 1876 - Attempt at the north ar√™te of Piz Bernina, which Cordier declared \\"absolument impossible\\" (it was climbed two years later), with Thomas Middlemore and guides Johann Jaun and Kaspar Maurer, 12 August * 1877 - New attempt at la Meije by the glacier of Tabuchet with Jakob Anderegg and Andreas Maurer, 1 June * 1877 - Le Plaret, with Jakob Anderegg and Andreas Maurer, 7 June  Accident  Descending from Le Plaret, the group left the glacier, successfully passed the crevasse zone, unroped and ate a meal. Afterwards, Cordier went ahead. In front of his horrified companions, he performed a standing glissade down a steep snow slope above the glacial torrent of La Clause below the surface. The snow surface broke suddenly and Cordier was carried away by the white water under the ice and drowned. Jakob Anderegg was lowered into the twelve-foot hole on a rope, but could find no trace of Cordier and nearly suffocated before being pulled up. According to Henri B√©raldi, Cordier had very poor eyesight, but refused glasses due to vanity. As he amused himself by slipping on the snowy slope, he was alerted by his guides and replied, \\"Ne vous inqui√©tez pas, je vais m'arr√™ter sur ce rocher noir\\" (\\"Do not worry, I'll stop on the black rock\\"). Unfortunately for Cordier, the rock in reality was a hole. Seven volumes. Reissue by \\"Les Amis du Livre Pyr√©n√©en\\", Pau, 1977. Cordier's body was recovered the next morning forty feet below the location of his disappearance. The corpse was photographed by Henry Duhamel at La B√©rarde. Henri Cordier was only 21 years old.  Legacy  In memory of Henri Cordier, the Pic de Neige Cordier, located above the Glacier Blanc in the Massif des Ecrins, was named after him. It was climbed for the first time on 3 August 1877 by Paul Guillemin, √âmile Pic, and Pierre Estienne. Cordier also gave his name to posterity in two first-routes, which he had executed in 1876 with Thomas Middlemore, John Oakley Maund and guides Jakob Anderegg, Andreas Maurer and Johann Jaun: the Cordier Couloir on the North Face of the Aiguille Verte and the Cordier route on the north face of Les Courtes (both in the Mont Blanc massif).

II. c. 33), was the first statutory legislation in England and Wales to require a formal ceremony of marriage. It came into force on 25 March 1754. The Act was precipitated by a dispute about the validity of a Scottish marriage, although pressure to address the problem of clandestine marriage had been growing for some time.Probert, Rebecca, Marriage Law & Practice in the Long Eighteenth Century: A Reassessment (CUP, 2009) chapter 5 Background Before the Act, the legal requirements for a valid marriage in England and Wales had been governed by the canon law of the Church of England. This had stipulated that banns should be called or a marriage licence obtained before a marriage could take place and that the marriage should be celebrated in the parish where at least one of the parties was resident.Constitutions and canons ecclesiasticall, 1604 However, these requirements were directory rather than mandatory and the absence of banns or a licence ‚Äì or even the fact that the marriage was not celebrated in a church ‚Äì did not render the marriage void. The only indispensable requirement was that the marriage be celebrated by an Anglican clergyman. The mistaken assumption that a simple exchange of consent would suffice is based on later conflations between the theological position that consent made a marriage and the actual practice of the church courts. Prior to the passage of the 1753 Act such an exchange only created a binding contract to marry rather than a legal marriage.Rebecca Probert, Marriage Law & Practice in the Long Eighteenth Century: A Reassessment chapter 2, (The Misunderstood Contract Per Verba de Praesenti). Effects The Act tightened the existing ecclesiastical rules regarding marriage, providing that for a marriage to be valid it had to be performed in a church and after the publication of bannsSection 1 or the obtaining of a licence.Section 4 Those under the age of 21 had to have parental consent if they married by licence; marriages by banns, by contrast, were valid as long as the parent of the minor did not actually forbid the banns. Jews and Quakers were exempted from its provisions, although the Act did not go so far as to declare such marriages valid and it was many years before their legal standing was assured. Nor did the Act apply to members of the British Royal Family. Indeed, members of the Royal Family have been consistently exempted from all general legislation relating to marriage since this date, which is why doubts were expressed in 2005 about the ability of Prince Charles to marry Camilla Parker-Bowles in a civil ceremony,Probert, Rebecca, The Wedding of the Prince of Wales: Royal Privileges and Human Rights (2005) Child and Family Law Quarterly (Jordans) 17(363) civil marriage being the creation of statute law.By the Marriage Act 1836 It was also provided that the 1753 Act had no application to marriages celebrated overseas or in Scotland.Section 18 The Act was highly successful in its stated aim of putting a stop to clandestine marriages, i.e., valid marriages performed by an Anglican clergyman but not in accordance with the canons. Thus the notorious practice of clandestine Fleet Marriages associated with London's Fleet Prison was ended,Lee Brown, R. \\"The Rise and Fall of the Fleet Marriage\\", ch 6 in R. B. Outhwaite, Marriage and Society (London: Europa Publications, 1981) although there were various short-lived and abortive attempts to claim exemption for the Savoy Chapel in the StrandWilkinson, T., Memoirs of his own Life (York, 1790), Vol 1, p.74 and the parish of Temple in Cornwall. The early death of the Savoy's minister on board ship while waiting to be transported for his flouting of the Act may have discouraged others from making similar claims, even if his demise was due to gout rather than to the conditions of his imprisonment.Wilkinson, T., Memoirs of his own Life (York, 1790), Vol. 1, p.91 However, some couples evaded the Act by travelling to Scotland. Various Scottish \\"Border Villages\\" (Coldstream Bridge, Lamberton, Mordington and Paxton Toll) became known as places to marry. And in the 1770s the construction of a toll road passing through the hitherto obscure village of Graitney led to Gretna Green becoming synonymous with romantic elopements. A similar traffic to the Isle of Man also sprang up, and in 1757 the Legislature of the Island passed An Act to prevent Clandestine Marriages Statutes of the Isle of Man vol.i p.281 in very similar terms to the English Act of 1753. But the Manx Act differed in one significant respect from the latter, in requiring clergy from abroad, who were convicted of conducting marriages in breach of the Act's requirements, to be pilloried and have their ears cropped, before being imprisoned, fined and deported. The Act was repealed in 1849. Modern misinterpretation Modern commentators, after the work of historians such as Lawrence StoneStone, L., Road to Divorce (Oxford University Press, 1990), p.132 and Stephen Parker,Parker, S., Informal Marriage, Cohabitation and the Law, 1750‚Äì1989 (Basingstoke: Macmillan Press, 1990), p.61 have often misconstrued both the requirements of the Act and the canon-law requirements which directly preceded it. It has been widely but wrongly asserted, for example, that the Act rendered invalid any marriage involving minors, i.e. those under 21, unless parental consent had been given.Waller, M., The English Marriage: Tales of Love, Money and Adultery (London: John Murray, 2009), p. 7, p. 146 In fact, this was true only for the minority of marriages celebrated by licence. While the parent of a minor could forbid the banns and so prevent a marriage from going ahead, a marriage by banns that took place without active parental dissent was valid. This gave rise to the practice whereby underage couples would resort to a parish where they were not resident to have the banns called without their parents' knowledge. Since the Act specifically prohibited the courts from inquiring into the parties' place of residence after the marriage had been celebrated, such evasive marriages were still valid.Section 10 The only way in which an aggrieved parent could challenge such a marriage was if there had been a mistake amounting to fraud in the calling of the banns.See e.g., the case of Pouget v Tomkins (1812) 2 Hag Con 142; 161 E.R. 695 It has also been mistakenly asserted that the Act abolished common-law marriage, along with informal folk-practices such as handfasting or broomstick weddings. However, since neither the name nor concept of \\"common-law marriage\\" existed in England and Wales at this time, this can be shown to be untrue, while recent scholarship has argued that ideas such as handfasting and \\"broomstick weddings\\" are the result of Victorian folk-lore and late 20th-century New Age mythology.Probert, Rebecca, Marriage Law & Practice in the Long Eighteenth Century: A Reassessment (Cambridge University Press, 2009) chapter 3 See also *Marriage Act *Marriage Act 1836 ReferencesFurther reading * The text of the Act * External links *Civil Marriage in the Catholic Encyclopedia *Why do people get married after having children?

In his speech, he spoke about the need to design the \\"new Jew\\" and reject the \\"old Jew\\", with the mental and physical strength to achieve the goals of Zionism. Nordau saw Muscular Judaism as an answer to Judennot (\\"Jewish distress\\"). History Gymnastics in Beit HaKerem, Jerusalem, 1925 The term refers to the cultivation of mental and physical properties, such as mental and physical strengths, agility and discipline, which all will be necessary for the national revival of the Jewish people. The characteristics of the muscular Jews are the exact opposite, an antithesis, of the Diaspora Jew, especially in Eastern Europe, as shown in the anti-Semitic literature and in the Haskalah movement's literature. Nordau saw the promotion of muscular, athletic Jews as a counterpoint to such depictions of Jews as a weak people. In addition, the \\"muscular\\" Jew is the opposite of the rabbinic or Haskalah Jew ‚Äî the man of letters, the intellectual ‚Äî who was said to be busy all his life engaging with esoteric subjects. His body, and his will, grew weak. Though Muscular Judaism was an idea practiced mostly by male Jews, Jewish women participated as well, especially in activities such as gymnastics. At the time of Nordau's speech, the idea of Muscular Christianity was already widespread in various Christian countries. Jewish athletes in Europe European Jewish leaders heeded Nordau's philosophy. Between 1896 and 1936, Jewish athletes won many more medals for Austria at the Olympics than their proportion of the total Austrian population. Nordau's idea of Muscular Judaism also inspired the founders of Hakoah Vienna, a Viennese sports club especially well known for its football team. American journalist Franklin Foer has written that Hakoah (Hebrew for \\"the strength\\") was \\"one of the best teams on the planet\\" at its height in the mid-1920s. Hakoah players decorated their uniforms with Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, and adopted nicknames of historical Jewish military leaders, such as Bar Kochba.

Singapore is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-lingual country, and Singaporeans of Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian descent have made up the vast majority of the population since the 19th century. In 1819, the port of Singapore was established by Sir Stamford Raffles, who opened it to free trade and free immigration on the island's south coast. Many immigrants from the region settled in Singapore. By 1827, the population of the island was composed of people from various ethnic groups. Singapore is a multilingual and multicultural society home to people of groups of many different ethnic, religious, and national origins, with the majority of the population made up of Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian descent. The Singaporean identity was fostered as a way for the different ethnic groups to integrate and identify with the nation, while preserving the culture and traditions of each ethnic group, instead of assimilating the minority cultures into a single majority culture. According to a 2017 survey by the Institute of Policy Studies, 49% of Singaporeans identifies with both the Singaporean identity and their ethnic identity equally, while 35% would identify as \\"Singaporeans\\" first and 14.2% would identify with their ethnic identity. As of 2019, the population of Singaporeans stands at 4,026,200 and the population of overseas Singaporeans stands at 340,751, with 217,200 individuals retaining their citizenship.  Overview = Indigenous population = The earliest records of settlement on the island date back to the 2nd century, where the island was identified as a trading port which was part of a chain of similar trading centres that linked Southeast Asia with the Tamil Indians and the Mediterranean. The earliest settlers of the island were known as the Orang Lauts, and the island was an outpost of the Srivijaya Empire until it was invaded by the Tamil Emperor Rajendra Chola I of the Chola Empire in the 11th century. According to the 19th century Chinese record Investigation of Southern Pacific (ÂçóÊ¥ãË†°Ê∏¨) (Nanyang Li Ce), it described the presence of Chinese tombs in Singapore. Words and inscriptions recording the period of Later Liang and Emperor Gong of Song were found on these tombs and this may suggest that from 907 to 1274, some Chinese had settled, lived, died and were buried in Singapore. A small Malay kingdom, known as the Kingdom of Singapura, was founded in 1299 by a fleeing Srivijayan prince, Sang Nila Utama, who was crowned as the Raja of the new state. After the fall of the kingdom in 1398, the island fell under the suzerainty of various regional empires and Malayan sultanates until its destruction by Portuguese raiders in 1613. Prior to the arrival of Raffles, there were hundreds of indigenous Malays living on the island under the Johor Sultanate. Most of the indigenous Malays came from the Malay Archipelago. There were an estimated 150 people living on the island, who were predominantly Orang Laut with small population of 120 Malays who were the followers of Temenggong Abdul Rahman, and about 20‚Äì30 Chinese. =Modern Singapore= The majority of Singaporeans today are descendants of immigrants who settled on the island when Singapore was founded as a British trading port by Raffles in 1819, except for the Malays who are indigenous to the region of Malaya. At that time, Raffles decided Singapore would be a free port and as news of the free port spread across the archipelago, Bugis, Javanese, Peranakan Chinese, South Asian and Hadhrami Arab traders flocked to the island, due to the Dutch trading restrictions. After six months of Singapore's founding as a free port, the population increased to 5,000, with the first census of 1824 showing that 6,505 out of the 10,683 total were Malays and Bugis settlers. Within the first few months of becoming a British settlement, a large number of Chinese migrants also started to settle on the island. In 1825, the population of the island had passed the ten thousand mark and by the census of 1826, there were more Chinese with a population of 6,088, as compared to 4,790 Malays excluding the Bugis and Javanese. By 1871, due to the influx of migrants from Malaya, China, India and other parts of Asia, Singapore's population had reached nearly 100,000, with over half of them being Chinese. Many of these early migrants were predominantly male and they would usually return to their home countries after they had earned enough money. By the early to mid twentieth century, an increasingly significant number of migrant workers chose to stay permanently, with their descendants forming the bulk of Singapore's population today. In 1957, Singapore attained self-governance and Singaporean citizenship was granted to selected residents who were born in Singapore or the Federation of Malaya, British citizens who had been resident for two years, and others who had been resident for ten years., ch. 10 (\\"Road to Independence\\"). On September 16, 1963, all Singaporeans effectively became Malaysian citizens as Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak were merged to form Malaysia. However, about two years after the merger, Singapore seceded from Malaysia on August 9, 1965 and Malaysian citizenship was withdrawn from Singaporean citizens. Singaporean nationality law was incorporated into the new Constitution of Singapore. The constitution repealed the 1957 Ordinance, and all persons who were citizens as of 16 September 1963 by virtue of the Ordinance continued to be Singaporean citizens. Today, Singaporean citizenship is granted by birth, by descent, or by registration. Although provided for in the Constitution, citizenship by naturalisation is no longer granted. The government instead uses the constitutional provision for citizenship by registration to grant citizenship to resident aliens.  Racial and ethnic groups  Men of various races- Chinese, Malay, and Indian gather at a street corner in Singapore, circa 1900. Singaporeans with Chinese ancestry make up 74.3%, Malays make up 13.4%, Indians make up 9%, and residents of other descent make up 3.2% of the 3,965,800 of the resident population (including persons holding Permanent Residency). To avoid physical racial segregation and formation of ethnic enclaves common in other multi-racial societies, the Singapore government implemented the \\"Ethnic Integration Policy\\" (EIP) in 1989 where each block of units are sold to families from ethnicities roughly comparable to the national average.HDB InfoWEB: Ethnic Integration Policy & SPR Quota : Selling Your Flat . Retrieved 1 March 2015 Today, the Chinese- Malay-Indian-Others (CMIO) model is the dominant organising framework of race in Singapore. The country also celebrates Racial Harmony Day to commemorate the 1964 race riots in Singapore and to remember the consequences of racial disharmony the country experienced during the 1964 racial riots, which were a series of riots that resulted in a total of 36 deaths and 560 others suffered severe injuries. Singaporeans of other ethnicities notably the Arab, Armenians, Chitty, Eurasians, Malaysians and Sri Lankans are classified into broader ethnic groups under the CMIO model. The Javanese are classified under the Malay ethnic group and the Peranakans are classified under the Chinese ethnic group are two examples of the classification of race and ethnicity in Singapore. Other foreign communities in the country or Singaporeans of other ethnic origins includes the Australians, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, Nepalis, Pakistanis, and Italians.  Culture  Shophouses in Singapore Singaporean culture is a mix of Asian and European cultures, with influences from the Malay, Indian, Chinese, and Eurasian cultures. This is reflected in the architectural styles of buildings in several distinct ethnic neighbourhoods, such as Little India, Chinatown and Kampong Glam and Singlish, which is a local creole language which consists of words originating from English, Malay, Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese and Tamil, used by Singaporeans in a less formal setting. Due to Singapore's diverse ethnic makeup, the Singapore Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, descent and place of birth. The state thus promotes cultural policies based on multiculturalism and multiracialism, instead of cultural assimilation. About 70% of Singaporeans also identify with other ethnic cultures in Singapore, notably the Chinese, Malay and Indian cultures. Major festivals including Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali, Vesak Day, Christmas, Good Friday and New Year's Day which are celebrated by the different major racial and religious groups are designated as public holidays. = Religion = Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum Saint George's Church Singapore is the world's most religiously diverse nation, with Singaporeans following various religious beliefs and practices due to the country's diverse ethnic and cultural mix. The Inter-Religious Organisation, Singapore (IRO) recognises 10 major religions being practiced in the city state. Dharmic religions have the highest number of adherents in Singapore, with 33% of the population practising Buddhism and 5% of the population practising Hinduism. Many Singaporeans are also adherents of Abrahamic religions, with 18.7% of the population identifying as Christian, and 14% identifying as Muslim. Other prominent faiths practised by Singaporeans include Taoism (10%), Chinese folk religion, and other Dharmic religions like Sikhism and Jainism. A small percentage of Singapore's population practices Zoroastrianism and Judaism. 18.5% not identifying with any religion and 0.9% of Singaporeans identify as atheist. In addition, practice of hybrid religions is also common such as the incorporation of Taoism and Hindu traditions into Buddhism and vice versa. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" - style=\\"text-align: center;\\" +Religions Practiced in Singapore, Statistics From 2010 & 2015 !

With the influx of traders into Singapore, Bazaar Malay (Melayu Pasar), a creole of Malay and Chinese, emerged as the lingua franca of the island, which was the language of trade in the Malay Archipelago. However, under the British colonial government, English gained prestige as the language of administration, law and business in Singapore, and eventually displaced Bazar Malay as the bridging language among the population. As government administration increased, infrastructure and commerce developed, and access to education further catalysed the spread of English among Singaporeans. Today, Singapore has four official languages, English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. Malay is the ceremonial national language of the country and is the home language to 13% of the population.Tan, P.K.W. (2014). Singapore's balancing act, from the perspective of the linguistic landscape. Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia, 29(2), 438-436. Although the younger generation of non-Malay people are non-proficient in the Malay language, Malay is used in the national anthem of Singapore and also in citations for Singapore orders and decorations and military foot drill commands. Almost all Singaporeans are bilingual since Singapore's bilingual language education policySee Language education in Singapore, with Singapore English as the de facto lingua franca spoken by Singaporeans today. It is officially the main language of instruction in all school subjects except for Mother Tongue lessons and is also the common language of administration, law and business. In 2009, more than 20 languages were identified as being spoken in Singapore, reflecting a rich linguistic diversity in the city.

The operation failed: Allex was executed during the raid and two French commandos and at least eight civilians were killed in a firefight.  Background  Denis Allex and Marc Aubri√®re were deployed to Mogadishu, Somalia in 2009 by the French Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) to train soldiers from the Transitional Federal Government. On 14 July 2009, both men were kidnapped from the hotel at which they were staying by armed men impersonating police. The captors loaded the men into a truck and left the hotel, but later the truck broke down. While the truck was incapacitated, the captors were confronted by members of Hizbul Islam, a Somali Islamist militia, who demanded custody of the hostages. The two men were then taken away by fighters from Hizbul Islam and later Allex was transferred to the allied militia, al-Shabaab. On 25 August 2009, according to his version of events, Aubri√®re, who was being held in Mogadishu, escaped from his captors in the middle of the night while they slept. He then walked for five hours to the government compound in the city and, from there, was transported back to France. However, Aubri√®re's account was disputed by many Somalis as being improbable and it was suggested by them that his release was secured after the French government paid a ransom; they say said they did not. US and French technical and human intelligence teams, including a US Army Special Mission Unit specialized in signals intelligence, and U-28A surveillance flights out of Djibouti were immediately deployed in an exhaustive effort to locate the hostage. Somali assets recruited by the DGSE identified several locations where the agent had been located; the agent was constantly moved by the terrorists mainly because of the fighting between al-Shabaab and African Union troops. US and French satellites and unmanned reconnaissance flights monitored the hostage's location for several months as operators from DGSE Division Action unit planned the rescue mission. In December 2012, when news reached the DGSE that the hostage's health was deteriorating, President Francois Hollande ordered the DGSE Division Action to prepare to carry out a previously opposed hostage rescue mission. The DGSE sent a 50-man Close Quarter Battle Group of the Division Action (known as CPIS) to Camp Lemonnier where they trained for the mission with a small team of United States Navy SEALs from Red squadron, DEVGRU. In addition to the latest intelligence from Somali agents, the US also provided surveillance assets, including JSOC Predator UAV based at Camp Lemonnier and air cover from both AC-130 Spectres and an RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV during the mission itself.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.293-294  Operation  At around 2:00a.m. local time on 11 January 2013, 50 French Special Forces from the DGSE's highly secretive direct action unit called \\"Division Action\\" supported by EC-725 Caracal helicopters dispatched from the Mistral,Le Mistral au coeur de la tentative de lib√©ration de Denis Allex en Somalie, Mer et Marine EXCLUSIF. Somalie : le raid pour lib√©rer Denis Allex a √©t√© conduit depuis le Mistral, Le Point assaulted an al-Shabaab position in Bulo Marer, Somalia, where Denis Allex was believed to be held. A fierce firefight lasting 45 minutes ensued and in the process 17 al-Shabaab fighters and a French captain were killed. The French Special Forces later abandoned the operation. The French military believes that members of al-Shabaab executed Allex during the operation. However, al-Shabaab claimed that Allex was still alive and in its custody. Additionally, the French military had reported that one soldier was missing; they were almost certain he was killed during the attack. Al- Shabaab claimed that it had captured the missing soldier, left lying wounded on the ground during the firefight, despite also releasing photographs of the dead soldier. In addition to the military casualties, eight civilians were also reportedly killed during the operation, including a pregnant woman, with others being wounded. According to the French journalist Vincent Nouzille, more than 70 Somali militiamen were killed and several dozen civilians were victims of a 'clean-up' carried out by French commandos to preserve the surprise effect of the operation. Aftermath On 13 January 2013, the Somali Federal Government held a press conference, where it condemned the Bulo Marer operation as unilateral and carried out without the knowledge or consent of the Somali authorities. The officials also extended their condolences to all casualties. The following day, US President Barack Obama indicated in a War Powers Resolution letter to Congress that US Air Force warplanes had entered Somali airspace in limited support of the French rescue operation. However, he stated that they did not use weapons during the raid. On 14 January 2013, al- Shabaab posted on their Twitter account a picture of the body of a white man in military uniform, describing him as the \\"leader\\" of the failed French commando raid in Somalia. The body was surrounded by captured military gear. This was confirmed to be the soldier missing in action. He was later identified as Captain Patrice Rebout, a member of the Division Action arm (11e Choc) of the DGSE. Three days later, Al-Shabaab announced, also through Twitter, that Allex had been executed in response to the French operation.

In a racing career which lasted from August 1973 until May 1974 he ran five times and won four races. In 1973 he was unbeaten in three starts including the Racing Post Trophy and was officially rated the best two- year-old in Britain and Ireland. In the following year he won on his debut but finished third to Nonoalco in the 2000 Guineas and never raced again. He was then retired to stud where he had some success as a sire of winners before his death at the age of twenty-five. Background Apalachee was a tall, long- striding bay horse with a white star and one white foot, bred by Claiborne Farm in Kentucky. He was the product of a mating between two American Horses of the Year: Round Table and Moccasin. Round Table was one of the most successful grass specialists in American racing history, winning forty-three races and being named Horse of the Year in 1958. He became a highly successful breeding stallion, being the Leading sire in North America in 1972. Moccasin was named Horse of the Year as a two-year-old filly in 1965, when she was unbeaten in eight races. She came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 5-h which produced Ridan, Thatch, Nureyev, Fairy King and Sadler's Wells. Apalachee entered into the ownership of John Mulcahy and was sent to race in Europe. He was trained by Vincent O'Brien at his Ballydoyle stable in County Tipperary, Ireland. Racing career=1973: two-year-old season= Apalachee made his first appearance in the Lee Stakes at the Curragh in August. Racing against moderate opposition he won by six lengths without being placed under any pressure. A month later at the same course he won the Moy Maiden Stakes in similar fashion. In October Apalachee was moved up markedly in class when he was sent to England to contest the Group One Observer Gold Cup over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. With prize money of ¬£43,000, the race was the most valuable two-year-old race ever run in Britain. The opposition was headed by Nelson Bunker Hunt's Mississipian [sic], an American- bred, French-trained colt who had won the Grand Crit√©rium at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden by Lester Piggott, Apalachee moved to the front two furlongs from the finish with Mississipian emerging as his only challenger. In the closing stages he pulled clear to win easily by two lengths from the French colt, with a gap of ten lengths back to Alpine Nephew in third. The unplaced horses included the future Group One winners Snow Knight, Busiris (Prix Royal Oak) and Mount Hagen (Prix du Moulin). In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best two-year-olds, Apalachee was given top weight of 133 pounds, five pounds clear of Mississipian. He was made a strong favourite for the following year's 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby. =1974: three-year-old season= Apalachee began his three-year-old season by winning the Group Three Gladness Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in April. He was then sent to England for the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse on 4 May. With Piggott in the saddle, he started at odds of 4/9 against eleven opponents, making him the shortest-priced favourite since Colombo in 1934. His support in the betting market was despite rumours that he had developed respiratory problems and his unimpressive appearance before the start. In the race he briefly led two furlongs from the finish but finished third behind Nonoalco and Giacometti. Apalachee was withdrawn from the Derby after performing poorly in a training gallop at Ballydoyle. He never raced again and was retired to stud with a valuation of $2 million. Owner John Mulcahy greets Apalachee & Lester Piggott after their victory in the Gladness Stakes at the Curragh in 1974 Assessment As noted above, Apalachee was officially rated the best two-year-old in Britain in 1973 by a margin of five pounds. The independent Timeform organisation were even more impressed with the colt, giving him a rating of 137 which made him not only the season's best two-year-old, but the joint-best horse of any age to race in Europe in 1973 (equal with Rheingold). The Timeform annual Racehorses of 1973 commented \\"we have not seen a two-year-old as promising as this for many years\\". Vincent O'Brien called him \\"a horse apart\\". In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Apalachee the twenty-first best British or Irish two-year-old of the 20th Century. Stud career Apalachee returned to the United States where he had a long and reasonably successful stud career at Gainesway Farm in Kentucky. He was particularly noted as a sire of sprinters. His winners included Dance for Donna (Canadian Champion Older Female Horse), Apalachee Honey (Sorority Stakes), Up the Apalachee (Alabama Stakes), Pine Tree Lane (Carter Handicap) and K One King (Oaklawn Handicap). He was the damsire of the American Champion Sprint Horse Artax. He continued to cover mares until being pensioned from stud duties in 1996 and died later that year.

The classic ingredients used for its preparation are semolina, sugar, ghee (usually), water, and milk. The sweet most commonly known as Jonnadula Halwa in certain parts of northern India. The precise composition of kesari bath varies regionally depending on the availability of ingredients. The dish might be prepared with pineapple, banana, mango, coconut, or rice. Claims to the origin of the dish are made by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and other regions of South India. The dish is common in the cuisine of Karnataka as well as of multiple regions in South India and is a popular dish during festivals such as Ugadi. The word kesari in multiple Indian languages refers to the spice saffron which creates the dish's saffron-orange-yellow-colored tinge. Though it is a sweet dish, in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, it is prepared not only as a dessert but also for normal breakfasts. It is also served with uppittu or khara bath, and a serving of both dishes on one plate is popularly called \\"chow chow bath\\". In North India, it is served as a sweet dish called sheera or suji halwa. It is much simpler with little or no ghee, no color or saffron in contrast to the actual traditional recipe of Karnataka. It is commonly known as sheera in Marathi/Hindi, rava kesari in Telugu and Tamil, and suji halwa in North India and Bangladesh.  History  The dish is listed as shali-anna in Manasollasa, a 12th century work by the Chalukya king Someshvara III.

The theorem states that the torque of a resultant of two concurrent forces about any point is equal to the algebraic sum of the torques of its components about the same point. In other words, \\"If many concurrent forces are acting on a body, then the algebraic sum of torques of all the forces about a point in the plane of the forces is equal to the torque of their resultant about the same point.\\"  Proof  Consider a set of N force vectors \\\\mathbf{f}_1, \\\\mathbf{f}_2, ..., \\\\mathbf{f}_N that concur at a point \\\\mathbf{O} in space. Their resultant is: 400x400px :\\\\mathbf{F}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mathbf{f}_i . The torque of each vector with respect to some other point \\\\mathbf{O}_1 is : \\\\mathbf{\\\\Tau}_{O_1}^{\\\\mathbf{f}_i} = (\\\\mathbf{O}-\\\\mathbf{O}_1) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{f}_i . Adding up the torques and pulling out the common factor (\\\\mathbf{O}-\\\\mathbf{O_{1}}), one sees that the result may be expressed solely in terms of \\\\mathbf{F} , and is in fact the torque of \\\\mathbf{F} with respect to the point \\\\mathbf{O}_1: : \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mathbf{\\\\Tau}_{O_1}^{\\\\mathbf{f}_i} = (\\\\mathbf{O}-\\\\mathbf{O}_1) \\\\times \\\\left ( \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mathbf{f}_{i} \\\\right ) = (\\\\mathbf{O}-\\\\mathbf{O}_1) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\Tau}_{O_1}^{\\\\mathbf{F}} .

A statue of Mother Angelica's version of the Divine Child is prominently displayed in the plaza square. The Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament of Our Lady of the Angels Monastery, informally known as OLAM Shrine, is a prominent Roman Catholic Latin Rite shrine located in Hanceville, Alabama, United States within the Diocese of Birmingham. Adjacent is the cloistered Monastery of the Poor Clare Nuns of Perpetual Adoration, situated on a site and a religious center affiliated with the Eternal Word Television Network. The Shrine is notable for its gilt interior, solemn atmosphere, and monstrance. The Shrine is named in honor of the Most Blessed Sacrament, while the building surroundings are dedicated to the Divino Ni√±o, a title of the Child Jesus found prominently displayed all over the area. Its foundress, Mother Mary Angelica of the Annunciation, resided at the cloistered monastery with her nuns until her death in 2016. History The entrance gates to the shrine. In 1995, while travelling to Colombia to seek assistance for EWTN‚Äôs Spanish programs, Mother Angelica attended Mass at the Sanctuary of the Divine Child Jesus in Bogot√° and was inspired to build a shrine honoring the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Five anonymous benefactors contributed to the purchase of a former soybean farm located in Hanceville, Alabama, and to construction costs and materials. The monastery was consecrated in December 1999. Description The altar. The exterior is characteristic Romanesque, but incorporates pointed arches and other Gothic elements. Mother Angelica sought to model the Shrine on 13th century Italian architecture, with its piazza or plaza square, colonnade, esplanade and various cosmatesque designs. She also wanted the building to reflect materials from all over world. The ceramic tile came from South America. The bronze doors depicting the Seven Joys and Seven Sorrows of Mary were designed and crafted in Spain. The floors, columns, and pillars are made of marble. The rare red Jasper marble is from Turkey. The wood for the pews, doors, and confessionals is cedar imported from Paraguay. Spanish workers came to build the doors. The stained glass windows were imported from Munich, Germany. The stations of the Cross inside are hand- carved. A statue of El Divino Ni√±o is featured prominently one on the side altars of the Shrine, as well as a large statue of the Child Jesus, holding a heart at His palm, stands at the plaza square. On the liturgical feast day of Divine Child Jesus, balloons are customarily tied to his wrist for this feast. The Shrine consists of a Cloistered Monastery, Upper and Lower church, near life sized Nativity scene, Lourdes Grotto, Castle which houses the gift shop and conference rooms, and John Paul II Eucharistic Center (open for tours Mon- Sat 10AM and 2PM). During construction, a storm struck the area, causing the church cross to be damaged. Initially, Mother Angelica wanted to repair it.EWTN: Video Tour 2008 Later on, Mother Angelica associated the cross with the Tau cross. The damaged remains of the top part of the cross are on display in the St. Joseph Courtyard. Another notable statue in the Shrine depicts a scourged Jesus Christ, symbolic of his pain and suffering at the cross. Decorum code and photography rules Rose Window The Nuns of Our Lady of the Angels Monastery keep 24-hour Adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament. A dress code is enforced in the shrine, banning overly revealing clothing, including mini-skirts, shorts, tank tops, or sleeveless shirts. No photography is permitted in the main or lower parts of the church. Speaking in the main part of the church is also prohibited.  Pilgrimages  People from all over the world make pilgrimages to the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament. Pilgrimages consist of individuals or groups. Groups of ten or more can contact the Pilgrimages Department to set up activities during their stay such as Spiritual Talks, Healing Services, or tours. The Shrine is open 6:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M.

Early life  He graduated from The University and King's College of Aberdeen, Scotland in 1649. He was licensed as a minister on 5 April 1654 in the Presbytery of Deer in the Synod of Aberdeen. He was admitted to Crimond by the Protesting Presbytery on 10 April 1655. His headquarters may have been in the neighbourhood of Innes House. Career On the establishment of Prelacy, Stewart was removed from his post for nonconformity. In 1657, the Synod of Aberdeen declared him \\"an unparalleled intruder\\" and ordered him to cease his ministry. They deposed him in October 1658. The Protesters refused to remove him because they judged him to be \\"a godly and able man.\\" Nevertheless, the Synod removed him on 20 April 1660. Twenty-five years later, on 30 January 1685, he was libeled before a Committee of Council, which at that time had been sent to meet at Elgin in Murray Shire to prosecute locals guilty of church disorders. He was charged with keeping \\"conventicles, withdrawing from the ordinances, preaching seditious doctrine, plotting against the government, supplying and harboring rebels, and other public crimes and irregularities\\". When examined on 2 February 1685, he stated under oath that he had not kept his own parish church for eighteen or nineteen years and that he had preached in his own family, and in private houses. He denied all the other articles of the libel. He testified to having conducted a marriage: he \\"deponed that he married Alexander Campbell, in Calder's-land, with Lilias Dunbar, who had been the Lady Innes's servant before the indemnity.\\" For this confession and that he refused to take the oath of allegiance, on 4 February 1685 he was sentenced to banishment from his Majesty's dominions and transported as a prisoner to the Tolbooth of Edinburgh. Instead of banishment, upon his arrival in the south, he was imprisoned in the Bass, where he stayed until liberated by the Council on 21 June 1686. After the Restoration, he became minister in Elgin in 1687 and in Urquhart after 10 May 1691.  Personal life  He married Christian Arbuthnot, sister of John Arbuthnot of Cairngall in Longside, and had daughters, including Margaret (who married Alexander Forbes, minister of Dyke) and Elizabeth. He died on 6 May 1692.

Sandoz, 566 F.3d 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2009), was a US patent law case argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that established a bright-line ruling regarding claims of patent infringement relating to disagreements over so-called \\"product-by-process\\" claims. The case was decided on May 18, 2009. Background Abbott Labs had a patent on a specific drug called Omnicef used to combat ear infections. Lupin Limited had a court rule that a generic form of Omnicef it produced did not infringe on Abbott's patent since their process to make the drug was different. After the court had ruled in Lupin's favor, Abbott appealed and the case was combined with several other legal suits against smaller pharmaceutical companies, and thus was renamed Abbott v. Sandoz. The federal court affirmed the lower court's decision. Case For several years, the courts have disagreed on the product-by-process definition. Product-by-process refers to the question of determining if a product is legally different from another if it is created by a different process. Federal courts have offered contradictory resolutions on the subject. The court determined that a patent may limit itself if it specifically defines the process of creation. Decision Despite the legal discrepancies, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) held that using a different process in this case did not infringe on Abbott's patent and ruled in Sandoz's favor, along with ruling in favor of the other small pharmaceuticals companies. Since Abbott had not patented all processes to create its drug, it could not protect from the processes being used by others. Importance This case further enforces the product-by-process definition, and holds that a patent does not protect from infringement through a different process unless necessarily described. Patent-holders seeking to cover their products entirely must find ways to protect every process to create the same item if they want complete protection from infringement.

Biography Blagoj Strachkovski was born in Veles, 29 February 1920 in a poor Macedonian family. After he finished his primary education he started looking for a job. He spent his childhood working on the fields, working it the quarry, etc. He became a member of the syndicate and he took part in many demonstrations and strikes. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia saw his activities, while he was working in the syndicate so, he became a member of Communist Young Party of Yugoslavia (SKOJ) and at the end of the year he became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ). When the war started and Bulgarian occupiers went to Veles, Blagoj was chosen as a member for the local committee of KPJ in Veles and secretary of the local committee of SKOJ. During 1941 and 1942 he contacted many people because the most important priority was to form a partisan detachment. The detachment was formed in April 1942. Blagoj was working on popularization of the detachment and accepting new members. All these activities have contributed his stay in Veles to be very dangerous for his life so in September 1942 he became a member of the Partisan Detachment \\"Dimitar Vlahov\\". The detachment has 3 bands and Blagoj was political commissar of the Second band. He was very brave when there was battle and in the villages where they were going he was speaking to the villagers and he organized meetings where he was calling the local people to expel the occupiers fighting against them. In December 1942, the Bulgarian occupiers started to work on decomposition of the detachment. One of that was the separation of the detachment near Zelenikovo. Blagoj with one group of partisans had to go to Black Mountain of Skopje (Skopska Crna Gora) but because of the snow which there was plenty of it, they had to come back in the town. They were hiding in the town for a while because they were unable to contact the people from the party. After that they went to Rosoman where they have been seen and they were caught and taken to Veles military barracks. There they were tortured very badly. They were asking him everything but Blagoj didn't answer anything. On 13 January 1943, Blagoj only said that the partisans would win the war. When the Bulgarian occupiers heard this they were very angry so the cut him alive on pieces and buried him alive. On 11 October 1953, he was awarded the title National Hero of Yugoslavia and Macedonia by the president of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito in honor of his bravery, work and desire to live in free and independent Macedonia.

History In 1969 Commonwealth Railways ordered six single-cab NJ class locomotives from Clyde Engineering for use on the narrow gauge Central Australian Railway between Marree and Alice Springs. They hauled freight trains as well as The Ghan passenger train. Built at Clyde Engineering's Granville factory they featured many components from the company's new Kelso factory. Their cab was similar to that of the New South Wales 422 class that had recently been built. In July 1975, all were included in the transfer of Commonwealth Railways to Australian National. Following the closure of the Central Australian Railway in December 1980 and their unsuitability for conversion to standard gauge they were transferred by Australian National to the Eyre Peninsula Railway in South Australia. After a few teething problems associated with operating at higher speeds, the class settled down and were employed hauling grain and gypsum services. All six were sold with Australian National's South Australian operations to Australian Southern Railroad in August 1997 and renumbered as the 1600 class. Some were transferred to Australian Railroad Group to operate services in Western Australia.Narrow Gauge NJ Chris' Commonwealth Railways PagesNJ Class Railpage With the splitting up of Australian Railroad Group, two passed to Aurizon in February 2006 and four to Genesee & Wyoming Australia in June 2006.1600 Class Railpage In January 2015, the two Aurizon units were exported to Durban, South Africa.West Australian Rails Jim Bisdee In early 2019, 1604 (formerly NJ 4) was sent for scrap after being lifted onto a low-loader and hauled to Adelaide by road.

A solar-powered bus service is referred to as a solar bus service. The use of the term \\"solar bus\\" normally implies that solar energy is used not only for powering electric equipment on the bus, but also for the propulsion of the vehicle. Existing solar buses are battery electric buses or (in the case of hybrid solar buses) hybrid buses equipped with batteries which are recharged from solar (or other) power sources; a launch of a solar bus service often goes hand in hand with investments for large-scale installations of stationary solar panels with photovoltaic cells. Similarly as other solar vehicles, many solar buses have photovoltaic cells contained in solar panels on the vehicle's roof which convert the sun's energy directly into electric energy to be used by the engine. The introduction of solar buses and other green vehicles for purposes of public transport forms a part of sustainable transport schemes.  About = Solar-only and solar-electric bus services = The distinction between a solar-only electric bus and an electro-solar bus is fluid, as the distinction depends on the actual usage: whether the bus is recharged from solar or other power sources. Solar-only bus services involve recharging the bus from solar energy, usually from solar panel-covered bus station canopies. The concept is similar to that of solar parking plot for cars and bicycles, where vehicles can re-charge while parked. The need for recharging poses constraints on the run and standstill times of the bus. The implementation of a solar bus service benefits from an optimization of over-all requirements for the specific bus service. Electro-solar buses are powered additionally from electric power transmitted from power plants; hybrid solar buses may be equipped with hybrid engines. = Commercially available shuttle buses = Open air low-speed electric shuttle sightseeing buses equipped with a solar panel-covered roof are produced in series and are commercially available. According to the producers, the solar panels save energy and prolong the battery life cycle.  Use = Australia = The Tindo solar battery-charged bus (\\"Tindo\\", Kaurna word for sun) is an experimental battery electric vehicle that operates in Adelaide, Australia. It is the world's first solar bus, operating since 2007. It uses 100% solar power, is equipped with a regenerative braking system and air conditioning and can carry up to 40 persons, 25 of whom are seated. The bus itself is not equipped with solar panels. It receives electric power from a photovoltaic system on Adelaide's central bus station. Hailed as the world's first bus service powered exclusively by solar power, the bus service connects Adelaide City and North Adelaide as part of Adelaide City's sustainable transport agenda. The Tindo is part of the 98A and 98C bus service (until recently known as the Adelaide Connector) which is offered as free public transport. = China = Within the Chinese government's program for clean transport sector, China's first solar hybrid buses were put in operation in July 2012 in the city of Qiqihar. Its engine is powered by lithium-ion batteries which are fed by solar panels installed on the bus roof. It is claimed that each bus consumes 0.6 to 0.7 kilowatt-hours of electricity per kilometer and can transport up to 100 persons, and that the use of solar panels prolongs the batteries' lifetime by 35 percent. = Europe = Austria's first solar-powered bus was put in operation in the village of Perchtoldsdorf. Its powertrain, operating strategy, and design specification were specifically optimized in view of its planned regular service routes. It has been in trial operation since autumn 2011. The tribrid bus is a hybrid electric bus developed by the University of Glamorgan, Wales, for use as student transport between the University‚Äôs different campuses. It is powered by hydrogen fuel or solar cells, batteries and ultracapacitors. = UK = The Big Lemon Solar Bus in 2017 The first Solar Bus in the UK launched in Brighton April 2017. Following a marathon six week effort from hundreds of local people, The Big Lemon and Brighton Energy Coop's joint Solar Bus project has won funding from the M&S; Community Energy Fund to cover the roof of The Big Lemon‚Äôs bus depot in solar panels to power the new electric buses on clean green renewable energy. The bus was named by one of the Solar Roof partners, Viper IT Solutions and is called \\"Om Shanti\\". The 120 solar panels will generate 30,000kWh per year of electricity ‚Äì the equivalent of 1.8 million boiled kettles. With no emissions, the Solar Buses will reduce noxious gases in some of Brighton and Hove‚Äôs most polluted areas and will power the 52 route between Woodingdean and Brighton on 100% renewable energy. The Solar Bus project was one of 199 different applications to the scheme, 125 of which were shortlisted. These were put to public vote for six weeks during September and October and the voting process also included the option to donate to the project via the Crowdfunding platform. The Solar Bus project was one of 19 regional winners, with 1549 votes, 170 pledges, and a total of ¬£13,325 raised through crowdfunding, almost half the total amount of ¬£28,798 raised through the scheme nationally. The project will benefit from ¬£12,500 funding from M&S; Energy which, together with the ¬£13,325 crowdfunding donations will fund the solar array on the roof of the bus depot. =Uganda= The Kayoola Solar Bus is a 35-seater electric solar bus with zero tailpipe emissions, a range of 80 km, with latent range extension from the real-time charging enabled by the roof mounted solar panels. The development of the Kayoola Solar Bus Concept represents the commitment of the Kiira Motors Project to championing the progressive development of local capacity for Vehicle Technology Innovation, a key ingredient for institutionalizing a sustainable Vehicle Manufacturing Industry in Uganda. =United States= The Solar Buzz in 2015 The Solar Buzz is a 14-seater US Electricar bus, made in 1994, that has been repurposed as the world's first truly solar bus in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico in 2011. The Buzz has 2 KW in homemade solar panels on the roof, 40 golf cart batteries, 2 electric motors, and has no tailpipe. The power required to go one mile is the same as the power required to make a pot of coffee: around 700 Wh. The Solar Buzz is an IntraCity bus approved by the state Public Regulation Commission (#56817) in 2015 and is a commercial daytime private shuttle service with a US$3 Fare, operated by Hot Springs Transit, LLC. Hot Springs Transit provides transit service to the 6100 person population of Truth or Consequences.  Other forms of green bus transport = Non-solar powered engines = Solar panels are also used for powering electronic devices of the bus such as heating and air conditioning, even in buses with non-solar-powered engine. In the US, such buses are advertised to meet anti-idling regulations in several states. Refitting existing vehicles with photovoltaic panels that feed the original battery with additional electric power has been shown to have the potential for making a substantial contribution to CO2 emission mitigation and to the reduction of pollution. The thus transformed buses are however not solar buses in the strict sense of the word, as they do not use solar energy for propulsion. The use of buses in public transport implies frequent stops with the opening and closing of doors, which influence the way the energy of the battery is used. = Renewable energy powered = In principle also trolleybuses or other non-autonomous electric buses or alternately powered buses such as fuel cell buses or dual-mode buses could be used for solar bus services, provided the origin of all or most of the energy used for propulsing the bus would be solar energy. In practice however such systems also draw on other sources of energy, at least also other renewable energy sources such as wind energy. An example is that the city of Hamburg, Germany, received the 2011 European Green Capital Award for, among others, its fuel cell bus service that is claimed to be the world's largest hydrogen- powered bus fleet and is intended to use hydrogen generated from solar and wind energy., ,  See also  *Solar-charged vehicle *Hybrid electric bus *Plug-in hybrid *List of buses  References  Bus Category:Battery electric vehicles Category:Electric buses Category:Green buses Category:Buses by type Category:Photovoltaics Category:Automotive technologies Category:Sustainable technologies ","title":"Solar bus"},{"id":"38209216","text":"An Oppidan Scholar is a boy at Eton College who has distinguished himself academically.

It is a two-storey building of rendered sandstone rubble with stone slate roofs to an originally H-shaped plan with added wings. History Blythe Hall was probably built in the late 16th century or early 17th century and altered in early 19th century. The hall was once the property of Evan Blackledge, who died in 1612, after which it passed through several generations of the Blackledge family. It was sold to the Hill family of Burscough in 1698 and then to Thomas Langton in 1800, who never moved in but instead leased it to Edward Clifton. In 1826 it was sold to Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Baron Skelmersdale. Google Books whose eldest son and his wife Jessy lived there. Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom was born in the house in 1837 and his sister, Rose Bootle- Wilbraham, was born there in 1842. Lady Alice's Drive, opposite Blythe Hall, is named after Lady Alice Villiers, wife of the first Earl. Lady Skelmersdale died there in 1892, leaving it in the possession of Rose, who never married and died in 1918. It was radically altered and enlarged c.1918‚Äì21, at a cost of ¬£60,000, by Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 3rd Earl of Lathom (1895‚Äì1930), who was reluctant to restore and re-occupy the family seat at Lathom House after the First World War. Many of the materials used at Blythe Hall were salvaged from Lathom Hall. The third earl was a spendthrift with a passion for the London theatre and in the 1920s Blythe entertained theatrical celebrities such as Ivor Novello and No√´l Coward. After the Earl's early death from tuberculosis the earldom was extinguished and the property sold in 1930 to a cotton merchant named Taylor. In 1933 it became a Catholic Seminary for training Passionist priests and called St Gabriel's Retreat. In 1973 it was bought by ex-footballer David Whelan for ¬£80,000 and in 1980 by hoteliers John and Diana Craig. It was reduced in size in c.1975 by demolition of the oldest parts. In 2010 it is undergoing a further makeover by new owners Andy and Tracey Bell from Rufford.

Zell Miller was a court case in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in 1997 between the ACLU, along with other parties, and then Georgia governor, Zell Miller. Background The Georgia General Assembly passed legislation that eliminated rights to privacy when using the internet in the State of Georgia. Governor Zell Miller signed the legislation into law in April 1996. Several internet based groups that guaranteed privacy to their users sought to have the law overturned on constitutional grounds, and enlisted the support of civil liberties groups such as the ACLU. The language of this act in question was as follows: > It shall be unlawful for any person, any organization, or any representative > of any organization knowingly to transmit any data through a computer > network or over the transmission facilities or through the network > facilities of a local telephone network for the purpose of setting up, > maintaining, operating, or exchanging data with an electronic mailbox, home > page, or any other electronic information storage bank or point of access to > electronic information if such data uses any individual name, trade name, > registered trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or copyrighted symbol to > falsely identify the person, organization, or representative transmitting > such data or which would falsely state or imply that such person, > organization, or representative has permission or is legally authorized to > use such trade name, registered trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or > copyrighted symbol for such purpose when such permission or authorization > has not been obtained; provided, however, that no telecommunications company > or Internet access provider shall violate this Code section solely as a > result of carrying or transmitting such data for its customers. Case The plaintiffs reminded the court that no one owns the internet, since it is a decentralized medium of communication between several parties and persons around the world. To impose this regulation would therefore be overstepping the scope of Georgia law, since the state did not have authority over the entity of the internet. In addition, the forceful public disclosure of internet users was said to violate basic civil liberties to privacy and would be revealing sensitive information of users who did not wish to make their identities public. The plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality to this act in its entirety. The defendant sought dismissal but was denied this motion. Decision After the plaintiff could prove likelihood of success of merits, substantial threat of irreparable injury, balance of hardships, and the promotion of the public interest, the court awarded the plaintiff with a preliminary injunction. Thus the defendant was enjoined from enforcing the newly passed act and was forced to revoke it. This act was found to be unconstitutional and in violation of the Bill of Rights. Importance This case established the right to privacy of internet users and guaranteed the protection of basic rights while on the internet. It was established that the government does not have oversight or authority over the internet and thus cannot necessarily make mandates for it. See also * ACLU v.

SS Mormachawk was a United States cargo vessel and troop ship during the Second World War operated by Moore-McCormack Lines as agents of the War Shipping Administration (WSA) from completion 14 December 1942 until placed in reserve after the war September 1946. The ship remained in the Columbia River reserve fleet at Astoria, Oregon until sold for scrapping in 1964. Construction Mormachawk was built in 1942 by Consolidated Steel Corp., in the Wilmington yard completed 14 December 1942 grossing 6,711 tons. The ship, a standard ship type C1-B and completed as a troop transport, was the first launched from Consolidated's new Wilmington yard sponsored by Eleanor H. Van Valey, secretary to Admiral Emory Land, Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission and Administrator of the War Shipping Administration. This ship was Moore- McCormack Lines' second of the name as the earlier type C2 ship of the same name had been acquired by the United States Navy as in 1940. Operation Mormachawk operated under the War Shipping Administration (WSA) by agents. She was acquired by WSA upon completion on 14 December 1942. During World War II the ship operated in the Pacific as a cargo and troop transport operating from the South Pacific to Alaska. On February 27, 1943 Mormachawk carried the United States 44th Naval Construction Battalion or the \\"44th Seabees\\" on their first mission to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides. They arrived on March 18, crossing the equator on March 7.

The 8th Naval Construction Battalion, after completing work in the Aleutian Islands begun in July 1942, returned from Dutch Harbor aboard Mormachawk, leaving Dutch Harbor 8 Aug 1943 and arriving in Seattle, Washington on the 13th. Postwar disposal On 3 September 1946 the Mormachawk was returned to United States Maritime Commission and placed in the Columbia River reserve fleet at Astoria, Oregon. As part of the modifications from cargo to troop transport the ship had cement ballast permanently installed; 350 tons (317,515 kg) in #2 hold and 114 tons (103,419 kg) in #3 hold. On 21 December 1951 the ship had been recommended for scrap due to the $530,000 cost of reconversion to cargo use. Under an award of 7 January 1964 to Zidell Explorations, Inc. the ship was delivered for scrapping 12 March 1964 from the reserve fleet at Astoria, Oregon.

The President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, made a point of receiving her family to pay his condolences in person. The rapporteur for Turkey of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, Josette Durrieu, also paid tribute in glowing terms. Fran√ßois Hollande's statement that he knew one of the three women assassinated in Paris (which provoked a strong reaction from Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan), raised speculation that Doƒüan was also in regular contact with the French president.

The catacombs date between the 2nd and 5th- centuries CE, and take their name from the owners of the land when they were first formally discovered and from the fact that the land was used as a vineyard (vigna). While Vigna Randanini are just one of the two Jewish catacombs in Rome open to the public, they can only be visited by appointment. They are situated below a restaurant and a private villa and entrance is from the Via Appia Pignatelli side. These catacombs were discovered by accident in 1859, although there is evidence that they had been pillaged before then. They cover an area of 18,000 square metres and the tunnels are around 700 metres long, of which around 400 can be seen. The synagogue The entrance reused a pagan building, to which was added a vaulted ceiling and a floor mosaic with black and white tiles. This is thought to have been intended to be used as a synagogue, a hypothesis supported by a well that received drain water from the external mosaic, the existence of two separate units (for men and women), the presence of apses and the mosaic, and the distance of the building from urban areas. The catacombs Menorah motif, Vigna Randanini The catacombs, which are on two levels between 5 and 16.3 metres below the surface, were used between the 2nd and 4th centuries, with the maximum number of interments at the end of that period. Several thousand Jews were buried there. The Hypogeum consists of two main galleries, divided into several branches. There are niches carved into stone walls, and cubicles with arcosolia. The tunnels also have ‚Äúshaped‚Äù tombs excavated in the volcanic floor. There are several cubicula, or chapels, which would have been used by families. Many tombs follow the kokhim style, extending perpendicular to the wall of the gallery. Similar examples are found in Palestine and Israel. Some painted cubicles depict flower motifs and animals but also subjects typical of the Jewish faith such as the seven-branch candelabrum. They have an irregular plan and, although joined together, are divided into separate areas. This suggests new land acquisitions and catacomb developments as more and more space was required. The catacombs are unique for the extent of the decoration. Decorations include a winged Victory in position to crown a naked young man, various figures such as peacocks, birds and baskets of flowers, Pegasus, roosters, chickens, peacocks and other birds. Under a figure of Fortuna, there are a hippocampus and two dolphins. These decorations suggest to some researchers that the tunnels had previous pagan occupants and may have been reused by the Jews. Decorations of these and other Jewish catacombs in Rome provide identification of at least eleven ancient synagogues and important information on symbolism and the Jewish iconography, such as the menorah, the lulav, the shofar, and Torah scrolls. About 25-30% of the inscriptions are in Latin or Aramaic. The rest are in Greek, suggesting that language was the language of most use to a large part of the immigrant population.

It was established as a clade name by German paleontologist Rainer R. Schoch in 2013, although the name had first been established in 1919 by British paleontologist D. M. S. Watson to encompass an evolutionary grade of temnospondyls leading to the group Stereospondyli. American paleontologist Alfred Romer used the term in a similar sense, grouping most Permian and Triassic temnospondyls under Rhachitomi. A similar name that appeared earlier in the scientific literature is Rachitomi, which was named by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1882. Rachitomi was commonly used in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century to include early amphibians such as Eryops and Archegosaurus that had rhachitomous vertebrae. Many early tetrapods have vertebrae that are split into two parts below the notochord: a pleurocentrum and an intercentrum. In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentrum is large and semicircular, while the pleurocentrum divided into two smaller paired elements. Schoch defined Rhachitomi as a node-based taxon to include four major and well-supported clades of temnospondyls: Dvinosauria, Eryopidae, Stereospondyli and a clade formed by Zatracheidae and Dissorophoidea. Not all members of Rhachitomi have rhachitomous vertebrae; the largest subgroup, Stereospondyli, lacks pleurocentra.

Unlike previous analyses, a phylogenetic analysis he performed found no support for a monophyletic Euskelia, that is defined to include Dissorophoidea and Eryopidae (and also usually includes Zatracheidae), in relation to Stereospondylomorpha. In this analysis, Eryopidae and Stereospondylomorpha usually formed a monophyletic clade that excludes the clade formed by Zatracheidae and Dissorophoidea.

Various Islamic fundamentalist rebels fought with the government of Mali, the latter of which was supported by French soldiers participating in Operation Serval. This battle was among the first French engagements in their intervention in the Mali War. The fighting began when rebel fighters disguised as passengers on a public bus infiltrated the town. The bus was stopped at a Malian army checkpoint on the outskirts of Konna. As soldiers entered the bus to search it the Islamists opened fire, killing the soldiers. Additional rebels poured into the town. After several hours of fighting the Malian army was routed to its base, abandoning the town to the rebels and reportedly leaving several heavy weapons and armored vehicles behind.:fr:Bataille de Konna Around 25 Malian soldiers were killed. An estimated 1,200 Islamist fighters advanced to within 20 kilometers of Mopti, a Mali military garrison town. The battle ended in a victory for the Malian government and France, with rebel fighters ejected from the town. Background The January 1, 2013, the representatives of Ansar Dine pointed two main requests to the Malian government through Burkinabe President Blaise Compaor√©, who mediated during the negotiations. Ansar Dine demanded that \\"the Islamic character of the State of Mali be proclaimed solemnly in the Constitution\\" and called for the autonomy of the Azawad. The Malian government refused. On 3 January 2013, Iyad Ag Ghali denounced in a statement the \\"bad will\\" of the Malian government during the negotiations and declared the suspension of his offer of cessation of hostilities. On the 4th, Ansar Dine handed over a document to the Burkinab√® mediator and president Blaise Compaor√© in which he called for the autonomy of Azawad and the application of Sharia law in northern Mali. But since 2 January, from the regions of Gao and Timbuktu, the jihadist forces of Ansar Dine, Movement of Oneness and Jihad in Western Africa (MUJAO), Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Boko Haram were gathering in Bambara Maoud√©. On the 7th, about fifty of their vehicles passed Douentza and positioned themselves at Dangol Bor√©, facing the Malian army. For added discretion, jihadist pickups avoided forming in columns, instead opting to move in wooded areas in small groups in scattered formation so as not to be signaled by plumes of smoke. The pickups were camouflaged by being covered with mud and the fighters hid under tent cloths to escape the infrared visions.http://www.jeuneafrique.com/165872/politique/mali-retour-sur- la-bataille-d-cisive-de-konna/http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130104-mali-ansar- dine-iyad-ag-ghaly-bamako-negociation- saharamediashttp://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130104-ansar-dine-durcit-sa-position- reclame-autonomie-nord-malihttp://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130107-mali-rassembles- bambara-maoude-groupes-jihadistes-ansar-dine-mujao-aqmi-boko-haram-reluquent- vers-le-sudhttp://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130107-mali-deploiement-troupes- jihadistes-abords-ligne-demarcationhttp://www.iris-france.org/43377-mali-des- combattants-nigerians-de-boko-haram-soutiennent-les-groupes- islamistes/http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130107-mali-islamistes-armes- rapprochent-ligne-front Forces in presence Malian forces expected to fight in the region of Mopti.

Kassim Go√Øta, Gao's regiment, Elys√© Daou, the National Guard and Captain Pascal Berthe, the artillery. The Malian forces consisted mainly of soldiers of the 62nd Motorized Infantry Regiment, as well as elements of the 35th Armored Regiment and the 36th Artillery Regiment. In December 2012, the newspaper Jeune Afrique reported that according to a military source more than 2,000 soldiers were present in Konna.https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl;=en&js;=n&prev;=_t&hl;=en&ie;=UTF-8&eotf;=1&u;=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.malijet.com%2Factualte_dans_les_regions_du_mali%2Frebellion_au_nord_du_mali%2F62973-guerre- contre-le-terrorisme-les-dessous-de-la-bataille-de- konna.htmlhttp://www.jeuneafrique.com/139151/politique/mali-la-dr-le-de- guerre/ The number of Salafist fighters was not known precisely. Shortly before the offensive, the DGSE estimated that the jihadists were 1,500 near the demarcation line, including 300 men from AQIM and 500 to 600 from MUJAO. 30 pick-ups form the vanguard, supported by a reserve of 40 other vehicles in Douentza while 80 other pick-ups were ben detached to take part in the Battle of Diabaly. Malian services estimated the jihadist forces at about 5,000 men. According to a report from the French Senate on 23 April 2013, 1,500 to 3,000 jihadists were mobilized for the offensives in southern Mali.http://www.senat.fr/rap/r12-720/r12-7204.html#fn8 The strength of the Salafist rebels was initially estimated at 1,200 men according to RFI and Al Jazeera. On the night of 9 January to 10 January, a teacher near Dangol-Bor√© said he had counted more than 300 jihadist vehicles. For the reporter Jean- Paul Mari, the assailants initially gathered 70 vehicles around Bambara Maoud√© then engaged 150, including 70 from Ansar Dine in the assault on Konna. For Laurent Touchard, the jihadist forces gathered north of the demarcation line were 1,500 to 2,500 men with 300 vehicles. Their forces were made up of some of the most seasoned and well-equipped combatants, with new recruits usually left behind to hold the cities.http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130112-mali-armee- francaise-entre-guerre-konna- jihadisteshttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/01/2013111135659836345.html Shortly before the attack, various chiefs met briefly at Lere Iyad Ag Ghali, emir of Ansar Dine, as well as Djamel Okacha and Abu Zeid who took command of the detachment which would attack the city of Diabaly. Iyad Ag Ghali was the main initiator of the offensive, the leaders of AQIM and MUJAO agreed to join but without enthusiasm, they had decided to consolidate their positions in the north. However, the Salafist objective iwas not known with certainty, two hypotheses are emitted by the DGSE. According to the first, the goal of the jihadists was to seize Bamako and take control of the country, according to the second the offensive was only aimed at the cities of Mopti and S√©var√© and the international airport of Mopti Ambod√©djo, the only airport in central Mali, whose takeover would greatly handicap the deployment of a possible international intervention.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, Tallandier, 2014. The battle=Konna's capture by islamists= On January 8, 2013, jihadists were near the demarcation line in the Mopti region. Malian soldiers carried out some warning shots and reinforcements were sent. For their part, the fighters of Ansar Dine performed some artillery fired and rockets in the night.http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130109-mali-armee-renforce- positions-pres-ligne-demarcationhttp://www.rfi.fr/emission/20130108-une- accrochages-entre-ansar-dine-armee- maliennehttp://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130108-mali-bruits-bottes-ligne- demarcation-ansar-dine-aqmi-mujao-boko-haram-al-qaida On the 9th, at the end of the afternoon, Lieutenant-Colonel Mamadou Samak√© made a reconnaissance mission with a dozen BRDM-2 armored vehicles. The Malian soldiers do not meet any opposition from the jihadists and therefore turn around. But on the way home, they fall into an ambush. All of the Islamist forces crossed the line and attacked the city of Konna.http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130110-mali- affrontements-entre-militaires-islamistes-apres-une-tentative-attaque The jihadists reached Konna in the night of 9 to 10 January. On the 10th, the clashes begun at 8:30 am and ended at 4 pm. The jihadists attacked from three directions, the first column attacked north, by the road of Korientz√©, a village in the municipality of Korombana. A second column attacked to the east, by the road of Douentza, while a third bypasses by the south to cut the retreat of the garrison. To the west, the Niger River makes the area impassable. According to the Malian government, a bus filled with infiltrated jihadists managed to enter the city. According to Jean-Paul Mari, around 1 pm, two buses entered the city after being controlled by Malian soldiers, but it turns out that the 14 occupants of these buses were AQIM fighters disguised as civilians. Arrived at a checkpoint in the middle of the military they open fire in the sixty soldiers before being in turn exterminated by the Malians. This version is also defended by Jean-Christophe Notin, it is however contested by Laurent Touchard, according to which \\"the aggressor tumbles while the identity of the passengers of the bus - true civilians - is being checked. The bus in question is also targeted by the men of Iyad Ag Ghaly. \\" Street fighting took place in the city, but Malian soldiers were overwhelmed, disorganized and ran out of ammunition, and their radio messages were intercepted by jihadists. Around 11 am, the Malians begin their withdrawal. The fighting lasted until 4 pm and at 5 pm the Islamist forces controlled the entire city. Outside the city, Lieutenant-Colonel Samak√©, almost out of ammunition, also managed to retreat with his armored vehicles. Malian troops were in full retreat towards S√©var√©.http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130110-mali- entre-armee-reguliere-jihadistes-une-bataille-decisive-tient-elle- actuellementhttp://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130110-mali-islamistes-konna-mopti- front-nordhttp://www.liberation.fr/planete/2013/01/20/l-armee-du-mali-par- dela-la-deroute_875444http://observers.france24.com/fr/20130110-temoignages- konna-ville-nord-mali-prise-piege-combats-mopti-bamako =Jihadist coalition advances in Sevare and Mopti and Operation Serval= However, the jihadist offensive in southern Mali provoked France's entry into the war. On January 11, the French army launched Operation Serval. Air forces were immediately engaged and from January 10 and 11, Special Forces soldiers transported by planes were dropped at S√©var√©. On the morning of January 11, Mopti and S√©var√© found themselves directly threatened. Only 70 French Special Forces soldiers held the Mopti Ambod√©djo International Airport, while the Malian army deployed two T-55 tanks and three BM-21 multiple rocket launchers as artillery. If the jihadists seized Mopti, no more defense could oppose their progression to Bamako. Both sides also received reinforcements in the day of 11 January. On the side of the Malians, 300 soldiers \\"red berets\\" of the 33rd Commando- Parachutist Regiment with about twenty armored BRDM-2. The Ansar Dine fighters were reinforced by 500 men from MUJAO and AQIM. COS personnel in S√©var√© also increased to about 100 men, mainly from the 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment ( 1st RPIMa), the 13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment ( 13th DPR), the Air Parachute Commando No. 10 (CPA-10) and the Marine Commandos of the ESNO 43. The jihadists then continueed their progress and headed towards the cities of Mopti and S√©var√©. In the morning, two Malian Mi-24 helicopters, freshly repaired, took off in Bamako and reached S√©var√©. At the request of the French, they then go to Konna to attack a group of a hundred men spotted by an Atlantic-2 celebrating their victory. Around 9 am, the helicopters are in Konna and open fire on the Salafist fighters, they inflict losses but also kill some civilians. After their mission is accomplished, they then return to S√©var√©. In the afternoon, the French in turn engage Gazelle helicopters from the 4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment to counter the jihadist advance between Konna and S√©var√©. Around 2 pm, two aircraft take off in Djibo, Burkina Faso, around 4 pm, they attack a group of pick-up jihadists. However the French fly low, without ground support and jihadists have anti-aircraft batteries on some of their vehicles. During the following firefight, a pickup truck is destroyed and its four occupants are killed by a HOT missile, however both Gazelles are also affected. The co-pilot of the first helicopter is seriously injured by a bullet from an AK-47, the aircraft manages to reach the nearest French military medical antenna, but the wounded French soldier, Lieutenant Damien Boiteux, then succumbs to his injuries. The second helicopter must land in disaster north of S√©var√©, but the crew fires except and is recovered by the special forces on the ground. The French then withdraw to S√©var√© after destroying their apparatus. Two more Gazelle helicopters are engaged soon after and fire with HOT missiles and 20 mm guns, a total of four jihadist vehicles are destroyed. The jihadists give up the fight and fall back on Konna and Douentza. Then in the evening, Mirage 2000D based Ndjamena in turn come into action. Two first aircraft take off around 19:15 local time. At around 10 pm, they dropped two bombs on a Konna building which served as headquarters for Ansar Dine. The building was ravaged and several vehicles at the entrance were destroyed. The planes continued their strikes and then bombard a logistics depot, then around midnight a second wave of Mirage destroys four more buildings. The fishing port, the military and administrative buildings, the sub-prefecture and its surroundings were particularly targeted. According to local reports, the strikes killed at least ten people. Several Islamist fighters fled panicked. A big part of the mercenaries recruited by Ansar Dine disbanded. Some fugitives would have even drowned in the river. On 11 January, French A√©rospatiale Gazelle helicopters armed with 20 mm cannons from the Special forces (4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment?) stopped the Islamist column advancing to Mopti. Four Mirage 2000-D jets operating from a base in Chad also conducted airstrikes. 12 targets were hit by the Mirages during the night between the 11th and the 12th. The French chief of army staff, Admiral Guillaud, announced that the Islamists had withdrawn from Konna and retreated several dozen kilometres to the north. On January 12, the staff of the Malian army claimed the capture of the city of Konna. However, on January 15, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denies the information. On the night of January 12 to 13, the 2000D Mirages based in Ndjamena struck new strikes between Konna and L√©r√©. As early as January 13, Konna began to be abandoned by jihadists according to testimonies of residents. The jihadists were positioned around the city.

According to analysts, the French were forced to act sooner than planned because of the importance of S√©var√© military airport for further operations. On 15 January, the French defense minister confirmed that the Malian military had still not recaptured Konna from rebel forces, despite earlier claims that they did. =Recapturing the Konna from the terrorists= On the evening of January 16, the French-Malian forces launch the offensive on Konna. 400 Malian soldiers commanded by Colonel Dacko leave S√©var√©, supported by forty or so French Special Forces soldiers, including a dozen Marine Commandos of the 1st RPIMa. In the late afternoon, they clash with Salafist groups near Dengaourou village, located in a wooded area, about forty kilometers from Konna. The fight will continue throughout the night. Two Malian soldiers were killed at the beginning of the clash, including one by a sniper. However, the positions of jihadists were identified by the French special forces and reported to the Malian artillery, including multiple BM-21 rocket launch trucks. Salafists were crushed by artillery fire, a total of 14 of their pickups were destroyed. The jihadists retreated after several hours of fighting, but they were pursued by helicopters. Shortly before dawn, the two Mi-24 Malians attacked a group of twelve pickups and destroyed four. On the side of the French, a Tiger and a Gazelle neutralize two other vehicles. The losses of jihadists were unknown, only four bodies were found according to French soldiers, while a Malian captain told AFP the day after the fight that six Islamists were killed, eight of their vehicles captured and several destroyed. In view of the number of pickups destroyed, their actual losses were probably greater, with jihadists having probably taken away most of their dead. On the evening of January 17, French and Malian troops regained possession of Konna, abandoned by Islamist troops. The Malian forces entered the first, around 17 hours, followed by three French vehicles and four Malian vehicles that closed the march. The military is acclaimed by the people who brandish Malian and French flags. On the morning of the 18th, only eight Islamists were still in the city, four flee to Douentza by stealing two motorbikes, and the four others flee after threatening with their weapons young people who wanted to lynch them. The next day the city was entirely controlled by the Franco-Malian forces. On 18 January, the Malian army released a statement claiming to have complete control of Konna again. The claim was confirmed by residents of Konna.http://www.lepoint.fr/monde/mali-nouvel-accrochage-pres-de-konna-entre- soldats-maliens-et- islamistes-17-01-2013-1616074_24.phphttps://fr.reuters.com/article/companyNews/idFRL6N0AMHB420130117http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2013/01/18/l-armee- malienne-affirme-avoir-repris-le-controle-de- konna_1818883_3212.htmlhttp://observers.france24.com/fr/20130118-konna- liberee-armee-malienne-francaise-serval-diabali-fran%C3%A7ois- hollandehttp://maliactu.net/echos-du-nord-et-du-centre/ Aftermath and casualties The French deplore a dead man during the battle; Lieutenant Damien Boiteux, co-pilot of a Gazelle helicopter, fatally wounded on 11 January. On January 12, the Malian army, indicated in an initial assessment that 11 of its soldiers were killed and about sixty were wounded, it also estimated the Islamist losses to a hundred killed. However, this report is challenged by testimonies of residents who claim to have counted more corpses dressed in uniforms. According to the French colonel who commanded the special forces detachment at S√©var√©, Colonel Didier Dacko told him on January 10 that his losses were 20 dead and about 60 wounded. According to a \\"regional security source\\" of the AFP, at least 46 Islamists died in fighting fought from January 10 to 12, while according to a resident of Konna dozens of bodies were left in the city. 6 other Islamists were killed in the night of 16 to 17 according to the statements of Malian officers. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, three child soldiers enlisted by the Islamists died during the clashes. On January 12, a merchant from Konna told Reuters that he counted 148 dead, including several dozen Malian army soldiers. Another witness, named Mohammed, claims to have counted 47 bodies of Malian soldiers in the city. According to residents of Konna, about 50 vehicles were destroyed by air strikes. According to some residents, 36 Malian soldiers were buried in Sama. According to a military source, 58 Malian soldiers were killed in the fighting. On January 14, according to a Malian newspaper, 101 jihadists, 11 Malian soldiers and a French pilot were killed during the battle. For the newspaper Nouvelle Lib√©ration, from January 11 to 14, the jihadists lost 130 men, including Firhoun, the adopted son of Iyad Ag Ghali, as well as 30 vehicles and 4 BRDM-2 destroyed. Among the dead was one of the Ansar Dine commanders, Abdel Krim, known as Kojak. Severely wounded in the fighting at Konna, he succumbed to his injuries in the Gao Hospital. According to other sources, Kojak would be Mohamed Ag Aghaly Ag Wambadja. On the 13th, contacted by Sahara Media, leaders of Ansar Dine confirm that Kojak and four of his fighters were killed on January 10 during the fighting against the Malian military. On January 15, the Ansar Dine movement publishes a video that it claims to have filmed the day before in Konna. An Islamist leader, Abu El Habib Sidi Mohamed, who claims to be a member of Ansar Edine's communication commission, says the movement still holds the city and shows several armored vehicles taken from the Malian army. He states that only five fighters of his movement were killed and that seven civilians died during a French bombardment. On January 19, Ansar Dine claimed to have killed 25 Malian soldiers in Konna in the fighting on January 10 and also captured 11 vehicles, 6 tanks and a large quantity of ammunition, they also estimated that 60 Malian soldiers were killed, several dozen Other wounded, two French helicopters shot down and recognizes only a loss of 8 men in all fighting fought since January 10. However, according to Laurent Touchard, the \\"tanks\\" that Ansar Dine claims as taking were in fact armored BRDM-2 and BTR-60PB 3. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 10 civilians were also killed in the fighting on January 11 and 12, including three children drowning while attempting to cross the Niger River. Amnesty International sayd that at least five civilians, including three children, were killed by aerial bombardment on 11 January. For Jean-Christophe Notin, these five civilians were not killed by French air strikes but were shot by Mi-24 helicopters from the Malian army. In February 2013, Konna Mayor Ibrahima Diakit√© told that 15 civilians were killed and 19 injured during the Battle of Konna, he also estimated that at least 502 Islamists were killed. This last estimate is probably based on the testimony of a resident of Konna, who claimed to have been asked by the jihadists to help wash their bodies on the night of January 10, before the French intervention. He estimates that he counted 502 bodies which were then taken to Douentza. 71 people, wounded during the fighting in Konna, are sent to the hospital of Mopti according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2013/01/13/des-civils-victimes- des-combats-au- mali_1816282_3212.htmlhttp://www.lapresse.ca/international/afrique/201301/12/01-4610731-mali- les-islamistes-stoppes-par-larmee.phphttp://www.maliweb.net/la-situation- politique-et-securitaire-au-nord/bilan-provisoire-des-affrontements-a- konna-101-djihadistes-tues-11-maliens-et-1-francais-morts-au- combat-117853.htmlhttp://www.lepoint.fr/monde/mali-un-haut-responsable-d- ansar-dine-aurait-ete-tue-13-01-2013-1613049_24.phphttp://www.maliweb.net/la- situation-politique-et-securitaire-au-nord/intervention-militaire-dans-les- regions-nord-plus-de-800-islamistes-tues-dans-les-combats-iyad-ag-ghaly- abandonne-ses-hommes-pour-fuir-en- algerie-119030.htmlhttps://www.nouvelobs.com/topnews/20130119.AFP1015/la- france-se-lance-dans-la-reconquete-totale-du- mali.htmlhttp://fr.alakhbar.info/5834-0-Guerre-au-Mali-Ansar-Dine-donne-son- bilan.htmlhttp://www.europe1.fr/international/ce-qu-on-sait-des-exactions-au- mali-1400937http://www.lepoint.fr/monde/mali-86-blesses-recenses-par-le-cicr- a-mopti-et-gao-15-01-2013-1614987_24.php Executions According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), seven Malian soldiers, including five wounded, were summarily executed by Islamists during the capture of the city.

Early life  Lord William was the second oldest child of James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton, and his second wife Elizabeth (n√©e Gerard). When the 4th Duke died in a duel, Lord William's eldest brother James succeeded to the dukedom and became the head of the Jacobite interest in Scotland. In 1726, it was rumoured that Lord William would be given a troop of horse, when King George I recalled the Duke of Hamilton from Rome, where he had been seeing the Old Pretender.  Marriage  Lady William Hamilton Early in 1733, the already married Countess of Hertford became infatuated with Lord William and addressed a love poem to him, but he never responded; instead, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and the Baroness De La Warr conspired to write a poem on his behalf to reject Lady Hertford. In May that year, he eloped with the beautiful but impoverished Frances Hawes, daughter of a stockbroker who lost all his fortune due to the South Sea Sufferer's Act of 1721, without the Duke's knowledge, having been led to believe he was marrying an heiress. The couple hurried to consummate the marriage to make it legally binding, fearing that her father might try to have it annulled, and it turned out to be a love match. Lord William was appointed Vice-Chamberlain to the queen, Caroline of Ansbach, the same year. As the second son, he was himself poor enough for Queen Caroline to refer to him and his wife as \\"handsome beggars\\". The couple had a stillborn child. Lord William returned to Lanarkshire to represent his eldest brother's interests and became member of Parliament on 16 May 1734, succeeding his uncle Archibald, but fell ill in June and died at his house in Pall Mall, London, on 11 July. His widow was soon pressured to remarry, becoming Viscountess Vane. In her scandalous memoirs, she describes her grief over the loss of her first husband, which was ridiculed by Horace Walpole.

House of Students of the Empire) was a common home where Portuguese, Angolan, Cape Verdean and Mozambican students‚Äîand possibly Goan too‚Äîwho stood up for the interests of the Portuguese colonies.  Background  The Casa dos Estudantes do Imp√©rio was paid for by the Portuguese government, as a form of supporting students of the Portuguese colonies who were in Lisbon for their higher studies.Brief information From Citi.pt (7. M√§rz 2009 11:52) Although many Brazilians visited the house, it was primarily a meeting place for African students. The house is offered in addition to a cafeteria, medical care as well as a cultural and sports program. The union came about around 1944/45 and resulted from the merger of the Casa dos Estudantes de Angola (est. 1943), the Casa dos Estudantes de Mo√ßambique (founded 1944) and the Casa dos Estudantes de Cabo Verde (est. 1944). Although the facility has been maintained by the Portuguese government, the Casa dos Estudantes do Imp√©rio turned out to eventually be the cradle of the nationalist movement in the colonies. Since 1948, the monthly magazine 'Mensagem' was issued, in which numerous writers from the colonies published their works. With the beginning of the war of independence in 1964, the publication was discontinued. In addition, students such as Orlando de Albuquerque and V√≠tor Evaristo authored numerous books.

The use of the term \\"hearts and minds\\" to reference a method of bringing a subjugated population on side, was first used by Louis Hubert Gonzalve Lyautey (a French general and colonial administrator) as part of his strategy to counter the Black Flags rebellion along the Indochina-Chinese border in 1895.Douglas Porch, \\"Bugeaud, Gallieni, Lyautey: The Development of French Colonial Warfare\\", in Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age, ed Peter Paret (Princeton University Press, USA, 1986), 394 More famously, it was used during the Malayan Emergency by the British who employed practices to keep the Malayans' trust and reduce a tendency to side with ethnic Chinese communists, in this case, by giving medical and food aid to the Malays and indigenous tribes. Boris Hembry, a member of the Federal War Council, recalled: > \\"Although many believe the Americans to have coined the phrase [winning > hearts and minds] in Vietnam .., I maintain that those words were first used > simply as a throw-away remark by [Officer Administering Malaya] Del Tufoe > (sic) while we were chatting informally prior to a Federal War Council > meeting he chaired in November 1951 ... I repeated the phrase during the > ensuing meeting\\". According to another account: A criticism at the time was that \\"[t]here is much talk of fighting for \\"the hearts and minds\\" of Malayans, but only blind obedience is demanded of them\\".John Eber, Malaya's Freedom is Vital to Britain (1954), p. 14. During the 1960s, the United States engaged in a \\"Hearts and Minds\\" campaign in Vietnam. The program was inspired by President Lyndon Baines Johnson. He used some version of the phrase \\"hearts and minds\\" a total of 28 times. In ten of these instances, Johnson inverted the words and used the phrase \\"minds and hearts.\\" The first time he used the phrase in his presidency was on 16 January 1964, and the last time was 19 August 1968. In his usage he addressed very different audiences, including heads of state, congressmen, and the American people. Also, Johnson referred to the \\"hearts and minds\\" of disparate groups, including the above-mentioned audiences and even humanity as a whole. His use of the phrase is most commonly taken from the speech \\"Remarks at a Dinner Meeting of the Texas Electric Cooperatives, Inc.\\" on 4 May 1965. On that evening he said, \\"So we must be ready to fight in Viet-Nam, but the ultimate victory will depend upon the hearts and the minds of the people who actually live out there. By helping to bring them hope and electricity you are also striking a very important blow for the cause of freedom throughout the world.\\" A similar \\"Hearts and Minds\\" campaign in Iraq was carried out during the 2003 invasion and occupation of that country. American use of the phrase is most likely based on a quote of John Adams, the American Revolutionary War patriot and second president of the United States, who wrote in a letter dated 13 February 1818: \\"The Revolution was effected before the War commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people; a change in their religious sentiments of their duties and obligations‚Ä¶. This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people, was the real American Revolution\\". The phrase, \\"hearts and minds\\" is also found in a biblical quotation, in Philippians 4:7, although that passage does not address the \\"winning\\" of hearts and minds as a tactic. The phrase \\"winning hearts and minds\\" has come to be used, often in a derisory sense, to refer to any endeavor by the United States to influence public opinion in foreign countries.

Career Ernst Nicolaas Herman Jansen, later known as Ernst Jansen Steur is a Dutch former neurologist who worked in several positions, including the Medisch Spectrum Twente (MST). During his career he was noted within his profession for his research into Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. He completed his doctoral research in 1994 at the Maastricht University, researching Parkinson's disease. Jansen Steur was interviewed as an expert on the disease by the Dutch television program E√©nVandaag on 24 July 2002 regarding the condition of Prince Claus of the Netherlands (Jansen Steur indicated on the show that he found the prince's condition \\"worrisome\\"). Jansen Steur sufferent a serious car accident in Germany in 1990, resulting in a complex hip fracture. In 2000 he became addicted to Midazolam, a sedative. In order to obtain this drug he started forging prescriptions using his colleagues' names as prescribing physicians. As it turned out later, in the four years following his becoming addicted, he regularly misdiagnosed patients. In order to support his misdiagnoses, he forged diagnostic questionnaires from patients, swapped patient x-rays and forged laboratory results. He prescribed strong medications unnecessarily for a number of his patients and in a number of cases had patients undergo brain surgery without necessity. Jansen Steur was forced to resign from the MST by the board in 2004. He received a ‚Ç¨250,000 severance package and was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement (together with his former colleagues). As part of this deal, he agreed to strike himself from the Dutch registry of medical professionals, thereby giving up the right to practice in the Netherlands. Patients received financial compensation, but were sworn to secrecy. Investigation and prosecution Despite the deal with Jansen Steur (resulting in his resignation from MST and voluntary removal from the registry), the board of MST decided to begin an investigation in 2009 due to a turnover of board members which included the installation of as the new chairman. The investigation was headed by , the former mayor of Hengelo. The Lemstra committee reported on 1 September 2009, concluding failures on the part of the MST but also of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate (: Inspectie voor de Gezondheidszorg or IGZ), which was headed by Kingma at the time that Jansen was being sent away from the MST. The committee also concluded Jansen had been failing as a doctor since 1992 and that the MST had failed to address the situation for years. Upon the release of this report, the Dutch minister of Health Ab Klink instituted another investigative committee headed by Rein Jan Hoekstra, to investigate the functioning of the Health Care Inspectorate. This committee supported the conclusions of the Lemstra committee regarding the failing of the Inspectorate, concluding that the Inspectorate waited far too long to take measures against Jansen and should have filed criminal charges against him rather than settling for a voluntary relinquishing of his status as a physician. They also criticized the MST and the doctors treating Jansen Steur for his injuries in that they did not cooperate fully with the investigation by the Inspectorate. Both of Jansen's doctors invoked physician‚Äìpatient privilege. However, the Inspectorate concluded in an internal investigation concluded on 17 February 2009 that they had functioned correctly in the matter of Jansen Steur. It was announced in October 2009 that Jansen Steur would have to face charges in court after all, charges having been leveled by a special investigative team of the police for this case (the Lippstadt-team). The team had, by that point, gathered 135 different complaints from patients regarding Jansen Steur. The justice department called the case \\"the biggest medical trial in the Netherlands ever\\". The trial was started on 28 November 2012; it was announced on this first trial day that Jansen Steur was facing 21 criminal charges, including causing grievous bodily and mental harm through misdiagnoses of eight patients, causing one patient to commit suicide, theft, embezzlement and fraud. A total of 40 people filed charges against the doctor. There were charges filed by personal injury expert , who filed charges in name of a few dozen injured patients and in name of the families of three patients who died after having been treated by Jansen Steur. In addition to these charges, charges were filed of scientific fraud, after investigation by the Lemstra committee showed that Jansen Steur had falsified results in order to publish an article in The Lancet. The court in Arnhem sentenced him for deliberately setting misdiagnosis, wrongly prescribing strong medicines and the denial of care. In addition he was considered responsible for a suicide of a female patient due to his diagnosis. The court sentenced in February 2014 3 years of prison. Jansen Steur appealed. Metta de Noo, a physician and acquaintance of Jansen Steur claimed in her book of 2015 that he suffered a frontal lobe disorder due to the 1990 accident and should not be held criminally accountable. Work in Germany after 2004 After being forced out of the MST in 2004, Jansen Steur moved to Germany, where he worked for several private clinics. After Dutch correspondent Rob Vorkink tracked him down to the Schlossberg Klinik in Bad Laasphe and tried to interview him for RTV Oost, Jansen Steur was immediately fired from that institute. The Netherlands was shocked on 4 January 2013 when the NOS evening news led with the story that Jansen Steur had found another job as a neurologist in the Klinik am Gesundbrunnen hospital in Heilbronn. He was discovered there by the same Rob Vorkink, who recognized Jansen Steur's voice in a phone call (despite his denying that he was the same person). NOS reporter Marc Hamer verified his identity by passing around photographs among hospital personnel. He was subsequently fired from the hospital on 5 January 2013. Although the hospital noted at first that Jansen Steur had been allowed to work at the hospital because he left his profession voluntarily in the Netherlands in 2010 (preventing the hospital from checking his credentials with the Dutch registry) and as there were no criminal convictions against him when he applied to the hospital, it soon transpired that the hospital had in fact been aware of Jansens past. On 6 January 2013, a German patient filed charges over treatment she received from Jansen Steur in Heilbronn, which she claimed left her wheelchair-bound. Other Steur is the doctor's mother's maiden name. He added this name to his surname of \\"Jansen\\", which is one of the most common surnames in the Netherlands, and is known to the general public as \\"Ernst Jansen Steur\\".

The founding of Mensa Mensa was founded by Roland Berrill and Lancelot Ware at Lincoln College, Oxford, England on 1 October 1946. They originally called it the \\"High IQ Club\\". Lance Ware had the initial idea for the society, but Berrill founded Mensa in the usual sense: he supplied the start-up cash, wrote some initial idiosyncratic pamphlets and became Mensa's first Secretary. Berrill was an unashamed elitist, who regretted the passing of an aristocratic tradition. He regarded Mensa as \\"an aristocracy of the intellect\\". He noticed with some disappointment that a majority of Mensans appeared to have come from humble homes. At an early Mensa organizational meeting, one of the people present proposed that black people be excluded from Mensa. This was met by shocked silence. Then Berrill proposed that the motion be amended to exclude \\"green people with yellow stripes\\" instead. This amended motion passed, with one vote against. If the minutes of that meeting had not been lost, that statute might still be on the books of Mensa. Berrill died a few years later, having recruited in total around 400 people by self-administered IQ tests. Personal life Berrill was born in Australia in 1897, but left with his family in 1901 and went to London. Although he was called to the bar, he never practised as a barrister but lived on the dividends of his investments. He spent most of the rest of his life in England. He had brief trips to Tangier in 1936, New York City in 1937 and Durban, South Africa in 1959. On 22 November 1948 he spoke at the Socratic Club in Oxford, combining with Father Victor White, on the topic \\"Beyond Myth and Dogma\\" at Lady Margaret Hall. Berrill was thick-set and sturdy, with a full well-tended dark beard and moustache. He had confident, protruding eyes, and firm, pleasant voice that revealed his English upper-class schooling, not his antipodean birth. He believed in palmistry, phrenology, astrology and dianetics. These views were not popular within Mensa, and he was regarded by Mensans as \\"deficient in normal scepticism\\". Berrill was a member of the men's dress reform movement; he desired more colour in men's clothes, and objected to the uniformity common in those days. He never married.

Haddock, 292 F. App'x 791 (11th Cir. 2008), was a case involving excessive force used upon Jesse Buckley by Deputy Sheriff Jonathan Rackard. Deputy Rackard used an electronic control device, or Taser, three times on Buckley because he was resisting arrest. The case was brought against the Sheriff of Washington County, Florida, Hon. Bobby Haddock, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The District Court ruled in favor of Buckley, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, ruling in favor of Deputy Rackard. Background Buckley was stopped by Deputy Rackard on the night of March 4, 2004 for speeding on the highway. After being pulled over, Buckley was issued a traffic citation that he refused to sign, stating that he was homeless and could not afford the ticket. In accordance with Florida state law, Buckley was required to sign the citation. Deputy Rackard then warned Buckley that he would be arrested if he did not comply. Buckley still refused and was handcuffed and removed from his vehicle. Once in handcuffs, Buckley dropped to the ground and refused to stand. Deputy Rackard attempted to lift Buckley from the ground but was unable to move him. Rackard proceeded to warn Buckley that any more resistance would result in him being tased. After having his commands ignored two more times, Deputy Rackard then discharged his Taser into Buckley, two separate times at five second intervals. Rackard, still unable to get Buckley off of the ground, called for backup. Upon returning from calling for backup, Rackard again asked Buckley to get off the ground, and then tased him for a third and final time when his request was ignored. After Rackard's backup arrived, Buckley finally agreed to be taken into custody. Buckley pleaded no contest to refusing to sign the speeding ticket and one count of resisting arrest without violence. He later brought a lawsuit claiming both physical and emotional injury due to excessive force used in his arrest. Policy and Procedures The following can be found in the Washington County Sheriff's Office Policy and Procedures Manual regarding the use of Tasers against subjects who are placed under arrest, stating that Tasers > May be used to control a dangerous or violent subject when deadly physical > force does not appear to be justified and/or necessary; or attempts to > subdue the subject by other conventional tactics have been, or likely will > be, ineffective in the situation at hand; or there is reasonable expectation > that it will be unsafe for officers to approach within contact range of the > subject. District Court Buckley brought his case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida in September 2008. He alleged that deputy Rackard used excessive force against him in his arrest, resulting in sixteen burn marks he suffered from the three Taser attacks. The case was presided over by Judge Richard Smoak. The court ruled in favor of Buckley, denying qualified Immunity for Rackard. The court judged that Buckley, having already been handcuffed, showed no danger of flight or to Rackard, and that the use of the Taser three times was wholly unnecessary. Smoak stated that a precedent for Buckley's case was already made in Lee v. Feraro 2002, where the plaintiff was pulled from her vehicle for a minor traffic violation, handcuffed, and injured when the arresting officer slammed her head onto the trunk of her car. Lee v. Ferraro established factors that needed to be considered in deciding whether the law enforcement official's use of force is constitutional: *The need for the force *The relation between the need and amount of force used *The extent of the injury inflicted Smoak stated that \\"it may be arguable that one application of the Taser was appropriate; however, the multiple applications of force were unnecessary and grossly disproportionate.\\" Appeal Haddock's office appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in September 2008. The appellate panel consisted of the Hon. J.L. Edmonson, Hon. Beverly Martin, and Hon. Joel F. Dubina. The court overturned the District Court's ruling in a 2‚Äì1 vote, saying that Rackard was within his rights to subdue Buckley. The court stated that, despite being handcuffed, Buckley could have still posed a potential risk of flight or attack since his legs were not restrained, and that keeping both him and the officer on the side of a highway posed the danger of both of them being injured by traffic. They also stated that Buckley's passive resistance caused Rackard and the assisting officers to be unavailable for more serious situations, should one have arisen that required their immediate dispatch. Judge Edmonson was the most vehement in his defense of Deputy Rackard, stating that: *It was night-time, on the side of a highway, with considerable passing traffic *Buckley was \\"resisting\\" *The Taser was used only after repeated warnings to Buckley In addition, Judge Edmonson also asserted that because of Buckley's unique response, he had created a situation without precedent, meaning that the officer had no previous cases with which to judge if \\"his actions were improper\\". Chief Judge Dubina agreed that while the force was excessive, Deputy Rackard was still entitled to qualified immunity because of the lack of precedent. Judge Martin dissented, arguing that even though no precedent existed, the officer should have known his actions were wrong, stating: > I also conclude that at the time of the incident, Deputy Rackard was on fair > notice that his conduct was unconstitutional [‚Ä¶]Because our law clearly > establishes such conduct as unconstitutional, I would affirm the district > court's denial of qualified immunity and allow this action to proceed. Judge Martin, in her dissent, agreed with the District Court's initial ruling, stating that Buckley was not only unnecessarily harmed, but also not given adequate time to comply with Rackard's orders after being tased. She also suggested publishing the video taken from Rackard's cruiser's dashboard camera for public consideration. In discussing law enforcement's rights with regard to their use of force on citizens, the court referred to the Fourth Amendment. With this amendment, the court established what is \\"reasonable\\" for law enforcement to be able to do. In Buckley v. Haddock, the court viewed the officers' actions as objectively reasonable. Buckley's unwillingness to obey the law, and the fact that he and the officer were at risk of harm, gave rise to the officer's right to use the resources he had available to him in order to get Buckley to comply. The court also referred to Graham v. Connor, which established that a law enforcement official has the right to use some degree of physical force or threat on the arrested individual when making an arrest. In addition, Lee v. Ferraro was also cited in order to show that the injuries the plaintiff received were minimal, and the use of force was necessary. In its two to one decision, the appellate court found in favor of Deputy Rackard, upholding his qualified immunity. Charges were dropped against Deputy Rackard, and the case was closed. Buckley v. Haddock as Precedent This decision protects officers of the law from claims of excessive force in events where the other party is unaggressively non-compliant. Today, TASER international includes a brief summary of Buckley v. Haddock on their website under a page entitled \\"Brief Summary of Electronic Control Device Cases of Interest for Law Enforcement.\\" While the page is not intended as a sole form of legal advice, it does say that the Eleventh Circuit court upheld Deputy Rackard's right in \\"enforcing the law on its own terms.\\" This case also established the possibility of courts presenting all underlying evidence of a case online for public viewing.name=Law> Public Reaction The District Court's decision drew some criticism from public and legal communities. Some news outlets, including The New York Times, reported on the court's decision, in which Buckley's lawyer criticizes Deputy Rackard's actions as \\"less a question of law, and more one of how we have evolved as a species.\\" Several other legal blogs, including a post by the ACLU, in which Maria Kayanan, its Florida Associate Legal Director, criticizes the institution, stating that: \\"The Eleventh Circuit's ruling licenses police officers to use Tasers as cattle prods to inflict gratuitous pain on a nonviolent handcuffed arrestee, simply to herd him towards a police car. The repeated and excruciatingly painful application of 50,000 volts of electricity was once the exclusive province of the agents and implements of torture, and cannot be condoned in a civilized society.\\" People against the decision also argued that the use of the Taser to subdue Buckley was counter-intuitive, since the primary function of a Taser is to incapacitate muscles and make the target immobile. Since Buckley was already passive and unresponsive, the use of the Taser would not have helped Deputy Rackard in getting Buckley into the vehicle. It would have made the situation harder, as evidenced by Deputy Rackard's other two Taser attacks, because the after the first one, Buckley was unresponsive. The Villanova Law Review wrote that > TASERing Buckley did not serve the government's interest in effective law > enforcement because it did not resolve the problem of getting Buckley into > the police cruiser.

References to an expulsion of Jews from Rome by the Roman Emperor Claudius, who was in office AD 41-54, appear in the Acts of the Apostles (18:2), and in the writings of Roman historians Suetonius (c. AD 69 ‚Äì c. AD 122), Cassius Dio (c. AD 150 ‚Äì c. 235) and fifth-century Christian author Paulus Orosius. Scholars generally agree that these references refer to the same incident.Rainer Riesner \\"Pauline Chronology\\" in Stephen Westerholm The Blackwell Companion to Paul (May 16, 2011) pp.13-14Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum, The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament (2009) p. 110, 400 The exact date is uncertain. The maximal time window for the expulsion of Jews from Rome is from January AD 41 until January AD 53. More detailed estimates such as those based on the AD 49 date by Orosius or the reduction of the AD 53 upper limit due to Proconsul Gallio's health are possible but controversial. There were at least two expulsions of Jews from Rome before this event. In 139 BC the Jews were expelled after being accused of Judaizing among the local Gentiles. Then in AD 19 Tiberius once again expelled Jews from the city for similar reasons. Context There were at least two expulsions of Jews from Rome before the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius. In 139 BC the Jews were expelled after being accused of aggressive missionary efforts. Then in AD 19 Tiberius once again expelled Jews from the city for similar reasons.Van Voorst, Jesus, 2000. pp. 37 Acts of the Apostles The author of the Acts of the Apostles (18:1-18) explains how the Apostle Paul met Priscilla and Aquila and mentions in passing an expulsion of Jews from Rome: =Dating Acts by reference to Gallio or to Orosius= Temple of Apollo, where the Delphi Inscription was discovered in the 20th century, used to date the proconsulship of Gallio which provides a peg for the chronology of Paul.The Letters of Paul: An Introduction by Charles B. Puskas (Aug 3, 1993) page 20 states: \\"The document of primary importance in determining a chronology of Paul is the Gallio Inscription found at Delphi\\" A fairly precise date for Acts 18:1-18 is derived from the mention of the proconsul Gallio in 18:12 and the existence of an inscription found at Delphi and published in 1905, preserving a letter from Claudius concerning Gallio dated during the 26th acclamation of Claudius, sometime between January 51 and August 52.John B. Polhill, Paul and His Letters, B&H; Publishing Group, 1999, , p.78. Ralph Novak states that the Delphi inscription clearly indicates that Gallio did not assume office any earlier than the spring of 50, adds that he may have served one or two years, and uses that to compute date ranges. Working from a date prior to August AD 52 for the Gallio inscription, Novak considers the possibility that Gallio served for two years and calculates a possible range for Gallio's term of office from late spring of AD 50 to early summer of AD 54 depending on whether the inscription reflects a date late in Gallio's consulship or early. Slingerland accepts a wide date range for Paul's trial similar to that of Novak for Gallio's consulship and states that Paul could have arrived in Corinth up to 18 months earlier than the earliest possible start of Gallio's term of office or a short time before the end of Gallio's latest date.Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p.134. Udo Schnelle specifies that the reign of Gallio started in the summer of 51,Apostle Paul: His Life and Theology by Udo Schnelle 2005 page 49. See also The Book of Acts by F. F. Bruce 1998 page 352 and The Greco-Roman World of the New Testament Era by James S. Jeffers (Oct 7, 1999) page 164 and Craig S. Keener pinpoints the start of his term to July 51, although some scholars prefer 52.Craig S. Keener in The Blackwell Companion to Paul edited by Stephen Westerholm 2011 page 51 An independent dating of Acts is sometimes based on a controversial AD 49 date for Claudius's edict, reported by Orosius (see section on Paulus Orosius below): According to Novak, if Claudius's edict were issued in January of 49 and Paul came to Corinth and met Aquila and Priscilla, within six or so months of the edict, then an eighteen-month stay in Corinth would indicate a date after late spring of 50 and many days before January of 51 for Paul's trial. At the other extreme, if Claudius's edict were issued in December of 49, using the same reasoning, the date of Paul's trial would be many days before the January of 52. Michael R. Cosby states that the dates 49-50 for the expulsion of Jews from Rome support the date from the trial of Paul in Corinth, and are consistent with the account of the activities of Priscilla and Aquila given in Acts 18:24-26.Apostle on the Edge: An Inductive Approach to Paul by Michael R. Cosby (Oct 20, 2009) pages 142-143. See also Introduction to the New Testament by Raymond E. Brown (30 Nov 1997) page 433 and Introducing Romans: Critical Issues in Paul's Most Famous Letter by Richard N. Longenecker (Mar 25, 2011) pages 46-47 In summary, the maximal time window for the expulsion of Jews from Rome is January AD 41 (the accession of Claudius) until January AD 53 (18 months prior to the latest possible end of Gallio's term and thus the latest date for Paul's trial). More detailed estimates such as those based on the AD 49 date of Orosius are possible but controversial. =The health of Gallio= Gallio's brother Seneca reports in Moral Epistles 104.1 that Gallio began to develop a fever in Achaia and took ship at once, insisting that the disease was not of the body but of the place. Furthermore, Pliny the Elder states in his Natural History 31.33 that There are besides many other uses, the chief being a sea voyage for those attacked by consumption, as I have said, and for haemoptysis, such as quite recently within our memory was taken by Ann√¶us Gallio after his consulship.Plinius Natural History Book 31 chapter 33, translation by WHS Jones (1963) William Heinemann, London, 1963, p417Alternative translation There are numerous other medicinal resources derived from the sea; the benefit of a sea-voyage, more particularly, in cases of phthisis, as already mentioned, and where patients are suffering from h√¶moptosis [h√¶moptysis], as lately experienced, in our own memory, by Ann√¶us Gallio, at the close of his consulship . Based on these references, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor and a number of other scholars conclude that it is likely that the tenure of Gallio in Corinth lasted less than a full year, and due to health reasons Gallio left Corinth earlier, perhaps even before shipping on the Mediterranean stopped in October 51 due to winter storms.\\"Pauline Chronology\\" by Rainer Riesner The Blackwell Companion to Paul edited by Stephen Westerholm (May 16, 2011) page 14.

Cosby (Oct 20, 2009) page 76 He argues that \\"it is impossible\\" to place Paul's trial by Gallio in the latter part of AD 51-52 and the trial must have happened between July when Gallio arrived in Corinth and September of 51.Paul: A Critical Life by J. Murphy-O'Connor (Sep 3, 1998) pages 21-22 Murphy-O'Connor adds that this has \\"positive confirmation\\" in Galatians 2:1 which \\"places Paul in Jerusalem in AD 51\\". On the other hand, Pliny the Elder refers to only one sea cure by Gallio which was after he was consul presumably around AD 55,Klaus Haacker states, \\"Both Seneca and Plinius mention a sea voyage which Gallio chose as an immediate remedy against symptoms of phthisis when he was in Greece (not during his proconsulship as some modern writers wrongly assume)\\".

Collins and Harrington state that Luke's account may be a conflation of various traditions and not entirely accurate.Raymond F. Collins, Daniel J. Harrington, First Corinthians (Liturgical Press, 1993) p.24. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor indicates that Acts 18 is \\"much less precise than appears at first sight.\\" The expulsion was from Rome, but Aquila and Priscilla came from Italy, so they may have stayed in Italy after the expulsion, how long \\"no-one can say\\". He also questions the exactitude of what is meant by \\"recently\\"/\\"lately\\".Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, St. Paul's Corinth: Text and Archaeology (Liturgical Press, 2002) p.159. Suetonius A brief statement in Divus Claudius 25 mentions agitations by the \\"Jews\\" which led Claudius (Roman Emperor from AD 41 to 54) to expel them from Rome: The expulsion event Suetonius refers to is necessarily later than AD 41,Rainer Riesner, \\"Pauline Chronology\\" in The Blackwell Companion to Paul, Stephen Westerholm (ed.) (Blackwell, 2011) p.13. and earlier than AD 54. The expulsion is mentioned in the last quarter of a list of Claudius's actions during his reign. However, precisely dating the expulsion from Suetonius provides some challenges because Suetonius writes in a topical rather than chronological fashion, necessitating the use of other texts to pinpoint the time.Slingerland, 'Suetonius \\"Claudius\\" 25.4 and the Account in Cassius Dio', JQR 79, 4, p.306 The dating of the \\"edict of Claudius\\" for the expulsion of Jews relies on three separate texts beyond Suetonius' own reference, which in chronological order are: the reference to the trial of Apostle Paul by Gallio in the Acts of the Apostles (18:2),Jerome Murphy-O'Connor St. Paul's Corinth: Texts and Archaeology (Aug 1, 2002) p.152 Cassius Dio's reference in History 60.6.6-7, and Paulus Orosius's fifth century mention in History 7.6.15-16 of a non-extant Josephus reference. Most scholars agree that the expulsion of Jews mentioned in the Book of ActsChristianity and the Roman Empire: background texts by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 pages 18-22 is consistent with this report by Suetonius. Donna Hurley notes that Acts provides a date of 49, but adds that neither Tacitus nor Dio \\"reports an expulsion in 49 or 50 as would be expected if there had been a large exodus of the Jewish community\\", concluding that '\\"all\\" is probably a hyperbole.'Donna W. Hurley (ed.), Suetonius: Diuus Claudius (Cambridge University Press, 2001) p.177. The passage may suggest that in the mid-first century the Romans still viewed Christianity as a Jewish sect. Historians debate whether or not the Roman government distinguished between Christians and Jews prior to Nerva's modification of the Fiscus Judaicus in AD 96. From then on, practising Jews paid the tax, Christians did not.Wylen, Stephen M., The Jews in the Time of Jesus: An Introduction, Paulist Press (1995), , pp.190-192; Dunn, James D.G., Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, 70 to 135, Wm.

(He \\"did not have an anti-Jewish policy.\\")Silvia Cappelletti, The Jewish Community of Rome (Leiden: Brill, 2006) p.82. Donna Hurley explains that Suetonius includes the expulsion \\"among problems with foreign populations, not among religions\\"Donna W. Hurley (ed.), Suetonius: Diuus Claudius (Cambridge University Press, 2001) p.176. Louis Feldman states that most scholars assume that the disturbances were due to the spread of Christianity in Rome.Louis H. Feldman, Jewish Life and Thought among Greeks and Romans (Oct 1, 1996) p. 332 Dunn states that the disturbances Suetonius refers to were probably caused by the objections of Jewish community to preachings by early Christians; Dunn moreover perceives confusion in Suetonius which would weaken the historical value of the reference as a whole.James D. G. Dunn Jesus Remembered (2003) pp. 141-143 Lane states that the cause of the disturbance was likely the preachings of Hellenistic Jews in Rome and their insistence that Jesus was the Messiah, resulting in tensions with the Jews in Rome.William L. Lane in Judaism and Christianity in First-Century Rome edited by Karl Paul Donfried and Peter Richardson (1998) pp. 204-206 In contrast, E.A. Judge states that Suetonius later introduces Christians \\"in a way that leaves no doubt that he is discussing them for the first time\\" (i.e. in Nero 16), bringing into doubt an interpretation that Suetonius is dealing with Christians in Claudius 25. p.446. Scholars are divided on the identity of \\"Chrestus\\" in the Suetonius reference. Some such as Craig A. Evans, John Meier and Craig S. Keener see it as a likely reference to Jesus.Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory. The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition (2007) pages 166Craig S. Keener, The Historical Jesus of the Gospels (2012) p. 66 Menahem Stern said Suetonius was definitely referring to Jesus Christ, because he would have added \\"a certain\\" to Chrestus, if he had meant some unknown agitator.Menahem Stern, Jerusalem, 1980, Greek and Latin Authors on Jews and Judaism vol. 2, p 116 Other scholars disagree: Stephen Benko sees \\"Chrestus\\" as an otherwise unknown agitator in Rome, whereas H. Dixon Slingerland sees him as someone who influenced Claudius to expel Jews.D. Slingerland, \\"Chrestus: Christus?\\" in A. J. Avery-Peck, New Perspectives on Ancient Judaism 4 (Lanham: University Press of America, 1989) p.143. The same view has been espoused by Neil Elliot, (\\"impulsore Chresto probably refers to \\"Chrestus\\" having prompted Claudius' expulsion, not the Jews' disturbances\\": Neil Elliot, \\"The Letter to the Romans\\" in R.

Dixon Slingerland's meticulous work I do not believe any of us can assume the expulsion of some Jews under Claudius was the result of Christian agitation\\".Neil Elliot, \\"The Letter to the Romans\\" in R. S. Sugirtharajah and Fernando F. Segovia (eds.) A Postcolonial Commentary on the New Testament Writings (T.& T.Clark, 2009) p.5. The term Chrestus (from Gk œáœÅŒ∑œÉœÑœåœÇ) was common at the time, particularly for slaves, meaning good or useful.R. T. France. The Evidence for Jesus. (2006) Regent College Publishing . p. 42 Cassius Dio Cassius Dio makes a comment in 60.6.6-7 regarding an action early in the reign of Claudius: The similarities are noteworthy, for both Suetonius and Cassius Dio deal with Jews, tumult, Claudius, the city and expulsion,Slingerland, 'Cassius Dio', JQR 79, 4, p.316 and Cassius Dio does provide a chronological context that points to the year AD 41.Slingerland, 'Cassius Dio', JQR 79, 4, (1988) p.307 However, Cassius Dio does not mention Chrestus or any cause for the emperor's actions. Moreover, Cassius Dio says that Claudius did not drive the Jews out of the city, which prompts Slingerland to conclude that \\"Suetonius Claudius 25.4 does not refer to the event narrated in Dio 60.6.6-7.\\" Rainer Riesner states that ancient historians generally hold that Cassius Dio here may have referred to an earlier, more limited action against some Jews, which was later expanded by Claudius to the expulsion of a larger group of Jews. Raymond E. Brown states that Dio specifically rejects a general expulsion and it would be more reasonable to assume that only the most vocal people on either side of the Christ issue were expelled.Raymond E. Brown and John P. Meier Antioch and Rome (May 1983) page 102 Feldman states that the expulsion mentioned by Dio refers to the same event in Suetonius, but had a limited nature. Feldman states that given that Claudius' Jewish friend Agrippa I had been helpful in his ascent to the throne as in Ant 19.236-44, and given Claudius' actions in Ant 20.10-14 it seems hard to believe that Claudius would have expelled all the Jews due to a single agitator, soon after assuming the throne.Jew and Gentile in the Ancient World by Louis H. Feldman (Oct 14, 1996) page 304 Feldman states that the most likely explanation is that Claudius at first either expelled only the Christians or restricted public assembly by the Jews. In general, Cassius Dio does not use the word \\"Christian\\" in his Roman History, and appears not to distinguish (or unable to distinguish) Jews from Christians. Given this viewpoint, the large Christian population in Rome that Cassius Dio witnesses in his own time (up to AD 229) would appear to him to conflict with any historical reports of massive Jewish expulsions, such as that of AD 41. Thus providing the reason for Cassius Dio convincing himself that Jewish expulsions had not happened.Anonymous Christian layman, 19 Nov 2013 Paulus Orosius A page from a sixth-century Paulus Orosius Histories manuscript, Florence. The 5th-century Christian writer Paulus Orosius makes a possible reference to the event, citing two sources: The first source used by Orosius comes from a non- extant quote from Josephus.Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p. 137. It is this which provides the date of AD 49. His second source is Suetonius Claudius 25.4. Slingerland contends that Orosius made up the Josephus passage for which no scholar has been able to discover a source.Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p. 142. He also argues that the writer is guilty of manipulating source materials for polemic purposes.Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), pp. 139-141. Feldman states that \\"there is no such statement in the extant manuscripts of Josephus, and there is reason to believe that this version was created in the mind of Orosius himself.\\"Louis H. Feldman, Jew and Gentile in the Ancient World: Attitudes and Interactions From Alexander To Justinian (Princeton University Press, 1996) p.304. Philip Esler agrees with Slingerland that the AD 49 date \\"is a creation fully explicable within the tendentious historiography of this author.\\"Philip Francis Esler, Conflict and Identity in Romans: The Social Setting of Paul's Letter (Augsburg Fortress, 2004) p.99. However, E. M. Smallwood states that Orosius may have known of a passage from another author but confused the Josephus passage with it, or may have been quoting from memory.E. Mary Smallwood, The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian (Oct 1, 2001) pp. 210-211 Silvia Cappelletti states that the change in spelling was probably not due to Orosius but to an intermediate source he consulted.The Jewish Community in Rome: From the Second Century B. C. to the Third Century C. E. by Silvia Cappelletti (Aug 1, 2006) pp. 73-74 Cappelletti also states that the lack of the Josephus text referred to does not undermine the authority of the date Orosius has suggested. Brown tactfully states, \\"Orosius is not famous for his impeccable accuracy,\\" then adds that \\"such a date\\" (i.e. 49) \\"receives some confirmation from Acts.\\" Bernard Green states that given that this section of Orosius' history is based on the chronological order of events, and that he refers to the expulsion only briefly and attaches no significance to it, Orosius seems to be \\"guiltlessly reporting\\" an event based on records he had seen.Christianity in Ancient Rome: The First Three Centuries by Bernard Green (Apr 15, 2010) page 25 Rainer Riesner notes that it is not possible for Orosius to have derived the date of the expulsion that he wrote about from the Book of Acts.

They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement of the horse, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures that provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today. Good conformation in the limbs leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size can be found in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be fatal to horses, as their bodies are adapted to bear weight on all four legs and serious problems can result if this is not possible. Limb anatomy Rear limb anatomy Horses are odd-toed ungulates, or members of the order Perissodactyla. This order also includes the extant species of rhinos and tapirs, and many extinct families and species. Members of this order walk on either one toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and tapirs). This is in contrast to even-toed ungulates, members of the order Artiodactyla, which walk on cloven hooves, or two toes. This order includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes and deer. According to evolutionary theory, equine hooves and legs have evolved over millions of years to the form in which they are found today. The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe, while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones. Prairie-dwelling equine species developed hooves and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food. Forest-dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling equine species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family. =Legs= Skeleton of the lower forelimb Each forelimb of the horse runs from the scapula or shoulder blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb of the horse runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints is the same as in the forelimbs.Harris, p. 226.Giffin and Gore, pp. 262‚Äì263 When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago. The anatomy of the forelegs begins at the scapula. This is the shoulder in which provides the ease of movement as it is connected to various bones surrounding it such as the cervical vertebra (a section of the spine). The next bone is the humerus which leads onto the radius below. The radius is then connected to the bones of the knee. The carpus is located at the front of the knee and the pisiform is the back of the knee. Below the knee is the cannon bone which is also known as the 3rd metacarpal. 55 million years ago when the Eohippus existed, the cannon bone used to be the 3rd toe of the foot. Its fusion took place in order to increase height and power of the limb. Behind the cannon bone are the splint bones. The splint bones are also known as the 2nd and 4th metacarpal and fused 25 - 35 million years ago during the time of the Miohippus. They provide extra strength and support of the cannon bone and used to be the 2nd and 4th toes of the foot. Below the cannon bone is the fetlock joint in which lays a structure if many bones. Firstly are the sesamoid bones that act as part of the system that allows the leg to drop as pressure is applied and spring back up as pressure is released. Below this is the proximal phalanx also known as the long pastern which is followed by the middle phalanx (short pastern). Below these bones are the navicular bone and the distal phalanx. the distal phalanx can be known as the coffin bone or the pedal bone. Below the navicular bone is the navicular bursa. There are three main muscle groups of the forelimb. The triceps muscle straightens the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow to the bottom of the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.Harris, pp. 228‚Äì229. There are two apparatus in the limbs of the horse - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus. The fetlock joint is supported by group of lower leg ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus. This apparatus carries much of the weight of the horse, both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, the apparatus stores and releases energy in the manner of a spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. This ability to use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory apparatus consists of the suspensory ligament, the check ligament, the deep digital flexor tendon, the superficial flexor tendon, the common digital extensor tendon and the sesamoid bones.Harris, pp. 251‚Äì253. Horses use a group of ligaments, tendons and muscles known as the stay apparatus to \\"lock\\" major joints in the limbs, allowing them to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The lower part of the stay apparatus consists of the suspensory apparatus, which is the same in both sets of limbs, while the upper portion differs between the fore and hind limbs. The upper portion of the stay apparatus in the forelimbs includes the major attachment, extensor and flexor muscles and tendons. The same portion in the hind limbs consists of the major muscles, ligaments and tendons, as well as the reciprocal joints of the hock and stifle.Harris, p. 253. =Hoof= The coffin bone The hoof of the horse contains over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting the majority of the weight. Under the coffin bone is the navicular bone, itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located in the middle of the hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.Harris, pp. 254‚Äì256. Movement The pastern absorbing shock A sequence of movements in which a horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust.Harris, pp. 256‚Äì258. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.Harris, pp. 260‚Äì264. The forelegs carry the majority of the weight, usually around 60 percent, with exact percentages depending on speed and gait. Movement adds concussive force to weight, increasing the likelihood that a poorly built leg will buckle under the strain. At different points in the gallop, all weight is resting on one front hoof, then all on one rear hoof. In the sport of dressage, horses are encouraged to shift their weight more to their hindquarters, which enables lightness of the forehand and increased collection. While the forelimbs carry the weight the hind limbs provide propulsion, due to the angle between the stifle and hock. This angle allows the hind legs to flex as weight is applied during the stride, then release as a spring to create forward or upward movement. The propulsion is then transmitted to the forehand through the structures of the back, where the forehand then acts to control speed, balance and turning. The range of motion and propulsion power in horses varies significantly, based on the placement of muscle attachment to bone. The muscles are attached to bone relatively high in the body, which results in small differences in attachment making large differences in movement. A change of in muscle attachment can affect range of motion by and propulsion power by 20 percent. \\"Form to function\\" is a term used in the equestrian world to mean that the \\"correct\\" form or structure of a horse is determined by the function for which it will be used. The legs of a horse used for cutting, in which quick starts, stops and turns are required, will be shorter and more thickly built than those of a Thoroughbred racehorse, where forward speed is most important. However, despite the differences in bone structure needed for various uses, correct conformation of the leg remains relatively similar. Structural defects The ideal horse has legs which are straight, correctly set and symmetrical. Correct angles of major bones, clean, well-developed joints and tendons, and well-shaped, properly- proportioned hooves are also necessary for ideal conformation. \\"No legs, no horse\\" and \\"no hoof, no horse\\" are common sayings in the equine world. Individual horses may have structural defects, some of which lead to poor movement or lameness. Although certain defects and blemishes may not directly cause lameness, they can often put stress on other parts of the body, which can then cause lameness or injuries.Harris, pp. 265‚Äì266. Poor conformation and structural defects do not always cause lameness, however, as was shown by the champion racehorse Seabiscuit, who was considered undersized and knobby-kneed for a Thoroughbred. Common defects of the forelegs include base-wide and base- narrow, where the legs are farther apart or closer together on the ground then they are when they originate in the chest; toeing-in and toeing-out, where the hooves point inwards or outwards; knee deviations to the front (buck knees), rear (calf knees), inside (knock knees) or outside (bowleg); short or long pasterns; and many problems with the feet. Common defects of the hind limbs include the same base-wide and base-narrow stances and problems with the feet as the fore limbs, as well as multiple issues with the angle formed by the hock joint being too angled (sickle-hocked), too straight (straight behind) or having an inward deviation (cow-hocked). Feral horses are seldom found with serious conformation problems in the leg, as foals with these defects are generally easy prey for predators. Foals raised by humans have a better chance for survival, as there are therapeutic treatments that can improve even major conformation problems. However, some of these conformation problems can be transmitted to offspring, and so these horses are a poor choice for breeding stock. Lameness and injuries A polo pony with its legs wrapped for protection Lameness in horses is movement at an abnormal gait due to pain in any part of the body. It is frequently caused by pain to the shoulders, hips, legs or feet. Lameness can also be caused by abnormalities in the digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. While horses with poor conformation and congenital conditions are more likely to develop lameness, trauma, infection and acquired abnormalities are also causes. The largest cause of poor performance in equine athletes is lameness caused by abnormalities in the muscular or skeletal systems. The majority of lameness is found in the forelimbs, with at least 95 percent of these cases stemming from problems in the structures from the knee down. Lameness in the hind limbs is caused by problems in the hock and/or stifle 80 percent of the time. There are numerous issues that can occur with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness. Stocking up is an issue that occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing swelling and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and swelling. Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue, called a capped elbow, or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or swelling to the back of the fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear most often in the rear legs. Soft and fluid-filled, the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness. Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath, often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and lameness. Leg injuries that are not immediately fatal still may be life-threatening because a horse's weight must be distributed evenly on all four legs to prevent circulatory problems, laminitis, and other infections. If a horse loses the use of one leg temporarily, there is the risk that other legs will break down during the recovery period because they are carrying an abnormal weight load. While horses periodically lie down for brief periods of time, a horse cannot remain lying in the equivalent of a human's \\"bed rest\\" because of the risk of developing sores, internal damage, and congestion.

Roderick Mackenzie of Terrebonne (c.1761 ‚àí August 15, 1844) was a prominent Canadian fur trader, landowner and politician. He was a partner in the North West Company and a member of the Beaver Club at Montreal. He was a lifelong friend and the private confidante of his first cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie. He was an intellectual who established a library at Fort Chipewyan and both wrote and published works on the fur trade. In 1801 he made his home at Terrebonne, Quebec, purchasing the Seigneury in 1814, although he was forced by a court action to relinquish his title to the property in 1824. He continued to live there until his death. He held many public appointments, most notably as a member of the Legislative Council of Lower Canada. Early life Roderick Mackenzie was born in the Scottish Highlands at Achiltibuie in about 1761. He was the second son of Alexander Mackenzie (1737‚àí1789) of Achnaclerach, who was killed after falling from his horse following a dinner at Brahan Castle with his cousin, the Chief of Clan Mackenzie. Roderick's father was the grandson of James Mackenzie (d.1746) of Keppoch and Kildonan, a first cousin of John Mackenzie (d. 1731), 2nd Earl of Cromartie, and Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, 3rd Bt. Roderick's mother, Catherine Mackenzie, was the niece of Murdoch Mackenzie, 6th Laird of Fairburn. Her brother, Kenneth 'Corc' Mackenzie (1731‚àí1780), of Stornoway, was the father of Sir Alexander Mackenzie.Mackenzies of Achiltibuie In 1767, his father and grandmother lost the tack of Achiltibuie. It is widely thought that Roderick was sent to live with his uncle, Kenneth Mackenzie, at Stornoway, where he developed his lifelong friendship with his first cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie. He was educated with his cousin at the same school as Colin Mackenzie. In 1784, at Alexander's invitation, Roderick came out to Quebec.Sir Alexander and Roderick Mackenzie Fur trade In 1785, Mackenzie was employed as a clerk and as his cousin Alexander's assistant in the fur trading firm of Gregory, McLeod & Co., of Montreal. Mackenzie spent the winter of 1786/87 at Pinehouse Lake, reporting that the rival between their firm and the North West Company had resulted in the murder of one of their firm's wintering partners. To end the tension, Simon McTavish invited Gregory, McLeod & Co., to become part of the North West Company. In 1787, Alexander persuaded Roderick not to leave the fur trade (viewing his position as a clerk akin to slavery) and he joined Alexander in Athabasca to establish Fort Chipewyan as the NWC's headquarters in the region. It was here that Roderick established a library (see section 'Private Life'). During Alexander's many absences on his voyages, Roderick was left in charge, eventually succeeding him in 1794 when Alexander returned to Montreal. In 1795, Roderick was made a partner of the North West Company. Returning to Montreal in 1800, Mackenzie was made a partner in the newly organised firm of McTavish, Frobisher & Co. Other partners included William McGillivray, Duncan McGillivray and William Hallowell. He agreed to spend one last winter (1800/01) in Western Canada, before settling down to live at Terrebonne. Having retired as a wintering partner of the NWC, he surrendered one of his two shares, and gave up the other when the NWC absorbed the XY Company. He continued to attend NWC meetings at Fort William until 1808. In 1806, McTavish, Frobisher & Co. became McTavish, McGillivrays & Co., and Mackenzie retired from the firm in 1813. His one fifteenth share was bought out by the other partners for ¬£10,000. From about 1805 until 1825, he had entered into a business partnership with his brother, Henry, in the firm of Mackenzie, Oldham & Co., whose partners included the Hallowells and several other prominent fur traders. He had retained a financial connection with McTavish & McGillivrays which went bankrupt in 1825. Mackenzie successfully sued the partners (that included his brother Henry) for ¬£7,308 plus interest. He was unable to collect on the debt and in 1832 sold his claim to Samuel Gerrard for ¬£6,500. Public appointments In 1812, Mackenzie was commissioned Lt.-Colonel of the Terrebonne militia. From 1804 to 1816, he was Justice of the Peace for the Indian Territory, and from 1821 to 1839 he was the same for the districts of Montreal, Quebec, Trois-Rivi√®res, Gasp√©, and Saint-Fran√ßois. He was Commissioner of Roads and Bridges for Effingham County in 1817 and promoted improvements to the Rivi√®re des Prairies in 1819. He was also Commissioner for free schools at Terrebonne‚ÄìEffingham in 1809, and on a commission to study the best means of building a bridge between Montreal and the mainland in 1832. His most important appointment came in 1817, when he was placed on the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, solidifying his standing as one of the most important men in Lower Canada. He was very active in the 1820s and enjoyed a close relationship with the Governor, George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie. He supported the joining of Lower and Upper Canada, and vigorously opposed the Patriote majority in the Legislative Assembly. Private life Mackenzie was a tough and resourceful man, but he was also an intellectual and fluently bilingual.Roderick Mackenzie - ABC Bookworld While wintering in the North West he not only had books sent for him on a regular basis, but also established a library for North West Company employees at Fort Chipewyan in Athabasca, which led them to refer to the Fort as \\"the little Athens of the Arctic regions\\". On settling at Terrebonne he spent much of his time collecting information on the Canadian fur trade, native Indians and the natural history of Western Canada. Much of the information that he gathered was collected and published as Les Bourgeois de la Compagnie du Nord-Ouest, by his granddaughter's husband, The Hon. Louis-Rodrigue Masson. Mackenzie collected and posthumously published a copy of Simon Fraser's journal relating to his voyage from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast in 1808.Roderick Mackenzie - ABC Bookworld He is also credited as the author of the introduction to his cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie's, book Voyages from Montreal, which gives an overall history of the fur trade at that time. Roderick Mackenzie was a member of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec and of the American Antiquarian Society. He was also a fellow of the \\"Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries\\" at Copenhagen, Denmark. Roderick Mackenzie, though less of a maverick, was a great deal more diplomatic than his better known cousin, Sir Alexander. The two were close friends and Roderick publicly supported his cousin throughout his many ventures, while being Alexander's private confidante. When Alexander quarrelled with Simon McTavish and left the North West Company, Roderick reluctantly filled the vacancy offered to him by McTavish. This incident resulted in Alexander ceasing his correspondence with Roderick from 1800 to 1805. However, from 1805 they resumed their close friendship uninterrupted until their deaths. Terrebonne In 1814, Mackenzie purchased the Seigneury of Terrebonne from the estate of his deceased brother-in-law, Simon McTavish. He paid an initial ¬£8,000 and agreed to pay a further ¬£1,200 a year until the total of ¬£28,000 was settled. Mackenzie intended to continue McTavish's developments and had made plans to raise the annual revenue from ¬£1,000 to ¬£3,000. However, his sister-in-law, Marie-Marguerite (Chaboillez) McTavish, disagreed with the sale stating that the executors of her late husband's will had exceeded their authority in allowing it to be sold. A court action was brought against Mackenzie and in 1824 he was forced to relinquish his title to the property. Roderick Mackenzie's home in Terrebonne was one of the best-known in the area, with a six-stepped porch and four white columns supporting a second floor balcony.Epic Wanderer: David Thompson and the Mapping of the Canadian West (2003) by D'Arcy Jenish Mackenzie's brother-in-law, Joseph Bouchette, visited Terrebonne in 1815 and remarked, \\"...the mansion of Roderick Mackenzie, which is worthy of remark for the elegance of its construction; indeed there are several houses in a very superior style to be found in this village, it being a favoured spot, where many gentlemen, who have realised large fortunes in the North West Company fur trade retire to enjoy the comforts and luxuries of private life\\".Les √âcossais: The Pioneer Scots of Lower Canada, 1763-1855 (2006) By Lucille H.

It specializes in online-intensive and other grassroots activism to support Internet freedom, civil liberties, transparency, and human rights, and in opposition to censorship and corporate control of government. The organization was founded through a petition in opposition to the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act, sparking the movement that eventually defeated COICA's successor bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act, two highly controversial pieces of United States legislation.Daught, Gary F.

The organization has continued to fight for such causes in the wake of the successful shelving of these two acts. Demand Progress has also played key roles in forwarding the passage of net neutrality rules, blocking expansion of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, under which co-founder Aaron Swartz was indicted, and other key legislative efforts. Estimated membership numbers in early 2015 weigh in at over two million.  Leadership  Demand Progress' Executive Director David Segal is a former Democratic Rhode Island state representative and served on the Providence City Council as a member of the Green Party. The organization was co-founded by Aaron Swartz, an internet activist, and Segal. Immediately prior to the founding of Demand Progress, the pair had worked together on Segal's unsuccessful campaign for Congress, which had been backed by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, and which Swartz had also co-founded. Program Director David Moon was elected to serve in the Maryland House of Delegates in 2014.  Significance  *Demand Progress co-led efforts to secure passage of net neutrality regulations, including via co-organizing the Internet Slowdown Day mass-action, lobbying, and other activism. *Demand Progress has helped lead opposition to the COICA/PIPA/SOPA online censorship bills, to expansion of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and to mass surveillance. It played a critical role in the passage of net neutrality rules in 2014‚Äì15, and has engaged in dozens of other campaigns since its inception. *The Motion Picture Association of America and United States Chamber of Commerce have stated their opposition to Demand Progress on numerous occasions, mainly in respect to their stance on internet censorship. David Moon, Demand Progress' program director, responded to their statements, noting that the mere existence of their retort was proof that \\"the proponents are panicking.\\" *Demand Progress has worked on various projects in tandem with numerous other similar organizations, such as Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Democracy and Technology, the American Civil Liberties Union, Fight for the Future, et al.

The sculpture depicts a female figure resting in a seated position, with her legs folded back to her right, her left hand supporting her weight, and her right hand on her right leg. The drapery emphasises the female figure, but the facial features are abstracted and barely picked out. Background Henry Moore was a war artist in the Second World War. He made a series of drawings of people in London sheltering from the Blitz in the Underground, swathed in thick clothes. These drawings sparked an interest in drapery which was renewed by the classical sculptures that Moore saw during a trip to Greece in 1951. He was attracted by the ability of the drapery to draw attention to some parts of the human form by lying tightly on the shoulders, thighs or breasts while concealing other parts where the wrapping falls slack, and also by the varied textures created by small and large folds in the material. Moore made a series of sculptures of draped human forms in the 1950s after he was commissioned to create a sculpture for the new UNESCO Headquarters building in Paris. He wanted to create a figure in an architectural context, and turned to the seated human form. The first work in the series in 1955 was a maquette, Draped Seated Woman: Figure on Steps (LH 427), cast in a series of 10. This became the working model for the full-size sculpture that became his Draped Seated Woman 1957‚Äì58. He also made a similar work Draped Reclining Woman 1957-58. Moore ultimately abandoned these ideas for the UNESCO commission, and his UNESCO Reclining Figure 1957-58 (LH 416) is a much more abstract reclining form in travertine. Sculpture Moore's sculpture depicts a female figure in a seated position. It measures approximately long, tall, and weighs approximately . It is usually displayed mounted on a flat seat with raised arms to either side. The sculpture was originally made in plaster, and cast in bronze in an edition of seven; the plaster is now owned by the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the bronze casts are owned by institutions across the world. * Cast 0: on loan to the Tate Gallery * Cast 1: on display at the Skulpturenpark Waldfrieden, Wuppertal * Cast 2: London Borough of Tower Hamlets, UK. On display in Cabot Square, Canary Wharf 2017‚Äì2022. * Cast 3: Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels * Cast 4: Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut * Cast 5: National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia * Cast 6: Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Givat Ram, Jerusalem The German cast (Die Sitzende) was bought for a new swimming pool in Wuppertal, the Wuppertaler Schwimmoper. It generated very negative reactions from the German public when it went on display. Overnight on 5‚Äì6 December 1958, the cast was tarred and feathered, and an anonymous letter was left suggesting that the metal would be better used to make 100 frying pans. The derision continued, and the city authorities eventually donated the sculpture to the Von der Heydt Museum in 1963, and it was moved in September 1966. It went into storage in 1997 while the building was renovated, and returned to the swimming pool in 2010.  Dispute over ownership  One of the casts was acquired by the London County Council in 1962 as part of its Patronage of the Arts Scheme. This scheme was operated by the London County Council and subsequently the Greater London Council between 1956 and 1965, pursuant to which approximately 70 works of art (mainly sculptures and murals) were purchased (including a cast of Draped Seated Woman). During that time, many new housing estates and schools were being built, as part of the regeneration process in London following World War Two. Sir Alan Bowness (Director of the Tate Gallery from 1980‚Äì88) was a member of the Advisory Committee and knew the then leader of the LCC, Sir Isaac Hayward, who encouraged the siting of such works of art on the new housing estates, in schools and parks, so that they could be enjoyed by the people of London. On 5 October 1959, the General Purposes Committee of the London County Council approved a programme for the acquisition and commissioning of works of art in the financial year 1959 to 1960 and had allocated ¬£20,000 for that purpose. Provision had previously been made for expenditure of ¬£1,500 for a sculpture (The Lesson by Franta Belsky) for the Avebury Estate, Bethnal Green, and ¬£3,500 for a second work of art at the Alton Road Estate, Roehampton (The Watchers by Lynn Chadwick). The Housing Committee had decided not to pursue these proposals and instead noted that the Committee should consider providing work at the Stifford Estate, (Clive Street), Stepney (where Draped Seated Woman was subsequently sited) and the Alton Road Estate. The proposed fee for a work of art for the Clive Street Estate was ¬£2,000 plus incidental works of ¬£200, out of the annual budget of ¬£20,000.London County Council Minutes of Proceedings ‚Äì London Metropolitan Archives During 1960, the London County Council made provision for the purchase of a work of art to be sited on the Stifford Estate, a new housing estate in the process of being constructed. Construction was completed in 1961 and tenants moved in in 1962. A memorandum dated 27 July 1961 from the Advisory Body relating to the Patronage of the Arts notes: \\"Stifford Estate, Stepney (1959‚Äì60 programme) Provision has been made for a sculpture at a cost of ¬£2,200. The Advisory Body are of the opinion that the site is of such prominence and importance that a work of major importance should be provided‚Ä¶The last remaining copy of \\"Seated Draped Woman\\" by Henry Moore is available and the Advisory Body strongly recommend that it should be acquired for this estate. None of the other copies of the work is [sic] in London. The cost would be ¬£7,000 plus ¬£400 for incidental works\\". A concurrent report by the Clerk of the Council dated 4 September 1961 noted that it was \\"for the Sub-Committee to decide‚Ä¶whether to recommend to the Committee to approve the proposals of the Advisory Body, and to make any necessary programme adjustments, in respect of...Stifford Estate, Stepney\\", among others. Letter from the LCC to Henry Moore confirming the purchase The minutes of the General Purposes (Special Development and Arts) Sub-Committee dated 9 October 1961 subsequently passed a resolution that \\"subject to the approval of the Housing Committee the programmes of patronage of the arts for the years indicated are as follows:- (i) 1959‚Äì60 ‚Äì Stifford Estate, Stepney ‚Äì By the acquisition of a cast of \\"Draped Seated Woman\\" by Henry Moore, at a cost not exceeding ¬£7,000 plus ¬£400 for incidental expenses (instead of a sculpture at a cost of ¬£2,200)\\". The minutes of the Advisory Body's meeting dated 22 February 1962 note that in relation to the Stifford Estate \\"Henry Moore has agreed to sell a cast of his Draped Seated Women for a site on this estate, following the decision of the LCC General Purposes Committee to allocate ¬£7,000 for this purpose\\". The minutes also refer to the purchase of F. E. McWilliam's \\"Witch of Agnesi\\" for the Avery Hill training college site. = Siting Draped Seated Woman= Draped Seated Woman was installed on the Stifford Estate on 1 July 1962. Nicknamed \\"Old Flo\\" it remained at the same site until the demolition of the estate and in 1997 it was loaned by Tower Hamlets to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, where remained until October 2017. In 2012, Tower Hamlets made a decision to sell the sculpture which led to a public campaign to prevent the sale and a subsequent legal challenge over title. = The decision to sell = On 3 October 2012, Tower Hamlets' Cabinet (led by Lutfur Rahman) made the decision to sell the sculpture. This followed a resolution on 15 September 2010 where the Council asked its officers to explore options and costs for relocating the Sculpture in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The findings were presented to the Cabinet on 3 October 2012 who concluded that they would seek to sell the sculpture and consign it to Christie's for sale at public auction. Tower Hamlets took no steps to identify any other parties who may have had a claim to title of the Sculpture or to confirm title before this decision was made. The decision was then called-in pursuant to paragraph 16 of part 4 of the Council's Constitution. The call-in requisition cited the following reasons for the call-in: # \\"The Council has had several years to investigate options for the statue and report on them. It has not done so. # The report [the First Report] refers in options [sic] for return, just Canary Wharf and Victoria Park. But gives no details of any negotiations with Canary Wharf or examines any other options within the Borough. # The report is therefore lacking in information in which to consider the sale of such an asset\\". The Decision was subsequently discussed by the Council's Overview and Scrutiny Committee on 6 November 2012. The meeting was attended by a representative of the Museum of London, who presented the Museum's proposal to house the Sculpture at its secure site at no cost to the Council. The Committee unanimously referred the Decision back to the Cabinet for further consideration, proposing several alternative actions (see paragraph 8.2 of the Committee's Minutes). These included that: > \\"Insufficient consideration has been given to alternative options for > returning the sculpture to the borough for public view and the decision > seems to have been rushed. The alternative options should now be fully > considered. In particular the offer from the Museum of London Docklands to > host and insure the sculpture should be explored as well as the other > expressions of interest and offers of support These offers illustrate that > it is possible to return the sculpture to public view in the borough > securely.\\" At the Cabinet meeting the following day, 7 November, the Committee's findings were acknowledged, but the decision to sell the sculpture was reaffirmed. = The campaign = A number of organisations were involved in the campaign to prevent the sale of Draped Seated Woman including the Art Fund and the Museum of London and in 2012 researchers from the Museum of London discovered that the sculpture was never transferred legally to Tower Hamlets and that the likely owner of the sculpture was actually the London Borough of Bromley in its capacity as successor to the London Residuary Body. When challenged, Tower Hamlets was unable to provide any evidence that the sculpture was ever transferred to it on the abolition of the GLC and after prolonged correspondence between the two councils the case went to the High Court for a determination on title. = The High Court case = It was argued by the respondent in the High Court in 2015 that the route to title for the London Borough of Bromley was as follows: # Under the Local Government Act 1963, the London County Council was abolished and replaced by the Greater London Council with effect from 1 April 1965. Pursuant to the provisions of the Local Government Act 1963, Stepney (in which the Stifford Estate was located) was incorporated into the then newly created London Borough of Tower Hamlets. # By virtue of Section 16 and Schedule 4 of the London Authorities (Property etc.) Order 1964, all property of the London County Council which was not expressly transferred by Order of the Secretary of State would be transferred to and retained by the Greater London Council. Title to the sculpture therefore transferred to the Greater London Council. # On 1 July 1985, under the Greater London Council (Transfer of Land and Housing Accommodation) (No. 3) Order 1981 and (Amendment) Order 1985 (made by way of statutory instruments 1981 No.644 and 1985 No.828), the land and housing accommodation on the Stifford Estate together with other related buildings (such as garages, sheds, lawnmowers and estate amenities) was transferred to Tower Hamlets. The Sculpture was not listed anywhere or identified in the \\"Revised Property Schedule and Consolidated Administrative List of Property Transferred\\" even though the schedule (which ran to 252 pages) specifically identified all parking spaces, sheds and transformers on the site which were to be subject to the transfer. It also made it clear that amenity land, greens and shrub beds whilst not listed were included. There were detailed plans showing the Stifford Estate and the other estate amenities transferred. The Sculpture was not identified in the plans or listed in the schedule and as such it did not transfer to Tower Hamlets under this transfer order. # Under the Local Government Act 1985 the GLC was dissolved. All assets of the GLC not otherwise specifically transferred vested in the London Residuary Body, by virtue of s.62 of the Local Government Act 1985. This transfer included Draped Seated Woman as it had not been transferred to Tower Hamlets by any other means. # In 1996 the London Residuary Body was wound up pursuant to the London Residuary Body (Winding Up) Order 1996. At that point all assets not otherwise assigned passed to the London Borough of Bromley in its capacity as successor to the London Residuary Body, pursuant to s.3 of that order. At this point the sculpture became the property of the London Borough of Bromley. Tower Hamlets disagreed with this and asserted that either: # the Sculpture fell within the definition of property held in connection with housing accommodation pursuant to s. 23(5) of the Local Government Act 1963 and had therefore transferred to them by virtue of this. Or # In the alternative the sculpture was a fixture and had therefore transferred to them with the land on which it stood. Or # In the alternative it was an estate amenity and therefore transferred with the Stifford Estate. # The final argument by Tower Hamlets was that the Council had committed an act of conversion by lending the sculpture to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997 and that Bromley's title to the sculpture was therefore extinguished under the Limitation Act 1980. In July 2015, Mr Justice Norris, sitting in the Chancery Division of the High Court, ruled that the route to title argued by the London Borough of Bromley was correct and that the sculpture never transferred legally to Tower Hamlets on the abolition of the GLC by any of the routes argued by Tower Hamlets. He also ruled that the sculpture was not a fixture, was not an estate amenity and had not transferred with the land on which it stood. However the Judge accepted the final argument from Tower Hamlets that it had committed the tort of conversion when it loaned the sculpture as this was an act inconsistent with Bromley's rights as owner. As more than six years had passed since the act of conversion the judge ruled that Bromley's title was therefore extinguished under limitation and as such title now sits with Tower Hamlets. This was a controversial decision as it resulted in a public authority enriching itself by its own wrongdoing which conflicts with one of the basic principles of public law which is that public authorities will act lawfully. In parallel with the high court case a challenge was lodged against the election of Lutfur Rahman as Mayor of Tower Hamlets and his election was declared null and void when the Election Court officially reported Rahman to be \\"personally guilty\\" of \\"corrupt or illegal practices, or both\\" (electoral fraud) under the Representation of the People Act 1983. With removal of Rahman there was another election held for Mayor which was won by the Labour candidate John Biggs who subsequently made a commitment to cancel the sale and investigate a way by which the sculpture could be displayed in Tower Hamlets.

Early years Garnett was born in Portsea, Portsmouth, England in 1850, the son of William Garnett. In January 1863 he entered the City of London School, where he was a pupil of Thomas Hall. In the May 1866 examination, he obtained the first Royal Exhibition, tenable at the Royal School of Mines and College of Chemistry, and during the winter session, he studied under Dr. Edward Frankland and Professor John Tyndall, but in the following year, resigned the Exhibition and returned to the City of London School. In April 1869, he gained the Exhibition for Natural Science at St John's College, Cambridge, and in July of the same year, the Beaufoy Mathematical Scholarship at the City of London School, and commenced residence at St. John's College in October. The following summer, he was first in the competition for Sir James Whitworth's Scholarship for Mechanical Engineering, and in 1871, was elected Foundation Scholar at St. John's College. In January 1873, he took his degree as Fifth Wrangler, and shortly afterwards, on the opening of the Cavendish Laboratory, he was appointed Demonstrator in Experimental Physics by Professor James Clerk Maxwell. In November 1874, he was elected Fellow of St. John's College, and retained his fellowship till his marriage in 1879. Career In October 1876, he became a Lecturer in the Cavendish Laboratory, and continued to lecture there upon mechanics, heat, magnetism, and electricity until 1880, when he declined to be reappointed. In April 1879, he was appointed by the Senate Examiner in Natural Philosophy in the University of London. Shortly afterwards, he was appointed Lecturer on Physics at St. John's College. In 1879, 1880, and 1881, he was one of the Examiners in the Natural Sciences Tripos. In April 1882, the Committee of University College, Nottingham, invited him to accept the Professorship of Mathematics, Physics, and Mechanics. Shortly afterwards, he was appointed Electrician to the Nottingham Corporation; he commenced work at Nottingham in October 1882. During the following summer, he organised a system of technical education in connection with the mechanical department of the College, and fitted up a complete set of engineering workshops. He also became a Lecturer on Mechanics and Physics at Newnham College. In November 1883, Garnett was appointed Principal and Professor of Mathematics in the Durham College of Science, Newcastle upon Tyne and began that post the following year; he also assisted in planning and erecting the buildings of Durham College of Science. He served as a member of the Executive Council, and was chairman of the Electric Lighting Committee of the Royal Jubilee Exhibition in Newcastle (1887). Garnett served as Secretary and Educational Adviser to the Technical Education Board (1893‚Äì1904). He was an educational adviser to the London County Council and one of H.M. Commissioners for the Exhibition, as well as serving on the Royal Commission's Science Scholarships Committee (1890‚Äì1932). Garnett received an Honorary D.CL. from Durham College, and was an Honorary Member of North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers.

An injury to Jack Hobbs gave him his chance to play regularly, and he scored over 1,000 runs in his first full season. His career was almost ended over a challenge to his qualification to play for Surrey in 1922. Outside of cricket, Jeacocke worked in the family business at Smithfield Market. Cricket career Up until the 1920 cricket season, Jeacocke played club cricket in Surrey. After playing second team cricket, he made his first-class debut for Surrey on 29 May 1920. He played eight matches in total, averaging 26.00. When Jack Hobbs was indisposed through illness and injury early in the 1921 season, Jeacocke was selected as an opening batsman for Surrey, in partnership with Andrew Sandham. He was very successful, scoring 1,056 runs at an average of 42.24 with three centuries. His average was among the best by amateur batsmen that season. Although never again passing 1,000 runs, he continued to play regularly for Surrey throughout the 1920s, and was selected six times to play in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match. During his first-class career, Jeacocke worked in his family's business in Smithfield Market each day before cricket, rising to start work at 3am and continuing until play was due to start in any match in which he played.Streeton, p. 126. From 1929, Jeacocke appeared infrequently, but continued to play club cricket with great success. He mainly represented Forest Hill cricket club, continuing to appear in the team until the 1950s, and was president of the club at the time of his death in 1961. Controversies During 1922, when he hit his highest first-class score of 201, Jeacocke was involved in a controversy over his registration to play for Surrey. He was born outside of the county of Surrey, but qualified to play for the team through having lived there long enough to be eligible. In August, Kent questioned his qualification on the grounds that he technically lived in Kent‚Äîhis house was within the Kent boundary, although the other side of the road fell within Surrey. The situation arose through a housing shortage; when Jeacocke married in 1920, there were no suitable houses for him and his wife, so his father lent him a house rent-free. Jeacocke missed the remainder of the season, but Percy Fender, the county captain, defended him in the press and pointed out that the letter of the law meant that Jeacocke would have to re-qualify, making him ineligible until 1924. Kent were probably driven by Lord Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent. During the same season, Harris had forced Gloucestershire to drop Wally Hammond from their team as he had not properly qualified for the team; he later defended Kent's actions in the press and equated any disagreement with Bolshevism. The Jeacocke episode generated much criticism of Lord Harris in the press, and the qualification rules were changed before the 1923 season so that a player was considered to be qualified for a county for the rest of his career once he had played three seasons with the club‚Äîas Jeacocke had.Streeton, pp. 125‚Äì26. In 1925, Jeacocke was involved in another incident, the details of which are vague. Surrey played Essex County Cricket Club at Leyton Cricket Ground. The rules for the time at which the lunch interval began had just been standardised, and Fender rejected a request from the Essex captain, Johnny Douglas, to keep the old time for the interval on the Leyton ground, preferring to \\"stick to MCC rules\\". This possibly aggravated what followed,Streeton, p. 159. and during this period Fender and Douglas had a difficult relationship.Streeton, p. 162. After two days' play, Surrey had scored 431 and Essex had replied with 333 for seven wickets. Before the third and final day, one of the umpires informed the captains that none of Surrey's professional players had arrived in time for the start of play. Douglas refused to postpone the start, stating \\"Strict MCC rules, Fender‚Äîthe side refusing to play loses the match.\\"Streeton, pp. 159‚Äì60. Fender elected to continue, and when play began, only he and Jeacocke were present and these two went out to field alone. They had driven to the ground together, while the professionals were delayed in traffic. The Essex batsmen, possibly embarrassed by their captain's stance, did not appear until Fender sent a message saying that he could claim victory in the match if they did not come out to bat. They did so, and Fender and Jeacocke bowled from opposite ends until the remainder of the team arrived.Streeton, p. 160. The two men bowled wide and the batsmen made no attempt to score.Streeton, pp. 161‚Äì62. Later in the day, the crowd jeered Fender for refusing to declare his innings closed, unaware of what had passed earlier. Whether the press were unaware of what happened, or if they agreed to keep it quiet, the incident was not reported, although several accounts hinted that something unusual had occurred. The play which took place was not recorded by the match scorers until the full Surrey team arrived, but several players who took part remembered it happening.Streeton, pp. 160‚Äì61. In later years, rumours persisted that something like it had taken place. Style and technique As a batsman, Jeacocke scored quickly, and was an effective driver of the ball. Many of his longer innings were scored at a great pace. His obituary in The Cricketer magazine described him as \\"a tall and stylish batsman and a superb driver\\". He was also a good slip fielder. In first-class cricket, he scored 6,228 runs at an average of 28.83 and took 14 wickets with off spin. Twice in his career, he shared partnerships of over 200 runs with Sandham.

Two city council incumbents ran for reelection in their same district and one ran for election in the newly created ninth district. Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, although most members do identify a party preference. A two-round system was used for the election, starting with a primary in June followed by a runoff in November between the top-two candidates if no candidate received a majority of the votes in the first round.

It is produced by GMA Films together with Regal Films. The film was supposed to have premiered on 8 April 2013, but after a series of postponed showings, it was released nationwide on 3 July 2013.  Plot  Zach (Gutierrez) is a rich boy forced to find and keep a job after a major blunder in a company he set up. He ends up working for Evelyn, whom he discovers to be the boss from hell. In the long run, he sees her for who and what she really is. Meanwhile, Evelyn (Rivera) is an uptight and tough Brand Manager who hires an assistant Brand Manager. When she finds herself dumped by her boyfriend, Evelyn seeks comfort in Zach, her assistant who shows a different side of him. As they get to know each other more and as their encounters become more intimate, they begin to ask themselves if what they feel for each other is for real. The problem is romance between boss and subordinate in a company is not allowed. Things get complicated when an office romance develops between the unlikely pair.

It is going to be the second film which stars Rivera and actor Richard Gutierrez together following the My Best Friend's Girlfriend produced by the same film outfit in 2008. On a set visit by Samantha Portillo of GMA Network, Gutierrez states that \\"..after 5 years, finally, we get to do a movie\\", while Rivera says that her working relationship with Richard is better than ever. On an interview on The Philippine Star, Gutierrez talked about the film saying \\"..It's entertaining and light. It feels good doing a movie of this type again. I was looking forward to this movie after Seduction. We enjoy doing the movie. Although the acting is serious, it is lighter.\\" He further added that the film, though still a romantic-comedy, is more mature than BFGF(My Besftriend's Girlfriend). Originally, it is slated for 13 February 2013 film date but was pushed back because of scheduling issues. According to an article published by \\"Filipinas in Showbiz\\", the film is very much alike with Hollywood film, The Proposal(2009) produced by Mandeville Films. An assumption which proved to be inaccurate because the story of My Lady Boss is not similar to the Proposal, other than the leading actress is the boss of the leading actor. The Proposal is a film about a Canadian lady Executive working in the United States who is forced to pretend to be engaged to her American assistant so that she will not be deported back to Canada. My Lady Boss, on the other hand is about a failed young businessman who is forced to seek employment to get back to the good graces of his disappointed rich grandfather. In January 2013, two short teasers were shown on television, but it was removed on-air after its playdate pushback. The full trailer was first released on the #PPSummerShake episode of Sunday variety show, Party Pilipinas. The theme song for the movie is a new rendition by Aicelle Santos and Gian Magdangal to \\"I'll Never Go\\" originally sung by Nexxus. An acoustic version by Rita Iringan and a band version by Kristofer Martin will also be used on the film. = Filming = The film is set on various locations in the Philippines, with majority of sets in Fairlane, West Fairview, Quezon City. = Release and box office status = The film was originally slated for a 14 February 2013 release date but it was postponed to 10 April 2013 because production failed to finish shooting the movie on time. But GMA Films moved it again because it would conflict with several Hollywood Summer Blockbuster releases. The movie was finally shown on 3 July 2013. The film grossed P19.45 million after its two weeks of showing.

His work includes oil paintings, drawings, and acrylic sculpture that speak to such diverse subjects as the promotion of stem cell research and the politically charged relationship of man with nature. Early life and education Born to an Italian father and Romanian mother, Darida grew up in the city of Satu Mare. After graduating from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Romania, in 1978, Darida struggled with the restraints on creative freedom imposed by the communist regime. In 1985, Darida left Romania for Italy and enrolled for studies at the Benedetti Liberal Academy of Art in Rome. In 1987, Darida sought the help of Clelio Darida (no relation), undersecretary of the Minister of the Interior, former Mayor of Rome as he was still being harassed by the Romanian government. Darida immigrated to the United States that year, where he continued his studies at the American Academy of Art in Chicago. Artistic style and reviews Darida's style is associated with chiaroscuro a technique that uses strong contrasts between light and dark. Many of Darida's works feature, or are applied to musical instruments and/or incorporate natural and man made objects as part of the \\"Vibrant Expression\\" style. For his sculpture, he works in the medium of acrylic, and his forms are influenced by the Romanian sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi (1876-1957),. Darida's sculptures use the transparency of acrylic to create layers of thin glazes, echoing the technique that he applies in his paintings. Darida tackles controversial issues such as stem cell research, renewable green energy sources, man's place in relation to nature, and music related to the cosmic forces. He explains that color, or absence of color, as well as the shape and meaning of his work have roots in a certain universal energy. Claudia Moscovici wrote: Darida considers art to be \\"the soul of the people\\" and feels that \\"if you touch people's hearts then that art will stay forever\\". \\"Darida's women are allegorical phantasms that populate our childhood fantasies and dreams. His application of paint is both delicate and rough; soft plays of light and shadow highlight the luminosity of gold. At the same time, the vitality of heavy, swirling paint applied with a palette knife endow his paintings with a modern feel.\\" Sarah Seamark, Editor in Chief of Art World wrote: \\"Darida utilizes found objects that merge elements of abstract and sculptural forms that represents a reconciliation with self and our surroundings. Their use, in combination with Darida's classic painting technique, is designed to create a distinguished, forward-looking style.\\" Awards and recognition Darida's museum placements include the Powerhouse Museum and the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia, and his work had been featured at Municipal Galleries across Romania, in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC, and the Illinois State Museum. He is the recipient of awards including the Formello-Roma International Prize for Painting and the Award for Excellence in the Multimedia Miniatures Show in Romania. Alexandru is heavily involved with music and paints to music. Darida often finds inspiration in the voice of his wife who is an opera singer.

They erected 25 tents on private Palestinian land in the E1 area where Israel has decided to build more than 3500 housing units. It was in the E1 area Israel intends to fill with houses, and, according to David Shulman, impede thereby the construction of a Palestinian state. The site was forcibly evacuated on January 12, when the IDF arrived in the middle of the night, tore down the tents, and also beat and arrested many of the activists.David Shulman 'Hope in Hebron,' at New York Review of Books 22 March 2013 100 people were arrested. On January 16, the Palestinian Authority created a formal village council for Bab al-Shams. The Israeli government intended to remove the tent outpost, claiming that it was illegal, but the activists received an injunction from the Supreme Court of Israel prohibiting the government from doing so for 6 days. The following day, the occupants were evacuated by the Israeli army, in defiance of the Supreme Court injunction. An Israeli police spokesman said the court allowed for the removal of the protesters even if the tents would stay temporarily. 100 people were arrested.    * Comments Responding to the eviction of the site by Israeli police, the UN secretary General Ban Ki-moon, noted that the protestors had been \\"largely non-violent\\", adding that the right to stage peaceful protest should be \\"fully respected\\". Ban re-iterated his position that Israel should scrap its plans for development in the E1 area stating that \\"Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law\\" and that \\"any such settlement plans for E1 must be rescinded\\". After ordering the evacuation of the site, despite an Israeli Supreme court injunction against its demolition, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, stated that \\"We will not allow anyone to harm the contiguity between Jerusalem and Maale Adumim\\". Palestinian leaders also commented on the event. Majid Suweilim, professor of political science at Al Quds University described Bab al Shams as \\"a direct challenge to the shift of Israeli policy towards the extreme right\\". He said that the message from the activists was that discussion over negotiations and international pressure had failed and that on the ground there should be a shift towards \\"democratic, resilient, peaceful popular resistance\\". The protest mirrors Israeli settlements tactics, though Palestinian activists say \\"this land is ours\\". A Time report on the event contrasted the \\"unusual briskness\\" in which the Palestinian site was evacuated with the Jewish settlement outposts of which there are around 100, that although illegal under Israeli law, are supplied with utilities by the Israeli government and protected by the Israeli army.

Voyages  The artist Charles Henry Miller, a recent graduate of New York Homeopathic Medical College, sailed on the Harvest Queen as ship's surgeon in 1864, under Captain Hutchinson, between New York and Liverpool. > This vessel, though never renowned for fast voyages, as were so many of her > sister clippers, was a noted emigrant ship ... In 1864, when our artist made > his first and last voyage in her, common sailors were getting ninety dollars > for the trip, and bounty jumping was frequently practised. Many desperadoes, > attracted by the high rate of wages, shipped as foremast hands, and stirring > scenes were enacted. A mutiny, which was luckily quelled without loss of > life, broke out twice on the Harvest Queen; and Mr. Miller, among his other > reminiscences of an eventful voyage, recalls a day when he was ranged beside > the captain on the quarter-deck, revolver in hand, ready to aid in > overcoming the mutineers ... When the ship reached New York on her return > trip, two of the sailors were drowned in an attempt to escape from her; and > the sketches made by Mr. Miller on board include one of a luckless and > forlorn-looking seaman, standing at the wheel, who had jumped overboard, but > was captured and severely beaten. > > While the Harvest Queen was lying in the Liverpool docks, Miller took a > flying trip to London, Scotland, and France, making numerous sketches. When > he reached home again, his love of art, freshly kindled by the sight of some > of the great art galleries of Europe, and the wonderful ocean scenes which > he had attempted to draw on the voyage, proved itself too strong to be > overcome. He abandoned medicine, and returned to the practice of art in New > York.  Collision and sinking  \\"The American ship Harvest Queen ... while beating up the English Channel, having nearly completed her voyage from San Francisco, and, we may suppose, with most of her crew in the forecastle singing, yarning, and getting their \\"shore togs\\" ready for the morrow, was cut down by the steamship Adriatic. She sank almost immediately. Not a soul was saved. A terrible shriek floated across the sea and then all was still. Boats were lowered from the Adriatic, which cruised about all night, but in vain; when daylight spread over the Channel not a spar nor a vestige of the unfortunate ship marked her grave.\\" Harvest Queen sank so quickly that the crew of Adriatic could not identify what ship they had hit, and only a records search later showed who the victim had been. \\"Before a Court of Admiralty held in New York on the White Star Liner's arrival, testimony was adduced throwing the blame on the Harvest Queen because her lights were not visible.\\" References Category:Packet (sea transport) Category:Ships built in New York City Category:Sailing ships of the United States Category:Passenger ships of the United States Category:Shipwrecks in the Irish Sea Category:Ships sunk in collisions Category:Maritime incidents in 1876 Category:1854 ships Category:Barques Category:Ships built by William H.
