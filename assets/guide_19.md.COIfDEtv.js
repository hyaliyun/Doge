Setting The Middle Atlantic coastal forests stretch along the Southern Atlantic coast of the United States from extreme Southern New Jersey south to the Georgia coast. They cover the lower Atlantic coastal plain and are bordered on the west by the Southeastern mixed forests. The habitats of the ecoregion are constantly modified by natural processes. The bottomlands, coastal plains, and maritime areas are vulnerable to tropical cyclones and floods. The drier areas with porous sandy soils are susceptible to fires and drought. Fire return intervals of 1 to 3 years favor herbaceous plants; longer intervals favor dense shrubs, to broadleaved evergreen trees. Climate This ecoregion has a humid subtropical climate with hot summers and mild winters, and with the heaviest precipitation concentrated in the warmest months. Flora Two basic types of forests are found in this region; 1) Southern mixed hickory-pine-oak forests that see frequent fire with sandy soils, and 2) isolated patches of evergreen broadleaved forests and \\"hammocks\\" close to the Atlantic coastline in the southernmost areas in coastal South Carolina and coastal Georgia. The mixed pine-oak forests occur on dry or sandy soils or in areas exposed to occasional fires. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), superbly adapted to fire-prone environments, was the principal tree in many of these forests; however, extensive logging and human development have reduced this trees occurrence to less than 5% of its former range. Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) grow in sandy soils and are still dominant in this ecosystem. Loblolly is widely planted on millions of acres of plantation forest's across the southeastern US. On moist soils or where fires are infrequent, hardwoods overtake the pines. These hardwoods include turkey oak (Quercus laevis), post oak (Quercus stellata), myrtle oak (Quercus myrtifolia), Spanish oak (Quercus falcata), and southern catalpa (Catalpa bignonioides). Evergreen broadleaved forests occur close to the coast in localized areas as either evergreen Maritime oak forests or as more localized evergreen hammocks(geographically induced forest islands) (Box 1985). These forests consist of evergreen broadleaved canopy trees, such as Magnolia grandiflora, Magnolia virginiana, Persea borbonia, Gordonia lasianthus, Sabal, and several evergreen oaks such as Quercus myrtifolia, and the iconic Quercus virginiana or southern Live Oak often covered with Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides). The understory is also often evergreen in these forests, with Myrica cerifera and Osmanthus americanus very common, while several evergreen species of Ericaceae, Ilex, and scrub palms (Sabal minor and Serenoa) are common on more moist sites. In the open areas near sandy beaches and coastal areas, large endemic populations of Yucca and cactus (Opuntia) thrive in the hot sun and sandy soils. The Middle Atlantic coastal forests contain the most diverse assemblage of freshwater wetland communities in North America. These include freshwater marshes, shrub bogs, white cedar swamps, bayheads, and wet hammocks. The bottomland hardwood forests for which the ecoregion is famous are dominated by bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and swamp tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora). Bald cypress swamps are often dominated by their namesake tree, and are too wet for foot travel. Many uncommon orchids grow among the baldcypress branches. Swamp tupelo, along with water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), dominate mixed-hardwood swamp forests. These grow aside water- adapted oaks that include water oak (Quercus nigra), swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii), cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda), willow oak (Quercus phellos), and overcup oak (Quercus lyrata). Swamp hickory (Carya glabra) and water hickory (Carya aquatica) are also found here. Pawpaw (Asimina triloba) grows in the understory. Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) swamps occur along blackwater rivers. Pocosins are flat and damp, sandy, or peaty areas far from streams. They have scattered pond pine (Pinus serotina) and a dense growth of mostly evergreen shrubs including gallberry (Ilex glabra). Barrier islands along the coast protect extensive estuaries, lagoons, and sounds. Carolina bays are a unique habitat of the ecoregion. Fauna The nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) is a distinctive animal that lives in this ecoregion. The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is abundant. In the mixed pine-oak forests, the brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) feeds on pine seeds. The yellow-throated warbler (Dendroica dominica) is widely distributed. The northern parula warbler (Parula americana) and the eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) are also found here. The Bachman sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) and red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), both uncommon, also live in this ecoregion. The bottomland forests support abundant arthropods, produce mast that sustains migratory birds during the winter, and produce boles, branch cavities, and rotting logs that support various detritivores and hole-nesting species. In the extreme southeast regions (coastal southeast North Carolina south to Georgia) the large American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) can be found along tidal inlets and marsh areas. Contemporary land use The main causes of habitat conversion are agriculture, fire suppression, urbanization, coastal development, ditching and draining of wetlands, and damming of rivers. The western part of the ecoregion has been most altered. There, the upland vegetation has been nearly completely converted. Long-leaf pine (Pinus palustris) savannas have nearly disappeared. The least altered habitats in the ecoregion are the coastal marshes and deep peatlands.

It is in the Sonoran Desert in northwest Mexico, east of Gulf of California, in the eastern part Gran Desierto de Altar, just below the border of Arizona, United States and north of the city of Puerto Pe√±asco. It is one of the most significant visible landforms in North America seen from space. A volcanic system, known as Santa Clara is the main part of the landscape, including three peaks; Pinacate, Carnegie and Medio. In the area there are over 540 species of plants, 40 species of mammals, 200 of birds, 40 of reptiles, also amphibians and freshwater fishes. There are threatened endemic species as sonoran pronghorn, bighorn sheep, gila monster and desert tortoise. The biosphere reserve covers an area of making up about half of the World Heritage site. The extent of the World Heritage site is 7,146 km¬≤, greater than that of the states of Aguascalientes, Colima, Morelos and Tlaxcala separated.  Formation  El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve is known for its unique physical and biological characteristics, by the presence of a volcanic shield, and by the extensive areas of active dunes that surround it, and the greatest concentration of Maar craters. The Pinacate Mountains range has orogenic features of high interest, products of volcanic eruptions that accumulated lava in compact rocks, sand and volcanic ashes that formed colors of special beauty, and craters such as El Elegante, Cerro Colorado, MacDougal, and Sykes. ;Pinacate Peaks The Pinacate Peaks (Picos del Pinacate), a group of volcanic peaks and cinder cones, are located in the Reserve north of Puerto Pe√±asco. The highest peak is Cerro del Pinacate (Santa Clara volcano), with an elevation of . Pinacate comes from N√°huatl language word pinacatl, for the Pinacate beetle, a stink beetle endemic to the Sonoran Desert. The Pinacate Peaks volcanoes have erupted sporadically for about 4 million years. The most recent activity was about 11 000 years ago. NASA sent astronauts to the Gran Desierto de Altar from 1965 to 1970, to train for walking on the moon, due to the similarities of the terrain to the lunar surface.  History  Tohono O'odham woman. Photo by Edward S. Curtis, circa 1907. = Pre-Columbian era = The first inhabitants are known as San Dieguito people, they were hunter-gatherer who lived off the land, moving from the mountains to the sea of Gulf of California looking for food. The early stages of occupation seem to have ended at the beginning of ice age about 20 thousand years ago, when drought forced people to leave the mountain range.Hayden, 1998. A second stage of occupation by San Dieguito people began in the late glacial period. This group returned to the mountains and lived as their ancestors had. Tinajas must have been a reliable source of water during this time. The second stage of occupation ended with the arrival of an antipyretic period 9000 years ago, which again forced the people to leave the territory. The most recent indigenous inhabitants of the Pinacate and Gran Desierto de Altar are the Pinacate√±o band of the Hia C-ed O'odham. Like the prehistoric San Dieguito culture, the Pinacate√±os roamed the Pinacate all the way to the sea in search of food, concentrating their camps near the tinajas. During these voyages, they left signs of their presence; one example of this is the network of paths that go from tinaja to tinaja, as well as the stone tools and potsherds found near these water sources. = Explorations = There are few records of those who were the first explorers in this area. Possibly the first white man to see the mountain now known as Sierra Pinacate was the explorer Melchior D√≠az on 1540. Subsequently, on 1698 the priest Eusebio Kino, founder of Mission San Xavier del Bac in southern Tucson, Arizona, visited the site and returned on several occasions, he and his group climbed to the top of El Pinacate, which named Santa Clara Hill. Before 1956, few scientists and explorers had been in El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar, the most famous, the group MacDougal, Hornaday and Sykes who explored the western part of the mountain on 1907.

It is located along the Gauley River at the mouth of Rich Creek, northeast of Gauley Bridge. Due to its proximity to the county line, Jodie is part of the Nicholas County ZIP code of 26690; it had its own post office until its closure on July 23, 2005. History The first houses in the community were built by local logging companies in the late 1800s. The first post office was established in 1894, naming the town Imboden. The name of the town was changed to Jodie (the nickname of local congressman Joseph H. Gaines), in 1910. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad established a station in the community in 1912, named Bryce. In 1915, the Gauley Mountain Coal Company established Jodie as a coal town, utilizing existing lumber company houses as well as building additional ones to give the community its current look. A company store, movie theater, and boarding house were also built for the town, but they are now long gone. The houses were sold off to residents in the mid-1940s, and the local mines closed less than ten years later, forcing residents to commute elsewhere for employment. Community Jodie is home to two churches: Jodie Baptist Church on the riverfront, and Jodie Church of God, located in \\"New-Town\\". The town cemetery is named Rich Creek. The annual Jodie Reunion is held every summer to welcome residents both past and present. Transportation At one time, Jodie was connected to West Virginia Route 39 via ferry across the Gauley River. After the loss of the ferry in the early 1950s, residents were forced to rely on a 1926 C&O; railroad bridge converted for automobile traffic until the C.D.

He was murdered by a hostile crowd whilst trying to impose British rule in the sovereign state on Manipur. Life Quinton was born the son of a wine merchant in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ireland, and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and graduated BA in 1853. He subsequently served as secretary and president of the University Philosophical Society. Having been appointed to the Bengal civil service in 1856, he served in the North-West Provinces and Oudh until 1875, when he officiated for two years as judicial commissioner in Burma. Returning to the North-West Provinces in 1877, he was appointed magistrate and collector of the Allahabad district in April 1877, and officiating civil and sessions judge in April 1878. He was on special duty in July 1878 at Naini T√°l as a member of the North-West Provinces famine commission. He afterwards served as commissioner in the Jh√°nsi and Lucknow divisions, and in February 1883 was appointed an additional member of the governor-general's council, an office which he held in 1884, and again in 1886 and 1889. In the earlier of those years he was an ardent supporter of Lord Ripon's policy, which the majority of Anglo-Indians strongly disapproved. In 1884 he was appointed commissioner of the Agra division, and became a member of the board of revenue in 1885. He served as a member of the public service commission in 1886. He was gazetted CSI in 1887, and was appointed chief commissioner of Assam on 22 October 1889. A sketch map of Manipur by Ethel Grimwood showing the residency and key buildings In March 1891, owing to a rebellion having broken out in the small native state of Manipur, led by two of the younger brothers of the r√°j√°, who abdicated and took refuge at Calcutta, Quinton was sent to Manipur with an escort of five hundred Ghurkhas, and with instructions to recognise as the ruler of the state the second brother, who was acting as regent, and to arrest one of the younger brothers, Tikendrajit. Quinton reached Manipur on 22 March, and at once summoned a durbar, at which he intended to arrest the s√≠napati. Tikendraji, did not attend, and upon an attempt being made on the following day to arrest him in the fort, resistance was met by the Manipur troops, and was followed by an attack upon the British residency and camp, attended by considerable slaughter. Quinton thereupon offered to treat with the rebels, and was induced to repair to the fort, accompanied by Frank St. Clair Grimwood, the political agent, by Colonel Skene, the officer commanding the Ghurkhas, and by two other officers, all without arms. Immediately on their arrival they were taken prisoners and murdered. Quinton's hand was cut off, his body hacked to pieces, and his dismembered limbs thrown outside the city walls to be devoured by pariah dogs. Manipur was subsequently retaken by a British force; the s√≠napati was hanged, and the regent deposed. A young boy belonging to the family was recognised as r√°j√°, and during his minority the government of the state was entrusted to a British officer as political resident. Pensions of 300l. and 100l. a year respectively were granted to Quinton's widow and mother. Ethel Grimwood was declared the hero of the event and she received over ¬£1,000 and ¬£140 per year.

Moore Ave. in the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood of north Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was designed by the firm Harris & Richards and constructed by the Robert E. Lamb Company in 1922 for developer John Presper Eckert, Sr. History Eckert was the owner of the Philadelphia Realty Company, and during the 1920s he consulted with the American Railway Express Company (AREC) to build garages throughout the United States, as well as in Europe and Egypt. AREC's business was to ship express packages nationally by railway and to pick up and deliver them locally by truck. Thus AREC needed garages located near railway lines. The Philadelphia garage abuts railway tracks now owned by Amtrak and probably served customers in the Brewerytown neighborhood a few blocks to the south. Eckert's son, John Presper Eckert, Jr. later became famous as the inventor of ENIAC and other early computers. In August 2006, the site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Though a sign on the building proclaimed \\"Now Leasing,\\" in photographs accompanying the 2006 NRHP nomination, and in September 2010 (see photograph above), the roof was removed in 2004.Sheryl Jaslow, [ Pennsylvania Historic Resources Survey:American Railway Express Company Garage].

Life Reynolds was born in 1798. Her parents were Joseph Reynolds and Deborah (born Dearman). She was born near Wellington in Shropshire. Her grandfather was the ironmaster Richard Reynolds (1735‚Äì1816). In 1817 Hannah Mary Reynolds married her half-cousin, Richard Rathbone, a son of William Rathbone IV, By him she had six children. Illustration from the \\"The Poetry of Birds\\" (1832) by Hannah Mary Rathbone Mrs. Rathbone's health was delicate. She applied her early training in drawing and painting to minute work, including illuminating on vellum from old manuscript designs. She contributed twenty illustrations of small birds to The Poetry of Birds published in Liverpool in 1832. She also published a selection of pen-and-ink drawings from Pinelli's etchings of Italian peasantry. Later in life she took to landscape in water-colours. In 1840 she made her first modest literary venture by publishing a collection of pieces in verse entitled Childhood, some of which were from her own hand; and in 1841 there followed Selections from the Poets. So much of the Diary of Lady Willoughby, as relates to her Domestic History, and to the Eventful Period of the Reign of Charles the First, the work which gained celebrity for its author, was published anonymously in 1844; a second and a third edition following in 1845, and a New York edition in the same year. Influenced by her father's tastes, she had read many histories and memoirs of the Civil war and adjacent periods, and her publisher (Thomas Longman) took great pride in bringing out the Diary as an exact reproduction of a book of the seventeenth century, in which it was supposed to be written. He had a new fount specially cast at the Chiswick Press. In some quarters the Diary was at once accepted as genuine; in others, author and publisher incurred indignant reproof as having conspired in an intentional deception. Readers speculated on the identity of the writer; and Robert Southey, Lord John Manners, and Mr. John Murray were in turn suggested. In the third edition of 1873 the publishers and author inserted a joint note avowing the real character of the book reading To The Reader, The style and printing and general appearance of this volume have been adopted by the publishers in accordance with the design of the Author, who in this work 'personates' (sic) a lady of the seventeenth century. In 1847 Mrs. Rathbone issued a sequel under the title Some further Portions of the Diary of Lady Willoughby which do relate to her Domestic History and to the Events of the latter Years of the Reign of King Charles the First, the Protectorate, and the Revolution. The two parts were in 1848 republished together. The general excellence of Mrs. Rathbone's workmanship, when she is at her best, becomes most clearly evident if Lady Willoughby's Diary is compared with Anne Manning's Life of Mary Powell (1850), which manifestly owed its origin to the success of the earlier work, but is altogether inferior to it. In 1852 Mrs. Rathbone published the Letters of Richard Reynolds, her paternal grandfather. In 1858 she printed a short series of poems called The Strawberry Girl, with other Thoughts and Fancies in Verse. She died at Liverpool on 26 March 1878.

The film revealed Poulton to have a strident voice with a strong Cockney accent, quite at odds with the fey, winsome persona she had cultivated in her silent film appearances. She would become a notable casualty of the advent of talkies, as offers of screen work quickly dried up once her unappealing tones were revealed. Plot Working-class girl Molly (Poulton) finds a necklace and hands it in to the police. It turns out that the necklace is an extremely valuable piece belonging to Lady Devenish (Grace Lane), who is impressed by Molly's honesty and invites her to her home to present her with a substantial cash reward. Molly informs Lady Devenish that she has always longed to own her own taxi and plans to use the money to start up in the business. Unknown to Molly, the conversation has been watched and heard by Lady Devenish's son Jack (Stuart), who finds Molly extremely attractive. Posing as a chauffeur, he applies to be the driver of Molly's first taxi. She agrees to employ him and the pair gradually become romantically involved.

He is credited, along with R. Paul Butler, for discovering Gliese 581 g, the first potentially habitable planet outside of the Solar System. He is a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and is known worldwide for designing and building HIRES, a high-resolution optical spectrometer mounted permanently on the W. M. Keck Observatory 10-meter telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. HIRES is an instrument critical to observations and discoveries about the planets, stars, galaxies, and the universe. Vogt also built the Hamilton spectrometer at Lick Observatory (with which most of the first extrasolar planets were discovered). In 1987, earlier in his career, Vogt invented the technique of \\"Doppler imaging\\" for mapping the surface features of stars. Vogt is currently a member of the California- Carnegie Planet Search Team. This team is building a new telescope in the Lick Observatory, the Automated Planet Finder, expected to be the most powerful in the world for detecting extrasolar planets. It will be able to track planets moving at velocities as little as 1 meter per second (the speed of a walking man). Vogt and his team are credited with detecting a majority of the 100 planets now known. Vogt received his bachelor's degrees in Physics and Astronomy from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1972, his Master of Science degree in Astronomy from UT Austin in 1976, and Ph.D in Astronomy from UT Austin in 1978. He's been a member of the University of California Observatories (UCO) at Lick Observatory since 1978.

Biography Charles S. Schepke was born December 26, 1878 in New York City, New York and joined the United States Navy. He was stationed aboard the battleship as a gunner's mate first class. On April 13, 1904 the Missouri was engaging in target practice when one of the ships 12‚Äù gun ‚Äúflared back‚Äù. As the breech was opened for reloading, hot gases were released into the turret, causing it to catch fire. The fire spread to a bag of propellant and from there it spread down to the ammunition handling chamber. Schepke assisted in containing the fire before it spread to other areas of the ship and in putting out the blaze. The fire was eventually contained but, before it was out, 36 of the ship's crew had been killed. For his actions Schepke received the Medal of Honor on May 26, 1904. He was warranted as a gunner on February 20, 1909 and was promoted to chief gunner on January 16, 1915. During World War I he received a temporary promotion to lieutenant on July 1, 1918. In June 1921, a Brooklyn, New York judge granted alimony to Schepke's wife, Gertrude Schepke pending a separation. She was granted a $25 week stipend after she filed for divorce from Lieutenant Schepke. Schepke retired from the Navy on October 29, 1926. Lieutenant Schepke died on February 27, 1933 and is buried in Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery in Middle Village, New York. His grave can be found in map 5, lot 9365.

It is the longest operating youth baseball program in the United States. The Khoury Association is operated by an all-volunteer Board of Governors. Local leagues can structure themselves in a way that can best serve their community; the Khoury Association sets few restrictions. The Khoury Association offers programs from ages four and up in a structure that allows kids to move up in a progressive format with balls, field dimensions, etc.  History  The first Khoury league was baseball league founded by George M. Khoury in 1934. He wanted an organized baseball league for his sons that allowed them to play the game with their own age groups. As George G. Khoury Sr. later recalls in his book, Brothers, Bombshells, and Baseball, ‚ÄúDad knew many people, was a salesman and an organizer.[...] He knew how to get things done, thus one evening he decided to form his own league and the Sixteenth Ward Baseball League, with George Khoury as the sponsor, was started in St. Louis. MO.Khoury, George (2003). Brothers, Bombshells, and Baseball. Hardback Publishers. p. 20-21. .‚Äù In 1936, George M Khoury and attorney Maury Karner created the George Khoury Association of Baseball Leagues, Inc. The first Khoury Association games were played on Mother‚Äôs Day in St. Louis's Forest Park. Khoury insisted that every child be allowed to play, regardless of skill level, and adopted the motto, \\"The Khoury League Is Interested In The Child That Nobody Else Wants.George Khoury Association of Baseball Leagues Official Rulebook . (PDF). Khoury League. 2011.\\" The Khoury Association expanded rapidly after World War II, first to the areas adjacent to St. Louis, then to Illinois, Kentucky, Florida and other states. In 1958, the Khoury Association created the first organized youth girls softball league in the United States.  Program  The Khoury Association is a non-profit, nondenominational organization of affiliated circuits and leagues, using a hub system of control and administration. The International office in St. Louis serves in an administrative and advisory capacity. The Association administers anything from one four‚Äêteam league to a network of leagues within a 125‚Äêmile radius of a large town or city serving as the network hub, however, the Association is flexible enough to operate larger circuits, such as State or Regional.  Rules  The Khoury Association uses rules that are reviewed and updated annually by a rules committee with representatives from multiple local leagues. = Playing Divisions = The Khoury Association was the first national sports program to separate youth players into divisions based on age. Players graduate as a team as they progress through the program. Special rules at the Atom and Pixie levels help the younger children learn how to play baseball. These rules include no base stealing, no balks, and no infield fly . Tee ball divisions are operated and determined by the local Khoury League. Baseball *Atom I - 8 years old *Atom II - 9 years old *Bantam I - 10 years old *Bantam II - 11 years old *Midget I - 12 years old *Midget II - 13 years old *Juvenile I - 14 years old *Juvenile II / Junior - 15‚Äì18 years old *Senior - 18 years old + Softball *Pixie I - 8 years old *Pixie II - 9 years old *Petite - 10‚Äì12 years old *Chic - 12‚Äì14 years old *Intermediate - 14‚Äì18 years old *Senior - 18 years old + Most leagues have different rules and guidelines for their tee ball divisions that cater to their community's needs. Some Khoury Leagues also offer soccer, basketball, and bowling. = Field Dimensions = The Khoury Association was the first program to use smaller ball fields and balls for the younger age divisions. There are three different field dimensions for baseball and three for softball. Tee ball field dimensions are determined by the local Khoury League. = Playoffs = The Khoury Association was the first program to organize playoffs for all teams with others of equal standing in their divisions. The Association also pioneered an all-star game in a Major League Baseball park (Sportsman's Park in St. Louis) for certain divisions.  Notable Participants  = Honorary Lifetime Members = These members include sportscaster Jack Buck, sportsman Gussie Busch., William DeWitt Sr., William D. Montgomery, Joseph A. Mueller, Bill V.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"cold nose\\" for . MƒÅori first settled in the area as early as the 14th century. During the Invasion of the Waikato in 1863, the local MƒÅori had their land confiscated by the New Zealand Government as punishment for supporting the Kingitanga movement. The land was largely used for farming until late 2016 when Fletcher Building acquired the site as part of a housing development project. Fletcher's housing development project has been opposed by the MƒÅori activist group \\"Save Our Unique Landscape\\" (SOUL), which has occupied the site and staged protests since 2016. In July 2019, SOUL were evicted from the site and eleven people were subsequently arrested, sparking a much larger occupation of several hundred people at IhumƒÅtao that continues to this day. The dispute has been compared to the occupation of Bastion Point in the late 1970s in which MƒÅori protested against forced land alienation by pƒÅkehƒÅ (European settlers), including by activists who took part in that movement and support SOUL's opposition to the housing development. These events have also sparked a series of protests around New Zealand, the scale of which has been compared to the protests against the 1981 Springbok Tour. The site is located on the IhumƒÅtao Peninsula, in Mangere, at the base of the volcanic cone of ≈åtuataua, part of the Auckland volcanic field. The scoria cone reaches (210 ft) above sea level and was the site of a large MƒÅori pƒÅ (fortification). History =MƒÅori settlement= The ≈åtuataua Stonefields are part of an area known as IhumƒÅtao or Te Ihu a Mataoho (\\"The Nose of Mataoho\\"). The Stonefields feature MƒÅori stone garden mounds and MƒÅori and European dry-stone walls; the visible histories of IhumƒÅtao are interwoven with the history of Auckland, as it is possible to trace the history of human presence in Auckland from initial MƒÅori settlement to the arrival of Europeans in the 1860s with their pastoral farming techniques. Proclamation requiring MƒÅori to take an Oath of Allegiance, 9 July 1863 IhumƒÅtao was first settled by MƒÅori as early as the 14th century AD/CE. According to traditions the first settlers were the NgƒÅ Oho people. Their descendants became the Te Wai-o-Hua tribe. The papakƒÅinga (village) of IhumƒÅtao is considered the oldest settlement in Auckland. The ≈åtuataua Stonefields were part of a greater settlement of the Auckland Isthmus, which has been surveyed, mapped and investigated by archaeologists since the 1970s. It is estimated that there was once about 8000 hectares of stonefield gardens, of which the 100 hectares at ≈åtuataua is the last remaining example. Other South Auckland stonefield garden sites included Wiri, where there were 300 hectares of prehistoric agricultural activity involving about 120 hectares of arable land growing kumara, taro and gourds, and Matukut≈´reia (McLaughlins Mountain) which has been destroyed by quarrying. In the early 1980s a survey of South Auckland stone structures examined Ambury Park (Mangere Mountain), West Mangere (≈åtuataua), Wiri, McLaughlins Mountain (Matukut≈´reia), East Tamaki and Brown's Island (Motukorea). The West Mangere area included Puketutu, Pukeiti, ≈åtuataua and Maungataketake (Elletts Mountain). The assessment of the ≈åtuataua stone fields was made from previous archaeological fieldwork and aerial photos as access to the land was not permitted at that time. The Pukeiti and ≈åtuataua fields were possibly used due to their coastal location and compact size, however the coastal environment would prove difficult access and require excessive work due to the heavy mud deposits and shallow tide conditions. At ≈åtuataua there were many different structure types and other evidence of settlement: * mounds of different shapes suggesting different cultigens and purposes * walls and alignments indicating garden boundaries, planting bases and support for vines, and demarcation walls * enclosures including demarcation of habitation areas. The size of enclosures ranged from 3M x 3M to 8M x 10M. * middens * stone facing on terraces * fish traps The stonefield gardens show that the pre-European MƒÅori had a sophisticated understanding of their environment by utilising the stones on the volcanic fields to build structures and walls and modifying that environment to nurture and grow crops which were not suited to a cooler climate. =Crown acquisition and land contestation= MƒÅori of IhumƒÅtao and Pukaki refuse to take the oath of allegiance, 11 July 1863 Tribal land was cleared in 1863, and then confiscated by Governor Grey in 1865 after local MƒÅori supported the MƒÅori King Movement (Kƒ´ngitanga) during the Waikato War. In 1867, the New Zealand Government acquired IhumƒÅtao through a land grant. The land known as Oruarangi Block was farmed by the Wallace family for 150 years, who sold it to Fletcher Building in 2017 for a planned subdivision. The Manukau City Council attempted to preserve the land as part of the ≈åtuataua Stonefields Historic Reserve in 2009, however this was later overruled on appeal by the Environment Court. In 2014, the New Zealand Government and Auckland Council designated 32 hectares adjacent to the ≈åtuataua Stonefields Historic Reserve as a Special Housing Area (SHA). This was met by opposition by a MƒÅori activist group led by University of Auckland law graduate Pania Newton called \\"Save Our Unique Landscape\\" (SOUL), who opposed the proposed development due to IhumƒÅtao's historical significance. SOUL staged protests and erected a whare and pou whenua on IhumƒÅtao Quarry Road. In 2016, the \\"Wallace Block\\" on IhumƒÅtao was sold to Fletcher Housing, a subsidiary of Fletcher Building, which has plans to build 480 houses on the land. Archaeologist Dave Veart has described the planned Fletcher development as \\"like building houses on the fields alongside Stonehenge.\\" The Green Party announced its support for the preservation of IhumƒÅtao in 2015. =Protest action and occupation= On 23 July 2019 Police moved in on people protesting the takeover of ancestral land by commercial company Fletchers, who are building a housing development there In response to Fletcher Building's planned housing development on the Oruarangi Bloc, the protest group SOUL led by Pania Newton set up camp beside IhumƒÅtao Quarry Road on 4 November 2016. This camp, which became known as Kaitiaki Village, numbered twenty individuals with participants sleeping in caravans, sheds, tents, and an empty boat. SOUL has contended that the land was taken by proclamation during the Waikato War in 1863 and that its confiscation under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 breaches the Treaty of Waitangi. In 2017, SOUL appealed to the United Nations, which recommended that the designation of IhumƒÅtao as a Special Housing Area be reviewed by the Government to 'evaluate its conformity with the Treaty of Waitangi, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other relevant international standards' and that 'the free and informed consent of MƒÅori is obtained before approving any project affecting the use and development of their traditional land and resources.' In 2018, SOUL appealed to the Environment Court who declined to overturn the permission granted to Fletcher Building to build houses in Mangere. In March 2019, SOUL and their supporters in Wellington submitted a petition to the New Zealand Parliament demanding government intervention to prevent a confrontation on IhumƒÅtao. In April 2019, SOUL also delivered a 20,000 signature petition to the Mayor of Auckland Phil Goff, calling on the Auckland Council and Government to protect the land. IhumƒÅtao Peninsula with boundaries highlighting the historic reserve and housing development area According to media reports, the Ihumatao housing development dispute is characterised by a generational divide within the local MƒÅori iwi Te Kawerau ƒÅ Maki. While younger members of the tribe including Pania Newton and her cousins are opposed to the housing development and seek the return of IhumƒÅtao to their iwi, tribal elders including Te Warena Taua support the housing development and regard Newton and her cousins' actions as disrespectful. The iwi's leadership body, the Te Kawerau Iwi Tribal Authority & Settlement Trust, have supported the housing development, stating that they had negotiated an agreement with Fletcher and Makaurau Marae MƒÅori Trust for the land to be returned to \\"mana whenua {power associated with possession and occupation of tribal land}.\\" Fletcher Housing has announced that they are committed to returning 25% of the land (roughly eight hectares) to the Kingitanga. On 23 July 2019, SOUL were served an eviction notice in the Oruarangi Block, and five people were subsequently arrested. Another person was arrested after climbing on a vehicle to prevent it entering the blockaded area. On 25 July Amnesty International sent human rights observers to the site to document the human rights situation and ensure the rights of protestors were respected. Solidarity protests were held outside Parliament in Wellington on 24 July and Dunedin on 26 July. Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson and MPs Chl√∂e Swarbrick and Golriz Ghahraman supported the protestors, but Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the Government would not intervene. On 25 July 2019, seven supporters of the occupation were arrested after blocking traffic on a road leading out of Auckland Airport to call attention to the situation at IhumƒÅtao. =Crown intervention and mediation= The MƒÅori King Kƒ´ngi T≈´heitia has called for the return of IhumƒÅtao to mana whenua On 26 July 2019, Prime Minister Ardern backtracked on her earlier announcement and announced that no further building would take place at IhumƒÅtao while the Government and other parties negotiate a peaceful solution to the dispute. On 3 August 2019, Kƒ´ngi T≈´heitia, the MƒÅori King, visited IhumƒÅtao with a contingent of over 400 and listened to mana whenua and supporters. Views and history were shared, and an account was given of P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero, first MƒÅori King, receiving his title at IhumƒÅtao. A Kƒ´ngitanga flag was also raised to fly until a resolution is reached. Just hours after T≈´heitia's visit, footage of two armed police officers carrying rifles around IhumƒÅtao caused considerable alarm to protestors and supporters, and led to calls for guns to be removed from the site. On 4 August 2019, SOUL protestors and supporters held a hikoi to the maunga Puketapapakanga a Hape and back to the camp site through the fenced-off area of Kaitiaki Village, the site of SOUL's original occupation. At the same time, protestors pushed the police's frontline about 50 metres down IhumƒÅtao Quarry Road from its original location at the intersection with Oruarangi Road, and moved tents into fields that had previously been blocked off by police. As the hikoi passed through Kaitiaki Village, Organise Aotearoa members who had joined the occupation spoke with First Security workers hired by Fletcher Building, discovering ‚Äì and later publicising ‚Äì that for two weeks, the security guards, mostly recent migrants and students, had been sleeping in a milking station with broken windows on scavenged mattresses from Kaitiaki Village, where temperatures regularly drop below 5 degrees Celsius at night, without access to electricity, safe drinking water, or the meals they had been promised by First Security. On the night of 5 August 2019, there were reports of clashes between protesters and Police. Protesters accused the police of using kettling tactics and unreasonable force while Police claimed that protesters had attempted to breach the cordon around the disputed land. The next day, SOUL protesters and supporters staged a protest outside the Fletcher Building headquarters in Penrose in Auckland, as part of a national day of action that had been planned before the clashes of the previous night took place. Similar protests were held in Whangarei, Hamilton, Hastings, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin. In early August 2019, Opposition Leader Simon Bridges called on the protesters to \\"return home\\" and criticised Prime Minister Ardern for halting construction. Earlier, Mana Movement leader and MƒÅori activist Hone Harawira denounced the police as \\"pigs\\" in a Facebook post. In response to Bridges' remarks, Ardern reiterated the Government's commitment to finding a solution to the IhumƒÅtao dispute. On 22 August, about 150 protesters marched from IhumƒÅtao to Prime Minister Ardern's electorate office in Mount Albert calling on her to visit the site. On the same day, a group of students including Youth MPs were expelled from Parliament for a year after disrupting parliamentary proceedings by singing the MƒÅori song Tutira Mai Nga Iwi while holding up the Tino Rangatiratanga flag to draw attention to the hikoi. On 18 September 2019, the MƒÅori King T≈´heitia Paki announced that mana whenua wanted the return of the land. He called on the Government to negotiate with Fletchers for the return of the land to its rightful owners. The MƒÅori Party also issued press release supporting the mana whenua of IhumƒÅtao and calling on Prime Minister Ardern and the Crown to reach a solution with the mana whenua. In response to media coverage, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters claimed that the SOUL protesters had little authority among the MƒÅori community. On 19 September, National MP Andrew Bayly was ejected from Parliament for attempting to disrupt Parliamentary proceedings by asking several questions about the implications of the IhumƒÅtao dispute for treaty settlements nationally. In mid September 2019, Acting Prime Minister Winston Peters stated that Finance Minister Grant Robertson had entered into meaningful discussions with Fletcher on how to deal with the disputed land. In mid October, members of the SOUL group complained that they had been left out of talks between Fletcher and the Government. In early November 2019, the Crown heritage entity Heritage New Zealand announced that it was considering raising the heritage status of the ≈åtuataua Stonefields reserve and the IhumƒÅtao reserve to Category 1, the highest category ranking. Heritage NZ however stated that they would not change the consent for Fletcher Housing development. In mid November, it was reported the Government was considering loaning the Auckland Council NZ$40 million to purchase the IhumƒÅtao land from Fletcher Building. This announcement was met by criticism from elements of the MƒÅori community, who reiterated their calls for the return of IhumƒÅtao. In late November 2019, Fletcher Housing chair Bruce Hassall defended the company's handling of the IhumƒÅtao dispute, claiming that the company had bought the land in good faith, consulted with iwi groups, and followed proper land procedures. On 21 January 2020, Pania Newton, the leader of the SOUL group, issued a statement to the media that they were close to completing a deal on the disputed land at IhumƒÅtao. Fletcher Building also stated that discussions on the future of the site were \\"progressing.\\" Fletcher also removed fencing and restored a road to the maunga. On 23 June, Radio New Zealand reported that the Government was considering making a decision to purchase IhumƒÅtao under the Housing Act. IhumƒÅtao protest site: The land in the photo is the subject of the protest. The protest campsite is in the distance and centre.  ≈åtuataua  Forest remnant and dry-stone wall on ≈åtuataua's lava field The volcanic cone of ≈åtuataua is sited within the ≈åtuataua Stonefields Historic Reserve and as the dominant landscape feature, lends the 100 hectare reserve its name. The cone provided a fortified village to the original inhabitants, with the lower slopes of the volcano supporting intensive MƒÅori gardening. The volcanic soils extend all the way to the shoreline where there was access to the abundance of the Manukau Harbour. The sandy beaches and wide tidal flats were once rich with shellfish and the harbour provided fish and a regionally important shark fishery. The ≈åtuataua cone was quarried in the 1950s, and the scoria used for building work ‚Äì including the building of Auckland Airport. At the completion of quarrying, remedial reconstruction created a shallow, grassy crater. Adjacent to ≈åtuataua in the ≈åtuataua Stonefields Historic Reserve lies Pukeiti (literally \\"small hill\\"), Auckland's smallest volcano.

Achan pillaged gold, silver, and a costly garment from Jericho, and was punished by stoning. Herem or cherem (Hebrew: ◊ó◊®◊ù, ·∏•ƒìrem), as used in the Tanakh, means 'devote' or 'destroy'. It is also referred to as the ban. The term has been explained in different ways by scholars. It has been defined as \\"a mode of secluding, and rendering harmless, anything imperilling the religious life of the nation\\",S.R. Driver (1896), A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Deuteronomy. Second Edition. T&T; Clark: p. 98. or \\"the total destruction of the enemy and his goods at the conclusion of a campaign\\",J. Soggin, Joshua (London, SCM 1972) 97. or \\"uncompromising consecration of property and dedication of the property to God without possibility of recall or redemption\\".  Etymology  The word comes from the semitic root H-R-M. In the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh the verb form occurs 51 times, while the noun occurs 28 times.Leon J. Wood, \\"◊ó◊®◊ù,\\" in Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament (Chicago: Moody, 1980), 324-325. Although the word itself simply means devotion to God (and is used this way in Leviticus 27:28), it most often refers to \\"a ban for utter destruction\\". There is also a homonym, herem, meaning fisherman's net, which occurs 9 times in the masoretic text and is regarded as etymologically unrelated, according to the Brown Driver Briggs Lexicon. = English translation = The term is translated in a variety of ways in English translations:  Sources  The word is often used in the Book of Joshua, where cities such as Jericho and Ai came under herem. This meant they had to be completely destroyed, except for \\"the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron\\" which were to go into \\"YHWH's treasury\\" (Joshua 6:19). The following chapter describes how Achan pillaged an ingot of gold, a quantity of silver, and a costly garment for himself, and was executed by stoning.Israel Drazin, (2009) Maimonides and the Biblical Prophets. Gefen Publishing House, Jerusalem: p.64. Deuteronomy 20 also names six people groups who were to be under the ban: the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. This has led to the conquest of Canaan being referred to as genocide. For example, Ra'anan Boustan calls this \\"a thoroughly violent commandment\\" which \\"in modern terms would be characterized as genocide.\\"Ra'anan S. Boustan, Violence, Scripture, and Textual Practice in Early Judaism and Christianity, (Brill, 2010), 3-5. Gustave Dor√©, The Death of Agag. Agag was executed by Samuel as part of God's command to put the Amalekites under herem (1 Samuel 15). In Judges Chapters 19-21 the town of Jabesh-Gilead was put under Herem for not joining in battle against the Tribe of Benjamin. King Saul put the priestly town of Nob under Herem nearly wiping out the priestly House of Eli The concept of herem also appears in 1 Samuel 15, where Saul \\"totally destroyed\\" (verse 8, NIV) the Amalekites with the sword, but spared their king, Agag, and kept \\"the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs‚Äîeverything that was good.\\" For this, Saul is rebuked by Samuel, who reminds him that God had commanded him to \\"completely destroy\\" the Amalekites (verse 15). Samuel \\"hacked Agag to pieces\\" himself (verse 33, ESV). Most scholars conclude that the biblical accounts of extermination are exaggerated, fictional, or metaphorical. In the archaeological community, the Battle of Jericho is very thoroughly studied, and the consensus of modern scholars is that the story of battle and the associated extermination are a pious fiction and did not happen as described in the Book of Joshua. For example, midrash on the Book of Joshua arguably describes the extermination of the Canaanite tribes, yet and both suggest that the extermination was not complete. The word herem is the last word of the prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible: \\"...lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction\\" (Malachi 4:6, ESV).  Meaning and significance  William Dumbrell suggests that \\"the ban appears to have been conceived as an acknowledgment of Yahweh's help.\\"William J. Dumbrell, The Faith of Israel (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2002), 66. He also notes that \\"everything likely to contaminate Israel religiously\\" was destroyed, and thus the institution of the ban was \\"designed not to counter a military threat but to counter a religious threat.\\"Dumbrell, The Faith of Israel, 73. Similarly, Balchin argues that \\"drastic action was required to keep Israel in holy existence.\\"J. A. Balchin, \\"War,\\" in The New Bible Dictionary (London: IVF, 1963) 1316. Lilley argues that \\"Israel, like other contemporary societies, did not recognise any distinction between sacred and secular war,\\" and that \\"holy war\\" is not a biblical term, \\"but one invented or at least appropriated by commentators.\\"J. P. U. Lilley, \\"Understanding the herem,\\" Tyndale Bulletin 44 [1993] 171-173. Lilley goes on to suggest that essence of the idea of herem is an \\"irrevocable renunciation of any interest\\" in the object 'devoted', and thus \\"so far as persons are concerned, the options of enslavement and treaty are not available.\\" He contests the idea that it always involved things imperilling the religious life of the nation, arguing that these things \\"were to be destroyed out of hand, not given to the sanctuary.\\"Lilley, \\"Understanding the herem,\\" 176-177. Longman and Reid suggest that we should see herem as a \\"sacrifice of the occupants of Canaan in the interest of securing the purity of the land.\\"Tremper Longman III and Daniel G. Reid, God is a Warrior (Grand Rapids, Zondervan, 1995), 131. The concept of herem was not unique to Israel. The Mesha Stele contains a statement by King Mesha of Moab that he captured the town of Nebo and killed all seven thousand people there, \\"for I had devoted them to destruction for (the god) Ashtar-Chemosh.\\"James B. Pritchard (ed.), Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (3rd ed., 1969), 320.  Ethical issues  Theologians and other scholars have commented on the ethical and moral dilemmas posed by the wars of extermination, particularly the killing of women and children.For an early example, see: Horne, Thomas Hartwell, An introduction to the critical study and knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, Volume 2, T. Cadell, 1828, pp 523-525 Maimonides applies the rules from Deuteronomy 20:10 (the rules governing discretionary wars) to the war on the Canaanite nation, and suggests that the commandment to exterminate the Canaanites was not absolute. He writes that Joshua gave the Canaanites three options: to flee, to remain and make peace with the Israelites, or to fight.Drazin, Israel, Maimonides and the Biblical Prophets, Gefen Publishing House Ltd, 2009 p 79 Rabbi Gunther Plaut asserted that the Torah, itself, never addresses the morality of the wars of extermination.Erhlich, p 118 :\\"In his Torah commentary Plaut (1981) grapples with the 'morality of conquest' only to conclude that 'the morality of the forcible displacement of the Canaanites was never raised by the Torah, and neither was the morality of war as such'. (quoting Plaut, W. Gunther, The Torah: A Modern Commentary, 1981, (p 991 in 2005 edition)) Biblical scholar Sidney Hoenig discussed the \\"brutality\\" in the book of Joshua, but concluded that the \\"battle is only in honor of God\\".Erhlich, p 118: \\"Sidney Hoenig is one of the few relatively modern commentators ‚Ä¶ who has raised the issue of violence in respect to Joshua, only to justify it as a divinely ordained holy war‚Ä¶.\\" [quoting Hoenig:] \\"Sensitive readers are concerned about the brutality shown in Joshua, but one should not forget that it is a story of a war - of a holy war. The theme is the obliteration of historically hated pagans and the battle is only in honor of God\\". (Quoting Hoenig, Sidney, The Book of Joshua: A New English Translation of the Text and Rashi with a Commentary Digest. Judaica Press, 1969. Chapter VIII; in Hebrew; translated into English in 1984). The Mennonite scholar John Howard Yoder suggests that the concept of herem was unique in relation to the morality of the time not in its violence, but in ensuring that \\"war does not become a source of immediate enrichment through plunder\\",John Howard Yoder, \\"If Abraham Is Our Father,\\" in The Original Revolution: Essays on Christian Pacifism (Wipf and Stock, 1971). and hence was the beginning of a trajectory that would lead ultimately to the teaching of nonviolence. Scholars Ian Lustick and Leonard B. Glick quote Shlomo Aviner as saying \\"from the point of view of mankind's humanistic morality we were in the wrong in [taking the land] from the Canaanites. There is only one catch. The command of God ordered us to be the people of the Land of Israel\\".Lustick, p 76. Quoting Shlomo Aviner, Messianic Realism, pp 115-116 Scholar Carl Ehrlich states that Jewish commentators have tended to be silent regarding the morality of the violence in the Book of Joshua.Ehrlich, Carl S., \\"Joshua, Judaism, and Genocide\\" in Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century, BRILL, 1999, p 117: :\\"It thus behooves us to ask ‚Ä¶ how has the Jewish community dealt with these foundational narratives, saturated as they are with acts of violence against others?‚Ä¶. The question of how to deal with traditional texts that advocate violence against human beings who are different from the in-group writing the text, be they foreigners, women, homosexuals, etc, is one that motivates many of the modern struggles with the textual corpus of inherited tradition‚Ä¶. Among Jewish commentators ‚Ä¶ the disturbing nature of Joshua has for the most part been passed over in silence‚Ä¶. Prominent atheist Richard Dawkins asserted that the commandments to exterminate are immoral.Dawkins, Richard, The God Delusion, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008, p 281 Some scholars claim that collective punishment, particularly punishment of descendants for transgressions committed by ancestors, is common in the Hebrew Bible‚Äîa view based primarily on repeated descriptions (with slightly varied wording) of God as \\"a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation . . . but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments.\\"Kra≈°ovec, Jo≈æe, Reward, punishment, and forgiveness: the thinking and beliefs of ancient Israel in the light of Greek and modern views, Brill, 1999, p 113. He cites the following examples of collective punishment (of descendants) in the Bible: ::Ex 20:5 - \\"You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments.\\" ::Deut 5:9-10 ::Exodus 34:6-7: \\"And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, \\"The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, 7 maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.\\" ::Deuteronomy 7:9-10 - \\"Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands. 10 But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction; he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.\\" ::Jeremiah 32:18 - \\" You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers' sins into the laps of their children after them. O great and powerful God, whose name is the LORD Almighty\\" = As genocide = Several scholars and commentators have characterized the wars of extermination as genocide.Kravitz, Leonard, \\"What is Crime?\\", in Crime and punishment in Jewish law: essays and responsa, Editors Walter Jacob, Moshe Zemer Berghahn Books, 1999, p 31: :\\"Sin has changed [since biblical times]; crime has changed. We bring a different sensibility to our reading of the sacred texts of the past, even the Torah. There are passages in it which to our modern minds command crimes, the kind of crimes which our age would call 'crimes against humanity' ‚Ä¶ I think of the problematic section in the Mattot [Numbers 31] which contains the commandment to exact revenge against the Midianites by slaying every male and every female old enough to engage in sexual intercourse‚Ä¶. I used to think that were they [Midianites] suddenly to appear, no Jew would be willing to carry out such a commandment. Then Baruch Goldstein appeared on the scene, and he was followed by Yigal Amir and now I am not sure‚Ä¶. I find the commandment to commit genocide against the Midianite unacceptable. To accept the commandment to do the same to 'the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Peruzzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites' seems to me to make permissible the Holocaust, the attempted genocide of the Jewish people.\\"Shaul Magid, \\"Subversion as Return: Scripture, Dissent, and Renewal in Contemporary Judaism, in Subverting Scriptures: Critical Reflections on the Use of the Bible Beth Hawkins Benedix (Ed), pp 217-236; quote from p 234: :\\"The rabbinic tradition connects the commandment to destroy Midian in Numbers 31 to Genesis 37:36, ‚Ä¶ Thus Moses's call for 'revenge' killing here has a long history‚Ä¶.

Moreover, this depiction provides a rationale for the genocide of the Canaanites commanded in Deuteronomy (Deut 7:1-2) and purportedly accomplished by Joshua (Josh 10:40).\\"Boustan, Ra'anan S., Violence, Scripture, and Textual Practice in Early Judaism and Christianity, BRILL, 2010, pp 3-5 \\"The specific focus in this volume is violence and Scripture. Violence can be found throughout the pages of the Hebrew Bible‚Ä¶ The Israelite God is portrayed as a divine warrior (Ex. 15:3); the Israelites themselves are commanded to obliterate the inhabitants of Canaan and are often presented as engaging in such holy wars; ‚Ä¶ Instigators of religious violence believe that they are carrying out God's directive as articulated in the Bible‚Ä¶. For example, the Deuteronomic directive to destroy entirely (herem) the Canaanites (Deut 20:15-18) is a thoroughly violent commandment - and in modern terms would be characterized as genocide. The later historical absence of any Canaanites, however, does not blunt this passage's violent legacy\\".Ehrlich, Carl S., \\"Joshua, Judaism, and Genocide\\" in Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century, BRILL, 1999, pp 121‚Äì122: :p 121: \\"The broad consensus of Jewish tradition has been that the conquest of the land [ancient Israel] belongs to the distant past. In this manner, any discomfort with the anachronistic notion of genocide to be found in the Joshua narrative could be passed off as something that belonged to a certain time and place, not to be repeated. The restrictions on the waging of war in Maimonides and his biblical and rabbinical sources would seem to support this contention\\" :p 122: \\"It was particularly in the field of archaeology that the ideological battle about [the historicity of] Joshua was waged. It was felt that proving the veracity of the book of Joshua would in some way prove to be a justification of modern historical reality.

There is a specific kind of warfare laid down in the Bible which we can only call genocide.\\" = Justifications and rationalizations = The Midianites Are Routed by Gustave Dore Several justifications and explanations for the extreme violence associated with the wars of extermination have been offered, some found in the Hebrew Bible, others provided by Rabbinic commentators, and others hypothesized by scholars. One interpretation is that the Canaanites were sinful, depraved people, and their deaths were punishments (). In God tells the Israelites to exterminate the Canaanite nations, \\"otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the lord your God\\". Another reason, justifying the war against the Midianites, was revenge for Midian's role in Israel's apostate behavior during the Heresy of Peor ().Walvoord, John F., The Bible Knowledge Commentary: Old Testament, David C. Cook, 1985, pp 250-251 A third rationalisation for the genocide is to make room for the returning Israelites, who are entitled to exclusive occupation of the land of Canaan: the Canaanite nations were living in the land of Israel, but when the Israelites returned, the Canaanites were expected to leave the land. In Talmudic commentary, the Canaanite nations were given the opportunity to leave, and their refusal to leave \\"lay the onus of blame for the conquest and Joshua's extirpation of the Canaanites at the feet of the victims.\\" * See * Ehrlich, Carl S., \\"Joshua, Judaism, and Genocide\\" in Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century, BRILL, 1999, pp 119-120: \\"At least some of the Rabbis asked themselves ‚Ä¶ what had they [Canaanites] done to deserve this punishment?.. In essence, the solution was to lay the onus of blame for the conquest and Joshua's extirpation of the Canaanites at the feet of the victims. [Describes a Talmudic narrative that says that Joshua sent a message to Canaanites before the war, telling them to leave or else] .. In this manner this midrash makes the Canaanites responsible for their own demise. They were not innocent victims, but elected of their own free will to attempt to contravene the divine promise of land to Israel. The conscience of Joshua, and of his descendants, was clean‚Ä¶.\\" Another explanation of the exterminations is that God gave the land to the Canaanites only temporarily, until the Israelites would arrive, and the Canaanites extermination was punishment for their refusal to obey God's desire that they leave.Ehrlich, Carl S., \\"Joshua, Judaism, and Genocide\\" in Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century, BRILL, 1999, p 120: \\"The Canaanites were given the land of Israel to care for until the time .. the Israelites .. would arrive‚Ä¶. Joshua and the Israelites were forced against their will to wage war upon the Canaanites, who, contravening God, would not even cede an inch of land without a fight to the finish. This midrash also attempts to justify the fury and brutality of Joshua's holy war against the Canaanites‚Ä¶. Another Talmudic explanation - for the wars in the Book of Joshua - was that God initiated the wars as a diversionary tactic so Israelites would not kill Joshua after discovering that Joshua had forgotten certain laws.Ehrlich, Carl S., \\"Joshua, Judaism, and Genocide\\" in Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century, BRILL, 1999, p 120: \\"That not all Rabbis shared these feelings of ethical ambivalence about their ancestor's alleged genocidal war against the Canaanites is indicated by another midrash ‚Ä¶ [Joshua forgot some laws so] the Israelites were so outraged at his lack of learning that they wanted to kill him. Since there was no time to reteach him all that he had forgotten, the only way in which God could save Joshua was by diverting the attention of the people through a war. Thus the war of extermination against the Canaanites was begun earlier than planned as a diversionary tactic to save the life of one individual. It would appear that the author of this midrash was not all too concerned about the ethical implications of a God who sees nothing wrong with wiping out a whole nation just to save the life of a man whose life is threatened ‚Ä¶ \\" Some scholars trace the extermination of the Midianites to revenge for the fact that Midianites were responsible for selling Joseph into slavery in Egypt ().Magid, Shaul, \\"Subversion as Return: Scripture, Dissent, and Renewal in Contemporary Judaism, in Subverting Scriptures: Critical Reflections on the Use of the Bible Beth Hawkins Benedix (Ed), p 234: :\\"The rabbinic tradition connects the commandment to destroy Midian in Numbers 31 to Genesis 37:28-36, ‚Ä¶ (Midianites sold Joseph into Egyptian slavery) \\"Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.\\"  Association with violent attitudes in the modern era  Some analysts have associated the biblical commandments of extermination with violent attitudes in modern era. According to Ian Lustick, in the 1980s, leaders of the now defunct Israeli messianic and political movement Gush Emunim, such as Hanan Porat, considered the Palestinians to be like Canaanites or Amalekites, and suggested that implied a duty to make merciless war against Arabs who reject Jewish sovereignty.Lustick, Ian, For the land and the Lord: Jewish fundamentalism in Israel, Council on Foreign Relations, 1988. : Lustick, p 3: \\"The fear and uncertainty that this demographic shift [increasing Arab population within Israel] is generating within the Jewish population as a whole make more attractive fundamentalist appeals to use Joshua's destruction and subjugation of the Canaanites as a model for solving the contemporary 'Arab problem'‚Ä¶. \\" : Lustick: p 78:\\" The image of Palestinians as doomed and suicidal in their opposition to Jewish rule in the Land of Israel corresponds to a more fundamental categorization of them. Gush rabbis and ideologues regularly refer to the local Arabs as 'Canaanites' ‚Ä¶ Thus Rav Tzvi Yehuda cited Maimonides to the effect that Canaanites had three choices - to flee, to accept Jewish rule, or to fight. These are the choices both [fundamentalists] suggest, that frame the appropriate attitude for Jews to take towards Palestinian Arabs. Of course, the decision by most Canaanites to fight ensured their destruction. The same fate awaits present-day non-Jewish inhabitants of the land who choose to resist the establishment of Jewish sovereignty over its entirety‚Ä¶. Humane treatment is appropriate, [Hanan] Porat emphasizes 'only for those Arabs ready to accept the sovereignty of the people of Israel'. From this general principle he infers a duty to make merciless war against Arabs in the Land of Israel who reject Jewish sovereignty and the specific requirement to deport the families of Arab juveniles who throw stones at the passing automobiles of Jewish settlers.\\" :Lustick: p 131: \\"No evidence exists of concrete plans to carry out genocidal policies towards the 'Arabs of the Land of Israel'. Nevertheless, analysis of the range of disagreement within the Jewish fundamentalist movement over the Arab question must begin with the fact that a number of rabbis supportive of Gush Emunim have offered opinions that could provide the halachic basis for such policies. The substance of these opinions pertains to the identification of the Palestinian Arabs, or Arabs in general, as Amalekites. According to the biblical account, the Amalekites harassed the Israelites ‚Ä¶ As a consequence, God commanded the Jewish people not only to kill all Amalekites - men, women, and children - but to 'blot out the memory of Amalek' from the face of the earth. Traditionally, great enemies of the Jews, such as Haman in ancient Persia ‚Ä¶ and Torquemada during the Spanish Inquisition, have been identified as descendants of Amalek. Accordingly, the most extreme views within Gush Emunim on the Arab question, views quoted extensively by Israeli critics of the movement, speak of Arabs as descendants of the Amalekites‚Ä¶ A Gush veteran, Haim Tsuria, defended [violence towards Arabs]: 'In every generation there is an Amalek. In our generation, our Amalek are the Arabs who oppose the renewal of our national existence in the land of our fathers.\\" Atheist commentator Christopher Hitchens discusses the association of the \\"obliterated\\" tribes with modern troubles in Palestine.Hitchens, Christopher, God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything, Random House, Inc., 2007, p 101 Biblical scholar Niels Peter Lemche asserts that European colonialism in the nineteenth century was ideologically based on the biblical narratives of conquest and extermination. He also states that European Jews who migrated to Palestine relied on the biblical ideology of conquest and extermination, and considered the Arabs to be Canaanites.Lemche, Niels Peter, The Old Testament between theology and history: a critical survey, Westminster John Knox Press, 2008, pp 315‚Äì316: :\\"The [Biblical] story of the 'morally supreme people' that defeats and exterminates another, inferior, nation was part of the ideological baggage of European imperialists and colonizers throughout the nineteenth century. It was also carried by European Jews who,.. migrated to Palestine to inherit their ancestral country ‚Ä¶ In this modern version of the biblical narrative, the Palestinian population turned into 'Canaanites', supposed to be morally inferior to the Jews, and of course the Arabs were never considered their equals ‚Ä¶ The Bible was the instrument used to suppress the enemy\\". Scholar Arthur Grenke claims that the view of war expressed in Deuteronomy contributed to the destruction of Native Americans and to the destruction of European Jewry.Grenke, Arthur, God, greed, and genocide: the Holocaust through the centuries, New Academia Publishing, LLC, 2005, pp 17-18: :\\"Discussing the influence of Christian beliefs on the destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas, Stannard argues that while the New Testament view of war is ambiguous, there is little such ambiguity in the Old Testament. He points to sections in Deuteronomy in which the Israelite God, Yahweh, commanded that the Israelites utterly destroy idolaters whose land they sought to reserve for the worship of their deity (Deut 7:2, 16, and 20:16-17). ‚Ä¶ According to Stannard, this view of war contributed to the .. destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas. It was this view that also led to the destruction of European Jewry. Accordingly, it is important to look at this particular segment of the Old Testament: it not only describes a situation where a group undertakes to totally destroy other groups, but it also had a major influence on shaping thought and belief systems that permitted, and even inspired, genocide.\\" Nur Masalha, a Palestinian writer and academic, writes that the \\"genocide\\" of the extermination commandments has been \\"kept before subsequent generations\\" and served as inspirational examples of divine support for slaughtering enemies. *Masalha, Nur, The Bible and Zionism: invented traditions, archaeology and post-colonialism in Palestine-Israel, Volume 1, Zed Books, 2007, pp 273-276: :\\"[Michael] Prior revisits the old ground [in his book The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique] ‚Ä¶ First, the biblical narrative, with its 'divine promise' was inherently linked with the mandate to ethnically cleanse or exterminate the indigenous people ‚Ä¶ third, in the narrative of the Book of Deuteronomy the divine command to commit 'genocide' is explicit. Fourth, genocide and mass slaughter follow in the Book of Joshua. These highly dubious traditions of the Bible have been kept before subsequent generations of Jews and Christians in their prayers‚Ä¶. The historical evidence, however, strongly suggests that such genocidal massacres never actually took place, although these racist, xenophobic and militaristic narratives remained for later generations as powerful examples of divine aid in battle and of a divine command for widespread slaughter of an enemy‚Ä¶. [Professor Bernardo Gandulla, of the University of Buenos Aires], while sharing Prior's critique of the perverse use that Zionism and the State of Israel have made of the Bible to support their 'ethnic cleansing' policies in Palestine, ‚Ä¶ Prior ‚Ä¶ found incitement to war and violence in the very foundation documents of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In the Hebrew Bible, for instance, there is a dominant strand that sees God as ethnocentric and militaristic. Furthermore, in their conquest of Canaan, the Israelites are commanded by Yahweh to destroy the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine. Later in the days of the Israelite kingdoms, they are urged to show no pity, but to massacre their enemies‚Ä¶. Today, both Christian Zionists in the West and Israeli messianics continue to refer to the Hebrew Scriptures for archetypal conflicts, which guide their attitudes towards the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine: the Palestinian Muslims and Christians.\\" *Masalha refers to: Prior, Michael P. The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique, Sheffield Academic Press, 1997. Ra'anan S. Boustan, an Associate Professor of ancient Mediterranean religions at UCLA, said that militant Zionists have identified modern Palestinians with Canaanites, and hence as targets of violence mandated in Deut 20:15-18.Boustan, Ra'anan S., Violence, Scripture, and Textual Practice in Early Judaism and Christianity, BRILL, 2010, pages 4-5 :\\"Later readers of the Bible dramatically transformed this divine directive [Deut 20:15-18] through hermeneutic alignment of the Canaanites with the current detested 'other'. Thus the Canaanites have been identified with ‚Ä¶ Palestinians (by militant Zionists), and scores of other 'enemies' of Israel. In doing so, the violence perpetrated against these groups is not only justified, but indeed, part and parcel of the original divine plan. The violent legacy of the Bible is a product of both its own violent narrative and the hermeneutics of violence applied to it\\". Scholar Leonard B. Glick states that Jewish fundamentalists in Israel, such as Shlomo Aviner, consider the Palestinians to be like biblical Canaanites, and that some fundamentalist leaders suggest that they \\"must be prepared to destroy\\" the Palestinians if the Palestinians do not leave the land.Glick, Leonard B., \\"Religion and Genocide\\", in The Widening circle of genocide, Alan L. Berger (Ed). Transaction Publishers, 1994, p 46: :\\"[God] looked with favor on what we may fairly call their [Israelite] proto-genocidal destructiveness. The Book of Joshua provides us with one of the earliest texts in which a deity quite plainly promotes the destruction of a people. As the Hebrews, under Joshua's leadership, undertake the conquest of Canaan, they massacre everyone who stands in their way‚Ä¶. It is instructive (and distressing) to note that contemporary Jewish ultra-nationalists in Israel root their politics in the Book of Joshua and equate their territorial aspirations with the will of God. Here, for example, is Shlomo Aviner, a prominent theorist of the Gush Emunim ‚Ä¶ movement: 'from the point of view of mankind's humanistic morality we were in the wrong in (taking the land) from the Canaanites. There is only one catch. The command of God ordered us to be the people of the land of Israel'.

It thus behooves us to ask ‚Ä¶ how has the Jewish community dealt with these foundational narratives, saturated as they are with acts of violence against others?‚Ä¶.\\"  Contrary views  Wars of extermination are of historical interest only, and do not serve as a model within Judaism. A formal declaration that the ‚Äúseven nations‚Äù are no longer identifiable was made by Joshua ben Hananiah, around the year 100 CE.Judaism and the ethics of war, Norman Solomon. International Review of the Red Cross. Volume 87 Number 858 June 2005 Scholar Moshe Greenberg asserts that the laws of extermination applied only to the extinct tribes, and only to their contemporary generations of Israelites.Greenberg, Moshe, \\"On the Political User of the Bible in Modern Israel: An Engaged Critique\\", in Pomegranates and golden bells: studies in biblical, Jewish, and Near Eastern ritual, law, and literature, EISENBRAUNS, 1995, pp 467-469: \\"No 'national' commandment such as that of 'conquest and settling the land' occurs in any of these [Judaic] summaries [of the Torah]‚Ä¶ [arguments for applying herem to modern Israel] introduces a distinction that Scripture does not recognize; nowhere are the obligations referred to in the summaries contingent on the achievement of the land-taking or the destruction of Israel's enemies. To suppose that they may be set aside or suspended for the accomplishment of national ends is a leap far beyond scripture‚Ä¶. The [biblical] injunctions to take the land are embedded in narrative and give the appearance of being addressed to a specific generation, like the commandment to annihilate or expel the natives of Canaan, which refers specifically to the seven Canaanite nations‚Ä¶ Now, had there ben any inclination to generalize the law [of extermination], it would have been easy for the talmudic sages to [do so].

Joshi of the Indian Navy with a five o'clock shadow In the armed forces and police of India, male Sikh servicemen are allowed to wear full beards as their religion expressly requires followers to do so. However, they are specifically required to \\"dress up their hair and beard properly\\". Non-Sikh personnel are allowed to grow whiskers and moustaches, with the only regulation being that \\"will be of moderate length\\". In December 2003, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Muslims in uniform can grow beards. Thus, non-Muslims and non-Sikhs serving in the Indian Army or the Indian Air Force are not permitted to wear beards. However, Army personnel on active duty are sometimes exempt from facial hair regulations for the duration of their tour of duty if their deployment makes access to such facilities difficult. Indian Navy personnel are allowed to grow beards subject to the permission of their commanding officer. Exceptions for other religions are made in the case of special forces operatives like the Indian Air Force Pilots, Indian army's Para (Special Forces) soldiers and the navy's MARCOS commandos who are allowed to grow beards. =Iran= Beards are permitted in the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran. As a sign of their ideological motivation, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (Sepah) personnel used to tend to wear full beards, while the Islamic Republic of Iran Army (Artesh) personnel are usually trimmed or wear mustaches. =Iraq= Beards to a certain length were traditionally permitted in the Iraqi security forces, however, a ban was brought into effect in April 2012 due to public associations between beards and certain sectarian militias in Iraq. As a result of the change Iraqi soldiers and police must now be clean shaven. Under the rule of Saddam Hussein, beards were not allowed in the army and in military service, only a mustache. =Israel= The IDF prohibits the growing of facial hair unless a special request form has been filed and approved. The requests can be for religious reasons (full beard only), health reasons such as acne (no restrictions on facial hair styles), and on the grounds of \\"free will\\", which means the facial hair (mustache, a goatee or a full beard all of which must be well groomed) has to be part of the soldiers identity and part of his self-esteem. If the request is due to health reasons, it must be approved by the military doctor and lasts up to half a year. If the request is due to religious reasons or \\"free will\\", it must be approved by an officer at the rank of Major, that is acquainted with the soldier, for religious requests the form must be approved additional by a military Rabbi, who usually conducts an interview, and finally by an Adjutant officer. The exemption from shaving expires only if the soldier shaves his facial hair willingly. =Lebanon= Beards are not allowed in the Lebanese Armed Forces. Only trimmed moustaches that don't pass the upper lip are permitted. =Pakistan= Beards are permitted in Pakistan Army. They are allowed only on special request is approved. The requests are generally for religious reasons or for health reasons, such as acne or skin allergy. Once the form has been approved applicant is not allowed to shave back. There is a special allowance for bigger moustaches but they must be neat and trimmed. =Nepal= Currently, moustaches and beards are not within regulations in the Nepal Army. In the past, moustaches was popular in the Gorkhali Army commanders and soldiers. Military commanders of Kshatriya order (called Kshetri in Nepal) especially of five Kaji noble family Thapa, Pande, Kunwar, Basnet and Bista used to linked moustaches to dignity. However, with changing times, it became apparent that facial hair can break seals on gas masks, and thus a liability. Thus regulations do not allow for facial hair. Despite this, many soldiers can still be spotted with facial hair, especially when stationed in remote areas, away from the eyes of the press, and if their unit commanders are willing to look the other way.

If a moustache is kept, it has to be kept neatly trimmed and of moderate length.https://www.ns.sg/nsp/wcm/connect/site/site%20content/miscellaneous/archive/saf- dress-general-instructions Exception for beards are allowed for those in the Sikh faith. =South Korea= Beards are not allowed in the South Korean Armed Forces. =Sri Lanka= The Navy does not allow moustaches alone but does allow full-set beards. Moustaches but not beards are permitted in the Army and Air Force. However, members of the Commando and Special Forces regiments are allowed to wear beards if based outside their home camps. =Syria= Beards are not allowed in the Syrian Army. Trimmed moustaches, however, are allowed. Europe =Belgium= The Belgian Armed Forces permits moustaches and beards, but they have to be properly trimmed. =Austria= The Austrian Armed Forces permits moustaches, beards and sideburns, as long as they are neatly trimmed. =Croatia= The Republic of Croatia Armed Forces permits moustaches for soldiers and non-commissioned officers. Officers are allowed to wear neatly trimmed beards. Furthermore, beards are not only allowed but fully recommended for members of special operations teams when deployed. =Czech Republic= The Army of the Czech Republic permits moustaches, sideburns or a neat full beard of a natural colour. A moustache has to be trimmed so it would not exceed the lower margin of the upper lip. Sideburns may not reach under the middle of each auricle. Hairs of sideburns and goatee may not exceed 2 cm (0.787 inch) in length.https://kariera.army.cz/faq?field_rubrika=2&page;=8 =Denmark= Danish Army personnel are generally allowed to wear any well- kept beard. Stubble, however, is not allowed. Full beards are popular among units deployed in Afghanistan, as it is easier to maintain when in the field. This also helps break down cultural barriers between the Danish and the Afghans, as most Afghan men wear full beards, and because many Danes grow red- coloured beards, an Afghan symbol of bravery. Soldiers who belong to Den Kongelige Livgarde (The Royal Life Guards) are not allowed to have beards when on guard duty. Additionally, Danish soldiers are not required to have short haircuts, though most have. =Finland= The regulations of the Finnish Defence Forces (Rule 91) prohibit the growing of a moustache, a beard or long hair. Reservists can grow a moustache, a beard or long hair. =France= The sappers (\\"sapeurs\\") of the French Foreign Legion traditionally wear large beards. Since the Napoleonic era and throughout the 19th century, sappers (combat engineers) of the French Army could wear full beards. Elite troops, such as grenadiers, had to wear large moustaches. Infantry chasseurs were asked to wear moustaches and goatees; and hussars, in addition to their moustache, usually wore two braids in front of each ear, to protect their neck from sword slashes. These traditions were gradually abandoned since the beginning of the 20th century, except for the French Foreign Legion sappers (see below). The \\"decree ‚Ññ 75-675 regarding regulations for general discipline in the Armies of 28 July 1975, modified\\"D√©cret ‚Ññ 75-675 portant r√®glement de discipline g√©n√©rale dans les arm√©es du 28 juillet 1975, modifi√© regulates facial hair in the French armed forces. Military personnel are allowed to grow a beard or moustache only during periods when they are out of uniform. The beard must be \\"correctly trimmed\\", and provisions are stated for a possible ban of beards by the military authorities to ensure compatibility with certain equipment. However, within the Foreign Legion, sappers are traditionally encouraged to grow a large beard. Sappers chosen to participate in the Bastille Day parade are in fact specifically asked to stop shaving so they will have a full beard when they march down the Champs-√âlys√©es. The moustache was an obligation for gendarmes until 1933, hence their nickname of \\"les moustaches\\". By tradition, some gendarmes may still grow a moustache. Submariners may be bearded, clean-shaven, or \\"patrol-bearded\\", growing a beard for the time of a patrol in reminiscence of the time of the diesel submarines whose cramped space allowed for rustic and minimal personal care. French soldiers of the First World War were known by the nickname poilu, meaning \\"hairy one\\" in reference to their facial hair. =Germany= In the Third Reich-era Wehrmacht, facial hair beyond a small neatly trimmed moustache was against regulations, though such regulations were often relaxed under field conditions. The latter was particularly true in the case of the Kriegsmarine and Gebirgsj√§ger. Growth of a full beard was the norm for U-boat crews on active duty, though facial hair was expected to be shaved off soon after reaching port. The present-day regulations of the Bundeswehr allow soldiers to grow a beard on condition that it is not long and is unobtrusive and well- kept. Beards must not impact the proper use of any military equipment, such as a gas mask. Moreover, stubble may not be shown; thus a clean-shaven soldier who wants to start growing a beard must do so during his furlough. =Greece= In the Greek armed forces, only the navy permits military personnel to wear a beard. Neatly trimmed moustaches are the only facial hair permitted in the army and air force. =Ireland= The growing of beards is not permitted in any branch of the Irish Defence Forces with exception of the Army Ranger Wing. Moustaches are permitted with permission. Sideburns are not allowed beyond ear length. The Irish police force similarly does not allow any uniformed members to grow beards but does allow moustaches on the upper lip and ear length sideburns. =Italy= In the Italian armed forces, beards or moustaches are allowed, but well taken care of it; without beards, the sideburns should reach the middle of the tragus. In the various branches of the police, the same specific law is in force. Stubble is permitted outside of ceremonial occasions. =Netherlands= In the Royal Netherlands Army, officers and soldiers may only grow beards after permission has been obtained. As in many other armies, automatic permission is given for certain medical conditions. Mustaches may be grown without asking permission. Beards are worn at times by the Royal Netherlands Marines and by Royal Netherlands Navy personnel. All facial hair in the Netherlands armed forces is subject to instant removal when operational circumstances demand it. Recent operations in Afghanistan under the ISAF have seen a trend of growing \\"tour beards\\", both for bonding and as a way of advancing contacts with the Afghan population, who regard a full beard as a sign of manhood. A beard without a mustache is uncommon in the Netherlands. =Norway= The Royal Guard is required to be clean-shaven. Most operative personnel are not allowed to wear beards (so as not to interfere with gas masks) unless: * The soldier obtains express permission to grow his beard from a high-ranking officer. * The soldier already has a beard upon his enlistment and requests to continue growing it or maintain it at its present length. Although, in the enduring operations in Afghanistan, many soldiers have grown full beards =Poland= According to General Regulation of Polish Armed Forces only neatly trimmed moustaches are allowed without permission. Full beard is allowed only when permitted by Unit Commander or when based on written medical statement. However, beards when grown also shall be neatly trimmed. Many Polish soldiers tended to grow \\"tour beards\\" when deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan or Kosovo. =Portugal= Military personnel in the Portuguese Armed Forces can ask permission to grow a beard or moustaches. It was quite common until the First World War for any soldier to have a beard or moustache. With the 21st century Middle East Military Operations growing a beard has become again more common, both in the Special Forces community and regular young soldiers in the Army, Navy and Air Force. Some Paratroopers use a very distinct moustache. =Russia= Traditionally, Russian soldiers of Russian Tsardom wore beards, but during the reign of Peter the Great they were completely banned in the army and even for civilians, except members of the clergy. Peter did however make moustaches a requirement for every soldier excluding officers, and all of the Russian infantry of the imperial reign could be seen sporting them, often growing beyond the upper- lip. Although the typical image of the imperial Russian soldier shown him with a beard, they were not universally permitted until 1895. Cavalrymen also met these requirements. Officers and staff on the other hand grew whatever hair they wished, and generally kept with the fashion of the time. =Spain= The Spanish Armed Forces allow facial hair, under article 40 of the Royal Ordinances. Dress and grooming standards for Spanish ISAF forces have been relaxed to help the troops blend in better with the local Muslim population. =Serbia= In the Serbian Armed Forces neatly trimmed mustaches are the only facial hair permitted, remaining of the face must be cleanly shaved in every occasion except when legitimate reasons prevent it (e.g. winter field operations, war operations), but soldiers do have to shave the first chance that situation permits. Priests of any denomination are allowed to have beards if their religion requires it, but it still has to be trimmed and well- groomed. =Sweden= The regulations require personnel to be \\"well shaved\\" (v√§lrakad). Within the Royal Guard (H√∂gvakten), the royal companies (Livkomp) and other personnel performing ceremonial duties, temporary or on a regular basis, the regulations are strictly enforced. Within other units, beards tend to be allowed under the discretion of the company commander (or other higher ranking commander). The general provisions of well-managed appearance is enforced also when it comes to beards. Soldiers are however by practice allowed to grow beards during service abroad, for example in Afghanistan. The motivation for the regulation prohibiting beard is that it interferes with the gas-mask and makes it difficult to achieve a perfect air-tight fit. Shorter beard and gun grease or ointment is one remedy but will increase the time for the application of the gas-mask which in turn will put bearded personnel at increased risk of exposure. =Turkey= All Turkish Armed Forces personnel are required to be clean-shaven at all times. =Ukraine= Kyevan Rus' Ukrainian Cossacks traditionally have a distinctive facial hair style ‚Äì long \\"cossack\\" moustache was very popular across Ukraine during Middle Ages until modern times. The tradition allegedly dates back at least to the times of prince of Kyevan Rus' Sviatoslav I of Kiev famous for his military campaigns in the east and south. Sviatoslav had distinctive moustache and hair style (oseledets or chupryna) that almost every Ukrainian cossack had centuries after his times (although Svyatoslav had lived in 10th century, while Cossacks appear on the historical scene only since the 15th century). The length of the cossack moustache was important ‚Äì the longer the better. Sometimes one had to tuck them away behind one's ears. Some cossacks were wearing beards as well, but this type of facial hair was not very popular in Ukraine in general and in Ukraine's military in particular. =United Kingdom= By the second half of the 19th century, beards were largely allowed in the British military. The Royal Navy has always allowed beards, and since the 1850s has permitted its members to wear only a \\"full set\\" (i.e. a full beard and moustache).\\"The Beard: A Royal Navy Tradition\\" A beard or moustache may not be worn without the other and the beard must be full (i.e. cover the whole jawline) and joined to the moustache. The individual must seek permission from his commanding officer to stop shaving and if, after a fortnight without shaving, it becomes clear that the individual cannot grow a proper full set, the commanding officer may order him to shave it off. Until the mid-19th century, facial hair was unusual in the British Army, except for the infantry pioneers, who traditionally grew beards. A small minority of officers wore moustaches. During the 1800s, the attitude to facial hair changed as a result of the Indian and Asian Wars. Many Middle Eastern and Indian cultures associated facial hair with wisdom and power. As a result, facial hair, moustaches and side whiskers in particular, became increasingly common on British soldiers stationed in Asia. In the mid-19th century, during the Crimean War, all ranks were encouraged to grow large moustaches, and full beards during winter. After the Crimean war, regulations were introduced that forbade serving soldiers of all ranks from shaving above their top lip, in essence making moustaches compulsory for those who could grow them, although beards were later forbidden. This remained in place until 1916, when the regulation was abolished by an Army Order dated 6 October 1916. It was issued by Lieutenant- General Sir Nevil Macready, Adjutant-General to the Forces, who loathed his own moustache and immediately shaved it off.\\"The Army Moustache: Optional under a New Order\\", The Times, 7 October 1916Annals of an Active Life by Sir Nevil Macready, pp. 258‚Äì259. However, there is considerable evidence in photographs and film footage that the earlier regulations were widely ignored and that many British soldiers of all ranks were clean-shaven even before 1916.For example, many clean-shaven soldiers are shown in contemporary film footage from 1914 and 1915 shown in the acclaimed 2003 British TV series The First World War, and photographs of the Siege of Sidney Street in 1910 clearly show clean-shaven Scots Guardsmen, indicating that even pre-war regular soldiers disobeyed regulations in this regard. Since that time, the British Army, Royal Air Force, and Royal Marines have allowed moustaches only. Exceptions are beards grown for medical reasons, such as temporary skin irritations, or for religious reasons (usually by Sikhs or Muslims), although in the event of conflict in which the use of chemical or biological weapons is likely, they may be required to shave a strip around the seal of a respirator. Regulations state that the moustache may not extend below the lip or beyond the corners of the mouth, although this regulation is occasionally flouted, especially in the RAF, where handlebar moustaches are still sometimes seen. These were once very common, and the archetypal RAF fighter pilot of the Second World War wore one. Although also technically against regulations, the \\"full set moustache\\" (i.e. a large moustache linked to mutton chop side whiskers, but with a shaved chin) is also still sometimes seen, and the battalion bugle majors of The Rifles, or the other rifle regiments which preceded it, are expected to wear them by regimental tradition.\\"Soldier grows mutton-chop beard for new role\\", ITV News, 7 April 2013 Infantry pioneer warrant officers, colour sergeants and sergeants traditionally wear and are permitted to wear beards; although not compulsory, most do wear them. In some Scottish and Irish infantry regiments, it is either permitted or expected, by regimental tradition, for the drum major, pipe major, and/or commanding officer's piper to wear a beard. The goat majors in Welsh regiments also by tradition wear beards. As with the Royal Navy, all beards worn by soldiers must be a \\"full set\\". Beards are also permitted to special forces when on covert intelligence operations or behind enemy lines. On 12 August 2019, the Royal Air Force announced that it would henceforth permit full set beards as per the Royal Navy,\\"RAF to allow beards for the first time\\", BBC News, 12 August 2019 although unlike the Royal Navy it will also continue to permit moustaches alone. Members of the royal family, who are expected to wear military uniform on ceremonial occasions even long after their formal military service is complete, have sometimes worn beards with Army, RAF or Royal Marines uniform (e.g. King Edward VII, King George V, Prince Michael of Kent, Prince Harry). Any style of facial hair is allowed to British police officers, as long as it is neatly trimmed. Americas =Mexico= Beards and sideburns are not permitted by the regular Mexican military, without exception. Soldiers at any rank must be clean-shaven and short haired.http://www.sedena.gob.mx/pdf/reglamentos/rglmto_deb_mil.pdf =Argentina= Beards and sideburns are banned in all military and police forces since the early 20th century. A clean-shaved face is considered part of a spirit of order, hygiene and discipline. Stubble is also considered unacceptable and controlled with severity. Well-trimmed moustaches are allowed in most of these branches, although in some cases this is a privilege of officers and sub-officers, and it's not allowed to be grown while on duty. Before the end of 20th century, the Navy became a singularity within the Argentine Armed Forces as Adm. Joaqu√≠n Stella, then Navy Chief of Staff allowed beards in 2000 for officers with ranks above Teniente de Corbeta (Ensign), according to Section 1.10.1.1 of the Navy Uniform regulations (R.A-1-001). Adm. Stella gave the example himself by becoming the first bearded Argentine admiral since Adm. S√°enz Valiente in the 1920s. Non commissioned officers can wear beards from Suboficial Segundo (Petty Officer) rank, and upwards. Protocol still requires officers to appear clean-shaved on duty, thus forcing those who choose to sport beards to grow them while on leave. Both full beards and goatees are allowed, as long as they proffer a professional, non-eccentric image. Nowadays, bearded Argentine naval and marine officers and senior NCO's are a relatively common sight. =Brazil= The Brazilian Army, Brazilian Navy and Brazilian Air Force permit moustaches, as long as they are trimmed to just above the upper lip. Recruits, however, may not wear moustaches. Beards are generally not allowed except for special exceptions, such as covering a deformity. In such cases, a beard is permitted under authorization.Portaria N¬∫ 310. Diretoria de Servi√ßo Militar. Ex√©rcito Brasileiro. =Canada= Effective 25 September 2018, the wearing of a beard is authorized for all CAF members upon attainment of their operationally functional point (OFP) or having completed developmental period one, whichever comes last. However, Commanders of Commands, Task Force Commanders and Commanding Officers retain the right to order restrictions on the wearing of a beard to meet safety and operational requirements. This includes restrictions pertaining to operations and training where, in a chemical biological radiological nuclear (CBRN) environment or CBRN training environment, a beard can be ordered to be removed to ensure force protection on operations or training. Such restrictions will be as temporary as feasible (E.G. as long as the entire duration of an operational tour in a CBRN environment or as short as a single training day for CBRN operations). Where current CAF equipment capabilities cannot ensure force protection or the ability to effectively employ safety systems while wearing a beard, beard restrictions for members using that equipment for operational or safety reasons may be put in place by a Commanding Officer. In no case is a beard permitted without a moustache, and only full beards may be worn (not goatees, van dykes, etc.) Beards are also allowed to be worn by personnel conducting OPFOR duties. =Colombia= Only after the rank of captain, officers in the Army, Air Force and Police are allowed to wear a well trimmed moustache that doesn't grow over the upper lip. Beards and sideburns are not allowed. The Navy does not allow facial hair. =United States= Ambrose Burnside wore a large moustache and sideburns American soldiers shaving Excluding limited exemptions for religious accommodation, the United States Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps have policies that prohibit beards on the basis of hygiene and the necessity of a good seal for chemical weapon protective masks. The official position is that uniform personal appearance and grooming contribute to discipline and a sense of camaraderie. All branches of the U.S. military currently prohibit beards for a vast majority of recruits, although some mustaches are still allowed,www.nytimes.com, 1984, retrieved 11 July 2011. based on policies that were initiated during the period of World War I. On 10 November 1970, Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Elmo Zumwalt explicitly authorized beards for active duty Naval personnel, in his Z-gram number 57, \\"Elimination of Demeaning or Abrasive Regulation,\\" although his position was that they were already implicitly allowed based on policy changes made by his predecessor, Thomas H.

The U.S. Coast Guard allowed beards until 1986, when they were banned by Commandant Admiral Paul Yost. The majority of police forces in the United States still ban their officers from wearing beards. Mustaches are generally allowed in both the military and police forces (except for those undergoing basic training), so long as they are well-groomed. U.S. Army regulations, for example, require that a mustaches be \\"neatly trimmed, tapered, and tidy\\", and that \\"no portion of the mustache will cover the upper lip line, extend sideways beyond a vertical line drawn upward from the corners of the mouth...or extend above a parallel line at the lowest portion of the nose.\\" Those with skin conditions such as pseudofolliculitis barbae or severe acne are allowed to maintain short facial hair with the permission of a doctor or medic, but no shaping is allowed, only trimming with an electric razor, or approved regular razor. 1/8‚Äì1/4 of an inch (3.2 mm) is usually the standard for this condition. Exceptions for religious accommodation U.S. Army Captain Tejdeep Singh Rattan, 2010 In 2010, the Army granted waivers for a number of Sikh soldiers and one Muslim soldier, permitting them to have beards (and in the case of the Sikh soldiers, to have \\"unshorn\\" hair covered by turbans).www.npr.org, retrieved 21 June 2011.www.army,.mil, retrieved 21 June 2011.

Effective 22 January 2014, the U.S. military expanded its policies on religious accommodation and now allows all officer and enlisted personnel to request permission to wear beards and articles of clothing for religious reasons.U.S. military giving troops more leeway for religious clothing, beards, David Alexander, Reuters, 23 January 2014\\"DOD Instruction 1300.17, amended as of January 2014\\", retrieved 26 January 2014 Oceania =Australia= Beards are normally not allowed in the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, however, neatly trimmed moustaches and sideburns are allowed. Regulations apply, however. The moustache can not be grown past the top lip. The sideburns are not to be past the point where the bottom of the ear connects to the facial skin. In some circumstances though such as medical or religious reasons, beards may be permitted. Exceptions to this rule, however, are assault pioneers and special forces that are on missions. In the Royal Australian Navy, members may grow a beard but only with approval from their commanding officer. The beard must be complete, joined from sideburns, covering the chin and joining the moustache. A moustache on its own is not permitted.

Life Mary Unwin was the daughter of William Cawthorne, a draper of Ely, who was born in that city in 1724. Hayley remembered her when comparatively young, a person of lively talents with a sweet serene countenance, and remarkably fond of reading. William Cowper afterwards compared her manners to those of a duchess, and she certainly resembled many great ladies of her time by her addiction to snuff. Early in 1744, she married Morley Unwin (1703‚Äì1767), son of Thomas Unwin by his wife Martha, the daughter of a cloth manufacturer of Castle Hedingham, Essex. Thomas was a grandson of Thomas Unwin (1618‚Äì1689) of Castle Hedingham, and the family had then been established in Essex for several generations, so that the Flemish origin of the Unwins or Onwhynnes must be referred to a much earlier date than that suggested by Dr. Smiles (Huguenots in England). Morley Unwin graduated B.A. from Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1725. He was master of the free school at Huntingdon, and lecturer to the two churches in Huntingdon from 1729 until 1742, when he became rector of Grimston, near King's Lynn in Norfolk. There he resided apparently until 1748, when, upon his wife's request, he left the duty in the charge of a curate, and moved back to Huntingdon, where he occupied a ‚Äòconvenient house‚Äô in the High Street, and prepared pupils for the university. He was also reappointed lecturer of St. Mary's, and is said to have caused much dissatisfaction by the irregular performance of the duty. In the autumn of 1765, William Cowper made the acquaintance of the Unwins' eldest son, William Cawthorne Unwin, and he was so pleased with what he saw of the family that in October that year he became (as a paying boarder) a regular inmate of their house. Morley Unwin died on 2 July 1767, as the result of a fall from his horse, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary's, Huntingdon. Ten weeks later Cowper removed, with Mary and her daughter Susanna, to Olney, in order to be under the more direct influence of John Newton. The details of the home life which he shared with the Unwins at Olney are familiar to all readers of Cowper's ‚ÄòCorrespondence.‚Äô In July 1769, the Unwins' son, William Cawthorne Unwin (1745?‚Äì1786), who had been educated at Charterhouse school and at Christ's College, Cambridge (B.A. 1764, M.A. 1767), quit Olney upon being instituted to the rectory of Stock, near Ramsden in Essex. Like his father, he had attached himself to the evangelical party. His ‚Äòspiritual and lively notions in religion‚Äô had from their first meeting attracted Cowper, and from 1770 until his early death he became the poet's chief confidant and the recipient of many of the most delightful letters in the whole range of our literature. Conspicuous among them is that masterpiece of its kind, dated 31 October 1779, in which Cowper accuses Johnson of plucking some of the most beautiful feathers from the wing of Milton's muse, and ‚Äòtrampling them under his great foot.‚Äô After her son's departure and her daughter's engagement to Matthew Powley, vicar of Dewsbury, Mary Unwin seems, at the close of 1772, to have become regularly engaged to Cowper (he being then forty-one and she forty-eight), but before the commencement of 1773, his mind had become once more grievously clouded, and the project of marriage was never to be realised. Upon his recovery, she did all in her power to encourage him to write, and when he became an author he paid her the highest respect as an instinctive critic, and called her his lord chamberlain, whose approbation was his sufficient license for publication. The extraordinary ‚Äòfracas‚Äô, which disturbed the quiet round of domesticity at Olney in April 1784, was almost certainly due to Cowper's perception of a latent jealousy of Lady Austen in the mind of his older friend. Fortunately Mary entertained no jealousy of Cowper's attached kinswoman, Lady Hesketh, with whom the poet resumed relations in 1785. Lady Hesketh in turn fully appreciated Mary's quiet fund of gaiety and the anxiety she had undergone (during Cowper's attacks of hypochondria) ‚Äòfor one whom she certainly loves as well as one human being can love another.‚Äô Mary moved with Cowper, at Lady Hesketh's instance, from Olney to Weston in 1786. In 1793, her health was beginning to fail, and the poet inscribed to her the exquisite lines ‚ÄòTo Mary,‚Äô which Tennyson classed, with those ‚ÄòOn the Receipt of My Mother's Picture,‚Äô as too pathetic for reading aloud. In 1795, they visited Norfolk together, and on 17 December 1796, Mary Unwin died at East Dereham at the age of seventy-two. She was buried in St. Edmund's Chapel (now called the Cowper Chapel) in Dereham church, where a tablet was erected with an inscription by Hayley. Cowper was buried near the same spot four years later. Family Mary Unwin's son, William Cawthorne, died at Winchester, aged 41, on 29 November 1786, and was buried in the cathedral; he left a widow (her maiden name was Shuttleworth, and she died at Croydon in 1825, aged 75) and three young children. Unwin taught his children himself, and to him in his capacity of tutor Cowper inscribed his ‚ÄòTirocinium,‚Äô 6 Nov. 1784. Cowper also wrote a Latin epitaph for his friend, but this was rejected in favour of an English one. His portrait, painted by Gainsborough in 1764, was engraved by H. Robinson from a drawing by W. Harvey (Cowper, ed. Southey, ii. 228). Another son, Henry, became ‚Äòan eminent stationer in Paternoster Row.‚Äô The daughter, Susanna Powley, died in 1835, aged 89.

Chesterite is usually found in thin sheets within ultramafic rocks. A polytype of chesterite could be anthophyllite, which has a similar crystal structure. Chesterite is used for research on stacking formations and symmetry point groups that could be possible polymorphs or polysomes of the amphibole-anthophyllite groups.

He died in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Involvement with the Millerites The Millerite message was based on the preaching of William Miller and predicted that Christ would return about the year 1843, which was later refined to October 22, 1844. This belief was based on the day-year principle and an interpretation of the 2300 days mentioned in which predicted that \\"the sanctuary would be cleansed\\". The Millerites understood this verse to point to Christ's return to \\"cleanse\\" the earth. O. R. L. Crosier collaborated with Hiram Edson and others in setting up and publishing a small Millerite paper, the Day-Dawn. The Great Disappointment Crosier spent October 22, 1844 with friends waiting for the event with Edson and others. On the morning after the Great Disappointment, Edson received an inspiration from God which explained that the Millerites‚Äô error was not in the date, but in the event; that Jesus had begun His work as High Priest in the most holy place in Heaven. Crosier, Edson, and Hahn joined together to study the subject, and Crosier wrote out their findings on the subject of the sanctuary and its cleansing. The findings published by Crosier, Hahn and Edson led to a new understanding about the sanctuary in heaven. Their paper explained how there was a sanctuary in heaven, that Christ, the heavenly High Priest, was to cleanse. The believers understood this cleansing to be what the 2300 days in Daniel was referring to. This belief is known as the investigative judgment. Crosier's published account of Edson's vision came into the possession of James White (husband of Ellen G. White) and Joseph Bates, the latter of whom visited Edson in New York and converted him to the seventh-day Sabbath. Later, however, he repudiated the doctrine entirely.http://www.truthorfables.com/Crosier_Renounces_Shut_Door.htm See also * Millerites * History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church * Heavenly sanctuary * Investigative judgment References External links * Article: The Great Disappointment 1820 births 1912 deaths 19th-century apocalypticists 20th-century apocalypticists Millerites People from Canandaigua, New York ","title":"O.

Intensely lonely and often depressed after Mary's death, he drew much encouragement from the letters of Ellen White. He received more letters from her than any other person outside her immediate family. Eventually he proposed marriage to her but she declined, suggesting instead that Hetty Hurd would make a good companion for him. Involvement in the church Stephen Haskell began preaching for First-day Adventists in 1853, but the same year, after reading a tract on the Sabbath, he became a Sabbath keeper at the age of 20. Following some years in self-supporting work in New England, he was ordained in 1870 and became president of the New England Conference, serving from 1870 to 1887. While in that position, he served three times president of the California Conference (1879‚Äì1887, 1891‚Äì1894, 1908‚Äì1911) and also of the Maine Conference (1884‚Äì1886).Stephen N. Haskell Ellen G. White Estate He and Mary founded the first Tract and Missionary Society (forerunner of the General Conference Personal Ministries Department), and from 1870 to 1889 Stephen promoted and organized that work from local societies to the General Conference. Haskell popularized the Bible reading method of religious discourse among Seventh-day Adventists. In November 1883 the General Conference session endorsed this question-and-answer method and authorized a monthly magazine, Bible Reading Gazette, forerunner of the book Bible Readings for the Home Circle. For Haskell, the Bible reading method became his favorite mode of presentation, which he taught to others through the Bible Training School and later Bible Handbook. Mission work In 1885 Elder Haskell was in charge of the first group of Seventh-day Adventist missionaries who went to open the work in Australia. Together with two other Adventist preachers, John Corliss and Mendel Israel, he helped start the Signs Publishing Company first began as the Echo Publishing Company, in North Fitzroy, a suburb of Melbourne, which by 1889, was the third largest Seventh-day Adventist publishing house in the world. He also founded South Lancaster Academy (now Atlantic Union College) in 1882. From 1889 to 1890 he traveled to many parts of the world on behalf of Adventist missionary work. His wife died in 1894, and in 1897 he remarried to Hetty Hurd and with her did evangelistic and Bible work in Australia and the United States. He also authored several books including: The Story of Daniel the Prophet, The Story of the Seer of Patmos, and The Cross and Its Shadow. Elder Haskell died in California in 1922. Vegetarianism Haskell was a strict vegetarian (which would later be termed vegan), and abstained from alcohol and tobacco.Amey, Catherine. (2014). The Compassionate Contrarians: A History of Vegetarians in Aotearoa New Zealand. Rebel Press. pp. 31-33. He argued that the food God intended for humankind were \\"fruits, grains, and nuts\\". Haskell believed that God, health and compassion for animals were interconnected and that God would punish those who abused animals. Haskell visited Auckland in 1885 and attempted to convert those around him to vegetarianism. See also * Ellen G.

It was named Glommendalen from 1885 to 1915 and Glommendalens Social-Demokrat from 1915 to 1923. It was started as Glommendalen on 1 March 1885, a newspaper for the region Gl√•mdalen. The first editor was Hans Aasumb, and the political affiliation was Liberal. The newspaper drifted slowly to the left, and it was bought by the Labour Party and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions in 1914. The seller was Erik Lund, who had bought the newspaper in 1907 and continued as editor-in-chief. The newspaper was also merged with Solungen, whose last issue came in December 1914. From 1 April 1915 the merged newspaper was named Glommendalens Social-Demokrat. On 30 April 1923 the name was changed to Glomdalens Arbeiderblad. Later in 1923 the Communist Party broke away from the Labour Party, and took with them the Glomdalens Arbeiderblad. The newspaper was published on a daily basis. Waldemar Carlsen, the editor-in-chief since 1916, remained in the editor chair until he quit his job in 1925 because he did not receive wages anymore. Arbeiderpressens Samvirke took over the newspaper, and declared bankruptcy in 1926. Then, Arbeiderpressens Samvirke used the newspaper's infrastructure to start and publish a new newspaper Kongsvinger Arbeiderblad, renamed Gl√•mdalen in 1943. Glomdalens Arbeiderblad continued with a Communist editor, but was now printed in Hamar. The newspaper went defunct after its last issue on 1 April 1927.

It is traditional during the festival Fasching in Bad Aussee to brandish inflated pig bladders on sticks. Similarly, in Xinzo de Limia, Spain, inflated pig bladders are carried during Carnival.

The bladder is used as a casing for several traditional food items, including the sausages known as ventricina and sobrassada. Historical uses Richard Lindon in 1880 Historically the pig bladder was used in sports, as the airtight membrane (\\"bladder\\") inside a football. In the early 19th century the inventor William Gilbert used pig bladders in the manufacture of rugby balls. Decades later, Richard Lindon did the same. (See also Mob football, Medieval football, and La soule.) For centuries before the invention of the paint tube, artists used to store their paints in pig bladders. When the artist was ready to use the paint, they would puncture a hole in the bladder and squeeze out the desired amount of paint. They would have to mend the hole when finished and the whole process was quite messy. Finlay, Victoria. Color: A Natural History of the Palette. New York: Random, 2002. Print.

Background Its antecedents lie in the initiatives of president Manuel Bulnes and his minister, Manuel Rengifo, to draw up the second population census and obtain statistical data of the country. By Decree No. 18 March 27, 1843, the Office of Statistics was created, Ministry of the Interior to provide knowledge of the departments and provinces.

The powertrain of the C-X75 concept is rated at through four YASA electric motors, each of which drives one of the four wheels. The batteries driving these motors are recharged using two diesel-fed micro gas turbines instead of a conventional four-stroke engine. It was described as a design study that would influence future design and technology. In May 2011 Jaguar announced a limited production of the C-X75 from 2013 to 2015, with a compact, forced induction petrol engine combined with electric motors instead of the micro gas turbines in the concept car. A maximum of 250 cars were planned to be built in partnership with Williams F1. The production version was expected to have an all-electric range of . In December 2012, the company announced the cancellation of production due to the ongoing global economic crisis. Five developmental prototypes were produced in the production car specifications in 2013. The car was featured in the 2015 film Spectre, the twenty-fourth James Bond film in which seven cars were supplied to the film makers. Engine and performance In terms of performance, Jaguar envisioned a goal of their future sports car reaching and accelerating from in 2.9 seconds and in 2.3 seconds. It is powered by four electric motors ‚Äì one for each wheel ‚Äì which have a total of and a total torque output of . Inherent in the drivetrain is the ability to independently drive each wheel across the full speed range, known as Torque Vectoring. Each motor weighs . The micro gas turbines from Bladon Jets generate enough electricity to extend the range of the car to while producing 28 grams of per kilometre on the EU test cycle. While running solely on battery power, the C-X75 has an all-electric range of . Among other advantages, the micro turbines used in the C-X75 can be run on a range of fuels including diesel, biofuels, compressed natural gas and liquid petroleum gas. The 15 kWh lithium ion battery pack weighs . Jaguar estimated an average carbon emission of 28 g/km on European test cycle, however, the carbon emission is around 150g/km if the turbines are running. Jaguar also focused on the aerodynamics in order to improve performance. For example, the carbon- fibre rear diffuser that guides airflow from under the car creating down- force, and includes an active aerofoil and is lowered automatically as speed increases. Moreover, the C-X75 features an extruded and bonded, aerospace- inspired, aluminium chassis, saving weight and improving sustainability and performance. Production In May 2011 Jaguar unveiled plans to produce the C-X75; the company had planned to produce a maximum of 250 cars in partnership with Formula One team Williams F1. The decision was part of a investment plan, announced by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in March 2011 at the Geneva Motor Show, to launch 40 \\"significant new products\\" over the next five years. The model was scheduled to be built from 2013 until 2015, although it had not yet been decided where the production would take place. The C-X75 was to be built without the micro-turbines, instead, the production version would use a downsized, forced induction petrol engine, with one electric motor at each axle. In order to create a lightweight strong structure, the chassis was planned to be made of carbon-fibre, and the engine was to be mid-mounted for optimum weight distribution and to retain the concept's silhouette. The C-X75 production version was expected to deliver emissions of less than 99 g/km, a sub-three second 0‚Äì60 mph acceleration time, a top speed in excess of and a reduced all-electric range of as compared to the for the concept car. Cancellation In December 2012, Jaguar's Global Brand Director announced the cancellation of production due to the ongoing global economic crisis, as the carmaker considered that \\" it seems the wrong time to launch an ¬£800,000 to ¬£1 million supercar.\\" The company expected to take advantage of part of the investment in the C-X75 development by using the C-X75 technology in future Jaguar cars. The Jaguar F-type was heavily influenced from the C-X75 and carried over many design cues and technological features from it. Jaguar announced its decision to continue working on five prototypes to be developed until May 2013. These prototypes featured a 1.6-litre turbocharged and supercharged inline-4 engine coupled with two YASA electric motors placed on each axle of the car. The powertrain had a combined power output of at 9,000 rpm and helped the car achieve speeds up to . Up to three of these prototypes were then sold at auction, while one went to a future Jaguar museum, and one was kept by Jaguar for running demonstrations. One of these prototypes was also featured in the 2015 James Bond film, Spectre. Appearance in Spectre One of the Seven C-X75s used in the film Spectre A Jaguar C-X75 (painted in dark orange) appears in the 2015 James Bond film Spectre as Mr. Hinx's car (licensed ROMA 860K). It takes part in a car chase around Rome against James Bond, who drives an Aston Martin DB10. Jaguar supplied seven examples to the filmmakers. Although the cars are visually faithful to the original C-X75 concept, they are mechanically unrelated. According to JLR Special Vehicle Operations chief John Edwards, the cars are \\"constructed around a spaceframe built to World Rally Championship spec\\" and powered by a dry sump V8 engine. Although this new appearance of the C-X75 led to speculation that production plans for the car were being revived, Edwards was quoted as saying \\"the film was an opportunity to showcase C-X75, but it doesn‚Äôt mean a change in strategy.\\" The car was built in collaboration with Williams F1.

The prodigy houses stretch over the periods of Tudor, Elizabethan, and Jacobean architecture, though the term may be restricted to a core period of roughly 1570 to 1620.as by Norwich, 670 Many of the grandest were built with a view to housing Elizabeth I and her large retinue as they made their annual royal progress around her realm. Many are therefore close to major roads, often in the English Midlands. The term originates with the architectural historian Sir John Summerson, and has been generally adopted. He called them \\"...the most daring of all English buildings.\\"Summerson (1980), 70 The houses fall within the broad style of Renaissance architecture, but represent a distinctive English take on the style, mainly reliant on books for their knowledge of developments on the Continent. Andrea Palladio (1508‚Äì1580) was already dead before the prodigy houses reached their peak, but his much more restrained classical style did not reach England until the work of Inigo Jones in the 1620s. For ornament, French and Flemish Northern Mannerist decoration was more influential than Italian.Summerson (1993), 50‚Äì54; Airs, 23‚Äì24, 37‚Äì38 Elizabeth I travelled through southern England in annual summer \\"progresses\\", staying at the houses of wealthy courtiers; however she never went north of Worcester or west of Bristol,Ridley, chapter 3 though by the end of her reign there were many large houses beyond these self-imposed boundaries. The hosts were expected to house the monarch in style, and provide sufficient accommodation for about 150 travelling members of the court, for whom temporary buildings might need to be erected.Girouard, 111 Elizabeth was not slow to complain if she felt her accommodation had not been appropriate, and did so even about two of the largest prodigy houses, Theobalds House and Old Gorhambury House (both now destroyed).Girouard, 109‚Äì112; Airs, 50 Partly as a result of this imperative, but also general increasing wealth, there was an Elizabethan building boom, with large houses built in the most modern styles by courtiers, wealthy from acquired monastic estates, who wished to display their wealth and status.Summerson (1993), 58‚Äì59; Airs, 14‚Äì17, 50 A characteristic was the large area of glass ‚Äì a new feature that superseded the need for easily defended external walls and announced the owners' wealth. Hardwick Hall, for example, was proverbially described as \\"Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall.\\"Airs, 158 Many other smaller prodigy houses were built by businessmen and administrators, as well as long-established families of the peerage and gentry. The large Doddington Hall, Lincolnshire was built between 1593 and 1600 by Robert Smythson for Thomas Tailor, who was the recorder to the Bishop of Lincoln; \\"Tailor was a lawyer and therefore rich\\" says Simon Jenkins.Jenkins, 433; Some recent uses of the term extend the meaning to describe large ostentatious houses in the United States of later periods, such as colonial mansions in Virginia, first so described by the American writer Cary Carson.Mooney, 2 Style In many respects the style of the houses varies greatly, but consistent features are a love of glass, a high elevation, symmetrical exteriors, consistency between all sides of the building, a rather square plan, often with tower pavilions at the corners that rise above the main roofline, and a decorated skyline. Altogether \\"...a strange amalgam of exuberant pinnacles and turrets, native Gothic mullioned windows, and Renaissance decoration.\\"Williams, 209 Many houses stand alone, with stables and other outbuildings at a discreet distance. Glass was then an expensive material, and its use on a large scale a demonstration of wealth. The large windows required mullions, normally in stone even in houses mainly in brick. For the main structure, stone is preferred, often as a facing over brick, but some buildings use mostly brick, for example Hatfield House, following the precedent of Hampton Court and other earlier houses. Though there were often reminiscences of the medieval castle, the houses were exceptionally without defences, compared to contemporary Italian and French equivalents. To have two internal courtyards, requiring a very large building, was a status symbol, found at Audley End, Blickling Hall, and others. By the end of the Elizabethan period this sprawling style, essentially developing the form of late medieval buildings like Knole in Kent (which has a total of 7 courtyards), and many Oxbridge colleges, was giving way to more compact high-rising structures with a coherent and dramatic structural plan, making the whole form of the building visible from outside the house. Hardwick Hall, Burghley House, and on a smaller scale Wollaton Hall, exemplify this trend.Airs, 53‚Äì56; Williams, 208‚Äì209 The outer exteriors of the house are more decorated than internal exteriors such as courtyards, the reverse of the usual priority in medieval houses. The common E and H-shaped plans, and in effect incorporating an imposing gatehouse into the main facade, rather than placing it across an initial courtyard, increased the visibility of the most grandly decorated parts of the exterior.Williams, 208; Airs, 58‚Äì59 The classical orders were often used as decoration, piled up one above the other on the storeys over the main entrance. But, with a few exceptions such as Kirby Hall,Summerson (1993), 47‚Äì48 columns were restricted to such individual features; in other buildings such as the Bodleian Library similar \\"Towers of the Five Orders\\" sit at the centre of frankly Gothic facades. At Longleat and Wollaton shallow pilasters are used across the facades. A crib-book, The First and Chief Grounds of Architecture by John Shute (1563) had been commissioned or sponsored by \\"Protector Somerset\\", John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and is recorded in the libraries of many important clients of buildings, along with Sebastiano Serlio's Architettura, initially in Italian or another language until 1611, when Robert Peake published four of the volumes in English.Airs, 24. This is somewhat simplifying the complicated history of the writing and publication of Serlio's work. The heavily-illustrated books on ornament by the Netherlander Hans Vredeman de Vries (1560s onwards) and German Wendel Dietterlin (1598) supplied much of the Northern Mannerist decorative detail such as strapwork. It is evident from surviving letters that courtiers took a keen and competitive interest in architectural matters.Summerson (1993), 50‚Äì54; Airs, 15‚Äì24 Interiors Inside, most houses still had a large hall in the medieval style, often with a stone or wood screen at one end. But this was only used for eating in by the servants, except on special occasions. The main room for the family to eat and live in was the great chamber, usually on the first floor (above the ground floor), a continuation of late medieval developments. In the 16th century a withdrawing room was usually added between the great chamber and the principal bedroom, as well as the long gallery. The parlour was another name for a more private room, and increasingly there were a number of these in larger houses, where the immediate family would now usually eat,Girouard, 88‚Äì105 and where they might retreat entirely in cold weather. Although the first modern corridor in England was probably built in this period, in 1579, they remained rare, and houses continued to have most rooms only accessible through other rooms, with the most intimate spaces of the family at the end of a suite.Barbagli & Kertzer, 12‚Äì13 Staircases became wide and elaborate, and normally made of oak; Burghley and Hardwick are exceptions using stone.Summerson (1993), 88 The new concept of a large long gallery was an important space, and many houses had spaces for entertaining on the top floor, whether small rooms in towers on the roof, or the very large top-floor rooms at Hardwick and Wollaton. Meanwhile, the servants lived on the ground floor. This might be seen as a lingering memory of the medieval castle, where domestic spaces were often placed high above the soldiery, and viewpoints were highly functional, and is a feature rarely found in subsequent large houses for two centuries or more. At Hardwick the windows increase in size as the storeys rise up, reflecting the increasing status of the rooms.Strong, 195‚Äì196 In several houses the mostly flat roof itself was part of the reception spaces, with banqueting houses in the towers that were only accessible from \\"the leads\\", and a layout that allowed walking around to admire the views.Girouard, 105, 118 Architects The designers are often unclear, and the leading figures had a background in one of the specialisms of building. Sometimes owners played a part in the detailed design, though the age of the gentleman amateur architect mostly came later. Few original drawings survive, though there are some by the architect-mason Robert Smythson (1535‚Äì1614) who was an important figure; many houses at least show his influence. Robert Lyminge was in charge of Hatfield and Blickling. John Thorpe laid the foundation stone of Kirby Hall as a five-year old (his father was chief mason, and children were often asked to perform this ritual) and is associated with Charlton House, Longford Castle, Condover Hall and the original Holland House, and perhaps Rushton Hall and Audley End. The demand for skilled senior builders, able to design and manage projects or parts of them, exceeded supply, and, at least in the largest houses, they appear to have been usually given a great deal of freedom in deciding the actual design by their mainly absentee clients.Airs, 22‚Äì23; Summerson (1993), 54‚Äì57 History Ch√¢teau de Chambord of Fran√ßois I of France (built 1519‚Äì1547) Detail of Joris Hoefnagel's 1568 watercolour of the south front of Nonsuch Palace Mentmore Towers, 1852-54 The first \\"prodigy house\\" might be said to be Henry VII's Richmond Palace, completed in 1501 but now destroyed. But as a royal palace it does not strictly fit the definition. Hampton Court Palace, built by Cardinal Wolsey but taken over by the king on his fall, is certainly an example. The trend continued through the reigns of Henry VIII, Elizabeth, and into the reign of James I, when it reached its height. Henry was a prolific builder himself, though little of his work survives, but the prudent Elizabeth (like her siblings) built nothing herself, instead encouraging her courtiers to \\"...build on a scale which in the past would have been seen as a dynastic threat.\\"Airs, 50, quoted Others see the original Somerset House in the Strand, London as the first prodigy house, or at least the first English attempt at a thoroughly and consistently classical style.Summerson (1993), 43‚Äì44; Williams, 208‚Äì210; Airs, 46 With some other Ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley, the Ch√¢teau de Chambord of Fran√ßois I of France (built 1519‚Äì1547) had many features of the English houses, and certainly influenced Henry VIII's Nonsuch Palace.Airs, 33 Important political families such as the Cecils and Bacons were serial builders of houses. These newly-risen families were typically the most frenetic builders.Summerson (1993), 67‚Äì69, 79‚Äì81; Airs, 48‚Äì51 Sites were chosen for their potential convenience for royal progresses, rather than being the centre of landholdings, which were looked after by agents, or any local political powerbase.Airs, 14‚Äì16 The term prodigy house ceases to be used for houses built after about 1620. Despite some features of more strictly classical houses like Wilton House (rebuilding begun 1630) continuing those of the prodigy house, the term is not used of them. Much later houses like Houghton Hall and Blenheim Palace show a lingering fondness for elements of the 16th-century prodigy style.Summerson (1980), 70‚Äì71 In the 19th century Jacobethan revivals began, most spectacularly at Harlaxton Manor, which Anthony Salvin began in 1837. This manages to impart a Baroque swagger to the Northern Mannerist vocabulary.Jenkins, 438‚Äì440; Esher, 160‚Äì164 Mentmore Towers, by Joseph Paxton, is an enormous revival of a Smythson-type style, and like Westonbirt House (Lewis Vulliamy, 1860s) and Highclere Castle (Sir Charles Barry 1839‚Äì42, the setting for Downton Abbey), is something of an inflated Wollaton.Norwich, 66, 254 The royal Sandringham House in Norfolk includes prodigy elements in its mixed styles. Apart from private houses, elements of the prodigy style were popular for at least the exteriors of all other types of public buildings, and office buildings designed to impress. Many of the houses were later demolished, in the English Civil War or other times, and many smothered by later rebuilding. But the period retained a prestige, especially for families who rose to prominence during it, and in many the exteriors at least were largely retained. The north fronts of The Vyne and Lyme Park are examples of a slightly incongruous mixture of the Elizabethan and Palladian in a single facade.Jenkins, 83‚Äì84 Criticism The rear of Audley End Longford Castle, built on a triangular plan The ruins of Old Gorhambury House The houses attracted criticism from the first, surprisingly often from their owners. The flattering poem To Penshurst by Ben Jonson (1616), contrasts Penshurst Place, a large and important late medieval house that was extended in a similar style under Elizabeth, with prodigy houses:Song, 49‚Äì50 Thou art not, Penshurst, built to envious show, Of touch or marble; nor canst boast a row Of polished pillars, or a roof of gold; Thou hast no lantern, whereof tales are told, Or stair, or courts; but stand‚Äôst an ancient pile, ... And though thy walls be of the country stone, They‚Äôre reared with no man‚Äôs ruin, no man‚Äôs groan; There‚Äôs none that dwell about them wish them down; But all come in, the farmer and the clown, ... Now, Penshurst, they that will proportion thee With other edifices, when they see Those proud, ambitious heaps, and nothing else, May say their lords have built, but thy lord dwells.Text from the Poetry Foundation Alternatives Though the style became dominant for very large houses from around 1570, there were alternatives. At Kenilworth Castle, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester did not want to lose the historic royal associations of his building, and from 1563 modernised and extended it to harmonize the old and new,Jenkins, 808 though the expanses of glass still impressed Midlanders. Bolsover Castle, Broughton Castle, Haddon Hall and Carew Castle in Wales were other sympathetic expansions of a medieval castle. The vernacular half-timbered style retained some popularity for gentry houses like Speke Hall and Little Moreton Hall, mostly in areas short of good building stone. Earlier, Compton Wynyates (begun c. 1481, greatly extended 1515‚Äì1525) was a resolutely unsymmetrical jumble of essentially medieval styles, including prominent half-timbering on the gables of the facade.Airs, 42‚Äì43 It also nestles in a hollow, as medieval houses often did, avoiding the worst of the wind. In contrast, prodigy houses, like castles before them, often deliberately chose exposed sites where they could command the landscape (Wollaton, Hardwick); their owners mostly did not anticipate being there in winter.

For other Acronyms of MSE, see MSE History MSE was founded in 1936, by Ernest Foulkes, initially as a manufacturer and distributor of machine tools and equipment. Throughout World War II, MSE was appointed by the UK ministry of supply to act as lease lend agents for American machine tools in order to support the war effort. In the 1930s and early 1940s, the name stood for Machine Shop Equipment. With the founding of the National Health Service following the culmination of the second world war, MSE was retained by them to develop hospital Microtomes, which until then had not been manufactured in the UK. In the early 1950s, the newly formed Atomic Energy Authority approached MSE requesting them to manufacture a range of centrifuges for use in their research. Following the change of focus from machine tool manufacture to centrifuges, the acronym MSE was changed to Measuring and Scientific Equipment. The 1960s, 1970s and 1980s MSE moved to larger premises in Crawley, during the early 1960s and was well established by 1968. Following Foulke's retirement in 1972, MSE was acquired by Fisons and became linked with Kontron soon after. Kontron AG, at the time, were heavily involved in the production and design of ultra centrifuge systems, which MSE used to support their ultra centrifuges. Production and development continued through the 1980s following the relocation of the entire manufacturing side to Uxbridge in 1983. The 1990s In 1990, Fisons Scientific Equipment restructured and sold its manufacturing wing to Sanyo, where it was assimilated into the Gallenkamp brand, and marketed as Sanyo Gallenkamp PLC. Throughout the 1990s, Sanyo Gallenkamp produced a range of laboratory centrifuges, although was also known for the production of incubators (CO2, Orbital and cooled), fridges, freezers, blood banks, ovens and water stills.http://www.nhspurchasing.com/brochome.asp?OrgCode=1157&header;=product Production moved to Loughborough in 1998, where the UK office for Sanyo Gallenkamp currently lies. Present day In 2003, Sanyo Gallenkamp sold the manufacturing wing of MSE to Henderson Biomedical Ltd, a centrifuge servicing company, and manufacturing moved to Lower Sydenham in south London. Today, the company retains the same logo it used when it was first established in 1936. In 2018 MSE was purchased by Labtech International Limited, a supplier and service provider for scientific equipment, accessories and consumables based in Heathfield, East Sussex. In 2019, the decision was taken to move the company to France to remain competitive in the centrifuge industry. This decision was deemed necessary, due to the uncertain economic climate caused by Brexit. Operating out of France, MSE‚Äôs mission to be at the forefront of innovation in the centrifuge industry and remain leaders in the field remains unchanged.

On September 19, 2010, Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, used a webcam on his dorm-room computer and his hallmate Molly Wei's computer to view, without Clementi's knowledge, Clementi's kissing another man. Clementi eventually found out, after Ravi posted about the webcam incident on Twitter. Two days later, Ravi urged friends and Twitter followers to watch via his webcam a second tryst between Clementi and his friend, though the viewing never occurred. Ravi and Wei were federally indicted for their roles in the webcam incidents, though they were not charged with a role in the suicide itself. On May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution. Ravi went to trial in early 2012, and was convicted on May 21, 2012 on multiple charges related to the webcam viewing. After an appeals court overturned parts of the conviction, Ravi pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy on October 27, 2016. Clementi's death brought national attention to the issue of cyberbullying and the struggles facing LGBT youth. Background Clementi was born on December 19, 1991, in Ridgewood, New Jersey. A graduate of Ridgewood High School, he was a violinist; he played with the Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra and participated in the Bergen Youth Orchestra as concertmaster. A few days before leaving home to attend college at Rutgers, Clementi told his parents that he was gay. While his father supported him, Clementi said in an instant message to a friend that his mother had \\"basically completely rejected\\" him. In later interviews, Clementi's mother explained that she had been \\"sad\\" and \\"quiet\\" as she processed the information and that she \\"felt a little betrayed\\" that he had not previously confided in her that he was gay. She later noted that she had not been ready as a parent to publicly acknowledge having a gay son, partly because her evangelical church had taught that homosexuality was a sin. After their conversation, she said that she and Tyler cried, hugged, and said they loved each other. Jane Clementi said that she and Tyler spent the rest of the week together and spoke frequently on the phone when he was at Rutgers. According to his mother, Tyler seemed \\"confident\\" and \\"comfortable\\" after coming out and told her of having visited New York City with new friends. Ravi and Wei met while students at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North. Prior to arriving at Rutgers, Ravi tried to find information about his new roommate online. On Twitter, Ravi referred to having seen Clementi's communications on the Just Us Boys website, and tweeted \\"Found out my roommate is gay.\\" Clementi also researched his roommate and read postings on Ravi's Twitter page. After Ravi and Clementi moved in together, they rarely interacted or spoke. Ravi's text messages to friends described Clementi as shy and awkward. Clementi's online conversations and text messages referred to his amusement at Ravi's construction of a private changing area, but Clementi said he appreciated the fact that Ravi left him alone and did not force an excessively social atmosphere. Webcam incidents =First viewings= On the nights of September 19 and 21, Clementi had asked Ravi to use their room for those evenings. On the first occasion, Ravi met Clementi's male friend, and Clementi said that the two wanted to be alone for the evening. Ravi has stated that he was worried about theft and that he left the computer in a state where he could view the webcam stream due to those concerns. Other witnesses testified that Ravi said he also wanted to confirm that Clementi was gay. Ravi and Wei viewed the video stream via iChat for a few seconds, seeing Clementi and his guest kissing. Later, Wei turned on the camera for another view with four others in the room, though Ravi was not there. During this second viewing, Wei and others saw Clementi and his guest kissing with their shirts off and their pants on. On September 20, Clementi, who followed Ravi's Twitter account, read a message that Ravi sent a few minutes after the webcam viewing the previous day. Ravi wrote: \\"Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.\\" According to a Rutgers employee, at about 4 a.m. on September 21, Clementi sent an online request for a single room because his \\"roommate used webcam to spy on me.\\" =Second attempt= On September 21, Ravi posted text messages saying that there would be a viewing party to watch Clementi and his guest, along with directions on how to view it remotely. At 6:39 p.m., Ravi tweeted, \\"Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again.\\" Ravi had set up the webcam and pointed it towards Clementi's bed. When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode. The same day, Clementi complained to a resident assistant and two other officials that Ravi had used a webcam to stream part of Clementi's private sexual encounter with another man. The resident assistant testified at trial that Clementi appeared shaky and uncomfortable when they met around 11 p.m., and in his official report of the meeting, the resident assistant said that Clementi requested both a room change and punishment for Ravi. In a formal e-mail request to the resident assistant made after the meeting, Clementi described the two viewing incidents, quoted from Ravi's Twitter postings, and wrote \\"I feel that my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner.\\" Clementi wrote in detail on the Just Us Boys and Yahoo! message boards about complaints he filed through university channels about his roommate. His posts indicated that he did not want to share a room with Ravi after he learned about the first incident and then discovered that Ravi invited his Twitter followers to watch a second sexual encounter. \\"He [the resident assistant] seemed to take it seriously,\\" Clementi wrote in a post about 15 hours before his jump from the George Washington Bridge.See:    * Within a few hours, Clementi returned to his dorm room and he and Ravi were there for less than an hour. Suicide Clementi jumped from the George Washington Bridge and was found dead in the Hudson River. On the evening of September 22, Clementi left the dorm room, bought food from the campus food court, and, around 6:30 p.m., headed toward the George Washington Bridge. By 8:42 p.m. he had posted from his cell phone on Facebook: \\"Jumping off the gw bridge sorry.\\" Clementi left a suicide note which, along with documents on his computer, was never released to either the public or to the defense team in Ravi's trial, because Clementi's suicide was not directly related to the charges against Ravi. Clementi's wallet, car, cell phone, and computer were found on or near the bridge. His body was found on September 29, in the Hudson River just north of the bridge. The medical examiner gave drowning as the cause of death, noting blunt impact injuries to the torso as well. Reaction Shortly after Clementi's suicide, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network stated, \\"There has been heightened media attention surrounding the suicides in New Jersey, Texas, California, Indiana, and Minnesota.\\" The same month Clementi died, four other American teenagers were reported to have committed suicide after being taunted about their homosexuality, although the brother of one of the deceased said he did not believe the suicide was brought on by bullying. =At Rutgers University= Rutgers University students planned a \\"Black Friday\\" event to commemorate and memorialize Clementi. Rutgers president Richard Levis McCormick stated, \\"We grieve for him and for his family, friends and classmates as they deal with the tragic loss of a gifted young man....\\" Beginning in the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, a Rutgers University pilot program was instituted to permit students to choose their dorm roommates, regardless of gender. Members of the university's LGBT community told the administration that gender-neutral housing would help create a more inclusive environment for students. By September 2012, Rutgers had implemented numerous new programs to provide a more supportive environment for LGBT students, in reaction to the suicide, including new dormitory options and a new Center for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities, and students reported a much-improved campus atmosphere. =Charitable response= In 2011, Tyler Clementi's parents, Jane and Joseph Clementi, established the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which focuses on promoting acceptance of LGBT teens and others marginalized by society, providing education against all forms of bullying including cyber bullying over the internet and promoting research and development into the causes and prevention of teenage suicide. On March 9, 2011, the Point Foundation, the nation's largest scholarship-granting organization for LGBT students of merit, announced that it had created the Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship to honor Clementi's memory. Clementi's parents said they hoped the scholarship would \\"raise awareness of young people who are subject to abuse through malicious bullying.\\" In 2015, the Tyler Clementi Foundation launched #Day1, an anti-bullying campaign that aims to stop bullying before it begins, with support from Caitlyn Jenner, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Neil Patrick Harris, and others. =Government= Tyler Clementi's suicide, along with the suicides of several other gay teens who had been harassed, moved President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to express shock and sadness and speak out against any form of bullying.  US Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Rush Holt of New Jersey introduced federal legislation titled the \\"Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti- Harassment Act\\", to require schools that wish to receive federal funding to establish anti-bullying procedures and codes of conduct. Harvey Silverglate, working with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, has criticized that bill and similar legislation for what he considers to be the creation of rights that apply to some groups of persons but not to others. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie stated that the suicide was an \\"unspeakable tragedy... I don't know how those two folks [Ravi and Wei] are going to sleep at night\\" and added, \\"as the father of a 17-year-old, I can't imagine what those parents are feeling today‚ÄîI can't.\\" In response to Clementi's suicide and other, similar incidents, New Jersey General Assembly representatives Valerie Vainieri Huttle and Mary Pat Angelini introduced a bipartisan \\"Anti-bullying Bill of Rights\\" in November 2010, which passed on a 71‚Äì1 vote in the New Jersey Assembly and a 30‚Äì0 vote in the New Jersey Senate. The San Diego Unified School District Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution to provide a safe environment and equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning students. =Parents' statements= The day of the announcement of the verdict in the Dharun Ravi trial, Clementi's father, Joseph, released a statement, directed particularly at young people: In the same statement, Jane Clementi, Tyler's mother, noted the role that electronic media can have in singling out LGBT youth for being different. She said: =Advocacy= In the weeks following Clementi's suicide, schools around the area of his residence held vigils in memory of his death. Students at Hofstra University gathered for a candlelight vigil, and students and staff at Pascack Hills High School in Bergen County, near Ridgewood where Clementi lived, wore all black to mourn his death. The incident brought wider nationwide attention to bullying of LGBT youth. \\"Spirit Day\\", first observed on October 20, 2010, was established in which people wear the color purple to show support for bullying victims among LGBT youth. Clementi's suicide inspired the establishment of Spirit Day, and the day received widespread support from GLAAD, Hollywood celebrities and over 1.6 million Facebook users. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights advocacy organization, released a plan aimed at increasing awareness of gay-related suicide and harassment around the U.S. According to gay activist William Dobbs, around 10,000 people expressed support on social networking websites for lodging more serious criminal charges, such as manslaughter, against Ravi and Wei, a position that Dobbs himself criticized as a rush to judgment before an investigation had taken place. However, journalist Jason St. Amand has noted that \\"there are surprisingly several gay activists who are skeptical about the case and believe that Ravi is being used as a scapegoat and should receive a lesser sentence.\\" William Dobbs has criticized the use of hate crime charges and what he considers to have been a hurried scapegoating of Ravi and Wei. Journalist J. Bryan Lowder has similarly criticized hate-crime laws, arguing that Ravi's motives are difficult to know, and that Ravi should not be blamed for attitudes that are \\"pervasive in our culture\\". Dan Savage, co-founder of the It Gets Better Project, has written that, although he considers Ravi's actions to have been \\"the last straw\\" that triggered Clementi's suicide, he notes that Clementi's guest did not commit suicide, and concludes that there must have been additional factors, preceding the webcam incidents, contributing to the suicide. Savage says that he deplores the \\"mob mentality\\" that focuses on \\"a couple of stupid teenagers who should've known better but didn't.\\" He argues that attention should also be directed toward the \\"adults and institutions\\" in society who \\"perpetuate anti-gay prejudice\\", and he concludes that to \\"pin all the blame\\" on Ravi and Wei amounts to \\"a coverup\\". After Ravi was sentenced, Savage said he had been \\"express[ing] misgivings about the severity of the sentence that Ravi faced. But a 30 day sentence is far, far too lenient‚Äîa slap on the wrist.\\" Eric Marcus has compared his own father's suicide with Clementi's, and said that it will not be possible to know the real reasons for Clementi's suicide. He concluded that \\"At best, we can say that Ravi's spying and subsequent Twitter messages might have triggered Clementi's suicide, which is different from causing his suicide... We've turned Tyler Clementi into a two-dimensional symbol of anti-gay bullying and Dharun Ravi into a scapegoat. This is a case that screams out for compassion and understanding.\\" The Tyler Clementi Institute for Internet Safety, a legal institute to assist other victims of cyberbullying, was launched in October 2015. =Criticism of media coverage= Soon after invasion of privacy charges were brought against Ravi and Wei, gay advocacy groups and bloggers were vocal in their support for bringing hate-crime charges against the defendants. After the prosecutors issued a public statement that they were investigating whether bias played a role in the incident, according to Chris Cuomo of ABC News, a \\"media floodgate of distortion\\" ensued. Writing in The New Yorker, Ian Parker has stated that some of the media coverage and the public outcry against Ravi have exaggerated Ravi's role in the incident, writing that after Clementi's suicide \\"it became widely understood that a closeted student at Rutgers had committed suicide after video of him having sex with a man was secretly shot and posted online. In fact, there was no posting, no observed sex, and no closet.\\" =In popular culture= Ellen DeGeneres described herself as \\"devastated\\" by Clementi's death, stating, \\"Something must be done. This month alone, there has been a shocking number of news stories about teens who have been teased and bullied and then committed suicide... This needs to be a wake-up call to everyone: teenage bullying and teasing is an epidemic in this country, and the death rate is climbing.\\" The band Rise Against released a song, \\"Make It Stop (September's Children)\\", which mentions the names of Tyler Clementi and four other people who committed suicide in September 2010 after being bullied based on their sexual orientation. Madonna gave tribute to Clementi by showing a picture of him and other gay teens who have committed suicide during the Nobody Knows Me video interlude in the MDNA Tour. Canadian musician Owen Pallett released a song called \\"The Secret Seven\\" on his 2014 album In Conflict that addresses Clementi. Monica Lewinsky said that Clementi's story inspired her to speak out against cyberbullying, in a TED talk called The Price of Shame. Court case On September 28, 2010, Dharun Ravi and Molly Wei were each charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for the September 19 webcam transmission. Ravi was charged with two additional counts for the September 21 viewing attempt. On April 20, 2011, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with evidence, witness tampering, and hindering apprehension or prosecution. On May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution in exchange for her testimony against Ravi, 300 hours of community service, counseling, and classes on dealing with people of alternative lifestyles. On March 16, 2012, Ravi was convicted on all 15 counts for his role in the webcam spying incidents. On May 21, 2012, Ravi was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 3 years' probation, 300 hours of community service, a $10,000 fine, and counseling on cyberbullying and alternative lifestyles. Both the prosecutors and Ravi filed separate appeals. On June 18, 2012, Ravi was released from jail after 20 days of his sentence. Federal immigration authorities said that Ravi would not be deported to India. In February 2016, Ravi asked the courts to overturn his convictions following a 2015 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that struck down as unconstitutionally vague a part of the law under which he was charged. In September 2016, the convictions were overturned by an appeals court in New Jersey, in a decision supported by prosecutors because of the earlier ruling on constitutionality. A request to maintain the convictions for other crimes, such as invasion of privacy and witness tampering, was denied because of the influence bias allegations. Ravi accepted a plea deal on October 27, 2016, and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy, a third-degree felony. He was sentenced to time already served and fines paid, and the remaining charges against him were dropped.

The Port of P√≥voa de Varzim. The public garden of Pra√ßa do Almada, the civic center, around 1919. The history of P√≥voa de Varzim, Portugal, and its development as a maritime trade and fishing hub, have been greatly influenced by its location at the entrance to one of Portugal's best natural ports. Permanent settlement in the coastal plain of P√≥voa de Varzim dates back to around four to six thousand years ago; around 900 BC, unrest in the region led to the establishment of a fortified city. The ocean has played an important part in its popular culture and economy, through maritime trade and fishing, leading it to establish a fiefdom in the 10th or 11th century, a municipality in 1308 and to become, in the 18th century, the main fishing port in northern Portugal. P√≥voa de Varzim and its region had relevant input that allowed the Portuguese discoveries, throw manpower, shipbuilding and seafaring knowledge. Since the 18th century, its beaches have helped it become one of the main tourist areas of the region, which prompted high-culture development since the late 18th century. Its development suffered setbacks due to feudalism, monastic domain, border disputes and, recently, the development of a highly centralized state. However, it gained significant privileges confirmed by successive Portuguese kings such as town limit exception and royal appeal rights. Stone Age settlers Prehistory‚Äì900 B.C. Discoveries of Acheulean stone tools suggest P√≥voa de Varzim has been inhabited since the Lower Palaeolithic, around 200,000 BC. The earliest artifacts, dating to the Paleolithic, were found in Northern Aver-o-Mar, proving the strong attractiveness that the ocean played since very remote eras. The first groups of shepherds settled on the coast where P√≥voa de Varzim is now located between the 4th millennium and early 2nd millennium BC. Their dead were deposited in tumuli, which are the oldest monuments found in the municipality. The necropolis, with seven tumuli, dated to end of the Neolithic, early chalcolithic. Four around S√£o F√©lix Hill, all have been broken, and three around Cividade Hill, including Mamoa de Sej√£es, in the hillside, that is still unopened after thousands of years of settlement. Five of the known tumuli are still visible. There's also evidence of Stone Age painting in Cape Santo Andr√©. Castro culture urbanization and maritime trade 900‚Äì138 B.C. Decumanus street. The first granite buildings appeared in the 5th century B.C. The city developed with new technology and trade brought in by the Mediterranean cultures. Widespread pillaging by rival tribes led the resident populations of the coastal plain of P√≥voa de Varzim to raise a fortified town atop the hill that stood next to the sea. The city area covered and had several hundred inhabitants. The City prospered due to its strong defensive walls and its location near the ocean, which facilitated trade with the maritime civilizations of the Mediterranean Sea, especially during the Carthaginian dominion of the southern Iberian Peninsula. The city had some urbanization stages: during the first centuries, the small habitations were constructed with adobe mixed with vegetable additive. The first constructions made out of rock started to appear in the 5th century B.C., due to iron peaks technology that appeared in Asia Minor, brought to the Iberian Peninsula by Phoenician settlers in the Atlantic Coast during the 8th and 7th centuries B.C. Castro culture jewelry. Villa Mendo Treasure, similar to another one found in a clay pot in S√£o F√©lix Hill from probable funerary ritual. Replica, depository of original: MNSR. The visits of Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans had as porpoise the exchange of textiles and wine for gold and tin, despite the scarcity of terrestrial ways, this was not a problem for Cividade de Terroso that was strategically located next to the sea and by the Ave River, thus an extensive trade existed in the city.Autarcia e Com√©rcio em Bracara Augusta no per√≠odo Alto-Imperial The external commerce, dominated by tin, was complemented with domestic trade in tribal markets between the different cities and villages of the Castro culture, they exchanged textiles, metals (gold, copper, tin and lead) and handicrafts including exotic products, such as glass or exotic ceramics, brought from trading with the peoples of the Mediterranean or other areas of the Peninsula. The population worked in agriculture, fishing, gathering, shepherding and worked metals, textiles and ceramics. Cultural influences arrived from inland Iberian Peninsula, beyond the ones proceeding from the Mediterranean through trade. In the area of the modern city, ceramics surfaced during a highway construction in 1998 and walls were detected in 2002, the site may have been a Castro culture farmhouse.http://arqueologia.igespar.pt/index.php?sid=sitios.resultados&subsid;=59026 Roman conquest and Establishment of Varzim 138 B.C.‚Äì411 =Resistance and Roman conquest= Stele dedicated to the popular god Mars. Mars was identified with Cosus, the prominent pre-Roman god in coastal Castro region. During the Punic Wars, the Romans became aware of the Castro region's rich deposits of gold and tin. Viriathus, leading Lusitanian troops, hindered the expansion of the Roman Republic north of the river Douro. His murder in 138 BC opened the way for the Roman legions. Over the following two years, Decimus Junius Brutus advanced into the Castro region from south of the Douro, crushed the tribal armies, and left Cividade de Terroso in ruins, by burning the city to the ground. A celebrated milestone refers that Brutus victories extended to the ocean. Appian mentioned two battles led by Brutus, in which women fought alongside the men and both ended in Roman victory. Archaeological data in the site and tribesmen's Last stand behavior, highlight the barbarity of the conquest. =Brutus settlements= Proclaimed Roman mercy comes throw the establishment of Brutus's peaceful settlements. Soon after the conquest and under Roman reform, the Cividade was rebuilt. In the shoreline, Villa Euracini and fish factories were constructed. The Castro people returned to the coastal plain and a gradual abandonment of the hill started as the region was pacified under Caesar Augustus's Pax Romana. In time, Villa Euracini would evolve to P√≥voa de Varzim. Representation of a Roman fish factory. Around Villa Euracini's natural harbors, the fish industry developed. The cetari√¶, a Roman fish factory was built for the production of garum, a fish sauce condiment. The factory had 2,40 m wide and deep tanks near the seashore, surrounded by houses, one of which probably dating to the 1st century and more recent buildings. A waterfront Roman road linked the area to Foz do Douro, to the south, and Caminha to the north. Another fish processing factory and salt evaporation ponds existed in Junqueira, near the core of Villa Euracini, where remains of buildings and a number of artifacts, including vases were found. These ruins could be older than those found in Alto de Martim Vaz. In the Old town of P√≥voa de Varzim, the probable core of Roman Villa Euracini, vestiges of buildings, called aedificia, and ceramics also surfaced. Aqualata, A Roman mining complex, was created at the steps of S√£o F√©lix Hill, just north of Cividade de Terroso. The site is preserved as a small lake known as Lagoa Negra, the Black Lake. Before the Roman conquest, it is thought that the tribesmen also mined it, and the notorious Castro culture jewelry found scattered in P√≥voa de Varzim is stated to have been mined there. These mines were intensively exploited during the Roman period and may have been the reason why the Via Veteris, a Roman road, crossed the coastal area. Cape Santo Andr√©, a religious site, is the ancient Roman Auarius Promontorium referred by Ptolemy and with visible Romanization, the importance of the site, possibly, predated the Roman period. Archaeological data indicate the existence of a necropolis dating from the Roman period in the area of Giesteira. Remains of this necropolis were also found in the nearby area of Paredes, including Roman tegula.http://arqueologia.igespar.pt/index.php?sid=sitios.resultados&subsid;=2375662 A legendary foundation of P√≥voa de Varzim stated that the town was established by a Roman consul named Cayo Varzinio (Caius Varzinius), giving his name to the town. This myth appeared by the 19th century and promptly disputed by researchers in the 19th and early 20th century.  Barbarian, Moor and Norse invasions 411‚Äì1033  =Germanic settlements and the arrival of the Moors= 11th/12th century art in the Monastery of Rates. A 1st century Roman stele Christianized around the 4th or 5th century could show hints of the Suebic period. With the fall of the Roman Empire, Suebi populations established themselves in the region. City quarters and former hamlets around Villa Euracini suggest Germanic naming, such as Regufe (from Rekaufus, rek- + wulf, 'wolf'), Argivai (from Argivadi) and Gresufes (from Grisulfus, possibly Gothic *gris- 'horror' and wulfs, 'wolf'). It was also believed that Varzim itself, due to its Germanic influence, started as a Germanic settlement, until archaeological finds expanded the settlement to the Roman period. The Germanic people were obliged to settle mostly in rural areas. Idacius (c. 400 ‚Äì c. 469) is very explicit in this \\"the Hispanic, spread around the cities and oppida...\\" and the \\"Barbarians, rule over the provinces...\\" (HYDACE: I, ¬ß 49, pp. 117‚Äì119). The Suebic kingdom of Gallaecia was incorporated as a province into the Visigothic one in 585. After the Moorish conquest of Hispania, since 711, the region maintained a significant share of its population, in a social and political area where there was no acting state powers. This Christian region that kept the structure of the Roman and Roman-Germanic past was reorganized as the County of Portugal, a government in the Kingdom of Galicia (Kingdom of Asturias), later known as Kingdom of Le√≥n. =The Viking raids= Boat identified as Norman sculpted in the church of Rio Mau Monastery. The first Norman incursion occurred in 844 by a group of Danish Vikings, who after being defeated near the Tower of Hercules, looted all the coast reaching the south of the peninsula, then under Moorish rule, they returned north and vanished after passing by Faro, Beja, and Lisbon. According to Ibn Hayyan and other sources, they returned to Gallaecia and eventually settled there. A second huge attack, with plundering all over the coast, occurred in 859. Due to pillaging and the destruction of everything they found, the Vikings were seen as a worse threat to Hispania than the Moors. P√≥voa de Varzim was first mentioned on March 26, 953 during the rule of Mumadona Dias, Countess of Portugal between 924 and around 950. The countess ordered the construction of the Guimar√£es Castle in order to protect a Monastery against attacks by the \\"gentiles\\", reporting to the Normans, the Vikings. Instigated by the Duke of Normandy, there is a powerful incursion in 968 using a fleet of 100 ships led by the Viking Gundered (Gudr√∏d), considered by them as the King of the Sea (s√¶konungr in old Norse). They landed in a seaport named Juncariae and from there they went to Iria Flavia, destroying hamlets and villages. They kept in there for a year, when their petty king and a good share of the attackers fell against the army led by the Galician count Gon√ßalo Sanches in 970. Capital depicting warriors in the monastic church of Rio Mau (1151) in the Lordship of Varzim. The Normans attacked again in 984, 1016, 1018 and 1050. Various chronicles and documents suggest an incursion in Entre-Douro-e-Minho in 1008, which may have provoked the death of the Portuguese count, Mendo Gon√ßalves. In the Norman incursion of 1015‚Äì1016, the Monastery of Vair√£o was sacked. Located in the South of the Ave River, the monastery hold and recorded events in the region since 921. In 1016, inland Vermoim Castle suffered a bloody assault, by Norman pirates, in which the Portuguese count Alvito Nunes was killed. In P√≥voa de Varzim their incursions went from the coast to the Este River, and the Ave River established as the south limit. Various hints indicate a Norse settlement in Villa Euracini after those invasions came to an end. During the Middle Ages, the name Euracini evolved to Uracini, Vracini, Veracini, Verazini, Verazim, and eventually Varazim. =Clash of civilizations and the border lordships= Arriving from the south, in 997, the region was probably sacked by the Moorish troops of Al-mansur, after his conquest of the Aguiar de Sousa Castle in 995, the Christian realms suffered a setback and a new border with the short-lived Caliphate of C√≥rdoba (929 ‚Äì 1031) is drawn at the Douro River, creating political chaos, the weakening of the County's power, the expansion of power of the feudal lordships of the region and transformations, before and after the attack, that questioned the authority of the Kingdom of Le√≥n, especially after the reign of Alfonso V and Bermudo III of Leon. In the frontline against the Moorish-dominanted lands were the lordships of Maia (bordering the Lordship of Varzim across the Ave river), Sousa, Bai√£o, and Ribadouro whom solidified their power between the Ave and the Douro. The Lords of Sousa and Ribadouro lead the independence of Portugal from external subordination since the government of countess Mumadoma Dias up to the establishment of the kingdom of Portugal. Feudalism and municipalism 1033‚Äì1318 Dores Square in the Old Town of Varzim. The main church being demolished in 1910 for urbanistic reasons, as it was thought not to be significant due to historical adulteration. It then became clear it was of medieval foundation, dating to the height of Varzim's feudal period. The old stones were reused to build a new nearby church, while the Romano-Gothic arch is preserved in the city's museum. =A great lordship emerges= In the 11th century, Guterre Pelayo, said to have been born in Gascony, come from France with count Henry and became the Lord of Varzim. According to the Livro Velho de Linhagens, the ancient book of nobility compiled by 1270, he got from the count the port of Varzim amongst several other possessions. Guterre and his son, Payo Guterres, were decisive captains during the Reconquista. This grant is contested by the reputable Medievalist Almeida Fernandes who claimed that the grant is older, from 1033, and the fief was granted to another Guterre Pelayo, an ancestor of those, by Bermudo III, the Emperor in Gallaecia and reigning from S√£o Jo√£o de Rei, in P√≥voa de Lanhoso, Portugal. Ancient sources also claimed that Guterre Pelayo was the third grandson of Fruela II of Le√≥n. According to documents from 1198, 1203, and 1206, P√≥voa de Varzim, then named Villa Verazin (Town of Varzim), was a powerful fiefdom with a territory extending from the coast to the Cividade de Terroso and Lanudos hills in the lands of Bracara.Estudos de Cronologia: Os mais antigos documentos escritos em portugu√™s - Instituto Cam√µes One of the great-grandsons of the later Guterre Pelayo, Louren√ßo Fernandes da Cunha was one of the knights that in 1176, with Prince Sancho, attacked Seville, an Islamic city in the south of the Peninsula, returning with good spoils of war. He had great wealth in Villa Verazim and bought several houses and lands in town, including half of one property near his palace and inherited 16 properties in Varzim, 7.5 in Cunha and some others around the kingdom from his relative Gon√ßalo Ramires. In the area of Veracim dos Cavaleyros (Knights' Varzim), that was the core of the knights honor, he stated he had two palaces for his sons and grandsons. =Ravages and seized lands= Sancho, as king of Portugal, disliked the power Dom Louren√ßo got, whose dominions was located not only in Varzim and Cunha, but expanded throw several lands in the kingdom and his family conspired against the king, as such the king ordered the destruction of several of his properties, including 10 of the 17 properties of Varzim and his tower in Cunha. The king took over the land, destroyed the properties and expelled the farmers. Fierce disputes between the early Portuguese kings and the local overlords over the Port of Varzim and the town's lands lead to ravages and the establishment of the municipality in 1308. In the 1220 inquiries, in the established Royal Land of Varzim or Lower Varzim, a royal butler area, there were 20 families, who gave to the king, when he came into town, 6 dinheiros for the stay; and by royal charter, if they did not went to the sea on Friday, they paid 5 mealhas (small copper coin with little value); and paid from the fisheries, the nav√£o (one fish for each boat). Those who were not fishermen, gave 2 soldos to the king once a year. Knights Varzim had properties of the Knights Hospitaller, who inherited the wealth of the local overlords, and properties from religious orders, mostly from the monasteries of S. Cristov√£o de Rio Mau and S. Sim√£o da Junqueira, founded by Payo Guterres, grandfather of Dom Louren√ßo. There were 81.5 properties in the Royal Land, Argivai and Giesteira alone, 51 were owned by the king, 25.5 by the military and religious orders, 5 belonged to the church and one, Quintela, was privately owned. During the reign of Sancho II of Portugal, and while the king was disputing the throne with his brother, Afonso, who was invited by the knights to take over the Portuguese throne, Gavi√£o of Varzim used the opportunity to destroy the king's assets in Lower Varzim. According to a 1258 chronic, he entered in the king's property, in a violent way, which was several times built and improved, destroying it significantly in such a way that no bread could be sowed, nor a car could cross that place as it often used to do. The knight left throw Bo√≠do Lagoon, currently Pra√ßa do Almada, the border with Knights Varzim. The damage was so significant that when Sancho II was overthrown and Afonso became the King of Portugal he ordered the Judge of Faria, Martinho Martins, to resettle the royal land, only managed to get settlers for 15 of the 20 farming properties, as these feared the knights. The king's chronicler explicitly stated that all of the port of Varzim was property of Lord the King. =Municipality established= One of the sons of Dom Louren√ßo was Gomes Louren√ßo, very influential knight and godfather of King Denis. Dom Gomes, as it is deduced from his personal 1290 Inquiries, took advantage of his relationship with important people in order to get the recognition of the seaport of Varzim, located in Royal Land of Varzim, as his honor. He tried to convince King Denis, that the King's father, Afonso III, took it from him unfairly. In this way, Gomes and his descendants, who are part of the honor of Varzim (honrra de Veracim), went to the seaport and got the nav√£o from the fishermen, justifying the attitude with the honor. Prior to that, Gomes and King Denis had disputes resolved in favor of the King by the ecclesiastical court of Braga in 1285. In 1308, King Denis granted a charter (known in Portugal as a Foral), giving the royal land to 54 families of Varzim;. these had to establish a medieval settlement known as P√≥voa in the Royal land, the inhabitants should group as neighbors of this municipality, with the election of a judge, a community tax of 250 pounds and with seaport rights. Some of the name of the 54 family patriarchs are still today surnames in the fisher community. Of those 54 families, 42 worked in fisheries and the remaining 12 were farmers. Despite the taxes being reasonably high, the charter granted autonomy to the community, avoiding being subject to feudal domain and the royal butler, leading to the development of the town. A foral's clause stated that the settlers, that docked barges and boats, with bread, wine, salt or sardines unloaded in the seaport of P√≥voa de Varzim, should give for each barge or boat, 7 soldos. These were the customs rights that belonged to the King and substituted the nav√£o. Monastic domain 1318‚Äì1514 The abbesses of Santa Clara Monastery taxed P√≥voa between 1319 and 1514 and tense relations with the town arose. In 1312, King Denis donated the town to his bastard son, Afonso Sanches, Lord of Albuquerque, who included it in the patrimony of the Convent of Santa Clara in 1318, which he had just founded in Vila do Conde. Afonso Sanches stated that he gave ¬´Our villas and hamlets that are known as Povoa de Varzim, and all our large farms of Touginha and Veerjz and the ones in Tarroso, Formarjz, Land√µo, Nabaaes and Miranei, with families and large farms (...). But we retain for us and the ones that will come after us the justice and appeals of Varzim¬ª. P√≥voa was then in the jurisdictional dependency of the monastery, excepting in the appealing processes.As Prociss√µes na P√≥voa de Varzim (1900‚Äì1950). Volume 1 - Deolinda Carneiro, Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto. 2006 Ancient map of the towns of P√≥voa de Varzim and Vila do Conde. The Port of P√≥voa de Varzim is also represented. King Afonso IV in his 1343 inquiries wanted to know the wealth of the religious orders. The abbess of the monastery presented a big letter in which it is stated, in Latin, that King Denis gave, to Afonso Sanches, Lower Varzim, and its royal charter valuing 250 pounds were property of the monastery. The abbess would have no rights over Upper Varzim (or Knights' Varzim), of the Order of Malta, nor the families of the king. Certain scholars noted that the donation could be from 1305, thus prior to the royal charter. In 1367, King Ferdinand I confirmed the charters, privileges and uses of P√≥voa de Varzim. These were again confirmed by John I in 1387. Five year earlier, the same king confirmed the jurisdiction of the Count of Neiva over P√≥voa, the attribution date is unknown. However, by the royal charter of February 17, 1466, it was determined by King Afonso V that no powerful person could enter in the neighboring towns of P√≥voa de Varzim and Vila do Conde. The domain of the monastery grew stronger over the town of P√≥voa de Varzim, and harmful to Povoans. When the Knight's over-lordship ended, the abbess took the initiative to send an ouvidor (listener) to confirm the Povoan judge, to judge the appeals, and taking the customs taxes, but only wanted 4$000 r√©is of the 5$000 rs. that the town hall had to pay according to the royal charter. Tense relations with the monastery developed and Povoans repetitively asked King Manuel I to end the situation and being incorporated in the crown. On the other hand, the abbesses were supported by influential families, the fishermen spontaneously offered soles to the abbesses when they fished it and the people willingly took the icon of Our Lady of Varzim in a procession to the monastery, as the Lady of Varzim was popular in several parishes. In 1514, King Manuel I gave a new charter to P√≥voa de Varzim, in which the financial part of the ancient royal charter was changed and created new mechanisms for the jurisdiction of the monastery. In 1517, the monastery was reformed by the friar Francisco Lisboa, nominated by papal bull in 1515, according to requests by king Manuel I. The Abbess Joana de Meneses resisted and was obliged to move to another convent. Besides the town hall and public square, the town also got a pillory, and involved itself in the Portuguese discoveries. The pillory had the armillary sphere of King Manuel I, a symbol of the discoveries. In 1537, P√≥voa de Varzim was incorporated in the Crown, and grouped in comarca do Porto, a shire, getting with this event full autonomy. Shipbuilders and seafarers 1514‚Äì1707 The popularity of Madre de Deus Chapel was used to recruit men for seafaring activities. =Famed shipbuilders and seamen= In the 16th century, the fishermen started to work in maritime activities, as pilots or seafarers in the crew of the Portuguese ships, due to their high nautical knowledge. The fishermen of the region are known to fish in Newfoundland since, at least, 1506. During this period, the main professions were farmer, seafarer, sailor, pilot, carpenter and Ribeira carpenter (shipbuilder). During the reign of John III the Povoan shipmaking art was already renowned, and Povoan carpenters were sought after by Lisbon's Ribeira das Naus shipyard due to their high technical skills. The single floored houses dominated the town's landscape, but there are indications of multiple floored habitations with rich architecture. The seafarers' social class, well- off gentlemen, is associated with this richer architecture such as Amador Alvares, a pilot of the route of India, or pilots Pedro Fernandes, Diogo Pyz de S√£o Pedro, Louren√ßo Dias among others. This bourgeoisie was the great owner of most real estate around Pra√ßa Velha square, that the population saw as the urban area. There was a chapel around Pra√ßa Velha, known as Madre de Deus chapel, built before 1521 by the nobleman Jo√£o Gomes Gaio, father of the knight Jo√£o Martins Gaio, the later was part of the maritime trade of Vila do Conde. The chapel became the most popular temple in town. And by being established in P√≥voa civic center he could easily recruit men for seafaring activities. This noble family was responsible for the benefits P√≥voa gained during this period. Notable Povoan seafarers getting their wealth during this period includes Ant√≥nio Gon√ßalves in the Route of Brazil, Diogo Pires de S√£o Pedro in the Route of Angola, Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s in the Route of India. However, some seafarers birthplace is not possible to be determined due to lack of records, some could only be associated with the town throw their surnames, nicknames or death records. Gomes Martins de Faria, mostly known as Gomes Martins da P√≥voa, was the owner and captain of an 80-tuns carrack of the Route of S√£o Tom√©, which became a warship in order to defend from French corsairs, he gained significant wealth and founded S√£o Sebasti√£o Chapel (c.1582) in P√≥voa de Varzim, and became the ordinary judge (mayor) in 1584 and 1587. Diogo Dias de S√£o Pedro, mayor in 1599, was the captain of the warship N.S.Guadalupe, built in the Port of P√≥voa de Varzim, in order to recapture Pernambuco from the Dutch. Ant√≥nio Cardia, captain-major of the Portuguese armada, who recaptured Bahia from the Dutch in 1624. One of the oldest streets in P√≥voa bears the name of Amadinha to this day, which according to the local legend, was a black slave woman loved by a marine captain, who when he died left all his wealth to her. In the 16th century registries, the year 1559 represented a peak in seafarers deaths. Most occurred in the Route of the Antilles, in the West Indies. Other routes common to the Povoan seafarers included S√£o Tom√©, Flanders, the islands, Lisbon, and Alicante. At the turn of the 17th century, with the union with Castile, most deaths were concentrated in the West Indies, Seville, Peru, and the Indies. The Spanish kings favored the free movement of the people and Seville got filled with Portuguese, some of whom Povoans, to such an extent that the Portuguese language, in some streets, was more common than Castillian, and other lands of the New World, such as the Gulf of Mexico, were open to the Portuguese merchants. =Shipbuilding boom and urban expansion= In the 17th century, the shipbuilding industry boomed in Ribeira shipyard, area around P√≥voa fortress in the sheltered bay, and one-third of the population had some relation with this activity, building ships for the merchant navigation. The carpenter profession became the main one and was followed by the fishermen and farmers. in the end of the century, gold is discovered in Brazil, which led to an increase in emigration to these new lands. Until the 17th century, fisheries were not very developed. Then the brine preservation business transformed P√≥voa into the biggest fish market in northern Portugal, supplying even the inland provinces. The 17th century was important for the organization of P√≥voa de Varzim. On the civil level there was the electoral reform of 1612, the fiscal reform of 1656 with the Foral de Sisas, the annexation of Aver-o-Mar, and the dispute with the house of Braganza due to the town's borders. During this period there was a relevant urban expansion: the Pra√ßa civic center with the town hall and the Madre Deus Chapel, the area of the old town (Vila Velha) where the Main church was located and the fishermen neighborhood of Junqueira was starting its affirmation as a new urban center. At religious level, associations of religious character started appearing, the institution of the Holly Week celebrations and the enlargement of the Main Church, located in the old town's Lugar da Mata. Ribeira shipyard in the Port of P√≥voa de Varzim, was where the shipbuilding and fisher activities developed. =Territorial disputes with the House of Braganza= The town limit between the town of P√≥voa de Varzim and the county of Barcelos (controlled by the House of Braganza) was a dispute which started in the 16th century. The border of the county of Barcelos entered the urban area of P√≥voa de Varzim. In the royal charters, by King Denis and confirmed by King Manuel I, P√≥voa had town limit exception and the right of appeal to the Crown, what were seen as significant privileges. The town limit exception became an issue when P√≥voa was annexed to Comarca do Porto in the middle of the 16th century, becoming a municipal enclave in Minho province surrounded by lands of the House of Braganza. The Northern and Eastern border with Barcelos were the reason for most of the disputes, as these were areas already significantly settled, especially G√¢ndara and the Old Town of P√≥voa de Varzim. As such, P√≥voa de Varzim considered that its territory was that of medieval Villa Euracini (Town of Varzim). age of gunpowder, Castelo da P√≥voa was fully rebuilt due to privateer attacks. In medieval documents, preserved by the Monastery of Vair√£o, it was stated that Varzim stretched from the sea to Cividade Hill (subtus mons Civitas Terroso), the S√£o F√©lix Hill (subtus mons Lanudos), the Este river and further. The expression \\"subtus mons\\", characteristic in the Portuguese medieval documents, was proved by Ferreira de Almeida that it is an administrative and military dependency. The Honour of Varzim included estates in areas such as Argivai, Laundos, Terroso, and Rio Mau. According to Barcelos, that considered itself to had primacy in the region, only Lower Varzim, the Royal land, was part of the municipality of P√≥voa de Varzim. Lower Varzim was the south of P√≥voa de Varzim Parish. However, the parish was not of the same size as the fiscal area. The Our Lady of Varzim Church located in the old town, which became the fish church of the vicarship, was outside of those borders. The Town Hall of P√≥voa de Varzim also got from the Braga chapter house the \\"Judge of the Church\\" rights extending its jurisdiction in areas outside the civil border. In P√≥voa de Varzim's Corpus Christi procession, the clergymen of several parishes were obliged to participate since 1591 by the archbishop. In 1694, the border dispute between the town halls of P√≥voa de Varzim and Barcelos reached a climax and is taken to court. In 1707, by royal decree, the Corregedor Gaspar Cardoso marked the boundaries of the town of P√≥voa de Varzim, expanding it to the north and east (from then on including the suburbs of the Old town, Alto de Martim Vaz, Barreiros, and G√¢ndara and the demarcation of the House of Braganza was considered invalid for these areas. The golden age of fishing 1707‚Äì1892 =Preeminent fishermen and urban renewal= View of the sheltered bay and the Fisher quarter in c.1836 with the Lapa Lighthouse and church visible in the background. Fishing boats in the port. Fishermen's living conditions. circa 1900 to 1915. In the beginning of the 18th century, there is a decline in the Ribeira shipyard activities, due to the aggradation of the Portuguese coast and the Povoan shipyard started to work in the construction of fishing vessels. There was a significant increase of the fisher community in the middle of the century, becoming the main activity, and during the reign of Joseph I with the country in the middle of an economic crisis, P√≥voa started a rapid development. This development was due to the fisher activities originated, mostly, from protectionist laws by the kingdoms of Portugal and Spain. The fish that supplied the national market was, since the 16th century, imported from Galicia. It is during this period that several churches were built and the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia was created. The Nossa Senhora da Lapa Brotherhood, founded in 1761 by the fishermen, got a charter in which they got authorization to build their homes in \\"ch√£os da areia\\", giving rise to a new and planned fisher quarter. City Hall in the mid-19th century. In the Memorias economicas da Academia real das sciencias de Lisboa (Economic memories of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon) it states that the fishermen of P√≥voa de Varzim are the most attendable of all the Minho coast, and were the most experts and with most practice from Cape St. Vincent to Caminha, with a sizable number of fishermen, ships and fishing devices, and the result is a very considerable quantity of caught fish, stating that \\"The fishermen of P√≥voa de Varzim are always at sea, they are not happy with coastal fisheries, and they get fish from seas, that are ten or twelve leagues away from the town.\\" In 1789, there were 1340 fishermen. P√≥voa had 900 houses, mostly of fishermen and the few remaining were mechanical jobs. The corregedor Almada, by the royal provision of 1791 by Queen Maria I, restructured the urbanization of P√≥voa de Varzim, creating the New Square where a new monumental city hall was built, the Coelheiro Aqueduct was raised to supply freshwater to the civic center, the Casas da Cadeia, Rio Novo, and Rua Nova das Trempes were built. Queen Maria I also turned P√≥voa into a headquarters of a Juiz de Fora, an itinerant magistrate. One of the caught fish inventory by Povoans noticed that, for instance, for the year of 1866, the product of transactions made in P√≥voa, directly by the fishermen and fish traders, summed up 230 000$000 r√©is and the result of the fish sold from Caminha to Figueira da Foz valued 180 000$000 r√©is. The taxes paid in the fiscal station was of 5000$000 r√©is. Yearly P√≥voa supplied the city of Porto with 1600 barrels of sardine and over 3000 loads of fish. However, the number of loads to Minho, Tr√°s-os-Montes, and Beira Alta was inestimable. It was said that \\"the people who know P√≥voa are sure that if, in any statistical map, could be truly accounted the importance of exported fish to those provinces, not much people would believe in it, because they would be marveled.¬ª = Late 19th century fishing crisis = Late 19th century was tragic for Povoan fishermen due to over-fishing by vapors authorized by the national government, namely with small mesh nets that caught even young fish. The once abundant fish became rare in such a way that serious social problems emerged and lead to the emigration of the fishermen. On February 27, 1892, a tragedy devastated the community. Seven lanchas poveiras wrecked in a storm and 105 fishermen were killed, just meters off the shore. The Beautiful Era 1725‚Äì1974 =Healing baths, gambling and high-culture= Since 1725, the iodine-rich seawaters of P√≥voa, due to the peculiar high quantities of seaweed, from the outlying kelp forests, that end up in P√≥voa beaches, brought by ocean currents, lead that Benedictine monks choose to take sea-baths in P√≥voa, in search of iodine (considered reinvigorating) and diving and sunbathing as a cure for skin and bone concerns. Some years later, but still in the 18th century, other people went to P√≥voa with the same concerns.Projecto para a Constru√ß√£o de Pavilh√µes na Praia da P√≥voa (Maio a Junho de 1924) - Arquivo Municipal da P√≥voa de Varzim (2008) Largo do Caf√© Chin√™s, one of the several gambling venues in 19th-century P√≥voa. Since the 19th century, the touristic activity became even more significant especially among the wealthiest classes from the Entre-Douro-e-Minho province and wealthy Portuguese-Brazilians, the city took a cosmopolitan character, leading to the affirmation of the bourgeoisie in P√≥voa de Varzim City Center and the development of entertainment venues. Several hotels, theaters and casinos opened. P√≥voa de Varzim flourished culturally. It then became renowned for its refined literary culture, artistic patronage in music and theater, and intellectual tertulia. It then became the most popular holiday destination in Northern Portugal,\\"P√≥voa de Varzim.\\" (in Portuguese) Grande Enciclop√©dia Universal (2004), vol. 16, pp. 10683-10684, Durclub P√≥voa was not just known as a beach resort, but also for heated saltwater public baths, the \\"Banhos Quentes\\". the first public bath of P√≥voa was Oceania which opened in Avenida dos Banhos, with entrance by Rua do Ramalh√£o, 13. After Oceania, the Balne√°rio Povoense opened in Rua Tenente Valadim, near the present-day Casino, and the Balne√°rio Lusitano in Passeio Alegre. Currently, there is still the belief that seawater has health healing effects, especially during low tide. There are popular sayings such as \\"When the tide is low, take a bath and go to bed or When the tide is low, wash your sore and it will be healed\\". In 1876, it was estimated that the town's waters attracted from 24 to 30 thousand visitors. In 1876, Pinho Leal, a historian who studied Portugal in the finest of details, stated that tourism and fisheries transformed P√≥voa de Varzim from a small village-like town into one of the most beautiful, prosperous and settled towns of Portugal. It was then one of the prime towns of Portugal, and, in all regards, far superior to many cities in the kingdom. King Charles Albert of Sardinia arrived in P√≥voa on April 18, 1849, coming from Italy with other four important people, coming in exile after losing the Battle of Novara and abdicated in favor of his son Victor Emmanuel, who would later become the first king of a unified Italy. =Napoleonic invasion= During the Napoleonic Wars and under the grand strategy Napoleon drafted, which included the invasion of Portugal using the corps of French Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, the fortress of P√≥voa de Varzim and that of Vila do Conde, in close proximity, were taken by French troops in late March 1809, as there were few troops in the region. The French control of the towns of P√≥voa de Varzim and Vila do Conde lasted for almost two months. In May, Soult retreated throw the Mar√£o and Ger√™s massifs, escaping the Anglo-Portuguese forces. =The territorial expansion of 1836= Coat of Arms of P√≥voa de Varzim with the anchor representing safety at sea as the main symbol. Despite being an historical town with significant autonomy, P√≥voa only recovered most of its medieval territory with the 1836 administration reforms, as it gained parishes (par√≥quias) that were bounded to Barcelos, and from then on became civil parishes (par√≥quias civis or freguesias): Balasar, Estela, La√∫ndos, Navais, Terroso, Outeiro Maior, Parada, Rio Mau, Santag√µes, and what remained from the parish of Argivai. It also annexed Rates township, which was extinct. However, Amorim and Beiriz, in the outskirts of P√≥voa de Varzim were annexed to Vila do Conde, by the middle of the lands of P√≥voa. Due to this, P√≥voa started numerous complaints. By the intermediation of the Member of Parliament Jos√© Fortunato Ferreira de Castro a representation was signed to the Court in the session of May 22, 1837. But the claims of P√≥voa were not met. In 1842, the representation of the city hall of P√≥voa de Varzim in the District's Geral Junta applied for the annexation of the civil parishes of Amorim and Beiriz, offering in exchange the ones of Outeiro Maior, Parada, and Santag√µes. In 1849, the city hall deliberated again to take the issue to the national parliament, for the second time. Along with the annexation of Amorim and Beiriz, its main concerns, it also applied for the parishes of Touginh√≥ and Arcos because these were located north of the Este river. By the reforms of December 31, 1853, it exchanged Outeiro Maior, Parada and Santag√µes for Amorim and Beiriz with neighboring Vila do Conde, thus solving its main concerns. However, against its wishes, Rio Mau was transferred to Vila do Conde and Balasar to Vila Nova de Famalic√£o. In 1854, the City Hall of P√≥voa de Varzim applied for Balasar and Rio Mau to be returned, and applied, once more, for the annexation of Touginh√≥ and Arcos that were in Vila do Conde. On the other hand, Vila do Conde applied for the annexation of Argivai and Rates, and even organized a petition for the annexation of P√≥voa, in order to establish a unified city, part of an idea supported by important people from both towns. The suggested name for the city was Mindello, honoring the landing of Liberal forces (the Bravos do Mindelo) during the Liberal Wars, an event that was still fresh in the memories of most at the time, which led to protests by the city hall of P√≥voa de Varzim given the fact that, by then, P√≥voa was significantly larger and doubled the number of houses that Vila do Conde had. After two years, P√≥voa recovered Balasar that was transferred to Vila Nova de Famalic√£o. While the historical territorial disputes with Barcelos ended, territorial disputes with Vila do Conde started, with P√≥voa de Varzim claiming land in Vila do Conde proper, most notably Po√ßa da Barca, located in the Port of P√≥voa de Varzim and settled by Povoans. =Early republicanism and restoration of the monarchy= In 1890, the return of the Jesuit power represented by the construction of the Cora√ß√£o de Jesus Basilica and the British Ultimatum in Africa created a republican sentiment amongst local intellectuals. The Julgado of P√≥voa became a comarca (shire) on June 16, 1875. Despite that P√≥voa did not beneficed much from the Liberal Regime. P√≥voa de Varzim was activelly involved in the Republican revolt of January 31, 1891 due to the 1890 British Ultimatum in Africa, with the actions of Rocha Peixoto, and the population sheltered and organized the flee to Spain, in a Poveiro boat, to Alves da Veiga. In that morning and while in Porto, Rocha Peixoto wrote a manifest for the people and, above all, workers; as a distraction tool for the Municipal Guard. In the previous night, in P√≥voa's Caf√© Sui√ßo, some local intellectuals celebrated the upcoming revolution with Madeira wine.NOBRE, Augusto ‚Äì Rocha Peixoto.

Povoan elite, including Republicans and Freemasons, encouraged popular demonstrations against the Jesuits, specifically the 1901 demonstration, by believing the Jesuits were responsible for the ignorance and beliefs of the people. Laborers and craftsmen, with republican ideas, were responsible for most riots. Despite those events,As Prociss√µes na P√≥voa de Varzim (1900‚Äì1950). Volume 1 - Deolinda Carneiro, Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto the establishment of the republic in 1910 was controversial to the local society. The hostilities between republicans and monarchists became more serious in 1917 and the Monarchy was declared as restored in P√≥voa on January 20, 1919, a day after it was declared in Porto. An event that became known as Monarchy of the North. The insurgency lasted until February 13, 1919.Em√≠lia N√≥voa Faria proferiu confer√™ncia no Arquivo Municipal - CMPV =The coming of the railroads and new highways= The Pra√ßa in 1909 - the Marqu√™s de Pombal market square.

The end of the 19th century and early 20th century were important for transportation and the organization of P√≥voa de Varzim and the development was stimulated by P√≥voa de Varzim's importance in tourism and high-culture. The first urbanization project in the waterfront was created in 1891. National highways linking the city to Barcelos, Famalic√£o and Viana do Castelo opened. Private investors financed railways linking the city to Porto in 1875 and Lower Minho Region in 1878.Breve Hist√≥ria dos Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses The local urbanization plan (Plano Geral de Melhoramentos) drafted in 1920 was a reference for early 20th century Portugal. =Estado Novo: Povoans as a stereotype for the Portuguese= Avenida dos Banhos in the mid-20th century. Salazar appreciated P√≥voa de Varzim and its people. He popularized Cego do Maio all over Portugal, by a text in the schoolbooks of the fourth grade, and turned into a legend the dignity and courage of the humble fishermen of the region. Salazar was a common visitor to some local families, such as Virg√≠nia Campos, Maria da Paz Varzim and the Amaral family. Important people of the state were often seen in the historical Ourivesaria Gomes Goldsmith in Rua da Junqueira. Ala-Arriba!, a 1942 film, focusing on local fisher culture, family values and the importance of the sea, is considered a project of the Estado Novo regime by the financial support it had. It was financed by the National Propaganda Secretariat, the Unemployment Commission and the Ministry of Public Works. The film won the first international prize to Portuguese cinema. The thriving textile, food and tourist industries and its development into the most popular holiday destination in northern Portugal, led to a major growth between the 1930s and 1960s. On December 16, 1948, the Anteplano de Urbaniza√ß√£o da P√≥voa de Varzim (Urbanization Pre-plan) was approved by the national government. The Port of P√≥voa de Varzim breakwaters started being built in 1939, a 200-year-old wish of the city, although the first works started in 1795. In the 1960s, the Palace of Justice was built using Soft Portuguese style, and P√≥voa de Varzim was granted city status on June 16, 1973, by the decree 310/73. Then and unlike today, city status was prestigious and extremely rarely granted, but that status was often rejected by influential Povoans since the early 20th century. Decadence and contemporary P√≥voa 1974‚Äìpresent P√≥voa de Varzim was in the news around the world due to renewable energy projects, such as the Floating wind turbine and the Agu√ßadoura Wave Farm. In the background, P√≥voa de Varzim highrise district and the suburban sprawl. In modern times, the fishing industry had lost most of its importance. P√≥voa de Varzim became a service-sector city, but unlike other urban areas of Porto, it is not a dormitory community for commuters.INE (2003), Movimentos Pendulares e Organiza√ß√£o do Territ√≥rio Metropolitano: √Årea Metropolitana de Lisboa e √Årea Metropolitana do Porto 1991-2001, Lisbon Being one of northern Portugal's main locations, it developed a cosmopolitan style and serves as a centre for neighbouring towns.Relat√≥rio do Plano de Urbaniza√ß√£o da P√≥voa de Varzim (in Portuguese) ‚Äî CMPV, Departamento de Gest√£o Urban√≠stica e Ambiente At the end of the 1970s and throw the 1980s, the city started a new accelerated pace of urbanization, now with little regulation, ruled by real estate speculation both in the price of land fractions and construction, which resulted in the construction of high-rise buildings and expulsion, by gentrification processes, of the traditional population, especially the charismatic fishermen. These sold their properties to real estate agents and some moved to the free area south of the city: Caxinas and Po√ßa da Barca in the municipality of Vila do Conde. And, in there, an accelerated pace of urbanization also occurred and P√≥voa and Vila do Conde, until then separated by uninhabited land, merged. This ultimately led to the loss of population in the official area of the city, loss of regional influence and decadence. In the 1990s the city had significantly expanded beyond the defined city limits and, by 1995, it was considered severely obsolete. The current area of the city, grouping several parishes, was defined on April 7, 1995 in the city council and the measures for the new urbanization plan were approved by the national government. In the end of 2002, the plan was subject to public discussion by the local community and was approved by the national government in January 2006. The city's first higher education school, Escola Superior de Estudos Industriais e de Gest√£o, was founded in 1990 in P√≥voa de Varzim City Center. This early school is the origin of the P√≥voa de Varzim/Vila do Conde campus of Porto Polytechnic, its second campus after the one in Porto, it houses the Superior School of Hospitality and Tourism and the School of Media and Design.Polit√©cnico do Porto cria duas novas escolas - TSF At the end of the 1990s, the city was authorized by the national government to use some of the gambling profits for city redevelopment in the main streets and squares, marina and other venues. This coincided with a period of no governmental investment to the municipality as attributed by the government investment program, the PIDDAC, which provoked outrage.Verbas do PIDDAC causam revolta - Jornal de Not√≠cias In the early 2000s, the city started to expand inland to the suburban areas, with a new large avenue, the Avenida 25 de Abril, and the city park opened in 2009, after over a decade of planning. The urban population expanded by 23% between the 1991 and 2001 census, after losing 1.3% in the previous decade. In 2011 census, P√≥voa de Varzim municipality lost population for the first time in modern history, a -0.1% decrease, due to a strong population decline in the coastal agricultural parishes north of the city (Agu√ßadoura, Navais and Estela). The city center kept attracting inhabitants with a 2.2% population increase. According to statistics, P√≥voa de Varzim lost population between 2009 and 2016, similarly to most of Portugal. In 2017, it was one of the few municipalities in Northern Portugal to halt population loss comparing to 2016 by showing a marginal increase in population, mostly due to legal foreign residents.PORDATA, Popula√ß√£o residente, estimativas a 31 de Dezembro, Fontes de Dados: INE - Estimativas Anuais da Popula√ß√£o Residente - PORDATADados de acordo com a vers√£o 2013 da Nomenclatura das Unidades Territoriais para Fins Estat√≠sticos (NUTS).

It began among the Turkmen tribes of the Taurus mountains, before spreading to a wide variety of disgruntled groups. It is named after the leader of the rebels, ≈ûahkulu. His death in battle also meant the end of the uprising.  Background  The Safavid dynasty was consolidated and founded by Ismail I in the early 16th century. Ismail, being a champion of Shiite faith and partially a Turkmen, was also sympathetic to the Turkmens of the Ottoman Empire. The Qizilbash, Anatolian adherents to the Safavid order, held a strong presence across Anatolia from the late 15th century to the mid-16th century, and assumed a central role in the ≈ûahkulu rebellion. In the decades preceding the events of the rebellion, due to the fluid religious character of the region, the primarily Sunni Ottoman state demonstrated a notable tolerance towards Shia Islam. However, beginning in the early 16th century, this tolerance began to recede; according to official Ottoman terminology from the period, a Qizilbash was a rebel heretic suspected of illicit relationships with the Safavids. Some ascribe this receding tolerance to the decline of the Aq Qoyunlu coupled with the emerging socio-political legitimacy of the Safavid empire. Though the revolt was incited by ≈ûahkulu among the Qizilbash, numbered among the eventual participants were various non-Qizilbash groups, such as former sipahis, dispossessed Gazis, and other Turkmen peoples. This decrease in tolerance contributed in part to the malcontent of the Turkmen tribes in Anatolia towards the Ottoman State. Their refusal to pay state taxes, settle down, and accept Ottoman central control pushed these Turkmen tribes towards a more militant form of Shi‚Äôism. This same malcontent would lead to multiple uprisings in Eastern Anatolia headed by tribal leaders. Being inspired by Safavid missionaries, the Turkmens living on Ottoman soil, \\"as far west as Konya\\", were mobilized in a \\"fervent messianic movement\\", led by ≈ûahkulu. ≈ûahkulu and his followers tried to \\"replicate\\" the same type of revolt led by Ismail I several years earlier, \\"perhaps in anticipation of a union with the Safavids\\". Ismail I's activities did not escape the attention of the Ottomans, but the Ottoman Empire was too preoccupied with the oncoming period of interregnum during the last years of the crippled sultan Bayezid II. Thus Ismail was able to gain many supporters among Ottoman subjects. One such supporter was ≈ûahkulu (meaning \\"servant of the shah\\"), a member of the Turkmen Tekkelu tribe.  Course of events  During the early days of interregnum, Korkut, one of the princes (), was travelling from Antalya to Manisa to be closer to the capital. ≈ûahkulu raided his caravan and robbed the treasury. Then he began attacking the towns and killing the government officers in the towns. He also raided Ala≈üehir to seize a part of the royal treasure. Only then, an Ottoman force under Karag√∂z Ahmet Pasha, the beylerbey of Anadolu, was sent to check his activities. But ≈ûahkulu defeated the forces of Ahmet Pasha and executed him. This increased the fame and the prestige of ≈ûahkulu. To his partisans, after raiding a royal caravan and killing a high-ranking Ottoman statesman, he was invincible. A second army was sent after him. The commanders of the army were ≈ûehzade Ahmet, one of the claimants to the throne, and the grand vizier Hadƒ±m Ali Pasha. They were able to corner ≈ûahkulu near Altƒ±nta≈ü (in modern K√ºtahya Province), but instead of fighting, Ahmet tried to win over the janissaries for his cause. Failing to achieve this, he left the battlefield. ≈ûahkulu saw his chance and escaped. Ali Pasha with a smaller force chased him, and clashed with him at √áubukova between Kayseri and Sivas.Nicolae Jorga: Geschiste des Osmanichen vol II, (trans: Nil√ºfer Ep√ßeli) Yeditepe Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 2009, ,p.217 The battle was a draw, but both Ali Pasha and ≈ûahkulu were killed (July 1511).Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt II, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 p 225-226  Aftermath  ≈ûahkulu's partisans were not defeated, but they had lost their leader. Many scattered, but after a third army was sent by the Ottoman Porte, the most devoted escaped to Persia. During their escape they raided a caravan, and accidentally killed a well-known Persian scholar. Consequently, instead of showing them hospitality, Ismail executed them. Meanwhile, in Ottoman lands, Prince Ahmet's behavior in the battle caused reaction among the soldiers. Moreover, the death of Hadƒ±m Ali, the chief partisan of Ahmet, provided an advantage to the youngest claimants to throne: the succession would ultimately fall to Selim I, under whose reign the Ottoman state saw spectacular victories and doubled in area. Selim was also a very devoted Sunni and effectively checked Shiite activities in Ottoman lands after defeating Ismail in the battle of Chaldiran in 1514. But the anxiety of the Ottomans, in relation to \\"losing much of their Asian possessions was not eased\\". Nor did the hatred of the Ottomans for Ismail I cease to exist, even though Ismail apologized for the atrocities caused by the Turkmens and \\"disowned\\" ≈ûahkulu. As the possibility existed of a \\"mass Turkmen exodus into the Safavid realm\\", Bayezid II sought to establish good relations with Ismail, \\"at least on the surface, and welcomed Ismail's gestures to establish good neighborly relations\\". In letters sent to Ismail, Bayezid II addressed Ismail as \\"heir to the kingdom of Kaykhosrow ‚Äì the legendary great king of the Shahnameh ‚Äì and to Dara (Darius) of the ancient Persian Empire\\". Abbas Amanat adds: \\"He further advised Ismail to behave royally, preserve his precious and strategically vital kingdom with justice and equanimity, end forced conversions, and leave in peace with his neighbors\\". The political environment which resulted from this revolt would lead the next Ottoman Sultan, Selim I, to take violent measures against the Qizilbash and declare war on Iran. Counted among these violent measures was the decree from Selim I to kill more than 40,000 Qizilbash, children and elderly included, in Rumelia and Anatolia prior to the Battle of Chaldiran in March 1514.Anonymous, \\"Selimn√¢me,\\" Topkapi Sarayi Library, Revan 1540, folio 10 a (Unpublished manuscript) In undated letters from Selim I sent to Isma'il I, estimated to have been written in 1514, Selim I wrote that \\"it has been heard repeatedly that you have subjected the upright community of Muhammad to your devious will\\" and expounded upon his plans to \\"crown the head of every gallows tree with a crown-wearing Sufi and clear the faction from the face of the earth\\".

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It stands on a steep bank above a stream at the end of a winding lane. History The church dates from the early part of the 12th century. It is likely that an earlier church existed on the site because the Domesday Book records the presence of a priest, but no trace of that church has survived. In the 14th century the south porch was built and a window was added to the south wall of the chancel. During the 19th century further alterations were made, including widening of windows, re-seating the church, and installing a west gallery. It is likely that the chancel arch was removed at this time. The functions of the church were replaced in 1877 by St Bartholomew's Church, Harpley. It was then neglected and was used for a time as a farm building. Since 1990 repairs and restoration have been carried out. This has been assisted by the formation of a local trust known as The Friends of Old St. Bartholomew's. The work included reinstating the west gallery. The intention of the restorers was \\"to make it appear as though we had never been on the site\\". The church was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 21 January 1994. Architecture =Exterior= St Bartholmew's is constructed in sandstone rubble with tile roofs. The exterior of the church is partly rendered. Its plan is simple and consists of a nave, chancel and south porch. The nave measures by , and the chancel by . The east window consists of a single light under a pointed arch. On the south wall of the chancel is a window of two trefoiled lights under a square head, to the west of which is a blocked priest's door. On the north wall of the chancel is a narrow round- headed window. The south porch is built in timber on a rubble plinth. It has a gabled roof over curved wind braces. Its walls are weatherboarded, and its bargeboard is decorated with moulding. The doorway is Norman and consists of a single order with a tympanum. In the west wall is a large square-headed 19th- century window over which is a small 12th-century opening. The north wall contains a blocked doorway and a 19th-century window. =Interior= The interior of the church is plastered. In the north wall of the chancel are two square aumbries, and in the south wall is a piscina and another square aumbry. Over the east window is a blocked 12th-century window. At the west end of the church is a gallery. Also in the church are the remnants of a circular font base. The Norman bowl of the font has been removed to the new church. On the north wall of the nave are traces of medieval paintings.

The view stands in contrast to positions such as Locke's psychological criterion for personal identity or various forms of Mind-body dualism, such as Richard Swinburne's account. Whilst the animalist is committed to something like the claim that human persons are essentially animals, the animalist is quite content to allow non- human persons - e.g. sufficiently advanced robots, aliens, or other animals. Use of term in ethics A less common, but perhaps increasing, use of the term 'animalism' is to refer to the ethical view that all or most animals are worthy of moral consideration.

For the lead he cast the Scottish tenor Joseph Hislop.Wilcox p 86 Reception Wilcox later wrote it was \\"a good film, I thought, but not commercially successful\\" which led to the gramophone company ending the relationship with Wilcox. \\"Had I chosen a less indigenous subject and a greater name star, the story might have been vastly different,\\" wrote Wlcox.Wilcox p 86 =Critical reception= The New York Times wrote, \\"another film which was manufactured with a particular eye to American consumption has on its showing here fallen far short of standards set by British critics...It was thought that the story of the Scottish poet whose fame has been spread throughout the world by his fervently admiring countrymen would command a certain amount of universal appeal. An undoubted opportunity has been missed in that respect. Joseph Hislop, a well-known and popular tenor, was selected for the r√¥le of the poet, and he does his part, so far as the rendering of a series of Burns's famous songs is concerned, as well as could be desired. On the other hand, the photographic work is much below the standard and the character of Bobbie is divested of most of those qualities which endeared him to his readers as a man as his verse commended him to them as a poet. \\"The Loves of Robert Burns,\\" indeed, was so unsatisfactory to the London public that it was withdrawn at the end of one week's trial at a central cinema, although it had been largely advertised in advance. Herbert Wilcox was the producer and apparently he fell between two stools‚Äîthat of finding a singer who could do justice to Bobbie Burns's \\"Comin' Through the Rye\\" and other equally famous ballads, and an actor who could present an adequate picture of Robbie the man\\" ; and more recently, TV Guide called it a \\"poorly produced life of the famed writer that is short on fact and long on fancy. Hislop, a noted operatic tenor, is about the best thing the film has going. He gives a fairly good performance and handles the songs well. However the script is a joke. Though the title implies that several affairs will be dealt with, in reality there are only two. Gray and Seacombe are Hislop's two lovers, both historically inaccurate. The film shows Seacombe being seduced and being made into \\"an honest woman\\" by Burns, when in reality they married and had several children. This story gives them no family at all. The Scottish settings are used nicely, but the actors keep forgetting what country they are in and their accents change from scene to scene. Better to buy an anthology of Burns' work than to deal with the mess here.\\" References *Wilcox, Herbert, Twenty Five Thousand Sunsets, 1967 External links * 1930 films British films British historical musical films English-language films Films directed by Herbert Wilcox 1930s historical musical films Cultural depictions of Robert Burns British black-and-white films British and Dominions Studios films ","title":"The Loves of Robert Burns"},{"id":"29016654","text":"Hellinsia albidactylus is a moth of the family Pterophoridae that is known from Japan (Honshu), Korea, China and Russia.

Located in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, the hotel had accommodated countless famous patrons throughout its existence from 1829 to 1971. Before being named Hotel des Indes, a name suggested by the writer Multatuli, it was named \\"Hotel de Provence\\" by its first French owner, and for a short spell went by the name \\"Hotel Rotterdam\\". After Indonesian independence it was renamed \\"Hotel Duta Indonesia\\", until it was demolished to make way for a shopping mall.  Background  The city of Batavia was founded by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the main Dutch settlement in South East Asia. In 1747, the Dutch already started to build on the land where later the hotel would be built. In 1760, the site was bought by the VOC Governor General Reynier de Klerck. In 1824, the land was bought by the Dutch East Indies government. In 1828, a boarding school for girls was constructed. However the boarding school was soon abandoned because due to the lack of European females in the Dutch East Indies its teachers kept leaving to get married. In 1829, the real estate was bought by the Frenchman Antoine Surleon Chaulan, who started a hotel named after his birthplace: \\"Hotel de Provence\\". At an auction in 1845, Etienne Chaulan bought the hotel from his brother for 25,000 Dutch guilders. Etienne made the hotel famous for being the first to sell different types of European style ice cream. In 1851, the hotel was bought by Cornelis Denninghoff, who changed the name to \\"Hotel Rotterdam\\". Although the hotel was located close to the elite \\"Harmony Society\\" and French tailor shop \\"Oger Fr√®res\\", it lost prestige and the next year the property was bought by a Swiss staff member named Francois Auguste Emile Wijss, who was married to Antoinette Victorine Chaulan, the 16-year-old daughter of Surleon Chaulan.  History  = Hotel des Indes = On the advice of none other than patron Eduard Douwes Dekker, Wijss changed the name of the hotel to the much more chic-sounding Hotel des Indes in 1856. In 1860, Wijss sold the hotel to the Frenchman Cresonnier. Louis Couperus, yet another writer, became a regular patron. Cresonnier commissioned the British photographers Walter B. Woodbury (1834‚Äì1885) and James Page (1833‚Äì1865) to photographically capture the hotel for an advertisement campaign. Ocean travelers in the 19th century arriving in the port of Batavia were taken to shore with small boats and dropped off at the \\"Kleine Boom\\" customs office. They were then taken to the hotel in a carriage along Molenvliet street. In 1869, British anthropologist Alfred Russel Wallace described the hotel's accommodation as: \\"The H√¥tel des Indes was very comfortable, each visitor having a sitting-room and bedroom opening on a verandah, where he can take his morning coffee and afternoon tea. In the centre of the quadrangle is a building containing a number of marble baths always ready for use; and there is an excellent table d'h√¥te breakfast at ten, and dinner at six, for all which there is a moderate charge per day.\\" Cresonnier died in 1870 and his family sold the hotel to Theodor Gallas who in turn sold, in 1886, to Jacob Lugt for 177.000 Dutch guilders. Lugt greatly expanded the hotel with land purchased from his neighbours. During the economic depression in 1897, Lugt founded the \\"s.a. Hotel Des Indes\\" to avert financial liability in case of a potential bankruptcy. = World War II = In 1942, the Japanese seized the hotel and renamed it. Director G. H√∂tte, manager since 1938, was left in charge. Only the general chief of service, who was held in high esteem by the indigenous staff, was considered indispensable, until a Japanese hotelier took charge. Thereafter, the remaining indigenous staff was not treated very cordially, but encouraged by the elder employees they nevertheless remained in service for over a year before being interned in a Japanese prisoner camp. Future Indonesian Vice President Mohammad Hatta was temporarily housed in the hotel by the Japanese authorities. = Indonesian Revolution = After the Japanese capitulation in 1945, the office of the Recovery of Allied Prisoners of War and Internees (RAPWI) took over the hotel and made it a safe haven for returning European refugees. However, in the period following the Declaration of Independence on August 17, 1945 most of the Indonesian staff quit, as part of the time of Revolution against Dutch colonialism. In June 1946, the hotel was back in business. G .P. M. van Weel was appointed director, with advisory co-directors, A. and F. J. Zeilinga, who ensured that for the time being the hotel was fully up and running again. On 7 May 1949, the hotel was the historic location of the Roem‚Äìvan Roijen Agreement that led to the release of Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta and eventually the Dutch transfer of sovereignty to the Indonesian Republic. = The Hotel in the Indonesian Nation = After the end of the Revolution against the Dutch, in 1949, the hotel was annexed without compensation and renamed Hotel Duta Indonesia. In the early 1950s, the hotel remained a central institution for the Djakarta elite, hosting prominent events including dinners, receptions and fashion shows. But it was transformed from being a Dutch colonial space into a modern Indonesian one. A description of women arriving for a ‚Äúmode-show‚Äù (fashion show) the featured both Western and Indonesian fashions, from the national women‚Äôs magazine Wanita in August 1950, translated from the Indonesian original written by S. Pudjo Samadi, captures the magic of the space: ‚ÄúThe lights shone bright in the room at the top of the Hotel des Indes, the hotel that has been called the gateway to the island of Java. There was no end to the automobiles dropping off their passengers in front of the entrance that led to the upper room. They got out in pairs, women of various nationalities, accompanied by escorts who were always ready at their sides. There were also those who came by themselves. Everyone‚Äôs faces seemed full of hope. It was as if truly what they were about to see in a few minutes was only for them, the soft ones, the beauties.‚Äù The event was not simply a fashion show. It was a part of the process through which the new nation was beginning to re-imagine what the new nation should look and feel like.

The large versions of 1636 (London) and 1639 (Madrid) are among the best known. These both show Rubens' version of idealised feminine beauty, with the goddesses Venus, Minerva and Juno on one side and Paris accompanied by Mercury on the other (the 1636 version has a putto at the far left and Alecto above the goddesses, whilst the 1639 version adds a putto between Minerva and Venus). 1636 version This version follows the story as narrated in Lucian's 'Judgement of the Goddesses'. It shows the award of the golden apple, though alterations show Rubens first painted an earlier point in the story, when the goddesses are ordered to undress by Mercury. It was bought for the National Gallery in London in 1844. 1638 version Painted in 1638 or 1639, this version is now in the Prado and was completed shortly before his death while he was ill with gout. It was commissioned by Philip IV of Spain's brother Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria and on Ferdinand's death moved to the Spanish royal collection.

Rockefeller and a founder and treasurer of the Standard Oil Trust.https://www.nytimes.com/1921/11/05/archives/29264181-to-heirs-of-mrs- bostwick-widow-of-the-standard-oil-man.html He attended St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire) and Yale University. During his time at Yale, he served as co-captain of the famous 1932 hockey team and declined an invitation to play in the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. In 1932, Bostwick married Electra Webb, a great-granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and daughter of James Watson Webb, Sr. and Electra Havemeyer Webb. The couple had four daughters and spent their time primarily between New York, NY, Old Westbury, NY, Shelburne, VT and Aiken, SC. Military service During World War II, Bostwick served in London, England with the U.S. Army Air Corps. He returned as a Lieutenant Colonel with a Bronze Star and a Belgian Croix de Guerre for his help in the organization of the Normandy Invasion in 1944. Polo career Bostwick's siblings included Dorothy Stokes Bostwick, Albert C. Bostwick, Jr., Lillian Bostwick Phipps and Pete Bostwick. Like his siblings, Bostwick was a competitive horseman, who competed in polo and Harness racing events all over the country. He earned a 6-goal polo handicap and played for the Aiken Knights and the Bostwick Field polo teams during the 1930s.http://www.bostock.net/tree/bostgen/wnames/d/dunbar1907neww109.html During this time, Bostwick created Bostwick Field with his siblings Pete Bostwick and Lillian Bostwick Phipps. During the Great Depression, the Bostwicks believed that everyone should be able to watch polo without being overcharged, which inspired Bostwick Field. The slogan of the field was \\"Polo for the Populace.\\" Harness Racing career After he gave up polo in the 1940s, Bostwick turned to harness racing. He bred, trained and raced many successful Standardbred trotters from his Bostwick Stables in Shelburne, Vermont. When his most famous horse, Chris Spencer, went lame, Bostwick swam the horse twice a day in Lake Champlain. Eventually, the horse was back in racing condition and went on to win important races including the 1949 American Trotting Championship and Golden West Trot and the 1950 Roosevelt Trot. Chris Spencer was inducted into the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1979.Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame bio for Chris Spencer Retrieved December 19, 2016 Chris Spencer was also the first horse to fly on an airplane, from Vermont to California to win the Hollywood Stakes race in 1952. Bostwick was a member of the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame and founded the Saratoga Harness Racing Association and the Aiken Mile Track. Throughout his life, Bostwick was engaged in multiple business ventures. He invented the magnetic snap barrier, an early gate that preceded current moving gates used at modern horse racetracks.

He frequently performs in ethnic languages, though mostly Setswana. Tuks Senganga started writing in 1993, drawing inspiration from everyday issues in his immediate environment. His career took off in 2005 with his debut album \\"Mafoko a me\\". This was the album that earned Tuks the Best Hip Hop Album Award at the 12th Annual MTN South African Music Awards (SAMA).  Career  A fellow Motswako artist once said \\"poetry is both lyric and content; one without the other can never be on point\\". These words encapsulate what Tuks is about, paying homage to one of the most critical aspects of the five elements of hip hop for an MC. Rhythm and Poetry. The art of story- telling in Setswana and English started a movement that was later dubbed Motswako and has had head-honchos like Tuks at its fore-front for over five years. Born Tumelo Kepadisa back in 1981 in Mafikeng, Tuks Senganga (as he is known by fans in all corners of the globe) started writing poetry at the age of 12 having drawn his inspiration from his daily experiences of having grown up in the Bophutatswana homeland during the apartheid regime which was later re-established as the North West Province in South Africa. However, it was in high school that he started harnessing his hip hop skills, at a time when Hip Hop was still a taboo in South Africa. = Mafoko A Me = In 2005, with the rise and rise of the Motswako movement, arrived with the now classic debut from Tuks which was titled .Mafoko A Me (My Words). The album had already received major reviews and a number of singles had been on high rotation on all national radio stations before its release. Mafoko A Me went on to win Tuks his first SAMA for Best Hip Hop Album, a well-deserved accolade. = MC Prayer = In 2006 he released his sophomore MC Prayer which was certified gold four months after its release. The production style and quality was leaps ahead of Mafoko A Me and the leading single \\"Monate Thwa\\" saw the album flying off shelves, and another SAMA nod in the form of a nomination for the Best Hip Hop album and a Metro FM Award win tagged along on Tuks' journey as a respected hip hop lyricist. = Monopoly = He took a two-year break from the industry to work on his business interests and came back in 2008 with the thought-provoking third offering, \\"Monopoly\\" which was influenced by several conspiracy theory documentaries. In his story-telling form, he goes on to say : \\"There is something wrong with the world and the way that people are controlled by the media, by music, belief systems and by religion\\", he adds \\"this album is ear-friendly, with a pinch of the truth. It's not about the industry. I'm taking it a step further. I'm talking about the faces behind the industry\\". With the two-year break that he took, he started working on his own record label, June/July Productions. The company was founded in 2004 and has done wonders for the budding business man and Tuks now runs his own artist and Events Management, communications, Publishing and music production house and released Monopoly, his third album under June/July Productions, partnered with EMI records. The album went on to win him three awards: Metro FM Music Award (Best Hip Hop Album); Hype Magazine Hip Hop Awards (Best Album); Hype Magazine Hip Hop Awards (Best Solo Artist). = Tshwanelo = In 2010, he independently released Tshwanelo which was a big shift from the sounds that we had been accustomed to, from Tuks. Its leading single, which is also the album title, topped charts across the country before the album availed itself to the public and once again saw Tuks standing his ground as a solid Hip Hop artist in South Africa. An even bigger single, Let Me Live found its way into the hearts of even Gospel fans. Tshwanelo was nominated for the 17th edition(2011) of South African Music Awards and Metro FM awards 2011 Edition. = Footprints = 2012 sees Tuks as a take-no-prisoners artist with September 2012 release of his 5th studio album: Footprints. The leading single, Bona Fela, is the soundtrack to a hit South African TV drama series called Skeem Saam which debuted on TV screens in October 2011. He has honed his skills as not just an artist in the form of just being a lyricist, but also as a fine artist and graphic designer, as showcased in the Footprints album cover sleeve that he designed. He has also partnered up with South Africa's biggest independent label,NEXT MUSIC, for music; media and digital distribution. NEXT MUSIC re-released Tshwanelo across major global digital platforms, as well as physical copies in March 2012. Further fuelling to his appetite for more international stages following a successful UK tour in December 2011, is Tuks‚Äô collaborations with Australian producer M-Phazes and New York-based songstress, Lydia Caesar on the albums' second single titled Love Angel. With four albums under his belt, a large following and a string of accolades to his name, it is without a shadow of a doubt that Tuks with his new album, titled Footprints is a force to be reckoned with. The steps he has taken to get to where he is now are evident in the Footprints that young artists would want to emulate. = Botshe Botshe = Tuks Senganga released Botshe Botshe four years after footprints in 2016. The album consists of 19 tracks featuring various artists. http://www.tuksmusic.co.za Discography ; Studio albums * Mafoko A Me (2005) * MC Prayer (2006) * Monopoly (2008) * Tshwanelo (2010) * Footprints (2012) * Botshe Botshe (2016) Videography ; Mafoko A me Album * Sneng Neng * 525 600 Minutes * Let Live ; MC Prayer Album * Monate Thwaa * Ticket to Jozi ; Monopoly Album * Le Mmatlela Kae * Hell Rain ; Tshwanelo Album * Tshwanelo * Let Me Live * Kwana Le Kwana ; Footprints Album * Girlchild ; Botshe Botshe Album * Sky is no Limit * Gafa  Awards And Nominations  ; Awards and Nominations * Nominee South African Music Awards ‚Äì Best Newcomer (2006) * Winner South African Music Awards ‚Äì Best Rap Album (Mafoko A Me) (2006) * Winner Metro FM Music Awards ‚Äì Best Hip-Hop Album(MC Prayer) (2007) * Winner Hype Magazine Awards ‚Äì Best Album (Monopoly) (2009) * Winner Hype Magazine Awards ‚Äì Best Solo Artist (2009) * Nominee South African Music Awards - Best Rap Album (Tshwanelo) (2011) * Nominee Metro FM Music Awards ‚Äì Best Hip-Hop Album (Tshwanelo) (2011) External links * Tuks Senganga Website * South African Music Awards website * Hype Magazine * MetroFM * Next Music  References  South African musicians Living people 1981 births People from Mahikeng ","title":"Tuks Senganga"},{"id":"29016881","text":"A Little Bit of Bluff is a 1935 British comedy film directed by Maclean Rogers and starring Reginald Gardiner, Marjorie Shotter and Clifford Heatherley.BFI.org The screenplay concerns a man who poses as a detective to recover some stolen jewels.

Life and work  He was a shoemaker by trade (born rich but lost his wealth). It has been speculated whether he had Jewish origin, but this is not known. He dedicated himself to astrology and publicising in verse messianic character prophecies famous around 1531. He had a great knowledge of the Old Testament scriptures, from which he created his own interpretations. As an adult he moved to Lisbon at the request of new-Christian mystics and theologians who desired that he had more contact and discussion with the Lisbon community. He was accused by the Portuguese Inquisition of Judaism and his trovas were included in the catalogue of forbidden books, since they aroused interest especially among the new Christians. He faced this tribunal, which deemed him innocent, but he was forced to participate in the 1541 auto-da-f√© procession and also to stop interpreting the Bible or writing on theology. After the trial he returned to Trancoso, where he died in 1556. His work was given the name \\"Par√°frase e Concord√¢ncia de Algumas Profecias de Bandarra\\" (Paraphrase and Concordance of Some Prophecies by Bandarra). It was edited by D. Jo√£o de Castro (sebastianist grandson of the famous namesake Vice-Roy of Portuguese India). The work was interpreted as a prophecy to the return of King D. Sebasti√£o after his disappearance in the Battle of Alc√°cer-Quibir in August 1578. In 1815 a new edition appeared with the title \\"Trovas In√©ditas do Bandarra\\" and between 1822 and 1823 another edition with the title \\"Verdade e Complemento das Profecias\\" appeared. The \\"Trovas do Bandarra\\" influenced the sebastianist and messianic thought of Priest Ant√≥nio Vieira and Fernando Pessoa. Bandarra's prophetics includes three points: the Fifth Empire, the going and return of the Encoberto [Covered One] (after Alc√°cer-Quibir identified as being el-rei D.

Eddy is an American physician, mathematician, and healthcare analyst who has done seminal work in mathematical modeling of diseases, clinical practice guidelines, and evidence-based medicine. Four highlights of his career have been summarized by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences: \\"more than 25 years ago, Eddy wrote the seminal paper on the role of guidelines in medical decision-making, the first Markov model applied to clinical problems, and the original criteria for coverage decisions; he was the first to use and publish the term 'evidence-based'.\\" Education Eddy attended Phillips Exeter Academy, then received a BA in history from Stanford University, MD from the University of Virginia in 1968, and PhD in Engineering-Economic Systems from Stanford in 1978. Career Eddy was Chief of the Bioengineering Branch of the US Army Medical Research and Development Command from 1971 to 1973. After obtaining his PhD, he was an assistant professor (1978) and then professor (1980) of Engineering Economic Systems at Stanford. In 1981, he went to Duke University where he was Professor of Health Policy and Management (1981‚Äì1986) and then J. Alexander McMahon Professor of Health Policy and Management (1986‚Äì1991). Eddy directed Duke's Center for Health Policy Research and Education from 1981 to 1986. In 1987, he resigned the directorship to focus on research and policy. Other positions include Chief Scientist for Blue Cross Blue Shield's Technology and Coverage Program and Medical Advisory Panel from 1984 to 2005, Director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center for Research in Cancer Policy from 1984 to 1996, Senior Advisor to Kaiser Permanente from 1991 to 2006, and Special White House Employee on Hillary Clinton's healthcare task force in 1993. Boards include Consumer Union (1982-1987), Board on Mathematic Sciences and their Applications/National Academy of Sciences, and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) (1992‚Äì1998). In 2006, with Leonard Schlessinger, Eddy founded Archimedes Inc., a healthcare modeling company funded by Kaiser Permanente. Eddy was Chief Medical Officer of Archimedes until he retired in 2013. Eddy continued to teach and consult after he retired. Research and policy work Eddy published five books and many papers, including a series of 27 essays in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. Eddy's work spanned several areas. =Mathematical models in clinical medicine= Eddy was the first to introduce Markov models to clinical medicine. His first model, published in 1976, was designed to analyze screening for cancer. It was used by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in 1978 to develop the first set of criteria for the insurance coverage of cancer screening tests. It was then generalized to analyze the progression, monitoring and repair of any probabilistic deteriorating system, and won the 1980 Frederick W. Lanchester Prize for the most important contribution to the field of operations research and management science. The model was used by the American Cancer Society and other organizations to design national and international-level cancer screening policies. This was the first healthcare model to be independently validated against empirical data. In 1987, Eddy developed the CAN*TROL model used by the World Health Organization and National Cancer Institute to help set cancer control priorities both within the United States and Internationally. As a volunteer for WHO, he helped several countries develop cancer control priorities, in particular India, Sri Lanka, and Chile. In 1991, with support from Kaiser Permanente, Eddy began work on a large-scale simulation model of physiology, populations, and healthcare systems, called Archimedes. In 2006, Kaiser Permanente spun out the Archimedes model as a separate corporation. In 2008 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation provided a $15.5 million grant to make the model readily accessible over the World Wide Web. In 2013 Archimedes, Inc was sold to Evidera. =Clinical practice guidelines= In 1980, Eddy launched the modern guidelines movement in healthcare when he conducted a study for the American Cancer Society to develop recommendations for screening for cancer. This was the first national level policy designed using formal methods instead of expert opinion. It was also controversial for the fact that it eliminated some commonly used tests and recommended for the first time that many tests, such as Pap smears and colon cancer tests, should done at non-annual frequencies. In 1982, Eddy published a seminal paper in the New England Journal of Medicine that described the role clinical policies and guidelines play in medical decision-making, noted their importance in determining the quality of care, and advocated explicit analysis of evidence and estimation of outcomes. The paper prompted the Council of Medical Specialty Societies to hold a national conference on guidelines in 1987, and ask Eddy to conduct a series of workshops to teach specialty societies how to design guidelines using explicit, evidence-based methods. The manual for those workshops was used in the late 1980s by specialty societies and the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Sciences, and was published in 1992 by the American College of Physicians. Eddy published a series of 27 articles in JAMA from 1991 to 1994 that laid out the rationale and methods for guidelines, and introduced what have subsequently become standard practices in evidence-based guidelines such as distinguishing between standards, guidelines, and options; formulating the decision problem; constructing evidence tables; preparing balance sheets, and being explicit about the quality of the evidence. From 1991 to 2000 Eddy helped Kaiser Permanente set up an evidence-based guidelines program. In 2011 Eddy and colleagues introduced the concept of \\"individualized guidelines,\\" which involves tailoring treatment recommendations to each individual patient based on that patient's risk factors, taking into account quantitative information about the patient's probabilities of important outcomes, and the effects on those probabilities of different treatments, one-by-one, and in various combinations. =Technology assessment and coverage policies= In 1984 the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association asked Eddy to help them create a formal process and evidence-based criteria for designing coverage policies. From 1984 to 2005 he served as advisor to the association's technology evaluation center, which assesses medical technologies, and chief scientist to the association's medical advisory panel, which recommends coverage policies to BCBS plans nationwide. This work introduced the concept of focusing on health outcomes instead of intermediate outcomes or biomarkers, and set a precedent that before a new test or treatment should be covered there must be good evidence that it is effective in improving health outcomes. The coverage criteria developed under Eddy's guidance were tested and vindicated during the national controversy over high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant for late stage breast cancer. In addition to conducting many assessments, Eddy led the development of new Bayesian methods for synthesizing evidence, called the confidence profile method. This work won the 1991 FHP prize from the International Society of Health Technology Assessment for the most important publication of the year. =Cost-effectiveness analysis= Eddy has been called \\"the leading expert on cost-effectiveness research and its relationship to public health policy and medical practices.\\" In a series of articles in JAMA, Eddy wrote seminal articles about the importance of taking financial costs into account when designing guidelines and medical policies, and developed theories and methods for setting priorities and rationing healthcare resources. For more than 30 years he has worked with a wide range of national and international-level organizations to apply cost-effectiveness analysis to clinical problems. =Performance measurement= Starting in 1993, Eddy served on NCQA's Committee on Performance Measurement, which designs measures for evaluating the quality of care delivered by health plans and providers. As chair of the methodology subcommittee, he introduced the use of formal, evidence-based methods. In 2011, he published a new approach to measuring performance that spans across multiple diseases and treatments and is based on outcomes, called the Global Outcomes Score. =Evidence-based medicine= In the 1980 ACS Guidelines for Cancer Screening, Eddy laid out the principles for what was to become the evidence-based policies and guidelines movement. \\"First, there must be good evidence that each test or procedure recommended is medically effective in reducing morbidity or mortality; second, the medical benefits must outweigh the risks; third, the cost of each test or procedure must be reasonable compared to its expected benefits; and finally, the recommended actions must be practical and feasible.\\" Throughout the 1980s he wrote papers that exposed the lack of evidence for many clinical practices. He first began to use the term \\"evidence-based\\" in 1988 in his workshops to teach specialty societies how to use formal methods to design guidelines. Eddy was also the first to publish the term \\"evidence-based.\\" In his formulation, an evidence-based policy \\"explicitly describes the available evidence that pertains to a guideline and ties the guideline to evidence... [It] consciously anchors a guideline, not to current practices or the beliefs of experts, but to experimental evidence...The hallmark of this approach is that it makes a commitment to evidence ‚Äì the policy must be consistent with and supported by evidence...The pertinent evidence must be identified, described, and analyzed. The policymakers must determine whether the guideline is justified by the evidence. A rationale must be written.\\" Eddy applied these principles throughout his work to help organizations design coverage policies, guidelines, and performance measures. Although the bulk of his work was in cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, he also analyzed problems in such disparate fields as radiology, osteoporosis, ophthalmology, and youth suicides. As the \\"evidence-based\\" movement began to spread through medicine, additional terms such as \\"evidence-based medicine\\" were introduced in the context of medical education and individual physician decision-making. In 2005 Eddy offered a unifying definition: \\"Evidence-based medicine is a set of principles and methods intended to ensure that to the greatest extent possible, medical decisions, guidelines, and other types of policies are based on and consistent with good evidence of effectiveness and benefit.\\" =Outcomes-based medicine= Throughout his career Eddy has stressed the importance of using quantitative information about the probabilities and magnitudes of health outcomes when making medical decisions or setting medical policies. Eddy began using the term \\"outcome-based\\" in his workshops for specialty societies, and first published the term in 1990. He defined the outcomes-based approach as \\"not only anchoring the guideline to available evidence, but explicitly estimating the outcomes of alternative practices‚Ä¶ the guideline must be accompanied not only by a description of the supporting evidence, but also by a description of the important outcomes, the magnitudes of those outcomes, and the method used to derive the estimates.\\" Selected awards and honors  *Frederick W.

Lee Wilder. It stars Robert Hutton, George Coulouris, Julia Arnall and Nadja Regin. The screenplay concerns a wealthy American man with a brain tumour who plans to replace his brain with that of Nostradamus. The film was released theatrically in England in 1957 on a double bill with the Japanese film Half Human (1958) and a year later in the US on a double bill with Fright (1956). Plot Wealthy, vain New York City businessman Karl Brussard (George Coulouris) is behaving oddly - answering telephones that aren't ringing, forgetting that he owns ships in Miami, failing to recognise his own physician, Dr Charot (William Sherwood). Charot shows Brussard an x-ray of his head. Brussard looks at it admiringly and says, 'Ah, beautiful - the brain of Karl Brussard!' But Charot tells him that he has an inoperable brain tumour and advises him to go to England, where Dr Phil Merrit (Robert Hutton) is researching brain transplantation. Brussard and his much younger companion, Odette Vernet (Nadja Regin), leave at once. Brussard meets Merritt, his nurse Jean Cramer (Julia Arnall) and Dr Lew Waldenhouse (Sheldon Lawrence) in London. Merritt confirms Charot's diagnosis, but Brussard is more interested in the living monkey's head that he's seen in Merritt's laboratory. Merritt explains that its brain came from a monkey which had been dead for six years and that he and his staff 'revitalised' the brain and implanted it into the head. Merritt says that the brain will 'change its personality' to the one the monkey formerly had. Brussard decides that he needs a new brain and, during a visit to Madame Tussaud's wax museum, learns of Nostradamus. Brussard hires the drunken Dr Brandon (Tony Quinn) and they go to France, open Nostradamus' crypt and steal his head. Brussard takes it to Merritt's lab. Without knowing whose head it is, Merritt's staff revitalise it. Brussard, who hasn't been told of this development, goes to the lab alone and finds the head, exclaiming, 'It's alive! My brain! It's alive!' When Merritt tries to force him out of the lab, Brussard, in a rage, accuses Merritt of trying to kill him and damages the Omnigizer, a vital piece of medical equipment. After Jean repairs the Omnigizer, the head speaks, identifying itself as Michel de Notre Dame. 'It's Nostradamus!' exclaims Meritt. He, Jean and Lew tell Nostradamus that his predictions have come true. 'A great mind that can see into the future!' declares Brussard. 'Worthy to be Karl Brussard!' When told that he's alive again, Nostradamus says, 'It's against nature' and asks 'Why have you done this?' Brussard answers by yelling at Nostradamus, telling him that he (Nostradamus) is now him (Brussard). Later, a mentally confused Brussard asks Nostradamus what he should do with his oil stocks. Nostradamus, knowing that stock prices are dropping, deliberately tells him to sell. Brussard does and is financially ruined. Odette, meanwhile, has been secretly dating Lew. Brussard discovers the affair, follows her to Lew's flat and strangles her. Lew arrives and finds Odette's body. Brussard, who has been hiding in another room, steps out, revolver in hand. Lew runs for his life, Brussard in pursuit. Lew goes to the lab and Brussard shoots him in the back, then flees. Merritt examines Lew and says that 'his cranial nerves have been severed'. He tells a police detective (Frank Forsyth) that Lew can't be saved. Brussard returns and shoots Nostradamus' head. Merritt decides to attach Nostradamus' head to Lew's body in an attempt to save them both. Brussard returns again and discovers that Lew has become a monster, with Nostradamus' head encased in what appears to be a shoulder-width box covered with surgical tape. Brussard runs away; Nostradamus wanders off. Merritt calls Dr Alexander (Norman Shelley) and tells him that Nostradamus 'seems demented' and has 'lost the power of speech'. But then the police spot Nostradamus. Merritt and Jean run to a building with a bell tower and find Brussard chasing Nostradamus up a staircase. Brussard becomes dizzy and falls to his death. The bells begin to ring and Lew's body comes crashing down, leaving Nostradamus' head dangling in the bell ropes. Cast * Robert Hutton ... Dr. Phil R. Merritt * George Coulouris ...

Custom's Officer Production The film was partly financed from the National Film Finance Corporation (NFFC). The directing credit was shared between Wilder and Saunders to ensure funding from the Eady levy, which was paid by distributors to film-makers in order to assure that British actors and production people would be employed, although in reality Wilder did most of the directing. Star Robert Hutton said in an interview that he remembers Saunders 'being on the set all the time and not doing anything. To satisfy the union, they had to hire an English director because of the rules'. Shooting took place over three weeks. The film's budget of ¬£20,000 was 'meagre' but enough for Twickenham Studios to be booked and Filmways Ltd to be established as the production company. The Man Without a Body was filmed in 1956. Outside- the-studio locations around London included the interior of Madame Tussaud's wax museum. It is the only film credited to Filmways Ltd. Release The film was paired in the UK with the Japanese film Half-Human (1958). In the US it shared a double bill with Fright (1956). The pressbook for The Man Without a Body and Fright called the pairing 'The Twin-Terror Show That Tops Them All!' British movie posters promised audiences 'Science's Most Terrifying Experiment!', while American audiences were teased by posters that claimed 'a diabolical dream come true!' The Man Without a Body was given an X-certificate by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) when it was released in the UK, which meant it was suitable for exhibition only to people age 16 or over. The rating was a deliberate manoeuvre on the part of its distributor, Eros Films, which sought out horror films, imported movies and other films aimed at young adults that could get an 'X-cert' in order to exploit the market for such films. The exact date of the American release is unclear. The Internet Movie Data Base (IMDb) only states 1958 and the Turner Classic Movies Data Base (TCMDb) gives a date of January 1958. Film Critic Bill Warren writes that the film was released in 1959. None specify an exact day. The Man Without a Body opened in the UK in May 1957 - again without a specific day being noted - and in West Germany, specifically, on 1 May 1959. It was later shown as part of the Night Visions Film Festival in Helsinki, Finland on 31 March 2007. Budd Rogers Releasing Corporation was responsible for theatrical distribution in the US. The Man Without a Body has had only a limited release for individual home viewing. The only reference to home distribution that could be found was for a release on VHS by Cinefear in the US, without a year designated. The film has had only limited American television exposure. All or parts of it were shown in 1978, 1979 and 1980 on TJ and the All Night Theatre, telecast on Friday nights by a local TV station in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The station broadcast 247 episodes of the programme during the 1970s and 1980s. A poster of the movie is displayed in Inside the Tower, a documentary released in the UK on 2 November 2015. A DVD of the documentary was distributed world-wide by Odeon Entertainment the same year.  Critical reception  American critical reception of The Man Without a Body is somewhat difficult to judge because of a paucity of reviews. While Warren notes that 'reviews are scarce', he is nevertheless able to refer to a handful of contemporary reviews. According to him, The Monthly Film Bulletin said that the movie's 'script, direction and playing are banal and amateurish'. He also comments that Don Willis, in his book Horror and Science Fiction Films, wrote that its 'fancy directorial touches' were 'wasted on a story which reaches awesome heights of ludicrousness' and that in A Heritage of Horror, British author David Pirie called the film a 'particularly ludicrous piece'. British critic John Hamilton calls the movie a 'confusing and confused tale', citing its 'lack of logical plotting and paper-thin characterisation' and its 'unintentionally hilarious script'. He writes that the film 'managed to slip below the radar of most film reviewers' in the UK, then 'sank without a trace'. Another British critic, Phil Hardy, writes that 'the direction by Saunders and Wilder (the brother of Billy) is decidedly pedestrian but the delirium of the central idea survives even its awkward articulation. The film, though not a great financial success, sparked off a number of similar re-animated head films, including [the West German] The Head (1959) and the [American] fantasy, The Thing That Couldn't Die (1958)'. The re-animated head of Nostradamus is cause for scorn, both from actors and critics. Hutton said in an interview that he and the other actors 'felt stupid talking to the head - we would almost break up! The actor was underneath the table, with his head stuck up through a hole in the table top, and you felt like a damn fool talking to him'. Warren writes that 'as Nostradamus, Michael Golden has little to do except poke his head through a hole in the table and talk' and even then 'many of the shots of the prophet's head are of a dummy cranium, obviously not Golden'. The topics the actors discuss with the head are regarded as dubious, as well, with Hardy saying that 'the highpoint of the film ... is an extended debate between Coulouris and Nostradamus' head in which the pair harangue each other, Nostradamus finding the purpose for which he's been re-animated too petty'. Elsewise, Warren calls the cinematography 'murky ... uninteresting and highly variable'. He says that the sets are 'drab' and that the film 'drags itself from scene to scene'. He calls the acting 'either non-existent or terrible or, in the case of Coulouris, so far over the top as to make it hard to imagine the actor ... took the proceedings seriously'. In summary, Warren writes that The Man Without a Body 'isn't just bad, it's colourfully, almost surrealistically bad, worthy of inclusion on almost any list of impressively awful movies'. The most positive comment about the film that could be found is from British academic film scholars Stephan Chibnall and Brian McFarlane, who call it 'entertainingly absurd'. =References= External links  * 1957 films British films British horror films 1957 horror films English-language films Films directed by Charles Saunders Films directed by W.

Population  Prior to the war, the village had Serb majority, but after the war, its Serb population was expelled and the village was inhabited by the Wahhabists with the help from the Bosnian Muslim authorities. Many of them married local women and earned citizenship. The village provided them a safe heaven in which they maintained their terrorist contacts under the guise of simple farmers. However, the hostility of the inhabitants of Donja Boƒçinja to outsiders, including SFOR, was palpable, undermining their claims of innocence. Eventually the enclave was closed down, and the village returned to its original owners.

Resolution =Observations= The preamble of the resolution began by welcoming a visit to Sierra Leone by the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and praised the role of UNIPSIL in the country. It endorsed Ban Ki-moon's recommendation that the mandate of UNIPSIL, outlined in resolutions 1829 (2008) and 1886 (2009), be extended for a further year to assist the Government of Sierra Leone with general elections in 2012. In this regard, the Council noted that tensions could increase prior to the elections due to political, security, socio-economic and humanitarian challenges, and the international community was called upon to create an environment to allow the conduct of free and fair elections. The resolution noted continued political efforts undertaken by the government and other political parties. It stressed that the work of the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor was important. Resolution 1940 (2010), which ended the arms embargo and other sanctions against the country, was highlighted along with the importance of controlling the circulation of weapons within Sierra Leone and nearby states at a local level. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Mano River Union and others were urged to continue dialogue to consolidate regional peace and security. =Acts= Extending UNIPSIL's mandate for an additional twelve months, it was also tasked with focusing on: :(a) providing assistance for the 2012 elections; :(b) promoting conflict prevention and mitigation efforts, and dialogue among political parties; :(c) assisting the government and institutions in tackling youth unemployment; :(d) promoting good governance, rule of law and human rights; combatting illegal drug trafficking, corruption, organised crime and money laundering; assisting with border control. The Sierra Leonean government was urged to combat corruption, promote accountability, good governance reform and development of the private sector with assistance from UNIPSIL. Greater efforts were required to enhance the integration and effectiveness of United Nations efforts on the ground and the Secretary-General was requested to report on achievement of benchmarks including the transition of UNIPSIL into a country team. He was asked to report every six months on progress made. The Council stressed that the government was responsible for peacebuilding, security and the long-term development of the country. Furthermore, it was called upon to promote national unity and reconciliation, while it was praised for recognising the role of women in the prevention of conflicts and peacebuilding.

Gale, 2011. Biography In Context. Web. 23 Sept. 2013. was an American librarian of considerable note, particularly during the Cold War era of the 1950s. During his long career, he acted as the director of the Enoch Pratt Free Library of Baltimore, the director of the Free Library of Philadelphia and as a director of the American Library Association. He was also a highly respected scholar and an advocate for intellectual freedom in wartime. Greenaway also came under fire for his participation in anti- communist government committees. In 1999, American Libraries named Greenaway as one of the one hundred most important library figures of the 20th century. Early career Greenaway was born in 1906 in Massachusetts. Although he would go on to have considerable influence over libraries in all of the United States, Greenaway never lived far from the East coast. Greenaway was educated at the University of North Carolina School of Information and Library Science (then called ‚ÄúThe North Carolina Library School‚Äù). Greenaway eventually received honorary degrees from both Wheaton College and Drexel University. The true beginning of Greenaway's illustrious library career occurred in April 1945, when he became the director of Baltimore's Pratt Library. During his time as head of the Pratt Library, Greenaway introduced both a film department and the bookmobile, both of which continue to serve the Baltimore community today. Greenaway was a longtime advocate of adult education but also placed a great deal of emphasis on children's within the Pratt Library. While with the Pratt Library, Greenaway also began to study international libraries. This fascination would follow him throughout the remainder of his life. Philadelphia years In 1951, Greenaway stepped down as director of the Pratt Library to begin his position as head of Philadelphia's Free Library. It was during this era (until his 1969 retirement from both the Free Library and the bulk of his library career) that Greenaway's life was perhaps most driven and interesting. The political climate during his time in Philadelphia forced him to confront issues of race, political motivations, library funding and information freedom. Greenaway pushed to expand library systems in many ways. He was a vocal proponent of federal funding for libraries rather than requiring smaller communities to take on the bulk of the financial burden. Greenaway also supported the concept of urban library systems which would consolidate the collections and resources of many smaller rural libraries into one more expansive system. In a 1959 speech and accompanying article for the American Philosophical Society, he detailed his own plans to create physical library spaces to better serve patrons. Chief among his ideas were proper space and physical buildings adapted to the needs of the community. Cold War era Greenaway's relationship with the Cold War era and the (second) Red Scare was extremely complicated. Primarily, Greenaway was a strong proponent of intellectual freedom. In the 1950s he served as chair for the Intellectual Freedom Committee, a branch of the American Library Association which tasks itself with protecting the privacy rights of library patrons. In 1950 he led an unsuccessful fight against the ‚ÄúOber Oath,‚Äù one of many ‚Äúloyalty oaths‚Äù directed at libraries put in place by the United States government. However, Greenaway also supported anti-communist measures by the United States and was privately thought by many to be a supporter of Joseph McCarthy. Greenaway argued that one of the main purposes of public access to information was to educate the masses against beliefs he found undesirable, such as communism. One may perhaps surmise that Greenaway was himself politically conservative but nevertheless respected and believed in the value of freedom to information. Despite Greenaway's dedication to information freedom, he came under fire when the Free Library was named in the Access to Public Libraries study to be one of three urban Northern libraries (the other two being Detroit and Washington, D.C.) which openly discriminated against African-Americans. Greenaway hotly contested the methods used by the survey. Later career In 1955 the American Library Association honored him with the Lippincott Award for distinguished service to the profession of librarianship. Joseph W. Lippincott Award. American Library Association. 1955.The height of Greenaway's career was from 1958‚Äì1959, during which time he served as the director of the American Library Association. During this time Greenaway continued to be active in issues of censorship and freedom of information. His involvement with the ALA did not cease after he stepped down from the presidency. In 1964, he participated in an ALA-sponsored delegation trip to the Soviet Union, an area he had studied closely during his time as president of the ALA. He also continued to serve on several task forces for the ALA. Following his retirement from the library world at large in 1969, Greenaway moved to New London, N.H. with his wife, Helen (Kidder) Greenaway. He continued to volunteer in libraries until close to his death.

History  MacFarlane Pheasants was started by Kenneth MacFarlane who went to New York to attend a Game Rearing school. After completing the course, Kenneth returned to Wisconsin. In 1928, Kenneth imported eggs from Gaybird Game Farm in England. The pheasants were bred for sale to hunt clubs. Kenneth‚Äôs brother, Donald MacFarlane returned to Wisconsin in 1935 (Donald had been working as a chemical engineer for Standard Oil in New Jersey).

The pheasant farm in the 1930s was on the outskirts of Janesville, but as the City of Janesville grew, it found itself within the city limits by the 1950s. In 1953 the farm was moved to its present location (about 1-1/2 miles south of its original location). Also during this time Donald‚Äôs brother-in-law, James Adamson joined the farm and coordinated the day-to-day farm operations. During the 1960s with the increased ability to ship day-old poultry nationwide, Donald expanded the breeding aspect of MacFarlane Pheasant Farm and began large-scale production of day-old pheasant chicks. Over 200,000 day-old pheasant chicks were produced annually during the 1960s. During this same time frame dressed bird production was limited (perhaps 3,000 birds a year were produced). Also during the 1960s mature pheasants continued to be produced for sale to hunting preserves. About 200 acres of corn and soybeans were raised yearly. During the 1970s Donald‚Äôs health declined and the farm sales began to decline somewhat. There was talk of the farm being sold in 1979. Donald persuaded his son Bill MacFarlane to return to Janesville and form MacFarlane Pheasants, Inc. In the course of the early 1980s Donald‚Äôs health declined further and James Adamson retired. In 1985, with the passing of Donald, Bill MacFarlane was now in charge of the operation. In order to allow for expanded hatching capacity, a new hatchery was built in 1987. During this time of growth, pheasant pens were constructed yearly, and new brooder barns were erected. In 1988 another farm, one mile away, was purchased to be the hub of our breeding operation with new pens then erected at that location.

Directed by James Durkin, it stars John Barrymore in his fifth feature film. Adapted from the novel of the same name by George C. Shedd, it is the earliest known surviving John Barrymore film. Synopsis Through mistaken identity, a rich contractor's son is impressed into the labor force building his own father's dam at Silver Peak. When construction of a dam in Silver Peak, Colorado threatens their land, rancher Crofton (William MacDonald) and his daughter Enid (Helen Weir) confront New York contractor James Dukane, Sr. (William T. Carleton). Dukane sends his son James \\"Jimmy\\" Dukane, Jr. (John Barrymore) to manage construction and to deal with the dam's impact on the locals, hoping that the task will help his son mature. However, en route to the construction site, Jimmy is waylaid by a vagabond, and his clothing and identification are stolen. Dressed in the tramp's clothes, Jimmy finally meets with the construction foreman Corbetson (Stewart Baird), who scoffs at his claimed identity and instead puts him to work with a pick and shovel. During his labors, Jimmy learns that Corbetson has been using sub-par materials and embezzling monies from Dukane Sr, and that to hide his crime, Corbetson is planning to blow up the dam. Cast * John Barrymore as James Dukane Jr. * William T. Carleton as James Dukane Sr. * Helen Weir as Enid Crofton * Stewart Baird as Corbetson * William MacDonald as Enid's father * William Meech as Lantry Production The Incorrigible Dukane was Barrymore's fifth feature film as well as his fifth film under contract to Famous Players. It was James Durkin's first directorial effort for Famous Players. Style The Day said that the film had \\"crystal clear photography [and] homey, every day realistic and intensely interesting settings\\" that made it a \\"superb production\\". Joseph W. Garton said in his book, The film acting of John Barrymore, that the \\"direction and photography are adequate\\" and that the \\"well developed narrative line is unusually strong\\". Critical reception Reviews in the Motion Picture News and the New York Dramatic Mirror were positive, generally acknowledging Barrymore as the main attraction. The New York trade paper Review called it the \\"best acrobatic show in town\\". George Blaisdell in Moving Picture World pointed out a few directorial slips, but still predicted that the film would be liked. Varietys Sime Silverman gave it a negative notice, writing, \\"... 'comedy' is a misnomer unless one will accept as funny John Barrymore's attempts to imitate Charlie Chaplin.\\" The Day called the film a \\"straightforward story told in a hearty boyish style with all the merriment of youth crowded into the four parts required to unfold the plot\\". The Meriden Morning Record considered it to be a \\"lively and very enjoyable photoplay\\". The Grey River Argus said that it was a \\"splendid drama\\" that, in terms of Barrymore, \\"gives us that legitimate actor in his happiest vein\\". The Ohinemuri Gazette considered it to be a \\"picture that will be enjoyed by everyone\\". The New Zealand Truth described it as a \\"thoroughly amusing filmatisation\\" and that it had \\"some exciting scenes during the industrial flare-up and plenty of dramatic and humorous happenings\\". Preservation This film is extant. A 35mm print is preserved in the George Eastman House Motion Picture Collection, and another print is in the BFI National Archive. Of Barrymore's earliest performances on film, encompassing a few shorts for Lubin and ten feature films for Famous Players, all are presumed lost except this one.

The conclave quickly reached a deadlock, with Giulio Cesare Sacchetti receiving 33 votes throughout the conclave, but never securing enough for his own election. Chigi was eventually elected Pope when Cardinal Mazarin, the leader of the French government, consented to his election at the request of Sacchetti. Background Innocent X created Camillo Francesco Maria Pamphili, his only nephew, a cardinal. Camillo would later renounce his status as a cardinal in order to marry. Instead, Innocent's sister-in-law Olimpia Maidalchini handled all of the functions that would ordinarily have been the realm of a cardinal nephew. During Innocent's papacy, the Peace of Westphalia brought an end to the Thirty Years' War, and it was the most significant secular event that occurred during his reign. Innocent did not approve of the treaty because his representatives had not been a part of the discussions and he had not been consulted or asked to approve the recognition of the Protestant religion in Germany. He called upon secular Catholic leaders to renounce the peace, but they did not do so. Innocent in return refrained from appointing cardinals outside of Italy during his reign. He only created six non-Italian cardinals during his pontificate, and five of those were Crown-cardinals that Catholic monarchs insisted upon. Aside from these, the remainder of his 40 creations all came from Italy.  Conclave  The College of Cardinals at the time of Innocent X's death had 69 members, and the conclave that followed saw 66 electors participate. 32 of the cardinals had been created either by Urban VIII or Innocent X. Because Olimpia Maidalchini was not a cardinal, she was not allowed to participate in the conclave, even though she was the only woman to have been allowed to give a speech to the cardinals. This left Innocent's creations without a natural leader during the process. There were 18 cardinals loyal to Spain in the conclave, and while the French had less loyalty, Urban VIII's nephew Francesco Barberini was a member of their faction. Barberini's allegiance to France was due to the marriage of one of his nieces to the brother of Rinaldo d'Este, the cardinal who led the French faction. Barberini had the capacity to bring up to 20 additional cardinals to support a candidate he favoured. Giulio Cesare Sacchetti, who had been considered the most likely to become pope in 1644, was the strongest candidate again, but some cardinals did not vote for him because he had been vetoed in the previous conclave by the Spanish. Sacchetti also was the favoured candidate of Cardinal Mazarin, the leader of the French government at that time. During the initial scrutiny Sacchetti received 33 votes, a number he consistently received throughout the conclave. The early scrutinies also were unique because there were a large amount of electors who wrote in no one, peaking at 27 votes on 22 January. These votes came primarily from electors that had been created by Innocent X who did not want to vote for a cardinal who had been created by Urban VIII. 11 of the votes for no candidate came from the Squadrone Volante, a group of cardinals who were willing to support a candidate for any faction that they thought would be beneficial to the office of pope. The stalemate continued through February, and younger members of the College of Cardinals began to play pranks on older members of the College in order to entertain themselves. This supposedly led to one older cardinal dying from pneumonia after a younger cardinal had caused him to fall and lie on a cold floor by startling him dressed as a ghost. There were also other illnesses amongst the cardinals that led several of them to leave the conclave. Election of Alexander VII In mid-February, Sacchetti, recognizing that his own candidacy was lost, contacted Mazarin and requested that the French cardinals move their support to Fabio Chigi. Chigi was initially speculated as a candidate for pope before the death of Innocent X. Contemporary accounts reported that he was held to be the best suited for the position if the human considerations of the elector were not taken into account. Cardinal Mazarin of France was convinced to support Chigi by the Squadrone, even though he did not like him. Mazarin's hatred of Chigi dated to Mazarin's exile in Cologne during the Fronde while Chigi was serving as the papal nuncio in that city. In April 1655, Mazarin wrote back to Sacchetti agreeing to allow electors loyal to France to vote for Chigi should Sacchetti's own election become impossible. Sacchetti then proceeded to ask his supporters to transfer their support to Chigi. On the first scrutiny on 7 April 1655, 20 written ballots were cast for Chigi, before the other electors acclaimed him pope after a conclave lasting 80 days. Upon his election, Chigi took the name Alexander VII.

Fina opened on the fourth floor of 580 Fifth Avenue at 47th Street in Manhattan when Rosenblatt negotiated a partnership in exchange for investing in the company. This business partnership was formed between the two with Michael handling the sales and marketing side of the business and detail- oriented Rose handling the finances, shipping and delivery. Michael and Rose formed a relationship while growing the company and were married in 1941. Their sons George and Charlie grew up immersed in the business and learned every facet of the trade directly from their parents. In early years the company was a wholesaler specializing in fine silver plate and sterling silver hollowware. During the 1950s the company expanded into the retail market. Outgrowing the original fourth floor location at 580 Fifth Avenue, the company moved down two floors in the same building to the second floor location that would become the company's home for the next several decades. The second floor housed a larger showroom, a jewelry department, and a shipping department. During their years in this store, the phrase \\"Upstairs at Michael C.

Fina also partnered with numerous television game shows that gave away prizes in the early television era, including Beat the Clock, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, Let‚Äôs Make a Deal and Treasure Hunt. A partnership with The Price Is Right has lasted since the show began in 1956. Michael C. Fina was one of the first companies in New York City to enter the bridal registry business.http://www.tablewaretoday.com/Fina-C.htm At its peak the company registered over 10,000 brides per year. MichaelCFina.com launched in the early days of e-commerce and was among the first retailers to offer an online wedding registry, as well as an omnichannel inventory approach. The brand further embraced the internet by extending its presence through an early partnership with The Knot. In 2016, the company closed its physical store and transformed into an online-only retailer. As part of the move online, the retailer teamed with Amazon and Zola. The partnership with Amazon, as part of Amazon's Wedding Registry, will offer high-end brands, like Baccarat and Buccellati, that have not made their goods officially available on Amazon previously. Under its partnership with Zola, couples who attempted to register at MichaelCFina.com were transitioned to Zola's site, where they were able to access Michael C. Fina products. Pre-existing registries moved to Zola soon to enhance the overall wedding registry experience as the company offers more than 50 brands and over 2,000 different items from Michael C. Fina's luxury tableware catalog including Christofle, Haviland and Royal Crown Derby. MichaelCFina.com ceased operations in April 2019 Michael C. Fina also continues to sell home goods, maintaining a selection of well-known brands such as Royal Copenhagen, Raynaud, Georg Jensen, Hermes, Puiforcat and Saint- Louis Crystal.  Employee Recognition  Entering the recognition business in the 1960s, the Finas incorporated lifestyle gifts alongside more traditional recognition items such as tie tacks and desk clocks. During the late 1980s Michael C. Fina created the Magic Box to present lifestyle gifts such as televisions and barbecues in the workplace. The box, which contained a framed certificate, congratulatory letter, gift catalog, order form, and optional trinket such as a pen or watch, gave employees the experience of being presented with a gift at work, but allowed them to choose a gift that fit their lifestyle. This segment of the Michael C. Fina business (Michael C. Fina Recognition) currently services more than 800 companies in more than 100 countries, supporting more than five million employees globally each year. Michael C. Fina built a World Headquarters and Distribution Center at 33-01 Hunters Point Avenue in Long Island City. This building houses all departments, systems and inventory for the company. Over 92% of the recognition services products ship out of this center with all gift wrapping and servicing done in-house. While employee service awards and the Magic Box are still the cornerstone of Michael C. Fina's employee recognition business, the focus of the industry is shifting towards multi-initiative performance management, and the company is offering new products and services to accommodate its customers‚Äô changing needs such as GiftNET, an online gift catalog. In 2009, Ashley Fina was named president of Michael C. Fina, and in 2010 the company became certified as a Women's Business Enterprise by the Women Presidents' Educational Organization, a regional certifying partner of the Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC). Throughout the 2000s Michael C. Fina Recognition built a strong national and international client base for its multi-initiative performance management recognition solutions. In 2017, it was acquired by HALO Branded Solutions, a global promotional products leader based in Sterling, Illinois, adding some 800 employees and a state-of- the-art distribution and processing center. Today the employee recognition arm is officially known as Michael C. Fina Recognition - A HALO Company.  Michael C. Fina Products  Beginning in the 1980s the Finas oversaw the production of Michael C. Fina brand products. Prior to the official creation of Michael C. Fina products, the company had a partnership with manufacturer Kent Silversmiths dating back to 1947 to create custom pieces. Michael C. Fina created the china aboard the USS New York, the ship crafted from steel salvaged from the World Trade Center.  Notable Shoppers  Michael C. Fina customers have included Frank Sinatra, Lennox Lewis, the Saudi royal family, President George H.W. Bush and Anna Wintour. Chelsea Clinton also registered there.

It replaces all indirect taxes levied on goods and services by the Indian Central and state governments. It is aimed at being comprehensive for most goods and services. Background An empowered union committee was set up by the Vajpayee administration in 2000 to streamline the GST model to be adopted and to develop the required back-end infrastructure that would be needed for its implementation. In his budget speech on 28 February 2006, P. Chidambaram, the Finance Minister, announced the target date for implementation of GST to be 1 April 2010 and formed another empowered committee of State Finance Ministers to design the road map. The committee submitted its report to the government in April 2008 and released its First Discussion Paper on GST in India in 2009. Since the proposal involved reform/ restructuring of not only indirect taxes levied by the Central but also the States, the responsibility of preparing a Design and Road Map for the implementation of GST was assigned to the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC). In April, 2008, the EC submitted a report, titled \\"A Model and Road map for Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India\\" containing broad recommendations about the structure and design of GST. In response to the report, the Department of Revenue made some suggestions to be incorporated in the design and structure of proposed GST bill. Based on inputs from GoI and States, The EC released its First Discussion Paper on Goods and Services Tax in India on 10 November 2009 with the objective of generating a debate and obtaining inputs from all stakeholders. A dual GST module for the country has been proposed by the EC. This dual GST model has been accepted by centre. Under this model GST have two components viz. the Central GST to be levied and collected by the Centre and the State GST to be levied and collected by the respective States. Central Excise duty, additional excise duty, Service Tax, and additional duty of customs (equivalent to excise), State VAT, entertainment tax, taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling and entry tax (not levied by local bodies) would be subsumed within GST. Other taxes which will be subsumed with GST are Octroi, entry tax and luxury tax thus making it a single indirect tax in India. In order to take the GST related work further, a Joint Working Group consisting of officers from Central as well as State Government was constituted. This was further trifurcated into three Sub- Working Groups to work separately on draft legislation required for GST, process/forms to be followed in GST regime and IT infrastructure development needed for smooth functioning of proposed GST. In addition, an Empowered Group for development of IT Systems required for Goods and Services Tax regime has been set up under the chairmanship of Dr. Shruti Negi.

It was written by co-show runner and executive producer Robert Carlock and directed by series producer Don Scardino. \\"When It Rains, It Pours\\" originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on September 30, 2010. Guest stars in this episode include Joanna Adler, Ben Bailey, Elizabeth Banks, Craig Castaldo, Paul Giamatti, Andrea Mitchell, Chris Parnell, Sherri Shepherd, and Brian Williams. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) uses her newfound confidence of men noticing her to solve Pete Hornberger's (Scott Adsit) problem with a difficult television editor named Ritchie (Paul Giamatti). Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) decides to teach his unborn child with his girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) how to live. Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is determined to be with his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) when she gives birth, and a mysterious individual is making sure Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) page duties at the fictitious show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) at NBC are still getting done. \\"When It Rains, It Pours\\" received generally positive reviews from television critics. According to the Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by 5.688 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.6 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. For his work in the episode, Robert Carlock won the Writers Guild of America Award for Episodic Comedy. Plot Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is surprised that men have been noticing her, instead of resenting or ignoring her as they usually do. Her friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells Liz that she is coming off as more confident since starting her relationship with her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). Liz decides to use her new-found confidence to help TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) with a problem he has had with a difficult television editor named Ritchie (Paul Giamatti). Liz visits him in the editing room and hopes to convince him to get TGSs show's opener footage finished as soon as possible in which she is successful after flirting with Ritchie. Later, Liz learns that Ritchie is spreading a rumor that the two are sleeping together. She confronts Ritchie about it, he admits to starting the rumor in order to get the attention of his assistant editor Donna (Joanna Adler). Later, Liz and Ritchie have a pretend break-up in front of Donna, and Donna becomes interested in Ritchie. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) and his girlfriend CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) tell Liz that they are expecting a son. Liz congratulates them and tells the two that their son will have an old dad as Jack is in his early 50s. As a result of what Liz said, Jack fears that he will not be around so he decides to teach his unborn son how to live by recording a video containing advice for him. Later, Jack learns that he and Avery are in fact expecting a daughter and not a son. Jack realizes that he needs to make new tapes and in the tape he says to his unborn daughter \\"If you have the blondeness and self-esteem of your mother, you will need no advice.\\" At the same time, Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) wife, Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd), is going into labor. Tracy, who after missing the birth of his sons does not want to miss the birth of his daughter, has Grizz Griswold (Grizz Chapman) and \\"Dot Com\\" Slattery (Kevin Brown) guard him in his dressing room in the 30 Rock building so that he would not wander off. A fire drill occurs so everyone must exit the building. Outside, however, the two lose track of Tracy, who wanders around the city. He hails a cab to get to the hospital Angie is at, but realizes that he does not have money on him, however, the driver does not mind. Once inside the cab, the driver, Ben Bailey‚Äîthe host of the game show Cash Cab‚Äîinforms Tracy that he is a contestant. As part of the game, Tracy must answer questions to win money and reach his destination. As a result, Tracy answers all the questions correctly and arrives at the hospital in time to witness the birth of his daughter. In addition, Liz and Jenna are surprised how smoothly everything is running in the TGS set without Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), a former NBC page. Unbeknownst to everyone, there is a \\"mystery man\\" going around TGS in a black cape completing all of the tasks that Kenneth would do. While Jack is recording a video, he catches Kenneth in his office, revealing that Kenneth has been the one completing all of his old tasks. Kenneth says that he is there because he knows how much he is needed, but Jack tells him that they do not need him and he must move on with his life. Hurt and bewildered, Kenneth leaves, and Jack says in the video for his unborn child that the exchange between him and Kenneth was really \\"tough love\\" and he had just sent Kenneth on a journey. Later, Kenneth gets a phone call from Angie, who is delirious on pain killers. At the same time, as Tracy is on the game show, Angie tells Kenneth to find Tracy. Unable to do so, Kenneth takes a cardboard cut-out of Tracy and pretends to be him as she is giving birth until Tracy comes in and pushes Kenneth out of the way. Later, Jack tells Kenneth that he is truly needed back at TGS and offers to talk to human resources to get his job back, but Kenneth refuses and says he will re-apply to the page program, following the proper procedures.

Giamatti is due to appear in a future episode of 30 Rock. Actress Elizabeth Banks returned as her 30 Rock character Avery Jessup, a CNBC television host and Jack Donaghy's girlfriend, in this episode, and reprised the Avery role for the eighth time. Comedian actress Sherri Shepherd reprised her role as Angie Jordan, the wife of Tracy Jordan, for the seventh time. Comedian actor Chris Parnell, who played Dr. Leo Spaceman, the doctor who assisted in the birth of Angie and Tracy's daughter in the episode, has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Tina Fey was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. News anchors Brian Williams and Andrea Mitchell played themselves in the episode in which the two tease the Liz Lemon character of her supposed relationship with Giamatti's Ritchie. This was Williams' fourth appearance on the show, having appeared in the episodes \\"The Ones\\", \\"Audition Day\\", and \\"Future Husband\\", and Mitchell's first appearance on 30 Rock. Ben Bailey, the game show host of the Discovery Channel program Cash Cab played himself. In the beginning of the episode, several men hit on Liz, which surprises her, and one of those men who hits on her was credited as \\"Moonvest\\" and was played by Craig Castaldo, or known as Radio Man. Castaldo has made numerous appearances on the program. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"When It Rains, It Pours\\" drew in 5.688 million households, according to the Nielsen Media Research. The show claimed a 2.6 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The rating/share was the same number as the previous week's season premiere episode, \\"The Fabian Strategy\\"; in the week that \\"When It Rains, It Pours\\" originally aired, 30 Rock was the only Thursday program whose ratings did not fall from its season premiere. In February 2011, Robert Carlock won the Writers Guild of America Award for Episodic Comedy for his work in this episode of 30 Rock. Paul Giamatti's appearance on the show was appreciated by critics. Television columnist Alan Sepiwall for HitFix called this the best overall episode since season four's December 2009 episode \\"Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001\\". He wrote that the episode had \\"some incredibly funny jokes\\", but noted that the \\"most hilarious moments\\" from \\"When It Rains, It Pours\\" came from the main characters themselves. Sepinwall enjoyed Jack's videos to his unborn son, noting it was \\"...the [Jack] I know and love best: supremely confident and ... oblivious to his own insanity.\\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club liked that the series had moved on from making the Liz character \\"asexual and vaguely repellent\\" for men. In his recap, Rabin much enjoyed the episode and said \\"If the rest of the season is as good as the first two episodes, we could have a big-time comeback on our hands.\\" Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote that Paul Giamatti was a delight as his 30 Rock character. Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett was thrilled that the Tracy character was a contestant on Cash Cab, noting once the game began \\"everything felt so right\\". Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News preferred \\"When It Rains, It Pours\\" to the episodes of Community and The Office, which aired on NBC the same night. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student wrote that Giamatti played his part brilliantly, and that his involvement in the main plot was \\"well-written, well-organized, and by far the best thing about the episode\\". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad commented that Giamatti \\"seems like he could be an editor at NBC, so the guest role didn't irritate or grate\\". Sassone enjoyed Kenneth and Tracy's stories here, and was glad that Jack and Avery have remained a couple. Verne Gay of Newsday noted that this episode of 30 Rock was a \\"spectacular piece of television, and comedy writing, and acting\\". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun called Tracy's plot \\"very believable\\", and opined that \\"any reservations I have had about this show being less than completely real are gone\\" after watching this episode. Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times deemed this a stellar episode, explaining that the Tracy, Liz, and Jack characters had storylines that allowed them \\"to strut their comedic stuff\\". Time contributor James Poniewozik reported that \\"When It Rains, It Pours\\" was a very good episode. He noted that Jack's storyline was the \\"simplest recipe for comedy: just turn on a camera and let Alec Baldwin be hilarious. But it came within the story of his accepting having a [child] assessing his mortality, and trying to distill what matters in his life\\". Poniewozik was positive towards Liz's plot with Giamatti, reporting that her plot \\"involved one of the best guest roles in a sometimes too guest-heavy role\\" and enjoyed the traits from Giamatti's Ritchie.

Introduction ≈†ur is in some respects the most important of the DastgƒÅhs. It contains a large body of pieces, and in its domain belong four important ƒÄvƒÅzes: Da≈°ti, AbuatƒÅ, BayƒÅt-e Tork and Af≈°ƒÅri. A great many folk tunes, from different parts of Persia, are founded on the modal schemes of ≈†ur or its derivative DastgƒÅhs and Gu≈°es. The melodic formation in ≈†ur is conceived within the modal structure shown below for ≈†ur D : :: 340px The characteristics of this mode are: # The tetrachord above the finalis (marked with \\"F\\") is the focal point of melodic activity. # The finalis is the most emphasized tone. # The 4th above is the minimal high point in the mode, and has considerable prominence. # The 2nd and particularly the 3rd above the finalis are also heard frequently. # The 5th above (marked with \\"M\\") is a Moteqayyer (meaning variable in Persian). When the melodic line is descending, it is usually lowered by a micro tone from a to a 4px. This lowering is responsible for the creation of a sense of finalis for the 4th above, since by lowering the a to a 4px, the original tetrachord is recreated from g. # The 6th above has no significant role except as a note of resolution for the 5th when used ascendingly (a). The 7th above can be, and frequently is, entirely omitted. # The 2nd below (marked with \\"ƒÄ\\") has considerable importance both as a frequent note of ƒÄqƒÅz (meaning beginning in Persian) and in cadences, where one of the most common cadential patterns involves a progression from the 2nd below to the finalis. # The 3rd below is also used frequently in cadences. In such situations it is used ascendingly, resolving to the 2nd below and then to the finalis. Here, the 3rd below is higher than its octave (6th above) by a micro tone, b4px instead of b. Forud In every DastgƒÅh the Forud assumes a very significant role as a unifying agent which binds together the various Gu≈°es in that DastgƒÅh. In most DastgƒÅhs, more than one Forud pattern is used. In a ≈†ur Forud, the finalis may be approached by way of a) the 2nd below, b) the 3rd and 2nd below, c) the 2nd above, or d) the 4th above. What precedes these approaches can be brief or extensive depending on the extent of Forud improvisation. The following scores, give an average length for each of these Forud types in ≈†ur D: :: (a) 400px() :: (b) 470px() :: (c) 360px() :: (d) 390px() DarƒÅmad The melodic movement of ≈†ur, as of all DastgƒÅhs and Gu≈°es, is overwhelmingly diatonic. No leaps larger than a perfect 4th are made. Most leaps of 4ths actually occur between the end of one phrase and the beginning of another. In other situations, an upward leap of a 4th is relatively common, from the 2nd below to the 3rd above the finalis, at the beginning of a phrase. An upward and then downward leap of a 4th is common in the Forud d as shown above. This type of ending is also used in a number of other DastgƒÅhs (e.g. HomƒÅyun and NavƒÅ). The very final portion of this Forud, which involves the leap of a 4th down, is known as BƒÅl-e Kabutar (meaning pigeon's wing in Persian) (see the score below). :: 340px Leaps of 3rds between the notes of the main tetrachord are used sparingly, generally in sequential and ornamental passages, as shown in the following score in ≈†ur D : :: 615px() To illustrate the melodic character of ≈†ur, as represented by the DarƒÅmad, two different formulae for DarƒÅmads of ≈†ur are transcribed in the following scores in ≈†ur D : :: (a) 615px() :: (b) 615px() These formulae, as the basis for improvisation, have been arrived at after analysis of numerous improvisations in DastgƒÅh-e ≈†ur. After the DarƒÅmad section, those Gu≈°es which are part of the organisation of DastgƒÅh-e ≈†ur are performed. A complete Radif, such as that of MusƒÅ Ma'rufi contains much redundancy and several short and insignificant pieces. The present study has been concerned with larger and more singular pieces, most of which would be included in a normal but extended performance of ≈†ur. The main Gu≈°es of DastgƒÅh-e ≈†ur are the following: Salmak, MollƒÅ NƒÅzi, Golriz, Bozorg, XƒÅrƒÅ, Qajar, OzzƒÅl, ≈†ahnƒÅz, Qaraƒçe, Hoseyni, BayƒÅt-e Kord and Gereyli. They may be performed in that order, but the order is by no means fixed. In a given performance of DastgƒÅh-e ≈†ur some of the Gu≈°es may be left out altogether, and the order of those included may also vary. This observation will hold true in all of the DastgƒÅhs. The order in which the Gu≈°es are listed and described represents, at best, the most common arrangement of the most noteworthy pieces in each DastgƒÅh.

ELS was founded in by Jim Muir in Waterloo, Ontario and its headquarters is currently located in Elmira, Ontario. History ELS was founded under the name Mentor Dynamics in 1971 by Jim Muir.Industry Canada -ELS report The primary focus of the business was related to structural steel fabrications. A significant customer at the time was Kraus Carpets as Mentor Dynamics helped construct the building, storage hoppers and an extensive carpet handling system that is still in use today. In the mid 1970s Jim Muir started working with the ship building industry to develop a low friction lining system to facilitate the movement of bulk materials in the holds of self-unloading ships. After the fastening process was patented, Mentor Dynamics eventually lined dozens of ships. Most of the original liners are still in place. In the early 1980s Mentor Dynamics was presented with a few additional business opportunities. One came in the form of an overhead conveyor system, which still provides a steady stream of business. The other opportunity was the manufacturing of overhead cranes as another manufacturer moved out of Ontario leaving Mentor to serve their established customer base. The crane business grew steadily through the 80's; eventually developing into jib cranes, monorails and wide spans double girder cranes. Carl Young purchased the company in April 1989. He incorporated it as Mentor Dynequip Inc. but kept Mentor Dynamics as the operating name. The focus was on designing and making small to mid-sized overhead cranes and gantry cranes. Mentor was also a distributor for hoist and specialty crane manufactures. In early 1992 the business was restructured, this time without the ship liner business or the company owned factory. The company was sold again in August 1998, this time to Paul Whittaker, P.Eng. It was operated as Mentor Dynamics, with the corporate name registered as Engineered Lifting Systems & Equipment Inc. As of January 1, 2008 Mentor Dynamics moved to its own property and building in Elmira, Ontario. Coinciding with the move, the company also changed its name from Mentor Dynamics to Engineered Lifting Systems & Equipment Inc. (ELS) to better communicate the essence of its business endeavors. In 2015 ELS opened a second manufacturing plant dedicated to the production of the Destuff-IT product line. This 9,300 square foot facility is located near the main plant in Elmira, ON Canada. Products A Lifting Device From ELS Engineered Lifting Systems & Equipment Inc still manufactures its products under the brand name Mentor Dynamics as well as acting as a distributor for such companies Gorbel, Anver, Schlumpf, Columbus McKinnon Industrial Products, Stahl Crane Systems, Kito Hoists, Lift-Tech, Budgit, and Shaw-Box hoists.

To many, SLM is considered to be a subcategory of selective laser sintering (SLS). The SLM process has the ability to fully melt the metal material into a solid three-dimensional part unlike SLS. History Selective laser melting, one of the several 3D printing technologies, started in 1995 at the Fraunhofer Institute ILT in Aachen, Germany, with a German research project, resulting in the so-called basic ILT SLM patent DE 19649865. Already during its pioneering phase Dr. Dieter Schwarze and Dr. Matthias Fockele from F&S; Stereolithographietechnik GmbH located in Paderborn collaborated with the ILT researchers Dr. Wilhelm Meiners and Dr. Konrad Wissenbach. In the early 2000s F&S; entered into a commercial partnership with MCP HEK GmbH (later on named MTT Technology GmbH and then SLM Solutions GmbH) located in L√ºbeck in northern Germany. Today Dr. Dieter Schwarze is with SLM Solutions GmbH and Dr. Matthias Fockele founded Realizer GmbH. The ASTM International F42 standards committee has grouped selective laser melting into the category of \\"laser sintering\\", although this is an acknowledged misnomer because the process fully melts the metal into a solid homogeneous mass, unlike selective laser sintering (SLS) which is a true sintering process. Another name for selective laser melting is direct metal laser sintering (DMLS), a name deposited by the EOS brand, however misleading on the real process because the part is being melted during the production, not sintered, which means the part is fully dense. This process is in all points very similar to other SLM processes, and is often considered as a SLM process. A similar process is electron beam melting (EBM), which uses an electron beam as energy source. Process DMLS uses a variety of alloys, allowing prototypes to be functional hardware made out of the same material as production components. Since the components are built layer by layer, it is possible to design organic geometries, internal features and challenging passages that could not be cast or otherwise machined. DMLS produces strong, durable metal parts that work well as both functional prototypes or end-use production parts. The process starts by slicing the 3D CAD file data into layers, usually from 20 to 100 micrometers thick, creating a 2D image of each layer; this file format is the industry standard .stl file used on most layer-based 3D printing or stereolithography technologies. This file is then loaded into a file preparation software package that assigns parameters, values and physical supports that allow the file to be interpreted and built by different types of additive manufacturing machines. With selective laser melting, thin layers of atomized fine metal powder are evenly distributed using a coating mechanism onto a substrate plate, usually metal, that is fastened to an indexing table that moves in the vertical (Z) axis. This takes place inside a chamber containing a tightly controlled atmosphere of inert gas, either argon or nitrogen at oxygen levels below 500 parts per million. Once each layer has been distributed, each 2D slice of the part geometry is fused by selectively melting the powder. This is accomplished with a high-power laser beam, usually an ytterbium fiber laser with hundreds of watts. The laser beam is directed in the X and Y directions with two high frequency scanning mirrors. The laser energy is intense enough to permit full melting (welding) of the particles to form solid metal. The process is repeated layer after layer until the part is complete. The DMLS machine uses a high-powered 200 watt Yb-fiber optic laser. Inside the build chamber area, there is a material dispensing platform and a build platform along with a recoater blade used to move new powder over the build platform. The technology fuses metal powder into a solid part by melting it locally using the focused laser beam. Parts are built up additively layer by layer, typically using layers 20 micrometers thick. Materials Selective laser melting (SLM) machines can operate with a work space up to 1 m (39.37 in) in X & Y and can go up to 1 m (39.37 in) Z. Some of the materials being used in this process can include Ni based super alloys, copper, aluminium, stainless steel, tool steel, cobalt chrome, titanium and tungsten. SLM is especially useful for producing tungsten parts because of the high melting point and high ductile-brittle transition temperature of this metal. In order for the material to be used in the process it must exist in atomized form (powder form). These powders are generally gas atomized prealloys, being this the most economical process to obtain spherical powders on an industrial scale. Sphericity is desired because it guarantees a high flowability and packing density, which translates into fast and reproducible spreading of the powder layers. To further optimize flowability, narrow grain size distributions with a low percentage of fine particles like 15 - 45 ¬µm or 20 - 63 ¬µm are typically employed. Currently available alloys used in the process include 17-4 and 15-5 stainless steel, maraging steel, cobalt chromium, inconel 625 and 718, aluminum AlSi10Mg, and titanium Ti6Al4V. The mechanical properties of samples produced using direct metal laser sintering differ from those manufactured using casting. AlSiMg samples produced using direct metal laser sintering exhibit a higher yield(engineering) then those constructed of commercial as- cast A360.0 alloy by 43% when constructed along the xy-plane and 36% along the z-plane. While the yield strength of AlSiMg has been shown to increase in both the xy-plane and z-plane, the elongation at break decreases along the build direction. These improvement of the mechanical properties of the direct metal laser sintering samples has been attributed to a very fine microstructure. The next generation of additive comes through the direct metal laser melting (DMLM) process. The beds have been developed to allow for the melting of the powder to occur just before building the surface. Additionally, industry pressure has added more superalloy powders to the available processing including AM108. It is not only the Print operation and orientation that provides a change in material properties, it is also the required post processing via Hot Isostatic Pressure (HIP) Heat Treat and shot peen that change mechanical properties to a level of noticeable difference in comparison to equiaxed cast or wrought materials. Based on research done at the Tokyo Metropolitan University, it is shown that creep rupture and ductility are typically lower for additive printed Ni based superalloys compared to wrought or cast material. The directionality of print is a major influencing factor along with grain size. Additionally, wear properties are typically better as seen with the studies done on additive Inconel 718 due to surface condition; the study also demonstrated the laser power's influence on density and microstructure. Material Density that is generated during the laser processing parameters can further influence crack behavior such that crack reopening post HIP process is reduced when density is increased. It is critical to have a full overview of the material along with its processing from print to required post-print to be able to finalize the mechanical properties for design use. Overview and benefits Selective laser melting (SLM) is a part of additive manufacturing where a high-power-density laser is used to melt and fuse metallic powders together. This is a fast developing process that is being implemented in both research and industry. Selective Laser Melting is also known as direct melt laser melting or laser bed fusion. This advancement is very important to both material science and the industry because it can not only create custom properties but it can reduce material usage and give more degrees of freedom with designs that manufacturing techniques can't achieve. Selective laser melting is very useful as a full-time materials and process engineer. Requests such as requiring a quick turnaround in manufacturing material or having specific applications that need complex geometries are common issues that occur in industry. Having SLM would really improve the process of not only getting parts created and sold, but making sure the properties align with whatever is needed out in the field. Current challenges that occur with SLM are having a limit in processable materials, having undeveloped process settings and metallurgical defects such as cracking and porosity. The future challenges are being unable to create fully dense parts due to the processing of aluminum alloys.Aluminum powders are light-weight, have high reflectivity, high thermal conductivity, and low laser absorptivity in the range of wavelengths of the fiber lasers which are used in SLM. These challenges can be improved with doing more research in how the materials interact when being fused together. Also if more people understand the material properties and how they interact with specific heat (such as lasers) and different alloys, then there is a better chance we can understand how to avoid these defects and make this process more streamlined. As an advocate for creating new inventions that can help this world, understanding additive manufacturing and how to successfully implement SLM would be a great benefit to our society. Applications The types of applications most suited to the selective laser melting process are complex geometries & structures with thin walls and hidden voids or channels on the one hand or low lot sizes on the other hand. Advantage can be gained when producing hybrid forms where solid and partially formed or lattice type geometries can be produced together to create a single object, such as a hip stem or acetabular cup or other orthopedic implant where oseointegration is enhanced by the surface geometry. Much of the pioneering work with selective laser melting technologies is on lightweight parts for aerospace where traditional manufacturing constraints, such as tooling and physical access to surfaces for machining, restrict the design of components. SLM allows parts to be built additively to form near net shape components rather than by removing waste material. Traditional manufacturing techniques have a relatively high set-up cost (e.g. for creating a mold). While SLM has a high cost per part (mostly because it is time- intensive), it is advisable if only very few parts are to be produced. This is the case e.g. for spare parts of old machines (like vintage cars) or individual products like implants. Tests by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, which is experimenting with the technique to make some difficult-to- fabricate parts from nickel alloys for the J-2X and RS-25 rocket engines, show that difficult to make parts made with the technique are somewhat weaker than forged and milled parts but often avoid the need for welds which are weak points. This technology is used to manufacture direct parts for a variety of industries including aerospace, dental, medical and other industries that have small to medium size, highly complex parts and the tooling industry to make direct tooling inserts. DMLS is a very cost and time effective technology. The technology is used both for rapid prototyping, as it decreases development time for new products, and production manufacturing as a cost saving method to simplify assemblies and complex geometries. With a typical build envelope (e.g., for EOS's EOS M 290) of 250 x 250 x 325 mm, and the ability to ‚Äògrow‚Äô multiple parts at one time, The Northwestern Polytechnical University of China is using a similar system to build structural titanium parts for aircraft. An EADS study shows that use of the process would reduce materials and waste in aerospace applications. On September 5, 2013 Elon Musk tweeted an image of SpaceX's regeneratively-cooled SuperDraco rocket engine chamber emerging from an EOS 3D metal printer, noting that it was composed of the Inconel superalloy. In a surprise move, SpaceX announced in May 2014 that the flight- qualified version of the SuperDraco engine is fully printed, and is the first fully printed rocket engine. Using Inconel, an alloy of nickel and iron, additively-manufactured by direct metal laser sintering, the engine operates at a chamber pressure of at a very high temperature. The engines are contained in a printed protective nacelle, also DMLS-printed, to prevent fault propagation in the event of an engine failure. The engine completed a full qualification test in May 2014, and is slated to make its first orbital spaceflight in April 2018. The ability to 3D print the complex parts was key to achieving the low-mass objective of the engine. According to Elon Musk, \\"It‚Äôs a very complex engine, and it was very difficult to form all the cooling channels, the injector head, and the throttling mechanism. Being able to print very high strength advanced alloys ... was crucial to being able to create the SuperDraco engine as it is.\\" The 3D printing process for the SuperDraco engine dramatically reduces lead-time compared to the traditional cast parts, and \\"has superior strength, ductility, and fracture resistance, with a lower variability in materials properties.\\" Also in 2018, the FDA approved the first ever 3D printed spine implant made from titanium using SLM. = Industry applications = * Aerospace ‚Äì Air ducts, fixtures or mountings holding specific aeronautic instruments, laser-sintering fits both the needs of commercial and military aerospace * Manufacturing ‚Äì Laser-sintering can serve niche markets with low volumes at competitive costs. Laser-sintering is independent of economies of scale, this liberates you from focusing on batch size optimization. * Medical ‚Äì Medical devices are complex, high value products. They have to meet customer requirements exactly. These requirements do not only stem from the operator's personal preferences: legal requirements or norms that differ widely between regions also have to be complied with. This leads to a multitude of varieties and thus small volumes of the variants offered. * Prototyping ‚Äì Laser-sintering can help by making design and functional prototypes available. As a result, functional testing can be initiated quickly and flexibly. At the same time, these prototypes can be used to gauge potential customer acceptance. * Tooling ‚Äì The direct process eliminates tool-path generation and multiple machining processes such as EDM. Tool inserts are built overnight or even in just a few hours. Also the freedom of design can be used to optimize tool performance, for example by integrating conformal cooling channels into the tool. = Other applications = * Parts with cavities, undercuts, draft angles * Fit, form, and function models * Tooling, fixtures, and jigs * Conformal cooling channels * Rotors and impellers * Complex bracketing Potential Selective laser melting or additive manufacturing, sometimes referred to as rapid manufacturing or rapid prototyping, is in its infancy with relatively few users in comparison to conventional methods such as machining, casting or forging metals, although those that are using the technology have become highly proficient. Like any process or method selective laser melting must be suited to the task at hand. Markets such as aerospace or medical orthopedics have been evaluating the technology as a manufacturing process. Barriers to acceptance are high and compliance issues result in long periods of certification and qualification. This is demonstrated by the lack of fully formed international standards by which to measure the performance of competing systems. The standard in question is ASTM F2792-10 Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing Technologies. Difference from selective laser sintering (SLS) The use of SLS refers to the process as applied to a variety of materials such as plastics, glass, and ceramics, as well as metals. What sets SLM apart from other 3D printing process is the ability to fully melt the powder, rather than heating it up to a specific point where the powder grains can fuse together, allowing the porosity of the material to be controlled. On the other hand, SLM can go one step further than SLS, by using the laser to fully melt the metal, meaning the powder is not being fused together but actually liquified long enough to melt the powder grains into a homogeneous part. Therefore, SLM can produce stronger parts because of reduced porosity and greater control over crystal structure, which helps prevent part failure. Additionally, certain types of nanoparticles with minimized lattice misfit, similar atomic packing along matched crystallographic planes and thermodynamic stability can be introduced into metal powder to serve as grain refinement nucleates to achieve crack-free, equiaxed, fine-grained microstructures. However, SLM is only feasible when using a single metal powder. Benefits DMLS has many benefits over traditional manufacturing techniques. The ability to quickly produce a unique part is the most obvious because no special tooling is required and parts can be built in a matter of hours. Additionally, it's the best type of printing to use. There's no stress, and it's easy to use and process. DMLS is also one of the few additive manufacturing technologies being used in production. Since the components are built layer by layer, it is possible to design internal features and passages that could not be cast or otherwise machined. Complex geometries and assemblies with multiple components can be simplified to fewer parts with a more cost-effective assembly. DMLS does not require special tooling like castings, so it is convenient for short production runs. Constraints The aspects of size, feature details and surface finish, as well as print through dimensional error in the Z axis may be factors that should be considered prior to the use of the technology. However, by planning the build in the machine where most features are built in the x and y axis as the material is laid down, the feature tolerances can be managed well. Surfaces usually have to be polished to achieve mirror or extremely smooth finishes. For production tooling, material density of a finished part or insert should be addressed prior to use. For example, in injection molding inserts, any surface imperfections will cause imperfections in the plastic part, and the inserts will have to mate with the base of the mold with temperature and surfaces to prevent problems. Independent of the material system used, the DMLS process leaves a grainy surface finish due to \\"powder particle size, layer-wise building sequence and [the spreading of the metal powder prior to sintering by the powder distribution mechanism].\\" Metallic support structure removal and post processing of the part generated may be a time-consuming process and require the use of machining, EDM and/or grinding machines having the same level of accuracy provided by the RP machine. Laser polishing by means of shallow surface melting of DMLS-produced parts is able to reduce surface roughness by use of a fast-moving laser beam providing \\"just enough heat energy to cause melting of the surface peaks. The molten mass then flows into the surface valleys by surface tension, gravity and laser pressure, thus diminishing the roughness.\\" When using rapid prototyping machines, .stl files, which do not include anything but raw mesh data in binary (generated from Solid Works, CATIA, or other major CAD programs) need further conversion to .cli & .sli files (the format required for non stereolithography machines).STL File Conversion. stereolithography.com Software converts .stl file to .sli files, as with the rest of the process, there can be costs associated with this step.

The film is set against a background of religious fanaticism and, as with other films directed by Hartford-Davis, also includes elements of the sexploitation genre of the early 1970s. The Fiend as originally released runs for 98 minutes, but an edited version of 87 minutes (removing most of its more graphic content) was produced for the American market. The film was released on DVD in 2005; however the DVD uses the cut version. Plot Widow Birdy Wemys has become a devoted member of a fundamentalist fire-and-brimstone religious sect called \\"the Brethren\\", led by the charismatic Minister. Birdy has turned her sizeable home over to the Brethren for use as a church and a recruiting ground, and her son Kenny has also fallen under their spell. Kenny is a troubled individual, dominated by his overbearing mother, introverted and socially inept. He has taken the teachings of the Minister to heart, and feels repulsed by what he sees as sin, lust and temptation being openly flaunted by the young women he sees as he goes about his daily business. The film opens with shots of a terrified young woman in a mini skirt fleeing for her life along a riverbank, interspersed with scenes of a Brethren baptism service in full swing complete with gospel- style music and the congregation working itself into a religious frenzy. The girl is finally cornered by her unseen pursuer, strangled, stripped naked and thrown into the river at the same time as a boy is symbolically submerged during the baptism service. Kenny works two jobs, as a part-time lifeguard at a public swimming pool and a night-time security guard. He returns from his nightshift to morning newspaper headlines screaming \\"Third Nude Body Found!\\" He later goes to the swimming pool, where he sees it as part of his job description to berate female bathers for the skimpiness of their attire. Birdy meanwhile is in failing health; a diabetic, she is dependent on insulin to control her condition but has to obtain supplies surreptitiously as the use of medicine is strictly forbidden by the Brethren's beliefs. A local nurse, Brigitte, is hired to care for Birdy, against Birdy's wishes, and becomes alarmed at what she sees of the Brethren. She passes on her concerns to her sister Paddy, a campaigning journalist eager to write an expos√© of religious cults. In order to infiltrate the Brethren, Paddy decides to pose as an unmarried expectant mother seeking God's forgiveness and redemption from her sins. Kenny descends into a frenzy of killing. One day at the pool, he is outraged when a young woman removes her bikini top and later follows her home to exact retribution for her Godless ways. While on his nocturnal beat he stumbles across a prostitute servicing a client, and she too is brutally despatched. Naked female bodies turn up across London in bizarre circumstances, dropping out of a cement mixer or dangling from a meat hook. Birdy takes such a shine to Paddy that the Minister begins to suspect a suppressed lesbian attraction. Accusing Birdy of \\"foul thoughts\\", he orders her to fast in order to cleanse her soul. Birdy slips into a diabetic coma and Paddy attempts desperately to administer an insulin shot, but is accidentally locked in the cellar by Kenny. Kenny locates a supply of insulin and rushes to his mother, but it is too late and she dies. In his grief Kenny finally finds the courage to stand up to the Minister. Having confessed his identity as the Nude Killer, he exacts vengeance by leaving the Minister crucified in his own church. Cast Critical reception Brian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com wrote that the film \\"begins with a blast, but soon settles into a series of tedious encounters and dull supporting characters\\", and that it \\"[comes] across as a television movie that's occasionally interrupted by scenes of violence and nudity.\\" Home media In November 2018, the film was restored in 2K and released on DVD and Blu-ray by Vinegar Syndrome.

It is a semi- autobiographical portrait of her father, an Italian anarchist. After several banishments for his political activities, her anarchist father was exiled to the small hilltop town of Cutigliano in 1921, 25 km northwest of Pistoia, where he would die of a heart attack in 1925 after being chased by fascist hoodlums.  Biography Gianna Manzini was born in Pistoia. Her mother was Leonilda Mazzoncini, born December 22, 1864 in Pistoia, and her father Giuseppe Manzini, born October 7, 1853 originally from Modena. Her childhood in Pistoia was spent in the anxious company of her mother's family who, disapproving of her anarchist father's beliefs and activities, was instrumental in causing her parents to separate. Gianna and her mother lived with her mother's two sisters, and Gianna's father lived in a rented room in Pistoia and had a clock repair shop on Via Orafo, where she would occasionally see his visiting anarchist friends. The emotional wrench of her parent's separation and her deep love for the father she idolized and later repudiated, only to return full circle as an adult, is recounted in Ritratto in piedi (Full-Length Portrait). Not only did the family drama figure large in her literary creations, but also the Tuscan landscape played a prominent role, beginning with childhood impressions of Pistoia. \\"[The] beautiful blue mountains encircling it from east to west, breathing that pungent perfumed air, an exhilarating delight\\". . . \\"some streets as narrow as corridors, mysterious as whispers (Via Ripa del Sale!) to stir me, open my eyes, bring out a sweet perversity, and protect me at the same time; there had been curves of well-defined activity to persuade me that I lived in a place made for me; those mountains in the background were my cape, my protection‚Ä¶\\"Gianna Manzini, Full-Length Portrait, trans. by Martha King. Italica Press, 2011. =Life in Florence= Manzini moved to Florence with her mother in 1916, to finish high school and attend the university, preparing to be a teacher. Manzini's love affair with the art and architecture and cultural activities of Florence is described in her next-to-last novel, Ritratto in piedi (Full-length Portrait). \\"The new city, Florence, embraced me as I embraced it. I savored the happiness of being alive on that pavement, among those stones, close to the river, flung, cozied, sustained in its multiple movement. I was the ear against an enormous shell. And the city welcomed me, the accommodating and fabulous ear, to its heart. Buildings, stones, walls became horoscopes to me.\\" She taught school for only a few months. The first chapter of her novel Tempo inamorato appeared in the Florentine newspaper, La Nazione, in 1924. This novel, published in 1928, was praised by Eugenio Montale for its \\"intelligence\\" and \\"rare sensitivity.\\"Eugene Montale. La Fiera letteraria. August 5, 1928. With her short-story \\"Passeggiata,\\" published in 1929, she began her collaboration with the periodical Solaria (inaugurated in Florence in 1926 and closed down in 1936). The mission of Solaria was to bring into Italian letters the stimulus of innovative European writers such as Marcel Proust, Andr√© Gide, Virginia Woolf, and James Joyce, and Americans such as Ernest Hemingway. This \\"solarium\\" was in reaction to the prevailing canon that championed the preservation of Italian classical literary tradition, expressed by Alessandro Manzoni and Giacomo Leopardi. Notable Italian literary figures such as Montale, Elio Vittorini collaborated with Solaria. She married the literary critic of La Nazione, Bruno Fallaci, in 1930, a marriage doomed to early failure. Fallaci transferred to Milan in 1933 to write for Corriere della sera. Manzini unceasingly reveals so much of herself in her writing: her literary intentions, failings, regrets, doubts, and memories. She is imprecise or contradictory about the specifics of her life, such as when she moved from Pistoia to Florence, her father‚Äôs age, the year she married. Some dates can be verified by letters and her diary in the Archivio di Gianna Manzini held by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore in Milan. Before the Archivio was made available scholars were often forced to make contradictory conjectures. At the moment, Gianna Manzini's documents are stored in three different places: *the Archivio del Novecento at the Sapienza University of Rome has the majority of the letters, as part of the Archivio Manzini (Manzini Archive); *the Fondo Manzini at the Fondazione Arnoldo e Alberto Mondadori keeps most of her preparatory manuscripts for various works; *the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale (Central National Library) of Rome received Manzini's own library when it acquired Falqui's books in 1978. Between the pages, diverse kinds of material (notes, letters, newspaper clippings) have been found. The three institutions published a joint inventory in 2006.C. BELLO MINCIACCHI, C. MARTIGNONI, A.

They were both married at the time, so they kept their relationship secret until spring 1935, when they both finally got separated from the previous spouses. In the meantime, they wrote to each other's everyday (Manzini often wrote several times a day), while Falqui was in Rome, working at the Reale Accademia d'Italia for the new fascist regime's Italian Dictionary, and Manzini was at Villa Solaia, in the countryside near Siena, guest of her close friend Elena de Bosis Vivante (painter) and her husband Leone Vivante (philosopher). In 1935 Manzini moved to Rome (first in Viale Giulio Cesare, then in Via Lovanio), where she lived with Falqui until his death in March 1974, preceding her death only by a few months. The move to Rome affected her personally and stylistically, as she recounts in Lettera all'editore: Game Plan for a Novel). The 1940s and 1950s were a time of intense literary activity.

Afflicted from childhood with lung weakness and a cough (the protagonist of La Sparviera), and finally dependent on oxygen, she died in Rome on August 31, 1974, five months after the death of her long-time companion.  Style  From the time Manzini's first novel, Tempo innamorato, appeared, to her last prose collection, La soglia, critical curiosity was focused less on content than on her idiosyncratic writing style.

The film was based on a 1987 novel by John Collee, who also wrote the screenplay. Plot Mathew Harris is a porter in a busy hospital in London. While playing his banjo in his bedroom, he dreams of job opportunities, having previously dropped out from studying biology. One evening, he witnesses a car accident outside a local pub, where the driver of a car is killed in a collision with a lorry. Harris knows the man, Simon Hennessey, a doctor at his hospital and discovers he had been applying for a residency at another hospital in Bristol. Harris takes the dead man's mail, completes a job application, and applies for the job himself under the late doctor's identity. After studying medical books and assisting and observing procedures at his hospital, Harris applies and is accepted. Before leaving, he goes to the swimming pool where his friend Moran is. Explaining he is travelling abroad, he gives Moran his silver cigarette case. He quits his job and settles in Bristol where he, as Dr. Simon Hennessey, is assigned to a busy Accident & Emergency (A&E;) department. Despite his inexperience, Harris completes his first few days without major incident, but is reprimanded by his superior regarding his poor patient record keeping. He meets and is aided by a friendly nurse, Christine Taylor. She soon becomes smitten with Harris, helping him through his busy first days. After saving the life of a woman patient, Harris becomes more competent and confident, but he arrogant and corrupted by his newly acquired power and skill. Soon, Taylor and Harris begin an affair, which complicates their work relationship. When a patient, the wife of the chief medic, dies under Harris' care, he is charged with negligence. At his hearing, Taylor takes the blame, which prompts her to resign. One day, Harris unexpectedly meets Moran, who has moved from London to study to be a nurse. When Harris takes Moran to a remote area and admits his impersonation, asking Moran to keep his secret and leave the area, a shocked Moran threatens to report him. Harris follows Moran and pushes him off a cliff. However, Moran is critically injured rather than killed and survives long enough to be brought to the hospital for treatment. When trying to identify Moran, a nurse finds the silver cigarette case, which has Harris's name engraved inside, and assumes that it is him. Harris tries again to kill Moran in A&E;, and succeeds by injecting a blood bag for Moran's emergency surgery with 20% potassium chloride. Meanwhile, Taylor finally figures out Harris' charade, after seeing the real Dr. Simon Hennessey's gravestone in London, while visiting her recently deceased father's grave. She confronts Harris, who convinces her to identify Moran as Harris, so he can be legally declared dead and continue his impersonation. Facing growing criticism, Harris transfers to another hospital in nearby Salisbury. He has however also agreed with Taylor to stop impersonating a doctor and move to London with her. However, rather than travel to London and Taylor, he heads for Salisbury. In the final scene, while Taylor hesitates over whether to report Harris' charade (which will also reveal her dishonest misidentification of Moran), Harris continues his charade at his new hospital.

He founded the production group Grupo Ukamau. He won the ALBA Prize for Arts in 2009. Film career Jorge Sanjin√©s is known for his Marxist agenda, bringing highly political films of a revolutionary aesthetic to peasant and working-class audiences in the Andean highlands. The films that characterized the 'New Latin American Cinema' or Third Cinema provided an alternative to First (Capitalist) Cinema, making the social collective act as the protagonists of these films rather than an individual hero. The 1969 film Blood of the Condor (Yawar Mallku) by Sanjin√©s reveals the story of the undisclosed sterilization of Andean Indian women by a \\"Progress Corps\\" (standing in for the American Peace Corps) clinic. This film is thought to have led to the expulsion of the Peace Corps from Bolivia in an act of anti-imperialist cultural nationalism by the indigenous people.Geidel, Molly. \\"Sowing Death in Our Women's Wombs\\": Modernization and Indigenous Nationalism in the 1960s Peace Corps and Jorge Sanjin√©s' Yawar Mallku. American Quarterly - Volume 62, Number 3, September 2010, pp. 763-786 After showings of Yawar Mallku, Sanjin√©s learned that many peasants had criticism about the difficulty of his films due to the use of flashback for narration, as his film-making was greatly influenced by European art cinema, and about the lack of attention to denouncing the causes of the indigenous peoples' issues. He took this into account when making his next film, called El coraje del pueblo (The Courage of the People), in 1971,about the Massacre of San Juan. El coraje del pueblo worked with untrained actors, many of them peasants themselves. This marked the beginning of a stage in Sanjin√©s's career characterized by filming \\"with the people.\\"Rosalind Galt, Karl Schoonover. Global Art Cinema: New Theories and Histories. 2010, pp. 359. His next film, El enemigo principal (1973) explores the effects of U.S. imperialism through the relationship between wealthy landowners and the indigenous peasant population. Jorge Sanjin√©s worked under strained film-making conditions, with limited funding, few production facilities, and little Bolivian movie tradition to draw upon.  Problems of Form and Content in Revolutionary Cinema  \\"Problems of Form and Content in Revolutionary Cinema\\" is a film manifesto written by Jorge Sanjin√©s in 1976 as a part of the Third Cinema Latin American film movement.http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/L/A-Robert.R.Lauer-1/Martin1.html. This manifesto, along with Glauber Rocha‚Äôs ‚ÄúAesthetic of Hunger‚Äù (1965), Julio Garc√≠a Espinosa‚Äôs \\"For an Imperfect Cinema\\" (1969), and \\"Toward a Third Cinema\\" (1969) by Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino. are accredited to creating the Third Cinema movement. In line with other Third Cinema manifestos, Sanjin√©s advocates moving away from the Hollywood notion of Auteur cinema, to a revolutionary filmmaking style intended to have a political impacthttp://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520276741 In explaining the importance of revolutionary cinema, Sanjin√©s makes note of the importance of using film as a method of communication in expressing revolutionary concepts. He argues that film can be a good medium for these ideas because of the widespread communicability of film. Although advocating the use of film, he makes note of the importance of being careful when using such a capitalist concept. In the argument against Hollywood's notions of cinema, Sanjin√©s attempts to dissuade from the use of individualism in film. As the Third Cinema is ultimately revolutionary in concept, Sanjin√©s says that revolutionary films must be a collective work. The use of language and speech, as a revolutionary tool is talked about in depth in this manifesto. The idea of script is challenged, Sanjin√©s instead advocating using only actors qualified to act out things based on their own memory. An example of this is during the filming of The Courage of the People Sanjin√©s only used actors who could portray the depicted events as they themselves remember them. Sanjin√©s continues to say that \\"Cinema and reality came together\\". This shows how Sanjin√©s views the importance of breaking free from traditional film structures to achieve a truthful and revolutionary final product The final section of this manifesto talks about the problems of distributing revolutionary cinema, and how it might seem futile to make a film if you have no means of distribution, it is still important to make the film. Although many of these revolutionary films are undistributable where they could have the largest impact, Sanjin√©s tells of how there are other ways of distributing the film throughout the world and advocates the use of these channels. Although anti-imperialist, Sanjin√©s advocates the viewings of his films to European and American audiences for educational purposes. * Short films * Sue√±os y realidades (1962) * Revoluci√≥n (1963) Feature films * Ukamau, or And So It Is (1966) * Yawar Mallku, or Blood of the Condor (1969) * El coraje del pueblo, or The Courage of the People (1971) * El enemigo principal, or The Principal Enemy (1974) * Fuera de aqu√≠, or Get out of Here!

Azerbaijani statements claim that the territory of the modern Armenian republic were lands that once belonged to Azerbaijanis. Its claims are primarily hinged over the contention that the current Armenian territory was under the rule of various Turkic tribes, empires and khanates from the late medieval period until the Treaty of Turkmenchay signed after the Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828\\\\. The concept has received official sanction by the government of Azerbaijan, and has been used by its current president, Ilham Aliyev, who has repeatedly stated that the territory of Armenia is a part of \\"ancient Turk and Azerbaijani land.\\"See, for example, Ilham Aliyev's speech in Baku. \\"We do not argue any territorial claim against Armenia. However we can, because the territory which present-day Armenia locates is an ancient Turk and Azerbaijani land\\" History Paris Peace Conference in 1919, laying claims over its neighbor Armenia. Azerbaijani territorial pretensions at the time stretched all the way to the Black Sea, envisioning Armenia as a rump state centered around Yerevan and what is now northern Armenia.See The present-day territory of Armenia along with the western part of Azerbaijan, including Nakhichevan were historically part of the Armenian Highlands. In the medieval era, the Oghuz Turkic Seljuks, Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu held sway in the region. Afterward the area was under the control of the Safavid Empire. Under the Iranian Safavids, the area that constitutes the bulk of the present-day Republic of Armenia, was organized as the Erivan Province. The Erivan Province also had Nakhchivan as one of its administrative jurisdictions. A number of the Safavid era governors of the Erivan Province were of Turkic origin. Together with the Karabagh province, the Erivan Province comprised Iranian Armenia. Iranian ruler Nader Shah (r. 1736-1747) later established the Erivan Khanate (i.e. province); from then on, together with the smaller Nakchivan Khanate, these two administrative entities constituted Iranian Armenia. In the Erivan Khanate, the Armenian citizens had partial autonomy under the immediate jurisdiction of the melik of Erevan. In the Qajar era, members of the royal Qajar dynasty were appointed as governors of the Erivan khanate, until the Russian occupation in 1828.\\"Iranians, in order to save the rest of eastern Armenia, heavily subsidized the region and appointed a capable governor, Hosein Qoli Khan, to administer it.\\" -- A Concise History of the Armenian People: (from Ancient Times to the Present), George Bournoutian, Mazda Publishers (2002), p. 215 The heads of the provincial government of the Erivan Khanate were thus directly related to the central ruling dynasty. In 1828, per the Treaty of Turkmenchay, Iran was forced to cede the Erivan and Nakhchivan Khanates to the Russians. These two territories, which had constituted Iranian Armenia prior to 1828, were added together by the Russians and then renamed into the \\"Armenian Oblast\\". Demographic basis Surrender of Erivan Fortress in 1827 painted by Franz Roubaud Comparison table of Armenian, Azerbaijani and Kurdish population of Armenia Until the mid-fourteenth century, Armenians had constituted a majority in Eastern Armenia. At the close of the fourteenth century, after Timur's campaigns, Islam had become the dominant faith, and Armenians became a minority in Eastern Armenia. After centuries of constant warfare on the Armenian Plateau, many Armenians chose to emigrate and settle elsewhere. Following Shah Abbas I's massive relocation of Armenians and Muslims in 1604-05,Arakel of Tabriz. The Books of Histories; chapter 4. Quote: \\"[The Shah] deep inside understood that he would be unable to resist Sinan Pasha, i.e. the Sardar of Jalaloghlu, in a[n open] battle. Therefore he ordered to relocate the whole population of Armenia - Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, to Persia, so that the Ottomans find the country depopulated.\\" their numbers dwindled even further. Some 80% of the population of Iranian Armenia were Muslims (Persians, Turkics, and Kurds) whereas Christian Armenians constituted a minority of about 20%. As a result of the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), Iran was forced to cede Iranian Armenia (which also constituted the present-day Republic of Armenia), to the Russians. After the Russian administration took hold of Iranian Armenia, the ethnic make-up shifted, and thus for the first time in more than four centuries, ethnic Armenians started to form a majority once again in one part of historic Armenia. The new Russian administration encouraged the settling of ethnic Armenians from Iran proper and Ottoman Turkey. As a result, by 1832, the number of ethnic Armenians had matched that of the Muslims. Anyhow, it would be only after the Crimean War and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, which brought another influx of Turkish Armenians, that ethnic Armenians once again established a solid majority in Eastern Armenia. Nevertheless, the city of Erivan remained having a Muslim majority up to the twentieth century. According to the traveller H. F. B. Lynch, the city was about 50% Armenian and 50% Muslim (Azerbaijanis and Persians) in the early 1890s. According to the Russian census of 1897, a significant population of Azeris still lived in Russian Armenia. They numbered about 300,000 persons or 37.8% in Russia's Erivan Governorate (roughly corresponding to most of present-day central Armenia, the Iƒüdƒ±r Province of Turkey, and Azerbaijan's Nakhichevan exclave, but excluding Zangezur and most of northern Armenia). Most lived in rural areas and were engaged in farming and carpet-weaving. They formed the majority in 4 of the governorate's 7 districts (including Igdir and Nakhichevan, which are not part of Armenia today and Sharur-Daralagyoz district which is mostly in Azerbaijan) and were nearly as many as the Armenians in Yerevan (42.6% against 43.2%).Russian Empire Census 1897 At the time, Eastern Armenian cultural life was centered more around the holy city of Echmiadzin, seat of the Armenian Apostolic Church.Thomas de Waal.

It will provide integrated air and missile defense, and even periscope detection, for the Flight III s; variants are under development for retrofitting Burke Flight IIA, and installation aboard FFG(X), Ford-class aircraft carriers and San Antonio-class LPDs. The first delivery of the AN/SPY-6 to the USN took place on 20 July 2020. Development On October 10, 2013, \\"Raytheon Company (RTN) [was] awarded a $385,742,176 cost-plus-incentive-fee contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase design, development, integration, test and delivery of Air and Missile Defense S-band Radar (AMDR-S) and Radar Suite Controller (RSC).\\" In September 2010, the Navy awarded technology development contracts to Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon to develop the S-band radar and radar suite controller (RSC). X-band radar development reportedly will come under separate contracts. The Navy hopes to place AMDR on Flight III Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, possibly beginning in 2016. Those ships currently mount the Aegis Combat System, produced by Lockheed Martin. In 2013, the Navy cut almost $10 billion from the cost of the program by adopting a smaller less capable system that will be challenged by \\"future threats\\". the program is expected to deliver 22 radars at a total cost of $6,598m; they will cost $300m/unit in serial production. Testing is planned for 2021 and Initial operating capability is planned for March 2023. The Navy then was forced to halt the contract in response to a challenge by Lockheed. Lockheed officially withdrew their protest on January 10, 2014, allowing the Navy to lift the stop work order. Technology The AMDR system consists of two primary radars and a radar suite controller (RSC) to coordinate the sensors. An S-band radar is to provide volume search, tracking, ballistic missile defense discrimination and missile communications while the X-band radar is to provide horizon search, precision tracking, missile communication and terminal illumination of targets. The S-band and X-band sensors will also share functionality including radar navigation, periscope detection, as well as missile guidance and communication. AMDR is intended as a scalable system; the Burke deckhouse can only accommodate a 4.3 m (14 ft) version but the USN claim they need a radar of 6.1 m (20 ft) or more to meet future ballistic missile threats. This would require a new ship design; Ingalls have proposed the as the basis for a ballistic missile defense cruiser with 6.1 m (20 ft) AMDR. To cut costs the first twelve AMDR sets will have an X-band component based on the existing SPQ-9B rotating radar, to be replaced by a new X-band radar in set 13 that will be more capable against future threats. The transmit-receive modules will use new gallium nitride semiconductor technology. This will allow for higher power density than the previous gallium arsenide radar modules.\\"The Heart of the Navy‚Äôs Next Destroyer.\\" The new radar will require twice the electrical power as the previous generation while generating over 35 times as much radar power. Although it was not an initial requirement, the AMDR may be capable of performing electronic attacks using its AESA antenna. Airborne AESA radar systems, like the APG-77 used on the F-22 Raptor, and the APG-81 and APG-79 used on the F-35 Lightning II, and F/A-18 Super Hornet/EA-18G Growler respectively, and have demonstrated their capability to conduct electronic attack. The contenders for the Navy's Next Generation Jammer all used Gallium Nitride-based (GaN) transmit-receiver modules for their EW systems, which enables the possibility that the high- power GaN-based AESA radar used on Flight III ships can perform the mission.

It is one of the oldest and most traditional manufacturers of chocolate and nougat candy in Italy. Originally founded in 1860 in the town of Novi Ligure, Piedmont it was sold in 2013 to the Toks√∂z company of Istanbul. It has been said that for Italians, \\"Pernigotti is to chocolate as Ferrari is to cars.\\"  History  Founded in 1860 as a grocery shop, the company was owned by the Pernigotti family for five generations until 1995. By 1882 its quality was sufficiently well known that King Umberto I granted the company the privilege of using the royal coat of arms on the factory insignia on April 25, 1882. In 1914 with the First World War at the gates, the Italian government forbids the use of sugar for the preparation of confectionery products, including nougat: what could represent a serious obstacle to production, is transformed, thanks to the brilliant intuition by Francesco Pernigotti, in an innovation that enriches the quality of the company. The absence of sugar, in fact, is wisely filled by a greater concentration of honey, giving life to a new nougat with a unique consistency. In 1919 Paolo Pernigotti replaced his father Francesco at the helm of the company. At the end of World War II its main production plant was destroyed when it moved its headquarters to the current factory in central Novi Ligure. Pernigotti's most famous brands include Gianduiotto, the production of which began in 1927, and Cremino, Pepitas and Nocciolato. In 1980 comes a period of crisis that will lead to the sale of Sperlari in 1981 to the Americans of the H.J. Heinz Company. In 1995 Stefano Pernigotti, left without heirs after the death of his two very young children, Paolo, 17 age, and Lorenzo, 13 age, in a road accident in Uruguay on 10 July 1980, decides to sell Pernigotti to the Averna family, known for the successes linked to the alcoholic beverages sector. In 2000 he also left Streglio to a niece. On 11 July 2013 the company was sold by the Averna family to the Turkish group belonging to the Toks√∂z family, active in the confectionery, pharmaceutical and energy sectors.Pernigotti, Averna cede il marchio, andr√† al gruppo turco Toksoz On 1 October 2019, Pernigotti announced they had sold their \\"Ice & Pastry\\" branch to Optima Group. As part of the transaction Optima acquired the ‚ÄúPernigotti Maestri Gelatieri Italiani‚Äù brand. On 11 August 2020, Stefano Pernigotti dies at the age of 98.  Production  The enterprise also produces other chocolate products, nougats, easter eggs and \\"semilavorati\\" of ice cream (basic cream to make ice cream). On 7 November 2018, Toks√∂z announced that Pernigotti would close its main production facility at Novi Ligure with the loss of 200 jobs. At the time it was reported that Pernigotti had accumulated losses of ‚Ç¨13 million over the previous five years. In the same period, turnover had dropped from ‚Ç¨75 million to ‚Ç¨50 million. Conflicting reports at the time suggested that Toks√∂z was planning to move production to Turkey while others reported that Pernigotti planned to outsource production only within Italy. The closure has been cited as another example of the impact of Italy's approach to restructuring fundamentally viable companies who are in difficulty.

Its construction in 1925 marked the beginning of the era of long distance trunk lines in telephone communication. The building was listed by the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History Though this is considered the most prestigious building designed by architect Eugene Stopper, he was perhaps uniquely qualified to design this building. His background designing banks is reflected in the customer service areas that dominates the first floor, and his experience designing industrial buildings in reinforced concrete, is reflected the upper floors where the telephone exchanges were housed. The building is constructed in the Moderne style of brick with limestone used on the first and fourteenth floors. The three upper floors are set-back in the style of New York skyscrapers of the era. The first floor interior is decorated with marble walls, terrazzo floors, and the company's iconic Bell trade-mark. The introduction of long distance trunk lines in the early 1920s caused a boom in telephone traffic, requiring many new switchboards and telephone operators. Philadelphia was a key location in this development, being about halfway between New York City and Washington, D.C., and being the departure point for the trunk line to Chicago, which followed the Pennsylvania Railroad's Main Line westward. The company constructed a series of new buildings with unimaginative names to house the long distance business, including New York's Telephone Building and the St. Louis Telephone Building, which were both built about 1926, and the Ohio Bell Telephone Building in Cleveland and the New Jersey Bell Telephone Building in Newark, both completed before 1930. The New York and New Jersey buildings are also listed on the NRHP, and the Cleveland building is a contributing building to a NRHP Historic District. The trunk lines were placed close to Philadelphia's fairly new downtown area, which developed around City Hall rather than the older business area to the east. Once placed, the location of the trunk lines dictated the location of other Bell Telephone buildings which needed easy access to the lines. The company's 1950 stainless steel skyscraper at 16th and Cherry Streets, and the 1991 Bell Atlantic Tower at 18th and Arch Streets both follow this pattern. In 1970, the long distance exchanges were moved to a modern facility, the building was renovated as telephone company offices, and air conditioning was installed. About 1990, the building was sold and converted to use as a self-storage facilityGeorge E. Thomas, [ Pennsylvania Historic Resources Survey: Bell Telephone Company Building].

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands adjacent to Burley-on-the-Hill House. History Building of the church started in the 12th century. By the end of that century it consisted of a nave, chancel and north aisle. During the following century the south aisle was added. In the 14th century the tower was built. The church was restored in about 1796 when square-headed windows were inserted, and box pews were added. In 1869‚Äì70 the church was extensively restored by J. L. Pearson. This included rebuilding the east end, replacing all but one of the windows, and adding a new porch. The church was declared redundant on 1 May 1984, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 17 February 1988. Architecture Looking from the churchyard across to the mansion =Exterior= Holy Cross is constructed in stone of differing colours, and has red tile roofs. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a three-bay chancel, a north porch, and a west tower. The nave measures by , the chancel by , the north aisle by , and the south aisle by . The tower is in three stages separated by string courses. It is set on a moulded plinth, and has paired buttresses at the corners. On the west side of the bottom stage is a two-light window with Decorated tracery, and on the north side in the middle stage is a clock face. On each side of the top stage is a tall two-light transomed bell opening. At the top of the tower is a battlemented parapet, under which is a moulding carved with flowers and animals' heads. There is a gargoyle at each corner. The east window has five lights and geometrical tracery. All the windows along the clerestory and the aisles are flat-headed. On the north wall of the church is a chimney and a priest's doorway. =Interior= The two arcades are of different age and style. The north arcade dates from the 12th century and is Norman in style with round arches, while the south arcade is Gothic, dating from the 13th century with pointed arches. Between the nave and the chancel is a low screen in pierced stone. The octagonal font is Perpendicular in style. The stained glass in the east window dates from about 1870 and is by Clayton and Bell, while that in the west window is by Westlake. In the church is an alabaster monument with mutilated effigies dating from the late 15th century.

Feminist political theory encompasses a broad scope of approaches. It overlaps with related areas including feminist jurisprudence/feminist legal theory; feminist political philosophy; female- centered empirical research in political science; and feminist research methods (feminist method) for use in political science the social sciences. Indeed, one scholar notes that, insofar as almost all versions of feminism involve \\"demonstrating the ways in which politics, understood as power relations, is present in our everyday lives,\\" one could reasonably \\"describe feminist theory as a whole as a kind of political philosophy.\\" What frequently distinguishes feminist political theory from feminism broadly is the specific examination of the state and its role in the reproduction or redressing of gender inequality. In addition to being broad and multidisciplinary, the field is relatively new, inherently innovative, and still expanding; the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy explains that \\"feminist political philosophy serves as a field for developing new ideals, practices, and justifications for how political institutions and practices should be organized and reconstructed.\\"  History  For summary of feminist history more broadly, see feminism. Feminist political theory as a term only consolidated in the West during Women's Liberation movements of the 1960s and 70s. Previously, very few works of political theory explicitly considered women's political situation. John Stuart Mill‚Äôs 1861 call for women's suffrage in The Subjection of Women is a notable exception. In the early 20th Century, Simone de Beauvoir‚Äôs 1949 work The Second Sex exposed the power dynamics surrounding womanhood and laid the foundation for subsequent feminist theories exposing women's social subjugation. In the 1980s and 1990s, feminist theory expanded into the legal realm led by Catharine MacKinnon‚Äôs and Andrea Dworkin‚Äôs campaigns against pornography. Several distinct stages are sketched out below. = Liberal feminism = Liberal feminism marks an important approach to feminist politics which was especially pervasive during the first half of the twentieth century. Some of the most well known examples of liberal feminist writing were published far earlier, including Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) and John Stuart Mill's The Subjection of Women (1869). A common theme of liberal feminism is an emphasis on equal opportunity via fair opportunity and equal political rights. In addition, according to The International Encyclopedia of Ethics, \\"[L]iberal feminisms of both the past and the present retain some commitment to the distinction between the public and private realms ‚Äì a distinction [which is the] focus of much critique within feminist political theory.\\" = Marxist, socialist and radical feminism = Marxist feminism and socialist feminism considered classism as the primary source of women's oppression. \\"... Marxist theory does not allow women any more than other classes of oppressed people to constitute themselves as historical subjects, because Marxism does not take into account the fact that a class also consists of individuals one by one. Class consciousness is not enough. We must try to understand philosophically (politically) these concepts of 'subject' and 'class consciousness' and how they work in relation to our history.\\" Early radical feminism was grounded in the rejection of the nuclear family and femininity as constructed within heterosexuality. and Radical feminism abdicated any previous forms of political theory to develop entirely new theories rooted primarily on the direct experiences of women. Radical Feminism has experienced many transitions over time, including facing an anti feminist backlash(humanism) but the theoretical history and survival remains important to understand. Postmodernist Feminism Postmodernist feminists agree with others that gender is the most important identity, however what makes Postmodern feminists different is that they are interested in how people 'pick and mix' their identities. This is a key part of Postmodernist thought, not just from feminism. They are also interested in the topic of masculinity, and instead reject the stereotypical aspects of feminism, embracing it as a positive aspect of identity. One of their key goals is to disable the patriarchal norms that have led to gender inequality.Ebert, Teresa L. (Dec 1991). \\"The \\"Difference\\" of Postmodern Feminism\\". College English. 53 (8): 886‚Äì904. doi:10.2307/377692. ISSN 0010-0994. JSTOR 377692. ^ Jump up to: a b  Topics of inquiry  = Feminist epistemology = A key aspect of feminist political theory/philosophy is feminist epistemology. Feminist epistemologists question the objectivity of social and philosophical sciences by contending that standards of authority and credibility are socially constructed and thus reflect and re-entrench the sociopolitical status quo. Thus, one common feminist methodological solution is to include many diverse voices reflecting all parts of society in the process of knowledge-making. = Gendered political institutions = Political theory on the gendering of institutions explores questions such what does it mean for an institution to be ‚Äúgendered,\\" how can one evaluate whether an institution is gendered, and what are the consequences of gendered institutions for the people who work within them (of all genders). An example of such related scholarship is Eileen McDonagh's book The Motherless State which explores how socially feminized \\"motherly\\" attributes have been stripped from modern governance models. An exploration of the history of patriarchy is central to understanding how political institutions have become gendered and the impact this has on feminist political theory. The importance of understanding patriarchy historically is explored in Judith M. Bennet's book 'History Matter: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism'. A definition of patriarchy is provided by Sylvia Walby in her book 'Theorising patriarchy'. This shows how patriarchal systems have historically caused the oppression of women and the male domination of politics. = Group identity/identity politics = Theorist studying this aspect of feminist political theory question the construction of women as an identity group. On a basic level, they consider whether it is even possible to come to some sort of conclusion about a \\"women\\" group‚Äôs relation to politics. One facet of the debate involves intersectionality and whether women from different racial and cultural backgrounds have enough in common to form a political group. Another facet questions whether transgender women should be included in the group \\"women\\" insofar as they lack many of the experiences of girlhood and womanhood which bind \\"women\\" together as a distinct group. Yet another approach to this topic includes redefining \\"groupness;\\" for example, Iris Marion Young has suggested women are more of a \\"seriality\\" rather than a group insofar as they undergo similar experiences but in isolation of each other, lacking a sense of group identity. = Political leadership and gender = This field addresses how women lead differently than their male counterparts as legislators, executives, and judges. Some scholars in this field study how political leadership is itself masculinized to exclude the kinds of political leadership women most frequently provide, often outside of formal offices. For example, Hardy-Fanta looks at grassroots political work in Latino communities in the U.S. to identify feminized political leadership roles, ultimately concluding that Latina women provide the most critical leadership and work in those communities‚Äîdespite the fact that most studies overlook their leadership because it does not occur within formal officeholding roles.

Early life Ekeroth was born in Malm√∂ to a Jewish mother, Janina Kazarina, originally from Kazakhstan in Central Asia (which was then part of the Soviet Union), who arrived as a refugee from Poland to Sweden in the 1970s, together with her mother, Ekeroth's grandmother and sisters. He is of Jewish descent, with an atheistic life stance. Ekeroth studied economics at Lund University. In a National Swedish Radio interview, Ekeroth traced the origins of his political views to his school days, where he went to what he says was an immigrant-dominated class in Halmstad, where he was bullied by \\"groups of immigrants from Africa and the Middle East\\" and connected his experience to the overall immigration problems. Journalist and author Gellert Tamas claimed that the majority of the class apparently had a Swedish background. According to Tamas, the immigrant- background minority, including Ekeroth, who is of Central Asian Jewish descent, had their background in Eastern Europe. Other students from his time at √ñsterg√•rdsskolan in Halmstad have said in interviews that Ekeroth was \\"a quiet, shy kid\\" and claim he was heavily bullied by his class and \\"perhaps the entire school\\". Political career Ekeroth in 2014 Ekeroth joined the Sweden Democrats in 2006. Since 2007, he is the party's secretary for international affairs. He has been the member of the Riksdag since 4 October 2010 after being elected in the general election the same year. Ekeroth represented the Stockholm County constituency. In parliament, he has been a member of the Committee on Justice and a deputy member of Committee on European Union Affairs. Ekeroth was a board member of the pan-European eurosceptic European Alliance for Freedom. In October 2006, Ekeroth was fired from his internship at the Swedish embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, after the embassy had found out about his involvement with the Sweden Democrats. The embassy's actions were later criticised by the Swedish Chancellor of Justice, G√∂ran Lambertz, who ruled that the firing was illegal and a breach of the Swedish constitutional laws. The Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who are responsible for all Swedish embassies abroad, also had to pay damages to Ekeroth. In February 2018, the head of the Sweden Democrats election committee, Michael Rosenberg, confirmed that Ekeroth would not be on the party's proposed list of candidates for the parliament in the next elections. In the same month, Ekeroth delivered a speech, partly in Hungarian, which was highly critical of Sweden, in the Swedish Parliament. Ekeroth has also hinted at plans of moving to Hungary, following in the footsteps of brother and former politician Ted Ekeroth. =Iron pipe scandal= In November 2012, Ekeroth took a break from his duties after the leakage of a video filmed with his mobile phone from an event which became known as the Iron pipe scandal. Erik Almqvist had two years earlier published an edited version of the video to show how he and his party colleagues Ekeroth and Christian Westling had been verbally abused that evening. The film released in November 2012 by Expressen showed Ekeroth and his colleagues arming themselves with iron pipes after arguing with a drunken man. Ekeroth argued with a young woman, whom he allegedly pushed against a car, while he can be heard telling her: \\"Back off! Back off!\\". Almqvist used racist and sexist remarks without Ekeroth reacting against it. The police came to the place and the drunken man said that he saw Ekeroth pushing the woman. Ekeroth and his colleagues had returned when they heard the sirens and said to the police that they had been threatened by the man. While Almqvist was forced to resign, Ekeroth remained in the parliament. Social Democratic Party and chairman of the Committee on Justice, Morgan Johansson was quoted as saying \\"I wonder what his constituents will think of him being in the Riksdag and getting paid without any real duties\\". Ekeroth later invoiced the Swedish newspapers who used the film or stills from the event. For example, Svenska Dagbladet received an invoice of 51,725 Swedish kronor (approximately ‚Ç¨5,500). Media career Ekeroth has denied editorial involvement in the news website Avpixlat, though he has been in communication with the editorial staff via emails and the site uses his personal bank account to manage its finances. Avpixlat has been called a \\"hate site\\", for what are claimed to be expressions of violence and xenophobia. Ekeroth has also denied publishing any articles at the news website, but was quickly found to have published articles as recently as one month before his denial. The tax authorities also found him legally obliged to pay taxes on those donations to Avpixlat, of which 70,000 Swedish kronor had immediately been further transferred to other private accounts owned by Ekeroth. As Avpixlat has been discontinued, Ekeroth has moved on to register the website Samh√§llsnytt in his name, and operate it, along with chief editor Tommy Carlsson, former Sweden Democrats politician Erik Almqvist, Russian-born journalist \\"Egor Putilov\\" (a pseudonym for Alexander Yarovenko, currently known as Martin Dahlin), and others associated with Sweden Democrats. Personal life Ekeroth resides in Budapest, Hungary, having moved there in March 2018. =Assault and verdict= On 24 November 2016, Ekeroth was reported to the police for assault after an incident involving a 20 year old male. The alleged victim claims that he made a sarcastic comment relating to the \\"Iron pipe scandal\\" towards the politician before being punched by Ekeroth. Ekeroth argued self-defense while witnesses from the queue alleged that no punches were thrown at Ekeroth by the victim or anyone else. Prior to the incident, Ekeroth had twice been denied entry to the nightclub in question, Solidaritet at Stureplan in Stockholm. The club¬¥s bouncers claim that Ekeroth was highly intoxicated and was acting aggressively at the time. According to club management, Ekeroth was denied entry to the club as they could not guarantee his and other patrons safety, due to the politician¬¥s highly intoxicated state, while Ekeroth claims that he was denied entry due to his political views and also that he was attacked one month earlier on his way from work. On 3 February 2017, following the conclusion of the investigation, the prosecutor filed charges for assault. In June 2017, Ekeroth was found guilty of assault by the court found Ekeroth and he was sentenced to pay a fine. The Svea Court of Appeal later overturned the verdict on the grounds that the prosecutor had failed to disprove that Ekeroth acted in self-defence. Ekeroth has previously been involved in bar and club incidents, both as an attacker and a victim.

Currency war, also known as competitive devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall in relation to other currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls, exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more and more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries. Historically, competitive devaluations have been rare as countries have generally preferred to maintain a high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war broke out in the 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade. According to Guido Mantega, former Brazilian Minister for Finance, a global currency war broke out in 2010. This view was echoed by numerous other government officials and financial journalists from around the world. Other senior policy makers and journalists suggested the phrase \\"currency war\\" overstated the extent of hostility. With a few exceptions, such as Mantega, even commentators who agreed there had been a currency war in 2010 generally concluded that it had fizzled out by mid-2011. States engaging in possible competitive devaluation since 2010 have used a mix of policy tools, including direct government intervention, the imposition of capital controls, and, indirectly, quantitative easing. While many countries experienced undesirable upward pressure on their exchange rates and took part in the ongoing arguments, the most notable dimension of the 2010‚Äì11 episode was the rhetorical conflict between the United States and China over the valuation of the yuan. In January 2013, measures announced by Japan which were expected to devalue its currency sparked concern of a possible second 21st century currency war breaking out, this time with the principal source of tension being not China versus the US, but Japan versus the Eurozone. By late February, concerns of a new outbreak of currency war had been mostly allayed, after the G7 and G20 issued statements committing to avoid competitive devaluation. After the European Central Bank launched a fresh programme of quantitative easing in January 2015, there was once again an intensification of discussion about currency war. Background In the absence of intervention in the foreign exchange market by national government authorities, the exchange rate of a country's currency is determined, in general, by market forces of supply and demand at a point in time. Government authorities may intervene in the market from time to time to achieve specific policy objectives, such as maintaining its balance of trade or to give its exporters a competitive advantage in international trade. =Reasons for intentional devaluation= Cumulative current account balance 1980‚Äì2008 (US$ Billions) based on International Monetary Fund data. Devaluation, with its adverse consequences, has historically rarely been a preferred strategy. According to economist Richard N. Cooper, writing in 1971, a substantial devaluation is one of the most \\"traumatic\\" policies a government can adopt ‚Äì it almost always resulted in cries of outrage and calls for the government to be replaced. Devaluation can lead to a reduction in citizens' standard of living as their purchasing power is reduced both when they buy imports and when they travel abroad. It also can add to inflationary pressure. Devaluation can make interest payments on international debt more expensive if those debts are denominated in a foreign currency, and it can discourage foreign investors. At least until the 21st century, a strong currency was commonly seen as a mark of prestige, while devaluation was associated with weak governments. However, when a country is suffering from high unemployment or wishes to pursue a policy of export-led growth, a lower exchange rate can be seen as advantageous. From the early 1980s the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has proposed devaluation as a potential solution for developing nations that are consistently spending more on imports than they earn on exports. A lower value for the home currency will raise the price for imports while making exports cheaper. This tends to encourage more domestic production, which raises employment and gross domestic product (GDP). Such a positive impact is not guaranteed however, due for example to effects from the Marshall‚ÄìLerner condition.See also this 2018 FT article about recent devaluations typically not helping exporters. Devaluation can be seen as an attractive solution to unemployment when other options, like increased public spending, are ruled out due to high public debt, or when a country has a balance of payments deficit which a devaluation would help correct. A reason for preferring devaluation common among emerging economies is that maintaining a relatively low exchange rate helps them build up foreign exchange reserves, which can protect against future financial crises. =Mechanism for devaluation= A state wishing to devalue, or at least check the appreciation of its currency, must work within the constraints of the prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation ‚Äì if it sells its own currency to buy other currenciesIn practice this chiefly means purchasing assets such as government bonds that are denominated in other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall ‚Äì a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall in the value of the currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets. A third method is for authorities simply to talk down the value of their currency by hinting at future action to discourage speculators from betting on a future rise, though sometimes this has little discernible effect. Finally, a central bank can effect a devaluation by lowering its base rate of interest; however this sometimes has limited effect, and, since the end of World War II, most central banks have set their base rate according to the needs of their domestic economy. If a country's authorities wish to devalue or prevent appreciation against market forces exerting upwards pressure on the currency, and retain control of interest rates, as is usually the case, they will need capital controls in place‚Äîdue to conditions that arise from the impossible trinity trilemma. =Quantitative easing= Quantitative easing (QE) is the practice in which a central bank tries to mitigate a potential or actual recession by increasing the money supply for its domestic economy. This can be done by printing money and injecting it into the domestic economy via open market operations. There may be a promise to destroy any newly created money once the economy improves in order to avoid inflation. Quantitative easing was widely used as a response to the financial crises that began in 2007, especially by the United States and the United Kingdom, and, to a lesser extent, the Eurozone. The Bank of Japan was the first central bank to claim to have used such a policy.To practice quantitative easing on a wide scale it helps to have a reserve currency, as do the United States, Japan, UK, and Eurozone, otherwise there is a risk of market speculators triggering runaway devaluation to a far greater extent than would be helpful to the country.Theoretically, money could be shared out among the entire population, though, in practice, the new money is often used to buy assets from financial institutions. The idea is that the extra money will help banks restore their balance sheets, and will then flow from there to other areas of the economy where it is needed, boosting spending and investment. As of November 2010 however, credit availability has remained tight in countries that have undertaken QE, suggesting that money is not flowing freely from the banks to the rest of the economy. Although the U.S. administration has denied that devaluing their currency was part of their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending in a country with a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain. In early November 2010 the United States launched QE2, the second round of quantitative easing, which had been expected. The Federal Reserve made an additional $600 billion available for the purchase of financial assets. This prompted widespread criticism from China, Germany, and Brazil that the United States was using QE2 to try to devalue its currency without consideration to the effect the resulting capital inflows might have on emerging economies. Some leading figures from the critical countries, such as Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, have said the QE2 is understandable given the challenges facing the United States. Wang Jun, the Chinese Vice Finance Minister suggested QE2 could \\"help the revival of the global economy tremendously\\". President Barack Obama has defended QE2, saying it would help the U.S. economy to grow, which would be \\"good for the world as a whole\\". Japan also launched a second round of quantitative easing though to a lesser extent than the United States; Britain and the Eurozone did not launch an additional QE in 2010. =International conditions required for currency war= For a widespread currency war to occur a large proportion of significant economies must wish to devalue their currencies at once. This has so far only happened during a global economic downturn. An individual currency devaluation has to involve a corresponding rise in value for at least one other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currenciesThough not necessarily evenly: in the late 20th and early 21st century countries would often devalue specifically against the dollar, so while the devaluing currency would lower its exchange rate against all currencies, a corresponding rise against the global average might be confined largely just to the dollar and any currencies currently governed by a dollar peg. A further complication is that the dollar is often affected by such huge daily flows on the foreign exchange that the rise caused by a small devaluation may be offset by other transactions. and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness. Historical overview = Up to 1930 = For millennia, going back to at least the Classical period, governments have often devalued their currency by reducing its intrinsic value. Methods have included reducing the percentage of gold in coins, or substituting less precious metals for gold. However, until the 19th century,Despite global trade growing substantially in the 17th and 18th centuries the proportion of the world's trade that occurred between nations was very low, so exchanges rates were not generally a matter of great concern. Rather than being seen as a means to help exporters, the debasement of currency was motivated by a desire to increase the domestic money supply and the ruling authorities' wealth through seigniorage, especially when they needed to finance wars or pay debts. A notable example is the substantial devaluations which occurred during the Napoleonic wars. When nations wished to compete economically they typically practiced mercantilism ‚Äì this still involved attempts to boost exports while limiting imports, but rarely by means of devaluation.Devaluation could however be used as a last resort by mercantilist nations seeking to correct an adverse trade balance ‚Äì see for example chapter 23 of Keynes' General Theory A favoured method was to protect home industries using current account controls such as tariffs. From the late 18th century, and especially in Britain, which, for much of the 19th century, was the world's largest economy, mercantilism became increasingly discredited by the rival theory of free trade, which held that the best way to encourage prosperity would be to allow trade to occur free of government imposed controls. The intrinsic value of money became formalised with a gold standard being widely adopted from about 1870‚Äì1914, so while the global economy was now becoming sufficiently integrated for competitive devaluation to occur there was little opportunity. Following the end of World War I, many countries other than the US experienced recession and few immediately returned to the gold standard, so several of the conditions for a currency war were in place. However, currency war did not occur as the U.K. was trying to raise the value of its currency back to its pre-war levels, effectively cooperating with the countries that wished to devalue against the market.This was against the interests of British workers and industrialists who preferred devaluation, but was in the interests of the financial sector, with government also influenced by a moral argument that they had the duty to restore the value of the pound as many other countries had used it as a reserve currency and trusted GB to maintain its value. By the mid-1920s many former members of the gold standard had rejoined, and while the standard did not work as successfully as it had pre war, there was no widespread competitive devaluation. =Currency war in the Great Depression= During the Great Depression of the 1930s, most countries abandoned the gold standard. With widespread high unemployment, devaluations became common, a policy that has frequently been described as \\"beggar thy neighbour\\", in which countries purportedly compete to export unemployment. However, because the effects of a devaluation would soon be offset by a corresponding devaluation and in many cases retaliatory tariffs or other barriers by trading partners, few nations would gain an enduring advantage. The exact starting date of the 1930s currency war is open to debate. The three principal parties were Britain, France, and the United States. For most of the 1920s the three generally had coinciding interests; both the US and France supported Britain's efforts to raise Sterling's value against market forces. Collaboration was aided by strong personal friendships among the nations' central bankers, especially between Britain's Montagu Norman and America's Benjamin Strong until the latter's early death in 1928. Soon after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, France lost faith in Sterling as a source of value and begun selling it heavily on the markets. From Britain's perspective both France and the US were no longer playing by the rules of the gold standard. Instead of allowing gold inflows to increase their money supplies (which would have expanded those economies but reduced their trade surpluses) France and the US began sterilising the inflows, building up hoards of gold. These factors contributed to the Sterling crises of 1931; in September of that year Britain substantially devalued and took the pound off the gold standard. For several years after this global trade was disrupted by competitive devaluation and by retaliatory tariffs. The currency war of the 1930s is generally considered to have ended with the Tripartite monetary agreement of 1936. =Bretton Woods era= From the end of World War II until about 1971, the Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed exchange rates meant that competitive devaluation was not an option, which was one of the design objectives of the systems' architects. Additionally, global growth was generally very high in this period, so there was little incentive for currency war even if it had been possible. =1973 to 2000= While some of the conditions to allow a currency war were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and at no point were there enough states simultaneously wanting to devalue for a currency war to break out.Though a few commentators have asserted the Nixon shock was in part an act of currency war, and also the pressure exerted by the United States in the months leading up to the Plaza accords. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving not against other countries but against market forces that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved to the view that it was best to leave the running of their economies to the markets and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.Though developing economies were encouraged to pursue export led growth ‚Äì see Washington Consensus. =2000 to 2008= During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran critically low on foreign reserves, leaving them forced to accept harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep the value of their currencies low.Some had been devaluing from as early as the 1980s, but it was only after 1999 that it became common, with the developing world as a whole running a CA surplus instead of a deficit from 1999. (e.g. see Wolf (2009) p31 ‚Äì 39) This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies while at the same time building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy‚Äîin the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.There were exceptions to this: Kenneth Rogoff and Maurice Obstfeld began warning that the developing record imbalances was a major issue from as early as 2001, joined by Nouriel Roubini in 2004. This is not say there was no popular concern; by 2005 for example a chorus of US executives along with trade union and mid- ranking government officials had been speaking out about what they perceived to be unfair trade practices by China. These concerns were soon partially allayed. With the global economy doing well, China was able to abandon its dollar peg in 2005, allowing a substantial appreciation of the Yuan up to 2007, while still increasing its exports. The dollar peg was later re- established as the financial crises began to reduce China's export orders. Economists such as Michael P. Dooley, Peter M. Garber, and David Folkerts- Landau described the new economic relationship between emerging economies and the US as Bretton Woods II. =Competitive devaluation after 2009= As the world's leading Reserve currency, the US dollar was central to the 2010‚Äì2011 outbreak of currency war. By 2009 some of the conditions required for a currency war had returned, with a severe economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies about the size of their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman became one of the first to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation. He also coined the phrase competitive non-appreciation. On 27 September 2010, Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega announced that the world is \\"in the midst of an international currency war.\\" Numerous financial journalists agreed with Mantega's view, such as the Financial Times' Alan Beattie and The Telegraph's Ambrose Evans- Pritchard. Journalists linked Mantega's announcement to recent interventions by various countries seeking to devalue their exchange rate including China, Japan, Colombia, Israel and Switzerland. Other analysts such as Goldman Sach's Jim O'Neill asserted that fears of a currency war were exaggerated. In September, senior policy makers such as Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then managing director of the IMF, and Tim Geithner, US Secretary of the Treasury, were reported as saying the chances of a genuine currency war breaking out were low; however by early October, Strauss-Kahn was warning that the risk of a currency war was real. He also suggested the IMF could help resolve the trade imbalances which could be the underlying casus belli for conflicts over currency valuations. Mr Strauss-Kahn said that using currencies as weapons \\"is not a solution [and] it can even lead to a very bad situation. There's no domestic solution to a global problem.\\" Considerable attention had been focused on the US, due to its quantitative easing programmes, and on China. For much of 2009 and 2010, China was under pressure from the US to allow the yuan to appreciate. Between June and October 2010, China allowed a 2% appreciation, but there were concerns from Western observers that China only relaxed its intervention when under heavy pressure. The fixed peg was not abandoned until just before the June G20 meeting, after which the yuan appreciated by about 1%, only to devalue slowly again, until further US pressure in September when it again appreciated relatively steeply, just prior to the September US Congressional hearings to discuss measures to force a revaluation. Reuters suggested that both China and the United States were \\"winning\\" the currency war, holding down their currencies while pushing up the value of the Euro, the Yen, and the currencies of many emerging economies. Martin Wolf, an economics leader writer with the Financial Times, suggested there may be advantages in western economies taking a more confrontational approach against China, which in recent years had been by far the biggest practitioner of competitive devaluation. Although he advised that rather than using protectionist measures which may spark a trade war, a better tactic would be to use targeted capital controls against China to prevent them buying foreign assets in order to further devalue the yuan, as previously suggested by Daniel Gros, Director of the Centre for European Policy Studies. A contrasting view was published on 19 October, with a paper from Chinese economist Yiping Huang arguing that the US did not win the last \\"currency war\\" with Japan,Huang classes the conflicting opinions over the relative valuations of the US dollar and Japanese yen in the 1980s as a currency war, though the label was not widely used for that period. and has even less of a chance against China; but should focus instead on broader \\"structural adjustments\\" at the November 2010 G-20 Seoul summit. Discussion over currency war and imbalances dominated the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit, but little progress was made in resolving the issue. In the first half of 2011 analysts and the financial press widely reported that the currency war had ended or at least entered a lull, though speaking in July 2011 Guido Mantega told the Financial Times that the conflict was still ongoing. As investor confidence in the global economic outlook fell in early August, Bloomberg suggested the currency war had entered a new phase. This followed renewed talk of a possible third round of quantitative easing by the US and interventions over the first three days of August by Switzerland and Japan to push down the value of their currencies. In September, as part of her opening speech for the 66th United Nations Debate, and also in an article for the Financial Times, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff called for the currency war to be ended by increased use of floating currencies and greater cooperation and solidarity among major economies, with exchange rate policies set for the good of all rather than having individual nations striving to gain an advantage for themselves. In March 2012, Rousseff said Brazil was still experiencing undesirable upwards pressure on its currency, with its Finance Minister Guido Mantega saying his country will no longer \\"play the fool\\" and allow others to get away with competitive devaluation, announcing new measures aimed at limiting further appreciation for the Real. By June however, the Real had fallen substantially from its peak against the Dollar, and Mantega had been able to begin relaxing his anti- appreciation measures. =Currency war in 2013= In mid January 2013, Japan's central bank signaled the intention to launch an open ended bond buying programme which would likely devalue the yen. This resulted in short lived but intense period of alarm about the risk of a possible fresh round of currency war. Numerous senior central bankers and finance ministers issued public warnings, the first being Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy chairman at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including Park Jae-wan, the finance minister for South Korea, and by Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009‚Äì11 period were not intense enough to count as competitive devaluation, but that a genuine currency war is now a real possibility. Japan's economy minister Akira Amari has said that the Bank of Japan's bond buying programme is intended to combat deflation, and not to weaken the yen. In early February, ECB president Mario Draghi agreed that expansionary monetary policy like QE have not been undertaken to deliberately cause devaluation. Draghi's statement did however hint that the ECB may take action if the Euro continues to appreciate, and this saw the value of the European currency fall considerably. A mid February statement from the G7 affirmed the advanced economies commitment to avoid currency war. It was initially read by the markets as an endorsement of Japan's actions, though later clarification suggested the US would like Japan to tone down some of its language, specifically by not linking policies like QE to an expressed desire to devalue the Yen. Most commentators have asserted that if a new round of competitive devaluation occurs it would be harmful for the global economy. However some analysts have stated that Japan's planned actions could be in the long term interests of the rest of the world; just as he did for the 2010‚Äì11 incident, economist Barry Eichengreen has suggested that even if many other countries start intervening against their currencies it could boost growth worldwide, as the effects would be similar to semi-coordinated global monetary expansion. Other analysts have expressed skepticism about the risk of a war breaking out, with Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, advising that: \\"A real currency war remains a remote possibility.\\" On 15 February, a statement issued from the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Moscow affirmed that Japan would not face high level international criticism for its planned monetary policy. In a remark endorsed by US Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, the IMF's managing director Christine Lagarde said that recent concerns about a possible currency war had been \\"overblown\\". Paul Krugman has echoed Eichengreen's view that central bank's unconventional monetary policy is best understood as a shared concern to boost growth, not as currency war. Goldman Sachs strategist Kamakshya Trivedi has suggested that rising stock markets imply that market players generally agree that central bank's actions are best understood as monetary easing and not as competitive devaluation. Other analysts have however continued to assert that ongoing tensions over currency valuation remain, with currency war and even trade war still a significant risk. Central bank officials ranging from New Zealand and Switzerland to China have made fresh statements about possible further interventions against their currencies. Analyses has been published by currency strategists at RBS, scoring countries on their potential to undertake intervention, measuring their relative intention to weaken their currency and their capacity to do so. Ratings are based on the openness of a country's economy, export growth and real effective exchange rate (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has to weaken its currency without damaging its economy. , Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing and able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least. From March 2013, concerns over further currency war diminished, though in November several journalists and analysts warned of a possible fresh outbreak. The likely principal source of tension appeared to shift once again, this time not being the U.S. versus China or the Eurozone versus Japan, but the U.S. versus Germany. In late October U.S. treasury officials had criticized Germany for running an excessively large current account surplus, thus acting as a drag on the global economy. =Currency war in 2015= A ‚Ç¨60bn per month quantitative easing programme was launched in January 2015 by the European Central Bank. While lowering the value of the Euro was not part of the programme's official objectives, there was much speculation that the new Q.E. represents an escalation of currency war, especially from analysts working in the FX markets. David Woo for example, a managing director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, stated there was a \\"growing consensus\\" among market participants that states are indeed engaging in a stealthy currency war. A Financial Times editorial however claimed that rhetoric about currency war was once again misguided. In August 2015, China devalued the yuan by just under 3%, partially due to a weakening export figures of ‚àí8.3% in the previous month. The drop in export is caused by the loss of competitiveness against other major export countries including Japan and Germany, where the currency had been drastically devalued during the previous quantitative easing operations. It sparked a new round of devaluation among Asian currencies, including the Vietnam dong and the Kazakhstan tenge. Comparison between 1932 and 21st-century currency wars Migrant Mother by Dorothea Lange (1936). This portrait of a 32-year-old farm-worker with seven children became an iconic photograph symbolising defiance in the face of adversity. A currency war contributed to the worldwide economic hardship of the 1930s Great Depression. Both the 1930s and the outbreak of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility because of more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that the later period's devaluations were invariably caused by nations expanding their money supplies by creating money to buy foreign currency, in the case of direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out, leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. There has been no collaborative intent, but some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion, which will help the global economy. Not all economists agree that further expansionary policy would help even if it is co-ordinated, and some fear it would cause excess inflation. James Zhan of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), however, warned in October 2010 that the fluctuations in exchange rates were already causing corporations to scale back their international investments. Comparing the situation in 2010 with the currency war of the 1930s, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of the Daily Telegraph suggested a new currency war may be beneficial for countries suffering from trade deficits. He noted that in the 1930s, it was countries with a big surplus that were severely impacted once competitive devaluation began. He also suggested that overly-confrontational tactics may backfire on the US by damaging the status of the dollar as a global reserve currency. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, also drew a comparison with competitive devaluation in the interwar period, referring to the sterilisation of gold inflows by France and America, which helped them sustain large trade surpluses but also caused deflationary pressure on their trading partners, contributing to the Great Depression. Bernanke stated that the example of the 1930s implies that the \\"pursuit of export-led growth cannot ultimately succeed if the implications of that strategy for global growth and stability are not taken into account.\\" In February 2013, Gavyn Davies for The Financial Times emphasized that a key difference between the 1930s and the 21st-century outbreaks is that the former had some retaliations between countries being carried out not by devaluations but by increases in import tariffs, which tend to be much more disruptive to international trade. Other uses The term \\"currency war\\" is sometimes used with meanings that are not related to competitive devaluation. In the 2007 book, Currency Wars by Chinese economist Song Hongbing, the term is sometimes used in a somewhat contrary sense, to refer to an alleged practice where unscrupulous bankers lend to emerging market countries and then speculate against the emerging state's currency by trying to force it down in value against the wishes of that states' government.Neither the book nor its sequel Currency War 2 are available yet in English, but are best sellers in China and South East Asia. In another book of the same name, John Cooley uses the term to refer to the efforts of a state's monetary authorities to protect its currency from forgers, whether they are simple criminals or agents of foreign governments trying to devalue a currency and cause excess inflation against the home government's wishes. Jim Rickards, in his 2011 book \\"Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis,\\" argues that the consequences of the Fed's attempts to prop up economic growth could be devastating for American national security. Although Rickard's book is largely concerned with currency war as competitive devaluation, it uses a broader definition of the term, classing policies that cause inflation as currency war. Such policies can be seen as metaphorical warfare against those who have monetary assets in favor of those who do not, but unless the effects of rising inflation on international trade are offset by a devaluation, inflationary policies tend to make a country's exports less competitive against foreign countries. In their review of the book, Publishers Weekly said: \\"Rickards's first book is an outgrowth of his contributions and a later two-day war game simulation held at the Applied Physics Laboratory's Warfare Analysis Laboratory. He argues that a financial attack against the U.S. could destroy confidence in the dollar. In Rickards's view, the Fed's policy of quantitative easing by lessening confidence in the dollar, may lead to chaos in global financial markets.\\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/9781591844495 Review of Currency Wars, Publishers Weekly. 24 October 2011 Kirkus Reviews said: \\"In Rickards' view, the world is currently going through a third currency war (\\"CWIII\\") based on competitive devaluations. CWII occurred in the 1960s and '70s and culminated in Nixon's decision to take the dollar off the gold standard. CWI followed World War I and included the 1923 German hyperinflation and Roosevelt's devaluation of the dollar against gold in 1933. Rickards demonstrates that competitive devaluations are a race to the bottom, and thus instruments of a sort of warfare. CWIII, he writes, is characterized by the Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing, which he ascribes to what he calls \\"extensive theoretical work\\" on depreciation, negative interest rates and stimulation achieved at the expense of other countries. He offers a view of how the continued depreciation and devaluation of the dollar will ultimately lead to a collapse, which he asserts will come about through a widespread abandonment of a worthless inflated instrument. Rickards also provides possible scenarios for the future, including collaboration among a variety of currencies, emergence of a world central bank and a forceful U.S. return to a gold standard through an emergency powers‚Äìbased legal regime. The author emphasizes that these questions are matters of policy and choice, which can be different.\\"http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james- rickards/currency-wars-next-global-crisis/ Kirkus Reviews: Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis, 15 October 2011. Historically, the term has been used to refer to the competition between Japan and China for their currencies to be used as the preferred tender in parts of Asia in the years leading up to Second Sino-Japanese War.

In the aftermath, GameTable Online adopted the games at their website. The games from this arrangement were Acquire, Axis & Allies, Battle Cry, Guillotine, and Vegas Showdown. In September 2012, GameTable Online opened a second website, www.rpgtableonline.com. RPG Table Online uses GTO's game technology to host role-playing games via the Internet. GameTable shut down at the start of New Year's Day 2015 Pacific time. Games The games at GameTable Online spanned the range from public domain classic, \\"beer-and-pretzel\\" light games, German- style board games to American strategy games. Games that were based on licensed game properties were built with the permission of game publishers and/or designers and were modeled to look their real world counterparts. Despite the strong presence of Wizards of the Coast games, GameTable Online featured games from a variety of publishers.

Two orebodies, the Upper Group 2 (UG2) and the Merensky Reef, host about 70% of the world's platinum group metals (PGM), and pose major extraction problems for the mining industry in their faults, dykes, joints, domes, iron-rich ultramafic pegmatoids, rolls and dunite pipes. The greatest mining problems, though, are presented by potholes. The massive intrusion of molten magma, predating the nearby Vredefort impact by at least 30 million years, led to partial to complete melting of the cumulus floor already in place. Flow and turbulence, high temperatures and chemical reactions, sculpted and potholed the surface of the floor in a process similar to the erosion caused by running water. With the end of the outpouring, when emplacement ceased, cooling of the magma started, leaving the potholes filled, and creating a fault surface at the interface of the pothole and the filling magma. The final phase was when crystallisation of chromitite was followed by that of pyroxene and plagioclase, while the contents of the potholes, also consisting of UG2 or Merensky Reef, but having followed a different cooling profile, showed little or no crystallisation of chromitite. The problems posed by potholes to mining operations are rooted in the fracturing and fragmentation of the material in potholes and their surroundings. These lead to ground instabilities, especially in the hanging wall, and serious safety hazards. Mining is generally abandoned when more than about 40% of the raise line is potholed. A crew for developing new raise lines is usually on standby for such cases, incurring considerable development and labour costs. In horizontal section potholes are roughly circular to elliptical and vary in diameter from 20 m to more than 1 km. In vertical section their shape is generally dish-like and may be quite asymmetric.The morphology of potholes in the UG2 chromitite layer and Merensky Reef (pothole reef facies) at Union Section, Rustenberg Platinum Mines - K.

Everest. \\"1st\\", \\"2nd\\", and \\"3rd\\" indicate the Three Steps. The Three Steps are three prominent rocky steps on the northeast ridge of Mount Everest. They are located at altitudes of , , and . The Second Step is especially significant both historically and in mountaineering terms. Any climber who wants to climb on the normal route from the north of the summit must negotiate these three stages. Photo of upright=1.25 The First Step consists of large boulders that pose a serious obstacle, even for experienced climbers, because of their height above sea level. Many mountaineers have died near the First Step, among them \\"Green Boots\\", a corpse wearing neon green climbing boots and a red coat, which serves as a somber landmark for climbers to gauge their distance to the top, and which has now been possibly identified as Tsewang Paljor. His fellow climbers, who also perished on the same day as he in 1996, are Tsewang Smanla and Dorje Morup. Other climbers have died under that rock as well, namely David Sharp and Francys Arsentiev. The Second Step is the best known of the rocky steps. The steep section, at an altitude of 8,610 m, has a climbing height of 40 metres, of which the last five are almost vertical. The step was climbed for the first time in 1960, by Wang Fuzhou, Gongbu and Qu Yinhua, while their teammate Liu Lianman volunteered to be a human ladder. The climbing difficulty of this spot was reduced in 1975 when a Chinese team affixed an aluminium ladder to the step that has been used since then by almost all climbers. In 2007, out of safety considerations, the original ladder was replaced with a new one by Chinese and international mountaineers. The original ladder is now on display at the Mount Qomolangma Museum in Tibet. The Third Step is easiest to climb. Its climbing height is about 10 metres, after which the summit snowfield is reached. Important climbs of the Second Step The 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition was the first to attempt to climb Mount Everest. It was followed by further British expeditions in 1922, 1924, and 1933. The climbers had to make the ascent from the north, since Nepal was closed. The situation became reversed after the Chinese invasion of Tibet; expeditions launched after that had to use the southern approach through Nepal. The technical difficulties, especially in climbing the Second Step, were still unknown. There is ongoing discussion as to whether the Second Step was ever surmounted by George Mallory and Andrew Irvine in 1924. It was surmounted in 1960 as part of the first ascent of Mount Everest via the north route, when a shoulder stand was used to climb the last five metres. The step was first climbed unaided in 1985, by the Spaniard √íscar Cadiach. He assessed the final rock face as 5.7 to 5.8 (V+ in UIAA classification). Theo Fritsche, an Austrian, climbed the step in 2001 free solo on-sight and came to a similar conclusion. Conrad Anker climbed the Second Step in 1999 and assessed the level of difficulty as 5.10. On this ascent Anker supported himself using the Chinese ladder. In 2007, Anker repeated the climb with Leo Houlding; this time, however, he first removed the ladder in order to climb the step unaided.  Sources  * Mantovani, Roberto and Diemberger, Kurt (1997).

Erebine moths are found on all continents except Antarctica, but reach their greatest diversity in the tropics. While the exact number of species belonging to the Erebinae is not known, the subfamily is estimated to include around 10,000 species. Some well-known Erebinae include underwing moths (Catocala) and witch moths (Thermesiini). Many of the species in the subfamily have medium to large wingspans (7 to 10 cm, 3 to 4 inches), up to nearly 30 cm in the white witch moth (Thysania agrippina), which has the widest wingspan of all Lepidoptera. Erebine caterpillars feed on a broad range of plants; many species feed on grasses and legumes, and a few are pests of castor bean, sugarcane, rice, as well as pistachios and blackberries.  Morphology  Erebine moths possess a number of adaptations for predator defense. Most Erebinae, such as Zale have mottled, drably colored hindwings to better blend in with grass and tree trunks. In some Erebinae, such as Catocala, cryptically colored forewings conceal brightly colored hindwings which are suddenly revealed when the moth is disturbed from rest. The sudden exposure of these bright colors is thought to startle vertebrate predators, giving the moths extra time to escape. Like other Noctuoidea, erebine moths can detect the calls of echolocating bats or other approaching predators using hearing organs (tympana), which are among the most sensitive in the superfamily. Taxonomy Prior to recent phylogenetic studies on the superfamily Noctuoidea, most Erebinae were classified within the noctuid subfamily Catocalinae, on the basis of a classification proposed by George Hampson at the start of the 20th century. Based on mounting evidence from molecular phylogenetic studies, Michael Fibiger and J. Donald Lafontaine transferred Erebinae and relatives from the Noctuidae to the Erebidae, and reinstated Erebinae as a subfamily. Later, Catocalinae was synonymized with Erebinae in the classifications proposed by Lafontaine and Christian Schmidt and Zahiri et al. A historical summary of the systematics of this group is provided by Jeremy Daniel Holloway, and a more detailed review of Erebinae taxonomy can be found in Nicholas T. Homziak et al. The most recent study by Zahriri et al. forms the basis for the current definition of the Erebinae. On the basis of consistent molecular support, Zahiri et al. identified several potential morphological synapomorphies for the subfamily: proboscis with smooth apex and sensilla styloconica dorsally, modified seventh abdominal sternite in the female, divided in to two lobes surrounding the ostium bursae (female copulatory opening). In the larvae, dorsolateral tubercles on segment A8, and pupae often with waxy bloom. Within the Erebinae, Zahiri et al. recognized the following 19 tribes: Tribes *Acantholipini *Audeini *Catephiini *Catocalini *Cocytiini *Ercheiini *Erebini *Euclidiini *Hulodini *Hypopyrini *Melipotini *Ommatophorini *Omopterini *Ophiusini *Pandesmini *Pericymini *Poaphilini *Sypnini *Thermesiini *Incertae sedis File:Pl.6-15-Ugia transversa (Moore, 1882) (Iluza).JPG|Acantholipini: Ugia transversa File:Audea hypostigmata.JPG|Audeini: Audea hypostigmata File:Catephia alchymista.jpg|Catephiini: Catephia alchymista File:Catocala chelidonia uniforma.JPG|Catocalini: Catocala chelidonia File:Cocytia Durvillei.jpg|Cocytiini: Cocytia durvillii File:Ercheia multilinea.jpg|Ercheiini: Ercheia multilinea File:Erebus Macrops.jpg|Erebini: Erebus macrops File:Callistege.mi.2040.jpg|Euclidiini: Callistege mi File:Hulodes caranea (Noctuidae Catocalinae).jpg|Hulodini: Hulodes caranea File:Hypopyra capensis (13890401290).jpg|Hypopyrini: Hypopyra capensis File:- 8591 ‚Äì Phoberia atomaris ‚Äì Common Oak Moth (17082063132).jpg|Melipotini: Phoberia atomaris File:Áû≥Â§úËõæ Ommatophora luminosa (Cramer,1780) (10239537663).jpg|Ommatophorini: Ommatophora luminosa File:Zale lunata ‚Äì Lunate Zale Moth (14659256598).jpg|Omopterini: Zale lunata File:Ophiusa discriminans female dorsal.jpg|Ophiusini: Ophiusa discriminans File:Pandesma submurina dorsal.jpg|Pandesmini: Pandesma submurina File:Pericyma_mendax_(Walker,_1858).jpg|Pericymini: Pericyma mendax File:Dysgonia algira.jpg|Poaphilini: Dysgonia algira File:Pterocyclophora huntei - Leyte - Philippines - 06-2010 (8372567909).jpg|Sypnini: Pterocyclophora huntei File:Flickr - ggallice - Thysania zenobia d.jpg|Thermesiini: Thysania zenobia Genera with tribe not available: * Honeyia  References  *Fauna Europaea (2011): Erebinae.

The variables may be two columns of a given data set of observations, often called a sample, or two components of a multivariate random variable with a known distribution. Several types of correlation coefficient exist, each with their own definition and own range of usability and characteristics. They all assume values in the range from ‚àí1 to +1, where ¬±1 indicates the strongest possible agreement and 0 the strongest possible disagreement. As tools of analysis, correlation coefficients present certain problems, including the propensity of some types to be distorted by outliers and the possibility of incorrectly being used to infer a causal relationship between the variables (for more, see Correlation does not imply causation). Types There are several different measures for the degree of correlation in data, depending on the kind of data: principally whether the data is a measurement, ordinal, or categorical. = Pearson = The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, also known as , , or Pearson's , is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables that is defined as the covariance of the variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. This is the best-known and most commonly used type of correlation coefficient. When the term \\"correlation coefficient\\" is used without further qualification, it usually refers to the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. = Intra-class = Intraclass correlation (ICC) is a descriptive statistic that can be used, when quantitative measurements are made on units that are organized into groups; it describes how strongly units in the same group resemble each other. = Rank = Rank correlation is a measure of the relationship between the rankings of two variables, or two rankings of the same variable: *Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a measure of how well the relationship between two variables can be described by a monotonic function. *The Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient is a measure of the portion of ranks that match between two data sets. *Goodman and Kruskal's gamma is a measure of the strength of association of the cross tabulated data when both variables are measured at the ordinal level. = Tetrachoric and Polychoric = The polychoric correlation coefficient measures association between two ordered-categorical variables. It's technically defined as the estimate of the Pearson correlation coefficient one would obtain if: # The two variables were measured on a continuous scale, instead of as ordered-category variables. # The two continuous variables followed a bivariate normal distribution. When both variables are dichotomous instead of ordered- categorical, the polychoric correlation coefficient is called the tetrachoric correlation coefficient.

Unlike agnosia, these impairments are due to damages prior to the perception process. Vision loss Degrees of vision loss vary dramatically, although the ICD-9 released in 1979 categorized them into three tiers: normal vision, low vision, and blindness. Two significant causes of vision loss due to sensory failures include media opacity and optic nerve diseases, although hypoxia and retinal disease can also lead to blindness. Most causes of vision loss can cause varying degrees of damage, from total blindness to a negligible effect. Media opacity occurs in the presence of opacities in the eye tissues or fluid, distorting and/or blocking the image prior to contact with the photoreceptor cells. Vision loss often results despite correctly functioning retinal receptors. Optic nerve diseases such as optic neuritis or retrobulbar neuritis lead to dysfunction in the afferent nerve pathway once the signal has been correctly transmitted from retinal photoreceptors. Partial or total vision loss may affect every single area of a person's life. Though loss of eyesight may occur naturally as we age, trauma to the eye or exposure to hazardous conditions may also cause this serious condition. Workers in virtually any field may be at risk of sustaining eye injuries through trauma or exposure. A traumatic eye injury occurs when the eye itself sustains some form of trauma, whether a penetrating injury such as a laceration or a non- penetrating injury such as an impact. Because the eye is a delicate and complex organ, even a slight injury may have a temporary or permanent effect on eyesight. Hearing loss Similarly to vision loss, hearing loss can vary from full or partial inability to detect some or all frequencies of sound which can typically be heard by members of their species. For humans, this range is approximately 20 Hz to 20 kHz at ~6.5 dB, although a 10 dB correction is often allowed for the elderly. Primary causes of hearing loss due to an impaired sensory system include long-term exposure to environmental noise, which can damage the mechanoreceptors responsible for receiving sound vibrations, as well as multiple diseases, such as CMV or meningitis, which damage the cochlea and auditory nerve, respectively. Hearing loss may be gradual or sudden. Hearing loss may be very mild, resulting in minor difficulties with conversation, or as severe as complete deafness. The speed with which hearing loss occurs may give clues as to the cause. If hearing loss is sudden, it may be from trauma or a problem with blood circulation. A gradual onset is suggestive of other causes such as aging or a tumor. If you also have other associated neurological problems, such as tinnitus or vertigo, it may indicate a problem with the nerves in the ear or brain. Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral hearing loss is most often associated with conductive causes, trauma, and acoustic neuromas. Pain in the ear is associated with ear infections, trauma, and obstruction in the canal. Anosmia Anosmia is the inability to perceive odor, or in other words a lack of functioning olfaction. Many patients may experience unilateral or bilateral anosmia. A temporary loss of smell can be caused by a blocked nose or infection. In contrast, a permanent loss of smell may be caused by death of olfactory receptor neurons in the nose or by brain injury in which there is damage to the olfactory nerve or damage to brain areas that process smell. The lack of the sense of smell at birth, usually due to genetic factors, is referred to as congenital anosmia. The diagnosis of anosmia as well as the degree of impairment can now be tested much more efficiently and effectively than ever before thanks to \\"smell testing kits\\" that have been made available as well as screening tests which use materials that most clinics would readily have. Many cases of congenital anosmia remain unreported and undiagnosed. Since the disorder is present from birth the individual may have little or no understanding of the sense of smell, hence are unaware of the deficit. Somatosensory loss The somatosensory system is a complex sensory system made up of a number of different receptors, including thermoreceptors, nociceptors, mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. It also comprises essential processing centres, or sensory modalities, such as proprioception, touch, temperature, and nociception. The sensory receptors cover the skin and epithelia, skeletal muscles, bones and joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system. While touch (also called tactile or tactual perception) is considered one of the five traditional senses, the impression of touch is formed from several modalities. In medicine, the colloquial term \\"touch\\" is usually replaced with \\"somatic senses\\" to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved. Insensitivity to somatosensory stimuli, such as heat, cold, touch, and pain, are most commonly a result of a more general physical impairment associated with paralysis. Damage to the spinal cord or other major nerve fiber may lead to a termination of both afferent and efferent signals to varying areas of the body, causing both a loss of touch and a loss of motor coordination. Other types of somatosensory loss include hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, which consists of ineffective afferent neurons with fully functioning efferent neurons; essentially, motor movement without somatosensation. Sensory loss can occur due to a minor nick or lesion on the spinal cord which creates a problem within the neurosystem. This can lead to loss of smell, taste, touch, sight, and hearing. In most cases it often leads to issues with touch. Sometimes people cannot feel touch at all while other times a light finger tap feels like someone has punched them. There are medications and therapies that can help control the symptoms of sensory loss and deprivation. Ageusia Ageusia is the loss of taste, particularly the inability to detect sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami (meaning \\"pleasant/savory taste\\"). It is sometimes confused with anosmia (a loss of the sense of smell). Because the tongue can only indicate texture and differentiate between sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, most of what is perceived as the sense of taste is actually derived from smell. True ageusia is relatively rare compared to hypogeusia (a partial loss of taste) and dysgeusia (a distortion or alteration of taste). Tissue damage to the nerves that support the tongue can cause ageusia, especially damage to the lingual nerve and the glossopharyngeal nerve. The lingual nerve passes taste for the front two-thirds of the tongue and the glossopharyngeal nerve passes taste for the back third of the tongue. The lingual nerve can also be damaged during otologic surgery, causing a feeling of metal taste. Taste loss can vary from true ageusia, a complete loss of taste, to hypogeusia, a partial loss of taste, to dysgeusia, a distortion or alteration of taste. The primary cause of ageusia involves damage to the lingual nerve, which receives the stimuli from taste buds for the front two-thirds of the tongue, or the glossopharyngeal nerve, which acts similarly for the back third. Damage may be due to neurological disorders, such as Bell‚Äôs palsy or multiple sclerosis, as well as infectious diseases such as meningoencephalopathy. Other causes include a vitamin B deficiency, as well as taste bud death due to acidic/spicy foods, radiation, and/or tobacco use.

Early life and education Aldrich received his BFA degree from the Ohio State University in 1998. Career and work He moved to New York City in 2000 and spent several years making text-based drawings and penning Calvinoesque poems and essays, which he sometimes published pseudonymously in ads in Zing magazine. Experiments in electronic music soon followed with band Hurray, a quartet that included Peter Mandradjieff, Zak Prekop, and Josh Brand. Aldrich often works on gessoed panels with a mixture of oil paint, mineral spirits, and wax, which he lays on with a brush or palette knife. The combination of the resistant ground and viscid alloy registers his short hesitant strokes with tender congealed precision. His breezier canvases have been compared to Philip Guston's transitional pictures from the mid-1960s (and also sometimes evoke Per Kirkeby or Joan Mitchell). Richard Aldrich, Untitled, 2008, Oil and wax on panel, 19‚Öù x 13¬Ω inchesAlthough mostly abstract and casual, Aldrich's paintings also betray a distinctly literary sensibility, even as he targets what he has called the essential \\"unwordliness of experience.\\" Snippets of text and random words-UFO, the numeral 4-appear as decals or pencil scrawls, while lines incised with the back of a brush suggest writing once removed. Taciturn pictures carry evocative and ungainly verbal appendages in the form of elliptical press releases or titles like Large Obsessed with Hector Guimard, 2008, a nod to the architect of Paris's Art Nouveau metro stations, or If I Paint Crowned I've Had It, Got Me, 2008, a telling paraphrase of C√©zanne explaining he would be ruined if he tried to paint the \\"crowned\\" effect of a still life rather than the thing itself. Aldrich‚Äôs work proceeds from the assumption that aesthetic experience is no longer localized in any self-sufficient surface or material. His inquisitive approach to his paintings extends both to the way they come to occupy a space and to the space from which they come. His work does not depict the life of the studio but embodies it directly, reconstituting the books, postcards, records, and junk he happens to have lying around. A failed attempt at a jury- rigged curtain or a page of poetry might wind up on a canvas, while a collaged element might get ripped off, leaving behind a frayed paper scar. Aldrich is unconcerned with creating a dominant or domineering pictorial style. In Aldrich's hands, all the cutting, stretching, and collaging are not so much operations or strategies or ends unto themselves. Rather, they are yet more tools in the resourceful painter's arsenal, just like the different kinds of paint he uses, and the instruments with which he applies them, and the gunk he mixes in. Aldrich's paintings wear their disfigurement easily, without a feeling of brainy exposition or true bodily harm. Their sense of humble panache lies precisely in the way aggressive acts can cohabit with milder ones while still retaining a lively renegade charge. Indeed, Aldrich's most radical proposition may be his commitment to nudging painting forward via a combination of inquisitive tinkering and truculent gestures that would otherwise have left it undone. This does not make for an ahistorical, reactionary enterprise or for an unsophisticated one. If anything, his paintings abrade the false dichotomy between innocence and understanding. The possibilities for painting lie all around us, he suggests; the trick is knowing how to frame the choice.

The King's lawyer =The law brought against the Douglas family= Adam Otterburn was an important servant of the Scottish monarchy as a lawyer and a diplomat. In August 1524 Margaret Tudor sent him to England with the Earl of Cassilis and Scot of Balwearie to negotiate peace, and a possible marriage for James V with Princess Mary.Ken Emond, The Minority of James V (Edinburgh, 2019), p. 175.

When James V assumed the throne as an adult ruler and rejected the Douglases and their associates, Otterburn drew up charges of treason against them on 13 July 1529. On 8 November 1529 he was one of the Scottish commissioners who met English diplomats at Berwick-upon-Tweed. This meeting discussed the possible restoration of the Earl of Angus, an issue which Henry VIII could use as leverage to decide James's choice of future bride. A five- year truce was concluded and the Douglases were to go into English exile.Cameron, Jamie, James V (Tuckwell, 1998), 27, 60‚Äì64.

Redhall, his other estate, is within Edinburgh near Longstone. Around this time, Otterburn had a conversation with Thomas Wharton about gold-mining in Scotland at Crawford Moor. Otterburn said that James IV had mines but only found loose pieces of gold or gold ore rather than a vein, and spent more on the work than he recovered.

Hertford had been instructed not to negotiate, so Adam replied in defiance and refused to yield up the town. Hertford had not yet landed his guns so offered to wait till 7:00 pm.Expedition to Scotland, 1544, London (1544): Thomson, Thomas, ed., The history of Scotland, from the death of King James I. in the year M.CCCC.XXXVI to the year M.D.LXI by John Lesley, Bannatyne Club (1830) pp.180‚Äì1: Cody, ed., John Lesley's History of Scotland, vol.2 (1895), 278: Stevenson, Joseph, ed., The History of Mary Stewart by Claude Nau, Edinburgh (1883), 337‚Äì8: Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol.19 part 2, (1903), no.472, Hertford, Lisle & Sadler to Henry VIII: Nau says 'two Baillies,' these versions differ in slight details. During an interlude in the war with England, Otterburn was concerned to recover money owing to him. His holding of lands at Auldhame, like those of his neighbours Oliver Sinclair, the favourite of James V, and John, 5th Lord Borthwick, required duties to be paid to Cardinal Beaton. Adam wrote to the Cardinal hoping for money owed to him by Sinclair, and he noted that Borthwick and other landowners south of the River Forth sold their wool in England.Cameron, Annie I., ed., The Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, SHS (1927), 162. Adam was now distrusted by Regent Arran and briefly imprisoned with a threat of further lawsuits. Friends like Elizabeth Gordon, wife of John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl wrote to Mary of Guise on his behalf. They were closely allied; Adam's son John had married the Countess' sister in law, Janet Stewart.Cameron, Annie I., ed., The Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS: Edinburgh1927), pp. 157‚Äì158. In October 1546, Adam set out with David Panter and a servant of d'Oysel, the French ambassador in Scotland to meet with Henry VIII at Oatlands. They brought the Scottish ratification of the Treaty of Ardres or Camp. Before they left Adam complained he had not enough money and horses to get to Musselburgh (a town close to Edinburgh). While they were waiting to see Henry the other diplomats were delighted to see them arguing.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell, 2000), p. 220. In March 1547, three of his servants were allowed to return to Scotland.Acts of the Privy Council, vol. 2 (HMSO, 1890), p. 445. =Last minute negotiations in London before the Battle of Pinkie= Otterburn was still negotiating for peace in London before the Battle of Pinkie. On Sunday 7 August 1547 he went to Hampton Court and met Edward VI of England. There he was dismissed as a diplomat by the council as it was now a time of hostility. He was given ¬£75 as a gift for his departure.Acts of the Privy Council, vol. 2 (HMSO, 1890), p. 112, 'Adrian Otorborn' Otterburn saw, > \\"afoir my eis verray gret preparatioun of weir, and actualie the gret hors, > the harnes, the hagbutaris, and all gorgious reparrale set forwart towart > our realme.\\" > > Before my eyes very great preparation of war, and actually the great horse, > the armour, the firearms, and all the gorgeous equipment set forward towards > our realm.

On Monday he returned to Hampton Court and had further discussions with the Protector Somerset. He wrote to Regent Arran urging him take his warnings of the English invasion seriously, and begged him to allow George Douglas of Pittendreich to negotiate with Somerset, writing; \\"I dreid ye will nocht gif credence quhill ye se thame cum in at the dur,\\" (I dread you will not believe till you see them come in the door).Cameron, Annie I., ed., Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS, Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 192‚Äì4, or possibly \\"give credence\\" meaning to accredit Pittendreich as Scotland's ambassador.

However, his army was defeated by the English at the battle of Pinkie on 10 September 1547. Sore hurt on the head In his letters in 1546 and 1547 Otterburn mentions that he was \\"aged and sickly\\", but Otterburn died after an assault in Edinburgh by a servant of Regent Arran on 3 July 1548,Cameron, Annie, (1927), 157 note, 171. \\"sore hurt on the head and his servant slain at his heels.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 137.

Some of the petroleum that was generated from sediments in the pre-salt layer, has not migrated upward (see salt dome) to the post-salt layers above. This is especially common off the coast of Africa and Brazil. The total oil reserves are thought to be a significant fraction of the world's reserves. According to Petrobras, the oil and natural gas lie below an approximately thick layer of salt, itself below in places more than of post-salt sediments, in water depths between in the South Atlantic. Drilling through the rock and salt to extract the pre-salt oil and gas is very expensive.  Brazil  Schematic diagram showing pre-salt layers and halokinesis; the movement of salt over geologic time The oil reserves found in the pre-salt layer of the Brazilian coast are within the maritime area considered exclusive economic zone of Brazil. They are reserves with oil considered of medium to high quality, according to the API scale. The set of pre-salt oil fields extends along the coast from the state of Esp√≠rito Santo in the north, as far as Santa Catarina in the south, where the ocean depths range from 1,000 to 2,000 meters, and is found between 4,000 and 6,000 meters deep in the subsoil, thus reaching up to 8,000 meters below sea level, including a salt layer ranging from 200 to 2,000 meters thick. \\"Entenda o que √© a camada pr√©-sal\\", Folha Online, 31/08/2008\\"A produ√ß√£o no pr√©-sal\\". Ag√™ncia Brasil, 31/08/2009 The current findings from Petrobras and other companies in the province of the pre-salt, located in the Brazilian continental shelf, can mean reserves of over 50 billion barrels of oil, a volume four times greater than the current national reserves, roughly 14 billion barrels. In this province, there may be large oil and natural gas reserves located under salt layers that extend for 800 kilometers along the Brazilian coast ‚Äì from the state of Santa Catarina coast to the coast of Esp√≠rito Santo ‚Äì up to 200 km wide. Some estimates give the total area of the pre-salt as 122,000 km2. Of this total, concessions have already been granted for 41,000 km2 and 71,000 km2 have not yet been tendered. Pre-salt oil is of good quality, although it is found in reserves that are in deep-sea areas and under thick layers of salt, requiring large-scale investment to extract it. Since 2006, Petrobras has drilled 11 oil wells in the Santos Basin, near Rio de Janeiro state. All these oil wells have been successful. At the prospects of Tupi and Iara alone, which are located in the BM-S-11 block, Petrobras already estimates that there are 8 to 12 billion barrels of recoverable oil. This block alone can almost double the current Brazilian oil reserves.  Angola  The first pre-salt discoveries in Angola were the Denden-1 well in block 9 in 1983, operated by Cities Services at the time, and the Baleia-1A well on block 20 in 1996, operated by Mobil (now ExxonMobil). Both blocks are now operated by the U.S.‚Äîbased Cobalt International Energy. The Danish company Maersk Oil made the first recent pre-salt discovery in the Kwanza Basin in late 2011 with the Azul well on block 23. Maersk continues to study the results of the well and plans to appraise it. Cobalt has had the most success with presalt exploration in Angola, making multiple presalt well discoveries in blocks 20 and 21 (Cameia, Mavinga, Lontra, Bicuar, and Orca). In January 2011, Angola announced that it awarded 11 pre-salt offshore blocks in the Kwanza basin, following a closed licensing round in which a few selected IOCs were invited. IOCs that were awarded blocks include Petrobras, Maersk Oil, Cobalt, BP, Repsol, Total, Eni, ConocoPhillips, and Statoil. Some of those companies have slowed their investments in Angola's pre-salt, and some wells have been closed and abandoned. The combination of disappointing results and geological complexity, compounded by the low-oil-price environment, has resulted in reduced investment in Angola's pre-salt areas.

He had been a leading figure in the Melkite Church and metropolitan bishop of Aleppo. He died a few months after his election as Patriarch, probably poisoned because his will to proceed with a union with the Catholic Church. Metropolitan of Aleppo Abdel-Karim Karmah was born in 1572 in Hama, Syria, son of a priest. In his twenties he went to Jerusalem where he entered in the monastery of Saint Michel, a cloister associated with Mar Saba Monastery. After two years of prayer, he was asked by his bishop Simeon to return to Hama where he was ordained deacon and later priest. A few years later he moved for service to Aleppo where he got appraisal as preacher. On 12 February 1612 Karmah was consecrated metropolitan bishop of Aleppo by Patriarch Athanasius II Dabbas, and he took the name of the saint of that day, ‚Äò‚ÄôMeletios‚Äô‚Äô. One of his aims as metropolitan was to increase the literacy and the education of his flock and his presbyter, which needed liturgical and religious books in Arabic. Thus Karmah in 1612 published in Arabic the Typicon of Mar Saba, a Liturgicon and a Sticherarion, but to go on with further publications he needed money. For this purpose he asked a grant to Rome, and he relied on the Franciscans missionaries for financial support and for teaching. He succeeded also to persuade the Vatican to start preparing an Arabic translation of the whole Bible, something quite difficult to obtain in the years after the Council of Trent, but the translation took time and only the Gospels were published. While Karmah was metropolitan of Aleppo, he was attacked many times. The first time was in 1614 and he had to go to Constantinople to defend himself in front of Patriarch Timothy II of Constantinople, who decided to confirm him in his position. Some years later he was strongly attached by the claiming-patriarch Cyril IV Dabbas because he supported the other claiming-patriarch, Ignatius III Atiyah. In 1624 Cyril Dabbas moved to Aleppo but Karmah always refused to concelebrate with him. Karmah went on refusing to recognize Cyrill even at the celebration of Easter 1625. Thus Cyrill Dabbas accused him in front of the Ottoman authorities who arrested and processed him. Karmah was beaten and fined a large amount of money, which was offered by the Christians of Aleppo to have him released. In 1627 he had again to return to Constantinople to defend himself, also this time successfully. In 1628 he took part to the Synod of Ras-Baalbek where, along with all the other Melkite bishops, deposed Cyrill declaring Ignatius III to be the sole patriarch. Patriarch A few months after the bloody death of Patriarch Ignatius III Atiyah, he was elected as new Patriarch by the Christians of Damascus and consecrated on 1 May 1634, taking the name of Euthimios III. Because of his friendly relations with the Western missionaries he had in the previous years, his first decision as Patriarch was to send a delegation to Rome to renew the union with the Catholic Church set forth in the Council of Florence. He also planned to open schools with Jesuits teachers. Because of these openings towards the Catholic Church, he clashed with the pro-Orthodox and pro-Turkish parties into the Melkite Church. In the meantime his delegation arrived to Rome and obtained a positive response from Propaganda Fide, he died in Damascus on 1 January 1635, probably poisoned because his will to proceed with a union with the Catholic Church.

Became a consultant to the Moscow International Film Festival. In early 1998, Van Ronkel's life completely changed when he was introduced to a Russian producer in Los Angeles who asked if he could help sell his Russian produced, English-language film in the US and Europe called Sacred Cargo. After much success selling the film, the Russian producer brought Van Ronkel an invitation from the Mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, asking if he could convince a Hollywood studio to come to Russia and with the Moscow government as a partner, build multiplex cinemas throughout the country. Within a month Van Ronkel met with senior executives at Warner Bros Studio, Jim Miller and Millard Ochs and arranged his first trip to Russia with Millard, Sasha Shapiro and Chris Adelman, to meet the Russian government. Following their second trip to Moscow in 1998, Van Ronkel received a call from the General Director of the Moscow International Film Festival, Renat Davletyarov, asking if he could bring a Hollywood star to their film festival in early 1999. Having just produced his first film and knowing very few people in the entertainment industry, one of the few well known actor friends Van Ronkel had was Martin Landau, who agreed to attend the film festival with Van Ronkel. 1999\\\\. After successfully bringing Landau to the festival and Warner Bros to meet the Russian government, Van Ronkel was hired by the Moscow International Film Festival as its U.S. consultant. 2000\\\\. At a time when Americans were wary of traveling to Russia, after months of networking and many phone calls to his VIP friends, Van Ronkel was able to bring to the Moscow International Film Festival the president of Paramount Pictures, Sherry Lansing, director William Friedkin, and producers Jay Firestone and Peter Hoffman. He also persuaded E-TV to attend and cover the festival. 2001\\\\. He was re-hired as consultant to the Moscow International Film Festival, and using his strong network of contacts, convinced actors Jack Nicholson, Sean Penn, Lara Flynn Boyle, Woody Harrelson, Peta Wilson and Sammo Hung to attend. The same month, new friend Jim Carrey and his business manager John Rigney came to Moscow and spent five days there with Van Ronkel. After another successful trip and so many people speaking about Van Ronkel bringing so many Hollywood stars to Russia, many journalists began to interview and write about him. Shortly after the festival, Van Ronkel was contacted by a Russian/American company called Matador Media and asked if he could bring two well-known celebrities to Moscow to help promote the opening of its new offices in Los Angeles. Within 30 days, Van Ronkel arranged for John Malkovich and Dolph Lundgren to fly to Moscow with him to promote Matador Media. With this, Doors to Hollywood was founded. 2002\\\\. Sixty days later, Van Ronkel was hired to help throw a seven-day, $7,000,000 birthday party in Jamaica, for a Russian banker turning 30. They booked the entire Grand Lido Braco Resort and during the week brought the bands Kiss, Nazareth, The Scorpions, and Sugar Ray to perform for the 150 guests. A short time later, Van Ronkel was hired by the Kinotavr Film Festival in Sochi, Russia to bring two actors and took Eric Roberts and Dolph Lundgren to attend the opening and closing of the festival. Just after that, Van Ronkel was hired to help throw a Russian banker's 34th birthday party in Cannes, France, and had a $3,000,000 budget for the three day party. The guests he brought were Val Kilmer, James Caan, Billy Zane, Rutger Hauer, Faye Dunaway, Chris Kirkpatrick, Ralf Moeller, Ah-Ha and the Gypsy Kings.

At the 2006 census, its population was 26, in 8 families. Shadegan is located alongside a valley behind one of the Zagros Mountains locally called the Khoomi Mountains. This village is about 40 km from the nearest city Gachsaran (population: 70,422, 2nd largest city in the province) and its rich oilfields of Be Be Hakemeh and Gureh. Shadegan village is a few hundred kilometres distance from the town of Shadegan, Khuzestan province. The Shadegani people speak the Luri language which is one of the western Iranian languages. Within Iran, the Kurds, Lurs of Luristan (northern Luristan), Lurs of Bakhtiari and Lurs of Kohgiluye and Boyer-Ahmad are living on-and-around these mountains from west to east for generations. The local name for Shadegan was Goru but for unknown reasons it has been recorded under the name of Shadegan in the Governmental registries. Shadegan's natural environment includes a river called Roo Bashti (Persian: ÿ±ŸàÿØ ÿ®ÿßÿ¥ÿ™€å). Near to Shadegan are the tombs of the Do Pir-e-Jofteh (Persian: ÿØŸà Ÿæ€åÿ± ÿ¨ŸÅÿ™Ÿá, meaning \\"The Pair of Pirs (Old Men)\\" or \\"The Two Old Men\\"). In 1960, the estimated population of the village was 100 people. As of 2010, the population of the village is not estimated to be more than 10 full-time residents. Currently all estimated 10 residents of Shadegan have access to a landline telephone which is supervised and looked after one of the village elders, Mr Nurullah Hashemi, Son of marhoom Ka Zameni. However mobile and radio reception are poor and TV and Internet reception are still non-existent and they hope the authorities provide them with such basic technology. Many former residents of Shadegan, who now live in cities across Iran, gather once a year on the thirteenth day after the Persian New year, Nowruz, in the village during the celebration of Sizdah Bedar. History Shadegan was one of the villages in that region which was run by the local ruler, the Khan (Persian: ÿÆÿßŸÜ, meaning warlord, lord, landlord ), who was dictating his will under the strict rules of Feudalism, until the estimated twenty peasant families, like other peasants in many parts of Iran, were liberated under the slogan of the White Revolution, which were a series of socio-economic policies implemented by the Shah at the behest of the administration of U.S. President John F. KennedyNikkie. Keddie, Roots of Revolution: an Interpretive History of Modern Iran (London: Yale University Press, 1981). in 1963. In anticipation for these land reforms, in 1958, some children from Shadegan, along with other villages, were for the first time in their history able to attend school. In 1970 Shadegan was moved towards the road from Basht to Cheram when roads were first constructed in the area. Since change of government in 1979 most of the inhabitants of Shadegan have left the village, going to the city, mostly to nearby Gachsaran and Shiraz with some moving to the capital (Tehran).

He later made millions of dollars in the oil industry and became a trustee and significant benefactor to the university and its athletic department. His hobbies included philanthropy, scientific research and agriculture. His estate in Gibsonia, Pennsylvania was devoted to a large extent to fruit trees. Early life Trees was born near Delmont, Pennsylvania in Westmoreland County, where his grandfather, Thomas Trees, had established a flour mill and a sawmill after immigrating from England. His parents, Isaac and Lucy Johnston Trees, later operated the mills and, as a youth, Joe worked in them. College football Trees first attended Indiana Normal School (now Indiana University of Pennsylvania). While playing in practice games against the Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP), now named the University of Pittsburgh, Trees impressed Bert Smyers, the founder and captain of the WUP football team. In order to facilitate Trees to switch schools and play football for WUP, Smyers helped to arrange for various classes at the university to pay for Trees' room, board, and tuition. Thus in 1891, Trees became Pitt's first subsidized athlete as a star 210 pound tackle on Pitt's football team. Trees graduated from the university with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1895. Trees, also participated in the universities track and field team, and in 1894, additionally served as an Assistant Librarian at the university. Possible professional football career In 1892 and 1893, Trees played football on the side for the then-amateur Allegheny Athletic Association. The club in 1893 was suspected heavily of secretly paying its players, making them professionals. Documents discovered a half-century later showed that on November 21, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger, an all-American guard from Yale, was paid $500 (US dollars) to play for Allegheny against the rival Pittsburgh Athletic Club. It is unknown if Trees was paid by Allegheny to play football with the club. In 1894, Trees jumped to the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. That year, during a game against Allegheny, quarterback A. S. Valentine was thrown out of the game after coming to the aid of James Van Cleve during a fight against Trees. After several appeals, Valentine left the field reportedly \\"crying like a baby\\" by the local media. During a second game that season, Trees was thrown out of the game for punching Allegheny's Sport Donnelly. Trees never liked Donnelly; during games when the two lined up against each other, Donnelly would pull Trees' long-flowing hair. Joe would usually defend himself with a strenuous poke at Donnelly, and often ended up on the sideline as in this game. Family Trees married Claudine Willison on November 22, 1894. The couple had two sons, both of whom were killed: Joseph Graham Trees as an aviator during World War I and the other, Merle, died at age 10 in a traffic accident in Pittsburgh. After the death of his wife, Joe married, in 1929, his secretary, the former Edith Lehm. The couple had a son, Joe Benedum Trees. Oil industry During his summer vacations from college Joe worked for Standard Oil. He and his partner Mike Benedum, decided to buy a lease in Pleasants County, West Virginia, and this was the start of their career together. Their first well came in 1896 and six more soon gushed from the same lease. Benedum and Trees developed a dozen other rich pools in West Virginia with varying success up to 1900. Superstition played a big part in their decisions of where to drill. In one instance, a blind farmer once told them he had envisioned oil gushing out of a hill on his farm and shooting up over a tree. Trees and Benedum then decided to drill on that spot. As a result, a well gushed just as the blind man had dreamed. Another time the two men heard of a natural rock-formation arrow which legend said pointed to treasure. Benedum sighted along the arrow while Trees moved back and forth in a straight line from it. They drilled the chosen spot and again struck oil. Over the years, the men developed oil fields for Marie of Romania in Ploie»ôti. Those fields were taken over by Nazi Germany during World War II and became a target of the war's oil campaign, such as Operation Tidal Wave. Ploie≈üti was captured by Soviet troops in August 1944. Trees and Benedum also founded wells in Illinois, West Texas, Florida (with Clem S. Clarke of Shreveport, Louisiana), Mexico, Colombia, and throughout South America. Their West Texas discoveries were among the most significant in his career. Untouched and despised by other oil men, this area has since poured out a billion barrels, with reserves estimated at another billion. On May 19, 1943 while talking to his partner Mike Benedum in their company headquarters at the Benedum-Trees Building, Trees suddenly slumped forward in his chair and died of a heart attack. Legacy Trees remained closely tied to his alma mater throughout his life. He served on and, for a time, became president of University of Pittsburgh's Board of Trustees. An important benefactor for the University of Pittsburgh and its athletic department, in 1912 he donated $100,000 for the construction of the original Trees Gymnasium and Trees Stadium/Field that sat near the site of the present day Veterans Administration Hospital in Oakland. Today, a short distance from those now demolished original structures, two university facilities bear his name: Trees Field and Trees Hall, a multipurpose recreation and varsity athletics facility that opened in 1962. Trees also donated funds to the Pitt Band, $75,000 to the construction of Eberly Hall, and purchased $200,000 worth of bonds to help pay for the construction of Pitt Stadium. Until his death, his generosity to the university earned him the reputation as \\"a true Pitt man\\" and \\"Call on Joe\\" became a byword when the university was in need.

The battle was part of the War of the Austrian Succession and was conducted in cooperation with the Prussians under Frederick the Great who had defeated the Austrians a week previously at the battle of Chotusitz. Broglie won a small, but politically important, victory which combined with Frederick's success at Chotusitz disposed Maria Theresa to cede Silesia in the peace of Breslau on June 11, 1742. Preliminary Maneuvers Croatian pandurs from 1742. Lobkowitz marched on an advanced French post at Hlubok√° nad Vltavou (in German Frauenberg) and investing it on May 18 began a bombardment with twelve cannon and some mortars. Broglie, joined by Belle-Isle on May 19, moved to relieve the post. The battle The engagement began at about four in the afternoon. The Austrians were drawn up in line of battle with their left on the village of Sahay which they occupied with 300 Pandur irregular light infantry. Their left was covered by some swampy ground with woods on a height to their right and rear. The French, with superior numbers, pressed the attack. They attempted to flank the marsh with some cavalry and attacked Sahay with an advanced guard of grenadiers, driving the Pandours from the village which they set on fire to cover their retreat. The Austrians fell back to the woods in disorder but recovered and counter-attacked. A cavalry charge by three regiments of Austrian cuirassiers was launched from some rising ground in front of the woods against the French Carabiniers who were supported by two dragoon regiments. The French cavalry flanked the Austrian cavalry and the Austrians were repulsed. The infantry on both sides attacked each other but the French pushed the Austrians back to the woods. The French regiment Navarre making three bayonet charges. The Austrian cavalry rallied behind the infantry and charged again but were again forced back with the Hohenzollern cuirassiers distinguishing themselves but suffering severely. The battle ended around eight in the evening with the Austrians retreating during the night losing some 500 killed and six cannon. The French losses were about 250.

It is a non- sectarian, non-profit, co-educational institution governed by a Board of Directors. CPS provides an integrated PPK-12 curriculum in English with a strong program in Spanish. It is located on two campuses: Parkville Campus in Guaynabo, PR (grades PPK-6), and Commonwealth Campus in Hato Rey, San Juan, PR (grades 7-12).  History  Commonwealth-Parkville School (formerly known as Caribbean Preparatory School) is a private, college preparatory day school founded in 1952 and incorporated in Puerto Rico. It is a non-sectarian, non- profit, co-educational institution governed by a Board of Directors. CPS provides an integrated PPK-12 curriculum in English with a program in Spanish. CPS‚Äô history dates back to 1951 when several families relocated to Puerto Rico to work with the Economic Development Administration (Fomento). The main obstacle these parents faced was the lack of English language schools for their children. They began looking for physical facilities and studying the requirements to create an English school that would fulfill their need for education. They rented a community center located in the Roosevelt neighborhood in Hato Rey, where Commonwealth Middle and High School are located today. The school began with 92 students, eight teachers, and eight classrooms. Every year a new grade was added until 1961, when Commonwealth School graduated its first twelfth grade class of 10 students. Parallel to Commonwealth High School‚Äôs founding is the history of the San Juan School by the Sea. These two schools instituted a new educational system in the history of education in Puerto Rico. Seven parents started the San Juan by the Sea Elementary School. It consisted of a kindergarten through sixth grade and was located in a rented apartment in Condado. Later, the school moved to a property in Punta Las Mar√≠as. In 1964, Commonwealth was empty and grades kindergarten through twelfth needed more classrooms to accommodate all students. Parkville School in Guaynabo was then built to serve as the elementary campus. The three schools: Commonwealth, San Juan by the Sea, and Parkville, constituted the Caribbean Consolidated Schools system, which was incorporated in 1964. In 1979, the Board of Directors voted to sell San Juan by the Sea and improve facilities at Parkville and Commonwealth Campuses. In 2014, a teacher from Commonwealth-Parkville won \\"most influential teacher\\" and was honored by the US Department of Education.  Academics  The mission of Commonwealth‚ÄìParkville School is \\"to provide students and engaging academic program with a caring, collaborative environment, that develops leadership skills, creativity and character.\\" Students take required academic courses, that includes, among others, art, dance, music, and computer. In addition, they prepare well for the Stanford Achievement Tests, the Scholastic Assessments Tests given in English, and the College Board exams given in Spanish. Advanced Placement (AP) courses are an important component of the educational offerings. CPS is a member of the Network of Complementary Schools, which offers the students the opportunity of traveling as exchange students to one of twenty-eight stateside private and public schools. CPS also coordinates an annual internship program for seniors to spend several days with a professional within the occupational area of their choice. In 2019, students from CPS were among others participating in a forum on whether there is participatory democracy in Puerto Rico.  Horizons Program  CPS Horizons Program offers to students with mild learning differences special assistance to develop strategies to become successful with grade level material for each subject taken in the Horizons setting. To that end, CPS provides the special adaptations and accommodations for each student. Horizons teachers are the key to encourage students to make possible their independent work.

The picture was taken by Jimmy Sime on 9 July 1937 outside the Grace Gates at Lord's Cricket Ground during the Eton v Harrow cricket match. It has been reproduced frequently as an illustration of the British class system, although the name \\"Toffs and Toughs\\" may be no older than 2004. The day of the picture The names of the five boys were published in a 1998 article by Geoffrey Levy in the Daily Mail. The Harrovians were Peter Wagner and Thomas Norwood Armitage \\"Tim\\" Dyson, who had arranged to be at Grace Gates at 2 pm, where Wagner's father would pick them up and drive them to Russ Hill, the Wagners‚Äô country home in Surrey, for the weekend. The other three boys were George Salmon, Jack Catlin, and George Young, 13-year- old pupils at the local Church of England school. They had visited the dentist that morning and decided to skip school to earn money at Lord's by carrying luggage and returning hired cushions for the deposit. The photographer, Jimmy Sime, worked for the Central Press Agency; Sime took several shots of the five boys outside Grace Gates. Ian Jack speculates that Sime solicited the cooperation of the three \\"toughs\\", but not that of the two \\"toffs\\". Use of the photograph The picture first appeared next day, 10 July 1937, on the front page of the News Chronicle, a left-wing newspaper, under the heading \\"Every picture tells a story\\". A different photograph from the same reel was printed in a photo-essay in Life on 2 August 1937; Life erroneously described Wagner and Dyson as \\"Young Etonians\\", and described the other three as \\"village boys\\". Ian Jack speculates that Life used an inferior shot because the original had been sold by the Central Press Agency exclusively to the News Chronicle. The News Chronicle photograph reappeared in 1941 in Picture Post, illustrating an article by A. D. Lindsay arguing for reform of Britain's education system. Bert Hardy, who joined the Picture Post in 1941, has often been misidentified as the photographer who took the picture. It has been reused often in subsequent decades; Levy called it \\"the defining image of class division\\". In 1979 it was a plate in Fran√ßois B√©darida's Social history of England, captioned \\"The Two Nations\\". It was the illustration on the covers of books about the British class system published in the 1990s, and in newspaper articles in the 2000s. Paul Barker of the Institute for Community Studies described the picture in 2000 as an \\"easy caricature\\" symbolising an obsolete social divide. In 2004, the title \\"Toffs and Toughs\\" was used in the Getty Images online catalogue, and for a jigsaw puzzle of the photograph. Ian Jack has criticised this title since Salmon, Catlin, and Young were not especially poor or disreputable, merely part of the respectable working-class majority of the time. The boys in later life Peter Wagner studied natural sciences at Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1943, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Corps of Signals. However, he suffered from pericarditis and never saw active service during the Second World War. After being discharged from the army in 1945, he entered the family stockbroking firm, married, and had three daughters; he became mentally unstable in the 1970s and died in Hellingly Hospital in 1984. The W.G. Grace Gates, the location of the photograph, in 2012: in the original photograph, the children were standing by the bollard to the left of the left pair of gates Tim Dyson died of diphtheria 13 months after the photograph was taken, in August 1938. This was shortly after travelling to join his parents in Trimulgherry, British India, where his father, Lt.-Col. George St. John Armitage Dyson, was serving as an army officer. George Dyson died in 1942 in a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Korea. During the Second World War, George Salmon served as an anti- aircraft gunner on board HMS Duckworth. After the war, he worked for Rightons Limited, a metal supplier. He was married when interviewed by the Daily Mail in 1998 and was still living in Marylebone when he died in 2000. Jack Catlin's family moved to Rickmansworth soon after 1937; in 2010 he was widowed, remarried and living in Weymouth. Jack Catlin died in January 2011 at the age of 85, survived by his wife Sheila, his son, daughter, and grandchildren.http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/8796233.jack-catlin/ George Young was also married when interviewed for the Daily Mail.

Castro assumed that the American Monroe Doctrine would see Washington intervene to prevent European military intervention. However, at the time, US president Theodore Roosevelt and his Department of State saw the doctrine as applying only to European seizure of territory, rather than intervention per se. With prior promises that no such seizure would occur, the US was officially neutral and allowed the action to go ahead without objection. The blockade saw Venezuela's small navy quickly disabled, but Castro refused to give in, and instead agreed in principle to submit some of the claims to international arbitration, which he had previously rejected. Germany initially objected to this, arguing that some claims should be accepted by Venezuela without arbitration. President Roosevelt forced the Germans to back down by sending his own larger fleet under Admiral George Dewey and threatening war if the Germans landed.Edmund Morris, A Matter Of Extreme Urgency': Theodore Roosevelt, Wilhelm II, and the Venezuela Crisis of 1902\\", Naval War College Review (2002) 55#2 pp 73‚Äì85 With Castro failing to back down, US pressure and increasingly negative British and American press reaction to the affair, the blockading nations agreed to a compromise, but maintained the blockade during negotiations over the details. This led to the signing of an agreement on 13 February 1903 which saw the blockade lifted, and Venezuela commit 30% of its customs duties to settling claims. When the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague subsequently awarded preferential treatment to the blockading powers against the claims of other nations, the US feared this would encourage future European intervention. The episode contributed to the development of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, asserting a right of the United States to intervene to stabilize the economic affairs of small states in the Caribbean and Central America if they were unable to pay their international debts, in order to preclude European intervention to do so.  Background  Cipriano Castro and his war cabinet in 1902 At the turn of the 20th century, German traders dominated Venezuela's import/export sector and informal banking system. Most of these, however, had little influence in Berlin; rather it was German industrialists and bankers, including those associated with building railroads, who had connections and influence.Mitchell, Nancy (1999), The danger of dreams: German and American imperialism in Latin America, University of North Carolina Press. p. 65 The revolutionary turmoil of the last decade of the 19th century in Venezuela saw these suffer, and send \\"a stream of complaints and entreaties for protection\\" to Berlin. Matters were particularly bad during the Venezuela civil war of 1892 which had brought Joaqu√≠n Crespo to power, which saw six months of anarchy with no effective government,Forbes (1978:320‚Äì21) but the civil war of 1898 again saw forced loans and the taking of houses and property.Forbes (1978:324) In 1893 the French, Spanish, Belgian and German envoys in Caracas had agreed that joint action was the best route for settling claims from the 1892 civil war, but in the event reparations in that case had been paid.Forbes (1978:323) While German investment in Venezuela was substantially less than in countries such as Argentina or Brazil, Krupp's Great Venezuela Railway Company, valued at 60m marks, was \\"individually one of the more valuable German South American ventures\\", and despite a renegotiation of the concession terms in 1896, payments were irregular after 1897 and stopped in August 1901.Forbes, Ian L. D. (1978), \\"The German Participation in the Allied Coercion of Venezuela 1902‚Äì1903\\", Australian Journal of Politics & History, Volume 24, Issue 3, pages 317‚Äì331. p. 320 In addition, Cipriano Castro, one of a succession of Venezuelan caudillos (military strongmen) to seize the Presidency, halted payment on foreign debts after seizing Caracas in October 1899.Greene, Jack and Tucker, Spencer C. (2009), \\"Venezuela Crisis, Second\\", in Tucker, Spencer (ed), The encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars: a political, social, and military history, Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, pp. 676‚Äì77 Britain had similar grievances, and was owed the bulk of the nearly $15m of debt Venezuela had obtained in 1881 and then defaulted on. In July 1901 Germany urged Venezuela in friendly terms to pursue international arbitrationHill, Howard C. (2008), Roosevelt and the Caribbean University of Chicago Press. p. 110 via the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. Between February and June 1902 the British representative in Venezuela sent Castro seventeen notes about the British government's concerns, and did not even receive a reply to any of them. Castro assumed that the United States Monroe Doctrine would see the US intervene to prevent European military intervention. Theodore Roosevelt (US President September 1901 ‚Äì March 1909), however, saw the Doctrine as applying to European seizure of territory, rather than intervention per se. As Vice-President, in July 1901, Roosevelt said that \\"if any South American country misbehaves toward any European country, let the European country spank it\\",Kaplan, Edward S. (1998), U.S. imperialism in Latin America: Bryan's challenges and contributions, 1900‚Äì1920, Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 16 and reiterated that view to Congress on 3 December 1901.  Preparations  Caricature of Cipriano Castro, by William Allen Rogers, published in the New York Herald, January, 1903 US President Theodore Roosevelt (1903) Venezuelan President Cipriano Castro (1903) It remains disputed to this day how the Anglo-German cooperation on Venezuela came about, with varying opinions as to the source of the initiative. In mid-1901, with the distraction of the Boxer Rebellion gone, Chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow decided to respond to the German concerns in Venezuela with some form of military intervention, and discussed with the German navy the feasibility of a blockade. Admiral Otto von Diederichs was keen, and recommended occupying Caracas if a blockade didn't succeed. However, disagreements within the German government over whether a blockade should be pacific (permitting neutral ships to pass) or martial (enabling them to be seized) caused delays, and in any case Kaiser Wilhelm II, German Emperor was unconvinced about the military action.Mitchell (1999:67) Nonetheless, in late 1901 a renewed demand for reparations was backed up by a show of naval strength, with and sent to the Venezuelan coast. In January 1902 the Kaiser declared a delay to any blockade due to the outbreak of another civil war in Venezuela (led by financier Manuel Antonio Matos) which raised the possibility of a more amenable government.Forbes (1978:325) Complicating matters were rumours \\"rampant in the United States and in England\\" that Germany wanted Margarita Island as a South American naval base; however a May 1900 visit by the German cruiser SMS Vineta had concluded it was unsuitable, and the German navy had become more conscious of how vulnerable such far-flung bases would be. In late 1901, the British Foreign Office became concerned that Britain would look bad if it failed to defend its citizens' interests while Germany took care of theirs, and began sounding out the Germans about a possible common action, initially receiving a negative response.Mitchell (1999:71‚Äì72) By early 1902, British and German financiers were working together to pressure their respective governments into action.Forbes (1978:327) The Italians, who had begun to suspect the existence of plans to enforce debts, sought to be involved too, but Berlin refused. Their participation was agreed to by the British \\"after Rome had shrewdly pointed out that it could repay the favor in Somalia\\".Mitchell, Nancy (1996), \\"The Height of the German Challenge: The Venezuela Blockade, 1902‚Äì3\\", Diplomatic History, Volume 20, Issue 2, p. 195 The Italians quickly sent the armoured cruiser Carlo Alberto and the protected cruisers Giovanni Bausan and Etna toward the Venezuela coast. Italian cruiser Carlo Alberto In June 1902, Castro seized a British ship, The Queen, on suspicion of aiding rebels, in another phase of the Venezuelan civil war. This, together with Castro's failure to engage with the British through diplomatic channels, tilted the balance in London in favor of action, with or without German cooperation. By July 1902, the German government was ready to return to the possibility of joint action, with Matos' insurrection having led to further abuses against German citizens and their property, including by government forces. In mid- August, Britain and Germany agreed in principle to go ahead with a blockade later in the year. In September, after the Haitian rebel ship Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot hijacked a German ship and seized weapons destined for the Haitian government, Germany sent the gunboat to Haiti.Mitchell (1999:77‚Äì78) Panther found the ship and declared that it would sink it, after which the rebel Admiral Hammerton Killick, after evacuating the crew, blew up his ship and himself with it, assisted by fire from Panther. There were concerns about how the United States would view the action in the context of the Monroe Doctrine, but despite US State Department legal advice describing the sinking as \\"illegal and excessive\\", the State Department endorsed the action, and the New York Times declared that \\"Germany was quite within her rights in doing a little housecleaning on her own account\\". Similarly, the British acquisition of the island of Patos, in the mouth of the Orinoco between Venezuela and the British dependency of Trinidad and Tobago, seemed to cause no concern in Washington, even though as a territorial claim it \\"skirted dangerously close to challenging the Monroe Doctrine\\".Mitchell (1999:78‚Äì79) On 11 November, at a visit of Kaiser Wilhelm's to his uncle King Edward VII at Sandringham House, an \\"iron-clad\\" agreement was signed, albeit leaving key details unresolved beyond the first step of seizing Venezuela's gunboats.Mitchell (1999:73‚Äì74) The agreement specified that matters with Venezuela should be resolved to the satisfaction of both countries, precluding the possibility of Venezuela making a deal with just one. The agreement was motivated not least by German fears that Britain might withdraw from action, and leave Germany exposed to US anger.Mitchell (1996:201‚Äì02) The British press reaction to the deal was highly negative, with the Daily Mail declaring that Britain was now \\"bound by a pledge to follow Germany in any wild enterprize which the German government may think it proper to undertake\\". In the course of 1902 the US received various indications from Britain, Germany and Italy of an intention to take action, with the US declaring that as long as no territorial acquisition were made, it would not oppose any action.Mitchell (1999:79‚Äì80) The British minister in Venezuela emphasised the need for secrecy about the plans, saying that he thought the US minister would leak warning to Castro, which would give Castro the opportunity to hide Venezuela's gunboats up the Orinoco River.Mitchell (1999:81) On 7 December 1902, both London and Berlin issued ultimatums to Venezuela, even though there was still disagreement about whether to impose a pacific blockade (as the Germans wanted) or a war blockade (as the British wanted).Mitchell (1999:84‚Äì86) Germany ultimately agreed to a war blockade, and after receiving no reply to their ultimatums, an unofficial naval blockade was imposed on 9 December with SMS Panther, SMS Falke, and SMS Vineta as major Kaiserliche Marine warships in Caribbean Sea. On 11 December, Italy offered its own ultimatum, which Venezuela also rejected. Venezuela maintained that its national laws were final, and said \\"the so-named foreign debt ought not to be and never had been a matter of discussion beyond the legal guaranties found in the law of Venezuela on the public debt\\".George Winfield Scott (1908), \\"Hague Convention Restricting the Use of Force to Recover on Contract Claims\\", The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 2, No. 1 (January 1908), p. 82  Blockade  Restaurador in Cura√ßao Lieutenant Commander Titus T√ºrk (1902) Restaurador, Olaf Rahardt The German naval contingent (numbering four, compared to British eight) followed the British lead in operational terms. On 11 December 1902, Gazelle boarded the old gunboat Restaurador in the port of Guanta. The gunboat was towed at anchor and put into service by the German Captain-Lieutenant Titus T√ºrk with crew members of Gazelle as SMS Restaurador.\\"Captain Lieutenant Titus T√ºrk\\". In Vaterst√§dtische Bl√§tter no. 3 (18 January 1903)75 days on board the cruiser \\"Restaurador\\", Titus T√ºrk, L√ºbeck 1905 The ship returned to Venezuela on 23 February 1903; after extensive repairs she was in much better condition than on capture. The British ships of the \\"Particular Service Squadron\\" under Commodore Robert A.J. Montgomerie included the sloop HMS Alert and the protected cruiser HMS Charybdis. An Italian naval contingent arrived in support of the blockade on 16 December. The blockaders captured four Venezuelan warships, with the Venezuelan navy providing little challenge. Virtually all its ships were captured within two days. The Germans, lacking the capacity to tow them to Cura√ßao, simply sank two Venezuelan ships that proved unseaworthy. On land, Castro arrested over 200 British and German residents of Caracas, prompting the allies to deploy soldiers to evacuate their citizens. The US Ambassador Herbert W. Bowen negotiated the release of all foreign nationals. SMS Vineta in 1902 On 13 December, after a British merchant vessel had been boarded and its crew briefly arrested, the British demanded an apology, and failing to receive it, launched a bombardment of Venezuelan forts at Puerto Cabello, assisted by the German . The same day, London and Berlin received from Washington a request forwarded from Castro to submit the dispute to arbitration, which neither Power relished, because of concerns over enforceability of any settlement.Mitchell (1999:87‚Äì88) In addition, Castro's offer initially covered only claims arising from the 1898 civil war, and made no mention of other claims. Germany believed that these claims should not be subject to arbitration, but London was more willing to agree, accepting arbitration in principle, and suggested a compromise. The threat of arbitration made London move to the next stage in order to negotiate from a position of strength, and 20 December was set for the beginning of the official blockade. As a result of a combination of communications issues and practical delays, the British notice of an official blockade was published on 20 December, but the German blockade of Puerto Cabello was only effected on 22 December, and on Maracaibo on 24 December. SMS Panther In the meantime, whilst London and Berlin considered Castro's offer, American public opinion increasingly turned against the action, and there were references to the nearby presence of Admiral George Dewey's US fleet, which was conducting long- planned exercises at Puerto Rico. Neither the British government nor the British press considered US intervention a serious possibility.Mitchell (1999:91‚Äì93) The US did, after the December ultimatums to Venezuela, send an envoy to survey Venezuela's defensive capabilities, and thereby confirmed its confidence that the US Navy could repel a German invasion.Seward W. Livermore (1946), \\"Theodore Roosevelt, the American Navy, and the Venezuelan Crisis of 1902‚Äì1903\\", The American Historical Review, Vol. 51, No. 3 (April 1946). pp. 459-460 The publication of a British government White Paper, revealing the nature of the \\"iron-clad\\" agreement, infuriated the British press, not least because the yoking of British and German interests was considered dangerous, and unnecessary for the mere collection of some foreign debts.Mitchell (1999:94‚Äì95) This was exemplified by Rudyard Kipling's polemic poem \\"The Rowers\\", published in The Times on 22 December as a response to the crisis; it included the words \\"a secret vow ye have made with an open foe ... a breed that have wronged us most ... to help them press for a debt!\\"Forbes (1978:331) Brian Stuart McBeth. \\"Gunboats, Corruption, and Claims: Foreign Intervention in Venezuela, 1899‚Äì1908\\".Challener, Richard (1973). Admirals, Generals, and American Foreign Policy, 1898‚Äì1914. Princeton University Press. Le Petit Journal depicting the blockade of La Guaira, 1902 Britain unofficially told the United States on 17 December that it would accept arbitration in principle, and that Germany would soon agree too, as it did on 19 December.Parsons, Edward B. (1971), \\"The German-American Crisis of 1902‚Äì1903\\", Historian, Volume 33, Issue 3, p. 437 Castro's failure to back down left limited options in the face of the Monroe Doctrine, which would make any seizure of Venezuelan territory, even temporarily, problematic. In addition, the negative reaction in the British and American press had raised the costs of the intervention particularly for Germany, whose relations with the US were more fragile than Britain's and who placed great value on the attitude of the British press. Germany had followed the British lead throughout the planning and execution of the operation, and as the British Ambassador in Berlin observed, \\"The idea of arbitration did not smile on them, but they accepted it at once because we had proposed it\\".Mitchell (1996:198‚Äì99) Fourteen years later (during a presidential campaign against the backdrop of World War I), Roosevelt claimed that Germany's acquiescence to arbitration came from his threat to attack the German ships in Venezuelan waters using Dewey's fleet. No documentary evidence has been found to confirm the claim. However, following the 18 December announcement that the US Navy fleet would be dispersed to West Indian ports for Christmas, which would take some of it to Trinidad, near the Venezuelan coast, the German embassy in Washington sought clarification from the US government. A cover of the \\"Le Petit Parisien\\" depicting the bombardment of Castle San Carlos The Secretary of State's remarks \\"were as close to a direct threat as it was possible to come in diplomatic parlance\\".Livermore (1946:464) Roosevelt also claimed that Germany had intended to seize a Venezuelan harbor and establish a permanent German military base; and certainly the German representative in Venezuela is known to have had such ambitions.Mitchell (1999:98) However, historical records suggest the German Kaiser had no interest in such a venture, and that motivations for the intervention lay with the insult to German prestige from Castro's actions. The Kaiser only gave the go ahead after being sure that Britain would play the lead role.Mitchell (1999:99) In January 1903, as the blockade continued during the negotiations, the German attempted to enter the lagoon of Maracaibo, a centre of German commercial activity.Lester H. Brune and Richard Dean Burns (2003), Chronological History of U.S. Foreign Relations: 1607‚Äì1932, Routledge. p. 308 On 17 January it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent Vineta, with heavier weapons, to set an example.Forbes (1978:328) On 21 January Vineta bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.Parsons (1971:447) The action had not been approved by the British commander, who had been told by Admiralty after the incident of 13 December not to engage in such action without consulting London; the message was not passed to the German commander, who had been told previously to follow the British commander's lead. The incident caused \\"considerable negative reaction in the United States against Germany\\"; the Germans said that the Venezuelans fired first, which the British concurred with but declared the bombardment \\"unfortunate and inopportune\\" nonetheless. The German Foreign Office said that Panthers attempted incursion into the lagoon of Maracaibo had been motivated by a desire to ensure the effective blockade of Maracaibo, by preventing Maracaibo from being supplied across the adjacent Colombian border. Subsequently, Roosevelt informed the German Ambassador that Admiral Dewey had orders to be ready to sail to Venezuela from Puerto Rico at an hour's notice.Bethell, Leslie (1984), The Cambridge history of Latin America, Cambridge University Press. p. 100  Outcome  Cipriano Castro with US Ambassador Herbert W. Bowen who signed the Washington Protocols as representative of Venezuela government, 1903 After agreeing to arbitration in Washington, Britain, Germany and Italy reached a settlement with Venezuela on 13 February, resulting in the Washington Protocols. Venezuela was represented by US Ambassador in Caracas Herbert W. Bowen.The Protocols' full text is available here: \\"Germany, Great Britain, and Italy v. Venezuela et al\\", The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 2, No. 4 (October 1908), pp. 902‚Äì911 Venezuela's debts had been very large relative to its income, with the government owing Bs120 million in principal and Bs46m in interest (and another Bs186m claimed in war-related damages), and having an annual income of Bs30m. The agreement reduced the outstanding claims by Bs150m, and created a payment plan taking into account the country's income. Venezuela agreed in principle to pledge 30% of its customs income at its two major ports (La Guaira and Puerto Cabello) to the creditor nations.Hamilton, P. (1999), The Permanent Court of Arbitration: international arbitration and dispute resolution : summaries of awards, settlement agreements and reports, Kluwer Law International. p 36 Each power initially received $27,500 (), with Germany promised another $340,000 () within three months.Mitchell (1999:101) The blockade was finally lifted on 19 February 1903.Reiling, Johannes (2003), Deutschland, safe for democracy?, Franz Steiner Verlag. p 44 The Washington agreements foresaw a series of mixed commissions to adjudicate claims against Venezuela (of respectively one Venezuelan representative, one representative from the claimant nation, and an umpireUnited Nations (2006), Mixed Claims Commission Great Britain-Venezuela, REPORTS OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRAL AWARDS. VOLUME IX pp. 349‚Äì533), and these \\"worked, with a few exceptions, satisfactorily; their awards were accepted; and the dispute was widely regarded as settled.\\" However, the blockading nations argued for preferential treatment for their claims, which Venezuela rejected, and on 7 May 1903 a total of ten powers with grievances against Venezuela, including the United States, signed protocols referring the issue to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.Dodwell, Henry (1929), The Cambridge history of the British Empire, Volume 4, p 322 The Court held on 22 February 1904 that the blockading powers were entitled to preferential treatment in the payment of their claims.Matthias Maass (2009), \\"Catalyst for the Roosevelt Corollary: Arbitrating the 1902‚Äì1903 Venezuela Crisis and Its Impact on the Development of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine\\", Diplomacy & Statecraft, Volume 20, Issue 3, pages 383‚Äì402 Washington disagreed with the decision in principle, and feared it would encourage future European intervention to gain such advantage. As a result, the crisis produced the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, described in Roosevelt's 1904 message to Congress. The Corollary asserted a right of the United States to intervene to \\"stabilize\\" the economic affairs of small states in the Caribbean and Central America if they were unable to pay their international debts, in order to preclude European intervention to do so. The Venezuela crisis, and in particular the arbitral award, were key in the development of the Corollary.

The film features Hepworth's baby daughter Elizabeth being bathed and dressed by her nurse, and was categorised by Hepworth as a \\"Domestic Scene\\". In the film Hepworth combines a series of shots to produce a narrative depicting the bathing process from beginning to end. He would later acknowledge the influence of the pioneering work of the Lumi√®re brothers on this and other similar films he produced in the 1900s. The print of Baby's Toilet survives, and Patrick Russell of the British Film Institute observes: \\"Long after Elizabeth Hepworth's own death, the affecting innocence of infancy remains a basic human theme. Baby's Toilet has lost none of its charm.\\" Synopsis The nurse bounces baby Elizabeth on her knee before placing her into her bath. The nurse sponges Elizabeth and drizzles water over her head and body, which Elizabeth evidently finds agreeable. She is then taken out of the bath, towel dried and powdered, again appearing to enjoy the procedure and peering inquisitively into the camera. Elizabeth is less impressed to be unceremoniously placed into an uncomfortable weighing scale, showing her displeasure by wriggling and grizzling. Finally Elizabeth is dressed and bounced again by the nurse. She begins to cry, but is pacified when the nurse produces her breast and the child is able to feed from the nurse who has a 2 month old baby at home whom she breasts feeds. This is the way that the nurse became attached to the baby Elizabeth. The nurse came back later to keep feeding Elizabeth.

Considered the strongest tornado ever recorded to have affected the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, the tornado devastated southern portions of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, along with surrounding suburbs and towns to the south and southwest of the city during the early evening of Monday, May 3, 1999. The tornado covered during its 85-minute existence, destroying thousands of homes, killing 36 people (plus an additional five indirectly), and leaving US$1 billion (1999 USD) in damage, ranking it as the fifth-costliest on record not accounting for inflation. The tornado first touched down at 6:23 p.m. Central Daylight Time (CDT) in Grady County, Oklahoma, roughly south-southwest of the town of Amber. It quickly intensified into a violent F4, and gradually reached F5 status after traveling , at which time it struck the town of Bridge Creek. It fluctuated in strength, ranging from F2 to F5 status before it crossed into Cleveland County where it reached F5 intensity for a third time shortly before entering the city of Moore. By 7:30 pm, the tornado crossed into Oklahoma County and battered southeastern Oklahoma City, Del City, and Midwest City before dissipating around 7:48 p.m. just outside Midwest City. A total of 8,132 homes, 1,041 apartments, 260 businesses, eleven public buildings, and seven churches were damaged or destroyed. Large-scale search and rescue operations immediately took place in the affected areas. A major disaster declaration was signed by President Bill Clinton the following day (May 4) allowing the state to receive federal aid. In the following months, disaster aid amounted to $67.8 million. Reconstruction projects in subsequent years led to a safer, tornado-ready community. However, on May 20, 2013, nearby areas adjacent to the 1999 storm's track along with some of the same areas in the path of the tornado were again devastated by another large and violent EF5 tornado, resulting in 24 fatalities and extreme damage in the South Oklahoma City/Moore area. Meteorological synopsis A map of the meteorological setup of the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak. The map displays surface and upper level atmospheric features associated with the outbreak. The Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado was part of a much larger outbreak which produced 71 tornadoes across five states throughout the Central Plains on May 3 alone, along with an additional 25 that touched down a day later in some of the areas affected by the previous day's activity (some of which were spawned by supercells that developed on the evening of May 3), stretching eastward to the Mississippi River Valley. The most prolific tornadic activity associated with the May 3 outbreak ‚Äì and the multi-day outbreak as a whole ‚Äì occurred in Oklahoma; 14 of the 66 tornadoes that occurred within the state that afternoon and evening produced damage consistent with the Fujita scale's \\"strong\\" (F2‚ÄìF3) and \\"violent\\" (F4‚ÄìF5) categories, which, in addition to the areas struck by the Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado family, affected towns such as Mulhall, Cimarron City, Dover, Choctaw and Stroud. On the morning of May 3, in its Day 1 Convective Outlook for the United States, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) ‚Äì based in Norman, approximately south of the tornado's eventual damage path ‚Äì issued a slight risk of severe thunderstorms from southern Nebraska to central Texas. SPC analysis had detected the presence of a dry line that stretched from western Kansas into western Texas that was approaching a warm, humid air- mass over the Central Plains; the condition ahead of the dry line and a connecting trough positioned over northeastern Colorado appeared to favor the development of thunderstorms later that day that would contain large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and isolated tornadoes. SPC forecasters initially underestimated the atmospheric conditions that would support tornadic development that afternoon and evening. Around 4:00 a.m. CDT that morning, Doppler radar and wind profile data indicated a jet stream along the California‚àíNevada border, though weather balloon soundings sent up the previous evening by National Weather Service (NWS) offices in the western U.S. and numerical computer model data failed to detect the fast-moving air current as it moved ashore from the Pacific Ocean. In addition, the dry line was diffused, with surface winds behind and ahead of the boundary moving into the region from a southerly direction. SPC meteorologists began to recalculate model data during the morning to account for the stronger wind profiles caused by the jet streak; the data acknowledged that thunderstorms would occur within the Central Plains, but disagreed on the exact area of greatest severe weather risk. By 7:00 a.m. CDT, CAPE (convective available potential energy) values began exceeding 4,000 J/kg, an extreme value well above the climatological threshold favoring the development of severe thunderstorms. Despite conflicting model data on the specified area where thunderstorms would develop, the newly available information that denoted a more favorable severe thunderstorm setup in that part of the state prompted the SPC to upgrade the forecasted threat of severe weather to a moderate risk for south-central Kansas, much of the western two-thirds of Oklahoma, and the northwestern and north-central portions of Texas at 11:15 a.m. CDT that morning, which now indicated that the atmospheric conditions present would \\"provide sufficient shear for a few strong or violent tornadic supercells given the abundant low level moisture and the high instability.\\" The increasing threat of a severe weather/tornado outbreak for late that afternoon into the evening was reemphasized by NWS Norman forecasters in a Thunderstorm Outlook issued by the office at 12:30 p.m. CDT. By the early afternoon hours, forecasters at both the SPC and NWS Norman (both of which shared an office complex near Max Westheimer Airport at the time), realized that a major event was likely to take place based solely on observational data from radar and weather satellite imagery and balloon soundings, as the computer models remained uncooperative in helping meteorologists determine where the greatest threat of severe storms would occur. Conditions became highly conducive for tornadic development by 1:00 p.m. CDT as wind shear intensified over the region (as confirmed by an unscheduled balloon sounding flight conducted by the NWS Norman office), creating a highly unstable atmosphere. The sounding balloon recorded winds blowing southwesterly at and respectively at the surface and at the level, southerly winds of and westerly winds of at ; it also indicated that a capping inversion over the region was weakening in southwestern Oklahoma and north Texas. With the warm air above the surface cooling down, this allowed warm air at the surface the chance to rise and potentially create thunderstorms. Although cirrus clouds ‚àí a bank of which had developed in west Texas and overspread portions of Oklahoma later in the morning ‚àí were present through much of the day, an area of clearing skies over western north Texas and southwestern Oklahoma early that afternoon allowed for the sun to heat up the moisture-laden region, creating significant atmospheric instability. At 3:49 p.m. CDT, the SPC ‚àí having gathered enough data to surmise that there was a credible threat of a significant severe weather outbreak occurring within the next few hours ‚àí amended its Day 1 Convective Outlook to place the western nine-tenths of the main body of Oklahoma, central and south-central Kansas and the northern two-thirds of Texas under a high severe weather risk, denoting a higher than normal probability of strong (F2+) tornadoes within the risk area. About 40 minutes after the revised outlook's issuance, at 4:30 p.m. CDT, the SPC issued a tornado watch for western and central Oklahoma, effective from 4:45 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. CDT that evening, for the threat of tornadoes, hail up to in diameter, wind gusts to and intense lightning. As that happened, the first thunderstorm cell of the unfolding event had already formed over southwestern Oklahoma. Storm development and track Visible satellite loops of supercells A (yellow arrow) and B (blue arrow) The thunderstorm that eventually produced the F5 tornado began developing around 3:20 p.m. CDT that afternoon over northeastern Tillman County (southwest of Faxon). Despite the lack of overall lift prevalent in the region, the storm formed out of a contrail-like horizontal area of convective clouds that developed during peak surface heating over southwestern Oklahoma, located well ahead of the dry line that was still positioned farther to the west, which provided enhanced lift and speed shear necessary to develop the supercell. Tracking northeast, the storm strengthened and entered Comanche County shortly after 4:00 p.m. CDT. By 4:15 p.m. CDT, the NWS Norman office issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Comanche County, as the initial storm continued to rapidly intensify over the southern half of the county; there, hail up to in diameter fell. As the supercell's mesocyclonic rotation began to rapidly strengthen at the cloud base, a tornado warning was issued for the counties of Comanche, Caddo, and Grady at 4:50 p.m. CDT; one minute later, a small tornado roughly in diameter ‚àí the first of fourteen associated with supercell \\"A\\" (NWS Norman designated lettered names for the three tornado-producing supercells in the outbreak in storm surveys) ‚àí touched down east-northeast of Medicine Park along U.S. Route 62. Five more tornadoes developed as the storm continued northeast; a sixth one, which would be given an F3 rating, touched down a short time later and caused substantial damage in central Grady County, including some to the Chickasha Municipal Airport, where roofs were torn off of two hangars. At 6:23 p.m. CDT, a ninth tornado associated with supercell \\"A\\" touched down about south-southwest of Amber. The tornado quickly intensified in both strength and size as it crossed Oklahoma State Highway 92, attaining F4 strength about east-northeast of Amber. It quickly became a wedge tornado, varying between in width at various points throughout the track. Damage consistent with this rating was sustained over the following of the path before striking Bridge Creek. There, it attained the highest-possible rating on the Fujita Scale, F5. A mobile Doppler weather radar recorded winds of within the tornado at Bridge Creek, the highest wind speed ever recorded on Earth. Since the record for maximum winds are reported from only non-tornadic events, however, the wind gust from Cyclone Olivia in 1996 retained the title. Damage in Bridge Creek was extreme, as many homes were swept away completely, leaving only concrete slabs where the structures once stood. Damage surveyors noted that the remaining structural debris from some of the homes in this area was finely granulated into small fragments, and that trees and shrubs were completely debarked. A few of these homes were bolted to their foundations. Approximately 200 houses and mobile homes were destroyed, and hundreds of other structures were damaged. The Ridgecrest Baptist Church in Bridge Creek was also destroyed in the process. Extensive ground scouring occurred, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from where they originated, including a mangled pickup truck that was found wrapped around a telephone pole. About of asphalt was scoured off one road. About twelve people died in Bridge Creek, nine of whom were in mobile homes; all fatalities and the majority of injuries were concentrated in the Willow Lake and Southern Hills Additions and Bridge Creek Estates, consisting mostly of mobile homes. Over 39 people were injured in the area as well. Continuing northeastward, the tornado briefly weakened to F4 status before re-strengthening to F5 intensity as it neared the Grady-McClain County line, where a car was thrown roughly in the air, and a well-built home with anchor bolts was reduced to a bare slab. At this time, it had attained a width of , having grown to its largest width after crossing the South Canadian River into the southern Oklahoma City limits. The tornado then became quickly rain- wrapped, with KFOR-TV's Jim Gardner reporting that the tornado was at least a mile wide, and was embedded or rain-wrapped, making it difficult to see. As it was becoming clear that a particularly violent tornado was moving into some of the most densely populated areas of central Oklahoma, around 6:57 p.m. CDT, NWS Norman issued the first-ever tornado emergency for southern portions of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. David Andra, a meteorologist at the NWS Norman office, said that, in drafting the enhanced warning, he wanted to \\"paint the picture [to residents in the areas that were to be affected by the storm] that a rare and deadly tornado was imminent in the metro area.\\" For its initial usage, the enhanced wording was released as part of a standalone Severe Weather Statement (NWS code: SVS), which were (and still are) normally meant to update the public on an existing tornado warning or severe thunderstorm warning. For tornado warnings, the SVS provides updated information on the approximate location of the storm's base-level rotation or, if it occurred after the initial warning was issued, a tornado reported by the public, civil defense personnel or storm spotters, or with the later advent of dual-polarization radar in the early 2010s, verified by radar-detected debris signatures. (In future issuances, tornado emergencies were issued within either the initial tornado warning issuance or an SVS providing updated information on a tornado warning already in effect.) Two minutes later, at 6:59 p.m. CDT, the SPC issued a Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado watch for much of the central third of Oklahoma, effective from 7:15 p.m. until midnight CDT on the early morning of May 4; the SPC watch product discussion noted that the extreme instability compensated for \\"somewhat marginal\\" wind shear to enhance the threat of strong to violent tornadoes. F5 damage to a house in Bridge Creek, with severe debarking and ground scouring visible on the property. Paralleling along Interstate 44, the tornado moved into McClain County, where it crossed the highway twice at F4 intensity, killing a woman who was blown out from an underpass where she was attempting to seek shelter after being dragged down the embankment by the intense channeling winds; her 11-year-old son ‚àí with whom the woman vacated their stalled car nearby ‚àí survived, staying held tight onto the steel girders of the overpass. A man who helped the mother and son up the overpass suffered severe injuries to his leg, which was partially sliced by a highway sign thrown by the winds. At 7:10 p.m. CDT, a satellite tornado touched down over an open field north of Newcastle; it was rated as an F0 due to lack of damage. In McClain County, 38 homes and two businesses were destroyed and 40 homes, some of which were leveled at F4 intensity, were flattened; seventeen people were injured. After crossing the Canadian River, the tornado entered Cleveland County and weakened to F2 intensity. By this time, it had entered the south side of Oklahoma City. Several minutes after entering the county, it re-attained F4 status, and then moved directly into the city of Moore, reaching F5 intensity for a third time. Some of the most severe damage took place in Cleveland County, mainly in Moore, where eleven people were killed and 293 others were injured. The tornado caused an estimated $450 million in damage across the county. The first area impacted in Moore was the Country Place Estates subdivision, where 50 homes were destroyed and one was swept cleanly from its foundation at F5 intensity. Several vehicles were picked up and tossed nearly away from their previous location. According to local police, an airplane wing, believed to have been from an airport in Grady County (possibly lofted into the storm's updraft when the supercell's sixth tornado hit Chickasha Municipal Airport), was found near Country Place Estates. Then, the powerful tornado struck the densely populated Eastlake Estates at F5 intensity, killing three people and reducing entire rows of homes to rubble. In one instance, four adjacent homes were completely destroyed, with only concrete slabs remaining, warranting an F5 rating at that location. Three other homes in this housing division also received F5 damage, with the remaining destruction rated high-end F4. Severe debarking of trees was noted in this area. At the Emerald Springs Apartments, three more people were killed and a two-story apartment building was mostly flattened. Approximate tracks of the supercells during the outbreak. The supercell that spawned the F5 tornado is marked \\"A\\" in green. As the tornado entered Cleveland County, NWS Norman activated emergency procedures, preparing to evacuate staff and others present at the facility in the event that the supercell should turn right, placing areas surrounding the Norman campus in the tornado's path (under NOAA protocol in situations posing a danger to personnel at local Weather Forecast Offices and related guidance centers, responsibility over the issuance of warnings and statements on the unfolding outbreak would have been transferred to the nearest NWS Forecast Office, based in Tulsa, while the SPC's forecasting responsibilities would be turned over to the 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base). The supercell, however, continued on a northeastward track, sparing the Norman area. Safety precautions were also enacted elsewhere in and near the storm's path; council members and citizens at Moore City Hall ‚àí where a council meeting was scheduled to be held that evening ‚àí sheltered in place in the building's first-floor restrooms, away from the multiple large-pane windows at its facade. In downtown Oklahoma City, spectators attending sporting events held that evening involving two of the city's minor league teams ‚Äì a regular season Pacific Coast League baseball game between the Oklahoma RedHawks and the Memphis Redbirds (which was suspended during the second inning) and Game 2 of the Ray Miron President's Cup series between the Central Hockey League's Oklahoma City Blazers and Huntsville Channel Cats ‚Äì were also evacuated to shelter in an underground storage area connected to the Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ballpark and Myriad Convention Center amid concerns that the storm would jog northward and place Oklahoma City itself in the tornado's path. Flights were grounded at Will Rogers World Airport as the northern edge of the supercell (containing hail up to , straight-line wind gusts up to , and moderate to heavy rain) approached the area; the tornado turned right, away from southwestern parts of the city proper located within Oklahoma County, shortly before airport officials began evacuating employees and visitors at the terminals. Traffic on Interstate 35 in south Oklahoma City and north Moore became backed up for several miles, as drivers evacuated from their vehicles to seek shelter under an overpass overlooking South Shields Boulevard. Just outside the Eastlake Estates, an honors ceremony was being held at Westmoore High School at the time of the tornado. Adequate warning time allowed those at the school to seek shelter, however, and more than 400 adults and students attending the awards ceremony at the school's auditorium were moved to the main building, sheltering in reinforced hallways and bathrooms. Ultimately, Westmoore High sustained heavy damage and dozens of cars that were in the school's parking lot were tossed around, some of which were completely destroyed or thrown into nearby homes. No injuries took place at the school, though a horse was found dead between a couple of destroyed cars in this area. The tornado proceeded through additional densely populated areas of Moore shortly thereafter, where several large groups of homes were flattened in residential areas, with a mixture of high-end F4 and low-end F5 damage noted in the survey. Near Janeway Avenue, four people were killed in an area where multiple homes were completely destroyed. A woman, who took shelter with her husband and two children, was also killed when she was blown out from under the Shields overpass on Interstate 35. The tornado weakened somewhat as it moved through the Highland Park neighborhood of Moore, but still caused widespread F3 and F4 damage. An American flag blows in the wind next to the remains of a home destroyed by the tornado. The tornado entered Oklahoma County and struck the southeast fringes of Oklahoma City, where it re- intensified to high-end F4 strength; two people were killed in this area as a building housing a trucking company was completely destroyed. Shortly before it tracked into the county, patrons and employees at Crossroads Mall were evacuated to storage areas in the basement of the building. Numerous industrial buildings were leveled in this area of the city. A freight railroad car, weighing was thrown . The car bounced as it traveled, remaining airborne for at a time. Multiple homes were also completely destroyed in southeast Oklahoma City, and one woman was killed in that area. Crossing Southeast 44th Street into Del City, the tornado moved through the highly populated Del Aire housing addition, killing six people and damaging or destroying hundreds of homes, with many sustaining F3 to F4 damage. Seven people were killed as a direct result of the tornado in Del City, and hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed. The tornado then crossed Sooner Road, and subsequently damaged an entry gate and several buildings at Tinker Air Force Base; it then crossed 29th Street into Midwest City, destroying one building at the Boeing Complex and damaging two others. Widespread F3/F4 damage continued as the tornado moved across Interstate 40, affecting a large business district. Approximately 800 vehicles at Hudiburg Auto Group were damaged, located just south of Interstate 40. Hundreds of vehicles at the dealership were moved from their original location on the lot, and dozens of vehicles (including 30 awaiting tune-ups or repairs at Morris' Auto Machine and Supply, and an unoccupied Mid- Del School District bus) were picked up and tossed northward across the interstate into several motels, being carried a distance of approximately two- tenths of a mile. Numerous motels and other businesses, including Hampton Inn, Comfort Inn, Inn Suites, Clarion Inn, Cracker Barrel, and portions of Rose State College, were destroyed. While some of the damage through this area was rated high-end F4, low-end F5 was considered. The tornado then continued into another residential area located between Southeast 15th and Reno Avenue, where three fatalities occurred. Damage consistent with high-end F4 wind speeds was inflicted to four homes in this area. Two of these homes were located between Southeast 11th and 12th Streets, near Buena Vista, and the other two homes were located on Will Rogers Road, just south of Southeast 15th. Damage then diminished rapidly to F0/F1 strength as the tornado crossed Reno Avenue, before dissipating three blocks north of Reno, between Sooner Road and Air Depot Boulevard (south of the Midwest City‚ÄìOklahoma City line). Throughout Oklahoma County, twelve people were killed and 234 others were injured while losses amounted to $450 million. Impact and casualties Overhead view of damage in Oklahoma City. Thirty-six people were killed as a direct result of the storm and five more died of indirect causes in the hours following it; most of the indirect deaths were due to heart attacks or injuries suffered while trying to seek shelter. One survivor was uninjured but died from a self- inflicted gunshot wound in an apparent reaction to losing his home in the tornado. According to the Oklahoma Department of Health, an estimated 583 people were injured by the tornado, accounting for those who did not go to the hospital or were unaccounted for. A total of 8,132 homes, 1,041 apartments, 260 businesses, eleven public buildings, and seven churches were damaged or destroyed. Estimated damage costs totaled $1.2 billion, making it the first recorded tornado to exceed $1 billion. The Bridge Creek‚àíMoore tornado produced an estimated of debris from the buildings that were destroyed. This was the deadliest tornado recorded in Oklahoma since a long-track F5 tornado killed 107 people in Woodward on April 9, 1947. It was also the deadliest tornado ever recorded in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area; the previous record was held by an F4 tornado that affected southwestern portions of the city on June 12, 1942, which killed 31 people and caused $500,000 in damage ($ million in ( USD) when adjusted for inflation). It was the costliest tornado in U.S. history until it was surpassed by an EF4 tornado that hit Tuscaloosa and northern portions of Birmingham, Alabama, on April 27, 2011, causing an estimated $2.45 billion in damage (, the Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado is the fourth-costliest tornado, having also been surpassed by the EF5 tornadoes that hit Joplin on May 22, 2011, and areas of Moore near the 1999 storm track on May 20, 2013). NWS researchers estimated that the death toll from the storm would likely have exceeded 600 had it not been for the advanced warning through local television and radio stations and proper safety precautions being exercised by area residents. Because Oklahoma has historically been climatologically prone to tornadic activity, Oklahoma City-area television stations KFOR-TV (channel 4), KOCO-TV (channel 5) and KWTV (channel 9) ‚Äì each of which provided continuous coverage of the outbreak that spawned the Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado and its ensuing aftermath from the event's start on the afternoon of May 3 through the evening of May 4 ‚Äì have long relied on state- of-the-art radar technology and visual confirmation from news helicopters and in-house storm chasing fleets to cover severe weather events. The three network-affiliated stations, other local media outlets and the NWS also routinely conduct various tornado preparedness symposiums to ensure residents undertake precautions in the event a tornado or other severe weather affects their area. Aftermath Urban search and rescue teams were deployed to help search for missing persons in the wake of the tornado. Following the destructive and widespread tornado outbreak, President Bill Clinton signed a major disaster declaration for eleven Oklahoma counties (including the four that were affected by the Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado, Cleveland, McClain, Grady and Oklahoma) on May 4. In a press statement by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), then-director James Lee Witt stated that, \\"The President is deeply concerned about the tragic loss of life and destruction caused by these devastating storms.\\" The American Red Cross opened ten shelters overnight across central Oklahoma, housing 1,600 people immediately following the disaster. By May 5, this number had lowered to 500. Throughout May 5, several post-disaster teams from FEMA were deployed to the region, including emergency response and preliminary damage assessment units. The U.S. Department of Defense deployed the 249th Engineering Battalion and placed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on standby for assistance. Medical and mortuary teams were also sent by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. By May 6, donation centers and phone banks were being established to create funds for victims of the tornadoes. Continuing search and rescue efforts for thirteen people who were listed as missing through May 7 were assisted by urban search and rescue dogs from across the country. Nearly 1,000 members of the Oklahoma National Guard were deployed throughout the affected region. The American Red Cross had set up ten mobile feeding stations by this time and stated that 30 more were en route. On May 8, a disaster recovery center was opened in Moore for individuals recovering from the tornadoes. According to the Army Corps of Engineers, roughly 500,000 cubic yards (382,277 cubic meters) of debris was left behind and would likely take weeks to clear. Within the first few days of the disaster declaration, relief funds began being sent to families who requested aid. By May 9, roughly $180,000 had been approved by FEMA for disaster housing assistance. Residents search for belongings in the remains of their homes. Debris removal finally began on May 12 as seven cleanup teams were sent to the region, more were expected to join over the following days. That day, FEMA also declared that seven counties ‚àí Canadian, Craig, Grady, Lincoln, Logan, Noble and Oklahoma ‚àí were eligible for federal financial assistance. By May 13, roughly $1.6 million in disaster funds had been approved for housing and businesses loans. This quickly rose to more than $5.9 million over the following five days. By May 21, more than 3,000 volunteers from across the country traveled to Oklahoma to help residents recover; 1,000 of these volunteers were sent to Bridge Creek to clean up debris, cut trees, sort donations and cook meals. With a $452,199 grant from FEMA, a 60-day outreach program for victims suffering tornado-related stress was set up to help them cope with trauma. Applications for federal aid continued through June, with state approvals reaching $54 million on June 3. By this date, the Army Corps of Engineers reported that 964,170 cubic yards (737,160 cubic meters), roughly 58%, of the 1.65 million cubic yards (1.26 million cubic meters) of debris had been removed. Assistance for farmers and ranchers who suffered severe losses from the tornadoes was also available by June 3. After more than a month of being open, emergency shelters were set to be closed on June 18. On June 21, an educational road show made by FEMA visited the hardest hit areas in Oklahoma to urge residents to build storm cellars. According to FEMA, more than 9,500 residents applied for federal aid during the allocated period in the wake of the tornadoes. Most of the applicants lived in Oklahoma and Cleveland counties, 3,800 and 3,757 persons respectively. In all, disaster recovery aid for the tornadoes amounted to roughly $67.8 million by the end of July 2. Over the following four years, a $12 million project to construct storm shelters for residents across the Oklahoma City metropolitan area was enacted. The goal was to create a safer community in a tornado-prone region. By May 2003, a total of 6,016 safe rooms were constructed. On May 9, 2003, the new initiative was put to the test as a tornado outbreak in the region spawned an F4 tornado, which took a path similar to that of the Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado. Due to the higher standards for public safety, no one was killed by the 2003 tornado, a substantial improvement in just four years. On May 20, 2013, an EF5 tornado impacted some of the same areas affected by the 1999 storm, tracking through the heart of Moore. Throughout the city, 24 people were killed (along with one additional person who died as an indirect result of the tornado) and more than 230 were injured. =Highway overpass misconception= Aerial view of one of the overpasses under which one person was killed by the tornado. From a meteorological and safety standpoint, the tornado also brought into question the use of highway overpasses as shelters. Prior to the events on May 3, 1999, videos of people taking shelter in overpasses during tornadoes in the past ‚Äì most notably one filmed near Wichita, Kansas, during the April 26, 1991 tornado outbreak involving a television news crew from Wichita NBC affiliate KSNW (channel 3), who decided to shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike alongside other bystanders who found themselves in the path of the tornado ‚Äì gave the public misunderstanding that overpasses provided shelter from tornadoes. For nearly twenty years, meteorologists had questioned the safety of these structures; however, they lacked incidents involving loss of life. In the aforementioned 1991 footage, the subjects were able to safely ride out the tornado due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Indeed, the May 1999 tornado outbreak proved concerns that highway overpasses were dangerous places to seek shelter during a tornado, as three overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, with a fatality taking place at each one. Two of these were from the F5 Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado while the third was from a comparatively less intense F2, which struck a rural area in Payne County, north-northeast of Oklahoma City; many other serious to life-threatening injuries also occurred at these locations. The casualties at the three overpasses are attributed to the Venturi effect, as tornadic winds were accelerated in the confined space of each of the overpasses that the tornadoes passed through, increasing the chances that those riding out the tornado would be blown out at high speeds even if they tried to anchor themselves to the girders. According to a study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), seeking shelter in an overpass \\"is to become a stationary target for flying debris.\\" =Engineering flaws= Preliminary damage surveys conducted by a group of structural engineers from Texas Tech University determined that many of the frame homes that were destroyed by the Bridge Creek‚àíMoore tornado were constructed below minimal residential building code standards, discovering some structural deficiencies that violated codes, which were considered to be inadequate for regions prone to tornadic activity (under federal building code standards, frame homes that were properly strapped and bolted would have withstood winds between 152 and 157 miles per hour (245 and 253 km/h), equivalent to an F2 tornado). The team, led by meteorological researcher Charles Doswell and storm damage engineer/meteorologist Tim Marshall, determined that nails attached to a plywood roof deck in one damaged home were not properly anchored to the rafters; several homes in rural areas that were swept nearly from their original location did not have anchor bolts that secured the frame to their foundations, as was the case at Country Place Estates, where the homes ‚àí which left a trail of debris strewn away from their location ‚àí were attached to the concrete foundations by tapered cut nails that extended only a half-inch to the bases; many homes that were left at least partially standing also had their garage doors (mainly those made from aluminum material) collapse inward, allowing the tornado's destructive winds to enter the houses. Marshall discovered other building and vehicle remains that became debris missiles, including a twisted steel beam, a steel leg broken off of a lawn chair that was impaled into a post by the violent winds and a section of a sewer pipe that was blown into the interior hallway of one house through the front door. The team's findings also revealed that several homes were obliterated before they experienced the full impact of the vortex's peak wind velocities, with some disintegrating as the external winds surrounding the parent tornado reached speeds of F2 intensity. Three months later, as homes were being built in the damage path, Marshall found their construction to be scarcely superior to that of the homes destroyed in the May 3 storm. The FEMA corroborated with Doswell and Marshall's findings in its Building Performance Assessment Team Report on the May 3 outbreak, noting that much of the structural damage resulted from strong winds generated by the tornado and associated windborne debris that often \\"produced forces on buildings not designed to withstand such forces\\" and in some cases, were due to improper construction techniques and \\"poor selection\\" of materials used in their construction. The report acknowledged that federal construction code requirements needed to be revised above the then-current minimum standards to allow newer buildings to better withstand higher wind speeds consistent with tornadoes of lesser intensity than the one that devastated Bridge Creek and Moore, thereby lessening the degree of damage, fatalities and injuries that are probable in buildings of typically less reinforced construction. In popular culture The tornado has been featured in an episode of Discovery Channel's Critical Rescue (produced by New Dominion Pictures), aired in 2003 and NHNZ's Ultimate Disaster (Mega Disaster) on National Geographic Channel in 2006.

He was the father of Oscar Brown Jr. Biography Oscar Cicero Brown was born near Camden, Arkansas, on December 22, 1895. In 1916, he graduated from Howard University in Washington, DC, with degrees in commerce and law. He served in the military during World War I. Lists birthdate as December 23, 1895 and place of birth as Congles Mills, Arkansas In 1929, he founded the law firm of Brown, Brown, Cyrus and Green in Chicago. Gradually, he turned his attention away from law and started the Oscar C. Brown Real Estate Corp. and spent a good part of his life on issues relating to real estate, either as a developer, an activist or as an administrator. In the mid-1930s, disillusioned with the progress of racial integration, Brown seriously considered the concept of separatism. He led a group of African- American intellectuals to initiate the National Movement for the Establishment of a 49th State (there were only 48 United States at the time). He wanted to make a state for only African Americans. In 1944, Brown served as president of the Chicago branch of the NAACP. A major focus of his efforts there were to protest housing segregation and to improve police enforcement in predominantly African-American neighborhoods. He became the first African American appointed to the real estate planning committee of the Illinois Department of Registration and Education in 1964. Brown was also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He died at the University of Chicago Hospital on October 1, 1990, after a lengthy illness. Personal Entertainer and activist Oscar Brown Jr. is his son. He is also the brother of William H. Brown, who was a prominent attorney based in Chicago.

He knows that Russia is angling through diplomacy and intrigue for possession of the Suez Canal and, realizing that unless Britain secures it, the strength of her empire will be lost.

This and Corineus were a pair of figures displayed at Guildhall, London, carved by Captain Richard Saunders in 1709. Gogmagog (also Goemagot, Goemagog, Go√´magot and Gogmagoc) was a legendary giant in Welsh and later English mythology. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (\\"The History of The Kings of Britain\\", 12th century), he was a giant inhabitant of Albion, thrown off a cliff during a wrestling match with Corineus (a companion of Brutus of Troy). Gogmagog was the last of the Giants found by Brutus and his men inhabiting the land of Albion. The effigies of Gogmagog and Corineus, used in English pageantry and later instituted as guardian statues at Guildhall in London eventually earned the familiar names \\"Gog and Magog\\". Etymology The name \\"Gogmagog\\" is often connected to the biblical characters Gog and Magog; however Manley Pope, author of an 1862 English translation of the Welsh chronicle Brut y Brenhinedd (itself a translation of Monmouth's \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\") argued that it was a corruption of Gawr Madoc (Madoc the Great). Geoffrey of Monmouth thumb|upright=1.5|Combat between Brutus's troops and the giants led by Gogmagog. Gogmagog (\\"Goemagot\\", \\"Goemagog\\") in the legend of the founding of Britain as written by Geoffrey of Monmouth in Historia Regum Britanniae (1136). Gogmagog was a giant of Albion who was slain by Corineus, a member of the invading Trojan colonizers headed by Brutus. Corineus was subsequently granted a piece of land that was named \\"Cornwall\\" eponymously after him. The Historia details the encounter as follows: Gogmagog, accompanied by twenty fellow giants, attacked the Trojan settlement and caused great slaughter. The Trojans rallied back and killed all giants, except for \\"one detestable monster named Gogmagog, in stature twelve cubits, and of such prodigious strength that at one shake he pulled up an oak as if it had been a hazel wand\\". He is captured so that Corineus can wrestle with him. The giant breaks three of Corineus's ribs, which so enrages him that he picks up the giant and carries him on his shoulders to the top of a high rock, from which he throws the giant down into the sea. The place where he fell was known as \\"Gogmagog's Leap\\" to posterity. Later versions Gogmagog's combat with Corineus according to Geoffrey was repeated in Wace's Anglo-Norman Brut and Layamon's Middle-English Brut. Because Geoffrey's work is regarded as fact until the late 17th Century, the story has continued to appear in most early histories of Britain. The tale of Gogmagog's ancestry was composed later in the 14th century. Known as the \\"Albina story\\" (or Des Grantz Geanz), it claimed Gogmagog to be a giant descended from Albina and her sisters, thirty daughters of the king of Greece exiled to the land later to be known as \\"Albion\\". This story was added as a prologue to later versions of Brut pseudo-history, Thus according to the Middle English prose version of the Brut, known as the Chronicles of England, Albina was the daughter of Syrian king named Dioclician, from whom Gogmagog and Laugherigan and the other giants of Albion are descended. These giants lived in caves and hills until being conquered by Brutus' party arriving in \\"Tottenesse\\" (Totnes, Devon). A later chapter describes Gogmagog's combat Corineus (Middle English:Coryn) \\"at Totttenes\\", more or less as according to Geoffrey. Gogmagog was the tallest of these giants; Coryn in comparison was at least the largest man from the waist upward among Brutus's crew. Caxton's printed edition, The Cronycles of Englond (1482), closely matches this content.Caxton (1482), The cronycles of Englond, Prolog and Chapter IV. Raphael Holinshed also localizes the event of the \\"leape of Gogmagog\\" at Dover,Holinshed (1587) Hist., I, 10: But William Camden in his 1586 work Brittannia locates it on Plymouth Hoe, perhaps following Richard Carew's Survey of Cornwall. Carew describes \\"the portraiture of two men, one bigger, the other lesser.. (whom they term \\"Gogmagog\\") which was cut upon the ground at the Hawe (i.e. The Hoe) in Plymouth...\\". These figures were first recorded in 1495 and were destroyed by the construction of the Royal Citadel in 1665. Royal Arcade, Melbourne (Australia) Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion preserves the tale as well: Guardians of London Gog and Magog effigies being carried in the Lord Mayor's Show The Lord Mayor's account of Gogmagog says that the Roman Emperor Diocletian had thirty-three wicked daughters. He found thirty- three husbands for them to curb their wicked ways; they chafed at this, and under the leadership of the eldest sister, Alba, they murdered their husbands. For this crime they were set adrift at sea; they washed ashore on a windswept island, which they named \\"Albion\\"‚Äîafter Alba. Here they coupled with demons and gave birth to a race of giants, whose descendants included Gog and Magog.Gog and Magog at the Lord Mayor's Show: official website. Retrieved August 3, 2007. The effigies of two giants were recorded in 1558 at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth I and were described as \\"Gogmagot the Albion\\" and \\"Corineus the Britain\\". These, or similar figures, made of \\"wickerwork and pasteboard\\" made regular appearances in the Lord Mayor's Show thereafter, although they became known as Gog and Magog over the years. New figures were carved from pine in 1709 by Captain Richard Saunders and displayed in the Guildhall until 1940 when they were destroyed in an air-raid; they were replaced by David Evans in 1953. Images of Gog and Magog (depicted as giants) are carried by Lord Mayors of the City of London in a traditional procession in the Lord Mayor's Show each year on the second Saturday of November. In French literature Under the influence of Geoffrey's Gogmagog (Goemagot), Gos et Magos, the French rendition of \\"Gog and Magog\\", were recast in the role of enemies defeated by the giant Gargantua, and taken prisoner to King Arthur who held court in London in Rabelais's Gargantua (1534). Gargantua's father Pantagruel also had an ancestor named Gemmagog, whose name was also a corruption of \\"Gog and Magog\\", influenced by the British legend., citing Lefranc (1922), p. 23 notes. In Irish folklore \\"Gog and Magog giving Paddy a Lift Out of the Mire.\\" From Punch magazine, 1849. Here the giants stand for London, said to be assisting Ireland after the famine by purchasing land to improve trade. Works of Irish mythology, including the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn (the Book of Invasions), expand on the Genesis account of Magog as the son of Japheth and make him the ancestor to the Irish through Parthol√≥n, leader of the first group to colonize Ireland after the Deluge, and a descendant of Magog, as also were the Milesians, the people of the 5th invasion of Ireland. Magog was also the progenitor of the Scythians, as well as of numerous other races across Europe and Central Asia. His three sons were Baath, Jobhath, and Fathochta.

An example of oral history, Pippo is not well documented even in Italy. Overview Pippo had a distinctive buzz, was rarely if ever seen and flew mainly at night. If people were faithful to the Fascists, they considered it an Allied plane. If people were supporters of the Allies, it was thought to be a Luftwaffe or Italian Air Force aircraft. No matter what their political allegiances, people personified it as a ‚Äúhe‚Äù ‚Äì the plane and the pilot as one. It is suspected that the Italian government used Pippo as a propaganda tool to turn ordinary civilians against the Allies, though there is no doubt the plane was real. It is unclear how Pippo got its name. It may have been a play on the Italian moniker for Disney‚Äôs Goofy character or alternatively was based on the pip-pip sounds it apparently made. Despite the unthreatening name, people mainly interpreted Pippo as something fearful. Superstition held that one had to block the lights in one‚Äôs house or Pippo might fire upon it. It was said to drop exploding pens, poisoned candy, or so-called butterfly bombs and to fire on farm workers in fields. Only decades later did historians surmise the likely origin of the plane. When the Allies gained a foothold in Italy in the later years of the war, pilots began flying tactical night missions to survey and intervene in German troop movements. It never occurred to them that they were inadvertently terrorizing the countryside. In particular, the Royal Air Force used a plane called the de Havilland Mosquito.

The church was founded in the town of Lyons, which now the north side of Clinton, Iowa, United States. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2010. History =19th Century= Bishop Mathias Loras of the Diocese of Dubuque said the first Mass in Lyons. The Mass was celebrated in a log home in 1848. The area was visited by various priests, including the Rev. J.A.M. Pelamourges from Davenport, and the Rev. Frederic Cyrille Jean, who was assigned as the first resident pastor. Jean was originally from Baynes, France and came to the United States upon the invitation of Bishop Loras. He came to Lyons from Bellevue and started building a church as soon as he arrived and it was completed in 1852. The building was built of brick and cost $1,500 to construct. The parish grew quickly and a larger church was built in 1856. In 1864 Bishop Clement Smyth laid the cornerstone for the present church. Parishioners helped in building the church without pay. It is a Gothic Revival style building constructed in limestone, which was quarried just outside the town. The building was completed in 1871 and cost the parish $45,000. The building measure 130 by 60 feet and could accommodate 450 people. The ceiling is off the floor. The stained glass windows depict the Twelve Apostles. Two offset spires front the building. The south spires rises and the north spire is high. Father Jean returned to his native France before the church was completed. While there he was given ornate golden chandelier modeled after the crown of France. It was a gift from the Bonaparte family to the parish to be used as the sanctuary lamp. The parish school was built at the same time as the church. It cost $4,000 to build and it was staffed by the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary from Dubuque. In 1861 the German members of the parish formed their own parish a few blocks away called St. Boniface. That left St. Irenaeus a predominately Irish parish. Other parishes were formed to the south in Clinton: St. Mary's (1867), St. Patrick's (1889), and Sacred Heart (1891). =20th Century= In 1906 the church building was completely reversed. Initially, the main entrance of the church faced Fifth Street. North Second Street on the back side of the church became a major thoroughfare through town. To accommodate the change the main entrance of the church was moved to the west side of the church on Second Street and the altar was moved to the east side of the church and the pews were reversed to face the altar. The new entrance also eliminated the long staircases up to the entrances. A gallery was created on the west side of the church. In 1911 all five Clinton parishes joined the Davenport Diocese when Clinton County was transferred to the Diocese of Davenport. A major renovation occurred to the church interior in the 1940s. Simulated stone was applied to the walls to match the exterior of the church, Gothic-style light fixtures were hung, new Stations of the Cross were installed along the side walls and the ceiling was decorated with simulated beams. In the 1960s and 70s, a parish hall, kitchen, meeting rooms and restrooms were built in the basement of the church. The parish school was merged with the school at St. Boniface in the 1970s to form North Catholic School. Eventually, all the Catholic grade schools in Clinton merged to form Prince of Peace School. The parish itself was officially closed in 2006 when the five parishes in Clinton were merged to form Jesus Christ, Prince of Peace Parish. =21st Century= Jesus Christ, Prince of Peace continued to use the old churches until 2008 when a new church was built for the parish on the west side of town. The sanctuary lamp and the older set of the Stations of the Cross were used in the new church. St. Patrick's Church was taken down in 2005 and St. Mary's followed in 2009. Sacred Heart Church is a part of the Prince of Peace School complex and is used for their liturgical needs. A non-profit organization is being formed to preserve St. Boniface Church building as a religious heritage museum. The last Mass at St. Irenaeus was celebrated June 28, 2009, and the church was sold to the Clinton County Historical Society in June 2010. It is being renovated to become a community cultural center that would host public events.

History  = The Beginning = Richter was founded in 1999 by bassist Gustavo Scheller (ex Los Paganos) and keyboardist Nan (ex Rahez), with drummer JD5, singer Capi Sands, replaced a few months later by singer and electronic musician Zenitram, and guitarist Tano Suarez, replaced by John John after he left the band in 2003. In 2000 the band was highlighted by their show in the TV program \\"Volver Rock\\" with Ilya Kuryaki & The Valderramas, in Users Magazine's MP3 II Compilation with some of their first demos, and in Tower Records's Pulse Magazine, that considered them one of the most promising bands in Argentina. A demo tape in 1999 and an EP in 2000 anticipated some of the tracks later included in their first album. = Epicentro = In 2001 the band released their debut album \\"Epicentro\\", with 13 tracks including \\"Universo Kelper\\", \\"Cien Mil Espinas\\", \\"Dagobah Disco\\", \\"Babel\\", and the promotional single \\"Ciudad Sat√©lite\\", Richter's first music video, directed by Ezequiel Berra. \\"Ciudad Sat√©lite\\" entered rotation on main Argentine music channels. In November, the band performed live \\"Epicentro\\" in the official album presentation at a sold-out YMCA Theatre in Buenos Aires, starting what it was called the \\"Gira Sat√©lite\\" (Satellite Tour), with more than 90 shows in Buenos Aires, Santa F√© and the Atlantic Coast all along 2002 and 2003. During this years, the band collaborated in several tribute albums: to Los Fabulosos Cadillacs with their version of \\"Galapagos\\" (2001), to Madonna in Spanish, with a version of \\"Justify My Love\\" (2001), to Los Brujos with \\"Canci√≥n del Cronopio\\" (2002) and to Los Peligrosos Gorriones with \\"Por Tres Monedas\\" (2002). In 2003 they produced a powerful version of \\"A Question Of Time\\" for the Argentine tribute to Depeche Mode \\"South Celebration\\", acclaimed by Latin American and European critics. Richter's version would be later included in European compilation \\"A Metal Tribute to Depeche Mode 5\\" (2008). = Planetas Planos = Richter's second record, \\"Planetas Planos\\", released in early 2004 by the Argentine label Pol√≠gono S√≥nico was actually a 6 track mini album, including their first radial hit \\"Televidente\\", performed live in Mario Pergolini's Cual Es? program, on Rock & Pop FM, one of the most prestigious radios in Argentina. The new material went deeper in the integration between distorted guitars and electronic grooves. Communication, media and message became the album core concept, represented by the idea of the antenna in the cover art. The music video for \\"Televidente\\" featured the band as a kind of orange-dressed commando team that went around the city delivering banners with the iconic cover art antenna. \\"El Enemigo Duerme en Casa\\", \\"Nunca Me Vas a Entender\\",\\"A lo Lejos\\" y \\"Amapola\\" showed the most dark, pop and punk influences of all Richter's music so far. Live performances during the \\"Gira Interplanetaria\\" (Interplanetary Tour) (2004-2005) made the band be rewarded with critical acclaim as one of the most important rising artists in the country. They performed in a band-special emission of the program \\"Cultura Cero\\" on Channel 7, where they anticipated tracks of their next album \\"Danzallamas\\". = Danzallamas and the \\"Danzallamas Tour\\" = \\"Danzallamas\\", Richter's third record, released in September 2005 by Pol√≠gono S√≥nico label, and re-released two years later by the Argentine-Mexican label Loshe Music with two bonus tracks, represented a step ahead in the band sound, lyrics and aesthetics. The new material extended Richter's spectrum to new styles, daring to unexplored rhythms and atmospheres, and deepened the most edgy, forceful and radical side of the rock and electronics mixture, with more aggressive guitars over more compact sequences. The melodies and the power of the sound were combined with the acid poetry of the lyrics, full of sophisticated irony, paper icons, selfishness, destructive modernism, lack of common sense. The concepts of game and danger, reflected in the cover art, stayed all along the album. The music video for promotional single \\"Casa Fantasma\\", an acid critic to yellow press, entered rotation on the most important Latin American and Argentine TV channels. And \\"Te Vas a Berlin\\", second video from the album, represented a step ahead in Richter's visuals, with careful, dark and futuristic aesthetics. Also \\"El Pa√≠s de Maradona\\", \\"La Virgen de la Pasarela\\", \\"Kill\\" and \\"Caso Escaso\\" became classics in the band's performances, highly celebrated by the audience. In 2007, the album re-release for Latin America included two bonus tracks: a remix of \\"Casa Fantasma\\", and the previously unreleased \\"Libre de Culpa y Cargo\\", with El Otro Yo's Cristian Aldana in vocals. The music video for this song became the third single from the album, and it also featured Cristian Aldana, along with the band, in one of their most punk and psychedelic releases. It was the first Richter video directed by Guillermo Tello. right Simultaneously with the album original release, the band started their most ambitious tour so far. The \\"Gira Danzallamas\\" (Danzallamas Tour), with 101 concerts all around Argentina, and for the first time, also in Uruguay, including the official album presentation at Auditorio BAUEN of Buenos Aires, on 19 November 2005, and explosive shows in Baradero Rock 2005, Pepsi Music 2007 and 40 Years of the Argentine Rock festivals. In 2006, the band also produced their own version of \\"Cosas M√≠as\\" for the tribute compilation to Miguel Abuelo \\"Quiero Ser Abuelo\\". They performed the song live at Centro Cultural Borges, in Buenos Aires, on occasion of the official tribute presentation. = Fin del Mundo, the \\"To the End of the World Tour\\" and \\"Cuentakilometros\\" DVD = Fin del Mundo, released in September 2008, was Richter's fourth album and the first to be released simultaneously in all Latin America by the Argentine-Mexican label Loshe Music. Recorded at Panda and Orion studios (Buenos Aires) by the experienced engineers Mart√≠n Russo and Pablo Rabinovich, and produced by Zenitram with the collaboration of Diego Vainer, the new release deepened the unique sound that had become the band trade mark: rock, electronics and dance songs with acid lyrics. Darker than the previous album, and with a higher presence of synthesizers, effects and electronic sequences, Fin del Mundo represented a kind of confluence to Richter's essence, an acid, ironic and paradoxical combination of extremes, from party to sorrow. With a rather futuristic and apocalyptic concept, the double sense of the album name (\\"End of the World\\"), as \\"end of times\\" and also referring to the geographical position of Argentina in the map, wrapped intriguing lyrics that called to celebration among defeat, confusion, decadence and marginality. The two first singles from the album, \\"Corte de Luz\\" and \\"Retro-80\\" are clear examples of this concept line, as well as \\"Knock-Out\\", \\"J√≠baros\\", \\"Bon Vivant\\" or \\"Pa√≠s Subtropical\\". At the same time, \\"Papparazzi/Violador\\", \\"Kriptonita\\" and \\"Sol de Medianoche\\" were acclaimed by the audience. \\"Retro-80\\" would be released in late 2009 as a cassette-single with a version of Vox Dei's \\"Las Guerras\\" as B side. This strange format (in line with the track name) was highlighted for its originality by the most important Argentine music critics. \\"Corte de Luz\\" music video, an ironic celebration of the chaos during a black out, filmed in the streets of Bragado city, in Buenos Aires province, entered heavy rotation on the most important Latin American and Argentine music channels. And \\"Retro-80\\", a bizarre performance of the band on an old fashioned TV program, included the first incursion of digital animation in Richter's videography. Both were directed by Guillermo Tello. right The \\"Gira Hasta el Fin del Mundo\\" (Tour to the End of the World) performing the album, became the largest national tour ever undertaken by an electro-rock band, and one of the most important national tours self-produced by an independent band, reaching more than 50 cities, and up to 40.000 km from Salta to Ushuaia and from the Atlantic Coast and Uruguay to Mendoza, including a well remembered special performance at Cosqu√≠n Rock 2009 festival, and two shows at Niceto Club (Buenos Aires) supporting German electro-pop legends Camouflage. The \\"Cuentakilometros (Girando Hasta el Fin del Mundo)\\" DVD, released in October 2011, was conceived as a documentary about the tour, featuring several interviews, live shots and backstage testimonies, and included the tour-inspired \\"Paparazzi / Violador\\" music video (third single from \\"Fin del Mundo\\", directed by Maria Paz Caldarone and Federico Roitberg) as promotional clip. The DVD also featured the band's complete videography and two previously unreleased bonus tracks: \\"Hotel de Inmigrantes\\" and \\"La Chacra y la Mugre\\", originally recorded during the \\"Fin del Mundo\\" sessions. All along this period, the band continued to participate in different tributes: at the beginning of 2010, their version of Vox Dei's \\"Las Guerras\\" (the same that was released the previous year as \\"Retro-80\\"¬¥s cassette-single b-side), was included in the 9-disc box set \\"Una Celebracion del Rock Argentino\\" (An Argentine Rock Celebration) by legendary Litto Nebbia's label Melopea Discos, with the support of Argentine National Secretary of Culture. And in 2011, Richter's version of Virus's \\"El Probador\\" was released by \\"Arde Rock & Roll\\" magazine in its tribute CD \\"Rock en tu Forma de Ser\\". = Transformador, the \\"Transforma-Tour\\" and \\"Transforma2\\" = During 2011, the band went into the studio again to record and produce \\"Transformador\\", their fifth album, and the first double one in their discography, released in March 2012 by labels El Cuzco Records (in Argentina) and Loshe Music (in Mexico). The album, recorded at El Cuzco studios, in the west of Greater Buenos Aires, was in the band's own words \\"The most rocker album from Richter, and the most techno as well, that is, the most electro- rocker one. Guitar riffs and bass patterns come from the rock and roll origins, and from punk. Programming is aggressive, inspired in EBM, industrial and techno-pop. Even if it is a double album, Transformador is a fast album, fast and sharp. In Fin del Mundo and Danzallamas Richter deployed all the cutlery, in Transformador we only used the knife\\". Lyrics in \\"Transformador\\" became rawer and more complainant, following the album's sound concept, more aggressive, acid and ironic than its predecessor, highlighting situations of failure and breakage, family dysfunctions and social crisis of the system. right The album also included the first cover song in Richter's discography: a version of Gary Numan's \\"Cars\\", a tribute to an age that deeply influenced the band during the composition of \\"Transformador\\": the late 1970s and early 1980s, the new wave, the post-punk and the beginning of electro-pop. Anticipating the forthcoming album, the music video for \\"Arbol de la Ciencia\\", the first single, entered in heavy rotation in main music TV channels in Argentina, and was premiered in Richter's official YouTube channel in January 2012. The clip, produced by renowned director Diego Tucci for Refugio Films, was filmed in the old facilities of SIAM factory, in the south of Greater Buenos Aires, with an esthetic concept that combined modernity and vintage. It also evoked the golden ages of the Argentine industry in the 1950s and 1960s: the abandoned environment of what was one of the most important electric appliances factory in Argentina, and peronist-designed motorcycles and cars. \\"Arbol de la Ciencia\\" music video was later followed by the other two singles from \\"Transformador\\": \\"Turra\\", released in later 2012, also filmed by Refugio Films team in and old fashioned house in Buenos Aires; and \\"Suiza\\", in 2014, a surrealist and dark pilgrimage directed by Maria Paz Caldarone, filmed in Newton, a little village 200 km. south of Buenos Aires. In March 2012, the band started the \\"Transforma-Tour\\", a tour that took them again to the entire Argentina, Uruguay, and for the first time Mexico, including outstanding performances at Malvinas Argentinas Stadium (Buenos Aires) supporting Creed, Niceto Club again supporting Camouflage, Vorterix Theatre supporting El Otro Yo, and the Tianguis Cultural del Chopo (Mexico D.F.) The sold-out official album presentation at The Roxy Live (Buenos Aires) on 2 June 2012, was considered by the audience as \\"the best show in Richter¬¥s history so far\\". As a closing for the \\"Transformador\\" period, the band released in September 2014, through the brand new label Undertecno, \\"Transforma2 ‚Äì Transformador Remixes\\", a remixes album featuring several versions of \\"Transformador\\" tracks, produced by important artists of the Argentine electronic scene like Club Rayo, Cosaquitos en Globo, Tecnoman SF, Lowpez, Sintex Bortexx, Vitraux, Tyvar and more. The new album also included the previously unreleased \\"Malasangre\\" as bonus track. Before the end of the \\"Transforma-Tour\\", in early 2015, JD5 left the band, being replaced in drums by Paula Perrella. = Richteria and the \\"Richteria Tour\\" = All along 2015 and 2016, the band undertook the production of its sixth album at El Cuzco (Buenos Aires) and Akut (M√©xico D.F.) studios. After more than two years of work, \\"Richteria\\" was released by Undertecno label in Argentina on September 2016. right \\"Richteria\\" was the most electro-punk album in the band's history, deploying a synthetic, raw, aggressive sound, acid and direct lyrics, and a visual concept with references to third-world retrofuturism, between the bizarre and the paranormal. In September 2016 the band started the \\"Richteria Tour\\", that took them for the first time to Chile, with shows in Valpara√≠so and Santiago, and important festivals all over Argentina, such as the Rock al Campo (Quiroga), the Rock y Campo (Colon) and the Fiesta de la Confluencia (Neuqu√©n). The album official presentation in Buenos Aires took place on 11 and 12 November 2016, at the Caras y Caretas Theater (San Telmo).
