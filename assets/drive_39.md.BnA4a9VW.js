The bridge connects the N. Domingo Street in San Juan and Old Santa Mesa Street in Manila. The location of the bridge served as a battlefield during the 1896 Philippine Revolution against the Spaniards and the 1899 Philippine–American War. On, January 29, 1899, Colonel Luciano San Miguel, Filipino Commander had his first meeting with Colonel John M. Stotsenburg, Commander of the First Nebraska Volunteers on this bridge to discuss the boundaries of their respective forces. On February 4, 1899, an encounter between the Filipino and American forces led to a shooting incident and sparked the Battle of Manila. On February 5, 2009, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines installed a historical marker on San Juan River Bridge commemorating its role to the start of the Battle of Manila.  History  After Emilio Aguinaldo issued the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12, 1898, at Kawit, Cavite, there still was uneasy peace around Manila. Filipinos revolutionaries felt that Spain simply ceded the Philippines to the United States who were determined to take over from where the Spaniards left off. American forces started to come between June and July 1898 where 8,000 were deployed around Manila and 11,000 more deployed along the Zapote Line. On December 5, 1898, the First Nebraska Volunteer Infantry under Colonel John M. Stotsenburg, started to camp in Santa Mesa, Manila just near the San Juan River Bridge. Their camp was surrounded on three side by Philippine forces led by Colonel Luciano San Miguel. The Nebraskans were outnumbered so they had to build their defense consisting of a series of outposts. They had regular patrol around the area since they felt restless on their location. On the evening of February 4, 1899, Private William Walter Grayson, Private Orville Miller and another soldier were patrolling the area when they encountered insurgents. Grayson and Miller asked them to \\"Halt!\\" but the armed men continued to advance. This prompted Grayson to fire the first shots and retreated back to their line. This spread to the other parts of the line and sparked an exchange of shots between the Filipinos and the Americans. The following day, February 5, 1899, General Elwell Stephen Otis deployed his troops to Santa Mesa and later on sparked the Battle of Manila The Battle of Manila started just two days before the US Senate ratified the Treaty of Paris on February 6, 1899. The war that lasted till 1902 resulted in the death of more than 4,200 Americans and over 20,000 Filipino nationalists. On September 15, 2018, the bridge was demolished to give way for the construction of Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3 Section 2B, which passes over San Juan River. The barges needed to lay the foundations of the pillar sections of Skyway required the bridge's demolition to gain access to the construction area. The bridge was reconstructed and it reopened on March 11, 2020.

It is sung by Moses (singing voice of Amick Byram) after discovering that he is adopted, which results in him questioning his Egyptian identity and his Hebrew heritage. It is reprised shortly after by the Queen (Linda Dee Shayne), who reassures him of his place in their family. Both songs are collectively referred to as All I Ever Wanted (With Queen's Reprise) on the film's soundtrack. The song was composed by Stephen Schwartz. Inspiration As Joe and Vicki Traci explained in their article Breathing Life Into The Prince of Egypt: \\"Schwartz came up with the inspiration of the song All I Ever Wanted, sung by Moses when he first discovered the truth about his past, when Schwartz visited Egypt. One moonlit night the team had gotten permission to visit an Egyptian Temple that was not yet opened to the public. He recalls, 'There was something about walking through those beautiful white columns reflected in the moonlight and seeing the hieroglyphs that triggered the tune which became, All I Ever Wanted.'\\" Composition and Production Filmtracks notes: \\"The Plagues...challenges the lyrical nature of the film's early songs with deliberately harsh chanting that battles quite strikingly with a pseudo-reprise of All I Ever Wanted. While Moses was voiced by Val Kilmer, all of his songs were sung by Amick Byram. Critical reception Filmtracks wrote \\"The uplifting and buoyant All I Ever Wanted is the closest Schwartz comes to emulating the hero's song of aspiration that Alan Menken made famous throughout the decade. The determination in this short song is convincing and the queen's reprise is elegantly merged with the river melody from Deliver Us at its conclusion.\\" Soundtracks also praised the song: \\"In \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" Zimmer shows intelligent theme usage by employing the theme to be more fleshed out later in The Plagues. A very convincing portrayal of Moses and the emotional conflict within him is created by these two songs. The weight of his choice between God and the Hebrews, or the life he had known as an Egyptian prince forms a very strong musical identity.\\" AnimatedMovieReview wrote \\"after watching one would definitely understand Moses and his family better as people (and not just Bible figures), especially with the song All I Ever Wanted. FilmScoreReview wrote \\"the accompaniment for some solos, including “All I Ever Wanted” helps to get the message across to the audience of Moses’s personal struggles with who he is and has become\\". Not all reviews were positive, however. Entertainment Weekly wrote \\"Even on repeat listenings, Moses' requisite I-want song  called, lamely, All I Ever Wanted  simply isn't memorable, no matter that the star-crossed royal helpfully whistles snatches of it in another scene.\\" LA Weekly described it as \\"one of Stephen Schwartz's awful songs\\".

Targeted at predominantly Singaporean Chinese, the campaign tied in with the shutting down or relocation of all pig farms in the country. The government's initiative was not considerably successful, with mixed reaction from the people. In 2008 it was brought back and subsumed under the Frozen Meat Public Education Programme. Background Singapore once had a burgeoning pork industry, which used to yield S$300,000,000 annually. By 1985, there were at least 520 pig farms situated within the island-state, to keep up with the citizens' demand for fresh pork. Most of the consumers were of Chinese ethnicity. However, Singapore's status as a land-scarce nation could not allow for the sheer number of pig farms and thus in mid-1984 the government began closing down or relocating these farms. Stricter sanitation guidelines were also imposed on the farm owners. By 1990, the number of pig farms in Singapore had already been reduced to 22, with neighbouring country Indonesia supplying the majority of the country's fresh pork. To minimise reliance on overseas imports of fresh pork, the government decided to promote an alternative – frozen pork. Publicity The campaign was officially introduced in November 1984. To promote frozen pork as a healthier and cheaper alternative to fresh pork, island-wide talks on pork were organised and about one million copies of a cookbook dedicated to frozen pork dishes were distributed to the public. Notably, Goh Keng Swee delivered an extensive speech on frozen pork during a parliamentary session in March 1984. Other ad hoc events to promote the campaign included an \\"Eat Frozen Pork\\" poster contest and a \\"roving display\\" of frozen pork. A \\"frozen pork hotline\\" was specially established to give consumers a platform for expressing their thoughts on the frozen meat. The line is now defunct. Reception The campaign received varied response. A survey conducted by The Sunday Times found that a majority of the citizens were not convinced that frozen pork was as delectable as fresh pork, and opined that the difference in price was negligible. A small percentage of those interviewed were indifferent. According to the Singapore Pork Merchants' Association, about seventy percent of the pork-consuming population preferred fresh to frozen pork at the time of the campaign. The Frozen Pork Hotline was deemed a failed project, with virtually nobody calling it. On the other hand, foreign pork merchants from countries including Australia, New Zealand and the United States were very supportive of the campaign as it would help boost their pork sales. In his book Management of Success: The Moulding of Modern Singapore, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies director Kernial Singh Sandhu wrote that the campaign was \\"one of the most insensitive national campaigns to be held\\" and expressed relief that it was \\"short-lived\\". Other publications, such as Metropolis Now!, Asiaweek and Traveller, have made facetious statements regarding the campaign. Revival The campaign to favour frozen pork over fresh pork was revivified in February 2008 and subsumed under the Frozen Meat Public Education Programme, or \\"Eat Well For Less, Choose Frozen Meat\\", an effort by the Agri- Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) to raise awareness on frozen meats in general. Since the retooled campaign's introduction, frozen pork sales at various supermarkets have increased significantly and as of September 2013, national frozen pork consumption has risen by approximately .

History Travoys Arriving with Wounded at a Dressing-Station at Smol, Macedonia, September 1916 by Stanley Spencer The artworks commissioned for the Hall of Remembrance were to be devoted to 'fighting subjects, home subjects and the war at sea and in the air' and were to be displayed in a specially built structure. The building was to be designed to accommodate a series of paintings based upon the dimensions of the large triptych, The Battle of San Romano by Paolo Uccello, one part of which is now in the National Gallery. The scheme was initiated by Lord Beaverbrook, the then Minister of Information and echoed the scale of a war art programme he had launched for the government of Canada. Although the architect Charles Holden completed a design for the building, the plan was abandoned and those artworks that had been completed, along with works donated by Muirhead Bone, William Orpen and Sir John Lavery were incorporated into the art collection that was part of the establishment of the Imperial War Museum. Although Holden's plans for the building have been lost, Muirhead Bone described the structure as a \\"kind of Pavilion\\", surrounded by a garden, with a main gallery leading to an oratory with a dedication to the \\"coming Brotherhood of Man for which we all pray.\\" The centre piece of the Hall were to be four 'super-pictures', each 20 feet long by 7 feet high and each on the theme of cooperation between Britain and its various allies. William Orpen was offered the commission for the Britain and its Italian allies picture but refused, as he did not want to leave the Western Front for a trip to Italy. Augustus John accepted the commission to produce the Anglo-French super- picture but the painting, Junction of Our Lines with the French never materialised. John Singer Sargent was tasked with depicting Anglo-American cooperation but failed to find an appropriate scene whilst visiting the Somme and instead presented the picture known as Gassed.

The jurisdiction of the parish is as follows: Santolan (North), Marikina River (West), Maybunga San Miguel (South), Cainta, Rizal (East). The church enshrines the 19th century Virgin Mary, said to be different among others, for she has a moon underneath her feet. The parish is one of the three other parishes in the Diocese of Pasig that has been granted the special papal blessing to mark its Jubilee Year in connection with its 50th anniversary. History of the parish =Early years= Fr. Victor de Clerck built the first chapel at the site in 1955. During those times, farming and clay-pot making were the residents' primary means of livelihood. The number of residents increased and the mode of living changed when new factories and residential subdivisions were constructed. =1963–1967= On February 23, 1963, the late Archbishop of Manila, His Excellency Rufino Cardinal Santos created a decree that erected the Parish of Santo Rosario de Pasig and separated it from the Immaculate Conception Parish. It was in the same year when Fr. Vicente M. Planta was installed as its first Parish Priest. He led the formation of different organizations like Legion of Mary, Catholic Women’s League, Young Christian Workers and other groups. He stayed at the Philippine Orthopedic Center now National Orthopedic Hospital, since there was no rectory at that time. In 1965, the Archdiocese of Manila bought 2,000 square meters of lot. Two hectares of it was donated to the parishes of Cainta and Sto. Rosario for agricultural purposes. =1967–1979= Fr. Teodoro Perez was installed as the new Parish Priest in 1967. There was still no rectory, so he stayed at the Immaculate Concepcion Parish in Pasig for half a year. On February 10, 1967, a new church and convent were built after selling the lot acquired from the Immaculate Concepcion Parish in Pasig, fund-raising, and participation of the Pastoral Council under Sebastian Sandoval. J. Mijares Constructions won the bid to construct it. On October 10, 1970, the first mass was held under the supervision of the Parish Council headed by Oscar F. Zapanta. The late Archbishop of Manila, Rufino Cardinal Santos blessed the church on February 29, 1971 under the Patronage of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary. The feast day is celebrated on a Sunday closest to October 7. Renovations =1987–1991= A 3-storey building beside the church was completed under Rev. Fr. Julio Cesar M. Manalo's tenure as a Parish Priest. =1991–1996= The Blessed Sacrament Chapel was constructed and blessed by Bishop Protacio G. Gungon on September 4, 1992. The church's facade was improved by the Adoracion Nocturna Filipina - Rosario Chapter. Church repainting was also done. =1996–2000= The altar was repainted and the entire church and rectory were remodelled. Architecture of the Present Church The church has undergone a lot of renovations. At present, it is a modernized structure with art deco design. Walls are made of concrete. The church has a high ceiling that promotes ventilation and steel framing to support its structure. Since it is well- lighted, it doesn't need artificial lighting at daytime. Stained glass is used for the windows. Pilgrim Church Sto. Rosario de Pasig was declared a Pilgrim Church by Pope Francis in a papal decree dated April 17, 2013 to mark its 50th anniversary and to celebrate the Jubilee year which will end on October 7, 2014. The Church's Jubilee Door is symbolic of the entrance of the pilgrims to the historic Jubilee Year. The other three Pilgrim Churches covered by the Pasig diocese are the Shrine of Saint Anne in Santa Ana, Taguig; Parish of Santo Tomas de Villanueva in Santolan, Pasig; and Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Parish in Lower Bicutan, Taguig.

Joe Francis Doerr is an Austin, Texas-based singer-songwriter and poet.  Career  A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Doerr moved to Austin, Texas in 1983 to join The LeRoi Brothers, a roots-rock band formed by Mike Buck, Don Leady, Alex Napier, and Doerr's older brother Steve. Doerr, whose spirited performing style caught the attention of \\"The Dean of American Rock Critics\\" Robert Christgau, appeared on several records with The LeRoi Brothers including the Columbia Records EP \\"Forget About the Danger, Think of the Fun.\\" Doerr also toured extensively with the band throughout Europe and the US and gave a memorable performance on Austin City Limits before leaving the group in 1986 to pursue other interests. In 2005, Doerr rejoined The LeRoi Brothers and has continued to perform with the band to the present. In March 2014, Doerr and the other LeRoi Brothers band members were inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame. In 1986, Doerr formed the alternative band Ballad Shambles with long-time collaborator and guitarist Bill Anderson (formerly of The Meat Purveyors), bassist Michael Maye (with whom Doerr appears on the Grammy-nominated \\"Big Guitars from Texas\\"), and drummer Stan Moore (formerly of Zakary Thaks). The band released one studio EP with Skyclad Records. When Ballad Shambles disbanded in 1988, Doerr and Anderson formed Hand of Glory with bassist Tim Swingle and drummer Mike Navarro. Hand of Glory released two studio LPs and a single, \\"Like a Nightmare,\\" recorded live in Berlin on the Skyclad label before disbanding in 1992. Exhausted by incessant touring, Doerr became temporarily disillusioned with the music scene; he returned to academe, having dropped out of St. Louis University in 1982. He graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 1995 with a BA in English and entered graduate school at The University of Notre Dame in 1996. Doerr earned three degrees in seven years at Notre Dame: an MFA (Creative Writing, Poetry), an MA (English), and a Ph.D. (English). In 2003, he returned to Austin where he now resides with his wife, Mary. Doerr is the author of 2016's praiseworthy collection of poetry and lyrics Tocayo: New & Selected Poems & Songs, Order of the Ordinary(a well-received collection of poems published by Salt Publishing), and the editor of the Salt Companion to John Matthias, a favorably reviewed collection of essays on Matthias's later work. Doerr's literary criticism, reviews, and articles have appeared in a number of publications, including The Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century, in which Doerr writes extensively on John Ashberry, Robert Creeley, and the New Formalism movement in American poetry. In addition to his reputation as a scholar of American poetry, Doerr has achieved international (primarily British) literary renown (see, for example, his work in Poetry Nation Review and Stand). In recent years, various anthologists have chosen to include Doerr's work in memorable collections such as The Open Light: Poets from Notre Dame, 1991–2008, and The Possibility of Language: Seven New Poets. Since 2006, Doerr has taught writing at St. Edward's University in Austin. In 2007, Doerr began collaborating again with Bill Anderson. Together with Julien Peterson (drums), Adam Kahan (bass), and Billysteve Korpi (guitar), Anderson and Doerr formed the poetry-driven, alternative blues-rock band Churchwood, a project to which Doerr contributes by writing music and lyrics, and providing vocal performances. Churchwood signed with the San Antonio, Texas-based Saustex Media label in 2010 and to date has released four LPs and an EP with Saustex.

Confederate Colonels, University of Missouri Press, 2008. p. 294 Civil War Olmstead was appointed major of the 1st Georgia Infantry Regiment on May 27, 1861. During this time the colonel of his regiment was Hugh W. Mercer. He was placed in command of Fort Pulaski, after Georgia militia captured the fort on January 6, 1861. In November 1861, Olmstead had an estimated 385 men and 48 cannons to protect it. After a siege and bombardment, Olmstead surrendered the fortress on April 11, 1862 and was a prisoner for several months. Afterwards, Olmstead continued to lead his regiment along the Carolina and Georgia Coast. He participated in the Siege of Battery Wagner while commanding a mixed force from his own 1st (Mercer-Olmstead) Georgia Infantry and the 12th Georgia Artillery Battalion. He then returned to Savannah until the Atlanta Campaign. He and his regiment were sent north to Atlanta as part of Mercer's Brigade and participated in the Battle of Atlanta. He soon found himself and his regiment under the command of Brigadier General James Argyle Smith in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. At times during this campaign he commanded the whole brigade. He then fought at the Battle of Franklin and the Battle of Nashville. Afterwards he participated in the Carolinas Campaign and fought at the Battle of Bentonville before surrendering at Bennet's Place.

It is quite a small Gothic building which was built beside the monastery of Servites. The church is dedicated to the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary. The church and the monastery have been listed as historical monuments since 1958. The church was founded 24 March 1360 by Charles IV. and was built between 1360 and 1375. Its current look is mostly in pseudo-Gothic.  Naming  The oldest naming for this church and the whole monastery is \\"in viridi\\" (on green). The naming was later changed to \\"on the little grass\\", probably due to the green grasslands in the valley of Botič creek, where the church was founded. In the Middle Ages the church and the monastery were called, like the adjoining stream, simply \\"Botič\\". Today's usual naming \\"Na Slupi\\" has its origin in the 16th century and it is deduced from \\"slup\\" – tanks for fish which were placed in the Botič.  History  The order of Servites or the order of servants of the Virgin Mary was created in the 13th century and their goal was unlimited respect to the Virgin Mary. According to tradition the apparition happened in 1233 on the day of Ascension. The apparition influenced the seven Florentines who gave up their existing lives and went to Monte Senario where they founded a monastery. The Servite Order showed up in Prague for the first time in 1360. = The period of Charles IV = The legend says that King Charles IV promised in front of the painting in the Florentine monastery of Servites that he would build a monastery for this order in the Czech lands as thanks for his cure. Another possible impulse for founding the monastery could have been an effort to reinforce the deteriorating religious life in Bohemia and above all in Prague in the second half of the 14th century. Charles IV asked pope Innocent VI for permission to set up a new monastery in Prague in 1359 and was granted permission. The monastery was founded in 1360 and the construction of the church started immediately. According to Beneš of Weitmile (the chronicler) the church was established next to the older chapel of the Virgin Mary. = Period of Hussite Wars = During the Hussite period the monastery was robbed by Prague's citizens in 1420 and probably also burnt down. The monks from the monastery were probably in exile at that time. The monastery Na Slupi was between the two fighting sides and on 15 September 1420 the inhabitants of Prague built two big catapults near the choir of the monastery church. Both weapons were destroyed by the defenders. Then the inhabitants of Prague broke through the southern wall, they put a big cannon in the nave of the church and were able to aim directly at besieging the royal garrison in Vyšehrad. For this reason, the nave was newly vaulted in the late-Gothic period (it is estimated that the vaulting was constructed from 1436 to 1480). The Servites probably returned to the monastery shortly after the ending of Hussite Wars which is obvious from documented financial gift to the monastery in 1439. The repair of the church took place after 1480. It was mostly financed by financial support of various donors. The citizen of the New Town Mikuláš Replík had donated a bell to the church although this bell was removed from the belfry by the parishioners of the Church of Saint Adalbert. And they placed the bell to their church. Through the numerous donations the monastery was very poor and around 1480 the monks left it. Then monastery passed to the royal holding. The monks from the Church of Saint Adalbert bought a new bell to the church Na Slupi in 1498. The church was at that time represented by Švábs from Chvatlin, Duchk and Mikuláš. Their symbol is visible at the keystone of the vault inside the church. The monastery was still very poor. The building was half ruined and in 1554 the last prior, and at that time the only monk in monastery, Ondřej Bergmann, wrote a letter to the abbot in Karlov where he entrusted himself and the church under his protection. The abbot of Augustinian order agreed with this proposal. = The period after the Battle of White Mountain = The next fate of the monastery and other buildings is not clear. The Church of Our Lady on the Lawn continued to be in the holding of the church in Karlov. Servites had a considerable influence at Vienna court which they used after the Battle of White Mountain to get means for renewal the monastery. The monastery returned to the order in 1626. Three monks settled in the monastery which was subordinated to Servites monastery of Saint Michal in the Old Town. The unstable period around the year 1648 did not allowed bigger construction works in monastery. There were made only the most urgent repairs. It was decided about the reconstruction after the general prior of the order visited the monastery. The reparation took place several years later during the 1760s. Seventeen monks lived in the monastery in 1710. The reconstruction of the buildings finished in 1726. The Servites's highlighting period was on the beginning of the 18th century. The number of supporters and donors was growing. The monastery bought near so called Dlouhoveský house with chapel in 1707, which the monastery afterwards sold to establish the convent of Alžbětinky. = The Age of Enlightenment = The monastery was seriously damaged by bombs during the Seven Years' War in 1757. There was general resentment toward the European monastic life in the following period of the Age of Enlightenment. The New Town and the Old Town monasteries were merged in 1783. The Servite order was cancelled on 23. 6. 1786. The Church of Our Lady on the Lawn was secularized in 1783. The monastery became an artillery barracks in the years 1785 – 1792, then it was a lodging house and then it became a military educational institute in the years 1822-1850. = 19th century = The monastery was enlarged and rebuilt in 1856 in order to place there the institute of mentally ill. The church was sanctified again in 1856. The architect and the historian of the art Bernard Grueber (1806-1882) was in charge of numerous pseudo-gothic repairs. The repairs took place in the years 1858-1863 (another source states years 1856-58). The two-storied building of the former monastery is known in this pseudo-gothic form. The monastery was rebuilt in 1910 and currently there is located the Skin Clinic of the Charles University. A big part of the current look of the church can be attributed to Grueber, including the internal furnishing of the church in the pseudo-gothic style. There was built choir and low roof of the presbytery was raised. Grueber also designed the new interior, such as the altar partition, doors, altars, pulpit, candlesticks and monstrance. The last major reconstruction of the church was in years 1914-1916 when the inner plastering was replaced with the brickwork. The reconstruction was directed by the builder František Schlaffer.  The Equipment of the church  The church was filled with baroque furniture during the 18th century and it received new altar in 1732. After cancelling the Servites Order in Prague and unhollying the church its artistic inventor had been spread. The monastery has received some paintings and sculptures, four of them we can still see in their church. We can see a copy of Florentine painting Annunciation Virgin Mary in the monastery. The equipment in the church comes from the period of the architect Bernard Grueber and it is mostly in the pseudo-gothic style. There is a painting of Annunciation Virgin Mary on the main altar from 1857 by Leopold Kupelwieser. There are two side altars on the sides of victory arch, the altar of Saint Anna on the south wall and the altar of Saint Joseph on the north wall. The organs and holly water font are from Grueber's workshop. = Gravestones = There are several gravestones in the church. The gravestone behind the altar bears the name Jan Petr Dejma from Střítěž. There is a sunken ledger in the choir which covers a tomb of Servites. There is a gravestone in the nave which bears name of baron Schönebeck. There is a gravestone of Magdalena Premerová under the choir on the north wall and there is a gravestone of Marie Jakobína Schadnerová on the south wall.  The Architecture  The orientation of the church is traditional, the altar is oriented to the east. The main nave of the church does not have completely dominate position and there is not a trial for monumentality and strong verticalization which is typical for the earlier period of gothic. The original parts of the church come from the period of the Caroline gothic and this church is an illustration of diversity and variety of New Town's religious architecture of that time. The shield of the nave significantly exceeds the roof of the choir. The west facade is rather plain and a third of the facade occupies a prismatic four-sided tower. Almost a whole north side of the church is hidden by the buildings of the former monastery. = Parts of the church = The church consists of three parts: choir, nave and tower. The choir consists of one vault field and five-sided closing. The ground plan of the nave is almost a square, just like the ground plan of the tower which stands in the axis of west facade of the church. = The windows = There are slender pointed windows with new tracery between the rests, simple window in the end of choir, the north window is immured and the south window is two part with new flame tracery. The original bevelled mouldings are preserved only in the end of church, otherwise they are covered with plaster. There were penetrated new portals in the western half of the nave. The portals have pointed arch with pinnacles on the sides. The current look of the portals was created by the architect Grueber. = The interior = The size of the nave is 9, 5 x 9, 65 x 12 metres. The choir was built in the pseudo-gothic style together with a noticeable renewed ledge along the choir. The rounded vault supports run out from the ledge. There are consoles from modern period under the ledge. The supports have calyx-shaped capitals and they are covered with carved grapevine and cabbage leaves. There are linden leaves on the supports too. = The keystones = The keystone in the choir ending bears a board with a relief of the Czech lion. There are family signs and a shield which depicts a hand with two open fingers on the keystones in the eastern part. There is stylized rosette and a sign of family Šváby from Chvatliny on the keystones in the west part. The sign represents a gate between two towers with battlements where is a standing sheep. The frontal arcs have grooved profile. = The main nave = The main nave space is unique because it is vaulted on the single middle slender cylindrical pillar which supports the vault. The pillar has a cylindrical pedestal, simple base and small ring in the upper part. The vault ribs are connected to the pillar through small corbels. The main nave is almost a square. The both west square fields have a cross-ribbed vault. = The choir = There is a pseudo-gothic entrance to the sacristy on the northern side of the choir ending. The sacristy is rectangular and it is arched with barrel vault. The choir is arched with one rectangular field with cross-ribbed vault in front and with radial vault at the end. There are simple ribs in the choir. We can find pseudo gothic pulpit in the southwest corner and also pseudo-gothic oratory in the west part of the church. The oratory is accessible from the first floor through the wide arcade. There is an entrance and a new spiral stairs to the tower in the west wall. The entrance to the chapel was built in the 19th century and it is under the oratory. = Exterior = The outer layout of the nave is similar to the choir, on the three loose corners there are supports put up diagonally. = The tower = There is a slim tower in the front facade which has height 38 metres. The tower has in its lower part a shape of four- sided prism. There are two ledges, the first one is in the height of the ledge which is placed under the windows of the nave and the second one in the height of the main ledge of the nave. The tower continues with another narrowed floor and with pointed arch. This part of the tower has three floors of various heights. Above the second ledge there is another eight-sided part with two little windows with pointed arches. The thickness of the brickwork is around 80 centimetres. The Baroque onion-domed roof was replaced by Grueber with the pyramidal roof which is there up to now. This tower is unique among all of the Prague towers because its diversion from the vertical is 63 centimetres towards the street Na Slupi. Both of the shields of the nave have the panelling from restoration in the 19th century. There is nothing left from the gothic monastery and current appearance of the buildings of the former monastery is determined by the modification in the 19th century.  Curiosities  The position of the significant buildings built in times of Charles IV. is supposedly determined by celestial symbolism and Christian mysticism. Five churches founded by Charles IV. create regular cross. Cross of the buildings meant a special blessing to the town in the Middle Ages.

It utilizes a proprietary framework to apply \\"schemes\\" to the Macintosh GUI, long before Apple released the Appearance Manager system with Mac OS 8 (later updated in Mac OS 8.5, providing similar functionality using \\"themes\\"). Whereas only a few Appearance Manager themes were ever developed, tens of thousands of Kaleidoscope schemes were developed. History When theme support in the Appearance Control Panel was first announced, the team responsible for it demonstrated an automatic tool specifically designed to convert existing Kaleidoscope scheme files into Appearance Manager-compatible theme files. This tool was never released to the public. Kaleidoscope remained the primary theme platform, even after the Appearance Control Panel offered theme capabilities in Mac OS 8.5. Steve Jobs returned to Apple just before the release of Mac OS 8.5, and he officially discontinued support for themes in order to force a consistent user interface. Because of this, Apple released little documentation for the theme format, withheld its own beta-released themes, and even issued a cease and desist notice to the authors of a third-party theme editor on grounds that it was intended to allow users to create themes that imitate the Aqua interface in Mac OS X. At the same time, the format of Kaleidoscope schemes continued to evolve. As a result, Kaleidoscope schemes proliferated while Appearance themes never really did. Kaleidoscope was only rendered obsolete with the transition to Mac OS X, with which Kaleidoscope is not compatible.

It sells ready-to-assemble furniture and fully assembled furniture in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.  History  South Shore Furniture was founded by Eugène Laflamme in 1940. The company was incorporated in Quebec under the name Les Industries de la Rive Sud Ltée. During the 1960s and 1970s, it grew larger through furniture company purchases. South Shore purchased two Quebec companies: Laurierville-based Morrissette & frères and in 1978 Coaticook-based J.W. Kilgour Ltd. David W. Conklin's 1994 case study noted that South Shore was able to purchase better equipment and enlarge its factories by relying on only its profits instead of outside investment, so it was not affected by monetary difficulties arising from the stock market's drop or the Quebec Stock Savings Plan. In 1970, Eugène Laflamme's son, Guy Laflamme, became managing director. By the 1990s, South Shore faced \\"Buy American\\" feelings from consumers, lessening the number of exports it could make to the United States. By the late 2000s, South Shore stopped selling its products to American stores and instead starting selling products to Americans online. The reasons were threefold: expensive transportation expenses, the Canadian dollar reaching equal value with the American dollar, and Chinese businesses that made South Shore's products less competitive. In 2008, South Shore began selling products on the Internet through websites of companies including Amazon, Walmart, and Target. In 2012, 70% of the company goods were sold in the United States. South Shore sells its furniture in Canada both online and through retailers such as Tanguay and Brault & Martineau. In 1999, Jean Laflamme, the grandson of the founder Eugène Laflamme and son of the previous owner Guy Laflamme, took over the company. During the global financial crisis, CEO Jean Laflamme in 2007 closed South Shore's Laurierville factory whose 120 workers were laid off. The company's workforce dropped to 650 during the worst of the crisis. The company announced a rebranding during its 70th anniversary year in 2010. It decided to start going by only its English name, South Shore Furniture. In the past, it had gone by names in two other languages: Les Industries de la Rive Sud (French) and Meubles Rive Sud (Spanish). The company makes 850 kinds of products. In 2016, South Shore has 850 employees working in two Quebec factories, a Juárez, Mexico factory, and an El Paso, Texas distribution center. The company ships roughly 4,000 furniture pieces every day and during peak times ships 10,000. A 2016 article in La Presse noted that the company's weaknesses included costly investments and a hard time recruiting employees, particularly those in the computer science and new media fields.

Production Los tres berretines was directed by Enrique Telémaco Susini and starring the local actors Luis Sandrini and Luisa Vehil. The American cinematographer John Alton was not credited but may have played an important role in direction and cinematography. Los tres berretines was based on a hit play of the same name, in which the circus performer and actor Luis Sandrini played Eusebio, a brother with a dream of becoming a famous tango composer. Lumiton expanded his role in the film version. Los tres berretines was released on 19 May 1933 in the Ástor in Buenos Aires. It was the second Argentine film with an optical soundtrack. The first was ¡Tango!, released the week before. Synopsis The film has traditional popular melodrama plot elements, and includes performances of tango songs. It depicts a family whose members are obsessed with the three national berretines (interests or hobbies) of tango, football and cinema. (In the play the last berretín was radio.). The family is middle class and makes its living from a hardware store. The father complains that the hobbies lead the family to neglect business. In the end, the father himself succumbs to all three hobbies. Reception The film, which cost 18,000 pesos to produce, earned over one million.

Turner's English Opera Company Life and career Nothing is known of Bovill's life; the musicologist Kurt Gänzl found that his dates are consistent with a fish sauce and pickle merchant of the same name from Harrow, London, but that person consistently identified his career as \\"merchant\\" during the period when Bovill was professionally engaged in opera.Gänzl, Kurt. \\"The third wish: or, Pish Tush Bah!\\", Kurt Gänzl's blog, 26 April 2018 =The Mikado= As Pish-Tush in The Mikado (1885) In the original production of The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre (1885–1887), Bovill joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, where he originated the supporting role of the Japanese nobleman Pish-Tush.Stone, David. \\"Frederick Bovill\\", Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 August 2001, accessed 24 May 2018 As part of the role, it was intended that Bovill should sing the bottom line in the madrigal \\"Brightly dawns our wedding day\\", which includes a bottom F. Bovill, however, was unable to produce this note with sufficient sonority, so shortly after the opera premiered, the character of Go-To, another \\"Noble Lord\\", was created to sing the bass line in this number (and to speak an introductory line of dialogue); Rudolph Lewis was cast in this role, while Bovill continued to play the rest of the role of Pish-Tush throughout the run.Ainger, Michael. Gilbert and Sullivan: A Dual Biography, Oxford University Press (2002), p. 245 The critic of the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News commented: \\"Mr. Frederick Bouvill (sic) is a trifle heavy as Pish Tush, but has a very good voice and knows how to make use of it\\". The Theatre stated: \\"Mr. Bovill (the other recruit) proved an excellent representative of the \\"general utility\\" noble Lord, Pish-Tush. This gentleman possesses a fine mellow voice, which he produces very agreeably, and is in all respects an acquisition to the Savoy company.\\"Our Musical-Box\\", The Theatre, 1 April 1885, pp. 186–190 In another review later in the run of the show, the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News said, \\"Mr. Frederic Bovill cannot boast a very long professional career. After some experience as an amateur he made his debut in The Mikado, taking the part of the Noble Lord Pish-Tush. Without a very great deal to do, he makes the best of his part, and his excellent voice and artistic singing are heard to advantage.\\"Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, 4 July 1885, p. 4 =Later roles= As Pish-Tush in The Mikado (1885) In Gilbert and Sullivan's next production, Ruddigore, there was only one principal lyric baritone role in the cast, and Bovill was released from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.\\"Dramatic Gossip\\", West Coast Times, Issue 6416, 14 February 1887, p. 2 From 1887 to 1889 Bovill was on a tour of the British provinces with J.

Early life White was born in Bristol, England, during the English Civil War and was the son of a merchant trader. White gained his Master's Certificate and set sail for India in 1670. He used his or his family's ship and took up residence in Fort St George, Madras (now Chennai). India When White arrived in the Far East, he was not employed by the East India Company but worked as a coastal trader supplying and transporting goods from as far as the Persian Gulf. This appears to have been acceptable to the Company, though he was regarded as an \\"interloper\\". The laws of the charter given to the Company provided that any English ships trading between the East of India and England might be seized and fined £1000. However, since White was working on coastal trade, he was not subject to the penalty and developed an acceptable working relationship with the Company. Siam On White's outward journey east of India, he employed a Greek man named Constantine Phaulkon as his assistant. Phaulkon had left his native country at a young age and had worked on several ships of different nationalities. He was a gifted linguist and very bright. White and Phaulkon worked together in Siam, where Phaulkon rose, in time, to be the first Minister to the Court of King Narai of Siam. White was recommended to the East India Company for his knowledge of the trade in India by Richard Barnaby, the Head of the Company factor (factory) in Madras. The two went on to be good friends and trading partners. In 1676, whilst White was living in Ayutthaya, the capital of Siam, his wife left their mansion in Fort St. George and joined him there. In 1681, the Siamese Court ordered the forfeiture of White's house and factor that he administered for the East India Company. The order was made due to non-payment of rent on his house. White had refused to pay as this was not in the original agreement. Barnaby, being worried for White's safety, sent three armed Englishmen to protect him. This astonished White, as he was quite happy and felt that he could handle the situation. The Company paid the debts owed and his stocks were released. In 1681, the Dutch merchant Van Vliet accused White of lending Phaulkon a considerable amount of money which belonged to the Company. The evidence for this was destroyed in the fire which caused the factor to burn down. Barnaby, who had been at the factor a few days before the fire had accused a Mr. Potts for his negligence, as Potts had tried to implicate White. Both White and Barnaby left Siam in 1681. Return to India White later went into a joint venture with Potts and Barnaby. It is believed that White had a coloured servant who served Mr. Strangh and a Mr. Yale in 1683 on their trip to India. They had been sent from London with letters of authority to investigate the Company's affairs in India. They had the power to allow it to continue or order it to cease trading. Return to England White returned from India in 1681, sailing in his own ship, the Phoenix. Thomas Povey sent a letter of introduction to Sir Robert Southwell, stating that White had returned from the East as a well-educated man of the world, being truly worthy of his patronage, and regretting the losses to George White and his brother Samuel, which may have been more than £40,000. Samuel White George White's younger brother, Samuel \\"Siamese\\" White, was a notorious trader in the Far East. With the recommendation of Constantine Phaulkon, Samuel became the administrator of the port of Mergui (now part of Burma). Through Samuel's mishandling and greed, he was responsible, in 1687, for the uprising in Mergui and the subsequent slaughter of 87 Englishmen. George White and Thomas Povey, who was the brother of Mary Povey the late wife of Samuel White, were appointed Samuel White's attorney and guardian to his two daughters, Mary White (b. 1680, d. 1716) \\"who married John Wittewronge 1673–1722\\" and Susan White, (b. 1677), who \\"married John Gumley 1673–1722\\". Money was sent home and they were to purchase landed estates on behalf of their wards in case he did not survive or, if he did, he would live the life of a country gentleman. Samuel White died after returning to England on 7 January 1689. George White and Francis Heath were appointed the executors of Samuel White's will. In 1689 George White pursued the East India Company over the seizure of £40,000 of Samuel White's assets and answered charges brought by a Francis Davenport, who had stated that Samuel White had acted illegally and had seized the Company's goods as well as imprisoned their employees. White sent a paper to Parliament answering an earlier paper written by Francis Davenport and the East India Company; this case was settled by the Company out of court. Opposition to East India Company Between 1687 and 1691, while living in London, White vigorously opposed the East India Company (at that time governed by Sir Josiah Child), which had enforced a monopoly in the East; White then sent a petition to Parliament on behalf of his brother Samuel White and several members of parliament. In his book The Company-State: Corporate Sovereignty and the Early Modern Foundations of the British Empire in India, Philip J Stern relates Macaulay's observations that \\"Sir Josiah Child was likened to every villain imaginable – Oliver Cromwell, Louis XIV, Goliath and Satan\\", and who was tarred as the \\"Despot on Leadenhall Street\\". This shows the depth of feeling against the Company. The war with Siam does not seem to be the main factor in the Company's charter being withdrawn, but the imposition of martial law and infliction of capital punishment that was enacted in response to the unrest that had broken out in St Helena. George White became a member of parliament at this time. This enabled him to lobby fellow MPs in aid of his cause.Soren Mentz The English Gentlemen Merchants at work (Madras and the City of London) In 1691, White wrote and published a pamphlet titled \\"An account of the trade to the East Indies\\"; this was very well received, translated into Dutch, and was still being reprinted one hundred years later. George White also wrote that during the period 1675 to 1683 (why he chose this period it is not clear) but over these 9 years he had the East India Company shipping out some four and a half million in silver and gold bullion, though he does not differentiate between the amount of company and that privately. It is thought that George White gleaned this information from the company’s accounts as he would have had access to them as was his right as a shareholder, a right the East India Company on numerous occasions tried to restrict. Kirti N. Chaudhuri a historian that had access to the East India Company accounts came to the conclusion that the East India Company had exported in the period set out by George White (1675-1683) the amount of £3,544,750 this leaving some £955,280 being exported privately. Final return to India In 1694, Parliament passed a law stating that any Englishman could trade in India or China so long as he has not been barred from doing so by Parliament. George White took full advantage of this and set sail for the East. However, upon arrival he found that what was law in England was still treason in India. He left his ship and travelled overland to Surat, where he learnt that his ship and cargo had been sold to the Company by his principals. To make matters worse, he had to plead that he was a servant of the Company to save himself from prison. Shortly after this, he departed from India, never to return. =Reformed East India Company= In 1698, George White was one of the leading forces behind the setting up of a rival company known as the \\"English Company Trading to East India\\", which was initially financed under a state backed indemnity of £2 million. George White was part of the new company's Court of Directors, which had the responsibility of deciding on the rules for new directors, each new director having to put up the sum of £2000, without interest, as well as being approved by the existing directors. This new company could not compete with the old East India Company as powerful directors of the original that company took out shares in the new company, in the sum of £315,000, giving them influence on the new company's board. The new company could only gain a small percentage of the trade carried out and, in 1708, finally merged with the original East India Company, in a tripartite indenture involving both of the companies and the state. The amalgamated Company became known as the \\"United Company of Merchants of England Trading in India\\". Under this arrangement, the merged company lent to the Treasury a sum of £3,200,000, in return for exclusive privileges for the next three years, after which the situation was to be reviewed.

It is allegedly one of the oldest churches in the country, constructed between 1644-1650 during the Spanish colonial period. The façade and tower of the present church is Modern. History Bacoco, site of the first town Banton was first mentioned in history when it was written in the chronicle of Maestre de Campo Martin de Goiti in his voyage to Manila on May 12, 1570 by the instruction of Miguel Lopez de Legaspi that was then resided in the island of Panay. On October 31, 1571, Banton became an encomienda entrusted to encomiendero Don Sebastian y Mena, a Spanish resided in Villa Arevalo in Panay. In 1582, Banton was visited by Miguel de Loarca, who gave a clear view of the island. In his famous book Relacion de Las Islas Filipinas, it was written: “The island is mountainous and almost round in shape planted by coconut trees. There 200 families residing the island. Majority of them are traders…” Barangay Poblacion became the permanent settlement of the town. Banton Church situated in the center Based on the historical accounts of the Augustinian Recollects, Banton was established in 1622 in the hill of Bacoco (now part of Brgy. Hambian) the earliest town established in the Province of Romblon. In 1635, the spiritual administration of the newly established town was entrusted to the Secular Eclessiastics of the Diocese of Cebu as a town annexed to the curacy of Ajui in Panay. Fr. Francisco Rodriguez was assigned as coadjutor priest to Banton and other neighboring islands. Fr. Francisco Rodriguez encountered obstacles administering the inhabitants of Romblon because of the geography of islands, being far from each other, divided by a rough sea that is a passageway for strong typhoons. Because of the seas that are also exposed to frequent incursions and hostile attacks by the Moro pirates, the priest wrote a letter and asked the Prior Provincial Padre Don Jose dela Anunciacion to send a fighting priest that will replaced him. The request of Padre Rodriguez was granted by the decree of the Bishop of Cebu Don Padre de Arce on July 27, 1635 entrusting the evangelization of Romblon Archipelago to the care of the Order of Augustinian Recollects (OAR). Fr. Pedro de San Jose was the first Recollect missionary to step in the soil of Romblon. In the same year 1635, the OAR extended their missionary work to Banton. The missionaries relocated the town from the hill of Bacoco to its present location (Poblacion). The Recollects said: “Although it’s more spacious that its former location, it is still not large enough to accommodate all the number of houses and edifices required by its inhabitants…” =A Fortress Church= Fuerza San Jose According to the historical records of the Recollects, almost immediately after taking on the post of the missionaries, violent attacks were launched in Romblon by the Moros. The savage attacks of the Muslims gravely disrupted the evangelization of the first Recollect mission, Fr. Pedro de San Jose even reaching to the point of driving him to escape in mountains. When Fr. Juan de San Antonio, superior of the Recollects informed about the situation, he was determined and acted decisively to fortify the towns of Romblon and Banton (a task which would be very difficult for the missionary to undertake). The superior assigned Fr. Agustin de San Pedro to the islands to protect the lives of its Christian inhabitants. Fr. Agustin won fame for his heroic actions against the pirates and war exploits in Mindanao, which earned him a title of “EL Padre Capitan”, a famous name in Philippine history. The newly appointed priest immediately began the construction of the churches and forts of the town of Romblon and the church fortress of Banton between the years 1640-1650. Banton Church Interior In Banton, El Padre Capitan constructed first the church and convent then the walls that encircle the complex. In every corner of the walls, he put towers for watching approaching enemies. A deep well and other important facilities were constructed for the needs of the evacuees in case there is a threat of Muslim attacks. To the north of the church, he built a watchtower on the top of Onti Hill that has a commanding view of the entire Sibuyan Sea and the exit points of the vessels from the Port of Romblon as well as the ships going toward the south of the archipelago. Banton Church was dedicated to the patron saint of the parish, Saint Nicholas of Tolentino. The fort was named “Fuerza de San Jose” (Fort San Jose) in honor to Saint Joseph. In 1870, the details and the condition of the fortress church were mentioned in Memoria de Panay: “The fort is in the form of isosceles triangle. The walls measures 111.17 meters long, 2.08 meters thick and 4.58 meters high. On the top of the walls have 12 cannons with different calibers…” Banton Church Retablo Mayor In the field of material achievements, much had been done by the Recollects and the Bantoanons. They reconstructed the church continually due to devastating typhoons that may come and the surprise attacks of Muslims. Because of these, they paid less attention to the artistic designs of the church concentrating more on building them strong enough to hold on against whatever destructive elements to come. In the book Sinopsis Historica, it was written: The accomplishment of El Padre Capitan is truly amazing. At one time, a fleet sailed from Jolo to attack the island of Banton, on its way; the Moros were trying to avoid passing Banton and Romblon in order to avoid a confrontation with the fighting priest. The enemy arrived on the sea craft and under the direction of El Padre Capitan, set on fire eight barges (caracoas) and with the rest of the vessels, successfully destroyed the enemy. This served as warning against future attacks. Since then, Muslim piracy in the island was eradicated. “Due to its location and because of the work of El Padre Capitan, the fortress church of Banton is a real bastion and it would be difficult to find another fort in the archipelago into which so much effort has been poured, for the purpose of depending its inhabitants. The inhabitants themselves are simple folks, actively devoted to the town of their birth and on all occasions, whether in defense against the Moros or thieves, they have always exhibited bravery.” Gallery File:Banton Church 22.JPGBanton Church old bell File:Banton Church 17.JPGcoral stone steps leading to the fort File:Banton Church 12.JPGSan Nicolas de Tolentino Parish logo File:Banton Church Interior 2.JPGBanton Church Interior File:Onti Watchtower.JPGRuins of the Onti Watchtower File:Banton Church 26.JPGRuins of the old convent File:Banton Church 14.JPGBanton Church convent See alsoBanton, Romblon *Banton Island References External links Diocese of Romblon: Diocesan Curia *Blas dela Asuncion, Fidel de,OAR.Labor Evangelica delos Padres Recoletos en las Islas Filipinas Espuesta en Cuadra Estadisticos de la Provincia de San Nicolas de Tolentino.

The Amorites (; Sumerian 𒈥𒌅 MAR.TU; Akkadian Amurrūm or Tidnum; Egyptian Amar; ʼĔmōrī; ) were an ancient Semitic-speaking people from Syria who also occupied large parts of southern Mesopotamia from the 21st century BC to the end of the 17th century BC, where they established several prominent city states in existing locations, such as Isin, Larsa and later notably Babylon, which was raised from a small town to an independent state and a major city. The term Amurru in Akkadian and Sumerian texts refers to both them and to their principal deity. The Amorites are also mentioned in the Bible as inhabitants of Canaan both before and after the conquest of the land under Joshua.  Origin  Terracotta of a couple, probably Inanna and Dumuzi, Girsu, Amorite period, 2000-1600 BC. Louvre Museum AO 16676. In the earliest Sumerian sources concerning the Amorites, beginning about 2400 BC, the land of the Amorites (\\"the Mar.tu land\\") is associated not with Mesopotamia but with the lands to the west of the Euphrates, including Canaan and what was to become Syria by the 3rd century BC, then known as The land of the Amurru, and later as Aram and Eber-Nari. They appear as an uncivilized and nomadic people in early Mesopotamian writings from Sumer, Akkad, and Assyria, especially connected with the mountainous region now called Jebel Bishri in northern Syria called the \\"mountain of the Amorites\\". The ethnic terms Mar.tu (\\"Westerners\\"), Amurru (suggested in 2007 to be derived from aburru, \\"pasture\\") and Amor were used for them in Sumerian, Akkadian, and Ancient Egyptian respectively.ibd, Mattanyah Zohar, \\"Climate Change Environment\\" 2007, p. 178 From the 21st century BC, possibly triggered by a long major drought starting about 2200 BC, a large-scale migration of Amorite tribes infiltrated southern Mesopotamia. They were one of the instruments of the downfall of the Third Dynasty of Ur, and Amorite dynasties not only usurped the long-extant native city-states such as Isin, Larsa, Eshnunna, and Kish, but also established new ones, the most famous of which was to become Babylon, although it was initially a minor insignificant state. Known Amorites wrote in a dialect of Akkadian found on tablets at Mari dating from 1800-1750 BC. Since the language shows northwest Semitic forms, words and constructions, the Amorite language is a Northwest Semitic language, and possibly one of the Canaanite languages. The main sources for the extremely limited knowledge about Amorite are the proper names, not Akkadian in style, that are preserved in such texts. The Akkadian language of the native Semitic states, cities and polities of Mesopotamia (Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia, Isin, Kish, Larsa, Ur, Nippur, Uruk, Eridu, Adab, Akshak, Eshnunna, Nuzi, Ekallatum, etc.), was from the east Semitic, as was the Eblaite of the northern Levant.  History  In the earliest Sumerian texts, all western lands beyond the Euphrates, including the modern Levant, were known as \\"the land of the (Amorites)\\". The term appears in Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, which describes it in the time of Enmerkar as one of the regions inhabited by speakers of a different language. Another text known as Lugalbanda and the Anzud bird describes how, 50 years into Enmerkar's reign, the Martu people arose in Sumer and Akkad (southern Mesopotamia), necessitating the building of a wall to protect Uruk. There are also sparse mentions in tablets from the East Semitic-speaking kingdom of Ebla, dating from 2500 BC to the destruction of the city BC: from the perspective of the Eblaites, the Amorites were a rural group living in the narrow basin of the middle and upper Euphrates in northern Syria.Giorgio Bucellati, \\"Ebla and the Amorites\\", Eblaitica 3 (1992):83-104. For the Akkadian kings of central Mesopotamia was one of the \\"Four Quarters\\" surrounding Akkad, along with Subartu/Assyria, Sumer, and Elam. Naram-Sin of Akkad records successful campaigns against them in northern Syria BC, and his successor, Shar-Kali-Sharri, followed suit. Artifacts from Amorite Kingdom of Mari, 1st half of 2nd millennium BC By the time of the last days of the Third Dynasty of Ur, the immigrating Amorites had become such a force that kings such as Shu-Sin were obliged to construct a wall from the Tigris to the Euphrates to hold them off.William H. Stiebing Jr. Ancient Near Eastern History And Culture Longman: New York, 2003: 79 The Amorites appear as nomadic tribes under chiefs, who forced themselves into lands they needed to graze their herds. Some of the Akkadian literature of this era speaks disparagingly of the Amorites and implies that the Akkadian- and Sumerian-speakers of Mesopotamia viewed their nomadic and primitive way of life with disgust and contempt: \\"They have prepared wheat and gú-nunuz (grain) as a confection, but an Amorite will eat it without even recognizing what it contains!\\"E. Chiera, Sumerian Texts of Varied Contents, Chicago, 1934, No. 3. As the centralized structure of the Third Dynasty slowly collapsed, the component regions, such as Assyria in the north and the city-states of the south such as Isin, Larsa and Eshnunna, began to reassert their former independence, and the areas in southern Mesopotamia with Amorites were no exception. Elsewhere, the armies of Elam, in southern Iran, were attacking and weakening the empire, making it vulnerable. One of the Ramesses III prisoner tiles, speculated by some scholars to represent an Amorite man Many Amorite chieftains in southern Mesopotamia aggressively took advantage of the failing empire to seize power for themselves. There was not an Amorite invasion of southern Mesopotamia as such, but Amorites ascended to power in many locations, especially during the reign of the last king of the Neo-Sumerian Empire, Ibbi-Sin. Leaders with Amorite names assumed power in various places, usurping native Akkadian rulers, including in Isin, Eshnunna and Larsa. The small town of Babylon, unimportant both politically and militarily, was raised to the status of a minor independent city-state, under Sumu-abum in 1894 BC. The Elamites finally sacked Ur in BC. Some time later, the Old Assyrian Empire (1750 BC) became the most powerful entity in Mesopotamia immediately preceding the rise of the Amorite king Hammurabi of Babylon. The new Assyrian monarchic line was founded by BC; their kings repelled attempted Amorite incursions, and may have countered their influence in the south as well under Erishum I, Ilu-shuma and Sargon I. However, even Assyria eventually found its throne usurped by an Amorite in 1809 BC: the last two rulers of the Old Assyrian Empire period, Shamshi-Adad I and Ishme-Dagan, were Amorites who originated in Terqa (now in northeastern Syria). There is a wide range of views regarding the Amorite homeland.Alfred Haldar, Who Were the Amorites (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1971), p. 7 One extreme is the view that /māt amurrim covered the whole area between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean Sea, the Arabian Peninsula included. The most common view is that the “homeland” of the Amorites was a limited area in central Syria identified with the mountainous region of Jebel Bishri.Minna Lönnqvist, Markus Törmä, Kenneth Lönnqvist and Milton Nunez, Jebel Bishri in Focus: Remote sensing, archaeological surveying, mapping and GIS studies of Jebel Bishri in central Syria by the Finnish project SYGIS. BAR International Series 2230. (Oxford: Archaeopress, 2011) Since the Amorite language is closely related to the better-studied Canaanite languages, both being branches of the Northwestern Semitic languages, as opposed to the South Semitic languages found in the Arabian Peninsula, they are usually considered native to the region around Syria and the Transjordan. = Downfall = The era ended in northern Mesopotamia, with the defeat and expulsion of the Amorites and Amorite-dominated Babylonians from Assyria by Puzur-Sin and king Adasi between 1740 and 1735 BC, and in the far south, by the rise of the native Sealand Dynasty BC. The Amorites clung on in a once-more small and weak Babylon until the Hittite sack of Babylon ( BC), which ended the Amorite presence, and brought new ethnic groups, particularly the Kassites, to the forefront in southern Mesopotamia. From the 15th century BC onward, the term Amurru is usually applied to the region extending north of Canaan as far as Kadesh on the Orontes River in northern Syria. After their expulsion from Mesopotamia, the Amorites of Syria came under the domination of first the Hittites and, from the 14th century BC, the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1050). They appear to have been displaced or absorbed by a new wave of semi-nomadic West Semitic- speaking peoples, known collectively as the Ahlamu during the Late Bronze Age collapse. The Arameans rose to be the prominent group amongst the Ahlamu, and from c. 1200 BC on, the Amorites disappeared from the pages of history. From then on, the region that they had inhabited became known as Aram (\\"Aramea\\") and Eber-Nari. = States = In the Levant: * Amurru kingdom * Yamhad * Qatna * Ebla's Third Dynasty In Mesopotamia: * First Babylonian Dynasty * Mari's Lim Dynasty * Apum * Kurda * Andarig * Ṭābetu  Biblical Amorites  Destruction of the Army of the Amorites by Gustave Doré. The term Amorites is used in the Bible to refer to certain highland mountaineers who inhabited the land of Canaan, described in Genesis as descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham (). They are described as a powerful people of great stature \\"like the height of the cedars\\" () who had occupied the land east and west of the Jordan. The height and strength mentioned in Amos 2:9 has led some Christian scholars, including Orville J. Nave, who wrote the Nave's Topical Bible, to refer to the Amorites as \\"giants\\".Nave's Topical Bible: Amorites, Nave, Orville J., Retrieved:2013-03-14 In Deuteronomy, the Amorite king, Og, was described as the last \\"of the remnant of the Rephaim\\" (). The terms Amorite and Canaanite seem to be used more or less interchangeably, Canaan being more general and Amorite a specific component among the Canaanites who inhabited the land. The Biblical Amorites seem to have originally occupied the region stretching from the heights west of the Dead Sea () to Hebron (), embracing \\"all Gilead and all Bashan\\" (), with the Jordan valley on the east of the river (), the land of the \\"two kings of the Amorites\\". Sihon and Og ( and ). Both Sihon and Og were independent kings. The Amorites seem to have been linked to the Jerusalem region, and the Jebusites may have been a subgroup of them (). The southern slopes of the mountains of Judea are called the \\"mount of the Amorites\\" (). The Book of Joshua speaks of the five kings of the Amorites were first defeated with great slaughter by Joshua (). Then, more Amorite kings were defeated at the waters of Merom by Joshua (). It is mentioned that in the days of Samuel, there was peace between them and the Israelites (). The Gibeonites were said to be their descendants, being an offshoot of the Amorites who made a covenant with the Hebrews. When Saul later broke that vow and killed some of the Gibeonites, God is said to have sent a famine to Israel.  Indo-European hypothesis  The view that Amorites were fierce, tall nomads led to an anachronistic theory among some racialist writers in the 19th century that they were a tribe of \\"Aryan\\" warriors who at one point dominated the Israelites. The theory originated with Felix von Luschan, and did fit then- current models of Indo-European migrations; Luschan later abandoned this theory.\\"Are the Jews a Race?\\" by Sigmund Feist in \\"Jews and Race: Writings on Identity and Difference, 1880-1940\\", edited by Mitchell Bryan Hart, UPNE, 2011, p. 88 Houston Stewart Chamberlain claimed that King David and Jesus were both Aryans of Amorite extraction. The argument was repeated by the Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg. Hans Jonas, New York Review of Books, 1981 In reality, however, the Amorites certainly spoke exclusively a Semitic language, followed Semitic religions of the Near East and had distinctly Semitic personal names. Their origins were believed to have been the lands immediately to the west of Mesopotamia, in the Levant (modern Syria), and so they are regarded as one of the Semitic peoples.Who Were the Amorites?, by Alfred Haldar, 1971, Brill ArchiveSemitic Studies, Volume 1, by Alan Kaye, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 1991, p.867The Semitic Languages, by Stefan Weninger, Walter de Gruyter, 23 Dec 2011, p.361  References   Bibliography  E.

It is where AKN’s trunk line (the Hamburg-Altona–Neumünster railway) and the Alster Northern Railway, which are now traversed by AKN lines A1 and A2, meet. In addition, trains on line A3 (the Elmshorn-Barmstedt-Oldesloe railway) begin and end in Ulzburg Süd. The station is located on the western edge of Ulzburg Süd (south), a suburb of Henstedt-Ulzburg. History The station was established in 1953 under the name of Beckershof on the AKN trunk line to connect with the newly built Alster Northern Railway, but it was soon renamed Ulzburg Süd. The station was modernised in the mid-1990s. Since then the trains of the Alster Northern Railway have run mainly on the middle track 2 between the two tracks of the AKN trunk line. Until then, the Alster Northern Railway had a separate platform on the eastern edge of the complex. The connection between the two lines has been significantly facilitated since passengers no longer have to change platform to make changes. From 1976 to 2002 there was a signal box for the lines at this station. It has now been relocated to the AKN operations centre at Kaltenkirchen. A parking area has been built on the site. Structure  The station currently has two island platforms with three tracks. The middle track is accessible from both platforms. South of the platforms there are two sidings, each about 130 m long. Further south there is a curve connecting between Meeschensee station on the Alster Northern Railway and Tanneneck station on the Hamburg- Altona–Neumünster railway. It is used for freight trains running between Eidelstedt and the Norderstedt industrial railway. Operations  Every weekday about 300 passenger trains stop in Ulzburg Süd. The through trains of the AKN trunk line (A1) as a rule stop on the two outer tracks 1 and 3 and the middle track 2 is used by trains on line A2. The timetable allows for direct connections between the two lines with a transition time of 1 to 2 minutes. A3 services begin and end mostly on platform track 3, but on weekends and public holidays platform track 2 is usually used. Through trains on line A2 from Norderstedt Mitte towards Kaltenkirchen also stop on platform track 3. The bus stop A Ulzburg Süd on line 293 has been located directly next the station since December 2009.

Achilles Fang wrote that it is considered \\"one of the most articulate treatises on Chinese poetics. The extent of its influence in Chinese literary history is equaled only by that of the sixth-century The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons of Liu Xie. It is called a \\"hymn of praise for the craft and art of writing and a specific, prescriptive handbook for the writer.\\"  Form and philosophy  Stephen Owen explains that Wen fu is a work of \\"both literature and literary thought\\", \\"a work of such originality that it could not have been anticipated from the works that preceded it.... nothing like it ever had been written concerning literature...\\" The work introduced new vocabulary of terms which remain influential, although in many cases, problematic. Moving away from questions such as the ethical purpose of literature, its social context, or the expression of personality, Lu Ji turns to the Neo-Taoist theory of mind and its cosmological basis. This philosophical stance describes the poet's mind as wandering through the microcosmos which is within his own body in search of encounters which form the origin of literary work. The fu as a poetic form was known for its verbal display, usually cataloging and listing an array of items in order to say everything that could be said on a topic. Lu presents this philosophical stance in a series of balanced elements which unfold in an orderly way. For instance, Lu balances what the poet learns from thinking against what is learned from reading. These antithetical elements are then amplified and repeated in different contexts, often with statements and counter-statements in order to avoid being one-sided. The Wen-fu is rhymed, but does not employ regular rhythmic patterns: hence the term \\"rhymeprose\\".

Located along Billionaires' Row on 57th Street near Sixth Avenue, the development consists of the original landmarked Steinway Building designed in 1925 by Warren & Wetmore and a new tower by SHoP Architects. When completed, the tower will be one of the tallest buildings in the United States, as well as the thinnest skyscraper in the world with a width-to-height ratio of about 1:23 or 1:24. The north side of the tower rises directly up to the pinnacle of the building. On the south side of the tower, a series of setbacks appear as the tower rises, thinning out as the height of the building increases. Since beginning construction in early 2014, the development has faced significant challenges including union protests, multiple lawsuits from a former equity partner, a foreclosure, and the indictment of the project's general contractor for fraud, withholding wages, and using undocumented immigrant labor. After significant cost overruns and delays, the tower's concrete form topped-out in April 2019, with full completion of its pinnacle expected by the end of 2020.

Prior to the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Starwood Capital reportedly planned to construct a new hotel tower for sister company Starwood as part of a new \\"Hotel Crillon\\" luxury brand based on Paris' Hôtel de Crillon. In early 2012, Starwood sold a majority interest in the assemblage to JDS Development Group for $40 million but stayed on as a joint venture partner. In March 2012, the first plans for the site at 105-107 West 57th Street were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings for a 51-story tower rising and containing just 27 condominiums. Renderings of the planned development were revealed in September, showing a sloping CetraRuddy- designed tower covered with balconies facing Central Park. At the time, construction was expected to begin in early 2013 and wrap up by the end of 2014. At the end of 2012, Steinway & Sons announced an agreement to sell their long-time headquarters Steinway Hall at 109–113 West 57th Street. The $46 million sale of the 16-story building, which had been losing over $5 million a year for the company, closed in March 2013 to JDS Development, Property Markets Group, and Arthur P. Becker. Under the terms of the deal, Steinway would remain in the building for 18 months, after which they would move out so JDS could construct a new building on the site. Arthur P. Becker allegedly purchased his stake with the help of a $21 million loan from controversial Russian oligarchs Serguei Adoniev and Albert Avdolyan, concealed via a web of off-shore LLCs in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong orchestrated by British financier Andy Ruhan. JDS also paid $131.5 million to Wexford Capital for the land underneath the building in July 2013, which gave the company control of an expanded site stretching from 105-113 West 57th Street and allowed the construction of a much larger building. After the purchase, Starwood Capital Group exited their investment, leaving JDS and Property Markets Group as the developers. Shortly after, the developers secured a $230 million acquisition loan from Annaly Capital Management on the development site. In August 2013, the developers filed new permits for a tower designed by SHoP Architects that would hold 100 condominiums above six floors of retail. The next month, The Wall Street Journal unveiled renderings of the building's new design, which would stretch tall. Since Steinway Hall was declared a New York City Landmark in November 2001, SHoP's plans incorporated the existing building into the base of the new condominium tower. The building's interior was also protected by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in September 2013, requiring JDS to renovate and restore the space. The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the new tower in early October, paving the way for full construction permits. =Early construction and union protests= The developers broke ground on the project in early 2014. At the beginning of 2015, the building was approved with new permits showing the tower would rise 80 stories and tall. The new permits called for 55 luxury condominiums and a completion date of 2017. The construction site in June 2016 At the end of June, the developers received a four-year, $725 million construction loan, split between a $400 million senior loan from American International Group and a $325 million mezzanine loan from Apollo Global Management. The Qatar Investment Authority provided $161.5 million of the mezzanine loan through investment vehicles managed by Apollo. The next month, the developers installed the tallest freestanding crane in New York City history, which measured , to construct the building. The building's developers also chose to use non-unionized labor because of cheaper rates and because unions required developers to pay double overtime and contribute hourly pension and benefit fees. The building was the tallest project ever in New York City to be constructed with non-union labor. In May 2015, the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York's leader Gary LaBarbera criticized the building's developers for not giving their workers adequate safety training, and for not using union labor. The union also detailed multiple incidents that had occurred at the site including \\"a worker falling from scaffold that lacked a railing, one worker who fell in a partial building collapse and another who had his leg crushed when a steel beam slipped.\\" Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer sided with LaBarbera, sending Stern a letter expressing concern over the workers' safety, training, and pay. New York City Public Advocate Letitia James echoed Brewer's concerns and agreed that the usage of non-union labor could lead to increased danger for workers. By June 2016, the project had risen above street level. =AmBase lawsuits= Front facade with pinnacle installation, looking north from 6th Avenue on July 19, 2019. In the summer of 2017, after the tower had been built to 20 stories, construction stalled. According to a lawsuit filed by AmBase, an investor which had purchased a 59% stake in the building for $56 million in 2013, the developers neglected to account for cost overruns reaching $50 million in relation to renting construction cranes necessary for completing the skyscraper along with complications related to excavation. In order to cover the extra costs, the developers had issued six capital calls totaling $63.6 million. AmBase participated in the first four calls but not the last two, which resulted in their stake being diluted from 60.3% to 43.5%. December 2019 from Columbus Circle In retaliation, AmBase filed a lawsuit seeking $105 million in damages which claimed that the capital calls were unnecessary and done only to dilute their stake for the benefit of developers Kevin Maloney and Michael Stern. AmBase also claimed that Atlantic 57 LLC, controlled by Arthur P. Becker and Andy Ruhan, did not participate in any of the capital calls yet did not have their 26% stake diluted at all. Additionally, since construction costs had allegedly risen by more than 10%, AmBase claimed their contract entitled them to full repayment of their $66 million investment along with 20% interest. However, the developers claimed that since there had never been an officially approved budget, there was no measure by which to determine cost overruns. Without the additional cash from AmBase, the developers fell into default on the $325 million mezzanine loan from Apollo. However, they managed to negotiate a forbearance agreement on $300 million of the debt and the remaining $25 million was sold to Spruce Capital Management. The developers also were in the process of negotiating another $100 million mezzanine loan from Baupost Group to repay Spruce but the loan was vetoed by AmBase. At the end of July 2017, Spruce claimed that it had not received payment on the $25 million mezzanine loan and filed paperwork to begin the process of foreclosure. AmBase filed another lawsuit, claiming that developers Kevin Maloney and Michael Stern were colluding with the lender to allow a foreclosure which would wipe out AmBase's $66 million equity investment while preserving Maloney's and Stern's $35 million stake. The lawsuit resulted in a temporary restraining order which halted the foreclosure process until the New York Supreme Court could issue a ruling on August 14. However, at the end of August the Court ruled that Spruce Capital could proceed with foreclosure, which allowed the lender to hand over the development entirely to Maloney and Stern, wiping out AmBase's investment completely. AmBase appealed the ruling but lost again in the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division in January 2018. AmBase refiled their lawsuit in federal court in early 2018, claiming that Maloney and Stern's alleged collusion with Spruce violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and seeking a $136 million judgement. Despite the building's monetary and legal issues, a number of apartments in the tower had already gone to contract. However, AmBase and founder Richard Bianco faced their own lawsuit from hedge fund IsZo Capital, which claimed the company had purposefully forced the 2017 foreclosure by denying the Baupost Group loan. Following the foreclosure, Bianco had agreed to finance the lawsuit against Maloney and Stern in return for 30 to 45% of any payout from the lawsuit. According to IsZo, Bianco purposefully sabotaged efforts to prevent the 2017 foreclosure because he instead desired the personal payout from the lawsuit over whatever money AmBase could recover from preventing the foreclosure. In October 2018, AmBase's federal lawsuit was dismissed after the court found no evidence of collusion between Maloney, Stern, and Spruce. In September 2019, AmBase's appeal of the lawsuit was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. =Parkside Construction indictment and further lawsuits= By November 2017, the tower had reached a height of roughly , and initial glass facade installation had begun. In March 2018, the tower's height officially surpassed the halfway point at over . In May 2018, Madison Realty Capital provided a $90 million preferred equity investment in the tower, allowing construction to continue. Construction in November 2017, shortly after glass installation began The same month, New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. indicted general contractor Parkside Construction for a variety of financial crimes. The indictment included charges of stealing $1.7 million from 520 workers on the project by purposely shorting their hours and failing to pay them overtime, hiding nearly $42 million in wages from state insurance officials to avoid paying workers’ compensation premiums, and using undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Ecuador. The company's owners, Francesco and Salvatore Pugliese, were arrested and charged with grand larceny, insurance fraud and scheme to defraud. The company's construction foreman, payroll manager, and an outside accountant were also charged in the scheme. Parkside had previously been sued in 2015 in a class action lawsuit by former workers on the site, who had alleged widespread wage theft. The month after, Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group sued the building's developers for $30 million, claiming that their contract to market the building's units had been unfairly terminated. The developers claimed that the brokerage had been replaced with Douglas Elliman after failing to sell 25% of the building's units by the middle of 2018 as required by their contract. However, Corcoran claimed that due to the numerous lawsuits, delays, and cost overruns, the developers had halted marketing and sales for the units which made it impossible for the brokerage to reach their sales hurdles. Corcoran also sued Douglas Elliman for tortious interference, claiming the company had hired away the building's sales director in violation of her non-compete clause. In August, the developers filed paperwork with the Attorney General of New York to raise prices at the project despite a slowing luxury market. Sales at the project officially relaunched the next month with prices ranging from $18 million to over $57 million. On January 21, 2019, a suspended scaffold attached to the building broke free from the exterior of the 55th floor and showered pieces of broken glass from cracked windows over nearby sidewalks due to high winds. The New York City Buildings Department initiated a partial stop work order, and issued the site a violation for failure to safeguard construction equipment. In April 2019, the building's concrete form officially topped-out, and exterior work of its pinnacle is expected to be completed by 2020. After the dismissal of their three previous lawsuits, AmBase again sued Spruce Capital, Maloney, and Stern in May 2019 in another attempt to regain control of the project. In addition to restating their previous allegations of collusion between Spruce, Maloney, and Stern, AmBase also sought additional damages for the developers' alleged breach of their fiduciary duties. Around the same time, the building's penthouse entered contract for \\"close to\\" its asking price of $58 million, making it one of the most expensive New York condo sales of 2019. In August 2019, the developers hired Newmark Group to find tenants for the building's of retail space on the building's first four floors and basement. One month later, JDS asked lenders for a $1.1 billion loan to replace AIG's $725 million in construction debt. Design Midtown Manhattan looking north from the Empire State Building's 102nd floor, above ground level, November 2018. 111 West 57th Street can be seen at left. The development features two components: the landmarked Steinway Building, designed in 1925 by Warren & Wetmore, and a new tower, designed by SHoP Architects. The original Steinway Building was renovated and converted into 14 condo units while the tower contains 46 condominiums, including 7 duplex units. Both aspects are being developed by Michael Stern's JDS Development Group and Kevin P. Maloney's Property Markets Group while the skyscraper was designed by SHoP Architects. =Steinway Hall= Steinway Hall was designed by Warren & Wetmore. The exterior features a bas-relief of Apollo and a musical muse by Leo Lentelli located in the lunette above the grand window at ground level. The main room, a two-story rotunda, featured high domed ceilings, handpainted by Paul Arndt. The main rotunda sat up to 300 guests and a small symphony orchestra. The showrooms were covered with wood panels for better acoustics.Dolkart, Andrew S. & Postal, Matthew A.: Guide to New York City Landmarks; Third Edition: The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission; John Wiley & Sons, Inc; 2004. p. 126. =111 West 57th Street tower= The north side of the tower rises directly up to the pinnacle of the building. On the south side of the tower, a series of setbacks appear as the tower rises. As the height of the building increases, the setbacks eventually thin out, with the tower \\"disappearing into the sky.\\" Vanity Fair described it as \\"a subtle and graceful re-interpretation in modern form of the stepped-back, “wedding cake” towers of New York's past\\". The building's interiors were designed by Studio Sofield. The tower's facade features large glass windows on the north and south sides while the east and west feature smaller windows in between vertical bands of bronze and terracotta. The building includes of amenity space, containing a gym, an pool, barbershop, shoeshine stand, and a lounge featuring a Steinway grand piano. The building will have a porte-cochère for residents, and a recital hall will be constructed as an architectural reference to the fact that the building is being constructed on top of Steinway Hall. The building will include an tuned mass damper to provide stability in the event of high winds or a seismic event. The main tower has two elevators for 58 residences due to the small cross section, and the service elevator is the lower car of a double-deck elevator. Critical review Writing for Vanity Fair, Paul Goldberger referred to the plans for the tower as \\"quite possibly the most elegant\\" of the new structures planned for 57th Street and around Central Park, which include One57, 432 Park Avenue, 220 Central Park South, and Central Park Tower.

McCombes finished writing the book—described by The Scotsman as \\"the first insider's account of the fall-out from Sheridan's trips to a Manchester swinging club and his ill-fated decision to take on the News of the World after it published details of his sexual proclivities\\"—less than five months after Sheridan was jailed for committing perjury.

It was originally created by Rockwell for the 1956 Brown & Bigelow Boy Scout Calendar. Since then, it has become one of the most collected images that Rockwell created for the Boy Scouts of America. Creation Rockwell set out to create a painting dedicated to the Scoutmasters of the United States. In 1953, he visited the 4th National Scout jamboree at Irvine Ranch. Rockwell, who used photographs as a source for his paintings, was staging a photo shoot at the jamboree. He approached a Scoutmaster from Oakland and asked him for four boys to pose for a photo. One of the four chosen was Howard Lincoln who would become the chairman of Nintendo of America and later the CEO of the Seattle Mariners. The four Scouts set up tents and built a fire in the middle of a day. Rockwell found a professional Scouter at the jamboree headquarters to pose as the Scoutmaster for the all-day photo shoot. Later that year, Lincoln and the other three Scouts each received a $25 check and a letter from Rockwell asking them to sign a release. Over the course of the next three years, Rockwell turned the daytime pictures into a nighttime painting. The tents in the painting were modified to be civilian tents with guylines and sidewalls instead of military-style pup tents. It debuted as the 1956 Boy Scout Calendar published by Brown & Bigelow. Composition The painting is a late night scene that features a Scoutmaster, in full uniform, looking into the dying remains of a campfire. The cookware for that night's dinner is still visible. In the background four Scouts are asleep in two tents. Lincoln is in a white shirt directly to the right of the Scoutmaster; his face is visible.

It is named Vollum after Roy Vollum, the Canadian-born bacteriologist who first isolated it from a cow in Oxford, England. The \\"Vollum 14578\\" strain was selected for use in the bioweapons trials on Gruinard Island, which took place in 1942. Like other forms of Anthrax, the Vollum strain becomes more virulent with exposure to more hosts. A sub-strain called Vollum 1B was weaponized and was used in American warheads during the 1960s, but its origin is controversial. One theory that originated from a bio weapons veteran, William C. Patrick III, is that Vollum 1B came from being altered when the microbiologist William A. Boyles inhaled anthrax spores on the job. According to him, the \\"B\\" is there to stand for Boyles. A competing theory is based on the fact that during the 1940s and 1950s, a British biological weapons program worked to enhance the virulence of the strain by passing it through a series of monkey hosts, which created a sub-strain of the Vollum strain called \\"M36\\". In papers that reference this \\"M36\\" sub-strain, it is called the Vollum 1B strain. The M36 Vollum was reliably virulent, as opposed to other newly mutated strains, and thus it was chosen along with other Vollum derived strains to be used as tests for the effectiveness of newly developed vaccines against anthrax. In fact, Vollum proved to be so effective, that it continued to be used as a testing strain for developing vaccines for several decades and has continued even to the present. Regardless of its use for good to develop vaccines against anthrax, the Vollum strain is still highly dangerous and is thought to have been the strain that the Iraqi government possessed during the Gulf War. Evidence for this supposition comes from a faction of the United Nations Special Commission, UNSCOM BW45, which analyzed samples from places that they believed to be dump sites and found 14 positive hits for the Vollum strain in the northern area of Al Hakam's boundary.

Each participant takes three trips; each trip will be watched by their parents, an ex-traffic officer Judith Roberts and driving instructor John Lepine MBE (Series 2 only).

The 2nd Battalion was eliminated in a 1967 reorganization, while the 1st Battalion continued in existence until 2001.  Traditions  The 632nd Armor Regiment traced its lineage back to the 632nd Tank Destroyer Battalion that saw service in World War II as well as the 132nd Tank Battalion and 105th Armor Regiment of the Wisconsin National Guard.  History  M60 main battle tanks are lined up in the staging area at the Dundalk Marine Terminal after being offloaded from the vehicle cargo/rapid response ship USNS ANTARES (T-AKR-294). The tanks were used by the 32nd Separate Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), Wisconsin Army National Guard, during Exercise REFORGER '86. M60 of the 1-632 Armor firing on a tank range at Fort McCoy, 1990 On 1 April 1963, the regiment was created on the basis of elements of the 105th Armor Regiment. The regiment was initially represented by the 1st and 2nd Battalions, but the 30 December 1967 reorganization of the National Guard eliminated the 2nd Battalion. The Green Bay-based Headquarters and Headquarters Company and Companies A and C of the 2nd Battalion were consolidated into the headquarters and headquarters company of the 1st Battalion, 127th Infantry. Company B at Sparta was consolidated into the new 105th Light Equipment Maintenance Company together with headquarters and headquarters troop of the 1st Squadron, 105th Cavalry and Troop C of the same squadron. The same reorganization also eliminated the 32nd Infantry Division, and the 1st Battalion, 632nd Armor became a nondivisional unit under the control of the 264th Armor Group headquarters.Stubbs and Connor, p. 287 Changes in the 1st Battalion were the conversion of Company B, 3rd Battalion, 127th Infantry at Antigo to Company B of the 1-632 Armor and Battery A, 1st Battalion, 120th Artillery at Mosinee to Company C of the 1-632 Armor. The battalion headquarters and headquarters company remained at Wausau and Company A remained at Merrill. On 1 April 1971 the battalion was realigned under the 32nd Infantry Brigade, the successor to the 32nd Infantry Division, when the brigade converted from infantry to mechanized infantry. At the same time, the battalion headquarters company was split into a headquarters company and a support company. In late 2001, the 1st Battalion, 632nd Armor was inactivated as a result of the reorganization of the 32nd Infantry Brigade from mechanized to light infantry.

Biography  Chapiro was born in the Russian city of Novozybkov, near Belarus, in 1938. Soon thereafter his family moved to the nearby city of Gomel, Belarus, where Chapiro spent most of his childhood. During the German occupation of the western part of USSR (1941-1943) Chapiro's family was evacuated to the eastern part of Russia. Since his early childhood, Chapiro was captivated by painting. Thanks to his teachers, Peter Chernyshevsky and Boris Zvenigorodsky, the artists of great experience and talent, this endowment became his predilection, the raison d'être of his life. After 6 years of studies, he graduated from the Mukhina Institute of Arts and Industrial Design in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy). After graduation, he was sent for obligatory work (as was practiced in the USSR) to the capital of Siberia, the city of Novosibirsk, where he spent 7 years working for the government as a stylist, and in his free time, at nights, working on his paintings. In 1974 Chapiro left Novosibirsk and moved to Moscow, where he joined the Russia's underground avant-garde movement and regularly exhibited his works at the avant-garde center at Malaya Gruzinskaya 28, which in 1981 became the home of his solo exhibition. Like all underground artists, he was prosecuted by the Soviet regime. However, he was recognized by Russian intellectual elite, by scientists, especially physicists, by sportsmen, poets, musicians and artists. Only with Perestroyka he was recognized by a wider public. From 1988 to 1990 his paintings were exhibited at the Moscow Modern Art Gallery MARS. Chapiro immigrated to Canada from Russia in 1992. The themes of his paintings are portraits, landscapes, cityscapes, animals, flowers, and abstract works. The manner of Chapiro's paintings is a mixture of realism and abstraction. Chapiro paints mainly in oil on canvas. He is an author of portraits of Soviet physicists, such as Andrey Sakharov, Lev Landau, Evgeny Lifshitz, Mikhail Leontovich, Igor Tamm, Lev Artsimovich, Abram Ioffe. He is an author of a portrait of Russian ballerina Maya Plisetskaya. The painting is currently owned by St. Petersburg Museum for Theatre Arts. The portrait of Soviet composer Dmitry Shostakovich by Chapiro was exhibited at various exhibitions in New York and New Jersey. Chapiro's works represented at the Museum of Russian Art in New York. His personal exhibitions are regularly held in Montreal. His recent exhibition at Galerie Michel-Ange, Montreal, Canada, has included 15 portraits of most famous artists of 19-th and 20-th centuries, such as Claude Monet, Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso, Kazimir Malevich and others.

Gifford in on Oconomowoc Lake in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, United States. It is one of the country's oldest yacht clubs. It was built and designed by Architects Ferry and Clas from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  History  The Oconomowoc Lake Club was founded in 1890. It was originally involved with an improvement association that had a goal to maintain the lake levels and water traffic coming through the river connected to the lake. The Oconomowoc Lake Club were the ones who ended up installing the Danforth Lock. A local Oconomowoc mail boat was able to travel through this lock and twice a week they would deliver peoples mail to their piers. But that lock was eventually cemented shut and now a dam is used to control the water levels.http://www.americancanals.org/Data_Sheets/Wisconsin/Danforth%20Lock.pdf The history of the Lake Club is directly connected the Villa Gifford, also known as the Gifford Hotel. This hotel was originally a home located just west of the current Lake Club. George P. Gifford was the center of attention in the late 1800s in the Oconomowoc area; he had guests over often and they loved his food and all the recreational activities they did on Oconomowoc Lake. Eventually in the late 1860s Gifford opened his home to selected guests or members. After some construction to his home he had created a simple lakeside hotel, which predated the founding of the OLC. All the meetings for the next 19 years were held at the Gifford Hotel. The current OLC building was built in 1909. The OLC was noted in Life Magazine when metalworking magnate Ralph Robinson was elected as Commodore of the OLC. The OLC served members until 1994 when a fire broke out and its 1908-built building was burnt to the ground. After two years of negotiating the OLC was rebuilt in 1996, and as of 2016 it is still in business.

Features Species of Gliocladium are considered to have pathogenic potential although they are not commonly thought of as a disease causing agent in humans and animals. Gliotoxin is a metabolite of G. (now Trichoderma) deliquescens. The significance of gliotoxin has not yet been determined. Gliocladium species occur worldwide in soil and decaying organic matter. Some species of Gliocladium are parasitic on other fungi. Gliocladium is found world-wide. Gliocladium is classified as a RG-1 organism; it is assessed to have low to no individual or community risk. Also, this microorganism is unlikely to cause human or animal disease. This status has been assessed by the American Biological Safety Association based upon criteria of the Classification of Infective Microorganisms by Risk Group. Most species of Gliocladium grow rapidly in culture producing spreading colonies with a cotton-like texture, covering a Petri dish in 1 week. The colonies are initially white and cream-like; but may become reddish or green as they age and sporulate. Microscopically, Gliocladium species produces hyphae, conidiophores, and conidia borne from hyaline phialides. The conidiophores are erect, dense, and have a brush-like structure which produce tapering, slimy phialides. Gliocladium can produce conidiophores that are branching and vertically oriented, similar to the genera Verticillium, Trichoderma and Penicillium. Conidia are single-celled and cylindrical, accumulating in slime droplets at the tips of phialides that often become confluent across the apex of the entire conidiophore.

The architectural language has been developed to express the personality of Kazi Nazrul Islam, designed by architect Abin Chaudhuri. An introverted mass was designed around a central green Courtyard which provides diffused natural light to the interiors. Considering the nature of the functions within, it was important to restrict the exposure to direct sunlight. The use of thin exterior RC walls saved energy, cost and time. The use of concrete provided the opportunity to explore innovative ways of treating the building. An indigenous sculptural feature wall was devised with inscribed famous words of the poet. The main gate has an 8.5 m high block of concrete sitting atop stilts, another Corbusian influence. On it are embedded the words Unnata mama shir, from Nazrul’s poem Bidrohi. Of the seven blocks, three would house the museum, one block a library and another an auditorium.

Operated together with a network of interurbans, streetcars provided transportation within Tacoma and throughout the Puget Sound region. Buses replaced the last streetcars in 1938. Streetcar-type transportation returned to Tacoma in 2003 with the opening of the Tacoma Link, a light rail line in Downtown Tacoma. There are proposals both to expand this system and to construct a new heritage streetcar system. History Map of the Tacoma streetcar system in 1914 A century ago Tacoma, like many American cities, had an extensive rail transit system. The first two streetcar lines in Tacoma were constructed in 1888 along the lengths of Pacific Avenue and Tacoma Avenue. A pair of horses pulled each of the yellow streetcars. The lines were a success from the start, carrying many passengers, and were very soon thereafter extended. From these few lines others sprang up, each emanating from Downtown Tacoma into the surrounding areas, allowing for houses and business areas to develop. By around 1912 the city boasted 125 miles of streetcar trackage (much of it electrified) and almost 30 streetcar lines as well as an electric interurban rail connection to Seattle. Tacoma also had a simple cable car loop running from South 11th and 'A' St. to what is known now as Martin Luther King Jr. Way, down South 13th St. back to 11th and 'A'. This simple and frequent line helped to integrate trolley lines that served each street elevation. It also helped to ferry passengers up Tacoma’s steep hills which assisted in integrating the eastern and western sections of Downtown Tacoma. The streetcar lines individually had experienced many troubles over their 50-year lifetime, including many buyouts, defaults, takeovers, worker strikes and one notable tragedy. On a rainy July 4, 1900, a trolley jumped the tracks, plunging into a ravine and killing 43 passengers. At its peak the Tacoma Railway and Power Company was transporting in the range of 30,000,000 passengers a year, a number still not reached by the modern Pierce Transit. Because of increasing road construction the trolleys became difficult to operate in an environment increasingly dominated by personal automobiles and taxis. The year that US 99 was completed commuter traffic between Tacoma and Seattle via the electric Interurban fell off nearly 40%, signaling the end of the trolley era. The last streetcars in Tacoma ran on June 11, 1938. The day was marked by a citywide public holiday, with excursions over part of the route and a \\"Gay Nineties\\" dance at the Winthrop Hotel. The system was replaced with brand new rubber tired buses that could more easily move in and out of the growing amounts of traffic in downtown. However, the system failed again and was eventually acquired by the City of Tacoma – becoming the precursor of Pierce Transit. In the mid-1990s the Puget Sound region was dealing with increasing traffic. Voters approved Sound Move, a tri-county transportation package that formed Sound Transit. One of the major projects for the Pierce County/Tacoma area was Tacoma Link light rail line, which has helped to reinvigorate local interest in streetcars in the City of Tacoma. Line T (Tacoma Link) Line T (formerly known as Tacoma Link) is a light rail line located in downtown Tacoma and nearby areas. The line was completed in 2003 and primarily functions to transport commuters between a combined parking garage/transit hub and the downtown core. Heritage streetcar A former Tacoma Railway & Power Co. streetcar survives inside The Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant in downtown Tacoma. A grassroots movement has proposed to construct a heritage streetcar system which would interchange with the existing Tacoma Link but be operationally distinct. The system would serve Downtown Tacoma, Portland Avenue, 6th Avenue, North Downtown, and the Stadium District. In 2008 a committee of the Tacoma City Council accepted the findings of feasibility study concerning this proposal, which did not include cost estimates.

Life  Michalis Vardanis was born in the village of Apeiranthos on the Aegean island of Naxos in 1936. He entered the Hellenic Army Academy, from where he graduated in 1958 with the rank of second lieutenant. Already during his days in the academy, he became known for his pro-leftist views, an unusual—and dangerous—stance for an officer following the Greek Civil War. At the time of the colonels' coup d'état of 21 April 1967, Vardanis was serving as a captain of in a tank unit in Polygyros. Following the establishment of the military regime, he became privy, through his regimental commander, of the plans for the counter-coup by King Constantine II and the royalist Army leadership. Already before the—ultimately unsuccessful—royal counter-coup broke out, however, his activity aroused suspicion and was betrayed to the Army intelligence, so that on 26 October 1967 Vardanis was dismissed from the Army. Vardanis then enrolled in the Athens University Law School, and after receiving his degree worked for a few years as a lawyer. At the same time, he became active in almost every resistance group established among those in the officer corps who were ready to oppose the regime: thus he participated in Colonel Dimitrios Opropoulos' Free Greeks group, and in Wing Commander Tasos Minis' A-A-A group, for which he was arrested on 22 April 1972, along with Minis. Released, he was re-arrested in September of the same year for his membership in the Free Greeks. Despite torture by the Greek Military Police (EAT-ESA), he did not confess, and was released on 16 December. Soon after that, he became privy to the plans for a major mutiny by the Navy, through another dismissed Army officer, Spyros Moustaklis. After the Navy mutiny was betrayed and the abortive coup was pre-empted by the junta on 25 May 1973, Vardanis was again arrested on 1 June. He was held along with Moustaklis in strict isolation for the next three months and again tortured by EAT- ESA—Moustaklis remained crippled as a result—until the general amnesty proclaimed on 24 August 1973 by the dictator Georgios Papadopoulos in his effort to usher in a guided transition to democratic rule. Following the fall of the junta in 1974, he was among the signatories in the founding declaration of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, and served as a prosecution witness in the Junta Trials. In 1976 he was rehabilitated and allowed to resume his career in the Army, where he continued to serve until 1990, reaching the rank of major general (lieutenant general in retirement). Following his retirement, he became active in the ranks of the Communist Party of Greece, and from 1995 until 2005 was chairman of the Society of the Imprisoned and Exiled Resistance Members 1967–74.

It was developed by Thomas Joiner and is outlined in Why People Die By Suicide.Joiner, T. E. (2005). Why People Die By Suicide. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press The theory consists of three components that together lead to suicide attempts. According to the theory, the simultaneous presence of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness produce the desire for suicide. While the desire for suicide is necessary, it alone will not result in death by suicide. Rather, Joiner asserts that one must also have acquired capability (that is, the acquired ability) to overcome one's natural fear of death. A number of risk factors have been linked to suicidal behavior, and there are many theories of suicide that integrate these established risk factors, but few are capable of explaining all of the phenomena associated with suicidal behavior as the interpersonal theory of suicide does. Another strength of this theory lies in its ability to be tested empirically. It is constructed in a way that allows for falsifiability. A number of studies have found at least partial support for the interpersonal theory of suicide.Van Orden, K. A., Witte, T. K., Cukrowicz, K. C., Braithwaite, S., Selby, E. A., & Joiner Jr., T. E. (2010). The interpersonal theory of suicide\\". Psychological Review, 117(2), 575-600Joiner Jr, T. E., Van Orden, K. A., Witte, T. K., Selby, E. A., Ribeiro, J. D., Lewis, R., & Rudd, M. D. (2009). \\"Main predictions of the interpersonal–psychological theory of suicidal behavior: Empirical tests in two samples of young adults\\". Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 118(3), 634 Specifically, a systematic review of 66 studies using the interpersonal theory of suicide found that the effect of perceived burdensomeness on suicide ideation was the most tested and supported relationship. The theory’s other predictions, particularly in terms of critical interaction effects, are less strongly supported. Desire for suicide =Thwarted belongingness= Belongingness—feeling accepted by others—is believed to be a fundamental need, something that is essential for an individual's psychological health and well-being.Baumeister, R. F., & Leary, M. R. (1995). \\"The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation\\". Psychological Bulletin, 117, 497-529 Increased social connectedness—a construct related to belongingness—has been shown to lower risk for suicide. More specifically, being married, having children, and having more friends are associated with a lower risk of suicidal behavior.Hoyer G, & Lund E. (1993). \\"Suicide among women related to number of children in marriage\\". Archives of General Psychiatry, 50, 134–137 Additionally, \\"pulling together\\" (e.g., gathering for sporting events, celebrations) with others has been shown to have a preventive effect.Joiner, Jr., T.E., Hollar, D., & Van Orden, K.A. (2007). \\"On Buckeyes, Gators, Super Bowl Sunday, and the Miracle on Ice: 'Pulling together' is associated with lower suicide rates\\". Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 25, 180–196 For example, suicide rates have been lower on Super Bowl Sundays than other Sundays, and it is believed that the social connectedness that occurs from being a fan of a sport's team increases one's feeling of belongingness. In contrast, social isolation is frequently reported by those who die by suicide prior to death.Trout, D. L. (1980). \\"The role of social isolation in suicide\\". Suicide and Life Threatening Behavior, 10, 10–23 =Perceived burdensomeness= Perceived burdensomeness is the belief that one is a burden on others or society. Joiner describes perceived burdensomeness as the belief that \\"my death is worth more than my life\\". Unemployment, medical or health problems, and incarceration are examples of situations in which a person may feel like they are a burden to others. It is important to note that the burdensomeness is \\"perceived\\", and is often a false belief. According to the theory, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness together constitute the desire for suicide. Acquired capability Joiner terms this \\"acquired\\" capability because it is not an ability with which humans are born. Rather, this ability to engage in suicidal behaviors is only acquired through life experiences. Fear of death is a natural and powerful instinct. According to the theory, one's fear of death is weakened when one is exposed to physical pain or provocative life experiences as these experiences often lead to fearlessness and pain insensitivity. These experiences could include childhood trauma, witnessing a traumatic event, suffering from a severe illness, or engaging in self-harm behaviors. These behaviors are thought to result in the desensitization to painful stimuli and to increase one's ability to engage in suicidal behaviors. This component is important in identifying individuals who are likely to attempt or die by suicide. For example, certain professions (e.g., soldiers, surgeons, and police officers) are exposed to physical pain or provocative experiences. More specifically, soldiers with a history of combat have likely been exposed to grave injuries, witnessing the death of others, and are habituated to fear of painful experiences.Joiner, T. E. (2010). \\"Overcoming the fear of lethal injury: Evaluating suicidal behavior in the military through the lens of the interpersonal–psychological theory of suicide\\". Clinical Psychology Review, 30(3), 298-307. doi:10.1016/j.cpr.2009.12.004 This is consistent with data indicating an increased rate of suicide in soldiers. Additionally, past attempts of suicide has been found to be the number one predictor of future attempts.Borowsky, I. W., Ireland, M., & Resnick, M. D. (2001). \\"Adolescent suicide attempts: risks and protectors\\". Pediatrics, 107(3), 485-493Kessler, R. C., Borges, G., & Walters, E. E. (1999). \\"Prevalence of and risk factors for lifetime suicide attempts in the National Comorbidity Survey\\". Archives of General Psychiatry, 56(7), 617-626 This is consistent with Joiner's theory; individuals who attempt suicide will habituate to the fear of death, and this weakened fear will make an individual more likely to make a subsequent attempt. Implications A survey study of a large population-based cohort provides support for the interpersonal theory in that the interaction between thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness predicted suicidal ideation, and suicidal ideation and ability predicted plans to attempt suicide and actual attempts.Christensen, H., Batterham, P. J., Soubelet, A., & Mackinnon, A. J. (2013). \\"A test of the interpersonal theory of suicide in a large community- based cohort\\".

Retrieved 2 June 2014 known as Major Bill Smith, was an American record producer, publisher, promoter, songwriter, and record label owner based in Fort Worth, Texas. Biography He was born in Checotah, Oklahoma, and grew up listening to country and gospel music. In the Second World War he worked in a bomber factory before joining the United States Army Air Corps and being posted to England. As a B-17 navigator, he flew combat missions over Germany, and was wounded during his 33rd mission. He retired as a Major and after the war he became a public relations officer at Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas, and began writing songs for local musicians. He also claimed to have worked for Don Robey, promoting records on Robey's Duke and Peacock labels, as well as producing some records himself by R&B; singer Joe Hinton and others. His first success came as the writer of Sonny James' 1956 hit, \\"Twenty Feet of Muddy Water\\". There is some uncertainty over details of his life, and he has been described as \\"a relentless self-promoter who seemed disinclined to let the facts get in the way of a good story\\".Laurie E. Jasinski (ed.), The Handbook of Texas Music, Texas A&M; University Press, 2012 He left the military in 1959, but used the designation Major in all his later dealings. He set up the LeCam record label and production company in Fort Worth with George Campbell; the name derived from that of Smith's wife Letitia, and Campbell. After several local hits, and reputedly turning down a young singer named John Deutschendorf or John Denver, his first national success came in 1962 as producer of Bruce Channel's hit \\"Hey! Baby\\", on which one of Smith's protégés, Delbert McClinton, played harmonica. On that and other records, Smith's assistant Marvin \\"Smokey\\" Montgomery has also been credited as producer.Gary Hickinbotham, A History of the Texas Recording Industry, 2004, p.9 The following year, Smith was approached by college students Ray Hildebrand and Jill Jackson, and recorded the duo immediately on hearing their song. As \\"Hey Paula\\", credited to Paul and Paula, it became an international hit. Smith's third major hit as a credited producer was \\"Last Kiss\\", recorded by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers in 1964. Other acts reportedly produced by Smith included Larry & the Blue Notes, Bobby Skel (Skelton), T-Bone Walker, The Legendary Stardust Cowboy, and Gene Summers. Smith set up several music publishing companies, record labels, and promotion companies besides LeCam, including Charay Records and LeBill Music Inc., logging some 3,000 releases over his 30-year career and garnering four gold and one platinum record awards. He also preached and raised funds for charity at the Union Gospel Mission in Fort Worth. In later years, he achieved some notoriety for circulating tapes which he claimed proved that Elvis Presley had not died in 1977 but was still alive. \\"The Mysterious Death of Elvis Presley\\", ClassicBands.com.

Manor The Domesday Book records that until 1066 one Leofgeat held the manor of Ortune, probably at what is now Nether Worton. After the Norman Conquest of England an estate of three hides and half a yardland at Worton passed to William the Conqueror's half-brother Odo of Bayeux. By 1086 there were 15 households consisting of 10 smallholders and five villagers. Nether Worton House is the former manor house.

The bakery was established in 1946, and is best known for its wheat bread. The company has changed management several times, and as of 2014 is owned by Bimbo Bakeries USA.  History  Brownberry was created by Catherine Clark in 1946. Catherine was baking bread for her family and friends. Clark’s friends and family urged her to sell the bread. Catherine Clark and her husband mortgaged their home for $7,000 to become Brownberry Ovens. Catherine Clark came up with the name by watching the bread come out of the oven and said it looked “Brown as a berry”. That was how Brownberry was born. Clark baked batches of 25 loaves daily in her home kitchen on Summit Avenue. Catherine set her ovens up in an old store building, bought a second hand truck for deliveries, and hired two assistants to help her with labor of kneading and baking. The net profit from the first year was $86. The sales doubled annually as the years progressed. Clark ultimately built a $400,000 plant in Oconomowoc. In 1953, they built a 20,000 square foot bakery, followed with a rapid succession by three 10,000 square foot additions. The additions have continued up to the present time. Catherine sold Brownberry Ovens to the Peavey Company in 1973 for $5.5 million. Catherine remained as chairman of the board of Brownberry. Catherine Clark was the first woman ever to serve on the Peavey board of directors. In 1996, Brownberry was sold for $146 million. In Catherine’s own words, her goals were, from the beginning to create a \\"certain kind of product, not the every day or the ordinary, not a copy of the competition, not something just a little bit better.\\" Brownberry has never had a money-losing year. In an attempt to create a broader name recognition across the country, George Weston Bakeries assisted the bakery in having all products bear the name Arnold by the end of 2008. The name change helped get the bakery broader distribution to Northeast and Southeast regions to grow the business. Brownberry changed the recipe of the bread, and was changed back after complaints. Arnold, like Brownberry, enjoys a long history, having begun in 1940 by Dean and Betty Arnold. In 23 years, Brownberry has gone through 6 mergers to become what it is today. The bakery produces and ships more than 1 million pounds of bread every week. Brownberry made $115 million in 2013.  Rail service  The Canadian Pacific Railway's Watertown Subdivision runs parallel to Brownberry. An industrial spur on the north side of the bakery allows for hopper cars filled with grain to be switched out. This usually happens on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays by a local CP freight train. There are always around 4-6 empty or full cars parked in the spur.

It was also called the Patio of the Pond or the Reservoir (Patio del Estanque o de la Alberca) because of the central pond, which is 34 metres long and 7,10 meters wide. The patio is divided in two sides by the pond, which receives its water from two fountains. The space has chambers and porticoes around it. These porticoes rest on columns with cubic capitals, which have seven semicircular arches decorated with fretwork rhombuses and inscriptions praising God. The central arch is greater than the other six and has solid scallops decorated with stylised vegetal forms and capitals of Mocárabes. The most important chambers that surround the Patio are the ones in the north side, which are part of the Comares Palace, the official residence of the King.  Comares Palace  The name of the Palace, Comares, has led to various etymological research. For instance, Diego de Guadix wrote a dictionary about Arabic words in which it is said that Comares originally comes from cun and ari. The first term means stand up and the second one look, in other words it would have meant Stand up and look around or possibly Open your eyes and see, which is a way of referring the beauty of the place.Guadix 2005: p. 551 In the sixteenth century, a historian from Granada called Luis de Mármol Carvajal claimed that the term Comares derived from the word Comaraxía, that actually has a meaning related to a craftsmanship labor very appreciated by Muslims: a manufacturing technique of glass for exterior and ceilings.Pijoán 1954: p. 516 A third suggested theory is that the name comes from the Arab word qumariyya or qamariyya. These ones designate the stained glasses that can even be glimpsed from the Hall of the Ambassadors' balcony.Irwin 2003: p. 36 Cfr: Sánchez Mármol, in his book Andalucía Monumental (Granada 1985) There's another possibility that says that Qumarish is the name of a region in the North of Africa where most craftsmen came from, in other words, the place might be called Comares in honour of the people who worked there.James Dickie, expert on the Alhambra  See also  Alhambra  References   Bibliography   * Alhambra (Spain) Courtyards Gardens in Spain Islamic gardens Spanish gardens Moorish architecture in Spain World Heritage Sites in Spain ","title":"Court of the Myrtles"},{"id":"42946542","text":"Pandit Hindraj Divekar (pronunciation: ) is a virtuoso of the Rudra Veena and Sitar.

As a result of her studies in Havana in the 1990s, she met several women who volunteered on the Cuban Literacy Campaign. In 1961, the Cuban government aimed to eradicate illiteracy across the island in the space of one year. It sent 250,000 volunteers across Cuba to teach reading and writing in rural communities for 12 months. 100,000 of the volunteers were under 18 and more than half of them were women. In 2004, just before Murphy was to leave Havana and return to the United States, she decided to record three interviews with former Literacy Campaign volunteers. From 2004 to 2010, she continued to track down stories of Literacy Campaign volunteers and the families that hosted them, eventually producing and directing MAESTRA and founding The Literacy Project.

In some cultures the navel is seen as sexually and culturally significant, and its exposure has been subject to a variety of cultural norms and taboos, based on concepts of modesty. The views, customs and fashions relating to the navel change from time to time, and such exposure has become more widely acceptable, as reflected in design of clothing. Western culture The public exposure of the male and female midriff and bare navel has been taboo at times in Western cultures, being considered immodest or indecent. It was banned in some jurisdictions. Eventually, only female navel exposure was banned and not male because, it was argued, the simulation or upward displacement from vagina to navel was commonplace and obvious in women. Community perceptions have changed and exposure of female midriff and navel is more accepted today and in some societies or contexts it is both fashionable and common, though not without its critics. Although American teenage girls are more likely to wear shirts that reveal their midriffs, this kind of clothing is often banned in high schools and stores. It is also inappropriate to wear clothing that reveals the midriff in professional settings like places of work. The exposure of the male navel has not been as controversial nor as common, and is usually in the context of barechestedness. Exposure of the navel by females is commonly associated with the popularity of the bikini, of the crop top and low-rise clothing. =Film= In the United States, the Motion Picture Production Code, or Hays Code, enforced after 1934, banned the exposure of the female navel in Hollywood films. * The National Legion of Decency, a Roman Catholic body guarding over American media content, also pressured Hollywood to keep clothing that exposed certain parts of the female body, such as bikinis and low-cut dresses, from being featured in Hollywood movies. Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello in publicity photo for the series of Beach Party films, 1963 During the 1950s, Joan Collins was prohibited by the censors from exposing her navel in Land of the Pharaohs (1955). To get around the censors' guidelines, she wore a jewel, a ruby, in her navel. Kim Novak wore a ruby jewel in her navel for the film Jeanne Eagels (1957); saying in an interview, \\"they had to glue it in every time. I got a terrible infection from it.\\" Marilyn Monroe, for a scene from Some Like It Hot (1959), wore a dress that revealed skin everywhere but had a tiny piece of fabric to hide her navel. (The film was condemned by the National Legion of Decency, but for other reasons.Films Condemned by the Legion of Decency) By the 1960s, community standards had changed. Marilyn Monroe was allowed to expose her navel in Something's Got to Give (1962) and later commented, \\"I guess the censors are willing to recognize that everybody has a navel.\\" Ursula Andress, appearing as Honey Rider in the 1962 James Bond film, Dr. No, wore her iconic white bikini, which exposed her midriff and navel. However, when Annette Funicello was cast in her first beach movie Beach Party (1963), Walt Disney, who held her contract, insisted that she only wear modest bathing suits and keep her navel covered, to preserve her wholesome persona, though she was the only one of the ample number of young women in the film not bikini-clad. In the 1967 film Follow That Camel, actress Anita Harris wore a jewel on her navel for a belly-dancing sequence. The Hays Code was abandoned soon after, and with it the prohibition of female navel exposure, as well as other restrictions. The influence of the National Legion of Decency had also waned by the 1960s. With the withdrawal of the Code and the change to a classification regime, the ban on the exposure of parts of the human body that had previously been regarded as immodest or indecent was withdrawn; and with it there was an increasing level of body exposure over time. The exposure of the navel ceased to be controversial in the context of a general increase in nudity. During the late 1980s, Disney's animated heroines began exposing more skin as well. In the 1989 musical-fantasy film The Little Mermaid, the lead protagonist, Ariel, revealed her navel while wearing only fins and a seashell bra, a first in Disney's history. =Television= Barbara Eden in a publicity photo of 1960's TV show I Dream of Jeannie In 1951, the United States Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters came into force, which, besides other things, prohibited female navel exposure on American television. During the 1960s, Barbara Eden was not allowed to show her navel on the American TV show I Dream of Jeannie (1965–70). Her pants had to be worn above the navel, which became ineffective. After a few frames of her navel exposure went unnoticed, they decided to use fabric and skin-colored makeup to conceal her navel. Her costume became low-rise (without censorship) in 1985 and in 2013, Barbara Eden attended the Life Ball event in Vienna dressed in the same costume of I Dream of Jeannie but revealing her navel. In February 1964, Scandinavian Airlines placed an advertisement in newspapers and magazines throughout the United States. It featured a blonde-haired, bikini- clad model exposing her belly button posing on a rock above the caption \\"What to show your wife in Scandinavia\\". The image that appeared in most publications had the belly button removed. Cher exposing her navel for a scene from an Egyptian soap opera skit on The Sonny and Cher Show, 1977 The first exposure of a navel in a TV series occurred in 1961 on the Dr. Kildare series. Dawn Wells and Tina Louise were not allowed to expose their navels in Gilligan's Island (1964–67). Wells was required to wear high-waisted shorts that covered her navel. Wells stated in an interview, \\"Oh my goodness, I designed the shorts. Because it was the first short shorts ever on television and it had to cover my navel. Gilligan's Island actually gave censors headaches back in the '60s. Ginger's cleavage, and Mary Ann's navel were only allowed 3 seconds an episode.\\" The censors missed Nichelle Nichols showing her navel in the second-season Star Trek episode \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" (1967). It is believed that it was due to Bjo Trimble that it went unnoticed. Another episode of Star Trek, called \\"A Private Little War\\" (1968), also managed to get past the censors when Nancy Kovack's belly button was clearly visible in some shots and not covered by jewelry as seen when the fringe from her top was not covering it. In 1969, Mariette Hartley was not allowed to reveal her belly button in \\"All Our Yesterdays\\" (1969), the penultimate episode of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek. Gene had Mariette expose not one but two belly buttons in the sci-fi film Genesis II (1973).Mariette Hartley's Playboy Interview. Bookmice.net. originally In The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour (1971–74), network censors feared Cher's navel exposure would become a cause célèbre at CBS.

Réard could not find a model who would dare wear his brief design, so he hired Micheline Bernardini, a 19-year-old nude dancer from the Casino de Paris, as his model.Emily Mitchell, \\"The Bikini Turns 50\\", 1 July 1996, Volume 148, No. 1, Time The uptake of the new-style swimsuit was very slow, and even then the bikini was not regarded as suitable clothing beyond the beach or pool.

Female beach volley ball players play in bikinis – does it bother anyone?\\" American female golfer Laura Diaz commenting to the Ladies Professional Golf Association for Sports Illustrated, \\"The LPGA needs to acknowledge that a lot of people watch women's sports more for the women than for the sports. Why else would Anna Kournikova, who has never won a singles title, be the most popular player in women's tennis? We have quite a few attractive women, and we should use our looks to our advantage. After all, what's so wrong with seeing an occasional belly button?\\" American football Males often wear no shirt with low-rise shorts during practice. This was somewhat upheld during practice of American football, which was carried over to wearing cropped jerseys during 1980s broadcasts. Cropped jerseys became dormant for 20 years until male athletes returned to midriff exposure for comfort purposes. However, the NCAA has placed an official ban on navel exposure.    * The National Football League has long placed a ban on navel exposure (It has since required jerseys to be tucked in.) and banned Elliott's crop top in September 2016. Mediterranean, Hebrew and Middle Eastern cultures =Literature and philosophy= A belly dancer in Marrakech in Morocco In the Hebrew Bible the Song of Songs emphasizes the navel as an important element of a woman's beauty.Murphy Ronald E (1992) \\"Song of songs, Book of\\", in The Anchor Bible Dictionary, vol 6. p. 151Dobbs-Allsopp F. W. (2001) Annotation and commentary on \\"Song of Solomon\\" in 'The New Oxford Annotated Bible' (with the Apocrypha. Third Edition (Ed) Coogan, M.D. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. page 966 from pages 959–968 It contains imagery similar to that in the love songs of ancient Egyptian literature. Song of Songs 7:2 states: \\"Your navel is a rounded bowl.\\"The New Oxford Annotated Bible. New Revised Standard Version. Oxford: Oxford University Press 2001. The verse preceding the line mentioning the navel (Song of Songs 7:1) states, \\"your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand\\", ) and the verse following states, \\"Your belly is a heap of wheat.\\" Thus the treatment of the navel appears placed textually in between the description of the curves of a woman through thigh and the stomach or midriff. \\"Belly\\" also suggests the womb, and the combination of the imagery of the womb with that of wheat suggests the link between eroticism and fertility through the imagery of the navel and curvaceous thighs. These passages also celebrate a curvaceous stomach and midriff and plumpness as aspects of female physical attractiveness. The ancient Mediterranean, Hebrew, Israelite and Middle Eastern worldview commonly incorporated beliefs that shrines, important places (such as cities or capitals), or other such places of prominence had a position of centrality to the world and hence equated to the child-bearing, life-giving navel of a mother. These domains constituted what contemporaries could regard as important bonds that linked the universe. Thus Nippur, an ancient city of the Mesopotamian people, was often described as the \\"navel\\". This usage expressed connotations of the prominence of the location and the way it was seen to function as a place of centrality and as a link between earth and the heavens and the Universe. The Ancient Greeks regarded the conical stone Omphalos (meaning \\"navel\\") located at Delphi as the center of the earth. In a similar vein, Jewish Midrashim state: \\"God created the world like an embryo. Just as the embryo begins at the navel and continues to grow from that point, so too the world. The Holy One, blessed be he, began the world from its navel. From there it was stretched hither and yon. Where is its navel? Jerusalem. And its (Jerusalem's) navel itself? The altar.\\"Jellinek, Beth ha-Midrash, V, 63 This passage expresses the centrality of the ancient city of Jerusalem and of the altar of the ancient temple of Jerusalem within a cosmic framework equated to the navel of a mother and the source of life. Similar concepts appear in the Book of Jubilees 8:19 and in the Book of Enoch 26:1, which describes Mount Zion as \\"The center of the navel of the earth\\". Samaritan tradition sees Mount Gerizim as the navel of the earth, the only place not submerged in the deluge in the account of Noah's Ark. The phrase \\"navel of the earth\\" occurs in (Ezek 38:12; Judg 9:37) Aramaic tibbur (\\"navel\\") and the concept recurs in Ezek 16:4. According to Samaritan tradition, God made Adam from the dust of Mount Gerizim. The belly-dancing tradition of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cultures also celebrates the navel.Hobin, Tina (2003) Belly Dance: The Dance of Mother Earth. Marion Boyars Publishers Ltd. London. New York p. 173-195. . When Pope Urban II called (1095) for the First Crusade, he referred to Jerusalem as \\"the navel of the world\\".

While the West was relatively resistant to midriff-baring clothing until the 1980s, it has long been a fashion with Indian women.Banerjee, Mukulika & Miller, Daniel (2003) The Sari. Oxford; New York: Berg These women, especially those from Southern India, have traditionally worn saris that bare the midriff. Women from Rajasthan leave the midriff exposed while wearing Ghagra Cholis. These women often cover their heads with dupattas, and may cover their faces in front of strangers with ghoonghats. There is a belief associated with the religious in India that navel-baring has a symbolic, almost mystical, association with birth and life, and that the display is meant to emphasize the centrality of nature in the nurture role.Beck, Brenda (1976) \\"The Symbolic Merger of Body, Space, and Cosmos in Hindu Tamil Nadu\\" in Contributions to Indian Sociology; 10(2): 213–43. In ancient Indian tradition, the navel of the god Vishnu is considered to be the center of the universe and the source of life. From his navel a new world emerges.

Women in this type of attire are very common in many ancient Indian sculptures, and paintings. Indian sculpture emphasised the centrality and sexuality that emanated from the depiction of the woman's navel. One of the most stunning examples would be Didarganj Yakshi, a statue of a woman made during the Mauryan period.

There are many ways to express beauty, as part of aesthetics, and to express freedom but not by showing things that lead to pornography.\\" He further added that while the state could not dictate dress codes, citizens were expected to respect the country's moral values and courtesy.

Her works cover national and global issues.  Early life  Del Río Reyes was born in Coyoacán, Mexico City and grew up in a family of writers. Her mother, María Aurelia Reyes de del Río, was a writer, journalist and painter. Her father, Manuel del Río Govea, was a lawyer, historian and was a former child actor. Her brother, Carlos Pacheco Reyes, was a philosopher, journalist and psychiatrist. She learned to paint and inherited her liking for literature and classical music from her mother. Her interest for theater and history came from her father. Her mother died suddenly when she was only 17 years old, it forced her to quit her studies and get a job as a secretary in a government office. Alfonso Reyes, her great uncle, revised her first newspaper articles that she had started to write (when she was 16 years old, she won a poetry award) after retaining her mother's column of opera reviews. Del Río Reyes also worked as a personal assistant to Diego Rivera during the last four years of his life. She was married to the world-renowned Mexican violinist, Hermilo Novelo, for 23 years until his death in an automobile accident in 1983 at the age of 52.  Studies  Del Rio Reyes attended high school at the Universidad Femenina de México. In college, she attended the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and Escuela de Arte Teatral de Bellas Artes. After graduating, director Seki Sano, gave her a scholarship to study in his Academia, where she shared a classroom with actors from previous generations such as Wolf Ruvinskis and María Douglas. She received her Doctor in Philosophy from the University of California, Irvine.  Career  = 1950s = Del Río Reyes' acting career in theater was launched in 1952 with her debut in the play, Contigo, pan y cebolla by Manuel Eduardo de Gorostiza in the Palacio de Bellas Artes, alongside Manolo Fábregas and under the direction of Salvador Novo. She would go on to have roles in other plays such as Un día de octubre by George Kaiser, Empire State by Lino Landy, La molinera de Arcos by Alejandro Casona; El juicio by Alfredo Pacheco Buenrostro and Por el ojo de una aguja by Carlos Prieto. In 1957, Del Río Reyes wrote her first drama, Fraude a la tierra, a monologue that addresses the hardships of the Mexican emigrant laborers. She took it to Moscow and assumed the role of director and actress. It premiered on August 3 in the Malenki Theater during a festival. After returning from her first trip to Europe, she fulfilled her previous commitment to act in Fuenteovejuna by Lope de Vega and directed by Alvaro Custodio, even though it would be her last performance. Two years later, Del Río Reyes directed Fraude a la tierra in the Instituto Regional de Cuernavaca, with one of her theater students playing the role of the female protagonist. She became a collaborator in 1958 for the cultural supplement section of the newspaper Excélsior in Mexico City where she published daily interviews. That same year, she began her teaching career as professor of dramatic arts in the Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP). Her new position was to teach courses in Ciudad Sahagún. Shortly thereafter, she would join the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) as professor of dramatic arts, teaching her classes in the Centro de Iniciación Artística in Cuernavaca and Atzcapotalco. As a drama critic, Del Río Reyes published during a period of ten years (1958–1968), the column Diorama teatral in the supplement Diorama de la Cultura using the pen-name Mara Reyes. She joined the Escuela de Arte Teatral de Bellas Artes in Mexico City where she remained as a professor until 1972. = 1960s and 1970s = Her literary production increased throughout the 1960s, specifically that of her plays. She would write dramas such as En las manos de Uno, Miralina, El hijo de trapo and Claudia y Arnot, these last three written in accordance with her manifest of relativist drama. El hijo de trapo won various regional and national awards in the competitions sponsored by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) such as the Premio Regional en Mérida during the third national theater competition there. Del Río Reyes also collaborated with other prestigious drama critics in publications about Mexican theater during this decade. Another literary achievement of hers is the writing of her short-story La bomba \\"L\\" in 1965 that years later would be converted into her first novel. The 1970s continued bringing critical acclaim to Del Río Reyes' play-writing. El pulpo -Tragedia de los hermanos Kennedy- debuted in 1970 under the direction of Jorge Esma in the Teatro del Bosque in Mexico City. This documentary play about the controversy surrounding the deaths of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy ended up winning the national prize Juan Ruíz de Alarcón for drama by the Asociación de Críticos de México. The commemorative plaque of its 100 stagings was revealed in the Teatro Reforma also in Mexico City, site to which it was moved after its inaugural season in the Teatro del Bosque. Her epic poem Trece Cielos, composed of alexandrine sonnets, won the national prize Olímpico in 1968 for poetry. However, in 1975, it was staged as a theatrical show by Joaquín Lanz in the Teatro de la Procaduría General de la República Mexicana. Later, it would be recorded on a disk commemorating the \\"International Year of Women\\". Aside from her plays, Del Río Reyes' first novel Proceso a Faubritten was published in 1976. During this decade, she and her husband, Hermilo Novelo moved to Prague in 1972 upon being appointed as cultural attaché in the Mexican Embassy and remained there for five years. Between 1977 and 1979, Del Río Reyes was the head of Unidad de Relaciones Culturales Internacionales of the Ministry of Public Education in Mexico in which she created cultural projects such as the current Centro de Investigación y Documentación Teatral Rodolfo Usigli. In 1979, her diplomatic and civil service continued as she was once again appointed to be the cultural attaché in the Mexican Embassy in Brussels. Although much of her time was consumed by her diplomatic obligations in the Mexican Embassy, the articles, poems and essays she managed to write in her free time ended up being published in European journals. = 1980s = In the early 1980s, her husband was killed in a car accident while en route to a concert in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico in 1983. The following year, she paid tribute to his memory upon writing the monologue De camino al concierto and it ended up inaugurating the first Latin Theater festival in Los Angeles as well as winning the César prize for best play. Shortly thereafter, Del Río Reyes would take her award- winning monologue to Mexico and stage it in the Teatro Benito Juárez. The actor, Luis Miranda, would play the role of the violinist for both seasons and he received critical acclaim for his performance from drama critics. A plaque was placed in the Teatro Benito Juárez to celebrate its 100 stagings in 1985. After completing the exams she needed to take in order to finish her high school studies, she pursued a degree in Hispanic literature from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and graduated in 1988. That same year, her novel La cripta del espejo was published as well as her historical play, Tlacaélel. At the age of 56, she would leave Mexico, complete her doctorate at the University of California, Irvine in one year, and accept a teaching position as Assistant Professor of Spanish at the University of Central Florida, where she would be promoted to Associate Professor and eventually Full Professor. = 1990s to present = Although she spent the 90's in the United States because of her newly acquired faculty position, she still dedicated time to her own creative writing. Her book of poems Homenaje a Remedios Varo, won the Letras de Oro first prize in poetry, and the University of Miami published it in 1993. Besides her writing, she also found time to continue painting and some of her art would be shown in galleries and museums in Miami, New York City and Washington, D.C. Del Río Reyes retired from the University of Central Florida in 2004, after 14 years of service as a professor. The following year, she returned to Mexico and moved to the city of Cuernavaca. To this day, she continues writing, painting, teaching and receiving recognition for her literary contributions.  Manifest of relativist drama  In 1961, during the process of writing the play En las manos de uno Auto no sacramental, Del Río Reyes was in favor of a renovation of drama and wrote a manifest titled Por un teatro relativista [In pro of Relativist Drama]. That play and the others that follow it in 1962: Miralina, Claudia y Arnot and El hijo de trapo were products of her new theater. These three plays in this orientation were published by Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) in 1965. In her manifest “Por un teatro relativista” [In pro of Relativist Drama], Del Río Reyes proposes the creation of “un teatro que establezca vínculos con una realidad dinámica” [a drama that establishes ties with a dynamic reality](3).“Por un teatro relativista.” Excélsior 7 noviembre 1965: 3. According to her dramatic proposal, drama is not able to show life as something static, but rather as an always changing process in movement. Del Río Reyes explains in her manifest that each moment of reality is lived by each person that participates in that reality in a different way. For that reason, a permanent reality does not exist, because there is not just one reality, but so many in which individuals participate in that moment. Thus, drama should show an infinite quantity of a person's identification with himself or herself and the infinite forms with the people that surround him or her.

It takes its name from the tombs discovered in the locality of Laterza, near Taranto, and Cellino San Marco, near Brindisi, in Apulia. The Eneolithic Laterza Civilization (or the Laterza Culture) is an Eneolithic culture which developed in a number of regions of Southern and to a lesser extent of Central Italy in the 3rd millennium BC, around 2950-2350 BC. As with many of the cultures of the late prehistoric period, it is known essentially from the style of pottery recovered from archaeological digs. The culture was defined in 1967 by Francesco Biancofiore, following research in a necropolis of the same name situated to the north-west of the city of Taranto, in southern Apulia.

It was established in 1974 at Kangar, making it as the third oldest UiTM campus in the whole country. In 1980, the campus moved to their permanent location in Arau. Now, UiTM Perlis is the largest branch campus around the country, by the number of student and also the total courses offered. History Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) has substantially evolved over the past 50 years through an era of continued progress. This includes the change in name from Institut Teknologi MARA to Universiti Teknologi MARA in 1999. Befitting the occasion, Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong is designated the Chancellor of the university . As the third oldest branch campus, UiTM Perlis is also the largest UiTM branch campus, after the main campus in Shah Alam. It is a premier institution of higher learning in Perlis.

The main partners of this program are the World Bank, IMF, UN, ADB, OECD, CISSTAT, Eurostat, AfDB ESCWA, ECLAC, DFID, ABS, IDB, NMoFA who are also all part of the executive board. The Program produces internationally comparable price and volume measures for gross domestic product (GDP). Its component expenditures are based on purchasing power parities (PPPs). The International Comparison Program holds surveys collecting price and expenditure data for the entire range of final goods and services at intervals of some few years (the last two were separated by six years). The surveys cover GDPs of countries including their consumer goods, services, government services and capital goods. The ICP tries to make different countries GDPs comparable by calculating them in PPP both currency converters and spatial price deflators. The responsibility for the ICP within regions is shared between the national and regional agencies which represent various countries. National statistical offices carry out data collection but regional agencies provide guidance, collection, coordinating of data and data validation. Regional agencies also put together and finalize the regional comparisons. The ICP has published its PPP results eight times so far – the first time for 1970 (a preliminary study for 1967 was also carried out) and the latest for 2011.

The episode aired on May 6, 2014 in the United States on FX. It was written by series creator and showrunner Noah Hawley and directed by Randall Einhorn. The title refers to the Zen Buddhist kōan of the same name. In the episode, Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) continues to torment his employer Stavros Milos (Oliver Platt), making him go through biblical plague-like events. Meanwhile, Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman) desperately tries to escape the hitmen Mr. Wrench (Russell Harvard) and Mr. Numbers (Adam Goldberg). It establishes a direct link between the series and the 1996 film of the same name it is based on. \\"Eating the Blame\\" received critical acclaim, and was seen by 1.70 million viewers. Plot In a flashback to 1987, the Milos family runs out of gas along a deserted highway in winter. Stranded and heavily in debt, Stavros Milos prays for help. Stepping outside the car, he finds a briefcase of money buried in the snow and takes it as a sign from God. In the film Fargo, the suitcase had been buried there by Carl Showalter, who was later murdered without having revealed its location to anyone else. Nineteen years later, Chumph, disguised as a plumber, tells Stavros that everything appears normal in his pipes, and suggests the shower of blood is similar to a biblical plague. Stavros grabs Chumph from his neck and tells him off. Chumph tells him he is crazy and leaves, while Stavros worries about what Chumph said. Outside, Lorne Malvo was watching from a distance. Gus Grimly spots Malvo by Stavros' house and arrests him. He informs Molly Solverson, and when she requests to go to Duluth, Oswalt refuses her and goes instead. Malvo produces identification as \\"Frank Peterson,\\" a Lutheran minister from Baudette, and has an alibi. Molly learns Malvo's name and calls Grimly, but Malvo (as Peterson) has already been released. Malvo and Chumph release hundreds of crickets into Stavros's supermarket, simulating a plague of locusts, to further entice Stavros into paying the blackmail money. Meanwhile, Lester Nygaard is abducted by Numbers and Wrench who intend to kill him, but he escapes. Fleeing, he finds a police officer issuing a ticket for a car parked on the side of the road. Nygaard punches him to get arrested. Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers witness this and later stage a bar fight to get arrested, and end up in the same cell with Lester. Reception =Ratings= The episode was first aired in the US on FX on May 6, 2014 and obtained 1.70 million viewers. The show was aired in the UK on Channel 4 on May 11, 2014 and was seen by 1.3 million viewers. =Critical reception= The episode received critical acclaim. It currently holds a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The A.V. Club writers Emily VanDerWerff and Zack Handlen gave the episode an A- rating. IGN's Roth Cornet gave the episode an 8.9/10 \\"great\\" rating and said \\"The fourth episode of Fargo gave us lots to chew on. What's great about this series is that it raises legitimately interesting questions about human nature, but it does so in an entirely entertaining package. It seems possible that we're watching Lester make a slow evolution from prey to predator, but Lorne Malvo - at present - remains the unequivocal alpha.\\"  References   External links  * 2014 American television episodes Fargo (TV series) episodes ","title":"Eating the Blame"},{"id":"42947047","text":"Coelostathma cocoana is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

The red brick building operated as a shelter for the poor, take care of the sick, disabled, mentally unwell, widowed, and orphaned persons in the community until . The goal of the almshouse was to both help break the cycle of poverty and to care for members of the community who had no means of caring take of themselves. The building was demolished on February 5, 2010. History In the early 19th century New York communities sought a more permanent and centralized solution for paupers, a group which included the poor, sick, orphaned, homeless, and the mentally ill. The Broome County Poor Farm was created in 1833, opening with 19 inmates that were declared wards of the state by the Superintendents of the Poor. In the early decades of its creations, “the courts would send those without a fixed residence or income either to jail or to the poor farm for “pauperism”‘. Other reasons for residency included idiocy, lunacy, blindness, sickness, old age, children with sick or destitute parents, deaf and dumb and \\"women with sick husbands”. During the mid 19th century, the diagnoses, treatment, and attitude towards mental illness, mental and physical disability allowed for and was found to be practical to lump people with a wide vary of incapacities together with the sick and poor. Young orphans and the elderly were large percentages of the early inmates. Before the Child Care Act of 1875, which no longer allowed children from the age of four to fifteen as residents of poor farms, orphans and children of sick and incapable parents lived, worked, and slept alongside the resident inmates. Concerning the elderly, for those unable or unwilling to take care of ailing or aging geriatric family, the poor farm took on the role of a nursing home. Some families gave small sums of money to the poor farm for the act of ”caring” for the members of their family. The inmates lived a very structured life, consisting of small meals, cramped and dirty living conditions, and for those capable, long hours of work in the farm fields. There was no smoking, drinking, cursing, or any recreational activates of any kind. Violation of these rules was punishable by solitary confinement with only bread and water for nourishment. In 1855 the Board of Supervisors of Broome County started including the residents in the census for the county. However it is known that in 1831, 19 people were living in the Almshouse. They were declared wards of the county and were cared for at a rate of forty cents per person weekly. The superintendent's plan was daily work for all that were able, with no recreation, smoking was prohibited unless you have a special permit, no letters could be sent or received without permission and inspection from the superintendent, and the residents could not leave the campus. The only form of literature allowed were for religious and moral studies. If a resident broke a rule or was disobedient they would be forced into solitary confinement with a diet on bread and water. In 1861 Milo D. Payne was appointed as Keeper of the Alms House with a duty to manage the residence and farm. He had the residents work the farm and do their chores but now they were well fed and clothed. Payne handled the money carefully and economically and as a result of his care and management the Almshouse and residents started to thrive. As care of the insane began shifting to state institutions began in 1890, it resulted in a reduction of \\"able bodied workers\\". In 1923 an infirmary was built for the inmates. Fees for the inmates were $5.66. The buildings, now segregated for women and men, were modernized. The Almshouse became a more humanitarian and modernized way to care for the residents. Additional facilities included a bakery and laundry. By 1929 the almshouse went through many new revised laws. Residents were now able to leave the facility after obtaining a pass indicating the date, the time they left, and when they must return. Another law required all purchases by the residents were to be known and logged by the current keeper. Closed as an almshouse in the 1960s the structure and property were incorporated into the Broome Technical Community College and used for classroom space. Demolition Beginning in 1978, consideration was made to demolish the remaining structures, now located on the campus of SUNY Broome. It was estimated to cost 2-4 million dollars to properly renovate the building. After sitting vacant for 10 years it was deemed \\"unsafe\\" and \\"beyond repair\\". Arguments for preserving the facility included being the last remaining physical evidence of the historic poor house, potential reuse and relocation of the building, which subsequently was determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The almshouse was demolished on February 5, 2010 at a cost between $700,000 and $800,000 shared between the state and county, and was part of a 10-year plan to improve the college.

It is the sequel to 2012's Forza Horizon and the seventh instalment in the Forza series. The Xbox One version of the game was developed by Playground Games, the team behind the original Forza Horizon, while Sumo Digital developed the version for Xbox 360, with Forza series developer Turn 10 Studios supporting both builds. The Xbox 360 version is also the final Forza game released for the platform. The game received positive reviews from critics and a sequel, Forza Horizon 3, was released on 27 September 2016. Gameplay Gameplay in Forza Horizon 2. Here the player races the Lamborghini Veneno against opponents. Forza Horizon 2 is a racing video game, featuring an open world environment. The player participates in the Horizon Festival, a fictional racing competition set within Southern France and Northern Italy. The game has approximately three times more drivable area than that of its predecessor Forza Horizon, with events set in Provence, Liguria and Côte d'Azur, among other regions. Players will explore the region, taking part in races and special events in order to advance through the game. Events can take place at day or night, and a dynamic weather system was added for the first time in a Forza-series game. Among new features in the game are \\"Bucket Lists\\", three groups of timed challenges for the player to complete, similar to the 1000 Club in Forza Horizon. They can be completed in solo or co-op mode (when a player goes to the online version of the map, they can be completed with a random person or invited friend). These challenges are continuously updated to provide new challenges throughout the map. Car Meets are an online mode where players can meet up online and compare their cars, similar to \\"Forzavista\\" mode in Forza Motorsport 5. Players are also able to interact with each other in Car Meets, including sharing tuning setups and liveries. In the online version of the game, races such as circuits, sprints, and cross country are playable against other players, along with other game types such as Infected and King. The standalone expansion of the game based on The Fast and the Furious franchise, Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious, added nitrous oxide boosts to the Forza series. Unlike other racing games however, nitrous can only be used during most of the game's events, and only replenishes at the very start of said events. Development and release Promotion at Gamescom 2014 Forza Horizon 2 is the second game in the series to be developed principally by a studio other than Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 Studios. Playground Games, the lead developer for Forza Horizon, focused on the Xbox One version, using the graphics engine from Forza Motorsport 5 as their starting point. While the engine is capable of displaying content 1080p and 60 frames-per-second, the game was locked at 1080p and 30 frames-per-second, which was deemed necessary because of the game's open-world nature. According to creative director Ralph Fulton, \\"one of the big technical challenges that we had to face was making sure that we could stream in a world that is next-gen beautiful, but fast enough to keep up with the fastest car.\\" Sumo Digital took the lead for the Xbox 360 version, starting from the original Forza Horizon graphics engine. As with the original game, Turn 10 Studios provided support to the primary developers. The Xbox 360 version does not include the weather system such as rain or \\"drivatar\\" A.I. found in the more-powerful Xbox One version, and also omits tuning and the free-roam open-world (as very few barriers can be broken through and crossed), with Playground Games calling the two versions \\"different games\\". Chevrolet Camaro have been added to the game On 22 July 2014, Turn 10 Studios revealed the first 100 of over 200 cars to be featured in the open world game, from exotics, rally cars, trucks, hot hatches, among others. Many cars from the Forza series return, including many cars from the original Horizon game. The list includes the 2014 Lamborghini Huracán LP610-4 and Veneno, the McLaren P1, the LaFerrari, the Agera, and the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport. Another new car that they had released was the Ford Capri RS3100 which is a barn find. All ten barn finds can be found off-road, usually in hidden places. When choosing the locale for Forza Horizon 2, the developers investigated over 30 locations around the world, including California and Australia, ultimately choosing Southern Europe. Creative director Ralph Fulton cited Europe's \\"fantastic driving roads, amazing environmental diversity, and just stunning vistas that you really want to explore\\" as some of the major points in selecting it for Horizon 2. Fulton also noted that most of the recent open-world driving games were set in North America and that Southern Europe \\"just felt fresh, it felt different, it felt new, and it was a gimme for us\\". On 27 August 2014, Microsoft announced that a demo version of the game would be made available on Xbox One on 16 September 2014. On the day of the demo release, Microsoft confirmed that the game had been declared gold, indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release. The standard \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" of the Xbox One version (consisting of the base game and the 10th Anniversary Car Pack) was given to Xbox Live Gold members for free throughout August 2018 as part of Microsoft's Games with Gold program. Forza Horizon 2 and its downloadable content were digitally delisted on 1 October 2018. Those who already own it can still download and play the game and its DLC. =Expansions= On 16 December 2014, Microsoft launched \\"Storm Island\\", an expansion pack for the Xbox One edition of the game. Storm Island adds, along with the new setting and associated tracks, five new event types, an expansion of the game engine's weather system, five new vehicles and an additional barn- find car. On 25 February 2015, Microsoft announced Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious, a standalone expansion to promote the release of Furious 7. The expansion was released on 27 March 2015. The expansion added music from Furious 7, composed by Brian Tyler, exclusively for the Showcase events. In June 2015, Microsoft announced a new Porsche expansion pack for the game that was released on 9 June 2015. The expansion, which was authorized by Electronic Arts, the then license-holder for Porsche vehicles in video games, adds ten vehicles, such as the 944, 911 GT3 RS, the Macan Turbo and the Cayman GT4. The expansion also adds new Bucket List items, new Rivals events and 15 new achievements based around the Porsche models. Reception The Xbox One version of Forza Horizon 2 received highly positive reviews. It received an aggregated score of 86.25% on GameRankings based on 53 reviews and 86/100 on Metacritic based on 82 reviews. Writing for IGN, Luke Reilly said that the game had \\"comprehensively updated\\" the standards for open-world racing games and that it was \\"Test Drive Unlimited, PGR, Smuggler’s Run, and Forza Motorsport all crammed into a T-shirt cannon and fired into your face\\". Conversely, Polygon's Arthur Gies, while giving the game a positive review, said that the track design in Forza Horizon 2 \\"can't compete\\" with the licensed tracks used in Forza Motorsport 5. Jonathan Leack of CraveOnline called the game \\"racing paradise\\" and \\"a highly enjoyable destination for anyone willing to buckle up behind a wheel\\". Leack also compared the two separate versions of the game and discovered a number of differences. As an example, when players are given the option to choose their first car at the start of the game, the Xbox 360 version uses a graphic interface, while the Xbox One version lets the players choose the cars in-world. Calling the Xbox One version a \\"system-seller\\" and \\"a good time to invest in next-gen\\", Leack said that Sumo Digital \\"has done a fantastic job\\" with the Xbox 360 version and that it was \\"one of the best-looking racing games on the platform\\".

In 1961, Cuba aimed to eradicate illiteracy in one year. It sent 250,000 volunteers across the island to teach reading and writing in rural communities for one year. 100,000 of the volunteers were under 18 and more than half of them were women. In 2004, Murphy discovered that she knew several women in Havana who had volunteered for the project; they were in their 60s. Murphy was due to return to the United States, but before doing so, she decided to record three interviews with former Literacy Campaign volunteers. From 2004 to 2010, Murphy continued to track down stories of Literacy Campaign volunteers and the families that hosted them, eventually producing and directing Maestra and founding The Literacy Project.Maestra Vanderbilt Curriculum Guide, Center for Latin American Studies, Vanderbilt University The film is narrated in English by Pulitzer Prize–winning author Alice Walker and features Spanish-language interviews (with English subtitles) with nine of the women who taught in the Campaign.MAESTRAWomen Make Movies Maestra features interviews with Norma Guillard, one of the first Cuban women to call herself a feminist, and Diana Balboa, one of the first open members of Cuba's LGBT community and an international advocate for gay and lesbian rights.

Playing career Born in Torres Novas, Santarém District, Casquilha played 19 years as a senior. He started out at local Clube Desportivo Torres Novas, then alternated between the second and third divisions in the following seasons. Casquilha made his debut in the Primeira Liga in the 1999–2000 campaign, aged already 30: alongside future S.L. Benfica and Portugal star Petit, he was an essential midfield unit for Gil Vicente F.C. who finished a best-ever fifth position, scoring three goals in 32 games. After helping the Barcelos club always retain its league status, and having amassed totals in the Portuguese top flight of 177 matches and 11 goals, 36-year-old Casquilha left and signed for S.C. Espinho in the third level, following which he retired. Coaching career Casquilha began coaching in 2006, immediately after retiring. He started with amateurs Santa Maria FC, which he guided to the second place in the AF Braga regional championships. In quick succession, he then worked with Merelinense F.C. and C.A. Valdevez, guiding the latter to the last 16 in the Taça de Portugal in 2007–08. In summer 2009, Casquilha was appointed at Moreirense F.C. in division three. He achieved promotions in 2010 and 2012, the latter signifying a return to the top tier after an absence of seven years. On 30 January 2013, after only one win in the first 16 league games of the season, Casquilha was relieved of his duties. Highlights included, however, a 3–2 home win over Sporting CP for the domestic cup after extra time. On 6 March 2014, Casquilha signed a deal with second division side Leixões S.C. until the end of the campaign. On 30 April, however, he was suspended due to comments he made in an interview which were regarded as inappropriate and detrimental to the club's name and history. Casquilha returned to management in December 2014, taking over at U.D. Leiria in the third level. He was dismissed in March 2016, after failing with the board's aim to win promotion. Still in March 2016, Casquilha returned to the second tier with Académico de Viseu F.C. as their third manager of the campaign. In January 2017, he was hired at fellow league team C.F. União. On 26 May 2017, Casquilha moved to his former club Gil Vicente. He left on 28 December, as they were placed 15th in the standings. Halfway through 2018–19, Casquilha rejoined Leixões after the dismissal of Filipe Gouveia. After taking the team to seventh place, he left at the end of his contract for C.D. Cova da Piedade in the same league. He quit on 15 December, with the side last-placed with seven points.

In 2001 he won first place in the International Naumburg Competition, and in 2004 he received an Avery Fisher Career Grant. Newman was born in Albany NY in 1977, to Australian parents. At six he began taking cello lessons, and at 12 he received his first significant public recognition when he won a gold medal at the Dandenong Festival in Australia, open to ages twenty-four and under. Newman went on to attend the Columbia-Juilliard combined program, receiving a BA in English from Columbia and a Masters in Music from Juilliard. His teachers at Juilliard were Joel Krosnick and Harvey Shapiro.  Solo work  In 2001, Newman won first place in the International Naumburg Competition, and as a result he played a recital in Alice Tully Hall. The recital included the world premiere of Kenji Bunch's \\"Broken Music\\", which the Naumburg Foundation commissioned. In 2004, he was the recipient of an Avery Fisher Career Grant. His performance of his composition, \\"The Pizzicato Piece\\", was featured on A&E;'s \\"Breakfast With the Arts\\". Newman has performed as soloist in Australia, Asia, and Europe, as well as throughout the United States. He has soloed with such orchestras as the National Symphony, Jacksonville Symphony, Hartford Symphony, Richmond Symphony, Santa Fe Symphony, and North Carolina Symphony, in such halls as Alice Tully, Avery Fisher, Weill, Merkin, Jordan Hall, the Kennedy Center, the Kimmel Center, and Herbst Theatre. Chamber music Clancy Newman has attended the Marlboro Music Festival and has been a member of the Chamber Music Society II of Lincoln Center. He is currently a member of the Chicago Chamber Musicians and the Clarosa piano quartet, and a former member of the Weiss-Kaplan-Newman trio (with pianist Yael Weiss and violinist Mark Kaplan). Composing Newman has maintained an interest in composition since early childhood, and the bulk of his output has been for chamber music and cello solo. He has been a featured composer on the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's \\"Double Exposure\\" series and the Chicago Chamber Musicians' \\"Composer Perspectives\\" series, and has received commissions from Astral Artists, the Barnett Foundation, the Carpe Diem String Quartet, the Weiss-Kaplan-Newman trio, and the Silo Collective, among others. His Juxt-Opposition is available on a CD of new American music by the Weiss- Kaplan-Newman trio, alongside those of Paul Schoenfield, Lera Auerbach, and Chen Yi. His new piano quintet, Cherry Blossom Fantasy, commissioned by the Ryuji Ueno Foundation, will be premiered at the opening ceremony of the 2019 National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington DC. \\"Pop-Unpopped\\" project From October 2014 until May 2016, Newman did a project that he called \\"Pop- Unpopped\\". This involved writing a solo cello caprice inspired by whatever song was number 1 on the US billboard charts on the first of each month, which he would then learn and post a video of himself playing at the end of the month. In this fashion, he wrote caprices based on songs by Ed Sheeran, Meghan Trainor, Taylor Swift and many others. The project ultimately led to extremely innovative new ways of playing the cello, including fingering with the right hand, plucking behind the finger, extensive col legno, bowing behind the bridge, and drumming. The Golden Ratio Method In 2007, Newman devised a new method of composing based on the way some types of trees grow new branches using the golden ratio.

The college was established in 2003 and started its first class in 2004. Jersey College has five other locations in New Jersey and Florida.  History  Established in 2003, Jersey College nursing school was founded in New Jersey by Greg Karzhevsky and originally called The Center for Allied Health & Nursing Education. The aim of the institution was to develop highly trained and skilled nurses to work at Loving Care Agency, New Jersey's largest home care agency, run by the Karzhevsky family. The agency originally employed over 600 registered nurses and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) and provided pediatric services to medically fragile children. In 2004, The Center was approved by the New Jersey Board of Nursing to offer a Practical Nursing Program. The Center expanded its student body and increased its staff of instructors and administrators. In 2007, following its national accreditation from The Council on Occupational Education and approval from the United States Department of Education, the school opened a second campus in Tampa, FL. The South Jersey campus in Ewing, NJ opened shortly after in 2009. The school was awarded approval for a Professional Nursing Program in 2010 and opened the Jacksonville campus. The Fort Lauderdale campus was created in 2012. In November of that year, the school received approval from the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education and the New Jersey Board of Nursing to offer a Registered Nursing Program with an associate degree. The Center for Allied Health and Nursing Education changed its name to Jersey College to coincide with the pursuit of higher education opportunities. The college has produced more than 1,700 graduates in the nursing field. In July 2014, the Jersey College campus at Tampa, Florida expanded to a 40,000 square foot facility in Sabal Park, that includes two floors of observation rooms, computer labs, simulation labs, classrooms, a library, and a cafeteria. In 2016, Jersey College added its sixth campus through a partnership with Largo Medical Center by establishing a campus inside of the Indian Rocks campus of Largo Medical Center in Largo, Florida. The Largo campus hosts the Nurse Residency track of the Professional Nursing program.  Campuses  Jersey College has six locations in New Jersey and Florida: *Teterboro, NJ (main campus) *Ewing, NJ *Tampa, FL *Jacksonville, FL *Fort Lauderdale, FL *Largo, FL  Academics  Jersey College offers two programs. The Practical Nursing or \\"LPN\\" Program prepares students for careers in Licensed Practical Nursing. The program includes theoretical instruction on the foundations of practical nursing and clinical experience in practicing patient care. The program covers basic anatomy, disease processes, medications, treatments, care planning, and preparation for NCLEX-PN licensing examination. The Professional Nursing or \\"RN\\" Program consists of three tracks. The generic track is for students starting their nursing education who aim to become registered nurses. The bridge track allows already licensed LPNs to become registered nurses. The Nurse Residency track is a hospital-based program housed at Largo Medical Center. Graduates receive an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in Nursing in New Jersey and an Associate of Science (AS) degree in Nursing in Florida. The program covers medical- surgical, geriatric, maternal, pediatric, and mental health topics as well as preparation for the NCLEX-RN examination. =Accreditation and licensing= Jersey College has received accreditation and licensing from the following organizations: * 2004 New Jersey Board of Nursing * 2007 Council on Occupational Education * 2008 Florida Board of Nursing * 2008 Florida Commission for Independent Education * 2012 New Jersey Commission on Higher Education * 2018 Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, :* Associate Degree (RN) Program, Fort Lauderdale Campus :* Associate Degree (RN) Program, Jacksonville Campus :* Associate Degree (RN) Program, Tampa Campus :*Associate Degree (RN) Program, Teterboro Campus :*Associate Degree (RN) Program, Ewing Campus :*Associate Degree (RN) Program, Largo Campus References External links Nursing schools in New Jersey Nursing schools in Florida Education in Bergen County, New Jersey Education in Mercer County, New Jersey Ewing Township, New Jersey Education in Fort Lauderdale, Florida Education in Jacksonville, Florida Education in Tampa, Florida 2003 establishments in New Jersey Private universities and colleges in Florida Private universities and colleges in New Jersey Universities and colleges in Bergen County, New Jersey ","title":"Jersey College"},{"id":"42947386","text":"Gnomidolon conjugatum is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

It is named after the message sent by the BBC's Radio Londres at 9:15 pm on June 5, 1944 announcing the imminent invasion of Normandy. The museum consists of the concrete bunker where the German Wehrmacht intercepted the message.  History  Following the Battle of France, the German 15th Army established its headquarters at Tourcoing. The 15th Army was deployed in Normandy and the Netherlands. The headquarters consisted of thirteen concrete blockhouses. These protected the occupiers against air strikes and chemical weapons. German soldiers with small arms and machine guns controlled physical access to the bunkers. During Allied planning for Operation Overlord, the actual date of D-Day needed to be kept secret, but the Allies depended on cooperation with the French Resistance. On 1 June 1944, a message was broadcast over Radio London to inform the Resistance that the invasion could be expected within 2 weeks. The first message consisted of the first three lines of Paul Verlaine's poem Chanson d'automne: Les sanglots longs des violons d'automne (\\"The long sobs of autumn violins\\"). On 5 June, at 9:15 pm (London time), Radio London broadcast a second message: the next three lines from the same poem. Blessent mon coeur d'une longeur monotone, or \\"Wound my heart with a monotonous languor\\", meant that the invasion was to begin within 48 hours. The Resistance was supposed to increase its efforts against German supply lines, especially railroads, in anticipation of D-Day. At Tourcoing on 5 June, the 15th Army Headquarters intercepted the message. It was 23:45 (French local time).  The museum today  The largest of the thirteen blockhouses, a Type SK1 Bunker number 381, was converted to a museum. It is dedicated to the installations of the Nazi occupation of France and how those installations worked. The rooms most important to the bunker's wartime function — the generators, ventilators, telephone exchange and translation department, as well as the general's office, kitchen and guard post, are open for public view and are restored to wartime appearance.

It was best-known as the home of William Rockefeller, brother of John D. Rockefeller, both co-founders of the Standard Oil Company. Other owners of the house or property included Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, William Henry Aspinwall, and Lloyd Aspinwall. The property was once up to in size; the mansion at its height had 204 rooms, making it the second-largest private house in the U.S. at the time, only behind the Biltmore mansion in North Carolina. The estate is currently an section of the Rockefeller State Park Preserve. Among the first people to live on the property was Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, who lived there from 1840 to 1848. Edwin Bartlett, a wealthy merchant, subsequently purchased the site and hired Gervase Wheeler to design a house on the property, which was constructed in 1849. By 1860, Bartlett sold the house to William Henry Aspinwall, who lived there until 1875; his son Lloyd lived at the house until 1886. William Rockefeller purchased the estate and likely extensively renovated the house and property, hiring the firm Carrère and Hastings for interior renovations. Rockefeller died there in 1922, and his heirs sold it to investors, who turned the house and property into Rockwood Hall Country Club. The club became bankrupt in 1936, after which it became the Washington Irving Country Club. By 1940, the property lay empty again, so its owner John D. Rockefeller Jr. had most of the property's buildings razed, including the mansion. In late 1946, the Rockwood Hall property was proposed for the location of the United Nations headquarters. John Jr.'s son Laurance Rockefeller sold some of the property to IBM in 1970. IBM's property was later bought by New York Life, followed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, the current owner. The remaining property was sold to New York State at a significantly reduced price to become parkland within Rockefeller State Park. History =Early history= One of the early owners of the property was Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, who lived in a farmhouse there from 1840 until his death in 1848. Section 4, 7, and 32 Commodore Matthew C. Perry was accustomed to spending part of the summer with his wife in cottages near Mackenzie's farm. In 1839, Perry purchased a neighboring parcel and built a stone house, named The Moorings. They settled into this home as a year-round residence with their children. Around 1853 or 1854, Perry sold the country estate and moved back to New York City. Importer and merchant Edwin Bartlett obtained the property around 1848, demolished the farmhouse, and built Rockwood, an English Gothic castle of locally-quarried stone. Bartlett hired Gervase Wheeler to design the house, which was built in 1849. Architectural sketch of Rockwood's central hall, with renovations by Carrère and Hastings Bartlett sold the house to his business partner William Henry Aspinwall in 1860; Aspinwall made it his summer home and improved the property and house, and purchased enough land to make his estate . Aspinwall would often travel from New York City to the property via his yacht Firefly, which he could moor to his dock at Rockwood Hall. Upon his death in 1875, his son Lloyd Aspinwall lived there until his own death, in 1886. William Avery Rockefeller, Jr. then purchased it for $150,000. His residence in Mount Pleasant persuaded his brother, John D. Rockefeller, to build his estate Kykuit in nearby Pocantico Hills. Rockefeller expanded his property to about and either renovated or rebuilt the castle, nearly doubling its size. Some sources, including Rockefeller himself, claim he entirely rebuilt the house, and used the old stone to construct a new barn or stables. Including Rockefeller's purchase of the property, he spent about $3 million ($ in ) on the house. He spared no expense in making it fit his characteristics and lifestyle, and even had little idea how much he would spend on it during its construction. Rockefeller hired Ebenezer L. Roberts to oversee the construction, though Roberts died in 1890, during the house's renovation. He also hired noted architectural firm Carrère and Hastings to create plans for interior renovation of the house. Rockefeller also spent $6,000 to repave a two-mile stretch of road with macadam from the Vanderbilt Shepard home Woodlea to Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Rockefeller paid for the paving in order to travel easily from Rockwood Hall to the Tarrytown railroad station. The resulting 204-room house was 174 x 104 feet and was the second-largest private house in the U.S. at the time, only behind the Biltmore mansion in Asheville, North Carolina. It was estimated at the time as second only to the Biltmore in cost as well, and as second to Kykuit in its extent of land and value, within Westchester County. Rockefeller moved into the newly-renovated house around May 1890. In 1895, Rockefeller's daughter Emma married David Hunter McAlpin, Jr., son of David Hunter McAlpin in a ceremony at the house. Much of the house was decorated for the event. In 1914, during the Colorado Coalfield War, the Rockefeller brothers' properties of Rockwood Hall and Kykuit were the site of rioting and potential home invasion. Tarrytown village president Frank Pierson protected the homes, gathering more police and leading the effort to suppress the rioters and drive them away from the homes. Rockefeller intended the house to be his summer retreat, yet in his later years it became his year-round home. In 1922, Rockefeller died within Rockwood Hall, leaving the property empty. His funeral took place in Rockwood Hall, with a service by the rector of Saint Mary's Episcopal Church, which Rockefeller regularly attended. The gates of the estate were closed and guarded by policemen during the affair. =As country club= Rockefeller's heirs put the property up for sale, however no individual buyer could be found. At this point, the mansion was closed, its furnishings were removed, and about 20 caretakers were tending to the property. The first breakup of his property was a sale to Frank Vanderlip. In 1924, Vanderlip purchased 57 acres of Rockwood Hall's riverfront property to add to his estate, Beechwood. The bulk of the estate was purchased that same year by a group of investors, who formed Rockwood Hall, Inc. Their company purchased the property (with 210 acres west of Route 9 and 600 acres east) for around $1 million. The group converted the estate into a country club with a golf course, a swimming pool, and other facilities. The company formed Rockwood Hall Country Club and took out a mortgage with the Equitable Trust Company of New York, which was acquired by Chase Bank in 1930. Its 18-hole golf course was designed by Emmet & Tull in 1929. Rockwood Hall Country Club hired noted Australian golfer Joe Kirkwood Sr. to be the club's first golf professional. In 1927, Rockefeller's nephew John D. Rockefeller Jr. purchased 450 acres across Route 9 from Rockwood. In the following year, the Rockwood Hall club sold 166.5 acres of its own land east of Route 9 to John Jr., in order to settle or reduce two of its mortgages. By 1928, the club was profitable enough to plan to expand its property; the club planned for a second golf course on an adjacent property, as well as adjustments to most of its existing course and construction of four tennis courts and an outdoor pool. In the same year, Frederic N. Gilbert was removed as a member of the country club for allegedly trying to obtain control of it. Frank Harris Hitchcock was President of the club at the time, and had been the club's first president. Gilbert took legal action against the club. The Rockwood Hall club was building up debts, especially during the Great Depression, which began in 1929. The club was ultimately not financially successful, and declared bankruptcy in 1936. During the summer of 1937, Rockwood Hall Country Club leased the house and grounds to the Washington Irving Country Club and the coachhouse and stable to the Washington Irving Theater during Rockwood's foreclosure suit. The coachhouse and stable were remodeled and began showing summer productions beginning in 1938 and ending by 1940. =Demolition= Chase National Bank had acquired Rockwood's mortgage and began foreclosing on the property. In 1938, John Jr. purchased Rockwood Hall Country Club and its 220 acres from Chase Bank for $244,374 in bankruptcy court. By 1941, John Jr. found no use for the site and its buildings were deteriorating severely, so he prepared to demolish the buildings. In late 1941 and early 1942, John Jr. ordered the demolition of the mansion, coachhouse, greenhouses, powerhouse, barn, chicken house, pigeonhouse, sheds, and boathouse; only excluding the two gatehouses. Debris was to be dumped into the Hudson River, and care was taken to not damage the property's retaining walls, trees, shrubs, roads, and terraces. The last remaining structures are the gatehouse on U.S. Route 9 and the terraced foundation of the mansion. =Property redevelopment= Rockefeller Jr. deeded Rockwood Hall to his son Laurance Rockefeller on April 8, 1946. Later that year, the property was proposed for the location of the United Nations headquarters. It was one of a few proposals for the site, and was given by Laurance and Nelson Rockefeller for free. Officials of Westchester County had previously proposed the same site. Their father, John Jr., was cautious about the proposal, believing that the site's occupancy would prompt the UN's expansion onto other Rockefeller properties nearby in Pocantico Hills, and possibly even Kykuit, the family's seat. Laurance and Nelson, along with their brothers David and John, were all willing to give up their estates to make the site location possible. John Jr. expressed that the nature of the countryside in Westchester would be irrevocably changed. He instructed Nelson to inquire further about another proposed site near White Plains, New York, and to see about additional available land near Rockwood. Another reason given for John Jr.'s disapproval of the site was its distance from airports and other transportation available in New York City. New York Life and Regeneron campus Laurance sold 80 acres of the property to IBM in 1970; New York Life later operated out of the site. Laurance had planned to donate Rockwood Hall to New York State, and made the IBM sale to offset the loss of tax revenue to the town of Mount Pleasant. During Laurance's ownership of the remaining land, he made the space available to the public for hiking, fishing, and other recreation. From the early 1970s until 1998, Laurance Rockefeller leased the estate to New York for use as a public park, at a cost of $1 a year, and he covered the maintenance costs of the property. In 1972, he announced he would donate the land to the state. Plans for the public park were to possibly include a center for studying the Hudson River environment. In the meantime, the state commissioned a study of the river around the property, the Rockefellers granted walking tours for 540 residents, and gave them questionnaires to them to gauge reactions. Developers were commissioned to give opinions; the first developers proposed a swimming pool, skating rink, and tennis courts to allow for high-density use of the parkland. Residents indicated on the questionnaires that they preferred passive use of the park: walking trails and a nature center, and no camping or sporting facilities. The project manager proposed a landscaped platform above the Hudson Line tracks, to allow residents direct access to the Hudson River. In 1998, Rockefeller gave the 88 acre property to the Laurance S. Rockefeller Fund, with half of the fund's interest donated to New York State and half to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. At the time, the land was one of few large undeveloped tracts left on the lower Hudson River. New York State subsequently purchased Memorial Sloan Kettering's portion (appraised at $26.8 million) in order to fully own Rockwood Hall. Architecture =Exterior= The house's exterior under Aspinwall's ownership, 1860 Illustration of the western terrace, facing the Hudson River The house was 500 feet east of the Hudson River and 150 feet above it. The building was designed in the castellated Elizabethan style. Under Rockefeller's ownership, the house had dimensions of 174 by 104 feet. Its exterior walls were of massive blocks of rough grey gneiss from quarries in Hastings-on-Hudson, and its interior walls were brick. Its exterior walls were thick by the foundation and 2 feet thick at the upper floors, and were all built on bedrock. The interior walls ran from the cellar to the roof. The building was described as resembling a Scottish castle, related to the Rockefellers' Scottish lineage. The house had two walled terraces at its base, one of which was used as a tennis court; the other was used at the front of the house for the roadway, while the back facing the river was laid with a mosaic. It also had a wide and stone-roofed veranda surrounding the house. Its architectural decorations included towers, turrets, and ported parapets. It was built prominently on a hill, on the highest point of the estate by skilled laborers from Scotland. The house had an asymmetrical scheme, with a square main portion and an L-shaped servants' wing extending north from the main house. The main portion had three stories and an attic. The house had a four-story tower at the southeast corner, which originally had a two-and-a-half-story octagonal tower next to it, with the porte-cochère lying between them. The house originally only had verandas around the major living spaces. The roof was tiled with fire-brick painted red, and had a gilded weather vane. The main entrance was on the north side, under a porte- cochère. The doors were massive and made of intricately carved oak. =Interior= Floorplan of the original first floor, 1860 The interior had 204 rooms, altogether containing 21 fireplaces. The first floor consisted of the entrance hall, a drawing room, library, music room, dining room, breakfast room, billiard room, conservatory, guest dressing room, and study. Two of the house's entrances laid at the western and eastern ends of a hall transversing the house; another hall ran from the north end to the south end. These halls had mosaic floors, walls wainscoted in American oak, and papier-mâché ceilings with a series of domes, each fitted with five electric chandeliers. At the intersection of the two halls was the main staircase to the top floor, making three turns between each floor. The balustrade was made of American oak. Immediately above the staircase was a dome of cathedral glass, while at each half-flight of stairs was a loggia made entirely of tile, separated from the main house by glass, and opening upward to the air. The main entrance was at the north side of the house, by the porte-cochère. This led into a vestibule decorated with mosaics and walled in polished marble, with carved onyx. Past this was the main hall, with American oak walls, a papier mache ceiling, and a carved oak bench between two large carved pillars. It also had a large fireplace of bright orange and white mosaic tiles, with designs of Italian eagles and foliage, and a circular hearthstone 20 feet in diameter. Sunk into the wall to the left and right of the fireplace was a pair of corner seats. To the right of the main hall was a bathroom and coatroom. To its right was the reception room, a room with stained-glass windows, dark mahogany woodwork with inlaid maple, a mosaic-faced fireplace with a mantle of African onyx, and a carved mahogany mantelpiece with carved cherubs supporting a round mirror. The ceiling was gold and the walls were frescoed. Seven electric chandeliers lit the space. The music room, next to the reception room, was colored a delicate green enamel. The walls were paneled satinwood, the ceiling was papier-mâché, and the fireplace was of Pyrian marble, with a small square window above. The room was lit by 250 electric lamps scattered throughout the room in \\"artistic carelessness\\". The library, in the southeast corner of the house, used Circassian walnut wainscoting all the way to the ceiling. The fireplace was of black Levantine marble. Carved oaken chairs were throughout the room. The library was described as dark and sombre as opposed to the light and airy music room, an example of how nearly all of the house's rooms were distinct from the adjoining rooms. The dining room and library opened out onto the south veranda and terrace. The dining room was mahogany, wainscoted almost to the ceiling. The walls were covered with oil paintings. The fireplace was of Siena marble, and a sideboard was of mahogany. The billiard room, in the southwest corner, had a frescoed domed ceiling and a fireplace of light-hued onyx. The breakfast room, in the northeast corner, had wainscoted gum-wood walls, with space between the wainscoting and ceiling featuring inscribed phrases. The ceiling was azure blue, with emblems of the zodiac in gold. The den nearby had red birch walls and ceiling and a painted frieze, along with a yellow tiled fireplace. The house's second and third floors were dedicated to sleeping space, together containing 14 bedrooms. The second floor had five large bedrooms with attached bathrooms and two small bedrooms with attached bathrooms, with fireplaces in each bedroom and the hall. The third floor had six large bedrooms with attached bathrooms, and one bedroom with a separate bath. The third floor shared the same layout of fireplaces. Each bedroom had walls of different kinds of wood, with different designs and frescoes throughout. The attic above the third floor was finished in plain white woodwork, and had about 12 rooms for servants. The servant's wing also contained 15 bedrooms. The round tower contained a smoking room, while the square tower contained a sewing room. The house was heated by hot air through floorboard vents. Electric buttons in the rooms were used to ring electric bells, to call servants. Two Otis elevators ran from the cellar to the attic: one for servants and freight and one elegant elevator for the family and guests. The house was fireproof, such that a fire within a room, with all doors closed, would not spread. As well, the servants' wing was divided from the house by a heavy brick and stone wall to prevent spread of fire. All doors in the house, except those at the main entrance, slid to close. The floors were of highly-polished inlaid American oak. Grounds Map of Rockefeller's immediate property holdings at Rockwood The property is located in the town of Mount Pleasant, in Westchester County, New York. It lies west of U.S. Route 9, then known as Broadway, and 3 miles north of Tarrytown and 1.5 miles south of Scarborough. It was less than one mile from Sleepy Hollow Country Club. The property borders railroad tracks, formerly of the New York Central Railroad and today as Metro-North's Hudson Line. The property also borders the Hudson River for . The lawns and gardens spanned of the property. Corrugated iron fences on concrete fenced off part of the property. During William Rockefeller's ownership, the property was within the tax district of Tarrytown; the current park property extends nearly the entire riverfront from Sleepy Hollow to Briarcliff Manor, and from the Hudson River to Route 9. The mansion's facades were decorated with large pots of tropical plants. To one side of the house, several acres were devoted to pastures for Southdown sheep, described as William Rockefeller's pets. Another pasture held Jersey cattle for production of milk and butter for the mansion and servants. Frederick Law Olmsted designed the landscaped property for William Rockefeller, consisting of hills, dales, woodlands, and meadows. Olmsted had young trees planted and old trees transplanted. He planted rare trees including Golden Oak, Weeping Beech, Purple Beech, Cutleaf Beech, English Beech, American Beech, Ginkgo, Weeping Willow, White, Red and Scarlet Oak, Norway Spruce, Colorado Blue Spruce, Pink Horsechestnut, White and Pink Dogwood, and Dwarf Japanese Maple. These groves blocked view of Rockwood Hall from Route 9. A formal garden, 150 x 60 feet, lay in front of the house, along with a 2-acre flower garden, a 3 1/4 acre vegetable garden, 17 greenhouses, and a gardener's cottage. Two streams and several artificial ponds existed on the property, which had swans and ducks in the summertime. Rockwood Hall and surrounds, 1916 Rockwood Hall's gardens, 1916 The landscape included a network of winding carriage roads through the woods. The roads were wide with an 8-inch crown in the middle; a large drainage system was built in to control flooding. Two miles of the roads used Hastings block, a paving stone constructed in nearby Hastings-on-Hudson; the remaining roads were made of compacted crushed stone. Outbuildings included a three-story stable, a carpenter's shop, paint shop, stone ice house, farm barn, hennery, 17 greenhouses, and a four-acre outdoor nursery for 1,000 rare trees and shrubs. Also on the property was a boathouse, dock, a spring, and an electric lighting plant. Rockefeller also built a shed for his private train car, built next to and parallel to the New York Central tracks by his property. The stone ice house on the property used rock salt to preserve meats and vegetables. The main granite stable had 40 stalls, an indoor riding court, and a gallery. The coach house had housing on its second floor for the families of the stable employees. The stone boathouse had numerous boats and a steam-based launch. The farm barn had 32 stalls for cows and stables for farm horses and sheep. Rockefeller kept Jersey cattle and Southdown sheep (used to trim the lawns). The poultry plant was used to house chickens, ducks, pheasants, and pigeons. The boathouse was reached by a 150-foot steel bridge over the railroad tracks. It was built around 1913 and had six dressing rooms, a bathroom, and a sitting room with a fireplace, along with yachts, rowboats, and canoes. 50 feet north of the boathouse was the 135 x 35 ft. dock. Pipes for oil and water were laid between the power house and dock, for fueling boats and launching them. About 600 to 700 yards from the house were the two stable buildings, mostly hidden from view by dense shrubbery. The buildings were built using granite taken from the mansion during Rockefeller's renovations. Together the stables contained housing for the estate superintendent, about 50 stalls for horses, space for carriages, a gallery, riding court, and a large court with a wood floor for indoor sports. The farmland on the property was primarily used to grow hay and potatoes. The grounds also had two small brooks running through them which carried trout. During Rockwood Hall's inhabitance, the property had three entrances. Two had stone gatehouses on one side of the entrance, while the third, the center gate, only had oak trees around the road, and led to the principle driveway to the stables and mansion. The main entrance gate has an old milestone within the wall, reading \\"Thirty miles from City Hall, New York City\\". One entrance had a swinging metal gate on two granite posts, next to a relatively undecorated gatehouse. The drive from the gate to the house took a visitor along a slightly ascending and winding road, through a grove of elms, to the east of Rockwood Hall. Legacy Sacred Heart Academy in Cincinnati, Ohio The house's architecture inspired the design of the Sacred Heart Academy in Cincinnati, Ohio, which was built from 1864 to 1867 by Thomas Sargent as a private home for William C. Neff. The Cincinnati building is described as a \\"copy reversed left-to-right\\" of Rockwood Hall. The likely intermediate sources for Sargent were images published in Villas on the Hudson, by A. A. Turner. =Present-day park= Southdown sheep at Rockwood, c. 1923 In 2014 and 2015, the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, a nearby non-profit farm, tended sheep and goats at Rockwood Hall. The effort was described as an experiment in land management to improve landscape health and ecosystem function, as well as possibly to increase access to land for beginning farmers by allowing them access to parks and other public lands. During the project, a shepherd would rotate the flock every few days through a series of paddocks, coaxing the animals to graze invasive plants like akebia and porcelain berry. The project gave the center additional land and forage for sheep, and helped control invasive plants and improve soil health. Local supporters of the project included New York Life, which supplied water, and the nearby retirement community Kendal on Hudson. From July to November 2014, the farm tended 50 sheep and 7 goats in the pastures of Rockwood Hall. In 2015, 10 Boer goats, 30 Tunis sheep, and 50 Finn Dorset sheep were moved to Rockwood Hall to graze. During Rockefeller's ownership, about 100 Southdown sheep would roam the grounds.

The hamlet consists of residences, businesses, and a fire station on Union Street, Arch Hill, and Requa Street, all abutting U.S. Route 9. Directly across Route 9 lies Rockwood Hall, part of the Rockefeller State Park Preserve. The volunteer Archville Fire Department serves the hamlet and surrounding area, from the Hudson River to Pocantico Lake and from the edge of Briarcliff Manor to the edge of Sleepy Hollow. History The original arched bridge over US Route 9 near the eponymous hamlet (July 1920) Current Route 9 bridge The only commercial operation in the hamlet. In the background is the replacement bridge. The community received its first name, Arch Hill, after an arched bridge was built over the present-day U.S. Route 9 in 1839. The bridge carried the Old Croton Aqueduct over the highway until 1924, when the bridge was deemed to be a traffic hazard and was demolished. The aqueduct was then rerouted to flow beneath the highway. In November 1998, long after the aqueduct was shut down, the bridge was replaced as a crossing for aqueduct walkers, bikers, and equestrians over the particularly dangerous section of the highway. The new bridge connects the Rockefeller State Park Preserve with Rockwood Hall, and was built to resemble the two bridges over Route 117 which the Rockefellers had built. In 1839, when Saint Mary's Episcopal Church in Briarcliff was founded, many of the first parishioners lived in Archville, which was at the time a community of laborers building the Croton Aqueduct. Fire department Archville Fire Department has three chief's cars, two fire engines, and a horse-drawn hand pumper from 1890, which serves as a department antique. The Archville Fire Company was established in 1907. At the time, residents (including Saint Mary's rector Oakley Baldwin) constructed the first firehouse: a 20-foot tower and shed on the corner of Route 9 and Union St. The first equipment purchased was 30 fourteen-quart galvanized buckets. After a petition to Mount Pleasant's town board, the Archville Fire Department was chartered on November 11, 1909 with Hubert W. Mannerly as the first chief. Donations from neighbors including Frank A. Vanderlip funded a new firehouse on Requa St., and fundraising allowed the department to purchase a used 50-gallon hand-operated and horse-drawn pumper purchased from the Valhalla Fire Department. It was delivered in 1911. In 1930, after Briarcliff Manor requested that Archville provide fire protection for Briarcliff's hamlet of Scarborough, the Archville department merged with the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department (BMFD) and was called the Scarborough Fire Company. In 1966, the Mt. Pleasant Fire District built the current firehouse at Union St. and Route 9, designed by local architect Don Reiman. They also purchased a new pumper, replacing Archville's Diamond T engine and making obsolete the company's second truck, owned by Briarcliff and housed at the Scarborough Presbyterian Church's garage. Around 1971, the Archville-based Scarborough Fire Company stopped responding to Briarcliff fire alarm calls and resisted taking required training courses. Additionally in 1971, Briarcliff's government tried to charge Archville $200 per year ($ per year in ) for the four existing hydrants and water supply in the hamlet, which Archville reacted in objection to. Briarcliff Manor contacted the State Controller, who instructed the village that Briarcliff Manor's existing arrangement was not in accordance with any state law. Archville's fire protection district refused to lease the station and equipment from Briarcliff, and thus in 1972 the Briarcliff Board of Trustees terminated the Scarborough Fire Company’s membership in the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department, severed its protection responsibility over Archville, and formed the Scarborough Engine Company with a new truck and firehouse. The Archville Fire Department was reestablished in 1972. Members of the former Scarborough Fire Company could choose to join either department; most Briarcliff Manor members joined the BMFD. =Gallery= File:Archville old fire station 01.pngRequa St. firehouse File:Archville, New York - firehouse.tifCurrent firehouse File:ArchvilleFD5.jpgEngine 236, a 2010 Pierce Velocity PUC 1500/1000 File:ArchvilleFD4.jpgThe department antique, from around 1890 References External links Archville Fire Department website * Hamlets in Westchester County, New York Mount Pleasant, New York ","title":"Archville, New York"},{"id":"42947624","text":"The Solidarity Prize () – Polish award for promotion and protection of democracy and civil liberties.

This is based on the tracking of an organism's cellular ancestry due to the cell divisions and relocation as time progresses, this starts with the originator cells and finishing with a mature cell that can no longer divide. This type of lineage can be studied by marking a cell (with fluorescent molecules or other traceable markers) and following its progeny after cell division. Some organisms, such as C. elegans, have a predetermined pattern of cell progeny and the adult male will always consist of 1031 cells, this is because cell division in C. elegans is genetically determined and known as eutely. This causes the cell lineage and cell fate to be highly correlated. Other organisms, such as humans, have variable lineages and somatic cell numbers. C. elegans: model organism  As one of the first pioneers of cell lineage, in the 1960s Dr. Sydney Brennerfirst began observing cell differentiation and succession in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Dr. Brenner chose this organism due to its transparent body, quick reproduction, ease of access, and small size which made it ideal for following cell lineage under a microscope. By 1976, Dr. Brenner and his associate, Dr. John Sulston, had identified part of the cell lineage in the developing nervous system of C. elegans. Recurring results showed that the nematode was eutelic(each individual experiences the same differentiation pathways). This research led to the initial observations of programmed cell death, or apoptosis. After mapping various sections of the C. elegans' cell lineage, Dr. Brenner and his associates were able to piece together the first complete and reproducible fate map of cell lineage. They later received the 2002 Nobel prize for their work in genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death. Being that c.elegans are hermaphrodites, there consist of both male and female organs, where they store sperm and are able to self fertilize. C. eleganscontain 302 neurons and 959 somatic cells, where they begin with 1031, where 72 undergo apoptosis which is programmed cell death. This makes the c.elegana model organism for studying cell lineage, and being able to observe the cell divisions due to their transparent phenotype. History of cell lineage One of the first studies of cell lineages took place in the 1870s by Whitman who studied cleavage patterns in leeches and small invertebrates. He found that some groups, such as nematode worms and ascidians form a pattern of cell division which is identical between individuals and invariable. This high correlation between cell lineage and cell fate was thought to be determined by segregating factors within the dividing cells. Other organisms had stereotyped patterns of cell division and produced sublineages which were the progeny of particular precursor cells. These more variable cell fates are thought to be due to the cells' interaction with the environment. Due to new breakthroughs in tracking cells with greater accuracy, this aided the biological community since a variety of colors are now used in showing the original cells and able to track easily. These colors are fluorescent and marked on the proteins by administering injections to trace such cells.  Techniques of fate mapping  Cell lineage can be determined by two methods, either through direct observation or through clonal analysis. During the early 19th century direct observation was used however it was highly limiting as only small transparent samples could be studied. With the invention of the confocal microscope this allowed larger more complicated organisms to be studied. Perhaps the most popular method of cell fate mapping in the genetic era is through site-specific recombination mediated by the Cre- Lox or FLP-FRT systems. By utilizing the Cre-Lox or FLP-FRT recombination systems, a reporter gene (usually encoding a fluorescent protein) is activated and permanently labels the cell of interest and its offspring cells, thus the name cell lineage tracing. With the system, researchers could investigate the function of their favorite gene in determining cell fate by designing a genetic model where within a cell one recombination event is designed for manipulating the gene of interest and the other recombination event is designed for activating a reporter gene. One minor issue is that the two recombination events may not occur simultaneously thus the results need to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, some fluorescent reporters have such an extremely low recombination threshold that they may label cell populations at undesired time-points in the absence of induction. More recently, researchers have begun using synthetic biology approaches and the CRISPR/Cas9 system to engineer new genetic systems that enable cells to autonomously record lineage information in their own genome. These systems are based on engineered, targeted mutation of defined genetic elements. By generating new, random genomic alterations in each cell generation these approaches facilitate reconstruction of lineage trees. These approaches promise to provide more comprehensive analysis of lineage relationships in model organisms. Computational tree reconstruction methods are also being developed for datasets generated by such approaches.

Located at Sitio Cupang, Brgy. San Nicolas, Bulakan, Bulacan, the shrine is the former site of the house of the del Pilar clan. Currently, the shrine is under the management of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. History Marcelo H. del Pilar was born on this site on August 30, 1850 to Julian Hilario del Pilar and Blasa Gatmaytan. By the time of the Philippine revolution, del Pilar was forced to leave his home in Bulakan and escape to Spain wherein he continued his work along with other progressives like Jose Rizal, and Graciano Lopez Jaena. Marcelo del Pilar, otherwise known as Plaridel, died of tuberculosis in Spain on July 4, 1896. A few years after his death, his remains were exhumed and brought back to the Philippines on December 3, 1920 to be laid to rest at the Mausoleo de los Veteranos de la Revolucion in the Manila North Cemetery. Heading into the 21st century, a historical marker was placed on the site in 1939 by the Philippine Historical Committee, the precursor of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. A shrine to commemorate Plaridel was first conceived in 1955 by the Samahang Bulacan under the leadership of poet Jose Corazon de Jesus. Later the next year, on August 30, 1956 during the celebration of his birth day, a ground-breaking for the said shrine was held. The event was headed by former President Ramon Magsaysay and was blessed by Rev. Fr. Vicente Marasigan, S.J. grandson of del Pilar. In 1957, Speaker Jose Laurel donated a sum of Php. 49, 000 for the construction of the shrine. The development of the site as a shrine (including a bronze statue purportedly to be done by National Artists Guillermo Tolentino) was not completed, however. In August 30, 1982, a ten-foot tall statue of del Pilar was erected at the center of the birth site. The monument was done by renowned Maloleno sculptor Apolinario P. Bulaong using cement mixed with crushed bronze. Afterwards, the 4,027 square meter birth site was donated to the Bulacan Provincial Government by the family of Plaridel’s youngest daughter, Anita del Pilar-Marasigan through Atty. Benita Marasigan-Santos. On August 30, 1983, the site was turned over to the National Historical Institute (now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines) and was from that point on, known as the Marcelo H. del Pilar Historical Landmark. After roughly six decades of being interred at the Manila North Cemetery, the remains of Marcelo del Pilar was transferred to his birthsite on August 30, 1984. His remains were laid to rest under his monument. Atty. Marasigan-Santos later on had a mausoleum built behind the monument and re-interred the remains of their family members, among them Plaridel’s wife, Marciana “Tsanay” del Pilar. Sculptor Bulaong was once again commissioned to create a mural depicting the hero’s life. Upon the celebration of the del Pilar’s centennial death anniversary, on July 4, 1996 former President Fidel V. Ramos ordered allocation of funds for the erection of a museum-library at the back of the site. The construction was undertaken by the municipal government of Bulakan, Bulacan and was inaugurated on August 30, 1998. The administration of the museum-library was handed over to the NHI on February 15, 2000. Contrary to local rumors, the museum-library was not patterned after the original bahay-na-bato house of Marcelo del Pilar. =Declaration as a National Shrine= With the NHI board resolution no. 1, s. 2006, the Marcelo H. del Pilar Historical Landmark was formally established as the Marcelo H. del Pilar Shrine. Later on, the site was recognized by the NHCP as a historic site and the marker that was installed in 1939 was replaced with a revised text. The new historical marker was installed on January 17, 2012. Features =Marcelo del Pilar Monument and tomb= del Pilar Mausoleum At the center of the 4, 027 square meter site is the monument of Marcelo H. del Pilar, made by local sculptor Apolinario Bulaong. Made of cement mixed with crushed bronze, the statue stands 10 feet high and beneath it lies the remains of the hero himself, laid to his final resting place in 1984. =Del Pilar Mausoleum= Inside the Museum Library, 2nd floor Behind the stadium and the monument stands the mausoleum of the del Pilar family. Inside the mausoleum is a family tree of the descendants of Marcelo del Pilar and his wife Marciana. The remains of Marciana and other members of Marcelo’s family are also interred in the mausoleum. It is said that some members of the clan visit the site religiously on All Saints’ Day. =Museum-Library= A two-storey museum library erected in 1998 can be found at the back of the site. The structure, built of modern materials in the style of the traditional bahay-na-bato, showcases displays of Marcelo del Pilar's literary works as well as collections of different kinds of books written by and in commemoration various Filipino heroes. At the second level of the building is the library and gallery of other historical artifacts. See alsoMarcelo H. del Pilar References External links Bulacan Marks Marcelo del Pilar Day * Marcelo H.

Traditional forms of societies considered dreams as portals to another world, a spirit world. These societies would even say they could gain most of their religious ideas from dreams. They could identify the sacred and gain access to sacred realms or portals to the supernatural. Psychologists have been researching dreams as of the 21st century because the connection between religious connotations in dreams has brought about growth and health. However, many different psychologists claim there is very little evidence to the research on the psychology of religion and dreams. Dream interpretation The contemporary 21st century has brought about a scientific materialism that can be detrimental to understanding the concept of dreams and how to interpret them. Traditionally, the concept of dreaming and interpreting dreams through religious means is universal. Some of the cultures around the world consider dream interpretation through their religious views as a means of spiritual discipline. A psychological view of this connection between religious views and dream interpretation stems from analyzing the content of dreams. The continuity theory has proposed that dream and waking cognition have everything in common except that dream cognition does not have the capability of being reflective. The counter argument to this theory would purpose that dream and waking cognition are completely different. Researchers such as Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud have claimed that dream processing must include a more symbolic approach, utilizing metaphors to explain its purposes. =History of dream interpretation= Many different researchers have tried to understand the purpose behind dreaming and state their most apprehensive work behind understanding early childhood dreams. Sigmund Freud (1900/1965) claimed that dreams from childhood were illustrations of wish-fulfillment dreams that begin in naivety during childhood and escalate into later adulthood. Carl Jung (1974) believed that childhood dreams were a sign of transpersonal wisdom from the unconscious. G. William Domhoff (1996) and S. H. Foulkes (1999) were both known for arguing childhood dreams as a reflection of the immature development involved in the consciousness of a young child, involving characteristics such as being passive and bland. Antti Revonsuo (2000) was in support of childhood dreams, in particular nightmares, to better support his idea of \\"threat simulation theory\\" found in dreaming. Worldviews From the earliest of ones, dreams have been best interpreted as part of a religious worldview. Traditional societies wouldn't have had a problem declaring dreams to be more than just a psychological state, but of an encounter with a different realm. Most of the world's religious traditions in the 21st century have considered dreams to be sacred and part of a religious landscape. Each culture has a different way of expressing their traditions and contemporary beliefs on dream and interpretation. It is important to explore these different worldviews to gain a better sense of the relation between religion and dreams. =Tribal/indigenous worldview= Native Americans' belief of dreaming is more similar to Buddhism versus that of common Western beliefs. Their view of dreams and dream interpretation looks similar to that of an interactive conversation. The conversation happens between them and the world. They are able to have this conversation because they don't see a difference between dreaming and waking reality, but rather an overlapping experience. In this particular event in which they are overlapping worlds, they are able to open up their spiritual eyes to the visible and invisible, the audible and inaudible. The main goal of dreaming within this worldviews is twofold. They first look to gain a strong connection between them and the world as well as enhance their self-knowledge and respect among their tribe. =Western worldview= Christianity The belief of dreams tying with religious themes in the Western worldview was not something that was naturally intuitive. By having belief in these things, the Western culture would open their minds to a non-rational and imaginative force that opens up people's mind to understanding realism with evil and how one can have hope over it. Pursuing dreams does not require God or gods and is why the Western culture receives this practice openly among their religious views and lifestyles. There has been debate among researchers as to whether researching dreams is worthwhile. Some have debated that dreams are purposeless and completely random, whereas other have suggested dreams having an adaptive function that allows for positive implications. Although there isn't findings of specifically lowering negative effects, research has alluded to dreams embellished with religious themes having a positive benefit for the user. The biggest finding was related to dreams and religion included exploring this connection as a form of coping. This effect of the Western worldview of dreams and dream interpretation with religious connotations has spread as far as the churches in Nigeria, Africa. These churches believed their leaders in the church would receive frequent dreams that would guide them and their followers to a special spiritual status. =Eastern worldview= Buddhism Amidst different Hinduism and Buddhist contexts, there are different theories such as sleepless dreaming that appear. This is unique to the Eastern culture because it is rarely mentioned with the Western culture when discussing the possibility of dreams and religion. The only time Western writers talk of dreamless sleep is when referencing Hindu or Buddhist contexts. This Eastern viewpoint gives a unique insight on how practices in Buddhist circles can be contextualized. This dreamless sleep as mentioned prior is part of Tibetan Buddhism practice of achieving a particular mental state before going into sleep. They describe this experience as such of having visions and they require some visual criteria to be present for dreamless sleep to be achieved. Its highest form of praise is that it gives practical guidelines for the practicing Buddhist and their progress in meditation. Islam The Muslim society believes different forms of dreaming can help people come into contact with past martyrs of their faith. Their purpose is to give the dreamer full understanding of the martyr's existence and implications towards the future. Different examples of how dreams can affect the future of Muslims include but are not limited to: showing a prosperous future, motivate them into moral or spiritual development and warning them of impending dangers. Decisions made by Muslims can be as important as deciding a future spouse can be determined through one particular dream. The ultimate purpose behind these dreams is to give the devout Muslim a deeper insight into the truth that is not available in waking reality. = Dream Interpretation Method = According to Dr Abdullah bin Muhammad at Thayyar , there are several methods for people who want to interpret dreams. Because, not everyone can interpret dreams. # The person is a religious person and is good at dream interpretation. # Such a person cannot interpret, except on the basis of good knowledge and understanding. # When a dream is told to him, he should say it well. # He should hide the disgrace of people who dream from others. It can't tell the fulan dream like this and this. # He should not interpret dreams except after recognizing and distinguishing every kind of dream and the things that are relevant to it. # The person who interprets the dream must be a smart, intelligent, fearless and pious person. In addition, he is someone who understands the Quran, Hadith, Arabic language and supporting tools to understand Islam. # He shouldn't interpret dreams in times of emergency. # It should interpret the dream in terms of the level of madzhab of Islam, religion and state of each person. # He should always ask God for help in interpreting dreams. # If in fact he is not able to interpret it, then do not force yourself to interpret the dream. # If the meaning of his dream is something that the dreamer does not like, then he should be quiet or say something nice. # It should be the intention and purpose of interpreting this dream to draw closer to Allah ta'ala, as this is the way in which the Prophets of Allah are living. # He should not interpret dreams until he knows and knows the dreamer well. # It cannot lie or interpret what is actually good but is said to be bad. And vice versa, interpreting what is bad but saying good.

Although he never won at Group One race, he established himself as the leading horse in Europe over one mile in 1978. His early form was moderate, but in the autumn of his three-year-old season he made dramatic improvement to record wide margin victories in the Prix du Rond Point and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He was retired from racing at the end of the season, having won six of his fourteen races, and had modest success as a breeding stallion. Background Homing was a bay horse with a white star and a white sock on his right hind leg bred by his owner Lord Rotherwick. He was sired by Habitat, an American- bred, British-raced miler who became one of the leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Marwell, Rose Bowl, Flying Water and Sigy and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. Homing's dam, Heavenly Thought was a successful racemare who won the Princess Royal Stakes in 1970 and later produced Water Mill who won the Glorious Stakes and finished second when favourite for the 1980 St Leger. Heavenly Thought was a granddaughter of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks winner Musidora who was also the ancestor of the St Leger winner Snurge. Homing was sent into training with Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. He usually raced in blinkers. Racing career =1977: two-year-old season= After finishing unplaced on his racecourse debut, he was sent to York Racecourse in October where he contested a minor race over six furlongs. He appeared to be struggling in the early stages but made rapid progress in the second half of the race and won by one and a half lengths from Fast Colour a colt who had previously won the Champion Trophy at Ripon Racecourse in August. =1978: three-year-old season= In the early part of 1978, Homing showed unremarkable form, and was beaten in his first four races. In June, he was moved up in distance and won the Bass Clubman's Handicap at Haydock Park Racecourse from Spring To Mind, Portese and Fool's Prayer. He then dropped back in distance and won handicap races over a mile at York and Haydock. In August he was allotted top weight in the Rose of York Handicap, but finished ninth of the fifteen runners behind Petronisi. On 3 September, Homing was moved up sharply in class for the Group Two, Prix du Rond Point over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden by the Scottish jockey Willie Carson he started a 16/1 outsider, with the four-year-old filly Sanedtki being made favourite. Homing took the lead from the start, went clear of his opponents in the straight, and won by four lengths from Sanedtki (who was carrying six pounds more than the colt) in a new course record time of 1:35.6. Three weeks later, Homing met Sanedtki again, this time at a difference of two pounds, in the Group One Prix du Moulin over the same course and distance. Homing again attempted to make all the running but was caught 100 metres from the finish and beaten two lengths by Sanedtki. There was a gap of five lengths back to the rest of the field which included Nishapour (Poule d'Essai des Poulains), Kenmare (Prix Jacques Le Marois), Carwhite (Prix d'Ispahan) and Dom Racine (Prix Jean Prat). A week after his defeat in the Moulin, Homing returned to England for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (then a Group Two race) over one mile at Ascot Racecourse and started 9/2 second favourite behind the Vincent O'Brien-trained Stradavinsky. The other runners included the 1000 Guineas winner Enstone Spark, the Queen Anne Stakes winner Radetzky and the Jersey Stakes winner Camden Town. Homing started slowly but quickly took the lead and dominated the race, drawing away from his rivals in the straight to win easily by five lengths from Stradavinky, who in turn finished well clear of the rest. Assessment In 1977, the independent Timeform organisation awarded Homing a rating of 105 p, the \\"p\\" indicating that he was expected to mage significantly more than normal improvement: in their annual Racehorses of 1977, they described him as \\"a very useful colt in the making\\". In 1978, Homing was rated 130 by Timeform, making him their best miler of the year. In the official International Classification, Homing was rated the sixth-best three-year-old colt in Europe, five pounds behind the top-rated Ile de Bourbon. Stud record At the end of his three-year-old season, Homing was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Highclere Stud in Newmarket after his owner had reportedly rejected an offer of $2m from American breeders. He began his stud career at a fee of £3,500. He was not a particularly successful stallion, but did sire the Derby Italiano winner Don Orazio and Chapel Cottage, a sprinting filly who won the Cherry Hinton Stakes and the Duke of York Stakes.

An ordinary of arms (or simply an ordinary) is a roll or register of coats of arms arranged systematically by design, with coats featuring the same principal elements (geometrical ordinaries and charges) grouped together. The purpose of an ordinary is to facilitate the identification of the bearer of a coat of arms from visual evidence alone. Ordinaries may take a form which is either graphic (consisting of a series of painted or drawn images of shields) or textual (consisting of blazons – verbal descriptions – of the coats). Most medieval and early modern manuscript ordinaries were graphic, whereas all the principal modern published ordinaries have been textual. A knowledge of the technicalities of blazon is essential for the student hoping to make best use of a textual ordinary. By extension, ordinaries may also be compiled of other elements of heraldic display, such as crests, supporters or badges.Woodcock and Robinson 1988, p. 34. Although ordinaries of arms have been compiled since the 14th century, the actual term seems to have come into use only in the 18th century. The earliest clear attestation is found in Edmondson's Complete Body of Heraldry of 1780. Medieval and early modern ordinaries roundels and annulets The ordinary appears to have been an English development of the 14th century. No medieval ordinaries are known from continental Europe.Wagner 1950, p. xv.Wagner 1952, p. 51. Medieval English ordinaries include \\"Cooke's Ordinary\\", compiled in c.1340 (644 coats),Wagner 1950, pp. 58–59.Fox 2006. \\"Cotgrave's Ordinary\\", also of c.1340 but in blazon (556 coats),Wagner 1950, p. 60. and the larger \\"Thomas Jenyns' Book\\", compiled in c.1398 (1,595 coats).Wagner 1950, pp. 73–78. These three are all related, and perhaps derive from a lost progenitor. An independent work is \\"William Jenyns' Ordinary\\", compiled in c.1360 (1,612 coats).Wagner 1950, pp. 69–71.Fox 2009. In the early 16th century, Thomas Wriothesley, Garter King of Arms, planned a comprehensive painted roll and ordinary of all English arms: this was not completed, but parts of the ordinary survive in what is now known as \\"Prince Arthur's Book\\" of c.1520.Wagner 1957, pp. 258–59.Campbell and Steer 1988, pp. 387–88.Woodcock and Robinson 1988, colour plate 1. In the second half of the century, Robert Glover, Somerset Herald, drew on a wide range of medieval sources to compile \\"Glover's Ordinary\\", the fullest and most authoritative ordinary to date. This was assembled in its first form in 1584, and contained some 15,000 coats. At the beginning of the 17th century, Augustine Vincent, Rouge Croix Pursuivant and later Windsor Herald, compiled \\"Vincent's Ordinary\\", also of about 15,000 shields, drawn in trick.Campbell and Steer 1988, pp. 409–10. Versions of Glover's Ordinary, much augmented, were published in Joseph Edmondson's Complete Body of Heraldry (1780) and in William Berry's Encyclopedia Heraldica (1828). Cotgrave's Ordinary was published in 1829, edited by Sir Harris Nicolas. Modern ordinaries =Papworth= Extract from Papworth's Ordinary (1874) The principal modern ordinary of British and Irish heraldry, still not entirely superseded, is \\"Papworth's Ordinary\\" (1874), or in full An Alphabetical Dictionary of Coats of Arms belonging to Families in Great Britain and Ireland, forming an extensive Ordinary of British Armorials upon an entirely new plan, compiled by John Woody Papworth. Papworth began work in 1847, making extensive use of Burke's General Armory (first published 1842; third edition with supplement 1847), copying its entries – which were arranged alphabetically by surname – onto slips of paper and rearranging them.Collins 1942, pp. 4–5. He published a prospectus in 1857, and began to issue his work in instalments shortly afterwards: nine parts had appeared by 1863, and fourteen by the time of his early death (apparently hastened by his insistent commitment to work on the project) in 1870.Collins 1942, pp. 5–6. By this point the work had proceeded as far as page 696: the remaining 429 pages were edited and brought to completion from Papworth's materials by Alfred William Morant (1828–1881). The Ordinary, containing about 50,000 entries, was published as a complete volume in 1874.Collins 1942, pp. 6–7. It rapidly established itself as a standard work of reference, and was reprinted in 1961, 1977 and 1985. The great strength of Papworth's Ordinary was the rigorousness of its system of classification by blazon, which (with minor modifications) has remained the basis for all ordinaries published since: there was only one possible place for any particular coat of arms to be entered within it.Collins 1942, pp. 8–10.For further details, see Its weakness was its dependence for its contents on Burke's General Armory and other secondary sources, which meant that it inherited many of their errors and omissions. One of the oddities of the book (and therefore of some of its successors), which resulted in part from Papworth's decision to classify animal charges of all kinds under the primary heading \\"Beast\\", and birds of all kinds under \\"Bird\\", is that the alphabetical distribution of entries is highly unbalanced: the headings A–F account for roughly 80% of the whole, a point on which the editor had to reassure subscribers while the work was still in progress.Collins 1942, p. 6. =Dictionary of British Arms= In 1926 Lt Col George Babington Croft Lyons left a substantial bequest to the Society of Antiquaries to prepare a revised and improved edition of Papworth. Anthony Wagner became co-general editor in 1940 and sole general editor in 1944, remaining in that position until 1995. A number of volunteers were recruited (some of them, during the war years, working in inactive periods of firewatching duties) to assemble material on index cards. However, the task was a large one and progress slow, in part because of Wagner's insistence on high scholarly standards and use of primary sources, and in part because of over-ambitious plans to include in the final work a series of essays on medieval armorial families. It was eventually decided to limit the project to England, to the medieval period (pre-1530), and to publish a simple ordinary, including a name-index but without the additional essays. With the aid of computer technology, the first volume of what was now entitled the Dictionary of British Arms appeared in 1992. Volume 2 was published in 1996, volume 3 in 2009, and volume 4 (the final volume) in 2014. =Scotland= An Ordinary of Arms for Scotland, edited by Sir James Balfour Paul, Lord Lyon King of Arms, was published in 1893, with a second updated edition appearing in 1903: this includes all arms recorded in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland from its inception in 1672 down to the end of 1901 (5,532 entries, with a name index). A second volume, covering arms entered in the Register from 1902 to 1973 (a further 6,040 entries), was published in 1977: this was edited by David Reid of Robertland, Carrick Pursuivant, and Vivien Wilson. An Ordinary of Scottish Arms from Original pre-1672 Manuscripts, edited by Eilean Malden, John Malden (sometime Unicorn Pursuivant) and William G. Scott, was published in 2016. This contains both an armory (arranged alphabetically by surname) and an ordinary of some 25,000 coats of arms, drawing on the evidence of medieval rolls of arms and other pre-1672 manuscript sources, but excluding that of seals. =Wales= \\"An Ordinary of Welsh Arms\\", covering Welsh arms, crests, badges and supporters down to c.1630 (about 2,800 entries and a name index) forms the greater part of volume 3 of The Development of Welsh Heraldry by Michael Powell Siddons, published in 1993. A supplementary ordinary down to c.1700 (a further 1,200 entries) is included in volume 4, published in 2006. =Suffolk= A Dictionary of Suffolk Arms edited by Joan Corder (an ordinary of arms, containing about 6,700 entries and a name-index) was published by the Suffolk Records Society in 1965. A companion volume by the same editor, A Dictionary of Suffolk Crests (containing some 25,000 entries for crests, arranged in \\"ordinary\\" form, together with a name-index), was published by the same society in 1998. =\\"Garter's Ordinaries\\"= An important modern unpublished ordinary is the collection known as \\"Garter's Ordinaries\\", now held at the College of Arms. This was originally compiled by and under the direction of Sir Albert Woods, Garter King of Arms, between 1842 and his death in 1904, and was then donated to the College by his grandson, Gerald Woods Wollaston. At that time it comprised two series, one of five and the other of six volumes, plus indexes. Subsequent Garters have added to the series and kept the ordinary up to date by including within it new grants of arms. The ordinary remains in use by the members of the College, both for identifying old coats of arms, and for ensuring that new grants are sufficiently differenced from existing coats.Wagner 1952, pp. 50–51.

He became one of the members of parliament (MP) for Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. Hervey said that he was expecting a position by the then Whig Prime Minister Henry Pelham, but he eventually gave up hope despite Pelham's reassurances. In 1756 Hervey resigned his position with the Duke of Cumberland citing the problems of travelling several times a year.

To date, the band has released six EPs and three studio albums. The band was formerly signed to Fearless Records. The band released their third studio album Composure on July 13, 2018. History =Formation and EPs (2010–13)= In the fall of 2010 bassist Kyle Fasel \\"wasn't happy\\" with the music he was working on and wished to start over. Fasel called lead guitarist Dave Knox and the pair soon started talking about the goals they wished to achieve. Fasel didn't expect it to lead anywhere. Vocalist Dan Lambton, who was friends with Knox, received a call from Fasel, asking if he would like to join him and Knox. They were soon joined by drummer Aaron Schuck. The band recorded its debut EP, This Is Honesty, in the spring of 2011. Following the release of the EP, the band began playing shows around the Midwest. The group soon realized that it \\"didn't feel right [playing the songs they currently had]. [...] almost forc[ing] ourselves into [a] sound.\\" They had a meeting and came to the conclusion to start over. During this period of change, Fasel and Knox were playing in The Fastest Kid Alive. Shortly afterwards, Schuck was replaced by Brian Blake. Blake had emailed the band after he found out they needed a drummer. Real Friends didn't have a permanent second guitarist, often having their friends to substitute. Eric Haines soon joined as rhythm guitarist. Until Haines joined Fasel and Knox would typically write the songs and they didn't have \\"another guitar[ist's] opinion\\", according to Fasel. Shortly after the release of the Everyone That Dragged You Here EP, the band's popularity increased and the audience at their shows also increased. The band later released the Put Yourself Back Together EP. Reviewing the EP for Rock Sound, Andy Biddulph said noted that he would not be \\"surprised\\" if the band was \\"mixing it with the big boys in a year's time\\". In November, the group supported The Wonder Years on their UK shows, included UK Warped Tour.. = Maybe This Place Is the Same and We're Just Changing (2013–15)= Fearless signed the band in December 2013. The band were initially hesitant to sign to a label but called Fearless \\"different. They made it feel more like a family.\\" The group \\"still wanted full control of our band\\" while Fearless would help with marketing and distribution, according to Fasel. The band recorded their debut studio album in February with producer Seth Henderson. The band released its debut studio album, Maybe This Place Is the Same and We're Just Changing on July 22, 2014. The album sold over 10,300 copies, charting at number 24 on the Billboard 200. The band played on the 2014 Vans Warped Tour supporting the album's release, appearing on the Journey's Stage. More Acoustic Song EP was released for Record Store Day in April 2015. One of the tracks, an acoustic version of \\"Late Nights in My Car\\", features Kevin Jordan from This Wild Life. = The Home Inside My Head (2015–2017)= Fearless Records announced that a new Real Friends record would be released on their label in 2016, through a post on their official Twitter account, which was made on December 22, 2015. Prior to the Fearless announcement, the band had made several references to the recording of a new album throughout 2015 on their Facebook and Twitter pages. Real Friends finished recording their second full-length album on the road, in February 2016. Prior to the album's announcement, the band began to play a new song entitled \\"Colder Quicker\\" during their live sets. On April 1, 2016, the band announced the title of their new album as being The Home Inside My Head, along with the album's release date, cover art and track listing. Additionally, on the same day the band released a music video for \\"Colder Quicker\\". The album was released on May 27, 2016. =Composure (2017–2020)= On November 16, 2017, the band released a single entitled \\"Get By\\". On June 18, 2018, the band announced the new album Composure set for release on July 13, 2018, to their home town fans during an RSVP Acoustic session. It was preceded two weeks prior by a single entitled \\"From the Outside\\", which was accompanied by a music video. The band released an EP called Even More Acoustic Songs which features hits such as \\"Get By\\". There was a limited 7\\" vinyl pressing. In early 2020, the band deleted their previous posts on social media, causing many to believe their breakup. Lambton has denied these rumors. On February 14, 2020, the band released a statement saying they have parted ways with Lambton.https://twitter.com/realfriendsband/status/1228378383106691075?s=20 In the statement, they noted \\"This is not the end of Real Friends. We have simply turned the page to the next chapter.\\" The band has not said any further comments on the situation, but they posted a statement on the Black Lives Matter Movement in June 2020. Style and influences Real Friends has been described as pop punk, emo and emo pop. Punknews reviewer said \\"If American Football went totally pop-punk, Real Friends would be the result.\\" Vocalist Dan Lambton has been described as a cross between The Starting Line's Kenny Vasoli, The Wonder Years' Dan Campbell and The Dangerous Summer's AJ Perdomo. Bassist Kyle Fasel has cited American Football, Dashboard Confessional, The Early November, Jimmy Eat World, The Promise Ring, Saves the Day, The Starting Line, Spitalfield, Taking Back Sunday and Thursday as influences. Side projects Lambton joined with Knuckle Puck members Joe Taylor and Ryan Rumchaks to form Rationale. With Rationale, Taylor plays guitar and sings vocals, Rumchaks plays drums, Lambton on guitar and vocals and rotating bass players, Tyler Albertson & Nick Casasanto. \\"Hangnail\\" was made available for streaming on December 5, 2015, and their debut EP Confines followed four days later.

It was transferred from the genus Sulfolobus to the new genus Saccharolobus with the description of Saccharolobus caldissimus in 2018. It was first isolated and discovered in the Solfatara volcano (which it was subsequently named after) in 1980 by two Germans microbiologists Karl Setter and Wolfram Zillig, in Solfatara volcano (Pisciarelli-Campania, Italy). However, these organisms are not isolated to volcanoes but are found all over the world in places such as hot springs. The species grows best in temperatures around 80° Celsius, a pH level between 2 and 4, and enough sulfur for solfataricus to metabolize in order to gain energy. These conditions qualify it as an extremophile and it is specifically known as a thermoacidophile because of its preference to high temperatures and low pH levels and it is also in aerobic and heterotropic categories for its metabolic system. It usually has a spherical cell shape and it makes frequent lobes. Being an autotroph it receives energy from growing on sulfur or even a variety of organic compounds. Currently, it is the most widely studied organism that is within the Crenarchaeota branch. Solfataricus are researched for their methods of DNA replication, cell cycle, chromosomal integration, transcription, RNA processing, and translation. All the data points to the organism having a large percent of archaeal-specific genes, which showcases the differences between the three types of microbes: archaea, bacteria, and eukarya.  Genome  Sulfolobus solfataricus is the most studied microorganism from a molecular, genetic and biochemical point of view for its ability to thrive in extreme environments; it is easily cultivable in laboratory; moreover, it can exchange genetic material through processes of transformation, transduction and conjugation. The major motivation for sequencing these microorganisms is because of the thermostability of proteins that normally denature at high temperature. The complete sequence the genome of S. solfataricus was completed in 2001. On a single chromosome, there are 2,992,245 base pairs which encode for 2,977 proteins and copious RNAs. One- third of S. solfataricus encoded proteins have no homologs in other genomes. For the remaining encoded proteins, 40% are specific to Archaea, 12% are shared with Bacteria, and 2.3% are shared with Eukarya.; 33% of these proteins is encoded exclusively in Sulfolobus. A high number of ORFs (open reading frame) are highly similar in Thermoplasma. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), already present in eukaryotes, have also been identified in S.Solfataricus and S.acidolcaldarius. They are already known for the role they play in posttranscriptional modifications and removal of introns from ribosomal RNA in Eucarya. The genome of Sulfolobus is characterised by the presence of short tandem repeats, insertion and repetitive elements, it has a wide range of diversity as it has 200 different ISs insertion sequence elements. = Thermophilic reverse gyrase = The stabilisation of the double helix against denaturation, in the Archaea, is due to the presence of a particular specific thermophilic enzyme, reverse gyrase. It was discovered in hyperthermophilic and thermophilic Archaea and Bacteria. There are two genes in Sulfolobus that each encode a reverse gyrase. It is defined atypical Dna topoisomerases and the basic activity consists in the production of positive supercoils in a closed circular Dna. Positive supercoiling is important to prevent the formation of open complexes. Reverse gyrases are composed of two domains : the first one is the helicase like and second one is the topoisomerase I. A possible role of reverse gyrase could be the use of positive supercoiling to assemble chromatin-like structures. In 1997 scientists discovered another important feature of Sulfolobus : this microorganism contains a type-II topoisomerase, called TopoVI, whose A subunit is homologous to the meiotic recombination factor, Spo11 which plays a predominant role initiation of meiotic recombination in all Eucarya. S. solfataricus is composed of three topoisomerases of type I, TopA and two reverse gyrases, TopR1 and TopR2, and one topoisomerase of type II, TopoVI. = Dna binding proteins = In the Phylum Crenarchaeota there are three proteins that bind the minor groove of Dna like histones:Alba, Cren7, and Sso7d, that are modified after the translation process. These are small and have been found in several strains of Sulfolobus but not in other genome.Chromatin protein in Sulfolobus represent 1-5% of the total. They can have both structural and regulatory functions. These look like human HMG-box proteins, because of their influence on genomes, for the expression and the stability, and on epigenetic processes. In species lacking histones they can be acetylated and methylated like eukaryotic histones. Sulfolobus strains present different peculiar DNA binding proteins, such as the Sso7d protein family. They stabilize the double helix, preventing denaturation at high temperature thus promoting annealing above the melting point. The major component of archael chromatin is represented by Sac10b family protein known as Alba (Acetylation lowers binding affinity). These proteins are small, basic and dimeric nucleic acid-binding proteins. Furthermore, it is conserved in most sequenced archeal genomes. The acetylation state of Alba, as an example, affects promoter access and transcription in vitro, whereas the methylation state of another Sulfolobus chromatin protein, Sso7D, is altered by culture temperature. The work of Wolfram Zillig's group, representing early evidence of the eukaryotic characteristics of the transcription in Archea, has since made Sulfolobus an ideal model system for transcription studies. Recent studies in Sulfolobus, in addition to other archaeal species, mainly focus on the composition, function and regulation of the transcription machinery in these organisms and on fundamental conserved aspects of this process in both Eucarya and Archaea. DNA transfer Exposure of Saccharolobus solfataricus to the DNA damaging agents UV-irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C induces cellular aggregation. Other physical stressors, such as changes in pH or temperature shift, do not induce aggregation, suggesting that induction of aggregation is caused specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that the UV-inducible DNA transfer process and subsequent homologous recombinational repair represents an important mechanism to maintain chromosome integrity. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction, similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation that is also associated with DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.  Metabolism  Sulfolobus solfataricus is known to grow chemoorganotrophically, in presence of oxygen, on a variety of organic compounds such as sugars, alcohols, amino acids and aromatic compounds like phenol. It uses a modified Entner-Doudroff pathway for glucose oxidation and the resulting pyruvate molecules can be totally mineralized in TCA cycle. Molecular oxygen is the only known electron acceptor at the end of the electron tranport chain. Other than organic molecules, this Archea species can also utilize hydrogen sulfide and elementar sulfur as electron donors and fix CO2, possibly by means of HP/HB cycle, making it also capable of living chemoautotrophycally. Recent studies have found also the capability of growing, albeit slowly, oxidizing molecular hydrogen. =Ferredoxin= Ferredoxin is suspected to act as the major metabolic electron carrier in S. solfataricus. This contrasts with most species within the Bacteria and Eukarya, which generally rely on NADH as the main electron carrier. S. solfataricus has strong eukaryotic features coupled with many uniquely archaeal-specific abilities. The results of the findings came from the varied methods of their DNA mechanisms, cell cycles, and transitional apparatus. Overall, the study was a prime example of the differences found in crenarchaea and euryarchaea.  Ecology  =Habitat= S. solfataricus is an extreme termophile Archea, as the rest of the species of the genus Sulfolobus, it has optimal growth conditions in strong volcanic activity areas, with high temperature and very acid pH, these specific conditions are typical of volcanic area as geyser or theraml springs, in fact the most studied countries where microorganism were found are: U.S.A (Yellowstone National Park), New Zealand, Island and Italy, notoriously famous for volcanic phenomena like these. A study conducted by a team of Indonesian scientists has shown the presence of a Sulfolobus community also in the West Java, confirming that high fears, low ph and sulfur presence are necessary conditions for the growth of these microbes. Fumarole of Solfatara volcano - Campania, Italy. =Soil acidification= S. solfataricus is able to oxidize sulfur according to metabolic strategy, one of the products of these reactions is H+ and, consequentially, it results in a slowly acidification of surrounding area. Soil acidification increase in place where there are emissions of pollutants from industrial activity, and this process reduce the number of heterotrophic bacterial involved to decomposition, which are foundamental to recycling organic matter and ultimately to fertilizing soil.  Biotechnologie: Untapping the resource Sulfolobus Today, in many fields of application, we are interested in using Sulfolobus sulfataricus as a source of thermal stability enzymes for research and diagnostics, as well as in the food, textile and cleaning industries, and the pulp and paper industry. Furthermore, this enzyme is overloaded due to its catalytic diversity, high pH and temperature stability, increased to organic solvents and resistance to proteolysis. At present, tetraester lipids, membrane vesicles with antimicrobial properties, trehalose components, and new β-galactooligosaccharides are coming increasingly important. = β-galactosidase = The thermostable enzyme β-galactosidase isolated from the extreme thermophile archaebacterial Sulfolobus solfataricus, strain MT-4.

This was the Clancy Brothers' final album, released almost four decades after the group's first album, The Rising of the Moon. It was also their third album for Vanguard Records. The songs on Older But No Wiser are notable for their thicker musical accompaniment than was typical of Clancy recordings, as well their first use of female back-up singers. This was the only album that Paddy Clancy, Bobby Clancy, Liam Clancy, and their nephew, Robbie O'Connell, recorded together. For all previous Clancy Brothers recordings, the group had different line-ups. Background and music The inspiration for this album came from the Clancy Brothers' performance at Bob Dylan's 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration, where the group performed, \\"When the Ship Comes In\\". Except for this live number, which they re-recorded in a studio, the Clancy Brothers had never before recorded any of the tracks on this album. Liam Clancy performed the most solos. The Clancy Brothers and Robbie O'Connell focused this album largely on the theme of aging and nostalgia. Three of the numbers, \\"When the Ship Comes In\\" and \\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Willie\\" by Bob Dylan and \\"Those Were the Days\\" by Gene Raskin, were written by the Clancys' old friends from Greenwich Village during the American folk music revival of the 1960s. Bob Dylan had originally based \\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Willie\\" on the Clancy Brothers' version of the Irish rebel song, \\"Brennan on the Moor,\\" one of the group's most popular songs in the early 1960s. The tavern mentioned in the song, \\"Those Were the Days,\\" referred to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, where the Clancy Brothers used to drink and informally sing. Paddy Clancy's one solo on the album, \\"Let No Man Steal Your Thyme,\\" was a song that he recorded Robin Roberts performing in 1959 for Tradition Records, a small record label that he ran at the time. The numbers, \\"Roll on the Day\\" and \\"Lily Marlene,\\" deal with themes of death and loss, respectively. The Clancys had known \\"The Boys of Wexford\\" since their boyhoods, and a few other songs on the album were written by old friends, including \\"The Flower of Scotland,\\" by the late Roy Williamson of The Corries. The group recorded the album at Ring Studios next to Liam Clancy's home in County Waterford, Ireland. Older But No Wiser was the Clancy Brothers' first studio album since their 1974 LP, Greatest Hits. Reception Patrick Street, writing in the magazine, Dirty Linen, called this last Clancy Brothers album \\"probably the best studio recording of their distinguished career.\\" He applauded all the singers and accompanists, while singling out Robbie O'Connell for having the best voice of the group. The reviewer for the folk music magazine, Sing Out!, praised the \\"Clancy's patented hearty and gusty singing and O'Connell's more sensitive style\\" on the album.

She discovered several plant taxa and collected some 500 plant specimens. She was born to frontier family and had little education, but in 1892 she was able to enrol at the newly opened University of New Mexico at Albuquerque in the 'preparatory department', which was to ensure students were educated equivalent to a high school degree, and in the next school year she was to be promoted to the 'normal department'. She made her first plant collection here. In May of 1893, however, after only eight and half months her father took her out of college to help the family start a new ranch in a remote location in the Sandia Mountains. In the late 1890's she made contact with Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell and Elmer Ottis Wooton, both then at the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts at Las Cruces (now on the campus of New Mexico State University) near Mesilla. She maintained correspondence with Cockerell and other notable botanists for decades afterwards.  Plant collecting  Ellis is known to have collected 515 plant specimens of at least 345 species, at least a few of which were used to create the formal scientific description and name of that particular taxon of plant. She did not maintain a numbering system and her specimens are spread out over at least five herbaria, and are thus not maintained in a separate collection. These include those at the local University of New Mexico (2 sheets) and the New Mexico State University (75) herbaria, but also the United States National Herbarium and the herbaria of the New York Botanical Gardens and the Missouri Botanical Gardens. Because many of her collections were of very common plants, the majority of these voucher specimens have likely disappeared in the general collections -many millions of sheets by thousands of collectors, and have never been indexed for the database, thus some 80% of her are now 'lost' somewhere, but the specimens which are housed in New Mexican herbaria are indexed and accessible. Almost all, if not all, of her collections were made in the Sandia Mountains in the 1900s to 1910s. The holotype specimens she discovered and collected include Primula ellisiae (a synonym of P. rusbyi), Dodecatheon ellisiae (now D. dentatum subsp. ellisiae) and Astragalus praelongus var. ellisiae. These plants were named in her honour. She also collected the holotypes of Achillea laxiflora (a synonym of A. millefolium) and Tium stenolobum (a synonym of Astragalus scopulorum). She sent an Opuntia specimen she collected in 1910 in the mountains near Placitas to Joseph Nelson Rose.

Early life Born Olaug Juliane Grinaker, but known as Kiki throughout her life, she was the eldest of three sisters growing up on a farm in Norway during the German occupation. In her mid-teens she moved to London, where she studied at Harrow College of Art. After this, she met her first husband Nicky Byrne, who also acted as her business manager. After selling some of her early designs through Mary Quant's boutique Bazaar, Kiki set up her own boutique in Sloane Street, in collaboration with her husband. Some sources suggest that this boutique was called Glass & Black, although extant Kiki Byrne garments are labelled Kiki Byrne. Fashion Following its initial success, the Byrnes moved Kiki Byrne to new premises on the King's Road. Byrne and Mary Quant were remembered as the \\"first people to make clothes for young people\\". Their designs offered a young alternative to the mature styles then being produced by high fashion designers. Byrne told The Sydney Morning Herald in 1958 that \\"only Midlands businessmen's wives can afford Michael and Hartnell\\". Also in 1958, Byrne collaborated with the photographer Tony Armstrong on a ski-wear collection that was featured in Vogue. Byrne was known for very simple, youthful little black dresses and unfussy suits made with good quality fabrics in neutral tones such as beige, which appealed to the likes of Susannah York, Grace Coddington, and Christine Keeler, and also to glamorous actresses and models such as Kay Kendall and Barbara Goalen. She also made a white trapeze-line dress for Lady Antonia Fraser to wear to Royal Ascot in 1958, enabling her to be photographed while concealing her pregnancy. Although Byrne described her clothes as \\"exclusive clothes – at reasonable prices\\", Barbara Hulanicki, who went on to launch the original Biba boutique, remembered that one of Byrne's black dresses cost 20 guineas, which she thought quite expensive. Hulanicki would later recall how excited she and her friends were to discover Byrne designing the kind of nice, simple, youthful garments that they wanted to wear, but had difficulty finding. Byrne's designs, along with those of Foale & Tuffin, Sonia Rykiel, Quant, and Biba, were worn by the famously trendy Cathy McGowan on her influential music show Ready Steady Go!. Following the closure of Kiki Byrne in the mid-1960s, when it was bought out by Jaeger, Kiki designed for other labels including Frank Usher. Costume design Alongside the fashion work, Byrne had success as a film costume designer. She created the golden bikini worn by Margaret Nolan in the title sequence of the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, which was art-directed by her then boyfriend, Robert Brownjohn. Other films which she costumed included Fathom, Perfect Friday, and, with Gina Fratini, Stop the World – I Want to Get Off. Later life and death Following the breakdown of her first marriage, Byrne was in a long-term relationship with Brownjohn which ended shortly before his sudden death in 1970. In 1971, she married the journalist Stephen Milne. Kiki Byrne died on 3 April 2013. She was survived by her second husband and two daughters.

She was born at Kelvin Grove in Brisbane to labourer William Radford and Selina, née Stapleton. On 20 February 1897 she married Arthur Rawlins, who was known as Francis. Susan came to Sydney around 1911 with two of their three living children, assuming the name \\"Tarrant\\" between 1915 and 1917. From the 1920s she worked as a midwife, although she never qualified with the Nurses' Registration Board and was the subject of two inquiries. She was also active in the Australian Labor Party, running for the state seat of Bondi in 1927. From 1928 to 1935 she was president then secretary of the Labor Women's Organising Committee; she was also a delegate to the Interstate Women's Conference in 1930 and president of the Blind Workers' Union in 1931. She ran for Waverley Municipal Council as a Lang Labor candidate in 1932, during which it emerged that she had been convicted in 1930 for witnessing false enrolment cards at the 1930 state election in Bondi. Francis was involved in efforts to establish the Hostel for Homeless Women and Girls as secretary of a Labor committee. Well respected in the labour movement, her second marriage on 18 April 1936 to John Laurence Wilkes was preceded by a large function in her honour organised by a Labor committee; Jack Lang paid tribute to her in the annual party conference. Following this marriage she became known as Nurse Francis-Wilkes. She remained active in the local Labor Party until her death from myocardial infarction and diabetes on 22 April 1946 in Sydney. She was buried with Catholic rites in Botany cemetery.

The construction of the present church was begun in 1773 and was completed after ten years in 1783. In 2001, it was declared as a National Cultural Treasure Church by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. It is also among the five Jubilee churches of the Diocese of Antipolo.  History  The ecclesiastical history of Rizal province dates back to 1573 when two Franciscan missionaries, Fr. Juan de Plasencia and Fr. Diego de Oropesa began establishing missions in towns and villages along the north coast of Laguna de Bay. One of earliest established is a visita (sub-parish) is Pililla in Morong, Rizal, among them is Monte Tan-ay (now part of the present town of Tanay). In 1583, Pillila separated from Morong and became an independent town and in turn, Monte Tan-ay evolved into a separate town and parish on its own right in 1606. The parish church of Monte Tan-ay was put under the patronage of Saint Ildephonsus of Toledo, Spain, hence, given the same name. In 1606, Father Pedro de Talavera founded the second mission in San Antonio in Pantay and subsequently became the first parish priest of Monte Tan-ay. The historical marker in Tanay Church By 1620, the town transferred to San Antonio without changing its patron saint. The first church made up of wood and cogon grass as its roof was also established in San Antonio but was eventually burned down by the flaming arrows of marauding Aetas. Church records state that only a very old image of La Purísima Concepción was saved from the attack, believed to have been left in haste by the retreating Spanish forces. In 1639, a wide-scale Chinese uprising took over the villages across Laguna from Manila to Bulacan. Chinese rebels descended to Tanay and established camps in Monte Tan-ay and Pantay. A popular story recounts how a Franciscan priest, Fr. Geronimo de Frías, hid the image of La Purísima inside the jungle nearby. It was said that three Chinese soldiers unwittingly discovered the image and tried to destroy it with their spears. The spears are miraculously thrown back to the throwers. Driven by fear, the remaining Chinese who witnessed the event committed suicide by hanging himself in the tree in a place now known as Pinagbigtihan (Place of Hanging) to the present day. The town suffered a heavy blow during the uprising which only ended when a combined Filipino-Spanish forces attacked their camps on 1640. After the rebels were oppressed, the priests transferred the parish to its present site, formally establishing the town of Tanay in the same year. In 1678, Fr. Pedro de Espallargas initiated the building of a stone church and the first church was completed in 1680 through the contributions of churchgoers and devotees of Purísima Concepción. The first mass was celebrated on April 20, 1680. However, the structure did not last long because of natural calamities. By 1773, the construction of the present church began through the initiative of Fr. Alonso de Fentanes and the people of Tanay. It was gradually completed in 1783. The six retablos in honor of Our Lady of Anguish (Nuestra Señora de las Angustias), the Immaculate Conception (La Purísima Concepción), Saint Joseph, Saint Peter of Alcantara, the Baptism of Jesus Christ and Saint Ildefonsus of Toledo were installed in 1786. The church was declared as one of the five Jubilee churches of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Antipolo near the end of 1999.  National Cultural Treasure  On July 31, 2001 the church was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts along with 25 other churches in the Philippines. Features One of the Stations of the Cross inside the church The style of the church, with its triangular pediment and rounded belfry, leans toward Baroque architecture. The church also houses a relic of a piece of bone of San Ildefonso housed in a monstrance, given by Rev. Fr. Felipe Pedraja on October 2006 from Zamora, Spain in which the body of the patron saint lies. The 14 Stations of the Cross inside the church is considered as one of the most beautiful Stations of the Cross in Asia. The carvings are depicted to have Malay features as evidenced by the brown skin of the natives and their squat figures, all of which are believed to have created by native Tanay artists. Some distinct depictions are borrowed from the native culture such as the \\"Tambuli\\" made of carabao and the bolo instead of the typical Roman sword. The carvings are encased in large glass windows across each side of the church. Gallery File:Inside the San Ildefonso Church.JPGAn inside look of the Church.

Hannah (November 9, 1913 - August 31, 1991) was an intercollegiate, US F.I.S. and seniors ski champion who became one of the nation's most prolific ski-area architects. He was enshrined in the National Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming, Michigan, in 1968. His legacy remains throughout New England and North America in more than 250 ski areas with which he was associated during his lifetime.  Early years  Selden Hannah, better known as Sel, was born in 1913 in Berlin, New Hampshire, a lumber and paper mill town populated by a colony of Norwegians, who brought their own skis and jumping tradition from their homeland. The Nansen Ski Clubhttp://skinansen.com/history-of-nansen-ski-club/ built a 45-meter ski jump near Berlin in Paine's Pasture that Sel mastered by age eight. He wasn't much older when he traveled south to Gorham, New Hampshire, and onto Pinkham Notch where he skied on the lower slopes of Mount Washington via the Carriage Road, in Tuckerman Ravine, and occasionally from the summit.New Hampshire Ski History for 4th Graders - New England Ski Museum - Oct. 10, 2010  Dartmouth College & World War II  Sel's skiing career coincided with the era when alpine skiing took hold in the United States. In 1933 he finished fifth as a competitor in the first US National Downhill championship on the Carriage Road on Mount Moosilauke. He participated in all four skiing events during his Dartmouth College years and was captain of the Ski Team in 1935. During World War II, Sel joined Dick Durrance, another Dartmouth graduate, to assist with Colonel Tappen's mission to train a large group of parachutists from Fort Benning, Georgia. Training for the 503rd Infantry Regiment took place in Alta, Utah. Many recruits had never been on skis, while some, in fact, had never seen snow. Durrance needed a cadre of instructors to do the job. To solve that problem, he contacted friends from collegiate ski racing, including Walter Prager, Sel Hannah, his brother Jimmy, and others to train the troops. After the war, Sel continued to successfully compete in alpine races within the U.S. Eastern Ski Association and other skiing organizations.  Sno-engineering  Sel Hannah constructing Paulie's Folly on Cannon Mountain Ski Area In 1935 while he was a student at Dartmouth College, Sel began laying out Hell's Highway on Mount Moosilauke. In 1936 he was involved with building the Tecumseh Trail in Waterville, New Hampshire.Ski Magazine Dec. 1989 With the rapid growth of skiing in the 1950s, the demand for new ski locations allowed the formation of a company dedicated to designing and building ski areas. Sel founded the firm Sno-engineering in 1958, which began as a hobby but soon grew to a big business. In order to lighten his work load, he resigned as President of Sno-engineering in 1969 and became an independent consultant. An incomplete list of notable ski areas where Sel helped design or build includes:The Littleton Courier, Littleton NH, Jan. 6, 1988 Sel & 250x250px * New Hampshire: Cannon Mountain, Loon Mountain, Mittersill Ski Resort, Waterville Valley and Wildcat Ski Area * Vermont: Burke Mountain Ski Area, Haystack Mountain, Madonna Mountain Resort and Stratton Mountain * Maine: Sugarloaf, Squaw Mountain, Sunday River, Crocker and Bigelow Mountains * Massachusetts: Petersburg Pass Ski Area (Mt.

Ski Hearth Farm  After graduating from Dartmouth, Sel spent a year at McGill Medical School and the next year teaching at Wilbraham Academy, but eventually took up farming. In 1938, Sel and his wife Paulie bought the Elmer Temple Dairy Farm on Streeter Pond near Franconia, New Hampshire.Ski Hearth Farm is technically located in Sugar Hill, New Hampshire (and was part of the town of Lisbon in 1938), but is associated in the valley with the town of Franconia. In 1956 he sold the dairy operation and keep a small beef herd. He began his potato business in the late 1930s, which was downsized after the war. The beef and vegetable garden thrived over the next several decades. During the winter months, the newly named Ski Hearth Farm was a communal type lodge for friends, relatives, and clients comprising a Who's Who of the early days of New England skiing.

It formed about 14,000 years ago. As the Erie Lobe of the Wisconsin Glacier retreated at the end of the last ice age, it left melt-water in a previously-existing depression area that was the valley of an eastward- flowing river known as the Erigan River that probably emptied into the Atlantic Ocean following the route of today's Saint Lawrence River. The lake stood at to above sea level. The remanent beach is not horizontal as there is a ‘hinge line’ southwest of a line from Ashtabula, Ohio, through the middle part of Lake St. Clair. The hinge line is where the horizontal beaches of the lake have been warped upwards towards the north by the isostatic rebound as the weight of the ice sheet was removed from the land. The rise is north into Michigan and the Ubly outlet. The current altitude of the outlet is above sea level. Where the outlet entered the Second Lake Saginaw at Cass City the elevation is above sea level.Publication 9. Geological Series 7; Surface Geology and Agricultural Conditions of the Southern Peninsula of Michigan; Frank Leverett with a Chapter on Climate by C. F. Schneider;Michigan Geological and Biological Survey Lansing Michigan; 1911 The Lake Whittlesey beach called the Belmore Beach and is a gravel ridge to high and one-eighth mile (18 meters) wide. Lake Whittlesey was maintained at the level of the Ubly outlet only until the ice melted back on the \\"Thumb\\" far enough to open a lower outlet. This ice recession went far enough to allow the lake to drop about below the lowest of the Arkona beaches to Lake Warren levels. The strip of Lake bottom between the Whittlesey and Warren beaches in southeastern Michigan is largely a clayey plain, the principal exceptions being at deltas of Lake Arkona. The deltas of streams entering Lake Whittlesey are less conspicuous than of the same streams in connection with its predecessor, Lake Arkona. One reason for this is the fact that the rise of water caused estuarine conditions for some distance up the valleys beyond the Whittlesey beach, and it was necessary to fill these estuaries from their heads down- stream past the beach before the lake-bed proper would receive a coating of delta material. Frank Taylor named this body of water, Lake Whittlesey in 1897, in honour of Charles Whittleseyhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.629.7638&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf. The lake created the Belmore beach of the Erie-Huron basin. It flowed across the \\"thumb\\" of Michigan, through an outlet known as the Ubly outlet.Chapter XV.; The Glacial Lake Whittlesey; Frank Taylor; Glacial Formations and Drainage Features Erie and Ohio Basins; Chapter XV, The Glacial Lake Whittlesey; Frank Leverett; Government Printing Office; Washington, D.C.; 1902; pg 741-757 Deltas Summary of prehistoric beaches from the six glacial lakes that preceded the modern Lake Erie.Some prominent delta deposits, such as those on Huron River just east of Ypsilanti, on Rouge River at Plymouth, and on Clinton River below Rochester, belong to Lake Maumee, at its lowest stage. The valleys of incoming rivers had deepened and widened during Lake Arkona. When the ice sheet advanced and the water levels rose, the lower courses of the streams became drowned and were turned into dead-water estuaries. Thus stream deposits would start at the head of these estuaries. Only once they had completely filled the estuary would a Lake Whittlesey delta form. The deltas of Lake Whittlesey are inset and exist within the estuaries general shoreline. Recent erosion during the modern Lake Erie period has deepened these stream beds, removing most of the estuarine deltas. Only fragments remain as gravel terraces along the back areas of the old estuaries. The best remaining terrace is along the Huron River below Ypsilanti.Chapter XVII; Glacial Lake Whittlesey; Frank Taylor; The Pleistocene of Indiana and Michigan, History of the Great Lakes; Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Vol. LIII; Frank Leverett and Frank B. Taylor; Washington, D.C,; Government Printing Office; 1915 In New York there is one delta, which is a deposit in Lake Whittlesey. It buries the eastward ends of the Arkona beach ridges a mile or two east of Alden. The river, which built this delta, flowed westward along the front of the ice when the front was on the Alden moraine. It flowed in a valley, which had not been deepened during the time of Lake Arkona, and it is therefore an exception to the inset deltas of Lake Whittlesey. This delta is not large, but its relation to the Arkona beaches establishes the time at which it was built. In Ontario there are three Whittlesey deltas, each larger than any on the American side. One appears on Grand River between Paris and Brantford, another on Thames River between Komoka and London, and another on a large glacial river, which came from the northeast along the ice front and entered the Au Sable Bay of Lake Whittlesey a few miles northwest of Clinton. The first two are inset deltas like those in Michigan. The third, like the one near Alden, New York, was built by a river flowing along the ice border. Another smaller delta, formed, by a river flowing along the ice border, occurs near Guelph, Junction, Ontario. The fourth and only other place where such a delta could occur is occupied by the Ubly outlet in Michigan. Correlatives Light blue is modern lakes, dark blue and light blue are the prehistoric lake. Purple is the modern lakebed buried under the ice sheet. Simplified version of USGS (Leverett-Taylor) Map 1908 During the time of Lake Whittlesey Lake Saginaw was an independent lake and after receiving the overflow of Lake Whittlesey it discharged into Lake Chicago, which had then attained hardly half its greatest extent. Two small narrow lakes probably stood in front of the Green Bay ice lobe, but according to Mr. Leverett there was still free drainage and no lakes at the west end of the Lake Superior basin. In New York Fairchild finds Lake Newberry to be the correlative of Lake Whittlesey, but Lake Newberry discharged southward to Susquehanna River. A river of some size entered Lake Whittlesey northeast of Alden, New York, and built a delta which buried the Arkona beaches. Transitory to Lake Arkona In falling from the level of Lake Whittlesey to that of Lake Wayne the water level necessarily passed the planes at which it had stood in making the Arkona beaches, and Lake Arkona was temporarily revived. But this relation was transitory and endured for so short a time that no evidence of renewed wave work has been found.

They debuted as a team in November 2012, and used the team name reDRagon until joining WWE in 2017, after which they used the Undisputed Era name instead. Fish and O'Reilly first became known for their work in Ring of Honor (ROH), where they are three-time ROH World Tag Team Champions and the winners of the 2014 ROH Tag Wars Tournament. In parallel, they appeared in other promotions, including in New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), where they are two-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions, and the winners of the 2014 Super Jr. Tag Tournament. In WWE, they are two-time NXT Tag Team Champions (with their first reign being shared by Cole and Strong). They are the first tag team in history to have won tag team championships in NJPW, ROH and WWE. History =Ring of Honor (2012–2017)= On December 16, 2012, at Final Battle 2012: Doomsday, Kyle O'Reilly and Bobby Fish (known as reDRagon) faced the reformed American Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) in a losing effort. At the following iPPV, 11th Anniversary Show on March 2, 2013, O'Reilly and Fish defeated the Briscoe Brothers for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. In the same month, they successfully defended the championship against Alabama Attitude (Corey Hollis and Mike Posey) before retaining it at Best in the World in June in a three- way match against the C & C Wrestle Factory (Caprice Coleman and Cedric Alexander) and S.C.U.M. (Cliff Compton and Rhett Titus). They lost the title to the Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero) on July 27 but regained the title from the American Wolves on August 17.

After losing the tag titles, both men would move into singles feuds with O'Reilly feuding with former Future Shock partner Adam Cole while Fish would attempt to capture the ROH World Television Championship. At Final Battle, O'Reilly lost to Cole while Fish lost to Roderick Strong, failing to capture the ROH Television Title. At the 14th Anniversary Show, both men competed in triple threat matches for championships, Fish facing Strong and Tomohiro Ishii for the ROH TV title, while O'Reilly faced Jay Lethal and Adam Cole for the ROH World Championship; however, both Fish and O'Reilly failed to capture the titles.

On the August 2 NXT, O'Reilly made his NXT debut, also losing to Black. At NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III on August 19, Fish and O'Reilly debuted as a team, attacking the newly crowned NXT Tag Team Champions, Sanity (Alexander Wolfe and Eric Young), as well as their opponents for the night, The Authors of Pain. Later that night, the two aligned themselves with Adam Cole and attacked newly crowned NXT Champion Drew McIntyre. The following month, the trio of Cole, Fish and O'Reilly was officially dubbed \\"The Undisputed Era\\", with Fish and O'Reilly now dropping the \\"reDRagon\\" name. At NXT TakeOver: WarGames, the Undisputed Era defeated Sanity and The Authors of Pain and Roderick Strong in a WarGames match, the first of its kind in 20 years. On the December 20 episode of NXT, (taped on November 29), Fish and O'Reilly defeated Sanity (Eric Young and Killian Dain) to capture the NXT Tag Team Championship, marking their first title win in WWE. The following week, the Undisputed Era cost Aleister Black a number one contender's fatal-four way match for the NXT Championship, thus beginning a feud with Black. On the January 10, 2018 episode of NXT, Fish and O'Reilly were scheduled to defend their titles against Sanity in a rematch, but assaulted them along with Cole backstage, rendering them unable to compete. Later that night, they were forced to defend their championships against Black and Roderick Strong by NXT general manager William Regal, and successfully retained their titles after Cole interfered and distracted Black. After the match, they attacked Black. At NXT TakeOver: Philadelphia, The Undisputed Era defeated The Authors of Pain to retain the titles. On March 4, Fish suffered a torn ACL and torn MCL in his left knee at an NXT live event, forcing him to vacate his half of the NXT Tag Team Championship. He later underwent surgery and would be out of action for six months. Cole replaced Fish following his injury and the Undisputed Era's reign would continue due to the Freebird Rule. O'Reilly and Cole successfully defended the NXT Tag Team Championships at NXT TakeOver: New Orleans against the Authors of Pain and Roderick Strong and Pete Dunne. At the end of the match, Strong turned on his partner Dunne, and joined The Undisputed Era, turning heel (for the first time in WWE) in the process. The next morning at WrestleMania Axxess, Strong teamed with O'Reilly to defend the NXT Tag Team Championships, making him a champion via the Freebird Rule. O'Reilly and Strong would later lose their titles to Moustache Mountain (Tyler Bate and Trent Seven).

Taylor later rerecorded a solo version of the song for his Apple Records debut album James Taylor in 1968. Subsequently, the Flying Machine version was released on the album James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine. It has also been covered by such artists as Alex Taylor, Carly Simon and Anne Murray. James Taylor versions \\"Night Owl\\" was inspired by the Night Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village in New York City, where the Flying Machine often performed. The Flying Machine version was released as a single backed by \\"Brighten Your Night with My Day.\\" Taylor and the other group members were dissatisfied with their performance on the recording, considering it \\"mediocre.\\" Although it got some regional radio play in the northeast United States, the label declined to fund further recordings by the band. Author Stephen Davis described the song as \\"a rollicking R&B; number.\\" Tony Orlando claims to have been particularly struck by the song. Taylor later rerecorded \\"Night Owl,\\" along with several other songs he wrote for the Flying Machine, such as \\"Knocking 'Round the Zoo,\\" for his self-titled solo debut album on Apple Records. Allmusic critic Lindsay Planer rated it as one of the \\"notable inclusions\\" on the James Taylor album. The James Taylor album included instrumental interludes between songs, and James Taylor biographer Timothy White describes the brass instruments that were used for the interlude introducing \\"Night Owl\\" as \\"ungainly\\" and sounding like the overture to a Broadway musical. White does feel that the brass instruments were used better accompanying the song itself. In 1971, after Taylor gained popularity with the release of his second album Sweet Baby James, producer Chip Taylor issued Flying Machine demos including \\"Night Owl\\" on the album James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine. Author Ian Halperin complains that for the CD reissue of James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine Chip Taylor remixed the song and added bass guitar and percussion. Cover versions James Taylor's brother Alex Taylor chose to include his own version of \\"Night Owl\\" on his 1971 debut album With Friends & Neighbors. James Taylor played guitar on this version. King Curtis played tenor saxophone. White describes Alex Taylor's version as \\"a steady-rocking version.\\" Tuscaloosa News editor Ben Windham describes Alex Taylor's version as being very different from James Taylor's version, despite some similarity in their voices. He describes Alex Taylor's version as getting \\"an old-school soul treatment.\\" Anne Murray also covered \\"Night Owl\\" in 1971 on her album Talk It Over in the Morning. Allmusic critic Greg Adams describes her version as \\"funky.\\" Billboard described Murray as being \\"at her best\\" on the song. Carly Simon was dating James Taylor during the recording of her 1972 album No Secrets. She decided that she wanted to include one of Taylor's songs on the album. Producer Richard Perry chose \\"Night Owl\\" for her to cover, because \\"it was a funkier, bluesier tune than [Taylor's] more folk-oriented material.\\" Paul McCartney, Linda McCartney, Doris Troy, Jimmy Ryan and Bonnie Bramlett provided the backing vocals for Simon's version of the song. Long time Rolling Stones collaborator Nicky Hopkins played piano, Jimmy Ryan played guitar, and Klaus Voorman and Bobby Keys also played on the song. Taylor was initially not entirely happy that Simon's version of the song sounded to him like an outtake from the Rolling Stones' recent album Exile on Main Street. Rolling Stone critic Stephen Holden regarded it as the second best song on No Secrets after the #1 hit \\"You're So Vain.\\" High Fidelity regarded it as the best song on the album. Stereo Review called it a \\"scorching good version\\" of the song. Author Jami Bernard described Simon's \\"sexy growl\\" when singing the line \\"I'm a night owl, honey\\" as implying that \\"life was more interesting in the wee hours.\\" Critic James Hunter described Simon's \\"whooping growls\\" on the song as a \\"triumph.\\" Simon later included \\"Night Owl\\" on her compilation album The Best of Carly Simon.

A review in The Washington Post notes, > It's a backhanded compliment to Nader that the stampede of corporate > lobbyists into Washington starting in the 1970s began as an effort to > counter him. Conservative Grover Norquist has endorsed the book and concept, saying, \\"Right and left coalitions are areas of principle agreement, on perhaps procedure or even goals.

According to the 2008 Constitution of Kosovo, the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court and subordinate courts, a Constitutional Court, and an independent prosecutorial institution. The courts are administered by the Kosovo Judicial Council.  History  Until 2010, when the Law on Courts was approved by the Parliament of the Republic of Kosovo, the 1978 Law on Courts was in force. Under this law there was a regular system of courts consisting of the Municipal Court, District Court, the Court for Minor Offences, the High Court for Minor Offences and the Supreme Court. After the Constitution was enacted, another Court was added to the judicial system: Constitutional Court. But, as explained below, with the new law in force, the system of the Courts and Prosecution Offices had started to change. In 1999, UNMIK was deployed to provide an interim administration of Kosovo through the present times and now when the justice system operates under the authority of the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo. This period is sub-divided into four major periods, i.e. the establishment of an emergency justice system by UNMIK (June to December 1999), the justice system under the Joint Interim Administrative Structure (January 2000 to May 2001), the justice system under the Constitutional Framework for Self-Government in Kosovo (May 2001 to February 2008), and the justice system under the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo (February 2008 to present). On 15 December 2000, UNMIK Regulation 2000/64 was issued allowing for the assignment of international judges, prosecutors, or so called \\"Regulation 64 Panels\\", for particular cases.UNMIK Regulation 2000/64, 15 December 2000 On 6 July 2003, UNMIK Regulation 2003/25 and 2003/26 were issued, enacting the Provisional Criminal Code and Provisional Criminal Procedure Code, replacing the Yugoslav Federal Criminal Code still in effect.UNMIK Regulation 2003/25, 6 July 2003UNMIK Regulation 2003/26, 6 July 2003 On March 13, 2008, the Assembly passed Law 2008/03-L053, the Law on Jurisdiction, Case Selection and Case Allocation of EULEX Judges and Prosecutors in Kosovo, as well as Law 2008/03-L052, the Law on Special Prosecution Office of the Republic of Kosovo.2008/03-L053 Law on Jurisdiction, Case Selection and Case Allocation of EULEX Judges and Prosecutors in Kosovo2008/03-L052 Law on Special Prosecution Office of the Republic of Kosovo These laws recognize the authority of EULEX judges, prosecutors, and courts to work in tandem with their Kosovan counterparts, which are governed by the Assembly of the EULEX Judges and an Assembly of the EULEX Prosecutors, respectively. Provisions of the Law on Courts which came into force on January 1, 2013 define the new court structure and their hierarchy in Kosovo. The new structure not only changes the old court organization, but it also establishes new courts which are now located in both, larger and small municipalities. The aim of this structure is to bring more efficiency courts, and bring judges and court-houses more closer to the citizens of Kosovo. From January 1, 2013 the new structure of prosecution offices in Kosovo will reflect the goal of the general justice reform in Kosovo towards more efficient, modern and professional approach to prosecution services, and better access to justice for all people.  Analysis  Effective rule of law was and will remain critical for Kosovo to develop political, economic and social stability and security. Key to ensuring effective rule of law is a functioning justice system. Any form of political, administrative and judicial organization reflects the problems and challenges of its time, which it attempts to address by certain organizational forms. However, with time passing, the original purposes and policies tend to be overshadowed by new problems and challenges to be addressed by organizations, which were designed in a different historical context. In order to properly understand existing judicial institutions and bodies, it is important to understand the historical context which shaped their formation and structure. A reform of existing institutions cannot be undertaken without simultaneously taking into consideration the ‘past purposes’ and the ‘current challenges’ of such institutions.

In 1901, when Robert was elected as a Labor MP to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, they moved to Sydney, where Grace worked as her father's secretary. She was appointed inspector of factories and industrial inspector in the Department of Labour and Industry in 1916, tending to support employers over employees; she and her father both left the Labor Party as pro-conscriptionists that year. Scobie campaigned for conscription in the two referenda, served as a council member of the National Association of New South Wales from 1917 to 1918, and was given the OBE in 1918. In 1920 Labor News censured her for condoning harsh treatment of illegitimate children as a board member of the State Children Relief Board. In that year she ran for the Soldiers and Citizens Party for the state seat of Eastern Suburbs, but was not successful. From the 1920s Scobie was a member of the National Council of Women of New South Wales, but in 1924 the political department for which she worked refused her permission to attend daytime meetings and she was forced to resign. By 1927 she had moved well away from the council, and was president of the Professional Women Workers' Association.

The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Kinsarvik where Kinsarvik Church is located. The municipality of Kinsarvik existed two different times: from 1838 until 1869 and then again from 1913 until 1964. The municipality centered on the inner part of the Hardangerfjorden, and (originally) surrounded all of the Sørfjorden. The original Kinsarvik encompassed all of the present day municipalities of Ullensvang (except for Røldal) and a small part of Voss. Upon its final dissolution in 1964, it covered an area of . History The large parish of Kinsarvik (spelled Kinzervig at that time) was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The parish of Kinsarvik was centered at Kinsarvik Church and it had one parish annex: Ullensvang. In 1869, Ullensvang became the main parish, and Kinsarvik became an annex to Ullensvang (and the municipality then changed its name to Ullensvang). On 1 July 1913, the municipality of Ullensvang was split into three separate municipalities. The northwestern part became Kinsarvik (population: 1,736), the central part was Ullensvang (population: 1,941) and the southern part became Odda (population: 3,077). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Kinsarvik municipality was dissolved. The Lussand-Kvanndal area north of the Hardangerfjorden (population: 72) was transferred to Granvin Municipality.

It is found in sub-Saharan Africa. It inhabits areas with thick cover afforded by rank undergrowth and scrub, including in suitable coastal regions. Common names include gewone vleiloerie in Afrikaans and umGugwane in Zulu. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the white-browed coucal. It is named after the British naturalist William John Burchell. Habits This common resident of southern Africa is usually seen as a solitary individual or in pairs. They prefer clambering through thickets in bushveld, marshes, riparian fringes or coastal bush. It is more often heard than it is seen. When it does fly, the flight is ponderous and ends with a long glide to the next thicket. Voice This bird has a distinctive call, which resembles water pouring from a bottle, and various other calls such as the \\"dove\\" call and an alarm hiss. The birds are most vocal in the breeding season, and a couple may call in duet, or several birds may call in concert. Nesting Between September and February (austral summer) a large matted nest is normally made in a thorn tree. Usually four white eggs are laid, and these hatch out after 14 to 18 days. Both parents feed the nestlings for another three weeks. Food Burchell's coucal is predatory, stalking through thick bush and eating insects (including Orthoptera), snails, amphibians (frogs and toads), reptiles (including lizards and chameleons) and birds up to the size of a laughing dove.

Padilla street, Brgy. Poblacion, in Plaridel, Bulacan, Philippines. In 1961, a historical marker was installed on the church by the National Historical Committee (precursor of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines). History Saint James the Great is the patron saint of Quingua Church. The church of Plaridel, or Quingua was first established as one of the visitas of Malolos in 1581 and Fray Mateo Mendoza OSA who administered the Malolos Convent began the Christianization of Encomienda Binto y Quingua. It was located in a barrio now called \\"Lumangbayan\\" the mission chapel was soon transferred to its present location across the river Quingua (now known as Angat River) because of frequent flooding. Due to long distance of Malolos Convent to the Visita of Binto making the friars to be physically exhausted, the Augustinian prior of Malolos Fray Roque de Barrionuevo made the elevation of Visita of Binto into a Quasi- Parish on September 27, 1602. On April 30, 1605 Quingua was officially established as a full pledge Parish with Fray. Diego Pardo OSA as its first parish priest under the advocacy of Santiago de Matamoro. A Church was built on the new location starting 1602 and took 15 years to complete. The adobe stones used in the church were from the town of Meycauayan while the bricks used were made at Sitio Nabugtos at Brgy. Sta. Ines. In the year 1612, Quingua already had its own convent and 1,800 parishioners. It is said that the parish was not as wealthy as other convents in the Provincia de Bulacan during that time and that it was exempted from its fees to the Augustinian Province in the Philippines located at the San Agustin Church, Intramuros, from 1640 to 1704. The 1605 church was razed by fire after being hit by lightning. As a result, in 1722 a new church was built by Fr. Tomas Quijano on the same site. In 1772, the church was razed by fire once more but was quickly rebuilt. During the British Invasion in the 18th century, some of the treasures and documents owned by the San Agustin Monastery in Intramuros were transferred to the convent of Quingua. The church suffered immensely from an earthquake in 1863 but was repaired the same year. According to the historical marker installed by the National Historical Committee, the church also served as a military hospital and cuartel by the Americans in 1899. Long time administered by the Archdiocese of Manila, on March 11, 1962 with the establishment of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos, the Quingua Church and Convent administration and ownership was transferred to the Diocese of Malolos, making Quingua Church the center of one of the original nine vicarias of Malolos, the Vicariate of Plaridel or the Vicariate of Santiago Apostol comprising the parishes in the municipalities of Calumpit, Balagtas (Bigaa), Guiguinto, Baliwag, Pulilan and Plaridel (Quingua). Architecture The present stone and brick church is barn-style Baroque mixed with Moorish ornamentation. The first level of the façade consists of a main trefoil arch doorway flanked by two niches of saints. The second level, with its three windows, is plainly adorned by four pairs of pillars. The pointed arch shaped pediment (resembling a minaret), on the other hand, is richly ornamented with carvings of cherubs, saints and other embellishments surrounding the oculus or rose window. At the peak of the pediment is a carving of the pierced heart of Jesus. Attached to left of the façade is the five-storey bell tower with a quadrilateral base and octagonal upper levels and topped by a cone-shaped dome. There are five bells in the belfry, the biggest of which is dedicated to Nuestra Senora de la Consolación. Simborio Chapel Simborio Chapel A stone's throw away from the church is an octagonal chapel locally known as the Simborio Chapel. Believed to have been built in the 1800s, the chapel may have functioned as a mortuary chapel although its current location in a residential area is a few meters away from the Catholic cemetery.

Commission on Temporal Goods St. James' Salubong Festival A fiesta for horse lovers is the popular two-day celebration called “Pintakasi ng mga Caballero” held before New Year's Eve in Plaridel, Bulacan. Its main attraction, however, is held on Dec. 29 a colorful parade of cocheros, jockeys and other equine aficionados, followed by a tilbury race (horse-drawn chariots for two), whose participants include movie stars (particularly members of the clan of the late former Bulacan Governor Jose Padilla, I), luminaries of the province and government officials. This annual celebrationa delight to both local and foreign tourists turned 400 years old last December. It is actually the traditional feast of San Tiago Mata Moros in Plaridel town. Multitudes of devotees, who are joined by tourists, flock to Plaridel every year either to witness or participate in this colorful ritual in honor of San Tiago, or St. James the Apostle, who has been depicted as a horse rider. San Tiago is considered the unofficial patron of cocheros and jockeys. St. James the Apostle is the cousin of Christ. His image, portrayed riding on a white horse trampling upon pagan figures, is brought in a procession from its “home” in Barangay Sipat and transferred to the Parish Church. Fiesta organizers dub the ritual preceded by an early morning mass on Dec. 29 at the chapel of Barangay Sipat as, “the traditional salubong.” Featured are race studs and the patient horses of caritelas and tilburies with their owners seeking blessing during the translacion or transfer of their patron saint. The procession is called salubong because San Tiago's image tailed by groups of faithful including elderly women wearing kimona’t saya and buntal hats performing a ritual dance is met by the patron's other devotees halfway from Sipat to Plaridel Parish Church, in the town's poblacion. Local officials and national figures often join the devotees’ seven-kilometer trek to the parish church. In the past celebration, Tourism Secretary Gemma Cruz Araneta; DOTC Sec. Vicente Rivera Jr., who hails from Plaridel; Former Bulacan Governor Josie Dela Cruz; and former Bulacan Vice Governor Willie Villarama, this town's “adopted son”, led the procession. The image stays inside the parish to give time for the faithful to pay their respects until the following day, Dec. 30, when the image is again carried in a procession around the poblacion. After 14 days, when the fiesta celebration is over, the image, in another simple procession accompanied by fiesta organizers and town officials, will be returned to the Sipat Chapel, popularly known as \\"Hatid\\". \\"Salubong\\" ritual dates back to the time of Spanish friars who established the town's parish church in 1580, making St. James patron saint of the town. according to a local book of the town's history, the original image of St. James on a white horse brought to Plaridel (then Quingua) by the Spaniards in the 1800s was left in the care of the family of Bernardo Sampana a rebel heathen of Sepoy ancestry who became a Christian convert. The image was housed in their home at Barrio Tabang. Then the Sampanas were ordered by the friars to turn over the said image to the possession of the owners of the Bahay na Bato in Barrio Sipat (which was renamed Santiago), because of the townsfolk's claim that the family was allegedly practicing sorcery. When the owners of Bahay na Bato died, the image became the possession of Tandang Sitang whose house was eventually turned into a barrio chapel, present home to San Tiago's image in Sipat. San Tiago, or St. James the Apostle, was a Galilean and brother of St. John the Evangelist. He was ordered killed by Herod Agrippa, King of Judea in 41 A.D. A history book of Philip Van Ness says the tomb of St. James was found in Northern Spain in 718 A.D. Thirty years after that, a war between the Spaniards and the Moors broke out. When the Spaniards were in near defeat, an apparition of St. James, armed with a sword and riding a white horse, appeared “as bright as a star” in the thick of the battle. The apparition gave life to the demoralized Spanish soldiers and led them to victory over the Moors, who in turn were bedazzled by the blinding image of St. James. This “miracle” probably explains why St. James became patron saint of those who have affinity with horses, like the devotees flocking every year to the colorful Plaridel ritual. Restoration of ceiling art Late in November 2013, efforts to restore parts of the Santiago Apostol Church, including its ceiling paintings were completed. The project's proponent was the parish church management under the leadership of Fr. Dennis Espejo in cooperation with the AADG Restoration Group. According to project director Andrew Alto de Guzman, the task was aimed at promoting the appreciation of Quingua's heritage. The project, which took two years to complete involved three stages. The first stage, after extensive research on the structure, was uncovering the church trusses, the tirantes or decorative beams, and the zapata or corbels which supported the original ceiling, all of which were covered in the 1970s when tin sheets and wood were used as the church ceiling. The second stage was remaking the Trompe l’oeil paintings in the ceiling based on archival photos. Among the images illustrated were those of Christ, Mary, and the twelve apostles. The artworks were done by local artists Chris Pasco, Mark Villanueva, Roy Gutierrez, Joey de Guzman and assistants. The third phase of the project centered on applying lime plaster to the upper portions of the capitals. The application of palitada was provided by Escuela Taller. The bricked up rose windows on the sides of the church were also exposed.

Health care administrators are considered health care professionals.  Terminology  Health policy and management or health systems management or health care systems management describes the leadership and general management of hospitals, hospital networks, and/or health care systems. In international use, the term refers to management at all levels. In the United States, management of a single institution (e.g. a hospital) is also referred to as \\"Medical and health services management\\" \\"Healthcare management\\" or Health Administration. Health systems management ensures that specific outcomes are attained, that departments within a health facility are running smoothly, that the right people are in the right jobs, that people know what is expected of them, that resources are used efficiently and that all departments are working towards a common goal.  Applying social determinants of health in health policy and management  Social determinants (i.e. location, housing, education, employment, income, crime, social cohesion) have been shown to significantly influence health. However, at present, population health receives only five percent of national health budgets. By comparison, 95 percent is spent on direct medical care services, yet medical care only accounts for only 10-15 percent of preventable mortality in the United States. Genetics, social circumstances, environmental exposures, and behavioral patterns comprise the bulk of health determinants of health outcomes, which is increasingly considered when creating health policy. At the federal level, policymakers are addressing social determinants through provisions in the Affordable Care Act, in which non-profit hospitals must conduct community health needs assessments and participate in community improvement projects. The creation of public-private partnerships by hospitals has occurred in many states, and has specifically addressed social determinants of health like education and housing. Federal, state, and local governments can improve population health by evaluating all proposed social and economic policies for potential health impacts. Future efforts within health policy can incorporate appropriate incentives and tactical funding for community-based initiatives that target known gaps in social determinants. Needs assessments may be conducted in order to identify the most potentially effective mechanisms for each given community. Such assessments may identify a demand for increased and reliable forms of transportation, which would allow individuals to have continuous resources to preventative and acute care. As well, funding for job training initiatives within communities with low employment would allow individuals to build their capacity to not only earn income, but also engage in health-seeking behaviors which typically are at an elevated cost. Variations in medical practice and quality of care Unwarranted variations in medical practice refer to the differences in care that cannot be explained by the illness/medical need or by patient preferences. The term “unwarranted variations” was first coined by Dr. John Wennberg when he observed small area (geographic) and practice style variations, which were not based on clinical rationale. The existence of unwarranted variations suggests that some individuals do not receive adequate care or that health resources are not being used appropriately. The main factors driving these variations are: increasingly complex healthcare technology, exponentially increasing medical knowledge and over reliance on subjective judgement. Unwarranted variations have measurable consequences in terms of over/under utilization, increased mortality, and increased costs. For example, a 2013 study found that in terms of Medicare costs, higher expenditures were not associated with better outcomes or higher quality of care. Medical practice variations are an important dimension of health policy and management - understanding the causes and effects of variations will guide policymakers to develop and improve upon existing policies. In managing practice variations, it is important to perform assessments of the diseases/procedures with high levels of unwarranted variations; a comparison between the care delivered and the standard care guidelines will highlight discrepancies and provide insight into improvement areas. Policymakers should take a comprehensive approach to align policies, leadership, and technology in order to effectively reduce unwarranted variations in care. Effective reduction requires active patient involvement and physician engagement though standardization of clinical care with a focus on adherence to care guidelines and an emphasis on quality based outcomes.  Medical industrial complex  The medical industrial complex is the network of corporations which supply health care services and products for a profit. The term was derived from the language that President Eisenhower had used (\\"military-industrial complex\\") when warning the nation, as he was retiring, about the growing influence of arms manufacturers over American political and economic policies. Then the term \\"medical industrial complex\\" started to spread from 1980 through the New England Journal of Medicine (Nov. 4, 1971, 285:1095) by Arnold S. Relman who served as an editor of the journal from 1977 to 1991. According to Dr. Relman, American health care system is a profit-driven industry and it has become a widely accepted theory these days. Since the term was introduced 40 years ago, health care industry has developed into even a larger, greater and flourishing industry. Medical industrial complex includes proprietary hospitals and nursing homes, diagnostic laboratories, home care and emergency room services, renal hemodialysis units, and a wide variety of other medical services that had formerly been provided largely by public or private not-for-profit community-based institutions or by private physicians in their offices. In countries where the medical industrial complex is too influential, there are legal limitations to consumer options for accessing diverse healthcare services due to regulations in international markets such as the General Agreement on Trade in Services. In the U.S, there are loose regulations on healthcare industries, often driving companies to charge high prices and fragment standards of care. For instance, pharmaceutical companies can charge high prices for drugs, as we have recently seen with EpiPen. Furthermore, since manufacturers of medical devices fund medical education programs such as continuing medical education and physicians and hospitals directly to adopt the use of their devices, there is a controversy that such education has a bias to promote the interests of its funders. The recent development of the telehealth industry could be a possible solution to the fragmentation of care, however, there are currently no government regulations for telehealth companies. Clearly, the government must impose stronger regulations that focus on patient well-being.  Rationing and access to care  Access to care and Rationing are important dimensions of Health Policy and Management (HPAM) because they address the market force that impacts how and when people get health care services. Rationing in health care occurs due to scarcity; everyone cannot have access to every service and treatment because it would not be an efficient use of resources. Some argue that price should not be the biggest factor in determining who has access to which services and treatments, but rather that healthcare is a right that we should all have access to. Preventative care is an important component of HPAM because the levels of preventative care measures taken by individuals can help to determine the health of the population. The ACA opened the door for increased access to preventative care by mandating insurers to offer these services at no additional cost. If all Americans practice the appropriate level of preventative care, “100,000 lives would be saved each year.” Even with the expanded access to preventative care services and other healthcare related services, the insured still experience rationing due to increasing premiums and rising healthcare costs. From 2005 to 2015, the average annual employer- sponsored health insurance premiums for family coverage increased 61%. During this time, worker contribution increased even higher by 83%. The growth in employer-sponsored premiums as well as deductibles has led individuals and families to ration health care. High premiums and deductibles encourage individuals and families to think twice before they use health services and lessens the ability for individuals to consume other goods and services. In Canada citizens have a universal healthcare system which grants them access to healthcare but requires them to deal with rationing issues. The system works through level of importance, with urgent care having priority as well as certain disease/disorder treatment as some are life and death situations. Although Great Britain was the first to boast a universal healthcare system it also suffers from rationing issues. Although the no cost sharing system seems generous on the surface, the overall lack of access or options creates serious issues for patients. Imagine a world without health care rationing is impractical due to a finite amount of resources. Prior to contrary belief, universal healthcare isn’t the answer to solve rationing, in fact, rationing may increase if more people have access to healthcare without an equivalent increase in the number of physicians. Workspaces also contribute to fostering rationing amongst their employees due to high deductibles and premiums. They key in expanding access without having a negative effect on health care is to begin to look at rationing as a way to share these finite resources across the population, and not a way to reallocate care to certain people. When we do this, we can work to improve access to care and effectively treat as many patients as possible.  Mental health  As a field, health policy and management seeks to improve access, reduce costs, and improve outcomes for individuals with mental illness. = History = The history of mental health care services in the U.S. can best be understood as a gradual shift from institutionalized provision of care to interventions focused in a community setting. World War II resulted in heightened awareness of mental illness as thousands of soldiers returned home traumatized from the war. During that time, development of psychotropic medications also offered new treatment options. In 1963, John F. Kennedy implemented the Community Health Act, ending 109 years of federal non-involvement in mental health services, spurring the deinstitutionalization of individuals with mental illness. The effects of deinstitutionalization were mixed; individuals with mental illness were no longer subject to poor conditions in asylums, however, community support was inadequate to provide treatment and services for the severe and chronically ill. = Delivery of services and current policy = Mental health is treated by an array of providers representing multiple disciplines working in both public and private settings. The psychiatric and behavioral health sector consist of behavioral health professionals, such as psychiatrists. The primary care sector consists of health care professionals such as internists and family practitioners. This sector is often the initial point of contact for patients. The human services sector consists of social service agencies and criminal justice/prison-based services, among others. The final sector is the volunteer support network sector, consisting of services like self-help groups. Recent legislation continues to improve access to care by requiring cost parity. The 2008 Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act required certain plans to provide mental illness coverage on par with general health coverage, requiring providers to provide care at similar out-of-pocket costs and with similar benefits for both types of care. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) expanded this development by requiring parity for additional plans, expanding parity protections to an additional 62 million people. Both acts significantly reduced cost as a barrier to care, but there are still areas for progress. This legislation has been successful in improving mental health treatment rates across the entire population. However, there are still large disparities in these rates amongst whites and non-whites. This may be because states that opted out of Medicaid expansion under the ACA had much larger populations of adult people of color. = Opportunities for improvement = An ongoing and future trend in mental health care is care integration. Recently, care integration has been a key policy priority, and numerous federal agencies have adopted initiatives to promote the integration of primary care and mental health services.

The leader of the revolt finally decided to surrender following Japanese threats to execute more civilians if the guerrillas did not turn themselves in. Following their arrest and subsequent execution, the Japanese returned to administer North Borneo until 1945 when the main Allied liberation mission arrived.  Background  Albert Kwok, the main leader of Kinabalu Guerrillas. With the persistent harsh rule during the Japanese occupation, there have been some resistance against the Japanese especially on the west coast of North Borneo, where a revolt was led by Albert Kwok with the members comprising mostly Chinese and some indigenous peoples. Kwok, a local Teochew Chinese from Kuching in neighbouring Sarawak had previously been working with the China Red Cross and serving under the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek, before returning to Borneo through Malaya in 1940. During his time in China, Kwok was also a student of the Seventh-day Adventist Mission School in Canton. He arrived in Jesselton on 15 May 1941 and started a practice treating piles. In February 1942, Kwok wanted to establish contact with the Australians or Americans in eastern North Borneo but was unable to walk across the island jungle any further when he reached Pensiangan where he saw a large presence of Japanese troops. He needed to establish relations with the Allied movements, especially the United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP) as it was the sole armed resistance movement in the region at the time which were supplied with firearms. After he managed to establish contact with the American forces in the Philippines with the help of a fellow Chinese businessman named Lim Keng Fatt, a Muslim cleric (Imam) named Marajukim from Sulu who was part of the resistance movement in the Philippines approached Kwok in Jesselton where he hence departed to Tawi-Tawi for training. From there, they travelled further to Sulu and met Lieutenant Colonel Alejandro Suarez and learned the activities of the resistance movement in the archipelago. In May 1943, Kwok returned to Jesselton with a high determination to liberate North Borneo. Once he arrived there, he first contacted the Overseas Chinese Defence Association (OCDA), with whose help he acquired medical equipment and cash donations for the support of the resistance in Sulu. Once again, in June 1943, he travelled with Marajukim to the Philippines. Through the mediation of Suarez, he met with the representatives of the US army and was appointed Lieutenant on 1 July 1943. The second time he returned to North Borneo, Kwok already had three pistols, a box of hand grenades and was promised to be given more weapons. However, as he could not induce the guerrillas in the Sulu Archipelago to send more firearms, he was forced to launch a revolt with limited supplies. A resistance group under his leadership was then established on 21 September 1943, with the group calling themselves the Chinese National Salvation Association (CNSA), a branch of the OCDA. With collaboration between the Chinese and indigenous peoples, the group were subsequently known as Kinabalu Guerrillas Defence Force.  Uprising  A plate commemorating the 324 fallen resistance members as well as victims of Japanese massacre in Petagas. As the Japanese decree to seize any opposition towards the Japanese administration became closer, the resistance group were forced to launch revolt ahead of schedule. With much of his members armed with only parang, spear and kris, the movement launched their attack from 9 October 1943 and temporarily retake Jesselton, Tuaran and Kota Belud, leaving around 50–90 casualties on the Japanese side. Through a combined land and sea attack on the Japanese, most islands inhabitants around the coastal areas contributed ships to the movement. Native Bajau-Suluk leaders such as Panglima Ali (Sulug Island), Jemalul (Mantanani Islands), Orang Tua Arshad (Udar Island) and Saruddin (Dinawan Island) contributed mostly through sea attacks. Both Jemalul and Saruddin volunteered themselves from the Philippines to lead the Binadans of Mantanani and the Dinawan Islands. From land, the movement been supported by native Dusun-Murut leaders such as Musah representing the Dusun community and Duallis for the Murut as well members of Indian Imperial Police led by Constable Subedar Dewa Singh. While administration and police members of authorities of North Borneo mostly serving under the North Borneo Volunteer Force (NBVF) led by Jules Stephens and Charles Peter, as well as Sergeant Bud Singh and Corporal Sohan Singh. After the successful revolt, the resistance movement under OCDA and NBVF jointly hoisting the flag of the Republic of China and Union Jack on 10 October 1943. Most of the members under OCDA are loyal to the Republic of China while NBVF remained loyal to the United Kingdom although the NBVF are not even recognised by the British government. While the Japanese reinforcement from Kuching are still in process, Kwok along with other members began to retreat into their hide-out and the OCDA celebrate the birthday of Sun Yat-sen, the founder of Kuomintang and subsequently the Republic of China by hoisting the national flag again and singing the national anthem of the Republic of China on 12 November 1943.  Aftermath and legacy  The Petagas War Memorial built on the site of execution to honour the sacrifices of Kinabalu Guerrillas. Following the arrival of Japanese reinforcement, the Japanese authorities subsequently launch a ruthless counter-offensive by bombing coastal settlements from Kota Belud until Membakut and machine-gunning people. Almost all villages in the area burnt down with around 2,000–4,000 innocent civilians executed, mostly being the Bajau-Suluk civilians. After threatening to kill more civilians if the leaders of the uprising did not turn themselves in, Kwok, along with several of his top members, finally surrendered. In all, Kwok and some 175 peoples who for the most part had nothing to do with the uprising are subjected to execution order of the Japanese on 21 January 1944 in Petagas, Putatan. After the war, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) that was set-up in 1946 concluded that during the resistance movement that was led by the Chinese and indigenous peoples in North Borneo, the Kenpeitai were involved in the reign of terror by arresting, torturing and the massacre of hundreds of Chinese revolt members while doing an apparently systematic extermination of coastal population that was inhabited by the Suluk people. The sacrifice of the movement was honoured with a memorial in Petagas.

Through the transaction the acquirer provides the owner of the property with a guaranteed sum over the term of the contract. The acquirer then has the right to rent the property in question out on a retail basis, keeping all related revenues. This transaction is popular with parties seeking to shift the risk and/or management burden associated with renting property. Such a transaction is similar to leaseback arrangements more frequently used by property developers., Ratcliffe, John, Michael Stubbs, and Miles Keeping. Urban Planning and Real Estate Development.

Benefits and risks of wholesale rentals =Property owners= Through a wholesale contract a property owner is able to receive a guaranteed sum over the term of the contract. This takes the risk out of trying to rent the property him or herself, often with financial discount. Depending on how the contract is structured, the property owner may also shift more or less of the costs, maintenance, repairs, and other property owner responsibilities to the acquirer during the term of the contract. One potential downside is that by selling the right to rent to a third party, the homeowner loses some control over how that property is managed during the term, though this can also be negotiated and agreed within the contract., \\"Street Directory\\".

When acquired at the right price, such contracts can also increase profit margins. By purchasing the weeks during the term, the manager has increased control over how the property is managed. One potential downside is the increased risk of providing a guarantee - if the property does not rent as well as predicted in the retail market, the manager still is obligated to pay the property owner the agreed upon sum., \\"PropertyAngel.in\\".

The area includes five historical Colonial Revival, Classical Revival style buildings. Some significant structures are among those located within the Historic District include the James B. Dudley Memorial Building and Harrison Auditorium. The district has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since October 20, 1988. History The history of the Agricultural and Technical College Historical District can be traced back to the passing of the Second Morrill Act of 1890. Signed into law August 30, 1890, and aimed mainly at the confederate states, the act required that each state show that race was not an admissions criterion, or else to designate a separate land-grant institution for persons of color. In order to comply with the Morrill Act, and yet prevent admission of African Americans to the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, the college's board of trustees were empowered to make temporary arrangements for students of color. By an act of the General Assembly of North Carolina, the Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race was established on March 9, 1891, as an annex to nearby Shaw University in Raleigh. The college continued to operate in Raleigh until the Board of Trustees voted, in 1892, to relocate the college to Greensboro on of land donated by local citizens. Today, with an enrollment of over 10,000 students, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University is the largest publicly funded historically black university in the state of North Carolina. The university's College of Engineering has consistently ranked first in the nation for the number of degrees awarded to African Americans at the undergraduate level, and is a leading producer of African-American engineers with master's and doctorate degrees. The university is also a leading producer of African- American psychology undergraduates, minority certified public accountants, landscape architects, veterinarians, and agricultural graduates. Contributing sites and buildings Map outlining the boundaries of the Historic District. The irregularly shaped historic District is bounded by the eastern side of Dudley Street as its western boundary, stretching eastward between Bluford Street and Authur Headen Drive; and Nocho street as its eastern boundary. The district also includes an elliptical paved driveway, which served as the traditional main entrance to the university, and a grassy lawn which provides a deep buffer and setback from the Dudley Street to the district's buildings. The five contributing buildings of the district are composed of the university's oldest surviving and virtually unaltered buildings and form the historic core of the Greensboro campus. Built between 1922 and 1939, the buildings are a mixture of Colonial Revival and Classical Revival architecture. Significant buildings within the district include Noble, Morrison, and Murphy Halls; Richard B. Harrison Auditorium; and the James B. Dudley Memorial Building. =Noble Hall= Noble Hall in 1926 Built in 1923, and named for Marcus C.S. Noble, longtime Chairman of the university's board of trustees; Noble Hall is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the district. The building originally housed the college's schools of Agriculture and Home Economics on the first floor; the departments of Biology and Chemistry on the top level; with the Dairy Science laboratory located in the basement. Noble Hall Currently houses the university's School of Nursing. The three story symmetrical rectangular building, with full basement, features 20,672 square feet of office and classroom space. With the exception of metal- trimmed plate glass entrance doors, the building's exterior has been virtually unaltered. The building's facade features paired six-over-one sash windows with splayed arches on the first and third story windows and flat arches on the second story windows. Each window pair is accented with a center (white stone) keystone. Slightly recessed corbelled panels, ornamented by herringbone brickwork and a center, diamond-shaped white stone, stretch above the second story windows. This type of brickwork is reminiscent of early twentieth century North Carolina commercial buildings. Noble Hall's interior has been mostly unchanged as well, as the building still retains its original plaster walls, molded door and window surrounds. =Morrison Hall= Morrison Hall in 1926 Built in 1924, and designed by North Carolina architect Charles C. Hartmann, Morrison Hall was named for Cameron A. Morrison, former Governor of North Carolina. Placed along university circle, and located south of Noble Hall, and adjacent to the Dudley Building; Morrison Hall was constructed to be nearly identical to that of Noble hall, with the exception of its rusticated stone that surrounds the building's main entrance, as opposed to the brick used on Noble. Another distinctive feature of the building is the carved and incised stone name panel above the non-functional balcony that extends to surround the center third story windows, in addition to retaining its original double-leaf main entrance door. Today, Morrison Hall still serves its original purpose as a residence hall, housing 109 students. =Murphy Hall= Murphy Hall in 1926 Built in 1924, Murphy Hall originally served as the university's first cafeteria. Today, the building houses the university's office of student affairs. The symmetrical building features a projecting, pedimented three-bay entrance pavilion with rusticated brick and a full- height arched rusticated brick door surround. The pavilion is also ornamented with four full-height brick pilasters with stone capitals and bases, stone panels carved with an urn and garland motif, a full entablature with bullseyes and inscribed building name, and a multi-pane ocular window in the pediment. The 22,002 square foot, single story building underwent remodeling in 1977. The original arched wooden sash windows were removed then and replaced with twenty-pane windows with aluminum muntins; in addition, ribbed metal awnings were installed at the main and side entrances. The interior was also remodeled and the original high- ceilinged dining area was divided into two floors; an open string staircase with metal railings and a passenger elevator were installed to give access to the mezzanine-level offices. =James B. Dudley Memorial Building= Dudley Memorial Building Built in 1930, and considered the architectural centerpiece of the district, the neoclassical building is named for the university's second president Dr. James B. Dudley. The Dudley Building was designed by noted North Carolina architect Charles C. Hartmann, this building was erected on the site of the former Administrative building, which was built in 1893 and destroyed by fire in 1930. The building originally housed the college's administrative offices, in addition to an auditorium and library on the main and top levels respectively. Today the Dudley building houses the University art galleries on the main floor. The 29,058 square foot building features 2 floors in addition to a fully raised basement level. A distinctive feature of this building is its use of stone. This building features more stone application than any other building on the university's campus. The building also features a broad sweep of fifteen steeps to the main entrance, smooth- face blocks defining a five-bay entrance, intricately carved lintels and acroteria, full classical entablature, splayed arches with keystones over the eight-over-twelve sash windows, and a hexastyle portico with an incised frieze. The building's interior remains unaltered as the original plaster walls and molded door and window surrounds still remain. The exterior of the building has been virtually unchanged with the exception of the entrance doors, which are now made of double-leaf metal trimmed plate glass. =Richard B. Harrison Auditorium= Built in 1939, and named for renowned actor Richard B. Harrison, who taught Drama and directed productions at the college; Harrison Auditorium was designed by architect Leon McMinn. The auditorium was constructed by the Public Works Administration for usage as the college's main auditorium. The flat-roofed two story building features seven-bay main entrance with the bays defined by plain brick pilasters with simply molded stone bases and capitals. Extending above the pilasters is a plain stone frieze inscribed with the auditorium's name. Five pairs of glass and wood doors topped by five-light transoms give access to the lobby. Above each entry door at the second story level are large twelve-over-twelve sash windows. The roof line steps up at the rear of the lobby/entrance portion of the building to provide additional height to the main, large auditorium portion of the building. In 2004, the building underwent a two-year renovation process that involved both the interior and exterior of the building. The nearly $3 million renovation repaired the building's exterior surfaces, upgraded building systems, replaced seating, and made the building compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Significance The area that encompasses the historical district served as the oldest surviving structures on what is now North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the first and largest public land grant institution of higher learning for people of color in the state of North Carolina. The buildings that make up the historical district were erected as the university was phasing out its college preparatory department and beginning to focus on college level work to prepare graduates for careers and graduate and professional schools. Additionally, these buildings are representative of the university's second and third major building campaigns, which at the time the funding was the largest sum ever appropriated for African american education in the south. The Classical revival and Colonial Revival style architecture were popular among academic buildings of the early twentieth century and can be seen in other regional universities such as Duke University and North Carolina Central University, two liberal arts universities located in Durham, North Carolina. The architecture within the district not only displays the work of unknown skilled designers, masons, and Charles C. Hartmann, one of North Carolina's most important architects practicing in the post-World War I era; it also reflects the evolution of higher education for people of color within the state of North Carolina.

As of June 2014, the size of the daily zipped file is about 5-12 MB. The data files use Conflict and Mediation Event Observations (CAMEO) coding for recording events. In a blog post for Foreign Policy, co-creator Kalev Leetaru attempted to use GDELT data to answer the question of whether the Arab Spring sparked protests worldwide, using the quotient of the number of protest-related events to the total number of events recorded as a measure of protest intensity for which the time trend was then studied. Political scientist and data science/forecasting expert Jay Ulfelder critiqued the post on his personal blog, saying that Leetaru's normalization method may not have adequately accounted for the change in the nature and composition of media coverage. The dataset is also available on Google Cloud Platform and can be accessed using Google BigQuery. Reception =Academic reception= GDELT has been cited and used in a number of academic studies, such as a study of visual and predictive analytics of Singapore news (along with Wikipedia and the Straits Times Index) and a study of political conflict. The challenge problem at the 2014 International Social Computing, Behavioral Modeling and Prediction Conference (SBP) asked participants to explore GDELT and apply it to the analysis of social networks, behavior, and prediction. =Reception in blogs and media= GDELT has been covered on the website of the Center for Data Innovation as well as the GIS Lounge. It has also been discussed and critiqued on blogs about political violence and crisis prediction. The dataset has been cited and critiqued repeatedly in Foreign Policy, including in discussions of political events in Syria, the Arab Spring, and Nigeria. It has also been cited in New Scientist, on the FiveThirtyEight website and Andrew Sullivan's blog. The Predictive Heuristics blog and other blogs have compared GDELT with the Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS). Alex Hanna blogged about her experiment assessing GDELT with handcoded data by comparing it with the Dynamics of Collective Action dataset. In May 2014, the Google Cloud Platform blog announced that the entire GDELT dataset would be available as a public dataset in Google BigQuery.

As a form of prosocial behavior, children's work is often a vital contribution towards community productivity and typically involves non-exploitative motivations for children's engagement in work activities. Activities can range from domestic household chores to participation in family and community endeavors. Inge Bolin notes that children's work can blur the boundaries between learning, play, and work in a form of productive interaction between children and adults. Such activities do not have to be mutually exclusive. __TOC__ Child work and indigenous American communities Children's work is a valued means of learning and child-rearing in many Indigenous American communities. It is seen as eagerly contributing in a collaborative and flexible environment, aimed at the children learning consideration, responsibility, and skills with the guidance and support of adults. Indigenous American children are motivated to participate in the community because of cultural values, for example, everyone does something to participate, and wanting to be an equal member of society. The children do not see it as working, but as helping, because they feel responsible for what happens within their communities. As demonstrated by a Mexican Nahua community, children are encouraged to begin child work at the age of two for about 6 to 7 hours a day. They do not need to be convinced to help, but want to be involved in the activity. Child work can be household help, taking care of family members, or helping in community endeavors. Indigenous American children learn functional life skills through real-time observation of adults and interactive participation of these learned skills within the community. Active contributions to family and community work directly affects children's cognitive maturity by allowing children agency over their own development. This maturity at a younger age allows children to perform, potentially, higher-skilled tasks. For example, younger children have shown initiative by helping strangers to make them feel like a part of the community. Children do this by offering to help strangers or by treating them like family.Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect child rearing in highland Peru. Austin: University of Texas Press. This maturity comes from the community fully incorporating children at a young age and allowing them to participate in everyday tasks. The community trusts their children and treats them as equals, so the children want to engage in the community as much as they can. For example, parents trust their children to translate and negotiate bills with people, when the parents cannot speak the language. For example, the maturity that indigenous American children develop is demonstrated in Zinacantec Mayan communities, where children learn complex motor skills and techniques for weaving through keen observation of working adults and by executing the skills themselves. Also, in Peru, young Chillihuani boys learn how to build shelters and homes by actively assisting adults during the building process by moving and placing appropriate size stones. Ethnographic studies show that Indigenous American children learn intently through keen observation in activities by other children. Children's work is also attributed to learning cultural values in addition to individual personality development. Many Indigenous children in Peru develop a sense of responsibility by participating in work often motivated by an internal and external drive to be an active participant in the community. Paradise & De Haan refer to this process as practicing responsibility and reciprocity through role-taking as an observing helper or active performer. Through participation in work, most children in Indigenous American communities identify as cooperative members of a community through first-hand exposure to the direct impact of their action or inaction in community responsibilities. In Guatemalan Mayan communities, children are often expected to take part in these practices. When schools became prevalent, children who were not seen as providing valuable contributions to family and community endeavors may only then be sent away to school to make use of their time. Some indigenous communities are skeptical of sending their children to western schools, because their children lose the initiative to help their families and are not as motivated. Western schooling is a different way of teaching than indigenous communities teach their children.Lynn,S. (2007). Transborder Lives: Indigenous Oaxacans in Mexico, California, and Oregon. Duke University Press, 2007. However, children that go through western schooling learn English and end up translating for their families, which is another way of helping them or another way of learning. The children perfect their English and Spanish, as well as their social skills because they interact with many types of people by translating for their families. =Learning by Observing and Pitching In= The initiative that indigenous children demonstrate is part of the process of Learning by Observing and Pitching In. LOPI is a six faceted process of learning commonly used by indigenous American cultures. Also known by \\"Intent Community Participation,\\" it fully immerses a child into the community and allows them to learn, through observation and participation, as they help within their family as well as within their community. Children learn through their work, which is a cultural tradition among indigenous people. Child work is a social experience that allows a child to gain a sense of responsibility and build ties among the community. LOPI is distinctly different from traditional forms of Western learning. Instead of focusing on \\"formal\\" or instructional learning in school settings which typically place emphasis on children's motivation and attention capabilities, LOPI engages with their everyday lives. As it seems, the way in which society decides to teach children falls on either end of the spectrum (LOPI or Westernization ways) rather than on the basis of a continuum. LOPI, as stated above, places high emphasis on integration of children in the endeavors of their families and community. The six faceted process of learning can be summarized as follows: community organization of learning, motive, social organization of endeavors, goal of learning, learning according to means, and communication. An important aspect of the LOPI model is the in-depth ethnographic and biological observations as well as comparative studies that were used to generate the facets about Indigenous American communities. It is necessary to take into consideration the model of LOPI as a coherent system as each facet plays a role in relation to the next. It is also possible to compare LOPI to Assembly- Line Instruction which aims to control the learner's attention, motivation, and behavior in the community. This approach was originally founded due to the influx of new students as a result of immigration. In this approach, school and activities related to family and community are segregated. There are large contrasting differences in the collaborative guidance and the control of the learner's attention and behavior between LOPI and Assembly-Line Instruction. As learning works, there are several different approaches one can take and culture and generational differences have influential effects. Most real life situations will not strictly adhere to either of these models. The original intent of LOPI was to study cultural differences in learning across nations rather than to make assumptions based on race, ethnicity, or national origins. International Labour Organization recognition of child work vs. child labour The International Labour Organization recognizes the importance of child work in various cultures. In most Indigenous communities, work is a source of pride for both adults and children. Because of different cultural views involving labor, the International Labour Organization (ILO) developed a series of culturally sensitive mandates including Conventions No. 169, 107, 138, and 182 to protect indigenous culture, traditions, and identities. Conventions No. 138 and 182 lead in the fight against child labour, while No. 107 and 169 promote the right of indigenous and tribal peoples and protect their right to define their own developmental priorities. The ILO recognizes these changes are necessary to respect the culture and traditions of other communities while also looking after the welfare of children. In many Indigenous communities, parenting includes teaching children to learn important life lessons through the act of work and through participation in daily life. Working is seen as a learning process preparing children for the tasks they will have to do as an adult. It is a belief that the family's and child’s well-being and survival is a shared responsibility between members of the whole family. They also see work as an intrinsic part of their child's developmental process. While these attitudes toward child work remain, many children and parents from indigenous communities still highly value education. ILO wants to include these communities in the fight against exploitative child labor while being sensitive to their traditions and values.

The strain CTV-05 is used as a probiotic that can be used by premenopausal and postmenopausal women that experience recurrent urinary tract infections. It is being evaluated specifically for the prevention and treatment of bacterial vaginosis, which is characterized by the absence of lactobacillus flora necessary to protect the host from infection. History L. crispatus was first isolated in 1953 by Brygoo and Aladame, who proposed it as a new species of the genus Eubacterium. In the 1970s the type strain VPI 3199 (ATCC 33820) of L. crispatus (at the time still designated “Eubacterium crispatum”) was deposited in the collection of the Anaerobe Laboratory, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI), where it was identified as a Lactobacillus and characterized by Moore and Holdeman. Addressing the problem of genetic heterogeneity among a vast number of strains identified as L. acidophilus based on phenotypic similarity, Johnson et al. performed DNA homology experiments on 89 previously proposed L. acidophilus strains and delineated six distinct homology groups. Only the strains pertaining to DNA homology group A1 were still designated L. acidophilus. Strains in the homology groups A2, A3, A4, B1 and B2 were proposed to be distinct species and later reclassified as L. crispatus, L. amylovorus, L. gallinarum, L. gasseri and L. johnsonii respectively. In the case of L. crispatus this happened in 1983 as Cato and her coworkers recharacterized strain VPI 3199 and discovered 100% DNA homology with VPI 7635 (ATCC 33197), the type strain of “L. acidophilus” group A2.  Taxonomy  It is a species in the phylum Firmicutes, in the class Bacilli, in the order Lactobacillales, in the family Lactobacillaceae and the genus Lactobacillus. It is one of 122 other species identified within the genus.  Genome  Even within L. crispatus there is substantial genetic variation: strains of L. crispatus have genome sizes ranging from 1.83 to 2.7 Mb, and encode 1,839 (EM-LC1) to 2,688 (FB077-07) proteins. The genome of Lactobacillus crispatus strain ST1, which colonizes chicken, consists of about 2,043,161 nucleotides and encodes 2,024 proteins, 76 RNA genes and has a circular chromosomal shape.  Ecology  The strain of Lactobacillus crispastus was originally isolated from a pouch in a chicken gullet and is considered to be one of the strongest H2O2-producing lactobacilli. Like many other Lactobacillus species, it can be severely altered by changes to the immune system, hormone levels and from the use of antimicrobials. Lactobacillus crispatus is a normal inhabitant of the lower reproductive tract in healthy women. Probiotic use CTV-05 gelatin suppository capsules are inserted into the vagina as a probiotic that can help maintain healthy flora. Studies have shown that L. crispastus CTV-05 effectively colonized the vagina and helped prevent and treat recurrent bacterial vaginosis and other genital infections. Scientists have stated that evidence from clinical trials proves that these probiotics will safely and effectively treat bacterial vaginosis if used alone or alongside an antibiotic treatment if an infection had already arisen.Randomized Trial of Lactin-V to Prevent Recurrence of Bacterial Vaginosis N Engl J Med 2020; 382:1906-1915, DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1915254 Condom use has showed increased colonization of Lactobacillus crispatus in the vagina because it protects against both bacterial vaginosis (BV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Methanosarcina barkeri can produce methane anaerobically through different metabolic pathways. M. barkeri can subsume a variety of molecules for ATP production, including methanol, acetate, methylamines, and different forms of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Although it is a slow developer and is sensitive to change in environmental conditions, M. barkeri is able to grow in a variety of different substrates, adding to its appeal for genetic analysis. Additionally, M. barkeri is the first organism in which the amino acid pyrrolysine was found. Furthermore, two strains of M. barkeri, M. b. Fusaro and M. b. MS have been identified to possess an F-type ATPase (unusual for archaea, but common for bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts) along with an A-type ATPase.  Location and structure  The fusaro strain of M. barkeri was found in mud samples taken from Lake Fusaro, a freshwater lake near Naples. M. barkeri also lives in the rumen of cattle, where it works in tandem with other microbes to digest polymers. Methanosarcina barkeri can also be found in sewage, landfills, and in other freshwater systems. Morphology of Methanosarcina cells depends on growing conditions, e.g. on salt concentrations. M. barkeri shows this variable morphology: when grown in freshwater medium, these microbes grow into large, multicellular aggregates embedded in a matrix of methanochondroitin, while growing in marine environment as single, irregular cocci, only surrounded by the S-layer, but no methanochondroitin. The aggregates can grow large enough to be seen by the naked eye. Methanosarcina could produce positive Gram stain, but generally, it is Gram variable. M. barkeri has a thick cell wall compounded by a short lipid cell membrane that is similar in structure to most other methanogens. However, its cell walls do not contain peptidoglycan. M. barkeri str. fusaro has no flagellum but has potential for movement through the creation of gas vesicles. These gas vesicles have only been produced in the presence of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, likely acting as a response to a hydrogen gradient. M. barkeris chromosome is large and circular, derived from its remarkable ability to metabolize a variety of different carbon molecules. This offers the species an advantage as though it is immotile, it can adapt to its environment depending on the energy sources available. M. barkeris circular plasmid consists of about twenty genes.  Applications and importance  Methanosarcina barkeris unique nature as an anaerobic methanogen that ferments many carbon sources can have many implications for future biotechnology and environmental studies. As M. barkeri is found in the rumen of cows, a place with an extreme dearth of oxygen, it is classified as an extreme anaerobe. Furthermore, the methane gas produced by cows due to M. barkeri could play a role in greenhouse gas production. However, since M. barkeri can survive in extreme conditions and produce methane, M. barkeri can be implemented in low pH ecosystems, effectively neutralizing the acidity environment, and making it more amenable for other methanogens. This, in turn, would allow people to harness the pure methane produced at landfills or through cow waste. Evidently, the implications of M. barkeri are those aligned with potential alternative energy and investment.

That season would be the last season of Lega Pro 2nd Division, as the 2 divisions of Lega Pro (ex–Serie C) would be merged, as well as reduction from 69 teams to 60 teams. On 5 August the LP 2nd Division also admitted 6 additional teams from Serie D to fill the vacancies. Sorrento finished as the 9th of Group B, 1 point below Vigor Lamezia. The hope of avoid relegation was humiliated by 0–4 lost to Arzanese in the first match of relegation tie-breaker, or \\"play-out\\". Eventually Sorrento lost 3–4 in aggregate despite a 3–0 home win. Danucci had played both matches as starting XI. References External links AIC profile (data by football.it) * Lega Serie B profile * Italian footballers Taranto F.C. 1927 players A.S.D.

Hong founded a Holy Mountain retreat (圣山) and Stone Tablet Church (石牌教会) in Kaohsiung. The New Testament Church is currently based at Mount Zion in Southern Taiwan, which \\"is both a pilgrimage destination and nature-based utopian community of several hundred adherents\\" and, the church believes, the setting for the impending Great Tribulation. in 1988, Zuo Kun (左坤), a former leader of the Church, organized a splinter group known as The Blood and Water of Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit Full Gospel Evangelistic Band(血水圣灵全备福音布道团), or The Church Rebuilt by the Holy Spirit’ (圣灵重建教会), and in 1989 started clandestine missions to Mainland China. Jiang taught a Pentecostal theology but her insistence that her was the only true church led to the New Testament Church being criticized as a cult both in Taiwan and China. Hong added additional claims, insisting that Jiang and himself were the end-time prophets predicted in the Book of Revelation and that Mount Zion in Taiwan was the exact place of Christ's imminent return. Zuo Kun's splinter branch believes that the true end-time prophet, with a role parallel to the one of Moses, is Zuo himself.

The service also includes Google Docs and Google Slides, a word processor and presentation program respectively. Google Sheets is available as a web application, mobile app for Android, iOS, Windows, BlackBerry, and as a desktop application on Google's ChromeOS. The app is compatible with Microsoft Excel file formats. The app allows users to create and edit files online while collaborating with other users in real-time. Edits are tracked by user with a revision history presenting changes. An editor's position is highlighted with an editor-specific color and cursor and a permissions system regulates what users can do. Updates have introduced features using machine learning, including \\"Explore\\", offering answers based on natural language questions in a spreadsheet.  History  Google Sheets originated from XL2Web, a web-based spreadsheet application developed by 2Web Technologies, which was acquired by Google in 2006 and turned into Google Labs Spreadsheets. It was launched as a test for a limited number of users, on a first-come, first-served basis on June 6, 2006. The limited test was later replaced with a beta version available to all Google Account holders, around the same time as an official announcement press release was issued. In March 2010, Google acquired the online document collaboration company DocVerse. DocVerse allowed multiple-user online collaboration on Excel-compatible document as well as other Microsoft Office formats such as Word and PowerPoint. Improvements based on DocVerse were announced and deployed in April 2010. In June 2012, Google acquired Quickoffice, a freeware proprietary productivity suite for mobile devices. In October 2012, Google Spreadsheets was renamed Google Sheets and a Chrome app was released that provided shortcuts to Sheets on Chrome's new tab page.  Platforms  Google Sheets is available as a web application supported on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari web browsers. Users can access all spreadsheets, among other files, collectively through the Google Drive website. In June 2014, Google rolled out a dedicated website homepage for Sheets that contain only files created with Sheets. In 2014, Google launched a dedicated mobile app for Sheets on the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. In 2015, the mobile website for Sheets was updated with a \\"simpler, more uniform\\" interface, and while users can read spreadsheets through the mobile websites, users trying to edit will be redirected towards the mobile app to eliminate editing on the mobile web.  Features  = Editing =  Collaboration and revision history  Google Sheets serves as a collaborative tool for cooperative editing of spreadsheets in real-time. Documents can be shared, opened, and edited by multiple users simultaneously and users are able to see character-by-character changes as other collaborators make edits. Changes are automatically saved to Google's servers, and a revision history is automatically kept so past edits may be viewed and reverted to. An editor's current position is represented with an editor-specific color/cursor, so if another editor happens to be viewing that part of the document they can see edits as they occur. A sidebar chat functionality allows collaborators to discuss edits. The revision history allows users to see the additions made to a document, with each author distinguished by color. Only adjacent revisions can be compared, and users cannot control how frequently revisions are saved. Files can be exported to a user's local computer in a variety of formats such as PDF and Office Open XML. Sheets supports tagging for archival and organizational purposes.  Explore  Launched for the entire Drive suite in September 2016, \\"Explore\\" enables additional functionality through machine learning. In Google Sheets, Explore enables users to ask questions, such as \\"How many units were sold on Black Friday?\\", and Explore will return the answer, without requiring formula knowledge from the user. In June 2017, Google expanded the Explore feature in Google Sheets to automatically build charts and visualize data, and again expanded it in December to feature machine learning capable of automatically creating pivot tables. In October 2016, Google announced the addition of \\"Action items\\" to Sheets. If a user assigns a task within a Sheet, the service will intelligently assign that action to the designated user. Google states this will make it easier for other collaborators to visualize who is responsible for a task. When a user visits Google Drive or Sheets, any files containing tasks assigned to them will be highlighted with a badge. In March 2014, Google introduced add-ons; new tools from third-party developers that add more features for Google Sheets. Offline editing In order to view and edit spreadsheets offline on a computer, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser. A Chrome extension, Google Docs Offline, allows users to enable offline support for Sheets and other Drive suite files on the Google Drive website. The Android and iOS apps natively support offline editing. = Files =  Supported file formats and limits Files in the following formats can be viewed and converted to the Sheets format: .xls (if newer than Microsoft Office 95), .xlsx, .xlsm, .xlt, .xltx, .xltm .ods, .csv, .tsv, .txt, .tab Overall document size is capped at 5 million cells. = Google Workspace = The Sheets app and the rest of the Google Docs suite are free to use for individuals, but Sheets is also available as part of the business-centered Google Workspace (formerly G Suitehttps://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/introducing-google- workspace) service by Google, which is a monthly subscription that enables additional business-focused functionality. = Integration with Charts and Wikipedia = Sheets can produce Google Charts and has a third-party plugin which allows for integration with Wikipedia. = Other functionality = A simple find and replace tool is available. The service includes a web clipboard tool that allows users to copy and paste content between Google Sheets and Docs, Slides, and Drawings. The web clipboard can also be used for copying and pasting content between different computers. Copied items are stored on Google's servers for up to 30 days. Google offers an extension for the Google Chrome web browser called Office editing for Docs, Sheets and Slides that enables users to view and edit Microsoft Excel documents on Google Chrome, via the Sheets app. The extension can be used for opening Excel files stored on the computer using Chrome, as well as for opening files encountered on the web (in the form of email attachments, web search results, etc.) without having to download them. The extension is installed on Chrome OS by default. As of June 2019, this extension is no longer required since the functionality exists natively. Google Cloud Connect was a plug-in for Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and 2010 that could automatically store and synchronize any Excel document to Google Sheets (before the introduction of Drive). The online copy was automatically updated each time the Microsoft Excel document was saved. Microsoft Excel documents could be edited offline and synchronized later when online. Google Cloud Connect maintained previous Microsoft Excel document versions and allowed multiple users to collaborate by working on the same document at the same time. However, Google Cloud Connect has been discontinued as of April 30, 2013, as, according to Google, Google Drive achieves all of the above tasks, \\"with better results\\". While Microsoft Excel maintains the 1900 Leap year bug. Google sheets 'fixes' this bug by increasing all dates prior to March 1, 1900, so entering \\"0\\" and formatting it as a date returns December 30, 1899. On the other hand. Excel treats \\"0\\" as December 31, 1899, which is formatted to read January 0, 1900.

Directed by Anil Kumar, this Telugu serial has completed 2,864 episodes (as of 24 March 2020) and is still on the air. The pilot episode aired in 2011.  Plot  The story starts with Mr. Koteshwar Rao (Koti), who works for Harshavardan, a man of high status and affluence. Koti, a simple lower-middle class man, lives with his wife and their daughter, Archana, a beautiful girl with praiseworthy character. Archana is valued by Mr. Koti's boss, but Harshavardan's horrible daughter, Soundarya, is jealous of Archana and pulls pranks on her. The story then turns to Ramprasad, an industrial worker whose wife Pooja dies, leaving his daughter Lalli (Lalitha) and him alone. Meanwhile, Archana joins a school as a teacher and is assigned to Lalli's class. Archana soon learns about Lalli and is highly empathetic towards her, which allows them to form a friendship. Shortly thereafter Ramprasad and Archana marry, and Lalli gains a loving mother for herself. The newly formed family starts living happily with Ramprasad's parents, his brother Krishna, and his sister. Meanwhile, Soundarya keeps trying to cause problems for them, and in a turn of events, marries Krishna, Ramprasad's brother. She soon starts causing trouble for everyone in the house. She robs Ramprasad's father, who then dies of grief. The story now turns to Gayatri Devi, a wealthy widow with a son called Bunny. Ramprasad and his family begin to lead a normal life, until Archana suddenly dies in an accident. Meanwhile, Soundarya divorces Krishna and marries Gayatri Devi's rich cousin, Shashank. The two of them then decide to kill Gayatri Devi and take her wealth. The plot thickens when Krishna claims to have seen Archana. Knowing that this is impossible, Ramprasad does not believe him, but it is later discovered that Archana has a lookalike. The girl falls in love with Krishna and they get married. In another twist of events, however, Archana turns out to be not dead at all! She chose to run away from the house because she was unhappy. She now works as a laborer on a construction site which belongs to Gayatri Devi. Soon Gayatri Devi is murdered by Soundarya and Shashank. During the murder, Archana gets injured badly, scarring her face. The doctors decide to put Gayatri Devi's face on Archana to save her from an untimely death. After recovery, the doctors reveal the truth to Archana and she agrees to take Gayatri Devi's identity. Soundarya is shocked to see Gayatri Devi (who is actually Archana) still alive. A bit later, Krishna and Archana's lookalike leave for the USA. Back at the real Archana's home, Bunny runs away. He is taken care of by a taxi driver's family and changes his name to Raja. As Raja, he now has a new enemy named Ashok. By this point, Soundraya has been found guilty and has been jailed for the murder of Gayatri Devi. Ashok is a police officer who holds a grudge against Raja. Raja flees his village and settles down in Hyderabad, moving in with a criminal called Shankar and his sister Laxmi. Ashok and Raja start fighting over Lalli, Ramprasad's now grown-up daughter. Lalli, however, ends up marrying Ashok. At this time, Krishna and his daughter Chandu land at Hyderabad. They tell their family that Archana's lookalike died in the USA. Archana now reveals her actual identity to the family. Also, Raja learns of his real family history and inherits much money, so he starts an orphanage. Also, Shankar is killed by Ashok. Shankar's sister, Laxmi, falls in love with Raja, but Raja is in love with Chandu. Laxmi gives up on her pursuit for Raja and commits suicide. Due to certain misunderstandings, Raja and Chandu break up. However, when they are arguing one day, Raja proposes to Chandu out of nowhere. However, Chandu and Raja don't reveal this to anyone. They soon start living together again and reveal their marriage plans to everyone. Ramprasad does not agree to the marriage, and begins arguing with Raja. Due to all his stress, however, he dies of a heart attack. Another twist in the tale arises when Archana's look alike is found again. Her real name is Jayanthi and owns a construction company: Jayanthi Constructions. Krishna is shocked by this. He starts working for the company, but realizes that Jayanthi is really a mean woman who shows no sympathy on her employees. One day, Chandu meets Jayanthi in her office. By the help of Jayanthi's father, who wants Jayanthi to marry, Chandu decides to get her father and Jayanthi married. Chandu convinces Jayanthi, and Jayanthi starts impressing Krishna. Right when Krishna agrees to marry Jayanthi, a case is put on Krishna. The girl who put the case on Krishna, Bhargavi, claims that Krishna is her father. Krishna disagrees, saying that he had no relations of these kind. But Bhargavi says that her mother, Soundarya, had written these truths when she was in jail and had even given birth to her in jail. She also had died in the jail. The judge asks for a DNA test, which shows that Bhargavi was Krishna's daughter. Krishna then gets to know that Bhargavi had asked her friend to add some medicine in Krishna's Thumbs Up which he was drinking that day. Then Soundarya cheated. The friend tells this truth to Krishna, who now believes it and goes to Bhargavi. Bhargavi uses him as a servant, making up for the time Krishna didn't spend with her. Meanwhile, Chandu is diagnosed with brain cancer. She doesn't tell this to anyone and decides to leave everyone and everything and start fighting against Raja now, as she didn't want anyone to feel bad because of her death. Raja eventually gets angry and leaves her. Chandu then finds out about this doctor called Chakravarthy, who leaves his wife and daughter Pinky due to some misunderstandings with his wife. Chandu then makes it her mission to join this family. She keeps trying, and Chandu's family keep searching for her. When she succeeds, Dr. Chakravarthy finds out about her disease and decides to cure her. The operation goes on, and Chandu's family is there in the hospital. Chandu is cured, but then the doctors realize that her eyesight is gone. Chandu stays blind for a few days before she is cured. Raja and Chandu get back together, and right when everything seems right, Bhargavi starts eyeing on Raja. She starts making Chandu suspicious of Raja, making her feel that Raja is cheating on her with Bhargavi. That's when Bhargavi files a case on Raja saying that he had tried to rape her. Raja, with perfect evidence, wins the case. Archana now runs the orphanage that was started by Raja. That's when Chandu gets pregnant. When her good friend, a doctor, mentions to Krishna that she won't be able to have children and that Dr. Chakravarthy had mentioned this fact to her after Chandu's brain cancer operation. Everyone was happy at that time, no one got this topic. Chandu, was already holding grudges against Krishna Prasad, as she felt that her father had left her and was only with Bhargavi. Krishna comes and asks Chandu to get aborted, but does not mention the reason to her. Chandu feels that her father hates her now and that he never wants to see her happy, so she tells him to get lost. But when her friend slowly mentions the fact to Chandu, she sadly has to agree. After the operation, the doctor says that Chandu's problem has now been cured! Things between Chandu and her dad then cool down. Again after some time, Chandu gets pregnant. Bhargavi Targets chandu and tries to get her killed. With the help of a doctor she survives and has a plastic surgery as her face is beyond repair. Raja thinks chandu is dead and gets married to another woman. Some years later, Raja's son is now grown up. Raja finds out that chnadu is alive and unites with her. Raja's son gets married to a woman named Kaveri. It is revealed that kaveri is working with bhargavi. Kaveri kills Raja, but later finds out the truth about bhargavi. Bhargavi tries to get Raja's son killed but is saved from drowning by a young girl named Ganga. The police take bhargavi into custody. Chandu and Kaveri live happily. Story shifts to Ganga. She lives with an older sister and parents. She kills a man when he tries to molest her mother and goes to jail. She grows up in the jail, with the jailor looking after her. Once she is released from the jail, she initially has some troubles but reunites with her family. Her sister marries a police officer and she falls in love with someone else. Story also adds Kalyan babu whose wife dies and leaves him and their daughter madhu. Same time Ganga has an accident and her eyes are replaced with Kalyan Babu's wife's eyes. She then gets the memories of Kalyan babu's wife into herself and starts feeling of madhu as hew own. However all this gets resolved and ganga reunites with her love and gets married. After some years a grown up Madhu's story continues.

History The church of San Nicandro was supposedly founded in the tenth century when the relics of the saint were discovered. The present church dates to the 13th century with rustic stone façade with a rose window in Romanesque style. The façade was reconstructed in the 1500s, along with an adjacent convent. The present belltower was built in 1949. The church was assigned to Basilian order, until it was abolished by Pope Sixtus V in 1554. For some years the church was abandoned, but in 1573, it was taken up by the Capuchin order. The convent was suppressed in 1811, although the order returned in 1816, until the church was passed to the Commune by 1867. In 1870, the convent passed on the Franciscan order. The interior decoration in stucco was completed in the late 19th century. The lateral nave has a wooden painted crucifix dating to the late 14th century. The main altarpiece depicts a Virgin, child and Saints Francis, Nicandro and Marciano by Teodoro d'Errico. In the crypt below the altar are the rests of San Nicandro.

It owned a number of clippers including the historic tea clipper Cutty Sark.  Company history and its people  The company was founded in London by John 'Jock' Willis (1791–1862), a ship captain (nicknamed 'Old Stormy Willis'). Jock Willis had joined ships sailing along the British coast after having run away from his home at Eyemouth, Berwickshire, when he was 14 years old. During one of his sailing voyages to London, he found employment at a pub frequented by seafarers in the New India Dock (now Canary Wharf). He saved the money earned there, supplemented by money earned by repairing seafarers' sea shanty musical instruments. He returned to sail on the West Indiamen as a second and Chief Mate. Willis married Janet Dunbar on 23 July 1815, and the couple had nine children – six sons and three daughters – of whom the eldest was also named John. In 1826, he started his own ship owning company, registered in London. The younger Jock Willis (1817–1899), himself a ship master, took over his father's firm of ship owners. Also known as 'White Hat Willis', it was during his time that the company built and owned clippers like Cutty Sark. The other sons, too, joined the company in various capacities – either sailing on their ships or working in their offices.  Trade  Their ships focused on the tea trade between China, the far east and United Kingdom and the wool trade with Australia.  Ships  A Willis Tea Line Clipper, by Frederick Tudgay The first vessel purchased by John Willis was the 253-ton Sunderland- built barque Demarara Planter in 1830, which sailed to the West Indies. Many of the ships later built by the firm were named after places in Willis' native county of Berwickshire. Company ships included: * Demerara Planter (1830) * Janet Willis (1835) * John Willis (1839) * Whampoa (1842) * Borderer (1845) * Saint Abbs (1848) * Janet Willis (1850) * Merse (1853) * Berwickshire (1855) * Lammermuir (1856) * Lauderdale (1858) * Laurel (1861) * Albuera (1862) * Whiteadder (1862) * The Tweed (acquired 1863; launched 1854 as the Punjaub) * Lammermuir (1864) * Zenobia (1867) * Borderer (1868) * Dharwar (1868) * Coldinghame (1869) * Cutty Sark (1869) * Blackadder (1870) * Hallowe'en (1872) * Coldstream (1875) * Jumna (1875) * Fantasie (1877) * Sumatra (1878) * Taitsing (1880)  Motto  The stern of Cutty Sark, showing the Willis logo The company's motto, 'Where there's a will is a way', was a pun on the family name, and was displayed on the stern of all Willis ships.  1899 – the end  The company was dissolved in 1899, with the sale of the Cutty Sark.

Currently there are two types of spermbots. The first type, the tubular spermbot, consists of a single sperm cell that is captured inside a microtube. Single bull sperm cells enter these microtubes and become trapped inside. The tail of the sperm is the driving force for the microtube. The second type, the helical spermbot, is a small helix structure which captures and transports single immotile sperm cells. In this case, a rotating magnetic field drives the helix in a screw-like motion. Both kinds of spermbots can be guided by weak magnetic fields. These two spermbot designs are hybrid microdevices, they consist of a living cell combined with synthetic attachments. Other approaches exist to create purely synthetic microdevices inspired by the swimming of natural sperm cells, i.e. with a biomimetic design, for example so-called Magnetosperm which are made of a flexible polymeric structure coated with a magnetic layer and can be actuated by a magnetic field. Design = Tubular spermbots = Initially, the microtubes for the tubular spermbots were made using roll-up nanotechnology on photoresist. In this process, thin films of titanium and iron were deposited onto a sacrificial layer. When the sacrificial layer was removed, the thin films rolled into 50 µm long microtubes with a diameter of 5 - 8 µm. Later on, the microtubes were made from a temperature-responsive polymer to enable the controlled release of the sperm cells upon a small temperature change of a few degrees. Tubular spermbots are assembled by adding a large amount of the microtubes to a diluted sperm sample under the microscope. The sperm cells randomly enter the microtubes and become trapped in their slightly conical cavity. In order to increase the coupling efficiency between sperm cells and microtubes, the microtubes have been functionalized with proteins or sperm chemoattractant. This has been done using thiol chemistry once the tubes are rolled-up or by transferring the molecules with an elastomer stamp onto the material before rolling the tubes. = Helical spermbots = Helical spermbots are assembled by driving a magnetic microhelix over an individual sperm cell, thereby confining its tail inside the helix lumen and pushing the head of the sperm forward. The sperm cell is loosely coupled to the helix and can be released by reversing the rotation of the helix, letting it withdraw from the head and free the confined tail in the process. Such microhelices were fabricated by direct laser lithography and coated with nickel or iron for magnetization. Navigation Robotic sperm can be navigated by weak external magnetic fields of a few mT. These fields can be generated by permanent magnets or by a setup of electromagnets. The applied magnetic field can be a homogeneous, rotating, or gradient field. Tubular and helical spermbots can also be navigated in a closed-loop control scheme with an electromagnetic coil setup. Applications Spermbots hold promise for potential application in single cell manipulation and assisted reproduction, but also for targeted drug delivery. A recent study shows that modified tubular spermbots can be used for delivery of cancer drugs. In this case, the sperm cell is loaded with doxorubicin. The artificial microstructure fabricated by two-photon nanolithography captures the drug-loaded sperm cell. The sperm cell is the actuation source for the magnetic microstructure and can propel it to cancer spheroids. At this location, the drug-loaded sperm is released by a spring mechanism and the sperm cell delivers the drug to the cancer cells.  Perspectives  Robotic sperms as microswimmers are interesting for diverse biomedical applications, specifically for new assisted fertilization techniques and for the targeted delivery of therapeutic cargo. These microswimmers are meant to operate in in vivo environments, a feature that may revolutionize assisted reproduction technologies and nanomedicine in the future. New designs are emerging and plenty of applications can be derived from the here reported concept.

George Nazos (Greek: Γιώργος Νάζος Giórgios Názos) (1862 – 1934) was a Greek music teacher and director of the Athens Conservatoire. He was from a well-known family from Tinos Island. He was recognized for his musical talent at a young age. In 1881 he went to Munich, Germany to study piano and advanced theory, returning to Greece in 1886.  Career  In 1891, Nazos was appointed musical director of the Athens Conservatory, which he reorganized by hiring foreign teachers. Specifically, he proceeded to Germanize the curriculum, perhaps influenced by his studies in Munich, and apply progressive educational methods, which led to the founding of the Conservatory's student orchestra, the first incarnation of what was to become the Athens State Orchestra upon nationalization. He also founded or was important to the founding of the Conservatory's drama, opera, Byzantine, and military band departments, and contributed to Greek legislation pertaining to music education. As a teacher, he taught in piano, voice, and music theory. In his field, he dealt with scientific research and the collection of Greek traditional songs from the Peloponnesus and Crete. This research work was published in Athens under the title of Peninta dimódi ásmata Peloponnisou kai Kritis (Fifty traditional songs from Peloponnesus and Crete). Nazos was a dedicated professional musician, and his contribution to conservatories, schools, orchestras, and theatre was significant. Through 30 years of effort, he laid the foundations of Greek music education.  References  Katochianou, A., Tiliakos, K. & Tselikas I. (Eds.). (2004). ). Egkyklopaidiko Lexiko tis Klasikis Mousikis.

He was succeeded as warlord by his son, Zhang Xueliang (Chang Hsueh-liang), who agreed to Manchuria's nominal subordination to Chiang Kai-Shek's government.Keegan, pp. 34-35 Zhu Qinglan about the time he was president of the Chinese Eastern Railway Even so, turmoil continued in Manchuria and neighboring Inner Mongolia. A Barga uprising led by the Inner Mongolian politician Merse in August 1928 was unsuccessful, but arrest by the Chinese of the manager of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Mikhail Mikhailovich Lashevich, precipitated Lashevich's suicide on 30 August 1928. Lashevich was succeeded as manager by Alexander Ivanovich Yemshanov, who was ousted when war broke out between China and the Soviet Union and Zhang Xueliang seized control of the railway on 10 July 1929. Zhang installed Fan Qiguang (Fan Chi-kuang) as acting manager.

The Mukden Incident of 18 September 1931 was followed by the gradual Japanese occupation of Manchuria, which was organized into the puppet state of Manchukuo on 18 February 1932. Pu Yi, the last Qing emperor of China, was installed as emperor of Manchukuo by the Japanese on 1 March 1932. It was in this context that Zhu Qinglan organized the Northeastern Army Volunteer Support Society in February 1932. The territory claimed by Manchukuo included the Chinese province of Jehol, and on 21 January 1933 the puppet government proclaimed its annexation. Japanese troops crossed the border on 23 February to added Jehol to Manchukuo. Zhu Qinglan commanded a brigade in the Battle of Rehe (23 February-1 March 1933), but his troops performed so poorly that Zhang Zueliang ordered his arrest. However, Zhang himself was soon after relieved of command. By 12 March 1933, all of China north of the Great Wall was under Japanese control.Keegan, pp. 34-35 Zhu Qinglan in later life Zhu Qinglan spent his last years in Xian (Sian), where he died on 13 January 1941.
