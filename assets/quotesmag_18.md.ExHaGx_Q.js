Faith Bandler (27 September 1918 13 February 2015; n√©e Ida Lessing Faith Mussing) was an Australian civil rights activist of South Sea Islander and Scottish-Indian heritage. She was a campaigner for the rights of indigenous Australians and South Sea Islanders. Bandler was best known for her leadership in the campaign for the 1967 referendum on Aboriginal Australians. Early life and family Bandler was born in Tumbulgum, New South Wales, and raised on a farm near Murwillumbah. Her father had been blackbirded from Ambrym Island, Vanuatu, in 1883, at the age of about 13. He was then sent to Mackay, Queensland, before being sent to work on a sugar cane plantation. He later escaped and married Bandler's mother, a Scottish-Indian woman from New South Wales. Her father, Wacvie Mussingkon, son of Baddick and Lessing Mussingkon, was taken as a boy in 1883 from Biap, on the island of Ambrym in what is now Vanuatu. His abduction was part of blackbirding, the practice which brought cheap labour to help establish the Australian sugar industry. He was later known as Peter Mussing, a lay preacher and worked on a banana plantation outside Murwillumbah. He died when Bandler was five years old.Tony Stephens, Profile, anu.edu.au; accessed 20 December 2015. Bandler cited stories of her father's harsh experience as a slave labourer as a strong motivation for her activism. In 1934, Bandler left school and moved to Sydney, where she worked as a dressmaker's apprentice. Career =Early career= During World War II, Bandler and her sister Kath served in the Australian Women's Land Army, working on fruit farms. Bandler and indigenous workers received less pay than white workers. After being discharged in 1945, she started to campaign for equal pay for indigenous workers. After the war, Bandler moved to the Sydney suburb of Kings Cross. =Community activism= In 1956, Bandler became a full-time activist, becoming involved in the Aboriginal‚ÄìAustralian Fellowship with Pearl Gibbs, Grace Bardsley, and Bert Groves. Bandler also became involved with the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI), which was formed in 1957. During this period, Bandler worked with her mentors Pearl Gibbs and Jessie Street. As general secretary of FCAATSI, Bandler led the campaign for a constitutional referendum to remove discriminatory provisions from the Constitution of Australia. The campaign, which included several massive petitions and hundreds of public meetings arranged by Bandler, resulted in the 1967 referendum being put to the people by the Holt government. The referendum succeeded in all six states, attracting nearly 91 percent support across the country.Australian Electoral Commission. Retrieved March 22, 2015. In 1975, Bandler visited Ambrym Island, where her father had been kidnapped 92 years before. Throughout the 1970s, Bandler was a prominent member of the Women's Electoral Lobby in New South Wales. =Writing= Faith Bandler memorial plaque in Sydney Writers Walk at Circular Quay In 1974, Bandler started working on four books, two histories of the 1967 referendum, an account of her brother's life in New South Wales, and a novel about her father's experience of blackbirding in Queensland. Beginning in 1974, she also started campaigning for the rights of South Sea Islander Australians. According to Bandler's biographer, feminist writer and historian Marilyn Lake, this campaign was more challenging than the FCAATSI campaign for the 1967 referendum, since Bandler was fighting on two fronts. Not only was she battling historians who insisted that the blackbirded South Sea Islanders were actually voluntary indentured servants, but she was also to some extent ostracised by indigenous Australians in the Australian civil rights movement, due to the increasing influence of separatist Black Power ideology. Bandler's published works include:   *  Personal life  In 1952, Faith married Hans Bandler, a Jewish refugee from Vienna, Austria, and lived in Frenchs Forest. During the war, Hans had been interned in the Nazi labour camps. The couple had a daughter, Lilon Gretl, born in 1954, and a fostered Aboriginal Australian son, Peter (Manual Armstrong). Hans died in 2009. Faith Bandler died at the age of 96 in February 2015.  Honours and awards  Bandler was: * appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1976, but she declined to accept it * appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) on 11 June 1984, in recognition of her service to Aboriginal welfare * awarded an honorary doctorate from Macquarie University in 1994 * awarded the 1997 Human Rights Medal by the then Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission * named as one of the 100 inaugural Australian Living Treasures by the National Trust of Australia * invested as a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) on 26 January 2009 (Australia Day) *included on the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001 A 1993 portrait of Bandler by artist Margaret Woodward is held by the State Library of New South Wales.

As a mental disorder, this is also called as autohemophagia, which is derived from three Greek words: auto, which means \\"self\\"; hemo, for \\"blood\\"; and, phag, meaning \\"to eat\\". Although closely related to vampirism, the two differ in that vampirism is a sadistic act while auto-vampirism is on the side of masochism. Along with drinking their own blood, most practitioners of auto-vampirism also engage in self-harm in order to obtain the blood.McCully, R. S. (1964). Vampirism: Historical perspective and underlying process in relation to a case of auto-vampirism. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 139, 440‚Äì451.  Background  Auto- vampirism is considered a pathology of vampiristic behavior or \\"clinical vampirism\\", which also includes any violent or sexual act done to or in the presence of the body of a dead being, not drinking the blood of a living human. Clinical psychologist Richard Noll introduced this term and was coined after the mental patient who assisted Dracula in Bram Stoker's novel. Auto- vampirism is typically the first stage of clinical vampirism, or more commonly known as Renfield's Syndrome. It is, however, not recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR 2000).  Development  The habit of drinking ones own blood usually begins during childhood, most commonly as a result of a traumatic event that results in a person linking pleasure with violence and more specifically blood. It develops by first scraping or cutting one's own skin to extract and ingest blood, later resulting in learning where and how to cut and open major veins and arteries for larger amounts of blood. Sometimes, they will also store their own blood for later consumption or just because they like to look at it. Eventually, auto-vampirism develops into clinical vampirism. According to clinical psychologist Noll, this process includes three stages: autovampirism, zoophagia (the progressive paraphilic stage that involves eating of animals or drinking of animals' blood), and clinical or true vampirism. As the child goes through puberty, they begin to link sexuality to the pleasure that is already derived from vampirism. There is also usually a sense that seeing or drinking their blood gives them power or increased health, as in general vampirism. At this point, it is considered fetishistic. There are cases where vampirism and auto-vampirism are one of many symptoms of schizophrenia. This was illustrated in the case of a 35- year old woman with schizophrenia who experienced severe depersonalization and auditory hallucinations that commanded her to drink her own blood. Auto-vampirism, for her, was part of a delusion about a purification process. Auto-vampirism can cause anemia, abdominal pain, nausea, and more. It's difficult to determine all the consequences of auto-vampirism due to the difficulty of finding people who drink their own blood. It is noted that the pathologies that are associated with vampirism is exceedingly rare.

Brown (January 25, 1927 ‚Äì November 20, 2014) and Vivian A. Brown (January 25, 1927 ‚Äì January 9, 2013) were American identical twin actresses who also appeared on television talk shows and television commercials. They became celebrity icons in San Francisco, known as the San Francisco Twins, renowned for their appearance in media with signature identically bright snappy outfits and hats atop meticulously coiffed hair. They were voted second as San Francisco's \\"Best Local Character\\" in 2000. They often ate dinner at one of the front tables at Uncle Vito's restaurant, just below the crest of Nob Hill, San Francisco. Biography Marian B. Brown and twin sister Vivian A. Brown were born in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Vivian was the elder by eight minutes. They grew up in Mattawan, Michigan, where they attended Mattawan High School and in 1945 graduated as co-valedictorians, giving the valedictory speech together. They went on to earn matching degrees in business education from Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, and then worked as teachers for three years. At the age of 43, the Browns left Michigan for San Francisco in 1970 with the intent of escaping the hot summers and long, cold winters. After they arrived in San Francisco, Vivian became a legal secretary and Marian worked at a bank. In Kalamazoo, the Brown twins were often seen in the Kalamazoo Mall, dressed identically. Both were petite at tall and weighing . They were always seen together. They dressed alike, walked in lockstep and ate at the same speed, even lifting their forks in unison. Neither married, but they said they had double-dated twins they met at a twins' convention. They never broke suit until Vivian was diagnosed with forgetfulness due to Alzheimer's disease. After a slip and fall in the summer of 2012, she ended up in Davies Hospital and her condition deteriorated. The costs of medical care caused financial problems for the twins, and San Franciscans and charities united to help keep them together. On January 9, 2013, Vivian died aged 85 at the Rhoda Goldman Plaza Assisted Living Centre in the Western Addition of San Francisco. Marian died on November 20, 2014, at a hospice in San Mateo, California, aged 87. Celebrity For more than 40 years, the Brown twins were an entertainment fixture of the San Francisco social scene. They appeared in public in identical outfits, becoming neighborhood celebrities. They gained wide exposure in a 1988 television advertisement for Reebok, which led to appearances in talk shows and modeling in advertisements. They appeared on television with Richard Simmons, Tom Snyder and Vicki Lawrence. They were featured in over 25 television advertisements over the years. Corporate advertisements in which they appeared included IBM, San Francisco Chronicle, Pay Less, Virgin Atlantic, Joe Boxer, Macy's, AT&T;, Dell Computers, and Apple Inc. The Brown Twins appear in an establishing shot in the film 9 to 5, ostensibly set in Los Angeles.

The Guardian reported that the letter was circulated by Treasury spokesperson and potential leadership challenger Vincent Cable, and that Sarah Teather, Andrew George, Sandra Gidley, and Michael Moore were also among the signatories (although The Guardian noted that Menzies Campbell, Simon Hughes and Mark Oaten were understood to have refused to sign the letter). BBC News the next day lists the other signatories as David Laws, Chris Huhne, Ed Davey, Norman Baker, John Thurso and Norman Lamb. In an interview with BBC News 24 Norman Baker confirmed his signature, as did Norman Lamb on the BBC's Newsnight. *Charles Kennedy made a statement to the media, admitting past problems with alcohol for which he had sought professional help, stating his determination to continue leading the party and calling for party members to have their say over his continued leadership. *In the immediate aftermath of the statement, several prominent Liberal Democrats rule themselves out of standing for the leadership against Kennedy, including Mark Oaten, Lembit √ñpik, and Norman Baker. √ñpik gives strong support to Kennedy, but Baker was more guarded about whether there should be a new leader. Menzies Campbell reiterated that he would not stand against Kennedy. 6 January  *Media speculation continued that many of the party's MPs were trying to persuade Kennedy to resign before the leadership contest. The letter of lost confidence and asking for resignation, drafted by Vincent Cable before Christmas 2005 and signed by eleven frontbenchers, was delivered to Mr. Kennedy. Nick Harvey has said he was prepared to table a motion of no confidence in the leader at the following week's weekly meeting of the parliamentary party. This was to enable those that would not stand against Kennedy to enter the contest, notably Mark Oaten and Menzies Campbell. Opinion amongst journalists seemed split on whether Kennedy would yield to this pressure to resign, stand unopposed or be challenged in the contest. Further public developments and statements by prominent Liberal Democrats made in reference to the question of Kennedy's leadership were: *The leader of the British Liberal Democrats in the European Parliament, Chris Davies MEP, said Kennedy was a \\"dead man walking\\". *Ex-frontbench MP and then peer Jenny Tonge, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, accuses Kennedy of \\"destroying the party\\" and said that she was \\"appalled, saddened, disgusted\\" by Kennedy's statement that he was an alcoholic. She said his calling of a leadership contest \\"underhand\\" by ignoring the calls of many of his MPs to step down and instead appealing directly to the party membership 'grassroots'. *Nick Harvey MP said Kennedy's position was untenable. He describes Kennedy's standing in the leadership contest as an \\"absurd charade\\" comparing the leadership contest to a \\"Soviet Union-style mock election\\". *International Development spokesperson, and former Parliamentary Private Secretary to Charles Kennedy, Andrew George declared that he would resign from the Liberal Democrat frontbench on Monday 9 January if Kennedy was still leader. Trade spokesperson Norman Lamb, who also previously served as Kennedy's PPS, declared his intention to similarly resign. Both were signatories to the letter expressing no confidence. *According to the BBC, Phil Willis MP said that MPs were wrong to dismiss the prospect of a leadership vote for all party members, in apparent support for Kennedy continuing to stand. *BBC News reported that over twenty Liberal Democrat frontbenchers were threatening resignation if Kennedy does not go, and some other MPs were declaring that they would refuse to fill any vacancies created. *Matthew Taylor, a close friend of Kennedy's who ran his successful leadership campaign in the 1999 leadership election, tells BBC News 24 that he feels it was essential for both Kennedy personally and the party that he step down from the leadership. *The Liberal Democrat peer and MEP, Baroness Nicholson, also urged Mr Kennedy to resign, saying that he needed to concentrate on his fight against his drink problem. *Howard Sykes, of the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors, came out in support of Kennedy saying grassroots activists would back him and that he was surprised that MPs were not prepared to do the same *At 18:25, Ed Davey and Sarah Teather were at the head of twenty-five Liberal Democrat MPs, including nineteen members of the frontbench, issuing a joint statement declaring that they could no longer support Kennedy's leadership and serve under him. They called on Kennedy to resign over the weekend. They include eight members of the \\"Shadow Cabinet\\" and eleven MPs first elected at the 2005 general election. The MPs were Norman Baker, Tom Brake, Alistair Carmichael, Nick Clegg, Ed Davey, Andrew George, Sandra Gidley, Jeremy Browne, Tim Farron, Lynne Featherstone, Julia Goldsworthy, Evan Harris, Nick Harvey, Martin Horwood, Chris Huhne, Norman Lamb, David Laws, John Pugh, Dan Rogerson, Adrian Sanders, Jo Swinson, Matthew Taylor, Sarah Teather, Stephen Williams, Jenny Willott *The BBC's Newsnight reports that thirty-three MPs, over half the parliamentary party, feel that Kennedy's continued leadership was untenable. 7 January  *John Hemming, the only Liberal Democrat MP not to sign Kennedy's nomination papers for leader in May 2005, said on his blog that he was considering whether to stand against Kennedy or not, but had not yet made a final decision. *At 15:00 GMT, Charles Kennedy resigned as leader of the Liberal Democrats. He explained that he had been \\"inundated\\" with support from ordinary members of the party, but felt he no longer had sufficient support among MPs. His resignation was with immediate effect, with Deputy Leader Menzies Campbell to act as interim leader. *Within minutes, Ed Davey and Lembit √ñpik declared that they would not be candidates in the election, Davey saying he would support Campbell and √ñpik saying he would support Oaten (if Oaten stands). Later that day, √ñpik said he supports Oaten's strategy of consulting with the other contenders. *Simon Hughes said that he would not make any announcement immediately as he has to fulfill his duties as party President first. *Mark Oaten said he had not yet decided and would reflect on the situation over the weekend. He said he intends to have discussions with Hughes and Campbell as the other \\"contenders\\". Immediately after Kennedy's resignation, he indicated he favoured a single, unity candidate and avoiding an election. *Sir Menzies Campbell, the interim leader, quickly announced his intention to stand in the upcoming contest and received immediate support from Nick Clegg, Malcolm Bruce and Chris Davies. Matthew Taylor had also said to BBC News 24 he would support Campbell if he stands. *As Chief Executive of the party, Lord Rennard said that he cannot indicate his support for any particular candidate. *Julia Goldsworthy told BBC News 24 that she supports Campbell for the leadership, but hoped that the election would be contested.

He expressed the view that there should be a contest of some kind as party members were feeling \\"pretty excluded from the process so far\\". This was a change to his earlier suggestion that it might be better for the party to unite around a single candidate. *Hughes said he would reveal his intentions within the week. *Phil Willis said he would stand to challenge Campbell if no other candidates emerged as he felt party members should be involved. *John Hemming was collecting nominations. *At the end of the day Oaten dropped strong hints in an on camera interview that he would stand, citing heavy public support received.

The outsiders are Chris Huhne ahead of Mark Oaten. 15 January  *Chris Huhne does not rule out working with a coalition whilst Menzies Campbell set out his plans in an interview with the BBC's Sunday AM programme, in which he does not rule out a return into front-line politics for Charles Kennedy. 18 January  *The newspaper The Independent published leaked emails which it said shows that Charles Kennedy has been canvassing support for Mark Oaten. *At Prime Minister's questions, Menzies Campbell asked the Prime Minister why recommendations of the Bichard Inquiry set up after the Soham murders have been delayed (the Prime Minister responded that he did not have the information in his briefing). Campbell's choice of question and performance was generally seen by newspaper sketchwriters as a significant improvement on the previous week. *A row erupted over the leaked report that Kennedy was backing Oaten with Kennedy's staff saying he merely wanted to support there being a contest. 19 January  *Mark Oaten withdrew from the leadership race citing minimal support among fellow MPs. *In the betting markets, Campbell and Hughes remained neck and neck. The odds on Huhne shortened. *Campbell held a formal launch for his campaign and was later one of the panelists on the BBC's Question Time. 21 January  * Former candidate Mark Oaten stood down from the front bench of the party over News of the World allegations that he made repeated visits to a male prostitute. 23 January  * Huhne overtook Hughes in the betting market with Campbell back to favourite. 25 January  * Nominations closed, with Campbell, Hughes and Huhne the only three candidates successfully nominated. 26 January  * In the wake of Mark Oaten's revelations and with rumours circulating, Simon Hughes admitted to The Sun newspaper that he had both heterosexual and homosexual relationships previously, but denied that his private life has any bearing on his ability to do his job. Earlier in the campaign, he had denied being gay; he apologises for such misleading statements. * Hughes was subsequently a panellist on Question Time. 2 February  * Huhne was the last of the original four contenders to appear as a regular panellist on Question Time. 6 February  * Ballot papers were sent to the 70,000 Liberal Democrat members as the leadership contest entered its final stages. 7 February  * There were reports of a leaked, unpublished YouGov poll of party members.

After eliminating Hughes, the figures are Huhne 52% to Campbell 48%. The data was collected 7 February-9 February. The poll was commissioned by a Huhne supporter, John Stevens, and the questions differed from the previous YouGov poll. * Huhne overtook Campbell as the favourite in betting markets. * The three candidates form the panel of a special edition of Question Time. 10 February  * Shortly after midnight, the result of the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, held on 9 February was announced. The Liberal Democrats win with a 16% swing from Labour.

Huhne denies this. 19 February  * The Observer newspaper surveys the chairs of Liberal Democrat local parties. Of those who respond, eight indicate support for Simon Hughes, eighteen for Chris Huhne and nineteen for Menzies Campbell. 23 February  * The candidates attend the final hustings meeting of the campaign in London. 25 February  * An unweighted poll for The Guardian taken of 422 members attending the London hustings puts Huhne on 36%, Campbell on 29% and Hughes on 21% and suggests that the second preferences of Hughes voters would put Huhne on 53% and Campbell on 47%. * A poll of 100 members for The Independent at the same event puts Campbell on 51%, Hughes on 31% and Huhne on 18%. * The Independent shifts its support from Campbell and announces that it is \\"leaning towards\\" Huhne. 26 February  * The Independent on Sunday backs Chris Huhne. 28 February  * The three candidates are all interviewed on the BBC programme The Daily Politics. 1 March  * The final votes are received and the ballot closes. 2 March  * Turnout was 72%.

History The pogroms of 1881-1884 and the May Laws of 1882 gave impetus to political activism among Russian Jews and mass emigration. More than two million Jews fled Russia between 1881 and 1920, the vast majority emigrating to the United States. The Tsarist government sporadically encouraged Jewish emigration. In 1882, members of Bilu and Hovevei Zion made what came to be known the First Aliyah to Palestine, then a part of the Ottoman Empire. Initially, these organizations were not official, and in order to attain a legally recognized framework, a Jewish organization had to be registered as a charity in various European countries and the United States that provided most of the funding. After arduous negotiations, the Russian government approved the establishment of the \\"Society for the Support of Jewish Farmers and Artisans in Syria and Palestine\\" early in 1890.Shafir, Gershon, Land, Labor and the Origins of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, 1882-1914, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1996, p.46 It was based in Odessa (now in Ukraine), headed by Leon Pinsker, and dedicated to practical aspects of establishing Jewish agricultural settlements in the Palestine.

He is also alluded to have been with Paul in Rome, where the apostle sent him to Ephesus, probably for the purpose of building up and encouraging the church there. In the New Testament, he is mentioned five times (; ; ; ; 2 Timothy 4:12). Appearance in the Bible (1) Acts 20:4 states that Tychicus was from the Roman province of Asia. The Western text indicates that he was an Ephesian. (2) In Ephesians 6:21, the author (traditionally identified as Paul) calls Tychicus a \\"dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord\\" (NIV), (3) while in Colossians, he says he is \\"a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.\\" In both Ephesians and Colossians, the author indicates that he is sending Tychicus to the Christians to whom he is writing, in order to encourage them. (4) The passages in the Epistle to Titus (Titus 3:12) and to Timothy show that Tychicus was again with Paul after the appeal to the emperor had resulted in the apostle regaining his freedom. The passage in Titus evidently refers to the interval between Paul's first and second Roman imprisonments, and while he was again engaged in missionary journeys. The apostle writes to Titus, who was in Crete in charge of the churches there, that he intended to send either Artemas or Tychicus to him, so as to take the oversight of the work of the gospel in that island so that Titus might be free to come to be with the apostle at Nicopolis. (5) The last passage where Tychicus is mentioned occurs in 2 Timothy, which was written in Rome not long before Paul's execution. To the very end Paul was busy as ever in the work of the gospel; and though it would have been a comfort to him to have his friends beside him, yet the interests of the kingdom of Christ are uppermost in his thoughts, and he sends these friends to help the progress of the work. To the last, Tychicus was serviceable as ever: \\"Tychicus I sent to Ephesus\\" (2 Timothy 4:12). As Timothy was in charge of the church in Ephesus (1 Timothy 1:3), the coming of Tychicus would set him free, so as to enable him to set off at once to rejoin Paul at Rome, as the apostle desired him (2 Timothy 4:9, 2 Timothy 4:21). Additional Detail The Catholic Encyclopedia notes that different traditions make him out to be the Bishop of Colophon, Chalcedon or Neapolis in Cyprus. Hippolytus of Rome lists Tychicus as one of the seventy disciples. His feast is kept on 29 April.

Longest tusks found Raja (elephant) (1913 - 16 July 1988) The Sri Lankan subspecies designation is weakly supported by analysis of allozyme loci, but not by analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. In July 2013, a dwarf Sri Lankan elephant was sighted in Udawalawe National Park. It was over tall but had shorter legs than usual and was the main aggressor in an encounter with a younger bull.  Distribution and habitat  Sri Lankan elephants are restricted mostly to the lowlands in the dry zone where they are still fairly widespread in north, south, east, north-western, north-central and south- eastern Sri Lanka. A small remnant population exists in the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary. They are absent from the wet zone of the country. Apart from Wilpattu and Ruhuna National Parks, all other protected areas are less than in extent. Many areas are less than , and hence not large enough to encompass the entire home ranges of elephants that use them. In the Mahaweli Development Area, protected areas such as Wasgomuwa National Park, Flood Plains National Park, Somawathiya National Park, and Trikonamadu Nature Reserve have been linked resulting in an overall area of of contiguous habitat for elephants. Nevertheless, about 65% of the elephant's range extends outside protected areas. = Former range = In the historical past, elephants were widely distributed from sea level to the highest mountain ranges. They occurred in the dry zone, in the lowland wet zone as well as in the cold damp montane forests. During the colonial period from 1505 to 1948, the wet zone was converted to commercially used fields and became heavily settled. Until 1830, elephants were so plentiful that their destruction was encouraged by the government, and rewards were paid for any that was killed. In the first half of the 19th century, forests in the montane zone were cleared large-scale for the planting of coffee, and afterward tea. The elephant population in the mountains was extirpated. During the British rule, many bull elephants were killed by trophy hunters. One of the British army majors is credited with having shot over 1,500 elephants, and two others are reputed to have shot half that number each. Many other sportsmen have shot about 250-300 animals during this time. Between 1829 and 1855 alone, more than 6,000 elephants were captured and shot under order of colonial British Empire. By the turn of the 20th century, elephants were still distributed over much of the island. The area currently known as Ruhuna National Park was the Resident Sportsmen's Shooting Reserve, an area reserved for the sporting pleasure of British residents in the country. In the early 20th century, mega reservoirs were constructed in the dry zone for irrigated agriculture. Ancient irrigation systems were rehabilitated and people resettled. This development gathered momentum after the independence in 1948. As a result, elephant habitat in the dry zone was severely fragmented. = Population trend = The size of wild elephant populations in Sri Lanka was estimated at *12,000 to 14,000 in the early 19th century; *10,000 in the early 20th century; *7,000 to 8,000 in around 1920; *between 1,745 and 2,455 individuals in 1969; *between 2,500 and 3,435 in 1987; *1,967 in June 1993 that were fragmented in five regions; *between 3,150 and 4,400 in 2000; *3,150 in 2006; *2,900-3,000 in 2007; *5,879 in 2011, on the basis of counting elephants at water holes in the dry season.  Ecology and behaviour  Elephants feeding on shrub in Maduru Oya National Park Elephant feeding on grass in Yala National Park (video) Elephants are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to of plant matter per day. As generalists, they feed on a wide variety of food plants. In Sri Lanka's northwestern region, feeding behaviour of elephants was observed during the period of January 1998 to December 1999. The elephants fed on a total of 116 plant species belonging to 35 families including 27 species of cultivated plants. More than half of the plants were non tree species, i.e. shrub, herb, grass, or climbers. More than 25% of the plant species belonged to the family Leguminosae, and 19% of the plant species belonged to the family of true grasses. The presence of cultivated plants in dung does not result solely due to raiding of crops as it was observed that elephants feed on leftover crop plants in fallow chenas. Juvenile elephants tend to feed predominantly on grass species. Food resources are abundant in regenerating forests, but at low density in mature forests. Traditional slash-and-burn agriculture creates optimum habitat for elephants through promoting successional vegetation. Females and calves generally form small, loosely associated social groups without the hierarchical tier structure exhibited by African savannah elephants. However, at some locations such as Minneriya National Park, hundreds of individuals aggregate during the dry season, suggesting that grouping behaviour is flexible and depends on season and place. Like all Asian elephants, the Sri Lankan subspecies communicates using visual, acoustic, and chemical signals. At least fourteen different vocal and acoustic signals have been described, which include some low-frequency calls that contain infrasonic frequencies. Threats During the armed conflict in Sri Lanka, elephants were maimed or killed by land mines. Between 1990 and 1994, a total of 261 wild elephants died either as a result of gunshot injuries, or were killed by poachers and land mines. Several elephants stepped on land mines and were crippled. Today, given the rarity of tuskers in Sri Lanka, poaching for ivory is not a major threat. Nevertheless, some trade in ivory still goes on. Kandy has been identified as the centre for such illegal trade. The greatest threat to elephants comes from an expanding human population and its demand for land. Loss of significant extents of elephant range to development continues currently, with a number of irrigation and development projects leading to the conversion of more elephant ranges to irrigated agriculture and settlements. Between 1999 and the end of 2006 every year nearly 100 wild elephants were killed. Elephants are killed to protect crops and houses. Other threats are poaching, deforestation, drought and starvation. During drought seasons many elephants damage agricultural land for food. Nearly 80 elephants were killed in north western Sri Lanka, 50 in south and east, and another 30 in other parts of the country, totaling 160 elephant deaths in 2006 alone. Conservation Elephants at the Elephant Orphanage near Kandy Elephas maximus is listed on CITES Appendix I. The elephant conservation strategy of the Department of Wildlife Conservation aims at conserving as many viable populations as possible in as wide a range of suitable habitats as is feasible. This means protecting elephants both within the system of protected areas and as many animals outside these areas that the land can support and landholders will accept, and not restricting elephants to the protected area network alone. *In the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage in Kegalle injured elephants are treated, and orphaned baby elephants cared for. Nearly 70 elephants live here. Captive breeding is also going on. *The Udawalawe Elephant Transit Centre in Udawalawe National Park is a rehabilitation centre, where orphaned elephant calves are being kept until they can be released into the wild. In culture A sketch of Hansken by Rembrandt (1637) Sri Lankan elephants at the Esala Perahera Sri Lankan elephant at Kataragama Elephants were a common element in Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamils heraldry for over two thousand years and remained so through British colonial rule. The coat of arms and the flag of Ceylon Government from 1875 to 1948 included an elephant and even today many institutions use the Sri Lankan elephant in their coat of arms and insignia. An important cultural symbiosis has continued to exist between the elephant and humans for over two thousand years ‚Äì no religious procession was complete without its retinue of elephants, and many large Buddhist temples and Hindu Temples in Sri Lanka had their own elephants.

He was expelled from the New Zealand First caucus on 4 December 2012 and served the remainder of his term as an Independent. Horan is of MƒÅori descent with affiliations to NgƒÅti Maniapoto. Media and sporting career Horan was a weather presenter for Television New Zealand's ONE News, running on a regular cycle with Karen Olsen and Natalie Crook. He started in March 2005, and took redundancy in 2007 when former TV1 weather presenter Jim Hickey returned after nearly 4 years absence on the air. His final weather presentation was on 7 September 2007. Horan has been a professional lifeguard and coach, and was a New Zealand Surf Lifesaving Iron Man champion. He also represented New Zealand and Australia in waterpolo, and was a New Zealand outrigger canoe champion. Political career In the 2008 general election, Horan contested the East Coast electorate for the New Zealand First party. He came third in electorate votes but due to New Zealand First's poor showing in party votes, was not elected from the party list. At the 2011 general election Horan stood in Tauranga, narrowly coming third (by 96 votes) behind the Labour candidate. However, he was elected as a list MP for New Zealand First, after being ranked sixth on their party list. In October 2012 he helped save the life of Indonesian MP Atte Sugandi by giving him CPR when the MP collapsed at a UN conference in Japan. =Expulsion from NZ First= In November 2012 Horan was accused of taking money from his dying mother's bank account and spending it on gambling. At first Winston Peters refused to say whether he still had confidence in Horan, but on 4 December expelled him from the party. Horan wasn't informed until Peters made the announcement in Parliament. Horan flatly denied the allegations, and vowed to continue as an independent MP, despite only making it into Parliament as a list MP, without an electorate. On 10 December 2012, Horan admitted making 144 calls to gambling agency TAB on his taxpayer-funded phone, but denied he had a gambling problem. Later that day he notified the Speaker he was no longer a member of NZ First, making his independence from the party official. He also called for an investigation into who leaked his phone records to the media. =New Zealand Independent Coalition= In 2013, Horan announced his intention to form a new political party. In January 2014 he launched the NZ Independent Coalition, which, following the general election on 20 September 2014 did not win any seats or cross the 5% party vote threshold to stay in Parliament. Horan stood in the Bay of Plenty electorate, coming fifth. In 2016, the NZ Independent Coalition was deregistered. Also in 2016, Horan was cleared of the allegations around use of his mother's bank account, with police saying there was no evidence to support charges. Horan stated that the allegations had made it difficult to secure sought-after jobs.  Personal life  Horan is married and has two children.

Biography Of his early history nothing is known; there are no references to his teachers and comparatively few of his sayings have been preserved.Mishnah Eduyot 5:6, 5:7, Bekhorot 3:4, Niddah 2:6, Nega'im 1:4, 5:3 The Mishnah portrays him as a man who fearlessly and persistently maintained opinions on some halakhot, even in cases where different traditions were held by the majority of his colleagues, because those opinions were founded on traditions he had received from his predecessors. On one occasion the majority demanded that he renounce his divergent opinions, but he refused. It was even intimated to him that in the event of his compliance he would be elevated to the position of Av Beit Din (president of the court), but Akabia rejected the proposition, remarking, \\"I would rather be called a fool all my lifetime than be a sinner for one moment.\\" His traditional burial location is in Kfar Manda in the Lower Galilee. In the course of the discussion of the halakhah concerning the administration of \\"the water of jealousy\\" (Num. ), Akabia declared that, if the subject of the test was not a free-born Jewess, the test-water was not to be administered; while the majority declared a proselyte or an emancipated slave to be the equal of a free-born daughter in Israel. In support of their view, the majority cited a case in point, where the former associate presidents of the Sanhedrin, Shemaiah and Abtalion, had the test made on a freed woman; whereupon Akabia disdainfully exclaimed, Dugma hish·∏≥uha. This might mean \\"To one like themselves they gave to drink,\\" and may be construed as an allusion to an old rumor to the effect that these associate presidents were themselves lineal descendants of proselytes;Bab. Talmud Gittin 57b or it might mean \\"They gave her a sham to drink.\\" The memory of those chiefs being held in esteem, Akabia's insinuation gave offense; wherefore the sentence of nidduy (isolation, excommunication) was passed on him. This he bore to the end of his days rather than violate his convictions. However, before his death, he admonished his son to submit to the views of the majority, even in the cases where he himself had shown such persistent opposition. His son expressing surprise at so apparent an inconsistency, the dying sage replied: \\"I have received my tradition from a majority of a school in my days, and so have my opponents. I was bound to conform to the tradition I had received; and so are they bound by their tradition. But thou hast heard the traditions both from myself and from my opponents; from a minority and from a majority, and it is proper for thee to reject the opinions of the individual and adopt the views of the majority\\".Mishnah Eduyot 5:7 Another characteristic trait of Akabia was the great stress he laid on personal merit. When, on his deathbed, he was requested by his son to recommend him to the sages, he declined to do so. His son inquired whether his father had discovered in him any trait which rendered him unworthy of such recommendation; and Akabia's reply was, \\"No! but your own deeds will make you welcome, or your own deeds will make you obnoxious\\". As to Akabia's epoch scholars are divided. While some place him in the patriarchate of Hillel I (30 BC to 10 of the present era), and even somewhat earlier, others bring him down to the first tannaitic generation (10-80); still others believe that he flourished during the patriarchate of Gamaliel II (80-117). The circumstances and scholastic achievements of the second tannaitic generation render Akabia's excommunication more reasonable. The decree of excommunication failed to obscure Akabia's merited fame; for his name reached subsequent generations surrounded by such a halo of glory as to throw doubt on the decree itself. \\"God forbid,\\" exclaims Judah b. Ilai (139-165), \\"that we should think that Akabia was excommunicated, for the Temple gates were never closed behind a man in Israel so great in wisdom and in the fear of sin as was Akabia ben Mahalalel\\".Mishnah Eduyot 5:6 This expression, which is based on the law forbidding an excommunicated person to enter the Temple court, was in later days taken literally, and gave rise to forced halakhic discussions and comments,Berakhot 19a; Pesahim 64b as well as to hypothetical speculations about the age of Akabia. ElsewhereSifre Bamidbar 105 it is said, \\"Whoever asserts that Akabia was ever excommunicated will have to answer before the tribunal of heaven.\\" This observation is wrongly attributed to Judah b. Betera I,compare Bab. Talmud Shabbat 97a and conclusions as to Akabia's early age are erroneously deduced from this attribution.

Early life  The son of a physician, Dr. Brown was born in 1922. He did well in school, graduating from high school by the age of 16. When drafted by the US Army during World War II, he scored exceptionally highly on the Army General Classification Test, which resulted in the Army sending him to medical school. Brown graduated from University of Utah School of Medicine in 1947, and worked as a general practitioner for almost two decades. However, after almost losing a patient during a thyroidectomy, he decided to undertake formal surgical training. Despite excelling in the written aspects of certification for the American Board of Plastic Surgery, he failed the oral assessment (blaming his 'domineering' father).  Later medical career  By the early 1970s, Brown was carrying out sex reassignment surgery on transsexual patients at a small clinic he set up in San Francisco. He would later claim to have performed 600 such surgeries during the course of his career. Most of his patients were trans women who were too poor to afford the fees of reputable surgeons. Others were former patients of the university based units at Stanford University and Johns Hopkins Hospital that offered transsexual treatment during the 1960s. Only a small minority of patients met their exceptionally strict criteria for sex reassignment surgery. The program at Johns Hopkins, for example, only approved surgery for 24 out of the first 2000 people who approached them with the request for it. Brown, by contrast, freely admitted that he was willing to operate on anybody who would pay him. At this time, many transsexual women were grateful to him for providing reassignment surgery when they otherwise had no recourse.World's Worst Sex Change Surgeon (2007), 10 min His lack of a formal surgical qualification made it necessary for him to carry out sex reassignment surgery in his office on an out-patient basis, rather than in a fully equipped surgical theatre.World's Worst Sex Change Surgeon (2007), 12 min 31sec He also carried out surgeries in his garage and in motel rooms. In 1977, following the death of one patient and a lawsuit from another, Brown's medical license was revoked by the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance for \\"gross negligence, incompetence and practising unprofessional medicine in a manner which involved moral turpitude\\". He was also charged with allowing patients to work as unqualified, medical assistants (allegedly as barter for their own subsequent surgery), failing to hospitalize a patient who had developed a life-threatening infection and making false claims on medical insurance forms. Brown continued to practice medicine outside of California, but was successively barred from practicing in Hawaii, Alaska and the island of Saint Lucia. During the 1980s Brown began soliciting and advertising surgical services in the USAWorld's Worst Sex Change Surgeon (2007), 16 min whilst performing the surgical procedures in Mexico. In 1986, an article in the magazine Forum reported on his procedure for surgically increasing penis length. The Forum article and an Inside Edition television documentary made several years later (\\"The Worst Doctor in America\\") both portrayed Brown as an incompetent and inept surgeon. While some of his patients were satisfied with their surgical results and praised Brown, he gained an overall poor reputation and the nickname \\"Butcher Brown\\" amongst the transsexual community. Despite this, desperate individuals continued to seek him out. In 1990, Brown spent 19 months in prison for practicing medicine without a license. The charge came after Brown operated on a thirty-year-old transgender woman from Orange County, California . After leaving prison, Brown worked as a taxi driver for a year before re- establishing himself in medical practice.  Murder conviction  On May 9, 1998, Brown performed a leg amputation on Philip Bondy, a 79-year-old, retired satellite engineer from New York, in Tijuana, Mexico. Bondy was one of the rare individuals suffering from Body integrity identity disorder ‚Äì a desire to have a healthy limb amputated. Very few reputable surgeons are willing to treat this disorder by carrying out such an amputation due to its direct violation of the Hippocratic oath. The morning after the surgery, Bondy was found dead in a National City, California hotel room, by Dr. Gregg M. Furth, a New York child psychologist and fellow BIID sufferer who had traveled with Bondy to Mexico after being denied apotmennophilic surgery in the UK. Though they both wanted their legs amputated, Furth had backed out of having surgery with Brown at the last moment, after seeing an assistant carrying a large knife. An autopsy showed Bondy had died of gas gangrene. A police search of Brown's home ‚Äì a ground floor unit in a San Ysidro apartment building ‚Äì revealed blood-soaked towels, sheets and mattresses, as well as anaesthetizing drugs, surgical instruments and hundreds of tubes of super glue.World's Worst Sex Change Surgeon (2007), 4 min Police also discovered video tapes of Brown's operations.World's Worst Sex Change Surgeon (2007), 6 min 05 sec Brown was prosecuted in California for second-degree murder ‚Äì an unusually severe charge in medical cases. A surgeon, who was a witness for the prosecution, testified that Brown had not left a large enough skin flap to properly cover the bone and stump. The flap was stretched too tightly to allow adequate blood flow and the tissue in the flap died, allowing an infection of Clostridium perfringens and producing gangrene. To make the murder charges stick, the prosecution had to establish that Brown had a history of incompetence and recklessness. A number of transsexual women gave testimony of their experiences of Brown's treatment and subsequent medical history. However, he continued to have some supporters amongst former patients, even after his arrest. Brown was convicted by unanimous decision and sentenced to fifteen years to life in prison. Illness and death By spring 2010, John Ronald Brown's health had deteriorated greatly and he came down with numerous health problems, including a severe bout of pneumonia. Treatment for his pneumonia eventually proved useless, his body eventually rejecting antibiotic medication. While arrangements to move Brown to a rest home in San Diego were being made, he died on the evening of 16 May 2010 at 10:40 pm local time, two months shy of his 88th birthday.

It is situated on the river Eider approx. 12 km south of Husum.  History  The town was founded in 1621 by Dutch settlers. Duke Friedrich III of Holstein-Gottorp persuaded them to invest capital and knowledge in this region in turn for freedom of their Mennonite and Remonstrant religion (see: Arminianism) and opportunities to reclaim fen and marsh land in the vicinity of the town. One of them was Johannes Narssius. Dutch became an official language. The town was named after Duke Frederick. By 1630, many Arminians had already returned to the Netherlands. In 1633-1637 Frederick III sent an embassy to Tsar Michael I of Russia and to Shah Safi of Persia with a view to setting up Friedrichstadt as a European trade terminus. The delegation was led by the jurisconsult Philip Crusius, jurisconsult, and the merchant Otto Bruggemann or Brugman, of which their secretary - the scholar Adam Olearius - later wrote a book. However, the aim of creating a regular trading route that would not pass around Africa was not achieved, and the delegation proved fruitless.

History  There is no evidence that territory of a modern Jaunjelgava had been inhabited before 15th century. However a selonian Sƒìrene hillfort existed 5 km from the modern town. A country estate Vecsƒìrene manor was established around 1450 not far from modern town. During the 15th century territory of the town was used as a place where merchants from Riga transported their goods from boats to carriages because, due to Daugava rapids, it was hard to navigate further downstream. As a result, a small port emerged. In 1567 Duke of Courland and Semigallia Gotthard Kettler called the small port as Neustadt. In 1590 next Duke Friedrich Kettler founded the town market and granted village rights to Neustadt. At that time about 60 families lived at the town. The village was devastated in 1621, during the Polish-Swedish war, and was re-established as a town in 1646 when widow of the Friedrich Kettler Elisabeth Magdalena of Pomerania in honour of her husband gave new name to the town ‚Äì Friedrichstadt. In 1647 king of Poland W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV granted town rights and approved Coat of arms of Friedrichstadt. In 1652 lutheran church was built in the town by order of duke Jacob Kettler. Town saw rapid development in the second half of the 17th century when after Second Northern War town was important transport hub. In 1710 the plague epidemic started. Also there was several large fires in the town during 18th century. Also great damage was inflicted by four big floods. Biggest of them was in 1778 when around 100 houses were destroyed. In 1795 Friedrichstadt as a part of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was incorporated into Russian Empire and became part of Courland Governorate. During 1812 Napaleon's invasion in Russia several small battles was fought around the town. In 1831 and 1848 cholera, raged. During first half of the 19th century town prospered thanks to merchant activities. Local inhabitants owned warehouses, taverns for rafters and was involved in transportation of goods by carriages to Jacobstadt. In 1820 there were 24 taverns in the town. After opening of the Riga‚ÄìDaugavpils Railway line in 1861, the Daugava River waterway, and thus the city, lost its importance. However in the late 19th century there were still around 10 banks and various insurance offices, 60 merchant enterprises, 23 industrial enterprises and a hospital in the town. In 1909 telephone connection was established between Friedrichstadt, Riga and Jelgava. In 1914 the city had 7,300 inhabitants. During Latvian War of Independence town was heavily damaged when in 1919 from 17 October to 15 November heavy fighting took place near the city. At the battle end town was liberated by Latvian army from West Russian Volunteer Army. In 1925 the city had only 1577 inhabitants.Encyclopedia \\"Latvian cities\\". Rƒ´ga 1999.

The station is the western terminus of the Tees Valley Line (also referred to as the Bishop Line West of ) north of Darlington. When it is operating, a connection can be made with the Weardale Heritage Railway at the nearby Bishop Auckland West railway station for trains towards . History Bishop Auckland gained its first rail link in 1842, when the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR;) backed Bishop Auckland and Weardale Railway (BA&WR;) gained the powers via an Act of Parliament to build a railway line from the S&DR;'s station at via Bishop Auckland and Witton-le- Wear into Crook, County Durham. The company initially built a temporary terminus at South Church, which opened on 19 April 1842. A road coach service then extended the service into Bishop Auckland, and a secondary road coach service also ran to Rainton Meadows. After completion of the Shildon tunnel, the BA&WR; erected a permanent station on the current site, which opened to freight on 8 November 1843, and passengers on 30 January 1843. All operations were sub-leased as agreed to the S&DR.; In 1844, after the West Durham Railway extended from a junction with the Clarence Railway at to Crook, the S&DR; extended the BA&WR; from Bishop Auckland along the river valley to Witton-le- Wear, and then into . In 1845, the S&DR; came to an agreement with the Derwent Iron Company to sub-lease the southern section of the former Stanhope and Tyne Railway. It extended the line from Crook to and then to Blackhill, and it was opened as the Weardale Extension Railway (WXR). In July 1845 Parliament passed the Wear Valley Act, which allowed the extension of the BA&WR; from a junction at Witton-le-Wear to , and a small branch line across the river to Bishopley. With all works again undertaken by the S&DR;, this line opened on 3 August 1847. After these works had been completed, the BA&WR; amalgamated with the WXR. All service were operated by the S&DR;, which officially took over the new company in January 1857. On 1 April 1857, the North Eastern Railway (NER) started a service from to Bishop Auckland at a new terminus in Tenter Street. However, the S&DR; and NER quickly came to the agreement of development of a joint station in the town, and so rebuilt the existing former BA&WR; station, with NER trains using it from December 1857. In 1862, an Act of Parliament was passed allowing the S&DR; backed Frosterley and Stanhope Railway to extend the line to , thus allowing trains to transport limestone from the Newlandside Estate on the south side of the town. This brought about the extension of the South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway from into Bishop Auckland in 1862, and with the final addition of traffic from an extension of the Clarence Railway at , eventually resulted in the NER rebuilding the station again in December 1867. The final extension of the Weardale Railway to opened on 21 October 1895, with the NER having resited the station at to provide a more suitable gradient for the heavy limestone trains. Between Eastgate and Westgate at Cambo Keels, sidings were established to serve the Weardale Iron Company's Heights limestone quarry, which is still in operation today. This final extension of the Weardale Railway bought about the final and largest layout of Bishop Auckland railway station, which was now rebuilt in triangular form with four platforms in 1905. Only three of these were normally used for passenger trains, with platform 1 handing trains towards Crook & Wearhead and platforms 2 & 3 dealing with services on the Barnard Castle, Ferryhill & Durham lines. Platform 4 (on the chord linking the Durham & Crook lines) was mostly used for parcels & newspaper traffic and for racing pigeon specials. As elsewhere the UK, rail traffic in the area declined after World War II, with the Wearhead branch the first to lose its passenger trains in 1953. The principal closures came in the 1960s mainly as a result of the Beeching Axe, with services to: Barnard Castle via West Auckland ending in June 1962; Durham in May 1964; and Crook in March 1965. This left only the former original S&DR; line to line in operation, along with the freight-only branch traffic to Eastgate. The station remained more or less intact (although increasingly forlorn and run-down) for more than 20 years thereafter, though by the early 1980s only the former platform 3 was in use (along with the former Bishop Auckland East signal box). It was eventually replaced by the current structure on 6 June 1986. This stands on the site of the former Crook branch platform, on a siding off the now single 'main' line which continues on towards Stanhope & Eastgate. The signal box was abolished at the same time, with neighbouring Shildon box assuming control of the much-simplified layout. The remaining station buildings were then demolished and the site sold off for retail redevelopment. The former goods yard is now a supermarket with carpark, and the Durham platform is now the site of a cycling and motoring store and a bank. The station is currently operated by Northern, which provides National Rail passenger services. In 2012, Bishop Trains adopted the station from Northern Rail (the operator at the time), providing a National Rail Ticket Office and staff for the station. Bishop Trains have further developed the Ticket Office and now provide a booking service for coach trips and holidays, and more recently, rail charters. It is staffed six days per week throughout the year (Monday to Saturday 06:50-16:15). At all other times, tickets must be purchased in advance or on the train.

She hailed from a musically talented family: her brothers, Joseph Fuchs, a violinist, and Harry Fuchs, a cellist, performed with her on numerous commercial recordings. Her children and grandchildren continue in her footsteps. Background Lillian Fuchs began her musical studies as a pianist, later studying violin with her father and afterwards with Franz Kneisel (former concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and first violinist of the Kneisel Quartet) at the Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School. She enjoyed a distinguished teaching career at the Manhattan School of Music, the Juilliard School, the Aspen Music Festival and School, and the Blue Hill Music School, which she founded with her brother Joseph. Martha Strongin Katz, James Wendell Griffith, Geraldine Walther, Lawrence Dutton and Yizhak Schotten were her students. Her books of etudes for the viola (Twelve Caprices for Viola, Fifteen Characteristic Studies for Viola, and Sixteen Fantasy Etudes) are in standard use today in universities and music schools around the world, and were much appreciated by the great Scottish violist, William Primrose. She also composed a Sonata Pastorale for solo viola. She performed many standard and non-standard pieces in the viola repertoire, including significant 20th century works. Fuchs was known for her warm, beautiful tone, expert musicianship and technical mastery. She owned a fine instrument made by Matteo Goffriller (1659‚Äì1742) and was the lifelong custodian of another lovely viola, darker in tone, by Gasparo da Sal√≤ (1540‚Äì1609). She played with a bow made by the English bow maker, John Dodd (1752‚Äì1839) which sold in May 2014 for $22,800 at Tarisio Auctions. Dodd bows are often shorter than other viola bows, a quality Fuchs prized for the greater control it permitted and also for its sheer practicality, since she was of diminutive stature. She used a gut 'A' string, considering it a sacrilege to use a metal 'A' string on an old Italian instrument. Lillian Fuchs made her New York d√©but on the violin in 1926, but soon switched to viola at the urging of Franz Kneisel (she was once heard to say, much to the great surprise of the auditors present, that it had never been her idea to play the viola, as she considered the instrument to be too big for her!). She thereafter was a founding member of the Perol√© Quartet, playing viola with this ensemble from 1925 to 1945.Don Michael Randel, The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music (Harvard University Press, 1996), p. 286. She collaborated with the Budapest and Amadeus String Quartets (see below) and often in performance with her brothers Joseph, a violinist and Harry, a cellist. She played in a number of chamber groups, notably the Musicians Guild, and appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic and the Casals Festival Orchestra. In 1947, Bohuslav Martin≈Ø composed and dedicated his 'Madrigals' for violin and viola to Lillian and Joseph Fuchs after hearing them perform the Mozart Duos at Town Hall in New York City. A renowned teacher of viola, Fuchs was also an important teacher of chamber music, counting among her pupils Isaac Stern, Pinchas Zukerman and Dorothy DeLay. Lillian Fuchs's influence can be seen in her two daughters, Barbara Stein Mallow, cellist, Carol Stein Amado (deceased), violinist, her granddaughter, Jeanne Mallow, violist, and grandson, David Amado, conductor. Recordings Most of her vinyl recordings are today collector's items (to be found often on eBay) and are otherwise unavailable commercially. DoReMi records has recently re-released a CD version of her 1950's recordings of the Bach Cello Suites. Her interpretation of the sixth suite (composed actually for a five stringed instrument, the viola pomposa) made such an impression on Pablo Casals, that after a private performance she had made for him, he (as told by Miss Fuchs) said to her that it sounded better on the viola than on the cello. She was the first to perform and record the Bach Suites for the viola.

It is a five-minute walk from Canterbury East Station and main bus station around City Wall. Canterbury Castle was one of the three original Royal castles of Kent (the other two being Rochester Castle and Dover Castle). They were all built soon after the Battle of Hastings, on the main Roman road from Dover to London. This was the route taken by William the Conqueror in October 1066, and they were built originally as motte-and-bailey castles to guard this important route.Canterbury Trust Phases =Norman era= A wooden motte and bailey castle was erected in 1066 - its motte may be the mound which is still visible in the Dane John gardens near the stone castle (which may in turn be a Roman burial mound), with Dane John deriving from donjon. =Stone castle= The great stone keep was largely constructed in the reign of Henry I as one of three Royal castles in Kent. This massive structure, which has dimensions of about 98 by 85 feet externally at the base, was originally probably at least 80 feet high. It is mainly made of flint and sandstone rubble. By the 13th century the castle had become the county gaol. It was given up to the invading French in the First Barons' War. In 1380 a new gate was built.Canterbury Castle 1 canterbury.co.uk By the 19th century it had been obtained by a gas company and used as a storage centre for gas for many years, during which time the top floor was destroyed. =Tourist attraction= The Castle has been owned by the local authority since 1928.\\"Canterbury Castle\\" Canterbury Historical and Archaeological Society (CHAS), Retrieved 10 January 2020 It has been closed because of falling masonry since 2018, although there are tentative plans for its restoration and reopening in 2021.Wright, Joe. \\"Canterbury Castle could reopen in 2021\\", Kent Online, 29 May 2019.

The station is on the Bishop Auckland branch of the Tees Valley Line north of the main station and is operated by Northern Trains which provides all passenger train services on this line. History The station is closely linked with the history of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, being the site of the original Darlington station. The station building, now the Darlington Railway Centre and Museum, was first opened in 1842 and is listed Grade II*. It replaced a depot on the opposite side of North Road, built in 1833. The building was constructed to a design by the S&D; resident engineer of the time John Harris and was expanded and rebuilt on several subsequent occasions (e.g. in 1856 following the opening of the line to Barnard Castle and again in 1864 and 1876 by the NER and their main architect William Peachey).Darlington North Road Station railwayarchitecture.org.uk; Retrieved 17 February 2017 The opening of the main line station at Bank Top in 1887 saw the importance of North Road decline and it was twice threatened with closure in the 20th century (initially in 1930 and again under the Beeching cuts of 1963), but was reprieved each time. The closure of the Stainmore route to in 1962 and the Middleton-in-Teesdale branch line two years later did see the route through here reduced to single track (with only one platform remaining) and by the early 1970s, the train shed had suffered badly from vandalism and was in a poor state of repair. This prompted the local council, the town's tourist board, Darlington Museums service and a consortium of local people to join together to restore the station and Hopetown works complex nearby as a museum (currently known as Head of Steam), whilst maintaining a single active platform for the Bishop Auckland branch line.

The giant elliptical galaxy ESO 325-G004 looms large at the cluster's center. This BCG is as massive as 100 billion of our suns. A brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is defined as the brightest galaxy in a cluster of galaxies. BCGs include the most massive galaxies in the universe. They are generally elliptical galaxies which lie close to the geometric and kinematical center of their host galaxy cluster, hence at the bottom of the cluster potential well. They are also generally coincident with the peak of the cluster X-ray emission.Lin and Mohr (2004), K-band Properties of Galaxy Clusters and Groups: Brightest Cluster Galaxies and Intracluster Light Formation scenarios for BCGs include: * Cooling flow‚ÄîStar formation from the central cooling flow in high density cooling centers of X-ray cluster halos.

Merritt (1984), Relaxation and tidal stripping in rich clusters of galaxies. II - Evolution of the luminosity distribution It is possible to differentiate the cannibalism model from the merging model by considering the formation period of the BCGs. In the cannibalism model, there are numerous small galaxies present in the evolved cluster, whereas in the merging model, a hierarchical cosmological model is expected due to the collapse of clusters. It has been shown that the orbit decay of cluster galaxies is not effective enough to account for the growth of BCGs.D. Merritt (1985), Relaxation and tidal stripping in rich clusters of galaxies. III Growth of a massive central galaxy The merging model is now generally accepted as the most likely one,J. Dubinski (1998), The Origin of the Brightest Cluster Galaxies but recent observations are at odds with some of its predictions. For example, it has been found that the stellar mass of BCGs was assembled much earlier than the merging model predicts.Collins et al. (2009) Early assembly of the most massive galaxies Hubble.

The light profiles of BCGs are often described by a Sersic surface brightness law, a double Sersic profile or a de Vaucouleurs law. The different parametrizations of the light profile of BCG's, as well as the faintness of the diffuse envelope lead to discrepancies in the reported values of the sizes of these objects.

She becomes so concentrated on the issues, she makes a major mistake and kills the local version of Bigfoot. The death of this creature heralds the rise of a demon named Ky-Laag and potentially the end of the world.

Its primary purpose was to regulate the flow in the River Severn to mitigate flooding and provide support for drinking water abstractions for the West Midlands River Severn Regulation fact sheet - The environment AgencySouth Staff Water - Our Supply Area It was completed in 1967 and is situated near the B4518 road north of Llanidloes, Powys It also regulates the flow of water in the River Severn by releasing water into the river channel during low flow periods and re-filling during the wetter winter months. This enables major water abstractions to be made from the River Severn to supply the West Midlands with of drinking water. Capacity is held in the reservoir throughout the winter so that it retains capacity to mitigate downstream flooding by absorbing excess flow from the head-waters of the Afon Clywedog, a tributary of the River Severn . The reservoir was formed by damming both the Afon Clywedog and a much smaller embankment dam located at Bwlch-y-gle to prevent overflow into the next valley. Its concrete buttress dam is the tallest concrete dam in the UK, with a height of 72 metres and a length of 230 metres. When at capacity the reservoir contains approximately 50,000 megalitres of water. Below Clywedog reservoir dam Construction of the dam started in 1963 after the passing of an Act of Parliament ordering its creation to help prevent flooding of the River Severn in winter and to maintain its water levels in the summer. Local opposition was strong against the construction of the reservoir as it would result in the flooding of much of the Clywedog valley and the drowning of of agricultural land. On top of several disruptions and protests, during construction in 1966 a bomb was detonated within the construction site, setting work back by almost 2 months. The political extremist group Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (MAC) was widely suspected of carrying out the bombing. The reservoir was opened in 1967 and till this day has been in continuous usage, generally filling with water over the winter months and gradually releasing it during the summer months. The reservoir is currently owned and operated by Severn Trent Water Limited with oversight and regulation by Natural Resources Wales. Clywedog Sailing Club operates on the lake, and Powys County Council's Staylittle Outdoor Centre delivers a range of adventure education both on the water and in the surrounding area. The dam operating plant runs self-sufficiently from a 500 kW hydro-electric turbine. The area around Clywedog dam is now a popular leisure destination offering scenic walks and wildlife watching. At the base of the dam lies the ruins of the Bryntail lead mine. In 2005 Natural Resources Wales installed an osprey nest platform near the reservoir. The nest has been in use by breeding ospreys since 2014; by the end of 2019 15 osprey chicks had been raised on the site. A web camera was installed in 2020 enabling video of the nest to be viewed on-line.

Formerly privately owned by Tiltware, LLC and later by the Rational Entertainment Group, the site was acquired by The Stars Group (then known as Amaya Gaming Group) in a deal where Amaya acquired all of Rational's assets, including PokerStars. A statement by Amaya said the takeover would not affect the activities of Full Tilt Poker. The deal was closed on August 1, 2014.Wall Street Journal: Amaya Completes Acquisition of Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker Just prior to the close of the purchase, Full Tilt Poker redirected and rebranded its domains from FullTiltPoker.com and FullTiltPoker.eu to FullTilt.com and FullTilt.eu. A company spokesperson stated the change reflected the fact Full Tilt had \\"expanded to offer a range of single and multi-player variations of casino games\\". Full Tilt has gaming licenses in Malta and the Isle of Man. Games offered Full Tilt offers both play and real money cash games and tournaments. Freeroll, satellite, sit-n-go, and multi-table tournaments take place throughout the day and often included participation from Full Tilt‚Äôs sponsored professionals. The site offers the following poker variations in limit, pot-limit, and no-limit: Texas Holdem, Omaha, and Omaha 8 or Better (a.k.a. Omaha hi/lo). The site also offers limit Razz, Stud, Stud 8 or better, Draw poker variants and mixed games such as H.O.R.S.E. Stakes offers ranged from $0.01/$0.02 blinds to $500/1000 blinds in big bet games and up to $2000/4000 limits in limit games. In early 2010, Full Tilt introduced a new poker variation called \\"Rush Poker\\" designed to increase the number of hands a player can play per hour. In \\"Rush Poker\\" players do not remain at a specific table. Instead, they join a pool with hundreds of other players. Whenever they fold their hand, they are instantly transferred to a new table and dealt a new hand. Full Tilt Poker also launched Rush Poker Mobile for iOS and Android devices. History Full Tilt Poker initially opened as an online poker card room with the involvement of poker professionals Howard Lederer, Phil Ivey, Andy Bloch, Mike Matusow, Jennifer Harman and Chris Ferguson. Full Tilt Poker was launched by parent company TiltWare, LLC in June 2004 and began full operation on July 10, 2004.Full Tilt Poker Unveils Official Site The license of Full Tilt Poker was suspended by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission on June 29, 2011 and revoked on September 29, 2011. =Legal Issues= In late 2008, Full Tilt was sued in Nevada by Clonie Gowen, prominent poker professional and former Full Tilt endorser. She claimed that during Full Tilt's formative year of 2004, she was offered a 1% ownership in the company in exchange for her promotional efforts. The suit was dismissed by a trial court, but later partly reinstated on appeal. On April 29, 2009, James B. Hicks filed a civil complaint against Tiltware, LLC (d/b/a FullTiltPoker.com), TiltProof, Inc., and Chris Ferguson generally alleging unfair and unlawful business practices including illegal Internet gaming and violations of the UIGEA. Hicks sought to prevent Full Tilt from operating its website, soliciting players, or funding or accepting payments for illegal gambling in California. On September 11, 2009, Full Tilt was sued civilly in Nevada by Jason Newitt in the case of Jason Newitt v. Tiltware; Full Tilt Poker; Pocket Kings Ltd.; Pocket Kings Consulting Ltd.; Ray Bitar; Howard Lederer. Newitt alleges that he was unfairly fired and that his distribution payments were unfairly ceased. On October 1, 2009, Lary Kennedy and Greg Omotoy filed suit against Full Tilt Poker, Tiltware and several individual members of Team Full Tilt alleging fraud, libel, slander, false advertising, and racketeering. Kennedy and Omotoy filed suit following unsuccessful attempts to have Full Tilt refund $80,000 which it had seized from Kennedy‚Äôs and Omotoy‚Äôs accounts asserting a violation of Full Tilt‚Äôs Terms of Service for using \\"bots\\". On October 17, 2009, Full Tilt responded to Kennedy‚Äôs lawsuit by claiming the suit was baseless and frivolous and stating that it \\"has never knowingly allowed ‚Äòbots‚Äô to play on its site.\\" After the case was removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California, on April 26, 2010, Judge Margaret Morrow dismissed the case with leave stating that Kennedy had failed to \\"detail many portions of her case regarding state violations and, in particular, there could be no claim under the RICO Act. However, as the case was dismissed with leave, Kennedy may re-file the complaint in federal court if she is able to correct the deficiencies in her original complaint. On April 5, 2010, the Financial Times reported that a federal grand jury in Manhattan was investigating Full Tilt Poker and individuals associated with the company, including Howard Lederer and Chris Ferguson, for violations of gambling and money-laundering laws. Although neither the Manhattan United States Attorney nor officials with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) would comment on the matter, it was reported that such an investigation \\"would fit the federal law enforcement strategy by trying to make an example out of prominent targets\\". The DOJ maintained that online poker violates the Interstate Wire Act of 1961 (Federal Wire Act), but later changed their opinion on that matter. On April 15, 2011, the DOJ unsealed an indictment, dated March 10, 2011, against two of the owners / employees (Ray Bitar and Nelson Burtnick) of Full Tilt Poker, along with some of the owners / employees of PokerStars and Absolute Poker.justice.gov The defendants were charged with fraud, money laundering, and violation of United States federal gambling laws, and certain domain names for the sites were seized by the FBI. The Full Tilt Poker homepage was reinstated six days later on April 20, 2011. On September 20, 2011, the DOJ accused certain Full Tilt principals of defrauding poker players out of more than $300 million. The U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York filed a motion to amend an earlier civil complaint to allege that company directors Chris Ferguson, Howard Lederer, Rafe Furst, and Ray Bitar operated what the DOJ claims was a Ponzi scheme that allowed the company to pay out $444 million to themselves and other owners, which included other famous poker players. A lawyer for Ferguson has denied the allegations, suggesting that the issues may have been the result of mismanagement rather than malice. Bitar surrendered to authorities on July 2, 2012, to deal with the civil and criminal case that is pending against him in New York . On April 15, 2013, Bitar reached a deal with prosecutors to plead guilt to criminal charges, and was sentenced to time served and ordered to surrender his assets, rumored to include various homes and $40 million in cash. =Full Tilt Relaunch= PokerStars, having acquired the assets of Full Tilt as part of its settlement with the DOJ, reopened Full Tilt Poker on Nov. 6, 2012 to players from most of the world. Customers from the United States could not either sign up for new accounts nor play from their existing accounts. The new Full Tilt Poker remained a standalone site with its own software and player pool separate from that of PokerStars. On August 1, 2014, Amaya Gaming Group completed the purchase of Rational Group, the owner of PokerStars and Full Tilt, for $4.9 billion. Both poker sites continued to operate as separate entities until May 17, 2016. On that date, the user base of Full Tilt gained access to the global player pool at PokerStars, and the old Full Tilt platform was retired. There is still a separate Full Tilt website, but the Full Tilt poker software available for download is just a re-skinned version of the PokerStars poker client, and the games present at both sites are identical. =Ex-members of Team Full Tilt= Full Tilt's team of professionals was an integral part of the company's marketing strategy, its slogan being \\"Learn, Chat and Play with the Pros.\\" \\"Team Full Tilt\\" was composed of fourteen noted professionals who played regularly on the site and were considered full-fledged members.

It is almost a walk from Teesside International Airport; only one train per week calls here (on Sundays) and bus links to the airport and other destinations were withdrawn many years ago. Consequently, the station has become one of Britain's least-used, with an estimated 206 passenger entries/exits in 2018/19. In 2012/13 and 2013/14 it was the least used station in the country, with just eight passengers a year in both periods. The station has two platforms, each long enough for a four-car train; however, since December 2017, only one is in use. History The station is on the original route of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, from Darlington South Junction; it was opened by British Rail on 3 October 1971. The airport itself changed its name to Durham Tees Valley Airport in 2004 but reverted to Teesside International Airport in 2019; the station's name was never updated to reflect either change. In 2007, the train operating company Northern erected new signs reading \\"Teesside Airport\\", replacing previous signs which had used a hyphen in \\"Tees-side\\". National Rail now also lists the station as \\"Teesside Airport\\".

The eastbound service was withdrawn in the December 2017 timetable change because of concerns over the weak footbridge. Other services use this line, but pass the station without stopping. The airport is approximately 15-minute walk from the station and accessibility issues are a major factor in its lack of usage.\\"Britain's least visited railway station had just fourteen passengers in a year\\" Armstrong, Jeremy; Daily Mirror news article 2-05-2013; Retrieved 2014-04-09 The station did have a more frequent service in the past (the 1986 British Rail timetable had one train per hour in each direction, seven days a week), but since the early 1990s it has received only a bare minimum \\"parliamentary\\" service to avoid the need for formal closure proceedings. On 24 October 2009, a group of 26 people travelled to and from the station on the only scheduled service, to highlight the station's existence and its limited service, and to try to persuade railway authorities to move it 500 metres closer to the airport terminal. The station was featured in October 2010 on the BBC Radio 4 programme \\"The Ghost Trains of Old England\\", which mentioned the campaign and the fact that the station has a working payphone. It was also suggested that a large proportion of the tickets sold for the station are bought by collectors who wish to own tickets with rare or unusual destinations, and do not necessarily travel.

History Eaglescliffe Station was the second station to be built along Yarm Road and deviates from the original course of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, that being the world's first steam operated passenger railway service. Originally the line ran on the east side of Yarm Road through Preston Hall (now more commonly known as Preston Park). However it is said that Lord Preston was so unhappy at the disruption that trains such as Locomotion No. 1 caused to his cattle he insisted that it be moved to the other side of the road. The railway station that served the parishes of Preston-on-Tees and Egglescliffe was called Preston, however the railway owners displeased at the cost of moving the railway decided to name the new station after Egglescliffe instead of Preston. It was opened on 25 January 1853, some six months after the Leeds Northern Railway had opened their line from Northallerton (on 2 June 1852). This newer route ran alongside the original S&D; line, which had its alignment altered to allow easy interchange between the two.Body, p.66 Originally it had four platforms, but the western pair were taken out of use in the late 1960s and subsequently removed. The new station became known as Eaglescliffe. There are various stories as to how the station got the name E _a_ glescliffe instead of E _g_ glescliffe as intended. One such avenue of stories is that the signwriter was sent a telegram to paint the sign 'Eaglescliffe' due to an error and another variant was that the signwriter thought there must have been an error and changed the name himself. In each variation of the story it is said that the sign was not changed for a period of time by which time the station became known as Eaglescliffe and the surrounding area has taken the name. In January 2011, construction work started on a new ticket office at the station.New station office offers a ticket to ride Facilities The station has been staffed since 2012 - the ticket office is open six days per week (07:15 - 18:20 weekdays, 07:15 - 13:15 Saturdays and public holidays) and was run by an independent company (Chester- Le-Track) in partnership with train operators Northern and Grand Central and Network Rail prior to 2018. A heated waiting room was opened in 2015 to replace the previous waiting shelters - this also has toilet facilities. Train running information is provided by digital CIS displays, automatic announcements and timetable posters.

After release of the EU version, EA's support and further development of the title was taken over by Rail Simulator Developments Ltd, who continued to provide updates, fixes, official expansion packs and new content to players. RSDL has also released a sequel to the first game called RailWorks.  Features  Steam, diesel and electric traction trains, keyboard or mouse control of throttles, brakes and switches with three control modes for varying player skills. A variety of scenarios are available as well as an exploratory style free roam mode. Cargos and passengers are animated, and weather changes dynamically with time. The game has been criticized by reviewers for not providing enough help for newcomers to train simulation, and lack of complete instructions in the guides. =Editing tools= A complete tool suite is also available to customise content, allowing terrain modeling either by hand using provided tools or via the import of DEM data from NASA; track construction based on a system of straights and arcs, allowing infinitely possible junction configurations, and scenery placement. A scenario editor allows the creation of tasks such as picking up passengers, hauling cargo and shunting wagons around yards. These tools also allow players to build unlimited sizes of layouts, create their own scenery and rolling stock and modify the provided content by adding features or re-skins. Reception Since release, Kuju Rail Simulator received generally positive reviews from reviewers. IGN awarded 7.0 out of 10, praising the title's attention to its source material. Some jagged graphics were criticized (with foliage going through the cab instead of bouncing off the windshield, for example) and the fact that only true rail fanatics could ever get any fun out of KRS. The lack of any in-game tutorials was mentioned, with \\"members of the community ... making video walk-throughs, while lamenting the lack of a thick, fully printed manual.\\" Rail Simulator Developments Ltd (later RailSimulator.com Ltd) With the release of Rail Simulator in October 2007, Kuju Entertainment finished development and disbanded the RailSim team turning its attention to the next project. Knowing the potential of the RailSim engine, and with backing from Fund4Games who owned the rights to the simulator, a new company was set up from some of the core members of the initial development team with the specific aim of fulfilling continued development of the brand and supporting users and third- party developers with add-on projects. RSDL produced two patches to the core simulator (Upgrade Mk1 and Mk2), developed and released add-ons, helped the release of third-party products, and visited exhibitions to promote the simulation and provide support for users via several community websites. In April 2009, a take over of RSDL was announced,Paul Jackson Announces RailSimuator.com with the development switching to a new version of the software called RailWorks which would be released on Steam. This change heralded a break from EA being the publisher in Europe and rights over the source code for Rail Simulator being transferred to single ownership by RailSimulator.com Ltd. Successor RailWorks (since renamed to Train Simulator) is the official successor to Rail Simulator, announced by Tim Gatland on 26 March 2009 on the official Rail Simulator website. The game was released on Steam on 12 June 2009 and in stores on 3 July 2009 in DVD-ROM format.http://www.railsimulator.com/en/node/5938 RailWorks is an upgrade to Rail Simulator, containing new rolling stock, tools that had to be separately downloaded, significant graphical advancements such as modification of the existing content, bug fixes, backwards compatibility and the ability to trade elements from the virtual world with other users online. RailWorks is a universal platform containing all content from the original European release and North American release.

Continuity =Canonical issues= Buffy comics such as this one are not usually considered by fans as canonical. Some fans consider them to be stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while other fans consider them as taking place in an alternative fictional reality. However, unlike fan fiction, overviews summarizing their story, written early in the writing process, were approved by both Fox and Joss Whedon (or his office), and the books were therefore later published as official Buffy merchandise. Also, the writers, Scott Lobdell, Fabian Nicieza, and Paul Lee made a strong effort to offer a non-contradictory continuity which fills the gap between the events of Buffy burning down her school gym (seen in The Origin), and \\"Welcome To The Hellmouth\\". Though, being published before the end of the television series Angel (1999 TV series), \\"Viva Las Buffy!\\" directly contradicts the fact that in the episode \\"Why We Fight,\\" Angel states that the only human he's ever sired while having a soul was Sam Lawson (in Viva they write Angel having also sired their original character Garner Siddle).

In 1882 this was replaced by an island platform by the NER to serve the growing town of South BankIronically, this was located on the same site as the present station.

In the show two chefs prepare two competing dishes, each using a special premium ingredient, but the dish that is ultimately served at the end of the show is determined by majority vote of the panelists, and then served only to those who voted for that dish. The show is continued by the from April 14, 2005. Format Each of the two hosts, Hiroshi Sekiguchi (Èñ¢Âè£ÂÆè) and Yuji Miyake (‰∏âÂÆÖË£ïÂè∏), chooses a particular dish for the contest, and oversees the dish's creation by his chef. For most of the show's run, Sekiguchi was in charge of the Red kitchen, and Miyake took the Yellow kitchen. In later episodes, the two dishes were pre-selected, and whichever meal Sekiguchi and Miyake prepared for his side was determined by a special dice throw. The competing dishes were typically from the same category; an example of a typical \\"battle\\" would be miso ramen versus salt-and-butter ramen. Other battles have included miso-based dishes versus mayonnaise-based dishes, chocolate fondant cake versus fruit tart, and even tacos versus spring rolls. The seven guests would be asked to choose which meal they would most like to eat. Unlike Iron Chef, where the judges would get to eat the food prepared by both chefs, only the guests who chose the winning dish were allowed to eat. There were three periods when the guests would vote; the first was when the dishes were announced, the second was after the \\"tasting time,\\" and the third was after both dishes had been completed. Though Sekiguchi and Miyake would be allowed to taste the dishes in progress and describe what they had eaten (often in dramatic fashion), the guests were allowed only one \\"tasting time,\\" where they got a sample of each kitchen's special ingredient, usually prepared in a manner similar to how it would be for the finished product. In the later episodes of the show, the tasting time was eliminated for all but one of the guests. The lucky guest, who was randomly chosen, would be allowed the samples as previously described, and would then have to describe what they tasted to the other guests. As a result, they would be the only one asked to choose the dish they wanted during the second voting. This was done to increase the suspense for the TV audience and put the guests on the same level as the audience. While the chefs were preparing their dishes, each side would reveal a special ingredient that they hoped would sway the guests to vote for their respective dishes. The special ingredients could be anything from the focus of the recipe, such as a meat or vegetable, to a sauce or flavoring component. Though most of the special ingredients were found in often remote areas of Japan, some came from outside Japan, such as Mongolia, Korea, and even Scotland. In very rare and unusual instances, the special ingredients were not food items, but rather tools for preparing or serving the dish, such as a granite bowl from Korea, used in the preparation of stone- cooked bibimbap, or a special cast iron press used to make taiyaki. Each kitchen's special assistant would go to where the special ingredient was grown/raised/manufactured/harvested, to both procure the special ingredient and observe how it was produced. At the end of the show, the two hosts would declare in unison: \\"\\" The word \\"\\", which appears in the show's graphics, is a transliteration of the Japanese word meaning \\"which one\\". The guests would press a button (corresponding to which dish they chose) and the side with the most votes was declared the winner. The winning host would then ask the loser to withdraw (tessh≈´, Êí§Êî∂). The losing host and his chef would then take away their losing dish, and the winning guests and host would then dine on their selection. The hungry losers would watch the winners eat. This would often be followed by a scene of the winning host and guests leaving the show set satisfied after their meal, a scene of the losing host and guests griping about not getting to eat as they left the studio, or sometimes both. At the very end of the show, the losing chef would typically be shown eating his dish alone, wondering why he did not win. Since each side had to prepare food for eight people (seven guests and the winning host, in the event of a complete 7-0 victory (later 9 portions for seven guests, the winning host, and the assistant for the winning kitchen) and typically fewer than that number would actually get to eat, any food left over after the winners had eaten was usually consumed by the show's crew. Since each show usually took hours to film, the hunger expressed by the losing guests at the end was genuine.

The New Dotch Cooking Show The format of the show is basically the same, except that tasting time has been completely eliminated for the contestants (Sekiguchi and Miyake still get to taste the works in progress). The contestant roster was expanded from 7 to 11 (occasionally 9), with 4 celebrity contestants (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi still appeared as a regular) and 7 (occasionally 5) additional contestants, called \\"Hara-Helicopters,\\" drawn from a pool. Typically, the Hara-Helicopters are everyday people, though some groups are distinctly categorized, e.g. schoolchildren, \\"idols,\\" \\"young men who have not eaten for 48 hours,\\" or restaurateurs. During the preparation of the meals, the celebrity contestants would be allowed to observe each chef's methods up close, and smell/feel (not taste) the various ingredients used, while the Hara-Helicopters would watch the action from their seats overlooking the stage. In some episodes, Kusanagi would bring a plate of one of the special ingredients up to the Hara-Helicopters so they could smell it.

The arcade originals are also modified slightly to end after a certain number of rounds. Super Xevious (1984) is also playable. It ran on the Namco ND-1 arcade system, being one of the first games to utilize it. Designed and released in conjunction with Namco Museum Vol. 1, Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1 represented the company's push to garner interest in re-releases of classic video games for newer hardware, with the Arrangement games being made to attract younger players to them. The development team had difficulties with porting the originals to the hardware, and as such made development last longer than anticipated. The soundtrack was to \\"immerse\\" players into the game's atmosphere, with sounds and musical cues that hearkened back to their childhood nostalgia. Vol. 1 reportedly sold very well, and was commonplace in Japanese arcade centers. The collection and its games have been praised for their presentation and gameplay, with one critic saying that it could help open up a new market for re-releases of older arcade games. The Arrangement games have since been re-released several times as part of various Namco compilation disks for other platforms. It was followed by a sequel, Namco Classic Collection Vol. 2, in 1996. Games In-game screenshot, showcasing the game selection menu. Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1 is a compilation of three classic Namco arcade games from the early 1980s ‚Äî Galaga (1981), Xevious (1983), and Mappy (1983) ‚Äî as well as brand-new remakes of each game, known as \\"Arrangements\\". The original arcade games have been reprogrammed from scratch, and feature many of the same bugs and glitches present in their predecessors. Additionally, they end after a set number of rounds, featuring a proper ending sequence and credit roll. Super Xevious (1984), a Japan-exclusive update to the original Xevious, can also be played through the Xevious selection screen. The three Arrangement games feature updated visuals, gameplay, and sound, alongside the addition of two-player co-operative play. Galaga Arrangement replaces the dual fighter mechanic from the original with a more traditional power-up system, where shooting down specifically-colored Boss Galaga aliens with a capture fighter will instead transform the player into a new ship with different attacks, with their color indicating their ability; blue is a wide shot, yellow is a rapid-fire, and red fires three projectiles that can reflect off of other enemies and collide with others. The bonus stages, or \\"Challenging Stages\\", feature sporadic enemy formations that will circle around as the backgrounds warp and rotate in accordance with the enemy flight patterns. Xevious Arrangement is close to the original game, featuring new enemies, different bosses, and a wide-shot power-up that can be found by bombing specific pyramid structures on the ground. Several different stage types have been added, such as ones that take place over mechanical fortresses and South American temples. There are also three extra stages that can be played after completing the game. Mappy Arrangement focuses primarily on its two-player co-op, featuring a split-screen stage design. It adds several new mechanics to the original Mappy gameplay, including trapdoors, springboards that propel either player to the floor above them, and a boss fight with a giant mechanical Nyamco robot. Development and release The development staff had difficulties with porting the original arcade games to a then-modern hardware. Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1 was released worldwide by Namco in November 1995. Produced for the Namco ND-1 arcade system, the game was created out of the company's desire to increase interest in re-releases of older video games for newer audiences and more modern platforms, with the Arrangement games made to help attract in newer fans with improved visuals, gameplay, and music. It was released in conjunction with Namco Museum Vol. 1, a similar compilation published for the PlayStation. The development staff had difficulties with porting the original arcade games to a then-modern arcade system, which made development itself take longer than anticipated and more stressful for the designers. The soundtrack was to \\"immerse\\" players into the game's atmosphere, with sounds and musical cues that hearkened back to their childhood nostalgia. The Arrangement games included have been re-released in other compilation disks. Xevious Arrangement, alongside the original Xevious, Super Xevious and Xevious 3D/G, was ported to the PlayStation in 1997 as part of Xevious 3D/G+, being a near arcade-perfect rendition. Galaga Arrangement was compiled into the 2001 Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube game Namco Museum, as well as several other Namco video games. This version of the game is a recreation from the original arcade hardware, and features music at a slightly-altered pitch because of this. The Galaga Arrangement included in Namco Museum Battle Collection (2005) and Namco Museum Virtual Arcade (2009) is not the same as the one in Vol. 1, instead being an entirely new game with mechanics and ideas borrowed from the original. Mappy Arrangement has never seen a re-release outside of arcades. In 1998, Pony Canyon released the soundtrack for Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1 under their Wonder Spirits album label, which included linear notes from the development staff and \\"battle cards\\", small cardstock cards that featured designs based on the game. Reception Edge magazine viewed Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1 as being Namco's way of garnering interest in classic game re-releases through the usage of remakes of the included games, and praised the company for their efforts in doing so. They also called the included games \\"superb\\", and felt that both it and its home counterpart, Namco Museum Vol. 1, could potentially open up a new market for both re-releases and remakes of older games. Game Machine showed interest in the collection for compiling Namco's older catalog into a modern-day machine, alongside the addition of new, \\"exciting\\" remakes of each game. The Arrangement games in particular have garnered praise, and were liked for their gameplay and presentation. In their review of Namco Museum for the GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation 2, GameSpot said that the Arrangement games included, particularly Galaga Arrangement, were fun to play, but that the originals were still the best. IGN by a stark contrast lambasted Galaga Arrangement for being what they labeled as a poor update to the original, harshly criticizing its design choices for being \\"terribly flawed\\", as well as its graphics for making projectiles and enemies hard to stop in the moving backgrounds. Retrospectively in 2018, Hardcore Gaming 101 found Mappy Arrangement to be the weakest of the three for failing to successfully build upon the original. While they liked some aspects of it, such as the hidden \\"real mode\\", they felt that it ultimately fell short compared to the other two. They wrote: \\"Though Namco ported many of their arranged versions to various compilations, this one stayed arcade exclusive, and for good reason ‚Äì none of its additions are particularly well thought out, and is just another example of how the developers never really knew how to iterate on the original game.\\" By contrast, Hardcore Gaming 101 commended Xevious Arrangement for its multitude of additions to the core gameplay of the original, including fixing many of its faults and bugs. They said the game \\"should be in game design manuals under 'how to successfully remake a classic game'\\" for being a successful update to the original Xevious, and one that was \\"pleasing to play\\" with the addition of a new soundtrack and power-up items.

Opened to serve Teesside Steelworks, it is located on the Tees Valley Line and was latterly managed by Northern. In 2017/18 it was the least used station in Britain, with an estimated 40 passenger entries/exits. Due to the fact that the British Steel site is no longer publicly accessible, Northern suspended all services to and from the station in December 2019.  History  The station opened on 19 June 1978 and is situated on a re-sited portion of route that was commissioned on that date by British Rail to allow the previous alignment to be used for an expansion of the steelworks site. This included a station at that the current structure replaced. According to the Strategic Rail Authority, only 486 entries and exits were recorded for the station during the 2004‚Äì05 period, mainly due to there being no public access to and from the station (it being located on Tata Steel Europe property) and also due to the limited service. However, the numbers had increased to 1,570 entries and exits by the 2014‚Äì15 period. The majority of the steelworks, including the Redcar blast furnace, Redcar and South Bank coke ovens and the BOS plant at Lackenby, closed in 2015, resulting in a drop in passenger usage of the station from the previous year. In the 2016‚Äì17 period the entries and exits dropped to only 50, becoming the fourth least used station in Britain. In the 2017‚Äì18 period, it was the least used station in Britain with only 40 passengers, surpassing . Work is beginning on regenerating the site of the former steelworks by the South Tees Development Corporation. As part of their vision they are hoping to revamp the station and improve the service frequency. Services ceased to call at the station from 14 December 2019. The station received a boost in its usage figures during the 2018-19 period, recording 360 up from 40 during the previous period. This is highly likely to be as a result of its then title of Britain's 'least used railway station'. Services At the time of its suspension there were two trains in each direction Monday to Saturday. The two eastbound services served all stations to with one originating from (coming via , and ) and the other originating from (via and Middlesbrough).

He is from the town of Tuch√≠n, Colombia. Biography Flavio Caballero who was born in Cartagena, Bol√≠var in October 6 of 1952, grew up with two childhood dreams: he wanted to become both a hair dresser and an actor. When he was in high school, he became more interested in hair styling, and he was a medium average student, becoming able only to attend a public careers school, where he pursued a career as a hair stylist and fashion designer. Eventually, he began losing interest in that career, focusing instead on becoming an actor. Caballero began to study acting at the Instituto de Extras de television y Novelas. Caballero established himself in Caracas, Venezuela, where he kept trying to get a job as a soap opera extra, at the Instituto de Extras de Television y Novelas. He also studied cake making in Quibdo (Colombia) and Venezuela. In 1970, Caballero made his debut, acting in an Italian-Spaniard- French production, Il Corsaro Nero (Black Pirate). Caballero proceeded to act in more than two theatre plays, and, in 1976, he appeared on Venezuelan screens for the first time, in a film named El Reba√±o de los Angeles (Angel's Herd)as an extra. In 1982, Flavio made his telenovela debut, acting in La Se√±orita Perdomo. He commented in that role, noticing that it somehow reminded him of the death of his brother who was infected with the AIDS virus due to his brother's homosexuality and drug abuse, which also was rampant at his household at the time. That soap opera was the first of three produced by Radio Caracas Television that Caballero would participate in, including Aventurera, and 2002's Mi Gorda Bella (My Beautiful Fat Girl). Perhaps Caballero's most important career year was 1989, when starring in Amanda Sabater alongside Maricarmen Regueiro. Caballero played Ivan Moros due to a sudden sickness by the main actor in the soap opera. Amanda Sabater was an heiress whose father was Diego Sabater. However, and unknown to the two main characters in the soap opera, Diego was really Ivan's father and not Amanda's. This soap opera was shown in Mexico, Puerto Rico and on Spanish-language television in the United States. Caballero was under contract with RCN Television of Colombia as a secondary role extra in some soap operas.

Later he was Sultan Mohamed bin Hajj Ali Thukkala. He was also known as Dhevvadhoo Rasgefaanu. The coral stone mosque in Fenfushi which is a UNESCO heritage site was built between 1692-1701 CE during Sultan Mohamed bin Hajj Ali Thukkala's reign. It is one of the few coral stone mosques which are with all of the components in the complex in good condition. This includes the mosque building, wells made of coral stone, a unique bathing tank of coral stone, a sun dial, tombstones of fine quality with within the large cemetery and boundary wall of coral masonry with two entrances surrounding the mosque. The mosque has a symbol used by Sultan Mohamed bin Hajj Ali Thukkalaa suggesting that it might have been repaired or renovated by him. He took great interest in learning, scholarship, forbade inhumane punishments, reduced taxation, assisted those who were in debt and restored the mosques. His first marriage was to H.H. Sanfaa Kanba Khadija Kabafaanu Rani Kilege who was the elder daughter of Ibrahim Sahbandaru Kilege of Isdu. His second marriage in 1693 was to Maryam Kabafanu who was the widow of H.H. Sultan Sayyd Muhammadh Shamsuddin al-Hamawi and former wife of Sultan Muhammad Muhiudin Adil, and daughter of the Velana Thakurufaanu of Fenfuri. His third marriage was to Sanfaa Bifaanu who was the daughter of the Vizier Haji Hussain Handegiri Kilege Thakurufaanu. Before Sultan he was a magistrate for fourteen years and he assigned Hassan Thajudeen as the new chief justice on the seventh day Wednesday 12 November 1692 of him becoming Sultan. The sale of independent women and their employment as unpaid slaves was prohibited during his reign. Before this the aristocracy was free to make people work without pay and could sell them just like slaves. Slaves were encouraged to appeal to Hassan Thajudeen who instructed them released and made a symbolic payment to the owners. People were made debt free after checking their accounts with outstanding paid by the treasury. Homeless orphans were given the right to inherit deceased people's properties. The use of swords and daggers to avenge adultery were prohibited and instructed to be carried through the judgements of the court. For the first time in history slavery was forbidden during Sultan Ali Thukkala's reign. A grant issued in the matter of building and upkeep of a mosque in the island of Geney in Thiladhummathi Atoll of Maldives, in late AD 1696 under the Seal of the King Siri Kula Ran Mani of Maldives referred to him as \\"Malekaddu Midhemedhu ekanuonna mi korhu anikaneh nethee korhu\\" which meant \\"Sole Sovereign with no other over what lies between Maliku and Addu\\".

Many circles, in addition to donating their money, also contribute their time and skills to support local causes.  Structure and function  The current manifestation of giving circles is a relatively new trend, but it is built on traditions dating back hundreds of years to mutual aid societies and other forms of giving for the community. In the United States, giving circles were initially composed of women; they are now more diverse in race, age and gender, although women continue to make up the majority of members. The structure of the circles can be informal or formal. On the informal side, circles may vote and choose an organization to support and each member writes an individual check. Formal circles may have their money housed at a local community foundation and have staff that support the work of the circle. Giving circles can range in size from a handful of members to several hundred. Individual donors who join or form a giving circle typically seek to build community within their circle through social events, in addition to the economic impacts of the groups. In a 2007 study, the Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers' New Ventures in Philanthropy initiative identified approximately 400 giving circles in the United States, more than double the number from two years earlier. A survey of 160 circles, published in 2008, found they had leveraged nearly $100 million, $13 million of this in 2006 alone. Nearly 12,000 people took part in the 160 giving circles surveyed. Nearly half of circles have male participants, and the popularity of giving circles is also growing among racial, ethnic and tribal communities as well as in the gay and lesbian community. Another study conducted in 2005 by Angela M. Eikenberry, an associate professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, found that giving circles generally bring both long-time and new philanthropists to organized philanthropy. For both groups, participation seems to increase levels of giving while bringing ‚Äúnew money‚Äù to the nonprofit sector; especially to small and locally based organizations. Members also seem to learn about and give to organizations and individuals, and in areas of interest, they most likely would not have given to otherwise. In addition, members are more thoughtful, focused and strategic in their personal giving because of educational experiences in the giving circle. These findings are based on 30 interviews with giving circle participants, staff, and philanthropic professionals working with giving circles, document analysis, and secondary data. Research by Eikenberry and Jessica Bearman, published in 2009, and largely based on a survey of giving circle members compared to a control group, found that giving circles influence members to give more and to give more strategically. Their members give to a wide array of organizations and are highly engaged in the community. Giving circles increase members‚Äô knowledge about philanthropy, nonprofits, and the community but have a mixed influence on members‚Äô attitudes about philanthropy, nonprofit and government roles, and political/social abilities and values. Level of engagement, length of engagement, and size of the giving circle seem to matter most, when it comes to understanding giving circles‚Äô effects on members.  Examples  = United States = Examples of giving circles include the Zawadi giving circle in New Orleans, where 12 African American members collectively donated $24,000 over a two-year period. Their money has provided intensive math tutoring for students at a local school, along with other projects. The Queer Youth Fund, established in 2002 and based in Los Angeles, California, has invested more than $3 million in grants to small youth-led organizations in the United States and Canada that promote equality and justice for lesbian, gay, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQQ) youth. Founded in 2004, The African American Giving Circle of the Washington Area Women's Foundation has awarded over $120,000 in grants to community-based organizations in Washington, D.C. serving African American women and girls.African American Women's Giving Circle Washington Area Women's Foundation website, accessed May 5, 2011. Dining for Women (DFW) is a giving circle headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina with chapters in other parts of the United States, which raises monthly for international charities that support women and girls facing extreme challenges in developing countries. In 2006, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders in Philanthropy (AAPIP) established a giving circle movement that has resulted in the distribution of over $2.2 million to Asian American communities across the United States. Included in this growing network of giving circles are the Lunar Giving Circle in San Francisco, Asian Giving Circle in Chicago, Cherry Blossom Giving Circle in Washington, D.C., and GVNGTogether in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2016, the Asian Women Giving Circle (AWGC) was studied by a Capstone team from NYU's Wagner School of public service. The team members were Carlos Rodriguez, Janice Lam, David Portalatin, Nicole Moriarty, and Paulina Toro. Amplifier Giving (www.AmplifierGiving.org) is the first concerted effort to network Jewish giving circles, catalyze the creation of new giving circles, educate circle members on best practices in philanthropy, and create a platform to connect NGOs and Jewish giving circles to each other efficiently and effectively. The Amplifier network includes 50 giving circles and 369 organizations. The Amplifier website has a circle and organization directory, online common grant application system, and a resource library with information about how to start and sustain a giving circle. The New York Times reported in 2013 that a giving circle, Women for Social Innovation, is providing seed money for social innovators helping women, girls and families in Greater Philadelphia. In 2014, the Latino Community Foundation launched the first Latino Giving Circle Network in the United States. As of August 2016, there are over 220 members in this network, which focuses on investing in Latino-led organization in California. = United Kingdom = The Kew Giving Circle in Kew, south west London, started meeting in January 1999 and is still active. It is the first recorded giving circle in the United Kingdom. Its members contribute to a pooled Charities Aid Foundation account and meet to agree payments from the account to their selected charities. The Funding Network is the largest known and first open giving circle in the UK. It is a charity that runs Dragons' Den-style events to bring together potential donors and charities to fund positive social change. It has raised over ¬£5 million for over 700 projects across the globe. =Asia= The number of giving circles in Asia is growing. The first study to describe and document Asian giving circles was published in 2013 by Dr Rob John at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.

It was later reprinted as part of a trade paperback collected edition. It was influenced by events detailed in the episode \\"Normal Again\\". The title references the best-selling memoir Girl, Interrupted, also about institutionalization. Story description =General synopsis= After running off to Vegas, Buffy has written in her diary tales of vampires and demons. Her parents have her put into a mental institution. Whilst there Buffy realises she enjoys the freedom, and the loss of her role as Slayer. However certain doctors are not what they appear. In England, Rupert Giles's use of magic has prevented a Watcher from causing destruction to the Council. =Buffy the Vampire Slayer #56= :Comic title: \\"Slayer, Interrupted, act 1\\" Buffy returns from Las Vegas where she had been on a trip with Pike. Dawn has been reading her diary, and tells their parents. Since Buffy had also recently burned down her school gym and run off to Las Vegas, they fear that she has lost her mind. Feeling like they have little choice, Buffy's parents have her committed. =Buffy the Vampire Slayer #57= :Comic title: \\"Slayer, Interrupted, act 2\\" Buffy is staying at an institution and sort of likes not having to slay vampires and other forces of evil night after night. However, something sinister is going on as the doctors may not have just the patients' interests at heart. Meanwhile Giles has to face consequences for using black magic even if it was done to protect the Watchers' Council. =Buffy the Vampire Slayer #58= :Comic title: \\"Slayer, Interrupted, act 3\\" Buffy had assumed the girls who claimed they were brides to the demon Rakagore were crazy, but when Rakagore shows up, Buffy is forced to reconsider.

Career Otsuka earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree in politics from Balliol College, Oxford, under the direction of G. A. Cohen, on a Marshall Scholarship, after graduating from Yale University with a bachelor's degree in political science summa cum laude in 1986. Prior to moving to the London School of Economics in 2013, Otsuka was Professor of Philosophy at University College London, where he had taught since 1998, and, before that taught at UCLA and the University of Colorado. Philosophical work Otsuka has written extensively in political philosophy on topics such as equality and left-libertarianism. Otsuka is a proponent of actual-consent forms of government, in opposition to the mainstream of political theory which has thought such systems to be unworkable. He has also published articles in normative ethics on the morality of harming and saving from harm. Otuska also defends what is known as \\"equal opportunity left-libertarianism\\", which interprets One of Otsuka's most influential articles‚Äîcited and critiqued by Jeff McMahan in his own work The Ethics of Killing‚Äîis \\"Killing the Innocent in Self-Defense\\" (Philosophy & Public Affairs, 1994) In this article, Otsuka develops what he calls the Moral Equivalence Thesis, according to which Innocent Threat (e.g., the body of Falling Person is about to kill you by crushing you to death but who was thrown off the top of a building by an evil Villain) is on a moral par with Bystander, or one who is not at all responsible for whatever endangers your life. Imagine a javelin is heading toward you and will kill you unless you pull Bystander into its path so it kills Bystander instead. Because it would be morally impermissible to kill Bystander in this way, it would also be morally impermissible for you to kill Falling Person by, say, vaporizing him with a ray gun. Further, it is morally impermissible to kill an Innocent Aggressor, or someone who endangers your life because of her intention to kill you but whose actions are beyond her control. Imagine someone who has been hypnotized and whose aim is to kill you. It is wrong to kill Innocent Aggressor because he is on a moral par with Innocent Threat, who is on a par with Bystander. So, it is wrong to kill Innocent Aggressor because he is on a par, morally, with Bystander.

The long-line Public Address system (PA) has been renewed and upgraded with pre-recorded train announcements. History The station was opened by the Stockton and Darlington Railway as the terminus of their line from Redcar on 17 August 1861 (although the ornate station building was not finished until the following year). Eleven years later, the North Eastern Railway opened a line towards Brotton (the Whitby Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway)Body, p. 146 from the town, but this diverged from the original route some west of the 1861 station in order to avoid excessively steep gradients further east. This meant the passenger trains from the town to Loftus and Whitby that started in 1875 had to reverse into and out of the terminus before regaining the correct direction at Saltburn West Junction. This line is still in operation today to serve the Skinningrove Steelworks and the Boulby potash mine, although passenger trains ceased in 1958. In its heyday, the station had four platforms and a sizeable number of carriage sidings to handle the large quantities of excursion trains that ran there - these included services from as far away as Leeds and Blackpool.Binns, p. 31 There was also a short siding extension (approximately ) from the main station to another platform at the rear of the railway-owned Zetland Hotel (opened in 1863) where passengers in first class carriages could disembark directly into their accommodation. A 1974 remodelling scheme Hunt, J - Article in RAIL Magazine, Issue 610 (January 2009); p.49 saw the station reduced in size however, with the two main platforms & signal box being taken out of use along with most of the sidings and one of the two running lines from West Junction. Today both of the two surviving excursion bay platforms are used for scheduled services (though most trains use platform 1) but neither the main station building nor the Zetland Hotel is in rail-related use - the former having been converted into a photographic studio, cafe and various other retail outlets and the latter into luxury flats.

A pusher biplane based on the successful Farman III, it was one of the first aircraft types to be built in quantity. As the type was used by Bristol for instruction purposes at their flying schools at Larkhill and Brooklands many early British aviators learned to fly in a Boxkite. Four were purchased in 1911 by the War Office and examples were sold to Russia and Australia. It continued to be used for training purposes until after the outbreak of the First World War. Background The Zodiac biplane at the 1910 Aero Show. The almost uncambered wing section is clearly visible. The original intention of Sir George White, the founder and chairman of Bristol Aircraft, was to build licensed copies of the Zodiac biplane, designed by Gabriel Voisin.Barnes 1988, p. 45 One example of this design was imported from France and exhibited by Bristol at the 1910 Aero show in London in March 1910, and afterwards taken to Brooklands for flight testing. Initial attempts to get it to fly were entirely unsuccessful. This was largely due to its unsatisfactory wing section (the shallow camber of the Zodiac's wings had been commented upon by the aviation journal Flight), but the aircraft was also underpowered for its weight, and a new set of wings did little to improve performance. A single brief flight on 28 May was achieved by Maurice Edmond, but after an accident that damaged its undercarriage on 10 June it was abandoned, as was work on five more examples being built at Filton.Barnes 1988, p .46 Sir George was advised to acquire rights to build copies of the successful Farman biplane. This proved impossible since George Holt Thomas was negotiating rights with the Farman company, but George Challenger, the chief engineer at Bristol's factory in Filton, believed that he could produce a satisfactory copy since full details of the Farman machine had been published in Flight. This was authorized by Sir George, and Challenger set to work on drawings for a new aircraft.Penrose 1969, p. 235. The first example was constructed in a matter of weeks, using some components from the abandoned production Zodiacs, and was delivered to the company's flying school at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain, where it was first flown on 30 July 1910, piloted by Maurice Edmond.Barnes 1988, p. 48 Farman sued Bristol for patent infringement, but the company's lawyers claimed substantial design improvements in matters of constructional detail, and the lawsuit was dropped.Barnes 1988, p. 47 Design and development The Boxkite was a two- bay biplane with an elevator carried on booms in front of the wings and an empennage consisting of a pair of fixed horizontal stabilisers, the upper bearing an elevator, and a pair of rudders carried on booms behind the wing. There were no fixed vertical surfaces. Lateral control was effected by ailerons on both upper and lower wings. These were single-acting, the control cables arranged to pull them down only, relying on the airflow to return them to the neutral position. The wings and fixed rear horizontal surfaces were covered by a single layer of fabric: the other surfaces were covered on both sides. Power was usually provided by a Gnome rotary engine, although other engines were also used. This was mounted on a pair of substantial wooden beams mounted above the lower wing: these continued forward to carry the seats, which were arranged in tandem, with the pilot sitting over the leading edge of the wing. The undercarriage consisted of a pair of long skids, each bearing a pair of wheels sprung by bungee cords, and a single sprung tailskid mounted below the leading edge of the lower tailplane. The first two Boxkites, assigned works numbers 7 and 8, differed in detail from the later production aircraft; the front outrigger booms were braced by a pair of vertical struts and were attached to the ends of the interplane struts. This arrangement was inherited from the Zodiac,Penrose 1967, p. 236 being necessary in that aircraft because the front spar of the wing did not also form the leading edge. Additionally the rear elevator had a straight trailing edge. No. 8 also had double-surfaced wings; the wings of No. 7 were single-surfaced with the ribs enclosed in pockets, like production aircraft. No. 7 was initially fitted with a 50 hp (37 kW) Gr√©goire, but for its first flight this was replaced by a Gnome, although the Gr√©goire was later refitted for trial purposes: No. 8 had a 50 hp (37 kW) E.N.V.Barnes 1988, p. 48 The first examples built had upper and lower wings of equal span, although most of the aircraft eventually produced had an extended upper wing and were known as the Military Version. The examples of this type sold to the Russian government and the first aircraft sold to the British Army were fitted with a third rudder hinged to the centre leading-edge interplane strut of the tailplane, but this was not made standard.Barnes 1988,p. 51 Two modified Boxkites were produced for competition purposes. The first, No. 44, was a single-seater built to compete in the 1911 Circuit of Europe air race and had reduced wingspan and a nacelle for the pilot, similar to the Bristol Type T. The second, No.69, was a redesign by Gabriel Voisin, who was employed as a consultant by Bristol. This had no front elevator, monoplane tail with a single rudder, and a reduced gap between the wings. It was tested at Larkhill in February 1912, but was evidently unsuccessful since it was soon rebuilt as a standard Boxkite and was to crash in November 1912. Production continued until 1914 with a total of 78 being built, 60 of which were the extended Military Version, one racer (No. 44) and the voisin variant (No. 69); all but the last six aircraft were built at Filton. The remaining six were built at Brislington by the Tramway Company.Barnes 1988, pp. 51-53 Operating history Postcard showing a Bristol Boxkite flying over Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain After the successful flight on Salisbury Plain No. 7 and a second aircraft, No. 8, were sent to Lanark to take part in the aviation meeting held there in August. These aircraft were then assigned to the Bristol flight schools, No. 7 at Brooklands and No. 8 at Larkhill. In September a third aircraft was completed and delivered to Larkhill, and both the Larkill machines participated in the Army manoeuvres held on Salisbury Plain that month. No. 8 was flown by Bertram Dickson, and was captured by Blue team cavalry when it landed in order to report by telephone,Penrose 1967, p. 240 and No. 9 by Robert Loraine. This aircraft was equipped with a radio transmitter for trials and was the first aeroplane in the United Kingdom to send a message by radio.Barnes 1988, p.15. Between 11 and 16 November a series of demonstration flights were made in Bristol. Temporary hangars were built on Durdham Down and although flying was limited by the weather conditions a crowd of almost 10,000 saw Maurice Tetard make a fifteen-minute flight on the Saturday. The most spectacular flights were made the following Tuesday, when around ten flights were made between 7 and 9 o'clock, including a fifteen-minute flight by Tetard during which he flew over Clifton Suspension Bridge and made a circuit over the suburbs of Redland and Westbury. Weather conditions then deteriorated and only a single flight was made in the afternoon, when Tetard made a single circuit, cutting his flight short owing to the turbulent winds caused by the proximity of the Avon Gorge. On the final day the crowds gathered early but wind conditions prevented any flying. At about half-past three it was announced that there would be no more flying, despite which Tetard then made a short straight-line flight reaching no more than 20 ft in altitude, earning a \\"cheery ovation\\" from the crowd by then numbering around 12,000. Boxkite at Durdham Down. Sir George White is standing in front of the aircraft. On 14 March 1911, the British War Office ordered four Boxkites for the planned Air Battalion Royal Engineers, the first production contract for military aircraft for Britain's armed forces. The first Boxkite, powered by a 50 hp Gnome engine, was delivered to Larkhill on 18 May that year. An order for a further four Boxkites was placed later that year, with the type mainly being used as a trainer.Bruce 1982, pp. 148‚Äì149. They continued in use with the Air Battalion and Royal Flying Corps (RFC) until December 1912.Bruce 1982, p. 150. Four more Boxkites were purchased by the RFC from the Bristol flying school at Brooklands following the outbreak of the First World War, with the last of these four Boxkites written off in February 1915.Bruce 1982, pp. 150‚Äì151. The Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) also made use of the Boxkite as a trainer, being used at its training schools at Eastbourne, Eastchurch and Hendon Aerodrome until at least 1915.Bruce 1957, pp. 108‚Äì109.Thetford 1978, p. 380. The majority of the aircraft produced were employed at the Bristol flying schools at Brooklands and Larkhill. These schools were responsible for training nearly half the pilots who gained licences in Britain before the First World War, and many distinguished pilots gained their licence in a Boxkite, including Brigadier-General Henderson, the first commander of the Royal Flying Corps, who gained his licence after less than a week of instruction.\\"A British General Gets His Brevet\\", Flight, 26 August 1911 p745 =Australia= Bristol Boxkite Replica at RAAF Museum At the end of November two Boxkites were shipped to Australia for a promotional tour, and in Australia No. 10 was flown first by Joseph Hammond, who made the first aeroplane flight in West Australia from Belmont Park Racecourse on 3 January 1911. On 20 February 1911 Hammond flew the first cross-country flight made between towns in Australia from Altona Bay to Geelong in Victoria, and on 23 February, also at Altona Bay, he made the first passenger flight in Australia, taking his mechanic Frank Coles for a 7¬Ω minute flight. Later that same day he took his wife for a 12¬Ω minute flight, making her the first woman to fly in Australia. Official observers from the Australian Army observed these demonstrations and were also taken for flights. Although reports were favorable no aircraft were ordered. After the flights in Melbourne Hammond returned to his home in New Zealand and the demonstrations in Sydney were made by his assistant, Leslie Macdonald, who took a photographer from the Daily Telegraph for a 25-minute flight over Sydney on 6 May, making the first aerial photographs to be taken in Australia. By 19 May, 72 flights totalling 765 miles had been made by No. 10; No. 11, still in its crate, was sold to W. E. Hart of Penrith, N.S.W, who used the aircraft to become the first Australian to gain a pilot's licence in Australia.\\"Bristol Flights Abroad\\" Flight 2 December 1911 p1050 The Boxkite would go on to be ordered by Central Flying School, the first military aviation unit in Australia, and aircraft number 133 would perform the first flight by the CFS, and first official Australian military flight, on 1 March 1914. It would continue to serve until written off in 1917. The second Boxkite to enter CFS service was actually built by the school after Bristol ceased making the aircraft available for order, and thus the Boxkite became the first military aircraft assembled in Australia. In all, four Boxkites would serve the CFS, training pilots through World War I. =India= A further two were sent to India, including No. 12, the first Boxkite built with an extended upper wing. In India the first flights were made by Henri Jullerot in Calcutta on 6 January 1911 before a crowd of 100,000.\\"Flying at Calcutta\\" Flight 14 January 1911 p38 He was invited to take part in the Deccan cavalry manoeuvres that were about to take place, and made a number of flights carrying Captain Sefton Brancker as his observer. He also took part in the Northern cavalry manoeuvres at Karghpur. Flying conditions there were demanding, with many rough landings caused by the terrain, and eventually No. 9 was cannibalised to provide spares to keep No. 12 flying.Barnes 1988, p. 49 =Other exports= Nos 27 and 28 were sold to Belgian Joseph Christiaens, who used them to make the first aeroplane flight in Singapore on 16 March 1911. He then took the aircraft to South Africa where a series of exhibition flights were made in Pretoria, and Christiaens sold No.28 to John Weston, who also became the Bristol company's representative in South Africa. Other examples were exported to Germany (2), Spain (2) and single machines to Romania, India, Bulgaria and Sweden.Barnes 1988, p. 52 Flyable reproductions No original Bristol Boxkites aeroplanes survive today, although three authentic flyable reproductions were built by the F.G. Miles group for the film Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines.Wheeler 1965, pp. 44‚Äì69. These were initially powered by a Rolls- Royce Continental A65 air-cooled flat four, but this produced insufficient power, due to the shorter-stroke, higher-RPM mid-20th century engine, driving a small-diameter modern propeller, being inefficient at the low airspeed achieved by the Boxkite, which originally used the slower-revving Gnome Omega 50 hp seven-cylinder rotary engine.Wheeler 1965, p. 48. This resulted in the replacement of the 65 hp flat-four by a Continental O-200-B engine. These proved flyable enough to be used for cross-country flights between filming locations. Another tribute to the soundness of the design is that the calculations made for the purpose of granting the necessary Certificates of Airworthiness found that the stressing of the design was very close to modern requirements.Barnes 1988, p. 53 After filming one was sent to the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery another to the Shuttleworth Collection in Bedfordshire, where it is still flown during flying displays when the weather permits, and the third to the Museum of Australian Army Flying in Queensland. A new Bristol Boxkite replica was constructed for the Australian Centenary of Military Aviation Air Show 2014. The aircraft had its test flight on 11 September 2013 at RAAF Base Williams, Point Cook. The Boxkite replica was built at the RAAF Museum over a seven-year period and to become a showcase display at the museum.

First joining the Kuomintang (KMT) during the early 1920s, Wei would rise to become general after the Northern Expedition, a two-year campaign to unify China. His later success under Chiang Kai-shek during the Bandit (Communist) Suppression Campaigns from 1930 to 1934 would earn him the nickname \\"Hundred Victories Wei\\". War with Japan General Wei Lihuang and Lieutenant General Sun Liren at the Burmese-Chinese border, 1945 A general during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Wei commanded the First War Area. With the entry of Great Britain and later the United States in the war against Japan, he was transferred to southern China as commander of the Nationalist Chinese XI Group Army. He later replaced General Chen Cheng as commander of the Chinese Expeditionary Forces, known as Y Force. Y-Force consisted of over 100,000 Nationalist soldiers, and participated in major ground operations in support of American General Joseph W. Stilwell's offensive in northern Burma. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Wei was able to work effectively with American commanders. General Wei Lihuang (right) and General Long Yun (left) inspecting troops of the Chinese Expeditionary Force, March 1944 Beginning his offensive into southern Yunnan on 11 May 1944, Wei's troops captured Tengchung on 15 September after two months of heavy fighting. Proceeding southward despite heavy resistance, his forces eventually linked up with Chinese divisions in Wanting, Burma on January 27, 1945. The success of this offensive allowed the Allies to reopen the former Burma Road supply network to China through Ledo, Burma, now named the Ledo Road. In concert with existing airlift operations over The Hump, the Ledo Road enabled overland transport of military supplies from Assam to Nationalist bases in China. Postwar career President of China Chiang Kai- Shek (left) with Wei Lihuang Recalled to northern China to again replace General Chen Cheng following the war, Wei was placed in command of KMT forces in northeast China in October 1947. After being cut off from land communication with the KMT with the communist capture of Chinchow (Jinzhou Èî¶Â∑û, Liaoning), he was supposedly planning for an offensive to recapture the Nationalist provincial capital before he was ordered to withdraw by Chiang Kai-shek. Shortly before the communist capture of Mukden (Shenyang), Wei would return to southern China following his replacement by his field commander Du Yuming in October 1948. In spite of Wei's earlier success, his tenure in the northeast was remarkably unsuccessful. He defied orders for more than a year to withdraw, and lost 300,000 troops. Taylor (2009) writes that \\"Of those, 246,000 were captured, and many if not most were quickly incorporated into the PLA\\" (p. 389). Chiang ordered Wei's house arrest. Wei made his way to Hong Kong in 1949, and moved to Beijing in 1955, where he would \\"participate in various organizations of the People's Republic\\" (Taylor, 2009, p. 389). He would live in the PRC until his death in 1960. References *Dupuy, Trevor N.

Founded in 1542, it is one of the oldest universities in Spain, with a history dating back to the Roman period. Prime Ministers Pascual Madoz, Manuel Aza√±a, Salustiano de Ol√≥zaga and Eusebio Bardaj√≠, the Nobel Prize laureate and father of modern neuroscience Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, the catholic saint Josemar√≠a Escriv√° and the Cuban national hero Jose Marti studied at this University. History The building of the Ancient Faculty of Medicine and Sciences in Zaragoza, now called Paraninfo. =Beginnings= Ecclesiastical Schools were the initial elements of the University of Zaragoza. These schools were later consolidated into the School of Zaragoza, led by Bishop Braulio during the 7th century (who would later be made the patron saint of the University). The School of Arts officially becoming a university in 1542, though some scholars argue it could be considered a University of Arts already from 1477.Gonz√°lez Anc√≠n, Miguel & Towns, Otis. (2017) Miguel Servet en Espa√±a (1506-1527). Edici√≥n ampliada, pp.186-189. =Foundation= The Studium Generale of Arts, also called Studio Mayor or primitive University of Zaragoza, was in the Magdalena and St. Nicholas neighborhoods. Its main building was a broad tower of circular base on the old wall of the city, and it had more than 20 chambers distributed in three different floors. Besides the normal chambers that were granted and rented by the University to both pupils and teachers, on the first floor the tower had the chamber called \\"General Mayor,\\" where the grades were provided, and also a library. On the second floor there was the prison, the latrines and the doorkeeper's chamber. Finally, in the last floor there were bigger rooms with balconies, and the chamber of the four Masters of Arts. The Studium had also bought more chambers in the tower surroundings and on the city wall, and the most important ones were the five chambers called \\"El Cocinador,\\" and eleven more in the Studium's square, called \\"El Corralet\\" chambers.Gonz√°lez Anc√≠n, Miguel & Towns, Otis. (2017) Miguel Servet en Espa√±a (1506-1527). Edici√≥n ampliada, pp. 181-186. The Studium's head was the Chancellor, a position always held by the archbishop of Zaragoza, and the second in command was the Vicechancellor, who was also the High Master of the Studium. The High Master collected taxes from any pupil, with the exception of the poor, the cleric from La Seo cathedral, or any student he would want to forgive such payment. Under him there were the four Masters of Arts, four positions reserved for selected individuals that held a master of arts degree, and who were in charge of the teaching of the liberal arts. Under them there were the \\"Bachilleres,\\" who were mostly teaching advanced Latin grammar, and the \\"Camareros,\\" who were providing more basic Latin lessons. The lowest rank teachers were the \\"Cubicularios,\\" also called \\"repetidores\\" in other Studiums, who merely repeated the lessons from the other teachers. The Studium also had a Rector, who was an apostolic position that represented the Archbishop's power in this primitive university, and had the power of approving all the academic positions in the Studium, and administrated the fees from the students for reparations and other needs of this university.Gonz√°lez Anc√≠n, Miguel & Towns, Otis. (2017) Miguel Servet en Espa√±a (1506-1527). Edici√≥n ampliada, pp. 158-172. The primitive University of Zaragoza had a Faculty of Aristotelian Logic and another of Philosophy (it included both Natural Philosophy and Aristotelian Ethics), and all together they formed the Faculty of Arts. But this Studium Generale had also a Faculty of Grammar, which had several hundreds of students during the first decades of the XVI century, while the Faculty of Arts had near 50. In order to get their grades, the students had to be endorsed by another older student or teacher and to pass private exams, and pay fees. Lessons were taught in the morning and afternoons, which made that many of them would rent chambers for staying at night.Gonz√°lez Anc√≠n, Miguel & Towns, Otis. (2017) Miguel Servet en Espa√±a (1506-1527). Edici√≥n ampliada, pp. 173-181 This primitive University of Zaragoza had physician master Pedro La Cabra as its first High Master, and after him the maestre Luis Gorriz, who died in 1510. After him, the archbishop appointed his personal physician, master Juan Tarabal, who remained in this position until 1520, when the archbishop died because of the plague. That year Tarabal was substituted by master Gaspar Lax, a prolific author and prominent European figure in logic, philosophy and mathematics, whose works were used in many other contemporaneous universities. Lax had been teaching in the University of Paris and later in the University of Huesca, and from 1520 he was simultaneously High Master and one of the four Masters of Arts. This High Master had erasmian friends, both in Paris and Zaragoza, and allowed Erasmus‚Äôs works to be taught in this Studium. That same year of 1520 Michael Servetus, brilliant nephew of Gaspar Lax, started his studies under the direction of his uncle and the other three Masters of Arts (Exerich, Ans√≠as, Miranda, Carnicer, Villalpando). Servetus became himself a Master of Arts in 1525, a position he held until 1527, when he had a brawl with his uncle Gaspar Lax, and after being expelled from the Studium he left Spain for Toulouse Studium Generale. Lax kept being the High Master until his death in 1560.Gonz√°lez Anc√≠n, Miguel & Towns, Otis. (2017) Miguel Servet en Espa√±a (1506-1527).

Buildings of the Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems in Zaragoza, Spain. The University of Zaragoza is the main centre of technological innovation in the Ebro Valley and enjoys a great prestige among the group of Spanish, European and International universities it has relations with. Academic staff at the University of Zaragoza are highly specialised and have a broad research and teaching experience. Be it Spanish as a Foreign Language or fields as interesting to international students as Spanish Literature, Geography, Archaeology, Cinema, History, Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI Research Group) or Nanotechnologies (among many others), the combination of teaching and research is proving very successful. The University, with a total of about 40.000 students, is composed by a teaching staff of about 3.000 with different positions and an administrative and technical staff of about 2.000. It is distributed in campuses located in Zaragoza, Huesca and Teruel. Campus The University of Zaragoza campuses are located in the autonomous Community of Aragon in Spain. The community is made up of three provinces: Zaragoza, Huesca, and Teruel. The original campus resides in Zaragoza, the capital of Aragon, but additional campuses were created in both Huesca and Teruel in 1985. =Zaragoza= The Zaragoza campus is divided into five different locations throughout the city. Campus Plaza San Francisco is the largest of the five locations and is home to a majority of the university colleges and departments in Zaragoza. The other four locations, Campus Rio Ebro, Escuela Universitaria de Turismo, Plaza de Basilio and Facultad de Veterinaria host only one to two colleges each. The Paraninfo building, located on the San Francisco campus, is one of the most valuable and significant buildings owned by the entire university. Originally inaugurated in 1893, the building was scheduled for restoration in 2006. The project inauguration was attended by the King of Spain, the president of the Government of Aragon and other important figures. The restoration architects, Luis Franco and Mariano Pem√°n, made great efforts to maintain the architectural heritage of the building while adding new functionality. At the front of the building sits four large stone statues of notable scientists and doctors that had connections to the university. On display are Andr√©s Piquer, Miguel Servet, Ignacio Jord√°n de Asso and Fausto Elhuyar. Today, the Paraninfo is, as the name suggests, a functional auditorium as well as the University of Zaragoza Library(Main Library). =Huesca= Huesca is located roughly 75 kilometers northeast of Zaragoza. The Huesca location has a number of colleges including the Polytechnic School, Faculty of Health and Sport Science, Faculty of Humanities and Education, and Faculty of Business and Public Management. Also, the affiliated School of Nursing of San Jorge hospital is located in Huesca. =Teruel= Teruel is located roughly 170 kilometers south of Zaragoza. The Teruel campus is home to the technical college where you will find computer engineering and similar programs. It is also the location of the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences and the affiliated School of Nursing of the Obispo Polanco hospital. Academics At the University of Zaragoza, the old traditional studies are offered at ‚ÄúFaculties‚Äù (Facultades), e.g. ‚ÄúFacultad de Derecho‚Äù (Faculty of Law), while new more technical studies are offered at ‚ÄúSchools‚Äù (Escuelas) e.g. ‚ÄúEscuela Universitaria de Ingenier√≠a T√©cnica‚Äù (University School for Technical Engineering) or ‚ÄúPolytechnics‚Äù (Polit√©cnicos), e.g. ‚ÄúCentro Polit√©cnico Superior‚Äù (Higher Polytechnic Centre). =Courses in Spanish as a Foreign Language= Courses in Spanish as a Foreign Language are run throughout the year and vary between 90 and 570 hours. The University offers all levels and some specialised courses. Courses along the academic term are offered in Zaragoza, while the Summer Courses are offered in Jaca ‚Äì The Pyrenees. The University of Zaragoza was the first Spanish university to offer Spanish Courses for international students in 1927. =Research Centers= The University of Zaragoza covers a wide spectrum of knowledge organized within the areas of Engineering and Technology, Experimental Sciences, Health Sciences, Social and Juridical Sciences and Humanities. In 2010, the University of Zaragoza had 6 research institutes, 1 affiliated research institute, 5 joint research institutes and 3 research centers. At this time, the annual figure allocated by the University of Zaragoza to research and development was ‚Ç¨60 million. By 2011, the university had an estimated 3,803 researchers and 8,305 partnering companies.\\"Libro informativo Zaragoza\\" Immunotherapy Cancer Research in Aragon The University of Zaragoza is one of the world leaders in immunotherapy cancer research.

It was founded in 1925 and formed as part of the movement for progressive education. Unlike many HMC member schools, it has been coeducational and took both day and boarding pupils since its foundation. Foundation and location The school was founded by Edith Douglas-Hamilton and established under joint headmistresses, Beatrice Ensor and Isabel King. It became firmly established under the headmastership of Paul Roberts (1928‚Äì1949) and was recognised as efficient by the Ministry of Education in 1935. Based at a mock-Tudor mansion, built by the brewer Charles Charrington in 1902, and in its estate, the school is on a hill from the centre of Farnham but is actually in the village of Frensham. Its grounds run into Rowledge. The headmaster The current head is Rick Clarke, who replaced the previous head, Andrew Fisher, in 2019. Prior to becoming headmaster of Frensham Heights, Clarke was deputy head at Warminster. Ethos Frensham Heights is often seen as a liberal school. There are no mandatory school uniforms and the dress code is broad. The school's motto, We are all members one of another, was adopted by Paul Roberts who was headmaster of Frensham Heights from 1928 to 1949. The school's ethos revolves around the idea of mutual respect between teachers and pupils and as such, staff are referred to by their first name by pupils. The idea of individuality is also encouraged so that an individual's talents and personality are developed. Because of the belief in the importance of the individual, Frensham Heights has a very active Sixth Form Committee and School Council which play an active part in the running of the school. While Houses do exist (Ensor, Douglas, Nevill and King) alongside termly sporting events, there is little competition between the Houses for House Points and prizes. The school encourages fair and just competitions so therefore has a sports day. Instead of a means to encourage competition and as a divisive force, the role of Houses at Frensham is to act as a socialising force once a term as each year group (7‚Äì8, 9‚Äì10, 11‚Äì13) plays a variety of House matches in a sport (football, basketball, netball or hockey). In the summer term there is a 'Sports day' in which the houses compete against each other. Aside from these events, however, houses have little impact on school life. Facilities The school now has a fully functioning music centre including the Sixth Form Centre. The Aldridge Theatre is the Frensham venue for drama activities, with external theatre companies sometimes performing there. The school also has a Photography Suite, Sports Hall, Dance Studio and 'Outdoor Education' facilities. It also has a sixth form centre for both day and boarding students, it is slightly separated from the rest of the school in order for the school to compete with other colleges. Sport Despite being a somewhat small school, Frensham Heights hosts several sports teams in various fields of sport and played at all age ranges. These include common sports such as Rugby, football, hockey, basketball, netball and cricket. Taking part in sport each week is compulsory until year 13 when students can opt to use the time usually allocated to sport for extra revision and study, although this is only allowed if a student attends a sport ECA. Although not being renowned for its sport, the under 16 boys' football team has reached the quarter final of the ISFA cup, a national trophy for small independent schools. Between year 7 and year 11, there are two sessions of sport each week, while only one for the sixth form. From year 11 upwards, students can choose which sport to do each term with options being basketball, football, table tennis, hockey and golf, as well as swimming, tennis and rounders during the summer. Prior to year 11, students partake in sports including rugby, basketball, hockey and football and athletics, rounders and swimming in the summer term but have no choice in which the activity occurs. =Outdoor education= As a subsidiary to sport, outdoor education (or simply 'outdoor-ed') is compulsory for all students between year 7 and year 11. Different from sport in that it does not stress athletic qualities, instead it encourages teamwork, co-operation, individual courage and leadership, ideals which reflect the school's ethos. Outdoor ed typically involves team-building activities in the woods including activities such as climbing 'Jacob's Ladder' and a high ropes challenge near the Sports Hall. The school runs regular Outdoor Education trips to places such as a climbing trip to Dartmoor and to Harrison's Rocks in Kent. The school also runs the Duke of Edinburgh award at all levels. The school has recently introduced weekly Forest Schools sessions for all pupils in the First School; Nursery to Year Three.

Talented as a child, at about thirteen he became a student of Tokyo's then-leading print maker, Utagawa Kunisada. His deep appreciation and knowledge of kabuki drama led to his production primarily of ukiyo-e actor- prints, which are woodblock prints of kabuki actors and scenes from popular plays of the time. An alcoholic and womanizer, Kunichika also portrayed women deemed beautiful (bijinga), contemporary social life, and a few landscapes and historical scenes. He worked successfully in the Edo period, and carried those traditions into the Meiji period. To his contemporaries and now to some modern art historians, this has been seen as a significant achievement during a transitional period of great social and political change in Japan's history.Newland, pp. 7‚Äì16 Early life and education Attributed to Adolfo Farsari (1841‚Äì1898): A handcolored albumen photograph of Kyobashi as it looked in the 19th century.The artist who became known as Toyohara Kunichika was born ≈åshima Yasohachi on June 30, 1835, in the Ky≈çbashi district, a merchant and artisan area of Edo (present-day Tokyo). His father, ≈åshima Kyuj≈´, was the proprietor of a sent≈ç (public bathhouse), the ≈åsh≈´ya. An indifferent family man, and poor businessman, he lost the bathhouse sometime in Yasohachi's childhood. The boy's mother, Arakawa Oyae, was the daughter of a teahouse proprietor. At that time, commoners of a certain social standing could ask permission to alter the family name (my≈çji gomen). To distance themselves from the father's failure, the family took the mother's surname, and the boy became Arakawa Yasohachi.Newland p 7 Little is known about his childhood except that, as a youth, Yasohachi earned a reputation as a prankster and drew complaints from his neighbors, and that at nine he was involved in a fight at the Sanno Festival in Asakusa .Hinkel, p 70 At age ten he was apprenticed to a thread and yarn store. However, because he preferred painting and sketching to learning the dry goods trade, at eleven he moved to a shop near his father's bathhouse. There he helped in the design of Japanese lampshades called andon, consisting of a wooden frame with a paper cover.Hinkel, p 74 When he was twelve, his older brother, Ch≈çkichi, opened a raised picture shop, and Yasohachi drew illustrations for him. It is believed that around age twelve Yasohachi began to study with Toyohara (Ichi≈çsai) Chikanobu (not to be confused with Kunichika‚Äôs student Toyohara Chikanobu). At the same time he designed actor portraits for battledores sold by a shop called Meirindo. His teacher gave him the name \\"Kazunobu\\". It may have been on the recommendation of Chikanobu that the boy was accepted the following year as an apprentice in the studio of Utagawa Kunisada,Newland, pp 7-8 the leading and most prolific print maker of the mid-19th century. By 1854 the young artist had made his first confirmed signed printNewland p 11 and had taken the name \\"Kunichika\\", a composite of the names of this two teachers, Kunisada and Chikanobu.Newland p 12 His early work was derivative of the Utagawa style and some of his prints were outright copies (an accepted practice of the time).Newland, pp 17-22 While working in Kunisada's studio Kunichika was assigned a commission to make a print illustrating a bird's-eye view of Tenjinbashi Avenue following the terrible earthquake of 1855 that destroyed most of the city. This assignment suggests that he was considered one of Kunisada's better students. Toyohara Kunichika: Memorial Portrait of Kunisada (1865) The \\"prankster\\" artist got into trouble in 1862 when, in response to a commission for a print illustrating a fight at a theater, he made a \\"parody print\\" (mitate-e) which angered the students who had been involved in the fracas. They ransacked Kunichika's house and tried to enter Kunisada's studio by force. His mentor revoked Kunichika's right to use the name he had been given but relented later that year. Decades afterwards Kunichika described himself as greatly \\"humbled\\" by the experience. Kunichika's status continued to rise and he was commissioned to create several portraits of his teacher. When Kunisada died in 1865, his student was commissioned to design two memorial portraits. The right panel of the portrait contains an obituary written by the writer, Kanagaki Robun, while the left contains memorial poems written by the three top students, including Kunichika. Artist on the cusp of a new era Toyohara Kunichika: Beautiful woman in the court of Prince Genji (1865) At the time Kunichika began his serious studies the late Edo period, an extension of traditions based on a feudal society, was about to end. The \\"modern\\" Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), a time of rapid modernization, industrialization, and extensive contact with the West, was in stark contrast to what had come before. Ukiyo-e artists had traditionally illustrated urban life and society ‚Äì especially the theater, for which their prints often served as advertising. The Meiji period brought competition from the new technologies of photography and photoengraving, effectively destroying the careers of most.Newland, p 8 As Kunichika matured his reputation as a master of design and of drama grew steadily. In guides rating ukiyo-e artists his name appeared in the top ten in 1865, 1867, and 1885, when he was in eighth, fifth, and fourth place, respectively. In 1867, one year before the collapse of the Tokugawa Shogunate, he received an official commission by the government to contribute ten pictures to the 1867 World Exhibition in Paris.Newland, pp 17, 35 He also had a print at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.Hinkel, p 77 Triptych by Toyohara Kunichika: Onoe Kikugor≈ç V as Akashi no Naruz≈ç in the play Shima Chidori Tsuki no Shiranami (1890) Kunichika often portrayed beautiful women (bijinga), but his finest works are considered to have been bust, half- and three-quarter length, and close-up or \\"large-head\\" portraits of actors, and triptychs that presented \\"wide-screen\\" views of plays and popular stories.Newland, pp 21, 22, 28 Although Kunichika's Meiji-era works remained rooted in the traditions of his teachers, he made an effort to incorporate references to modern technology. In 1869 he did a series jointly with Yoshitoshi, a more \\"modern\\" artist in the sense that he depicted faces realistically.Newland, p 23 In addition, Kunichika experimented with \\"Western\\" vanishing point perspective. Toyohara Kunichika: Spring outing in a villa (c. 1862). Illustrates the artist's use of vanishing point perspective. The press affirmed that Kunichika's success continued into the Meiji era. In July 1874, the magazine Shinbun hentai said that: \\"Color woodcuts are one of the specialties of Tokyo, and that Ky√¥sai, Yoshitoshi, Yoshiiku, Kunichika, and Gink√¥ are the experts in this area.\\" In September 1874 The same journal held that: \\"The masters of Ukiyoe: Yoshiiku, Kunichika and Yoshitoshi. They are the most popular Ukiyo-e artists.\\" In 1890, the book T√¥ky√¥ meish√¥ doku annai (Famous Views of Tokyo), under the heading of woodblock artist, gave as examples Kunichika, Kunisada, Yoshiiku, and Yoshitoshi. In November 1890 a reporter for the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun wrote about the specializations of artists of the Utagawa school: \\"Yoshitoshi was the specialist for warrior prints, Kunichika the woodblock artist known for portraits of actors, and Chikanobu for court ladies.\\" Hinkel, p 78 Contemporary observers noted Kunichika's skillful use of color in his actor prints, but he was also criticized for his choices. Unlike most artists of the period, he made use of strong reds and dark purples, often as background colors, rather than the softer colors that had previously been used. These new colors were made of aniline dyes imported in the Meiji period from Germany. (For the Japanese the color red meant progress and enlightenment in the new era of Western-style progress.)Newland, p 19 Toyohara Kunichika: Kawarazaki Gonnosuke as Daroku (c. 1869). Illustrates \\"big head\\" portraiture and use of strong aniline reds and purples. Deep red make-up indicates anger, obstinacy, indignation, forcefulness. Like most artists of his era and genre,Faulkner pp 32, 34, 35 Kunichika created many series of prints, including: Yoshiwara beauties compared with thirty-six poems; Thirty-two fashionable physiognomies; Sixteen Musashi parodying modern customs; Thirty-six good and evil beauties; Thirty- six modern restaurants; Mirror of the flowering of manners and customs; Fifty- four modern feelings matched with chapters of The Tale of Genji; Scenes of the twenty-four hours parodied; Actors in theatrical hits as great heroes in robber plays; Eight views of bandits parodied. Toyohara Kunichika: Toyokawa ‚Äî The Scenic Places of Tokaido (1863) In 1863 Kunichika was one of a number of artists who contributed landscape prints to two series of famous Tokaido scenes commissioned to commemorate the journey made by the sh≈çgun Iemochi from Edo to Kyoto to pay his respects to the emperor. Otherwise, his landscapes were primarily theater sets, or backgrounds for groups of beauties enjoying the out-of-doors. He recorded some popular myths and tales, but rarely illustrated battles. When portraying people he only occasionally showed figures wearing Western dress, despite its growing popularity in Japan. He is known to have done some shunga (erotic art) prints but attribution can be difficult as, like most artists of the time, he did not always sign them. Kunichika had many students but few attained recognition as print artists. In the changing art scene they could not support themselves designing woodblock prints, but had to make illustrations for such popular media as books, magazines and newspapers. His best-known students were Toyohara Chikanobu and Morikawa Chikashige. Both initially followed their master's interest in theater, but later Chikanobu more enthusiastically portrayed women's fashions, and Chikashige did illustrations. Neither is considered by critics to have achieved his master's high reputation.Newland, p 30 Kunichika had one female student, Toyohara Chikayoshi, who reportedly became his partner in his later years. Her work reflected the Utagawa style. She competently depicted actors, and the manners and customs of the day.Newland, pp 30-31 Personal life As a young man, Kunichika had a reputation for a beautiful singing voice and as a fine dancer. He is known to have used these talents in amateur burlesque shows.Hinkel, p 71 In 1861 Kunichika married his first wife, Ohana, and in that same year had a daughter, Hana. The marriage is thought not to have lasted long, as he was a womanizer. He fathered two out-of-wedlock children, a girl and a boy, with whom he had no contact, but he does appear to have remained strongly attached to Hana.Newland, p 14 Toyohara Kunichika: Preparatory drawing for a shunga print. (British Museum) Kunichika was described as having an open, friendly and sincere personality. He enjoyed partying with the geishas and prostitutes of the Yoshiwara district, while consuming abundant amounts of alcohol. His greatest passion, however, was said to be the theater, where he was a backstage regular. His appearance said to be shabby. He was constantly in debt and often borrowed money from the kabuki actors he depicted so admiringly.Newland, pp 14-16 A contemporary said of him: \\"Print designing, theater and drinking were his life and for him that was enough.\\" A contemporary actor, Matsusuke IV, said that when visiting actors backstage for the purpose of sketching them, Kunichika would not socialize but would concentrate intensely on his work.Newland, p 15 Around 1897, his older brother opened the Arakawa Photo shop, and Kunichika worked in the store. Because Kunichika had a dislike for both the store and photography, only one photograph of him exists.Hinkel p 72 In October 1898 Kunichika was interviewed for a series of four articles about him, The Meiji-period child of Edo, which appeared in the Tokyo newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun. In the introduction to the series, the reporter wrote: > ...his house is located on the (north) side of Higashi Kumagaya-Inari. > Although his residence is just a partitioned tenement house, it has an > elegant, latticed door, a nameplate and letterbox. Inside, the entry...leads > to a room with worn tatami mats upon which a long hibachi has been placed. > The space is also adorned with a Buddhist altar. A cluttered desk stands at > the back of the miserable two-tatami room; it is hard to believe that the > well-known artist Kunichika lives here...Looking around with a piercing gaze > and stroking his long white beard, Kunichika talks about the height of > prosperity of the Edokko... During the interview, Kunichika claimed to have moved 107 times, but it seems more likely that he moved only ten times. Toyohara Kunichika: Kogiku in Saruwaka-Cho (c. 1878) Kunichika died at his home in Honjo (an eastern suburb of Edo) on July 1, 1900 at the age of 65, due to a combination of poor health and bouts of heavy drinking brought on by the death at 39 of his daughter Hana while giving birth to his grandson, Yoshido Ito, some months previously.Hinkel p 72 He was buried at the Shingon Buddhist sect temple of Honryuji in Imado, Asakusa. His grave marker is thought to have been destroyed in a 1923 earthquake, but family members erected a new one in 1974. In old Japan, it had been a common custom for people of high cultural standing to write a poem before death. On Kunichika's grave his poem reads: > \\"Since I am tired of painting portraits of people of this world, I will > paint portraits of the King of hell and the devils.\\" > Yo no naka no, hito no nigao mo akitareba, enma ya oni no > ikiutsushisemu.Newland, p 16  Legacy  In 1915, Arthur Davison Ficke, an Iowa lawyer, poet, and influential collector of Japanese prints, wrote Chats on Japanese Prints. In the book he listed fifty-five artists, including Kunichika, whose work he dismissed as \\"degenerate\\" and as \\"All that meaningless complexity of design, coarseness of color and carelessness of printing that we associate with the final ruin of the art of color prints.\\"Ficke, pp 351‚Äì353 His opinion, which differed from that of Kunichika's contemporaries, influenced American collectors for many years, with the result that Japanese prints produced in the second half of the 19th century, especially figure prints, fell out of favor.Brown, p 13 In the late 1920s and early 1930s an author, adventurer, banker and great collector of Japanese art, Kojima Usui, wrote many articles aimed at resurrecting Kunichika's reputation. He was not successful in his day, but his work became a basis for later research, which did not really begin until quite recently.Newland p 38 In 1876 Laurance P. Roberts wrote in his Dictionary of Japanese Artists that Kunichika produced prints of actors and other subjects in the late Kunisada tradition, reflecting the declining taste of the Japanese and the deterioration of color printing. Roberts described him as, \\"A minor artist, but represents the last of the great ukiyo-e tradition.\\" The cited biography reflects the author's preference for classical ukiyo-e. Richard A. Waldman, owner of The Art of Japan, said of Roberts's view, \\"Articles such as the above and others by early western authors managed to put this artist in the dustbin of art history.\\" An influential reason for Kunichika's return to favor in the western world is the publication, in 1999, in English, of Amy Reigle Newland's Time present and time past: Images of a forgotten master: Toyohara Kunichika 1835‚Äì1900. In addition, the 2008 show at the Brooklyn Museum, Utagawa: Masters of the Japanese Print, 1770‚Äì1900, and a resulting article in The New York Times of 03/22/08 have increased public awareness of and prices for Kunichika prints.

Glide originally built in Shousetown, Pennsylvania in 1862 and purchased by Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on 17 November 1862. She was taken to Cairo, Illinois for fitting out and commissioned on 3 December 1862, Acting Lieutenant Selim E. Woodworth in command. After fitting out, Glide departed on 3 January 1863 for the lower Mississippi River as part of the Mississippi Squadron. She participated in the fierce engagement at Fort Hindman, or Arkansas Post, 11 January as part of the division of light-draft gunboats under the overall command of Lieutenant Commander Watson Smith. As army forces launched the assault, Glide and the other gunboats helped to silence the powerful batteries. She passed the fort under heavy fire and proceeded upstream to cut off possible escape routes for the garrison. After aiding in the important victory at Fort Hindman, helping to open the White River, Glide served briefly there as a gunboat and supply ship until she was sent to Cairo for repairs in early February 1863. While she was repairing there on 7 February 1863, an unexplained fire broke out forward and within a few minutes the tinclad was entirely destroyed.

It is of the half- open, planner type and is a \\"thinly disguised variant of Sir Tommy,\\" but with modifications and with the waste piles placed at the corners of the foundations, hence the name.\\"Puss in Corner\\" (p.69) in The Little Book of Solitaire, Running Press, 2002. It has the rare feature that the suits are built up in colour, not in suit.  Rules The following rules conform to Parlett (1979) and Morehead (2001), except where stated. Set-up: First, the four aces are separated from the rest of the pack and placed side by side in two rows of two, forming a square. These are the foundations and the aim is to build on them in one colour and in sequence up to the kings. So diamonds and hearts may be built on one another, indiscriminately, and likewise, spades and clubs. Game-play: The player first turns the top card of the stock and determines if it can be built on the foundations; if not it is moved to start one of up to four wastepiles. Subsequently a card may be played from the stock to the foundations (but only if it is the same colour and next in sequence) or to any of the wastepiles. Equally a card may be moved from the top of a wastepile to a foundation if it is the same colour and the next in sequence. Only one card may be moved at a time. To reflect the name of the game, each wastepile is placed with its longer edge lying diagonally against a corner of the square forming the foundations. Redeal: After the stock is exhausted, the player may have one redeal. To do this, the player must pick up the four wastepiles in any order, and without shuffling, restart the process. The game ends when this second stock is used up. The game is won when all the cards have been played to the foundations.  Cultural References  In the 1937 film The Prisoner of Zenda, Rupert of Hentzau, played by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. mentions the game while engaged in a sword fight with the hero, played by Ronald Colman.

Their ground was Kingsthorpe Mill. They played in the United Counties League Division One. History Northampton Spencer FC was founded in 1936 as Spencer School Old Boys, from members of the old school team. In 1968, the club joined the United Counties League, and immediately earned promotion after finishing as runners-up. After starting their UCL life at Dallington Park, the club moved to Duston High School for two years before arriving at its current home at Kingsthorpe Mill in 1971. Spencer was relegated in 1981 and twelve months later finished at the foot of Division One. Fortunes were transformed by the arrival of ex-Northampton Town boss John Petts as manager and he led the Millers back to the Premier Division in 1985. Since then, Spencer has been one of the stronger sides in the league, rarely finishing out of the top ten, and winning the championship in 1991‚Äì92 with 101 points. At the end of the 2011/12, Spencer requested demotion after revenue streams dried up. The club spent three season in Division One under the management of Ben Stone, before regaining their Premier Division status for the 2015/16 season On 4 April 2015 Spencer successfully secured promotion back to the Premier Division with a convincing 3-1 away win at Olney. This was followed by 2-0 victory over local rivals ON Chenecks on 6 April sealing the UCL Division 1 title with 3 games to spare. 2015/16 was Spencer's last season because their chairman retired.

Ionescu; ‚Äì 15 March 1940) was a Romanian philosopher, logician, mathematician, professor, and journalist. Near the end of his career, he became known for his antisemitism- reference needed and devotion to far right politics, in the years leading up to World War II. Life Born in BrƒÉila, Ionescu studied Letters at the University of Bucharest until 1912. Upon graduation, he was appointed teacher at the Matei Basarab High School in Bucharest. When World War I began, he traveled to Germany for additional studies at the University of G√∂ttingen. Romania's entry into the war on the Entente side prevented him from returning, but he was awarded a doctorate in philosophy in 1919 from the University of Munich. His thesis was entitled Die Logistik als Versuch einer neuen Begr√ºndung der Mathematik (\\"Formal logic as an attempt at a new foundation of mathematics\\"). Back in Romania, after another brief stint teaching, Ionescu was appointed assistant to Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru at the University of Bucharest's department of Logic and Theory of Knowledge. His life's work had a profound effect on a generation of Romanian thinkers, first for his studies on comparative religion, philosophy, and mysticism, but later for his nationalist and far right sentiment. Some of the figures he influenced include Constantin Noica, Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Haig Acterian, Jeni Acterian, Mihail Sebastian, Mircea VulcƒÉnescu, and Petre »öu»õea. The existentialist and partly mystical school of thought Ionescu introduced bore the name TrƒÉirism. TrƒÉirism intersected at several points with the ideology of the Iron Guard; the connection became even more direct when many of its adherents also publicly associated with the latter. Ionescu himself was more reserved in his dealings with the Guard. He was the editor of the highly influential newspaper Cuv√¢ntul, which had long backed King Carol II ‚Äì the major rival of the Guard. However, Ionescu moved away from the monarchy due to Carol's inner circle. Ionescu's antisemitism was a decisive factor in his switching of allegiances: Jewish writer Mihail Sebastian's Journal depicts the interval during which Ionescu's virulence grew, as well as the reasons that were animating his large following. =Mihail Sebastian incident= During the period when Sebastian and Ionescu were still on speaking terms, the latter had agreed to write the preface of Sebastian's book De douƒÉ mii de ani... (\\"It's been two thousand years...\\"). Ionescu's introduction shocked Sebastian, who \\"loved and admired Ionescu\\",Eliade, Mircea. Mircea Eliade. 1990, page 283. as it included several overtly antisemitic statements. Mircea Eliade recalls the incident in his autobiography: > \\"Judah suffers because it must suffer,\\" Nae had written. And he explained > why: the Jews had refused to acknowledge Jesus Christ as their Messiah. This > suffering in history reflected, in a certain sense, the destiny of the > Hebrew people who, precisely because they had rejected Christianity, could > not be saved. Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus.Eliade, Mircea. Mircea Eliade. > 1990, page 285. Eliade notes that this incident marked a profound departure for Ionescu, who in the late 1920s had suggested to Eliade, who was then his student, that he had been tempted \\"to give up both journalism and politics and devote myself entirely to Hebraic studies\\". Sebastian, though dejected by the incident, opted to keep Ionescu's introduction in the book. =Later life= After Carol's crackdown on the Iron Guard, Nae Ionescu and his disciples were rounded up and imprisoned at a makeshift camp in Miercurea-Ciuc. The experience took a toll on his fragile health, and he died soon thereafter. Some close sources indicated that he was assassinated by poisoning due to his involvement with the Iron Guard.Sebastian y el mentor diab√≥lico, by Ignacio Vidal-Folch. El Pa√≠s, 7 November 2009 . =Nae Ionescu's villa in BƒÉneasa= BƒÉneasa Nae Ionescu was the owner of a luxury villa in BƒÉneasa village (now BƒÉneasa neighborhood, in the northern part of Bucharest), situated at 4th, Ion Ionescu de la Brad Avenue (position ). It was considered one of the finest Bucharest residences at the time. The house remained in collective memory mainly because it is described in his students' writings (Mircea VulcƒÉnescu and others). The house was built by architect George Matei Cantacuzino, under its owner's direct supervision. In his book \\"Nae Ionescu a»ôa cum l-am cunoscut\\" (\\"Nae Ionescu As I Knew Him\\"), VulcƒÉnescu dedicates many pages in describing this house, in detail. He evokes the fact that a painting of El Greco was displayed there (a Descent from the Cross), on which Ionescu took great pride. Nae Ionescu died in this very house, because of a heart attack, on 15 March 1940, while his girlfriend Cella Delavrancea was present. After his death, the house served as an official residence to Marshall Ion Antonescu (sometime after his rise in power on 6 September 1940). After the Communist regime was installed, the villa was given to the University of Agronomic Sciences (since the land of \\"Ferma RegalƒÉ BƒÉneasa\\" (BƒÉneasa Royal Farm) lies around the building). Today, it is the headquarter of \\"Sta»õiunea de Cercetare- Dezvoltare pentru PomiculturƒÉ BƒÉneasa\\" (statiuneabaneasa.ro), a research facility for pomology.

The play in the . They were FA Vase semi-finalists in 1994‚Äì95. History Raunds Town was founded in 1946. There had been other teams with \\"Raunds\\" in the title as long ago as 1896‚Äì97, but at a meeting in the town's Temperance Hall in May 1946 a new amalgamated club was formed. The club is nicknamed \\"The Shopmates\\" in reference to the local boot and shoe industry, which was largely workshop-based. In 1950 the Shopmates joined the United Counties League (formerly the Northamptonshire League), playing in the Second Division. They did not set the league on fire, and after switching between the divisions settled in Division One after the former first division was redesignated the Premier Division. A season in Division Two in 1979‚Äì80 seemed to wake them up: after the division was disbanded at the end of that season, the Shopmates returned to Division One and were promoted as champions in 1982‚Äì83. Kiln Park, home of Raunds Town Raunds Town embarked upon an ambitious programme. Having played at Greenhouse Field for two years at the start, they moved to The Berristers for thirty-three seasons and in 1991 they moved to Kiln Park. The stadium adjacent to the A45 was designed to host football at a higher level. The Shopmates' on-field performance matched this munificence. In 1992‚Äì93 they won at Northwich Victoria 2‚Äì0 to eliminate their hosts from the FA Cup in the Second Qualifying Round, thus far the only time a UCL club has eliminated Conference opposition from the competition. In 1994‚Äì95 the Shopmates lost the FA Vase semi-final against Arlesey Town having led 3‚Äì0 after the first (home) leg. The following season they were eliminated in the quarter-final by Bristol club Mangotsfield United. In 2006‚Äì07 the Shopmates eliminated Isthmian League side Enfield from the FA Cup by way of a 2‚Äì1 away win, gaining revenge for a reverse in the same competition at their hands eight seasons before. Meanwhile, in the United Counties League, the leadership of manager Keith Burt led an assault on the top of the table. Having lost out on the championship on goal difference in 1994‚Äì95, Raunds seized the title the following season. They were duly promoted to the Southern League, where they took their place in the Midland Division. However, they suffered from their geographical location close to the boundary between the divisions and in 1998‚Äì99, the Shopmates were shifted to the Southern Division, which was renamed the Eastern Division the following season. This had financial implications, not least the cost of travelling, and for two seasons Raunds Town struggled. Manager Keith Burt resigned, and the club had little option but to apply for re-admission to the United Counties League at the end of 1999‚Äì2000. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, Raunds Town are playing in the United Counties Football League Division One, led by manager Stuart Brown. 2013-14 saw the arrival of co-managers James Le Masurier and Scott Manning Honours *United Counties League Premier DivisionRaunds Town at the Football Club History Database Runners-up 1991‚Äì92, 1994‚Äì95 *United Counties League Division One Champions 1982‚Äì83 Records *FA Cup Fourth Qualifying Round 1998‚Äì99 *FA Trophy Third Round 1998‚Äì99 *FA Vase Semi-finals 1994‚Äì95 References External links * Football clubs in England Football clubs in Northamptonshire Association football clubs established in 1946 United Counties League Southern Football League clubs 1946 establishments in England Raunds ","title":"Raunds Town F.C."},{"id":"3818200","text":"Ludvig \\"Ludde\\" Strigeus (born January 1981) is a Swedish programmer, best known for developing software such as the BitTorrent client ŒºTorrent, OpenTTD, and Spotify.

Samskar also took up the programme for the eradication of the Jogini system, which is a remnant of the Devadasi in Telangana region of AP. It is a heinous practice thrust on the poor untouchable women in the remote villages of the erstwhile Hyderabad State. Chelli Nilayam, Sister's Home, was founded at Varni, in Nizamabad District in 1987 for the Jogins. All three organisations have their headquarters at Atheist Centre, Vijayawada. University and research centre On 26 September 2011, the Atheist Centre announced that it would open a university and research centre founded on the principles of Gora that would serve as India's first atheist university. It will not be affiliated with any conventional institution. Atheist Centre has a library, with a good collection of books by Gora and his articles on atheism, still primary sources research on atheism, humanism and Gandhian philosophy. Books and publications The Atheist, an (English-language monthly magazine, was established in 1969. It carries articles on atheism, humanism, spirit of inquiry, and scientific reform through secular social work. Nasthika Margam, a Telugu-language monthly, has been published since 1977. It deals with atheism, rationalism, and women's issues.

The club are currently members of the . Founded in 1879 and known as \\"The Saints\\", St Neots Town play their home matches at Rowley Park stadium. The club have played in a number of local leagues, starting off in the Biggleswade & District League before moving first to the South Midlands League in 1927, then the United Counties League in 1936 and finally the Southern Football League in 2011. The club has enjoyed success since promotion in 2011, clinching the Division One Central League title at the first attempt, before adding the Southern Football League Cup to their honours list in 2014. History St Neots Town was formed in 1879 when it was known as plain 'St Neots'. The club clinched its first honour when it became inaugural winners of the Huntingdonshire Senior Cup in 1888‚Äì89.Blakeman, M (2010) The Official History of the Eastern Counties Football League 1935‚Äì2010, Volume II They went on to win the cup another four times before the turn of the century in 1892‚Äì93, 1894‚Äì95, 1895‚Äì96 and 1896‚Äì97. In the 1901/02 season the Club recorded its first known ‚Äòdouble‚Äô when it won the Hunts Senior Cup, for the sixth time, and the Fellowes Cup. During this period they played in the Biggleswade & District League. For the 1924‚Äì25 season the club was renamed St Neots & District and celebrated by winning the Hunts Senior Cup again. By 1927 they had joined the Bedfordshire & District League, which later became the South Midlands League in 1929. The South Midlands League title was clinched in 1932‚Äì33. Progression came in 1936 with entry to the United Counties League, however, after World War II they rejoined the South Midlands League, before becoming founder members of the Metropolitan League in 1949. They won the league and league cup double in its first season, but returned to the UCL in 1951. In 1956 they switched leagues again, joining Division One South of the Central Alliance. The following year the club was renamed for the third time to its present name St Neots Town F.C. In 1960 they returned to the Metropolitan League and won the Professional Cup in 1964‚Äì65. In 1966‚Äì67 St Neots enjoyed their best run to date in the FA Cup reaching the first round proper, where they were beaten 2‚Äì0 away at Walsall. They went on to win the United Counties League and League Cup double in 1967‚Äì68 after rejoining the season earlier. The following season they retained the league cup and also won the Huntingdonshire Senior Cup for the twelfth consecutive season, a record for senior cups in England. In 1969 the club transferred to the Eastern Counties League because it was felt it would be a stronger league, but returned for a fourth spell in the UCL Premier Division in 1973. They were relegated at the end of the 1981‚Äì82 season after eight years of moderate success, but made an immediate return the following season after finishing as runners-up in Division One. During the 1987‚Äì88 season the owner of their long term home at Shortsands yard sold it to a housing developer, meaning the club had to finish the season on a sub-standard borrowed works pitch. At the end of the 87‚Äì88 league season just four places from the bottom of the league table the club was forced to disband in order to clear its outstanding debt. Out of football for just two seasons St Neots Town FC was reformed, when, in 1990, John Carroll and Bob Page invested large sums of capital into the club, they joined the Huntingdonshire Junior League, with a pitch at Priory Park, that was rented from the district council. After four consecutive titles and a six- year absence from senior football, they were readmitted to Division One of the UCL in 1994. They won Division One at the first attempt and were promoted to the Premier Division, where they would stay for the next 17 years. The club's ambition to move on was shown with the 2009 addition of former Northern Ireland internationals Steve Lomas and Michael Hughes as a player managerial team, where they were joined by Sylvain Legwinski, formerly of Fulham. Whilst these star names moved on, new manager Dennis Greene was able to bolster his side in late 2010 with the audacious signing of former Aston Villa striker Stefan Moore, fresh from scoring 39 goals for higher-level Halesowen Town.BBC Sport, 1 October 2010 Moore helped fire St Neots to the 2010‚Äì11 UCL Premier Division title, with the club breaking a number of records on the way to promotion to the Division One Central at which they won as champions at the first attempt. However, a series of management changes were to follow. At the start of the 2012‚Äì13 season manager Dennis Greene's position had become \\"untenable\\" leading to his resignation.Dennis Greene's departure from the club Hunts Post, 30 June 2012. He was replaced first by Iain Parr,Iain Parr appointed first team manager Cambridge Evening News, 17 July 2012. before a joint management team of Gary King and Zema Abbey were drafted in from Arlesey Town in November 2013. The new management team led the Saints to victory in the Hunts Senior Cup and the 2013/14 Southern Football League Cup, with victory over Tiverton Town in the final. Poor performances at the beginning of 2014‚Äì15 season, however, saw the Abbey brothers, Nathan and Zema relieved of their duties. Gary King became the sole manager, bringing in Liam George as his assistant and promoting Matthew Spring to player/assistant coach. King resigned in late December 2014, and was replaced by David Batch.http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/batch-appointed-new-saints- manager-36197/ In December 2015, owner and chairman Mike Kearns stepped aside with his stake in the club acquired by the club's managing director, and Kearns' son, Lee.http://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/latest- news/southern-league-step-three/14512/lee-kearns-takes-over-st-neots-town- from-father-mike/ Stadium St Neots originally played on the top part of the town common before moving to the Shortsands ground in the town centre in 1899. The Saints would remain at Shortsands for the next 88 years until they were evicted due to an outstanding debt. After being reformed in 1990 the club played in the Huntingdonshire Junior League and on the communal pitches within Priory Park. In 1993 the club re-entered the United Counties League and moved to a new ground at Rowley Park, with an Arsenal XI providing the opposition for the ground's official opening. It was here they remained until the opening of the new Rowley Park in 2008. The multi-million pound complex which incorporates the stadium, banqueting venue, Club Bar and full size 3G artificial training pitch was funded and constructed by the site developers Gallagher Estates, who were building 1,250 homes on the Loves Farm site, which included the existing football ground.Open for business: St Neots FC‚Äôs new ground Huntingdonshire Post, 16 April 2008 Honours *Southern Football League Division One Central champions 2011‚Äì12 League Cup Winners 2013‚Äì14 *United Counties League Premier Division champions 1967‚Äì68, 2010‚Äì11 Division One champions 1994‚Äì95 League Cup winners 1967‚Äì68, 1968‚Äì69 *Metropolitan League Champions 1949‚Äì50 League Cup winners 1949‚Äì50 Professional Cup winners 1964‚Äì65 *South Midlands League Champions 1932‚Äì33 *Huntingdonshire League Champions 1990‚Äì91, 1991‚Äì92, 1992‚Äì93, 1993‚Äì94 *Huntingdonshire Senior Cup Winners (38): 1888‚Äì89, 1892‚Äì93, 1894‚Äì95, 1895‚Äì96, 1896‚Äì97, 1901‚Äì02, 1924‚Äì25, 1927‚Äì28, 1935‚Äì36, 1936‚Äì37, 1937‚Äì38, 1938‚Äì39, 1953‚Äì54, 1955‚Äì56, 1957‚Äì58, 1958‚Äì59, 1959‚Äì60, 1960‚Äì61, 1961‚Äì62, 1962‚Äì63, 1963‚Äì64, 1964‚Äì65, 1965‚Äì66, 1966‚Äì67, 1967‚Äì68, 1968‚Äì69, 1970‚Äì71, 1971‚Äì72, 1973‚Äì74, 1976‚Äì77, 1977‚Äì78, 1979‚Äì80, 1980‚Äì81, 1997‚Äì98, 2009‚Äì10, 2010‚Äì11, 2012‚Äì13, 2013‚Äì14 *Hinchingbrooke Cup Winners 2011‚Äì2012 *Fellowes Cup Winners 1901‚Äì1902 See also *St Neots Town F.C. players *St Neots Town F.C. managers References External links *Club website Association football clubs established in 1887 United Counties League Eastern Counties Football League Southern Football League clubs Metropolitan League Football clubs in Cambridgeshire 1887 establishments in England Town Football Club Football clubs in England ","title":"St Neots Town F.C."},{"id":"3818232","text":"Aldrans Transmitter was a facility for medium wave broadcasting at Aldrans near Innsbruck in Austria.

Generally, kits are composed of electronic components, a circuit diagram (schematic), assembly instructions and often a printed circuit board (PCB) or another type of prototyping board. There are two types of kit. Some build a single device or system. Other types used for education demonstrate a range of circuits. Theses will include a solderless construction board of some type, such as: * Components mounted in plastic blocks with side contacts, that are held together in a base, e.g. Denshi blocks * Springs on a card board, the springs trap wire leads or component leads, such as Philips EE electronic experiment kits.phillips EE electronic experiment kits These are a cheap and flexible option * Professional type prototyping boards, (breadboards) into which component leads are inserted, following documentation of the \\"kit\\". The first type of kits, those for the construction of a single device, normally use a PCB on which components are soldered. They normally come with extended documentation describing which component goes where into the PCB. For advanced hobby projects, sometimes the kit may only consist of a printed circuit board and assembly instructions, and the purchaser may have to source all the parts independently; or, the vendor may provide hard-to-get or pre-programmed parts while expecting the purchaser to obtain the rest of the components. People primarily purchase electronic kits to have fun and learn how things work. They were once popular as a means to reduce the cost of buying goods, but there is usually no cost saving in buying a kit today. Some electronic kits were assembled to make complete complex devices such as color television sets, oscilloscopes, high-end audio amplifiers, amateur radio equipment, electric organs,C. P. Gilmore, Suddenly Everybody's Soldering: Big Boom in Electronic Kits\\", Popular Science, February 1962 pp. 125ff and even computers such as the Heathkit H-8, and the LNW-80. Many of the early microprocessor computers were sold as either electronic kits or assembled and tested. Heathkit sold millions of electronic kits during its 45-year history. Home assembly of common consumer electronics items no longer provides a cost advantage over commercially manufactured and distributed devices. People still build kits for custom devices and special-purpose electronics for professional and educational use, and as a hobby. Also emerging is a trend to simplify the complexity by providing preprogrammed or modular kits and this is provided by many suppliers online often. The fun and thrill of making your own electronics has shifted in many cases from easy to comprehend application and analog devices to more sophisticated and digital devices. Examples *The Altair 8800, (the first home computer), was also sold as a kit, as were the Sinclair ZX80, Sinclair ZX81 and Acorn Atom computers. *Many S-100 bus system cards were sold only as kits. *Building a Robot kit, most often with a micro controller inside, is now in fashion. *Lectron electronic kits (magnetic modules) *Denshi blocks used by Gakken EX-System A kit-built digital clock using only transistors and diodes to perform all logic. This would make no sense as a factory built product as an integrated circuit would perform all the logic at a fraction of the cost and space.

Developed alongside the more famous Bristol Type 142, which was developed into the Blenheim light bomber, it used the same wing design and employed the same advanced (for the day) design features such as stressed skin, flaps, and retractable undercarriage. The engine it was designed to use never entered production and only a single prototype was manufactured, Design and development Like the better-known Type 142 the Type 143 arose from the unbuilt Bristol Type 135 proposal for a civil twin-engine light transport aircraft. This was a low-wing twin-engined monoplane, seating six people and a crew of two, first sketched out by Frank Barnwell, with the intention of using the smaller of the two engines then being developed by Roy Fedden, the Aquila I. Although the manufacture of a second Aquila was authorised, nothing was done about the construction of an actual airframe.Barnes 1964, p. 257. Meanwhile, in early 1934 Lord Rothermere announced his intention to have 'the fastest civil aircraft in Europe' built for him. Barnwell proposed an aircraft based on the type 135 but using the more powerful Mercury engine in place of the Aquila, and this was accepted by Rothermere, the aircraft being ordered on 26 March 1934 and first flying on 12 April 1935.Barnes 1964, pp. 257‚Äì258. The Type 143 was very similar to the Type 135 design, although the cabin was enlarged to seat eight and some detail changes were made to optimise the use of common components with the Type 142: over 70% of components were shared.Barnes 1964, p. 258. The prototype 143 was accordingly built alongside the Type 142, receiving the civil registration G-ADEK on 22 March 1935 but had to wait until the end of the year before the engines had completed trials. It was first flown on 20 January 1936 without registration but bearing the mark R 14.Barnes 1964, pp. 259‚Äì260. Further flying continued at Filton, mainly as a testbed for the Aquila. It was put into storage when Aquila development was abandoned in 1938 and subsequently scrapped.Barnes 1964, pp. 260‚Äì261.

From its structural form, it would appear to be a possibly Saxon foundation and certainly earlier than the thirteenth-century St Mary's. A rare dedication suggests that a church could have occupied the site in the early seventh century. (Paulinus was an early Christian missionary, and a close contemporary of Augustine who subsequently became Archbishop of York and Bishop of Rochester.) The area was known in the 16th century as Paul Crey. William Camden born in 1551 writes in a 1610 travel guide in a section on Kent: \\"Here the riverlet Crey, anciently called Crecan , intermingleth it selfe with Darent, ? when in his short course he hath imparted his name to five townlets which hee watereth,as Saint Marie Crey, Pauls Crey, Votes-Crey, North Crey,? and Crey-ford in former ages Crecanford, where Hengest the Saxon, the eighth yeare after his arrivall, joyned battaile with the Britans, and after hee had slaine their captaines brought them under with so great a slaughter that afterwards hee never stood in feare of them, but established his kingdome quietly in Kent.\\" Britain, or, a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland by William Camden, 1610 http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/text/chap_page.jsp?t_id=Camden&c;_id=12&p;_id=3354#pn_28 While some development has taken place on the east side of the old village, open country with a belt of woodland extends to the hamlet of Hockenden and the borough boundary.

S & L was the principal steel company exploiting the ironstone in the area, and the major employer in Corby. The club was a leading contender in the United Counties League. In 1948 a rival club, Corby Town was formed in the town. Most of the key S & L personnel joined the new club, leaving a rump which joined the Kettering Amateur League. The club won the Kettering Amateur League championship in 1954, and they joined the United Counties League in 1957. The club's form in the league was indifferent, but they won the Division One championship in 1973‚Äì74 and 1974‚Äì75 and were promoted to the Premier Division for 1975‚Äì76, where they played until relegation at the end of 2013/14 season. The club nearly went under in 1989 before a rescue by local businessman John Georgiou, who changed the name to Hamlet S&L; after his company for three seasons. The club installed floodlights in 1992, which allowed them to enter more competitions, including the FA Cup for the first time since the war. They have also made ground improvements with the assistance of a lottery grant. They reached the second qualifying round of the FA Cup in season 2008‚Äì09, before winning the UCL that year. In July 2011, the club employed Lee Duffy alongside Daren Young as joint managers. Duffy took the role up solely in March 2012, and he resigned from first team manager duties in September 2012, though he was to remain in the club as Football Development manager. He was replaced by former co-manager, Daren Young, who was assistant manager at Corby Town for a short period. For the 2014-2015 season, Barry Britton took over as first team manager.

History The first recorded football in Stotfold occurred in 1904 although it is certain the game was played in the town for a number of years before that. In the early 1900s, Stotfold sides played in the Biggleswade and District League. This was followed by a spell of nearly 30 years in North Herts football. The first record of a trophy being won was 1911 when Potton were beaten 1‚Äì0 in the Biggleswade and District Championship. Stotfold FC was officially founded, with proper financing, stewardship and record-keeping, in 1946. The club played for many years at the Hitchin Road Recreation Ground before moving into the newly-developed Roker Park ground in 1965. This ground was just a meadow named \\"Roker\\" when it was first used by Stotfold Athletic in 1911. In 1951 the club joined the South Midlands League Division Two, finishing 2nd to gain immediate promotion to Division One. They were Division One champions in 1953‚Äì54 and were promoted to the Premier Division, where they remained for thirty years. Stotfold won the South Midlands League Premier Division for the first time in the 1980‚Äì81 season under the management team of Brian Parker, Peter Godden, and Geoff Heard. They were also runners-up seven times. In 1984, the Eagles were transferred to the United Counties League. They were admitted straight into the Premier Division, where they stayed until 2010. Through the 1990s, the club generally finished high in the top ten. After several changes of manager, the club re-appointed former Arsenal man Ian Allinson as manager for 2007‚Äì08, and he rewarded them by leading the club to their most successful season, including the UCL championship for the first time. He subsequently left to join Boreham Wood. The championship was clinched in dramatic fashion; starting the second half 0‚Äì4 down to closest challengers Long Buckby, Stotfold managed to equalise in the 90th minute for the point needed to clinch the title. Stotfold transferred to the Spartan South Midlands League for the 2010‚Äì11 season.

This 2-door sports car used an updated version of the overhead camshaft, crossflow engine, used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 and previously fitted in the MG M-type Midget of 1929 to 1932, driving the rear wheels through a four- speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was from the D-Type with suspension by half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock-absorbers all round with rigid front and rear axles. The car had a wheelbase of and a track of . Most cars were open two-seaters, but a closed salonette version of the J1 was also made, and some chassis were supplied to external coachbuilders. The open cars can be distinguished from the M type by having cut-away tops to the doors. __TOC__ J1 The J1 was the four-seat car in the range. The engine was the 847 cc unit previously seen in the C-type with twin SU carburetors giving 36 bhp. The car cost ¬£220 in open and ¬£225 in Salonette form. J2 The J2, a road-going two-seater, was the commonest car in the range. Early models had cycle wings, which were replaced in 1933 by the full-length type typical of all sports MGs until the 1950s TF. The top speed of a standard car was , but a specially prepared one tested by The Autocar magazine reached . The car cost ¬£199. The most serious of the J2's technical failings is that it has only a two-bearing crankshaft which can break if over-revved. The overhead camshaft is driven by a vertical shaft through bevel gears, which also forms the armature of the dynamo. Thus any oil leak from the cambox seal goes into the dynamo brushgear, presenting a fire hazard. Rather than hydraulic brakes the car has Bowden cables to each drum. Although requiring no more pedal force than any other non-power-assisted drum brake if they are well maintained, the drums themselves are small, and even in-period it was a common modification to replace them with larger drums from later models.

It was then replaced by Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and the area has since been redeveloped. The airport was located at Fornebu in B√¶rum, from the city center. Fornebu had two runways, one 06/24 and one 01/19, and a capacity of 20 aircraft. In 1996, the airport had 170,823 aircraft movements and 10,072,054 passengers. The airport served as a hub for Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), Braathens SAFE and Wider√∏e. In 1996, they and 21 other airlines served 28 international destinations. Due to limited terminal and runway capacity, intercontinental and charter airlines used Gardermoen. The Royal Norwegian Air Force retained offices at Fornebu. The airport opened as a combined sea and land airport, serving both domestic and international destinations. It replaced the land airport at Kjeller and the sea airport at Gressholmen. In 1940, it was taken over by the German Luftwaffe, but civilian air services began again in 1946 and it was then taken over by the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration. The airport at first had three runways, each at , but these were gradually expanded, first the north‚Äìsouth runway and finally the east‚Äìwest one to the current length in 1962. The same year the terminal moved south to the final location. A large- scale expansion to the terminal was made during the 1980s. Facilities Arrival and Departure by Kai Fjell At the time of closing, the airport consisted of a single terminal with three satellites: two domestic and one international. The service building had three stories, one for arrival, one for departure and one for administration. Airplane capacity at the airport was 20 craft;Wisting, 1989: 80 five planes parked at the international terminal could be served with jetbridges, while passengers had to walk outdoors to get to domestic planes. The airport terminals were , of which were for the public.Wisting, 1989: 99 In the main hall of the terminal were two murals made by Kai Fjell, both which have been preserved. The largest was the Arrival and Departure which was completed in 1968 and covered three stories. At the north part of the airport, located where the former main terminal was until 1964, were the offices of the Air Force and Fred. Olsen Airtransport, the main hangar for Braathens SAFE, as well as mechanical facilities for SAS and Fred. Olsen. The fire station and snowplowing facilities were also located there, along with the main radar center. All the terminal buildings built until the early 1960s were still intact until the closing of the airport.Wisting, 1989: 92 In 1989, about 5,500 people worked at Fornebu. Of these, 3,600 worked for the airlines, including ground services. The airport administration had 350 employees, including administration, air control, fire fighters, meteorology and maintenance. The remaining 500 people worked for other public offices, including the police and customs, as well as service employees working for private companies involved with passenger services. Fornebu had two runways: a main east‚Äìwest runway and a secondary north‚Äìsouth. Only the main runway was used under ordinary weather conditions, with the north‚Äìsouth runway only being used if there was strong winds from the north and for general aviation, helicopters and ambulance aircraft.Wisting, 1989: 60 The main runway was equipped with instrument landing system category 1.Bredal, 1998: 176 Under ordinary weather conditions, flights to Fornebu were to, as soon as possible, divert southwards along the Oslo Fjord to avoid noise pollution to residential areas. However, when necessary, a direct approach could be made eastwards from Drammen or westwards from Grefsen√•sen.Wisting, 1989: 94‚Äì97 Until 1996, Oslo Air Traffic Control Center (Oslo ATCC) was located at Fornebu. It had the responsibility to oversee all air traffic in southeastern Norway, bordering to Dovre in the north, almost to Stavanger in the west, halfway to Stockholm to the east and almost to Denmark in the south.Malm√∏, 1997: 94 Since Fornebu is located on a peninsula, all transport to the airport needed to go via Lysaker. A branch from the motorway European Route E18 allowed access to the airport. Lysaker Station is on the Drammen Line, and was served by both local and regional trains, including services to Oslo Central Station. In addition, Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk offered bus transport to the airport from Asker and B√¶rum, including Lysaker. A limited number of services were extended to Snar√∏ya. An airport coach connected the airport to the city center.Wisting, 1989: 90 Airlines and destinations thumbDomestic scheduled services from Fornebu in 1998 Blue = Scandinavian Airlines System Red = Braathens SAFE Green = Wider√∏e Yellow = Other International destinations served from Fornebu In 1996, the airport had 170,823 aircraft movement and 10,072,054 passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country.Malm√∏, 1997: 77 It served as the main hub for Braathens SAFE, one of three main hubs for SAS and as one of many for Wider√∏e. Prior to 1 April 1994, all air transport in Norway was restricted to airlines that had received concession from the ministry. On the primary domestic routes, the traffic was split between SAS and Braathens SAFE, although both had services to Trondheim and Stavanger. SAS had a monopoly to Bergen and Northern Norway (Alta, Bardufoss, Bod√∏, Harstad/Narvik, Kirkenes, Longyearbyen and Troms√∏), while Braathens SAFE had a monopoly to the other primary airports in Southern Norway (Haugesund, Kristiansand, Kristiansund, Molde, R√∏ros and √Ölesund). Wider√∏e had a monopoly on the regional state-supported routes (Br√∏nn√∏ysund, Flor√∏, F√∏rde, Sandane, Sogndal and √òrsta/Volda), and also served Stord and Sandefjord. Following Norway joining the European Economic Area (EEA), the airline industry was deregulated, allowing any airline from any EEA member country to make domestic or international flights to Norway. However, by 1994 there was no available slots at Fornebu during the morning and evening rush hours, limiting the number of new routes that could be established. After the deregulation, Fornebu could not offer slots to new airlines, and SAS and Braathens could not establish as many competing routes as they wanted to.Bredal, 1998: 164‚Äì165 However, domestic services were provided by both SAS and Braathens SAFE to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, Bod√∏, Harstad/Narvik, Troms√∏ and Longyearbyen. The remaining domestic airports were only served by the incumbent. In addition, Teddy Air offered services to Fagernes. International services were provided by 21 airlines to 28 destinations. SAS had international flights to Amsterdam, Brussels, Billund, Copenhagen, D√ºsseldorf, Frankfurt, Helsinki, London-Heathrow, Manchester, Munich, New York, Nice, Paris, Stockholm and Zurich. Braathens SAFE offered international services to Alicante, Billund, London-Gatwick, M√°laga, Newcastle and Stockholm. Lufthansa offered flights to D√ºsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich. Other foreign airlines that provided services to their main hubs included Aeroflot (Moscow-Sheremetyevo), Air France (Paris-Charles de Gaulle), Air Malta (Valletta), TAP Air Portugal (Lisbon), AirUK (London-Stansted), Alitalia (Milan), British Airways (London-Heathrow), Dan-Air (London-Gatwick), Delta Air Lines (New York-JFK), Iberia (Madrid) and (Barcelona), Icelandair (Reykjav√≠k), KLM (Amsterdam), LOT Polish Airlines (Warsaw), Pan Am (New York- JFK) and Sabena (Brussels). History =Background= A DNL Ju 52 at the seaplane base in 1939 Aviation in Oslo started in 1909, when Carl Cederstr√∂m of Sweden made exhibition flights from fields at Etterstad. Following this, the Norwegian Army decided that it needed a military land airport, and established itself at Kjeller, outside Oslo, in 1912. Kjeller Airport served as the main airport for Norway until the 1930s, being the main base of the newly established Norwegian Army Air Service and the first place to have air services.Wisting, 1989: 10‚Äì12 In 1918, the first Norwegian airline, Det Norske Luftfartrederi, was established, and plans were made to start flying to Trondheim. The following year, civil aviation was discussed in the Norwegian Parliament for the first time. Norsk Luftfartsrederi wanted to start seaplane routes from Oslo, and applied to the state to be allowed to lease of the island Lind√∏ya for 99 years. The Oslo Port Authority recommended that the application be denied, since it was already in negotiations with the state to purchase the island and seaplane services would interfere with ship traffic. The ministry recommended a ten-year lease. Sam Eyde, who was a member of parliament, recommended that the state should be responsible for all airports, and suggested a state-owned seaplane airport be built at Gressholmen. However no money was granted for construction of the airport until 1926, when Gressholmen Airport opened.Wisting, 1989: 13‚Äì20 Gressholmen was served by Norsk Luftfartsrederi and Deutsche Luft Hansa.Wisting, 1989: 30 During the late 1920s and early 1930s, the politicians became less satisfied with the solution. Kjeller was considered too far away from the city center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.Wisting, 1989: 20‚Äì22 =Construction= This KLM DC-2 has just become the first aircraft to land at Fornebu after the opening At the time, Fornebu was a mostly unpopulated area. Until 1907, a lumber mill was located at Snar√∏ya on the southern tip. From 1921, Snar√∏ya had received a coach service, and had grown with many single dwellings. About northeast of Fornebu is the town of Lysaker, which had a railway station on the Drammen Line. The committee decided to purchase on the northern part of the peninsula. The Fornebu solution would be more expensive, but would yield a larger airport and better landing conditions. The formal decision to build the airport was taken in 1934.Wisting, 1989: 22‚Äì26 It was the Municipality of Oslo which built the airport, having bought the land from the Municipality of B√¶rum. Construction was to serve as work creation for the unemployed, and workers were selected based on how long they had been unemployed and the number of people in their family. Because the need for workplaces was greatest in the winter, most of the construction was done during the winters of 1935, 1936 and 1937. Not until 1937 was a normal 48-hour week throughout the year introduced. of rock was blasted and, along with garbage from Oslo, used to fill in the swamps and depressions. Because of the delays, plans were changed and three runways were built, two long and one long. The airport was equipped with a control tower; administration building; a hangar with a workshop; and a service building. Docks for seaplanes were constructed about to the south, on the east shore of the peninsula.Wisting, 1989: 26‚Äì33 In 1934, there were three domestic airlines in Norway: Det Norske Luftfartsselskap (DNL), Norske Luftruter and Wider√∏e's Flyveselskap. All three applied to the state for subsidies to operate routes. DNL applied for a ten-year concession with a annual subsidy to fly Oslo‚ÄìKristiansand‚ÄìAmsterdam, continuing northwards to √Ölesund. Wider√∏e applied for NOK 265,000 per year for a three-year concession for the seaplane routes Oslo‚ÄìBergen and Bergen‚ÄìTrondheim. Norske Luftruter applied for NOK 250,000 per year for a route from Bergen to Copenhagen via Kristiansand and Oslo. The following year, parliament passed a long-term plan for construction of airports, which would be located in Oslo, Telemark, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Bergen, √Ölesund and Trondheim. In each case, the municipalities would have to purchase land and build the airport, but the state would reimburse 50% of the investments. Due to the high cost burden on the municipalities, only Stavanger Airport, Sola and Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik were operational by the time Fornebu opened.Wisting, 1989: 31‚Äì35 =Opening and war= Fornebu on 1 July 1939, the day it opened. In the background the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 from DDL that was the first aircraft to take off The first aircraft at Fornebu was a Lufthansa Junkers Ju 52 in September 1938. It had flown a scheduled route to Kjeller, and the captain had continued to Fornebu to try the new airport. On 16 April 1939, the seaplane section came into regular use. The first seaplane was a Ju 52 operated by DNL to Copenhagen. The official opening was on 1 June 1939. The first aircraft to land after the official opening was a Douglas DC-2 operated by KLM from Amsterdam. The first departure was on the Danish airline Det Danske Luftfartsselskab, when a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 took off to Copenhagen. The captain made a mistake, and took off from the parking space instead of the runway. In addition to these two routes, Luft Hansa started flights to Germany and DNL flew to Amsterdam. During the fall, DNL also flew from Perth, Scotland, via Oslo to Stockholm, but this route was soon canceled.Wisting, 1989: 35‚Äì41 Fornebu after the Luftwaffe had taken over the field As part of the invasion of Norway by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940, German Luftwaffe- aircraft landed at Fornebu. There was no attempt by the civilian airport authorities to hinder this, such as driving cars onto the runway, although several German aircraft collided with each other during the landing. A KLM aircraft had a scheduled service that morning, and the captain was ordered to leave the passengers, take the crew and return to Oslo. On 12 April, the airport was bombed by the British Royal Air Force. On 14 April, the KLM captain was granted permission to fly back to Amsterdam with the crew, albeit without any passengers. The German military used Fornebu heavily during the war, but it was never of any strategic importance, since it was located far from any battle zones. During the war, the airport officially remained owned by the municipality. By orders of the German authorities, the main north‚Äìsouth runway was expanded to , and all facilities not yet built were completed. However, during the war all other runways than the main north‚Äìsouth were taken out of use. At the north end of the runway, the Luftwaffe built several hangars and a prison camp. Prisoners were used to keep the runways free of snow during winter, by marching along them and stomping the snow down.Wisting, 1989: 42‚Äì46 In May 1945, as German forces were ousted from Norway, the airport was taken over by the Allies and the Royal Norwegian Air Force. None of the civilian airlines were in operation, and the Air Force started flying commercial flights. In addition to previous lines, a route was started to Northern Norway, although it had to be terminated for the winter. Due to the lack of qualified personnel, the international services had to be terminated as well. In early 1946, management of the airport was transferred back to the municipality. Due to the technological development of aviation during the war, the runway needed to be expanded. The runway was sufficient for Douglas DC-3 aircraft, but insufficient for larger Douglas DC-4s. The latter were all used by American Overseas Airways, DNL on its North America routes and British European Airways on its route to London, which were all transferred to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.Wisting, 1989: 47‚Äì48 =Expansion= On 1 November 1947, Norsk Spisevognselskap established a restaurant at the airport.Just (1949): 72 In 1946, DNL launched plans to expand the north‚Äìsouth runway to by taking into use the whole peninsula. In addition, it wanted a second east‚Äìwest runway to be built. The state took over ownership of the airportwithout compensation in 1946, albeit with the clause that if the airport ever should close, the real estate should be returned to the municipality. Stavanger Airport had been a candidate for intercontinental travel, but a state committee in 1949 decided that instead this should be shared between Fornebu and Gardermoen. Another committee was established in 1948, and in 1950 it recommended that all airport services in the Oslo region should be concentrated at Gardermoen, and that a new motorway be built to the airport. Among politicians and planners, there were two main ideologies: The first, which dominated in political circles, stated that Fornebu's close proximity to the city center was a key to reaching a market in Oslo and for the growth of the airlines. The second emphasized that, in the long run, Fornebu could not fulfill the requirements of a central airport, and that a better location should be established.Wisting, 1989: 48‚Äì49 Following the political processes, the north‚Äìsouth runway was extended to . With the completion of this, intercontinental traffic was moved from Gardermoen to Fornebu. In 1946, Overseas Scandinavian Airlines System had been established between DNL, DDL and the Swedish Aerotransport.Wisting, 1989: 53‚Äì55 The same year, shipowner Ludvig G. Braathen established Braathens South American and Far East (Braathens SAFE), which started with charter flights using DC-4s. The first civilian route was operated by KLM, who started the route Oslo‚ÄìKristiansand‚ÄìAmsterdam in March 1946. From 1 April, DNL operated a route to Copenhagen, followed a week later with the route via Stavanger to London, using DC-3s. The third DNL route was to Stockholm using Ju 52s, and the fourth via Gothenburg and Copenhagen to Zurich and Marseilles. In May, DNL started routes to Trondheim and Troms√∏, and later onwards to Kirkenes. It also started a direct service to Copenhagen. In October, routes were established via Kristiansand to Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris. Finally, a route was started via Copenhagen to Prague and to Stavanger. In 1946, DNL had 47,000 passengers (although not all flew through Fornebu). The company operated six DC-3s and five Ju 52s.Wisting, 1989: 67‚Äì68 In 1947, Icelandair started flights to Reykjav√≠k and the same year British European Airways transferred its London route from Gardermoen to Fornebu.Wisting, 1989: 74 DNL bought three Short Sandringham flying boats which were put into service along the coast as the \\"Flying Coastal Express\\". They remained in service from 1947 until May 1950, but proved expensive in operation.Wisting, 1989: 69‚Äì70 In 1949, Braathens SAFE introduced scheduled flights from Fornebu using DC-3s; it had long-haul flights to the Far East, with stops in Amsterdam, Geneva, Rome, Cairo, Basra, Karachi, Bombay, Calcutta and Bangkok before arriving in Hong Kong.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 45 Following the establishment of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 1949, all international concessions were transferred to that company, and Braathens SAFE started domestic services, although it kept its existing concessions on international routes until 1954.Wisting, 1989: 70‚Äì71 Braathens SAFE's first domestic service was via T√∏nsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to Stavanger, and later a route to Trondheim. These were both operated with Heron aircraft. At first the Trondheim route was flown to Lade, but were quickly transferred to the current airport at V√¶rnes.Wisting, 1989: 71 Loftlei√∞ir started flights to Reykjav√≠k in 1952. The stairs leading up to the second story of the terminal, as seen after the construction of IT Fornebu In 1953, work started with expanding the north‚Äìsouth runway to and building a new east‚Äìwest runway which also was to become . The same year a new commission was established, which in 1957 recommended that the east‚Äìwest runway be expanded to and the north‚Äìsouth runway to . Local residents and politicians were opposed to the expansion plans, and Akershus County Council voted against them. The ministry then chose to expand the east‚Äìwest runway to only and leave the north‚Äìsouth runway untouched. The plans would allow the east‚Äìwest runway to be expanded to in the future, if necessary. The north‚Äìsouth runway had difficult landing conditions, in part because of the residential areas north of the line. From 1959, the ministry denied jet aircraft from using the then longer runway.Wisting, 1989: 53‚Äì58 In the 1950s, SAS started using Convair 440s, while Braathens SAFE took into use Fokker F-27s. Both companies later also took into use Douglas DC-6s.Wisting, 1989: 71‚Äì72 In 1952, SAS started flights to Bod√∏ Airport and in 1955 to Bergen Airport, Flesland. In 1955, Braathens SAFE also started flights to Kristiansand and Farsund Airport, Lista, and the following year to Notodden Airport, Tuven. That year also saw some of its Trondheim flights land at Hamar Airport, and in 1957 at R√∏ros Airport.Tjomsland and Wilsborg, 1995: 105‚Äì106 In 1958, √Ölesund Airport, Vigra was opened and became served by Braathens SAFE.Tjomsland and Wilsborg, 1995: 114 The R√∏ros stops were terminated in 1958, but reinstated in 1963 after the runway had been extended. The Hamar stops were permanently terminated in 1959.Tjomsland and Wilsborg, 1995: 106 In 1960, Finnair started flying to Helsinki, although direct flights were not introduced until 1971. After 1962, the east‚Äìwest runway became the main runway. Along with the runway expansion, a new service building, with a capacity for 2 million passengers, was opened in 1964. It was located about half a kilometer (quarter of a mile) south of the former terminal. Designed by Odd Nansens Arkitektkontor, it had two stories, one for arrivals and one for departures, and two wings, one for domestic and one for international flights. It included a central hall that had a panorama view over the aircraft.Wisting, 1989: 58‚Äì61 The expanded facilities allowed SAS to take into use Sud Aviation Caravelle jets on the Copenhagen routes, although they were also occasionally used to Bod√∏.Wisting, 1989: 72 =Cramped quarters= ICT SMBs. Three Scandinavian Airlines aircraft at Fornebu in 1972; a DC-9-20 in the foreground, a DC-9-40, and a Sud Aviation Caravelle furthest away Three airports were opened in Finnmark in 1963, all served by SAS: Alta Airport, Kirkenes Airport, H√∏ybuktmoen and Lakselv Airport, Banak. The following year, SAS also started flights to Troms√∏ Airport. In 1966, Lufthansa started flights to Hamburg, and later also introduced services to D√ºsseldorf, Frankfurt and Munich. During the 1960s, SAS introduced Caravelles on most of the domestic routes.Wisting, 1989: 74‚Äì76 During the 1970s, Douglas DC-8s were also taken into use. Pan American World Airways had flights to New York City from 1967 to 1973 and from 1976 to 1978. Braathens SAFE started taking delivery of Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s in 1969, and these gradually took over most of the domestic routes.Wisting, 1989: 72‚Äì73 In 1970, Air France and Swissair started flying to Fornebu from Paris and Zurich, respectively. They were supplemented by Aeroflot's Moscow route in 1972.Wisting, 1989: 76 In 1971, a state committee recommended that Gardermoen be expanded to take a larger share of the traffic from Fornebu. At the same time, a new main airport was eventually to be built at Hob√∏l. From 1971, charter flights were moved to Gardermoen, although SAS and Braathens SAFE were granted dispensation so they only needed to serve one Oslo airport.Wisting, 1989: 63‚Äì64 On 1 July 1971, Wider√∏e also started serving domestic routes to Fornebu, with the opening of a regional airport in Sogn og Fjordane. These routes were served using de Havilland Canada Twin Otter and later de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft, although regular services to all airports were not introduced until the late 1970s, with the introduction of the Dash 7.Arnesen, 1984: 117‚Äì119 The last four primary airports were opened during the 1970s. Braathens SAFE started flights to Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget in 1972, Molde Airport, √Ör√∏ in 1972 and Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes in 1973. In 1975, SAS started flights to Haugesund Airport, Karm√∏y.Malm√∏, 1997: 65 During the 1980s, the airport was again deemed too small. In 1983, all charter flights operated by SAS and Braathens were forced to move to Gardermoen.Wisting, 1989: 64‚Äì65 Additional foreign services were introduced, namely Sabena to Brussels in 1985, Dan-Air to London-Gatwick and Newcastle in 1986 and Alitalia to Milan in 1988. During a period of reconstruction at Gardermoen, Trans World Airlines also served Fornebu, and the same year Pan American reintroduced its route to New York. Air Europe also started to fly from London-Gatwick to Fornebu.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 300 An additional storey was added to the service building, allowing office space to be moved there and free up space for check-in and traveler service on the two main storeys. Two satellites were built for the domestic terminal, one each for Braathens SAFE and SAS, allowing increased waiting area for travelers. The international terminal was expanded with a five-gate pier with jetbridges. A multi-story parking house was also built.Wisting, 1989: 80‚Äì83 Norsk Air started serving Fornebu following the opening of Fagernes Airport, Leirin in 1987. The route was closed within a year, but taken up again by Coast Air in 1990. From 1996, the route was taken over by Teddy Air. Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) McDonnell Douglas DC-9 at the international terminal in 1989 In 1989, Braathens SAFE started its first international scheduled service since 1960, from Fornebu to Billund in Denmark. Two years later, the company started flying to Newcastle, after Dan- Air had withdrawn from the route, and to Malm√∂ in Sweden. That year also saw the start of Norway Airlines, who started a base at Fornebu and offered flights to London-Gatwick, as well as to Stockholm, in cooperation with Transwede, and to Copenhagen, in cooperation with Sterling Airlines. In 1992, both Norway Airlines and Dan-Air went bankrupt, and Braathens SAFE started flights to London-Gatwick. It terminated the Malm√∂ route in 1994.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 295‚Äì304 After the deregulation, Braathens SAFE also introduced flights to Alicante, M√°laga, Rome and Stockholm. Wider√∏e introduced international services to Gothenburg and Berlin. In 1994, the domestic and international flights to the European Union were deregulated, and the number of international services increased and Fornebu received airlines such as Air Malta, Air Portugal, AirUK and LOT Polish Airlines. Other airlines to fly from Fornebu during the 1980s and 1990s includes Delta Air Lines, Northwest Orient and Tower Air.Malm√∏, 1997: 25‚Äì26 Domestically, Braathens SAFE introduced flights to Bergen, Bod√∏, Harstad/Narvik and Troms√∏.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 340 =Closing= After the closure, Fornebu has gradually been transformed. Still, many of the buildings from the airport remain During the 1960s, a political debate started concerning whether or not a new main airport should be built for Oslo and Eastern Norway. A government report launched in 1970, suggested surveys for five locations: Gardermoen, Hurum, Askim, Nesodden and √Ös. Hob√∏l was preliminarily selected and areas reserved for a future airport. During the 1970s, the Labour Party became concerned that Hob√∏l was located too centrally in relation to the growth areas around Oslo, and instead wanted to use Gardermoen, in an attempt to force the population growth further north. Commercial interests and the airlines supported Hob√∏l. In 1983, Parliament decided to abandon the plans for Hob√∏l and continue with a divided solution. Fornebu would be expanded, and all charter traffic be moved to Gardermoen. From 1988, all international traffic would also be moved, making Fornebu a purely domestic airport.Bredal, 1998: 17‚Äì20 Increased traffic in the mid-1980s changed the politician's interests, and in 1988 Parliament voted to build a new main airport at Hurum, located on the same side of Oslo as Fornebu, but further away. However, new weather data showed that Hurum was unsuitable, and the location was discarded. There were accusations that the data was fabricated to manipulate the political decision. In 1992, parliament made a final vote that started construction of a new airport at Gardermoen and mandated the closure of Fornebu.Bredal, 1998: 23‚Äì29 Financing of the airport at Gardermoen would be done through a state loan issued to a limited company owned by the Civil Airport Administration. This company would build and operate Gardermoen, but from 1 January 1997 it also took over operation of Fornebu. After the last aircraft took off from Fornebu on 7 October 1998, 300 people spent the night transporting 500 truckloads of equipment from Fornebu to Gardermoen. The new airport opened on the morning of 8 October 1998. Some locals wanted to keep Fornebu as a regional airport for the Oslo and B√¶rum area. The proposal was to keep part of the runway and terminals and allow aircraft such as the Bombardier Dash 8, Fokker 50 and British Aerospace 146 to use the airport. Proponents argued that a similar role was filled by Stockholm-Bromma Airport and Chicago's Midway Airport. The opening of Gardermoen had a strategic impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the deregulation of the market in 1994, the lack of free slots at Fornebu made it impossible to have free competition, since no new airlines could establish themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to happen, and from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle. = Redevelopment = Since closing in 1998, the former airport site has been renovated and redeveloped. The headquarter offices of Telenor (NBBJ architects, 2001), regional and international offices for Equinor (formerly Statoil, a-lab architects (no)), Telenor Arena (HRTB architects, 2009), as well as other office and housing projects. Prior to redevelopment, the airport site was used in the music video for Norwegian artist Hanah's 2001 song \\"Hollywood Lie\\". Several buildings from the former airport have been preserved, including the control tower, the terminal building and two distinctive aircraft hangars. In the western part of the peninsula, a 50m x 20m section of former runway 06/24 has been restored in memory of the airport. In the northwest, the seaplane base \\"Kilen Sj√∏flyklubb\\" is still in operation.

Radon is a significant contributor to environmental radioactivity. Mitigation of radon in the air is accomplished through ventilation, either collected below a concrete floor slab or a membrane on the ground, or by increasing the air changes per hour in the building. Treatment systems using aeration or activated charcoal are available to remove radon from domestic water supplies. Testing A typical radon test kit Fluctuation of ambient air radon concentration over one week, measured in a laboratory The first step in mitigation is testing to see if the indoor-air and/or domestic water radon concentrations should be reduced. No level of radiation is considered completely safe but it cannot be totally eliminated so governments around the world have set various action levels to provide guidance on when radon concentrations should be reduced while recognizing that radon cannot be eliminated. The World Health Organization's International Radon Project has recommended an action level of 100 Bq/m3 (2.7 pCi/l) for radon in the air. Radon in the air is considered to be a larger health threat than radon in domestic water so the US Environmental Protection Agency recommendation is to not test for radon in water unless a radon in air test is above the action level. However, some US states, such as Maine where radon levels are higher than the national average, recommend all well water should be tested for radon. The US government has not set an action level for radon in water. Air- radon levels fluctuate naturally on a daily and seasonal basis. A short term test (90 days or less) might not be an accurate assessment of a home's average radon level, but are recommended for initial testing to quickly determine unhealthy conditions. Transient weather such as wind and changes in barometric pressure can affect short-term concentrations as well as ventilation such as open windows and the operation of exhaust fans. Testing for radon in the air is accomplished using passive or active devices placed in the building. Some devices are promptly sent to a laboratory for analysis, others calculate the results on-site. Radon-in-water testing requires a water sample being sent to a laboratory. Retesting is recommended in several situations such as to double check test results before spending money on the installation of a mitigation system. Test results which exceed accuracy tolerances also require re-testing. When a mitigation system installation is warranted, a retest after the system is functional is advised to be sure the system is effectively reducing the radon concentration below the action level, and after any mitigation system repairs such as replacing a fan unit. Retesting is also recommended every ten years. =Testing in the United States= Radon map of the United States ASTM E-2121 is a US standard for reducing air-born radon in homes as far as practicable below the action level of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) (148 Bq/m3). Some states recommend achieving 2.0 pCi/L or less. Radon test kits are commercially available and can be used by homeowners, tenants and in limited cases by landlords, except when a property is for sale. Commercially available test kits includes a passive collector that the user places in the lowest livable floor of the house for 2 to 7 days. The user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis. Long-term kits, taking collections from 91 days to one year, are also available. Open land test kits can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins, but are not recommended by the EPA because they do not accurately predict the final indoor radon level. The EPA and the National Environmental Health Association have identified 15 types of radon test devices. A Lucas cell is one type of device. Retesting is specifically recommended in several situations. Measurements between 4 and 10 pCi/L (148 and 370 Bq/m3) warrant a follow-up short term or long-term radon test before mitigation. Measurements over 10 pCi/L (370 Bq/m3) warrant only another short-term test (not a long term test) so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed. Purchasers of real estate may delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to less than 4 pCi/L. The accuracy of the residential radon test depends upon the lack of ventilation in the house when the sample is being obtained. Thus the occupants will be instructed not to open windows, etc., for ventilation during the pendency of test, usually two days or more. However, the occupants, if the present owners, will be motivated to pass the test and insure the sale, so they might be tempted to open a window to get a lower radon score. Moreover, there may be children or immature teens or young adults in the house who will open a window for ventilation notwithstanding instructions not to do so, particularly in uncomfortably hot weather. Accordingly, whether the potential purchaser should trust the result of such a test is problematic. Management of radon service provider certification has evolved since being introduced by the EPA in 1986. In the 1990s this service was \\"privatized\\" and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) helped transition the voluntary National Radon Proficiency Program (NRPP) to be administered by private firms. , the NRPP is administered by the American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST). Some states, such as Maine, require landlords to test their rental properties and turn the results in to the state. In limited cases the landlord or tenant(s) may do the testing themselves. The rules in each state vary. In many cases there are private contractors that will inspect hired by the city. =Testing in Canada= Canadian Government, in conjunction with the territories and provinces, developed the guideline to indicate when remedial action should be taken was originally set at 800 Bq/m¬≥ (becquerels per cubic meter) and since reduced to 200 Bq/m¬≥. This new guideline was approved by the Federal Provincial Territorial Radiation Protection Committee in October 2006. =Testing in the UK= Radon testing in the UK is managed UKradon, a department of Public Health England. https://www.ukradon.org/ Methods of radon gas mitigation Part of a radon mitigation system including the fan and vent pipe is visible near the gutter downspout.Because high levels of radon have been found in every state of the United States, testing for radon and installing radon mitigation systems has become a specialized industry since the 1980s. Many states have implemented programs that affect home buying and awareness in the real estate community, however radon testing and mitigation systems are not generally mandatory unless specified by the local jurisdiction. According to the EPA's \\"A Citizen's Guide to Radon\\", the method to reduce radon \\"primarily used is a vent pipe system and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside\\", which is also called sub-slab depressurization, soil suction, or active soil depressurization (ASD). Generally indoor radon can be mitigated by sub-slab depressurization and exhausting such radon-laden air to the outdoors, away from windows and other building openings. \\"EPA generally recommends methods which prevent the entry of radon. Soil suction, for example, prevents radon from entering your home by drawing the radon from below the home and venting it through a pipe, or pipes, to the air above the home where it is quickly diluted\\" and \\"EPA does not recommend the use of sealing alone to reduce radon because, by itself, sealing has not been shown to lower radon levels significantly or consistently\\" according to the EPA's \\"Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction: How to fix your home\\". Ventilation systems can utilize a heat exchanger or energy recovery ventilator to recover part of the energy otherwise lost in the process of exchanging air with the outside. For crawlspaces, the EPA states, \\"An effective method to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes involves covering the earth floor with a high-density plastic sheet. A vent pipe and fan are used to draw the radon from under the sheet and vent it to the outdoors. This form of soil suction is called submembrane suction, and when properly applied is the most effective way to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes.\\" *The most common approach is active soil depressurization (ASD). Experience has shown that ASD is applicable to most buildings since radon usually enters from the soil and rock underneath and mechanical ventilation (MV) is used when the indoor radon is emitted from the building materials. A less common approach works efficiently by reducing air pressures within cavities of exterior and demising walls where radon emitting from building materials, most often concrete blocks, collects. *Above slab air pressure differential barrier technology (ASAPDB) requires that the interior pressure envelope, most often drywall, as well as all ductwork for air conditioning systems, be made as airtight as possible. A small blower, often no more than 15 cubic feet per minute (0.7 l/s) may then extract the radon- laden air from these cavities and exhaust it to the out of doors. With well- sealed HVAC ducts, very small negative pressures, perhaps as little as 0.5 pascal (0.00007 psi), will prevent the entry of highly radon-laden wall cavity air from entering into the breathing zone. Such ASAPDB technology is often the best radon mitigation choice for high-rise condominiums as it does not increase indoor humidity loads in hot humid climates, and it can also work well to prevent mold growth in exterior walls in heating climates. *In hot, humid climates, heat recovery ventilators (HRV) as well as energy recovery ventilators (ERV) have a record of increasing indoor relative humidity and dehumidification demands on air conditioning systems. Mold problems can occur in homes that have been radon mitigated with HRV and ERV installations in hot, humid climates. HRVs and ERVs have an excellent record in cold dry climates. *A recent technology is based on building science. It includes a variable rate mechanical ventilation system that prevents indoor relative humidity from rising above a preset level such as 50% which is currently suggested by the US Environmental Protection Agency and others as an upper limit for the prevention of mold. It has proven to be especially effective in hot, humid climates. It controls the air delivery rate so that the air conditioner is never overloaded with more moisture than it can effectively remove from the indoor air. It is generally assumed that air conditioner operation will remove excess moisture from the air in the breathing zone, but it is important to note that just because the air conditioner cools does not mean that it is also dehumdifying. If Œît is 14 degrees or less, it may not dehumidify at all even though it is cooling. Factors that are likely to aggravate indoor humidity problems from mechanical ventilation‚Äìbased radon installations are as follows and an expert radon mitigator/building scientist will check for and correct any and all of the following when he or she performs radon mitigation procedures: * Air conditioner duct leaks located outside the breathing zone, such as in the attic. * Excessive exhaust fan operation * Oversize or over-capacity air conditioners * AC air handler fans that do not stop running when the air conditioner compressor stops running. * Delta t (Œît), which is the amount that the air is cooled as it is passed through the air conditioner's cooling coils. A good Œît performance figure for home air conditioners is about 20 ¬∞F (11 ¬∞C). In comparison, automobile air conditioners deliver Œît performance of 32 to 38 ¬∞F (18 to 21 ¬∞C). A Œît of 14 ¬∞F (8 ¬∞C) will dehumidify poorly if at all. In South Florida, most radon mitigation is performed by use of fixed rate mechanical ventilation. Radon mitigation training in Florida does not include problems associated with mechanical ventilation systems, such as high indoor humidity, mold, moldy odors, property damage or health consequences of human occupation in high humidity of moldy environments. As a result, most Florida radon mitigators are unaware of and do not incorporate existing building science moisture management technology into mechanical ventilation radon installations. Home inspectors may not necessarily be aware of the mold risks associated with radon mitigation by mechanical ventilation. The average cost for an ASD radon mitigation system in Minnesota is $1500. These costs are very dependent on the type of home and age of construction. Methods of radon-in-water mitigation Radon removal from water supplies may be at a treatment plant, point of entry, or point of use. Public water supplies in the United States were required to treat for radionuclides beginning in 2003 but private wells are not regulated by the federal government . The radon can be captured by granular activated charcoal (GAR) or released into the air through aeration of the water. Radon will naturally dissipate from water over a period of days, but the quantity of storage needed to treat the water in this manner makes home systems of this type impracticably large. Activated carbon systems capture radon from the water. The amount of radiation accumulates over time and the filter material may reach the level of requiring disposal as a radioactive waste. However, in the United States there are no regulations concerning radiation levels and disposal of radon treatment waste . Aeration systems move the radon from the water to the air. Radon gas discharged into the air is the release of a pollutant, and may become regulated in the United States.

In the 2002‚Äì03 season, they reached the 4th round of the FA Vase. They are currently members of the and play home games at Weston Park. The club is affiliated to the Bedfordshire County Football Association. History Weston Park in July 2019 The club was formed in 1887 and its name was reputedly brought to Wootton when the manager of the disbanded Hitchin Blue Cross joined the Club. The Club started in the Bedford and District League before joining the South Midlands League in 1946 where they won the league title in 1947‚Äì48 and finished runners up in 1949‚Äì50. Wootton joined the United Counties League in 1954, winning the league title in 1967‚Äì68 and 1969‚Äì70. Wootton were promoted to the new UCL Premier League in 1972. In the 1960s Wootton won the Hinchingbrooke Cup no less than four times. In 1970‚Äì71 under the guidance of the Chairman/Manager Doug Field and captained by Phil Burraway they won the Bedfordshire Senior Cup beating Leighton Town 1‚Äì0 at Kenilworth Road. They won the Senior Cup again in 2000‚Äì01 under Manager Jon Taylor. Former Luton Town boss Lil Fuccillo joined the coaching staff in 2001 with immediate effect the team racing to the top of the league with a ten match winning run. Following a mid season run of injury and sickness the team fell to a disappointing but credible fifth place. In 2003, Lil left to join his old comrade Barry Fry at Peterborough United and was replaced by Bobby Roberts. The team then had a very exciting run in the FA Vase getting to the fourth round before losing to (the subsequent holders) Whitley Bay. A large crowd saw Wootton go down 2‚Äì1 in extra time. The team finished third in the league and beat St. Neots to win the Hinchingbrooke Cup once again. At the end of the season Jon left to join St Neots and was replaced by Kenny Davidson who for the first time brought home the Hunts Premier Cup. After a sudden exit by Kenny and several of the players the reserve manager Phil Silvestry took the reins and with a young squad kept the Club in the Premier division. In his first full season the team finished mid table and despite an excellent start in 2006‚Äì07, lying in 3rd position at Christmas, finished 9th. In 2007‚Äì08 the Club worked through four different managers and were relegated after 38 years in the Premier Division. In 2008‚Äì09, long serving physio Mel Roberts took over the Manager's spot assisted by long serving captain Scott McGregor as coach. Despite a bright start the season ended with an eight-game win-less streak with the club just avoiding relegation. Current manager, and ex-player, Andy Arnold, joined the club for the 2009‚Äì10 season after a spell managing Bedford United. Blue Cross also signed Calum Davenport in order to get him fit and to try to get themselves back into the United Counties League. For the 2011‚Äì12 season, Davenport also became first team coach as well as player.

They were built in three batches, including one batch of two engines for the private Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, the WMR, by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1885, 1891, and 1901. Previously the N class designation had been applied between 1877 and 1879 to Lady Mordaunt, a member of the B class of 1874.Sean Millar, From A to Y Avoiding I: 125 Years of Railway Motive Power Classification in New Zealand (self-published, 2001, ), 59. Construction Despite the Long Depression of the 1880s, the young New Zealand railway network continued to expand and additional motive power was required. The New Zealand Railways Department had normally ordered locomotives from England up until this time, though it had previously bought locomotives from United States manufacturers (such as the Rogers K class), and in 1885 it placed an order with Baldwin, whose first New Zealand locomotives were the T class, to construct the six original members of the N class, which entered service between October and December 1885. Six years later the WMR required additional motive power to handle the growing traffic on their line from Wellington to Longburn, just south of Palmerston North. Its typical supplier of equipment was Baldwin, who offered the WMR a locomotive similar to the N class. The WMR ordered two such locomotives and they entered service as Nos. 9 and 10. They proved to be more efficient than the 1885 batch, and in an attempt to match these efficiencies the government converted N 27 into a Vauclain compound, but with little success. In 1901, the government ordered four similar locomotives. =Subclasses= Two sub-classes of the N class existed, both Baldwin Vauclain compounds built for the WMR. Nos. 14 and 15 were a heavier and more powerful version of the N class and became the NA class; Nos. 5 and 18 had wider fireboxes and became the NC class. Operation The 1885 batch operated in the Hutt Valley and the Wairarapa; the 1901 batch around Auckland. Around 1900 they were used on the Napier Express coupled with an (rather ineffectual) M class loco; the duo was called a 'en and chicken. In 1908 the WMR was nationalised and incorporated into the government's network. The two ex-WMR Ns continued to work on their home route until World War I, when they were transferred to Westland to operate the mail trains between Greymouth and Otira, making full use of their speed. In the 1920s the two were modified for shunting duties, including the addition of a tender cab and side ladders on the tender. =A world record= The most outstanding operational feat by an N class locomotive occurred on 20 July 1892. WMR No. 10 departed Wellington with a special test train, and gradually picked up speed on the flat trackage of the Kapiti Coast and Horowhenua. It ran comfortably at speeds of 50-55 mph, and between Levin and Shannon it reached 64.4 mph (103.6 km/h), then the world speed record on narrow gauge track. Withdrawal By the 1920s withdrawal was seriously considered. The first two were withdrawn in November 1926; the boiler from WMR No. 9/N 453, withdrawn on 13 November 1926, was re-used on WB 300 when it was overhauled, distinguishing it from others of its class. Three more were withdrawn in March 1927, and N 27, the first member of the class, followed in November of that year. Record-setting WMR No. 10/N 454 was also meant to be withdrawn in 1927 but was given a reprieve: its crews formally complained about its poor condition and it ceased service on 30 January 1928. It was stripped of useful parts and sat in Greymouth yard until it was officially written off on 31 March 1928. It was dumped in the Waimakariri River as a means of stabilising the riverbank. The last N was taken out of service in March 1934. Preservation None of the N class were saved for preservation - they were withdrawn at least two decades before the preservation movement had even seriously begun. However, the skeleton of WMR No. 9/N 453 was discovered near Arthur's Pass, dumped in the Bealey River, and it was recovered by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Trust in stages between 2003 and 2006 with the aim of restoring it to full operational condition. On 27 February 2007, No. 9 returned to its old home of Paekakariki and is now based at the depot of Steam Incorporated, where it is undergoing restoration to working order. By May 2009, No.9's tender had been dismantled, and the frames and bogies overhauled and reassembled. Railway enthusiasts have also attempted to find the remnants of WMR No. 10/N 454 but have not yet had success.

The goal of the game is to align rows of lights on top of each other. A player who stacks 11 rows can choose to win a minor prize, which is usually low in value, sometimes lower in value than the amount of money the player paid to play the game. A player who gets to the top row wins a major prize. Major prizes vary from machine to machine but will often include high-value items such as game consoles and mobile phones and gift cards from 50 to 100$. There are three different colorways for the machines; blue and black, red and black, and red, yellow, and blue.  Standard layout  There is a row of three LED blocks which move side to side on the screen, at the first row. When the player pushes the start/stop button, the row of blocks will stop. Then, another row of three moving blocks appears above the previous row, moving faster than the one before it. If the blocks do not align directly above the previous set, any overhanging blocks will be removed. If the player misses completely, the game is over. The number of available blocks is automatically reduced to two, then one, during the game. The goal is to consistently get the blocks directly above the previous set, 'stacking' them to the minor prize and ultimately the major prize level. According to the merchandise manual, a major prize is worth about 100 times the cost per play.LAI Games. Merchandise Manual Comic Book for Stacker game. Accessed 2007-10-07.  Difficulty  Stacker is a skill with prize game, although the relative proportions are not specified by LAI or in the operator's manual, it does state a disclaimer that it is '100% a game of skill and although it is very difficult, every game played can be a winning game.' The owner's manual states that at the game's highest difficulty level, the estimated ratio of wins to losses will be near 1-in-800. However, the actual ratio may be lower or higher based somewhat on the skill of the players, with the approximate frequency of winning the major prize being set at the discretion of the game's operator. However, despite the claim in the operator's manual that the game is '100% a game of skill', some versions of stacker have settings that allow the operator to adjust the frequency of pay outs by making it impossible for the player to stack rows beyond a certain height; usually just before the major prize. Even if the player pushes the button at the right time, the moving squares will either skip a certain column or keep moving after the button is pushed.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofEb9fM8m0Q&feature;=emb_title&ab;_channel=ArcadeMatt If a person reaches the 'Major Prize' level, the blocks will flash on and off spelling the word 'Win.'  Variations of Stacker  *Stacker Standard - The original Stacker created in 2004. *Stacker Club - Similar to Stacker Standard but with different colors and graphics aimed towards older people. *Mini Stacker - This is a smaller version of Stacker, meant for places that do not have enough space for the regular Stacker game. *Stacker Giant - A bigger version of Stacker. *Stacker Double Up - This version of Stacker only pays out tickets. When players reach the 'Double Up Zone', they are offered to double their tickets. When players reach the 'Super Bonus Zone,' they win the jackpot displayed. *Stack-It - This is a later version of Stacker Double Up. This version is more similar to the original Stacker game. *Stack n' Grab - In this version of Stacker, the playfield is smaller, and when players get to the top, they get unlimited tries to grab a prize with a claw machine. *Stacker Wall Street - A version of Stacker that can be mounted on a wall, and has 4 areas for prizes. *Mega Stacker - The largest version of Stacker. This version has an adjustable ticket amount instead of the minor prize. It also has a platform to stand on and a metal bar to sit on. *Mega Stacker Lite - This version of Mega Stacker only pays out tickets. It also does not have a platform or metal bar. *  Sales tactics  Stacker has been advertised as being a successor to crane games. A typical stacker game is 78\\" high by 27\\". A more recently released version of the game, called Stacker Giant, is about twice the size. Stacker games come in two different color schemes; black and blue, or red and blue. Yet another version has been added to the family recently: the Stacker Mini. It is just like the standard Stacker except it only has two major prize arms and four minor prize arms, and only has 10 rows of lights instead of the standard 15. It is red, black, and white and stands about 6 feet tall by two feet deep and two feet wide. All of the different schemes are attractively painted to draw in customers. Stacker games have large windows covering the top half of the machine on three sides. The large windows are to allow passersby to be able to view the prizes, which may, in turn, lead them to play the game. Such techniques use prizes such as the Nintendo Wii, the Xbox 360, Nintendo 3DS systems and other products that are either difficult for children to obtain due to cost, or are appealing to kids because of looks. The four \\"Prize rods\\" on a Stacker game are spread far apart and lit from the ceiling to add emphasis.

Biography Hazard was the son of a school teacher. Starting in 1900, he attended the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris. He received a doctorate from the Sorbonne in 1910 and became famous for his Ph.D. dissertation La R√©volution fran√ßaise et les lettres italiennes (1910).Giuseppe Ricuperati, \\"Paul Hazard e la Storiografia dell'Illuminismo.\\",[Paul Hazard and Enlightenment historiography] Rivista Storica Italiana (1974) 86#2: 372-404. Hazard began his career at the University of Lyon in 1910, teaching comparative literature. In 1919 he began teaching also at the Sorbonne. In 1925 Hazard was appointed to the chair of comparative literature at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris. In alternating years, from 1932 until 1940, he was a visiting lecturer at Columbia University in New York. During the 1920s and 1930s, Hazard also lectured at other American schools. He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1939. After finishing his semester of teaching at Columbia in 1940, Hazard voluntarily returned to Nazi occupied France in January 1941. He continued to teach, at Lyon and Paris, and to study. Later that same year Hazard was nominated to the rectorship of the University of Paris, but was rejected by the Nazis as unacceptable. Working under what have been described as cruel circumstances, he completed European Thought in the Eighteenth Century. In the year of his death, an article, Pour que vive l'√¢me de la France (So That the Soul of France May Live), appeared in the clandestine review France de demain. Hazard died in Paris on 13 April 1944. Published works Hazard founded, with Fernand Baldensperger, the Revue de litt√©rature compar√©e in 1921. Some of his important writings are Histoire illustr√©e de la litt√©rature fran√ßaise (comp. with Joseph B√©dier, 2 vol., 1923‚Äì24); Leopardi (1913); Lamartine (1926); Stendhal (1927); Don Quichotte (1931); and Les livres, les enfants et les hommes (1932) (Books, Children and Men tr. 1944). This last work has been described as a sensitive appraisal of works written either for very young readers, or taken over by them, covering all Europe over many centuries. In this book, he was the first to point out that Northern Europe surpassed Southern Europe in children's literature. Hazard is known today mainly for two works. The first was La Crise de la conscience europ√©enne, 1935 (The European Mind, the Critical Years, 1680-1715, tr. 1952). This work examined the conflict between 17th-century Neoclassicism and its ideals of order and perfection and the ideas of the Enlightenment. The other was his last completed work La Pens√©e europ√©enne au XVIII√®me si√®cle, de Montesquieu √† Lessing (1946) (European Thought in the Eighteenth Century from Montesquieu to Lessing, tr. 1954 by J. Lewis MayJames Lewis May (1873‚Äì1961) was a British Catholic author, critic, translator, and biographer. He is noteworthy for his biography of Anatole France and his 1928 translation of Madame Bovary. He translated many works from Latin, French, and Italian. ) published posthumously in 1946. This work was a continuation of the subject matter discussed in The European Mind. Apparently, Hazard intended a third volume which would have focused on \\"the Man of Feeling.

History Th planetarium is built where the Saltlageret theater was previously located. The foundation stone was placed on February 22, 1988, and the planetarium opened on November 1, 1989. The financial basis for building the planetarium was a 50,000,000 DKK donation by the foundation Bodil Pedersen Fonden to the foundation Uraniafonden, which administered the construction of the planetarium. Since 1989, the Bodil Pedersen Fonden has also awarded the annual Tycho Brahe Medaljen.  Exhibition  The exhibition underwent a major renovation in 2017, and the new exhibition Made in Space opened in February 2018. The exhibition was made in collaboration with Tony-winning, London based designers, 59 Productions, and was made on a donation from the foundation A.P. M√∏ller Fonden. The exhibition is an interactive and including exhibition, telling the story of how all of the elements that make up a human originally came from space. The Tycho Brahe Planetarium is home to the largest lunar rock that can be seen outside the US. Weighing more than 200 grams, it was brought back to Earth by the crew on the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. In the Dome Theatre there are shows every day. The centre also screens OMNIMAX and 3D films. Most are narrated to Danish, but it is possible to have English narration in headphones. During summertime there are normally a few shows in English every day. There are also two smaller exhibitions. One about space technology and the other about Tycho Brahe.

M. Barrie. It was directed by Herbert Brenon and starred Betty Bronson as Peter Pan, Ernest Torrence as Captain Hook, Mary Brian as Wendy, Virginia Browne Faire as Tinker Bell, and Anna May Wong as the Indian princess Tiger Lily.Peter Pan at SilentEraThe AFI Catalog of Feature Films:Peter Pan Plot In the story, Peter Pan, a magical boy who refuses to grow up, brings the Darling children (Wendy, John, and Michael) from London to Neverland, where they have adventures that include a confrontation with the pirate Captain Hook and his crew. Later, the children feel homesick and wish to go home. Wendy invites Peter and the Lost Boys to come with them so they can be adopted. The Lost Boys are eager to do so, but Peter refuses because he does not wish to grow up. Wendy and her brothers and the Lost Boys are captured by the pirates, but rescued by Peter, who forces Captain Hook to walk the plank and be eaten by the crocodile who once ate his hand. Wendy and the boys return to the Darling home, where Mrs. Darling meets Peter for the first time and offers to adopt him, but he refuses for the same reason that he refused to go back with Wendy and the boys - he has no intention of growing up. Peter asks Wendy to return to Neverland with him, and Mrs. Darling agrees to allow Wendy to go back once a year to help Peter with his spring cleaning.

Added scenes include Nana the dog pouring out Michael's medicine and giving him a bath, and Nana bursting into the home at which a party is being given, to warn Mr. and Mrs. Darling that Peter Pan and the Darling children are flying around the nursery. Like the original play and several other versions, and unlike the 1953 Disney film, the 1924 version makes it clear that Wendy harbors a romantic attachment to Peter, but Peter only thinks of her as his mother. The film omits the scene An Afterthought, which Barrie wrote after the play was staged, and in which Peter returns for Wendy, only to find that years have passed and that she is now a married woman with a daughter. Barrie selected Bronson for the role, and wrote additional scenes for the film, but Brenon stuck largely to the stageplay. Release and restoration Peter Pan was first released in the United States on December 29, 1924. The distributor was Paramount Pictures. In Germany, where the premiere took place in December 1925, the distributor was UFA. Since there was no national film archive in the United States and Paramount had no interest in a long-term distribution of the film ‚Äì distributors held movies only as long in the program as they earned money ‚Äì most copies of Peter Pan were destroyed over the years. For decades, the film was thought to be lost. In the 1950s James Card, film restorer and curator of George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, discovered a well- preserved copy in a vault at the Eastman School of Music, and made a preservation of that source. Film historian David Pierce discovered an additional and hitherto unknown 16mm copy at the Disney Studios which had been made when the company acquired the rights to the property in 1938. A new restoration was undertaken by the George Eastman House combining the two sources in 1994, and Philip C. Carli composed new film music for it, which was premiered by the Flower City Society Orchestra at the 1996 Pordenone Silent Film Festival. Reception The film was celebrated at the time for its innovative use of special effects (mainly to show Tinker Bell) according to Disney's 45th anniversary video of their adaptation of Peter Pan. In 2000, this film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

It regularly holds various championships and is used as a qualifying venue when The Open Championship is held at Muirfield (most recently 2013). It was opened in 1832 and occupies a place at the centre of golfing history. History The area which is home to the course today - a strip of land adjacent to the beach and extending westward over 2 miles from the edge of the town centre to the nature reserve at Yellowcraigs - has been used for golf for at least 400 years, although early participants were not welcomed by local landowners or authorities. The course was officially opened in 1832 with 6 holes, necessitating competitions to be played over 3 rounds. After a period of expansion which began in 1868, the course featured 18 holes by 1877 and was extended to a \\"full length\\" of 6095 yards in 1895. The last major alteration to the course was masterminded by Ben Sayers in 1932, since which time the layout of the course has hardly changed. Today the course measures 6,420 yards. Clubs Four golf clubs are based at the West Links - the North Berwick Golf Club (founded 1832), Tantallon Golf Club (1853), Bass Rock Golf Club (1873) and the North Berwick Ladies Golf Club (1888). The North Berwick G.C. is the 13th oldest club in the world and only St. Andrews has a club which has continuously played over the same course for longer. In 2005 it voted to give ladies full rights as members for the first time - ironic as it was originally the first club in the world to allow ladies to become members. Holes North Berwick West Links Its signature hole is thought by many to be the 15th, \\"Redan\\", a par-3 which starts with a blind tee-shot over a valley towards the green which is perched on a hill beyond and tilted away and to the left. The design of the hole has been copied on several newer courses around the world, particularly in Japan. One of the earliest copies of the Redan hole is the 7th at Shinnecock Hills, famous for the trouble it caused players during the 2004 U.S. Open. The Redan at North Berwick is preceded (see map) by an heroic stretch of three holes: The 12th hole \\"Bass\\" which requires a knowledgeable tee shot in order to afford the best angle into the green, the 13th hole \\"Pit\\" where an ancient stone wall fronts a relatively small green, and the blind-approach 14th hole \\"Perfection\\" which can yield a wide range of scores even in ideal conditions. The 16th hole \\"Gate\\" features a divided green, with two raised surfaces divided by a punishing valley, a rare feature in the golfing world because of the lack of courage among modern architects to propose such a hole to golf course developers. Facilities The North Berwick Golf Club and the Tantallon Golf Club both maintain clubhouses, the former with the prime location off the 18th green and the latter just over the road. Both clubhouses have changing rooms and dining facilities. As part of \\"The Sayers Project\\", the NBGC is planning to expand their clubhouse to include better leisure facilities. They also intend to incorporate the David Huish Pro Shop into the main building and use the site currently occupied by the shop for state-of- the-art practice bays and swing analysis technology. At the far end of the course there is a practice area within the loop created by the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th holes. The area features a driving / iron play field (no automatic ball retrieval) and a multi-hole putting green. Literature In 1980 Alistair Beaton Adamson, a lifelong member of the club, wrote a history of the club entitled \\"In the wind's eye\\" with humour and deep appreciation of the important part the course has played on the world golfing stage. The book includes many b&w; photos, colour illustrations and a plethora of facts. It is now very rare and cherished by those lucky enough to own a copy.

Initially consisting of about 3,300 miners and their families, the district's population have grown over the years to over 18,000. Although Giszowiec's architectural originality suffered major damages in the 1970s and 1980s due to large scale urbanization, its early unique character can be still felt in the surviving miners' housings, the marketplace, numerous individual buildings and structures, as well as the relatively well preserved general design of a \\"Garden city\\". Location Giszowiec is located some 7 kilometers southeast from the center of Katowice and its geographical coordinates are 50¬∞ 14' N, 19¬∞ 04' O coordinates: 50¬∞ 14' N, 19¬∞ 04' O. Its boundaries are marked in the north by the motorway A4, in the west by the international European route E75, while in the south and in the east, Giszowiec borders the nearby city of Mys≈Çowice. The settlement is somewhat isolated from other Katowice districts and is surrounded by green areas and forests. The neighboring districts are Murcki (3 kilometers to the southwest), as well as Jan√≥w and Nikiszowiec in the north. History =Beginnings= The settlement of Giszowiec does not have a long history. The company \\"Georg von Giesches Erben\\", which in late 19th century owned many mines in Upper Silesia, planned its own settlement for workers, and therefore Colonie Gieschewald was founded 1907. =Structure of the colony= The leading director of the settlement was Anton Uthemann, who came up with the basic project. This work was completed by George and Emil Zillmann, architects from Charlottenburg, who designed the settlement inspired by Ebenezer Howard's idea of the \\"Garden city\\". In just three years the project was completed: high living standard houses for 600 families were built, with four main streets leading to the central marketplace (today called Plac pod Lipami - Square under the Linden Trees). The settlement had its own institutions, a hotel, department stores, a swimming pool and a water tower. Some dwellings were offered to those miners who lived without family. Most inhabitants worked for the Giesche coal mine (today: Wieczorek coal mine), and the total cost of the colony was estimated at 5 million German Marks. In 1914, a narrow-gauge railway to Jan√≥w was opened. Throughout its early history the colony was an independent municipality. =Silesian Uprisings= Inhabitants of the settlement took active part in the Silesian Uprisings, and during the Plebiscite in Upper Silesia, over 70% locals voted for Poland. =Giszowiec in Poland= On 20 June 1922 Gieschewald was renamed Giszowiec and became part of the new Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship and was since then part of the Second Polish Republic. In the subsequent years, numerous Polish associations, among them also a choir were created. Giszowiec lost its independent status in 1924, when it was incorporated into the new municipality of Jan√≥w. German troops occupied the settlement on 4 September 1939. During the occupation, the Nazis tried to destroy everything related to Poland, including a monument of the Silesian Uprising. On 27 January 1945, Red Army captured Giszowiec. After the Second World War, Giszowiec was merged with Szopienice, but later this decision was voided. In the course of time the appearance of the colony changed. 1964 were established in the area of the colony after hard coal finds the Staszic Steinkohlebergwerk. In order to take up the inflow of new workers, new populated areas were proven. It was decided that the colony should be torn off and be established in the area a new settlement with zehnstoeckigen blocks of flats. Thus 1969 the Stanis≈Çaw Staszic housing development was built, which approximated in the next decades ever more near to the old colony. In the western part and East part new disk's buildings replaced the old brick houses, and the colony began to lose their old character of a company-owned housing estate. With the resolutions of the responsible curator of 1978 and 1987 to place the old land development under monument protection the colony could be saved fortunately. In the nineties was begun to maintain and also restore the historical settlement. Nevertheless, only one third of the old land development remained. 1984 were begun with the building of the Barbarapfarrkirche in the Staszic settlement. Giszowiec is also today still surrounded by forest and is by its relatively large distance to the urban tightness, a popular local recreation place for the inhabitants of the whole city and, since it is the only garden city in Poland, gladly visited and also inhabited. The houses of the colony were transferred 1999 of the city Katowice, since the houses become sold at private people. =Education= In the old colony there is an elementary school number 51(Szko≈Ça Podstawowa nr 51) with approximately 1000 pupils. School building was constructed in 1993 and is the newest in Giszowiec. The two high schools are older. In the seventies the Konopnicka High School (Gimnazjum numer 16 imienia Marii Konopnickiej) was established, the school chronicles go back however until 1908, thus the beginnings of the Gieschewalder school history. Here there are 400 pupils. In addition there exists another high school (Gimnazjum nr 15), with 374 pupils.

The player assumes control of the 21-year-old space cadet Hiromi Tengenji, a pilot training to become a member of the Space Force, who must complete each level by shooting down enemies with her airbike and avoiding projectiles. Gameplay is similar to Space Harrier, featuring a fixed camera position behind the player and having similar mechanics. It runs on the Namco System 2 arcade hardware. Gameplay Screenshot of the arcade version In Burning Force, the player controls a 21-year-old space cadet named , who as part of her final training, must battle high-tech enemies through six worlds of four areas on a futuristic airbike named \\"Sign Duck\\". The gameplay is similar to that of Sega's Space Harrier, but the worlds are divided into four areas and there is no vertical mobility making the game different in its own right; in the first two sections the player controls Hiromi on the airbike, which can move to the left and right, as well as braking and accelerating - and the airbike can also fire bullets and missiles at the enemies. The third area of every world is a boss area and the airbike will be transformed into a flying ship which can move in all directions; the fourth area of each world, however, is a bonus stage and the player has to collect as many spheres (which have numbers on them) as possible for bonus points. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Burning Force on their December 1, 1989 issue as being the ninth most-successful table arcade game of the year.

The institute was named after Sahu Shreyans Prasad Jain of the Sahu Jain family, who financed the institution in its early years. At the time of its establishment, SPJIMR was among the three business schools in Mumbai. After financing from the Sahu Jain family stopped, the institute disaffiliated itself from Bombay University to provide itself with more freedom in curriculum decision-making and pedagogy design.

One of the screenwriters was Dalton Trumbo's son, Christopher Trumbo. Set principally in London, the film is about a Chicago detective sent to Britain to organise the extradition of an American mobster, who is soon kidnapped and held for ransom. Struggling with the restrained policing style of his British counterparts, the tough Irish-American detective uses his own brand of law enforcement to recapture the criminal. Plot Tough Chicago Police Lieutenant Jim Brannigan (John Wayne) is sent to London to extradite a notorious American gangster, Ben Larkin (John Vernon). Brannigan is assigned a local officer, Jennifer (Judy Geeson), to help while he is in London. But before Brannigan can collect his man, Larkin is kidnapped. Larkin's finger is cut off and mailed to the police to prove how serious the kidnappers are. The mobster's lawyer, Mel Fields (Mel Ferrer), tries to arrange a ransom drop while Brannigan makes his way around London in search of Larkin. Whilst struggling to adapt to the British way of life, and the restrained style of policing, he employs techniques not usually seen in Britain. In the meantime, a contract had already been put out on Brannigan's life by Larkin, so hit man Gorman (Daniel Pilon) tails Brannigan in a black Jaguar E-Type, making several attempts to kill him and nearly shooting Jennifer by mistake. Commander Swann (Richard Attenborough), in charge of helping get Larkin to America, is a stuffy, titled, upper class Metropolitan Police commander who is not afraid to get his hands dirty. There is continual conflict between Brannigan and Swann about the American's carrying, and use of, his .38 Colt Diamondback revolver. Permitted to go alone to deliver the ransom payment, Fields personally eliminates the kidnappers. He and Larkin celebrate having pulled off a scheme to get the money, Larkin calling the loss of a finger a small price to pay. Brannigan bursts in to foil their plans. As he and Jennifer walk away, Gorman tries to mow them down with his car, but he is shot by Brannigan, who can now return home to Chicago. Cast * John Wayne as Lieutenant James Brannigan * Richard Attenborough as Commander Sir Charles Swann, Bart.Swann explains to Brannigan that his title of \\"Sir\\" is hereditary, having been bestowed upon one of his \\"ancient ancestors, probably for holding somebody's horse at a coronation.\\" * Judy Geeson as Detective Sergeant Jennifer Thatcher * Mel Ferrer as Mel Fields * John Vernon as Ben Larkin * Daniel Pilon as Gorman * Ralph Meeker as Captain Moretti * Lesley Anne Down as Luana * Barry Dennen as Julian * John Stride as Detective Inspector Michael Traven * James Booth as Charlie-the-Handle * Arthur Batanides as Angell *Pauline Delaney as Mrs. Cooper * Del Henney as Drexel * Brian Glover as Jimmy-the-Bet * Don Henderson as Geef * Tony Robinson as Motorcycle Courier Production Brannigan was filmed on location in London during 1974. The film's action sequences included a car chase through Battersea's Shaftsbury & Winstanley Estate, Wandsworth and Central London featuring Brannigan jumping a yellow Ford Capri coupe across the half raised Tower Bridge. One sequence features shots of the interior and exterior of London's Royal Automobile Club, which has changed little since the shooting of the film. The Capri's jump was one of the last significant appearances of Tower Bridge without its red, white and blue paint scheme which was applied in 1977 to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. A fight sequence was filmed in the Lamb Tavern in Leadenhall Market. Conversely, the film's opening sequence and first several minutes display Chicago roadways, riverside buildings and an early O'Hare Terminal 1 that have all been razed and replaced. For example, the film opens on a squad car making the former turn on Upper Lake Shore Drive where East Wacker Drive now exists and where Field Drive had been planned to intersect; in the background, iron workers can be seen constructing the connecting portion of Upper Wacker. The 300 block of North Canal Street, where Brannigan conducts an investigation using \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\", rapidly developed between this film, Doctor Detroit, and Raw Deal, and has further developed through to the present day. As Brannigan approaches O'Hare, the Kennedy Expressway is devoid of both commercial development to the north and south, and the Blue Line tracks in the median. Likewise, West India Quay, immediately north of the Isle of Dogs has become unrecognisable with the development of the Docklands in general and Canary Wharf in particular. The location is seen as a derelict, nearly- abandoned dockside during Brannigan's confrontation with the motor-scooter messenger (Tony Robinson), and has since been radically transformed. Much of the film was also filmed in Beckton Gasworks and parts of North Woolwich and Silvertown in Newham's part of Docklands. When a hole is blown in Brannigan's lavatory wall, he looks out to see the Albert Memorial, its statue still coated in thick black paint rather than gold leaf. At the time of filming, the Trafalgar Square post office occupied not only its current footprint, but extended throughout the adjoining commercial spaces, and was marked by an unusually shaped sign extending out from the corner of the building. It contains a piece of footage of the inside of the Garrick Club, which traditionally does not allow cameras and was only agreed to as Richard Attenborough was a long-term member. In the scene in which Brannigan and Commander Swann are at the bar in the Garrick Club, on the wall behind them are portraits of Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud, both in Garrick Club ties. After a Chicago Police officer was depicted in an unflattering light in an episode of the 1957‚Äì60 television series M Squad, then-Mayor Richard J. Daley thereafter discouraged motion picture and television location filming in the city for the rest of his administration and its aftermath. Brannigan is one of the few films ‚Äì along with Cooley High, also released in 1975 ‚Äì to have been approved and granted police assistance during the two-decade era. Reception Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed 2 stars out of a possible 4, writing, \\"'Brannigan' isn't great, but it's a wellcrafted [sic] action movie and, besides, it's got John Wayne in it.\\"Ebert, Roger \\"Brannigan\\". RogerEbert.com A. H. Weiler of The New York Times stated, \\"Unfortunately, Mr. Wayne's first film trip to London doesn't appear to have been necessary.

Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised the film as a \\"smart, lively thriller\\" with a script that has \\"an affectionate sense of fun yet genuine respect for the mythical figure that John Wayne has become.\\"Thomas, Kevin (March 24, 1975). \\"Wayne Rides Herd in London\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 9. Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote that the film \\"is primarily a humdrum slugfest, from the same producers as last year's slovenly Wayne vehicle, 'McQ.' ... What 'Brannigan' does have over 'McQ' is locale: London is a big improvement on Seattle.\\"Shales, Tom (March 20, 1975). \\"Wayne's Two-Fisted 'Brannigan'\\". The Washington Post. B6. Richard Combs of The Monthly Film Bulletin observed, \\"After a sleek recapping of the Clint Eastwood formula in a credits sequence that is all caressing close-ups of the hero's prized revolver, Brannigan spends most of its time hastily backpedalling in order to find some comfortable, old-fashioned niche in the formula for its star ... in fact, the film becomes more and more of a throwback, in everything from Brannigan's chaste relationship with his Girl Friday ... to his abrasive partnership with his opposite number from Scotland Yard.\\" After turning down the starring role in Dirty Harry,Dowell, Pat. - \\"John Wayne, Man and Myth\\". - (book review of: John Wayne, American by Randy Roberts and James S. Olson). - The Washington Post. - 25 September 1995. - Retrieved: 2008-08-05 and seeing the subsequent success of that film, Wayne made two police thrillers, McQ in 1974 and this \\"cop out of water\\" film in 1975. The film currently holds a score of 20% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 10 reviews. Home media On 2 October 2001 Brannigan was released on DVD for the first time. The film is available through Amazon.com in a two-pack with Killer Force, and was released for the first time on Blu-ray through Screen Archives Entertainment on 8 July 2014.

He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. In April 2003 he was knighted in the Netherlands, receiving the Order of the Netherlands Lion. Biography Koopman had a \\"classical education\\" and then studied the organ (with Simon C. Jansen), harpsichord (with Gustav Leonhardt), and musicology in Amsterdam. He specialized in Baroque music and received the Prix d'Excellence for both organ and harpsichord. Koopman founded the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra in 1979 and the Amsterdam Baroque Choir in 1992, now combined as the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra & Choir. Koopman concentrates on Baroque music, especially that of Bach and is a leading figure in the \\"authentic performance\\" movement. While a number of early-music conductors have ventured into newer music, Koopman has not. He has said, \\"I draw the line at Mozart's death\\" (1791).http://ottosbaroquemusick-bachradio.blogspot.com/2010/12/bach-js- harpsichord-concertos-amsterdam.html One exception is his recording of the Concert Champ√™tre of Francis Poulenc, written in 1928. =Bach cantatas project= Among Koopman's most ambitious projects was the recording of the complete cycle of all of Bach's cantatas\\"Ton Koopman and the Bach cantatas\\", Radio Netherlands Archives, March 19, 1996, a project completed in 2005. This project had started while Koopman was an artist of the French Erato Classics label. However, after 12 volumes (36 CDs) the project was stalled when owner Warner Classics wound up its French subsidiary in 2002. Koopman was able to buy back rights for the first 12 volumes and continue the series in 2003 with his own label Antoine Marchand, distributed by Challenge Classics. \\"Antoine Marchand\\" is a French translation of his own name.Billboard - 5 July 2003 - Page 13 Vol. 115, n¬∞ 27 \\"Koopman Gets Back on his Bach Cycle - Koopman started his own Antoine Marchand label imprint and, with the help of a financier friend, revised his search for an existing label that would take on finished master tapes for manufacturing and distribution.\\" Soloists for the project were among others Lisa Larsson, Cornelia Samuelis, Sandrine Piau, Sibylla Rubens, Barbara Schlick, Caroline Stam, Deborah York and Johannette Zomer (soprano), Bogna Bartosz, Michael Chance, Franziska Gottwald, Bernhard Landauer, Elisabeth von Magnus, Annette Markert and Kai Wessel (alto), Paul Agnew, J√∂rg D√ºrm√ºller, James Gilchrist, Christoph Pr√©gardien and Gerd T√ºrk (tenor) and Klaus Mertens (bass). =Buxtehude project= In addition to the works of Bach, Koopman has long been an advocate of the music of Bach's predecessor Dieterich Buxtehude. He had previously recorded the keyboard works for Philips Classics and several cantatas for Erato. He was elected president of the \\"International Dieterich Buxtehude Society\\" in 2004. Following the completion of the Bach cantatas project Koopman then embarked on a recording of the complete works of Buxtehude. In 2005 he commenced Dieterich Buxtehude ‚Äì Opera Omnia, a project to record the complete works of Dieterich Buxtehude, which he finished in October 2014. =Other projects= Besides his work with the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra & Choir, he is in frequent demand as guest conductor and as harpsichordist and organist. In 2011, Koopman began a three- year stint as artist-in-residence with the Cleveland Orchestra.http://www.mercurynews.com/music/ci_17321899 His aim is always to achieve authenticity in performance, using exact copies of historical instruments from the time of the composer, and adopting the performing style of the composers or their contemporaries. The scholar (and fellow keyboardist/conductor) John Butt has criticised Koopman's interpretation of Bach's Goldberg variations for its overuse of ornamentation,John Butt, \\"Bach Recordings since 1980: A Mirror of Historical Performance,\\" in Bach Perspectives 4, ed. David Schulenberg, University of Nebraska Press, 1999, p. 186, which he attributes to a desire to differentiate his interpretation from those of Gustav Leonhardt. Personal life Koopman is married to Tini Mathot, who is also a harpsichordist and fortepianist, and the two frequently perform together. Mathot is also his chief recording producer, as well as a teacher at the Royal Conservatory.http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Mathot- Tini.htm On 11 October 2012 the documentary Live to be a hundred - a year in the life of Ton Koopman was released in Dutch cinemas. Discography Koopman's extensive discography includes the complete Bach cantatas and organ works, St Matthew Passion (twice) and St John Passion, Mass in B minor, Christmas Oratorio, a recording of his own reconstruction of the lost St Mark Passion, concertos and harpsichord works by Bach, Sweelinck's complete keyboard works, the complete works of Buxtehude, Mozart's Coronation Mass and Vespers, Requiem, a cycle of Mozart symphonies. In 1992, he conducts Barbara Schlick and The Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra for Erato with les Motets for double Chorus H 403, H 404, H 135, H 136, H 137, H 392, H 410, H 167 by Marc- Antoine Charpentier, Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, Handel's Messiah and Organ Concertos, et al.

It has an area of 5.1 km2 and in 2007 had 1,902 inhabitants. The literal meaning of the name is a land behind a river.  History  The oldest settlement in the area of what are now the districts Piotrowice, Podlesie and Zarzecze was Uniczowy, a village that existed already in the 12th century. In the 15th century Uniczowy began to crumble into three distinct parts. Zarzecze became independent somewhat in the 16th century. During the political upheaval caused by Matthias Corvinus the land around Pszczyna was overtaken by Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn, who sold it in 1517 to the Hungarian magnates of the Thurz√≥ family, forming the Pless state country. In the accompanying sales document issued on 21 February 1517 the village was mentioned as Zarzeczie. The Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy.

History  The oldest settlement in the area of what are now the districts Piotrowice, Podlesie and Zarzecze was Uniczowy, a village that existed already in the 12th century. In the 15th century Uniczowy began to crumble into three distinct parts. Podlesie was first mentioned in 1468 as Uniczowy-Podlesie. During the political upheaval caused by Matthias Corvinus the land around Pszczyna was overtaken by Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn, who sold it in 1517 to the Hungarian magnates of the Thurz√≥ family, forming the Pless state country. In the accompanying sales document issued on 21 February 1517 the village was mentioned as Podlesy Vnicziowy. The Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the War of the Austrian Succession most of Silesia was conquered by the Kingdom of Prussia, including the village.

It stars Shabana Azmi, Konkona Sen Sharma, Soumitra Chatterjee, Waheeda Rehman, Dhritiman Chatterjee, Rahul Bose and Kanwaljeet Singh. Plot 30-something Mitali aka Meethi (Konkona Sen Sharma) suffers from schizophrenia and is taken care of by her older, divorced sister Anjali aka Anu (Shabana Azmi), who is a professor, and their ageing mother (Waheeda Rehman). Although she was never married in real life, Meethi has created her own alternate reality in her mind in which she married her ex-fianc√© Joydeep (Rahul Bose) and has five children. While Anu has dedicated her life to taking care of Meethi and her mother, even putting her own relationship with a fellow professor (Kanwaljeet Singh) on hold, in Meethi's imaginary world both the older women are holding her in the house and away from her husband and children against her will. She imagines her family to be living at the non- existent 15 Park Avenue in Kolkata. After Meethi has a severe seizure, her case is taken up by a new doctor Kunal Barua (Dhritiman Chatterjee). While discussing her sister's case with the new doctor, Anu reveals that though Meethi had dormant schizophrenic traits since childhood, she led a very normal life till her early 20s, before a traumatic experience in the course of her job as a journalist made her withdraw from the outer world. Her fianc√©, unable to deal with the emotional upheaval caused by the incidence, broke off the engagement. On the doctor's advice, Anu takes both women on a vacation to Bhutan, where they are spotted by Joydeep, now married with two children. In her present state, Meethi does not recognize Joydeep as the same man she is married to in her imagination, and befriends him. When Joydeep learns of Meethi's worsened condition and her imaginary world, he offers to help her locate the elusive family home - 15 Park Avenue. Back in Kolkata, Joydeep drives her down to the part of the city where she believes her house and her family are. In a surrealistic climax, Meethi finally locates the house and finds her husband Jojo (as she fondly calls him) and her five children waiting for her return. She walks into the house, reunited with her 'real' family and is never seen again.

A home conversion for the Super Famicom was released the same year. Controlling the Hyper Beat starship, the player is tasked with ridding the galaxy of the Cosmo Gang, a race of aliens that cause mischief across Earth. Gameplay involves shooting enemies and avoiding projectiles. Power-up items can be collected to grant the player additional abilities. It ran on the Namco System 2 arcade board. Cosmo Gang the Video features characters and ideas from Cosmo Gangs, an older Namco redemption game from 1990 that was exported outside Japan by Data East. The game is heavily based on the company's own Galaxian series, with early versions shown at tradeshows being titled Cosmo Galaxian. The arcade version of Cosmo Gang the Video was widely successful and well-received for its graphics, gameplay and music, while the Super Famicom was met with a more mixed response for its simplistic gameplay and lacking replay value. The arcade version was digitally re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2009. It was followed by Cosmo Gang the Puzzle later that same year. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. Cosmo Gang the Video is a fixed shooter arcade game. Up to two players take control of the Hyper Beat starships ‚Äî yellow for player one and white for player two ‚Äî as they must rid the galaxy of the Cosmo Gang, a race of aliens causing mischief across Earth. In the multiplayer mode, one of the players is on top of the other, and share the same number of lives. Gameplay involves shooting down enemies as they fly into formation from the top and sides of the screen. Enemies will dive-bomb towards the bottom of the screen in an attempt to hit the player. Occasionally, a \\"Bakuto\\" alien will appear at the top of the screen while carrying a twin-shot power item, which can be collected by shooting it down. Some enemies will drop special power-up items after being shot, which will give the player one of several abilities when collected ‚Äî these include a one- hit shield, slow-moving bombs, a black hole that brushes all enemies in its area off the screen, and a jack-in-the-box that stuns all on-screen enemies for a brief period of time. In some rare cases, enemies may drop a Special Flag item from Rally-X that gives the player an extra life when collected. Small \\"P\\" items can also be found, which increase the rate of the player's shots when collected. In the multiplayer mode, two other power-up items can appear ‚Äî one of which swaps the positions of the players, and the other allows the player to \\"fill up\\" the other player and make them burst, shooting out a large number of projectiles towards the enemy formation. The game spans 32 stages. Later stages add in several new obstacles, including boxes that fire projectiles at the players, large coins that act as shields for the enemies, and draconic enemies that bring in reinforcements. Some stages are bonus rounds, which are recreations of the original redemption game this title is based upon ‚Äî in these, the players are tasked with keeping the aliens at bay before they latch onto their cargo containers and drag them to the other side of the screen. Bonus points are awarded for each cargo container saved. The 32nd stage features the players fighting Don Cosmo, the final boss. Development and release Cosmo Gang the Video was released in arcades by Namco in March 1992 in Japan, and in North America later that April. It was designed by Kohji Kenjoh, who later worked on the Custom Robo series for Nintendo, and composed by Yoshie Arakawa. The game features characters and mechanics taken from Cosmo Gangs, an older Namco redemption game from 1990 that was later exported outside Japan by Data East. It is heavily based on the company's own Galaxian series in terms of its gameplay and design. One of the game's music tracks is a parody of the opening song for the Japanese cooking show Ky≈çnory≈çri. The game was presented at the 1991 Amusement Machine Show (AMS) tradeshow in Japan under the working title Cosmo Galaxian, alongside Namco's own Solvalou, Tank Force and Steel Gunner 2. A home port for the Super Famicom was released in Japan on October 29, 1992, which was later made available for the Nintendo Power flash cart service on August 1, 1998. The arcade version was digitally re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console on August 4, 2009. Reception Cosmo Gang the Video was widely successful in Japan, being praised for its graphics, gameplay and music. Game Machine listed it on their April 15, 1992 issue as being the sixth most-successful table arcade game of the year. Gamest awarded it both the 8th Best Shooting and 17th Annual Hit Game awards, citing its colorful visuals, cute character designs and gameplay reminiscent of Galaga. In a 2007 retrospective review, Retro Gamer praised the title's colorful visuals and quick-paced gameplay, saying that it was as addictive and well-designed as Namco's earlier arcade title Galaga '88. The Super Famicom version was met with a more mixed reception, with common complaints being towards its gameplay and lack of replay value. Super Play magazine found the game inferior to Galaga '88, saying that it does little to build on the concept established in games such as Space Invaders, Galaxian and Galaga. Super Play also disliked its lack of replay value and its multiplayer mode for not being competitive. They concluded their review by saying \\"Space Invaders is dead, and throwing bucketfuls of pretty graphics, humour and SNES flashiness at it isn't going to help.\\" French publication Game Power criticized the game for repeating level layouts and backgrounds, unfavorably comparing it to Parodius Da! in terms of its art style and graphics. Super Play Gold said that its lack of content and simplistic gameplay didn't make it worth the price point, while SNES Force called it a \\"feeble attempt\\" to rework the gameplay of Space Invaders. Japanese publication Famitsu was more positive in their coverage, finding it to be a faithful home conversion of the arcade original. They also liked its colorful visuals, soundtrack and multiplayer mode. A similar response was echoed by Super Famicom Magazine, who praised its vibrant graphics, catchy soundtrack and addictive gameplay. Super Play was positive towards the game's graphics, humor and lack of slowdown, alongside its \\"hectic\\" bonus stages and useful power-up items. Game Power liked its fast-paced gameplay, visuals and power-up items, Super Play Gold said that fans of the original arcade version would like the Super Famicom conversion for its colorful graphics and cuteness.

It deals with the relationship between a young Greek man Niko and a Turkish girl Nazlƒ±, and the problems (and especially the prejudices) encountered in an intercultural marriage. Its comedic tone and play on historic Greco-Turkish antagonism made it a huge hit in both Turkey and Greece, as well as making stars out of the leading actors. The episodes are shot in Turkey and Greece. The music is Turkish and Greek. The series ran from November 12, 2004 till June 15, 2007 on the Turkish channel Kanal D Friday evenings at 20:00 hrs.

The third season was split, half of the episodes where shown Saturdays of 2007 at 21:00 and the other half episodes are shown in 2008, every Saturday at 17:00. The series used to have great success, especially when the first season was shown. The ratings of the third season are very low, so the channel decided to move the series in the evening schedule. The Bulgarian channel bTV broadcasts it since August 29, 2009 daily at 17:00 hrs. with the title Brak s chujdenets (Marriage with a Foreigner). The series was also dubbed into Arabic with the title Al-Gharib (\\"ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿ±Ÿäÿ®\\", The Stranger) and aired in March 2009 on MBC+ Drama. Plot Nazlƒ± is the daughter of a conservative Turkish father Kahraman, who is a famous baklava maker in Gaziantep. Her grandfather Memik Dede is a Greco- Turkish War veteran.

It lies at the base of the Ochil Hills, around east of Tillicoultry and west of Dollar. History The Harviestoun estate and its original manor house was bought in around 1780 by Edinburgh lawyer John Tait. It was during a visit to Harviestoun in the summer of 1787 that Robert Burns met Charlotte Hamilton, who inspired his poem \\"Fairest Maid on Devon Banks\\". A commemorative cairn on the main road (now the A91) marks his visit. Harviestoun Castle was built in 1804 by Craufurd Tait (1765‚Äì1832) after inheriting the estate from his father in 1800. In 1805 Tait purchased Dollar Glen, including the 15th-century Castle Campbell from the Duke of Argyll. He also constructed a new home farm, coach house and walled garden and moved the main road to Dollar half a mile to the south. Craufurd Tait died in 1832 and was buried in the private family graveyard, now known as Tait's Tomb. The main road takes a wide sweep to its north as a linear route would have obliterated the tomb, which lies midway between Dollar and Tillicoultry. Craufurd's youngest son Archibald Tait (1811‚Äì1882), who was later Archbishop of Canterbury, spent much of his boyhood at Harviestoun. Craufurd's son, Archibald Campbell Tait, who spent his early years at Harviestoun, later became Archbishop of Canterbury. Businessman and former Lord Provost of Glasgow Sir Andrew Orr (1802‚Äì1874) bought the estate in 1859. He added a new tower and porch to the castle, in pink sandstone, and formed two approaches, one leading from Tillicoultry, the other from the East Lodge, situated about one mile west of Dollar. =20th century= After fire destroyed much of the Playfair building at nearby Dollar Academy in 1961, Harviestoun Castle acted briefly as a satellite for Prep (Primary) School classes, as secondary school pupils occupied the Preparatory School building. Much of the castle was 'out of bounds' due to structural problems (possibly dry rot), but was a popular home for pupils of that era, according to accounts in school magazines. The grounds featured extensive gardens framed by two giant sequoia trees on the south lawn, and extensive plantings of rhododendron and bamboo. The castle was demolished in 1970. For a period in the 1970s a small private coal mine operated on the estate.

The squadron, known as the \\"Flying Tigers\\", is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 16 (MAG-16) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). History =Early years= HMH-361 was initially commissioned as Marine Transport Squadron 361 on February 25, 1952 at what was then Marine Corps Air Station Santa Ana, California. The \\"Flying Tigers\\" were attached to the only helicopter group in the Marine Corps, Marine Air Group (HR) - 16. At that time, the squadron consisted of only three OY-2 and one HRS-2 helicopters located at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. The original mission of the squadron was to train for and improve upon amphibious ship-to-shore tactics. An additional mission was training replacement pilots for duty in the Korean War. HMR-361 HRS helicopters over Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, 1953 Shortly thereafter the squadron undertook its first major operation, to provide support for the atomic test exercise at Desert Rock, Nevada which is still the largest helicopter operation in history. Upon their return, HMR-361 was transferred to the newly established MAG (HR)-36 at MCAF Santa Ana in 1953. On December 31, 1956, the squadron was redesignated HMR(l)-361 and was now flying the HRS-3 helicopter. The Flying Tigers participated in two more atomic bomb testing exercises, beginning in June 1957 and February 1958. In September 1958, the squadron began flying the H-34 helicopter and in 1960 performed the first West Coast parachute drop for Marine Pathfinders from the H-34. On February 1, 1962, the Flying Tigers were redesignated HMM-361 according to a Marine Corps wide redesignation for all H-34 squadrons. HMM-361 deployed for the Cuban Missile Crisis on October 27, 1962, in support of the 5th Marine Expeditionary Force onboard the USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2). =Vietnam War= In June 1963, the Flying Tigers were deployed to Okinawa, Japan. The one-year deployment was cut short, however, when the squadron was transferred to Da Nang Air Base, Republic of Vietnam, as one of the first units in-country, to participate in Operation Shufly. It was there that HMM-361 earned the nickname \\"Ross's Rice Runners\\", after their commanding officer, LtCol Tom Ross. On August 12, 1965, the squadron conducted the first nighttime helicopter assault by Marines during the war when they lifted 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines into a landing zone 10 miles northwest of Da Nang during Operation Midnight. On September 3, 1967, HMM-361 had 17 of its aircraft destroyed by enemy artillery while they were parked at ƒê√¥ng H√† Combat Base. This incident would lead to their transfer south to the Marble Mountain Air Facility. The squadron served in Vietnam until being transferred back to the U.S. and attached to Marine Aircraft Group 26 at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina. It was there that the squadron transitioned to the CH-53A Sea Stallion helicopter and was redesignated Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron, HMH-361. They were again ordered to Vietnam with Marine Aircraft Group 36 at Phu Bai Combat Base in 1969 and remained there until their return to the newly redesignated Marine Corps Air Station (H) Santa Ana, CA in 1970 as part of Marine Aircraft Group 16. =Postwar and the 1980s= HMH-361 received their first CH-53D Sea Stallion helicopter in 1977, and on June 1, 1979, made their first squadron to deploy overseas as part of the new Unit Deployment Program, completing the first of twelve, six-month WestPac deployments on December 3, 1979. In October 1984 the squadron became the first 3rd MAW helicopter squadron to train under the squadron training exercise and employment plan. Finishing this training in May 1985, HMH-361 attained the highest Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation System (MCCRES) grade to date for a rotary wing squadron. During the squadron's ensuing six WestPac deployments under the UDP, HMH-361 accomplished the first overwater flight to NAS Cubi Point, Republic of the Philippines. =The 1990s= A CH-53 from HMH-361 training in Okinawa in 1995. Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361 began conversion to the CH-53E Super Stallion on August 23, 1990. On November 5, 1992, the Flying Tigers deployed to Okinawa as the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, the first MEU to utilize a CH-53E squadron as the nucleus. Here they were joined by detachments of CH-46E's from HMM-262, AH-1W's, and UH-1N's from HMLA-267, and AV-8B's from VMA-311 to become HMH-361 (REIN), the first CH-53E composite squadron in history. A CH-53E Super Stallion from HMH-361 flying off the coast o Camp Pendleton, California. The Flying Tigers again made history in November 1994 when they were quadruple sited while on their tenth deployment to Okinawa. Detachments were sent to the 13th and 31st MEU's, the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground task force in support of Operation United Shield while the main body remained on Okinawa. In August 1995, the Flying Tigers were awarded the Marine Corps Aviation Association's Keith B McCutcheon award as Marine Heavy Helicopter squadron of the year and in June 1996 were awarded the 1995 CNO Aviation Association Safety Award. After returning from Okinawa and reintegrating its MEU detachments in May 1997, HMH-361 assumed the Alert Contingency Marine air-ground task force (ACM) status. Once again the Flying Tigers were awarded the Marine Corps Aviation Association's Keith B McCutcheon award as Marine Heavy Helicopter squadron of the year. The squadron also supported HMX-1 and the President of the United States, transporting three CH-53E's to San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina, aboard Air Force C-5 Galaxy aircraft. =Global War on Terror= On January 26, 2005, a CH-53E Super Stallion from the unit crashed near Ar Rutbah, Iraq killing all 31 service members on board. In October 2008 HMH-361 deployed to the Al Anbar Province, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Based out of Al Asad Air Base, the squadron was responsible for multiple assault support missions and sorties, as well as delivery of troops, supplies, weapons support, and even delivery of troop mail. The squadron also carried out Angel Flight missions and (QRF) or Quick Reaction Force. The squadron maintained a combat readiness above 95% during the deployment and was later awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation for its distinguished efforts while in the theater. The unit returned home to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California in late May 2008 (advanced party} and early June 2008 (main body). In February 2009, HMH-361 deployed to the Al Anbar Province, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Operating out of Al Asad Air Base, the squadron was responsible for multiple assault support missions and sorties, as well as delivery of troops, supplies, weapons support, and even delivery of troop mail. The squadron also carried out Angel Flight missions, MAGTF Support/Raid Missions, and (QRF) or Quick Reaction Force. The squadron maintained a combat readiness above 93% during the deployment and was later awarded another Meritorious Unit Citation for its distinguished efforts while in the theater. The unit returned home to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, CA in late July 2009 (advanced party) and early September 2009 (main body). In August 2010 HMH-361 deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. They are based at Camp Leatherneck and returned to the States in early 2011. In August 2012 HMH-361 again deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, where they took part in fending off a Taliban attack on the British Camp Bastion airfield on 14 September 2012. The squadron returned to the United States in February 2013. In April 2013, upon return from their deployment to Afghanistan, HMH-361 was announced as the recipient of the Keith B McCutcheon Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron of the year award.

People say that when Mughal King Aurangzeb would pass through any city with his army to capture India and if he would not find any mosque Masjid (place of prayers for Muslims), he would destroy the whole city or village. When he was passing through Deccan south part of India or Aurangabad, he also passed Yeola City. A fear erupted in small Yeola City. People of Yeola City were worried about this since no single Muslim live in Yeola City and so there was no mosque or masjid. Raghuji Baba gathered some people and they built a Mosque. But after building the Mosque fear was not gone. Because there were no Muslims in city. He gathered some Muslim from surrounding area, and brought them to Yeola City. First mosque of Yeola city which called Patel ki Masjid and which is located in Bhaldar Galli near Samadhi of Raghuji Baba. This mosque was built by Hindu. Yeola municipal council is one of the oldest municipal councils in India. It was formed in 1857. \\\\- Broogle Demographics India census, Yeola had a population of 43,205.

Inserted into the host PC's USB port, the connector functions with the Nintendo DS, Wii, and DSi, permitting the user to connect to the Internet to play Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games and access various other online functionality. The product was the best selling Nintendo accessory to date, according to the official Nintendo site on 15 November 2007, but was discontinued in the same month until further notice. On September 8, 2008, Nintendo announced the Nintendo Wi-Fi Network Adapter, a 802.11g wireless router/bridge which serves a similar purpose.http://wifi.nintendo.co.jp/wap/index.html Functionality The Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector is a rebranded Buffalo WLI-U2-KG54-YB (although this is often confused for the Buffalo WLI-U2-KG54-AI - the two adapters are almost identical, and only differ in that the latter features flash memory to allow for auto installation) which is based on the Ralink RT2570 chipset and as such is different from most other Wi-Fi adapters in that it can operate as a software access point (also referred to as a soft AP). Few adapters could do this under Windows at the time of the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector's release; Windows lacked both the software necessary to configure a soft AP and capable drivers for natively supported hardware. By bundling a soft AP compatible device with their own proprietary software, Nintendo was able to overcome this and at the same time greatly simplify the otherwise complicated process of putting a supported device into soft AP mode, configuring it, and routing Internet traffic over it. In addition, a number of community developed tools and drivers exist which expand the functionality of the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector beyond its initial design. While not officially supported by Nintendo, the USB Connector can function as a standard wireless adapter by using modified Ralink or Buffalo Technology drivers, and can be used to send official game demos and homebrew software to the Nintendo DS through the Wireless Multi Boot (WMB) protocol. Criticism There have been a number of complaints and criticisms made of the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector since its release. While the device works as advertised for the majority of users, there have been some complaints brought up about its design and functionality. These users often fall outside of the target audience for the Wi-Fi USB Connector (namely Microsoft Windows users without a pre-existing wireless network or the technical expertise to configure one.) =Proprietary authentication= One criticism of the Wi-Fi USB Connector is that it uses a proprietary authentication mechanism. Because of this, the Wi-Fi USB Connector works only with approved devices, which at this time is limited to the DS and Wii consoles. This behavior was an intentional design decision on the part of Nintendo, as it prevents outside parties from connecting to the Wi-Fi USB Connector with their computers and accessing the user's Internet connection or computer. While the Wi-Fi USB Connector can be modified to circumvent this, the modification is beyond the capability of most users and is naturally unsupported by Nintendo. =Operating system support= Initially, the Wi-Fi USB Connector only supported Microsoft Windows XP. A main concern at that time was the lack of support for older versions of Windows, principally Windows 2000. After the introduction of the Windows Vista operating system, however, criticism shifted to lack of support for the new platform. Though Vista drivers were eventually released by Nintendo of Europe and Nintendo of America, it was two years after the first Windows XP drivers were available and several months after Vista's launch. There is no official support for Windows 7/8/10 (although it is possible to install working drivers when under compatibility mode). It is possible to use the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector as a USB Wi-Fi NIC to connect to other access points under Linux and BSD when using the appropriate drivers. Notably, Debian and Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu have out of the box support for the chipset in the device. Additionally, there is currently no official support for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, or driver for the 64-bit versions of Windows XP or Windows Vista; there are only drivers for 32-bit versions of these operating systems. =Internet connection sharing= The core functionality of the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector is provided by Windows' Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) feature, which allows a Windows computer to act as a router and automatically configure client devices for Internet access. Unfortunately, due to limitations in ICS, there are a number of caveats with this method. Like the Wi-Fi USB Connector software itself, ICS offers the user no configurable options. This means that ICS may not function as expected, or at all, in complex network environments. In addition, Windows cannot handle multiple ICS configurations simultaneously, or in other words, only a single application or network device can use and configure ICS at one time. This means that if your network is currently relying on ICS or you use software that utilizes it (such as Windows Media Center Extender for the Xbox 360), you may not be able to use the Wi-Fi USB Connector at all. =Software firewall compatibility= Though not an innate fault with the Wi-Fi USB Connector itself, due to the nature of the device, a software firewall like those commonly installed on Microsoft Windows computers hosting the Wi-Fi USB Connector will interfere with its operation. To alleviate this issue, the user must allow the software full access to the Internet, or manually specify acceptable port ranges to allow through the firewall; depending on how that particular firewall is configured. Unfortunately, some firewall products (like ZoneAlarm, and Windows Live OneCare) are incompatible with the Wi-Fi USB Connector software and must be either uninstalled or disabled, leaving the computer open to possible attack from external sources. The user's only option in this scenario is to risk connecting to the Internet unprotected, or install a different firewall product. =Network topology= A common complaint from more advanced users is the complete lack of user-configurable options in the Wi-Fi USB Connector software and installer. For the novice user this is seen as a much-welcomed advantage of the Wi-Fi USB Connector over a traditional wireless router, but for those users who wish to use the device in a more complicated network environment, it can be an insurmountable obstacle. For example, the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector will cause an IP conflict if an existing network is using the 192.168.0.x or 192.168.1.x IP schemes, both common IP ranges used in consumer routers. Packaging The Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector includes a USB extension cable, a manual, and a software CD. It is recommended that the latest version of the Wi-Fi USB Connector software should be downloaded and installed rather than using the version on the CD, as important updates have been made in the newer versions. Devices shipped with software driver versions below 1.05 are incompatible with Windows Vista until updated. Discontinuation While Nintendo hasn't come forward explaining the reason for the discontinuation of the device, manufacturers Buffalo Technology are reportedly no longer licensed to distribute it due to a successful recent lawsuit by the Australian Government's technology research agency CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation). As a result, the company has been prevented from trading in any products adhering to the 802.11a/g standards in the US, including the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector. Nintendo, however, only states on their website that the device is discontinued and says that a standard wireless router should work with the Wii. Here is their official statement: \\"Please note: The Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector has been discontinued until further notice. As an alternative for on-line access, Wii owners can use a standard wireless router, or the Wii LAN Adapter.\\" References External links * Latest Software for the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector USB Connector Wii accessories Wi-Fi Wireless networking USB sv:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection#Anslutning ","title":"Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector"},{"id":"3818680","text":"VZW may refer to: * Verizon Wireless, a mobile (cellular) telecommunications company * Association without lucrative purpose, from the Belgian vereniging zonder winstoogmerk ","title":"VZW"},{"id":"3818684","text":"The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Trust is a charitable trust based in Wellington, New Zealand, and is actively restoring former Wellington and Manawatu Railway locomotive No.9 (later N 453 under government ownership), to full working order. The trust The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Trust was formed to recover and restore former Wellington and Manawatu Railway locomotive No. 9, a Baldwin 2-6-2 from 1891. The Trust has so far managed to recover the locomotive and is in the process of restoring the locomotive. While the Trust's primary focus is No.9, it is also interested in the welfare of remaining Wellington and Manawatu Railway relics which have managed to survive into the modern day. The trust also owns a former Wellington and Manawatu Railway 4-wheel wagon, which is presently stored at the Silver Stream Railway, Upper Hutt. No.9 is the only known surviving Wellington and Manawatu Railway locomotive. The locomotive Built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia in 1891, Maker's No. 12104, Baldwin ID 10 24 1/4 D9 was one of two wheel arrangement locomotives constructed for the Wellington and Manawatu Railway, and was given the road number 9. No.9 and sister No.10 were constructed to a virtually identical design as the NZR N class of 1885, with notable differences including lengthened smokeboxes, spoked carrying wheels and no air brakes. They were based at the WMR's Paekakariki depot, and were used primarily to haul mixed passenger and freight trains over the relatively easily graded Paekakariki - Longburn section of the company's line. In 1892, No.10 set a World Speed Record for the gauge of 64.4 mph (103.6 km/h), underlining the type's pedigree. In 1901 No's 9 & 10 were retrofitted with Westinghouse air brakes as part of the company's drive to fit continuous braking to its entire fleet, completed in 1902. All other changes to the two locos during WMR service were minor, such as replacement of the original pressed steel & copper funnels in cast iron. In December 1908 the Wellington and Manawatu Railway was purchased by the New Zealand Government and incorporated into the government railway system. No.9 was then classified and renumbered N 453. For this role, her WMR insignia was removed, NZR number plates added, tablet hooks were fitted to the cab and the smokebox front replaced with a standard NZR design. She continued to be based at Paekakariki until 1916 when she was shipped to Greymouth in the South Island, where she saw service hauling the Greymouth - Otira mail trains. Her wooden cab was replaced at this stage in steel, and acetylene lighting replaced the original kerosene. In the early 1920s she was relegated to shunting and banking duties at Otira. For work in this role, 453 was fitted with back up sanding and a tender-cab, with the tender coal flare cut off and ladders fitted to access the tender body. In 1925 N 453's original boiler was removed and replaced with a new NZR built boiler. Despite this, in November 1926 No.9 was withdrawn from service, dismantled and tipped into the Bealey River on the Midland Line to check erosion. Why the locomotive was removed from service is not known, however all useful and re-usable components from the locomotive were removed, including the boiler which saw further service on Wb 300. Recovery of an engine By the end of the 20th century, most of the once numerous locomotive remains in the Bealey River valley had been scrapped or buried in river protection works. No.9 was the only engine left unaffected, but with an uncertain future. In 2003, the Trust began recovering the remnants of No. 9 from where it had been dumped near Arthur's Pass along the Midland Line. The locomotive had been dismantled and dumped in November 1926, to stabilise the railway embankment and to try and prevent floods from eroding the formation. The first item recovered was the locomotive frame and cylinders, which were trucked to the Canterbury Steam Preservation Society at McLeans Island, Christchurch. In 2006 the locomotive tender, truck frames and other associated items which had been uncovered were trucked from the dump site to be stored with the frame. The parts were then trucked to Steam Incorporated, Paekakariki (site of the former WMR depot where No.9 was based) on 26 February 2007, where restoration has commenced. It is unlikely there is anything more worthy of salvage from the dump site for No.9. The original boiler from No.9 has been located at the Oxford Boiler Dump, but is not worthy of salvage and re-use. Restoration No.9s tender chassis reassembled and on the rails for the first time since it was dumped. Taken on 21 May 2009. In 2006 the Trust signed an agreement with Steam Incorporated, and once No.9 had been moved there restoration began in earnest, with the initial focus being on restoring the tender before tackling the locomotive proper. As a part of the agreement with Steam Incorporated, No.9 is being restored to main line operating standard so that it can be used on the national rail network. While the Trust has managed to acquire a large number of items for use on the locomotive, a new boiler will be required and it is likely new driving wheels will have to be manufactured, as none were recovered with the locomotive from the dump site. By May 2009, the tender frame and bogies had been completely rebuilt and reassembled. Other projects The Wellington and Manawatu Railway also owns a 4-wheel wooden-framed wagon of WMR vintage, which is currently stored at the Silver Stream Railway, Upper Hutt. The class of this wagon has yet to be conclusively identified, however it is the Trust's intention to have this wagon restored in due course.

It is 51 km north east of Adelaide and 16 km south-east of Gawler. Williamstown was originally known as Victoria Creek.Rodney Cockburn, Stewart Cockburn South Australia ‚Äî What's in a Name? Axiom Publishing 1990 The township was laid out in 1858 by Lewis Johnston, or Johnstone, on land he purchased in 1857, and named for his son. Williamstown has an elevation of 310 m and an average rainfall of 680 mm. It has a summer average temperature of 31 ¬∞C with temperatures often reaching the mid 40s, and a winter average temperature of 15 ¬∞C, with nights dropping below freezing, which makes the region excellent for the cultivation of fruits, especially grapes in the lower riverine alluvial deposits.  History  Williamstown was essentially a farming area with sheep and cattle in the early days with fruit orchards, mixed farms and vines. Williamstown also sustained a forestry and lumber industry from the earliest days with three sawmills. Today only a small family-owned timber sawmill and Cooperage remains with the closure of the two larger mills by 1990. Many local residents work in the wine / viticulture industry throughout the Barossa Valley. In the Australian Federation Year (1901) a local hay barn found along Yettie Road (formerly Yatta Creek Road) inhabited only by ducks and pigeons was discovered to be the remains of the alleged oldest slab and stone homestead in South Australia (circa 1841) which has been carefully restored to its former glory. Springfield Homestead, along Springton Road, was originally the home of local land baron pastoralist, BJ MacLachlan, who was a contemporary of the more famous Australian pastoral entrepreneurs and cattle barons such as Kidman. His great-great grandchildren still live at the historic Homestead. They operate one of the largest stations in Australia at Commonwealth Hill. The nearby South Para Reservoir was built in the early 1950s to help supply Adelaide with its demanding domestic water supplies, supplementing the earlier Warren Reservoir and Barossa Reservoir. The curved dam retaining wall at the Barossa Reservoir, known as the Whispering Wall because of its acoustic properties, is a tourist attraction. The Barossa Goldfields, scene of a gold rush in 1868 (as well as some smaller rushes later), lie to the west of the Barossa Reservoir. A handful of 'boutique' tourist gold mining operation were started around 1985 near Sandy Creek and the Barossa Goldfields. Williamstown is considered to be a 'Southern gateway' town into the Barossa Valley. It has one of the oldest public house hotels in South Australia dating from 1841 and several original farm homesteads built by the first homesteaders from rough-cut slab timber. One excellent example of this can be found along Warren Road towards Kersbrook. In the late summer of 1956 Williamstown was struck by a 3.6 magnitude earthquake that lasted for almost eight minutes and caused structural damaged to many of the stone structures and brick buildings in the area. Domestic wells and sweetwater springs in the area dried up for several weeks thereafter due to the many landslips and seismic movements below the surrounding Gawler Ranges. In 1970 Williamstown hosted one of the last performances of the Barnum & Baily, Ringling Brothers Circus in the original Big Top at the Oval where their performing elephants were enjoyed along with 'the world's smallest horse' at just over five hands high.  Description  In the springtime, Williamstown is seen at its best, with a carpet of green grass and wildflowers along the many creeks and thick woodlands covering the low-rolling hills around the town, dotted with large dairy pastures and vineyards. To the East and South, Williamstown is skirted with Forestry Commission plantations open for public access, in certain areas, large swathes of National Park and the Hale Conservation Park for walkers and hikers. The Williamstown Oval is set in the welcome summer-shade of a large wooded hill in a small valley fed by crystal clear cold-water springs that feed the Victoria Creek stream that passes through the town centre. At the Oval there is a picnic area and small caravan park, serving visitors and transient workers, overlooking the local Football Clubhouse and 1950s-era public swimming pool. Williamstown is in the Barossa Council local government area, the state electoral district of Schubert and the federal Division of Barker.

Symptoms The diagnosis is generally clinical, with a fluctuant boggy mass developing over the scalp (especially over the occiput) with superficial skin bruising. The swelling develops gradually 12‚Äì72 hours after delivery, although it may be noted immediately after delivery in severe cases. Subgaleal hematoma growth is insidious, as it spreads across the whole calvaria and may not be recognized for hours to days. If enough blood accumulates, a visible fluid wave may be seen. Patients may develop periorbital ecchymosis (\\"raccoon eyes\\"). Patients with subgaleal hematoma may present with hemorrhagic shock given the volume of blood that can be lost into the potential space between the skull periosteum and the scalp galea aponeurosis, which has been found to be as high as 20-40% of the neonatal blood volume in some studies. The swelling may obscure the fontanel and cross cranial suture lines, (distinguishing it from cephalohematoma). Patients with subgaleal hemorrhage may also have significant hyperbilirubinemia due to resorption of hemolyzed blood. Laboratory studies may demonstrate reduced hemoglobin and hematocrit due to blood loss into the subgaleal space, and coagulation studies may reflect an underlying coagulopathy. Mortality has been reported to occur in 12-14% of cases, generally as a consequence of massive blood loss presenting with shock, often in the setting of uncorrected coagulopathy. However, with early identification and prompt treatment, the prognosis is good, and there are usually no long- term consequences. Causes The majority of neonatal cases (90%) result from applying a vacuum to the head at delivery (ventouse-assisted delivery). The vacuum assist ruptures the emissary veins (i.e., connections between dural sinus and scalp veins) leading to accumulation of blood under the aponeurosis of the scalp muscle and superficial to the periosteum.AAP Textbook of Pediatrics Additionally, subgaleal hematoma has a high frequency of occurrence of associated head trauma (40%), such as intracranial hemorrhage or skull fracture. The occurrence of these features does not correlate significantly with the severity of subgaleal hemorrhage. Diagnosis Early recognition of this injury is crucial for survival. Infants who have experienced a difficult operative delivery or are suspected to have a SGH require ongoing monitoring including frequent vital signs (minimally every hour), and serial measurements of hematocrits and their occipital frontal circumference, which increases 1 cm with each 40 mL of blood deposited into the subgaleal space. Head imaging, using either CT or MRI, can be useful for differentiating subgaleal hemorrhage from other sources of cranial bleeding. Head ultrasound is useful for the diagnosis of SGH in the hands of an operator experienced in imaging the neonatal head and scalp, and is preferable to CT due to lack of ionizing radiation. Coagulation studies are required to detect coagulopathy that may be associated with the bleeding. Management Management consists of vigilant observation over days to detect progression and, if required, of management of complications (e.g., hemorrhagic shock, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice from hemolyzed red blood cells). The subgaleal space is capable of holding up to 40% of a newborn baby's blood and can therefore result in acute shock and death. Fluid bolus may be required if blood loss is significant and patient becomes tachycardic. Transfusion and phototherapy may be necessary. Investigation for coagulopathy may be indicated.

Biography Blunck was born in 1798 in M√ºnsterdorf in Holstein, at that time a duchy with a largely German-speaking populace ruled by Denmark. In 1814 he began his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen as a student of C.A. Lorentzen and C.W. Eckersberg. He was trained concurrently with fellow students Wilhelm Bendz, Ernst Meyer, and Albert K√ºchler. Presumably dissatisfied with the Danish Academy, Blunck moved in 1818 to Munich and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. He studied in Bavaria for two years before returning to Copenhagen. Back in Denmark, Blunck became a student of the recently appointed J. L. Lund, a Romantic historical painter who was to become a major influence on his development. Thus, it was also mostly history painting that marked Blunck's early work. Later, through genre painting, Blunck became representative of the kind of everyday realism that was to appear in Danish art in the mid-1820s. Lund's influence grew particularly clear during Blunck's stay in Germany beginning in 1828. In Berlin, Munich, and Dresden, he became acquainted with Lund's artist-friends, including the famed Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich. He was, however, more influenced by the works of Johann Friedrich Overbeck in changing his artistic direction. Blunck began to devote himself to religious motifs and developed a painting style that was strongly influenced by the Nazarene movement, unusual among Danish painters. Blunck's sojourns abroad also brought him repeatedly to Rome. Here, he joined the group of Danish artists around Bertel Thorvaldsen and produced several of his major paintings, including Danish Artists in the Roman Inn La Gensola (1837). In 1841, he was expelled from Denmark due to homosexual acts.http://www.nivaagaard.dk/en/samling- en/ditlev-blunck-2/ As a result, he left the country, and he even took up arms against Denmark in the First Schleswig War (1848-1852). Despite being persona non grata in Denmark, he was commissioned by King Christian VIII of Denmark to paint the four-part cycle \\"The Ages of Man\\" for the Royal Painting Collection.

In 1896, she enrolled at the University of Adelaide, where she studied medicine. After graduating, Mayo spent two years working in infant health in England, Ireland and India. She returned to Adelaide in 1906, starting a private practice and taking up positions at the Adelaide Children's Hospital and Adelaide Hospital (later the Royal Adelaide). In 1909, she co-founded the School for Mothers, where mothers could receive advice on infant health. This organisation, which became the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association in 1927, eventually established branches across South Australia and incorporated a training school for maternal nurses. In 1914, after unsuccessfully campaigning for the Children's Hospital to treat infants, Mayo co-founded the Mareeba Hospital for infants. In addition to her medical achievements, Mayo participated in a number of other organisations. She was heavily involved in the University of Adelaide, serving on the university council from 1914 to 1960 (the first woman in Australia to be elected to such a position) and establishing a women's club and boarding college there. She was also the founder of the Adelaide Lyceum Club, an organisation for professional women. Mayo died on 13 November 1967, with the Medical Journal of Australia attributing the success of South Australia's infant welfare system to her efforts.  Early life and education  180px Helen Mary Mayo was born in Adelaide, Australia on 1 October 1878.Covernton 1968. She was the eldest of the seven children of George Gibbes Mayo (1845‚Äì1921), a civil engineer, and Henrietta Mary Mayo, n√©e Donaldson, (1852‚Äì1930)Hicks, 1986, Australian Dictionary of Biography. and granddaughter of George Mayo, a prominent Adelaide doctor, and Maria Gandy. Her formal education commenced at the age of 10, when she began receiving regular lessons with a tutor. At the age of 16, she was enrolled in the Advanced School for Girls on Grote Street (a forerunner of Adelaide High School), from which she matriculated after one year, at the end of 1895. Despite never having heard of female doctors, from an early age Mayo had been set on pursuing a career in medicine.Mackinnon 1986, p. 61. However, Edward Rennie, then a professor at the University of Adelaide advised Helen's father that she was too young to commence study in Medicine, so in 1896, Mayo enrolled in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Adelaide. The death of her younger sister Olive at the end of her first year of study meant that Mayo was unable to sit her final exams for that year, and when she repeated her first year in 1897, she failed two of her five subjects (Latin and Greek). Having gained her father's permission, Mayo enrolled in medicine in 1898. She was a distinguished medicine student, coming top of her class and winning the Davis Thomas scholarship and the Everard Scholarship in her fourth and fifth years of study, respectively.  Medical career  Upon her graduation at the end of 1902, Mayo took up a position as a resident medical officer at the Adelaide Hospital. In February 1904, she left for England to gain practical experience.Mackinnon 1986, p. 63. There she worked as a clinical clerk at the Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street, London. To gain experience in midwifery, she went to Coombe Women's Hospital in Dublin, and after returning to London to complete a course in tropical medicine, she travelled to India where she worked for a year as a midwife in a Cambridge Mission to Delhi hospital for women and children.Denholm 1991. In 1906, Mayo returned to Adelaide and started a private practice in premises owned by her father on Morphett Street, next to the family home.Mackinnon 1986, p. 65. With spare time on her hands, she began laboratory work at the Adelaide Hospital and took up an appointment as honorary anaesthetist at the Adelaide Children's Hospital. = Mothers' and Babies' Health Association = In May 1909, Mayo presented a paper to an interstate conference on the subject of infant mortality. In it, she addressed the high infant mortality rate in South Australia, and claimed that more needed to be done to educate women for motherhood.Hicks 1986, \\"Private medicine and public health\\". Later that year, after hearing a talk about the success of a school for mothers in London, she and Harriet Stirling (the daughter of Edward Stirling) founded the School for Mothers in Adelaide. The Kindergarten Union made a room in its offices available for one afternoon a week, where a nurse would weigh babies and Mayo and Stirling would give advice. At the first annual meeting of the School a prominent medical doctor criticised the organisation for thinking that spinsters could teach mothers, who were guided by the \\"mother instinct\\" (both Mayo and Stirling were childless). In spite of this, the organisation flourished, and in 1911 a cottage in Wright Street was purchased and became the headquarters of the School. In 1927, the organisation became the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association (MBHA), and by 1932, it had branches throughout South Australia. Mayo's colleagues during this period included Dr. Marie Brown (1883‚Äì1949). Mayo served as the honorary medical officer of the association until her death in 1967, by which time the organisation gained a training school for maternal nurses and a hospital. In her honour, the Association inaugurated the annual Helen Mayo lecture. Eventually, in 1981, the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association was incorporated into the Department of Health of the South Australian Government. After visiting Melbourne to learn how to make vaccines, in 1911 Mayo was appointed clinical bacteriologist at the Adelaide Hospital, a position she would hold for 22 years. = Mareeba Hospital = left In the early part of the 1910s, there was an urgent need for medical facilities to treat infants in South Australia since, due to the risks of cross-infection, the Adelaide Children's Hospital would not treat those under the age of two. In 1913, Mayo and Stirling called a meeting of medical practitioners to discuss the prospect of a hospital for these children. After doubts about the practicality of such a plan were expressed, the group raised some funds and presented to the board of the Adelaide Children's Hospital a plan to use the funds to build a separate ward on the grounds of the hospital. The board rejected the proposal, so Mayo and her group rented a two-storey house in St. Peter's and opened a hospital for infants in 1914. Financial difficulties for the hospital eventually became overwhelming and the state government took over the hospital, moving it to Woodville and renaming it the Mareeba Hospital. Mayo played a central role in establishing Mareeba Hospital and forming its policy, serving as honorary physician, and as honorary responsible officer from 1921 to 1946. To combat the risks of cross-infection, she instituted a policy of strict isolation of babies from other patients. Each child had their own locker, where their own equipment would be kept, gowns used by nurses to tend to one child would only be used for that child, and blankets, bottles and floors were all sterilised.MacKinnon, p. 66. Mareeba eventually became a 70-bed hospital, complete with a surgical unit and a ward for premature babies. = Later medical career = In 1919, The Adelaide Children's Hospital advertised for honorary physicians. Believing that her gender would prevent her being given the position, Mayo initially declined to apply. However, following a recommendation by Adelaide surgeon Henry Simpson Newland, Mayo applied for the post, and that year was appointed honorary Assistant Physician in charge of outpatients. With positions at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, the Children's Hospital and the Mareeba Hospital, as well as commitments at her private practice, Mayo commenced her Doctor of Medicine degree in 1925.MacKinnon, p. 67. She used her experiences as a clinical bacteriologist at the Adelaide Hospital as the basis for her thesis, which she was forced to write on the weekends, such was the volume of her workload. The following year, she became the first woman to receive an MD from the University of Adelaide. She was subsequently appointed honorary physician to inpatients at the Children's Hospital, and a clinical lecturer at the University of Adelaide. In May 1935 Mayo was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) \\"for services in connection with maternal and child welfare in the state of South Australia.\\" She retired in 1938 and became an honorary consulting physician at the Children's Hospital, but when the Second World War broke out, she returned to the hospital as senior paediatric adviser, at the same time organising the Red Cross donor transfusion service. Dr Elma Linton Sandford-Morgan (22 February 1890 ‚Äì 1983), author of ABC of Mothercraft, was appointed medical officer for MBHA in 1937. She was a daughter of industrialist and politician A. Wallace Sandford.  Other activities  The University of Adelaide Council in 1919. Helen Mayo is first on the right in the front row. Mayo became the first woman in Australia to be elected to a university council when, in 1914, she was elected to the Council of the University of Adelaide, a position she held for 46 years. She founded, in 1922, the Adelaide Lyceum Club, and was its inaugural president. The club provided a place for women who were leaders in their respective fields to meet, and aimed to \\"advance the status of women in the world of arts and letters\\".MacKinnon, p. 69. Mayo was also heavily involved in the life of female students and graduates of the University of Adelaide. She spearheaded the foundation of the Women Student's Club (eventually the Women's Union) in 1909,Finnis 1973, p. 81. and in 1921 initiated efforts to unify the various student bodies at that University into what would eventually become the Adelaide University Union.Finnis 1973, p. 116. The construction of the Lady Simon Building for the Women's Union was due in large part to her efforts,Finnis 1973, p 128. as was the founding of St. Ann's College, where she served as chairperson from 1939 to 1959. Mayo died 13 November 1967, aged 89. In its obituary, the Medical Journal of Australia described her as \\"the doyen of medical women in South Australia (and most probably Australia)\\", and credited her with the efficiency of South Australia's infant health welfare system. Helen Mayo Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Bonython is named in her honour, as is the Federal Division of Mayo. Family Helen never married.

It is the first locomotive purchased by the Southern Pacific Railroad, carrying that railroad's number 1. The locomotive is named in honor of Collis P. Huntington, the third president of the Southern Pacific Company (parent company of Southern Pacific Railroad). History and career C. P. Huntington was originally purchased by Central Pacific Railroad (CP) in 1863 as that railroad's number 3, along with its sister engine T. D. Judah (CP no. 4). It was CP's third locomotive after Gov. Stanford (number 1, built by Norris Locomotive Works) and Pacific (number 2, built by Mason Machine Works). CP used the locomotive beginning on April 15, 1864, during construction of the western portion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in North America. Southern Pacific (SP) purchased C. P. Huntington from CP on February 5, 1871, gave it their number 1, and used it in light service in northern California. It was rebuilt twice, first in 1873 with new valves and again in 1888 with a new boiler built by CP's Sacramento shops. In 1888 the locomotive was also put on public display for the first time in Sacramento. In SP's 1891 renumbering plan, C. P. Huntington was assigned road number 1001. The locomotive was placed in storage for some time until it was rebuilt for use as a lineside weed burner in 1901. Its use as a weed burner proved unsatisfactory and the locomotive was again removed from active service. In 1910, C. P. Huntington was again rebuilt and it was then kept at SP's machine shops where it remained for a few years. The locomotive was nearly scrapped in 1914; it was spared this fate by SP management so that it could be displayed at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in 1915 after a cosmetic restoration. On May 3, 1939, C. P. Huntington participated in the grand opening ceremonies for the Los Angeles Union Station. Operating under her own steam, the Huntington was paraded past large, cheering crowds to the newly completed passenger terminal, along with several other engines, including the famous 4-4-0, Virginia & Truckee 22, the Inyo (still painted in Union Pacific livery, from the filming of Cecil B. DeMille's 1939 movie of the same name, which premiered two days later), and Southern Pacific 4120, a massive AC-5 class 4-8-8-2 cab forward. The moment was captured on film by Disney animator and lifelong train enthusiast, Ward Kimball, and may be some of the only known footage of the engine under steam.Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Kimball Family Collection Southern Pacific donated the engine to the State of California in 1964. The locomotive was placed on display at the old state fairgrounds on Stockton Boulevard, in Sacramento, where it remained until a 1970 refurbishing at Southern Pacific's Sacramento Shops, when it was placed in the Central Pacific Railroad Passenger Station in Old Sacramento in 1979. In 1981 it was moved into the newly opened California State Railroad Museum, where it now remains on static display. Working replicas Chance Rides began to fabricate their narrow gaugeChance Rides C. P. Huntington Train Specs C. P. Huntington locomotive in 1960. These locomotives are powered by a gasoline, diesel, propane or electric engine. The engine is powered to an automatic transmission, which controls a 90* drop down gearbox that powers drive shafts to the front and rear power trucks. Its drive wheels are not powered, but roll on the rails while fake side rods reciprocate in and out of fake cylinders. The false drive wheels have been removed by some owners for ease of maintenance. This has been the most popular park train since The Allan Herschell Company merged into Chance Industries and production of the S-24 Iron Horse train ceased. Many amusement parks are replacing their steam locomotives with these locomotives since they are easier to maintain and operate. The first C. P. Huntington locomotive was delivered to the now- defunct Joyland Amusement Park in Wichita, Kansas. This replaced the original miniature train that has operated since 1933. As the first locomotive, it carries the serial number 1 from the factory. The Lincoln Children's Zoo in Lincoln, Nebraska, operates a narrow gauge C. P. Huntington locomotive on its ZO&O; Railroad train ride around the park. Established in 1963 as the Iron Horse Railroad, the first C. P. Huntington locomotive was delivered to the Lincoln Children's Zoo founder, Arnot R. Folsom, by Richard H. Chance, President of Chance Rides in Wichita, Kansas. The first engineer hired by Folsom in 1963 was a local high school student, J. D. Ayres, who worked as a seasonal employee building the railroad track prior to the Zoo's opening. In October 1963, the city of Lincoln staged a Golden Spike Ceremony attended by the Mayor, City Council, and other local dignitaries. The ceremonial Golden Spike was an actual track spike of a type used extensively in building the railroad, but which had been gold plated for the event. The Iron Horse Railroad operated successfully as the primary revenue generator for the Lincoln Children's Zoo prior to the grand opening in 1965. In 2020, the zoo's original locomotive was replaced with a new electric locomotive. There are three C.P. Huntington replicas operating the perimeter track at the Santa Barbara Zoo. Story Land in Glen, NH operates four C.P. Huntington locomotives. Pullen Park, a park run since 1887 in Raleigh, NC, has a CP Huntington train with millions of riders to ride on it since 1950. The Baton Rouge Zoo also runs a C.P. Huntington locomotive around the perimeter of its zoo. It was donated by the local Coca-Cola plant. Landa Park in New Braunfels, TX operates a gas powered version through the park surrounding the springs and headwaters of the Comal River. The Downtown Aquarium in Houston became the first operator of an electric version of the locomotive. The defunct Ghost Town in the Sky in Maggie Valley, NC lists on the bill of sale a C.P. Huntington by Chance Rides, Inc. with a Teledyne Continental 4 cyl. 64hp engine, 24\\" gauge track encircling the town, and 5 cars. Storyland & Playland in Roeding Park located in Fresno, CA, runs a Chance Rides CP Huntington locomotive between the two themed parks pulling a total of 6 passenger cars. As of 2018, Chance Rides has built over 400 different C. P. Huntington locomotives and coaches for customers around the world - such as \\"Window on China\\" in Taiwan that run 2 of these locomotives. Prices for locomotives run just under $200,000 and coaches run about $60,000 each. Locomotives and coaches can be customized in a variety of ways. In popular culture The unique design of the C. P.

In July 2012, the magazine also launched its first reality television show, in conjunction with the Afrikaans television channel kykNET. The show, titled Saktyd (Deadline),KykNET's new reality show Saktyd, Maroela Media (accessed 2014/05/20) gave viewers insight into what it takes to produce South Africa's biggest magazine on a weekly basis, while challenging 13 new journalists to win the job of a lifetime at the magazine. The magazine is published by Media24, a subsidiary company of Naspers publishing group. Content includes a mix of real-life drama, glamour, fashion and consumer affairs articles as well as recipes, crossword puzzles, home projects and sport. It has a children's and a teen section and at least one short story a week or a serial. History Editor Henri√´tte Loubser addresses the crowd during Huisgenoots 100th birthday party, 20 May 2016. The magazine was founded as the monthly De Huisgenoot, written in Dutch, in 1916. The first magazine cost 6d (six pennies or five cents) and consisted of 26 pages. President Paul Kruger was on the cover and the main article was a life sketch on the president. The first advertisement for that issue was by Stuttafords. There were two reasons behind its founding: *to financially support the newspaper De Burger (The Citizen), which was the political mouthpiece of the Cape National Party; and *provide the Afrikaner population with inspiration, information and entertainment in Afrikaans (or, originally, Dutch). While the cause of Afrikaner nationalism dominated the content of the magazine for decades, the editors of the magazine gradually had to make concessions to popular taste. Covers featuring Afrikaner heroes and politicians were replaced by ones featuring female film stars in the 1950s and 1960s. The Dutch-sounding title De Huisgenoot was changed to the more Afrikaans-sounding Die Huisgenoot and in 1977 the name was further simplified to simply Huisgenoot. By the late 1970s the culture and mores of the Afrikaner population had begun to diverge from earlier generations, leading to a drastic decline in the magazine's readership and finances. By 1978 the magazine was in serious trouble and a new editor, Niel Hammann, was appointed. He took Huisgenoot in a more populist and profit-driven direction and the popularity and sales of the magazine subsequently surged ‚Äì from 140,000 to 500,000 magazines per week. The popularity of Huisgenoot has continued almost unabated since then, making the magazine and its English sister publication YOU the two most successful magazines in South Africa. =Milestones= This entire section sourced fromWeideman, E.

It is a derivative of the early insecticide DDT and an isomer of (4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) and is also known as 2,4'-(dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane (o,p'-DDD).Information from PubChem Medical uses Mitotane has been produced by Bristol Myers Squibb SpA but it is marketed as an orphan drug for adrenocortical carcinoma due to the small number of patients in need of it. Its main use is in those patients who have persistent disease despite surgical resection, those who are not surgical candidates, or those who have metastatic disease. A 2007 study of 177 patients shows a significant increase in the recurrence-free interval after radical surgery followed by mitotane when compared to surgery alone [edit: this sentence is misleading in that it does not indicate that the study cited was derived from retrospective data (1985-2005) across different health systems with varying standards of care. The drug is also sometimes used in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. Side effects The use of mitotane is unfortunately limited by side effects, which, as reported by Schteinberg et al., include anorexia and nausea (88%), diarrhea (38%), vomiting (23%), decreased memory and ability to concentrate (50%), rash (23%), gynecomastia (50%), arthralgia (19%), and leukopenia (7%). Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Mitotane is an inhibitor of the adrenal cortex. It acts as an inhibitor of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1), and also of 11Œ≤-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), 18-hydroxylase (aldosterone synthase, CYP11B2), and 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3Œ≤-HSD) to a lesser extent. In addition, mitotane has direct and selective cytotoxic effects on the adrenal cortex, via an unknown mechanism, and thereby induces permanent adrenal atrophy similarly to DDD. Chemistry Analogues of mitotane include aminoglutethimide, amphenone B, and metyrapone. History Mitotane was introduced in 1960 for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma. Society and culture =Generic names= Mitotane is the generic name of the drug and its , , , and . =Brand names= Mitotane has been sold under the brand name Lysodren. Veterinary use Mitotane is also used to treat Cushing's disease (pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome) in dogs. The medication is used in the controlled destruction of adrenal tissue, leading to a decrease in cortisol production.Canine Cushing‚Äôs Syndrome: Diagnosis and Treatment References External links  Government of Canada: Benzene, 1-chloro-2-[2,2-dichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]\\\\- (Mitotane) * Environment Canada & Health Canada: RISK MANAGEMENT SCOPE for Benzene, 1-chloro-2-[2,2-dichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]\\\\- (Mitotane), 2013 3Œ≤-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitors 11Œ≤-Hydroxylase inhibitors Aldosterone synthase inhibitors Antiglucocorticoids Antineoplastic drugs Chloroarenes Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme inhibitors Organochlorides Orphan drugs ","title":"Mitotane"},{"id":"3818794","text":"Crank It Up may refer to: * \\"Crank It Up\\" (David Guetta song) * \\"Crank It Up\\" (Hadouken! song) * \\"Crank It Up\\" (Ashley Tisdale song) * \\"Crank It Up\\", a song by David Banner * \\"Crank It Up\\", a song by Peter Brown * \\"Crank It Up\\", a song on Scooter's album Our Happy Hardcore ","title":"Crank It Up"},{"id":"3818799","text":"SheepShaver is an open-source PowerPC Apple Macintosh emulator originally designed for BeOS and Linux. The name is a play on ShapeShifter, a Macintosh II emulator for AmigaOS (made obsolete by Basilisk II), which is in turn not to be confused with a third-party preference pane for Mac OS X with the same name. The ShapeShifter and SheepShaver projects were originally conceived and programmed by Christian Bauer. However, currently, the main developer behind SheepShaver is Gwenol√© Beauchesne. History SheepShaver was originally commercial software when first released in 1998, but after the demise of Be Inc., the maker of BeOS, it became open source in 2002. It can be run on both PowerPC and x86 systems; however, it runs more slowly on an x86 system than on a PowerPC system, because of the translation between the PowerPC and Intel x86 instruction sets. SheepShaver has also been ported to Microsoft Windows. As a free software, a few variants exist to simplify the installation process on Intel-based Macs: * ‚ÄòSheep Shaver Wrapper‚Äô is built off of Sheep Shaver but it does some of the bundling work for the user. * 'Chubby Bunny' also simplifies the set up process of OS 9 visualization on Intel Macs running OS X. Features SheepShaver is capable of running Mac OS 7.5.2 through 9.0.4 (though it needs the image of an Old World ROM to run Mac OS 8.1 or below), and can be run inside a window so that the user can run classic Mac OS and either BeOS, Intel-based Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows applications at the same time. Although SheepShaver does have Ethernet support and CD-quality sound output, it does not emulate the memory management unit. While adding MMU emulation has been discussed, the feature has not been added because of the effort required in implementing it, the impact on performance it will have and the lack of time on the part of the developers.

He advised the inhabitants of Weidenbach/Ghimbav to join their forces together with the people living in three other neighboring Saxon villages (Petersberg/S√¢npetru, Honigberg/HƒÉrman and Brenndorf/Bod) and contribute to the construction of the stone fortress of Bra»ôov. The Ottomans invaded Ghimbav in 1422. In 1469 a major fire damaged the town. In 1611 the Hungarian prince Gabriel B√°thory set fire to several villages in Burzenland (»öara B√¢rsei); Ghimbav was one of them. The local church and the bell tower were built around 1300. In the 15th century a fortress was built around the church. It was hit by lightning in 1642 and suffered major damages. In 1666 the city hall was moved inside the fortress as well as several other houses. These houses were demolished in 1940. The defensive walls were partially ruined in the 20th century.

In 1951, Carta did a vestibular exam and was admitted at the University of S√£o Paulo's traditional Law School of Largo S√£o Francisco. His enrollment records state that he was born on September 6, 1933. He attended the classes of the first years, but quit and ended up never graduating from higher education. In 1960 he started his career in journalism by helping to found Editora Abril automobile magazine Quatro Rodas. In 1966, he introduced new journalism in Brazil by founding S√£o Paulo-based newspaper Jornal da Tarde. Two years later, he helped Victor Civita of Abril to found Veja, which currently is the leading newsmagazine in the country, with a circulation of over a million copies per edition. Unsatisfied with the result, he helped in the foundation of Isto√© in 1976. Yet not completely satisfied with the result, he founded CartaCapital in 1994. On the new magazine, he and other columnists emphatically criticize neoliberal and neocon politics that are recently defended by Veja. Of all the publications Carta helped create during his life, only one, the defunct Jornal da Rep√∫blica, failed to succeed. The 1970s newspaper had a large d√©ficit on its budget. Disappointed with the position of Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva in the Cesare Battisti case, Carta decided to retire from his blog and his column on CartaCapital. Published books In 2000, Carta released his first novel, titled O Castelo de √Çmbar (The Castle of Amber), in which he narrates a semi- biographical story.

Written as a fictional story, some connections may be done with the reality, such as the character's home land \\"Aus√¥nia\\" being Italy and his house on \\"Rua √Åurea\\" being Rua Augusta. In 2003, Carta published his second novel A Sombra do Sil√™ncio (The Shadow of Silence), a follow-up to O Castelo de √Çmbar. In this book, the main character finds himself on the Rua √Åurea with Cuore Mio, \\"the most laughing girl in the neighbourhood\\", starting what is described by the author as the \\"only and authentic love of their lives\\".

He is known in Italy as the \\"Iron Prefect\\" (Prefetto di Ferro) because of his iron-fisted campaigns against the Mafia in Sicily in the second half of the 1920s. Mori was regarded as a Fascist, and wrote strongly of his admiration of the effectiveness of both the Fascist Party and Mussolini several times in his self authored accounts in Sicily, although his works were clearly influenced by the propaganda of the regime: \\"What caused the undoubted efforts made in the past to peter out was a feeling of listlessness, in the minds of the people which seemed refractory even to unusual stimulants. It was not a reality, it was not a fact, but a feeling; yet the past was infected and dominated by it until the day when, on the coming of Fascism, the Duce in person broke the evil spell.\\" Likewise, Cesare Mori is known for being the first to ever destroy the influence of the Mafia within Italy. The 1977 film Il prefetto di ferro, directed by Pasquale Squitieri, is about his fight against the Mafia when he was prefect in Sicily.  Early years  Mori was born in Pavia and grew up in an orphanage and was only recognised by his natural parents in October 1879 at the age of seven. He studied at the Turin Military Academy. However, he married a girl, Angelina Salvi, who did not have the dowry stipulated by military regulations of the time, and had to resign.Newark, Mafia Allies, p. 28 He joined the police, serving first in Ravenna, then Castelvetrano in the province of Trapani (Sicily) ‚Äì where he made his name capturing the bandit Paolo Grisalfi ‚Äì before moving to Florence in 1915 as vice-quaestor.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, pp. 176-78 At the end of the First World War, the situation of Sicilian criminality got worse when war veterans joined gangs of bandits. In 1919 Mori was sent back to Sicily as the head of special forces against brigandage.Newark, Mafia Allies, p. 17 In his roundups, Mori distinguished himself for his energetic and radical methods. At Caltabellotta he arrested more than 300 people in one night.Petacco, Il prefetto di ferro, p. ? The press wrote of a \\"lethal blow to the Mafia\\", but Mori said to a member of his staff : > These people haven't understood yet that brigands and the Mafia are two > different things. We have hit the first, who are undoubtedly the most > visible aspect of Sicilian criminality, but not the most dangerous one. The > true lethal blow to the Mafia will be delivered when we are able to make > roundups not only among Prickly Pears, but in prefectures, police > headquarters, employers' mansions, and why not, some ministries. In 1920, he returned to the mainland and served in Turin as quaestor, followed by Rome and Bologna. In 1921 he was prefect of Bologna, and was one of the few members of the forces of law and order to oppose the organised thuggery (squadrismo) of the Fascist movement. Mori was removed and sent to Bari. He retired with his wife to Florence in 1922, when the Fascist leader Benito Mussolini took over the government after the March on Rome.Newark, Mafia Allies, pp. 20-21  Appointed in Sicily  His reputation as a man of action caused his recall to active service in 1924 by the Minister of the Interior, Luigi Federzoni. In the same year, Mori joined the Fascist Party. He was next appointed prefect of Trapani. Arriving in June 1924, he stayed there until 20 October 1925, when Mussolini appointed him prefect of Palermo, with special powers over the entire island of Sicily and the mission of eradicating the Mafia by any means possible. In a telegram Mussolini wrote to Mori: > Your Excellency has carte blanche, the authority of the State must > absolutely, I repeat absolutely, be re-established in Sicily. Should the > laws currently in effect hinder you, that will be no problem, we shall make > new laws.Petacco, L'uomo della provvidenza, p. 190. Mussolini's drive against the Mafia, the story goes, followed an official visit to Sicily in May 1924 during which he felt insulted by the Mafioso Francesco Cuccia, who publicly proclaimed that Mussolini did not need a police escort because the mere presence of Cuccia would protect him. Mussolini felt humiliated and outraged.Newark, Mafia Allies, p. 23Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 182 However, according to scholar Christopher Duggan, the reason was more political rather than personal. The Mafia threatened and undermined his power in Sicily, and a successful campaign would strengthen him as the new leader, thus legitimising and strengthening his rule.Duggan, Fascism and the Mafia, p. 119  Fight against the Mafia  Mori in black shirt Mori took up his post in Palermo in November 1925 and remained in office until 1929. Within the first two months he arrested over five hundred men, a number that would only grow in the following years.Governmental Floundering and the Survival of the Mafia, by Dominica Tarica, The Florence Newspaper In January 1926, he undertook what was probably his most famous action, the occupation of the village of Gangi, a stronghold of various criminal gangs. Using carabinieri and police forces he ordered house-to-house searches, picking up bandits, small-time Mafia members and various suspects who were on the run. Due to the necessity of the nature of the mafia, he was forced to discreetly collect large amounts of evidence and subsequently make arrests en masse to avoid large numbers of mafiosi going into hiding. As he poetically states, \\"These operations were carried out in considerable numbers and on a large scale: and the rapidity with which they succeeded one another and the exactness of evidence on which they were based completely strangled the criminal associations which for so many years had flourished with impunity. And the whole island chanted a hymn of liberation.\\" These sweeping mass arrests, earned him the nickname of \\"Iron Prefect\\". Mori understood the basis of Mafia power. In order to defeat the phenomenon, he felt it necessary to \\"forge a direct bond between the population and the state, to annul the system of mediation under which citizens could not approach the authorities except through middlemen..., receiving as a favour that which is due them as their right.\\"The Mafia and Politics , by Judith Chubb, Cornell Studies in International Affairs, Occasional Papers No. 23, 1989 Mori's methods were sometimes similar to those of the Mafia. He did not just arrest the bandits, but sought to humiliate them as well. If he could display a strong central authority to rival the Mafia, people would see that the Mafia was not their only option for protection. He often found evidence of how the Mafia operated, and seized their property and cattle. Mori's inquiries brought evidence of collusion between the Mafia and influential members of the State apparatus and the Fascist party. His position, however, became more precarious. Some 11,000 arrests are attributed to Mori's rule in Palermo.Duggan, Fascism and the Mafia, p. 245 That led to massive amounts of paperwork in order to prepare for the trials, which may have been partially responsible for his dismissal.Duggan, Fascism and the Mafia, p. 225Newark, Mafia Allies, pp. 45-46 Mussolini had already nominated Mori as a senator in 1928, and in June 1929 he was relieved of his duties. The Fascist propaganda proudly announced that the Mafia had been defeated.Newark, Mafia Allies, pp. 47-48  Final years  As a senator, Mori continued to follow Sicilian affairs closely, and made sure he was always well informed. However, he no longer had any influence and was essentially a marginal figure. He wrote his memoirs in 1932. In 1937 Mori expressed concerns about Mussolini's new alliance with Adolf Hitler and was isolated inside the fascist party since then. He retired to Udine in 1941 and died there one year later, a forgotten figure in a country by then in the throes of the Second World War.  Impact  At the time and since, the general perception was that Mori had smashed the Mafia. Sicily's murder rate sharply declined in the early 1930s.Lupo, History of the Mafia, p. 186 The Mafia pentito Antonio Calderone said the Mori's crackdown had hit the Mafia hard.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, pp. 175-76 Some Mafiosi escaped and moved abroad (especially to the United States), such as Joseph Bonanno. Other Mafiosi remained in Sicily and either turned over their fellow Mafiosi (or low-level bandits) to the police or simply went quiet and sought accommodation with the fascist authorities until the end of the regime in Italy.Duggan, Fascism and the Mafia, p. 189 With the invasion of Sicily in 1943 and the collapse of the fascist regime, the Mafia re-established itself, sometimes with the help or ignorance of the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT). AMGOT needed the support of local elites in order to govern. Because of their local authority, their record of persecution under the Fascist regime, and their willingness to cooperate with the Allies, noted Mafiosi, such as Calogero Vizzini and Giuseppe Genco Russo, were appointed to head local administrations in many of the towns in western Sicily. According to the post-war journalist Michele Pantaleone: > By the beginning of the Second World War, the Mafia had dwindled to a few > isolated and scattered groups and could have been completely wiped out if > the social problems of the island had been dealt with... the Allied > occupation and the subsequent slow restoration of democracy reinstated the > Mafia with its full powers, put it once more on the way to becoming a > political force, and returned to the Onorata Societa the weapons which > Fascism had snatched from it.Pantaleone, The Mafia and Politics, p. 52, > quoted in The Mafia Restored: Fighters for Democracy in World War II , The > Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia, Alfred W. McCoy. In Leonardo Sciascia's 1961 novel The Day of the Owl (Il giorno della civetta), the main character, a captain of the Carabinieri, recalls the great popularity of Mori's results among the Sicilian common people, and the widespread nostalgia for fascism among them at the time.Sciascia,The Day of the Owl, p. ? However some writers today have questioned the effectiveness and value of the methods used by Mori against the Mafia. While his methods were certainly effective, at least in the short term, Timothy Newark has written that they mainly targeted the small-time criminals of Sicily and left the big- timers, the real Mafia bosses, relatively unscathed, which drove the Mafia underground but failed to not stamp it out.Newark, Mafia Allies, p. 203 Judith Chubb says, \\"Fascism succeeded in stamping out the Mafia as a criminal organization by providing a more efficient substitute. It succeeded in monopolizing political power and the use of violence without, however, transforming the social and economic conditions in which the Mafia had flourished. It was thus no surprise that the Mafia re-emerged as soon as Fascism fell.\\" However, politicians like Giorgio Almirante wrote on Il Borghese in the 1970s that Sicilian society was really transformed by the full destruction of the Mafia in the 1930s, but the destruction of World War II and the imposition of \\"antifascism\\", which criticised everything achieved by fascism, even against mafiosi, together with the return of the (Allies- sponsored) Mafia bosses, who had taken refuge in the United States, was responsible for the Mafia's resurgence in postwar Sicily.  In popular culture  Mori's campaign against the Mafia was the subject of a 1977 film, Il prefetto di ferro, directed by Pasquale Squitieri, starring Giuliano Gemma and Claudia Cardinale, with music by Ennio Morricone.Il Prefetto di Ferro (1977), New York Times Movies In 2012 the Italian RAI has made the fiction \\"Cesare Mori - Il prefetto di ferro\\".

The mall, 1.25 miles (2 kilometers) long, runs along 16th Street in downtown Denver, from Wewatta Street (at Union Station) to the intersection of 16th Avenue and Broadway (at Civic Center Station). The intricate granite stone sidewalks and streets were designed by architect I.M Pei to resemble the scale pattern of the Western Diamondback Rattlesnake. It is home to over 300 locally owned/chain stores, over 50 restaurants, and the Denver Pavilions. History The 16th Street Mall opened in 1982, originally from Market Street to Broadway, and was designed by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, with Henry N. Cobb as design partner, in collaboration with the urban design and landscape architecture firm, OLIN. The mall was extended from Market Street to Wynkoop Street in 2001 and to Union Station in 2002 to coincide with the completion of the Central Platte Valley (CPV) light rail spur. Before 1982, 16th Street was still a shopping and business destination that was home to four major department stores and many office buildings. Currently, the 16th Street Mall serves as a nexus for the major businesses downtown as well as the various tourist attractions that are nearby. =Street performing= Traditionally, street performing has been very popular on the mall, with many local folk, country, and vocal musicians gaining recognition in pop culture. Other types of performers, such as dancers, actors, impressionists, and comedians have also used the popular location as a prime venue for discovery. FreeMallRide Third Generation MallRide bus A free shuttle bus service, operated by the Regional Transportation District (RTD), is known as the Free MallRide. From 1982 to 1999, the MallRide fleet used front-wheel-drive and right-hand-drive buses that were custom-designed and purpose-built. The right-hand-drive gives the operators better view of passengers entering and exiting the buses from the right-hand side and to watch out for the pedestrians. These buses can travel up to on the street and must deal with the 'wandering' pedestrians on the sidewalks who get too close to the buses. When the original fleet was beginning to age, Neoplan constructed a single left-hand-drive prototype bus with video cameras as a potential replacement. All of the MallRide operators refused to accept the left-hand-drive bus, citing more convenience and safety with right-hand-drive configuration. RTD went back to the drawing board and started the bid process anew. Many bus or heavy vehicle manufacturers rejected the RTD's exact specification due to the low number of buses to be manufactured and \\"unproven\\" hybrid technology (especially in the late 1990s and early 2000s). Only Neoplan and a startup company, Columbine Bus, submitted proposals. Columbine Bus was formed by two engineers with electric vehicle backgrounds. Although Columbine Bus won the $11.7 million contract, they were not able to secure the needed funds to go into production. In those years, the investment community did not see any future in electric or hybrid-electric vehicle technologies. Columbine Bus was soon acquired by TransTeq, to build the hybrid-electric MallRide buses. RTD worked very closely with TransTeq with almost daily visits to the nearby manufacturing facility. The second- generation MallRide buses were called EcoMark and used a 1.6-litre compressed natural gas Ford engine that drove an electric generator on demand. The generator in turn provided electrical power to the two electric motors. The batteries were recharged by both regenerative brake power and generator on demand. EcoMark MallRide buses had extra doors and more standing room than the first-generation MallRide buses. The operators continued to drive on the right-hand side as they did in the first-generation. In August 2015, RTD approved a contract for up to $27.1 million to purchase a fleet of 36 all- electric buses from BYD Auto. At the end of August 2016, the first new bus, the BYD K10MR, was introduced at an early-morning media event, and to the public later in the day, with the transition to the new electric bus fleet happening in the following weeks. MallRide stops at every intersection between Union Station and the 16th Avenue/Broadway intersection, with two stations Union Station (at 17th Street and Wynkoop Street) and Civic Center (at 16th Street and Broadway)providing key connections to other RTD buses. In addition, MallRide provides connections to the RTD rail network. Connections to the A Line, B Line, C Line, E Line, and W Line are at Union Station. Connections to the D Line, F Line, H Line, and L Line are at 16th/California & 16th/Stout stations. In May 2014 the previous bus terminal, Market Street Station, was closed to coincide with the opening of the Union Station Transit Center. As part of the Union Station Transit Center opening, RTD introduced the rush hour Metro Ride service with limited stops between Union Station and Civic Center Station. Other transportation alternatives to the MallRide on the 16th Street Mall include Pedicab Services and horse-drawn carriage, B-Cycle bike-sharing, and various car-sharing operations. Bikes and scooters are not allowed on the 16th Street Mall on weekdays. Impact as an urban space 16th Street Mall with Colorado State Capitol in background The Project for Public Spaces says of the Mall that it \\"provides the entire downtown with shuttle bus circulation and high quality pedestrian access to Union Station. However, its success as a place has to do with its edge uses, over 300 shops and 50 restaurants that line the Mall with caf√©s, window displays, and buskers.\\" In summer 2014, and again in 2015, the Downtown Denver Partnership and Downtown Denver Business Improvement collaborated on several Meet in the Street Sunday events, rerouting the Mall Shuttle to adjacent streets and opening much of the mall to pedestrians and cyclists, and featuring various fun activities to bring people together.

They were first known as The Great Wallendas, but the current name was coined by the press in the 1940s and has stayed since. History Carla Wallenda, Karl Wallenda, Raymond Chitty, and Richard Guzman (Carla's husband), Karl Wallenda was born in Magdeburg, Germany, in 1905 to an old circus family, and began performing at the age of six. While still in his teens he answered an ad for a \\"hand balancer with courage.\\" His employer, Louis Weitzman, taught him the trade. In 1922, Karl put together his own act with his brother Herman, Joseph Geiger, and a teenage girl, Helen Kreis, who eventually became his wife. The act toured Europe for several years, and when John Ringling saw them perform in Cuba, he quickly hired them to perform at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. In 1928, they debuted at the Madison Square Garden. The act performed without a net (it had been lost in transit) and the crowd gave them a standing ovation. In 1944, while the Wallendas were performing in Hartford, Connecticut, a circus fire broke out, killing over 168 people. None of the Wallendas were hurt. In the following years, Karl developed some of their most impressive acts, such as the seven-person chair pyramid. They continued performing those acts until January 30, 1962 when, while performing at the Shrine Circus at Detroit's State Fair Coliseum, the front man on the wire (Dieter Schepp) faltered and the pyramid collapsed. Three men fell to the ground, killing Richard Faughnan, Wallenda's son-in-law; and nephew Dieter Schepp. Karl injured his pelvis, and his adopted son, Mario, was paralyzed from the waist down. Dieter's sister Jana Schepp let go of the wire to fall into the quickly-raised safety net, but bounced off and suffered a head injury. Other tragedies include when Wallenda's sister-in-law, Rietta, fell to her death in 1963, and his son-in-law Richard (\\"Chico\\") Guzman was killed in 1972 after touching a live electric wire while holding part of the metal rigging. Nonetheless, Karl decided to go on. He repeated the pyramid act in 1963 and 1977. Karl continued performing with a smaller group, and doing solo acts. Karl Wallenda crossed the Tallulah Gorge in Georgia on a high wire on July 18, 1970. On March 22, 1978, during a promotional walk in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Karl Wallenda fell from the wire and died. It was between the towers of Condado Plaza Hotel, one hundred feet high. He was 73. Nik Wallenda completed the walk on June 4, 2011, with his mother, Delilah.Daniel, K. Nik Wallenda finishes high-wire act that killed great-grandfather. cnn.com. June 4, 2011. On March 5, 1993, Karl's grandson Mario B. Wallenda (not to be confused with Karl's adopted son) died from AIDS complications at the age of 36. He had tested positive for HIV in July 1990. On October 15, 2008, Nik broke the world record for the highest and longest bike ride on a high wire live on NBC's Today. Nik Wallenda became the first aerialist to walk directly over Niagara Falls on June 15, 2012, from the United States into Canada. Wearing a safety harness as required by ABC television, he crossed at the river's widest point. Nik Wallenda is the first aerialist to walk over the Little Colorado River Gorge at the Grand Canyon. The event was broadcast live on the Discovery Channel. He used a 2-inch wire and made the journey without a harness or safety net. The canyon is wide and deep.http://skywire.discovery.com/#the-walk Nik Wallenda walks across the Grand Canyon There are several branches of the Wallendas performing today, comprising mostly grandchildren of Karl Wallenda. They still perform regularly and have achieved recognition in the Guinness Book of Records. On November 2, 2014, Nik successfully crossed between two Chicago skyscrapers, the west tower of Marina City and the Leo Burnett Building. After accomplishing this feat, he successfully crossed the two towers of Marina City while wearing a blindfold in cold conditions with strong winds. He set two world records, one for the highest incline, 19 degrees, between the west tower and the Leo Burnett building and one for the highest blindfolded wire walk between the two towers of Marina City. Both crossings were broadcast live on Discovery Channel. In February 2017, a rehearsal of the troupe's eight-person pyramid highwire act for Circus Sarasota (an attempt at a new Guinness World Record for height) turned awry when the pyramid collapsed, plummeting five of the performers to the ground while three others, including Nik Wallenda, managed to cling to the wire. Miraculously no one was killed, but all five performers were severely injured: Nik's sister Lijana Wallenda suffered the worst injuries, breaking nearly every bone in her face. Nik and Lijana became the first individuals to successfully cross New York's Times Square on a tightrope 25 stories above street level on June 23, 2019. The duo crossed from opposite ends of the wire, which measured 1300 feet (396 meters) long and was suspended between 1 Times Square and 2 Times Square. The stunt was broadcast live on ABC and marked Lijana's return to live performance since her accident. For the stunt, both Wallendas used safety harnesses, despite the family's long-standing objection to the use of safety devices. In contrast to his statements during his Niagara Falls walk, Nik Wallenda admitted he felt the use of a harness was important for Lijana's first highwire walk since her fall.

Biography Nicolson was the second son of writers Sir Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West; he had an elder brother Ben, an art historian. The boys grew up in Kent, first at Long Barn, near their mother's ancestral home at Knole, and then at Sissinghurst Castle, where their parents created a famous garden. Nicolson was sent to board at Summer Fields, a prep school in Oxford; he then attended Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford. During World War II he served with the Grenadier Guards, later writing their official history. Nicolson wrote many books. He and George Weidenfeld co-founded the publishing house Weidenfeld & Nicolson, of which he was a director from 1948 to 1992. He also worked as a broadcaster and was a member of the Ancient Monuments Board. Although his father had been first a National Labour and then a Labour politician, Nigel Nicolson became active in the Conservative Party and contested Leicester North West in 1950 and Falmouth and Camborne in 1951, without success. He was elected Member of Parliament for Bournemouth East and Christchurch at a by-election in February 1952, when the previous MP, Brendan Bracken, was elevated to the House of Lords. Nicolson was re-elected in the seat in the general election of May 1955. However, he was uncomfortable within the Tory party and voted with Labour to abolish hanging and abstained in a vote of confidence in the government over the Suez Crisis. His constituency association called for him to resign and wrote to the Prime Minister briefing against their MP. A ballot of members was called. Unfortunately for Nicolson, a controversy relating to his publishing interests broke a few years later ‚Äì the company's decision to publish the British edition of Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita in 1959. Nicolson lost the members' vote and was forced to step down at the general election of October 1959.Laurence W. Martin. \\"The Bournemouth Affair: Britain's First Primary Election\\", The Journal of Politics, Vol. 22, No. 4. (Nov. 1960), pp. 654‚Äì81. Nicolson returned to writing, particularly on heritage and biography. He co- wrote a celebrated 1973 book on his parents, Portrait of a Marriage. It balanced a frank account of his bisexual parents' extramarital affairs (especially Vita Sackville-West's 'elopement' with Violet Trefusis) with their enduring love for each other; it caused an uproar when it was published. He edited his father's diaries and, with Joanne Trautmann, the letters of Virginia Woolf. Later he wrote the \\"Long Life\\" column for The Spectator, and a Time of My Life column for The Sunday Telegraph. His autobiography, Long Life, was published in 1997. Marriage and death In 1953 Nicolson married Philippa, the daughter of Sir Gervais Tennyson d'Eyncourt, and they had two daughters, Rebecca, a publisher, Juliet, a historian, and a son, Adam, a writer. Juliet has written about her father and his ancestors in A House Full of Daughters (2016). Adam has revived the home farm at Sissinghurst. Nigel and Philippa divorced in 1970. Nicolson died on 23 September 2004, at Sissinghurst Castle, in Kent.

It is named after Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri, who used it extensively in his book Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus (literally Euclid Freed of Every Flaw) first published in 1733, an attempt to prove the parallel postulate using the method Reductio ad absurdum. The first known consideration of the Saccheri quadrilateral was by Omar Khayyam in the late 11th century, and it may occasionally be referred to as the Khayyam‚ÄìSaccheri quadrilateral. For a Saccheri quadrilateral ABCD, the sides AD and BC (also called the legs) are equal in length, and also perpendicular to the base AB. The top CD is the summit or upper base and the angles at C and D are called the summit angles. The advantage of using Saccheri quadrilaterals when considering the parallel postulate is that they place the mutually exclusive options in very clear terms: :Are the summit angles right angles, obtuse angles, or acute angles? As it turns out: * when the summit angles are right angles, the existence of this quadrilateral is equivalent to the statement expounded by Euclid's fifth postulate. *When the summit angles are acute, this quadrilateral leads to hyperbolic geometry, and *when the summit angles are obtuse, the quadrilateral leads to elliptical or spherical geometry (provided that also some other modifications are made to the postulates). Saccheri himself, however, thought that both the obtuse and acute cases could be shown to be contradictory. He did show that the obtuse case was contradictory, but failed to properly handle the acute case. History Saccheri quadrilaterals were first considered by Omar Khayyam (1048-1131) in the late 11th century in Book I of Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid. Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including of course Saccheri), Khayyam was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from an equivalent postulate he formulated from \\"the principles of the Philosopher\\" (Aristotle): :Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge.Boris A Rosenfeld and Adolf P Youschkevitch (1996), Geometry, p.467 in Roshdi Rashed, R√©gis Morelon (1996), Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science, Routledge, . Khayyam then considered the three cases right, obtuse, and acute that the summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral can take and after proving a number of theorems about them, he (correctly) refuted the obtuse and acute cases based on his postulate and hence derived the classic postulate of Euclid. It was not until 600 years later that Giordano Vitale made an advance on Khayyam in his book Euclide restituo (1680, 1686), when he used the quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant. Saccheri himself based the whole of his long and ultimately flawed proof of the parallel postulate around the quadrilateral and its three cases, proving many theorems about its properties along the way. Saccheri quadrilaterals in hyperbolic geometry Let ABCD be a Saccheri quadrilateral having AB as base, CD as summit and CA and DB as the equal sides that are perpendicular to the base. The following properties are valid in any Saccheri quadrilateral in hyperbolic geometry: * The summit angles (the angles at C and D) are equal and acute. * The summit is longer than the base. * Two Saccheri quadrilaterals are congruent if:  the base segments and summit angles are congruent  the summit segments and summit angles are congruent. * The line segment joining the midpoint of the base and the midpoint of the summit:  Is perpendicular to the base and the summit,  is the only line of symmetry of the quadrilateral,  is the shortest segment connecting base and summit,  is perpendicular to the line joining the midpoints of the sides,  divides the Saccheri quadrilateral into two Lambert quadrilaterals. * The line segment joining the midpoints of the sides is not perpendicular to either side. =Equations = In the hyperbolic plane of constant curvature -1, the summit s of a Saccheri quadrilateral can be calculated from the leg l and the base b using the formula :\\\\cosh s = (\\\\cosh b -1) \\\\cosh^2 l + 1 = \\\\cosh b \\\\cdot \\\\cosh^2 l - \\\\sinh^2 lP.

Name It is not clear if Pindjarup is the historically correct ethnonym for the tribe. After their disappearance, the only sources for them came from Kaneang informants. The word itself may reflect a lexeme pinjar/benjar meaning wetlands or swamps, which would yield the idea that the Pindjarup were \\"people of the wetlands\\". Country Pindjarup tribal estates extended over an estimated , taking in Pinjarra, Harvey and the Leschenault Estuary. They were also present on Murray River's lower reaches. Social organization and lifestyle As a people of the wetlands, the Pindjarup were famed for their fish-traps, and a seasonal cycle of six seasons, making full use of the environmental resources from the coastal estuaries and sand-dunes, through the interior lakes and wetlands to the more fertile soils of the Darling Scarp foothills and ridgelines. Western long-necked tortoises, black swans, ducks, and migratory birds formed an important part of their diet. History of European settlement The lands of the Pindjarup were first explored by Europeans in 1829, when Lieutenant P. N. Preston and Dr Alexander Collie took the British naval vessel HMS Sulphur to explore the mouths of the Peel Inlet, the Serpentine and Murray Rivers, and the Leschenault Inlet. The Pindjarup killed one of the exploring party, George MacKenzie, a 19-year-old, in 1830. Two years later, after a soldier was wounded on the Murray, the British sent a punitive expedition which shot five Pindjarup dead, and left many others wounded. Thomas Peel, a second cousin of the future British Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, had been given some of land, part of it covering Pindjarup territory, as his personal domain. The Pindjarup were in dispute also with the Whadjuk of the Swan River. In December 1833 the former's claim to have rights to perform their ceremonies and make kinship visits to the northern area were recognized at a corroboree and the Pindjarup resumed their visits to kin. The Whadjuk themselves had had numerous conflicts with the British settlers, who had occupied land on which one of their basic foods, yams, grew. The British authorities themselves were drawn into taking sides when intertribal conflicts arose. Around February of the following year clashes took place with settlers after their clan dingoes attacked livestock near Perth. In a standoff, the Pindjarup leader Calyute distinguished himself by keeping his spear pressed to a soldier who had, in turn, held his musket at Calyute's chest. The Whadjuk, who had come to some terms of agreement over co- existence with the intruders, and the Pindjarup fell out with regard to the way to handle the settlers, especially after a duel between Calyte and a Whadjuk man, Yaloo, in which both suffered wounds. In April 1834 Calyute raided George Shenton's windmill, pinned its owner down after luring him out with an offer of baked damper, and hauled off a substantial quantity, , of flour. His identity and that of many others in the raiding band, was passed on to the settler authorities by Whadjuk people. A detachment managed to capture Calyute, who was bayoneted, together with two other men, Yedong and Monang, some days later, and he was flogged with 60 lashes in Perth's main street, and then imprisoned for a year, being released on 10 June 1834. On Yedong's release he organized an ambush on the 24 July on what Peel regarded as his property, killing a private, Hugh Nesbit and wounding a former soldier, having lured them into a trap after promising them help in retrieving a lost horse. Nesbit's death was attributed to a man called Noonar. The wounded man managed, though speared three times, to make his way back to safety. The military unit at Governor Stirling's disposition had received reinforcements that doubled their numbers by September 1833 and he also created a Mounted Police unit, mainly from discharged soldiers. On 25 October, Stirling led troops, and accompanied by Peel, down into Pindjarup lands, not only to exact retribution for Nesbit's death, but also to enable Peel to resume, unthreatened, the Pindjarup lands the Crown had bestowed on him. =Massacre of Pinjarra= What ensued was almost immediately referred to as the \\"Battle of Pinjarra\\", a name retained by historical memory in West Australia until recently. Historians now consider it to have been a massacre of the indigenous people. Stirling's military contingent consisted of 25 men who came across a Pindjatup camp of from 70 to 80 people. Tactics had some positioned on either side of the river and others advancing on an front, with a forward party pressing on horseback into the camp. At least five Pindjarup were shot dead immediately, and the rest fled riverwards, where the men, women and children, came under fire. One British soldier was speared in the arm, and Ellis was mortally wounded. Stirling's official report stated that 14 Pindjarup had been killed, though modern estimates run as high as 50. Events after 1834 By 1836 a permanent military settlement was established in Pinjarra, and further land grants to settlers occurred with little overt resistance from Aboriginal people, who sought employment in the pastoral industry which was established in the area. By 1838 a road through Pindjarup lands connected Pinjarra to Bunbury. Pindjarup people survived the conflict, but their cultural identity was weakened through policies of successive Protectors of Aborigines in Western Australia, particularly Henry Prinsep and A. O. Neville, who sought to \\"breed out\\" the Aboriginal race through miscegenation with whites. Successive outbreaks of measles and other illnesses also took their toll on the successive demoralisation of these people. Nevertheless, since the 1930s the number of Aboriginal people in Pindjarup lands has increased, though most now identify themselves by the language group Noongar, rather than Pindjarup. From the 1940s to the 1970s up to 500 Aboriginal people, including many of Pindjarup heritage, were incarcerated at the Roelands Aboriginal Mission, most of whom were taken from their families as a part of the Stolen Generations policies of that era.

In Japan, the game was ported to the Family Computer, MSX and Sharp X68000; the latter version was later released for the Virtual Console in the same region on November 18, 2008. Dragon Buster has been ported for the PSP and is available as part of Namco Museum Battle Collection. It was followed by a Japan-only Famicom sequel, Dragon Buster II: Yami no F≈´in, and was later followed by the PlayStation game Dragon Valor, which was both a remake and sequel. The game featured side-scrolling platform gameplay and an overworld map similar to the later platform games for home consoles and personal computers. Dragon Buster was also the earliest game to feature a double jump mechanic, and one of the first to use a visual health meter. Gameplay Screenshot of Dragon Buster (arcade version) The player must guide the hero Clovis through each round on to the castle to rescue his beloved Princess Celia. There are multiple Princess Celias in the game, one in every few castles. The goal is to reach the true Celia at the end of the game in the final castle. Celia wears a different outfit each time she is rescued. As the player progresses through the round, he or she must choose various paths to take on to the castle. There are many paths to choose from and the number of these increases as the player gets to the higher rounds. The paths take the player to the individual levels of the round. There are multiple bosses on each level and many less powerful enemies scattered throughout each level. The player must find the boss that contains the exit on each level to proceed through the round and finally reach the castle. Clovis's vitality restores itself by 25% after each level is completed. The game ends when Clovis' vitality reaches zero. There are five different types of levels: The Cave, The Tower, The Boneyard, The Mountain and The Ruins. Each of these levels boasts more of a particular type of monster than the others, for example, The Boneyard boasts much of the boss Skeleton. The Cave is a mostly linear type of level, with mostly only descends and features horizontal movement. It boasts many bats and snakes. The Tower is notable for having many floors, and the player must do a lot of climbing in this type of level. The Boneyard is probably the most difficult type of level for having a lot of enemies and paths to choose, and the player will most likely end up defeating every boss in the level before he or she finds the boss that contains the exit. The Mountain has the player dropping down most of the time as he or she starts at the top of the mountain and must work his or her way down. The Ruins is a standard type of level with a bit of everything the other four types of levels contain. Finally, there is the Castle at the end of each round. Every Castle is the same, it starts with a very long drop that takes the player to the Dragon's room and from there he or she must fight the Dragon. Updates When the game was ported to the NEC PC-8801 computer by Enix, the port featured an introduction to the game and an entirely new ending, featuring cinema screens depicting a battle-torn Clovis and a teary-eyed Celia. Dragon Buster was also included as a hidden mini-game in Tales of the Abyss for PlayStation 2 and Nintendo 3DS. It was included in various Namco Museum compilations including Namco Museum Volume 2 for the original PlayStation, Namco Museum Battle Collection for PlayStation Portable, and Namco Museum Virtual Arcade for Xbox 360. Premise In the beginning, a prince named Clovis was born the son of the kingdom's chief bodyguard to the royal Lawrence family. As a young child, Clovis was very mischievous and undisciplined, so his father thought it might be best to place him under the care of a monk who lived in the woods far from the kingdom. Under the monk's care, Clovis began to learn various aspects of knowledge, including how to be a superior swordsman. When word reached the monk that King Lawrence's 16-year-old daughter Celia had been abducted and held by a fearsome dragon, who wished to break the kingdom's spirit and coerce the kingdom to do his bidding, Clovis felt a sense of duty to chase after the dragon and rescue Celia in the name of his father. In order to save the Princess, he trained daily with the monk and learned to withstand injury, whether cut by swords or burned by the flame and still be just as capable a fighter as ever. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Dragon Buster on their March 1, 1985 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Computer + Video Games liked the game's ease to newcomers and colorful graphics, saying it stood out from other arcade games at the time.

His novels are known for meticulous historical research. Background Though brought up in Britain, he was born Alfredo Le√≥n Duggan in Lomas de Zamora, Buenos Aires, Argentina, to a family of wealthy landowners of Irish descent. His family moved to Britain when he was two years old. His father Alfredo Huberto Duggan, a first generation Irish Argentinian, was appointed in 1905 to the Argentine Legation in London, and died in 1915. In 1917, his mother, the Alabama-born Grace Elvira Hinds, daughter of the U.S. Consul General in Rio de Janeiro, became the second wife of Lord Curzon, the former Viceroy of India. Duggan and his brother Hubert (1904‚Äì1943) were brought up in Britain at Curzon's seats, and were educated first at WixenfordGrace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston, Reminiscences (1955), p. 45. and Eton. Thereafter Alfred went to Balliol College at Oxford, where he became acquainted with Anthony Powell and Evelyn Waugh.John Derbyshire \\"Alfred Duggan's Past\\" New Criterion February 2005. He often features in Waugh's letters and diaries of the period, and his South American background may have influenced the character of Anthony Blanche in Brideshead Revisited, though Waugh described the character as \\"2/3 Brian [Howard] and 1/3 Harold Acton. People think it was all Harold, who is a much sweeter and saner man [than Howard].\\" Alfred Duggan kept a car while at Oxford, one of the few students with sufficient funding and influence to do so; the University Statutes prohibited undergraduate members of the University from keeping a car within a certain distance of the town centre at Carfax, and so Duggan kept his vehicle, an early Rolls-Royce, just outside the limit of the jurisdiction of the University Proctors, and would regularly drive himself and his friends to and from London during the social season. At Oxford he was part of the Hypocrites' Club. During 1938‚Äì1941, Duggan served with the London Irish Rifles, with active service in the Norwegian Campaign. For the rest of the Second World War he worked in an aeroplane factory. In 1953, Duggan married Laura Hill, and they went to live in Ross-on-Wye, where he died in April 1964.The Spectator (10 July 1964). According to a review by John Derbyshire, Duggan \\"in later years, his inheritance gone... adjusted philosophically to his changed circumstances, living a bookish and domestic life utterly at odds with the extravagant dissipation of his youth. He seems to have been a devoted husband and parent, and a loyal friend.\\"The New Criterion, February 2005 Retrieved 3 June 2019. Literature Duggan's novels are known for being based on meticulous historical research. He also wrote popular histories of Ancient Rome and the Middle Ages. Knight with Armour was his first novel, written in 1946. He visited practically every place and battlefield described in the book, because he was also an archaeologist, having worked on excavations in Istanbul during the 1930s. Unlike many historical novelists, he does not idealise his subjects. A few of the characters are noble, some rather nasty, many mixed in their motives. Some of the novels can be seen as funny, in a dry noir style. A recurring theme is the slow moral corruption of a character who begins with an exalted opinion of himself as noble, wise and brave but who gradually compromises himself morally. Most of the stories are told from the viewpoint of the ruling class, sometimes the ruler and sometimes a knight or noble. In English history, his novels show a general approval of the Norman conquest. Reception Duggan's novel Three's Company (1958) was praised by Rex Warner, who stated, \\"Mr. Duggan has succeeded in making him (Lepidus) a modern character, but he has also firmly placed him in his own age. Three's Company is a most competent piece of work, scholarly, alive, and suggestive.\\" Rex Warner, \\"Two Not So Noble Romans\\", The Saturday Review, 30 August 1958, p. 11. In an introduction to Duggan's novel Count Bohemond (1964), Evelyn Waugh said Duggan's \\"literary style remained constant. It is as crisp and clear in this posthumous novel as in his first.... There is no groping in Alfred's work. At the age of forty- seven he published his first book. It was lucid and masterly, absolutely free of affectation or ostentation.\\" Evelyn Waugh, \\"Preface\\", in Alfred Duggan, Count Bohemond (Reprint). London : Cassell Military, 2002, pp. 5‚Äì7.

His grandson Michael I (Tsar 1613-1645) founded the Romanov dynasty of Russian tsars. He was a son of the okolnichy Roman Yurievich Zakharyin (who died on 16 February 1543, and who gave his name to the Romanov dynasty of Russian monarchs), and of Roman Yurievich's wife Uliana Ivanovna, who died in 1579. Nikita Romanovich became the brother-in-law of Ivan IV of Russia, who married his sister Anastasia Romanovna in 1547. His great-grandfather was Zakhary Ivanovich Koshkin. Nikita Romanovich first appears in the historical record in 1547, when, on account of the Tsar's wedding with Anastasia Romanovna, he was promoted to spalnik and stolnik. He participated as a rynda (bodyguard) of the tsar in the unlucky campaigns against the Khanate of Kazan in 1547 and in 1548. Later he became the assistant to the Princes Vasily Serebryany and Andrey Nogtev-Suzdalsky with the rank of ololnichiy in the Livonian campaign of 1559. He was granted boyar status in 1562. Four years later, following the death of his brother Daniil Romanovich, he became the governor of Tver. He commanded detachments of the Russian army during the winter campaign of 1572 in Novgorod and against Sweden. He also took part in the Livonian campaigns of 1573 and 1577. Before his death (March 1584) Ivan the Terrible left his two sons, Feodor and Dmitry, to the care of trusted associates. Until illness incapacitated him in late 1584, Nikita Romanovich led the regency, as the only uncle of the Feodor I. He died on 23 April 1586 and was buried in the Novospassky Monastery. Marriages and issue Nikita Romanovich married twice. His first wife, Varvara Ivanovna Khovrina-Golovina (d. 18 June 1556), was the daughter of the hereditary treasurer of Tsardom of Russia and of a Rurikid princess.

Kozheozero Monastery, 23 March 1608) Nikita Romanovich second wife, Evdokiya Alexandrovna Gorbataya- Shuyskaya (d. 4 April 1581), another Rurikid princess from the Shuysky branch, was a sixth cousin of the future Vasili IV.

The ship served in the Mississippi River Squadron during the war, and participated in the Red River Campaign shortly after she was commissioned in early 1864. Ozark patrolled the Mississippi River and its tributaries after the end of the campaign for the rest of the war. She was decommissioned after the war and sold in late 1865. The ship's activities or owner are not known after her sale, but Ozark transported Federal troops and New Orleans police attempting to apprehend the white supremacists who killed numerous blacks during the Colfax Massacre in 1873. She ferried witnesses back and forth to their homes on the Red River during the subsequent trials in 1874. Her ultimate fate is unknown. Description The ship was long overall and had a beam of .Silverstone, p. 111 She had a depth of hold of Canney, p. 110 and a draft of six feet. Ozark had a tonnage of 578 tons burthen. She was powered by a pair of two-cylinder steam engines, each driving two four-bladed, propellers, using steam generated by four boilers. The engines were designed to reach a top speed of . They had a bore of and a stroke of . Ozark could carry about of coal. All of the machinery was built by the Franklin Foundry of St. Louis, Missouri. The ship was fitted with three rudders,Canney, pp. 110‚Äì11 and the armored pilothouse was mounted on top of the gun turret. The officers' staterooms were built on deck out of light pine, and a hurricane deck was positioned between the turret and the deckhouse, between the two funnels. The hull was subdivided by three transverse and three longitudinal watertight bulkheads. Ozarks main armament initially consisted of two smoothbore, muzzle-loading Dahlgren guns mounted in a twin-gun turret forward. The 11-inch gun weighed and could fire a shell up to a range of at +5¬∞ elevation.Olmstead, et al, pp. 90, 94 By July 1864, her armament had been reinforced by the addition of one Dahlgren gun and three Dahlgrens, all on pivot mounts. One of these guns was mounted at the bow, another at the stern and the two others were abreast the deckhouse, one on each broadside.Canney, p. 111 The 10-inch Dahlgren weighed and could fire a shell up to a range of at +19¬∞ elevation. The nine-inch gun weighed and could fire a shell to a range of at an elevation of +15¬∞.Olmstead, et al, pp. 87‚Äì88 Ozark was chosen as the testbed for an experimental \\"underwater battery\\" that consisted of a nine-inch Dahlgren gun firing through a pipe in the side of the hull below the waterline. Cost overruns caused the project to be cancelled in January 1863 before it could be tested. The cylindrical Ericsson-style turret was armored with six layers of wrought iron plates. The forward of the hull was protected by two layers of plates that extended below the waterline. Aft of the bow section, the hull's armor consisted of two layers of plates. The ship's deck was protected by iron plates one inch thick. Construction and service Engraving of USS Ozark The contract for Ozark, the first ship of that name in the United States Navy and named for the Ozark Tribe of the Quapaw Indians,Ozark was awarded to George C. Bestor on 14 May 1862. He subcontracted the ship's construction to Hambleton, Collier & Co. at their Mound City Marine Ways shipyard in Mound City, Illinois. Ozark was laid down in 1862 and launched on 18 February 1863. She was towed to St. Louis for fitting out and arrived there on 27 February.Webber, p. 781 Ozark commissioned on 18 February 1864, with Acting Volunteer Lieutenant George W. Brown in command. She cost about $215,000. Ozark spent her entire Union Navy career serving in the Mississippi River Squadron. From 12 March to 22 May 1864, she took part in the Rear Admiral David Porter's Red River Expedition to Alexandria, Louisiana. During the retreat down the Red River, Ozark was trapped above the falls at Alexandria, along with most of the other ironclads of the Mississippi Squadron, when the river's water level unexpectedly began to fall. Two temporary dams, known as Bailey's Dam, had to be built in April‚ÄìMay to raise the water level high enough to allow the ironclads to proceed downstream.Konstam, p. 21 After the end of the campaign, Ozark was assigned to the Third District, patrolling the Mississippi River between Morganza, Louisiana and Fort Adams, Mississippi.Joiner, p. 172 Following the end of the war, she was decommissioned at Mound City on 24 July 1865 and was sold 29 November. The identity of her purchaser is not known, nor are her activities after her sale, but Ozark was still in service in late 1873 and based at New Orleans. Louisiana governor William Pitt Kellogg used the ship to transport 35 soldiers of the 19th Infantry Regiment and 25 mounted members of the New Orleans Metropolitan Police to Colfax, Louisiana in October to apprehend the perpetrators of the Colfax Massacre.Keith, pp. 122‚Äì24 Due to widespread resistance by local whites, only a few men were arrested and transported to New Orleans by Ozark to stand trial in December. Prosecution witnesses were transported and housed in the ship during the trials in February‚ÄìMarch 1874 to protect them from threats made by white supremacists.

System and published by Namco. Controlling a young girl named Alice, the player must complete each of the game's nine stages while avoiding enemies and falling off ledges. Alice can blow powerful bubbles at enemies to knock them back, and can hit them enough times to send them off the platform. It is the first Japanese adaptation of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and ran on the Namco System 1 arcade board. Development was handled by N.H. System, a short- lived subsidiary of Namco, with character design by famed anime director Katsuhiko Nishijima. It is Namco's second game to feature a female protagonist, following Wonder Momo. The word \\"m√§rchen\\" is the German world for \\"fairy tale\\". A PC-Engine version was released in 1990, which replaced the isometric view with an overhead one, followed by a 1991 Sharp X68000 port. M√§rchen Maze received mixed reviews; although its visuals and controls were praised, critics disliked the sharp rise in difficulty and mediocre boss fights. It was digitally re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2009. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. The player must take control of Alice, as she makes her way through nine isometric stages. Alice is able to blow bubbles at enemies to knock them off the platforms and she can collect various powerups along the way. Holding the fire button down generates bigger bubbles, but if it is held down for too long, it will burst and she will start blowing a new one. The enemies retaliate by shooting marbles at her (which can cause her to fall over the edge of the platforms unless they are avoided or jumped over). The seventh, eighth and ninth stages are palette-swapped versions of the second, fourth and first ones respectively, but they feature different enemy types and bosses. Plot One night, Alice falls asleep while reading a fairy tale picture book and is awaken by a call from within a wall mirror. A rabbit appears in the mirror and tells her that his country and eight other lands has been conquered by an evil witch known as the Queen of Darkness and Alice is the only child who has love and courage to restore peace. The girl is pulled inside the mirror world and given a magic straw to attack with soap bubbles. After the Queen is defeated, Alice wakes up thinking it was just a nightmare, but finds the phrase \\" you!\\" written on the mirror and on a cake. Development and release M√§rchen Maze was published by Namco in Japan for arcades in July 1988 ‚Äî development itself was handled by N.H. System, a very short-lived subsidiary of Namco. It was the first Japanese video game adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, predating games such as TwinBee Yahho! and Fushigi no Yume no Alice. The word \\"m√§rchen\\" is the German word for fairy tale. Character design was done by Katsuhiko Nishijima, who directed several well-regarded anime series such as Outlanders, Vampire Hunter D and Agent Aika. It is Namco's second video game to have a female protagonist, following Wonder Momo (1987). An English version of the game, titled Alice in Wonderland, is also known to exist. A version for the PC-Engine was released in 1990, which replaced the isometric angle with an overhead view due to hardware restraints ‚Äî character design for this port was done by Gundam artist Kouichi Tokita. A 1991 Sharp X68000 conversion was done by SPS, which is near- identical to the original. Reception and legacy M√§rchen Maze, notably the PC-Engine release, received mostly mixed reviews ‚Äî while critics praised its graphics and controls, many would criticize its difficulty for drastically spiking up later on and for its unimpressive boss fights. The May 1991 issue of German magazine Play Time praised the PC-Engine version's \\"well matched\\" graphics and amount of action, although would criticize the difficulty for being too hard, namely in the first stage. They also disliked the game's sound effects, jokingly stating that the player would likely instead want to turn on their stereo instead of listening to them. In a retrospective review, Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 liked the game's cute visuals and controls, although stated the game \\"ran out of steam midway through\\" for its drastic rise in difficulty and mediocre boss fights. Famitsu would dislike the PC- Engine version's difficulty for being too drastic early on, although would praise its aesthetic and tight controls. PC-Engine Fan magazine had a similar response, applauding its controls, visuals and soundtrack while disliking its uninteresting boss fights and high difficulty level, notably on the first stage of the game. Japanese magazine Gamest awarded the arcade version the 7th \\"Best Graphic\\" and 8th \\"Best VGM\\", as well as the 31st \\"Annual Hit Game\\" award in January 1998. They would go on to praise the game's faithfulness to the source material, saying that it was \\"superbly expressed\\". In 1998, the Naniwa (the game's equivalents of Tweedledee and Tweedledum) went on to lend their name to one of the new stadiums (the Naniwa Dome), for the Namco System 12-era World Stadium games, but they did not appear in the Namco All Stars' lineup. In 2002, Alice was featured as a secret playable character in Family Tennis Advance. In 2005, Yujin released gashapon figures of Alice and Tokei Usagi (the game's equivalent of the White Rabbit) as part of their \\"Namco Girls\\" collection, even though the latter is male. The game's music is included in several of Namco compilation soundtracks. A digital download of the game was released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2009.

The instrument became obsolete partly because most of its mechanics were too sensitive, needing constant adjustment. The only pieces in the general repertoire to feature the luth√©al are L'enfant et les sortil√®ges (1920‚Äì25) and Tzigane (1924) by Maurice Ravel. History The attachment was created by the Belgian organ builder Georges Cloetens, who first patented it on 28 January 1919 and named it the \\"Jeu de harpe tir√©e\\".Cotte, Roger J. V. 2001. \\"Luth√©al [Piano-Luth√©al]\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell. London: Macmillan Publishers. Maurice Ravel used it in Tzigane for violin and piano, and in the opera L'Enfant et les sortil√®ges. It generates a range of colours by adding two treble and two bass stops to a normal grand piano. These enable it to produce, in addition to the normal piano sound, additional timbres resembling cimbalom, harpsichord, and harp (or lute).Hugh Davies, \\"Instrumental Modifications and Extended Performance Techniques\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers). The luth√©al was, in Ravel's day, a comparatively new piano attachment that had several registrations that could be engaged by pulling stops above the keyboard. One of these registrations had a cimbalom-like sound, which fitted well with the gypsy-esque idea of the composition. The printed version of the original score of the Tzigane piece contained instructions for these register-changes during execution. The Luth√©al, however, did not survive: by the end of the 20th century the first print of the luth√©al version of the accompaniment was still at the publishers, but the chamber version of the piece had long been performed in Ravel's alternative specification for the ordinary piano. A surviving original luth√©al was discovered in storage in the museum of the Brussels Conservatory and has been restored by Evert Snel from The Netherlands to playing condition. Evert Snel made a copy of the lutheal in a Fazioli grand piano. A new instrument was commissioned in 1987 by the French government on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of Ravel's death, and is now in the Mus√©e de la Musique, Paris. Revivals Violinist Daniel Hope recorded in 20042004 album East Meets West: East Meets West a performance of Ravel's Tzigane that features a reconstructed luth√©al, which Hope describes in a National Public Radio interview as \\"a cross between a typewriter and an organ that attaches to the strings of a piano\\" and produces \\"an amazing sound world.\\"2008 interview: \\"The Glamorous Life Of Daniel Hope\\", NPR.org.

These event occurrences may stem from arbitrary sources in both software or hardware such as operating systems, database management systems, application software and processors. Event monitoring may use a time series database.  Basic concepts  Event monitoring makes use of a logical bus to transport event occurrences from sources to subscribers, where event sources signal event occurrences to all event subscribers and event subscribers receive event occurrences. An event bus can be distributed over a set of physical nodes such as standalone computer systems. Typical examples of event buses are found in graphical systems such as X Window System, Microsoft Windows as well as development tools such as SDT. Event collection is the process of collecting event occurrences in a filtered event log for analysis. A filtered event log is logged event occurrences that can be of meaningful use in the future; this implies that event occurrences can be removed from the filtered event log if they are useless in the future. Event log analysis is the process of analyzing the filtered event log to aggregate event occurrences or to decide whether or not an event occurrence should be signalled. Event signalling is the process of signalling event occurrences over the event bus. Something that is monitored is denoted the monitored object; for example, an application, an operating system, a database, hardware etc. can be monitored objects. A monitored object must be properly conditioned with event sensors to enable event monitoring, that is, an object must be instrumented with event sensors to be a monitored object. Event sensors are sensors that signal event occurrences whenever an event occurs. Whenever something is monitored, the probe effect must be managed. Monitored objects and the probe effect As discussed by Gait,J. Gait (1985). A debugger for concurrent programs. Software-Practice And Experience, 15(6) when an object is monitored, its behavior is changed. In particular, in any concurrent system in which processes can run in parallel, this poses a particular problem. The reason is that whenever sensors are introduced in the system, processes may execute in a different order. This can cause a problem if, for example, we are trying to localize a fault, and by monitoring the system we change its behavior in such a way that the fault may not result in a failure; in essence, the fault can be masked by monitoring the system. The probe effect is the difference in behavior between a monitored object and its un-instrumented counterpart. According to Sch√ºtz,W. Sch√ºtz (1994). Fundamental issues in testing distributed real-time systems. Real-Time Systems, 7(2):129‚Äì157 we can avoid, compensate for, or ignore the probe effect. In critical real-time system, in which timeliness (i.e., the ability of a system to meet time constraints such as deadlines) is significant, avoidance is the only option. If we, for example, instrument a system for testing and then remove the instrumentation before delivery, this invalidates the results of most testing based on the complete system. In less critical real-time system (e.g., media-based systems), compensation can be acceptable for, for example, performance testing. In non-concurrent systems, ignorance is acceptable, since the behavior with respect to the order of execution is left unchanged. Event log analysis Event log analysis is known as event composition in active databases, chronicle recognition in artificial intelligence and as real-time logic evaluation in real-time systems. Essentially, event log analysis is used for pattern matching, filtering of event occurrences, and aggregation of event occurrences into composite event occurrences. Commonly, dynamic programming strategies from algorithms are employed to save results of previous analyses for future use, since, for example, the same pattern may be match with the same event occurrences in several consecutive analysis processing. In contrast to general rule processing (employed to assert new facts from other facts, cf. inference engine) that is usually based on backtracking techniques, event log analysis algorithms are commonly greedy; for example, when a composite is said to have occurred, this fact is never revoked as may be done in a backtracking based algorithm. Several mechanisms have been proposed for event log analysis: finite state automata, Petri nets, procedural (either based on an imperative programming language or an object-oriented programming languages), a modification of Boyer‚ÄìMoore string search algorithm, and simple temporal networks.

A member of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, Rappolt spent five turbulent months in the Parliament of Queensland in 1998. A native of Cairns, Rappolt held a variety of jobs before he entered politics. He served in the Citizens' Military Force from 1957 until 1961. In 1961 he began working as an agent for his brother, described by One Nation leader Bill Feldman as a musician \\"of some renown\\". From 1974 to 1978 he ran his own building company, and was a licensed environmental auditor in Queensland and Victoria. During his time as an environmental auditor, Rappolt became interested in mining, and he soon became a mine manager, prospector and financier. He was also a commercial pilot, flying aeroplanes and helicopters for a time. Another interest of Rappolt's was soccer, and he volunteered as a coach and referee at junior level. On 13 June 1998, Rappolt was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, running on the One Nation ticket for the Cairns-area seat of Mulgrave. His parliamentary career lasted a little over four months, and he suffered constant media attacks after the revelation that his partner, Sandra Higgins, had taken out a domestic violence order against him. On 4 November, Rappolt resigned, citing the combined pressures of political life, ill health, and the Queensland press. The resulting by- election was won by Labor candidate Warren Pitt, who had earlier held the then-marginal seat from 1989 until 1995. Pitt's victory gave Labor a majority in its own right; indeed, Mulgrave was one of seven seats that would have gone to Labor in the 1998 election if not for leakage of Coalition preferences. Less than a week after his resignation, Rappolt attempted suicide and was hospitalised with severe depression. After his recovery he sought A$295 000 in damages from the Queensland government, arguing that his stint in Parliament had left him a psychotic manic depressive. He moved to New Zealand in 1999, in an attempt to flee the pressure of public life in Queensland. He was found dead in his home in Auckland, on 2 August 1999, apparently after having hanged himself. At a condolence motion in the Queensland Assembly, One Nation leader Bill Feldman launched a blistering attack on the Courier Mail, claiming that the newspaper was responsible for Rappolt's suicide attempts. Rappolt was survived by his partner Sandra Higgins, and three children.  References  * Queensland Legislative Assembly HANSARD, 17 August 1999, \\"Deaths of Mr C. R. Rappolt and Mr R. B. J.

It stars Alain Delon, Catherine Deneuve and Richard Crenna. Delon had previously worked with Melville on Le Samoura√Ø (1967) and Le Cercle Rouge (1970), playing the role of a criminal. In Un Flic, Delon's role is reversed. He plays the cop, √âdouard Coleman, in pursuit of Simon, a notorious Paris thief who is very hard to pin down. Motto \\"The only feelings mankind has ever inspired in policemen are those of indifference and derision...\\" (Eug√®ne-Fran√ßois Vidocq) Plot Following a raid on a bank in a seaside town, four Parisian gangsters flee after a cashier sets off the alarm with only part of the loot and with one of the men, Marc Albois, wounded by the cashier, who Marc then shoots dead. They put Marc in a private clinic and disperse. Their leader, Simon, owns a night club which is visited regularly by police detective Coleman to keep an eye on Simon and pick up information. Coleman also hopes to see the beautiful Cathy, who is Simon's mistress but spends occasional afternoons with Coleman in a hotel room. Fearing police will find and question Marc, Simon sends Cathy into the clinic dressed as a nurse to give the dying man a fatal air embolism after an attempt to take him away fails. Simon's next project is to steal a large quantity of heroin being transported out of France by a rival gang on the night express from Paris to Lisbon. From a helicopter, he is lowered onto the speeding train in the empty countryside south of Bordeaux, knocks out the courier with chloroform, and is successfully winched up with the drugs. Coleman, knowing the dead Marc was friends with Louis Costa, arrests him and gets him to confess the names of his accomplices. Coleman goes to the club and questions Simon, who denies he knows Marc or Louis. Simon immediately telephones the fourth member of the gang, Paul, a former bank manager, to warn him, but police arrive before he can flee and Paul shoots himself. Simon hides out in a hotel and rings Cathy to pick him up. However, police have tapped Cathy's phone and, as Simon emerges from the hotel carrying an attach√© case full of heroin, the waiting Coleman draws a gun and challenges him. As Simon seems to be reaching inside his coat for a gun, Coleman shoots him dead while Cathy watches helplessly from her car. However, when Coleman inspects Simon's body, he finds he had no gun, leading him to think it was suicide by cop. Coleman is called away on another case, leaving a pensive Cathy alone. The film ends with a prolonged shot on Coleman's face as he drives away.

He was born in Perth and educated at the University of Edinburgh.  Family  The fourth child and youngest son of James Paton Bramwell (1824‚Äì1890), chief consulting surgeon at the Perth Royal Infirmary and Eleanor Bramwell, n√©e Oliver (1821‚Äì1901), John Milne Bramwell was born in Perth, Scotland on 11 May 1852. One of his sisters, Elizabeth Ida Bramwell (1858‚Äì1940), become famous in Canada as the suffragette Ida Douglas- Fearn. A second sister, Eleanor Oliver Bramwell (1861‚Äì1923), married Frank Podmore (1855‚Äì1910), psychical researcher, member of the Society for Psychical Research and founding member of the Fabian Society. He married Mary Harriet Reynolds (c. 1851 ‚Äì 27 May 1913) ‚Äî the eldest surviving daughter of Captain Charles Sheppard Reynolds (1818‚Äì1853), formerly of the 49th Regiment, Bengal Native Infantry, and Assistant-Commissioner of the Assam Provinces, and Jessie Bramwell, n√©e Blanch (1825‚Äì?), who had been born in Assam, India ‚Äî at St. John the Evangelist Church, at East Dulwich, on 6 July 1875.Marriage: Bramwell‚ÄîReynolds, The British Medical Journal, No.759, (17 July 1875), p. 90. They had two children: Mary Eleanor Oliver Bramwell (c.1876-?) and Elsie Dorothy Constant, n√©e Bramwell (1880‚Äì1968). He died on 16 January 1925 at the Miramare Palace Grand Hotel in Ospedaletti, Italy.  Education  Educated at Perth Grammar School and Edinburgh University, he graduated M.B. C.M. (Medicinae Baccalaureus, Chirurgiae Magister) at Edinburgh University in 1873,University of Edinburgh (1889), p.24. in the same cohort as Charles Braid (1850‚Äì1897), the grandson of James Braid.University of Edinburgh (1889), p.23.  Medical practice  When Bramwell graduated from Edinburgh University, the Liverpool, Brazil, and River Plate Steam Ship Company appointed him as a surgeon. In the year that he worked for them he made three return trips to Brazil. Then, for a short time, he was assistant-surgeon at the Perth City and County Infirmary, before he moved to Goole in Yorkshire, where he worked as a general practitioner, in partnership with Malcolm Morris (1847‚Äì1924) FRCS (Edinburgh) and later with the noted dermatologist Sir Malcolm Morris KCVO of St Mary's Hospital, London. Bramwell continued to practise in Goole for sixteen years until his interest and skills in hypnotism drew him to London in November 1892Gauld (1992), p.350. where he became a highly respected specialist in medical hypnotism.  Hypnotism  His father had seen James Esdaile (1808‚Äì1859) at work and, as a child, Bramwell had seen his father replicate Esdaile's mesmeric experiments. While studying medicine at Edinburgh University, he was influenced by John Hughes Bennett (1812‚Äì1875), author of The Mesmeric Mania of 1851, With a Physiological Explanation of the Phenomena Produced (1851), who revived Bramwell's interest in hypnotism. On 28 March 1890 Bramwell gave a public demonstration in Leeds of the use of hypnotism for dental and surgical an√¶sthesia.Demonstration of Hypnotism as an An√¶sthetic During the Performance of Dental and Surgical Operations, The Lancet, Vol.135, No.3475, (5 April 1890), pp.771-772; Hypnotism as an An√¶sthetic in Surgery, The British Medical Journal, No.1528, (12 April 1890), pp.849-850. Bramwell, Hypnotism, etc. (1903), pp.163-167. He travelled widely in Europe and visited most of the important centres of hypnotism. He also directly observed the work of Hippolyte Bernheim (1840‚Äì1919) in Nancy, Jean-Martin Charcot (1825‚Äì1893) at the Salp√™tri√®re in Paris, Frederik Willem van Eeden (1860‚Äì1932) and Albert Willem van Renterghem (1846‚Äì1939) in Amsterdam, Ambroise-Auguste Li√©beault (1823‚Äì1904) in Nancy and Otto Georg Wetterstrand (1845‚Äì1907) in Stockholm, at their respective clinics. Bramwell, who had visited Charcot, the famous French neurologist, founder of the \\"Hysteria School\\" at the Salp√™tri√®re hospital in Paris, characterised Charcot and his work as a throwback to mesmerism. Pitres' 1884 diagram of the 'hypnogenetic zones' and 'hypno-arresting zones' on his patient, \\"Paule C‚Äî\\" Around 1885 an associate of Charcot, Albert Pitres, another famous French neurologist at the Salp√™tri√®re hospital, in a throwback to phreno-mesmerism, went even further, claiming that he had discovered zones hypnog√®nes, or \\"hypnogenetic zones\\" which, he said, when stimulated threw people into the hypnotic state, and zones hypnofr√©natrices or \\"hypno-arresting zones\\", which, when stimulated, abruptly threw people out of that same hypnotic state (Pitres, 1891, passim). Bramwell also visited Nancy on two occasions. From his observations and discussions there he felt that Hippolyte Bernheim and Ambroise-Auguste Li√©beault had done little except reproduce Braid's earliest findings. Bramwell was also certain that they knew nothing about Braid's later developments of his theories and practices, his amended terminology and his mature understanding of the applications of hypnotic suggestion. In Bramwell's view, the theoretical position that Braid held at the end of his life (viz., 1860) was considerably more advanced than anything that was promoted by the \\"Suggestion School\\" in Nancy thirty-five years later. Along with other members of the Society for Psychical Research, such as Henry Sidgwick (1838‚Äì1900), William James (1842‚Äì1910), Frederic Myers (1843‚Äì1901), Charles Lloyd Tuckey (1854‚Äì1925), Eleanor Sidgwick (1845‚Äì1936), Edmund Gurney (1847‚Äì1888) and Arthur Myers (1851‚Äì1894) ‚Äî Gurney and the two Myers brothers had visited both the Salp√™tri√®re and Nancy in 1885Gauld, 1992, p.390. ‚Äî Bramwell made a thorough scientific investigation of hypnotism and hypnotic phenomena and, through his lectures, public demonstrations, research and publications did much to increase knowledge of the potential of hypnotism, especially as an effective form of medical intervention.  Promoter and defender of the heritage of James Braid  James Braid (1795‚Äì1860). A talented specialist medical hypnotist and hypnotherapist in his own right, Bramwell made a deep study of the works of James Braid the founder of hypnotism and helped to revive and maintain Braid's legacy in Great Britain. Bramwell had studied medicine at Edinburgh University in the same student cohort as Braid's grandson, Charles. Consequently, due to his Edinburgh studies, especially with Bennett, he was very familiar with Braid and his work; and, more significantly, through Charles Braid, he had access to publications, records, papers, etc. of Braid that were still held by the Braid family. He was, perhaps, second only to Preyer in his wide-ranging familiarity with Braid and his works. In 1896 Bramwell noted that,\\"James Braid: His Work and Writings\\" (1896), p.129. \\"[Braid‚Äôs name] is familiar to all students of hypnotism and is rarely mentioned by them without due credit being given to the important part he played in rescuing that science from ignorance and superstition\\". He found that almost all of those students of hypnotism believed that Braid \\"held many erroneous views\\" and that \\"the researches of more recent investigators [had] disproved [those erroneous views]\\". Finding that \\"few seem to be acquainted with any of [Braid‚Äôs] works except Neurypnology or with the fact that [Neurypnology] was only one of a long series on the subject of hypnotism, and that in the later ones his views completely changed\\", Bramwell was convinced that this ignorance of Braid, which sprang from \\"imperfect knowledge of his writings\\", was further compounded by at least three \\"universally adopted opinions\\"; viz., that Braid was English (Braid was a Scot), \\"believed in phrenology\\" (Braid did not), and \\"knew nothing of suggestion\\" (when, in fact, Braid was its strongest advocate).In fact, rather than Braid \\"believing in\\" phrenology, it is most important to note that Braid‚Äôs own experiments proved eventually that there was no basis for either phrenology or phreno-mesmerism (see Braid's \\"Sources of Fallacy\\" at Bramwell, Hypnotism, etc. (1903), p.144; and Braid, J., \\"Experimental Inquiry, to Determine whether Hypnotic and Mesmeric Manifestations can be Adduced in Proof of Phrenology\\", The Medical Times, Vol.11, No.271, (30 November 1844), pp.181-182. The mistaken view that Braid knew nothing of suggestion ‚Äì and that the entire 'history' of suggestive therapeutics began with the Nancy \\"Suggestion\\" School in the late 1880s ‚Äì had been widely promoted by Hippolyte Bernheim: ::The difference between Braid and the Nancy School, with regard to suggestion, is entirely one of theory, not of practice. Braid employed verbal suggestion in hypnosis just as intelligently as any member of the Nancy school. ::This fact is denied by Bernheim, who says: \\"It is strange that Braid did not think of applying suggestion in its most natural form ‚Äì suggestion by speech ‚Äì to bring about hypnosis and its therapeutic effects. He did not dream of explaining the curative effects of hypnotism by means of the psychical influence of suggestion, but made use of suggestion without knowing it.\\" ::This statement has its sole origin in [Bernheim‚Äôs] ignorance of Braid's later works‚Ä¶ ::[Unlike Bernheim, Braid] did not consider [verbal] suggestion as explanatory of hypnotic phenomena, but‚Ä¶ [he] looked upon it simply as an artifice used in order to excite [those phenomena]. ::[Braid] considered that the mental phenomena were only rendered possible by previous physical changes; and, as the result of these, the operator was enabled to act like an engineer, and to direct the forces which existed in the subject's own person. (Bramwell, 1903, pp.338-339) In 1897, Bramwell wrote on Braid's work for an important French hypnotism journal (\\"James Braid: son ≈ìuvre et ses √©crits\\"). He also wrote another article for the same journal on hypnotism and suggestion, strongly emphasizing the importance of Braid and his work (\\"La Valeur Therapeutique de l'Hypnotisme et de la Suggestion\\"). In his response to Bramwell's article, Bernheim repeated his entirely mistaken view that Braid knew nothing of suggestion (\\"\\"A propos de l'√©tude sur James Braid par le Dr. Milne Bramwell, etc.\\"). Bramwell's response (\\"James Braid et la Suggestion, etc.\\") to Bernheim's misrepresentation was emphatic: ::\\"I answered [Bernheim], giving quotations from Braid's published works, which clearly showed that he not only employed suggestion as intelligently as the members of the Nancy school now do, but also that his conception of its nature was clearer than theirs\\" (Hypnotism, etc. (1913), p.28).In 1896, Bramwell spoke of perusing the collection of \\"800 works by nearly 500 authors\\", listed in Dessoir‚Äôs Bibliographie des Modernen Hypnotismus ['Bibliography of Modern Hypnotism'] (1888), and finding that \\"little of value has been discovered [by any of them] which can justly be considered as supplementary to Braid's later work\\" and that \\"much has been lost through [their] ignorance of his researches\\" (\\"On the Evolution of Hypnotic Theory\\" (1896), p.459). Moreover, Bramwell found \\"the Nancy theories [of \\"Bernheim and his colleagues\\" in] themselves are but an imperfect reproduction of Braid's later ones\\" (\\"On the Evolution of Hypnotic Theory\\", p. 459). In 1913, Bramwell expressed the same opinion of Dessoir's later (1890) collection of 1182 works by 774 authors (Hypnotism, etc. (1913), pp. 274‚Äì275).

Researchers of Pleistocene climate change working at the site have uncovered more than 600 archaeological items in at least ten levels, including twenty hearthsTurk, 2003 and the skeletal remains of cave bears.Yu 2001 According to the museum's statements, the presumed flute has been associated with the \\"end of the middle Pleistocene\\" and with Neanderthals, about 55,000 years ago.The flute from Divje Babe, National Museum of Slovenia, 2005 In the 1920s and 1930s and 1940s, archaeologist Sreƒçko Brodar (father of Mitja Brodar) discovered tens of bones with holes at another site, the Potok Cave () in the Eastern Karawanks, but almost all of them were destroyed during the World War II Italian annexation. Of those still preserved, the best known is a mandible of a cave bear with three holes in the mandibular canal. Potok Cave, a cave in the Eastern Karawanks, where the remains of a human residence, dated to the Aurignacian (40,000 to 30,000 BP), including a bone flute, were found by Sreƒçko Brodar in the 1920s and 1930s. This marks the beginning of Paleolithic research in Slovenia. Since World War II, like specimens have been found in Mokrica Cave () and Betal Rock Shelter (). These bones are preserved today at the National History Museum of Slovenia as well. According to Mitja Brodar, who discovered many of them, bones with holes have been dated only to the end of the Mousterian and the beginning of the Aurignacian, and have not yet been found in Western Europe. Brodar assumes these bones are still not recognized by the international research community due to the fact that most of them were found in France, and the Paleolithic is still considered to be the French's domain. Bones with holes such as those found in the Potok Cave have been ascribed to modern human Cro-Magnon, and Mitja Brodar asserts that they are an element of the Central European Aurignacian. He further posits that the Divje Babe Flute is a product of modern humans, but this has been disputed by other Slovene scholars.  \\"Neanderthal flute\\"  In 1995, archeologist Ivan Turk of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts found the approximately 43,100-year- oldNelson, D.E., Radiocarbon dating of bone and charcoal from Divje babe I cave, cited by Morley, p. 47 cave bear femur at the Divje Babe site near a Mousterian hearth. Because it has the characteristics of a flute, he dubbed it a Neanderthal flute. Whether it is actually a flute created by Neanderthals is a subject of debate. It is broken at both ends, with two complete holes and what may be the incomplete remains of one hole at each end, meaning that the bone may have had four or more holes before being damaged. The bone fragment is the diaphysis of the left femur of a one- to two-year-old cave bear and is long. The maximum diameter of the two complete holes is and . The distance between the centers of the holes is .Kunej and Turk, cited by Morley, p. 47 If the bone is indeed a usable flute, it would be an argument for the existence of music 43 thousand years ago.Chase and Nowell, 2002‚Äì2003\\"Neanderthal Man Moves Up the Evolutionary Scale\\" Times (London), April 5, 1997. Thus Ivan Turk has asserted that, whether the holes are \\"artificial\\" (made by man) or \\"natural\\" (punctures from a carnivore bite), origin is the \\"crucial question.\\" An equally critical issue is that, if the holes in this \\"flute\\" are of artificial origin, to date there does not seem to be any available means to determine whether they were deliberately drilled 43 thousand years ago, or are of a more contemporary origin (as part of an elaborate hoax, perhaps). The bone has become a noted attraction in the National Museum of Slovenia, publicized on official Slovenian websites, aired on TV with tunes played on a clay replica, and is a source of Slovenian national pride. Paintings were made, models constructed, and musicians such as biology professor and flautist Jelle Atema have played them publicly.https://web.archive.org/web/20071007183112/http://sciencenetlinks.org/sci_update.cfm?DocID=37 French-based Italian taphonomist Francesco D'Errico, as well as Claus-Stephan Holdermann, Jordi Serangeli, Philip G. Chase, and April Nowell have all hypothesized its carnivore origin.D'Errico et al., 2003 = Hole-spacing and alignment = The probability that four randomly placed holes would appear in line in a recognizable musical scale is very low according to an analysis made by Canadian musicologist Bob Fink in 2000.source, reproduced at here ; (Fink 2000) Responding to the D'Errico carnivore-origin hypothesis, Turk pointed out that the features \\"common\\" between the carnivore-origin artifact and other chewed bones studied by D'Errico (see Hole shape below) do not include the alignment of the holes. There is also no evidence that the two holes could have been bitten at the same time. The tooth spans were analyzed by all taphonomists concerned to see if any animals could bite two or more such holes at once. No match could be found to any known animals. If a match had been found, it could have been cited as prima facie evidence that the holes were animal-made. This was noted by Turk in his book and was also noted from the opposing hypothesis holders Nowell and Chase in their article in the August/October 1998 issue of Current Anthropology. Nowell wrote that holes in the specimen \\"were almost certainly made sequentially rather than simultaneously and that the distance between them has nothing to do with the distance between any two teeth in a wolf's jaw.\\" Iain Morley, despite his holding the carnivore-origin hypothesis, observed in his November 2006 article that, \\"[w]hilst the collections of cave bear bones examined by D'Errico...as well as those discussed by Turk...do show similar shaped and damaged holes...none of these occur in the diaphysis of a femur,\\" as is found on the reputed flute.(Morley 2006, 329) Marcel Otte (director of the Museum of Prehistory, University of Liege, Belgium) pointed out in an April 2000 article in Current Anthropology that there is a possible thumb-hole on the opposite side of the Divje Babe bone, which, making five holes, would perfectly fit a human hand. Turk wrote in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology book The Origins of Music: \\"If this probability [of having lined-up holes looking like a flute] were greater (and of course it isn't), it is likely that there would have been more such finds, since...carnivores in cave dens were at least as active on bones, if not more so, than people in cave dwellings...\\". In 2015 Cajus G. Diedrich suggested the holes could be explained by scavenging from spotted hyena. = Hole shape = D'Errico made an analysis of the artifact in comparison to cave-bear bone accumulations where no hominid presence was known. They published photos of several bones with holes in them which had more or less circular holes similar to those found in the artifact, but they did not have a single bone coming even close to the linear alignment of Turk's holes. Ignoring the probability of the alignment of the holes, D'Errico's interpretation was that it was possible for the holes to have been made by an animal, and they concluded that of the available options this was the most likely. D'Errico insisted on ignoring the probability of the alignment of the holes and, even after having analyzed the artifact firsthand, claimed that \\"the presence of two or possibly three perforations on the suggested flute cannot therefore be considered as evidence of human manufacture, as this is a common feature in the studied sample.\\"Journal of World Pre-history pp. 36‚Äì39, Vol 17, #1, March 2003. Turk conducted laboratory experiments which pierced holes in fresh bear bones in the manner of carnivore punctures, and in every case, the bones split. Yet in the Divje Babe instance, the bone did not break, a fact not matching expectations of carnivore action, as Turk's results showed. Turk wrote, in his book and in his article in MIT's Origins of Music anthology, the bone shows no \\"counter-bites\\" that one would normally expect on the other side of the bone matching the immense pressure necessary for a bite to make the center holes. Turk's 1997 book reported that the holes have similar diameters which would accommodate fingertips, and all are circular instead of oval (as carnivore bites often are). Furthermore, all are in the proper ratio of bore size to hole size found in most flutes, and the bone is the kind (femur) usually used for bone flutes. An examination of the specimen using computed tomography was published in 2005 by Ivan Turk, in which he concluded that \\"the two partially preserved holes were formerly created before the damage...or before the indisputable intervention of a carnivore.\\" The National Museum of Slovenia argues that this evidence has \\"finally refuted hypotheses that the bone was perforated because of a bear bite\\". The manufacture by Neanderthals \\"is reliably proven\\" and its significance in the understanding of their capabilities and the development of music and speech is secure. = Bone marrow = The issue of how much bone marrow remains in the artifact is important, because the making of flutes from bone usually includes removing the marrow. Turk et al. (in the volume Moussterian Bone Flute, p. 160) wrote that \\"the marrow cavity is basically cleaned of spongiose. The colour of the marrow cavity does not differ from the colour of the external surface of the bone. So we may conclude that the marrow cavity was already open at the time.... Otherwise, it would be a darker colour than the surface of the bone, as we know from coloured marrow cavities of whole limb bones.\\" April Nowell stated in an interview that \\"at Turk's invitation, [Nowell] and Chase went to Slovenia last year... They came away even more skeptical that the bear bone had ever emitted music. For one thing, both ends had clearly been gnawed away by something, perhaps a wolf, seeking greasy marrow. The holes could have simply been perforated in the process by pointed canine or carnassial teeth, and their roundness could be due to natural damage after the bone was abandoned. The presence of marrow suggests that no one had bothered to hollow out the bone as if to create an end-blown flute. Says Nowell, '[Turk's] willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, whereas we're not.' \\" =Diatonic scale= Illustration of the diatonic flute by Bob Fink. Bob Fink claimed in his essay in 1997, that the bone's holes were \\"consistent with four notes of the diatonic scale\\" (do, re, mi, fa) based on the spacing of those four holes. The spacing of the holes on a modern diatonic (minor scale) flute are unique, and not evenly spaced. In essence, Fink said, they are like a simple fingerprint. The Divje Babe bone's holes matched those spacings very closely to a series of note-holes in a minor scale. Nowell and Chase wrote in Studies In Music Archaeology III that the juvenile bear bone was too short to play those four holes in tune to any diatonic series of tones and half- tones.Edgar 1998 (Fink had suggested there may have originally been a mouthpiece extension added to the bone before it was broken.) :[Nowell] along with archeologist Philip Chase, had serious doubts as soon as they saw photos of the bone on the Internet.... The Divje Babe bone bears some resemblance to the dozens of younger, uncontested bone flutes from European Upper Paleolithic [UP] sites. But, says Nowell, these obvious flutes are longer, have more holes, and exhibit telltale tool marks left from their manufacture. No such marks occur on the bear bone. Fink proposed that the spacing of the flute's holes matches music's standard diatonic scale. ...Nowell and Chase teamed with a more musically inclined colleague to show that the bear bone would need to be twice its natural total length to conform to a diatonic scale... In a 2011 article, Matija Turk published the results of a collaboration with Ljuben Dimkaroski, an academic musician who had made replicas of the artifact. The authors argue that the instrument encompassed a range of two and a half octaves, which can be extended to three octaves by overblowing. Dimkaroski created over 30 wooden and bone replicas of the flute and experimented with them. The replicas were made from femurs of juvenile brown bears provided by the Hunters Association of Slovenia, but also calf, goat, pig, roe and red deer bones. In the end, he concentrated on playing a replica made on a femur of a juvenile cave bear from Divje Babe I Cave, to come as close as possible to the dimensions of the original.

Broadwater Charles Arthur Broadwater (September 25, 1840-May 24, 1892) was a wealthy and influential Montana railroad, real estate, and banking magnate. Broadwater was born in St. Charles, Missouri. He was president of the Montana Central Railway, a spur line which ran between Great Falls, Montana Helena and Butte, Montana. He opened the Montana National Bank in Helena, and had extensive real estate holdings in the state. Montana's Broadwater County is named after him. Broadwater began his career in 1862 as a livestock trader in the gold rush town of Bannack, Montana. He soon extended his interests into transportation, becoming superintendent of the large Diamond R Freighting Company, which dominated shipping in the Territory of Montana before the coming of the railroads. In the 1870s, Broadwater allied himself with James J. Hill, founder of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway, which, in 1890, became the Great Northern Railway (U.S.). Broadwater was also one of the Democratic \\"Big Four\\" of early Montana politics, along with Marcus Daly, William A. Clark, and Samuel T. Hauser. The Hotel Broadwater and Natatorium. He may, however, be best remembered for the luxurious but ill-fated Hotel Broadwater and Natatorium, which he built near Helena between 1888 and 1889. He hoped to capitalize on Montana's newfound mining elite and the wealth that came along with it but although the hotel was the last word in luxury and innovation it was never able to draw the wealthy crowds that Charles Broadwater predicted. Broadwater died at his hotel in Helena, Montana on May 24, 1892 of the effects of influenza contracted in New York the previous year. More than 5,000 people attended his funeral.

Stuart was also a former England Under-19 international Career =West Bromwich Albion= Nicholson, made his debut for West Bromwich Albion on 17 January 2006, coming on as an extra-time substitute in a 3‚Äì2 FA Cup defeat away at Reading. He made his Premiership debut four days later in the 1‚Äì0 loss against Sunderland at The Hawthorns, when he replaced Nathan Ellington, whom he describes as his childhood hero. He won the West Bromwich Albion Young Player of the Year award for 2005‚Äì06 and earned the nickname \\"The Knife\\" for his sharpness in front of goal. He was given a place in the first team squad for the 2006‚Äì07 season, and marked his first start with a goal against Leyton Orient on 24 August in the first round of the League Cup. =Bristol Rovers= Nicholson joined Bristol Rovers on loan in November 2006. Unusually for someone born in the north-east of England, he has been a fan of the club since being given a Bristol Rovers shirt as a present when he was 14. The loan was due to last three months, but Nicholson was recalled four weeks early by West Brom, before returning to Bristol Rovers for a second loan spell during the same season. He scored a brace on 17 March 2007 against Notts County and followed it up with the winner against Stockport County on 20 March, both games at the Memorial Stadium. A stomach injury then kept him out of the team, and his loan spell was cut short in April when he returned to West Brom to have a hernia operation. =Shrewsbury Town= In August 2007 Nicholson joined Shrewsbury Town on a scheduled season-long loan. However, Nicholson did not see eye to eye with Gary Peters and by December he had found the net just once for the Shrews in 14 league appearances. On 18 December it was announced that he had returned to Albion due to an ongoing \\"personal problem\\", with his loan spell at Shrewsbury set to be officially ended in January. =Wrexham= On 18 January 2008 Nicholson joined Wrexham on a three-month loan deal. In April Albion confirmed that they would release the player in the summer when his existing contract expires. =Newcastle Blue Star= He signed with Newcastle Blue Star in August 2008. On 7 November Nicholson joined A.F.C. Bournemouth on a week's trial,Bournemouth could not meet the asking price having been made available for transfer by Newcastle Blue Star after making five substitute appearances scoring in all up to that point in the 2008‚Äì09 season. After having been released by Blue Star midway through the 2008‚Äì09 season, Nicholson trained with Blyth Spartans =Tamworth= Nicholson's next move was a return to the midlands to team up with Conference North side Tamworth in January, 2009. He made his debut for Tamworth on 27 January 2009 against King's Lynn in a home Conference North fixture in a year that Tamworth won promotion to the Conference National. Stuart was given the number 9 shirt and after 2 months he handed in a transfer request due to the fact Mills wanted to play him as a lone striker and at Nicholsons stature and to the dislike of Gary Mills he was put on gardening leave. =Preston Lions FC= Preston Lions FC has signed former West Bromwich Albion striker Stuart Nicholson for the 2015 Victorian State League 1 NW season.

True nomads follow an irregular pattern of movement, in contrast with transhumance where seasonal pastures are fixed. However this distinction is often not observed and the term nomad used for both‚Äîin historical cases the regularity of movements is often unknown in any case. The herded livestock include cows, buffalos, yaks, llamas, sheep, goats, reindeer, horses, donkeys or camels, or mixtures of species. Nomadic pastoralism is commonly practised in regions with little arable land, typically in the developing world, especially in the steppe lands north of the agricultural zone of Eurasia. Of the estimated 30‚Äì40 million nomadic pastoralists worldwide, most are found in central Asia and the Sahel region of North and West Africa, such as Fulani, Tuaregs, and Toubou, with some also in the Middle East, such as traditionally Bedouins, and in other parts of Africa, such as Nigeria and Somalia. Increasing numbers of stock may lead to overgrazing of the area and desertification if lands are not allowed to fully recover between one grazing period and the next. Increased enclosure and fencing of land has reduced the amount of land for this practice. There is substantive uncertainty over the extent to which the various causes for degradation affect grassland. Different causes have been identified which include overgrazing, mining, agricultural reclamation, pests and rodents, soil properties, tectonic activity, and climate change. Simultaneously, it is maintained that some, such as overgrazing and overstocking, may be overstated while others, such as climate change, mining and agricultural reclamation, may be under reported. In this context, there is also uncertainty as to the long term effect of human behavior on the grassland as compared to non-biotic factors. Origin A boy herding a flock of sheep in India Nomadic pastoralism was a result of the Neolithic revolution and the rise of agriculture. During that revolution, humans began domesticating animals and plants for food and started forming cities. Nomadism generally has existed in symbiosis with such settled cultures trading animal products (meat, hides, wool, cheese and other animal products) for manufactured items not produced by the nomadic herders. Henri Fleisch tentatively suggested the Shepherd Neolithic industry of Lebanon may date to the Epipaleolithic and that it may have been used by one of the first cultures of nomadic shepherds in the Beqaa valley.Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Pr√©histoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air.

Bar-Yosef and A. Khazanov, eds. \\"Pastoralism in the Levant\\" In Bronze Age Central Asia, nomadic populations are associated with the earliest transmissions of millet and wheat grains through the region that eventually became central for the Silk Road. By the medieval period in Central Asia, nomadic communities exhibited isotopically diverse diets, suggesting a multitude of subsistence strategies. Nomadic pattern in season Reindeer milking in a forest; western Finnmark, late 1800s Often traditional nomadic groups settle into a regular seasonal pattern of transhumance. An example of a normal nomadic cycle in the northern hemisphere is: * Spring (early April to the end of June) ‚Äì transition * Summer (end of June to late September) ‚Äì a higher plateau * Autumn (mid-September to end of November) ‚Äì transition * Winter (from December to the end of March) ‚Äì desert plains.Beck, Lois (1991) \\"Nomad: a year in the life of nomadic Qashqa'i tribesman in Iran\\" (University of California Press) The movements in this example are about 180 to 200 km. Camps are established in the same place each year; often semi-permanent shelters are built in at least one place on this migration route. In sub- regions such as Chad, the nomadic pastoralist cycle is as follows: * In the rainy season, the groups live in a village intended for a comfortable stay. The villages are often made of sturdy material as clay. Old men and women remain in this village when the other people move the herds in the dry season. * In the dry season, the people move their herds to southern villages with a more temporary character. They then move inland, where they stay in tent camps. In Chad, the sturdy villages are called hill√©, the less sturdy villages are called dankhout and the tents ferik.Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen David Christian's account David Christian made the following observations about pastoralism.David Christian, A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, 1998, pp 81-98 and passim The agriculturist lives from domesticated plants and the pastoralist lives from domesticated animals. Since animals are higher on the food chain, pastoralism supports a thinner population than agriculture. Pastoralism predominates where low rainfall makes farming impractical. Full pastoralism required the Secondary products revolution when animals began to be used for wool, milk, riding and traction as well as meat. Where grass is poor herds must be moved, which leads to nomadism. Some peoples are fully nomadic while others live in sheltered winter camps and lead their herds into the steppe in summer. Some nomads travel long distances, usually north in summer and south in winter. Near mountains, herds are led uphill in summer and downhill in winter (transhumance). Pastoralists often trade with or raid their agrarian neighbors. Christian distinguished ‚ÄòInner Eurasia‚Äô, which was pastoral with a few hunter-gatherers in the far north, from ‚ÄòOuter Eurasia‚Äô, a crescent of agrarian civilizations from Europe through India to China. High civilization is based on agriculture where tax-paying peasants support landed aristocrats, kings, cities, literacy and scholars. Pastoral societies are less developed and as a result, according to Christian, more egalitarian. One tribe would often dominate its neighbors, but these ‚Äòempires‚Äô usually broke up after a hundred years or so. The heartland of pastoralism is the Eurasian steppe. In the center of Eurasia pastoralism extended south to Iran and surrounded agrarian oasis cities. When pastoral and agrarian societies went to war, horse-borne mobility counterbalanced greater numbers. Attempts by agrarian civilizations to conquer the steppe usually failed until the last few centuries. Pastoralists frequently raided and sometimes collected regular tribute from their farming neighbors. Especially in north China and Iran, they would sometimes conquer agricultural societies, but these dynasties were usually short-lived and broke up when the nomads became ‚Äòcivilized‚Äô and lost their warlike virtues. Around the world A camel trader in Hargeisa, Somalia. Nomadic pastoralism was historically widespread throughout less fertile regions of Earth. It is found in areas of low rainfall such as the Arabian Peninsula inhabited by Bedouins, as well as Northeast Africa inhabited by Somalis (where camel, cattle, sheep and goat nomadic pastoralism is especially common). Nomadic transhumance is also common in areas of harsh climate, such as Northern Europe and Russia inhabited by the indigenous Sami people, Nenets people and Chukchis. There are an estimated 30‚Äì40 million nomads in the world.NOMADS ‚Äì The FACTS Pastoral nomads and semi-nomadic pastoralists form a significant but declining minority in such countries as Saudi Arabia (probably less than 3%), Iran (4%), and Afghanistan (at most 10%). They comprise less than 2% of the population in the countries of North Africa except Libya and Mauritania.Dale Eickelman, The Middle East and Central Asia. An Anthropological Approach. Fourth Edition. Prentice Hall, 2002, p. 11 The Eurasian steppe has been largely populated by pastoralist nomads since the late prehistoric times, with a succession of peoples known by the names given to them by surrounding literate sedentary societies, including the Bronze Age Proto-Indo-Europeans, and later Proto-Indo-Iranians, Scythians, Sarmatians, Cimmerians, Massagetae, Alans, Pechenegs, Cumans, Kipchaks, Karluks, Saka, Yuezhi, Wusun, Jie, Xiongnu, Xianbei, Khitan, Pannonian Avars, Huns, Mongols, Dzungars and various Turkics. The Mongols in what is now Mongolia, Russia and China, and the Tatars or Turkic people of Eastern Europe and Central Asia were nomadic people who practiced nomadic transhumance on harsh Asian steppes. Some remnants of these populations are nomadic to this day. In Mongolia, about 40% of the population continues to live a traditional nomadic lifestyle.Mongolia Today ‚Äì online magazine In China, it is estimated that a little over five million herders are dispersed over the pastoral counties, and more than 11 million over the semi-pastoral counties. This brings the total of the (semi)nomadic herder population to over 16 million, in general living in remote, scattered and resource-poor communities. Tuareg nomads in southern Algeria In the Middle Hills and Himalaya of Nepal, people living above about 2,000 m practise transhumance and nomadic pastoralism because settled agriculture becomes less productive due to steep slopes, cooler temperatures and limited irrigation possibilities. Distances between summer and winter pasture may be short, for example in the vicinity of Pokhara where a valley at about 800 meters elevation is less than 20 km. from alpine pastures just below the Annapurna Himalaya, or distances may be 100 km or more. For example, in Rapti zone some 100 km west of Pokhara the Kham Magar move their herds between winter pastures just north of India and summer pastures on the southern slopes of Dhaulagiri Himalaya. In far western Nepal, ethnic Tibetans living in Dolpo and other valleys north among the high Himalaya moved their herds north to winter on the plains of the upper Brahmaputra basin in Tibet proper, until this practice was prohibited after China took over Tibet in 1950‚Äì51. The nomadic Sami people, an indigenous people of northern Finland, Sweden, Norway, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia, practise a form of nomadic transhumance based on reindeer. In the 14th and 15th century, when reindeer population was sufficiently reduced that Sami could not subsist on hunting alone, some Sami, organized along family lines, became reindeer herders. Each family has traditional territories on which they herd, arriving at roughly the same time each season. Only a small fraction of Sami have subsisted on reindeer herding over the past century; as the most colorful part of the population, they are well known. But as elsewhere in Europe, transhumance is dying out. The Mesta was an association of sheep owners, (Spanish nobility and religious orders) that had an important economic and political role in medieval Castile. To preserve the rights of way of its transhumant herds through ca√±adas, the Mesta acted against small peasants. In Chad, nomadic pastoralists include the Zaghawa, Kreda, and Mimi. Farther north in Egypt and western Libya, the Bedouins also practice pastoralism. Cross-border pastoralism Sometimes nomadic pastoralists move their herds across international borders in search of new grazing terrain or for trade. This cross-border activity can occasionally lead to tensions with national governments as this activity is often informal and beyond their control and regulation. In East Africa, for example, over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels and the unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure).Pavanello, Sara 2010. Working across borders - Harnessing the potential of cross-border activities to improve livelihood security in the Horn of Africa drylands. London: Overseas Development Institute This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments are unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues. There have been initiatives seeking to promote cross-border trade and also document it, in order to both stimulate regional growth and food security, but also to allow the effective vaccination of livestock. Initiatives include Regional Resilience Enhancement Against Drought (RREAD), the Enhanced Livelihoods in Mandera Triangle/Enhanced Livelihoods in Southern Ethiopia (ELMT/ELSE) as part of the Regional Enhanced Livelihoods in Pastoral Areas (RELPA) programme in East Africa, and the Regional Livelihoods Advocacy Project (REGLAP) funded by the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO).

Suggestion boxes may also exist internally, within an organization, such as means for garnering employee opinion.  History  \\"Drop Your Ideas in the Suggestion Box\\" (US propaganda poster during World War II) Daniel W. Voorhees, a U.S Senator from Indiana first introduced the suggestion box in 1890. Voorhees referred to this box as \\"The Petition Box \\". Just like the suggestion box this provided a space for American's to offer their feedback. The photo on the left depicts the suggestion box used during World War II in the 1940's. The federal government encouraged factory workers to leave suggestions on how to increase efficiency and productivity. Throughout the years variations of this method included paper feedback forms which can be sent via postal mail, such as the \\"We value your input\\" or \\"How was the service today?\\" cards found in some restaurants; solicitations to provide comments over the telephone, such as a voluntary survey at the end of a transaction with a call center, or even an invitation on a printed store receipt to call and complete a customer satisfaction survey (sometimes offered with a product discount); or the placement of feedback forms on an institution's website. Including mechanisms for customer comments beyond an ordinary point of service has several benefits. Suggestion boxes provide some degree of detachment (or sometimes, especially with computer- mediated communication, complete anonymity) from the person or service that a customer may be critiquing, and may therefore yield more frank and open feedback, thereby providing greater opportunities for obtaining accurate market research data and improving customer relations. The internal routing of comments within an organization may also provide those without direct contact with customers a realistic appraisal of the quality of customer care being given. The external routing of responses to received suggestions, such as by posting responses to questions and requests on a physical or virtual bulletin board, may also help educate consumers and improve a company's image and customer loyalty.  Modern versions  Internet suggestion box for employees in a factory. The physical box, as a post box, was replaced by an electronic form of communication; like postal service systems was replaced, in the 2000s, by email. The traditional function, \\"obtaining additional comments, questions, and requests\\", still exist as a demand: collecting information with input from customers and patrons of a particular organization, or means for garnering employee input. In some contexts the modern suggestion box is a webpage with an anonymous form, for example an online reviews, anonymous digital feedback, employee suggestion programs, and employee review sites such as Indeed. In other contexts, it turned into a complete issue tracking system, which allows the following main features (that was impossible with the old classic suggestion boxes): * Store the entire history suggestions in a database: each suggestion receives a \\"ticket number\\", and a detailed suggestion-form is stored; * Allow the user and the company monitor the status on your routing: each ticked receives a status, that changes with its progress in the audition feedback or the problem-resolution. = Employee crowdsourcing = Gathering employee opinions with a suggestion box can also be fruitful, especially in groupthink-prone environments and within a corporate culture that adheres to a \\"shoot the messenger\\" mentality. However, as with the use of anonymous suggestion forms from the public, allowing unsigned comments may sacrifice accountability and make the feedback system prone to abuse. Employers can also gather employee opinion by posing questions and gathering everyone's opinion anonymously through crowdsourcing. Using the employee's knowledge, crowdsourcing techniques have been known to promote \\"New Innovations\\" Recording received suggestions in a database can help track any trends. While some systems keep suggestions private, some systems make suggestions public, allowing other people to endorse the suggestion rather than creating a similar one.

During the summer, the Sahara region of Algeria is the source of a scorching, sometimes dusty and southerly wind called the Sirocco. These winds parch the plateaus of northern Algeria up to 40 days and reach the Tell coastal region for as many as 20 days.The World Book Encyclopedia. Chicago: Scott Fetzer Co., 2007. In Salah has recorded at least in every month of the year including January and December as the absolute records high temperatures are respectively and for these two months. The absolute records low temperatures are below the freezing point, with recorded in January and recorded in both February and December, although freezing temperatures are very rare and don't occur each year. Average annual relative humidity is low with only 24%. The sky is clear all year and cloudy days are very rare. Thereby, the solar irradiation is among the highest found on the planet and the annual sunshine duration is estimated between 3,700 h and 4,000 h. In Salah is often quoted as one of the hottest spots worldwide. With Adrar and Reggane, In Salah forms the \\"Triangle of Fire\\" as local inhabitants say due to the extreme desert heat that bakes the region from May to September. Transport Air flights via In Salah Airport connect the town with the capital Algiers and other major cities in Algeria. The Bus station of In Salah hosts buses going to the north and south. There is a hotel, a restaurant, an internet cafe and two camping sites located in the city and surrounding area. The town lies at the junction of the Trans-Sahara Highway (also known as the N1 national highway), which leads north to Gharda√Øa and Algiers and south to Tamanrasset, and the N52, which leads west to In Ghar and Reggane. Economy Satellite image of In Salah. The oasis is at the center of the image while the city is at top-right. The dark areas are agricultural areas. Aside from oil and gas reserves, the primary economic activities of In Salah are agricultural in nature with irrigation being supplied by artesian wells. The oasis has over 200,000 date palms. The chief produce are dates, fruits and vegetables. Fruit and vegetable gardens and Palm groves flank the village on its southern and western edges. These groves are protected from the always advancing sand by hedges. In Salah is also a centre for nomadic Tuareg.http://lexicorient.com/e.o/in_salah.htm Lixi The In Salah oil and gas fields are home to the In Salah Project, a major component of which includes a facility to remove CO2 from the gas produced. The CO2 is then re-injected into an underground formation. Historically, In Salah was formerly a trading town which dealt in slaves, ivory and gold from the south. These goods were exchanged with European goods from the north. In February 2016, BP announced further project start up at In Salah Southern Fields. In Salah Gas, a joint venture between Sonatrach, BP and Statoil today announced the start-up of its Southern Fields project. In Salah Gas was the first project in the world to be environmentally certified to the ISO 14001 standard. The ISO 14001 management system development and implementation was conducted by Sonni Gopal.

It was developed by the W. L. Maxson Corporation to replace the earlier M33 twin mount (also from Maxson). Although designed as an anti-aircraft weapon, it was also used against ground targets. Introduced in 1943 during World War II, it remained in US service as late as the Vietnam War. History CCKW-353-B2 gun truck with M45 on M20 trailer in bed, loading ramps attached to side. This configuration did not see combat in World War II as it was still in testing by the cessation of hostilities. In order to develop a mobile anti-aircraft weapon, several 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) twin machine gun mounts were tested on the chassis of the M2 half-track including Bendix, Martin Aircraft Company, and Maxson. The Maxson M33 turret mount was preferred and‚Äîon the larger M3 half-track (T1E2)‚Äîwas accepted for service in 1942 as the M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage. The mount was also used on the similar M5 half track as the M14 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage.Zaloga, M3 Infantry Half Track, Osprey Publishing (2004) p. 38.Green (2000), p. 150.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969) British and American Tanks of World War II Arco Publishing. p191 Experimentally, the Quadmount was also tested in 1942 on a M3 Light Tank in place of the tank's turret but the project was not proceeded with.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969) p89-90 Even as production of the two MGMC vehicles was underway, there was work to increase the firepower. Re- working the M33 to take four machine guns resulted in the M45 mounting. The M45 Quadmount was the principal weapon (along with the 37mm gun) of highly mobile anti-aircraft artillery battalions deployed in the European Theater during World War II. These battalions provided invaluable air defense to much larger units, particularly field artillery. The M45 Quadmount units served as a very strong deterrent to strafing runs by enemy warplanes as, in addition to their gross firepower, its quartet of Browning M2HB \\"heavy barrel\\" .50 caliber guns were capable of being \\"tuned\\" to converge upon a single point at distances which could be reset while in use. Multiple-gun mounts were developed for the M2 Browning because the M2's rate of fire (450‚Äì550 rounds per minute) for a single gun was too low for anti-aircraft use. The M45 found use throughout the war as a land-based weapon, particularly during the Battle of the Bulge. Although the Allies achieved air supremacy by the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, German attack runs were still a threat. German Jabo fighter-bombers could approach and attack at low altitude and then quickly retreat to avoid Allied fighters. The Luftwaffe also mustered a large number of planes for Operation Bodenplatte that took place on New Year's Day 1945. On March 7, 1945 when the U.S. Army discovered the Ludendorff Bridge intact across the Rhine, M45-armed U.S. half-tracks defended the American troops crossing the bridge on March 9, 1945 to great effect. At Oppenheim, when the Allies were gathering to make a massive push after crossing the River Rhine (March 1945), 248 German warplanes were used in an effort to destroy the bridge first. U.S. Army anti-aircraft artillery battalions massed, shot down 30% of the attacking force mainly with M45 Quadmounts and prevented the bridge from being touched before the U.S. Third Army went into Germany. It was also tested by the US Navy as a solution for the Kamikaze attacks that started in late 1944. Two Essex class aircraft carriers received six mounts each for operational testing starting with CV-16 Lexington in May 1945. Her gunnery department in general was positive towards the powered mounts but felt that the guns were too light and ineffective against the high speeds that the diving Kamikaze aircraft possessed. The M45 Quadmount was ineffective against the new, fast-flying planes of the Jet Age. However, it was used against infantry targets in US post-war service. In Vietnam they were pressed into service to defend bases and to ride escort convoys along Viet Cong roads. The French Army also used M45s in combat. M45 Quad Mounts were placed in trucks to deal with ambushes and four M45s were used during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. =TCM-20= Israeli TCM-20, Israeli Air Force Museum The TCM-20 was a postwar Israeli development of the M45 mount, equipped with two 20mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannons in lieu of machine guns. In frontline Israeli service, it was replaced by the M163 Vulcan Air Defense System in the 1970s, but some reserve units still used TCM-20s into the 1980s. The weapon was also exported to several third-world countries. Mountings M20 trailer mount, 1947 M17 trailer mount, 1947 During World War II, the M45 turret was mounted on two specific systems; the M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage and the M51 Multiple Machine Gun Carriage. When mounted on the M20 trailer, it was known as the M55 Machine Gun Trailer Mount, but this system had not finished testing before the cessation of hostilities. M51s were withdrawn from service by the end of World War II in favor of the M55. During the Korean War, the M55 and M16 saw extensive combat, and lessons learned in Korea led to the conversion of an additional 1200 M3 halftracks into the M16A1 variant by adding an M45 turret. These can be identified by the lack of fold-down armor and rear troop door on the crew compartment and were often fitted with the roller front bumper instead of the winch bumper fitted to all M16s. In 1954 an additional modification was made to roughly 700 M16 MGMCs, adding the rear troop door and bolting the fold-down armor in the up position. This modification became known as the M16A2 MGMC. The M55 received a new, more powerful generator in the 1960s and served through the Vietnam War, usually mounted in the back of an M35 2.5 ton or M54 5-ton truck. M16 MGMC Route 9, Vietnam 1968 Operation The M45 is operated by two loaders and one gunner. The mount is capable of traversing a full 360 degrees around, with an angle elevation between -10 and +90 degrees. Traverse and elevation are electrically driven, powered by two rechargeable 6-volt batteries. All four guns could be fired at once, but standard practice was to alternate between firing the upper and lower pair of guns, allowing one pair to cool while the other was in use. This allowed for longer periods of action as overheating of the gun barrels was lessened. The \\"tombstone\\" model M2 ammunition chests held 200 rounds each‚Äîwith one ammunition chest on an M45 system holding ten times as many rounds as each of the four twenty-round 20mm magazines of the German Flakvierling system held (and which, on the German ordnance system, had to be changed every six seconds on each gun of the quartet to ensure its own top 800 rpm \\"combined\\" firing rate), with each M2 ammo chest weighing 89 pounds each when full.

While there is considerable room for debate as to which hills are included and excluded from the seven, seven possibilities are listed in this old rhyme: :Abbey, Calton, Castle grand, :Southward see St Leonards stand, :St Johns and Sciennes as two are given, :And Multrees makes Seven. The Pentland Hills are also just to the south of the city, and their lower slopes are within the city boundary, especially around Hillend, Swanston and Balerno. Some of the hills are formed from ancient volcanic processes, and all show the effect of glaciation. The tale of the seven hills of Edinburgh is popular enough that several local business take their name from it, including a dentist, a tour company, and a ceilidh band. Traditional Seven Castle Rock, perhaps Edinburgh's best known hill There is some argument as to which the seven are. Arthur's Seat and the Braid Hills, for example, are ranges of hill, containing several summits, rather than just one. In total, there are ten summits with a prominence of at least . * Arthur's Seat (height 251m, prominence 174m) at The highest of the seven, an ancient volcano incorporating Salisbury Crags (174m, 65m), Dunsapie Hill (145m, 34m) and several other smaller hills. * Castle Rock ‚Äî a volcanic plug (128m, 60m) at * Calton Hill (103m, 46m) at * Corstorphine Hill ‚Äî a ridge (162m, 117m) at * Braid Hills (213m, 51m) at * Blackford Hill (164m, 63m) at * Craiglockhart Hill at A running race, held yearly since 1980, takes in these seven hills, starting and finishing at Calton Hill (although it actually excludes Wester Craiglockhart because it is private property, and instead includes the lower Easter Craiglockhart). Debate over 'The Seven' The Royal Observatory atop Blackford Hill Before the construction of the New Town, Edinburgh was built on a single hill, the volcanic Castle Rock and its tail that extended to the east. The building of the New Town and subsequent development in the 19th and 20th centuries saw first Calton Hill and later all of the others listed above being absorbed into the city, and the \\"traditional seven\\" have some claim to being described as the seven principal hills within the modern boundaries of Edinburgh. There are many other hills in Edinburgh, some part of the above ranges, or simply hidden beneath housing etc. There are for example, ridges extending from Dalry and Ardmillan, and also Sighthill. Craigmillar Castle is also on top of a small hill, and there is another small one underneath Colinton. There are also hills beneath the New Town, and the Old Town to the south of the Cowgate. Some of these hills rise to heights substantially above the traditional seven ‚Äî for example parts of Fairmilehead at . The Pentland Hills to the south of Edinburgh are traditionally thought of as being outside the city, although they are very close, and because of their height they dominate views to the south of the city. Allermuir Hill at 493m is only slightly further from the centre of Edinburgh than Corstorphine Hill, and is almost twice the height of Arthur's Seat. A number of Edinburgh suburbs, also contain \\"hill\\" or synonyms in their name ‚Äî Abbeyhill, Alnwickhill, Church Hill, Curriehill, Drylaw (Lowland Scots for a \\"hill without a spring\\"), Ferniehill, Firrhill, Greenhill, Piershill, Sighthill; and others also contain the element \\"Craig\\" meaning a large rock, such as Craigentinny and Craigmillar. Hills in the centre of the city The Governor's House on Calton Hill Edinburgh is also traditionally thought of as being a hilly city, because of the number of hills in or close to the city centre. Chief among these is the Royal Mile which rises continuously from Holyrood House to Edinburgh Castle for approximately a mile. Others include - * Dundas Street and Hanover Street, which rise steeply from the Water of Leith to a summit at George Street, then descend slightly to Princes Street, before climbing the very steep Mound to join the Royal Mile * Several streets in the New Town which run parallel to Dundas Street and Hanover Street for part of their length, including Frederick Street and Castle Street * Leith Walk, which rises continuously from just above sea level at Leith, to a summit at Princes Street. * A number of short and very steep streets in the Old Town, including Victoria Street, Candlemaker Row, and Infirmary Street. The many height changes have led to several roads crossing other roads on bridges, which was relatively rare in pre-20th century Britain. These include Waterloo Place above Calton Road, George IV Bridge over the Cowgate and Merchant Street, South Bridge over the Cowgate, and King's Bridge carrying Johnston Terrace over Kings Stables Road. There are also several staircases accessible to pedestrians only, linking streets at different heights, including Playfair Steps between Market Street and Princes Street, Jacob's Ladder between Calton Road and Regent Road, and the News Steps, between St Giles Street and Market Street. Outlying hills include the climb from Tollcross to Bruntsfield and beyond Morningside to Fairmilehead, and Liberton Brae.

Currently known as the Booker Border League, after its sponsors, teams from all over the Scottish Borders as well as Berwick RFC from Northumberland compete every year from the competition. The Borders has always been a stronghold of rugby union, coupled with the competitive rivalry that exists between the local Border towns, derbies are something to behold, with the teams fighting for pride as well as league points. Although originally the premier tournament for its clubs, the formation of a league system in the 1970s means that Border clubs now play in the Scottish League Championship and the Scottish Cup and, although still prestigious, the Border League is now regarded by many of its members as more of a supplementary competition. The current holders are Gala RFC who beat Selkirk RFC in 2016. History By tradition, the two main strongholds of Scottish rugby have been the cluster of towns that flank the River Tweed in the Borders, and the private schools of Glasgow and Edinburgh. Although this situation has changed somewhat, the Borders still exert a disproportionate influence upon the Scottish game, and have made a major contribution to world rugby in the form of rugby sevens. Between them the two camps have directly or indirectly provided the vast majority of Scotland's international players, but their different traditions have produced an enmity based as much on class as geography. That tension was evident even in the late Victorian period, when rugby's popularity was growing in both areas. In the Borders where clubs such as Hawick, Gala and Jed Forest were largely working class institutions, there was a resentment of the haughty control exerted by representatives of city schools on the Scottish Football Union (as the SRU was known then). On more than one occasion, the mutual distrust almost led to the creation of a breakaway group that would have mirrored developments in England, where the rebel Northern League produced the game of rugby league. The Border sides, however, remained in the Scottish rugby union fold. Yet their desire for more meaningful rugby at a time when the SRU viewed that concept with disdain, was to produce in the 1901‚Äì2 season, the Border League, the championship which is now the game's oldest and most established competitive club league. The League's original members were Gala, Hawick, Langholm, Melrose and Jed Forest. In 1912, Selkirk and Kelso joined to bring the competition up to seven teams, a number which did not change until 1996, when Peebles after years of lobbying, was admitted into the competition. Throughout its history, the League has been contested on a home and away basis. surviving even the introduction of National Leagues in 1973. Then with a fine sense of irony, the Border clubs opposed the arrival of the national championship, fearful of the effect it would have on their own competition. By the end of the 1996‚Äì7 season, Hawick's 43 Border titles ‚Äì outright or shared ‚Äì made them easily the most successful side. Melrose had won 14, Jed Forest six, Kelso five, Selkirk three and Langholm one. Recent innovations have included play-offs, when the League produces a tie, and a points for tries system.

Membership Issues Following their failure to fulfil any fixtures during 2005‚Äì2006, many anticipated Duns RFC withdrawing or being replaced ‚Äì either by local rivals Earlston RFC, who are the largest Scottish Borders club not to participate in the Border League, or possibly by Eyemouth RFC (who have since disbanded as a league club), St Boswells RFC or Walkerburn RFC who while being far down the national league structure, come from towns currently unrepresented. Calls for Biggar RFC (geographically just outside the Scottish Borders but a major Scottish club) were also made. However, Duns RFC retained their place, and confirmed their status by playing their first fixture of the season before the National League season had even began. They were resoundingly beaten 62 ‚Äì 7 by Peebles RFC on Saturday 19 August 2006.# Duns, failed to make the grade for the following season and were replaced by Haddington RFC from East Lothian who were felt to be a suitable team as they play in Division 2 of the national league set-up.

Born in the British West Indies, he immigrated to the United States at the age of 15, and earned degrees at Howard University, Columbia University Law School, and New York University. He settled in Nashville, Tennessee, where he built a law practice and taught at Fisk University. He is noted for being part of the defense team for 25 black men charged in attempted murder for the Columbia race riot of 1946 and winning acquittals for most, in the aftermath of the first major racial confrontation in the United States after World War II. He participated in numerous other cases, including leading desegregation of schools in Nashville. He served as a Republican member of the Nashville City Council from 1951 to 1971. His house was bombed by segregationists on April 19, 1960. Early life Looby was born on April 8, 1899 in Antigua. His father was John Alexander Looby and his mother, Grace Elizabeth Joseph. When he was five, his mother died while giving birth to a sibling. His father died when Looby was a teenager. The youth moved to the United States in 1914 as an orphan when he was fifteen years old. Looby attended Howard University as an undergraduate, and became a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1922. He went on to earn a law degree in 1925 from Columbia University in New York City, and a doctorate in jurisprudence from New York University in 1926. Career Looby moved to Nashville, Tennessee where he started as an assistant professor at Fisk University, a historically black college. In July 1928, he passed the Tennessee bar exam and opened his own practice. In 1932, he helped found the Kent College of Law in Nashville. Looby was part of the defense team organized by the NAACP for black men charged in the Columbia race riot of 1946. Looby worked with white attorney Maurice Weaver from Chattanooga and Thurgood Marshall of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund of the NAACP; the latter led the defense team. They won acquittals for 24 of the 25 men charged, and the last had his charges reduced.Gilbert King, Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America, HarperCollins, 2012, pp. 8 and 14 As a young state senator in Nashville's fifth ward, Ben West pushed for a charter reform in 1950 to allow local residents to elect city council members from single-member districts rather than through at-large voting. The latter system favored the white majority in the city and made it difficult for the sizeable African-American minority ever to elect candidates of their choice. With the change, African Americans began to elect some candidates. At that time, many black voters were still disenfranchised since the state had passed laws in the late 1880s to charge poll taxes and make voter registration and voting difficult.Connie L. Lester, \\"Disfranchising laws\\", Tennessee Encyclopedia of Culture and History, 2011 After the change to the charter, in May 1951 Looby was elected to the Nashville City Council, along with another lawyer, Robert Lillard. They were the first African Americans to be elected to the council since 1911. In 1953, the state passed a constitutional amendment to repeal the poll tax. This led to increased numbers of African Americans registering to vote statewide. After the United States Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, Looby filed a suit in Nashville on behalf of A.Z. Kelley. His son had been denied admission to a traditionally white school. Looby is credited with beginning the school desegregation movement in Nashville. Beginning in February 1960, councilman Looby defended the students arrested in the Nashville sit-ins to achieve integration of public places. His law associates Avon Nyanza Williams and Robert E. Lillard also were part of the defense team. As a result of Looby's support of the students, his house was dynamited by segregationists on April 19, 1960. The house was nearly destroyed by the powerful bomb, which also blew out 140 windows at nearby Meharry Medical College, resulting in minor injuries to students. Neither Looby nor his wife, Grafta Mosby Looby, was harmed in the bombing. Afterward students from Fisk University led 2500 protesters on a silent walk to city hall, where they confronted Mayor Ben West. Diane Nash asked him, \\"Do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color?\\" West said \\"yes,' later explaining, \\"It was a moral question ‚Äì one that a man had to answer, not a politician.\\"\\"Timeline: The Civil Rights Movement in America\\", \\"This Honorable Body:\\" African American Legislators in 19th Century Tennessee, 2013, Tennessee Department of State By May of that year, lunch counters in Nashville were desegregated. By October Looby and his team gained dismissal of the charges against 91 students \\"for conspiracy to disrupt trade and commerce.\\" Death and legacy Looby died on March 24, 1972. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Nashville. In 1976, the city government of Nashville named a new library and community center in Looby's honor. In 1978, the James C. Napier Lawyers Association changed its name to the Napier-Looby Bar Association, in honor of Looby and his accomplishments. In 1982, the Nashville Bar Association posthumously awarded Looby membership; it had rejected him on racial grounds when he applied in the 1950s.

Positive transfer is the goal of most training programs. # Negative Transfer: Training decreases performance in the targeted job or role. # Zero Transfer: Training neither increases nor decreases performance in the targeted job or role.  Model of Transfer  Baldwin and Ford (1988) is the most commonly cited model of transfer, which defines the transfer of training as the generalization and maintenance of material learned in training to the work environment. Within this model, the authors conceptualize transfer of training as a three-stage process. In the first stage, the inputs to training, including the training strategies, the work environment, and trainee characteristics are defined. Next, through the training process, these inputs generate training outputs in the form of learning and retention. Ultimately, transfer of training occurs in the final stage when learning and retention are generalized and maintained in the work environment. Using the training inputs defined in this model, psychological research has identified many factors that contribute to the positive transfer of training.  Influences on Positive Transfer  Within the current literature, there is a lack of consensus over what factors contribute to the positive transfer of training. However, across psychological research, the following factors have consistently impacted positive transfer. = _Trainee Characteristics_ = #Cognitive Ability: Higher cognitive ability typically leads to higher levels of retention and generalization of learned material. #Self-efficacy: Higher self-efficacy contributes to positive transfer through its influence on confidence and persistence. #Motivation: Individuals with a higher motivation to learn tend to experience higher levels of positive transfer of training. #Personality: Higher measures of conscientiousness increase the likelihood of positive transfer. #Perceptions of Utility: Beliefs in the value and usefulness of training increase the likelihood of positive transfer. = _Work Environment_ = # Transfer climate: By definition, a positive transfer climate is a work environment that contains cues and feedback mechanisms that remind employees of learned material. Positive transfer climates tend to facilitate higher levels of positive transfer. # Support: Support from supervisors and peers leads to higher levels of positive transfer. # Opportunity to Perform: Work environments that provide opportunities to use learned material promote higher positive transfer of training. # Check-Ins: Regular reviews of training material solidify knowledge and contribute to positive transfer. = _Training Strategies_ = # Similarity: Also referred to as identical elements theory, a high degree of similarity between the training environment and work environment increases the positive transfer of training. #Active Learning: Hands-on practice of material contributes to positive transfer, especially when it incorporates a variety of different contexts. # Behavioral Modeling: A training technique inspired by Albert Bandura's theory of social learning, which involves explanations, demonstrations, and active learning, feedback, and reinforcement . Behavioral modeling is associated with increased positive transfer, especially when both incorrect and correct behavioral examples are provided during training. # Error-based examples: Training that focuses on how to deal with problems and learn from errors facilitates higher positive transfer. #Collaboration: Collaboration between trainees, trainers, and supervisors during training increases positive transfer. # Multiple Strategies: The use of variety of teaching and learning strategies facilitates positive transfer. # Goals: Setting goals and expectations for training increases positive transfer. #Assessments: Intermittent assessments of participant's knowledge of learned material increases positive transfer.  Assessment  Positive transfer is the goal of many organizational training programs. Therefore, transfer of training plays a vital role in evaluating a training program's effectiveness. Common training evaluation methods, such as Kirkpatrick's Taxonomy and the Augmented Framework of Alliger et al., utilize transfer as an essential criterion to evaluate training. Due to its behavioral outcomes, transfer of training allows organizations to quantify the impact of training and measure differences in performance.

History In 1976, while Roxy Music had temporarily disbanded, 801 (also referred to as The 801) got together as a temporary project and began rehearsing at Island Studios, Hammersmith, about three weeks before their first gig. The name of the band was taken from the Eno song \\"The True Wheel\\", which appears on his 1974 solo album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy). The refrain of the song‚Äî\\"We are the 801, we are the central shaft\\"‚Äîreportedly came to him in a dream (although it has also been noted that \\"Eight Nought One\\" acrostically spells his name). 801 performed three critically highly acclaimed concerts: in Norfolk, at the Reading Festival and the final concert on 3 September at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall. This last concert was recorded live and released as the album 801 Live. The music consisted of more or less mutated selections from albums by Manzanera, Eno, and Quiet Sun, plus a full-scale rearrangement of Lennon-McCartney's \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and an off-the-wall excursion into The Kinks' 1964 hit \\"You Really Got Me\\". Released at the height of the punk rock revolution in the UK, the LP was not a major commercial success, but it sold well throughout the world, particularly because it gained rave reviews from critics both for the superb performances by the musicians and for its groundbreaking sound quality. Although live albums were by then becoming increasingly sophisticated in their production, thanks to the advent of portable multi-track recorders and mobile studios, most were hampered by relatively poor sound quality. Up until this time, the standard procedure for both front-of-house mixing and live recording was to capture the sound of amplified instruments such as guitars by placing microphones in front of the amplifiers. Although many superb performances were captured, the results were still markedly inferior to studio recordings, and live recordings often suffered from a range of problems such as distortion, noise, sound \\"leakage\\" between instruments, poor separation and intrusive audience sounds. 801 Live set new standards for live recordings because it was one of the first live LPs in which all outputs from the vocal microphones, guitar amps and other instruments (except the drums) were fed directly to the mobile studio mixing desk, rather than being recorded via microphones and/or signals fed out the front-of-house PA mixer. This so-called \\"Direct Injection\\" (DI) method had been used for years in the studio, but this was one of the first instances of the method being successfully used to record a live album. 801 Live became a significant cult success in many countries, notably in Australia, where it was heavily promoted by the ABC's new 24-hour rock station Double Jay (2JJ), which had opened in January 1975. Although based in Sydney, the station could be heard widely around New South Wales and was relayed nationally after midnight via the ABC's national AM network. It is notable that 801 Live received virtually no commercial radio airplay, it had no music video to promote it, and it was originally not even locally released in Australia. Despite this, the album became the highest-selling import album of the year in Australia in 1976, and demand for it as an import item eventually forced the Australian distributors to release it locally. In 1977, hoping to capitalise on the success of 801 Live, a revised line-up of the band (now officially billed as \\"Phil Manzanera/801\\") recorded and released Listen Now. This was a studio album with additional collaborating musicians including Tim Finn of Split Enz, but without Lloyd Watson. In late 1977, 801 reformed as another live group around Manzanera and MacCormick for a promotion tour for the album Listen Now. Their concert at Manchester University was finally released as the album 801 Manchester in 1997.

Its name comes from various forms of Craig of Inverleith, or rock or hill of Inverleith. The area lies between Ravelston Dykes, to Crewe Toll and the Ferry Road, and Comely Bank on the east. Queensferry Road and Craigleith Road both pass through here. There are also a number of private schools in the area such as Stewart's Melville College and The Mary Erskine School. The Royal Victoria Hospital is off Craigleith Road while the Western General Hospital on Crewe Road was opened in 1868 as the Craigleith Hospital and Poorhouse. Quarrying Craigleith Quarry was active for more than 300 years from 1615 to 1942. The 350-million-year-old Carboniferous Craigleith sandstone was used extensively in construction because it was a hard-wearing composite. Architects used it extensively in buildings in both Edinburgh's Old and New Town. Many famous buildings including Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood Palace were built form Craigleith sandstone. The statue on Nelson's Column in London was also built from the stone. Because of its hardness, Craigleith Sandstone was also favoured for cutting stones used to make cut glass during the Victorian era. At its peak, the quarry was the largest and most productive in Edinburgh. In 1995, the Craigleith Retail Park was built upon the infilled Craigleith Quarry; it is situated at the junction of Queensferry Road and Craigleith Road.

The mosque is located at the junction of Victoria Street and Jalan Sultan in the Kampong Glam district, in the Rochor Planning Area within the Central Area. The mosque is built on the Sultan Mosque style with traditional blue and white lapis lazuli tile facade. The mosque was nicknamed as little cousin of the Sultan Mosque, because of similar golden domes. History Before the building of the mosque, there was a burial ground near the site which was used until World War II. The Indian Muslims built a mosque known as the Tittacheri Muslim Cemetery and Mosque but it fell into disrepair and was abandoned until around 1929. The Mosque was then taken over by the Malabar Muslim Jama'ath. The Malabar Muslims; originally from the southern state of Kerala in India, formed Malabar Muslim Jama'ath in 1927, an association to look after the matters of their community, made up of mostly textile and jewellery merchants. The Jama'ath's first office was located in a shophouse on Changi Road, shifted to Bussorah Street later and finally settled on Victoria Street. A fundraising campaign launched to finance the re-construction of the mosque attracted the generous amounts of donations from the Muslim as well as nonmuslim public. Malabar Mosque was declared open by Yang di-Pertuan Negara Yusof bin Ishak on 24 January 1963. The Mosque has a capacity of 1,000 people. Shortly after the inauguration, urban redevelopment began in the Jalan Sultan area, to help the mosque withstand its increasingly dense, modern setting, green and blue tiles replaced the paintwork that covered the outside walls. Except for a few areas left unpainted, the whole building has been redecorated in garish green and blue. Jama'ath then decided to do the same with the interior. In 1995, the entire mosque, save a few sections, were tiled. In 2009, the mosque underwent renovations to maintain its unique architecture. Today, Malabar Mosque continues to be the focal point of the Malabar Muslim community who gather there every Friday and on Hari Raya, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha and other religious occasions for prayers and celebrations. Architecture Malabar Mosque has been built upon the conventional Islamic architectural style. A.H Sidique, an immigrant from India who also designed Sri Guru Nanak Sat Sangh Sabha gurdwara on Wilkinson Road, designed the Malabar Mosque. A. H Sidique, after completing a correspondence course in building, became responsible for both the construction and design of many buildings in Singapore. Apparently, he would never take a design fee for a religious building of any denomination. The mosque is built upon a traditional architectural style; adorned with a big, central golden onion dome with a crescent and a star on the center top; and a big minaret shaped like an octagonal tower capped with a smaller dome with a crescent and a star on the right of the big dome. On the left of the big dome there is another smaller dome with a crescent and a star. Series of external staircases connect the various levels of the mosque. The ground floor courts the Koran study area, the imam's room, and a visitors' lounge. A separate double-story annex houses offices and the ablution area. The main prayer hall is situated on the first floor. It faces the direction of Mecca and is surrounded by spacious verandas on its three sides. The staircase leading to the first level is also oriented towards Mecca. Mosque is a unique religious architecture in Singapore. Outside, there is an area for functions and this includes a table for laying out and washing the dead. To the rear, there is a now small, partly disused cemetery known as Tittacheri Muslim Cemetery which comprises a small part of the main Jalan Kubor Cemetery.

Many of them are only known through their coins. Many of the dates, territories, and relationships between Indo-Greek kings are tentative and essentially based on numismatic analysis (find places, overstrikes, monograms, metallurgy, styles), a few Classical writings, and Indian writings and epigraphic evidence. The following list of kings, dates and territories after the reign of Demetrius is derived from the latest and most extensive analysis on the subject, by Osmund Bopearachchi (\\"Monnaies Gr√©co-Bactriennes et Indo-Grecques, Catalogue Raisonn√©\\", 1991).

Coins The territory ruled by Demetrius, from Bactria to Pataliputra, was then separated between western and eastern parts, and ruled by several sub-kings and successor kings. The Western part made of Bactria was ruled by a succession of Greco-Bactrian kings until the end of the reign of Heliocles around 130 BCE. The Eastern part, made of the Paropamisadae, Arachosia, Gandhara and Punjab, perhaps as far as Mathura, was ruled by a succession of kings, called \\"Indo- Greek\\": =Territories of Paropamisadae to Mathura (house of Euthydemus)= * Agathocles (190-180 BC) Coins * Pantaleon (190-185 BC) * Apollodotus I (reigned c. 180-160 BC) * Antimachus II Nikephoros (160-155 BC) Coins * Demetrius II (155-150 BC) The usurper Eucratides managed to eradicate the Euthydemid dynasty and occupy territory as far as he Indus, between 170 and 145 BCE.

Western territories The following kings ruled the western parts of the Indo-Greek/Graeco-Bactrian realms, which are here referred to as the \\"Western kingdom\\". Probably after the death of Menander I, the Paropamisadae and Arachosia broke loose, and the Western kings eventually seem to have extended into Gandhara by the following kings. Several of its rulers are believed to have belonged to the house of Eucratides. =Territories of the Paropamisadae, Arachosia and Gandhara (130 - 95 BC)= Heliocles (145-130 BC) * Zoilos I (130 - 120 BC¬¥), revolted against the dynasty of Menander.Coins * Lysias (120 - 110 BC), probably conquered Gandhara for the Western kingdom. Coins * Antialcidas (r.c. 115-95 BC) Coins * Philoxenus (reigned c. 100- 95 BCE) Coins. Philoxenus ruled in western Punjab as well. After the death of Philoxenus, the Western kingdom fragmented and never became dominating again. The following kings ruled mostly in the Paropamisadae. =Territory of the Paropamisadae (95-70 BC)= * Diomedes (95 - 90 BC)Coin * Theophilos (c. 90 BC) Coin * Nicias (reigned c. 90-85 BC * Hermaeus (reigned c. 90-70 BC). *(Yuezhi rulers) The Yuezhi probably then took control of the Paropamisadae after Hermaeus. The first documented Yuezhi prince, Sapadbizes, ruled around 20 BCE, and minted in Greek and in the same style as the western Indo-Greek kings, probably depending on Greek mints and celators. The Yuezhi expanded to the east during the 1st century CE, to found the Kushan Empire. The first Kushan emperor Kujula Kadphises ostensibly associated himself with Hermaeus on his coins, suggesting that he may have been one of his descendants by alliance, or at least wanted to claim his legacy. Indo-Greek princelets (Gandhara) After the Indo-Scythian Kings became the rulers of northern India, remaining Greek communities were probably governed by lesser Greek rulers, without the right of coinage, into the 1st century CE, in the areas of the Paropamisadae and Gandhara: * Theodamas (c. 1st century CE) Indo-Greek ruler of the Bajaur area, northern Gandhara. The Indo-Greeks may have kept a significant military role towards the 2nd century CE as suggested by the inscriptions of the Satavahana kings.

Owned by iHeartMedia, it broadcasts an all-news radio format under iHeartMedia's Black Information Network, targeting Detroit's African American community. Its studios are located in the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills, while its transmitter is in nearby Trenton. History =Early history= AM 1130 has been on the air since December 17, 1939, and bore the WCAR calls from its inception until 1979. WCAR was originally licensed to the Detroit suburb of Pontiac, Michigan. It initially broadcast on 1100 kHz with 1,000 watts (daytime only). The owners were \\"a group of Pontiac citizens,\\" including H.Y. Levinson, who owned half of the stock and managed the station. Levinson also was publisher of the Farmington Enterprise, a weekly newspaper in Farmington, Michigan. For many years the station aired a middle-of-the-road/adult standards music format, as Levinson insisted that WCAR air only \\"good music\\" and refused to allow anything even remotely resembling rock and roll on his station's playlist. =1970s: Giant 1130= Levinson would eventually relax his anti-rock stance when it became evident that the conservative \\"good music\\" approach wasn't making him enough money. By 1970, \\"W-Car\\" had transitioned to a personality MOR Contemporary format (what would likely be considered Hot Adult Contemporary today), playing more hit singles and fewer MOR album cuts while shying away from very hard rock, and featuring new jingles and a \\"hipper\\" image built around slogans such as \\"W-Car Cares About Detroit and Its People\\" (including inventive homemade public service announcements and promos for local businesses such as marriage counselors). By the summer of 1971, the station had added more harder rock and roll records to its adult contemporary format, and that fall the station made the full transition into Top 40 as \\"All Hit Music, The Giant 1130,\\" similar in presentation to market leader CKLW. This incarnation of W-Car was consulted by Ken Draper, who at the time was programming similar formats on WFDF in Flint (which was known as \\"Giant 91\\") and WJIM in Lansing. W-Car's Top 40 incarnation featured an airstaff including Detroit radio veterans such as Dave L. Prince, Scott Regen, and former CKLW and WIXY (Cleveland) personality Steve Hunter. Hunter recalled on the CKLW tribute Website (http://www.thebig8.net) that although WCAR sounded good, its locally based ownership didn't have the money needed to sustain cash giveaways and other prizes, and the format was changed just before a new ratings book came in showing promising growth in the station's ratings. W-Car would trudge through several more failed formats during the remainder of the 1970s, including progressive rock (being one of the few AM stations to feature this kind of music, now known as album oriented rock), all-news (using the NBC News and Information service), and another try at adult contemporary with new owners Golden West Broadcasters (who bought the AM and FM in the summer of 1977) switching the station from news and talk back to music in October 1977. From 1971 to 1974, George Noory, now host of the highly rated Coast to Coast AM syndicated late night radio show, worked at WCAR. =WCXI= In early 1979, WCAR changed its format to country and adopted the calls WCXI (\\"Country 11\\"; the \\"C\\" stood for Country, and \\"XI\\" is \\"11\\" in Roman numerals) in March. General Manager John Risher, who had run popular country station WDEE during the early to mid-1970s, brought back popular award-winning morning personality Deano Day, Bob Burchett and a few others who had worked at \\"The Big-D\\" to the air staff. Program Director Bill Ford was held over from the previous WCAR AM 1130 adult contemporary format as well as new music director Bob \\"R.T.\\" Griffin. After his success with WCXI, Ford left the station to program WKHK in New York. Dan Dixon (later of XM Radio), Larry Patton and Greg Raab were the following Program Directors, with Raab also being the station's Promotions Director from early 1979. With WDEE gone and its only competitor in the country format being Windsor, Ontario's CKLW-FM (which focused its programming on the Canadian side of the border), WCXI became very popular for a year or two. However, WCXI took a hit once WWWW changed its format from album-oriented rock to country in 1980, becoming (apart from CKLW-FM) Detroit's first live country station on FM since WDEE-FM a decade earlier (WCAR-FM was automated country in 1977 until it became WTWR in early 1978). To better compete with W4 Country, WCXI/WTWR-FM's owner, Gene Autry's Golden West Broadcasters, again changed Top 40/oldies-formatted WTWR to WCXI-FM, and was programmed separately from the AM - but simulcasting Deano Day for a short time when he returned again to the station after a brief run in Los Angeles in early 1982. WCXI-FM was unable to beat W4; new owner Fritz Broadcasting changed format in May 1986 to adult contemporary as WNTM (later becoming WVAE and then WMXD). In the meantime, WCXI was sold to Shamrock Broadcasting, owners of W4, on the same date as the FM station and continued to suffer from low ratings through the 1980s. By the latter part of the decade, the station had adopted the \\"Real Country\\" branding and began to focus more on classic country. Finally, in 1992, WCXI became WWWW, staying with country music but now simulcasting WWWW- FM. =The Fan= WDFN logo, 2009-2020 WWWW changed its calls to WDFN in May 1994, and on July 11 of that year, it became a sports-talk station branded as \\"The Fan\\". For much of its run in the format, WDFN competed with WXYT (1270 AM), and later WXYT-FM (97.1), for Detroit's sports-talk audience. WDFN affiliated with Fox Sports Radio since May 2003; before then, it was affiliated with ESPN Radio. The station was the Detroit outlet for national radio broadcasts of NFL games via Westwood One, including Sunday and Monday Night Football, NFL postseason games, and the Super Bowl from 1997 through 2004. When the Detroit Lions were not playing that Sunday, it would occasionally air the afternoon doubleheader. The WCAR call signs are now in use at AM 1090 in the Detroit suburb of Livonia, Michigan, which airs a sports format. AM 1160 in Fenton, Michigan now uses the WCXI calls, playing oldies and can be heard in much of the metro Detroit area. WDFN's afternoon program, Stoney and Wojo, conducted comedic tournaments called \\"Stoney and Wojo Invitationals\\" several times each year. Similar to the NCAA Tournament, 64 \\"teams\\" would be represented in brackets split into geographic regions. These tournaments have featured such random items as body parts, soft drinks, cartoon characters, and even people with the first name of Mike. To determine the result, listeners called in and picked a winner in each game. On December 18, 2005, prior to the Detroit Lions' final home game of the season (against the Cincinnati Bengals), WDFN organized a \\"Millen Man March\\" outside Ford Field, in support of the many fans outraged by the leadership of then-team president Matt Millen, under whom the Lions were 20-57, with many of the losses coming in heartbreaking fashion. The station also purchased a billboard ad by the stadium which read \\"Not This Millenium - Rebuilding Since 1957\\" (the last year the Lions won an NFL championship). On July 13, 2007, Stoney and Wojo were the substitute hosts on the popular nationally syndicated The Jim Rome Show (for the vacationing Jim Rome). On January 20, 2009, WDFN's local sports programming was replaced with syndicated programming consisting primarily of Fox Sports Radio. Sean Baligian signed off at noon, leading into coverage of the inauguration of President Barack Obama, with no mention of changes at the station. After several weeks with no local programming aside from Pistons broadcasts, Matt Shepard returned on April 6, relaunching his live morning show, Shep, Shower and Shave. Longtime sports director and University of Detroit Titans basketball announcer Matt Dery left the station for competitor WXYT. Rob Pascoe also joined WXYT after being released from WDFN, and on April 28, 2009, Rob Otto was also given his release. In addition, WDFN would drop the \\"Fan\\" branding and rebranded as simply \\"Detroit Sports Talk.\\" From the 2001-02 season through the end of the 2008-09 NBA season, WDFN was the Detroit Pistons' flagship radio station. The Pistons qualified for the NBA playoffs during each of the 8 seasons, winning the 2004 NBA Finals. On February 5, 2009, WXYT-FM acquired the rights to become the Pistons' flagship station starting in the 2009‚Äì10 season. The move came shortly after the aforementioned layoffs, switching to a line-up of nationally syndicated shows like The Dan Patrick Show and Fox Sports Radio's Myers and Hartman. The Pistons also cited WDFN's weak directional signal, listeners were having difficulty receiving the station without interference. On October 1, 2010, WDFN dropped the \\"Detroit Sports Talk\\" branding and returned to being \\"The Fan,\\" but in 2013, they altered their on-air program format significantly, deviating from their former sports format. On May 2, 2017, Matt Shepard, one of the few survivors of WDFN's 2009 layoffs, was released by the station after anchoring the morning drive for more than 8 years. Shepard had also anchored the hourly sports updates from 2001 through 2007, and again starting in April 2008 after a brief stint at WXYT. On November 16, 2017, it was announced that Shepard was coming back to the station, with his morning show relaunched on November 20. =Black Information Network= On June 29, 2020, WDFN ended its 26-year run as a sports talk station, and began stunting with speeches by prominent African Americans. The next day, WDFN flipped to all-news radio as Detroit's BIN 1130; it is one of the charter stations of iHeartMedia's Black Information Network ‚Äî a multi-platform radio network serving the African- American community. The new format will compete with Entercom's heritage all- news station WWJ.

The series is set on the fictional world of Kregen, a planet of the Antares star system in the constellation of Scorpio. Antares is envisioned as a double star system consisting of a large red giant (Antares A) and a smaller green star (Antares B). Antares B is in reality blue, though often described as green, probably owing to a contrast effect.James Kaler, \\"Antares\\". Accessed 5/19/07. Presumably some similar effect, or perhaps some quality of Kregen‚Äôs atmosphere, makes it appear green from the planet‚Äôs surface. Kregen has a multiple moon system. Bulmer's choice of the setting for the series is a subtle tribute to the Martian series of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the prototypical Sword and Planet romance. The star Antares, similar in brightness and hue to the planet Mars in the night sky, was given its name (ant(i)-Ares, meaning \\"opposite Mars\\" or \\"equal to Mars\\") by early astronomers to compare it to and help distinguish it from the planet. The premise is furthered in that while on Earth, Prescot meets an unnamed \\"gentleman from Virginia\\" who is implied to be John Carter, the protagonist of Burroughs' Martian series. Physically, Kregen is similar to Earth, being comfortably habitable by human beings. It has seven major continents and nine continental islands similar in size to Australia, in addition to innumerable smaller islands. The scene of all the action is Paz, a grouping of four major continents and four continental islands in one hemisphere. The remaining land masses, in the opposite hemisphere, are little known. Most of the land masses forming Paz are separated by narrow seas, indicating that in geologically recent times it was a supercontinent, since broken apart by tectonic forces. The continents of Paz are fairly compact in comparison to those of Earth, without connecting land bridges. They include Turismond to the northwest, Segesthes to the northeast, Loh in the center, and Havilfar to the southeast. Turismond and Havilfar both contain large inland seas similar to the Mediterranean. The continental islands of Paz include Vallia between Turismond and Segesthes, Pandahem between Loh, Segesthes and Havilfar, Unrdrin to the northeast of Turismond, and Mehzia to the east of Segesthes. Of the continents and continental islands of the opposite hemisphere, the only one named in the series is the continent of Gah, mentioned in Transit to Scorpio as a place of distasteful sexual customs (an obvious dig at another sword and planet series, the Gor series of John Norman). At some time in the past Kregen was apparently seeded with intelligent life-forms from many other worlds by either the Star Lords or the Savanti (for whom see below), or both, presumably by the same mysterious means by which Prescot is brought to the planet. In Paz the dominant species is usually the human race, known locally as Apim. Other intelligent species are known collectively as Diffs. Culturally, the more advanced nations are at a level on par with Earth‚Äôs European Renaissance, though firearms are unknown and a few nations manufacture aircraft. The opposite hemisphere is apparently dominated by Shanks, savage fish-headed sea-raiders who periodically ravage the peripheral coastlands of Paz. Notable polities of Paz include the decadent kingdom of Walfarg in northern Loh, remnant of a formerly vast empire, the island empire of Vallia, the smaller kingdoms of northern Pandahem and southern Segesthes‚Äô Balintol subcontinent, the imperialistic empire of Hamal in the northeast Havilfar and the petty states of the Dawn Lands to its south, the more isolated kingdom of Djanduin in southwestern Havilfar, and the perpetually warring Zairim and Grodnim to the north and south of the Eye of the World, the Mediterranean-like sea bisecting Turismond. More primitive areas marginalized from the civilized belt by geography or topography include the Great Plains of Segesthes, the Hostile Territories of Eastern Turismond, the Wild Lands of north central Havilfar, and the jungles of South Pandahem and central Loh. Storyline The series features the story of Earthman Dray Prescot, an English sailor of Nelson's navy, and his miraculous teleportation to the planet Kregen. There he is trained as an agent for the mysterious Savanti, an apparently benevolent secret society devoted to improving the lot of humanity among the many intelligent species of Kregen. The Savanti are the guardians of a miraculous pool which both heals wounds and extends life, similar to the Fountain of Youth in Earth legend. Prescot falls from grace for using this pool to heal Delia, an injured supplicant to the Savanti, and incidentally the princess of the island empire of Vallia. Thanks to their immersion in the pool Prescot and Delia gain extended natural lifespans of a thousand years, but by violating the sanctity of the pool both are banished back to their homelands‚Äîin Prescot‚Äôs case, Earth. Returned to Kregen through the agency of the Star Lords, an even more mysterious rival group of unknown motivations, Prescot becomes a pawn in their schemes, sent willy-nilly to various locations on the planet to serve their ends and capriciously returned to Earth when his task is done or when he manages to offend them. Despite this handicap he usually rises to a position of power in whatever society he is thrust into, and is able to renew and further his relationship with Delia. Eventually they are able to wed and found a family. Aside from carrying out his missions for the Star Lords, securing his place on Kregen, and winning (and returning) to Delia, Prescot‚Äôs ongoing goals include the suppression of slavery in Paz and building a coalition against the marauding Shanks, a Viking-like race of fish-headed Diffs who raid the coasts of Paz from a base in the opposite hemisphere of Kregen. The text is ostensibly a transcript by ‚ÄúAkers‚Äù of a series of audio tapes recorded by Dray Prescot on periodic returns to Earth, which come into his hands by a variety of means over a number of years. Supposed gaps in the tapes allow the author the opportunity of occasional jumps in the narrative, leaving teasing mysteries for the reader as to just what might have happened in between. The cycles into which the sequence is divided form substories within the overall storyline, sometimes arranged topically and sometimes by setting. These sequences include: * The Delian Cycle, which relates Prescot‚Äôs earliest sojourns on Kregen, introduces a number of the main Kregish settings, and resolves his initial quest for the hand of Delia. * The Havilfar Cycle, set on the continent of Havilfar, unseen in the earlier cycle, which deals mainly with Prescot‚Äôs quest to learn the secret of manufacturing vollers, or airships, a monopoly of Havilfar‚Äôs expansionist empire of Hamal. * The Krozair Cycle, which returns Prescot to the Eye of the World, a Mediterranean-like locale first visited in the Delian Cycle, where he is now outlawed for having failed to aid his fellow members in the warrior brotherhood of the Krozairs of Zy (he was on Earth at the time). * The Vallian Cycle, which plunges the empire of Vallia into civil war, which only the exertions of Prescot can resolve. * The Jikaida Cycle, which finds him as a sort of gladiator condemned to fight in living games of Jikaida, ordinarily a chess-like board game played by the peoples of Kregen. The game of Jikaida was inspired by Jetan, or Martian Chess, invented by Edgar Rice Burroughs for his Martian novels. * The Spikatur cycle. * The Pandahem Cycle, dealing mainly with the affairs of the island continent of Pandahem. * The Witch War Cycle, concerning Prescot's efforts to combat a magical curse placed on Vallia. * The Lohvian Cycle, set primarily on the continent of Loh. * The Balintol Cycle, set primarily on the subcontinent of Balintol. * The Spectre Cycle, set primarily in Vallia, this is the final group of Dray Prescot novels. The story never catches up to the present, although from Prescot‚Äôs mysterious appearances and disappearances in the present day it can be presumed that his role as a pawn of the Star Lords continues. Prescot learns more of the rival Star Lords and Savanti as the series progresses, though their mysteries are never fully resolved. It was Bulmer‚Äôs expressed intent to resolve the sequence in volume 53 by having Prescot and Delia experience a sort of apotheosis, possibly raising them to the level of Star Lords themselves, to be revealed in a final visit to Earth by their son Drak, thus accounting for the unfinished nature of the narrative. This volume was never completed by Bulmer, and remains an unpublished fragment.

The documentary features candid interviews with Argento and various stars from films he has directed, as well as extensive clips and behind-the-scenes footage of his films. The film includes segments focused on subjects as the soundtrack work, coloring and color filtering, and camerawork in Suspiria, the soundtrack for Inferno, the camerawork and insect effects in Phenomena, Tom Savini's make-up work in Dawn of the Dead, and the special effects, make-up and robotics in D√®moni as well as interviews with Argento on a variety of esoteric subjects. Because most of Argento's films were only available in heavily edited form at the time, Dario Argento's World of Horror was sought after by many fans of the director's work because it contained numerous clips of footage removed from the released films, most notably the opening double murder sequence from Suspiria. Reception From contemporary reviews, an anonymous reviewer in Fangoria, who found the film \\"fascinating but also strangely endearing\\" noting that the documentary was \\"a delightful eye-opener, An Americans who want to know what all the fuss is bout this visionary writer-director can get a good start here.\\" Tim Lucas wrote in Fangoria that the documentary was \\"fascinating\\" and offered many scenes that were at the time cut from American releases of Argento's films including The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, The Cat o' Nine Tails, Four Flies on Grey Velvet, Tenebrae and Suspiria. Lucas also proclaimed that the films \\"real accomplishment is its portrat of Argento's professional intensity and dedication; he cleary deserves to be taken more seriously by American film audiences, critics, and distributors.\\" References  External links  * Films directed by Michele Soavi Documentary films about film directors and producers Italian films Documentary films about horror Dario Argento ","title":"Dario Argento's World of Horror"},{"id":"3819597","text":"Martin Mutschmann (9 March 1879 - 14 February 1947) was the Nazi Regional Leader (Gauleiter) of the state of Saxony (Gau Saxony) during the time of the Third Reich. Biography Born in Hirschberg on the Saale in the Principality of Reuss-Gera, Germany, Mutschmann moved while he was young with his family to Plauen in Saxony. He served an apprenticeship as an embroiderer and from 1896 to 1901 was employed as a master embroiderer, department head and warehouse director in lace and linen factories in Plauen, Herford and K√∂ln. That was followed by military service from 1901-1903, after which he returned to employment in the Plauen Lace Factory (Plauener Spitzenfabriken). He established his own lace factory, Mutschmann & Eisentraut, in Plauen in October 1907. During World War I, he served on the Western Front until he was severely wounded in April 1916. He was discharged from the Army as unfit for field service on 24 December 1916, and resumed the direction of his factory in Plauen. After the war, he was an early participant in the nationalist and anti-Semitic Deutschv√∂lkischer Schutz und Trutzbund. He joined the National Socialist German Workers Party NSDAP in April 1922, was a founding member of the local branch (Ortsgruppe) in Plauen and made personal donations of capital to the Nazi Party. Mutschmann lost his lace business in the Great Depression, but he continued to solicit donations from other businesses. His fundraising skills found favour with the Nazi Party, and with Adolf Hitler whom he visited in Landsberg prison. After the Party was re-established in 1925, Mutschmann was appointed Landesleiter (later Gauleiter) of Saxony on 27 March 1925, maintaining that position until the end of World War II. Generally his political activity concentrated on Saxony rather than on Germany as a whole. Mutschmann was passionately interested in the preservation of Saxon arts and crafts. In September 1930, he was elected to the Reichstag for electoral constituency 30, Chemnitz-Zwickau. On 15 July 1932 came his appointment as Landesinspekteur. In this position, he had oversight responsibility for his Gau and that of Thuringia. This was a short-lived initiative by Gregor Strasser to centralize control over the Gaue. However, it was unpopular with the Gauleiters and was repealed on Strasser's fall from power in December 1932. Mutschmann then returned to his Gauleiter position in Saxony. After the Nazis came to power, Mutschmann was appointed Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governor) of Saxony on 5 May 1933. A passionate hunter, he was the Gauj√§germeister (Hunting Master) of Saxony on 10 September 1934. He was often accused of being more interested in his hobby than the welfare of Saxony. On 28 February 1935, he also became the Minister-President of Saxony, displacing his rival, Manfred Freiherr von Killinger, who was purged in the aftermath of the Night of the Long Knives. Mutschmann was one of only two Gauleiters, (the other being Jakob Sprenger) to simultaneously occupy both the Reichsstatthalter and Minister-President positions. On 9 November 1937, he was promoted to SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer. When the war began on 1 September 1939, Mutschmann was appointed the Reich Defense Commissioner for Wehrkreis (Military District) IV. On 16 November 1942, he became Reich Defense Commissioner for Saxony with responsibility for air and civil defense measures. Mutschmann was blamed for not adequately preparing for the horrific bombing of Dresden which occurred from 13-15 February 1945. On 14 April 1945 he declared Dresden a \\"fortress\\" city. On 1 May in Dresden, he insisted that the city go into public mourning after the suicide of German dictator Adolf Hitler on 30 April 1945. On 5 May, Mutschmann falsely announced that a large- scale German offensive on the Eastern Front was about to be launched. On 8 May as Dresden was occupied by the Red Army, Mutschmann fled the city. Moving to Oberwiesenthal and then to Tellerh√§user, he hid out until arrested by police on 17 May. He was displayed in the town square and subjected to public ridicule. Handed over to the NKVD, he was imprisoned in the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, tried by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union and sentenced to death on 30 January 1947. He was shot on 14 February 1947.Ernst Klee, Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich, Frankfurt 2003. (Biographies of persons of the Third Reich).

Life and career He was grandson of explorer and Missouri governor, General William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. His father was Major Meriwether Lewis Clark Sr., \\"aide de camp\\" and in-law to General Stephen Watts Kearny, of Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War fame (Kearny married Mary Radford, the stepdaughter of Clark). His mother was Abigail Prather Churchill, from one of the first families of Kentucky. The Churchills had moved to Louisville in 1787 and bought of land in a rural area south of the city. When his mother died, \\"Lutie\\" (as Clark was called) went to live with his aunt and her sons John and Henry Churchill. They had inherited most of the original Churchill property, and they donated the land on which Churchill Downs was built. Living with the Churchills, Lutie developed a taste for expensive things, including horse racing. He made two trips to Europe and married twice, both of his wives dying young. He came home from abroad in 1873 with ideas about building a racetrack in Louisville. He planned to eliminate bookmaking by introducing the French system of parimutuel betting machines. The Churchill brothers were the entrepreneurs providing the financial backing, and Lutie was the acting president and on-site manager. By all accounts, Clark had a mercurial and touchy personality. He is reported to have threatened prominent breeder T. G. Moore with a gun, ordering him off the premises after having knocked him down in a dispute over fees. Moore got a gun and shot Clark through a door, hitting him in the chest. Moore turned himself in to the police, but no charges were brought against him. Clark later rescinded his ban from the racetrack. He also threatened others with a gun over perceived insults. The Churchill brothers did not appreciate the negative publicity, and they left the track to their families. Clark received some other land, but by the time John Churchill died in 1897, Lutie was merely a steward at the track he had originated. His contribution to American racing cannot be overstated. In addition to building Churchill Downs and originating the Kentucky Derby, he wrote many racing rules that are still in force today. He worked for a uniform system of weights and pioneered the stakes system, creating the Great American Stallion Stakes, on which the present-day Breeders' Cup is modeled. He also spoke out against betting by officials and reporters. Clark lost heavily in the stock market crash of 1893 and began traveling from city to city working as a steward. Fearing a life of poverty, he committed suicide with a pistol on April 22, 1899. He is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery next to his uncle, John Churchill.

It was under the command of the Admiral of Patrols at the Admiralty and was the pioneer of anti-submarine warfare. History On May 1st 1912 the post of Admiral of Patrols was established responsible for five destroyer flotilla's covering waters around the British Isles. In 1914, the Board of Admiralty sent an order the Admiralty War Staff to re-evaluate the functional role the patrol flotillas off the Eastern Coast of Britain the First Sea Lord indicated that the current function of patrolling would now be that of coastal defence. After the implementation took place R Admiral de Robeck was then replaced as (ADMOP) by a new commander Commodore George A. Ballard.Lambert. Sir John Fisher's Naval Revolution. p. 286.

Issue 40512, col B, p. 6. the auxiliary patrol was then a component part of the Admiral of Patrols command until 1917. The majority of British trawlers were commandeered by the Admiralty, and those left were obliged to fish in groups of 20 with additional protection. The Auxiliary Patrol was crewed by fishermen and led mainly by Merchant Navy men commissioned into the Royal Naval Reserve. They operated as trawlers do, in all weathers. Their trawlers were retrofitted with armaments, typically 3,6 or 12-pounder guns as well as 7.5\\" Bomb Throwers (Anti Submarine howitzers). Specialist crew such as signallers and gunners were also put on board. Later in the war the Admiralty built 3 classes of larger trawlers as well as developing a new special class of Minesweeper. By the Second World War, the Royal Navy had formed a specialist minesweeping capability, and the Royal Naval Patrol Service was formed, known to many as \\"Harry Tate's Navy\\".

The term \\"sea lice\\" or \\"sea ants\\" is also sometimes used to describe seabather's eruption, although it is not in fact caused by the sea louse, a parasite that affects only fish. It should not be confused with swimmer's itch. Symptoms and signs Symptoms generally arise later after one takes a shower. It is unusual to notice the eruptions immediately. Symptoms can last from a few days up to two weeks, the shorter time being the norm. The reaction is identified by severe itching around small red papules 1mm to 1.5 cm in size located on areas of skin that were covered by water- permeable clothing or hair during ocean swimming. Initial swimmer exposure to the free-floating larvae produces no effects, as each organism possesses only a single undeveloped nematocyst which is inactive while suspended in seawater. However, due to their microscopic size and sticky bodies, large concentrations of larvae can become trapped in minute gaps between skin and clothing or hair. Once the swimmer leaves the ocean, the organisms stuck against the skin die and automatically discharge their nematocysts when crushed, dried out, or exposed to freshwater. This is why symptoms usually do not appear until the swimmer dries themselves in the sun or takes a freshwater shower without first removing the affected clothing. Treatment Treatment is symptomatic, with most affected using a topical anti-itch cream (diphenhydramine) and a cortisone solution (hydrocortisone). Incidence This reaction occurs mainly in the tropics and in Florida, due to the proximity of the Gulf Stream to the state. It has been identified in other locations as well. =Bahamas= At certain times of the year, this can be a problem in some areas of The Bahamas, particularly around New Providence. =Bermuda= Cases have been found in Bermuda in 2011, 2014, and 2015, with Paradise Lakes proving particularly bad. In 2015 many felt the effects after swimming in Mangrove Bay and Harrington Sound. =Philippines= Seabather's eruption is also an issue in various parts of Anilao and Mindoro in the Philippines. It typically occurs within of the surface, just above the coral reefs. Snorkelers are most prone because of their proximity to the surface. Scuba divers encounter less of this, and usually in shore dives. The occurrence of stinging is highly probable whenever plankton is abundant. =Thailand= As recently as October 2007, individual reports indicate that cnidarian larvae capable of causing seabather's eruption are present in the Gulf of Siam along the western coast area near Hua Hin. In January 2014, reports of larvae and seabather's eruption occurred around Koh Phi Phi and Ko Yao Noi. An outbreak in Koh Phi Phi occurred in March 2016. =Brazil= Cases were first identified in Brazil in 2001. =New Zealand= Swimmers at Auckland's east-coast beaches and in the rest of the Hauraki Gulf can suffer seabather's eruption, typically during summer. =United States= Cases of seabather's eruption occur in Hawaii and many of the states along the Gulf of Mexico during the summer months. Cases are common from May to July in Florida, and in certain parts of Hawaii from April to August.

It features Broderick Crawford, Richard Basehart and Giulietta Masina. Released one year after the director's internationally successful La Strada, Il bidone continues with many of the same socially conscious, neorealist-inspired themes while minimizing the poetic realism and extravagant vitality, that is today known as \\"felliniesque\\", in favor of a more pointed political stance.Cowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, November 20, 1964. Last accessed: January 26, 2008. Plot In the country outside Rome, a group of swindlers dress up as clerics and con poor farmers out of their savings. Another scam in a shanty town is to pretend they are officials taking deposits for apartments. The proceeds are spent on flashy cars, champagne and prostitutes. One member of the gang, Picasso, pretends to his faithful wife Iris that he is a painter, but after a New Year's Eve party among criminals she stops believing him. His conscience is pricked and he decides to quit. Another member, Augusto, meets his teenage daughter Patrizia who he has not seen for years, and his conscience is also awakened. However he is recognised in a cinema with her, arrested and jailed. When released he forms a new gang to work the clergy scam among peasants. After swindling a large sum out of a farming family, he talks to their paralysed teenage daughter. Her plight touches him, and when the gang come to share out the gains he says he gave it all back. A row develops and he is battered to the ground. Stripping him, the crooks find he has concealed the takings in his clothes. On a snowy hillside, they leave him to a slow death.

He moved with his family to Italy at the age of 11. The keyboardist of the progressive rock band Goblin, Simonetti has specialized in the scores for Italian and American horror films since the 1970s. A long-time collaborator of director Dario Argento, Simonetti has worked on several of the director/producer's films including Deep Red, Suspiria, Dawn of the Dead, Tenebrae, Phenomena, Demoni, and Opera. His work has long been an iconic staple of Italian genre cinema, collaborating with directors like Ruggero Deodato, Umberto Lenzi, Lucio Fulci, Enzo G. Castellari, Lamberto Bava, and Sergio Martino. His highly experimental scores are known for their signature, electronic and progressive rock-influenced sound, and have been imitated numerous times. He studied at the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome. Biography The son of composer and entertainer Enrico, he was the keyboard player for the Italian progressive rock band Goblin, which initially formed under the name Cherry Five. He has been influenced by Keith Emerson, Brian Auger, Rick Wakeman and Tony Banks.Interview: Claudio Simonetti (Goblin), Hit- channel.com, 20 June 2014; retrieved 9 November 2015. Simonetti's film work includes the scores to many popular and cult films such as Conquest (1983), The New Barbarians (1983), Cut and Run (1985), Midnight Killer (1986), Hands of Steel (1986), Body Count (1987), and The Versace Murder (1998). Beginning in 1978, Simonetti founded a number of electronic disco projects. In 1979, with Giancarlo Meo, he formed perhaps his best-known project behind singer Vivien Vee (Viviana Andreattini), whose song \\"Give Me a Break\\" became a minor hit in the American dance charts. Later Vivien Vee tracks, particularly \\"Blue Disease\\" from 1983, showcased some of the darker and edgier sounds familiar from the Goblin years. Another project he was involved in was Easy Going, with \\"Baby I Love You\\" from 1978, and \\"Fear\\" from 1979. In 1983, he was the central member of the Italo disco group Crazy Gang. Soundtracks ‚Äì A tribute to Pino Rucher. The Daemonia band are playing a composition from the film Phenomena. In 1999, Simonetti formed the heavy metal band Daemonia, which has recorded updated versions of Goblin favorites in addition to original material. Daemonia has also contributed tracks to U.S. DVD releases of Italian horror movies. He composed the title track \\"Mater Lacrimarum\\" for The Mother of Tears soundtrack in 2007, which features background vocals by Dani Filth. In 2009, Simonetti collaborated with the Los Angeles heavy metal band Rusty Eye. He played keyboard on \\"Mondo Cane\\" and \\"Wings of the Demon\\" from the album Possessor. On 16 October 2010, Simonetti with his group Daemonia took part in the event Soundtracks ‚Äì A tribute to Pino Rucher. The event was sponsored by the Municipal Authorities of San Nicandro Garganico and Manfredonia. Also in 2010, Simonetti reunited with his former Goblin bandmates Massimo Moranti and Maurizio Guarani along with his group Daemonia's rhythm section to form New Goblin. They played several concerts around the world. This lasted until the fall of 2013 when he left New Goblin along with Daemonia's rhythm section to reform Daemonia under the new banner Simonetti's Goblin. In 2013, he played keyboard on the \\"Aggregat 4\\" track from the Simulakrum Lab album, a vintage synthesizers music project created by Paolo Prevosto. 2015 released with the Murder Collections, new arranged version of his film themes, include Profondo Rosso, Suspiria, Tenebrae, and Dawn of the Dead.\\"Claudio Simonetti's Goblin Announces 'Murder Collection'\\", Bloody-disgusting.com, 28 January 2015; retrieved 9 November 2015.

It depicts the events on board a luxury liner filled with the friends of a deceased opera singer who have gathered to mourn her. The film was selected as the Italian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 56th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot The film opens depicting a scene in July 1914 immediately prior to the cruise ship Gloria N. setting sail from Naples Harbor. The opening sequence is in sepia tones, as if it were a film shot in that era, with no sound other than the whirring of the projector. Gradually the sepia fades into full colour and we can hear the characters‚Äô dialogue. Orlando, an Italian journalist, supplies commentary by directly addressing the camera, explaining to the viewer that the cruise is a funeral voyage to disperse the ashes of opera singer Edmea Tetua near the island of Erimo, her birthplace. Considered the greatest singer of all time, Tetua is celebrated for her goddess-like voice. The bumbling but lovable journalist also provides highly subjective anecdotes and gossip on the wide array of cartoon characters that evoke the golden age of the \\"funny papers\\" (Little Nemo, Bringing Up Father, The Katzenjammer Kids) but with a perverse Felliniesque twist. These include more opera singers, voice teachers, orchestra directors, theatre producers, actors, prime ministers, counts, princesses, Grand Dukes, and panic-stricken fans of the deceased diva. A jealous and bitter soprano named Ildebranda desperately tries to penetrate the secret behind Edmea Tetua's unforgettable voice. A bristle-haired Russian basso is shown around the ship's vast mess hall where, using only his voice, he hypnotizes a chicken. A curly-cued actor travels with his mother in order to seduce sailors. Sir Reginald Dongby, a voyeuristic English aristocrat, relishes spying on Lady Violet, his nymphomaniac wife. The Grand Duke of Harzock, a Prussian, is an obese bubble of a young man whose blind sister (the Tanztheater performer and choreographer Pina Bausch) schemes with her lover, the prime minister, to disinherit her brother. The brooding Count of Bassano closets himself in his cabin transformed into a temple dedicated to the diva's memory. An awful stench rises from the ship's hold and soon it's revealed that a love-sick rhinoceros has been neglected by the ship's crew. The beast is pulled up, washed on deck, and returned to the hold with fresh water and hay. On the third day of the voyage, the passengers discover a crowd of shipwrecked Serbians camped on the deck of the ship. Fleeing in rafts towards Italy after the assassination at Sarajevo, the refugees were brought on board the previous night by the captain. The Grand Duke and his men, however, are convinced the Serbians are terrorists and order the captain to isolate the group to a corner of the ship. The upshot is Fellini's barely disguised take on the Marx Brothers's A Night at the Opera in a heady mix of cultures, both ethnic and artistic, where aristocrats and snobs joyfully share the stage (the ship's deck) with peasants and vibrant Serbian folklore (as choreographed by Leonetta Bentivoglio). But the revels end when the menacing flagship of the Austro- Hungarian fleet sails into view, demanding the return of the Serbian refugees. The captain agrees on condition that Edmea Tetua's ashes be dispersed at Erimo beforehand. After the ceremony, the refugees are loaded into a lifeboat for delivery to the Austrians but a young Serbian hurls a bomb at the flagship, causing pandemonium. The Austrians respond by cannon fire. The Gloria N. sinks while Albertini wields his baton, aristocrats march to the lifeboats, a grand piano slides across the floor smashing mirrors, and butterflies twitter serenely above the melee of suitcases in flooded corridors. In a reverse tracking shot, Fellini reveals the stupendous behind-the-scenes of his floating opera of a movie - giant hydraulic jacks (constructed by Oscar- winning set designer, Dante Ferretti) that created the ship's rolling sea movements, along with acres of plastic ocean, an army of technicians burning naphthalene for the smoke of disaster effect, and, finally, an enigmatic figure that may be Orlando or Fellini intentionally hiding behind his own camera filming the main camera filming himself. The main camera then tracks forward to a final shot of Orlando in a lifeboat with the rhinoceros happily munching on hay. \\"Did you know,\\" confides Orlando, \\"that a rhinoceros gives very good milk?\\" Laughing, he once again mans the oars to disappear on a vast plastic ocean.

The result was a society founded on a continuous yet contemptible melodrama. The other genial intuition is that of the fundamental unity of the world back then which was completely bourgeois or utterly obsessed with the bourgeoisie. This idea comes through magnificently in the scene where immaculate opera singers perform leaning over the iron balcony of the engine room as sweat-grimed workers cease stoking the furnace with coal to listen to the splendid voices.\\"Fava, Claudio G., and Aldo Vigano, The Films of Federico Fellini, Citadel Press: New York, 1990, p. 187.

He also worked with Joe Cocker, Elton John and Mark-Almond. Biography Richmond was born Charles Daniel Richmond on December 15, 1931, in New York City and grew up in Greensboro, North Carolina.Although Richmond himself gave his birth year as 1935, the New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd Edition, vol.3, p.411, states that Richmond's social security records confirm that he was born in 1931. He started playing tenor saxophone at the age of thirteen, and went on to play R&B; with the Paul Williams band in 1955. His career took off when he took up the drums, in his early twenties, through the formation of what was to be a 21-year association with Charles Mingus. Mingus biographer Brian Priestley writes that \\"Dannie became Mingus's equivalent to Harry Carney in the Ellington band, an indispensable ingredient of 'the Mingus sound' and a close friend as well\\".Priestley, Brian. Mingus ‚Äì A Critical Biography. London: Paladin, 1982, p.86. That association continued after Mingus' death when Richmond became the first musical director of the group Mingus Dynasty in 1980. He died of a heart attack in Harlem on March 16, 1988, at the age of 56.

To the south the Azawagh region is characterised by dry plains and ancient dry river valleys arcing to the southwest from the A√Ør Mountains. Assamakka has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh) with extreme heat and a great lack of rainfall. From late April to late October, the mercury rises almost every day above 40 ¬∞C in the shade; in June, the average high temperature even exceeds 45 ¬∞C in the shade. All year long, days are very hot and sunny. The cloud cover and precipitation are absent except during the short irregular \\"rainy\\" season in July and August, then the weather clears up again. Population The town itself has long been a Tuareg encampment at a strategic desert well. What small population which is found here are nomadic or semi nomadic Tuareg, many of whom engage in cross border trade with Tuareg communities to the north and south, or pass through this area around the brief rainy season of the Azawagh plains to the far southwest. The area is dominated by Tuareg tribal populations, as well as nomadic minorities, including Hassaniyya-speaking Moors (also called Azawagh Arabs, not to be confused with Niger's Diffa Arabs) in the northwest border regions of Niger. The Azawagh area is the centre for the Iwellemeden Kel Denneg federation.For an introduction to the culture of the Azawagh Arabs, see: Rebecca Popenoe. Feeding Desire ‚Äì Fatness, Beauty and Sexuality among a Saharan People. Routledge, London (2003) The town itself has grown as a transit point for migrants from sub-Saharan Africa to the Maghreb. Trucks from the south drop off migrants here, who must then arrange trips over the border. Consequently, the small population is ethnically diverse and fluctuates. Illegal migrants deported south from Algeria are also returned here, sometimes in large numbers.Franklin Graham.

The electoral ward with the same name had a population of 6,125 at the 2011 census. Geography Chudleigh is very close to the edge of Dartmoor and in the Teign Valley. Nearby Castle Dyke is an Iron Age Hill Fort which demonstrates far earlier settlement in the area. It is also near Haldon Forest, a Forestry Commission property. The town has been bypassed by the A38 road since 1972. It has expanded a good deal in recent years as commuter houses have been built around its edges, but still retains a fairly traditional town centre. Chudleigh Carnival The earliest written record of a Carnival in Chudleigh in the Council Minutes is an entry of 7 November 1910, asking for free use of the town hall but offering to pay for gas used. Monies raised were to go to local hospitals. However, in The South Devon Weekly Express of 8 September 1950, Arthur Holcombe states the First Carnival was held in 1908 on Thursday 16 November. There is uncertainty of exactly when it was moved to the Summer. Twenty tableaux entered and the length of the procession extended for 400 yards. The Tiverton town band and the Chudleigh Brass Band marched and played in the parade. No carnival was held during the First or Second World Wars. Following the procession of 1961 the build up of traffic, due to the road closure whilst the parade took place, was so bad that the police and local authorities decided that such a situation could not be tolerated. At that time the A38 ran through Chudleigh town centre and holiday traffic was estimated to tail back 25 miles to Honiton when stopped for the procession. The carnival was suspended as a result of this. The bypass was built 1972 and the carnival committee reconvened for celebrations on the opening of the bypass. The carnival started again on 21 July 1973. Carnival weeks and processions continued annually and during the 1970s the carnival association was formed. It comprises other towns and villages in the area which hold similar weeks and each have their own Carnival Queen and Royalty/tableau. These floats attend the Carnival processions and are judged at each by different representatives. During the latter half of the 1990s Chudleigh Carnival committee created floats that won the shield one year and completed consistently in other years. Carnival Committees, whilst strong at times, struggle to attract a sufficient number of members in other years. Although financially secure, such has been the case in Chudleigh of late with difficulty attracting fresh committee members. Having seen other towns give up on carnivals, in 2006 no carnival week or procession was held for this very reason. 2007 witnessed a change of fortune and, although unable to attend other processions in the region, the carnival week and parade were held and were quite successful. In 2007 new members joined and 2008 saw a new carnival float once again attending other processions and Chudleigh claimed the South Devon shield for 2008. Parish church Chudleigh church The church of St Martin and St Mary was consecrated in 1259. The structure is medieval but was heavily restored in 1868. The rood screen has paintings of saints and prophets and the Courtenay family coat of arms.Pevsner, N. (1952) South Devon. (The Buildings of England.) Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 79 In 1887 St Bridget's Abbey of Syon built a monastery, known as Chudleigh Abbey, which they occupied until 1925. Great Fire of Chudleigh The weather conditions in Devon in the year 1807 have been described as a drought. Weeks without rain left many people short of water and had farmers worrying about their crops. At around noon on 22 May, a small fire broke out in pile of furze stacked near the ovens at a bakery in Culver Street (now New Exeter Street). According to later reports, the staff in the bakery seemed unaware of the danger this posed, but the fire, fed by the exceptionally dry fuel, exploded. In the shortest time imaginable, the fire had spread to the roof of the bakery (thatched, as were 90% of the houses in Chudleigh at the time) and huge hunks of burning reed and straw were swept aloft by a rapidly growing north-easterly wind. After the fire, only the church and seven houses were left standing.

Plot Interviewed by a Japanese TV crew for a news report on his latest film, Fellini takes the viewer behind the scenes at Cinecitt√†. A nighttime set is prepared for a sequence that Fellini defines as ‚Äúthe prisoner‚Äôs dream‚Äù in which his hands grope for a way out of a dark tunnel. With advancing age and weight, Fellini is finding it difficult to escape by simply flying away, but when he does, he contemplates Cinecitt√† from a great height. The next morning, Fellini accompanies the Japanese TV crew on a brief tour of the studios. As they walk past absurd TV commercials in production, Fellini's casting director presents him with four young actors she's found to interpret Karl Rossmann, the leading role in the maestro's film version of Kafka's Amerika. Fellini introduces the Japanese to the female custodian of Cinecitt√† (Nadia Ottaviani) but she succeeds in putting off the interview by disappearing into the deserted backlot of Studio 5 to gather dandelions to make herbal tea. Meanwhile, Fellini's assistant director (Maurizio Mein) is on location with other crew members at the Casa del Passeggero, a once cheap hotel now converted into a drugstore. Fellini wants to include it in his film about the first time he visited Cinecitt√† as a journalist in 1938 during the Fascist era.Interviewed by Alain Finkielkraut for the Messager europ√©en, Fellini explained that the ‚Äúfirst time I visited Cinecitt√†, I was 18 years old, a journalist from Rimini who considered Cinecitt√† as something legendary.‚Äù In Fellini, Intervista, 228.

After the crew reconstruct the facade of the Casa del Passeggero elsewhere in Rome, a fake tramway takes young Fellini/Rubini from America's Far West with Indian warriors on a clifftop to a herd of wild elephants off the coast of Ethiopia. Arriving at Cinecitt√†, he sets off to interview matinee idol, Greta Gonda.\\"I came to interview an actress named Greta Gonda and it was the first interview I conducted, the first time I went to Cinecitt√†, and the first encounter with an actress I liked very much.‚Äù Fellini, Intervista, 228 Seamlessly, the illusion takes over the realities of moviemaking as the viewer is thrown into two feature films being directed by tyrannical directors. But only for a short while; for the rest of the film, Fellini and his assistant director (Maurizio Mein) scramble to recruit the right cast and build the sets for the film version of Amerika, a fictitious adaptation that Fellini uses as a pretext to shoot his film-in-progress. This allows Fellini/Rubini to go back and forth in time to experience filmmaking first-hand including disgruntled actors who failed their auditions, Marcello Mastroianni in a TV commercial as Mandrake the Magician, a bomb threat, a visit to Anita Ekberg‚Äôs house where she and Mastroianni re-live their La Dolce Vita scenes, screen tests of Kafka‚Äôs Brunelda caressed in a bathtub by two young men, and an inconvenient thunderstorm that heralds the production collapse of Amerika with an attack by bogus Indians on horseback wielding television antennae as spears. Back inside Studio 5 at Cinecitt√†, Intervista concludes with Fellini‚Äôs voiceover, ‚ÄúSo the movie should end here.

History Christianity first came to Tuvalu in 1861 when Elekana, a deacon of a Congregational church in Manihiki, Cook Islands became caught in a storm and drifted for eight weeks before landing at Nukulaelae.Laumua Kofe, Palagi and Pastors, Tuvalu: A History, Ch. 15, U.S.P. & Tuvalu (1983) Elekana began proselytising Christianity. He was trained at Malua Theological College, a London Missionary Society school in Samoa, before beginning his work in establishing the Church of Tuvalu. In 1865, the Rev A. W. Murray of the London Missionary Society ‚Äì a Protestant congregationalist missionary society ‚Äì arrived as the first European missionary where he too proselytised among the inhabitants of Tuvalu. By 1878, Christianity was well-established with preachers on each island. At the end of the 19th century, the ministers of what became the Church of Tuvalu were predominantly Samoans, who influenced the development of the Tuvaluan language and the music of Tuvalu. In 1969, the Church acquired its independence from the LMS, since which time it has sent some missionaries to serve Tuvaluan migrants in Fiji, New Zealand, Hawaii, Australia, and the Marshall Islands.

For years Ceravolo‚Äôs work was out of print, but the 2013 publication of his Collected Poems has made his work accessible again. His popularity has been limited to the community of writers. As Charles North writes ‚Äú[Ceravolo‚Äôs] importance to American poetry over the past 30 years is still largely a secret.‚Äù Life Joseph Ceravolo was born in Queens, New York into a family of Italian immigrants. Ceravolo studied writing with Kenneth Koch at the New School for Social Research. In addition to his career as a poet, Ceravolo worked as a civil engineer. He began writing poetry while stationed in Germany in the late 1950s. He lived much of his life in New Jersey. Ceravolo had a wife, Rosemary, and three children, Paul, Anita, and James. He died in 1988 due to bile duct cancer. Work Ceravolo is associated with the second generation of the New York School (which includes writers such as Bernadette Mayer, Bill Berkson, Ron Padgett, Ted Berrigan, Anne Waldman and Lewis Warsh). Although Ceravolo‚Äôs work shares some of the same warmth and immediacy that typifies some of the other New York School Second Generation, his work is less prone to use conversational language and is often less directly humorous than much New York School writing. Influences on Ceravolo‚Äôs poetry include Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams and E. E. Cummings as well as Asian and Native American poetry. Many of Ceravolo‚Äôs poems are marked by distorted syntax, elisions, juxtaposition and fragments (a trait he shares with Clark Coolidge, a writer also sometimes associated with the second generation of the New York School) resulting in poems that surprise with their refracted meanings and misdirections. The structure and shape of Ceravolo‚Äôs poetry changed over the course of his career: the poems of one of Ceravolo‚Äôs early books, Fits of Dawn, are characterized by a dense, relentless gush of words; Ceravolo‚Äôs poems (such as in Spring in this World of Poor Mutts) then increasingly experiment with spacing and twists added by conjunction and preposition; poems in Ceravolo‚Äôs later books tend to be more direct and lyrical, although parataxis is still prevalent. Ceravolo‚Äôs poems often focus on the natural world, as opposed to the social world. The titles of almost all of his books contain a reference to natural phenomena (Fits of Dawn, Wild Flowers Out of Gas, Spring In This World of Poor Mutts, Millennium Dust) and the same is true of the titles of his individual poems. Sometimes simple, sometimes elliptical, Ceravolo‚Äôs poems shortcut conventional description, and as Kenneth Koch says they become almost as physical as the natural world encountered in them. An example is the poem ‚ÄúDrunken Winter‚Äù. An enthusiasm can be found in much of Ceravolo‚Äôs work, exemplified by use of imperative, address and exclamation, and aided by his syntactical abstraction. A good example of this is found in his poem ‚ÄúThe Book of Wild Flowers‚Äù. Even where Ceravolo‚Äôs poems are ‚Äúquiet‚Äù, they possess an intensity and openness; as is the case in this passage from his poem ‚ÄúBoth Close by Me, Both‚Äù.

Based on the novel Il poema dei lunatici by Ermano Cavazzoni, and revisiting themes Fellini first explored in La strada (1954), the film is about a fake inspector of wells and a former prefect who wander through the Emilia-Romagna countryside of Fellini's childhood and discover a dystopia of television commercials, fascism, beauty pageants, rock music, Catholicism, and pagan ritual. The film received David di Donatello Awards for Best Actor, Best Editing, and Best Production Design, and nominations for Best Director, Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Music, and Best Producer. The Voice of the Moon was Fellini's last film before his death in 1993. Plot With a nod to the lunar-obsessed lyrics of Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi,A portrait of Leopardi hangs in Ivo's childhood bedroom while a large Pinocchio puppet stands in a corner. the acerbic tale focuses on the capture of the moon by the Micheluzzi Brothers while Ivo, newly released from a mental hospital, tries to seduce Aldina Ferruzzi with whom he's infatuated. Although she wants nothing to do with him, Ivo equates her blond beauty with the moon, the origin of his madness and frustration. During the attempts to woo her, he meets various madcap characters including an oboist who sleeps in the local cemetery, a man whose hobby is meditating on rooftops, and Gonnella, the ex-prefect fired for his rising paranoia. Gonnella makes Ivo his lieutenant and together they investigate the \\"wild conspiracies\\" going on around them. The oddball pair attends a farcical beauty pageant where Aldina is crowned \\"Miss Flour of 1989\\" and ends up lost in the farmlands among graceful African women chanting in the moonlight. Inside an abandoned warehouse, they discover an Inferno-like disco of fashion victims dancing and bopping deliriously to Michael Jackson's \\"The Way You Make Me Feel.\\" Ivo realises that Aldina's shoe, obtained surreptitiously, fits every Cinderella who tries it on. To the dancers' stupefaction, Gonnella orchestrates a waltz but is thrown out after smashing the disc jockey's cache of records. Meanwhile, the three demented Micheluzzi brothers have caught the moon using gigantic farming equipment and roped it down in a stable. What ought to be a sacred event becomes a squandered opportunity as priests and politicians turn it into a conference for official propaganda voiced to the assembled public. The conference rapidly degenerates into violence by a madman with a pistol screaming, \\"What am I doing here? Why was I put here in the first place?\\" leaving Ivo Salvini with the film's last words: \\"If we all quieted down a little, maybe we'd understand something.\\" Cast * Roberto Benigni as Ivo Salvini * Paolo Villaggio as Gonnella * Nadia Ottaviani as Aldina * Marisa Tomasi as Marisa * Angelo Orlando as Nestore * Susy Blady as Susy * Dario Ghirardi as Journalist * Dominique Chevalier as 1st Micheluzzi Brother * Nigel Harris as 2nd Micheluzzi Brother * Daniela Airoldi * Stefano Antonucci * Ferruccio Brembilla * Stefano Cedrati * Sim Themes In Ermanno Cavazzoni's 1987 novel, Il poema dei lunatici (The Lunatics' Poem) on which the film is loosely based, Fellini recognized an abandoned project about filming the natural world: \\"the soil, the seasons, sun and rain, day and night. He likes the notion that at night the water in the well is awakened by the moon and starts uttering faint messages\\"Tullio Kezich (2006), Federico Fellini: His Life and Work, Faber and Faber, Inc., 380-81. to those prepared to listen. Unfortunately, few are permitted - let alone prepared - to listen in the infernal uproar of a postmodern world where blaring television commercials and beeping satellites drown out poetry, silence, and the voice of the moon. The consumer society critiqued in the Rome of La Dolce Vita has moved to the suburbs where incommunicability, selfishness, voyeurism, and spiritual poverty characterise the chaos of mass media existence. In his twilight years (three years before he died of a heart attack at the age of 73), Fellini mounts an energetic assault on media moguls like Silvio Berlusconi and the pandemonium of contemporary society by suggesting the escape into silence as a means to heal the psyche, the source of all true wisdom. Production After writing a short treatment in two weeks with Tullio Pinelli, Fellini began scouting locations on the Po in September 1988 where he visited Reggi√≤lo, the hometown of the gifted Italian caricaturist Nino Za, his adolescent idol; the memories evoked reinforced his idea of returning to the provincial atmosphere of his early films.Peter Bondanella (1992), The Cinema of Federico Fellini, Princeton University Press, 328. Although Fellini was still unsure about what he wanted to film, producers Mario and Vittorio Cecchi Gori agreed to finance his project to the tune of fifteen billion lire.Kezich, Fellini: His Life and Work, 383. Pietro Notarianni, the production manager, and Danilo Donati, Oscar-winning Set and Costume Designer, engaged in a heated dispute over costs. Donati quit and was replaced by Dante Ferretti. To help organise his ideas, Fellini decided to build a town outside Rome on the via Pontina near Dinocitt√†, the former film studio of producer Dino De Laurentiis. With Dante Ferretti, he constructed a church, a piazza, apartment blocks, shops, and a hairdresser's boutique, all designed in a parody of styles. Although no genuine script was ever completed, Fellini managed to conceive entire scenes each day by observing his actors improvising on the set, rather like puppets in a doll's house.Federico Fellini, Damian Pettigrew (2003), I'm a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon, New York: Abrams, 65. Principal photography started on 22 February 1989. According to biographer Tullio Kezich, the film \\"will be remembered as one of the most serenely uninhibited of Fellini's sets... At the final dinner in mid-June, the last time that the troupe will convene, Benigni outdoes himself and recites a wonderful poem in ottava rima,Italian stanza form composed of eight 11-syllable lines, rhyming abababcc, with the rhyme on the eighth beat. recounting everything that had happened and been felt over the last months\\". Critical reception Aided by the immense popularity in Italy of comic actors Benigni and Villaggio, the film was a reasonable success with audiences there, receiving enthusiastic reviews from Alberto Moravia, Tullio Kezich, and Aldo Tassone along with a few outright pans.Kezich, Federico Fellini: His Life and Work, 385. Although it did poor business in France, it was acclaimed in Le Monde and Positif, and was featured on the cover of Les Cahiers du Cin√©ma which saw it as a winning diatribe on the excesses of Guy Debord's \\"society of spectacle\\".Thierry Jousse (1990), La voce della luna in Les Cahiers du Cin√©ma, 35. The film screened out of competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, where it was panned or ignored by the majority of North American critics. One critic boasted, \\"Absolutely ravishing. I've never been so bored in my life\\".Reported in Time Magazine, Oct. 1990, 37. See also Kezich, Federico Fellini: His Life and Work, 385-86.

The battle ended the Revolt of Ghent with a Burgundian victory. Background Ghent was the richest, most populous, and powerful city in the Burgundian Netherlands. The battle was a consequence of Ghent's opposition against a new salt tax. When the city openly declared its rebellion, the Duke assembled an army from neighbouring lands, including southern Flanders, and attacked three fortifications; Schendelbeke, Poeke, and Gavere. Schendelbeke and Poeke were both taken with little effort and both garrisons were executed. The Burgundian army began its bombardment of Gavere on 18 July. The Ghentenaar relief army arrived on 23 July, not knowing the fort had fallen the day before. Philip, aware of the approach of the Ghentenaar army, drew up his army into battle lines. Finding Philip's army battle ready, the Ghentenaar army formed up. Battle The battle began with an artillery exchange, a first for the Burgundian army, and due to the superior range of the Ghentenaar artillery, Philip was forced to move his cannons closer to the enemy. Once in range, the Burgundian artillery began to weaken Ghentenaar morale, and numerous Ghentenaar soldiers fled. A Ghentenaar contemporary source claims a spark ignited an open sack of gunpowder causing an explosion which caused the Ghent cannoners to rout. Seeing the enemy flee, the Burgundian army charged. Some Ghent soldiers regrouped to counter the charge, but their efforts were useless and casualties were high. Afterwards It was feared the Duke would destroy the city completely, but when asked to show mercy he is said to have replied \\"If I should destroy this city, who is going to build me one like it?\\" The battle broke the power of Ghent only temporarily, as in 1539 there would be another revolt against the high taxes under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (see Revolt of Ghent (1539)).

It functions as a focal point for undergraduate and graduate students, fellows, and professors and provides assistance with their research. Prior to the establishment of HURI, its founders organized weekly seminars in Ukrainian studies. HURI maintains one of the largest collections of Ukrainian books and other media available in the West, both in its own collection and in those stored in the Harvard Library. HURI also manages the Harvard Ukrainian Summer Institute, which offers summer courses in Ukrainian language, history, literature, and culture, as part of the Harvard Summer School. The institute publishes the Harvard Ukrainian Studies journal‚Äîfounded in 1977‚Äîand a series of book publications, including the Harvard Series in Ukrainian Studies, the Harvard Library of Early Ukrainian Literature, and Harvard Papers in Ukrainian Studies. In the mid-1950s, a group of student activists and members of the Ukrainian-American community sought to preserve Ukraine's unique culture and history, which were suppressed in Soviet Ukraine and unfamiliar to political and intellectual establishments in the West. Under the guidance of Omeljan Pritsak at Harvard, the group's general goal was shaped into a vision for three endowed chairs in Ukrainian studies at a major university, along with a research institute to support and broaden the scholarship. With the assistance of the Ukrainian Studies Fund, the Ukrainian studies program was established with three endowed professorships in the departments of History and Slavic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University, beginning on January 22, 1968, the 50th anniversary of Ukraine's first proclamation of independence.

It was built to test the concept of a CANDU-type reactor that replaced the heavy water coolant with an oil substance. This had a number of potential advantages in terms of cost and efficiency. The 60 MWth reactor was designed and built by Canadian General Electric for a cost of $14.5 million CAD. It achieved criticality on 1 November 1965 and full power in December 1965. An effort to commercialized the design began in 1971 but ended in 1973 when the heavy water cooled units became the standard. From then on WR-1 operated at reduced power limits for irradiation experiments and heating the WNRE site. WR-1 was shut down for the last time in 1985, was defuelled, and is undergoing decommissioning scheduled to be completed in 2023.  Design  =Basic fission= Natural uranium consists of a mix of isotopes, mostly 238U and a much smaller amount of 235U. Both of these isotopes can undergo fission when struck by a neutron of sufficient energy, and as part of this process, they will give off medium- energy neutrons. However, only 235U can undergo fission when struck by neutrons from other uranium atoms, allowing it to maintain a chain reaction. 238U is insensitive to these neutrons and it thus not fissile like 235U. While 235U is sensitive to these neutrons, the reaction rate is greatly improved if the neutrons are slowed from their original relativistic speeds to much lower energies, the so-called thermal neutron velocities. In a mass of pure natural uranium, the number and energy of the neutrons being released through natural decay are too low to cause appreciable fission events in the few 235U atoms present. In order to increase the rate of neutron capture to the point where a chain reaction can occur, known as criticality, the system has to be modified. In most cases, the fuel mass is separated into a large number of smaller fuel pellets and then surrounded by some form of neutron moderator that will slow the neutrons, thereby increasing the chance that the neutrons will cause fission in 235U in other pellets. Often the simplest moderator to use is normal water; when a neutron collides with a water molecule it transfers some of its energy to it, increasing the temperature of the water and slowing the neutron. The main problem with using normal water as a moderator is that it also absorbs some of the neutrons. The neutron balance in the natural isotopic mix is so close that even a small number being absorbed in this fashion means there are too few to maintain criticality. In most reactor designs this is addressed by slightly increasing the amount of 235U relative to 238U, a process known as enrichment. The resulting fuel typically contains between 3 and 5% 235U, up from the natural value of just under 1%. The leftover material, now containing almost no 235U and consisting of almost pure 238U, is known as depleted uranium. =Conventional CANDU= The CANDU design addresses the moderation problem by replacing the normal water with heavy water. Heavy water already has an extra neutron, so the chance that a fission neutron will be absorbed during moderation is largely eliminated. Additionally, it is subject to other reactions that further increase the number of neutrons released during operation. The neutron economy is improved to the point where even unenriched natural uranium will maintain criticality, which greatly reduces the complexity and cost of fueling the reactor, and also allows it to use a number of alternative fuel cycles that mix in even less reactive elements. The downside to this approach is that the 235U atoms in the fuel are spread out through a larger fuel mass, which makes the reactor core larger for any given power level. This can lead to higher capital costs for building the reactor core. To address the cost issue, CANDU uses a unique reactor core layout. Conventional reactor designs consist of a large metal cylinder containing the fuel and moderating water, which is run under high pressure in order to increase the boiling point of the water so that it removes heat more efficiently. At the time CANDU was being designed, Canada lacked the facilities to make such large pressure vessels, especially ones large enough to run on natural uranium. The solution was to enclose the pressurized heavy water within smaller tubes and then insert these into a much larger low- pressure vessel known as the calandria. One major advantage of this layout is that the fuel can be removed from the individual tubes which allow the design to be refueled while operating, while conventional designs require the entire reactor core to be shut down. A small disadvantage is that tubes absorb some neutrons as well, but not nearly enough to offset the improved neutron economy of the heavy water design. =Organic coolant= A significant problem with using any sort of water as a coolant is that the water tends to dissolve the fuel and other components and ends up becoming highly radioactive. This is mitigated by using particular alloys for the tubes and processing the fuel into a ceramic form. While effective at reducing the rate of dissolution, this adds to the cost of processing the fuel while also requiring materials that are susceptible to neutron embrittlement. More of an issue is the fact that water has a low boiling point, limiting the operating temperatures. A material with a higher boiling point can be run at higher temperatures, increasing the efficiency of the power extraction and allowing the core to be smaller. This was the basic premise of the organic nuclear reactor design. In the CANDU layout, the moderator and coolant both used heavy water, but there was no reason for this other than expediency. Since the bulk of the moderation occurred in the calandria mass, replacing the small amount in the fuel tubes with some other coolant was straightforward, unlike conventional light water designs where some other moderator would have to be added. Using oil meant the issues with corrosion were greatly reduced, allowing more conventional metals to be used while also reducing the amount of dissolved fuel, and in turn, radiation in the cooling system. The organic liquid that was selected, OS-84, is a mixture of terphenyls treated catalytically with hydrogen to produce 40 percent saturated hydrocarbons. The terphenyls are petrochemical derivatives that were readily available and were already in use as heat transfer media. Additionally, by using a material with a higher boiling point, the reactor could be operated at higher temperatures. This not only reduced the amount of coolant needed to remove a given amount of energy, and thereby reduced the physical size of the core, but also increases the efficiency of the turbines used to extract this energy for electrical generation. WR-1 ran with outlet temperatures up to 425 ¬∞C, compared to about 310 ¬∞C in the conventional CANDU. This also meant that there is no need to pressurize the cooling fluid beyond what is needed to force it through the cooling tubes at the required rate. This allowed the fuel tubes to be made thinner, reducing the number of neutrons lost in interactions with the tubing, and further increasing the neutron economy. The reactor had vertical fuel channels, in contrast with the normal CANDU arrangement where the tubes are horizontal. The reactor did not use conventional control rods, but relied on control of the level of the heavy water moderator to adjust the power output. The reactor could be shut down quickly (SCRAMed) by the rapid dumping of the moderator. In 1971 AECL initiated design engineering of a 500 MWe CANDU-OCR, based on uranium carbide fuel. Carbide fuels would corrode in water, but in the oil-cooled version, this was not an issue. Carbide fuels were much easier to produce than the more complex ceramics being used in most reactor designs. This design effort was shut down in 1973, but WR-1 tested the concept anyway. Another possibility was to use metallic fuel, which would increase the density of the fuel and offer higher burnup. The metallic fuel conducts heat better so that a higher power core could be used in the same space.  Accidents  In November 1978 there was a major loss-of-coolant accident. 2,739 liters of coolant oil leaked, most of it into the Winnipeg River. The repair took several weeks for workers to complete. There was another leak in 1980 of 680 liters.\\"Nuclear leak into river Negligible \\" Winnipeg Free Press. Ritchie Gage July 30, 1981  Status  WR1 was shut down for the last time for economic reasons, on May 17, 1985 although it was the youngest of AECL's large research reactors. The reactor is in an interim decommissioning stage, defuelled and largely disassembled. The site will be returned to greenfield status at the end of decommissioning.

History RL was founded in 2005 by a split from the Italian Radicals of those radicals that were opposed to the formation of the Rose in the Fist alliance together with the Italian Democratic Socialists, as a component of the wider centre-left The Union, and instead supported an alliance with the centre-right House of Freedoms. The party united former Radicals, as many former members of the Italian Liberal Party and of Forza Italia. After 2006 general election (in which Della Vedova was elected MP on Forza Italia's list), the explicit aim of the grouping is to unite the Italian centre-right into a single party and to strengthen liberal and secular positions in it. Liberal Reformers acted both as a faction of Forza Italia both as a unifying agent of centre-right liberals. In October 2006, Liberal Reformers launched a manifesto called \\"Give a libertarian soul to the centre- right\\" together with famous journalists (Vittorio Feltri, Arturo Diaconale, Filippo Facci and Giordano Bruno Guerri), academics and politicians from both Forza Italia and National Alliance.Manifesto \\"Give a libertarian soul to the centre-right\\" On 1 November Della Vedova called on the Italian Radicals to join the centre-right in the next general election.Open letter from Benedetto Della Vedova to the Italian RadicalsStatement of Benedetto Della Vedova on the Italian Radicals' congress Some days earlier, Della Vedova had wished that he, Marco Pannella, Emma Bonino and Daniele Capezzone will found themselves together again in the centre-right.Interview with Benedetto Della Vedova on political alliances On 7 November, when Capezzone finally left the Radicals and the centre-left, Della Vedova opened the doors of Forza Italia and the centre-right for him.Appeal of Benedetto Della Vedova to Daniele Capezzone In the 2008 general election RL were part of the list of The People of Freedom (PdL) and had two deputies elected: Benedetto Della Vedova and Giuseppe Calderisi. Soon after the election, Daniele Capezzone, who had previously joined the centre-right, was appointed by Berlusconi as spokesman of Forza Italia. In 2009 the party was merged into the PdL and its members, led by Della Vedova, formed a new association named Libertiamo. The party was merged in 2009 into The People of Freedom. Within the new party Della Vedova distanced from his mentor Silvio Berlusconi and got very close to Gianfranco Fini and Generation Italy instead. In July 2010, Della Vedova left the PdL to become a member of Fini's new party Future and Freedom. Ideology Liberal Reformers had a libertarian platform, including a strong support for free market, privatization, deregulation, lower taxes, and competition in the health care and education systems. They also proposed an American-styled reform of Italian political system (their slogan was \\"America, Market, Individual\\"), including presidentialism, competitive federalism, and a first- past-the-post plurality voting system. Despite being a small party, the RI were also keen supporters of a two-party system. In foreign policy they were staunchly pro-American and very supportive of human rights all over the world. Internationally Liberal Reformers, along with the Italian Radicals, were members of the Transnational Radical Party, a NGO working at the United Nations level. The party had a socially progressive stance on abortion and stem cell research, despite not stressing too much the point. The party supported also civil unions for homosexual couples, but, differently from other liberal parties, opposed civil unions for opposite-sex couples and same- sex marriage. Della Vedova explained this position by arguing that there is no need of regulation for free cohabitation of opposite-sex couples and, instead, he proposed swift procedures for divorce, which are very lengthy in Italy. Liberal Reformers were very keen on the return of Italy to the use of nuclear energy (which was prohibited by a referendum proposed by the Radical Party in 1987) and were also the party of the centre-right to be more involved in green politics, by contesting the hegemony of left-wing politics on these issues, and proposed a new liberal-green parth for the centre-right.

By discharge, it is the fourth river of the Iberian peninsula, after the Douro, Ebro and Tagus. The Minho waters vineyards and farmland, is used to produce hydroelectric power, and also delineates a section of the Spanish‚ÄìPortuguese border. In ancient English maps, it appears as Minno. The source of the Minho lies north of Lugo in Galicia, in a place called Pedregal de Irimia. After about , the river passes just south of the walls of this old Roman city, discharging in average 42 m3/s, and flows south through canyons until the valley widens north of Ourense. The river has been harnessed in reservoirs from Portomar√≠n to Frieira. Along its length, it has the following reservoirs: Belesar with , Peares with , Velle with , Castrelo with and Frieira with . About north of Ourense at Os Peares, the Minho, with a discharge of 102 m3/s, receives the waters of its main tributary, the Sil, with 184 m3/s. Passing Ourense, there is one major dam at Frieira near the town of Ribadavia, which is famous for its Ribeiro DOP wine (called after the name of the region). There the Minho averages 316 m3/s of discharge. Later on, the river flows in a southwest direction until reaching the Portuguese border near Melga√ßo. After through Galicia, the Minho sets the border to Portugal for about other , mainly towards the west. The valley is a lush, green agricultural area where the land is used to produce corn, potatoes, cabbage, even kiwi fruit, or just grass, depending on the time of year, and everywhere edging the fields, rivers and gardens, wherever there is space, the vines which produce the light, slightly sparkling ‚ÄúVinho Verde‚Äù and the Ribeiro wine, both peculiar to this area. The very best of these wines, Alvarinho in Portuguese or Albari√±o in Spanish and Galician, is produced in the area around Mon√ß√£o, Arbo and Melga√ßo. Passing the medieval towns of Melga√ßo and Mon√ß√£o, the Minho divides the Spanish Tui and Portuguese Valen√ßa do Minho, towns that guarded an important bridge for road and rail. Both towns preserve fortifications and are national monuments. The Minho reaches the Atlantic between the Galician A Guarda and the Portuguese Caminha, with an average discharge of 420 m3/s. Geography Pedregal de Irimia The river begins in the Pedregal de Irimia of the Sierra de Meira, about above sea level, in the municipality of Meira, northeast of the province of Lugo, where it flows through the town of Meira reaching the lagoon Fonmi√±√° (in the municipality of A Pastoriza). This lagoon is located in the same province. Although wrong, is historically considered as its birthplace. The Minho flows through the Galician massif and Cantabrian Mountain range and the mountains of Leon, two of the rainiest areas of the Iberian Peninsula, being one of the main rivers of the Atlantic slope. All its upper course has been declared a Biosphere Reserve. The Minho River runs its first across the plateau of Lugo (Terrach√°), a peneplain whose elevation ranges from above the sea level. Its main tributaries are the Sil, Neira, Avia, Barbanti√±o, B√∫bal, Arnoya rivers. The mouth of the Minho  Etymology  According to E.

In his general approach to philosophy, Thagard is sharply critical of analytic philosophy for being overly dependent upon intuitions as a source of evidence.Paul Thagard, \\"Eleven Dogmas of Analytic Philosophy\\", 4 December 2012.  Biography  Thagard was born in Yorkton, Saskatchewan on September 28, 1950. He is a graduate of the Universities of Saskatchewan (B.A. in philosophy, 1971), Cambridge (M.A. in philosophy, 1973), Toronto (Ph.D. in philosophy, 1977) and Michigan (M.S. in computer science, 1985). He was Chair of the Governing Board of the Cognitive Science Society , 1998‚Äì1999, and President of the Society for Machines and Mentality , 1997‚Äì1998. In 2013 he won a Canada Council Killam Prize, and in 1999 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2003, he received a University of Waterloo Award for Excellence in Research, and in 2005 he was named a University Research Chair. Thagard was married to the psychologist Ziva Kunda. Kunda died in 2004. Philosophical work =Explanatory coherence= Thagard has proposed that many cognitive functions, including perception, analogy, explanation, decision-making, planning etc., can be understood as a form of (maximum) coherence computation. Thagard (together with Karsten Verbeurgt) put forth a particular formalization of the concept of coherence as a constraint satisfaction problem.Many of Thagard's coherence articles are available online at http://cogsci.uwaterloo.ca/Articles/Pages/Coherence.htmlThagard, P. and Verbeurgt, K. (1998). Coherence as constraint satisfaction. Cognitive Science, 22: 1-24. The model posits that coherence operates over a set of representational elements (e.g., propositions, images, etc.) which can either fit together (cohere) or resist fitting together (incohere). If two elements p and q cohere they are connected by a positive constraint (p,q) \\\\in C^+, and if two elements p and q incohere they are connected by a negative constraint (p,q) \\\\in C^-. Furthermore, constraints are weighted, i.e., for each constraint (p,q) \\\\in C^+ \\\\cup C^- there is a positive weight w(p,q). According to Thagard, coherence maximization involves the partitioning of elements into accepted (A) and rejected (R) elements in such a way that maximum number (or maximum weight) of constraints is satisfied. Here a positive constraint (p, q) is said to be satisfied if either both p and q are accepted (p, q \\\\in A) or both p and q are rejected (p, q \\\\in R). A negative constraint (p,q) is satisfied if one element is accepted (say p \\\\in A), and the other rejected (q \\\\in R). =Philosophy of science= There has been some decrease in interest in the demarcation problem in recent years. Part of the problem is that many suspect that it is an intractable problem, since so many previous attempts have come up short. For example, many obvious examples of pseudoscience have been shown to be falsifiable, or verifiable, or revisable. Therefore, many of the previously proposed demarcation criteria have not been judged as particularly reliable. Thagard has proposed another set of principles to try to overcome these difficulties. According to Thagard's method, a theory is not scientific if:  Major works  Thagard is the author/co-author of 13 books and over 200 articles. *Brain-Mind: From Neurons to Consciousness and Creativity.

It opened in 1995 to replace a structure of historic significance. The original Pratt/Bowstring/Pennsylvania through truss spans, designed by Theodore Cooper, were formerly the (third) Sixth Street Bridge, spanning the Allegheny River, in downtown Pittsburgh, and were built in 1892 by the Union Bridge Company. They were floated downstream by the Foundation Company in 1927 rather than being demolished when the bridge was removed to enable construction of the present (fourth) Three Sisters (Pittsburgh) Sixth Street Self-anchored suspension bridge. However, by the late 1980s, the old bridge could no longer support traffic volumes and was replaced by a newer structure. The Sixth Street bridges Note: Material from this section is adopted from the HAER report on this bridge. The through truss spans incorporated in the present Coraopolis Bridge were originally erected across the Allegheny River at Sixth Street in Pittsburgh, linking Pittsburgh with the main business thoroughfare of neighboring Allegheny City. This was the third of four bridges to serve that location, which is considered among Pittsburgh's most important river crossings. The growth of Pittsburgh was strongly influenced by its numerous waterways, and the successful linking of the city with its neighboring communities by means of bridges was a significant factor in the development of its metropolitan identity. Allegheny City was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907, becoming the city's \\"North Side\\". =First Sixth Street Bridge= The first bridge to cross the Allegheny at Sixth Street was a six- span, flat-roofed, covered wooden bridge constructed in 1819. This bridge had a total length of , consisting of four spans, a span, and a span. The design and construction of this bridge have traditionally been attributed to a Mr. Lothrop; it was presumably a Burr arch truss, like the Ninth (Hand) Street Bridge, another of Lothrop's products. Physical evidence for this assumption survived until the 1890s, when an observer reported that the skewbacks from the wooden arches remained visible in the north abutment. =Second Sixth Street Bridge= In 1860, a wire-suspension bridge, designed by John A. Roebling, replaced the decaying timber structure. This bridge was four spans long, with two main spans, and approach spans measuring each. The bridge was dominated by cast iron towers, each formed by four cast iron columns. Although the Roebling bridge, with its iron superstructure, was generally believed non- flammable, it fell victim to fire on June 19, 1881. The bridge was not destroyed, but its floor system of white pine and white oak was severely damaged. John Harper, president of the Allegheny Bridge Company, which owned and operated the structure, stated that he believed the fire was the result of \\"sparks and perhaps flame from the stacks\\" of passing steamboats igniting bird nests located under the superstructure of the bridge. After heavy electric streetcars were introduced to the bridge in 1890, concern over its functional capacity grew, and in 1891 plans were begun to replace the suspension bridge with one that could better handle the steadily increasing traffic, as well as permit trolleys to cross without reducing their speed. =Third Sixth Street Bridge= Coraopolis Bridge, from below deck, showing deck girders, eyebar tension members, lattice girders of truss superstructure The third Sixth Street Bridge was designed by the nationally significant engineer Theodore Cooper (1839‚Äì1919). This bridge has been identified as the last surviving structure entirely designed by Cooper, whose involvement extended even to such details as the bridge's handrail, lamps, and fascia. The third Sixth Street Bridge, like most roadway river bridges in the 19th century, was privately built and operated as a toll crossing. The total cost of construction was $560,000. This cost was underwritten by the Sixth Street Bridge Company and Fidelity Title and Trust Company, successors to the Allegheny Bridge Company, which had received its charter in 1810. When the bridge was opened in 1893, the toll was set at two cents for each man, while women crossed at no charge. Beginning in the late 1890s, Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh undertook a systematic program of acquiring the privately owned bridges within their jurisdiction and eliminating their tolls. The Sixth Street Bridge was purchased by Allegheny County in 1911 along with nine other bridges at the combined price of $2,851,000; all ten of these bridges were subsequently declared free. The trusses for the third Sixth Street Bridge were fabricated by the Union Bridge Company. This company had been formed in 1884 by the merging of the Central Bridge Company of Buffalo, New York, and Kellogg and Maurice of Athens, Pennsylvania. The Buffalo plant was closed around 1890, so presumably the trusses were produced in the shops which remained at Athens. Coraopolis Bridge with newer pony truss at left, from SE (Coraopolis side) The superstructure was erected by the Baird Brothers, John and William, who first advertised in the Pittsburgh and Allegheny City Directory in 1886 as contractors located at Home and Valley Streets. In the 1891 and 1892 editions of the Directory they were listed as bridge builders; their listings no longer appeared by 1900, and by 1911 William Baird had left the construction business and had begun managing a hotel. The Baird Brothers had been involved with numerous bridge projects and companies in the late nineteenth century. William Baird had worked on seven bridges crossing the Missouri River, the Merchants Bridge across the Mississippi River at St. Louis, two bridges crossing the Ohio River at Wheeling, West Virginia, the bridge carrying the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad across the Susquehanna River, and bridges at Steubenville, Ohio, and Poughkeepsie, New York. John Baird had also been involved in the construction of the Eads Bridge in St. Louis and the Cairo bridge in Memphis, and had been employed by the McCann Construction Company, the Keystone Bridge Company and American Bridge Company. This bridge was also outgrown. While the Pittsburgh City Council and the Municipal Affairs Committee of the Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce argued for the retention and upgrading of the existing bridges, the issue was ultimately decided by the Department of War, acting under the authority of Section 18 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1890 (30 Stat., 1121‚Äì1153). This act empowered the Secretary of War to require the removal or alteration of any bridge which \\" ... is an unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation . . . on account of insufficient height, width of span, or otherwise\\". So, unfortunately, the War Department decreed that the numerous bridges over the Allegheny with their differing spacing of piers, main spans, and generally low clearances, were an impediment to navigation, and decreed that all bridges would have to be replaced. Although the decree was discussed in the early 1900s, and first issued in 1917, serious work did not begin till 1924. As part of the Three Sisters (Pittsburgh) project, the bridges at Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Streets were to be demolished and replaced. The other two bridges were destroyed and scrapped, but the Cooper Bowstring trusses were moved to Coraopolis and reused. Moving the Sixth Street Bridge to Coraopolis Note: The material in this section is taken from a different HAER report. The 1892 Sixth Street Bridge (as described above, a pair of camelback Pratt trusses and the third bridge built in this location) had a second chance. In 1927, it was lowered from its piers, the top chords partially disassembled. The structure was floated downriver to a new location over the Ohio River back channel between Coraopolis and Neville Island to make way for the current Sixth Street Bridge structure. =A forced opportunity= The Cooper spans remained in good shape, and concerns for economizing in public works projects led to recycling of the 1892 bridge. Commissioner Armstrong took credit for proposing to reuse the Cooper bridge instead of building an entirely new structure in nearby Coraopolis, saving Allegheny County $350,000. The Foundation Company bid on a contract to move the Sixth Street Bridge from its site in downtown Pittsburgh to Coraopolis, twelve miles away. Winning the contract at a bid of $316,200, the company also assumed any risk that the spans would sink or be damaged during the project. The company allowed pedestrians to cross the structure while roadway removal proceeded in the fall of 1926 in order to reduce the inconvenience for residents. Workers took off half of the roadway at a time, leaving pedestrian areas accessible until final segments were taken away Coraopolis Bridge with newer pony trusses in background, filigree work and decorative mesh of arched openings in foreground. Built up compression girder members at side, and tierod bracing also visible at top of arch =Removal process= The bowstring trusses, in addition to weighing 1,600 tons each, presented the difficult problem of being slightly too tall to fit under two bridges along the journey. Because of the stresses inherent in a bowstring truss, the Foundation Company could not merely disassemble them; instead, the firm had to transport the entire spans, which were wide and high. Each truss consisted of sixteen eye- bar panels pinned together. Removing one part would break the structure's rigidity and make moving it very difficult. Instead of shifting the spans off piers for lowering or pivoting them from their present support, the Foundation Company lowered the structure in position, taking off the masonry and using substitute supports for resting the structure without getting in the way of the process. The contractor attached a frame to each of the piers and abutments, used straps to bind the trusses to each frame, and lowered them using the straps. With twenty-six holes punched in the strap, the company used a matching chain to counter the eight straps. Using pins to move the strap by hole sets, the company brought the spans downward at a time with jacks. The pins attached to the plungers of eight 500-ton jacks. The jacks remained in place while the pins moved . The water-cylinder jacks were also high, capable of exerting after pumping. By bleeding water out of the cylinders of the jacks all at once, workers used the four jacks on each side of the bridge to lower the spans on alternate sides to the full depth of . =Transport= Workers made a pontoon out of two pairs of barges, spaced to create a platform long and wide, which carried the bridge with of overhang. Stringers supported the bridge in forty-two places, with a 40-ton screw jack at each stringer for easier loading and unloading. When workers reached the Manchester Bridge, they had to adjust the bridge to fit the clearance, which was and less than the bridge's height. After supporting the bridge under the floor beams, they disassembled the top chord and stabilized each panel point on the trusses. Steering the bridge under the Manchester Bridge and the railroad bridge at Brunot's Island, the tugboat captains went through the Ohio River lock and up the back channel toward Coraopolis, where piers and abutments had been constructed. =Reassembly= Reversing the process and using the same jacks and steel frames to raise the structure , the company erected the Cooper bridge 30 days after the project began. The Farris Engineering Company, a Pittsburgh company located in the Empire Building, performed a great deal of work on the bridge at its new location. The original approved contract for their work had a price total of $271,811.50. They built portions of the substructure that the Foundation Company had not done. Farris also erected the two pony truss approach spans, repaired and painted the main superstructure, and paved the bridge deck and the two approaches. The approach spans, and the end bearings for the main spans, were fabricated by the American Bridge Company at its shops located in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. End of life Allegheny County ended up replacing the Coraopolis Bridge with a new bridge at this location. By the 1980s, due to its deteriorated condition and inadequate load carrying capacity, the four span truss bridge did not meet the transportation needs of its location. After nearly 50 years of additional service, which included weight restrictions and closings during cold weather (for a time it was restricted to carrying vehicles with a maximum weight of three tons, and it was only open to vehicular traffic during periods when the temperature is above 30 degrees Fahrenheit), the old bridge was replaced by a deck girder bridge which was completed in 1995. Thus, eventually it was closed, demolished, and replaced, ending a unique chapter in American bridge history. Current bridge at location The current Coraopolis-Neville Island Bridge at this location (OB02) was built in 1994 and completed in 1995. This steel deck girder bridge spans the back channel of the Ohio River between Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, and Neville Township, Pennsylvania. The main span is approximately , and the height of the deck is approximately .http://pghbridges.com/ambridge/0571-4485/nevillecora1995.htm See also *List of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Pennsylvania *Three Sisters Bridges Notes # The town Coraopolis (and therefore the bridge) are sometimes referred to as Corapolis, that is, missing the 'O' between the 'A' and 'P', which can make searches somewhat difficult. For example, the HAER material is indexed this way although the HAER article text uses the spelling with the 'O'. # The trusses are conflictingly referred to in different sources as \\"Bowstring\\", \\"Pennsylvania\\" or \\"Pratt\\". Pratt is the most common name. Bowstring may refer to the shape of the bridge, it has some resemblance to a bow, with the roadway as the string (in this particular truss design instance, the members at the road level are eyebar, as can be seen in the belowdeck illustration, above, and thus are in tension only, which also may be why it's named that way) This tension only, pin joint construction is the major factor making the move difficult. # The HAER (Historic American Engineering Record) report gives an extensive history of the various bridges at the 6th street site, and of this bridge once moved.

He received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1952. Jorge Luis Borges attributes the discovery of a \\"paradoxical list of animals\\" to Kuhn. The list has become the subject of much modern commentary after it was cited by Foucault. However, Borges's attribution is the only known evidence that either such a work existed or that Kuhn discussed it . (it is, actually, a fictional attribution; see Otras Inquisiciones). Franz Kuhn is not to be confused with Franz Felix Adalbert Kuhn.

The pair are twins, born in Hong Kong in 1965. Among their films is the hit Asian horror film, The Eye, which has spawned two sequels, as well as a Hollywood version also titled The Eye and a Hindi film called Naina. Besides working in Hong Kong, the pair frequently work in the Thai film industry, where they made their directorial debut as a team, Bangkok Dangerous.  Early life  The Pang brothers grew up at Ka Wai Chuen in Hung Hom when they were young and studied at Kiangsu- Chekiang College (Shatin). The elder brother, Oxide, graduated from New Method College later.  Early career  Oxide, the older of the two by 15 minutes, started his career in Bangkok, at Kantana Group's film labs as a telecine colorist.Ho, Karl. 9 August 2002. \\"Seeing dead people\\", Straits Times/Asia News Network via Nation Weekend, page 8 (print edition). He made his first film, the experimental karmic thriller, Who Is Running?, in 1997. It was Thailand's entry for Academy Award for the Best Foreign Film for the 71st Academy Awards in 1998. Danny is well known as a film editor, and has worked on a number of Hong Kong films, including The Storm Riders and the Infernal Affairs series. They first teamed up to write and direct the Thai film, Bangkok Dangerous, in 1999. The film won the FIPRESCI Award at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival and was nominated for best film and best editing at the Thailand National Film Association Awards. They then made The Eye, which gained the Pangs wider critical acclaim. They made two sequels, The Eye 2 and The Eye 10. An American remake of The Eye was produced by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner and stars Jessica Alba. Aside from The Eye and other horror films, the Pangs made two more edgy Thai crime films in the same vein as Bangkok Dangerous, Danny with 1+1=0 and Oxide with Som and Bank: Bangkok for Sale. Together the three crime films form a loose \\"Bangkok Trilogy\\".  Working style  When the Pangs work together, they direct scenes in the film independently of each other. Oxide Pang explains:  Other films  Their 2006 horror film, Re-cycle, was the closing film in the Un Certain Regard competition at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. The film reunited the brothers with Angelica Lee, the star of The Eye. Among their other projects are a Hollywood-backed, English-language film, a thriller called The Messengers, starring John Corbett, which was released in theatres on 2 February 2006, and a remake of Bangkok Dangerous starring Nicolas Cage. Oxide produced a remake of Who Is Running? in 2005, called The Remaker, with Mona Nahm directing. He has completed a solo project, Diary, released in 2006. Another solo project for Oxide is The Detective, starring Aaron Kwok, about a detective trying to find a woman, with the only clue being a photograph of her.Oxide Pang's The Photo becomes The Detective becomes C+ Detective, gets trailer , Twitchfilm.net, retrieved on 18 September 2007 Danny also completed a solo project, Forest of Death, a thriller about an enchanted forest.

A lieutenant-general is a general officer, the equivalent of a Naval flag officer. A lieutenant-general is senior to a major general or rear-admiral, and junior to a general or admiral. Prior to 1968, Canadian Air Force officers held the equivalent rank of air marshal, which was abolished with the unification of the Canadian Forces. Insignia The rank insignia for a lieutenant-general in the Royal Canadian Air Force is a wide braid below two narrow braid on the cuff, as well as three silver maple leaves, beneath crossed sword and baton, all surmounted by St. Edward's Crown, worn on the shoulder straps of the Service Dress tunic. In the Canadian Army, the rank insignia is a wide braid on the cuff, as well as three gold maple leaves, beneath crossed sword and baton, all surmounted by St. Edward's Crown, worn on the shoulder straps of the Service Dress tunic. The rank is also worn on slip- ons on other uniforms. On the visor of the service cap are two rows of gold oak leaves.

In French, subordinates thereafter use the expression \\"mon g√©n√©ral\\". Lieutenant-generals are normally entitled to staff cars. Appointments A lieutenant-general generally holds only the most senior command or administrative appointments, barring only Chief of the Defence Staff, which is held by a full admiral or general. Appointments held by lieutenant-generals may include Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS); Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (DCDS); Commander of the Canadian Army and Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force. In November 2009, Prince Charles became an honorary lieutenant-general of the Canadian Forces Land and Air Command. In June 2015, Second World War Veteran Richard Rohmer was promoted to the rank of honorary lieutenant-general in his capacity as honorary advisor to the Chief of the Defence Staff.http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=992829 See also *Canadian Forces ranks and insignia References Military of Canada Military ranks of Canada Military insignia ","title":"Lieutenant-general (Canada)"},{"id":"3820086","text":"Hit is a carbonated soft drink introduced in Venezuela over 40 years ago.

It is the equivalent of a multinational three-star rank; some British lieutenant generals sometimes wear three-star insignia, in addition to their standard insignia, when on multinational operations. Lieutenant general is a superior rank to major general, but subordinate to a (full) general. The rank has a NATO rank code of OF-8, equivalent to a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and an air marshal in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the air forces of many Commonwealth countries. The rank insignia for both the Army and the Royal Marines is a crown over a crossed sabre and baton. Since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the St Edward's Crown, commonly known as the Queen's Crown, has been depicted. Prior to 1953, the Tudor Crown, commonly known as the King's Crown, was used. British Army usage Ordinarily, lieutenant general is the rank held by the officer in command of an entire battlefield corps. The General Officer Commanding NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps is a British lieutenant general. Historically, I Corps and II Corps were commanded by British lieutenant generals. Additionally, three lieutenant general appointments also exist within the extant British Army's Headquarters. They are the Commander Field Army, the Commander Home Command and the Chief of Materiel (Land) in Defence Equipment and Support (double-hatted as the Quartermaster-General to the Forces). Royal Marines usage Although the senior appointment in the Royal Marines, the Commandant General, has since 1996 held the lower rank of major general, prior to this date the Commandant General was a lieutenant general or full general. However, given that a few more senior positions in the British Armed Forces are open to officers from different services, Royal Marines officers can and do reach the rank of lieutenant general, being posted to Joint Forces or Ministry of Defence postings. Examples include Lieutenant- General Sir Robert Fry, Lieutenant-General Sir James Dutton and Lieutenant- General Sir David Capewell. Royal Air Force usage From 1 April 1918 to 31 July 1919, the Royal Air Force maintained the rank of lieutenant general. It was superseded by the rank of air marshal on the following day. Although Sir David Henderson was an RAF lieutenant general, the then RAF Chief-of-Staff Sir Hugh Trenchard never held this rank. Additionally, the retired Royal Navy admiral John de Mestre Hutchison held an honorary RAF commission in the rank of lieutenant general. The RAF lieutenant general rank insignia was similar to the naval rank insignia for a vice-admiral, with a broad band of gold being worn on the cuff with two narrower bands above it. Unlike the naval insignia, the RAF lieutenant general insignia did not have an executive curl.

A lieutenant general ranks above a major general and below a general. The pay grade of lieutenant general is O-9. It is equivalent to the rank of vice admiral in the other United States uniformed services which use naval ranks. It is abbreviated as LTG in the Army, LtGen in the Marine Corps, and Lt Gen in the Air Force and Space Force. Statutory limits U.S. Army ASU insignia of the rank of lieutenant general.

Style and method of wear may vary between the services. The United States Code explicitly limits the total number of generals that may be concurrently active to 231 for the Army, 62 for the Marine Corps, and 198 for the Air Force.10 USC ¬ß 526. Authorized strength: general and flag officers on active duty For the Army and Air Force, no more than about 25% of the service's active duty general officers may have more than two stars. 10 USC 525. Distribution of commissioned officers on active duty in general officer and flag officer grades. Some of these slots can be reserved by statute. Officers serving in certain intelligence positions are not counted against either limit, including the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. 10 USC 528. Officers serving in certain intelligence positions: military status; exclusion from distribution and strength limitations; pay and allowances. The President may also add three-star slots to one service if they are offset by removing an equivalent number from other services. Finally, all statutory limits may be waived at the president's discretion during time of war or national emergency. 10 USC 527. Authority to suspend sections 523, 525, and 526. Appointment and tour length The three- star grade goes hand-in-hand with the position of office to which it is linked, so the rank is temporary. Officers may only achieve three-star grade if they are appointed to positions that require the officer to hold such a rank. 10 USC 601. Positions of importance and responsibility: generals and lieutenant generals; admirals and vice admirals. Their rank expires with the expiration of their term of office, which is usually set by statute. Lieutenant generals are nominated for appointment by the president from any eligible officers holding the rank of brigadier general or above, who also meet the requirements for the position, with the advice of the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The nominee must be confirmed via majority vote by the Senate before the appointee can take office and thus assume the rank. The standard tour length for most lieutenant general positions is three years but some are set four or more years by statute. Extensions of the standard tour length can be approved, within statutory limits, by their respective service secretaries, the Secretary of Defense, the president, or Congress but these are rare, as they block other officers from being promoted. Some statutory limits under the U.S. Code can be waived in times of national emergency or war. Three-star ranks may also be given by an act of Congress but this is extremely rare. Retirement Other than voluntary retirement, the statute sets a number of mandates for retirement. Lieutenant generals must retire after 38 years of service unless appointed for promotion or reappointed to grade to serve longer.10 USC 636. Retirement for years of service: regular officers in grades above brigadier general and rear admiral (lower half). Otherwise, all general officers must retire the month after their 64th birthday.10 USC 1253. Age 64: regular commissioned officers in general and flag officer grades; exception. However, the Secretary of Defense can defer a three-star officer's retirement until the officer's 66th birthday and the president can defer it until the officer's 68th birthday. General officers typically retire well in advance of the statutory age and service limits, so as not to impede the upward career mobility of their juniors. Since there is a finite number of three-star slots available to each service, typically one officer must leave office before another can be promoted. DoD News Briefing on Thursday, June 6, 1996. Retirement of Admiral Leighton W. Smith Jr. Maintaining a three-star rank is a game of musical chairs; once an officer vacates a position bearing that rank, they have 60 days to be appointed or reappointed to a position of equal or higher importance or involuntarily retire. Historically, officers leaving three-star positions were allowed to revert to their permanent two-star ranks to mark time in lesser jobs until statutory retirement, but now such officers are expected to retire immediately to avoid obstructing the promotion flow. History Modern use An Army or Marine Corps lieutenant general typically commands a corps-sized unit (20,000 to 45,000 soldiers for an Army Corps and a similar number of Marines for a Marine Expeditionary Force), while an Air Force lieutenant general commands a large Numbered Air Force consisting of several wings or a smaller USAF Major Command (MAJCOM) such as the Air Force Special Operations Command or the Air Force Reserve Command. Additionally, lieutenant generals of all services serve as high-level staff officers at various major command headquarters and The Pentagon, often as the heads of their departments. In 2014 five women were serving as lieutenant generals in the US Army.Army finance officer attains historic third star (2014-08-13) After the close of the Second World War, generals were normally promoted permanently to brigadier general and major general, with temporary promotions to lieutenant general and general to fill senior positions as needed. In theory, a general vacates their three or four-star rank at the termination of their assignment unless placed in an equal ranking billet. Douglas MacArthur, who served as a four-star general and Army Chief of Staff, reverted to two stars after his CoS tour ended but chose to stay on active duty in the United States Army. The practice of using lieutenant general and general grades as a temporary rank continues, with the President and the Department of Defense creating temporary or indefinite three- and four-star assignments, with a fixed term of office, with the approval of the Senate. Even with the temporary status, such officers are also almost always granted permanent retirement in the last grade they held with the satisfactory completion of at least two or three years in grade.

Life and career Born in Krak√≥w (then in the Grand Duchy of Krakow, Austro- Hungarian Empire, now in Poland) into a Jewish family, Mat√© began in the film business after his graduation from the University of Budapest. He worked as an assistant cameraman in Hungary and later throughout Europe, sometimes with colleague Karl Freund. Mat√© worked on several of Carl Th. Dreyer's films, including The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) and Vampyr (1932). He worked as cinematographer on Hollywood films from the mid-1930s, including Dodsworth (1936), the Laurel and Hardy feature Our Relations (1936) and Stella Dallas (1937). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in five consecutive years, for Alfred Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent (1940), Alexander Korda's That Hamilton Woman (1941), Sam Wood's The Pride of the Yankees (1942), Zoltan Korda's Sahara (1943), and Charles Vidor's Cover Girl (1944). In 1947, he turned to directing films; his credits include the film noir D.O.A. (1949), No Sad Songs for Me (1950), When Worlds Collide (1951), and the epic The 300 Spartans (1962). Some sixteen months after completing his last film, a low budget, limited-release comedy shot in Greece and scored by Manos Hatzidakis, Mat√© suffered a heart attack while in Hollywood and died on 27 October 1964, at the age of 66.

It is situated in the region bordering the Constantinois and Petite Kabylie (Basse Kabylie). In 1982, Dj√©mila became a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique adaptation of Roman architecture to a mountain environment. Significant buildings in ancient Cuicul include a theatre, two fora, temples, basilicas, arches, streets, and houses. The exceptionally well preserved ruins surround the forum of the Harsh, a large paved square with an entry marked by a majestic arch. Roman Cuicul Under the name of Cuicul, the city was built above sea level during the 1st century AD as a Roman military garrison situated on a narrow triangular plateau in the province of Numidia. The terrain is somewhat rugged, being located at the confluence of two rivers. Cuicul on the map of Numidia, just south of Milevium and Cirta.Atlas Antiquus, H. Kiepert, 1869 Cuicul's builders followed a standard plan with a forum at the center and two main streets, the Cardo Maximus and the Decumanus Maximus, composing the major axes.Djemila, Morocco, Algeria, & Tunisia, Geoff Crowther and Hugh Finlay, Lonely Planet, 2nd Edition, April 1992, pp. 298 - 299. The city was initially populated by a colony of Roman soldiers from Italy, and eventually grew to become a large trading market. The resources that contributed to the prosperity of the city were essentially agricultural (cereals, olive trees and farm). During the reign of Caracalla in the 3rd century, Cuicul's administrators took down some of the old ramparts and constructed a new forum. They surrounded it with larger and more impressive edifices than those that bordered the old forum. The terrain hindered building, so that they built the theatre outside the town walls, which was exceptional. Christianity became very popular in the 4th century (after some persecutions in the early third centuryChristian persecutions in Cuicul) and brought the addition of a basilica and baptistery. They are to the south of Cuicul in a quarter called \\"Christian\\", and are popular attractions. Of the bishops of Cuicul, Pudentianus took part in the Council of Carthage (255) concerning the validity of heretical baptism, and Elpidophorus in the Council of Carthage (348). Cresconius was the Catholic bishop who represented Cuicul at the Council of Carthage (411) between Catholic and Donatist bishops; the Donatist bishop of the town died before the conference began. Crescens was one of the Catholic bishops whom the Arian Vandal king Huneric summoned to Carthage in 484. Victor was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553.A. Berthier, v.

Life Ann was born in London, the daughter of coal merchant Edward Brown. She made her debut at the age of eleven portraying Fanny in The Maid of the Mill at Covent Garden Theatre in November 1771. She continued to perform there for nine years and enjoyed success as a singing ingenue, particularly in the role of Venus in The West Indian, a part she performed for the first time on 20 October 1773. She was described as a delightful singer and displayed a comic talent which made her \\"an amazing favourite\\" with the public, but she also attracted scandal in the press for love affairs with her admirers, and trying to break free from her father's guardianship. She made repeated attempts to escape from her father, before being apprehended and forced to return home. He also opposed her appearing on stage, which created conflicts with theatre management. In an incident from 1776, after running away she was placed in the house of her aunt and made to wait for her father, upon which several of her colleagues from Covent Garden instead came and carried her away (with her aunt's blessing) to the playhouse instead, so she could appear in a show that night. In 1780, she left the theatre and eloped with a Mr. R. Cargill, and married him on 24 May in Edinburgh. Between 1780 and 1782, she was engaged at with Colman's company in Haymarket during the summers, and at Drury Lane theatre during the winters. However, by 1783 she was reported to have a begun a new affair, although the man's identity is unclear as the newspapers give several possible names for him, mentioning an \\"Oriental Diamond Mongerer\\", an unnamed \\"sea captain\\" as well as a Mr Rumbold, who had been banished to India by his father for his debts and who arranged for her to accompany him. Her lover was in the British East India Company and stationed in Calcutta, so she left England for India. In 1783, she performed operatic parts in Calcutta, to tremendous applause, and her benefit night brought in \\"the astonishing sum of 12,000 rupees.\\" However, because the directors of the East India Company had \\"settled that the pure shores of India should not be invaded by an actress\\" (indeed, the Calcutta Theatre had an all-male cast), she was obliged to leave India.Philip H.

It is designated as a core route of the National Highway System, forming a portion of an interprovincial corridor. Highway 9 spans approximately from the Trans- Canada Highway (Highway 1) east of Calgary to Alberta's border with Saskatchewan.  Route description  Highway 9 descending into the Red Deer River valley in Drumheller Highway 9 begins at its interchange with Highway 1 approximately east of Chestermere and west of Strathmore, and approximately north of Langdon via Highway 797\\\\. For its first , Highway 9 generally runs in a north/south direction to Beiseker. At Beiseker, Highway 9 runs in an east- west direction for to Drumheller. It then runs north/south for from Drumheller to its intersection with Highway 27 east of Morrin. The highway then runs east/west for the balance of route to the Saskatchewan border, providing connections to Hanna and Oyen as well as numerous smaller communities, and generally running parallel to Highway 12 to the north. The highway continues as Saskatchewan Highway 7 in a northeast direction toward Saskatoon.  History  Over the past few years, the province of Alberta has executed a number of upgrades to the highway, widening shoulders and realigning the road (most recently just west of Drumheller, although the new alignment now bypasses the Horseshoe Canyon landmark as a result). As of 2007, however, the province has yet to twin any stretch of the busy highway, and there have been calls for interchanges to be built at its junctions with Highway 21 and the Trans-Canada due to the number of fatal automobile accidents that have happened at these locations. A partial cloverleaf interchange was constructed in 2007 where Highway 9 crosses the Trans-Canada Highway. As well, the junction with Highway 21 was changed to a four-way stop in early 2011.

She won four UCI World Championship Junior titles, the road race in 2000 (Plouay, France), and the unique treble of mountain bike (Colorado, USA), time trial and road race (both Lisbon, Portugal) in 2001. As a result of this achievement she was awarded the 2001 Bidlake Memorial Prize for outstanding performance or contribution to British cycling. International cycling career 2002‚Äì2007 Cooke turned professional for the Spanish-Ukrainian Deia-Pragma-Colnago team at the start of the 2002 season, basing herself in Forli, Italy where she shared a house with Australian rider and future founder Rochelle Gilmore and learned Italian. In her first professional season in 2002, Cooke won races in Italy, France and the Netherlands, and won the road race in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the first ever win in the road discipline for Wales, either male or female. Cooke said her strength left her in her first Tour de France, aged 19, and a meeting in the team campervan suggested \\"medicines\\" to help her. She refused them. The Deia-Pragma-Colnago team did not pay wages to Cooke and some colleagues. The team took Cooke's racing bicycle ahead of the world road championships in October and then returned it in time for the World Championships following a telephone call from Ernesto Colnago. Nicole was runner-up in the BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year competition. Cooke signed for the Acca Due O Team for 2003 and a new UCI regulation limiting team sizes split the Acca Due O squad in two for 2003 so Cooke rode for the new Ausra Gruodis-Safi Team with many of the younger riders. She rode for the merged and renamed Safi-Pasta Zara Manhattan Team in 2004 and 2005. In 2003 Cooke won La Fl√®che Wallonne F√©minine, the Amstel Gold Race, the GP de Plouay and the GP San Francisco. She was the 2003 UCI Women's Road World Cup champion, youngest to win the competition and the first Briton. She came third in the world road championship. Cooke was voted BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year. She hit a stationary police motorbike in June at the Tour du Grand Montr√©al required stitches in her left knee. Three weeks later she crashed again at the Giro de Trentino and had to miss 4 weeks of racing in July and August. A winter and spring of rehabilitation failed to cure the recurring knee problem and she had surgery in May. At the end of June in her first race in eight months, she won her fifth British title. The following month Cooke won the Giro d'Italia Femminile, the youngest winner and the first British cyclist, male or female, to win a Grand Tour. At the 2004 Summer Olympics she placed fifth in the women's road race and 19th in the road time trial. In 2005, she again won La Fl√®che Wallonne F√©minine. She also won the GP Wallonie, Trofeo Alfredo Binda and the Trofeo Citta di Rosignano. She came second in the UCI Road World Championships. At the end of 2005 she joined Swiss-based team Univega Pro-Cycling for two seasons, moving to Lugano in 2006 where she still lives. Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. Team Australia celebrate beating World No 1 Nicole Cooke of Wales, the defending Champion, who Team Wales had sent to compete on her own. Team Wales sent a full squad of six for the men's race, none of whom finished the race. In her autobiography Cooke wrote \\"By their decision the WCU had gifted Australia, Canada, England and New Zealand my head on a plate\\". In October 2005 the Welsh Cycling Union (WCU) selection commission decided to send a full team of six male riders to the 2006 Commonwealth Games, centered on supporting the aspirations of the National Coach Julian Winn, but also decided that Cooke would be sent as a one-person team to defend her title. In April 2016 Cooke would cite this as an example of the sexist attitudes of the sport she encountered throughout her career in an article - Welcome to the world of elite cycling where sexism is by design. In December 2005, when preparing for the 2006 Commonwealth Games, she broke a collarbone during the Manchester leg of the UCI Track World Cup; despite this, and the lack of any team support, she came third in the road race at the Games in March 2006. In her autobiography Cooke wrote \\"By their decision the WCU had gifted Australia, Canada, England and New Zealand my head on a plate\\". None of the six Welsh men completed the men's race. On 1 August 2006 Cooke took over as number 1 on the UCI's women's world road race rankings. On 3 September 2006 she secured the UCI Women's Road World Cup for a second time after winning three world cup races in the season ‚Äì La Fl√®che Wallonne F√©minine, the Ladies Golden Hour and the Castilla y Leon World Cup Race. She also won the 2006 Grande Boucle, the women's Tour de France, by over 6 minutes. Other important wins included four stages and the overall title at Th√ºringen-Rundfahrt stage race and the Magali Pache Time Trial. She came third in the UCI World Road Race Championships. In 2007, Cooke took the Geelong World Cup and the Ronde van Vlaanderen, the first two races on the 2007 UCI Women's Road World Cup. These early season wins led to her setting a new record in the UCI's women's world road race rankings for the gap between the first and second ranked cyclists. She also won the Trofeo Alfredo Binda for a second time, the Tour of Geelong, stage 2 of the GP Costa Etrusca and defended her Grande Boucle title. A knee injury sustained prior to the last race of the 2007 World Cup, the Rund um die N√ºrnberger Altstadt, prevented Cooke from fully defending her title with close challenger Marianne Vos winning the final race and taking the title. Cooke had led the series since the first race. The injury forced her to miss the 2007 World Championships in Stuttgart. Cooke later admitted in an interview in 2008 that she had considered quitting the sport due to the injury. 2008: Olympic and World success Cooke joined Team Halfords Bikehut for 2008. Her first victory of 2008 was the Tour de l'Aude, in which she rode with a Great Britain national team, taking the first stage and finishing fourth overall. On 28 June, Cooke won her ninth national road race champion title, and her eighth consecutive win. Cooke represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing in the Women's Road Race where she won the gold on 10 August 2008, the 200th gold for Great Britain in the Modern Olympic Games, the first Gold Medal in any cycling discipline by a British woman, the first Road Race Gold Medal for Great Britain in this discipline and the first ever individual Gold Medal at the Olympics by a Welsh woman. She became the first cyclist, male or female, to become the road race World Champion and Olympic gold medalist in the same year. An eventful race in Varese, Italy lasted 3 hours 42 minutes and 11 seconds, culminating in a sprint beating Marianne Vos in to 2nd place and Judith Arndt in 3rd. She credited her teammates for their work, pulling back the 12-rider break with 1 lap to go, putting Cooke back in contention. Cooke's book, Cycle for life was published in October 2008 by Kyle Cathie (). The book combines her passion and enthusiasm for cycling, together with her knowledge, proficiency and experience. It is aimed at cyclists at all levels, with expert advice on everything from getting started to turning competitive, covering commuting, racing and riding with friends. Later career: 2009-2012 British National Road Race Champion's jersey in the 2010 Fl√®che Wallonne F√©minine, a race she won on three occasions, 2003, 2005 & 2006. Cooke was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours. She was awarded the Transworld Sport \\"Female Athlete of the Year\\" title in recognition of her achievements in 2008. She was also awarded the Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year award. In June 2009 Cooke captured the Giro del Trentino title and won her tenth British National Road Race Championships title. After Cooke's Vision1 Cycling Team finished 7th in the 2009 UCI Team Rankings, Cooke closed the team after being unable to attract a major sponsor as the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 hit. Cooke signed for Equipe Nuernberg Versicherung for 2010. The team management had put the team together without signing a main sponsor and in December the team collapsed, leaving the riders without a team or salary. Cooke raced and trained with the British cycling team in the 2010 season. She won a stage at the Iurreta-Emakumeen Bira. At the 2010 Commonwealth Games Cooke placed fifth in the Women's Road Race, and at the 2010 UCI Road World Championships Cooke finished fourth in the road race. In November 2010 Cooke joined the Italian-based Mcipollini-Giordana team for 2011. That year she won Stage 5 of the Giro D'Italia and took fourth place in the World Championships Road Race. In October Cooke won the GP Noosa, Australia. Joining the Faren- Honda team for 2012, Cooke scored won Stage 6 of the Energiewacht Tour in the Netherlands. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, she competed in the road race, finishing 31st. Teammate Lizzie Armitstead took the silver medal. At the 2012 UCI Road World Championships Cooke finished 60th, five minutes behind winner Marianne Vos. Cooke announced her retirement from the sport on 14 January 2013 at the age of 29. In a speech to journalists confirming her retirement, Cooke ‚Äùexposed every aspect of corruption in professional cycling, from doping to gross gender inequality. It took 20 minutes to deliver and was met by journalists by stunned silence then applause\\" This caused Forbes to title their article \\"The Anti-Lance Armstrong\\". After cycling In March 2014, Cooke was reported to be studying for an MBA at Cardiff University. Her autobiography, The Breakaway, was published in the summer of 2014 to significant critical acclaim. The Guardian's Richard Williams described it as \\"a compelling and salutary account of the price she paid for the victories from which many others will benefit\\". It was named The Sunday Times Sports Book of the Year 2014 and long listed for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year prize and shortlisted for the Cross Sports Book Award. Since retirement Cooke has repeatedly spoken out campaigning for gender equality in sport and stronger investigatory powers for the anti-doping bodies. In January 2017, Cooke gave writtenhttp://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/culture- media-and-sport-committee/combatting-doping-in-sport/written/45898.pdf and oral evidence to the Parliamentary Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport inquiry into Combatting Doping in Sport and stated that her information about doping in cycling, given as evidence to UKAD was subsequently not investigated by UKAD. The Times described her evidence \\"GB gold medallist hits out at doping and sexism\\". The Independent stated \\"Former Olympic and world champion cyclist Nicole Cooke has issued a damning attack on British Cycling and Team Sky, condemning the governing bodies for their lack of accountability, sexism, and failure to fight the abuse of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) within the sport\\".

Etymology The specific name, mitranus, is in honour of Indian archeologist and anthropologist \\"B√°bu R√°jendral√°la Mitra\\" (1824‚Äì1891).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Scincus mitranus, p. 180). Description S. mitranus may grow to a length of and have an orange-brown or sand-coloured back, and a white underside. On the side it has a line or spots in a light colour, and the back and legs have vague dark bands. The snout is shaped like a bill, and the legs and tail are short. Behaviour The eastern skink can run quickly, or slide over the sand and dig itself in quickly when it is in danger. Diet S. mitranus preys on several kinds of arthropods, especially centipedes and beetles. Geographic range and habitat S. mitranus is found in the Arabian Peninsula (Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates), western Iran, and Pakistan. Its presence in Pakistan is disputed. Habitat S. mitranus is associated with loose sand dune (aeolian) habitats. Reproduction The eastern skink is viviparous, which gives it an advantage compared to other species in the area, as its eggs cannot desiccate.

The logic of the extended usage is reinforced by a much stronger personal link, as it was Robert Passelewe, a royal justice of the forest, who was deputed by Henry III to carry out a thorough reform of serjeanties held of the king in 1250. An example noted by Pollock and Maitland is that of Walter Devenish, whose serjeanty demanded that he provide three arrows if the king should decide to hunt on Dartmoor. His new terms required he pay a rent of three shillings, of which one shilling was to come from subtenants. Generally the lever used to transform the tenure was the doctrine of the inalienability and impartibility of serjeanties.For inalienability, cf. Pollock and Maitland. The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I, volume 1, p. 290. Many serjeanties had been wholly or partly subinfeudated without royal approval, allowing the royal agents to threaten complete dispossession if the tenant did not accept the new terms. John had carried out a similar purge of serjeanties in 1205, but this applied only to the honour of Lancaster, which was then in his hands: Henry III's reforms extended his father's changes to the much larger number of serjeanties held of the king. The inquiry of 1250 makes up the greater part of volume 2 of the most recently published volume of the Book of Fees.

It was founded in 1694 and has a roll of around 750 pupils. It is the sister school of the all-boys Stewart's Melville College (SMC) with which MES shares a coeducational nursery and junior school for pupils aged 3‚Äì11. The majority of its pupils live in the surrounding area (Edinburgh, Lothian and Fife) but boarding facilities are available. About 3% of the pupils are boarders. The school is non-denominational but claims to have a broadly Christian outlook. Both MES and SMC are managed by the Merchant Company of Edinburgh which is also responsible for the city's George Watson's College. In 2014 the combined Erskine Stewarts Melville school claimed to be the largest independent school in Europe.(2014) Erskine Stewart's Melville School The Tatler Schools Guide, retrieved 8 March 2014 Although the school is single sex, some activities, although not teaching, are carried out jointly with the boys from SMC.

In 1870, it was refounded by act of Parliament as a day school, renamed as the Edinburgh Educational Institution For Girls and had grown to 1,200 girl students. In 1871 it moved its premises to Queen Street, Edinburgh and became familiarly known as Queen Street School. The school was renamed again as Edinburgh Ladies' College in 1889, and to its present name, \\"The Mary Erskine School\\", in 1944. In 1966 the school moved to Ravelston, Edinburgh and in 1977 the Mary Erskine School merged with an all-boys independent secondary school Stewart's Melville College which is located approximately one mile (2 km) from the MES campus and The Erskine Stewart's Melville Schools (ESMS) was formed. Together MES and SMC have a co-educational Junior School which caters for pupils from three to 11 years old. Nursery to Primary 3 are housed on the Mary Erskine campus, with Primary 4 to 7 on the Stewart's Melville campus. The combined sixth (final) form of both schools is coeducational.

Sports include Aerobics, Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Cricket, Cross-country, Curling, Dance, Equestrian, Fencing, Football, Golf, ice skating, Highland Dancing, Hockey, Sailing, Skiing, Squash, Swimming, Tennis and Volleyball. =Hockey= MES excels particularly in hockey, with over 6 teams competing at senior level and many pupils playing at National level. Pupils have the opportunity to play for the Erksine Stewart's Melville Former Pupil Hockey Club once leaving sixth form. MES also has P.E teachers and former pupils playing hockey for Scotland and Great Britain. =Ravelston Sports Club= \\"Ravelston Sports Club\\" is a large on- site sports centre and gym opened in 2000 and is split across both campuses. The sports centre is mainly used by pupils for PE lessons and sports training, but is also open to members of the public with a monthly membership fee. Extensive rugby and cricket pitches and athletics facilities are located at the school's sports grounds in Inverleith. Music and Drama Almost 800 children sing regularly in choirs performing in all kinds of venues from the Usher Hall to St Peter's in the Vatican, from Songs of Praise to sharing the stage with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. In addition to this 300 children from Primary 4 to senior sixth Form play in school orchestras and bands (including Pipe Band and Jazz Band). Boys and girls from the Junior School have had favourable reviews while performing over 680 times in professional West End touring musicals including over 220 appearances in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Senior pupils have won prestigious scholarships to American Drama Schools and starred on TV. Pupils have access to and frequently perform in SMC's \\"Tom Fleming Centre for Performing Arts\\" (formerly \\"Performing Arts Centre\\"). Carbisdale Since 1965, the school has organised an outdoor education programme for the boys of SMC and the girls from MES in the third senior year. It is located in the north of Scotland at Carbisdale Castle, a historic castle which has been converted into a Youth Hostel. The trip consists of a number of outdoor activities that vary from year to year including hillwalking, orienteering, golf, kayaking, team-building activities, visits to nearby historic sites and environmental studies of the surrounding woodland. Carbisdale Castle has a plaque of the Stewart's Melville College badge in its foyer above the main door. Pastoral Between First Senior Year and Fifth Year pupils are split into house groups. There are six different houses (named after areas of Scotland): * Appin * Ettrick * Galloway * Kintyre * Lochaber * Torridon Each house has a Head of House tutor as well as a form tutor for each year group who is responsible for pupils' well-being. These houses correspond with the houses of the same names at Stewart's Melville College, and are the basis for the 'ESM Challenge'. This is a series of annual events involving both the boys and girls in each house. It covers a wide variety of school societies, ranging from the House Music Competition to the Inter-house Hockey. The competition comes to a climax on Sports Day with a 4 √ó 100 m relay between each house. The winning house is then awarded a cup at the school's prizegiving ceremony. Senior Sixth form When pupils enter the sixth (final) form they are merged with the boys from Stewart's Melville College. Classes take place at both school sites, with buses operating regularly to transfer students between the two. There are approximately 240 students in a normal year group. In sixth form students are largely independent. Students have a tutor (twinned with another at the other site) with whom they register in the morning, and who also helps them with their British university UCAS applications. All members of the sixth form are prefects and are expected to help out with duties around the school sites. The maintenance of the prefect body is the responsibility of a Head Boy and a Head Girl, along with five deputy head boys and five deputy head girls.

He commenced his legal career in 1961 when he was appointed assistant in the office of the clerk of the court in Lancashire. He was called to the bar in 1970, at Gray's Inn in London. He has served as the Senior Judge in the Cayman Islands, and a high court judge in Kenya. In 1996 he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Gibraltar. He was suspended from this position while a Tribunal of inquiry was held in Gibraltar, estimated to have cost around ¬£2 million. The inquiry submitted a report to the Governor of Gibraltar, who referred the matter to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. This held hearings between 15 and 18 June 2009 to consider the question of his removal as Chief Justice of Gibraltar due to misbehaviour and inability. He is married to human rights lawyer Anne Schofield, and has four children. He is known for his strong support of human rights and the independence of the judiciary which led him to resign as high court judge and leave Kenya with his family in 1987 when he refused to be influenced by strong political interference in a case. During his term as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Gibraltar, he made several significant decisions, including the ruling that it is unconstitutional for jury service to be compulsory only for men. The decision was reversed on appeal and then went to the Privy Council, who overturned the Gibraltar Government objection of equality for women in jury service.all male juries unconstitutional Privy Council judgement There were also a number of controversies over his conduct, which led to his suspension and subsequent removal from office. Controversies Since his appointment as Chief Justice of Gibraltar, he had been involved in high-profile disputes that he has actively pursued with Chief Minister Peter Caruana. The Tribunal of Inquiry, appointed by the Governor to look into whether his appointment should be referred to the Privy Council, reported that they found that Chief Justice Schofield misbehaved in his pursuit of these disputes and was unable to perform the duties of Chief Justice of Gibraltar. Chief Justice Schofield has been publicly critical of the Judicial Reforms introduced by the UK Government and Gibraltar Social Democrats administration through the new Constitution of Gibraltar and the Judicial Services Act. These criticisms centred on the replacement of the Chief Justice by the President of the Court of Appeal as Head of the Judiciary and the creation of a Judicial Services Commission to oversee the judiciary, which he has claimed, in the face of much learned opposition, can be controlled too easily by the Executive and in his view posed a threat to judicial independence. This stance has been heavily criticised by the Tribunal report. After the introduction of the new Constitution by the UK Government followed by the enactment of the Judicial Services Act, Chief Justice Schofield launched a Judicial Review into the changes. He subsequently withdrew this Judicial Review. A large costs order was made against him consequently by the very Court over which he presided over until his suspension. He has paid these costs. The Tribunal report is critical of Chief Justice Schofield for having taken this Judicial Review. He purported to have cancelled the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year (for which he is also criticised by the Tribunal report) without success as it was held by the newly appointed Head of the Judiciary. The dispute escalated further to involve leading members of the Gibraltar legal profession who intended proposing a vote of no confidence in the Chief Justice. The motion was never put and instead a complaint was made to the Governor. This complaint led to the Governor appointing the Tribunal to inquire into his removal for inability and misbehaviour. The Tribunal delivered a report suggesting there were grounds for his removal. Chief Justice Schofield was represented at the Tribunal hearings by Edward Fitzgerald QC, the Tribunal by Tim Otty QC, the Government by James Eadie QC and the Gibraltar lawyers who complained by Antony White QC with Robert Vasquez, a partner of Triay & Triay, lawyers in Gibraltar. Anne Schofield instructed a local barrister Charles Gomez to launch a libel lawsuit against Bar Association Chairman James Neish for making allegedly defamatory statements. Charles Gomez, having earlier ended his representation of her, she subsequently withdrew this lawsuit and now faces paying a substantial costs order made against her by the Supreme Court. This led to a bankruptcy notice issued against her, but proceedings have not commenced. Mrs Schofield has petitioned the European Court alleging breaches of her right to a fair trial and discrimination. Mrs Schofield has to pay ¬£45,000 in costs after the Privy Council declined an application from her to appeal. In a statement she still alleges that the judge who heard her case Sir Michael Turner, should have recused himself because of what she claims are interests that could make him partial. Alfred A. Vasquez Q.C., also a partner of Triay & Triay, represented both the Government of Gibraltar to oppose the Chief Justice's Judicial Review and James Neish in Mrs Schofield's defamation action. On 17 September 2007 Schofield was suspended on full pay pending the inquiry into his removal from office.Vox - Governor Suspends Schofield from Chief Justice Functions It has been reported that at one earlier moment in time he was offered full remuneration until his retirement in return for his resignation, but that he declined this offer. Tribunal A tribunal was convened in Gibraltar, chaired by Lord Cullen with Sir Peter Gibson and Sir Jonathan Parker, to determine whether to refer his appointment to the Privy Council. The full Inquiry report, which recommended that his appointment should be reviewed, along with the daily transcript and other documents regarding the dispute is available from the Gibraltar Chronicle document repository site. There are mixed views over the report of the tribunal, which it is claimed went further than its mandate and made a string of assumptions which it is claimed \\"show how little grasp of the local social and political situation the three judges actually had.\\" On 18 November 2008 the Governor of Gibraltar released a statement that he had referred the case to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Privy Council The Privy Council cancelled the original hearing of this matter which was scheduled for 27‚Äì29 January 2009. In June 2009 of the Privy Council considered the matter. The Governor was represented by Tim Otty QC, the Government of Gibraltar by James Eady QC, the Gibraltar lawyers who complained appeared as litigants in person, by Robert Vasquez of Triay & Triay, lawyers in Gibraltar. Chief Justice Schofield was represented by the Hon Michael Beloff QCHon Michael Beloff from Blackstone Chambers and Paul Stanley from Essex Court ChambersPaul Stanley and briefed by Mr Charles Gomez from Gibraltar. On 12 November 2009 the Privy Council judgement was released in which by a 4:3 majority they supported the removal of the Chief Justice from office. Removal from office On 17 November 2009 the following notice was issued: \\"Acting on the advice received from the Judicial Service Commission, HE The Governor, Sir Adrian Johns, has today carried out the removal by means of dismissal of Mr Justice Schofield from the office of Chief Justice.\\" See also *Court system of Gibraltar *Chief Justice of Gibraltar References External links *International Commission of Jurists - Attacks on justice 2002 - Gibraltar *Vox \\"Bar Wars Aggravated by Caruana Publication of Contentious Legal Reforms\\" (May 2007) *Vox - \\"Schofield Drops Call for Review\\" (December 2007) *Vox - Experts Vindicate Schofield‚Äôs Constitution Doubts (November 2006) *Vox - Schofield Stirs Up A Storm (August 2006) *Panorama - Police to Investigate Phone Tapping Claims at Home of Chief Justice (May 2000) *The Nation (Nairobi) - \\"Ex-Kenyan Judge Gets More Support\\" (November 2007) *Vox - \\"A Further Step on the Slippery Slope to Dictatorship?\\" (February 2007) *Gibraltar Chronicle - Transcripts of Tribunal Proceedings *Daily Nation (Nairobi) - Judge Schofield fights on for the cause of justice (October 2008) Living people 1945 births Chief justices of Gibraltar Caymanian judges British judges on the courts of Kenya ","title":"Derek Schofield"},{"id":"3820320","text":"Park Patrol is a computer designed by Tony Ngo and game published in 1984 by Activision for the Commodore 64. It was later released for the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Players control a park ranger with a choice of a male or female character. The goal is to tidy up rubbish from the waters of the lake and the shoreline. Gameplay The ranger can walk on the shore or use an inflatable dinghy with an outboard motor to go into the water. Turtles kill on contact. If one falls into the water it can be rescued for points but turn into a fast- moving green turtle if left for too long. Snakes lurk in the water and can puncture the dinghy. They can be scared away temporarily by dropping snake repellent (at the cost of energy). Swimmers can be rescued when calling for help. Ants steel food from the hut, which can be recovered by bumping into them from the side (and killed by knocking them into the water). On the shore is the ranger's hut, which contains food to top up energy. A plant near the hut grows every time the ranger walks into it. When it flowers, the ranger gets a short period of immunity. By approaching at the right angle, the ranger can jump out of the dinghy and land on floating lots, starting a logrolling mini-game. Once all the litter is collected, a bonus is awarded based on energy remaining.

It contained 51% skim milk, was sweetened by a blend of sugar and sucralose, and provided 30% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamins A, C & D and Calcium. It was available in three flavors: a vanilla-banana flavor called Vanana, a blueberry- strawberry flavor called Blooo, and a chocolate flavor. It was most often found in school cafeterias.

A parody of the superhero genre, Megaton Man is a gigantically-muscled but dim-witted oaf who starred in Simpson's cheerfully absurd stories.  Publication history  Megaton Man is also the title of the creator-owned comic book series (published by Kitchen Sink Press beginning in 1984) Simpson wrote and drew, in which the character first appeared and starred. The original Megaton Man series ran for ten issues, but the character was later revived in a limited series, The Return of Megaton Man, and a series of one-shot issues spun off from the concept. In 1994, Simpson left Kitchen Sink to form his own company, Fiasco Comics, through which Simpson self-published his new title Bizarre Heroes, featuring Megaton Man (and many members of his old supporting cast) as part of a large ensemble cast. Bizarre Heroes ended when Fiasco went out of business during the mid-1990s contraction of the American comics industry, but Megaton Man and the rest of the Bizarre Heroes went on to appear in several projects published by Image Comics. Character Trent Phloog lives in Megatropolis, a futuristic city in Michigan, United States, and he makes his living as the superhero Megaton Man, otherwise known as \\"The Man of Molecules\\". Whenever he says the magic word \\"Overkill\\", he explodes. Megaton Man's costume is metallic blue, with yellow gloves and boots. His allies include X-Ray Boy and Yarn Man, who both assist Megaton Man in battles against his arch foes, Bad Guy and Bulky Guy. The origins of Megaton Man's powers remain unknown, but the comic suggests two possibilities: he was either bitten by a radioactive frog, or he was the result of a military megasoldier program. When he first gained his powers, Megaton Man was known as Megaton Lad and he had a sidekick called Plutonium Pup. When Plutonium Pup died on his 21st birthday, Phloog changed his name to Megaton Man. Trent Phloog is married to Stella Starlight, who is the superheroine known as Earth Mother, and they have one child. In recent times, Megaton Man has discovered other incarnations of himself that were active in the past or are active in the present. These include Golden Age Megaton Man, Silver-Age Megaton Man, and a Russian Megaton Man whose costume is red. Outside Megatropolis, Megaton Man is allied to The Phantom Jungle Girl. Villains outside Megatropolis include Irving the Living Cactus, and the Tomb Team, a band of supernatural villains including the Bride of Frankenstein and Dracula's Daughter. Supporting cast =X-Ray Boy= There were two incarnations of X-Ray Boy. The existing one (Larry Barton) lives in Livonia, Michigan. He is Megaton Man's sidekick, and has a robotic arm. His x-ray vision derives from his oversized glasses. When he sent off for a pair of x-ray glasses in an advertisement, he was given real x-ray glasses accidentally released by the Pentagon. The powerful vision burnt his left arm off (hence his cybernetic new arm). When asked to give up the goggles, Larry didn't need them, as the powers had fused into his eyes, giving them a green colour. His schoolfriends now have the goggles, as the Pentagon Representatives were accidentally killed by X-Ray Boys' powers. The current X-Ray Boy is a member of the VW Gang. The 1980s X-Ray Boy was Preston Percy. Hurt by being dropped at a young age, he became evil and formed a group of supervillains known as the Tomb Team. Both versions of X-Ray Boy are heavy smokers. =Yarn Man= Yarn Man (AKA: Bing Gloom) was a member of the Megatropolis Quartet, but is now part of the VW Gang. Yarn Man is so-called because his entire body is made from yarn. Unlike other members of the VW Gang, Yarn Man is the only other superhero who has his own sidekick (Kozmik Kat) and his own personal foe, Irving the Living Cactus (see below). The character of Yarn Man seems very similar to The Thing from Fantastic Four. He was based on Spooner, a real life crocheted man from Ann Arbor. =The Phantom Jungle Girl= Donna Blank works as an activist in Detroit, Michigan, but when trouble strikes, she becomes The Phantom Jungle Girl. A long-time ally of Megaton Man, she is also known for discovering the secret of Preston Percy and the Tomb Team. The Phantom Jungle Girl has also made appearances alongside another superhero called The Tick, a superhero similar in design to Megaton Man. Her boyfriend is the Meddler, a living corpse dedicated to defending Detroit. There was also an incarnation of The Phantom Jungle Girl from the 1950s, known as The '50s Jungle Girl, and the mother of the current incarnation, who took up the mantle in later days. =Cowboy Gorilla= A talking gorilla from the state of Texas, Cowboy Gorilla was the fourth member of the Megatropolis Quartet. Since the group disbanded, he continues to aid Megaton Man frequently as part of the VW Gang, but has never got on with Yarn Man. =Gower Goose and Kozmik Kat= Two anthropomorphic animals, Gower Goose and Kozmik Kat are the mascots to Megaton Man and his friends and members of the VW Gang. *Kozmik Kat is a feline version of Megaton Man, who speaks fluent English and will gladly attack any predators, within reason. He doesn't believe in violence towards women, and is more laid back than other heroes. Kozmik Kat is officially sidekick to Yarn Man, and preferred the \\"megahero\\" business as he is descended from a family of alley-cats, which didn't appeal to him. Kozmik Kat could possibly be a reference to Streaky the Supercat. *Gower Goose is a cowardly goose and a heavy drinker. Although not tough on the side of action, he feels better suited to doing odd jobs for his friends, such as cleaning the dishes and mopping the floor. A good friend of X-Ray Boy, Gower Goose has also had a crush on Mooncat, a member of Tomb Team. Outside his megahero image, Gower Goose is a radio presenter for his own radio station, WUCK (Named after his catchphrase). Gower Goose looks very similar in appearance to Howard the Duck. Teen Idols As the X-Thems are a parody of X-Men, the Teen Idols are a parody of Teen Titans. Little is known about their background, except that they operate in Novi, Michigan, and reports say that they have recently disappeared. Other Heroes of the Fiascoverse The \\"Bizarre Heroes\\" as they have been called since their debut are the other minor heroes of the Fiascoverse, but all of them seem to operate within Michigan. These are: =Anti-Matter Woman= Anti-Matter Woman (Andrea Revell) is another superheroine in Megatropolis. Originally called Negative Woman, the name was altered in order not to be confused with Negative Woman of DC Comics' Doom Patrol. =Captain Keystone= Little is known about Captain Keystone, but he is known to be an elder superhero of Megatropolis. He is a tutor to all superheroes in Michigan, and his powers are unknown. The idea of a superhero mentor could possibly refer to Captain Atlantis (sometimes Captain Newfoundland), a Canadian hero who tutored other heroes such as Captain Canada. =Earth Mother= Formerly \\"See-Thru Girl\\", Earth Mother is a superheroine in Megatropolis who is often accompanied by Miss Megaton Man. In reality, she is Stella Starlight, wife to Megaton Man. The change of name was because the original was too risqu√©. =The Meddler= Little is known about this bandaged mummy-style vigilante save that he is a living corpse. He has had a relationship with the Phantom Jungle Girl. =Pteranoman= Liberal senator Pete Teriano wears a costume which makes him look like an anthropomorhic Pterosaur. He is assisted by Lisa Kopernick and the Cave Babes. =The Slick= A young vigilante armed with a gun that shoots an adhesive substance. Seems similar to Spider-Man. Foes of Megaton Man =The Kickstand Kid= The first villain Megaton Man encountered after changing from Megaton Lad, The Kickstand Kid was a young boy in an enormous robotic body with guns built into almost every part of the machine. As bullets have no effect on Megaton Man, The Kickstand Kid was easily defeated. He seems to bear some resemblance to Gizmo of the Teen Titans. =Dr. Software= A foe of the now-disbanded Megatropolis Quartet, Dr. Software plagued Megaton Man frequently, and still does following the disbanding of his rivals' \\"megahero\\" team. Dr. Software was also responsible for the capture and holding to ransom of a newspaper journalist, Pamela Jointly (a possible reference to Lois Lane). =Bad Guy & Bulky Guy= Two clumsy cousins, Bad Guy and Bulky Guy are both behemoths residing in Megatropolis, who cause as much havoc as possible for the various incarnations of Megaton Man. They have frequently been defeated by not only Megaton Man, but Golden Age Megaton Man, Miss Megaton Man and Anti- Matter Woman. =Irving the Living Cactus= Not a foe of Megaton Man himself, but an enemy of Yarn Man. Irving is able to use his spikes to pin himself to Yarn Man and slowly rip his fibre-body apart. He was supposedly killed by an electric shock from X-Ray Boy in a ghost-town west of Detroit, Michigan, but was merely dehydrated. When he was thrown into a river filled with chemically- polluted water, Irving was resurrected in a new anthropomorphic form, and has sworn revenge against the VW Gang. =The Tomb Team= A team of supernatural entities residing in the catacombs of Ypsilanti Cemetery in Michigan, the Tomb Team can all only speak German, and are led by Megaton Mans' 1980's sidekick, Preston Percy. The Tomb Team are supposedly killed after a battle with Megaton Man, Yarn Man and Cowboy Gorilla while en route to Detroit, Michigan, but interference by Count Dracula has led to the revival of the Frankenstein creations and revival attempts are being made on Dracula's Daughter. Members of the Tomb Team include: *Forbidden Frankenstein - A purple behemoth who previously battled solo with Megaton Man. *The Bride of Frankenstein - Beautiful wife of the above, who can speak English as well as German. *Dracula's Daughter - Green-skinned daughter of Dracula, who is somehow able to move about in daylight. Since the Draculas emigrated to Cleveland from Transylvania, Dracula's Daughter has constantly pestered her father, and it is her vampire bite that places Cowboy Gorilla out of action for a time. *An unnamed Werewolf (deceased). *The Mooncat - A spoiled nurse who became a demoness after giving a bad image to The Phantom Jungle Girl in a brief superhero gig.

The lifetime of the RBCs is reduced from the normal 100‚Äì120 days to just a few days in serious cases. The intracellular components of the RBCs are released into the circulating blood and into tissues, leading to some of the characteristic symptoms of this condition. The antibodies are usually directed against high-incidence antigens, therefore they also commonly act on allogenic RBCs (RBCs originating from outside the person themselves, e.g. in the case of a blood transfusion). AIHA is a relatively rare condition, affecting one to three people per 100,000 per year. Autoimmune hemolysis might be a precursor of later onset systemic lupus erythematosus. The terminology used in this disease is somewhat ambiguous. Although MeSH uses the term \\"autoimmune hemolytic anemia\\", some sources prefer the term \\"immunohemolytic anemia\\" so drug reactions can be included in this category. The National Cancer Institute considers \\"immunohemolytic anemia\\", \\"autoimmune hemolytic anemia\\", and \\"immune complex hemolytic anemia\\" to all be synonyms. Signs and symptoms Spherocytes are found in immunologically-mediated hemolytic anemias. Causes The causes of AIHA are poorly understood. The disease may be primary, or secondary to another underlying illness. The primary illness is idiopathic (the two terms used synonymously). Idiopathic AIHA accounts for approximately 50% of cases. Secondary AIHA can result from many other illnesses. Warm and cold type AIHA each have their own more common secondary causes. The most common causes of secondary warm-type AIHA include lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma) and other autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). Less common causes of warm-type AIHA include neoplasms other than lymphoid, and infection. Secondary cold type AIHA is also caused primarily by lymphoproliferative disorders, but is also commonly caused by infection, especially by mycoplasma, viral pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, and other respiratory infections. Less commonly, it can be caused by concomitant autoimmune disorders. Drug- induced AIHA, though rare, can be caused by a number of drugs, including Œ±-methyldopa and penicillin. This is a type II immune response in which the drug binds to macromolecules on the surface of the RBCs and acts as an antigen. Antibodies are produced against the RBCs, which leads to complement activation. Complement fragments, such as C3a, C4a and C5a, activate granular leukocytes (e.g., neutrophils), while other components of the system (C6, C7, C8, C9) either can form the membrane attack complex (MAC) or can bind the antibody, aiding phagocytosis by macrophages (C3b). This is one type of \\"penicillin allergy\\". In about half of cases, the cause of autoimmune hemolytic anemia cannot be determined (idiopathic or primary). This condition can also be caused by or occur with another disorder (secondary) or rarely, occur following the use of certain drugs (such as penicillin) or after a person has a blood and marrow stem cell transplant. Secondary causes of autoimmune hemolytic anemia include: *Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus *Chronic lymphocytic leukemia *Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other blood cancers *Epstein-Barr virus *Cytomegalovirus *Mycoplasma pneumonia *Hepatitis *HIV Pathophysiology AIHA can be caused by a number of different classes of antibody, with IgG and IgM antibodies being the main causative classes. Depending on which is involved, the pathology will differ. IgG is not very effective at activating complement and effectively binds the Fc receptor (FcR) of phagocytic cells, AIHA involving IgG is generally characterized by phagocytosis of RBCs. IgM is a potent activator of the classical complement pathway, thus, AIHA involving IgM is characterized by complement mediated lysis of RBCs. IgM also leads to phagocytosis of RBCs however, because phagocytic cells have receptors for the bound complement (rather than FcRs as in IgG AIHA). In general, IgG AIHA takes place in the spleen, whereas IgM AIHA takes place in Kupffer cells ‚Äì phagocytic cells of the liver. Phagocytic AIHA is termed extravascular, whereas complement-mediated lysis of RBCs is termed intravascular AIHA. In order for intravascular AIHA to be recognizable, it requires overwhelming complement activation, therefore most AIHA is extravascular ‚Äì be it IgG- or IgM-mediated. AIHA cannot be attributed to any single autoantibody. To determine the autoantibody or autoantibodies present in a patient, the Coombs test, also known as the antiglobulin test, is performed. There are two types of Coombs tests, direct and indirect; more commonly, the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is used. Classification of the antibodies is based on their activity at different temperatures and their etiology. Antibodies with high activity at physiological temperature (approximately 37 ¬∞C) are termed warm autoantibodies. Cold autoantibodies act best at temperatures of 0‚Äì4 ¬∞C. Patients with cold-type AIHA, therefore, have higher disease activity when body temperature falls into a hypothermic state. Usually, the antibody becomes active when it reaches the limbs, at which point it opsonizes RBCs. When these RBCs return to central regions, they are damaged by complement. Patients may present with one or both types of autoantibodies; if both are present, the disease is termed \\"mixed-type\\" AIHA. When DAT is performed, the typical presentations of AIHA are as follows. Warm-type AIHA shows a positive reaction with antisera to IgG antibodies with or without complement activation. Cases may also arise with complement alone or with IgA, IgM or a combination of these three antibody classes and complement. Cold-type AIHA usually reacts with antisera to complement and occasionally to the above antibodies. This is the case in both cold agglutinin disease and cold paroxysmal hematuria. In general, mixed warm and cold AIHA shows a positive reaction to IgG and complement, sometimes IgG alone, and sometimes complement alone. Mixed-type can, like the others, present unusually with positive reactions to other antisera. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made by first ruling out other causes of hemolytic anemia, such as G6PD, thalassemia, sickle-cell disease, etc. Clinical history is also important to elucidate any underlying illness or medications that may have led to the disease. Following this, laboratory investigations are carried out to determine the etiology of the disease. A positive DAT test has poor specificity for AIHA (having many differential diagnoses); so supplemental serological testing is required to ascertain the cause of the positive reaction. Hemolysis must also be demonstrated in the lab. The typical tests used for this are a complete blood count (CBC) with peripheral smear, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (in particular with isoenzyme 1), haptoglobin and urine hemoglobin. =Classification= AIHA can be classified as warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia or cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which includes cold agglutinin disease and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. These classifications are based on the characteristics of the autoantibodies involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Each has a different underlying cause, management, and prognosis, making classification important when treating a patient with AIHA. \\\\ :Autoimmune hemolytic anemia ::*Warm-antibody type :::*Primary :::*Secondary (lymphoproliferative disorders, autoimmune disorders) ::*Cold-antibody type (anemia) :::*Primary cold agglutinin disease :::*Secondary cold agglutinin syndrome ::::*Associated with malignant disease ::::*Acute, transient, infection-associated (acute cold antibody mediated AIHA complicating Mycoplasma pneumoniae or viral infections) ::::*Chronic (lymphoproliferative disorders) ::*Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria :::*Idiopathic :::*Secondary ::::*Acute, transient (Infections other than syphilis) ::::*Chronic (syphilis) ::*Mixed cold- and warm-antibody type :::*Idiopathic :::*Secondary (lymphoproliferative disorders, autoimmune disorders) ::*Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia :::*Autoimmune type :::*Drug absorption type :::*Neoantigen type =Evidence for hemolysis= The following findings may be present: *Increased red cell breakdown Elevated serum bilirubin (unconjugated) Excess urinary urobilinogen Reduced plasma haptoglobin Raised serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) Hemosiderinuria Methemalbuminemia Spherocytosis *Increased red cell production: Reticulocytosis Erythroid hyperplasia of the bone marrow ;Specific investigations *Positive direct Coombs test Treatment Plentiful literature exists regarding the treatment of AIHA. Efficacy of treatment depends on the correct diagnosis of either warm- or cold-type AIHA. Warm-type AIHA is usually a more insidious disease, not treatable by simply removing the underlying cause. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy. For those who fail to respond or have recurrent disease, splenectomy may be considered. Other options for recurrent or relapsed disease include immunosuppressants such as rituximab, danazol, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or cyclosporine. Cold agglutinin disease is treated with avoidance of cold exposure. Patients with more severe disease (symptomatic anemia, transfusion dependence) may be treated with rituximab. Steroids and splenectomy are less efficacious in cold agglutinin disease. Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria is treated by removing the underlying cause, such as infection. History \\"Blood-induced icterus\\" produced by the release of massive amounts of a coloring material from blood cells followed by the formation of bile was recognized and described by Vanlair and Voltaire Masius' in 1871. About 20 years later, Hayem distinguished between congenital hemolytic anemia and an acquired type of infectious icterus associated with chronic splenomegaly. In 1904, Donath and Landsteiner suggested a serum factor was responsible for hemolysis in paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. French investigators led by Chauffard stressed the importance of red-cell autoagglutination in patients with acquired hemolytic anemia. In 1930, Lederer and Brill described cases of acute hemolysis with rapid onset of anemia and rapid recovery after transfusion therapy. These hemolytic episodes were thought to be due to infectious agents. A clear distinction between congenital and acquired hemolytic anemia was not drawn, however, until Dameshek and Schwartz in 1938, and, in 1940, they demonstrated the presence of abnormal hemolysins in the sera of patients with acquired hemolytic anemia and postulated an immune mechanism. During the past three decades, studies defining red-cell blood groups and serum antibodies have produced diagnostic methods that have laid the basis for immunologic concepts relevant to many of the acquired hemolytic states. Of these developments, the antiglobulin test described by Coombs, Mourant, and Race in 1945 has proved to be one of the more important, useful tools now available for the detection of immune hemolytic states. This technique demonstrated that a rabbit antibody against human globulin would induce agglutination of human red cells \\"coated with an incomplete variety of rhesus antibody\\". C. Moreschlit had used the same method in 1908 in a goat antirabbit-red-cell system. The test was premature and was forgotten. In 1946, Boorman, Dodd, and Loutit applied the direct antiglobulin test to a variety of hemolytic anemias, and laid the foundation for the clear distinction of autoimmune from congenital hemolytic anemia. A hemolytic state exists whenever the red cell survival time is shortened from the normal average of 120 days. Hemolytic anemia is the hemolytic state in which anemia is present, and bone marrow function is inferentially unable to compensate for the shortened life- span of the red cell. Immune hemolytic states are those, both anemic and nonanemic, which involve immune mechanisms consisting of antigen-antibody reactions. These reactions may result from unrelated antigen-antibody complexes that fix to an innocent-bystander erythrocyte, or from related antigen-antibody combinations in which the host red cell or some part of its structure is or has become antigenic. The latter type of antigen-antibody reaction may be termed \\"autoimmune\\", and hemolytic anemias so produced are autoimmune hemolytic anemias. In children In general, AIHA in children has a good prognosis and is self-limiting. However, if it presents within the first two years of life or in the teenage years, the disease often follows a more chronic course, requiring long-term immunosuppression, with serious developmental consequences. The aim of therapy may sometimes be to lower the use of steroids in the control of the disease. In this case, splenectomy may be considered, as well as other immunosuppressive drugs. Infection is a serious concern in patients on long-term immunosuppressant therapy, especially in very young children (less than two years).

Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel brought the tradition from the English music halls when they came to America with Fred Karno's comedy troupe in 1910. Both Chaplin and Laurel occasionally dressed as women in their films. Even the beefy American actor Wallace Beery appeared in a series of silent films as a Swedish woman. The Three Stooges, especially Curly (Jerry Howard), sometimes appeared in drag in their short films. The tradition has continued for many years, usually played for laughs. Only in recent decades have there been dramatic films which included cross-dressing, possibly because of strict censorship of American films until the mid-1960s. One early exception was Alfred Hitchcock's thriller Murder!, where the murderer is a transvestite who wears particularly frilly dresses and petticoats. Cross-gender acting, on the other hand, refers to actors or actresses portraying a character of the opposite gender. Film and video In Some Like It Hot (1959), two struggling musicians have to dress as women to escape the ire of gangsters. The film is a remake of a 1935 French movie, Fanfare of Love, from the story by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan, which was itself remade in 1951 by German director Kurt Hoffmann as Fanfares of Love. In Blake Edwards's 1982 musical comedy film Victor Victoria, Victoria Grant, a struggling soprano, is unable to find work but she finds success when she becomes \\"Count Victor Grazinski\\", a female impersonator. The film is a remake of Viktor und Viktoria, a German film of 1933. David Henry Hwang's 1988 play M. Butterfly focuses on a love affair between a French diplomat and a male Beijing opera singer who plays dan, or female, roles. Although there is some dispute as to whether the character is transgender or simply a cross-dresser, the character of Hedwig from the musical and subsequent movie Hedwig and the Angry Inch is another modern drag queen (the musical also features a male character played traditionally by a female actress, although the character's true gender is deliberately left with slight ambiguity). Dr. Frank 'n' Furter in the Rocky Horror Picture Show wore nothing but women's clothing the entire movie/play. In The Drew Carey Show, Drew's brother, Steve Carey, is a cross- dresser. Robin Williams played a divorced father who dressed as a nanny to be with his children in the 1993 comedy Mrs. Doubtfire. Dame Edna was an elderly drag queen with \\"wisteria-colored hair\\" who did international chat shows in the 1990s. =As a central plot element= Movies that feature cross-dressing as a central plot element: * Films based on the 1599 or 1600 play As You Like It by William Shakespeare  As You Like It (1936)  As You Like It (2006) * Films based on the 1601 or 1602 play Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare  Twelfth Night (1933) ‚Äì an American film, the first film made by Orson Welles  Twelfth Night (1955) ‚Äì a Soviet film  Twelfth Night (1986) ‚Äì an Australian film  Twelfth Night: Or What You Will (1996) ‚Äì a British film * Several films based on the 1892 United Kingdom play Charley's Aunt by Brandon Thomas  Charley's Aunt (1915) ‚Äì an American film  Charley's Aunt (1925) - an American film  Charleys tant (1926) - a Swedish film  Charley's Aunt (1930)  La t√≠a de las muchachas (1938) ‚Äì a Mexican film  Charley's (Big- Hearted) Aunt (1940)  Charley's Aunt (1941)  Charleys Tante (1956) ‚Äì a German film  Charles Tante (1959) ‚Äì a Danish film starring Dirch Passer  Charleys Tante (1963) ‚Äì a German film  Hello, I'm Your Aunt!

Television Milton Berle was one of the most famous early cross-dressing comedians in skits and such on his NBC shows from 1948 to 1956. Harvey Korman played a hefty Jewish mother character on The Carol Burnett Show. Flip Wilson created the memorable recurring character Geraldine Jones on The Flip Wilson Show. The first episode of the Blackadder II series ends with Blackadder's servant, Baldrick, acting as bridesmaid, and Lord Flashheart swapping clothes and running off with Blackadder's bride. Some other comedy sketch shows, such as Monty Python's Flying Circus, Little Britain, The League of Gentlemen, Saturday Night Live and The Kids in the Hall routinely feature visual cross-dressing, with men dressing as women and sometimes speaking in falsetto. Not to be outdone in this regard, the (female) British team of French and Saunders have produced many sketches in which one or both of the actresses portray men. Rudy Giuliani appeared on Saturday Night Live dressed as a woman. Doing some of his best routines, Jonathan Winters played the character, Maude Fricket. Kenan Thompson currently plays a range of women on Saturday Night Live. \\"Rudia\\" Giuliani and Donald Trump in 2000 Australian male comedian Barry Humphries has appeared as Dame Edna in several shows. British stand-up comedian and actor Eddie Izzard, who describes himself as an 'executive' or 'action' transvestite and regularly cross-dresses both on and off stage, has acted in several films (including most recently Valkyrie), as well as releasing his stand-up work on video and DVD (Live at the Ambassadors (1993), Unrepeatable (1994), Definite Article (1996), Glorious (1997), Dress to Kill (1999), Circle (2002), and Sexie (2003)). The Monty Python troupe have been known to cross dress for comedic purposes in their TV series and films. The troupe usually dress up as older, more unarousing women referred to by the troupe as \\"pepperpots\\". Although member Terry Jones was most famous for his female characters, all the members have been seen in drag in one sketch or another; members Michael Palin and Eric Idle have been said to look the most feminine, Graham Chapman specialized in screeching, annoying housewives and John Cleese, whom the troupe has said is the most hilarious in drag, appears so extremely unfeminine, with his square chin and six-foot, five-inch frame that it is funny. Cleese also wore female clothes while appearing as himself in a magazine advertisement for American Express. Monty Python's Flying Circus also did a sketch called \\"The Lumberjack Song,\\" about a lumberjack who likes to \\"put on women's clothing and hang around in bars.\\" In Clue: The Musical, Mrs. White is usually played by a man. In all versions of Hairspray‚Äîthe original film, the stage musical, and the film adapted from the musical‚ÄîEdna Turnblad is played by a man. On some plays and films by Tyler Perry, he dresses up as a woman to play as Madea. Meryl Streep played a male rabbi in an episode of Angels in America. Michelle Ehlen plays a butch lesbian actress who gets cast as a man in a film in the comedic feature Butch Jamie. The Kids in the Hall comedy troupe often dress up as female characters. In contrast to Monty Python, who dressed as women in an exaggerated fashion for comedic purposes, The Kids in the Hall usually played women straight, their reasoning for cross- dressing being that there are few if any women involved in their projects. This has gone on to be one of the group's defining characteristics. Matt Lucas and David Walliams regularly cross-dress in the Little Britain television comedy show, with Lucas in particular often somewhat more feminine and convincing in his appearance and performances than cross-dressing comedians of the past. The two also sometimes play a pair of unconvincing transvestites as a parody of some cross-dressers who try to act in a stereotypically feminine way while not succeeding in \\"passing\\" as women. In the 1992 Kannada movie Bombat Hendthi, a well-known male actor and dancer named Sridar crossdresses.

It occurred in the present-day town of River Vale, New Jersey. Of a company of 116 Continental officers and men, 69 were killed, captured, or wounded. The dead, all bayoneted, tallied 15. Two officers died, two were wounded. Setting On September 22, 1778, ordered Maj. Gen. Sir Charles Grey, Maj. Gen. Lord Cornwallis, and Brigadier General Edward Mathew to mobilize troops in an effort to provoke Gen. George Washington into a battle, and as a diversion for a raid against a Patriot privateering base in southern New Jersey. After learning that Col. George Baylor had secured quarters for his troops, twelve officers and 104 enlisted men, in the barns of several farms on Overkill Road (now Rivervale Road), Cornwallis ordered Grey to pursue Baylor's troops. Battle Around 11 o'clock on the night of September 27, 1778, British Major-General Charles Grey mobilized the 2nd battalion of light infantry, the 2nd regiment of grenadiers, as well as the 33rd and 64th regiments. Between one and three o'clock in the morning, six companies of light infantry under Major Turner Staubenzie and six companies of light infantry under Colonel John Maitland approached a small collection of farm houses occupied by around 100 men of a Virginia cavalry unit known as \\"Mrs. Washington's Guards\\". Maitland's detachment was used to cut off the night patrol, while Straubenzee's troops used their bayonets to maintain the element of surprise as they went from house to house, a tactic Grey used previously in the Battle of Paoli. At least 69 of the dragoons were killed, injured or taken prisoner. Eleven were killed outright; four were left and died of their wounds. Colonel Baylor, Major McLeod, and two other officers attempted to escape by climbing up a chimney. Baylor was wounded and captured‚Äîhe died in 1784 from complications of the wounds incurred in the attack. McLeod was also mortally wounded in the attack. One of the other officers was killed and the other captured. After the attack, some of the injured were taken to the Reformed Church of Tappan in nearby Tappan, New York, which served as a prison and hospital. The 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot, which was nearing the end of its service in the American War, was also involved in this incident. The events were described as follows by General Hunter: \\"While at New Bridge we heard of their being within twenty-five miles of our camp, and a plan was laid to surprise them. We set out after dark, mounted behind dragoons, and so perfectly secure did the enemy think themselves that not even a sentry was posted. Not a shot was fired, and the whole regiment of dragoons, except a few who were bayoneted, were taken prisoner\\".Moorsom, William Scarth (1860). Historical Record of the 52nd Regiment The raid for which this attack was a diversion also included an attack on American forces that has been described as a massacre. On October 15, British troops executed a surprise attack on forces under the command of Kazimierz Pu≈Çaski in which 25 to 30 men were killed in what is known as the Little Egg Harbor massacre. Discovery of remains In 1967, it was discovered that the bodies of six of the dead were buried in three abandoned tanning vats. The vats were from Haring's Tannery, which used to be on the site. The remains were identified by artifacts such as buttons and clothing remnants. This became widely known because of a February 1968 report to the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders, \\"1778 ‚Äì The Massacre of Baylor's Dragoons\\". Facing suburban development, the burial site was made into a county park in 1972 with a dedication on October 15. The remains were reinterred within the park at that time.https://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2012/09/photos_bergen_county_observes_anniversary_of_revolutionary_war_massacre.html The plaque at the site reads: :In memory of American soldiers killed during the Revolutionary War in the 'Baylor Massacre' on September 28, 1778. Lt. Col. George Baylor's 3rd Regiment of Continental Dragoons took quarters for the night on several nearby farms. Tories betrayed their presence to a British force who surrounded the Dragoons during the night. A number of Americans were killed or wounded after they surrendered.

He became the fifth character to assume the alias Bucky before taking on the name \\"Battlestar\\". Publication history Battlestar was created by Mark Gruenwald and Paul Neary, and was originally introduced as a nameless member of the Bold Urban Commandos in Captain America #323. In Captain America #327 he is called \\"Lemar\\" for the first time, but generally is still treated as interchangeable with the other BUCs. He rises from anonymity in Captain America #334, in which his full name is revealed and he adopts the identity of Bucky. Gruenwald later explained: Writer Dwayne McDuffie informed Gruenwald that \\"Buck\\" is considered a derogatory term among African-Americans, as it was a term used before the American Civil War to refer to male slaves, and said that it was also racially offensive to have an adult black man taking on the identity of a teenage sidekick. Writer Mark Gruenwald had not known of the racial connotation of \\"Bucky\\", having grown up in a region with very few African-Americans, and worked with McDuffie to create a story to address the problem and give Hoskins a new name. In Captain America #341 he is renamed Battlestar, dons his own unique costume, and is more explicitly presented as a partner to the new Captain America, rather than a sidekick. Gruenwald recalled, \\"The search for a good name for a partner to Cap is a whole half-hour unto itself. [laughs] We came up with every single name which was vaguely patriotic, vaguely military, and yet stood on its own, because some day these guys may split up.\\" The name \\"Battlestar\\" was ultimately suggested by Captain America penciler Kieron Dwyer. Fictional character biography Lemar Hoskins was born in Chicago, Illinois. Along with his Army buddies John Walker, Hector Lennox, and Jerome Johnson, he is given superhuman strength by Dr. Karl Malus on behalf of the Power Broker, and they become wrestlers. The four later form the Bold Urban Commandos (also known as the \\"BUCkies\\"), and are employed by John Walker, known as the Super-Patriot. The Buckies stage a fake attack on the Super- Patriot for publicity.Captain America #323 (November 1986); \\"Super-Patriot is Here\\" As a BUCky, Hoskins also attacks a group of foreign students.Captain America #327 When the Federal Commission on Superhuman Activities selects Walker to replace Steve Rogers as Captain America, Hoskins is the only one in his group allowed to accompany the new Captain America. He takes the identity of Bucky (after Rogers' original partner Bucky) and undergoes a rigorous training under the supervision of the Commission. Walker and Hoskins go undercover on a mission to stop the Watchdogs.\\"Basic Training\\", Captain America #334 (October 1987) Hoskins, who is African American, is persuaded by another black man that \\"Bucky\\" is a demeaning title, since American slaveholders often referred to male slaves as \\"bucks\\". Consequently, Hoskins takes on the identity of Battlestar, wearing a new costume and wielding a shield patterned after the one Steve Rogers originally carried.\\"Free Speech\\", Captain America #341 (May 1988) Captain America and Battlestar capture Quill but are defeated in combat by Quill's team, the Resistants.

His endurance is also heightened albeit to a lesser degree. His agility and reflexes are of the order of a superior Olympic athlete. Additionally, he possesses superhuman durability and resilience, enabling him to survive high impacts and blows, and in one instance to survive being hanged by the Watchdogs (a Red Skull front group). Battlestar is highly trained in gymnastics and acrobatics. He is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, and received rigorous training in unarmed combat and the use of his shield, in a style similar to the original Captain America, from the Taskmaster. He carries a near indestructible blunt-end triangular adamantium shield in combat, and is capable of using it defensively against kinetic and energy based attacks, and offensively as a missile weapon.

It results from mutations in the HSD11B2 gene, which encodes the kidney isozyme of 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. In an unaffected individual, this isozyme inactivates circulating cortisol to the less active metabolite cortisone. The inactivating mutation leads to elevated local concentrations of cortisol in the aldosterone sensitive tissues like the kidney. Cortisol at high concentrations can cross-react and activate the mineralocorticoid receptor due to the non-selectivity of the receptor, leading to aldosterone-like effects in the kidney. This is what causes the hypokalemia, hypertension, and hypernatremia associated with the syndrome. Patients often present with severe hypertension and end-organ changes associated with it like left ventricular hypertrophy, retinal, renal and neurological vascular changes along with growth retardation and failure to thrive. In serum both aldosterone and renin levels are low. Signs and symptoms This disorder presents similarly to hyperaldosteronism, leading to feedback inhibition of aldosterone. Common symptoms include hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and low plasma renin activity. DOC excess syndrome is an excessive secretion of 21-hydroxyprogesterone also called 11-Deoxycorticosterone from adrenal glands and may cause mineralocorticoid hypertension. Genetics AME is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Diagnosis Other conditions such as Liddle's Syndrome can mimic the clinical features of AME, so diagnosis can be made by calculating the ratio of free urinary cortisol to free urinary cortisone. Since AME patients create less cortisone, the ratio will much be higher than non-affected patients. Alternatively, one could differentiate between the two syndromes by administering a potassium-sparing diuretic. Patients with Liddle's syndrome will only respond to a diuretic that binds the ENaC channel, whereas those with AME will respond to a diuretic that binds to ENaC or the mineralcorticoid receptor. Treatment The treatment for AME is based on the blood pressure control with Aldosterone antagonist like Spironolactone which also reverses the hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and other anti-hypertensives. Renal transplant is found curative in almost all clinical cases.AME is exceedingly rare, with fewer than 100 cases recorded worldwide. Liquorice consumption may also cause a temporary form of AME due to its ability to block 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, in turn causing increased levels of cortisol. Cessation of licorice consumption will reverse this form of AME.

Fictional character biography Timothy \\"Fitz\\" Fitzgerald was a wealthy, young urban professional until his mutant powers manifested. An uncontrollable burst of energy destroyed his apartment and killed his girlfriend, Reiko. After this, Timothy went into hiding, living on the streets. X-Men 2099 #4 He was approached by Cerebra, who gave him a card and told him to go to the Nuevo Sol Arcology, in the Nevada desert.X-Men 2099 #1 Upon his arrival, Fitz was surprised to see other mutants and other genetic outcasts socializing and enjoying themselves. He is introduced to X-Man Serpentina and then their leader Xi'an. However, Fitz notices a sniper attempting to assassinate Xi'an. He foils the attempt, but Xi'an is still injured. Tim helps the other X-Men save Xi'an and clear him of charges that he killed a Las Vegas casino mogul, Noah Synge. In the process Serpentina is killed and Tim joins the X-Men, to help create a future where mutants can live free.X-Men 2099 #1-3 Still somewhat shy and unable to fully control his powers, Tim accompanied Krystalin and Meanstreak to New York to find Meanstreak's friend, Jordan Boone, who had disappeared. Along the way, they are captured by La Lunatica and Controller Thirteen of the Theatre of Pain. Luna's powers force him to relive the memory of when his powers manifested and his girlfriend was killed. This trauma triggers his powers, shorting out the equipment around him and helping them all escape, including Luna who had been a slave of the Theatre for 10 years. This exchange also changed Timothy himself, allowing him full control over his powers and bringing him to terms with his past, making him more assertive, more daring and eventually shaping him into the leader of the X-Men. X-Men 2099 #4 After finally arriving in New York, Tim and the others find Boone, engineered into the 2099 version of the trickster god Loki, and help to take down the Alchemax created Aesir.

While searching for The Driver, on information from Mama Hurricane, they encounter La Lunatica again and she and Tim begin a relationship that would last for the remainder of the comic's run. X-Men 2099 #9-11 Tim agrees to help her escape the pursuit of the Theatre of Pain, though he is mostly ineffective against their leader, Brimstone Love, when Love attacks them at the Driver's garage. They are granted reprieve however, when Brimstone leaves instead with Xi'an, who joins the Theatre.X-Men 2099 #13 Disillusioned by his mentor's defection, Tim returns to the other X-Men, with Luna, to reform the team and lead them against the Theatre of Pain. Together they storm the Theatre's Floodgate facility in California, fighting to a stalemate and forcing Brimstone Love to retreat. As Floodgate empties, Doom, self-imposed U.S. President, arrives and hires the X-Men as the protectorate of Halo City, a new city-state in the southwest, built to be a safe-haven for mutants, degens and other victims of genetic oppression. X-Men 2099 #25 The peace was short-lived, however, as the city is almost immediately put under siege by a villain known as the Graverobber, a mutant with the ability to revive the dead as his own zombie army. In order to find the man responsible for disfiguring him, the Graverobber sends the reanimated Serpentina to kill Fitz. She succeeds and Tim is revived by Graverobber, who uses him to control the city's power.

X-Men 2099 #30 As the city begins to flood due to the encroaching Phalanx, a new villain, Vulcann, arrives to take possession of Joaquim, newborn child of Freakshow member Rosa and adopted son of Metalhead. Vulcann is a bloodsmith, with the power to alter body structure and control growth. With his power he destroys Tim's body, apparently killing him once again. However, this triggers a final mutation, reverting him to a being of pure energy. He is approached by another energy being, taking the familiar form of his former girlfriend Reiko. It invites him to join with a community of similar beings, but he declines and returns to be with Luna, as well as aid the X-Men in escaping to higher ground.X-Men 2099 #33-35 After the series cancellation in issue #35, X-Men was absorbed into the overarching title 2099: World of Tomorrow, however Timothy was not present in this imprint at all, making his fate unknown. Recently, in Civil War 2099 event (in Spider Man 2099 vol.3), Timothy returns, along with La Lunatica and Bloodhawk. The X-Men 2099 fought many heroes (including Shakti). Powers and abilities Originally Skullfire was capable of absorbing all forms of ambient energy particles into his body where he metabolized it to a usable form and then dispersed it in destructive energy blasts. He had no control over this power though and was only capable of using it during moments of great stress. Cerebra's powers allowed her to trigger his powers at will, but she had to make physical contact with him. After La Lunatica made him relive Reiko's death, Timothy could control his powers at will. While helping to free the mutant Book, it is revealed that he can also absorb mystical energies. Absorbing the energy of Halo City's powerplants gave Timothy a permanent source of power, but as a side-effect he was constantly glowing with a green light. When his body was destroyed, Timothy existed as a small sphere of energy. Timothy managed to take a form that resembled his human form. He now was capable of levitation and could absorb and channel the energy around him with far more ease and control.

The racing cars competed in Formula 3, Formula Junior and Formula Ford. The 2009 to 2012 models used engines from Toyota and Volkswagen. The only road car the company produced from 1959 to 1986 was the Melkus RS 1000. It was a sleek sports car powered by a tuned mid-mounted Wartburg 3-cylinder 2-stroke engine. Most of the cars used the 992 cc version, but some of the later cars had the 1200 cc version. It had gullwing doors. 101 cars were made. The company stopped making cars in 1986. In the early 1990s, Heinz Melkus and his family started running a BMW dealership in Dresden.

Mack started her career as a child actress in silent films, moving on to Broadway plays, and touring one of the vaudeville circuits. Her greater success as an actress was as a leading lady in the 1930s. Eventually Mack transitioned into performing on radio, and then into writing, directing, and producing some of the best known radio shows during the Golden Age of Radio. Later in life, Mack wrote for Broadway, stage, and television. Her career spanned the infancy of the motion picture industry, the beginnings of Broadway, the final days of Vaudeville, the transition to \\"talking pictures\\", the Golden Age of Radio, and the rise of television.  Youth and stage  Helen Mack, born Helen McDougall in Rock Island, Illinois, was the daughter of William George McDougall, a barber, and Regina (n√©e Lenzer) McDougall, who had a repressed desire to become an actress. She attended the Professional Children's School of New York City. Vera Gordon was a friend who helped her along as a child actress. She appeared on Broadway and in vaudeville and debuted in films at age 10 in 1925. Mack debuted on stage in The Idle Inn with Jacob Benami. She performed with Roland Young in The Idle Inn and toured America with William Hodge in Straight Through The Door.  Film actress  Her Fox Film screen test came in March 1931 and within three weeks she was on the studio lot. Mack began her film career, first billed as Helen Macks, in Success. The motion picture featured Brandon Tynan, Naomi Childers, and Mary Astor. In Zaza, Mack worked with Gloria Swanson. She also had a small role in D. W. Griffith's last film The Struggle (1931). She made her debut as a leading lady opposite Victor McLaglen in While Paris Sleeps (1932) and was cast with John Boles in his initial Fox Film venture, Scotch Valley. Mack played in several westerns in the early 1930s. Among these are Fargo Express (1933) with Ken Maynard and The California Trail with Buck Jones. Reviewer Norbert Lusk commented favorably regarding Mack's performance in the 1933 motion picture, Sweepings (1933). He said, \\"she has a lively personality, appreciated all the more in a heavy, gloomy picture, and she plays her shopgirl role with understanding and finesse.\\" Prior to this film Mack's career had declined for three years. Three of her productions failed. One reason for this career downturn is that she was usually a character star. Her employers had used Mack as an ingenue. RKO Radio Pictures Inc. offered her a second chance as Mamie Donahue in Sweepings. She may be best remembered for the 1933 movie sequel The Son of Kong, as Harold Lloyd's sister in The Milky Way (1936) and as the suicidal Molly Malloy in His Girl Friday (1940). She also played an important role as Tanya in Merian C. Cooper's production of H. Rider Haggard's She (1935) opposite Randolph Scott, Nigel Bruce, and Helen Gahagan (who did the title role as She, who must be obeyed). Other roles for Mack included the bank-robbing ingenue opposite Richard Cromwell and Lionel Atwill in 1937's The Wrong Road for RKO.  WAMPAS wrangle  In 1931, thirteen members of the Fox Film Company publicity department resigned in protest after WAMPAS (Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers) did not include a Fox starlet on their annual list of baby stars. Linda Watkins missed by one vote and Mack was a bit farther down the list of those omitted. In response Fox named Mack, Watkins, and Conchita Montenegro as rival debutantes or budding stars. Fox proposed to name baby stars for each year after, by a vote of its executives.  Later career  In the 1940s and 1950s, Mack worked as a producer and director of radio programs including such series as Richard Diamond, Private Detective, The Saint and Meet Corliss Archer. As TV succeeded radio as the prevalent entertainment medium, she continued to write plays and TV episodes until her death. In 1949, she collaborated with Roger Price in writing the children's record Gossamer Wump, narrated by Frank Morgan and released by Capitol Records. Private life Mack married lawyer Charles Irwin in San Francisco, California, in February 1935 at age 21. Irwin was a bankruptcy trustee for Fox Film West Coast Theaters. By this time Mack was under contract to Paramount Pictures. They had a son in 1936 and divorced in 1938. In 1940 she married Thomas McAvity in Santa Barbara, California. McAvity later became Vice President in Charge of Television Network for NBC. They had one son. McAvity died in 1974. In 1986, Mack died after a battle with cancer.

A Democrat, Moretti served as Speaker of the California State Assembly from 1971 to 1974. Born in Detroit, Michigan in 1936 to Marino and Mary Moretti, his family later relocated to Los Angeles when Moretti was a teenager. Moretti's father was born in Ovindoli, Italy, and his mother was of Armenian descent. Moretti graduated from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California in 1954 and went on to earn an accounting degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1958. Returning to California, Moretti was first elected to the California State Assembly in 1964 at the age of 28, making him the youngest member of the Assembly at that time. In the Assembly, Moretti represented Van Nuys. Seen as a protege of Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh, Moretti was first elected Speaker in 1971 and quickly emerged as a staunch opponent of Republican Governor Ronald Reagan. Moretti's initial resistance to Reagan, however, gave way some cooperation, particularly on the issue of welfare costs. Seeking to reach a deal, Moretti purportedly told Reagan, \\"I don't like you particularly and I know you don't like me but we don't have to be in love to work together.\\" Moretti and Reagan eventually developed a sense of mutual respect that culminated in the 1971 California Welfare Reform Act. In 1973, Moretti emerged as a leading figure in the successful campaign to defeat Reagan's Proposition 1, a ballot initiative to set state spending and taxes using formulas. Seen as a vehicle to enhance Reagan's national profile ahead of a possible run for President, Moretti and other opponents argued the proposition would force drastic cuts in state services and force local governments to raise property taxes.Daniel J.B.

Synopsis The JAC recommends candidates for appointment as judges of the High Court and to all judicial offices listed in Schedule 14 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. It also provides support for selections to fill judicial posts that lie outside its responsibilities under Schedule 14. For example, the JAC convenes panels that recommend candidates for appointment to senior posts such as the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Master of the Rolls, President of the Queen's Bench Division, President of the Family Division, Chancellor of the High Court and Lords Justices of Appeal. The JAC is not responsible for selecting justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom although a lay Commissioner does sit on the selection panel. Additionally, the Lord Chancellor may request the JAC's assistance in connection with other appointments that the Lord Chancellor considers appropriate. The JAC is a non-departmental public body which was created on 3 April 2006 through the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. It took over a responsibility previously held by the Lord Chancellor and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (previously the Lord Chancellor's Department), although the Lord Chancellor retains responsibility for appointing some selected candidates. In other cases the Lord Chief Justice or the Senior President of Tribunals makes the final appointments. The Appropriate Authority (either the Lord Chancellor, Lord Chief Justice or Senior President of Tribunals) can accept or reject a JAC recommendation, or ask the Commission to reconsider it. If the Appropriate Authority rejects a recommendation or asks for reconsideration they must provide written reasons to the JAC. Under the Constitutional Reform Act, the Lord Chancellor also lost his other judicial functions, including the right to sit as a judge in the House of Lords. The Act also established the Lord Chief Justice as head of the judiciary of England and Wales. The Act has since been amended by the Crime and Courts Act 2013. Under the Constitutional Reform Act Parliament gave the JAC the following statutory duties: * to select candidates solely on merit; * to select only people of good character; and * to have regard to the need to encourage diversity in the range of persons available for judicial selection. Members The Judicial Appointments Commission comprises 15 commissioners. Twelve, including the Chairman, are appointed through open competition, with the other three selected by the Judges' Council (two senior members of the courts judiciary) or the Tribunal Judges' Council (one senior member of the tribunals judiciary). The Chairman of the Commission must always be a lay member. Of the 14 other Commissioners: * 5 must be judicial members (of which one must be a senior tribunal judge) * 2 must be professional members (each of whom must hold a qualification listed below but must not hold the same qualification as each other*) * 5 must be lay members * 1 must be a tribunal judge * 1 must be a non-legally qualified judicial member The legal qualifications referred to are: * Barrister in England and Wales; * Solicitor of the Senior Courts of England and Wales; or * Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives The members of the Commission (as at 31 March 2015) are: Chairman: *Rt Hon.

Related bodies The Judicial Appointments Commission is separate from the Commission for Judicial Appointments (CJA). The CJA was established in March 2001 to review the procedures for the appointment of judges and QCs, and to investigate complaints into those procedures.

The village of Bang Rachan (, ) was north of Ayutthaya, the old capital of Siam, the predecessor state to modern Thailand. Today it is in Khai Bang Rachan District of Sing Buri Province. The village is remembered in Thai popular history for its resistance against the Burmese invaders in the Burmese‚ÄìSiamese War (1765‚Äì1767) that ended the Ayutthaya Kingdom. According to Thai tradition, the Burmese northern invasion army led by General Ne Myo Thihapate was held up for five months at Bang Rachan by villagers there.Wyatt, p. 117 The popular narrative cannot all be true as the entire northern campaign took just over five months (mid-August 1765 to late-January 1766), and the northern Burmese army was still stuck in Phitsanulok, in north-central Siam, as late as December 1765. Burmese sources mention \\"petty chiefs\\" (cf. \\"mueang\\") stalling the northern Burmese army's advance, but it was early in the campaign along the Wang River in northern Siam (not near Ayutthaya) during the rainy season (August‚ÄìOctober 1765). The Burmese general who was then present near Ayutthaya was not Thihapate, but rather Maha Nawrahta, whose southern army was waiting for the northern Burmese army to show up to attack the Siamese capital.Phayre, pp. 188-189 It appears that the three verified events: petty chiefs resisting Thihapate in the north, Thihapate's campaign period of five months, and Maha Nawrahta dawdling near Ayutthaya‚Äîhave merged to create this Siamese mythology. The Thai narrative is now an ingrained part of Thai popular culture. The 2000 Thai film Bang Rajan dramatizes the Thai version of events. One of the more iconic images is that of Nai Thong Min, who becomes drunk and furiously rides a gigantic water buffalo into battle against the Burmese. The public memory of the battle has been likened to that of the Battle of the Alamo in the minds of Americans. Historical revisionism Monument of eleven leaders of Khai Bang Rachan In 1767, Burmese armies entered Siam. Burmese accounts describe the invasion as having a deliberate and predetermined ambition, credited to King Mang Ra. Other sources and analysts of the period, most notably Damrong Rajanubhab, the father of Thai history, consider this to be historical revisionism and believe that the Burmese did not initially invade with the intention of permanent conquest nor with any designs on Ayutthaya itself. Burmese forces encountered little resistance from the Siamese and advanced close to the capital, but hesitated to attack due to their uncertainty regarding the strength of the forces to be faced. There was much raiding of the surrounding countryside and, contrary to the general policy which required the submission of the Siamese, they demanded the unmarried daughters of the local populace as well, a policy which provoked the Siamese people to resistance. The beginning of the resistance and the first notable accounts of Bang Rachan occurred when a group of Siamese villagers from various villages‚Äînotably Sibuathong, Pho Krap, and Pho Thale‚Äîled by Nai Thaen, Nai Chote, Nai Inn, Nai Muang, Nai Thong Kauo, and Nai Dok Mai lured a group of Burmese soldiers into the forest with the promise of rescuing the women who were held captive and then turned upon the soldiers, killing the entire group of twenty. After this they retreated to Bang Rachan, where most of the population of the villages of Mueang Wiset Chaichan, Mueang Sing, and Mueang San had fled. Bang Rachan is described as being ideally suited to defense: \\"A place where foodstuffs were plentiful...a village on high ground and ... difficult for the enemy to get at.\\" In addition to its ideal situation and its swelling numbers, Bang Rachan had at this point approximately 400 fighting men. They had 11 leaders (Nai Thong Min, Nai Panreuang, Nai Thong Saeng Yai, Nai Chan Nuad Keao, Nai Thaen, Nai Chote, Nai Inn, Nai Muang, Nai Thong Kauo, Nai Dok Mai and Nai Khun Sun) and had worked on making fortifications. A Buddhist priest, Thammachot, had been invited into the village monastery where he was held in great veneration by the villagers. They believed him to have great powers and knowledge of spells, charms, and incantations. The Burmese leaders camped at Mueang Wiset Chaichan, were aware of the slaughter of their men by the Siamese who had fled to Bang Rachan and sent a small force of about 100 men to capture them. The Burmese were taken by surprise when they were attacked while resting and were almost entirely wiped out by the force led by Nai Thaen, who had been elected leader of Bang Rachan. News of this victory spread quickly across the country and resulted in more people coming out of hiding to join the resistance movement, swelling the ranks camped within Bang Rachan to 1,000 fighting men. This amateur force was organized along the lines of a professional military unit, but were disadvantaged by their lack of equipment, especially firearms. Aware that he was facing heavy resistance, the Burmese leader at Wiset Chaichan requested reinforcements before sending another force against the village. But again he underestimated the village's resolve, as a second, 500-strong Burmese attacking force was routed. A third attack, again greater in numbers and under a new leader, was similarly defeated. A pivotal event occurred during the fourth attack on the village by a force of 1,000 Burmese under Surin Chokhong. This force was not immediately defeated by the Siamese villagers, but their commander was killed and after much fighting the villagers retreated. Instead of seizing their advantage, the Burmese force lowered its guard to begin preparing food and caring for the corpse of their commander. Seeing this, the villagers quickly returned to the field and the surprised Burmese force was defeated and lost most of its troops. While victorious again, the leader of Bang Rachan, Nai Thaen, was shot in the knee, an event which would have grave consequences for the resistance. The aftermath of this fourth battle saw both sides receive reinforcements, with the leaders selecting a new leader out of the eleven to replace Nai Thaen, who had become Nai Chan Nuad Keao, who was famed for his ferocity and \\"bristling moustache\\". The fortunes of Bang Rachan remained positive under Nai Chan Nuad Keao, who the forces increase and achieve ever greater levels of organization. Bang Rachan's reputation grew to such an extent that the Burmese came to fear them and the leaders had trouble recruiting troops to attack the village. After seven attacks and seven defeats, an eighth force, under a Mon commander who had lived in Siam, volunteered to take an army and defeat Bang Rachan. What set this commander apart from the previous Burmese leadership was his knowledge of the land and the Siamese and his lack of arrogance. He did not underestimate the villagers. He adjusted his tactics to disadvantage them. He inched slowly towards the village, building a series of forts along the route and, when faced with the villagers, refused to fight except from within fortress walls. A lack of artillery was now crippling the villagers, as they could not reduce the Burmese forts without it. They suffered great losses from infantry assaults. One of the Siamese leaders, Nai Thong Min, got drunk and, furious, mounted a water buffalo, to attack the Burmese with a small force in what remains one of the iconic images of Bang Rachan. He was killed and his men routed, the first defeat of the villagers by the Burmese. Bang Rachan pleaded for help from Ayutthaya. They asked for cannons they could deploy against the forts, but the Ayutthaya showed the indifference typical of its actions throughout the war. They refused the request. One man, Phraya Rattanathibet, was sent to help villagers forge their own weapons. The guns they cast cracked and were useless. Soon after this, Nai Then died of the wound to his knee and the other leaders, Nai Chan Nuad Keao and Nai Khun San, had succumbed to their wounds they had sustained when trying to take down the Burmese forts. 4 out of the 11 leaders had died and now the village was by now dispirited and hopeless, and faced a siege by the Burmese in the form of cannon fire, siege towers, and tunneling under village walls. Saldly, the village was routed despite its resistance to the very end, five months after its first act of resistance. It was the only successful opposition by Siamese forces in a war characterized by the failure of Ayutthaya, its professional armies, and its generals. A battle monument is 13 kilometers southwest of the town on Route 3032 in Khai Bang Rachan District. Bang Rachan in film Two Thai films about Bang Rachan have been made. One was in 1966 and it starred Sombat Metanee. Better known is the 2000 film by director Thanit Jitnukul and starring Winai Kraibutr. Oliver Stone adopted the film and \\"presented\\" screenings of it in the United States in 2004.

It is wide and long and covers an area of . The lake is partly fed by the Ou√©m√© River and the S√¥ River, both of which deposit sediments from throughout the region in the lake. The city of Cotonou sits on the southern border of the lake. Sections of the population of Cotonou have been displaced by coastal and lake flooding.

Economy  Mennonite missionary in a dugout canoe, similar to the ones used by local artisanal fishermen Because of its diverse wildlife, the lake provides an important source of food and economic activity for these towns. Fishing is best when water is low between November and June. Fishing is typically of 30 species of fish, with fish from the Cichlid, Clupeidae and Penaeidae families making 85% of the catch. The fishery became more stressed during the 1990s, as more people began fishing on the lake. Fishing is typically artisanal, with small crew dugout canoes catching small batches of fish. The estimated fish production of the lake is 2 tonnes per hectare per year. The lake is also used for Acadja, a type of fish breeding facility.  Hydrology  The lake, in large part, is a lagoon. With the surrounding low-lying topography, the lake is expected to double in size and flood as the current global climate change gradually affects the sea level. This development carries a risk of future salinisation, which will make the freshwater lake more brackish and potentially change its ecology. Different sections of the lake currently alternate between freshwater and brackish ecosystems at an average depth of . Normal temperatures throughout the lake are between . The lake is a site of deposition of both pesticides and heavy metals from upstream industry and human habitation. Though the pesticides are only present in fish at less than toxic levels, the heavy metals in the waters can reach levels in fish both unhealthy for humans and the fish.The lake village of Ganvie on its northern shore  Geology  The floor of the lake is a mixture of sand, muddy-sand and mud layers.

The term was first coined in 1883 by Fritz Hommel.The Semitic Languages: An International Handbook, Chapter V, page 425Fritz Hommel, Die semitischen Volker und Sprachen als erster Versuch einer Encyclopadie der semitischen Sprach- und Alterthums-Wissenschaft, (1883) The grouping, supported by Semiticists like Robert Hetzron and John Huehnergard, divides the Semitic language family into two branches: Eastern and Western. The East Semitic languages consist of the extinct Eblaite and Akkadian languages, while the remaining majority of Semitic languages form the West Semitic languages grouping. It consists of the clearly defined sub-groups: Modern South Arabian, Old South Arabian, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Northwest Semitic (this including Hebrew, Aramaic, and the extinct Amorite and Ugaritic languages). Ethiopic and South Arabian show particular common features, and are often grouped together as South Semitic. The proper classification of Arabic with respect to other Semitic languages is debated. In older classifications, it is grouped with the South Semitic languages. However, Hetzron and Huehnergard connect it more closely with the Northwest Semitic languages, to form Central Semitic. Some Semiticists continue to argue for the older classification, based on the distinctive feature of broken plurals. Some linguists also argue that Eteocypriot was a Northwest Semitic language spoken in ancient Cyprus.

Co-dydramol tablets are used for the relief of moderate pain. Co-dydramol is part of a series of combination drugs available in the UK and other countries including co-codaprin (aspirin and codeine). Formulations All formulations of co-dydramol contain 500 mg of paracetamol per tablet and may only be sold at a pharmacy as an over-the-counter item without prescription (a P medicine) if containing less than 7.5 mg of dihydrocodeine per tablet. Higher strengths are prescription only medicines. There are no GSL formulations of co-dydramol, as it is a Schedule 5 controlled drug. Four strengths of dihydrocodeine tartrate in each tablet are available: * 7.46 mg dihydrocodeine as co-dydramol 7.46/500 (e.g. in the branded product Paramol). * 10 mg dihydrocodeine as co- dydramol 10/500, this is also the preparation to be dispensed if no strength is specified on a prescription. * 20 mg dihydrocodeine as co-dydramol 20/500 (e.g. branded products Paracod 500/20 and Remedeine). * 30 mg dihydrocodeine as co-dydramol 30/500 (e.g. branded products Paracod 500/30 and Remedeine Forte). Metabolism Dihydrocodeine is metabolised by the CYP450 system isoenzyme 2D6 to dihydromorphine, which mediates the majority of its analgesic effects. Owing to the low oral bioavailibility of dihydrocodeine (20%), and its subsequent metabolism to active compounds, it is likely that doses below 30mg are sub therapeutic for analgesia.

Newham Parks Constabulary was established in 1998, with thirteen constables headed by a Senior Parks Constable. In 2001, following the departure of the Senior Constable, the new grade of Sergeant was created and three constables promoted to it. In 2004 the service was reformed by the Newham Council, headed by Sir Robin Wales in the newly created office of directly elected mayor. The service was renamed the Newham Community Constabulary and an Inspector was appointed to head the service. In July 2009 the Constabulary was disbanded. The service had forty employees: one Inspector, six Sergeants, and thirty three Constables. Members of the constabulary were sworn as constables under section 18, Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provision Order Confirmation (Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967. This gave the constables the powers and privileges of a constable to enforce by-laws in relation to parks and open spaces under their control. They had no constabulary powers to enforce criminal law and should not have been be mistaken for police officers. Once they left the clearly identified parks areas, they had no legal powers to enforce by-laws, indeed an official report into their activities concluded that \\"Even in the parks they cannot arrest for offences under other legislation such as the Theft Act or the Criminal Damage Act ‚Äì other than as a private citizen.\\" Any serious incidents and crimes in the parks were dealt with by the Metropolitan Police Service. Following a number of allegations into corruption, racism and abuse of non-existent police powers the constabulary was subject to an investigation. An official report identified that the use of titles such as sergeant and constable was misleading as members of the service are council workers rather than police officers and it has been recommended that those titles are changed to reflect their actual status and powers. An official report concluded that those responsible for Parks Constables need to be careful that their staff do not describe themselves as police or that any uniform they wear is not so similar to that of the Police to cause confusion in the minds of the public. This comment was echoed by Liberty, who felt that the use of police forms by those council employees might cause members of the public to confuse them with police officers.

He eventually became a leading assistant director. He was an assistant director to Mark Robson on The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958), Terence Young on Serious Charge (1959) with Cliff Richard, Terry Bishop on Cover Girl Killer (1959), Guy Hamilton on A Touch of Larceny (1960), Jack Cardiff on Sons and Lovers (1960), Tony Richardson on The Entertainer (1960) and A Taste of Honey (1961), J.

Yates had seen the original Royal Court production of N.F. Simpson's play One Way Pendulum and got the job of making the film version released in 1964. It was produced by Michael Deeley. The movie was not widely seen.Michael Deeley, Blade Runners, Deer Hunters and Blowing the Bloody Doors Off: My Life in Cult Movies, Pegasus Books, 2009 p 27-29Engel Will 'Move' Burma to Thailand: Beatty Slips Self 'Mickey'; Richardson Sets Pendulum Scheuer, Philip K.

Yates' third feature as director was the heist film Robbery (1967), a fictionalised version of the Great Train Robbery of 1963 starring Stanley Baker and produced by Deeley. =Bullitt and Hollywood= Robbery was a critical success in the US and led to an offer to direct Bullitt (1968), of which Bruce Weber has written, \\"Mr. Yates‚Äôs reputation probably rests most securely on Bullitt (1968), his first American film ‚Äì and indeed, on one particular scene, an extended car chase that instantly became a classic.\\" Yates later said, \\"In Hollywood back then, everyone knew a British director couldn't do action, so I think the studio had another motive in letting me come over.

Yates did another heist film, The Hot Rock (1972), based on a novel by Donald Westlake starring Robert Redford from a William Goldman script. After this he was going to make The Leatherstocking Saga and Jonathan Schwartz's Almost Home but neither was made.Tell Them Polonsky Is Here Again By A. H. WEILER. New York Times 30 May 1971: D11. In 1972 he signed a four picture deal with Paramount which was to start with Deadly Edge from a Westlake novel.Life With Father Hitler By A. H. WEILER. New York Times 21 May 1972: D15. Yates stayed with crime with The Friends of Eddie Coyle (1973) starring Robert Mitchum. He then did two comedies: For Pete's Sake (1974) with Barbra Streisand, and Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976); he produced the latter along with writer Tom Mankiewicz. Yates had a big commercial success with the adventure film The Deep (1977), where Mankiewicz did some uncredited writing. =Breaking Away= Yates used his clout from The Deep to raise finance for Breaking Away (1979), written by Steve Tesich, whose play The Passing Game, Yates had directed in New York. Yates produced and directed the film. Breaking Away was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Film for Yates. It led to a short-lived TV series that Yates also produced.A Hot Director Breaks Away From the Mainstream By SHAUN CONSIDINE. New York Times 15 July 1979: D17. Yates and Tesich were reunited on the thriller Eyewitness (1981) starring William Hurt. He tried fantasy with Krull (1983), but it was not a success at the box office. =The Dresser= Yates also produced and directed The Dresser (1983), an adaptation of the Ronald Harwood stage play. The film received seven BAFTA and five Oscar nominations, including the BAFTA Award for Best Film and for Best Direction and the Academy Award for Best Film and for Best Director for Yates. The Dresser was also entered into the 34th Berlin International Film Festival. Along with Eddie Coyle and Breaking Away, The Dresser was one of Yates' three favourite films. \\"I'm ambitious in my own way,\\" said Yates around this time. \\"I don't crave power. I really wouldn't want to trade places with anyone, not even Steven Spielberg. Look at what power can do to a gifted director like Robert Altman. It isn't necessarily healthy.

Yates' final film was A Separate Peace (2004) Yates has two distinct styles: one used for his thriller, action and drama projects which frequently reflects on the principal character's state of alienation with a humanistic perspective and another expressive and sentimental style which focuses on the moral dilemmas of the characters, predominantly seen in his coming-of-age and other dramatic films.http://www.theyshootpictures.com \\"I think there's probably some truth in the theory that I prefer heroes who fight against adversity and make it through from being the underdog to winning,\\" said Yates. =Death= Yates died from heart failure in London on 9 January 2011.

Location It is situated on the south-east of the city, south-west of the seaside area of Portobello, and west of Musselburgh in East Lothian near Fort Kinnaird retail park. History The place name is believed to be of Brythonic origin, *nuada tref meaning \\"new settlement\\". It was known historically as Niddry Marischal. The Wauchope family owned the majority of the area up to the 1930s. In the 1590s Archibald Wauchope of Niddrie was a supporter of the rebel Earl of Bothwell.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1593-1595, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 164. The family home Niddrie Marischal House was immediately west of the present day Jack Kane Centre sports complex in Hunters Hall Park. The Wauchopes eventually donated their lands to the city. In 1839 John Henderson designed the lodge and gates to the Mansion. The House was demolished although the vaulted tomb-house, which adjoined the western extension, remains as a listed building. Social housing was built in Niddrie Mains by Edinburgh Corporation from 1927 until the mid-1930s, under the designs of City Architect, Ebenezer James MacRae. The new housing was linked to a major slum clearance scheme in the St. Leonard's Ward of Edinburgh. Families from these cleared areas were housed together with local coal mining families from Niddrie. The Niddrie Mains estate is now almost completely demolished, with no attempts made to recondition the buildings. The land has been mostly designated for private housing. The land that occupied most of the social housing in the community is being regenerated. The site is currently being developed by PARC, an ALMO or Arms Length Management Organisation, fully owned by the City of Edinburgh Council. The development includes a new primary school for the surrounding area, with the old Niddrie Mill Primary School and St Francis Primary School being put in a joint campus. The first, though unassociated, phase of redevelopment in the Niddrie Mains area was the Hays area, constructed around 2001 and consisting of two-storey blocks with gardens and pedestrianised streets. Crime In the 1980s and 1990s, Niddrie suffered from a high crime rate. Antisocial behaviour is fairly common, though gang fights and knife crime are of a lesser degree today compared to the levels recorded in the 1980s and 1990s. During the 1980s, Niddrie was one of the most drug-riddled communities in Scotland, and still has problems with class A drug use today. For a number of years, the area has had problems with joyriding and youngsters stealing cars and motorbikes. Nearby Greendykes and Niddrie Mains was ranked as the fourth-most deprived area in Scotland in the 2006 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation Transport Niddrie once had its own railway station, on the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway. Today the nearest stations are at and , both located on Edinburgh Crossrail and Borders Railway.

The film was Garfield's last, as accusations of his involvement with the Communist Party and a refusal to name names while testifying before the HUAC led to his blacklisting in Hollywood. He died less than a year later, at age thirty-nine, from coronary thrombosis due to a blood clot blocking an artery in his heart. During the film's initial run, director John Berry and writers Dalton Trumbo and Hugo Butler were uncredited due to Hollywood blacklisting during the Red Scare. Plot Petty thief Nick Robey (John Garfield) botches a robbery, leaving his partner Al (Norman Lloyd) severely wounded as Nick escapes with over $10,000. Meeting bakery worker Peg Dobbs (Shelley Winters) in friendly conversation, when Peg takes Nick to her family's apartment, he decides to take the family hostage until he can escape. As a manhunt for Nick begins outside, the robber becomes increasingly paranoid. Peg's initial attraction to Nick is overwhelmed by his abusive behavior. Her mother and father plead with Nick to leave, to no avail. He permits Mr. Dobbs to leave for work, warning him of the consequences should the police be contacted. Still confident that Peg will run away with him, Nick gives her $1,500 to buy a new car. He refuses to believe her when Peg returns and insists the car will be delivered to the front door because she doesn't drive. Nick violently drags her down the stairs toward the exit, terrifying her. Waiting outside is her father, shooting at Nick with a gun. When his own gun drops beyond his reach and Nick orders Peg to hand it to him, she shoots him instead.

He makes a most odd and troubled creature, unused to the normal flow of life, unable to perceive the moral standards of decent people or the tentative advance of a good girl's love. And in Mr. Garfield's performance, vis-a-vis the rest of the cast, is conveyed a small measure of the irony and the pity that was in the book.\\"Crowther, Bosley.

More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz also wrote positively of Garfield's performance, writing: \\"He Ran All the Way was the last film made by the brilliant John Garfield ... Garfield gives a terrific chilling performance as someone who is less like a cold-blooded killer than someone who has been rejected all his life by family and the outside world, and like a wounded animal goes on the run as a desperate man in search of someone to trust in this cold world.\\"Schwartz, Dennis .

John Amory Lowell 1798-1881 Hon. John Amory Lowell (November 11, 1798 ‚Äì October 31, 1881) was an American businessman and philanthropist from Boston. He became the sole trustee of the Lowell Institute when his first cousin, John Lowell, Jr. (1799-1836), the Institute's endower, died. (Lowell 1899, pp 117‚Äì118) Lowell, Delmar. (1899) The Historic Genealogy of the Lowells of America from 1639 to 1899, Rutland VT: The Tuttle Company. .  Family  John Amory, the second child of John Lowell, Jr (1769-1840) and Rebecca Amory (1771-1842), was among the first generation of Lowells to be born in Boston, and the fifth generation to be born in America. His father maintained a well-established law firm in the city, and three years after John Amory's birth, retired for reasons of his failing health. After retiring in 1801, the elder Lowell spent much of his time and wealth patronizing the burgeoning horticultural society in Boston, so much so that he became known to his friends and family as \\"The Norfolk Farmer.\\" John Amory Lowell's paternal grandfather, also named John Lowell (1743-1802) but referred to as \\"The Old Judge,\\" was a Federal Judge appointed by President George Washington and is considered to be the founding father of the Boston Lowells. (Greenslet 1946) Greenslet, Ferris. (1946) The Lowells and Their Seven Worlds, Boston: Houghton Mifflin. . Like his father and grandfathers before him, Lowell would be the fourth member in his family line to graduate from Harvard College in 1815, at the age of 17. After spending an extended time traveling through Europe and then establishing himself as a successful merchant in Boston, Lowell married his first wife, Susan Cabot Lowell (1801-1827), a daughter of his uncle, Francis Cabot Lowell. Together, they would have two children, Susan Cabot and John. Lowell's wife died during childbirth in 1827. Their son, John, would be appointed to the U.S. District Court in 1865 by President Abraham Lincoln, and in 1878, appointed to the U.S. Circuit Court by President Rutherford B. Hayes. John Amory's grandson, James Arnold Lowell, would also go on to become a Federal Judge. Lowell's wife, Susan Cabot, who was a great-granddaughter of Edward and Dorthy (Quincy) Jackson, would connect their children and their descendants to those of the Holmeses of Boston, a family that includes poet Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., and U.S. Supreme Court justice and Civil War hero, Hon. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. With his second wife, Elizabeth Cabot Putnam (1807-1881), Amory fathered a son and three daughters. Augustus, Elizabeth Rebecca, Ellen Bancroft, and Sara Putnam. Augustus Lowell would become a very successful businessman and eventually succeed Lowell as the second trustee of the Lowell Institute. John Amory's grandchildren, through Elizabeth Cabot, included author and astronomer Percival Lowell, Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, and poet Amy Lowell. Merrimack Manufacturing Co., Lowell, Massachusetts  Career  In 1835 and 1838, John Amory became the first Treasurer for both Merrimack Manufacturing Company and Boott Cotton Mill, textile mills in Lowell, Massachusetts. And in 1857, he became Director of The Winnipiseogee Lake Cotton and Woolen Manufacturing Company. All positions his son, Augustus, would succeed to within the same companies. (Bay State Monthly 1884) Bay State Monthly, Vol. I, No. 3, March, 1884 Lowell was a Fellow of Harvard College (1837-1877), a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the Linnean Society of London. Later, in 1851, Harvard would honor John Amory with an LLD. = Lowell Institute = The trust‚Äîor Lowell Institute, as it came to be known‚Äîhad an unusual mode of governance: a single trustee who was empowered to appoint his successor and who was, in the language of John Lowell, Jr.'s will, to \\"always choose in preference to all others some male descendant of my grandfather, John Lowell, provided there be one who is competent to hold the office of trustee, and of the name of Lowell.\\" (Everett 1840) Everett, Edward. (1840) A Memoir of Mr. John Lowell, delivered Dec 31, 1839 at the Introduction to the Lectures on His Foundation at the Odeon, Boston: Little Brown Despite this odd restriction (or perhaps because of it), the Institute proved to be an extraordinarily innovative philanthropic force. Under John Amory, its first trustee, the Institute flourished. Lowell was both a man of extraordinary financial acumen and a man of high intellect. The list of Lowell Lecturers during his tenure was a veritable pantheon of the most internationally celebrated figures in science, literature, politics, economics, philosophy, and theology, including Britain's most celebrated geologist, Sir Charles Lyell, Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz, and novelists Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray.

Looking towards Crewe Toll roundabout from Telford Road The area takes its name from the Toll house which once stood at the junction of Ferry Road and Crewe Road North and South. The name Crewe, or a variation thereof (Creue, Crew or Crou), can be identified on maps as early as those from John Adair's 17th century survey, indicating that a farm stood southeast of the present Crewe Toll. \\"Toll\\" is shown on Gellatly's \\"New Map of the country 12 miles round Edinburgh\\" published in 1834. The 1853 and 1913 OS maps show a 'smithy' at the junction. All buildings on the junction disappeared when it was enlarged at some point in the 1920s to take the additional traffic from the newly-constructed Telford Road. The Western General Hospital is in the vicinity. Another hospital, the Northern General, was also in the area but this is now the site of a Morrisons supermarket. Edinburgh's Telford College (tertiary) was at Crewe Toll, but has moved to a site at Granton. Fettes College (private, secondary) is close by. A major aerospace facility is situated in the area, the Leonardo S.p.A. facility that dates to a 1943 Ferranti factory originally set up to produce gyro gunsights for the Supermarine Spitfire that later became a major radar development site. The site changed hands repeatedly, from Ferranti to GEC- Ferranti, then GEC-Marconi, then BAE Systems, then SELEX Sensors and Airborne Systems, then SELEX Galileo and finally Leonardo. The location was the site of a junction on the Caledonian Railway. This junction was spelled 'Crew' up until closure in the 1960s, long after the spelling 'Crewe' was settled as the area built up. Some nearby Edinburgh districts include Craigleith, Pilton, Inverleith, and Silverknowes.

Delivery of the Tu-16 to China began in 1958, and the Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (XAC) signed a licence production agreement with the USSR to build the type in the late 1950s. The first Chinese Tu-16, or \\"H-6\\" as it was designated in Chinese service, flew in 1959. Production was performed by the plant at Xi'an, with at least 150 built into the 1990s. China is estimated to currently operate around 120 of the aircraft.. The latest version is the H-6N, a heavily redesigned version capable of aerial refueling and carrying air-launched cruise missiles. According to United States Department of Defense, this will give the PLAAF a long-range standoff offensive air capability with precision-guided munitions.https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/china-shows- off-h-6n-hypersonics-and-gyrocopters-461186/ Design and development The first domestically produced H-6 was completed in 1968 and evidence of bombing training was recorded by U.S. spy satellites on August 13, 1971. By March of the following year, the CIA estimated that the PRC had 32 aircraft operational with an additional 19 awaiting completion. The H-6 was used to drop nine nuclear devices at the Lop Nur test site. However, with the increased development in ballistic missile technology, the nuclear delivery capabilities that the H-6 offered diminished in importance. The CIA estimated in 1976 that the H-6 had moved over to a dual nuclear/conventional bombing role. =Developed versions= PLANAF HY-6U with aerial refuelling pods (2018) \\"The most distinct difference between HY-6U and HY-6D is that HY-6U has a metal nose cone,while HY-6D still has the transparent glass nose\\" Along with the H-6 free-fall bomber, an \\"H-6A\\" nuclear bomber was built, as well as an \\"H-6B\\" reconnaissance variant, \\"H-6C\\" conventional bomber and \\"H-6E\\" nuclear bomber with improved countermeasures, the \\"H-6D\\" antiship missile carrier, and the \\"HY-6\\" series capable of acting as an in-flight fuel tanker. The H-6D was introduced in the early 1980s and carried a C-601 antishipping missile (NATO codename \\"Silkworm\\"), an air-launched derivative of the Soviet P-15 Termit (\\"Styx\\") under each wing. The H-6D featured various modernized systems and sports an enlarged radome with a Type 245 Kobalt I-band surveillance radar under the nose. The Type 245 radar was based on the Soviet PSBN-M-8 NATO codename Mushroom radar used on the Tupolev Tu-16. Earlier versions (Type 241, 242 and 244) were installed on the early models of the H-6. The H-6 has also been used as a tanker and drone launcher. Later H-6 production featured extended curved wingtips. Many H-6A and H-6C aircraft were updated in the 1990s to the \\"H-6F\\" configuration, the main improvement being a modern navigation system, with a Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite constellation receiver, Doppler navigation radar, and inertial navigation system. New production began in the 1990s as well, with Xian building the \\"H-6G\\", which is a director for ground-launched cruise missiles; the \\"H-6H\\", which carries two land-attack cruise missiles. In terms of land attack cruise missiles five immediate possibilities were considered by PLAAF - the indigenous HN-1, HN-2 and HN-3, DH-10/CJ-10, and a variant of Russian designed cruise missile. It is believed CJ-10 is chosen to be the main land attack missile for H-6 bombers, and now the \\"H-6M\\" cruise missile carrier, which has four pylons for improved cruise missiles and is fitted with a terrain- following system. Apparently these variants have no internal bomb capability, and most or all of their defensive armament has been deleted. =H-6K= The H-6K, first flying on January 5, 2007, entered service in October 2009 during the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, and is claimed to make China the fourth country with a strategic bomber after US, Russia and the United Kingdom. With a reinforced structure making use of composite materials, enlarged engine inlets for Russian Soloviev D-30 turbofan engines giving a claimed combat radius of , a glass cockpit with large size LCD multi-function display, and a reworked nose section eliminating the glazed navigator's station in favour of a more powerful radar, the H-6K is a significantly more modern aircraft than earlier versions. Six underwing hardpoints for CJ-10A cruise missiles are added. The rear 23 mm guns and gunner position are replaced by electronic components. The H-6K is designed for long-range attacks and stand-off attacks. It is capable of attacking US carrier battle groups and priority targets in Asia. This aircraft has nuclear strike capability. While previous models had limited missile capacity (the H-6G could only carry two YJ-12 anti-ship missiles and the H-6M two KD-20/CJ-10K/CJ-20 land attack cruise missiles), the H-6K can carry up to six YJ-12 and 6-7 ALCMs; a single regiment of 18 H-6Ks fully loaded out with YJ-12s can saturate enemy ships with over 100 supersonic missiles. Although the aircraft has a new nose radome housing a modern air-to-ground radar, it is not clear if the bomber or other Chinese assets yet have the capability to collect accurate targeting information for successful strikes against point targets in areas beyond the first island chain.Jeffrey Lin and P.W. Singer, \\"China Shows Off Its Deadly New Cruise Missiles\\" , Popular Science, 10 March 2015The H-6K Is China‚Äôs B-52 - Warisboring.com, 8 July 2015 An electro-optical targeting system is fitted under the nose. In January 2009, it was reported that an indigenous turbofan engine, the WS-18 (Soloviev D-30 copy), was under development for use in the H-6K. In 2015, about 15 H-6Ks were in service. A H-6K fitted with a refuelling probe may have first flown in December 2016. Besides extending range, a possible mission for the variant may be to launch satellites or ballistic missiles. Defense Intelligence Agency chief Ashley confirmed that China is developing two new air-launched ballistic missiles, (CH-AS-X-13) one of which can carry a nuclear warhead. The H-6K would be suited to launch such missiles. In January 2019, Norinco announced it had tested an analogous of the American \\"Mother of all Bombs.\\" The weapon is carried by an H-6K and takes up the whole of the bomb bay, making it roughly long and weighing 10 tons.

History In 1956 designers Frank Davies, John Gibson, Frank Newfeld, and Leslie (Sam) Smart met in Toronto to form the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC). In 1968 the organization changed its name to the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada (GDC) with the Federal Charter approved on in 1976, unifying the country under one national association. In 1996 GDC‚Äôs five Ontario Chapters combined to form the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario and received provincial legislation granting them authority to use the title of Registered Graphic Designer and the R.G.D. designation within the province of Ontario.

Technical Illustration is illustration meant to visually communicate information of a technical nature. Technical illustrations can be components of technical drawings or diagrams. Technical illustrations in general aim \\"to generate expressive images that effectively convey certain information via the visual channel to the human observer\\".Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gr√∂ller (2005). \\"Smart Visibility in Visualization\\". In: Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.) Technical illustrations generally have to describe and explain the subjects to a nontechnical audience. Therefore, the visual image should be accurate in terms of dimensions and proportions, and should provide \\"an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer‚Äôs interest and understanding\\". Types perspective. Conventional line illustration of an engine demonstrating perspective and line techniques. Illustration of a drum set. =Types of communication= Today, technical illustration can be broken down into three categories based on the type of communication: * Communication with the general public: informs the general public, for example illustrated instructions found in the manuals for automobiles and consumer electronics. This type of technical illustration contains simple terminology and symbols that can be understood by the lay person and is sometimes called creative technical illustration/graphics. * Specialized engineering or scientific communication: used by engineers/scientists to communicate with their peers and in specifications. This use of technical illustration has its own complex terminology and specialized symbols; examples are the fields of atomic energy, aerospace and military/defense. These areas can be further broken down into disciplines of mechanical, electrical, architectural engineering and many more. * Communication between highly skilled experts: used by engineers to communicate with people who are highly skilled in a field, but who are not engineers. Examples of this type of technical illustration are illustrations found in user/operator documentation. These illustrations can be very complex and have jargon and symbols not understood by the general public, such as illustrations that are part of instructional materials for operating CNC machinery. =Types of drawings= Main types of drawings in technical communication are: * conventional line drawings, * exploded view drawings, * cutaway drawings, and * clip art images Techniques Technical illustration uses several basic mechanical drawing configurations called axonometric projection. These are: * Parallel projections (oblique, planometric, isometric, dimetric, and trimetric), and * many types of perspective projections (with one, two, or three vanishing points). Technical illustration and computer-aided design can also use 3D and solid-body projections, such as rapid prototyping. *In the natural sciences, \\"scientific illustration\\" refers to a style of drawing using stippling and simple line techniques to convey information with a minimum of artistic interpretation.

It is an owned-and-operated station of the Telefe television network. History The Telefe Tucum√°n studios Canal 8 signed on in 1983. It was one of the members of the Televisi√≥n Federal, S.A., consortium, that acquired the license for channel 11 Buenos Aires when it was privatized in 1989. In 2018, all of Telefe's stations in interior Argentina dropped their channel number branding to go by \\"Telefe (city)\\", including Canal 8, which became Telefe Tucum√°n; this was done in preparation for the end of analog television. =Local programming= Within a few months of beginning transmission, Canal 8 aired its first newscast, called 12 Minutos (12 Minutes). The newscast eventually was changed to a one-hour show, and the name was changed to Divisi√≥n Noticias (News Division). Canal 8 presents music programs such as Conexi√≥n Videos, Musica Libre (Free Music), and Elegidos (Elected), which aired from 1987 to 2008. It has produced series for children and teens such as El Jard√≠n de Florencia Flor (Florencia Flor's Garden), El Payaso Tapal√≠n (The Tapal√≠n Clown), and Tevematch. Commented Third Time is the first sports show of the channel. Canal 8 was the first channel in the province to air live sporting events. In the early 1990s the station showed a miniseries set in the Tucum√°n of the 17th Century called 100 A√±os Despu√©s (After 100 Years). =National programming= Canal 8 was the first channel in the area to rebroadcast news programs from Buenos Aires such as 28 Millones (later called 30 millones), Realidad 84 (Reality 84), Redacci√≥n Abierta (Open Drafting), and Buenas Noches Argentina (Good Night Argentina).

Dongier received his medical degree in Marseille in 1951 and took his training at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Quebec, receiving his diploma in psychiatry from McGill University in 1954. (PDF) He was a pioneer in providing psychiatric services to remote communities, using his own private plane to reach them. (PDF) Dongier also flew his plane from Montreal to St. Kitts with a colleague to study the behavior of alcoholic monkeys there, whose behavior is similar to that of people with alcohol abuse problems. Dongier held positions at the Universit√© de Marseille (France) and the Universit√© de Li√®ge (Belgium). On his return from Europe in 1971, he went back to McGill as director of the Allan Memorial Institute and also served as Psychiatrist-in-Chief for the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal. Dongier was also the chairman of McGill's Department of Psychiatry from 1974 to 1985. (PDF) in French Dongier was honored in 2002 by an award named for him: the Maurice Dongier Training Award; the award is for psychiatric clinical research training. In 2005, he was awarded an Emeritus Professorship in psychiatry by McGill University. Dongier is well known for his research in alcohol abuse and work in alcohol abuse research.

More precisely, for any complete theory T in a language we write I(T, Œ±) for the number of models of T (up to isomorphism) of cardinality Œ±. The spectrum problem is to describe the possible behaviors of I(T, Œ±) as a function of Œ±. It has been almost completely solved for the case of a countable theory T. Early results In this section T is a countable complete theory and Œ∫ is a cardinal. The L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem shows that if I(T,Œ∫) is nonzero for one infinite cardinal then it is nonzero for all of them. Morley's categoricity theorem was the first main step in solving the spectrum problem: it states that if I(T,Œ∫) is 1 for some uncountable Œ∫ then it is 1 for all uncountable Œ∫. Robert Vaught showed that I(T,‚Ñµ0) cannot be 2. It is easy to find examples where it is any given non-negative integer other than 2. Morley proved that if I(T,‚Ñµ0) is infinite then it must be ‚Ñµ0 or ‚Ñµ1 or 2‚Ñµ0. It is not known if it can be ‚Ñµ1 if the continuum hypothesis is false: this is called the Vaught conjecture and is the main remaining open problem (in 2005) in the theory of the spectrum. Morley's problem was a conjecture (now a theorem) first proposed by Michael D. Morley that I(T,Œ∫) is nondecreasing in Œ∫ for uncountable Œ∫. This was proved by Saharon Shelah. For this, he proved a very deep dichotomy theorem. Saharon Shelah gave an almost complete solution to the spectrum problem. For a given complete theory T, either I(T,Œ∫) = 2Œ∫ for all uncountable cardinals Œ∫, or \\\\textstyle I(T, \\\\aleph_\\\\xi) < \\\\beth_{\\\\omega_1}(\\\\xi) for all ordinals Œæ (See Aleph number and Beth number for an explanation of the notation), which is usually much smaller than the bound in the first case. Roughly speaking this means that either there are the maximum possible number of models in all uncountable cardinalities, or there are only \\"few\\" models in all uncountable cardinalities. Shelah also gave a description of the possible spectra in the case when there are few models. List of possible spectra of a countable theory By extending Shelah's work, Bradd Hart, Ehud Hrushovski and Michael C. Laskowski gave the following complete solution to the spectrum problem for countable theories in uncountable cardinalities. If T is a countable complete theory, then the number I(T, ‚ÑµŒ±) of isomorphism classes of models is given for ordinals Œ±>0 by the minimum of 2‚ÑµŒ± and one of the following maps: #2‚ÑµŒ±. Examples: there are many examples, in particular any unclassifiable or deep theory, such as the theory of the random graph. #\\\\beth_{d+1}(\\\\alpha+\\\\omega) for some countable infinite ordinal d. (For finite d see case 8.) Examples: The theory with equivalence relations EŒ≤ for all Œ≤ with Œ≤+1Œ≥ class is a union of infinitely many EŒ≤ classes, and each E0 class is infinite. #\\\\beth_{d-1}(\\\\alpha+\\\\omega^{2^{\\\\aleph_0}}) for some finite positive ordinal d. Example (for d=1): the theory of countably many independent unary predicates. #\\\\beth_{d-1}(\\\\alpha+\\\\omega^{\\\\aleph_0}+\\\\beth_2) for some finite positive ordinal d. #\\\\beth_{d-1}(\\\\alpha+\\\\omega+\\\\beth_2) for some finite positive ordinal d; #\\\\beth_{d-1}(\\\\alpha+\\\\omega^{\\\\aleph_0}) for some finite positive ordinal d. Example (for d=1): the theory of countable many disjoint unary predicates. #\\\\beth_{d-1}(\\\\alpha+\\\\omega+\\\\beth_1) for some finite ordinal d‚â•2; #\\\\beth_{d-1}(\\\\alpha+\\\\omega) for some finite positive ordinal d; #\\\\beth_{d-2}(\\\\alpha+\\\\omega^{\\\\alpha+1}) for some finite ordinal d‚â•2; Examples: similar to case 2. #\\\\beth_2. Example: the theory of the integers viewed as an abelian group. #(\\\\alpha+1)^n/G - \\\\alpha^n/G for finite Œ±, and Œ± for infinite Œ±, where G is some subgroup of the symmetric group on n ‚â• 2 elements. Here, we identify Œ±n with the set of sequences of length n of elements of a set of size Œ±. G acts on Œ±n by permuting the sequence elements, and Œ±n/G denotes the number of orbits of this action. Examples: the theory of the set œâ√ón acted on by the wreath product of G with all permutations of œâ. #1. Examples: theories that are categorical in uncountable cardinals, such as the theory of algebraically closed fields in a given characteristic. #0. Examples: theories with a finite model, and the inconsistent theory. Moreover, all possibilities above occur as the spectrum of some countable complete theory. The number d in the list above is the depth of the theory. If T is a theory we define a new theory 2T to be the theory with an equivalence relation such that there are infinitely many equivalence classes each of which is a model of T. We also define theories \\\\beth_n(T) by \\\\beth_0(T)=T, \\\\beth_{n+1}(T)=2^{\\\\beth_n(T)}. Then I(\\\\beth_n(T), \\\\lambda)= \\\\min(\\\\beth_n(I(T,\\\\lambda)), 2^\\\\lambda) . This can be used to construct examples of theories with spectra in the list above for non-minimal values of d from examples for the minimal value of d.

In 2009, the building at Inverleith was replaced with a building funded by a public‚Äìprivate partnership. The school is currently situated next to Inverleith Park, in the Stockbridge neighbourhood of Edinburgh but was formerly in Broughton, where the poet Hugh MacDiarmid was a pupil. Description The school was recently named in Tatlers list of top state schools. The school is home to a specialised music department: the City of Edinburgh Music School which nearly faced closure in 2018. Along with the music school Broughton has a specialist dance department. Broughton is also one of seven schools in Scotland chosen by the Scottish Football Association to support talented young footballers with extra coaching. As of 2018, the dedicated coach for the young players at Broughton is former Hibernian player Keith Wright. The school's motto Fortiter et Recte is Latin for 'to have the strength to do the right thing'. The Senior Leadership Team consists of the Headteacher (Mr J Wilson) and three Depute Headteachers (Mrs P Cumming, Mrs S Bennett and Miss L Stewart). The school also has a Director of Music (Mr T Morris) and a Business Manager (Mrs J Wallace). HMI(E) report In the last report, issued in September 2011, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education concluded that areas of strength were the school's leadership, care and welfare and specialist provisions. It stated that development was required on areas such as overall achievement, expectations and consistency. In February 2014, the school received a follow-up report which concluded that improvements had been made. The report stated that S4-S6 attainment in 2013 was the highest within the last three years.

To the Phoenicians, Romans and Arabs the port was of strategic importance. thumb thumb  Geography  It lies on the coast of the Mediterranean, where the climate is mainly dry and sunny, making it a popular tourist destination mixing the old and the traditional. It has a major port where a park of economic activities is based. Located at the southern end of the eastern peninsula that bears his name, the d√©l√©gation (district) of Zarzis has a very large coastline. There are a variety of landscapes reflecting a great diversity of climatic conditions. = Buildings and structures = * 320-metre-high guyed mast for FM/TV-broadcasting, tallest structure in Tunisia  History  The city was known in Antiquity as Gergis and located at the western end of the Lesser Syrtis (Gulf of Gab√®s), not far from the island of Meninx (current Djerba). The town may owe its name and/or origin to the Biblical tribes of Girgashites which, according to ancient Jewish writers, had left the Canaan at the time of Joshua and went to settle in North Africa. According to Stadiasme, it had a castle, where stood the ruins and a citadel modern still bearing the old name albeit now pronounced Zarzis, and a (navy) port. Gergis was important enough in the Roman province of Tripolitania (in the papal sway) to become a suffragan bishopric, which was to fade, presumably at the seventh century advent of Islam. Its ecclesiastical history is confused, due to confusion in consulting the Latin sources with the near- homonymous diocese Girba (modern Djerba).Anatole-Joseph Toulotte's G√©ographie de l'Afrique chr√©tienne. Byzac√®ne et Tripolitaine assigns some bishops which Mesnage's L'Afrique chr√©tienne lists at Girba to belong to Gergis.

J/Direct was specific of Microsoft's Virtual Machine, in replacement of the standard Java Native Interface (JNI). A Java program which used J/Direct would not run on platforms other than Microsoft Windows. The release of J/Direct (along with AFC and WFC), was part of an effort by Microsoft to gain leadership on the growing Java community. Since this destroyed one of the main advantages of Java, its cross-platform nature, J/Direct was often seen as an attempt by Microsoft to undermine Java's cross-platform capabilities, and an example of the tactic of Embrace, extend and extinguish. After the drop by Microsoft of their specific Java Virtual Machine, and the switch to the .NET environment, J/Direct was no longer maintained. Architecture J/Direct used a kind of annotation in Java code to make the link between Java and Windows functions. As annotations did not exist in Java when J/Direct was designed, Microsoft used a special syntax in Java comments. For example, to declare the \`GetSysColor\` function in the User32 API: / @dll.import(\\"USER32\\", entrypoint=\\"GetSysColor\\") */ static native int getSysColor(int nIndex); The Microsoft Java implementation already provided a pre-defined package which provided a set of pre-defined classes bound to the User32, Gdi32.dll, and Kernel32.dll APIs. Additionally, the Microsoft VM used some built-in rules to be able to bind automatically the Java code to some Windows API functions.

It was built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in March 1944, and was used hauling SP‚Äôs trains over the Sierra Nevada, often working on Donner Pass in California. Today it is preserved at the California State Railroad Museum (CSRM) in Sacramento, California.  History  No. 4294 was the last of 20 Southern Pacific class AC-12 4-8-8-2 cab forward locomotives in a larger series of 256 Southern Pacific articulated cab forwards starting with class AC-1. Articulated locomotives are essentially two locomotives sharing fire box, boiler and crew. The front locomotive has its cranks quartered 90 degrees apart. The front and rear drive axles are free to roll out of phase with respect to each other. If unloaded, the locomotive has a vertical oscillation, near 50 mph, that can lift the tires above the rails. Its most distinguishing feature was that the cab and firebox were at the front of the locomotive instead of the traditional rear. This was done essentially by running a 2-8-8-4 machine backwards with appropriate modifications. The engineer and fireman swapped sides and faced away from the firebox. The tender remained behind the locomotive to maintain the improved forward vision; this was possible because the locomotive burned Bunker C fuel oil rather than coal, so the fuel could easily be piped from the tender to the firebox, unlike a coal- burning locomotive. The smoke box end coupling was strengthened. The power reverse lever (Johnson Bar) and steam throttle motion direction were reversed. The drive wheel axles were also reversed, end for end without rekeying the return \\"fly\\" cranks, to reverse the expansion link timing on both sides. Conventional Walschaerts return crank position in red The cab forward design was useful in the long tunnels and snow sheds of Donner Pass and other mountainous regions where it kept smoke, heat, and soot away from the operating crew, allowing them to breathe clean air in such enclosed spaces. It entered service on March 19, 1944, and was retired from active service on March 5, 1956.  Preservation  SP was convinced to preserve one of the class and donated 4294 to the City of Sacramento, California, where it was put on outdoor display October 19, 1958, at the SP station next to the C. P. Huntington, the railroad's first locomotive. Construction for Interstate 5 necessitated a move for the locomotive, and it was stored in the SP shops until May 1981. At that time it was moved again, this time to its current location, the California State Railroad Museum, where it remains on static display. Had it not been for the negotiating efforts of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society in the 1950s, 4294 likely would have been scrapped along with all of the other SP cab forward locomotives. As a result, 4294 is the only SP cab forward that has been preserved. At one time, it was hoped that 4294 could be restored to operating condition. According to CSRM personnel, the biggest impediments toward such a project are the estimated costs and the current policies of both Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF Railway in regards to operations. The cost of such a restoration is estimated between $1 million and $1.5 million, an amount that the museum feels would be prohibitive given the current prospects for its eventual operation.Wyatt, Kyle K., Curator of History and Technology, CSRM, August 21, 2007.

Signs and symptoms  Most patients with APRT deficiency have repeated episodes of kidney stones that are not detected by a conventional x-ray study. However, all stones are easily detected by other medical imaging methods such as ultrasound or computerized tomography (CT) scan. A minority of patients develop symptoms of kidney failure. Kidney stones are often associated with severe loin or abdominal pain. Symptoms associated with kidney failure are largely nonspecific such as increased fatigue and weakness, poor appetite, and weight loss. Children with the disease may have similar symptoms as adults. In young children, APRT deficiency can cause reddish-brown diaper spots.  Genetics  inheritance. APRT deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. =Characteristics= The disorder results in accumulation of the insoluble purine 2,8-dihydroxyadenine. It can result in nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), acute renal failure and permanent kidney damage. More than 300 individuals with this disease have been reported world-wide but it is not known how common this medical problem truly is. Patients with the disease deficiency lack the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and therefore have difficulties breaking down dietary substances called purines, resulting in accumulation of a compound called 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) that is excreted by the kidneys. Up to 70% of affected patients, have red hair or relatives with this hair color.

The building is owned and occupied by the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). History Prior to 1928, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) operated out of a building near the Town Hall. The present site near Horniman Circle was acquired by the exchange in 1928, and a building was constructed and occupied in 1930. The street on which the site is located came to be called Dalal Street in Hindi (English: Broker Street) due to the location of the exchange. Construction of the current towers began in the late 1970s, with the building completed and occupied by the BSE in 1980. It was initially called BSE Towers. Soon after occupation, following the death of Sir Phiroze Jamshedji Jeejeebhoy, chairman of the BSE since 1966, the building was renamed in his memory. At the time of its completion, it was the tallest building in India, although it has since lost that claim to newer buildings. The building was a target of the 1993 Bombay bombings. The first of the 13 bomb blasts occurred at 13:25 hours on 12 March 1993 in the basement garage of the building. Almost 50 brokers and traders were killed and 30 cars were destroyed in the attack.

It is the first seaside resort in Tunisia. It is known for its agricultural riches and its touristic potentials. The city had a population of 73,128 as of the 2014 census. History Nabeul was founded in the 5th century BC by the Greeks of Cyrene, serving as a trade port. Its present name is an arabization of its Greek name Ne√°polis (, \\"New City\\"), which was a common name of Greek colonies. Neapolis, on the 4th-century Tabula Peutingeriana. On 21 July 365, a massive tsunami hit the city, resulting in much destruction and leaving part of it underwater. During antiquity, Neapolis was also the seat of an ancient Christian bishopricFrancois Decret, Early Christianity in North Africa (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2009) p83. The Bishopric was founded during the Roman Empire and survived through the arian Vandal and Orthodox Byzantine empires, only ceasing to function with the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The diocese was refounded in name at least in the 20th century as a titular see of the Roman Catholic church.Titular Episcopal See of Neapolis in Proconsulari at Gcatholic.org Due to its location by the Mediterranean coast, it remains today a popular tourist destination and is the main centre of the Tunisian pottery industry.  Climate  Nabeul, as well as the whole region of Cape Bon is known for its moderate climate. In January, the temperature reaches 8.4 ¬∞C on the minimum average, with the maximum average attaining 15.8 ¬∞C. In August, the minimum temperature is 22.6 ¬∞C while the maximum is 30.6 ¬∞C.  Economy  Nabeul's economy is based primarily on tourism. The most famous hotels are mainly located at the seaside. The most known tourist resorts in Nabeul include the Roman archaeological site of Neapolis (positioned 2 kilometres away from downtown), the archaeological museum which offers ceramic and Punic statues dating back to the 7th century BC and an important collection of Roman mosaics proceeded from sites of the region. Souk El Balgha is considered as one of the most ancient and special souks in the region of Nabeul. It was dedicated to fabricating and selling the \\"balgha\\" heelless slippers made from leather. Souk Haddada is devoted for sheet metal workers. Souk Ezzit is where the traders sold the oil. The weekly Souk which takes place every Friday attracts many tourists and locals. The Medina of Nabeul can be accessed through many doors: Beb Blad, the main entry, Beb el Zaouia and Beb el Khoukha.  Handicraft  Nabeul is also known in Tunisia and abroad for its handicraft which consists of artistic potteries., especially painted dishes and wall tiles This craftwork was restarted during the first half of the 20th century through the research of the French Tessier, Deverclos and the Tunisian Jacob Chemla.  Agriculture  Nabeul's agriculture relies on oranges, lemons and the bitter orange also known in French as Bigardier. People of Nabeul also distill flowers of bitter orange, Bourbon geranium and Damask rose. They sell it mainly in the local souks and export the rest to the world.  Gastronomy  Nabeul has been famous for its Harissa since the Andalusians' arrival to Tunisia in the 16th century. They brought pepper and stored loads of it throughout the year. This activity called \\"El Oula\\" consists of preserving food ingredients all along the season and making it last longer in order to be consumed on a day-to-day basis. Many women in Nabeul are still committed to storing \\"El Oula\\" every year.

It is either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant. Presentation The signs/symptoms of this condition are consistent with the following: *Intellectual disability, *Muscular hypotonia *Encephalitis *Seizures *Aphasia Cause Most forms of 2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Diagnosis =Classification= 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is an organic aciduria, and because of the stereoisomeric property of 2-hydroxyglutarate different variants of this disorder are distinguished: L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria The L-2 form is more common, severe, and mainly affects the central nervous system. The basal ganglia are affected, and cystic cavitations in the white matter of the brain are common, beginning in infancy. This form is chronic, with early symptoms such as hypotonia, tremors, and epilepsy declining into spongiform leukoencephalopathy, muscular choreodystonia, mental retardation, and psychomotor regression. It is associated with L2HGDH, which encodes L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. L-2-hydroxyglutarate is produced by promiscuous action of malate dehydrogenase on 2-oxoglutarate, and L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase is an example of a metabolite repair enzyme that oxidizes L-2-hydroxyglutarate back to 2-oxoglutarate. D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria The D2 form is rare, with symptoms including macrocephaly, cardiomyopathy, mental retardation, hypotonia, and cortical blindness. It is caused by recessive mutations in D2HGDH (type I) or by dominant gain-of-function mutations in IDH2 (type II). Combined D-2- and L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria The combined form is characterized by severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and absence of developmental progress. It is caused by recessive mutations in SLC25A1 encoding the mitochondrial citrate carrier. Treatment The treatment of 2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria is based on seizure control, the prognosis depends on how severe the condition is.

In this family, the winged species can fly at least reasonably well, though others with vestigial or no wings are flightless and highly apomorphic. As usual in their superfamily Hippoboscoidea, most of the larval development takes place within the mother's body, and pupation occurs almost immediately. The winged Pseudolynchia canariensis The sheep ked, Melophagus ovinus, is a wingless, reddish-brown fly that parasitizes sheep. The Neotropical deer ked, Lipoptena mazamae, is a common ectoparasite of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the southeastern United States. Both winged and wingless forms may be seen. A common winged species is Hippobosca equina, called \\"the louse fly\\" among riders. Species in other genera are found on birds; for example, Ornithomya bequaerti has been collected from birds in Alaska. Two species of the Hippoboscidae ‚Äì Ornithoica (Ornithoica) podargi and Ornithomya fuscipennis are also common parasites of the tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) of Australia. Pseudolynchia canariensis is commonly found on pigeons and doves, and can serve as the vector of \\"pigeon malaria\\" (Haemoproteus columbae'). Louse flies of birds may transmit other parasites such as those in the genus Plasmodium or other Haemoproteus parasites. Some evidence indicates that other Hippoboscidae can serve as vectors of disease agents to mammals. For example, a louse fly of the species Icosta americana was found with West Nile Virus infection from an American Kestrel Systematics In some obsolete taxonomies, the name Hippoboscidae is applied to the group properly known as Pupipara, i.e. the present family plus the bat flies (Nycteribiidae and \\"Streblidae\\"). They are called pupipara because the females birth live young, one at a time, that are deposited as late stage larvae called a prepuparium that pupate immediately at birth.ZADBI: Zurqui All-Diptera Biodiversity Inventory: How to Identify Flies ‚Äì Cyclorrhapha, on: phorid.net, 2013.

Larvae feed on milk glands within the female fly prior to being deposited. Single offspring (pupae) can weigh more than an unfed emerged adult fly since the pupal casing is included in the pupal weight and teneral flies often put on mass after their first few blood meals.

His stories carry strong social and political undercurrents, and his work has been widely translated abroad. He has written articles and reviews for alternative and mainstream publications, edits the fiction journal Verbal, and is the co- owner of the London Books publishing house.  Career  His 1996 debut novel, The Football Factory, was an instant word-of-mouth success, selling around 300,000 copies in the UK. The book was subsequently turned into a play by Brighton Theatre Events, with German and Dutch adaptations following. A high- profile film adaptation appeared in 2004. Directed by Nick Love and starring Danny Dyer, Dudley Sutton and Frank Harper, its UK DVD sales passed the two million mark. Both novel and film attracted widespread media comment for their realism. Prior to the novel‚Äôs release an early version of the chapter Millwall Away appeared in Rebel Inc. This magazine also published early writing by Irvine Welsh and Alan Warner, and all three would subsequently join Jonathan Cape. King was producing the fanzine Two Sevens with Peter Mason at this time (Mason would go on to author a book on the Brown Dog affair, among other books), and Rebel Inc editor Kevin Williamson‚Äôs fiction was featured, along with interviews with Welsh and the novelist Stewart Home. Following its publication, extracts from The Football Factory featured in issue 59 of the New York literary journal Grand Street. Two more novels ‚Äì Headhunters and England Away ‚Äì develop the themes of alienation and belonging to be found in The Football Factory. These three books form a loose trilogy with storylines found in The Football Factory and Headhunters converging in England Away. The Big Issue described Headhunters as: ‚ÄúSexy, dirty, violent, sad and funny; in fact, it has just about everything you could want from a book on contemporary working-class life in London‚Äù. Reviewing England Away, Chris Searle of The Morning Star wrote: ‚ÄúThe words of Wilfred Owen come pounding through King‚Äôs prose: ‚ÄòI was the enemy you killed, my friend‚Äô.‚Äù King's fourth novel ‚Äì Human Punk ‚Äì is believed to be his most autobiographical. Set in and around Slough, The Independent‚Äôs Gareth Evans wrote: ‚ÄúThe long sentences and paragraphs build up cumulatively, with the sequences describing an end-of-term punch-up and the final canal visit just two virtuoso examples. These passages come close to matching the coiled energy of Hubert Selby‚Äôs prose, one of King‚Äôs keynote influences... In the resolution of the novel‚Äôs central, devastating act, there is an almost Shakespearean sense of a brief restoration of balance after the necessary bloodletting.‚Äù White Trash (2002), which the author has described as ‚Äúa defence of the NHS‚Äù, drew the following praise from Alan Sillitoe, author of Saturday Night and Sunday Morning: ‚ÄúComplete and unique, all stitched up and marvellous, the two sides of the equation brought together, realistic yet philosophical.‚Äù In The Independent, Mat Coward wrote: ‚ÄúThe cumulative effect of King‚Äôs style, with streams of monologue, alternating between Ruby and Jeffreys, is astonishingly powerful in its detail and depth... This is an immensely timely and necessary book: stylish, witty and passionate. It‚Äôs about time someone slapped the smugness from the face of broadsheet Britain.‚Äù Skinheads (2008) is set in the same landscapes as Human Punk and White Trash, and while the three books feature different characters, they effectively combine to provide an overview of forty years of British culture and politics as The Satellite Cycle. In his review of the novel, Charles Shaar Murray stated: ‚ÄúJohn King‚Äôs achievement since his debut has been enormous: creating a modern, proletarian English literature at once genuinely modern, genuinely proletarian, genuinely literature.‚Äù The US edition of Human Punk carries the following quote by Lars Frederiksen of the American punk band Rancid: ‚ÄúJohn King: the face in our subculture who lives what he writes.‚Äù The one novel of King's to be set entirely outside England ‚Äì The Prison House ‚Äì is considered his most mature work to date. Brian Keenan wrote: ‚ÄúWith a brutal imagination The Prison House takes you to a place where angels fear to tread. Go there and be redeemed.‚Äù Boyd Tonkin, writing in The Independent, said: ‚ÄúIn this literary jail, the ghost of Kafka shares a cell with the shade of Burroughs.‚Äù An album based on the novel, written by King and Ruts DC guitarist Leigh Heggarty, has been reported. In 2007, King set up the independent publishing company London Books with Martin Knight, and their London Classics series has established itself as a focal point for London's ignored tradition of working-class fiction. King edits a London Classics list that includes authors Gerald Kersh, James Curtis and Robert Westerby, along with introductions by the likes of Iain Sinclair, Paul Willetts and Cathi Unsworth. He also puts on Human Punk nights at the 100 Club in Central London with the DJ Doctor Vinyl. Among others, Human Punk has featured the Cockney Rejects, Ruts DC, Old Firm Casuals, Sham 69 and The Last Resort. King has written for a range of newspapers, magazines and fanzines over the years, and has contributed to The New Statesman in the UK, La Repubblica in Italy and Le Monde in France. His small-press publication Verbal http://www.london-books.co.uk/books/verbal.html publishes new fiction and includes an author interview in each issue. A supporter of British withdrawal from the EU, his New Statesman articles ‚Äì A Very Corporate Coup and Flying The Flag ‚Äì were widely commented upon. This was followed by The People Versus The Elite (Penguin) and the release of his eighth novel, The Liberal Politics Of Adolf Hitler' (2016). Set fifty years in the future, The Morning Star wrote: ‚ÄúKing steadily constructs, layer by layer, an increasingly believable world where a combination of intrusive technology, ruthlessness and effectively bland public relations has ensured the domination of the majority‚Äôs thoughts and actions.‚Äù Author David Peace called it: ‚ÄúOne of the best, if not the best, bravest and most exciting books I‚Äôve read in years ‚Äì needed saying, needed writing and needs to be read.‚Äù King‚Äôs ninth novel ‚Äì Slaughterhouse Prayer (2018) ‚Äì is an animal-rights story set around three stages in the life of the main character, and how he responds to the meat and dairy industries as a boy, youth and man. TV producer/author Ben Richards has described the novel as: ‚ÄúA masterpiece in the tradition of Upton Sinclair and Victor Hugo.‚Äù The poet/author Benjamin Zephaniah said: ‚ÄúSlaughterhouse Prayer is a fiction that reveals many truths. Written from a compassionate place, it is sensitive, thoughtful, and there is nothing like it out there.‚Äù Bibliography NOVELS * Slaughterhouse Prayer (2018) * The Liberal Politics Of Adolf Hitler (2016) *Skinheads (2008) *The Prison House (2004) *White Trash (2002) *Human Punk (2000) *England Away (1999) *Headhunters (1998) *The Football Factory (1996) NOVELLAS * The Beasts Of Brussels (The Seal Club, 2020) SHORT STORIES * Hard But Fair (Denizen Of The Dead, 2020) * Granny‚Äôs Letters (Cheribibi, 2018) * Friday Night (w/Jaimie MacDonald, Hull International Photography Festival, 2017) * Blue-Eyed Girl (Twenty Shades Of Psycho, 2016) * The Terror Fantastic (PUSH 2, 2015) * See No Evil (More Raw Material, 2015) * The Penalty (High Life, 2010) * Last Train Home (La Republicca, 2008) * Bulldog Bobby (Verbal, 2000) * Space Junk (Intoxication, 1998) * Last Rites (Rovers Return, 1998) * Millwall Away (Rebel Inc., 1995) NON-FICTION * PUSH 2 (Interview/anthology, ed.

The borders are Flushing Meadows-Corona Park to the west, the Long Island Expressway to the north, Union Turnpike to the south, and Parsons Boulevard to the east. The neighborhood is located near several highways including the Long Island Expressway, Grand Central Parkway, Van Wyck Expressway, and the Jackie Robinson Parkway (Interborough). It is also served by several bus routes. Adjacent neighborhoods include Forest Hills to the west, Hillcrest to the east, Briarwood to the south, and Queensboro Hill to the north. Kew Gardens Hills is located in Queens Community District 8 and its ZIP Code is 11367. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 107th Precinct. Politically, Kew Gardens Hills represented by the New York City Council's 24th District.Current City Council Districts for Queens County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. Geography Kew Gardens Hills is situated in the southwestern corner of the area historically known as the Town of Flushing, in its 6th district. As neighborhoods in the City of New York are not designated by the city, there are multiple means to determine the geographical boundaries of the area: *General borders: The western boundary of the neighborhood is considered to be Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, which is separated from the neighborhood by the Van Wyck Expressway. The southern playground of the park however is east of the Van Wyck Expressway, and is only accessible via an entrance along Park Drive East. Though part of the park, the playground is considered within Kew Gardens Hills. Prior to the building of the Van Wyck Expressway, the IND World's Fair Line ran along this route during the 1939 New York World's Fair. *Postal boundaries: Since 2003, when the United States Postal Services renamed the post office in ZIP Code 11367 to the \\"Kew Gardens Hills Post Office\\", the borders of the area for ZIP Code purposes extend from the south at Union Turnpike, to the north at the Horace Harding Expressway and east to Parsons Boulevard. Prior to 2003 this Post office was called the Station C Post Office. Although the post office is named \\"Kew Gardens Hills\\", the USPS still designates the city or town for purposes of addressing as \\"Flushing\\".Boundary sign located over Flushing Meadows-Corona Park demarcating an Eruv boundary of Kew Gardens Hills *Other designations: Some areas, east of Parsons Boulevard and west of 164th Street, as well as south of Union Turnpike and north of the Grand Central Parkway are included in Kew Gardens Hills, by the NYC Department of Education, historians,\\"Kew Gardens Hills, Queens\\", Forgotten NY.

These areas include the Pomonok, Electchester, and Parkway Village developments, among others. Despite the ZIP Codes with the first three digits as \\"114\\" being originally designated in the postal city of \\"Jamaica\\", these areas of Kew Gardens Hills are within the geographical limits of the original Town of Flushing. The present 164th Street runs along the original border between the 4th and 6th districts of the town of Flushing. Adjacent neighborhoods include Forest Hills to the west, Hillcrest to the east, Briarwood to the south, and Queensboro Hill to the north. History =Early settlement= In the northwestern part of the neighborhood was the location of the Spring Hill Farm. The farm was part of the Francis Lewis estate during colonial times. By 1762 the farm was owned by Colonel Thomas Willet, High Sheriff of Flushing,The History of the Several Towns, Manors, and Patents of the County of Westchester: From Its First Settlement to the Present Time, Volume P.275 (Google eBook) and was sold to Cadwallader Colden, lieutenant governor for the Province of New York. In 1763 Colden built the Spring Hill House on the property. In 1783 the property was confiscated by the government because Cadwallader's son David was a loyalist to the monarchy. By 1894 the Durkee family owned the property and sold it to the Cedar Grove Cemetery Corporation. The Spring Hill House became the office of the Cedar Grove Cemetery, until the house was later destroyed by a fire. Cadwallader Colden and Thomas Willet are among those who are buried on the property on what is now the grounds of the Mount Hebron Cemetery. In the 19th century the area of Kew Gardens Hills was known as Head of the Fly, for its location at the headwaters of the Flushing Creek (or Flushing River). Fly or vly, being the Dutch word for swamp. One of the oldest roads through the area was called the Vleigh Road, and still exists today as Vleigh Place. Timothy Jackson operated a horse boarding stable near where the intersection of Park Drive East and Union Turnpike, or the Kew Gardens Interchange is today. On what is now the Jamaica subway yard was previously a horse race course, built by Timothy Jackson, and was known as Whitepot Race & Track. Although the train yard is not in Jamaica, it is named Jamaica because the yard feeds the subway lines which begin (or end) in Jamaica. This area was an extension of Timothy Jackson's Willow Glen Farm for which the farmhouse was located south of Union Turnpike in the neighborhood of Jamaica that is now called Briarwood. In the 1750s, William Furman was the owner of the farm he named Willow Glen. Today Willow Lake, at the southern end of Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, retains the Willow name. The municipal government of the Town of Flushing, which dated back to colonial times, along with other municipal township governments in Queens County, was incorporated into the Borough of Queens on January 1, 1898. Later, the area, was named after Kew Gardens, which in 1909 was renamed after Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, England in the United Kingdom. The area's earliest modern homes were built in 1917 off of Union Turnpike, but in the early 20th century, the area was known as Queens Valley and consisted mostly of farmland. By the 1920s many of the farms were sold to golf clubs or country clubs. The golf courses that made up the area include the Spring Hill Golf Course, Queens Valley Golf Course, Pomonok Country Club, and Arrowbrook Country Club. In 1939, the Arrowbrook Country Club was the home of the \\"Summer City Hall\\" of Mayor La Guardia. One road that ran through the area was called Quarrelsome Lane., which ran from Jamaica Road to Fresh Meadow Road; the road is now known as 75th Avenue. Jamaica Road, the most direct route between the villages of Flushing and Jamaica, is now Kissena Boulevard and becomes Parsons Boulevard at the intersection of Quarrelsome Lane. =Later years= Queens County Savings Bank on Main Street Growth to Kew Gardens Hills came when Kew Gardens, Queens, to the south, gained a subway line at Queens Boulevard in 1936 and Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, directly to the northwest of the neighborhood, hosted the 1939 New York World's Fair. Early residents were mostly German, Irish and Italian. Many were relocating from Brooklyn and Manhattan. The area was hilly and Kew Gardens was known as a prestigious Queens neighborhood and so developers changed its name from Queens Valley to Kew Gardens Hills. The first Queen of Peace mass took place in 1939. Property along 144th Street, now part of Main Street, was seized by the city to complete the construction of Main Street from northern Flushing. Main Street was paved and bus routes began to serve the area in 1941. The Jewish Center of Kew Gardens Hills was established in 1941. The Queens County Savings Bank opened its branch in 1949 and local school, P.S. 164, also known as the Queens Valley School, also opened its doors that year. Main Street Cinemas‚Äîdesigned by architect Joseph Unger, who also designed the Trylon Theatre‚Äîopened in 1940 and operated by Interboro Circuit Inc. The 600 seat single screen theater was built at a cost of $75,000, and was dubbed one of the city's finest. The theater has since been subdivided into a six screen cineplex. Of the 39 theaters once operated by Interboro, Main Street Cinemas is the only theatre still in use today. In 1941, Barney Spiegel bought a part of the Klein Farm at 69th Road and Main Street.\\"Buys Old Farm Tract: Queens Builder Acquires Large Kew Gardens Property\\". The New York Times. April 20, 1941. p. RE4. On the land, he built 150 duplexes, designed by architect A. Salkowitz. On July 14, 1965, the neighborhood became infamous when five-year-old Eddie Crimmins Jr. and four- year-old Missy Crimmins vanished from their garden apartment at 150-22 72nd Drive. Missy's body was found the same day in a vacant lot on 71st Avenue at 162nd Street (the area where the 107th Precinct is located today.) Eddie's body was found five days later near 68th Drive and the entrance to the northbound Van Wyck Expressway. The children's mother, Alice Crimmins, was convicted in 1971, and imprisoned, in the death of her children. She was paroled in 1977. * On September 16, 2010, an EF1 tornado touched down in Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, causing widespread damage to cars and homes in the Kew Gardens Hills area. John Bowne High School‚Äîlocated along Main Street at the edge of the CUNY Queens College campus, directly across from Mt. Hebron Cemetery‚Äîwas the only New York City public school building to sustain physical damage related to the storm and was closed on the day after the storm.

Biography As stated in several of his books, the Zone diet was born of his desire to avoid an early death from a premature heart attack, a fate of which all other men in his family had been early victims. In more recent years, Sears has popularized the use of high-dose Omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols to further reduce inflammation. He recently revealed in an interview that he began studying lipids primarily because of their complexity. He released his first book in 1995, The Zone: A Dietary Road Map. It went on to sell over 2 million hardback copies and was a No. 1 New York Times best-seller. Since then he has frequently appeared in the United States media, including CNN, Forbes and Good Morning America. Career and Zone diet Sears began his business career in 1976, as the founder and president of one of the first biotechnology startup companies in Massachusetts developing lipid-based delivery systems for cancer drugs. Sears believed that the drug delivery principles could be applied to diet, in order to control the levels of eicosanoids to ultimately control inflammation. In 1995, Sears released his first book, The Zone: A Dietary Road Map. The Zone, went on to become a No. 1 New York Times best- seller and sold over two million copies in the United States. In 1997, Sears released his second book, Mastering the Zone. The book again went on to become another New York Times best-seller and sold over 1 million copies in the United States. Sears continued to apply his dietary approach to other areas of health influenced by inflammation, and published his first book on anti-aging, The Anti-Aging Zone, in 1999. Over the next decade, Sears studied and released a number of books based on what he said was the linkage between diet and inflammation. In 2008, he released the book Toxic Fat: When Good Fat Turns Bad that described obesity as a form of cancer. Sears released his most recent book, The Mediterranean Zone in 2014, focusing on the role of polyphenols in the inflammatory response. Currently, Sears has published 15 books that have sold more than 6 million copies in the United States. Sears continues his research as the President of the non-profit Inflammation Research Foundation in Peabody, Massachusetts.
