Founded in 1990, it has a shifting membership of 15-30 musicians. It is known for spotlighting work by contemporary composers and won the Alcan Performing Arts Award in 2004.  History  The Hard Rubber Orchestra was founded in 1990 by John Korsrud. It had instrumentation similar to a big band, but the music was \\"an unholy mashup of minimalism, free jazz, noise, and funk\\". In 1992, a non-profit \\"Hard Rubber Music Society\\" was created as a vehicle for funding the orchestra. It operates with a mix of private donations, city funding, and Canada Council grants.  Notable commissions  The Hard Rubber Orchestra is characteristically open to new music. It has commissioned over 40 works from 30 contemporary jazz and classical composers. Here are some highlights. * John Korsrud, Giorgio Magnanensi, and Brad Turner contributed original compositions to the February 2005 multidisciplinary theatre piece, Enter/Exit. * Ice Age 2010, where the Hard Rubber Orchestra played pieces by Peter Hannan, Brad Turner, Tony Wilson, and Bill Runge, while dancers and ice skaters performed on a hockey rink, was part of the Cultural Olympiad festival which accompanied the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. * Linda Bouchard, and Scott Good (Vancouver Symphony Orchestra composer-in-residence), contributed compositions to the Hard Rubber Orchestra's 20th-anniversary concert on May 14, 2011. * Kenny Wheeler composed a 30-minute piece, which the orchestra premiered in Vancouver on October 19, 2013. The orchestra was joined by trumpeter Mike Herriott, singer Christine Duncan, and trombonist Hugh Fraser as conductor.  Awards  In 2004, the Hard Rubber Orchestra won the C$60,000 Alcan Performing Arts Award. This funded their February 2005 work, Enter/Exit, a multidisciplinary theatre piece featuring compositions by John Korsrud, Giorgio Magnanensi, and Brad Turner.

She is known for her climbs with Katharine Richardson, and for her contribution to the Alpine Journal and the Ladies' Alpine Club. Biography =Early life= Mary Paillon was born in Oullins, Rh√¥ne, into a family with a background in medicine and mountaineering. Her mother, Jane Paillon, was an experienced mountain climber with successful ascents of Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, and Belledonne to her name. =Career= Paillon began climbing in the Alps under the guidance of her mother and her brother, Maurice Paillon. She met Katharine Richardson, an English climber, in 1897 when Richardson was climbing the Meije. They agreed to climb together the next year, and eventually became close friends and frequent climbing partners. In the winter of 1890, together they traversed the Belledonne range in the Dauphin√© Alps, and in 1891 they made the first female ascent of the M√©ridionale d'Arves. They climbed the Meije Orientale with √âmile Rey in 1893, marking the third ascent of the peak by women, and Mont Pelvoux in 1897. Following their expedition to Pelvoux, Paillon's eyesight began to deteriorate and she and Richardson retired from serious climbing, since Richardson refused to climb when Paillon could not. The two women subsequently settled together in the Paillon family estate in Oullins. Paillon became a distinguished writer after retiring from climbing. In the period of 1895-1905 she was one of three female contributors to the Alpine Journal (edited at the time by her brother) and was responsible for fourteen of the seventeen pieces written by women. She largely wrote biographies of other women climbers; alongside Henriette d'Angeville, she wrote accounts of Richardson, Meta Brevoort, and Isabella Charlet-Straton. In 1910, Paillon was elected vice president of the Ladies' Alpine Club. =Late years and death= After Richardson's death in 1927, Paillon wrote in an obituary that Richardson had been \\"almost a sister to me\\". Paillon died in 1946 at the age of 98, having outlived Richardson by 25 years and never married.

Biography Pane was born on 5 February 1922 in Padang Sidempuan, North Sumatra, the younger brother of poet Sanusi and novelist Armijn Pane. By 1946 Pane was a student at the Islamic Higher School in Yogyakarta (now the Islamic University of Indonesia). In November of that year preparations began for an organization, based in Islam, which would unite university students of that faith and promote the social welfare of the Indonesian people. The Muslim Students' Association (Himpunan Mahasiswa Islam, or HMI) was formally established on 5 February 1947 by a group of 15 students, including Pane; however, only Pane is remembered as the organization's founder. A 1957 Media article wrote that the early years of the HMI were virtually indistinguishable from the life of Pane. Though in his later years Pane participated with the organization, he never took the position that he needed to be respected. Owing to his relatively low profile, he was sometimes not recognized when he arrived for meetings, and thus asked to sit outside; one member later recalled that he was sometimes mistaken for government intelligence, come to spy on the meetings. Pane became a full professor at IKIP Yogyakarta (now Yogyakarta State University). Pane died after being struck by a motorcycle on 25 January 1991. His second wife, Bisromah, died of a stroke on 9 March 2013. She was buried in the cemetery of the Kauman Grand Mosque, Yogyakarta. Together the couple had three sons. Legacy Lukman Hakiem, a former HMI leader and member of the People's Representative Council, considered Pane an intelligent yet simple figure who was open to criticism; Hakiem recollected that Pane, though a professor, would ride his bicycle rather than a car or motorcycle like other lecturers or his students. A 2013 article in the daily Republika wrote that, \\"sadly\\" (\\"sayangnya\\") Pane was not yet a National Hero of Indonesia. At least one street is named after Pane, in Depok, West Java.

Retrieved 30 Mar 2014. () is a water well in the Rhineland-Palatinate village of Altleiningen in the northeast of the Palatinate Forest. The well was probably driven around 1600 and was used originally to supply drinking water to Altleiningen Castle on the hill above. Its present design dates to 1855.  Geography  In the vicinity of the well is the Eckbach stream, which has its own source four kilometres upstream and is a left tributary of the River Rhine. It picks up the water from the 20 Pipe Well, which today supplies the greatest amount of water to the stream. Running past the fountain is the 23-kilometre-long Eckbach Mill Path, which begins at the source of the Eckbach in Hertlingshausen and follows it downstream to Dirmstein in the Upper Rhine Plain.  Layout  The well is fed by the strongest fracture spring (Spaltenquelle) in the Palatinate. The water rises from a fracture and is initially impounded into two large well chambers before being pouring out of 20 parallel pipes. The amount of water is controlled by a system of impounding the ground water which was very well thought through for its day. ‚Äì Link corrected 5 August 2012 Above the well is a protected inscription tablet of sandstone dating to 1855, when the well was given its present appearance; it was also rebuilt in the 1980s, undergoing a thorough renovation including some new components. The inscription is an imaginary dialogue between the walker (W) and the well (B): : Siehe, Wanderer: : Gottes Br√ºnnlein hat Wasser die F√ºlle! : W.: Ja, Br√ºnnlein, du hast Wassers die F√ºll; : Gibst Jedem zu trinken, der da will. : B.: Der reiche Gott hat mirs gegeben; : Machs mir nur nach, so wirst du leben! : W.: Was bleibt dann aber mir zuletzt? : B.: Ein Wasser, das ewig dich erg√∂tzt. ...which, translated, means: : See, walker: : God's little spring is overflowing with water! : W.: Yes, little spring, you're full of water; : Give it to everyone who wants some, so they may drink. : B.: God, who is generous, gave it to me; : Just do the same and you will live! : W.: So what, then, will I have in the end? : B.: A kind of water that fills you for ever.  History  The well was built at the behest of the counts of Leiningen in order to improve the water supply to their family seat, the castle of Altleiningen, and to ensure a permanent supply. There are no records of the exact year of construction, but historians estimate that it dates to around 1600.

This antiporter protein is found in the kidney and intestines, and normally acts to regulate the levels of sodium absorbed and secreted by the body. When administered orally, tenapanor selectively inhibits sodium uptake in the intestines, limiting the amount absorbed from food, and thereby reduces levels of sodium in the body. This may make it useful in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and hypertension, both of which are exacerbated by excess sodium in the diet.

Their task was to act as part of the radar defenses of the United States in the Cold War, serving until 1965. Ship type The converted Liberty ships were typically the boxed aircraft transport version, type Z-EC2-S-C5. The hull classification symbol of the ships was initially YAGR, changed to AGR in 1958. Equipment As converted, each ship carried an AN/SPS-8 height finding radar, AN/SPS-12 air/surface search radar, AN/SPS-17 long range air search radar, and AN/UPA-22 IFF sensor. The AN/SPS-8 was later replaced on some ships by the AN/SPS-30. The AN/SPS-17, purpose built for the Guardian class, could detect large aircraft such as bombers up to away and small aircraft up to away. Service The AGRs were based on both coasts at Newport, Rhode Island (later Davisville, Rhode Island) and Treasure Island, California near San Francisco, eight on the East Coast and eight on the West Coast. They would spend 30‚Äì45 days at sea regardless of weather, alternating with 15 days in port, monitoring aircraft approaching the United States as an extension of the Distant Early Warning line under the Continental Air Defense Command. Their primary duty was to warn of a surprise Soviet bomber attack. The AGRs were augmented by twelve radar picket destroyer escorts of the and es, known as DERs, and Lockheed WV-2 Warning Star aircraft. The DERs and WV-2s were called Barrier Forces, BarLant and BarPac, and operated much further from the US than the AGRs. By 1965, the development of over-the-horizon radar had superseded their function, and the radar picket ships were decommissioned and scrapped by the early 1970s.Friedman, pp. 231-233 The ships were: * Atlantic Squadron ** USS Guardian (YAGR-1) ** USS Lookout (YAGR-2) ** USS Skywatcher (AGR-3) ** USS Searcher (AGR-4) ** USS Investigator (AGR-9) ** USS Outpost (AGR-10) ** USS Protector (ARG-11) ** USS Vigil (AGR-12) * Pacific Squadron ** USS Scanner (AGR-5) ** USS Locator (AGR-6) ** USS Picket (YAGR-7) ** USS Interceptor (AGR-8) ** USS Interdictor (AGR-13) ** USS Interpreter (AGR-14) ** USS Tracer (AGR-15) ** USS Watchman (AGR-16) Picket stations were about off each coast and provided an overlapping radar or electronic barrier against approaching aircraft. While on station, the ships' operational control shifted from the Navy to the Air Force and NORAD. While on station, each ship stayed within a specific radius of its assigned picket station, reporting and tracking all aircraft contacts. Each ship carried qualified air controllers to direct intercept aircraft sent out to engage contacts. While on station other duties such as search and rescue, weather reporting, and miscellaneous duties were assigned. The National Marine Fisheries Service even provided fishing gear so that the crew could fish for tuna during the season, and the ships sent daily reports of fish caught for research purposes. The Guardian class spent more time at sea than any other US Navy vessels, apart from ballistic missile submarines, averaging 220‚Äì250 days per year on patrol. To make this very high amount of sea time as comfortable as possible for the crew, all sleeping quarters were air conditioned, each officer had a private stateroom, petty officers shared two-man cabins and enlisted men slept in four-man cabins (most other USN enlisted men at the time slept in hammocks, and in large berthing compartments regardless of type of bed).

Personal life  He was born in Christiania as a son of S√∏ren Diesen (1816‚Äì97) and Maren S. Hellerud (1822‚Äì1903). In March 1896 in Bergen he married shipmaster's daughter Barbara \\"Baby\\" Matzau Gjerding (1874‚Äì1933). They had six children, among them the sons Halvor and Einar Diesen who both followed in his footsteps in the press. Through his twin brother, the vicar S√∏ren Einar Munch Diesen, he was an uncle of the television people Thorstein Diesen, Jr. and granduncle of Erik Diesen.  Career  He grew up in Enerhaugen, finished his secondary education in 1881 and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.jur. degree in 1886. He served as deputy judge in Voss and Hardanger from 1888 to 1890, and then worked as the editor-in-chief of Bergens Aftenblad from 1890 to 1898. He had worked part-time as a copyeditor and journalist in F√¶drelandet during his studies, and was more inclined to work on a newspaper desk than as a jurist. In 1898 Diesen was hired by Emil Stang as the secretary-general of the Conservative Party. When Stang withdrew as leader in 1899, Diesen followed suit and was hired as political editor in Aftenposten which he remained for a year. With both Yngvar Nielsen and Frederik B√¶tzmann in the political section of the newspaper, it was not enough room for the three. From 1900 Diesen instead returned to the law profession, working as an attorney in a law firm with Otto Bahr Halvorsen. From 1904 he was a barrister with access to working with Supreme Court cases. The family settled in Aker, where Diesen was selected to the school board and elected to the municipal council. He also founded the local newspaper Akersposten in 1901, editing it until 1908. Diesen returned to Aftenposten and the political editor chair in 1908. When the editor-in-chief died in 1913, Diesen became co-editor-in-chief together with Ola Christofersen. Christofersen almost never wrote in the paper, but handled practical affairs. He was more of a pecuniary strategist than the politically inclined Diesen. Diesen's editorials were signed by a hammer, and were noted as being written in a popular, not always academic, style. He also released political pamphlets and books. Diesen remained editor-in-chief until his death while vacationing at Larkollen in September 1925. He also chaired the Norwegian Students' Society in 1900, and chaired the Conservative Press Association from 1910 to his death.

In 1943, Sait≈ç was drafted into the military. When Naruse heard that Sait≈ç would be heading off to war, he had the blade of his most treasured katana fitted to the body of a military issued gunt≈ç. Sait≈ç was instructed to carry it bravely into battle. During his service, Sait≈ç attained the rank of second lieutenant, receiving training as both an artillery officer and an aircraft navigator.Interview with Miek Skoss, Sword & Spirit, Classical Warrior Traditions of Japan, Vol.2, During his military service, he made regular visits to the d≈çj≈ç of Miyawaki T≈çru, master of Chuya-ha Itto-ry≈´ and Shirai- ry≈´ Shurikenjutsu. For many years, Naruse had been working toward the resurrection of Shirai-ry≈´, which many believed to have died-out. At Naruse's request, Sait≈ç compiled valuable technical and historical information concerning the tradition. Eventually however, both Miyawaki and his Shizuoka- based d≈çj≈ç fell victim to a strategic bombing campaign, which had been targeting the armament factories and airfields in Hamamatsu.Interview with David Kawazu-Barber, Fighters Magazine 2012. During this period, Naruse Kanji had written to Sait≈ç Satoshi and expressed his wish for him to succeed him as headmaster of both the Negishi-ry≈´ and Yamamoto-ry≈´ traditions. After the war drew to a close in late 1945, Sait≈ç returned to studies at Keio University. He supported himself financially by working several part-time jobs. Nuruse‚Äôs health was deteriorating by this stage, but Sait≈ç paid regular visits leading up to his death. Professionally, Sait≈ç worked as a civil servant for the city of Tokyo. He served at various ministries, and specialized in the field of statistics. He also worked as Chief-of-Staff at Tokyo Metropolitan University and lectured at the Faculty of Economics. He was also a senior adviser to the National Federation of Statistical Associations in Japan. In 1983, he received the Ouchi Prize, in honor of his contribution to the field of statistics.Published profile in International Seminar of Budo Culture booklet, Nippon Budokan Foundation 2007 For seventy years, Sait≈ç Satoshi had been a devoted researcher and collector of all things related to Japan‚Äôs militaristic past. His personal collection of weapons, books, scrolls, historical documents and antiques was overwhelmingly extensive. In 1949, Sait≈ç became a friend and student of Fujita Seiko, commonly known as the last K≈çga Ninja.Article by David Kawazu-Barber published in 2nd edition, Fujita Seiko, The Last Koga Ninja. In 1954, Sait≈ç Satoshi brought Negishi-ry≈´ back to the public eye when he demonstrated the art at the first postwar Japanese Martial Arts Exposition, held at the Tokyo Taikukan in Sendagaya ward. The aftermath of World War 2 and the subsequent banning of all martial arts by the Allied Occupation Forces meant that many classical martial arts were now facing possible extinction. This monumental event, which was sponsored by the Life Extension Society, is said to have attracted an audience of over 15,000. It was at this event that Sait≈ç Satoshi first met and became friends with G≈çz≈ç Shioda, founder of the Y≈çshinkan School of Aikid≈ç. Between the years of 1957 and 1994, Sait≈ç made regular TV appearances on NHK, TBS (Japan), TV Asahi, TV Tokyo and Tokai TV. He was also called upon to choreograph fight scenes for period dramas and films. During this period, Sait≈ç became friends with Nawa Yumio of the Masaki- ry≈´, and later instructed him in the art of shurikenjutsu (Nawa had also studied under Maeda Isamu, 4th generation S≈çke of Negishi-ry≈´). In 1992, Sait≈ç Satoshi was awarded the Imperial Order of the Sacred Treasure. After his retirement, Sait≈ç dedicated his life exclusively to the study and preservation of classical Japanese warrior traditions. From 1997 until his death in 2014, he served as Chairman (‰ºöÈï∑) of the Nihon Kobud≈ç Shink≈çkai (Êó•Êú¨Âè§Ê≠¶ÈÅìÊåØËàà‰ºö), Japan‚Äôs oldest and most illustrious kobudo organisation (est. 1935). He was also a long-term Director of the Nihon Kobud≈ç Ky≈çkai (Êó•Êú¨Âè§Ê≠¶ÈÅìÂçî‰ºö). On 16 March 2014, Sait≈ç Satoshi attended a plum-blossom festival with one of his senior students, David Kawazu-Barber, head of the Kamakura branch. After returning home that same evening, he passed away peacefully in his sleep; his death was attributed to old-age. Negishi-ry≈´ Shurikenjutsu The Negishi school of shurikenjutsu is a classical Japanese martial art (Kory≈´) founded by samurai, Negishi Sh≈çrei in the mid 1850s. Its distant roots can be traced back to the Sendai region's Katori Shinkon-ry≈´ (divine soul school), an offshoot of Tenshin Sh≈çden Katori Shint≈ç-ry≈´ (divine way school) originating in Chiba prefecture, Japan. A master of the Katori Shinkon-ry≈´, Matsubayashi Samanotsuke Nagayoshi, aka \\"Henyasai\\" (the bat), later founded his own school of s≈çg≈ç bujutsu in 1644 and named it Ganritsu-ry≈´. Ganritsu-ry≈´ spread throughout the Tohoku region, and was handed down within the Kat≈çno family for generations. Date Yoshikuni, 13th generation lord of the Sendai domain, received the art from the Kat≈çnos. Due to their light weight and concealability, Lord Date insisted that women within his household be trained in the art, as a method of self-defense. Date's wife, Tokugawa Takako, daughter of Tokugawa Nariaki (aka, Mito Rekko), Lord of the Mito territory, developed a high level of skill in the art. At her father's request, Takako passed the art on to Kaiho Hanpei, the official sword instructor for the Mito territory. As a child, Kaiho Hanpei enrolled as a disciple of Negishi Tsunemasa, master of Araki-ry≈´ in the Annaka Domain. After Tsunemasa‚Äôs death, he continued his studies under his son, Negishi Sentoku, the 3rd generation master of the school. In 1849, Negishi Sentoku asked Kaiho to instruct his 16-year-old son, Sh≈çrei, in the arts of Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ and Ganritsu-ry≈´. Within a few years, Negishi Nobunori Sh≈çrei became Kaiho‚Äôs most skilled student. Having perfected and refined his skill in shuriken-jutsu, Sh≈çrei felt the need to develop a new breed of shuriken-jutsu. His aim was to create a school that focused exclusively on shuriken combat. This gave birth to Negishi-ry≈´. The school uses the jiki-dah≈ç (direct flight) throwing method (unique to Japan) and incorporates the use of weapons, such as the sword.Nihon Kobud≈ç Ky≈çkai Shirai-ry≈´ Shurikenjutsu The Shirai school of shurikenjutsu is a classical Japanese martial art (kory≈´) founded by samurai, Shirai T≈çru in the early 1800s. The school uses long, needle-like darts, which can be thrown using the jiki-dah≈ç (direct flight) or hanten-dah≈ç (half-spin) methods. Used in conjunction with weapons, such as the sword and shub≈ç, Shirai-ry≈´ shurikenjutsu is a powerful and devastating system of traditional Japanese combat.Nihon Kobud≈ç Shink≈çkai Diamond Jubilee Publication, 2010. Kuwana Han- den Yamamoto-ry≈´ Iaijutsu Handed down within the Naruse family for generations, Yamamoto-ry≈´ Iaijutsu was founded by Yamamoto Jikensai, brother of Yamamoto Kansuke. The school consists largely of iaijutsu, as the name suggests, but also includes a short kenjutsu & jujutsu curriculum.

The university offers four-year American dual degree programs with majors in Architecture, Business, Civil Engineering, Global Affairs, Information Technology Management, Law, and Tourism and Hospitality Management. History The vision for AUPP originated with Dr. Chea Vandeth along with Dr. Kem Reat Viseth, the former Director of the School of Graduate Studies of the National School of Management and Dr. Kenneth Dunn, a Fulbright Scholar to Cambodia, who together conceptualized a new university that would embody international best practices and offer academic programs of the highest quality. AUPP was organized as a non-profit institution with the mission of contributing to the human resource development of Cambodia. In 2013, AUPP began operations with 40 students at a temporary campus in Toul Kork. A Board of Trustees was formed to direct the course of the University and oversee its development. At the same time an International Advisory Board was created including experienced educators, administrators and business leaders from the U.S. and Cambodia. This board was tasked with advising AUPP on its management, governance and academic structures, programs and services. The U.S. Embassy offered its support with the following statement: ‚ÄúAUPP collaborates with the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia to enhance the academic, professional, and social opportunities for AUPP students‚Äù. AUPP has further solidified a Micro Campus and Dual Degree agreement with the University of Arizona and a Dual Degree agreement with Fort Hays State University. These agreements will, for the first time, allow Cambodian students to receive accredited American degrees without having to leave Cambodia. AUPP‚Äôs first President, Dr. Sharon Siverts, was appointed in July 2014. AUPP's new President, Dr. Kenneth Dunn, was appointed in 2016. Campus AUPP moved into its new campus in 2017, located at 278H Street 201R, Russei K√©o, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. This modern facility has been designed to enhance and support a model academic teaching and learning environment, incorporating the newest technologies, a learning center library, a modern FIFA regulation football field and student services that will complement academic offerings. The environment will allow students to develop their full potential, and acquire the necessary education and relevant skills to be competitive in the 21st century. Academics AUPP‚Äôs management is composed of qualified and experienced administrators with experience in American and other western institutions. AUPP employs highly qualified faculty members who have terminal degrees in their respective fields and international experience. AUPP signed a Micro Campus agreement with University of Arizona (U of A) and a Dual Degree agreement with Fort Hays State University (FHSU) at the AUPP campus in Phnom Penh, under which they will enter into a cooperative arrangement to deliver dual degree programs to AUPP students. This is the first time that a U.S. degree can be completed by Cambodian students entirely in Cambodia. The programs offered by AUPP with U of A and FHSU are ‚Äúdual degrees‚Äù, meaning that students who finish four years of study at AUPP will receive one bachelor's degree from AUPP and another one from an American Partner University. This agreement also allows AUPP students to study abroad at U of A or at FHSU in the United States for one or two semesters depending on their choice of Major. AUPP offers the following majors in partnership with University of Arizona or Fort Hays State University: # Bachelor of Science in Business in Management, Marketing, Finance and Accounting (Dual Degree with University of Arizona) # Bachelor of Arts in Law (Dual Degree with University of Arizona) # Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (Dual Degree with University of Arizona) # Bachelor of Business Administration in Tourism & Hospitality Management (Dual Degree with Fort Hays State University) # Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Management (Dual Degree with Fort Hays State University) # Bachelor of Arts in Architecture (Single Degree with AUPP) # Bachelor of Arts in Global Affairs (Single Degree with AUPP) Student Life AUPP students at a Wikipedia workshop in September 2018. Student learning and development are promoted inside and outside of the classroom. In addition to AUPP‚Äôs rigorous academic programs, meaningful out- of-classroom learning opportunities further AUPP‚Äôs mission of developing critical thinkers and socially responsible leaders. AUPP believes student involvement is a crucial part of the college experience and enhances students‚Äô learning and preparation for successful careers. AUPP‚Äôs student clubs include an IT club, yoga club, movie making club, football club, and several others. Students are also involved in service-learning projects (social responsibility). The elected student government provides leadership opportunities, organizes field trips, and organizes a speaker series which further round out students‚Äô education. AUPP‚Äôs internship program allows students to gain experience, build confidence, and enhance leadership capabilities by working as interns in various local organizations or on summer internship opportunities overseas. The school also actively engages students in providing post graduate job opportunities and assists in getting students into advanced degree programs.

Developed early in the war by Herbert Garland, a pre-war metallurgist and superintendent of laboratories at the Cairo Citadel, it was the most numerous mortar of the Gallipoli Campaign. A simple, improvised design, the Garland mortar consisted of a smoothbore steel barrel fixed at 45 degrees to a solid wooden base. By means of a powder charge it propelled a variant of the jam tin grenade. Its design meant that the whole weapon had to be turned to change its traverse and raised on a box to increase its range but despite these limitations it was reported to have done \\"good work\\" in the front line.  Design  The mortar was developed by Herbert Garland, superintendent of laboratories at the Cairo Citadel in Egypt. The weapon was of straightforward construction, comprising a plain, smoothbore, tempered steel barrel of 65 mm calibre fitted at a fixed 45-degree angle to a solid wooden base. There are references to the bombs themselves being variants of the improvised Jam Tin Grenade with a steel shaft affixed. However the Australian War Museum holds an example of a more complex bomb with a three ounce gelignite charge and an impact detonation mechanism, mounted on a wooden shaft. This latter type of grenade could also be modified to be thrown by hand. The shaft protruded down the barrel of the mortar to the charge (of 5 drams of smokeless powder), leaving the bomb itself outside the barrel. A white calico tail was affixed to the bomb to improve the accuracy of its flight. With the barrel affixed to the base the only means of traversing was to turn the entire unit. Since the barrel was fixed at a 45-degree angle, the mortar was already set up to fire the grenade the maximum theoretical distance for a ballistic projectile.Range of a projectile#Derivations:File:Ideal projectile motion for different angles.svg To change the range the entire mortar had to be raised vertically, typically by propping it up on a box. Raising only the front of the mortar so the barrel was at an angle greater than 45 degrees would reduce the distance travelled by launching the grenade into a higher trajectory more typical of a mortar. Raising the back would also reduce the distance travelled by launching the grenade into a flatter trajectory more typical of a cannon. A spotter was able to track the progress of the bomb during daylight by watching for the shaft revolving in the air and at night the sparks from the bomb's fuse marked its progress.  In service  General William Birdwood, commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, in correspondence with Garland, agreed to trial the mortar during the Dardanelles Campaign. The weapon was manufactured at the Citadel in Cairo and proved to be in great demand by units posted to Gallipoli. Several Australian units had them in service as well as the Highland Light Infantry, Worcestershire Regiment and Suffolk Regiment. Ammunition was in plentiful supply and the Garland soon became the most common mortar in use at Gallipoli, the Australian 1st Division having seven in service by October 1915. At least one batch of bombs consistently failed to detonate, according to a report from the front line. The problem was blamed on the gelatine used in the charge. The same source also stated that the quantity of propellant specified was insufficient and had been increased by two drams to throw the charge the required distance. Nevertheless, the mortar was reported to have done \\"good work\\" in the trenches. There is an example of the weapon in the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, that was recovered from Lone Pine, Gallipoli, in January 1919.

Description Allium schubertii is a perennial plant which grows from an underground bulb and which produces vivid green, strap-like leaves in the spring, which die back before the it blooms. It grows to around 50 cm tall and lives for 2‚Äì5 years. These flowers consist of 50 or more star-shaped, mauve florets on stems of differing lengths producing a starburst effect which can be up to 30 cm across. The desiccated flower heads eventually break off the dried out, dead stems and, blown around by the desert winds, cast their seeds abroad as they tumble around. Distribution Allium schubertii is found in Israel, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and Libya but grown as an ornamental elsewhere.Kew Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesZuccarini, Joseph Gerhard. 1843.

Cultivation Allium schubertii has flower and seed heads that have been compared to fireworks exploding, and both are dried and used in flower arranging, and can even be sprayed with decorative paint and used as Christmas tree decorations. The American Horticultural Society recommends growing these bulbs in AHS planting zones 5-8. It appears, however, that they may be even cold-hardier than that. This depends on the heaviness of the soil: in heavier soil that retains water in winter, the survival of these plant is significantly decreased.

Gowrishankar (25 February 1950 ‚Äì 16 November 2004) was an Indian cinematographer and an occasional film director and screenwriter who worked primarily in Kannada cinema. He was known for his unorthodox style as a cinematographer and was recognised for his work in both art and commercial films. His daughter Rakshita was a popular actress during the 2000s. Rakshita's mother Mamatha Rao was a Kannada actress who acted in movies like Hosa Belaku, Praaya Praaya Praaya and Antharala. One of the most good looking men in the Kannada film industry at that time, Gowrishankar fell in love with budding actress Mamatha Rao during the shooting of Raj Kumar's Hosa Belaku (1982) and later married her. Gowrishankar won six Karnataka State Film Awards during his career as a cinematographer. In 1988 he directed the fairly successful Elu Suttina Kote with Ambarish, Gauthami and a young Ramesh Aravind.  Early life  Gowrishankar was born on 26 February 1950 to B. Channabasappa and Shashimukhi in Bangalore. He received the Diploma in Cinematography from Jayachamarajendra Polytechnic and worked in the Kanteerava Studios, Bangalore for some time.  Career  Gowrishankar debuted as a cinematographer in the 1977 Kannada language film Anuroopa. Along with Anuroopa, his work in 1970s films like Spandana (1978) and Arivu (1979) won his critical acclaim. In the 1995 critically acclaimed mafia film Om (1995), he used filters to capture the mood of the underworld. His work in Pushpaka Vimana (1987) and Mungarina Minchu (1998) was appreciated. In the 1996 film Janumada Jodi, he picturised the song \\"Mani Mani Manigondu Daara\\" on Shivarajkumar, Shilpa and Pavithra Lokesh with the sunset in the backdrop, for nine days, as the sunset would last only for a few minutes. The song \\"Deepavu Ninnade Gaaliyu Ninnade\\" from the film Mysore Mallige (1992) was picturised by him on Sudharani in the light of one small lamp. His work in the film won him his fifth State Film Award.

It is 23 kilometres long and runs gently downhill along the Eckbach river through the Leiningerland in the northeast of the Palatinate region.  Course  Western end: the source of the Eckbach with its Ritterstein (with the inscription Eckbach-Ursprung, \\"Eckbach source\\", above) The trail runs from west to east/northeast through the collective municipalities of Hettenleidelheim and Gr√ºnstadt-Land. It links nine villages and 23 of the original 35 water mills, running from the Palatinate Forest through the vineyards along the German Wine Road to the edge of the Upper Rhine Plain. The height difference between the start and end points (Hertlingshausen 308 metres, Dirmstein 108 metres) is 200 metres, the cumulative gain and loss over the generally gently descending route is only 250 metres, hence its difficulty is assessed as easy. The route, which is accessible all year round, is marked by wooden signposts, made and maintained by voluntary workers. They bear the mill logo and the name Eckbach- M√ºhlenwanderweg. The logo depicts a house and waterwheel above a wavy line and was designed by Cosmas K√∂sters from Kirchheim in a school competition. The wavy line symbolizes the Eckbach, the stylized house with a water wheel represents a mill.  History  The path was created as a tourist attraction initiative of mill researcher, Wolfgang Niederh√∂fer, from Kleinkarlbach. On 12 October 1997 it was inaugurated by the minister president of Rhineland- Palatinate, Kurt Beck, in Gro√ükarlbach, the village with the most surviving mills (six of seven). The suggestion made at the time to make the Gro√ükarlbacher village mills a cultural monument and create the Leiningerland Mill Museum (M√ºhlenmuseum Leiningerland) was achieved in 2007. Originally the route began by the Eckbachweiher pond and was only 19 kilometres long, but in 2000 it was extended by 4 kilometres upstream to the source of the Eckbach in Hertlingshausen.

The office is thought to have been established around 395 AD. At the imperial court, a dux was of the highest class of viri spectabiles. The Notitia Dignitatum lists for the Gallic part of the Litus Saxonicum (\\"the Coast of Saxony\\") two commanders, and their military units, who were charged with securing the coasts of Flanders (Belgica II), of Normandy (Lugdunensis II), and of Brittany (Lugdunensis III), these commanders being the Dux Belgicae secundaeNotitia Dignitatum Occ. XXXVIII and the neighboring Dux Armoricani et Nervicani. Notitia Dignitatum Occ. XXXVII These two commanders were the successors to an official the Comes Maritimi Tractus (Commander of the Coastal Regions), who formerly commanded both the British and the Gallic part of the Saxon Shore. These two commanders maintained coastal defenses until the mid‚Äì5th Century. A well known commander was the Frankish king Childeric I (late 5th century).  History  In the course of the imperial reforms under Emperor Diocletian new military offices were introduced in Britain and Gaul. At that time the limes (border wall/marker) of the Saxon coast were established on both sides of the English Channel. The castles guarding the heavily exposed sections and estuaries were partially restored or modified from existing structures. Their garrisons had the task of repelling raiders and impeding the access of invaders to the interior. The main responsibility for securing both coasts was in the middle of the 4th century placed in a Comes Maritimi Tractus. In 367, an invasion of Britain by several barbarian peoples, almost completely wiping out units of the local provincial forces, killing the coastal commander Nectaridus. His area of responsibility must have been divided thereafter‚Äîby 395 at the latest‚Äîinto three military districts. This most likely was also to prevent a military commander from having too many soldiers under his command, thus enabling him to start an uprising (such as the usurpation of the British fleet commander Carausius). For the Gallic part of the Saxon coast, two new ducal regions were created, which existed until the early 5th century.barbarica conspiratio, Ammianus 27,8,1‚Äì6, Peter Salway 2001, S. 281 In the final phase of Roman rule over Gaul, Childeric, as civilian administrator and commander of the warrior groups around the town of Tournai in the north of the province, acted as the commander of the Salian Franks. Tournai served as his residence and administrative headquarters. His power was based upon, among other things, the weapon forges here. In Childeric's grave, discovered in 1653, Eastern Roman gold coins, a gold-plated officer's coat (paludamentum), and a golden onion button brooch were found. The first was interpreted as renumeratio (payment) for services rendered, the last as an insignia of the late Roman army. It is unclear whether Childeric acted as merely a Roman general or independently as a king (rex gloriosissimus); most likely, both offices had already merged. Childeric was probably still loyal to the late Roman military aristocracy of Gaul. In any case, it was not the formal powers that mattered, but the power based on commanding a military resources. This combining of civilian and military offices in his hands suggests that Childeric had a prominent position among barbarian army commanders. He had probably been directly confirmed in his office by the administration of Odoacer in Italy and also by the Eastern Roman imperial court. It is believed that he had precedence before the other federal commander in chief. As rex or princeps he would also have been entitled to bestow religious and secular offices and the associated titles‚Äîsuch as patricius, comes, and dux‚Äîto deserving Teutons or Romans in his domain (regnum).Eugen Ewig, 2006, S. 17, Stefanie Dick, 2015, S. 29‚Äì30, Dieter Geuenich, S. 97‚Äì98  Administrative staff  Dux Belgicae secundae from Notitia dignitatum: the forts on Litus Saxonicum (\\"the Saxon shore\\", symbolically represented as one fort), and the fortress cities Quartensis and Portuae Patiaci, all under the command of the Dux Belgicae secundae.

Their bases were in locus Quartensis, or Vicus ad Quantiam, (Port d'Etaples, France, north of the Somme estuary) and locus Hornensis (possibly Cap Hornu, Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, France). Tribunus militum Nerviorum, a prefect for Sarmatian settlers (Praefectus Sarmatarum gentilium, inter Renos et Tambianos secundae provinciae Belgicae), and four prefects that commanded the contingents of Germanic Laeti: * Praefectus laetorum Nerviorum in Fanomantis (modern Famars, Picardie, France) * Praefectus laetorum Batavorum Nemetacensium in Atrabatis (modern Arras, Pas de Calais, France) * Praefectus laetorum Batavorum Contraginnensium in Noviomago * Praefectus laetorum gentilium in Remo et Silvanectas Their shield emblems are not shown in the Notitia Dignitatum. The Dux had originally more units under his command. Arnold Hugh Martin Jones identified the origin of some units as being from the Gallic army. They originated from Belgica II. Their names are the same as the well-known cities of this province: * Geminiacenses, a legio comitatenses, (from Geminiacum ‚Äì modern Liberchies, Hainaut, Belgium); comitatenses ‚Äì having been assigned to a field army, but without being awarded the higher designation of \\"palatine\\" status * Cotoriacenses, a legio comitatenses (from Cotoriacum ‚Äì West Flanders) * Prima Flavia (Prima Flavia Metis) (a pseudo-comitatenses from Metis) Unlike the vexillarii of other duces, these units are not shown as being under the command of the Dux Belgicae II. It seems that this province had diminished influence after the destruction of the border units on the Rhine (Rhine crossing of 406 AD), at which many of their units were transferred to the field army.

This large red crab is found in cold deep waters in the North Atlantic and often caught as a bycatch in fisheries for Greenland turbot (Greenland halibut). As suggested by its common name, the carapace and legs are covered in long spines. Distribution and habitat The porcupine crab is found on muddy bottoms on the continental slope in deep waters of the North Atlantic. In the western Atlantic, it ranges from eastern Canada and Greenland south as far as North Carolina in the United States. In the eastern Atlantic, it ranges from Iceland to Madeira, Portugal and Cape Verde, including the Porcupine Seabight and Rockall Trough off Ireland. It has been recorded at depths of , but mostly at in water that is about . Exceptionally, living singles have been caught in very shallow water, likely the result of turning icebergs suddenly forcing them up from the deep. Based on radio tagging, some individuals will stay in a region for months, but others may move quite long distances. Appearance This deep red crab is covered in spines, which are long and robust in large adults, and very long and thin in young. It has a carapace length (\\"nose\\" to \\"rump\\") that is up to , a leg span up to and can weigh as much as . Females are somewhat smaller than males; in a study off Canada average carapace length for healthy adults was about for females and males respectively. They are often victims of Briarosaccus callosus (family Peltogastridae), a parasitic barnacle that causes sterility in the crab and also will use many other king crab species around the world as a host. In the porcupine crab, males infected by this barnacle average somewhat smaller than healthy males, while infected females average somewhat larger than healthy females. Fishing Fisheries for Greenland turbot (Greenland halibut) can have porcupine crabs as a bycatch, sometimes in large quantities; in 1996 alone several hundred thousand tonnes were caught off Canada. Despite this, the porcupine crab has not been targeted by fisheries because of the great depth it inhabits (unlike several other large king crab species that typically inhabit shallower depths and are heavily targeted by fisheries). It is, however, considered to have potential as a future fishing resource. As long as the porcupine crab is not injured during capture and release from the bottom gillnet, they have a high survival rate.

Biography Born in Vad, Romania, to Teodor and Livia Ciceu, an Orthodox priest and professional singer respectively, he began to play the piano at the age of four. Aged six, he performed a Mozart piano concerto with the symphony orchestra of Cluj. Although he graduated from the National Conservatory in Bucharest, he abandoned a career as a conventional concert pianist and established his style between classical and jazz piano, introducing swing harmonies into baroque, classical and romantic compositions, often as spontaneous improvisations. In 1962, while touring East Berlin, Cicero fled to West Berlin. He spent the next two years in Switzerland, where he joined the \\"Kindli\\" orchestra of Joe Schmid. After returning to Germany, Cicero produced more than 70 recordings, some of them with the Berlin and Munich Philharmonic orchestras. He had numerous appearances on German TV and enjoyed much success while touring Japan. In 1976 he was awarded the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis for his interpretations of Franz Schubert. In 1982, Cicero moved to Switzerland, where he died in Z√ºrich in 1997 from a cerebral apoplexy,\\"Roger Cicero ist tot - Ciceros schweres Schicksal\\" , GMX.de aged 57.

Negros is one of the many islands that comprise the Visayas, in the central part of the country. The predominant inhabitants of the island region are mainly called Negrenses (locally Negrosanons). As of 2015, the total population of Negros is 4,414,131. From May 29, 2015 to August 9, 2017, the whole island was governed as an administrative region which was officially named the Negros Island Region which comprised the highly urbanized city of Bacolod and the provinces of Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental, along with its corresponding outlying islands and islets within a total regional area of . It was created on May 29, 2015 by virtue of Executive Order No. 183 issued by Benigno Aquino III, who was the president at that time. In August 9, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte signed the Executive Order No. 38 dissolving the Negros Island Region. History =Precolonial era= Ati man with a hunting bow (c. 1900) from Negros Island Negros was originally called Buglas, an old Hiligaynon word thought to mean \\"cut off\\", as it is believed that the island was separated from a larger landmass by rising waters during the last ice age. Among its earliest inhabitants were the dark-skinned Ati people, one of several aboriginal Negrito ethnic groups dispersed throughout Southeast Asia that possesses a unique culture. The westernmost portions of the island soon fell under the nominal rule of the Kedatuan of Madja-as from the neighboring islands of Panay and Guimaras, while the easternmost areas were influenced by the Rajahnate of Cebu from neighboring Cebu Island. =Spanish colonization= Negros Island (\\"Buglas\\") as depicted in the Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas (1734) Upon arriving on the island in April 1565, the Spanish colonizers called the land Negros, after the dark- skinned natives they observed. Two of the earliest native settlements, Binalbagan and Ilog, became towns in 1573 and 1584, respectively, while other settlements of the period included Hinigaran, Bago, Marayo (now Pontevedra), Mamalan (now Himamaylan), and Candaguit (now a sitio of San Enrique). After appointing encomenderos for the island, Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi placed Negros under the jurisdiction of the governor of Oton in Panay. In 1734, however, the island became a military district with Ilog as its first capital. The seat of government was later transferred to Himamaylan until Bacolod became the capital in 1849. In 1865, Negros and its outlying minor islands along with Siquijor was converted into a politico-military province. In 1890, the island was officially partitioned into the present-day provinces of Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental. The Spanish Governor, D. Isidro Castro y Cinceros, surrendered to the Negros Revolutionaries, led by Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta, on 6 Nov. 1898.Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons General Miller appointed Aniceto, Governor of the Island in March 1899. =Negros Revolution and formation of Republic of Negros= Flag of the short lived Negros Republic From 3 to 6 November 1898, the Negrense peoples rose in revolt against the local Spanish colonial government headed by politico-military governor Colonel Isidro de Castro. The Spaniards decided to surrender upon seeing armed troops marching in a pincer movement towards Bacolod. The revolutionaries, led by General Juan Araneta from Bago and General Aniceto Lacson from Talisay, bore fake arms consisting of rifles carved out of palm fronds and cannons of rolled bamboo mats painted black. By the afternoon of 6 November, Col. de Castro signed the Act of Capitulation, thus ending centuries of Spanish colonial rule in Negros Occidental. In memory of this event, every November 5 is observed as a special non-working holiday in the province through Republic Act No. 6709, signed by President Corazon Aquino on 10 February 1989. On 27 November 1898, the Cantonal Republic of Negros unilaterally proclaimed independence, but this was short-lived as the territory became a protectorate of the United States on 30 April 1899. The state was renamed the Republic of Negros () on 22 July 1899, and eventually dissolved by the United States and annexed by the U.S. Military Government of the Philippine Islands on 30 April 1901. The leaders of the short-lived republic were: *Aniceto Lacson, November 5, 1898 ‚Äì July 22, 1899 (to November 27, 1898, in Negros Occidental) *Demetrio Larena, November 24, 1898 ‚Äì November 27, 1898 (in Negros Oriental) *President of the Constituent Assembly Jos√© Luzuriaga, July 22, 1899 ‚Äì November 6, 1899 *Secretary of War Juan Araneta *Civil Governor Melecio Severino, November 6, 1899 ‚Äì April 30, 1901 *Secretary of Justice Antonio Ledesma Jayme, November 5, 1898 ‚Äì July 22, 1899 =Commonwealth period= From 1914 to 1927, parts of Western Negros hosted several newly established settlements which became cities connected by railroads constructed to flow towards several \\"sugar centrals\\" which were processing the extremely sweet raw sugar canes grown in Negros' volcanic soil and farmed by several \\"Haciendas\\". These haciendas littered the countryside as the central sugar mills eventually grew to become full pledged towns and cities: chief among which were Ilog, Hinigaran, La Carlota, Silay, Pulupandan, Bacolod, San Carlos and Bais\\"A Queen Dies Slowly: The Rise and Decline of Iloilo City\\" in 'Philippine Social History: Global Trade and Local Transformations' edited by Alfred W. McCoy and Ed. C. de Jesus (c1982), pp. 326. Western Negros also saw massive immigration from Panay as the Spanish, Chinese, and French mestizos who administered the HaciendasRobustiano Echauz, Sketches of the Island of Negros (Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Center for International Studies, Southeast Asia Program, 1978), pp 73-74 imported laborers from Panay island to foster the farming of Negros' sugar plantations and thereby displacing the Cebuano speaking natives.Estadisticas de los Terrenos Agricolas, La Carlota and Hinigaran, Negros Occidental, 1897, Varias Provincias, PNA The east side of Negros was not as thickly settled but became a center of education as on 9 April 1901, the Second Philippine Commission under the chairmanship of William H. Taft arrived in Dumaguete. Weeks later on 1 May, the civil government under American sovereignty was established, and on 28 August, Dr. David S. Hibbard founded what is now Silliman University the first American school in the Philippines and the entire Asian continent with the help of Meliton Larena as the first Mayor of Dumaguete, as well as Demetrio Larena. Thus, Negros is among the most populous islands in the Philippines and also the one with the most number of component cities.\\"FAST FACTS: The Negros Island Region\\" By Michael Bueza =Post-Commonwealth era= Regions were first formed on September 24, 1972 when the provinces of the Philippines were organized into different 11 regions by Presidential Decree No. 1 as part of the Integrated Reorganization Plan of President Ferdinand Marcos. Negros Occidental was assigned to Western Visayas (Region VI) and Negros Oriental was assigned to Central Visayas (Region VII). =Negros Island Region= The movement for a single-island region started in the 1980s when officials of both provinces proposed a one-island, one-region unit. Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental are the only provinces in the Philippines situated in the same island but belonging to two different administrative regions with regional offices located in neighboring Panay and Cebu. The movement to unite the two provinces in Negros island was sustained in the 1990s and 2010s. The campaign for the creation of a region in Negros had gains when President Benigno Aquino III directed the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to study the establishment of a new region. with the government agency later endorsing the move. NEDA affirmed by saying that its studies show that the proposed region is economically viable. On May 29, 2015, President Aquino signed Executive Order 183, which created the Negros Island Region. It separated Negros Occidental and its capital Bacolod from Western Visayas (Region VI) and Negros Oriental from Central Visayas (Region VII) to form the island region, which made the total number of regions of the Philippines into 18. Dissolution On August 9 of 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order No. 38, revoking the Executive Order No. 183 signed by (former) President Benigno Aquino III on May 29 of 2015, due to the reason of the lack of funds to fully establish the NIR according to Benjamin Diokno, the Secretary of Budget and Management. Its dissolution upset the NIR regional officials and provoked strong negative reactions from the Negrenses. Demographics Geography Aerial view of the City of San Carlos, Negros Occidental Negros is the second largest island in the Visayas (after Samar) and the fourth largest of the Philippines, with a total land area of . It is located between the islands of Panay and Guimaras to the west and Cebu to the east, with Siquijor located on the toe of the island and the islands of Bantayan to the north. Politically and linguistically, Negros is divided into two provinces: Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental. This division of the island, which roughly follows the mountain range in the center of the island, corresponds to the two linguistic groups. The western half (Occidental) is home to the Ilonggo-speaking population while the eastern half (Oriental) is home to the Cebuano-speaking population. Together, they are all called as Negrenses. Kanlaon Volcano, located in the central-northern part of the island is the third most-active volcano in the Philippines and overlooks bordering communities and the city of Bacolod to the west. It is the highest peak of the whole island and of the Visayas. Other notable peaks on the island are Mount Silay and Mount Mandalagan in Negros Occidental and Mount Talinis (also known as Cuernos de Negros) in Negros Oriental. There are also lakes that dot the island, among the most notable are the Balinsasayao Twin Lakes in Negros Oriental. The volcanic activity in Negros is harnessed into electricity through two geothermal power plants in the island. One is located in Palinpinon of Valencia in Negros Oriental and the other is in Mailum of Bago City in Negros Occidental, but was eventually shut down. Administrative divisions The island of Negros is composed of 2 provinces, 1 highly urbanized city, 18 component cities, 38 municipalities and 1,219 barangays. Negros Occidental is designated as part of Western Visayas and Negros Oriental is designated as part of Central Visayas.

Negros Occidental has the most chartered cities amongst all the provinces in the Philippines. The province comprises 13 cities and 19 municipalities, which are further subdivided into 601 barangays. Although Bacolod serves as the capital, it is governed independently from its corresponding province as a highly urbanized city. Negros Oriental comprises 6 cities and 19 municipalities, with 557 barangays. { class=\\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  City ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;white-space:nowrap;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Population ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" colspan=2  Area ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" colspan=2  Density ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  City class ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Income class ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Province - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid;\\"  km2 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:none solid solid none;white-space:nowrap;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  sq mi ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid;\\"  /km2 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:none solid solid none;white- space:nowrap;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  /sq mi ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border- top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background- color:initial;\\"  Bacolod  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  561,875   Highly urbanized  1st  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Bago  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  170,981   Component  2nd  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Bais  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  76,291   Component  3rd  Negros Oriental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Bayawan  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  117,900   Component  2nd  Negros Oriental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Cadiz  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  154,723   Component  2nd  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Canlaon  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  54,509   Component  4th  Negros Oriental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Dumaguete  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  131,377   Component  2nd  Negros Oriental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Escalante  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  94,070   Component  4th  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Guihulngan  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  95,969   Component  5th  Negros Oriental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Himamaylan  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  106,880   Component  3rd  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background- color:initial;\\"  Kabankalan  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  181,977   Component  1st  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  La Carlota  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  64,469   Component  4th  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Sagay  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  146,264   Component  3rd  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  San Carlos  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  132,536   Component  2nd  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Silay  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  126,930   Component  3rd  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Sipalay  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  70,070   Component  4th  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Talisay  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  102,214   Component  4th  Negros Occidental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Tanjay  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  80,532   Component  4th  Negros Oriental - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\"  Victorias  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  87,933   Component  4th  Negros Occidental } Transportation Both provinces of Negros are interconnected by major inter-provincial roads. In Bacolod, there are two main roads, namely Lacson Street to the north and Araneta Street to the south. Cities, especially the provincial capitals of Bacolod and Dumaguete, are being served by jeepneys and taxis. Tricycles are mainly used for short-distance travel, and is common in city barangays, smaller cities and towns. Bus stations are present in major cities and towns within the region. Vallacar Transit Corporation, which operates the Ceres buses, serves the whole island of Negros. There are regularly scheduled fast ferry and roll-on/roll-off services for the island region's coastal cities and towns. =Airports= Currently, there are two airports serving Negros island. The Bacolod-Silay International Airport, located in the city of Silay, serves the general area of Bacolod Metropolitan Area, and is expected to become the primary international gateway to Negros. The Dumaguete-Sibulan Airport, located in the town of Sibulan, serves the general area of Dumaguete and its neighbouring towns. However, a new airport is being planned to be constructed in the town of Bacong, south of Dumaguete, to replace the older airport in Sibulan. International * Bacolod-Silay International Airport Domestic * Dumaguete-Sibulan Airport * Kabankalan Airport (under construction) * Sipalay Airport Economy Vast sugarcane plantations near Bacolod Negros is noted for being the nation's prime producer and exporter of sugar. Sugarcane plantations abound in the agricultural areas of the island. The island also produces cotton and hardwood. Sugar is the biggest industry in the island, followed by organic agricultural products and gamefowl breeding. Its principal sugar-growing region is located in the north and west of the island, stretching from northwest along the coasts of the Visayan Sea and Guimaras Strait, which is one of the nation's principal lowland areas in the Visayas. Negros is now aiming to be the prime producer of organic agricultural produce in Asia. Sugar refining has many by-products such as acetylene, fertilizers and rum. Fishing is the major industry based in Cadiz City. There are also a number of fishponds and prawn farming has become a major industry. Bacolod City is the center of commerce and finance in Negros. It is where oil companies, factories, bottling plants, allied industrial businesses, steel fabrication, power generation, agri-businesses, prawn culture and other aqua-culture ventures are found. By November 2016, Negros generated a total net worth of ‚Ç± billion, placing its provinces among the richest in the country. Tourism Negros has a lot of tourist attractions. In the city of Silay alone, there are 30 ancestral houses, amongst the most notable is the Balay Negrense. Festivals are also a major tourist attraction in Negros, among the most notable, is the Masskara Festival in the city of Bacolod, which is celebrated during the third week of October, as well as Buglasan Festival in the city of Dumaguete, also held in October. Museums showcase the culture, history and people of Negros, with one example being the Negros Museum, situated behind the Negros Occidental Provincial Capitol Complex. Murcia and Salvador Benedicto offer experiences in inland Negros Occidental, the former being known for its Mambukal Resort, while the latter serves as the \\"Summer Capital of Negros Occidental\\". Kanlaon Volcano, as well as many other neighbouring peaks, are popular amongst mountain climbers and hikers visiting Negros. The town of Pulupandan, situated in the western tip of Negros, is becoming popular to bird-watching enthusiasts. thanks to its new bird-watching sanctuary. When it comes to beaches and coastal resorts within the region, the most popular ones are Lakawon Island in Cadiz City, Jomabo Island in Escalante City, Sipaway/Refugio Island in the city of San Carlos, Sipalay City, Hinoba-an and Manjuyod's sand bar. The top attractions in Cauayan are the Punta Bulata White Beach Resort and Danjugan Island, which serves as a major diving spot in Negros Occidental. Also, a marine reserve is established in Sagay City, which protects the marine life and reefs of Carbin and Maca, making it a popular draw for marine life enthusiasts. Dauin is known for its beach resorts and Apo Island, a famous diving spot and marine reserve in Negros Oriental. The city of Dumaguete is popular amongst students, largely because of its presence as a university city in the region. Bais City has since then become a tourist spot for whale and dolphin watching, due to its coastline touching the Ta√±on Strait. Antulang Beach Resort and Tambobo Bay, as well as the inland Lake Balanan serve as three important attractions in the town of Siaton. Situated within the towns of Sibulan, San Jose and Valencia is the Balinsasayao Twin Lakes Natural Park, which serves as an important draw for tourists going to inland Negros Oriental. Energy The Palinpinon Geothermal power plant The island is known for using geothermal energy to provide electricity for its inhabitants. In San Carlos, Negros Occidental where energy company San Carlos Solar Energy (SaCaSol) is located, solar energy is being used to power the city and surrounding municipalities.Official Website of SaCaSol Inland towns and cities of Negros uses hydroelectric power acquired from springs, rivers and waterfalls. Due to the island region's sugarcane-based agriculture, Negros may become the nation's major biofuel producer, with sugarcane being used for ethanol production. Endangered species Negros, like the Central Philippines (Visayas) overall, is generally recognized as a top priority area for wildlife conservation, both in terms of numbers of endemic species and severity of threat. More than half of the critically endangered species listed in the Philippines occurs in Negros. It is the most threatened area of the Philippines, since it has the least remaining forest cover and the highest numbers of severely threatened endemic species and subspecies. Mt. Silay and Mt. Mandalagan are the two mountain peaks in the Northern Negros Natural Park. These mountains have old-growth forests. Threatened species recorded in this area include the white-winged cuckooshrike, Visayan flowerpecker, flame- templed babbler, writhed-billed hornbill, Visayan tarictic hornbill, rufous- lored kingfisher, blue-naped parrot and Philippine hawk-eagle.Developing Field Research Priorities in Negros Island (West Visayas, Philippines) with particular reference to key threatened endemic species, September 2008, by Bristol Clifton and West of England Zoological Society Fauna and Flora International ‚Äì Philippines Biodiversity Conservation Programme Philippines Biodiversity Conservation Foundation, Inc.

The anion gap (AG) without potassium is calculated first and if a metabolic acidosis is present, results in either a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) or a normal anion gap acidosis (NAGMA). A low anion gap is usually an oddity of measurement, rather than a clinical concern. Equation The equation for calculating the delta ratio is:\\\\frac{[AG]-12}{24-[HCO_3^-]}, where AG = [Na+] - ([Cl‚àí] + [HCO]) and reflects either an increase in the anion gap or a decrease in the bicarbonate concentration ([HCO3¬Ø]). Results The ratio gives one of four results: # < 0.4 due to a pure NAGMA # 0.4 ‚Äì 0.8 due to a mixed NAGMA + HAGMA # 0.8 ‚Äì 2.0 due to a pure HAGMA # >2.0 due to a mixed HAGMA + metabolic alkalosis Results 2 and 4 are the ones which have mixed acid-base disorders. Results 1. and 4. are oddities, mathematically speaking: Result 1: if there is a normal anion gap acidosis, the [ AG ‚Äì 12 ] part of the equation will be close to zero, the delta ratio will be close to zero and there is no mixed acid-base disorder. Your calculations can stop here. A normal anion gap acidosis (NAGMA) has more to do with a change in [Cl¬Ø]) or [HCO3¬Ø] concentrations. So the AG doesn't change; but to maintain electrical equilibrium, if [Cl¬Ø] goes up, [HCO3¬Ø] must come down. Hence, hyperchloremia always causes a metabolic acidosis as [HCO3¬Ø] must fall; alternatively, if the [HCO3¬Ø] rises, the [Cl¬Ø] must fall. For a list of the common causes of this change in bicarbonate or chloride, see normal anion gap acidosis. Results 2‚Äì4 all involve HAGMAs. A high anion gap metabolic acidosis usually occurs because of an increase in anions. So in the equation: : AG = [Na‚Å∫] ‚Äì ([Cl¬Ø] + [HCO3¬Ø] + [A¬Ø]) it is the [A¬Ø] that is the cause. For a list of the common anions responsible, see high anion gap metabolic acidosis. KULT is probably the easiest of the mnemonics to use [ Ketones, Uremia, Lactate, Toxins ]. Toxins are an uncommon cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis ‚Äì a list of the commonest toxins is ACE GIFTs [ibid]. Metformin as a pure toxicological cause is vanishingly rare. Result 4: if the result of the ratio is greater than 2 in a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, it is usually because there was a pre-existing higher than normal bicarbonate level. This is commonly found in people with chronic respiratory acidosis from chronic lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who can't breathe off their excess carbon dioxide owing to poor lung function, and retain bicarb in order to counteract the acidosis caused by the retained CO2. Alternatively it could be caused by a concurrent metabolic alkalosis such as vomiting causing acid loss and hence alkalosis, or diuretic use with loss of Cl¬Ø and a compensatory bicarb retention in order to maintain plasma electrical neutrality.UpToDate.com The Œîanion gap/ŒîHCO3 ratio in patients with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis Mathematically this is reflected in a high anion gap, but because the bicarbonate was high to start, it will appear to fall only a small amount. When this happens the numerator is large, the denominator is small, and the result is a delta ratio which is high [ > 2 ]. This means a combined high anion gap metabolic acidosis and a pre-existing either respiratory acidosis or metabolic alkalosis (causing the high bicarbonate) ‚Äì i.e. a mixed acid-base metabolic acidosis. Result 3: if there is a pure HAGMA, the bicarb would be expected to fall at a similar rate as the anion gap rises, since one molecule of acid combines with one molecule of bicarb buffer. So the equation above should be balanced as the change in the AG away from normal [12 ] is similar to the change in bicarb away from normal [24]. Mathematically, if the change in the numerator is similar to the change in the denominator, the delta ratio will be close to 1. Since the anions are unable to diffuse out of the bloodstream, while bicarbonate and hydrogen ions diffuse with ease (as H‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ, carbonic acid), the usual result will be closer to a delta ratio of 1 to 2. Lactic acidosis usually causes a ratio of 1.6. Result 2: if the delta ratio is somewhere between low (<0.4) and high (1‚Äì2), then it is usually due to a combination of high anion gap metabolic acidosis and normal anion gap acidosis. For example, a person with cholera may have a normal anion gap acidosis due to diarrhea, but becomes progressively dehydrated and develops a lactic acidosis from shock, and proceeds to develop a high anion gap metabolic acidosis ‚Äì i.e. a mixed acid-base disorder.

The estate lies on the banks of the River Tay in some , about north of Edinburgh. It was owned by the Douglas family in the latter part of the 19th century, and a new house was erected in 1865. A dovecote by the house was listed as Grade B on 9 June 1981. The house was purchased by author J. K. Rowling in 2001. History Killiechassie Estate has existed for centuries, and historically fell within the civil parish of Logierait. The name Killiechassie means \\"the church of the steep face\\" which refers to a church which stood on the hill there. This was part of the earldom of Atholl and was then granted by M√°el Coluim, Earl of Atholl, to Scone Abbey in the 12th century. An Ordnance Survey map of 1862. Features marked include a fountain, kennel, mausoleum and well. The River Tay is shown running to the east of the estate. In the 17th century the estate was owned by members of Clan Murray who were the Dukes of Atholl. Later proprietors of Killiechassie included the Robertson family, who belonged to the house of Struan. In 1727 the estate was owned by the Reverend Robert Stewart, who left money for a chapel to be built there. On his death in 1729 he was buried here, followed by his wife, Anne, a year later. According to legend, Bonnie Prince Charlie was reputed to have sheltered in a sycamore tree here on his retreat to Inverness in 1746 during the Jacobite rising of 1745‚Äì46. A small loch in the vicinity is, according to superstition, occupied by a Celtic water spirit. In 1850 the estate was documented to be held by a Miss Fleming, when it was described by poet David Millar as \\"almost opposite Aberfeldy, a sweet place, but capable of much greater embellishment.\\" In the later 19th century the estate was owned by the Douglas family, and an Edward Octavius Douglas, nephew of John Douglas, 7th Marquess of Queensberry held it in 1871, and a Hannah Charlotte Douglas by 1892. In 1865 the older house was replaced with a new one. The Laird of Killiechassie is listed in the 1956 Scottish Record Society publication A Directory of Landownership in Scotland, c. 1770, ed. Loretta Timperley. On 26 December 2001 British author J. K. Rowling married Neil Murray at Killiechassie, the ceremony being held in the library. She had bought the estate a month earlier as a retreat from press and public intrusion. She was reported to have paid ¬£440,000 (¬£500,000 according to some) for another house which shared the same drive and then paid around ¬£1.5 million for of farmland adjacent to the property. Architecture Killiechassie estate on the banks of the Tay The current house was built in 1865. A freestanding dovecote, built from rubble at this time, is a grade B listed feature, having a \\"Gothic, symmetrical frontage with centre tower and pyramid roof\\", with jerkin-head gables. However, the house remains classified as a Georgian property, and Country Life notes that it retains the feel of a Georgian building, although with intensive alteration, and now features double-glazing, \\"mock-Georgian\\" doors, and \\"fake stone cladding\\". There are two halls, a dining room, a drawing room, a morning room, and seven bedrooms, with a two-bedroom extension on the west wing. The swimming pool is covered with copper domes. Since Rowling has acquired the property she has undertaken extensive security measures, with a state-of-the-art electronic security system, including gates and a CCTV camera, and guards 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Aberfeldy distillery (part of the Dewar's group), school, Castle Menzies and General Wade's bridge across the Tay at Aberfeldy are in the vicinity.

They are regarded as being the most powerful class of diesel locomotives to be built in France. Ninety-two locomotives were produced between 1967 and 1974, numbered CC 72001 to CC 72092. The last regular workings of the type were conducted during August 2019. Development and design During the 1960s, French national railway operator SNCF investigated the use of high-power diesel locomotives for heavy express trains on its non-electrified major lines. Following trials of prototype locomotives during the mid-1960s, which were considerably more powerful than any equivalent previously operated by the SNCF, it chose to order 92 locomotives for mixed passenger and high speed freight traffic. Designated CC 72000, the class was a six-axle diesel-electric locomotive. Each locomotive had one SACM 16 cylinder four-stroke diesel engine of 3,550 horsepower (2,650 KW) driving an alternator whose output was rectified by silicon rectifiers. There were two traction motors, each mounted on a 3-axle monomotor bogie with two-speed gearing. A unique feature of the monomotor design was the choice of two speed settings, which was intended to benefit its dual use on both freight and passenger services; selecting the 85 km/h max speed 'regime marchandises' maximized tractive effort (beneficial when hauling heavy freight trains), while the 140/160 km/h max speed 'regime voyageurs' was suited for higher speed express trains. The cab design provided enhanced collision protection for its crew, but otherwise followed traditional practices. The exterior of the locomotive originally bore the operator's standard blue and white livery, produced by designer Paul Arzens. Between 2002 and 2004, thirty locomotives were rebuilt with SEMT Pielstick engines, after which they were re-designated as SNCF Class CC 72100. The original power units had been considered to be noisy and smoky, which had led to a ban of the type by Swiss authorities from Basel‚Äôs SNCF station in the early-2000s. The rebuilt locomotives are numbers: 21, 30, 37‚Äì41, 43, 45, 47, 48, 51, 56‚Äì60, 63, 66, 68, 72, 75‚Äì80, 82, 86, 89‚Äì90. In addition to the domestic production run, Alsthom marketed the locomotive to the export market. These efforts led to 14 locomotives closely resembling the CC72000 being built for Morocco in 1969, numbering them DF100-114. In 2006, Moroccan operator ONCF procured six redundant CC72000s from SNCF to supplement their existing fleet, renumbering these as DF115-120. In Morocco, they have been operated for freight and passenger services on non-electrified routes. During the early 1980s, the Portuguese Railways procured a batch of 13 CP Class 1900 and 17 CP Class 1930 locomotives, which had a strong family resemblance to the CC72000. These locomotives were locally manufactured by Sorefame having secured a production license arrangement with Alsthom. The Class 1900s were tasked with heavy freight work, while the slightly faster Class 1930s performed express passenger services. Operational history The type was manufactured at Alsthom's works in Belfort, eastern France, between 1967 and 1974. On 20 December 1967, the first CC 72000 was delivered to SNCF. As more examples followed, the locomotive was initially operated upon the main lines to Brittany in the north-west; it soon began to replace both less powerful diesels and many of the remaining express steam locomotives. The type operated services across the national network, including those between Nantes, Bordeaux and Toulouse in the south-west, between Lyon, Mulhouse, Geneva, Annecy and Grenoble in the east; as well as the core Paris to Clermont-Ferrand route. The final unit was delivered on 21 June 1974. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the SNCF continued its policy of railway electrification, which resulted in a gradual but permanent decline in the need for diesel-hauled express passenger services. Accordingly, the CC72000s were often transferred to new areas, as well as being increasingly used for freight traffic. Despite this progression, the type was heavily used well into the 2000s on various lines, including Dijon-Reims, Paris-Laon and Amiens-Calais, for passenger services. After new SNCF Class BB 75000 diesels began arriving in 2006, as well as a general drop in freight traffic around this time, the type began to be permanently withdrawn. By early 2010, only four original CC72000s remained. Between 1999 and 2005, Nos. CC72061/062/064 were fitted with Scharfenberg couplers, enabling them to haul TGV Atlantique sets along the unelectrified line between Nantes and Les Sables-d‚ÄôOlonne; this prevented any conventional services being run with these three locomotives as the modification necessitated the removal of their buffers. During August 2019, the CC72000 performed its last regular workings. Preservation CC 72029 is preserved at Cit√© du Train, Mulhouse.

In 2005, she formed Companhia Urbana de Dan√ßa, a hip hop group, which has achieved increasing international recognition. Destri has recruited and trained dancers from Rio's favelas, whatever their social or ethnic backgrounds. Early life and education Born in Rio de Janeiro, Destri was born into an Italian family. Her father was a company lawyer, her mother painted, and she has a sister and two brothers. She spent her childhood in one of the rather British suburbs where, following her sister's example, she attended ballet classes from the age of four. The French teacher quickly recognized her talent and she continued her training until she was 15. While she was studying psychology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, she realized she could take jazz and modern dance classes in her spare time. She later graduated as a Bachelor of Fine Arts in dance. Career Destri moved in and out of Brazil, studying jazz, classical ballet and dance at every opportunity. Training with Pina Bausch, Alwin Nikolais and Twyla Tharp, she has also gained experience in theatre, television and film, collaborating with Mauricio Sherman, Roberto Talma, Marly Tavares and Lennie Dale. In the 1990s, she went to Germany to teach contemporary dance and Brazilian jazz at Tanz Hause in D√ºsseldorf and in dance schools in Cologne and around Germany. She became increasingly interested in urban dance, street jazz and hip hop, both in Germany and on her return to Brazil. As a result of her growing interests, when she returned to Brazil she set up Companhia Urbana de Dan√ßa, recruiting dancers from the poorer suburbs and favelas of Rio de Janeiro. The group came into its own after performing at the Biennale de Lyon in 2006. Since then, many of the dancers in the group have changed while Destri has consistently encouraged the participation of members of Brazil's three cultural groups, indigenous, European and African, irrespective of their social background. The company has also performed in Biarritz (2008), Rouen (2010) and Suresnes (2011). They have also appeared at various venues in the United States. Their 2010 d√©but at the New York City Center was ranked among the top 10 dance performances of the year. In 2013, for the first time, the group received some government funding, opening opportunities for the future.

The company was founded by Jan Ihmels and Orly Furhman, two academics from Cambridge and Stanford respectively. Lingua.ly operates under the freemium business model and exists as a Cloud-based web app and mobile app available for Android and iOS. Launch After its beta launch in August 2013, the company's extension for Google Chrome saw widespread early adoption in the US, Spain, and Latin America as a spaced repetition vocabulary acquisition tool. Several publications have recommended Lingua.ly as a free platform for language learning. In April 2014 Lingua.ly launched its mobile app for Android, achieving 100K downloads in its first month on the Google Play Store. Lingua.ly released a stand-alone web app in June 2014, which was met with largely positive reviews, including coverage in the New York Times. Most recently, Lingua.ly released an iOS mobile app in July 2014, which was quickly listed as one of the top iPhone apps of the week. In February 2014 the company won the regional 1776 Challenge Cup's Innovation in Education Award for its patent pending algorithm and language learning platform. In May 2014 Lingua.ly was selected as one of eight global finalists for the Challenge Cup.  Approach  While traditional language immersion entails a target language rich environment where the user is exposed to ample linguistic input from various sources, Lingua.ly utilizes digital language immersion, a method of employing a virtual learning environment to simulate the language learning environment. Users are exposed to authentic input in their target language through their computer, tablet, or mobile device as opposed to lesson-based instruction. Duolingo and Bliu Bliu are other examples of language education tech startups that also partially rely on a digital language immersion approach. In classroom learning, language immersion is often used to teach children in bilingual or content and language integrated learning programs. Digital language immersion is the E-learning extension of these trends. Lingua.ly relies on a number of applied linguistics principles, including the Natural Approach and Krashen's Input Hypothesis, which argues that fluent language learners benefit most from language they acquire through exposure rather than direct instruction.  Technology and platform  Lingua.ly's platform contains an online and mobile dictionary powered by Babylon that learners can use to look up words from the web in their target language. Through a learner's collected words and click-patterns, the technology maps an individual's vocabulary in the target language. It then rates the suitability of online content suggestions in the target language in order to create an environment for language acquisition based on a 90:10 percentage of known to unknown words. Users customize vocabulary flashcards with images, audio, and example sentences and practice them at spaced repetition intervals to enhance acquisition and transfer into long-term memory.  EdTech for languages  Lingua.ly is part of a growing trend of digital language education startups including, Memrise, Busuu, Babbel and Duolingo that are attracting significant investment funding and unseating former industry leader Rosetta Stone.

She has also worked with FSN. Early life Murphy was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. She kept to her Chicago roots and attended Northwestern University from 1977-1980, acting as a two-year captain for the women's basketball team. During her senior season, Murphy was a finalist for the Wade Trophy as one of the top players in the nation. Coaching career After graduating from college, Murphy served as a student graduate assistant at the University of Notre Dame for three seasons while earning a master's degree in business administration. She then moved to Notre Dame as an assistant coach for two year. Murphy was hired as head coach at the University of Wisconsin- Madison in 1986. In 1992 she led the Badgers to their first NCAA Tournament appearance, compiling a 20-9 overall record and a 13-5 conference record in the Big Ten. Over eight seasons Murphy compiled an 87-135 record at Wisconsin. Her time at Wisconsin was not without controversy. At least one player sued Murphy claiming she had caused her emotional harm and caused her to leave the team. The charges were eventually dropped by the courts. After leaving Wisconsin, Murphy became the head coach at Cal State Hayward from 1995-1996. Murphy left college coaching to become the first head coach and the general manager of the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs in 1997. Murphy would coach the team for the first 15 games, compiling a 5-10 record, before being fired in the midst of a 5-game losing streak that dropped the Monarchs from first to third in their division. Broadcasting Upon being let go by the Monarchs, Murphy was hired by Brian Donlon, Lifetime Television's vice president of sports and executive producer, to be part of its WNBA broadcast team along with Michele Tafoya and Reggie Miller. Murphy started with her own halftime feature, \\"Murphy's Law\\" before joining Miller and Tafoya as a game analyst. When Lifetime ended its WNBA broadcasts in 1999, Murphy moved to ESPN for women's NCAA tournament games and WNBA broadcasts while FOX would bring her on board to call the Pac-12 women's games on FSN in the early 2000s. Others would follow suit. In 2007 Murphy was hired as one of BTN's announcers, and in 2012 she was hired as an analyst for Pac-12 Network. Today Murphy continues to act as an analyst for first round NCAA women's tournament games on ESPN, girls high school championship broadcasts on Comcast, Monday Night's BTN game of the week, select Pac-12 games, and as color analyst for the Los Angeles Sparks on Spectrum SportsNet.

After two earlier Grizedale Halls had preceded, it was built anew in 1905 in the style of Gothic Revival architecture. During World War II it became No 1 Prisoner-of-war camp to hold German officers and was finally pulled down in 1957. Old Grizedale Hall (built 17th century) The Grizedale estate had been acquired by the Rawlinson family in 1614 who kept it for some generations and it is assumed that the old Grizedale Hall had been built around that time. In the mid- eighteenth century Richard Ford came into possession of part of the Grizedale estate, though probably not of the hall itself, which by that time had become a farmhouse, known as the Grizedale Hall Farm. In the 1800s the old hall was demolished and a new farm house was built on its site which exists today under the name Grizedale Home Farm. Grizedale New Hall (built 1841) In approximately 1745 Richard Ford built a new home in Grizedale known as Ford Lodge situated 250 yards east of the old hall. His great-grandson Montague Ainslie who inherited Grizedale estate in the early nineteenth century turned his family's country cottage into a larger residence in 1841, which became known as Grizedale New Hall. It was pulled down around 1904 to make way for a large country house. Grizedale Hall (built 1905) Remaining garden terrace of Grizedale Hall in 2007 In 1903 Harold Brocklebank, a wealthy Liverpool based merchant and shipping magnate bought Grizedale estate. He was born in 1853, being the third son of Sir Thomas Brocklebank, 1st Baronet. After the old hall was pulled down, Harold Brocklebank completely rebuilt Grizedale Hall in 1905, the interior design having been completed by 1907. The architects of the new stone-built 40-room mansion in neo-gothic style were Walker, Carter & Walker of Windermere, Cumbria. Brocklebank inhabited Grizedale Hall with his wife Mary Ellen Brogden, three daughters and two sons until his death in 1936, when the hall and the 4,500 acre estate were taken up by the Forestry Commission. After serving as the first prisoner-of-war camp in the United Kingdom from 1939 to 1946, the hall stood empty. Due to its high maintenance costs the Forestry Commission auctioned off the fittings, fireplaces and staircases and demolished the hall in 1957, leaving only the single-storey adjoining building with storage rooms on the east side of the hall as well as the garden terrace. For several years the grounds were used as a campsite by the Camping and Caravanning Club. Some architectural remains of the hall like the walls and stairs of the massive garden terrace and the close with its gates can still be seen today, the car-park of the Grizedale Forest visitor centre being placed on top of the internal side of the former house. No 1 POW camp During World War II Grizedale Hall was commandeered by the War Office and became officially known as No 1 POW Camp (Officers) Grizedale Hall since 1939, to hold the most elite of German P.O.W.'s like General Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt. As many of the prisoners were rescued survivors from sunken U-boats, it also became known as the \\"U-Boat Hotel\\". A well-known prisoner was Otto Kretschmer, Germany's most successful U-boat captain until his capture. The camp incorporated watchtowers, a double perimeter fence that encircled the house and around thirty huts. Together these could hold around 300 prisoners. The camp also had a kitchen garden, a football pitch and a library containing German-language books. The fighter pilot Franz Baron von Werra was initially held there and made a famous escape attempt in late 1940, inspiring the story of the 1957 film The One That Got Away, Grizedale Hall serving as the film site just shortly before its destruction. Other known prisoners were rear-admiral Hans Voss, SS-general Maximilian von Herff and U-boat commander Werner Lott. The camp was emptied in 1946 of all remaining prisoners to be repatriated to Germany and Austria. The POW camp Grizedale Hall also inspired the 1970 war drama film The McKenzie Break and is site of the 1989 thriller A Cage of Eagles by James Follet. Italian PoWs were also housed here, some carrying out gardening and other jobs in the local area. The Yan The Yan in 2009 A new building for the Grizedale Forest visitor centre called \\"The Yan\\" (Cumbrian for One) was built in 2008 in extension of the remaining annex to the former hall, a construction of timber and natural stone, designed by Sutherland Hussey Architects of Edinburgh and opened on 23 June 2008 by Lord Clark of Windermere.

He sat in the Irish House of Commons and held office as Chief Justice of Munster and Deputy Admiralty judge.Costello, Kevin The Irish Court of Admiralty 1575-1839 Four Courts Press Dublin 2011 p.15 He is now mainly remembered for his friendship with Francis Bacon. He was also famous in his own lifetime for his wit: a few of his jokes still survive. Early career Francis Bacon aged 18, around the time his friendship with Gosnold began. He was the son of John Gosnold, a member of the well-known Gosnold family of Otley, Suffolk and his wife Katherine Kinellmarsh; the explorer Bartholomew Gosnold was his cousin. The family name is also spelt Gosnell, Gosling or Gosnard. The year of his birth is uncertain, but was probably shortly after 1560, as we know from his own testimony that he was over 80 in 1646. Henry went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1577, and Staple Inn; he entered Gray's Inn in 1581.Alumni Cantabrigienses Vol.1 p.242 As a student he had a reputation for wit, and it may have been this which earned him the friendship of Francis Bacon, who is said have been a distant relative.Jardine, L. and Stewart, A. Hostage to Fortune- the troubled life of Francis Bacon New York 1999 p.140 The closeness between the two men continued after their student days; in July 1592 they visited Twickenham together, and the friendship survived Henry's departure to Ireland in 1594.Nichols, John The Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth I Reissued by Oxford University Press 2014 Vol.3 p.599 At least one of his jokes (a rather laboured one for modern tastes) survives, concerning Bacon's determined but ultimately unsuccessful battle to persuade Elizabeth I to appoint him, rather than Sir Edward Coke, as Attorney General. Gosnold quipped: \\"if it please her Majesty, the Bacon may be too hard for the Cook (Coke)\\".\\"Green, Dominic The Double life of Doctor Lopez Century London 2004 p.265 In Ireland Gosnell first went to Ireland as secretary to Lord Russell, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, a post for which Bacon (whose aunt Elizabeth Cooke was married to Russell's brother John) may have recommended him.Birch, Thomas Memoirs of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth I from the year 1581 till her death London 1754 p.184 He wrote to Bacon about the expedition in 1594 to relieve Enniskillen Castle, which was under siege (this was one of the first military actions of the Nine Years War), and gave his first impressions of the country. Unlike some English settlers of the time he found the Irish climate agreeable, praising \\"the clemency of the air and the healthiness of the soil\\", but he disliked the Irish people: \\"for cruelty and beggary I would never wish (to be in) a worse place\\".Birch p.184 Judge in Munster In 1596 he became Attorney General for the Province of Munster. Promotion in the Provincial Court of Munster usually involved a progression from the office of Attorney General to that of Second Justice and then to Chief Justice of Munster. Henry duly followed this path, becoming Second Justice in 1608 and Chief Justice in 1624. He was also the Admiralty judge for the province for much of his judicial career; but alternated in that office with his West Cork neighbour Sir Robert Travers, despite frequent complaints, even from the Crown itself, about Travers's corruption, which led to repeated demands for his removal from officeCostello p.15 Until 1635 Munster was the only regional Admiralty court: its judge acted as Deputy for the Lord Chancellor of Ireland in his capacity as the senior Admiralty judge.Costello p.15 Earl of Essex Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, Gosnold's first patron. Gosnold, like Francis Bacon, was a prot√©g√© of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to whom he was distantly related, and during Essex's time in Ireland was in regular attendance on him. Essex's return to England, and subsequent downfall, were deeply troubling for Gosnold: he wrote anxiously to Essex in November 1599 about the rumours of his disgrace, which he trusted (wrongly) would prove to be unfounded.Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House Vol.9 pp.385-402 Politics After the downfall and execution for treason of Essex in 1601, Gosnold, like most of the prominent men of Munster, became a client of the \\"Great Earl\\", Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. Lord Cork built up a political empire in County Cork by the foundation of new towns, which became Parliamentary boroughs returning his own nominees to the Irish Parliament. Gosnold, together with the Chief Justice of Munster Sir Edward Harris, sat in the Parliament of 1613-5 as MP for Clonakilty. He served for a time as Recorder of Youghal, stepping down in 1617. His closest Irish links were with Bandon, another of the new towns of Cork, of which he was a burgess in 1612.Costello p.15 Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, Gosnold's later patron. Admiralty judge As Admiralty judge in the 1620s he clashed repeatedly with Henry De Laune, the French-born Vice-Admiral for Munster.Costello p.15 De Laune objected to Gosnold's insistence that all goods seized from pirate vessels be subjected to the proper judicial process, and complained of the paltry size of his awards; Gosnold in return accused De Laune of keeping the prize goods for himself. By the lax standards of the age Gosnold, in contrast to his notoriously corrupt rival Sir Robert Travers, was an honest official. He did inquire in the 1630s if he could keep the fines he imposed, but dutifully complied with an instruction from the Crown that this would be improper.Costello p.15 Last years He continued in office as Admiralty judge into the early 1640s,Costello p.15 but during the Irish Rebellion of 1641 he was unable to exercise his judicial functions. Like many landowners in Munster, notably Lord Cork's sons, he suffered heavy losses as a result of the Rebellion, though he was more fortunate than his rival Travers, who was killed at the Battle of Knocknanuss. In 1646 he petitioned the English Parliament for compensation, pleading that he was more than 80 years old and in acute financial distress. The Provincial Court of Munster was abolished in 1655. Gosnold, who is known to have reached \\"a great age\\", may still have been alive at the time, but he was probably dead by 1658. Family He was married twice: his first wife was Wilgeford George and his second wife was called Fenton (she may have been a relative of Lord Cork's second wife Catherine Fenton). He had several children, of whom at least two, John and Rachel, survived to adulthood. His descendants were mostly associated with Skibereen. They usually spelt their family name Gosnell or Gosling.MacLysaght, Edward The Surnames of Ireland Irish University Press 1973 p. 133 References https://www.findmypast.com.au/transcript?id=SURREY%2FFHS%2FMAR%2F0146661%2F1 Category:People from Suffolk Coastal (district) Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Cork constituencies Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland Category:Irish MPs 1613‚Äì1615 Category:Chief Justices of Munster Category:1560s births Category:1650s deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Year of death uncertain ","title":"Henry Gosnold"},{"id":"42350115","text":"Wilson Tovey (16 October 1874 - 4 March 1950) was an English cricketer.

Originally trained in France, he showed promise when racing on turf by winning twice and being placed in several important races before being transferred to race on Tapeta in Dubai in 2012. He won the Godolphin Mile in 2012 and the Burj Nahaar in both 2012 and 2013 before recording his most important success in the 2014 Dubai World Cup. Background African Story is a chestnut gelding with a narrow white blaze bred in the United Kingdom by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. His sire Pivotal was a top class sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 1996. He went on to become an \\"excellent\\" sire, getting the winners of more than a thousand races across a range of distances including Farhh, Sariska, Somnus, Kyllachy and Excellent Art. African Story's dam, Blixen, won one minor race at the Curragh Racecourse in 2000, and was a great-granddaughter of the broodmare Mesopatamia, making her a distant relative of Halling and Mastery. African Story was sent into training with Andr√© Fabre in France. Racing career =2010-2011: early career= African Story was unraced as a two-year-old and did not race until the late autumn of his three-year-old season. He made his racecourse debut in the Prix Borax over 1600 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 9 November 2010 and won by two and a half lengths from seven opponents. Two weeks later at the same course and distance he started favourite for the Prix Sourbier and finished second to Round Midnight. African Story began his four-year-old season by winning the Prix d'Ailly over 1500 metres on the synthetic Fibresand course at Deauville Racecourse on 10 March. He then finished second at Longchamp in April and third in a race for amateur riders at Chantilly in May before being moved up in class for the Group Three Prix du Palais-Royal in June in which he finished fourth behind Sahpresa, Moonlight Cloud and Evaporation. In the Prix de la Porte Maillot over 1400 metres at Longchamp in July he produced a strong finish but failed by a head to catch Moonlight Cloud. On his final start for Fabre he finished third behind Zinabaa in the Prix Quincey at Deauville on 28 August. =2012: five-year-old season= At the end of the 2011 season, African Story was transferred to Dubai where he was trained by Saeed bin Suroor. Racing in the colours of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin team, he made his debut for his new trainer on 26 January 2012 when he won a handicap race over 1400 metres on the Tapeta surface at Meydan Racecourse. After finishing third in his next race, he started at odds of 5/1 for the Group Three Burj Nahaar over 1600 metres on 10 March. Ridden by Frankie Dettori, he took the lead in the straight and won \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths from Snaafy with the odds-on favourite Musir in third. Three weeks later on Dubai World Cup night, he started the 5/6 favourite for the Group 2 Godolphin Mile and won by four lengths from the South-African challenger Viscount Nelson. Dettori described the performance as a \\"push- button result\\" while Saeed bin Suroor said that \\"there are lots of options open to him and he is likely to come back to England\\". On his final appearance as a five-year-old, African Story was sent to Hong Kong in May to contest the Champions Mile at Sha Tin Racecourse, finishing sixth of the ten runners behind Xtension. =2013: six-year-old season= On his six-year-old debut, African Story repeated his 2012 success in the Burj Nahaar. Ridden by Mickael Barzalona he started the 11/4 favourite and won by two and a quarter lengths from Capital Attraction. He was strongly fancied for the 2013 Dubai World Cup and started the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Hunter's Light, Royal Delta and Animal Kingdom. Ridden again by Barzalona he made progress in the straight without ever looking likely to win and finished fifth of the twelve runners, seven lengths behind the winner Animal Kingdom. =2014: seven-year- old season= In early 2014, African Story contested two rounds of the Al Maktoum Challenge at Meydan. He finished second behind Prince Bishop in the second round on 6 February and then finished eighth behind the same horse when favourite for the third round on 8 March. On 29 March African Story contested the Dubai World Cup for the second time. Ridden by Silvestre de Sousa he started at odds of 12/1 in a field of sixteen which included Ruler of the World from Ireland, Military Attack and Akeed Mofeed from Hong Kong, and the multiple American Grade I winner Ron The Greek as well as runners from Britain, Japan and South Africa. African Story was settled just behind the leaders before overtaking the British five-year-old Mukhadram early in the straight and winning by two and a half lengths. His winning time of 2:01.61 was a new track record. After the race de Sousa said: \\"It's an amazing feeling and he just proved he's the best. He was very unlucky here last time when he banged his head in the stalls, but he has proved he's the boy\\". =2015: eight-year-old season= After a ten-month absence, African Story returned in the second round of the Al Maktoum Challenge at Meydan. Since his previous run the track had been converted from the synthetic Tapeta surface to dirt. He started the 9/4 favourite but never looked likely to win and finished seventh of the eleven runner behind Frankyfourfingers. In the third round of the Al Maktoum Challenge started 11/2 third choice in the betting behind Prince Bishop and Frankyfourfingers. Ridden by James Doyle, he tracked the leaders before moving to the front inside the final furlong and holding off the late challenge of Prince Bishop to win by a neck. On his final racecourse appearance the gelding attempted to repeat his 2014 success in the Dubai World Cup but finished sixth of the nine runners behind Prince Bishop. On 23 April it was announced that African Story would be retired from racing. Prince Bishop was retired on the same day and Saeed bin Suroor paid tribute to the pair saying \\"They were very tough and reliable racehorses... they could adapt quickly to their environment no matter where in the world they were taken to race.\\" Pedigree References Category:2007 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Dubai World Cup winners Category:Racehorses trained in the United Arab Emirates Category:Thoroughbred family 10-c ","title":"African Story"},{"id":"42350244","title":"Second Board of Ministers of Ceylon"},{"id":"42350248","text":"Andrew Sparkes Andrew Sparkes CMG (born 4 July 1959) is a former British diplomat who was ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kosovo and Nepal.

Winter time is the practice of shifting the clock back (compared to the standard time) during winter months, usually ‚àí1 hour. It is a form of daylight saving time which is the opposite compensation to the summer time (+1, +2). However, while summer time is widely applied, use of winter time has been and is very rare.  Czechoslovakia  Winter time was applied in Czechoslovakia by government ordinance no. 213/1946 Sb. from 1 December 1946 (3:00‚Üí2:00) to 23 February 1947 (2:00‚Üí3:00), authorized by act 212/1946 Sb., (\\"about the winter time\\"). This simple two-paragraph act, approved on 21 November 1946 and announced on 27 November 1946, authorised the government to implement winter time by ordinance at any time., year 1946, batch 92, page 140 in the year, page 1289 globally, issued on 27 November 1946: The government gave as the main reason for this provision the fact that power plants had approximately 10% lack of capacity in peak hours (07:00‚Äì08:00 and 16:00‚Äì20:00) and winter time should help to spread the load out.Government proposal of the Winter Time Act and the reason report, , 15 November 1946 The act was never cancelled and it theoretically authorises the government in the successor Czech Republic, as well as in the Slovak Republic, which adopted Czechoslovak law, to implement winter time again at any time. However, the experiment has never been repeated., history of the time adaptation in Czech lands, Kalend√°≈ô Bƒõda  Namibia  Namibia used winter time since 1994 until 2017. In this period Namibian Standard Time was at UTC+02:00 Central Africa Time in summer, and UTC+01:00 (West Africa Time) in winter. Winter time began on the first Sunday in April at 03:00, and lasted until the first Sunday in September, 02:00 hours. In the Zambezi Region in the far north-east of Namibia clocks were not changed and remained on Central Africa Time all year round so that during winter time, Namibia spanned two time zones. The Namibian Standard Time was thus UTC+02:00 (derived from South African Standard Time) in summer, and UTC+01:00 (equivalent to West Africa Time) in winter. The purpose was not to utilise additional hours of daylight in the evening, but to prevent children from walking to school in darkness in the morning, to decrease the risk of injuries and assaults.  Ireland  Ireland uses Irish Standard Time (IST, UTC+01:00; ) in the summer months and Greenwich Mean Time (UTC+0) in the winter period.Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 Ireland has adjusted clocks in Winter since 1971.Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971Standard Time Act, 1968 The Standard Time Act 1968 legally established that the time for general purposes in the State (to be known as standard time) shall be one hour in advance of Greenwich mean time throughout the year.Standard Time Act, 1968 This act was amended by the Standard Time (Amendment) Act 1971, which legally established Greenwich Mean Time as a winter time period. Ireland therefore operates one hour behind standard time during the winter period, and reverts to standard time in the summer months. This is defined in contrast to the other states in the European Union, which operate one hour ahead of standard time during the summer period, but produces the same end result. In Ireland, Winter time begins at 02:00 IST on the last Sunday in October (changing to 01:00 GMT), and ends at 01:00 GMT on the last Sunday in March (changing to 02:00 IST).  Chile  Until 2015, Continental Chile used the time offset UTC‚àí04:00 and Easter Island used UTC‚àí06:00 for standard time, with daylight saving time roughly between October and March every year. In January 2015 the Chilean government announced that the entire country will keep the time offset used during daylight saving time permanently. Indeed, there was no time change in 2015, however the annual time change was reinstated in 2016 after feedback from the public about an increase in truancy during the winter months, complaints about older computers and other electronic devices not using the right time zone, and fruit growers reporting a 15% loss in productivity. Chile returned to UTC‚àí04:00 for winter time for 3 months starting in 2016. This begins the second Saturday of May and ends on the second Saturday of August. Since 2017 a new time zone in the Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica region has been implemented, having 2 different zones in Continental Chile for the first time.

It is one of the two compositions for harpsichord and percussion written by Xenakis, the other one being Oophaa.  Composition  Xenakis composed Kombo√Ø after a long collaboration with both harpsichordist Elisabeth Chojnacka and percussionist , which at that time formed a duo and commissioned works for both instruments to other composers. As Xenakis worked previously with both musicians (he also composed Khoai for Chojnacka in 1976 and Psappha for Gualda in 1975), the composer was much more focused in exploring the timbral capabilities of both instruments by creating an homogeneous sound texture. It is indeed dedicated to Gualda and Chojnacka, the latter being the dedicatee of all five compositions for harpsichord by Xenakis. It was eventually premiered by the duo on December 22, 1981, at the Rencontres Internationales de Musique Contemporaine in Metz.  Analysis  The composition is in only one movement and takes approximately 17 minutes to perform. It is scored for one harpsichord, one vibraphone, two wood blocks, two bongos, three congas, four tom-toms, one bass drum, and seven terracotta flower pots. As put by Xenakis, Kombo√Ø explores \\"non-octave scales\\", its rhythm examines \\"anthypheresis\\" (displacement of stress), and its timbres exploit \\"the antitheses or homeophanies of the amplified harpsichord and percussion.\\" In this sense, Kombo√Ø means knots, as \\"knots of rhythms, timbres, structures, and personality,\\" interweaving each one with others. To make instruments blend more effectively, Xenakis used amplification in all of his works for harpsichord. The composition can be divided in five sections, which also contains interludes and variations. The opening section features an ostinato played by the bongos, while the harpsichord plays mainly rising tone clusters. In this case, the bongos stress beats and offbeats unevenly to produce the sensation of \\"anthypheresis\\". Here, Xenakis explores the relationship of the sonority between a somewhat ordered percussion with the clusters played by the harpsichord. The second section, marked Crystalline, mixes the harpsichord and the vibraphone, and the relationship between these two instruments seems to fuse more effectively. After that, the vibraphone changes to the wood blocks and, later on, the harpsichord starts a lengthy solo. Then, the percussion joins with the sound of the flower pots, which blends with the \\"needle-like\\" sound of the harpsichord, which uses an ostinato of seven chords.

Video games can be used as tools to challenge players, when they are successful. They motivate players to persevere and simultaneously teach players how to play the game. These games give a glimpse into how one might create new and more powerful ways to learn in schools, communities, and workplaces. Gee began his work in video games by identifying thirty-six learning principles that are present in‚Äîbut not exclusive to‚Äîthe design of good video games. He further argues for the application of these principles into the classroom environment. What Video Games Teach Us about Learning and Literacy is a call to educators, teachers, parents and administrators to change the approach to pedagogy. Summary Gee began playing video games when his (then) six-year-old son needed help playing the problem-solving game Pajama Sam. When he discovered how much enjoyment his son had and how much attention and time he spent solving the game's problems, Gee decided to start playing video games on his own and began to analyze what makes people spend time and money on video games. To his amazement, good video games were \\"hard, long, and complex\\", and he often had to use outside resources to learn things needed to complete the game. However, when a game is too easy and/or too short, players do not feel compelled by it and they simply will not continue playing it. The new challenges, learning potential, and consistent struggles of these games also make video games motivating and entertaining for the user. Gee takes a personal approach to explaining how the immersive, interactive world of a video game engages the player in ways that formal education may fall short. He argues that players do not usually read the manual before playing a game‚Äîthey play the game and then look at the manual. He suggests that, in essence, this is what is required of students when they are asked to read a textbook before the information is put in context‚Äîbefore they get to play 'the game.' Gee takes an optimistic view of video games, gathering a list of learning principles commonly found in these games. He challenges the assumption that video games are a waste of time and points to ways in which, when played in an environment that fosters critical thinking, video games can become excellent teaching tools. He also points out that games are not easy and that it is precisely their challenging nature that keeps the player involved. Gee suggests that if students in formal educational environments had the ability to build their own knowledge, as players in a game do when they beat a level, more progressive learning would follow rather than the frustration that is often felt by students in academic settings. Some of the learning principles that good games incorporate include: identity development, interactive approaches, student production, risk-taking, individual customization, personal agency, well-ordered problems, challenges and consolidation, \\"just-in-time\\" and \\"on demand\\", situated meanings, systems thinking, active exploration, thinking laterally, rethinking goals, using smart tools and distributed knowledge, engaging in cross-functional teams, and encouraging performance before competence.Gee, James Paul. \\"Good video games and good learning.\\" Phi Kappa Phi Forum, vol. 85, no. 2, (2005): 34-37 Learning principles =Learning and semiotic domains= * Active, Critical Learning Principle: Every aspect of the learning environment should be set up to encourage active and critical learning, instead of more traditionally passive learning environments. Active learning requires the learner to understand and use design grammars of the semiotic domain in which he/she is learning. Critical learning has occurred when the learner can engage with, reflect upon, critique, and change elements of the design. * Design Principle: Learning about design principles and appreciating the design. * Semiotic Principle: Identifying, understanding, and appreciating the relationships across symbol systems. Symbols may include words, images, actions, artifacts, etc. * Semiotic Domains Principle: Mastery in a semiotic domain so that one can participate in the appropriate community of practice. A semiotic domain uses a given modality (images, equations, symbols, etc.) to communicate messages to others. Examples of semiotic domains include cognitive psychology, first-person shooter games, and cellular biology. * Meta-Level Thinking about Semiotic Domains Principle: Learners can critically think about the relationships between multiple semiotic domains. For example, how do the concepts found in Cognitive Psychology relate to First Person Shooter Games? =Learning and identity= * \\"Psychosocial Moratorium\\" Principle: The real- world consequences do not exist, allowing learners to take greater risks. For example, in gaming worlds learners are able to \\"try-out\\" different identities relating to gender, ethnicity, and even species. Similarly, gaming environments allows learners to make multiple attempts towards a given reward (i.e. new level, boss) without any real-world consequences. This creates a safe space for the learner to fully engage with the environment. * Committed Learning Principle: Learners will participate in extended engagements as an extension of their real-world identities in relation to their virtual identities. The learner feels a commitment to continue their effort and practice. * Identity Principle: The learner is able to choose multiple identities in such a way that they can reflect upon \\"new\\" and \\"old\\" identities. Gee specifically identifies that learners have a real-world identity, a virtual identity, and a projective identity. * Self-Knowledge Principle: The learner learns about themselves and their potential range of skills, in a self-reflective process. * Amplification of Input Principle: The learner is able to put in a small input, but receives a much larger output. This principle examines how much effort is need by the learner to receive some reward. * Achievement Principle: The learner needs intrinsic rewards that are tailored to that learner's level, effort, and mastery of the content. =Situated meaning and learning= * Practice Principle: Learners need a great deal of practice in a context where they are engaged with the material, not bored with it. * Ongoing Learning Principle: The learner will go through cycles of learning new material, automatizating the material, undoing some automatization, and reorganizing the automatization. * \\"Regime of Competence\\" Principle: The learner can function at the outer edge of his/her understanding to make concepts feel challenging, but not impossible. * Probing Principle: We learn by engaging with the world, reflecting on our actions, forming hypotheses, re-probing the world, and then accepting or rethinking these hypotheses. * Multiple Routes Principle: Learners are given a range of paths to pursue forward, in which the learner can choose based on his/her strengths, weaknesses, and specific learning styles. * Situated Meaning Principle: All of the meanings of signs are situated in embodied experiences of the learner. * Text Principle: Texts are not just understood by understanding the words in the text, but by understanding the texts through experience. * Intertextual Principle: Learners understand connections between texts by understanding, through experience, the meaning of some texts and relating that meaning to other related texts. * Multimodal Principle: Meaning is learned through multiple modalities besides words (e.g., sounds, images). * \\"Material Intelligence\\" Principle: Tools, technologies, material objects, and the environment hold information that a learner can access through interaction. * Intuitive Knowledge Principle: Knowledge that cannot necessarily be verbalized, such as the knowledge gained through practicing a task, is valuable. =Transfer of knowledge= * Subset Principle: Learning first occurs in a simplified subset of the real domain. * Incremental Principle: Learners create connections in earlier, easier stages that aid them in later, more difficult stages. * Concentrated Sample Principle: The learner gains experience with fundamental concepts/actions early on so that s/he can learn them well. * Bottom-Up Basic Skills Principle: Basic skills are learned in context. * Explicit Information On-Demand and Just-In-Time Principle: Information is provided at crucial times to maximize proper responses. * Discovery Principle: The learner is told very little explicitly, and is instead allowed to explore and discover on his/her own. * Transfer Principle: Learners are given the opportunity to apply learning from earlier stages to later stages. =Cultural models= * Cultural Models About the World Principle: Learners can reflect on their cultural models in a manner \\"outside\\" their real world identities. * Cultural Models About Learning Principle: Learners can reflect on their cultural models regarding learning and themselves as learners in a manner \\"outside\\" their real world identities. * Cultural Models About Semiotic Domains Principle: Learners can reflect on their cultural models regarding particular domains they are learning about in a manner \\"outside\\" their real world identities. =Learning as a social activity= * Distributed Principle: Texts, tools, people, and technology are networked so that information is distributed among them. * Dispersed Principle: The learner shares knowledge with others who s/he may never meet face to face. * Affinity Group Principle: Learners form groups with shared identities, goals, and practices rather than by race, gender, or nationality. * Insider Principle: The learner contributes to the game and is not just a passive consumer. Critical reception Gee's book was generally well received by critics as an ambitious project that was \\"thoughtful, unique, and impassioned.\\" However, Gee does not escape criticism. Primarily, he was criticized for his failure to recognize other scholars working in similar fields of gaming theory, specifically Janet Murray's theories about agency and identity in games and Thomas Malone's scholarship on motivation. Gee has also been criticized for relying too much on his personal experiences as empirical evidence and for romanticizing the games he discusses. Application of theory Gee's book is used in Kimon Keramidas' argument explaining the learning processes of gamers. Some of the schema and elements that are used in game designing can be analogously used as \\"frameworks for reconsidering the structures of classroom experiences, syllabi, and program development. \\"What we are learning from games (both creating and playing) can be used by teachers to enhance their teaching and better prepare students for technology-based society\\". Keramidas considers six game features (Jesper Juul's definition): rules, variable-quantifiable outcome, values assigned to possible outcomes, player effort, player attached to outcome, and negotiable consequences to compare games with learning systems. Rules (a key component of any games) are very important in creating a good learning environment. The outcomes that a player achieves while playing a game are what makes playing games compelling and interesting; outcomes in education (both grades, and amount of knowledge that student will gain as a result of learning) are effective, only if the syllabi and curricula are compelling to learners and the assignments that are used to measure students' learning motivate students. Students will learn when they put effort and time into their studies, and they will be engaged in their learning if they believe that the possible outcome is worth their work and effort. What student experience and learn in school cannot (and should not) be separated from real life, and students should be encouraged to understand that gaining knowledge is comparable with gaining rewards in games (negotiable consequences‚Äîplayer is not mandated by the game rules in the real world but the consequences of gaming \\"may spill over\\" into the player's life). Katie Salen promotes games as a learning tool for the 21st century. She helped design and launch Quest to LearnQuest to Learn where learning takes place by playing and exploring games. The curriculum is organized around the idea that \\"digital games are central to the lives of today's children and also increasingly, as their speed and capabilities grow, powerful tools for intellectual exploration.\\" Editions * Gee, James Paul. 2003.

Born in Backworth, Tyne and Wear, he played for the majority of his career at Sheffield United, making nearly 400 appearances for the Blades. Playing career Sampy played his early football in his native Tyne and Wear in the north-east of England, turning out for Choppington, South Shields and Chopwell Colliery before being spotted by Sheffield United. Turning professional and signing for the Blades in November 1920, Sampy was initially employed as an inside right, scoring on his debut against Blackburn Rovers in February 1921. After playing regularly in that role for a number of seasons, Sampy was switched to right half in the autumn of 1925, where he played for the rest of his Blades career. Sampy was made club captain during the 1930‚Äì31 season but lost his place and the captaincy to Harry Gooney a year later. Regaining his place in the first team during the 1932‚Äì33 season, Sampy remained a regular with United until 1934. After 14 seasons and 383 appearances for Sheffield United, Sampy was transferred to nearby rivals Barnsley in the summer of 1934, taking the role of player-coach. His role was primarily focused on the coaching side however, and Sampy made only one league appearance for the Tykes. In May 1936 Sampy accepted a coaching role at Sheffield Wednesday where he remained until the onset of World War II in 1938. Personal life Born in Backworth, Tyne and Wear, Thomas Sampy was the elder brother of Bill who also represented Sheffield United. Sampy was an engineer by trade and returned to his profession during World War II, working as a production manager. While playing Sampy had also owned a gentlemen's outfitters on Abbeydale Road in Sheffield.

It was limited to a single copy sold in 2015, and is the most expensive work of music ever sold. The album was recorded in secret over six years. A single two-CD copy was pressed in 2014 and stored in a secured vault at the Royal Mansour Hotel in Marrakech, Morocco, then auctioned through auction house Paddle8 in 2015. A legal agreement with the purchaser stipulated that the album cannot be commercially exploited until 2103, although it can be played during listening parties.http://scluzay.com/eighteight The winning bidder was American CEO Martin Shkreli. In March 2018, following Shkreli's conviction for securities fraud, a federal court seized assets belonging to him, including Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.  Recording  Wu-Tang Clan began working on Once Upon a Time in Shaolin in the late 2000s with producer Cilvaringz. It took about six years to complete, and was recorded mostly in Staten Island, New York and produced in Marrakech, Morocco. It features the entire Wu-Tang Clan, plus rapper Redman, the Wu-Tang Killa Beez, FC Barcelona soccer players, Game Of Thrones actress Carice Van Houten http://scluzay.com/work and two appearances from Cher.  Single-album concept  The ornate casing for the album Inspired by musical patronage in the Renaissance http://scluzay.com/eighteight, Cilvaringz decided to create Once Upon A Time In Shaolin as an art object. Feeling the value of music had been cheapened by streaming and online piracy, he and co-producer RZA hoped to return music to the value of fine art. They wrote on their website: The album was held in a silver jewel-encrusted box with a wax Wu-Tang Clan seal and leather-bound liner notes. On March 3, 2015, it was detained at JFK Airport for three hours while border control determined the contents of its box. In March 2015, Wu-Tang Clan exhibited the album for the only time, to a crowd of about 150 art collectors, dealers, and critics in Queens, New York. Attendees were searched for recording devices. About 13 minutes of the album were played to the audience. = Auction = Once Upon A Time In Shaolin was auctioned through Paddle8 in 2015, which had previously sold works by artists including Jeff Koons, Julian Schnabel, Damien Hirst. Legal agreements stipulated that the album could not be commercially exploited for 88 years, although it could be released free or played at listening parties. According to RZA, the number eight was symbolic as there were eight original members of the Wu-Tang Clan, the numbers of the year 2015 add up to eight, Paddle8 has eight in its name, and a rotated eight is the symbol for infinity, used on their second album, Wu-Tang Forever.Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli, who won the only copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin at auctionThe winning bid was accepted on May 3, 2015, followed by months of legal diligence. The sale was completed on August 26, 2015 to a private individual for an unspecified amount. On December 9, Bloomberg Businessweek identified the buyer as Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli, who had paid $2 million. RZA said that the sale was agreed before Shkreli's controversial price hike of the anti-infective agent Daraprim. According to RZA, after learning the buyer's identity, Cilvaringz and the Wu-Tang Clan donated a \\"significant portion\\" of the proceeds to charity, including the Children's Literacy Society, the Hip Hop Chess Federation and TTAC, an institution focused on showcasing alternative cures for cancer. In January 2016, Shkreli told Vice that he had considered destroying the record or \\"installing it in some remote place so that people have to make a spiritual quest to listen\\". He promised to release the album free if Donald Trump won the 2016 US presidential election. In November, after Trump was elected, Shkreli streamed excerpts of the album online. In September 2017, Shkreli attempted to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin on the online auction site eBay, with the winning bid passing $1m. He was incarcerated on unrelated fraud counts before the sale could be completed. RZA disapproved of the sale, and said: \\"I think he could have got more than what he paid. I was actually impressed that within eight days he got up to $1m in bidding ... If it had been left a bit longer, no telling how far it would have gone.\\" RZA hoped to buy it himself, but was contractually unable to. In March 2018, following Shkreli's conviction for securities fraud, a federal court seized assets belonging to him worth $7.36m, including Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. Shkreli's lawyer Benjamin Brafman said the album was now \\"probably worthless\\".  Music  Complex, reporting from the exhibition in Queens, described Once Upon a Time in Shaolin as \\"rich, layered, and sonically bombastic\\", with a \\"rugged, hard-hitting sound\\" reminiscent of early Wu-Tang Clan albums. It begins with \\"ominous, foreboding\\" sounds of rain and thunder, before rapper Raekwon begins the first verse. Other sounds include fire sirens, crowd applause, and a marching drum beat. Cher appears twice, as singer and actress, and closes the record with the \\"belted\\" words: \\"Wu-Tang baby, they rock the world\\". Rolling Stone wrote \\"simply put, if the full, 128-minute Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is as solid as the 13 minutes heard Monday night, it could be the group‚Äôs most popular album since 1997. Playing like Wu-Tang‚Äôs version of U2‚Äôs All That You Can‚Äôt Leave Behind or Metallica‚Äôs Death Magnetic, the music hearkened back to the RZA‚Äôs glory days between the 1993 debut Enter the Wu- Tang (36 Chambers) and 1997‚Äôs double-disc follow-up Wu-Tang Forever\\". Shkreli played the record during his interview with Vice writer Allie Conti, who said: \\"From what I heard, it was definitely better than their last album, although I wouldn't say it's worth $2 million necessarily.\\" Response Many fans reacted negatively to the news of the single-copy album. Wu-Tang member Method Man spoke out against the 88-year commercial ban, blaming RZA and producer Cilvaringz. RZA replied that the ban was necessary to maintain the integrity of the album as a work of art and to deflect notions of a publicity stunt. The Guinness Book of Records certified Once Upon a Time in Shaolin as the most valuable album in the world, surpassing records by Elvis Presley and The Beatles, then known as the Quarrymen. In February 2016, artist Jason Koza sued RZA, Cilvaringz, Paddle8 and Shkreli in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for the alleged unauthorized use of his artwork on the album. The case was later dismissed after Jason Koza was found to have sold prints using the Wu-Tang logo without consent. Book In July 2017, publishing house Macmillan released a memoir of the story behind the album written by Cyrus Bozorgmehr, a senior advisor to Cilvaringz and RZA on the album. Film In May 2016, Netflix and Brad Pitt's film company Plan B Entertainment purchased Cilvaringz's life story rights and the book rights to Once Upon A Time In Shaolin The Untold Story of the Wu-Tang Clan's Million- Dollar Secret Album, the Devaluation of Music, and America's New Public Enemy No. 1 for a motion picture. The production of the film was accidently leaked by the film's first screenwriter, How To Make It In America's Ian Edelman.

Built in 1819 and enlarged about 1900, it is a good example of Federal period architecture, and is notable for its association with Horatio Colony, a prominent local businessman and the city's first mayor. The house, now operated as a bed and breakfast inn, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Colony House is located a few blocks west of Keene's central green, at the southeast corner of West Street and School Street. It is a brick two story structure with a hip roof. The exterior has modest Federal styling, predominantly in its main entry, with half-length sidelight windows topped by a half-oval fanlight and sheltered by a modest portico. The interior of the building has well-preserved woodwork that took its inspiration from the publications of Asher Benjamin. A c. 1900 addition to the rear emulates the style and building materials of the original block. The oldest portion of the house, its front block, was built in 1819 by Timothy Hall, a local merchant. The house was purchased in 1863 by Horatio Colony, in whose family it remained for a century. Colony was a lawyer who became involved in the local textile industry, eventually becoming president of the Cheshire Mills in Harrisville. When Keene received its city charter in 1874, he was elected its mayor, serving two terms. The Colony family owned the property until 1966. Between 1974 and 1991 it housed the Historical Society for Cheshire County headquarters and museum. Threatened with demolition, it was repurchased by a Colony descendant in 2001, and is now operated as a bed and breakfast.

There is a theorem named after her, called Marion Walter's theorem. Education and early life Born in Germany in 1928, she left on a Kindertransport to England where she attended a boarding school. After she left school in December 1944 the school's only mathematics teacher resigned and since it was difficult to find a replacement during the war period, she was asked to teach maths, in part because she had earned a mark of distinction on her Cambridge University School Certificate exam. She taught for two terms and found she enjoyed teaching. She attended college in England for two years before leaving for the United States in 1948. She then attended Hunter College, majoring in mathematics and minoring in education, graduating in 1950. After graduating, she taught at Hunter College High School and George Washington High School. She began taking evening classes for a master's degree in mathematics at New York University. She worked as a research assistant, mainly doing computing work at what became the Courant Institute. In the summers of 1952 and 1953 she was awarded a National Bureau of Standards summer scholarship to study at the Institute of Numerical Analysis at UCLA. She earned her master's degree in mathematics from New York University in 1954. Career She accepted a teaching assistantship at Cornell University. In 1956, she took a one-year appointment at Simmons College in Boston. At the time, the college did not offer a major in mathematics but at the end of the year she was asked to create this major. Disliking the administrative aspects, she stepped down as department chair after four years, remaining there teaching until 1965 when she left to concentrate on her doctorate at Harvard Graduate School of Education, earning an Ed.D. in 1967. In 1960, she earned a fellowship to attend the National Science Foundation Summer Program at Stanford. At Harvard, she formed a group called the Boston Area Math Specialists which gives monthly workshops for practicing teachers. She was a mathematics consultant to the project that became Sesame Street.Charlene Morrow and Teri Peri (eds), Notable Women in Mathematics, Greenwood Press, 1998, p 270 She worked briefly in Israel as a UNESCO consultant for mathematics teaching.

In the 1970s she made critical, humorous counter images to the male artists' romanticized depictions of the housewife in the home, such as \\"The Housewife Pictures.\\" The images were distributed as posters and in women's magazines and art literature in the 1970s.Petersen, Anne Ring. 2013 ' Meltingtime - and other lines of Kirsten Justesen's art / Meltingtime - and other lines in Kirsten Justesen's art '.

The five-story brick building was built in 1870 to a design by Worcester, Massachusetts, architects E. Boyden & Son, and is the city's most prominent example of Second Empire architecture. In addition to being a long-standing commercial center, the building housed the city library from 1870 to 1877. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Colony's Block is located in the heart of Keene, on the east side of its Central Square. It is a broad brick structure, nine bays wide, with four full stories, and a fifth under its mansard roof. The ground floor consists of three modernized storefronts, each with a recessed entrance and large display windows. The main entrance is located in a recess to the right of the center storefront. The upper levels bays are divided into 3-4-3 groupings, highlighted by the Chateau-style caps of the outer groups. The window arrangements and treatments are slightly asymmetrical, with second-floor windows in the left group set in rounded-arch openings, and Palladian-style arrangements of windows on the second and third levels of the right group. Dormer treatments in the mansard roof are also nearly symmetrical, differing in the shaping of decorative elements. The building was constructed in 1870, in the aftermath of a fire which destroyed the commercial buildings on this side of the square in 1865. It was built by Timothy Colony, treasurer of the Cheshire Mills of Harrisville and a prominent local businessman. Early tenants included the public library on the second floor, and a drugstore on the first that remained in operation into the 1980s. The building was designed by Elbridge Boyden of Worcester, Massachusetts, who had executed other commissions in Keene prior to this work. The building was built together with the Bank Block, located to its right. Also designed by Boyden, it and the Colony were meant to be seen as a single structure. The Bank Block was altered in the twentieth century, attaining a more Colonial Revival appearance.\\"Elbridge Boyden\\".

From 1995, with the advent of the George W. Bush gubernatorial administration, until 2019, Elkins represented District 135 in Harris County. Elkins won his eleventh term in the state House in the general election held on November 4, 2014, when he defeated Democrat Moiz A. Abbas of Houston. He won his twelfth term on November 8, 2016, with 26,685 votes (47.7 percent). He was unseated in his bid for a thirteenth term by Democrat Jon Rosenthal, who polled 28,430 votes (50.8 percent). Another 866 votes (1.5 percent) went to the Libertarian Party candidate, Paul Bilyeu. Background Elkins graduated in 1974 from Bellaire High School in the Bellaire section of Houston. He subsequently earned a Bachelor of Science in Practical Theology from the private Southwestern Assemblies of God University in Waxachachie in Ellis County in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. He has worked in real estate and since 1985 has owned Personal Credit Corporation, which operates a dozen payday-lending locations in Houston. He is a long-term legislative opponent of attempts to regulate his own industry. Elkins and his wife, the former Julie Ann Brown, have four children, Crystal Boyd, Jeremy Ross Elkins, and Grace and Rachael Elkins, and as of 2014, four grandchildren. The couple resides in the Jersey Village section of Houston. He is a member of the Faith Assembly of God Church in Houston. Political life In 1994, the Republican representative from District 135, Dalton Smith, did not seek a fifth term in the office. Elkins and four others entered the primary election to choose a successor nominee. Elkins finished a strong second, with 3,348 votes (44 percent) to Patricia A. \\"Pat\\" Curran (born c. 1947), who polled 3,607 votes (47.4 percent). Three other candidates held the remaining 8.6 percent of the ballots cast. In the runoff election, Elkins defeated Curran, 3,065 (51 percent) to 2,942 votes (49 percent). The second round of balloting drew 1,607 fewer voters than had the primary itself. No Democrat challenged Elkins in the general election of 1994. He instead overwhelmed a Libertarian Party nominee, Graham Bass, 25,985 (92.1 percent) to 2,236 (7.9 percent). Elkins has rarely had opposition since his initial election to the House. In 2002, for instance, he defeated a Democrat, Eric Henry Krebs (born c. 1947), 17,186 (70.2 percent) to 7,280 (29.8 percent). Elkins was the chairman of the House Technology Committee and is a member as well of the Urban Affairs Committee. With his long tenure in office, Elkins has previously served on such House committees as Ways and Means, Financial Institutions, State Affairs, Calendars, and Local Government. =Legislative voting records= In 2013, Representative Elkins supported the ban on abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. He voted for companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a move which opponents said could lead to the closure of many abortion clinics in the state. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth, who in 2014 is the Democratic nominee for governor against the Republican Greg Abbott. In 2011, MurphyAppears to be an error...perhaps a cut- and-paste from Texas State Representative Jim Murphy, District 133? voted to forbid state funding of agencies which perform abortions. He did not vote on the legislation which requires that a woman undergo a sonogram before procuring an abortion. This act is based on the view that a woman could change her mind about an abortion once she witnesses the development of the unborn child through the latest technology. The Texas Right to Life Committee, according to Project Vote Smart, rated Elkins 78 percent favorable in 2013, 60 percent in 2011, and 100 percent in 2005. The National Abortion Rights Action League consistently has rated him 0 percent. Elkins opposed the implementation of the taxpayer-funded school breakfast program, which nevertheless passed the House, 73-58. He supported legislation to provide marshals for school security as a separate law-enforcement entity. He co-sponsored the successful bill to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain businesses. Elkins voted for the adoption of the biennial state budgets in 2011 and 2013. He voted to require testing for narcotics of those individuals receiving unemployment compensation. Elkins voted for the bill to prohibit the state government from engaging in the enforcement of federal regulations of firearms. He co- sponsored the bill to allow college and university officials to carry concealed weapons in buildings and vehicles in the name of campus security. He supported the bill to reduce the time required to obtain a concealed-carry permit. He backed the redistricting bills for the state House and Senate and the United States House of Representatives. He voted against term limits for certain state officials. He voted against the bill to ban texting while driving. Elkins voted against an \\"equal pay for women\\" bill, which passed the legislature but was vetoed by Governor Perry. In 2011, Elkins supported a resolution to reduce funding for state agencies, which passed the House, 84-63. He voted to extend the sales tax to Internet transactions to match existing laws for brick and mortar stores; the measure passed the House, 125-20. Elkins voted against the prohibition of smoking in public places, which nevertheless passed the House, 73-66. He did not vote on the establishment of eligibility for indigent health care. He voted to establish corporal punishment in public schools; the bill passed the House, 80-64. Elkins voted to require that student centers at state colleges and universities in their construction and operation be cognizant of traditional family values; the measure passed the House, 110-24. To guarantee the integrity of the election process, Elkins supported picture identification of voters. The law finally took effect in October 2013 and was used widely without incident in the primaries on March 4, 2014. In 2013, Murphy supported related legislation to forbid a voter from turning in multiple ballots. =Interest group ratings= Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, managed in Texas by Cathie Adams, a former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party, rated Elkins 83 percent favorable in 2013, 36 percent in 2011, and 84 percent in 2009. The Young Conservatives of Texas in 2013 netted him a lifetime score of 81 percent. The interest group Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, founded by Michael Quinn Sullivan, rated Elkins percent 73 favorable in 2013, 88 percent in 2011, and 85 percent in 2009. TFA called Elkins a \\"Texas Taxpayer Hero\\" and a \\"Texas Taxpayer Advocate\\". The Texas Association of Business gave him a cumulative score of 88 percent and declared him a \\"Fighter for Free Enterprise\\". The Texas League of Conservation Voters rated Elkins 64 percent in 2013; the Sierra Club, 29 percent in 2011. The National Rifle Association scored him 92 percent and \\"A\\" in all of his previous legislative sessions. In 2009, the Libertarian Party of Texas rated Elkins 67 percent on both personal liberties and economic issues. Election to twelfth term, 2016 Elkins won his twelfth term in the state House in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 32,682 votes (54.9 percent), he defeated Democrat Jesse A. Ybanez, who drew 26,905 (45.2 percent). In 2017, Representative Elkins introduced HB 3418, which would make it more difficult for local governments to designate historic landmarks. According to the historic preservation group, Preservation Texas, Inc., the legislation would make it easier for the owners of previously-designated landmarks to uproot those facilities. It would limit public input in the zoning process and impede local governments in the passage of zoning regulations. Texas municipalities have long depended on zoning ordinances as well as historic resource surveys, and tax incentives to assist in the preservation of historic landmarks. The bill is pending before the House Urban Affairs Committee.\\"HB 3418\\", Preservation, Texas, Inc., March 28, 2017. In popular culture One of Elkins's attempts to defeat payday loan industry regulation, in which fellow Representative Vicki Truitt pointed out his conflict of interest in being opposed to it while owning several payday loans himself, was featured in an episode 14, season 1, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver segment on payday loans.

Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300‚Äì1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 418) was an Egyptian pharaoh of the Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c. 1700 BC. As a king of the 14th Dynasty, Sewadjkare III would have reigned from Avaris over the eastern Nile Delta and possibly over the western Delta as well.  Evidence No contemporary attestation of Sewadjkare III survives to this day and this pharaoh is only known to us thanks to the Turin canon. This king list was redacted during the early Ramesside period from older documents and serves as the primary source for kings of the second intermediate period. Sewadjkare III's prenomen appears on the 9th column, 6th line of the papyrus. Chronological position Sewadjkare III's relative position in the 14th Dynasty is somewhat secured by the Turin canon. According to this king list, Sewadjkare reigned for about one year and was preceded by Merdjefare and succeeded by Nebdjefare. At the opposite, Sewadjkare III's absolute chronological position is debated. According to Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker, Sewadjkare III was the eleventh king of the 14th Dynasty, reigning c. 1699 BC for around one year. Ryholt's reconstruction of the early 14th dynasty is controversial however and other specialists, such as Manfred Bietak and J√ºrgen von Beckerath, believe that the dynasty started shortly before Nehesy c. 1710 BC rather than c. 1805 BC as proposed by Ryholt. In this case, Sewadjkare III would only be the sixth king of the dynasty.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Untersuchungen zur politischen Geschichte der Zweiten Zwischenzeit in √Ñgypten, Gl√ºckstadt, 1964J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Chronologie des pharaonischen √Ñgyptens, M√ºnchner √Ñgyptologische Studien 46, Mainz am Rhein, 1997 Identity Sewadjkare III should not be confused with two other pharaohs bearing the same prenomen and who also reigned during the Second Intermediate Period. The earliest of the two is Sewadjkare I of the early 13th Dynasty, c. 1781 BC. Just like Sewadjkare III, Sewadjkare I is known only thanks to the Turin canon. The other pharaoh bearing the same prenomen is Sewadjkare Hori II (also known as Hori II) who reigned at the very end of the 13th Dynasty, from c. 1669 until 1664 BC.

She represented Portugal at the Venice Biennale in 1982 and 2005 and had a solo exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2017. Early life Almeida was born in Lisbon in 1934. She was the daughter of the sculptor Leopoldo de Almeida (1898‚Äì1975). In 1955, Almeida completed the painting course at the School of Fine Arts in Lisbon. She married architect Artur Rosa. Their daughter Joana Rosa became an artist. After spending some years raising her family, in 1964 she obtained a scholarship and moved to Paris.  Works  Almeida exhibited for the first time in 1967. At this exhibit she pioneered the use of three-dimensional elements in her work, a theme she would come back to often in her later pieces. She wanted her work to escape the canvas and intrigue the viewer. Starting in 1969, Almeida defined a new aspect of her work, the desire for self-representation, in an exhibit which became the basis of her future work. She exhibited a black and white photograph of herself wearing a canvas, arms spread and looking down ‚Äì as in Christ carrying the cross. This photograph asserted her belief in \\"identifying herself with the being of her work.\\" This became an ongoing theme in her work: there is no difference between the work and artist's body. In her work, a woman's image is always present, but the image is transformed in a painting or drawing. Almeida avoided creating self-portraits. Rather, \\"My work is my body, my body is my work.\\" \\"I am the canvas.\\"Xunta, Helen Almeida. p. 180 Her work has been described as \\"halfway between a performance (capturing an instant), and body art (the body itself as the absolute protagonist). In the early 70's Almeida returned to three dimensional sketching, with drawings that use horsehair threads and appear to jump off the page. She referred to this work as \\"painting outwards.\\" In 1975, Almeida brought together three disciplines, photography, painting and drawing. The drawing was represented by the horsehair threads; painting in three colors ‚Äì blue or red sometimes black; photography serves as a meta-narrative. The broad range of her work and experimentation includes \\"design to cinema, from paintings to comics, from photography to sculpture, from architecture to performance.\\"Xunta, Helen Almeida. p. 182 Almeida's work is shown in the Tate Modern in London, the Museum of Art in New York, the Museu d'art Contemporary de Barcelona, and also in her home town in Lisbon.

History In the late 1880s through the first quarter of the 20th century, the United States government was eager to attract Swedish immigrants to settle the lands of the upper mid-west. Swede‚Äôs were known for their strong work ethic and their forestry and lumber skills, and made ideal recruits for developing the state of Minnesota. Swede‚Äôs also had a very high literacy rate, and soon there was a thriving Swedish cultural community in Minnesota with Swedish language newspapers, magazines, entertainers, business leaders, professionals, and government officials. In particular, the American Swedish Institute was founded by Swan Turnblad, a publisher of Swedish language newspapers. Many fraternal organizations were developed during this period including VASA, Gustav Adolf Society, Svithoid, as well as Svenska S√§llskapet.

Ketevan was the eldest daughter of Teimuraz, of the royal house of Kakheti, by his second wife, Princess Tamar of Kartli. Teimuraz, then at war to secure his throne, was summoned by his suzerain Nader Shah, the Afsharid ruler of Iran, in 1737. In a show of loyalty, Teimuraz had to agree on Nader's terms, which included the marriage of Teimuraz's daughter Ketevan to Nader's nephew Ali- qoli Khan and summoning his son Heraclius to join Nader's campaign to India, the deal which Teimuraz would lament in his autobiographical poem. The marriage was celebrated at Mashhad, attended by Teimuraz and his entourage of 2,500. Ketevan's subsequent fate is unknown. Her husband, Ali-qoli Khan, maintained friendly relations with Teimuraz and the Georgians.

History  Planning for the monument dedicated to Reich chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, began in 1896 by the Drachenfels ClubDrachenfels-Club: Chronik and it was erected in 1901 - 1903 under the direction of architect, Friedrich Kunst, from Karlsruhe. In 1925 a concrete ceiling collapsed during a school visit to the tower. In 1928 the relief, which had been destroyed by the French, was replaced. During the Second World War two bombs hit the tower. Its first restoration was carried out in 1949 by the Drachenfels Club, a local monument conservation society. In 1973/74 further renovation measures were implemented; this included accommodation for the tower keeper. The tower has been protected as a listed monument since 1986.  Design  The tower is made from bunter sandstone which was quarried in the vicinity. It has a base area of 16.7 x 14 m¬≤ and is divided into three sections. The lower section may be climbed on 15 external steps, from which staircases lead left and right to the lower viewing platform. The second viewing platform follows after a further 20 steps, also external to the tower. An internal staircase then leads to the 30-metre-high third viewing platform.

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a coastal convoy escort. She was named for Coaticook, Quebec. Coaticook was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River class building programme. She was laid down on 14 June 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec and launched 26 November 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 25 July 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin- screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti- submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service Coaticook was sent in mid- September 1944 to Bermuda for workups after commissioning. Upon her return she was assigned to escort support group EG 27 based out of Halifax. During this period, German U-boats, the main foe of the River-class frigates, had adapted to the increased anti-submarine patrols with the introduction of the schnorkel, which allowed the U-boats to remain underwater while they recharged their batteries. This led to the German \\"inshore offensive\\" which targeted convoys along the Canadian and American coastlines that led to more forces being deployed in this area. Coaticook remained in this duty until June 1945 when she sailed for Esquimalt. She was paid off into the reserve there on 29 November 1945. Postwar service In 1948, Coaticook was sold for stripping and in 1949, she was sunk as a breakwater at Powell River in British Columbia to replace the floating breakwater that had been installed. In 1961, the hull was refloated in an effort to tow it to Victoria, British Columbia to be broken up. However en route, a storm arose and the hull suffered damage. The damage was considered significant enough to render the hull structurally unstable. The decision was made to scuttle it instead of continuing on to Victoria. Four cases of forcite, a gelatin dynamite, were placed throughout the ship. The ship was sunk near Race Rocks, off Vancouver Island in February 1962. Photos of the resulting explosion were taken and distributed through The Canadian Press. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

The house was originally located on Main Street, but was moved to its present rural setting in 1973. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Noah Cooke House stands in a remote and wooded area of western Keene, on the north side of Daniels Hill Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around a center entrance. The entrance is framed by simple moulding and topped by a transom window and cornice. The interior retains many period finishes, including paneled fireplace surrounds, plaster wainscoting, and a winding front staircase. The house was built in 1791, although it is connected to an ell of older construction, appearing to date to c. 1770. Originally located on Main Street, it was built for Noah Cooke, a prominent local lawyer who served as town clerk and underwrote the town's first fire company. It was purchased in 1906 by Horatio Colony, a prominent local businessman, and remained in his family until 1966. Threatened with demolition, it was moved to its present site in October 1973.

The charity provides affordable housing for people in housing need. It also administers two relief-in-need welfare charities, a relief-in-sickness charity and a very small charity that awards small quarterly grants to four deserving spinsters. The charity is an amalgamation of five Richmond almshouse charities and a Twickenham almshouse charity that was itself formed from 27 united charities. Richmond Charities manages 124 almshouses, mainly of one-bedroom cottages and bungalows, in Richmond and Twickenham: 50 at Hickey's Almshouses; 9 at Houblon's; 10 at Bishop Duppa's (founded by Brian Duppa, Bishop of Chichester); 4 at Queen Elizabeth's; 18 at Michel's; 5 at Benn's Walk, 18 at Church Estate and 10 at Candler (Twickenham). In addition at Hickey's, there is a chapel dedicated to St Francis of Assisi, the chaplain's house and two lodges for staff. The almshouses are for local people aged over 65, who are of limited means and require an improvement in their living conditions. The charity's area of benefit is London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, in which the majority of the almshouse residents will have been living at the time of their appointment, but limited provision is made for the appointment of residents irrespective of their former place of residence. Preference is given to applicants living in private rented property. As recently as 1943, the residents of Richmond Charities' Almshouses received a monthly allowance of ¬£2 5s. (¬£2.25p), together with three tons of coal a year, a dress or suit of clothes every other year, or a great coat every fifth year. Pensions continued to be paid for some years, but the position has now entirely changed, in that, where necessary, residents receive financial support within the state welfare system. They pay for the provision of central heating, where this is provided, and in addition pay a subsidised weekly maintenance contribution (WMC) towards the maintenance of the almshouses. Residents pay their own household bills. They occupy the almshouses as beneficiaries of a charitable trust and do not have security of tenure. There are no longer any qualifications with regard to gender or religion. Richmond Charities has an endowment that has to be used for the benefit of its residents. Governance The governing body of the charity is a board of twelve trustees. Trustees are unpaid and must live or work in Richmond or have special knowledge of it. The Board comprises one ex- officio trustee who is the leader of the Richmond team ministry, two trustees nominated by Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council, one trustee nominated by the Parish of St Mary's, Twickenham and eight co-opted trustees. The board of trustees meets six times a year. Sub-committees meet to deal with finance, property, risk management, welfare, interviewing and grants. Staff Juliet Ames-Lewis is the Director. The staff employed on the almshouses estates consists of a chaplain, scheme managers, home-help, health & safety officer, caretaker and decorator. The role of the scheme manager is to look after the almshouse estate and act as a facilitator, monitoring the well-being of the residents and to call in the appropriate services when required.

It is both free as an algebra and graded- cofree as a graded coalgebra, so is in some sense as far as possible from being either commutative or cocommutative. It was introduced by and studied by . Definition The underlying free abelian group of the MPR algebra has a basis consisting of the disjoint union of the symmetric groups Sn for n = 0, 1, 2, .... , which can be thought of as permutations. The identity 1 is the empty permutation, and the counit takes the empty permutation to 1 and the others to 0. The product of two permutations (a1,...,am) and (b1,...,bn) in MPR is given by the shuffle product (a1,...,am) —à (m + b1,...,m + bn). The coproduct of a permutation a on m points is given by Œ£a=b*c st(b) ‚äó st(c), where the sum is over the m + 1 ways to write a (considered as a sequence of m integers) as a concatenation of two sequences b and c, and st(b) is the standardization of b, where the elements of the sequence b are reduced to be a set of the form {1, 2, ..., n} while preserving their order.

Along its 275 km run through the Indian States of Maharashtra & Madhya Pradesh, it receives its largest tributary - Pench River, a major water source for the metropolis of Nagpur. Kanhan was surprisingly not mentioned in the 2001 list of notified rivers in Maharashtra which has led to unrestricted exploitation in the form of sand mining along the river bed.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/Kanhan-is-not-a-river-says- state-govt/articleshow/17974795.cms This failure to recognise its presence has been viewed as a deliberate attempt at unregulated economic gains. The catchment area has also seen large scale coal mining in recent years. Efforts are currently underway to notify the river to prevent further environmental damage. This has been undermined by planshttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/Kanhan-river-barrage-plan- revived/articleshow/38226739.cms for construction of a barrage. The river was perennial until a few decades ago, but now goes dry by February every year. Sources The Kanhan rises on the slopes of the hills at the southern edge of the Satpura range to the north of Damua and west of Junnardeo, a town in Madhya Pradesh, India. The source lacks clear documentation and is not celebrated or considered holy, unlike most other rivers of a similar size. Course =Within Madhya Pradesh= The Kanhan is Wainganga's longest tributary, at 275 km. It rises in the southern spurs of the Satpura Range in the north-western region of Chhindwara District. Flowing south from its origin, Damua is the first town it encounters. Here it intersects the town and allows for its flow to be controlled by means of a dam. It then runs along a south & southeastern direction, meandering through the countryside of Chhindwara District where it has been productively harnessed for growing Tur dal and cotton. The river comes to lie about 5 km to the south of Deogarh fort where it humbly receives an insignificant tributary. Upon reaching the town of Ramakona it is crossed by a rail bridge as well as another road bridge which supports NH-26 B. Nearly at the end of its course in Madhya Pradesh at Razadi Borgaon, it is joined by Jam River, and for a short distance provides a natural boundary with adjoining state Maharashtra. =Within Maharashtra= Within Maharashtra the river is at its widest at Kamptee where it receives the Pench River- a left bank tributary and its largest one. Another tributary connecting it at its right bank is Kolar River - the spill off from Kolar Dam. The river now comes to be at the northeast of Nagpur from which it receives the metropolitan city's effluent waste by way of the Nag River. A little further from Kamptee, it flows along the town Kanhan - its etymology derived from the river. Situated alongside the town is a large coal mine, one of the many coal mines situated along its river basin. From here the river flows south-east and ends its course by joining the Wainganga at the village of Ambora in Nagpur District.

Its core members were AA students Peter Crump, Bruce Haggart and Graham Caine.Stephen E. Hunt, The Revolutionary Urbanism of Street Farm: Eco-anarchism, Architecture and Alternative Technology in the 1970s (Bristol: Tangent, 2014). Street Farm was discontinued in around 1976, although Graham Caine and Peter Crump continued to work on sustainable architecture projects in the Bristol area in later years. The group‚Äôs ideas and projects proved influential as renewable energy and concern for sustainability in architecture became more mainstream in subsequent decades, with leading green architects, including Paul F. Downton and Howard Liddell, citing early encounters with the Street Farmers as important inspirations for their careers. Street Farmer In 1971-1972 the group produced a Situationist-inspired magazine called Street Farmer, which combined witty graphics with ideas about what they termed the ‚Äòtransmogrification‚Äô of the urban environment. Attacking the complicity of architects in state and capitalist control of cities, Street Farm advocated communities self-organised on anarchist principles, making use of autonomous housing and the kind of liberatory technology favoured by social ecologist Murray Bookchin. In addition to the alternative-press publication Street Farmer, they pursued other agit-prop media projects, touring throughout England and Wales to present multimedia shows at schools of architecture and beyond, and participating in events in the Netherlands and Italy. Street Farm‚Äôs ideas were also promoted by appearances on two BBC television programmes. The first was aired as a part of the documentary series ‚ÄòOpen Door‚Äô produced by the BBC‚Äôs Community Programme Unit (broadcast 18 June 1973). Melvyn Bragg presented the second documentary, Clearings in the Concrete Jungle, as part of the 2nd House series (broadcast 24 January 1976).Lydia Kallipoliti, ‚ÄòReview: Clearings in a Concrete Jungle‚Äô, Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, 70.2 (June 2011), 240-244. The First Ecological House In 1972 Street Farm applied their political aspirations and visions to the practical project of Street Farmhouse, in Eltham, London, the first intentionally constructed ecological house. This was designed and constructed by Graham Caine with the assistance of Bruce Haggart and other friends in 1972, sited on Thames Polytechnic's playing fields.

The basic ingredients are rice, sugar, rice flour and milk. The dessert is popular in Turkey, Israel, and other Mediterranean countries. In the Middle Ages, muhallebi and its European counterpart blancmange were made with shredded chicken. The traditional recipe is still common in Turkey. History Mahalabia garnished with chopped nuts Legend has it that muhallebi was introduced into Arab cuisine in the late seventh century by a Persian cook who served it to an Arab general by the name of Al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra. He liked it so much, he named it after himself. The earliest recipes, dating to the 10th century, featured three versions: milk thickened with ground rice, milk with rice grains and chicken, and an egg custard without rice. The earliest recipe for muhallabiyya is attributed to Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq of Baghdad. Two 13th-century Arab cookbooks, one by al- Baghdadi and another from Andalusia, have a spiced pudding variation made with mutton instead of chicken. The account of the pudding's Persian origins comes from the Andalusian cookbook. There are records from the Ottoman Empire for two versions of muhallebi: a version with shredded chicken (tavuk g√∂ƒüs√º) served during the reign of Mehmed the Conqueror, and a later recipe dating to 1530 for a meatless version flavored with rose water. One 19th-century English cookbook that gives a recipe for muhallebi calls it \\"Ramazan cakes\\". The recipe calls for boiling milk together with rice flour and sugar until the mixture reduces. The pudding is flavored with rose or jasmine extract, and allowed to cool before it is sprinkled with powdered sugar. Variations Moroccan-style mahalabiya with orange flavoring In the modern era the traditional tavuk g√∂ƒüs√º is no longer widely available, except in Turkey. This pudding does not taste like chicken but the shredded meat gives it a distinctive texture. George Coleman De Kay said the pudding \\"owes its peculiar excellent flavour to the presence of the breasts of very young chickens, which are by some means so intimately blended and incorporated with the custard as to be scarcely distinguishable\\". Kazandibi is a variation of the classic tavuk g√∂ƒüs√º where a thin layer of pudding is caramelized before the custard is poured over it and allowed to set. The finished pudding is served upside down with the caramelized side on top. Mastic can be used as a flavoring for muhallebis‚Äîthis is called sakƒ±zlƒ± muhallebi. Rice flour is used to thicken the pudding, but this can be combined or replaced with corn starch or wheat starch depending on the cook's preference. In Israel, \\"malabi\\" (◊û◊ú◊ë◊ô) is a popular dessert is usually flavored with culinary rose water. It is made from milk cooked with corn starch or rice flour and rose syrup, and sometimes the milk is replaced with almond juice to make the pudding pareve. Similar to the Turkish ke≈ük√ºl, the Israeli version is topped with chopped pistachios, desiccated coconut and flavorings such as rose or orange water. Chefs Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi, in Jerusalem: A Cookbook, define malabi as the \\"dessert form of sahlab,\\" both a flour made from the tubers of the orchid genus Orchis and the name for the warm, less viscous version of the cold dessert. In Cyprus, mahalebi or mahalepi (ŒúŒ±œáŒ±ŒªŒµœÄŒØ in Greek) does not contain milk. Cypriot muhallebi is made from water, sugar, nisete flour (it can still be made from corn starch or corn flour) and rose water (optional). When the muhallebi is set the Cypriots add rose squash/cordia/syrup called triantafyllo (œÑœÅŒπŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ¨œÜœÖŒªŒªŒø in Greek) on top of it. Culinary traditions In some Sephardi homes, malabi is served to break the fast on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. It is also eaten at Turkish Jewish weddings to symbolize the sweet life that lies ahead. Sephardim serve it on the festival of Shavuot when it is customary to eat dairy food, but according to food historian Gil Marks, the real reason is that the holiday is known in this community as the \\"feast of roses, \\"and malabi is traditionally topped with rosewater.

Suggestions indicate that Hong Kong might take reference to Munich in Germany or United Kingdom, where the countries regulate street performances by licensing system. The latest plan of government has considered this suggestion, and decided to organize the street performers in the pedestrian by a license system.\\"SCMP. Street performer says Hong Kong becoming more appreciative of his craft. 2013\\" However the details still remain to be further discussed. People, including street performers and other related stakeholders hold different opinion towards this licensing regulation. Positive impact =An Open Stage= Street performance brings an open and interactive stage for diverse artists in Hong Kong. Artists who come from different growing backgrounds and born in different decades are welcomed to stand on this stage without any restriction ranging from rent to popularity. FM Theatre Power, a council-funded live art group, is a well-known figure of street performance aimed at breaking the barrier between audiences and performers using this stage.\\"CNN. War in Mongkok. 2010\\" Some performers regard street performance as a connection to the community.\\"Busking\\" Getting immediate response from audiences is what the performers expect. =A New Tourist Attraction= Street performance has the potential to be developed as a bucking tourist attraction in Hong Kong. Along with the sound of peddling, the combination of different styles‚Äô tangible and non-tangible artwork is considered as a significant characteristic of Sai Yeung Choi Street. From martial arts to instrumental performances, all types of art can be found there. Foreign tourists view the street performance as a part of the local culture in Sai Yeung Choi Street.\\"Anarchy in Hong Kong. 2013\\" Diversity of street performance in Sai Yeung Choi Street creates a unique feature, which is viewed as a selling point by some of the performers, indicating a potential benefit of attracting both local and foreign tourists.\\"CNN. Busking In Hong Kong blooms. 2011\\" Negative Impact =Noise Pollution= Some residents living nearby the street have complained that the loudspeakers from street performers produce big noises. They can hardly sleep deeply at night and kids cannot concentrate on doing their homework. As stated in the Noise Control Ordinance set by the Environmental Protection Department in 1997, noise levels in urban areas should be below 70 decibels.\\"Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department. Noise from Domestic Premises and Public Places (sections 4 and 5)\\" Yet, the bands performing on the street are obviously exceeding this limit. As recorded by reporters of South China Morning Post, sound levels were of between 94.6 to 102 decibels.\\"SCMP. Street performers accused of bringing chaos to Mong Kok pedestrian zone. 2013\\" This causes neighbors have hearing problem if they listen to loud music over a period of time. It also affects businesses running around that area. Due to high sound level, customers cannot listen to the salespersons properly and they are being driven away. =Congestion= Besides, street performances create crowd and make the road difficult to cross. Since 2000, Sai Yeung Choi Street South has adopted the pedestrian street scheme due to the heavy pedestrians and motorist traffic. However, the current situation violates the original intention of setting up the pedestrian street scheme. At present, the street is closed to vehicles from 4pm to 10pm from Monday to Saturday and from noon to 10pm on Sundays and public holidays.\\"Hong Kong Transport Department. Pedestrian Schemes for Mong Kok\\" The street consist of performers, political activists and people promoting through internet or mobile phone services once the motorists are banned. When there is street performance, pedestrians stop and gather around the performers. Other pedestrians can hardly access to different shops along the street. Also, many visitors come to Mong Kok because of the renowned street performance. Nevertheless, the congestion problem may bring some annoyance to visitors and make them leaving a negative impression. It lowers the reputation of the quality of tourism in Hong Kong. Legal Challenge In 2014, Tony Lui Yuet-Tin submitted an Application for Leave for Judicial Review of the Transport Department's decision to reopen Sai Yeung Choi Street to traffic on weekdays. \\" SCMP. Street Singer's Legal Challenge to Shortening Hours of Mong Kok Pedestrian Area\\" He is represented by Adam Clermont, an American with the firm of Payne Clermont, and Hiu H. Wong, a local barrister. On April 20, 2015, the High Court granted Mr. Lui's application and will determine whether the Transport Department's decision was proper.

Hellen formed on March 26 in the northern portion of the channel, and the storm brought rainfall to coastal Mozambique while in its formative stages. While moving southeastward, it developed an organized area of convection over the center of circulation. Warm waters allowed Hellen to rapidly intensify while passing south of the Comoros, with a well-defined eye forming in the middle of the thunderstorms. The cyclone attained peak intensity March 30, with maximum sustained winds estimated 230 km/h (145 mph) according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, M√©t√©o-France in La R√©union. Subsequently, Hellen weakened quickly due to dry air and land interaction with Madagascar, and the storm's eye dissipated. On March 31, the storm made landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a weakened cyclone, despite previous forecasts for the center to remain over water. By April 1, Hellen was no longer a tropical cyclone after most of the convection dissipated. The remnants turned to the west, moving over Mozambique without redeveloping, later dissipating on April 5\\\\. Early in its existence, Hellen's rainfall in Mozambique destroyed hundreds of houses and a bridge. Flooding killed four people in the country, three of whom due to a home collapsing. Later, the cyclone passed south of the Comoros islands, causing flooding due to high storm surge and waves that killed one person. The storm forced 8,956 people to evacuate their homes due to the threat for landslides, while 901 houses were damaged or destroyed. On nearby Mayotte, high rainfall flooded rivers, sweeping one car away. In northwestern Madagascar, Hellen damaged or destroyed 611 houses, leaving 1,736 people homeless. The storm killed three people after capsizing a boat. Meteorological history On March 25, 2014, a weak area of low pressure accompanied by broad, flaring convection became increasingly organized over Mozambique. Owing to favorable environmental conditions, featuring low wind shear, vorticity became more enhanced and symmetrical. A compact system, the low steadily organized as it emerged over the Mozambique Channel on March 26\\\\. Though continued land interaction initially hindered development, enhanced outflow supported convective development as it straddled the Mozambique‚ÄìTanzania border. With high sea surface temperatures in the storm's track, the JTWC anticipated further organization and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 2000 UTC on March 26. Once further offshore on March 27, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center M√©t√©o-France in La R√©union classified the system as Disturbance 14. Drifting slowly eastward, a prominent feeder band developed along the system's eastern side; however, this band disrupted low-level inflow of warm, moist air, and suppressed convection over the circulation center. Though convection later began to consolidate into a small central dense overcast (CDO) feature by March 28, continued disruption of the low-level inflow prevented much development. M√©t√©o-France noted that despite forecasting the storm to peak as a moderate tropical storm, with winds of 75 km/h (45 mph), there was potential for rapid intensification due to the storm's small size. Conversely, the JTWC noted that proximity to land and dry mid-level air, represented by surface outflow boundaries, could hamper significant development. Once further over the Mozambique Channel, the system became increasingly organized and the JTWC initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 21S. M√©t√©o-France followed suit at 0000 UTC on March 29 and classified the cyclone as a moderate tropical storm, with the tropical cyclone warning center in Madagascar assigning the name Hellen. Hellen soon assumed an east-southeast track toward Madagascar, as a ridge established itself to the northeast. Throughout March 29, the storm became increasingly organized with an eye apparent on microwave satellite imagery. Rapid to explosive intensification ensued during the later half of March 29 into March 30 at a rate M√©t√©o-France later referred to as \\"astounding\\". Deep convective banding wrapped around a ragged eye, which soon contracted to \\"pinhole\\" size. This prompted M√©t√©o-France to upgrade Hellen to a tropical cyclone with winds estimated at 150 km/h (90 mph) at 0000 UTC on March 30. Six hours later, they further upgraded the storm to an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). Hellen attained its peak intensity between 1100 and 1500 UTC as a very intense tropical cyclone, with winds of 230 km/h (145 mph) and a barometric pressure of 925 mbar (hPa; 27.32 inHg). This ranked it as one of the most powerful storms over the Mozambique Channel on record. The storm featured a 20 km (12 mi) wide eye embedded within a symmetrical and intense CDO, spanning 240 km (150 mi) across. The JTWC estimated Hellen to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), making it a high- end Category 4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, although this was lowered to 240 km/h (150 mph) in reanalysis. After peak intensity, the cyclone's eye soon began to fill and cool as weakening ensued. Defying previous forecasts, Hellen continued on a southeasterly track toward Madagascar and the likelihood of it making landfall became apparent. By the end of March 30, Hellen's eye had collapsed and disappeared from satellite imagery, as the combination of dry air and land interaction took their toll on the storm. At about 0800 UTC on March 31, Hellen made landfall on Mitsinjo with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph), and the previously unfavorable conditions coupled with land interaction to induce rapid weakening. The ridge to the east turned Hellen to a southwest drift over land. By early on April 1, the convection largely dissipated as the center became difficult to locate, with peak winds dropping to 45 km/h (30 mph). As a result, M√©t√©o-France discontinued advisories that day, as did the JTWC. The remnants moved back over open waters, but were not expected to reorganize due to the poor nature of the convection. As the low continued to the west, the convection increased on April 4 while approaching the coastline of Mozambique, although the system failed to redevelop before moving onshore. Preparations and impact Cyclone Hellen on April 1. The storm had lost most of its convection due to land interaction. During its formative stages, Hellen meandered around northern Mozambique and produced prolonged heavy rains over the region. The city of Pemba in Cabo Delgado Province was the hardest hit area, with the Messalo River over-topping its banks. Tagir Carimo, mayor of Pemba, described the rains as the heaviest he had seen in 20 years. More than 100 poorly constructed homes collapsed in the floods while severe erosion exposed and destroyed water pipes. A major bridge connecting Pemba to surrounding areas was washed away by the Messalo river. This isolated the northern portion of Cabo Delgado Province from the rest of the country, forcing ferries to transport cars. Three people died in the district of Cariaco when their home collapsed while a fourth drowned in Chiuba. Distributing assistance following the storm was disrupted by damaged roads. =Comoro Islands= Heavy rains and storm surge caused significant damage on all three islands of the Comoros, with the worst occurring on Anjouan. There, 901 houses were damaged, of which about 20% were destroyed. Flooding displaced 389 people in Salamani where 33 mud-built homes were destroyed. Landslides isolated the villages of Chiconi, Hamaba, Koni-Djodjo, Miringoni, and Nioumachioi, and damaged a road between Ngandzal√© and Domoni. On the island, 7,879 people had to evacuate their houses due to the risk of further landslides, some of whom went to schools set up as shelters while others stayed with family or friends. Storm surge on Moh√©li flooded parts of Tsamia, Walla, and Zirindani, resulting in one fatality. Several houses were damaged on the island, and Djandro lost power due to a damaged power line. The Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport in Moroni on Grande Comore was closed for about 24 hours due to the storm. Also on the island, a road was damaged, and one house was flooded. Shortly after the storm, workers began repairing roads and distributing aid. Though the center of Cyclone Hellen remained south of Mayotte, it prompted an \\"orange alert\\" on March 30 for the area due to the potential for hurricane-force gusts. The storm's rapid intensification caught most residents on the island off-guard, with widespread disruptions to traffic and electricity taking place. Wind gusts up to downed trees and power lines, blocking off roads while heavy rains caused significant flooding. A peak 24‚Äëhour rainfall of was measured in Mtsamboro between March 29 and 30. In M'Tsangamouji, cars were swept away by a swollen river. Along the coast, waves up to damaged marinas in Dzaoudzi, Hagnoundrou, and Mamoudzou where skiffs were smashed against rocks or stranded. =Madagascar= On March 31, a boat capsized off the coast of northwest Madagascar, killing three and leaving nine others missing. High seas washed away 20 canoes along the coast. Initial assessments of damage across Madagascar were initially hampered by poor weather and inaccessibility. The storm flooded of rice fields across the country, as well as of other crops, threatening harvests after a locust outbreak had occurred in the months prior to the storm. The storm also killed 23 zebu and damaged two dams. Cyclone Hellen destroyed 437 houses and damaged or flooded 174 others, leaving 1,736 people homeless during its passage. The storm also damaged two health facilities and five schools. Overall impact from Hellen was less than expected due to its weakening, with most telephone lines still intact. Due to the storm affecting water access in northwestern Madagascar, there was concern for a disease outbreak, with a flu outbreak noted in Mahajanga. The national Red Cross utilized 54 volunteers to assist in the storm's aftermath, such as distributing kitchen kits and agriculture units. Residents donated 2 million ariary ($800 USD) to the Red Cross, which were used to purchase medicines, while the government provided of rice for affected residents.

It was designed and produced by former Ford saloon car racing driver Jeff Uren. History Jeff Uren managed the Willment race team, which fielded Ford Falcons, Galaxies, Cobras, GT40s and, most famously, the humble Cortina Mk1. When John Willment gave up racing, Jeff set up Race Proved Ltd as his own company. The first car to have the Savage treatment (ie dropping in a Ford 3.0 L Essex V6 engine) was the Mk2 Cortina; this then progressed to Mk3s /Mk4s and even a one off Mk5 Cortina. Race Proved then linked up with Weslake Engineering who did most of the engine tuning for Jeff Uren. The customers had various tuning choices; the standard Ford Capri-spec 3.0 L engine with 138 bhp and 182 ft-lbs of torque, the 170, 180, 190 and the mighty 210 bhp Tecalemit fuel-injected version. Options The most obvious feature on the Cortina Mk3 Savage, is the optional (generally ill-fitting) fibreglass bonnet. Many other options were also available, such as Mati headers and power pipes, Dunlop wheels, adjustable shocks, and various brake upgrades. Along with the Cortina Mk3 Savage, there was also the less well-known Cheetah version. This used the 2.5 L version of the Essex V6 and was a cheaper option. It was also possible in 1978 for the home mechanic to buy a complete installation kit (minus engine) for the 2.5 L or the 3.0 L for ¬£315 and install the engine themselves. Cost Cost of a new Cortina MK3 Savage in the early 70s would start at around ¬£2,000 and then rise accordingly depending on the extra goodies. Production In total it is thought around 1,000 Savages were produced with between 50 and 100 being the Cortina MK3 versions.

The creation of the commission was announced in 2013 after Francis was criticized by victims' groups who questioned his understanding of the full scope of the problem. Following a slow start, the commission has, as of 2015, begun meeting with bishops and sponsoring training for church staff worldwide. The most significant proposal of the commission, the creation of an in-house Vatican tribunal to judge cases of bishops who are accused of failing to protect victims, was approved by Francis but has not been implemented.Vatican Stresses Policy Role of Sex Committee After Ouster New York Times, Feb 8, 2016 Pope Francis has planned a reorganization of the Curia that will alter the role of this Commission.

This response to these actions is the firm beginning for initiatives of many different types, which are intended to repair the damage, to attain justice, and to prevent, by all means possible, the recurrence of similar incidents in the future.\\" He asks the Commission to promote local responsibility in churches, uniting their efforts to those of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, currently under the leadership of Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig M√ºller. He calls for the protection of all children and vulnerable adults, regardless of their religion. Developments In June, 2015, the commission urged Pope Francis to establish a Vatican tribunal to judge bishops accused of failing to protect children from sexual abuse. Three members of the commission met in 2015 with the commission‚Äôs president, Cardinal Se√°n Patrick O'Malley, to voice their objection to Francis‚Äô appointment of Bishop Juan Barros Madrid to lead the Diocese of Osorno in Chile. Barros has been accused of complicity in an abuse case there. Bishop Barros was a close associate of a Santiago priest the Vatican found guilty of sexual abuse in 2011, Fernando Karadima. Father Karadima‚Äôs victims claim Barros was aware of the abuse but did not protest, and subsequently failed to support the victims. In February 2016 the commission met amid increasing criticism that Pope Francis needs to deliver on his promise of ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù for sexual abuse and cover-ups by church clerics. The members watched the Oscar-nominated film Spotlight together. The movie dramatizes the 2001 experience of the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative team at the Boston Globe as they uncovered and exposed systematic sex abuse and subsequent cover- ups by clergy and members of the church hierarchy in Boston.Pope's commission to protect children watch Oscar-nominated Spotlight The Guardian, Feb 5, 2016 In February 2017 the lone abuse victim, Marie Collins, left on the commission resigned.Lone survivor on Vatican abuse commission resigns in frustration National Catholic Reporter, Mar 1, 2017 See also *Vos estis lux mundi *Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People *Ecclesiastical response to Catholic sex abuse cases *Essential Norms *John Jay Report *National Review Board *Pontifical Commission  References  External links *Commission official website *Audits, Child And Youth Protection; US Conference of Catholic Bishops *Charter For The Protection Of Children And Young People; US Conference of Catholic Bishops *Child And Youth Protection; US Conference of Catholic Bishops *National Review Board, Child And Youth Protection; US Conference of Catholic Bishops *Safe Environment, Child And Youth Protection; US Conference of Catholic Bishops *Victim Assistance, Child And Youth Protection; US Conference of Catholic Bishops Category:Pope Francis Category:2014 establishments in Vatican City ","title":"Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors"},{"id":"42351331","text":"Sentinels of Bronze (Italian: Sentinelle di bronzo) is a 1937 Italian war film directed by Romolo Marcellini and starring Fosco Giachetti, Giovanni Grasso and Doris Duranti.

Early career  Magdalena Sawon came to Manhattan from Poland in 1981, having studied art history with an emphasis in Japonism in Warsaw, earning a Master's degree. After a job in a shoe store, and emboldened by a class she took at the New School taught by Estelle Schwartz, she struck out with partner Tamas Banovich, opening an art gallery in the East Village on Avenue A between 4th and 5th Streets in December 1984. The name of the gallery referenced being \\"post\\" the European masters, alludes to Postmodernism, and also points to an early interest in mail art and its distribution by the postal service. In 1988, Sawon and Banovich moved Postmasters Gallery to a Soho loft space at Greene and Spring Streets. Later, the gallery was relocated to Chelsea (1998) and Tribeca in October 2013. Sawon lived in the East Village and Chelsea prior to her move to Soho.

The House was designed by Howard T. Fisher, who founded General Houses, Inc. in 1932. Winslow Ames, a professor of art history at Connecticut College and the art director of the Lyman Allyn Museum, had the home built after attending the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. The House is a single story by rectangular steel prefabricated home that rests upon a concrete slab. It originally had a flat roof and included an attached garage. Throughout the years, the house has undergone significant alteration, including the addition of a gable roof. The house was used by Ames, and later by Connecticut College, as a rental property, until the structure was slated for demolition in 2004. The push to restore the house is credited to Doug Royalty, who worked with the college's Abigail Van Slyck. Completed in 2013, restoration cost $500,000 and involved several phases, including the dismantling, transportation, and reassembly of the house. The house was added to the Connecticut Historic Register in July 2007 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 2009.  Construction and use  The house was designed by Howard T. Fisher, who founded General Houses, Inc., and commissioned by Winslow Ames, a professor of art history at Connecticut College and the art director of the Lyman Allyn Museum. In 1933, Ames decided to construct two houses on the museum-owned property after seeing prefabricated homes at the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. Ames had a strong interest in the Modernism movement and believed such houses would become predominant. Completed in November 1933 and costing about $4,500 in total, the House is a single story by rectangular steel prefabricated home that rests upon a concrete slab. The house is frameless, with the weight borne by by steel panels; the exterior panels are flanged and vertically bolted through wooden T-shaped pieces. The interior wall panels are made of steel and filled with insulation. Originally the house had a flat roof, but it changed to a gable roof at an unknown time. The house has two bedrooms, one bathroom, and an open living-dining-kitchen space. The house also has an attached garage. After its completion, Winslow Ames used the house as a rental property until 1949 when he went to work in a museum in Springfield, Missouri. The house was sold to Connecticut College. Connecticut College continued to rent it to staff and students until 2004, when plans were made to demolish the house. Changing the flat roof to a gable roof was a significant alteration from the original plan; the date of the alteration is unknown, but it preceded 1995.  Restoration  In 2008, an article in The Day stated that the push to restore the house came from conservation specialist Doug Royalty, who was researching prefabricated homes from the 1920s and 1930s. Royalty approached Abigail Van Slyck, the chairwoman of Connecticut College's art history department and architectural studies program about the house. The Day referred to the house's historic value as a new discovery, but its history was included in the Winslow Ames House National Register of Historic Places nomination in 1995. The Winslow Ames House nomination detailed the House's origin, but criticized its gable roof modification. After its re-discovery, Connecticut College began collecting grants to restore the house under the direction of Royalty and Van Slyck. Royalty stated that the House and Winslow Ames House are very rare, with only a few surviving examples in the United States. In April 2007, the leaking roof was repaired. In December 2007, the House received a $28,500 grant from the Dr. Scholl Foundation. The grant was used to complete lead-paint abatement, which would make conducting other restoration work safer. By 2010, the Dr. Scholl Foundation granted another $50,000 and a family foundation provided another $50,000 for the restoration. It was reported that other college grants totaling $15,500 were given for preservation planning, in part by the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. It was reported in May 2010 that a matching grant of $101,500 was given to Connecticut College from the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism, which provided the funding for the next phase of renovations for restoring the House. The celebration for the House's completed restoration was held in October 2013. The cost of restoration totaled around $500,000. The building was dismantled, transported to Philadelphia for restoration and treatment for rust resistance, and then reassembled on the campus. The work was performed by Milner + Carr, a conservation company. The house was added to the Connecticut Historic Register on July 2007 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 2009.

Biography =Early life= Melton was born in Arlington, Georgia, on October 24, 1923. He was the youngest child of Reverend Henry Martin Melton, a Baptist minister, and Mary Marguerite (n√©e Layman) Melton. He was raised in Moultrie, Georgia, and graduated from Moultrie High School in 1941. He first visited Macon, Georgia, when he was six years old. Melton attended Norman Junior College. He later received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Mercer University and his law degree from the Walter F. George School of Law at Mercer University in 1949. He served as a United States Naval officer during World War II and the Korean War. He served as an amphibious warfare officer in the Pacific theater during World War II. In 1983, Melton retired from the U.S. Navy Reserve as a lieutenant commander. He met his future wife, Tommie Beck, while both were attending a play at the Macon Little Theatre. The couple married in October 1954. =Law practice= He practiced as a lawyer in Macon before entering politics. Melton served as the city attorney within the administration of former Mayor Ed Wilson (1960-1963). As city attorney, Melton is credited with spearheading the abolition of Macon's segregation ordinances during Mayor Wilson's tenure. Andrew Manis, a civil rights historian and history professor at Middle Georgia State College, has credited Melton with both the city's desegregation and the improvement ofopportunities for the African-American community during the era, \\"In some ways, Buck Melton was Macon's finest hour when it comes to race relations...Black leadership developed a quiet confidence in Buck Melton as a person.\\" Melton became the President of the Greater Macon Chamber of Commerce in 1971 and president of the Macon Bar Association in 1973. He helped establish the Keep Macon-Bibb Beautiful Commission in 1974 and provided pro bono legal work to the organization. He also served on the board of directors for several organizations, including the Georgia Board of Industry and Trade, the Macon- Bibb County Urban Development Authority, the Macon State College Foundation, and the Macon Civic Club. =Political career= In 1975, Melton was elected mayor of Macon by defeating his opponent, Julius C. Hope, the city's first African-American mayoral candidate. Melton succeeded outgoing Mayor Ronnie Thompson, who had served as Macon's first elected Republican mayor for two consecutive terms. Under Mayor Melton, seventy miles of streets were paved in Macon. He also introduced the rollaway garbage carts as yo facilitate curbside garbage collection, a service which was introduced for the first time under Melton's administration. The garbage cans became known as \\"Buck‚Äôs Buckets.\\" Melton successful proposed a $7 million bond issue, which was used to construct the Mercer University School of Medicine in Macon. (He later served on the School of Medicine's board of directors as well). He also introduced several spending initiatives. He instituted a penny tax, which was used to alleviate the city's property taxes. By his own admission, then-city councilman George Israel, who had been elected to the council in 1975, was one of Mayor Melton's most prominent critics, \\"I was probably his biggest critic on City Council...I spent my eight years (as mayor) apologizing to him for not understanding.\\" Israel, who succeeded Melton in 1979 as the city's second elected Republican mayor, later credited Melton for much of the progress achieved during Israel's own two mayoral terms, saying Melton \\"had a vision for the city and changed a lot of things.\\" Melton declined to seek re-election for a second term in 1979. At the time of his retirement, the Mayor of Macon received very little pay or benefits, which may have contributed his decision not to seek another term. (The Mayor received an annual salary of just $30,000, with no life insurance, health insurance or retirement plan). He was succeeded by George Israel, who became Macon's second Republican mayor. Melton returned to his law practice after leaving office. He co-founded the Sell & Melton law firm through the merger of his own firm, McKenna, House, Lancaster & Green, with a second firm, Sell, Comer & Popper. In 1982, Melton ran as an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate for Governor of Georgia. While the Atlanta Constitution praised his credentials, Melton's campaign lacked the funding to run an effective campaign against opponents with deeper pockets. He lost the Democratic primary election to Joe Frank Harris, who was elected Governor in the general election. Buck Melton made one more foray into elected politics in 1999 when he sought election as Mayor of Macon again. Incumbent Mayor Jim Marshall had decided to run for the United States House of Representatives. Melton entered the race for Mayor of Macon, but was defeated in the Democratic mayoral primary election by C. Jack Ellis. Ellis went on to win the 1999 mayoral general election, becoming the city's first African- American mayor. =Later life= In 2004, Melton published his memoir, called \\"Closing Arguments.\\" Former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn (D-Georgia) contributed a tribute to his career on the book's back cover, writing, \\"Buck is an unsung hero of Middle Georgia's prosperity and growth,\\" further saying that Melton \\"had a hand in the most successful and significant undertakings\\" in the region throughout the previous three decades. Buck Melton remained very involved with his law firm until he suffered a major stroke in April 2007. The McKenna National Guard Armory underwent a major, six million dollar renovation and was rededicated as the Buck Melton Community Center during the summer of 2009. Melton and his wife, Tommie, attended the dedication. Melton thanked the community in a speech at the dedication ceremony, \\"This building is a shining star...This community‚Äôs going to be a whole new world because of this.\\" Melton's health had further declined following heart complications suffered in January 2014. He died at the Carlyle Place nursing center in Macon, Georgia, on March 5, 2014, at the age of 90. His funeral was held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Macon. Three Macon mayors attended his memorial - current Mayor Robert Reichert and former mayors Lee Robinson and C. Jack Ellis. He was buried in Rose Hill Cemetery with full military honors. He was survived by his wife of fifty-nine years, Tommie Melton, and their two children, Leigh Singleton and Buckner F.

April (Emma Roberts) is at soccer practice when her friends laugh about their coach Mr. B (James Franco) having a crush on April. Mr. B asks April if she can babysit his son Michael and he then offers her the position of striker. Fred and Teddy walk back to their car talking about what they would do if they got in a drunk driving accident. Teddy says he would drive away even if it was his crush, April. At a party, Teddy invites April to the graveyard with him and Fred. The two hold hands as they run to the graveyard. April carves a heart into the tree and the two bond. They head back to the party and drink alcohol with all the other guests. Teddy goes outside to throw up when Emily (Zoe Levin) takes him to the bathroom to get mouthwash.

In Teddy's art class, the teacher observes Fred's art and tells him about how he went down the \\"tunnel of death\\" and realized he is \\"not Bob\\" as he drove down the highway. At April's soccer game she messes up and misses many chances to score. Mr. B offers to drive her home and takes her back to his house. The two sit on the couch and begin kissing then April loses her virginity to Mr. B. The next day when April is babysitting, Michael tells her he has another babysitter, April's teammate Raquel (Margaret Qualley), which upsets her. She tells Mr. B that she doesn't want to come over to his house anymore. At a party, April goes outside to sit with Teddy. He says he cares about and loves her, which confuses her as they don't talk much. Later on Teddy and Fred go to get weed from Skull (Keegan Allen). Among other things, Fred tells Skull that Teddy talked about wanting to cut Skull's heart out although Fred was the one who had suggested it after he brought along a knife. Fred then asks Skull if he had a choice, would he rather be gay or a girl to which Skull and Teddy make fun of Fred and call him a \\"faggot\\". Fred questions why they think it's wrong to be with a man then explains that being inside a girl means that she's the one in control of the man and not the other way around. He then falls to the floor and starts crying. They get back in the car and Fred wants to drive down a one-way road, but Teddy demands to get out. Fred drives down the one-way by himself while repeatedly shouting \\"I'm not Bob\\". April texts Teddy, making them smile as Teddy walks alone. Cast Production Filming took place throughout November and December 2012 in Southern California, and at the homes of Val Kilmer and Gia Coppola's mother.http://www.salon.com/2014/05/01/gia_coppola_on_james_franco_family_ties_and_palo_alto Salon.com Release Palo Alto premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in August 2013 and at the Venice Film Festival in September 2013.

On its summit is the Bismarck tower.  Geography  = Location = The hill lies 3 km northwest of Bad D√ºrkheim on the eastern edge of the Palatine Forest on the forest estate of the municipality of Kallstadt; the actual village being in the northeast, 4 km away. On the southeastern slope of the hill, 700 metres from the summit, are the ruins of the Weilach farmstead, first mentioned in 1381. The River Isenach flows past the Peterskopf to the southwest before entering the town of Bad D√ºrkheim. = Accessibility = A tarmac road runs to the Peterskopf from Leistadt, the distance to the car park by Forsthaus Lindemannsruhe (470 m) being 2.5 km. From there the summit may be reached on foot in about ten minutes. = Surrounding area = In the area around the Peterskopf there is a host of historic sites: the Teufelsstein hill to the southeast with its eponymous rock formation, which was a cult site in Celtic times; and a Celtic circular rampart, the Heidenmauer and the Roman quarry of Kriemhildenstuhl on the K√§stenberg, a southeastern spur of the Teufelsstein. On the far side of the Isenach valley lie the medieval ruins of Limburg Abbey and the castle of Hardenburg.

Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) is a concept related to astrophysical accretion discs. In non-self-gravitating discs, for example around newly forming stars, the instability can be triggered by an axisymmetric bump, at some radius r_0, in the disc surface mass-density. It gives rise to exponentially growing non-axisymmetric perturbation in the vicinity of r_0 consisting of anticyclonic vortices. These vortices are regions of high pressure and consequently act to trap dust particles which in turn can facilitate planetesimal growth in proto-planetary discs. The Rossby vortices in the discs around stars and black holes may cause the observed quasi-periodic modulations of the disc's thermal emission. The theory of the Rossby wave instability in accretion discs was developed by Lovelace et al. and Li et al. for thin Keplerian discs with negligible self- gravity and earlier by Lovelace and Hohlfeld for thin disc galaxies where the self-gravity may or may not be important and where the rotation is in general non-Keplerian. Rossby waves, named after Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby are important in planetary atmospheres and oceans and are also known as it planetary waves. These waves have a significant role in the transport of heat from equatorial to polar regions of the Earth. They may have a role in the formation of the long-lived (>300 yr) Great Red Spot on Jupiter which is an anticyclonic vortex. The Rossby waves have the notable property of having the phase velocity opposite to the direction of motion of the atmosphere or disc in the comoving frame of the fluid.

Background On stage, Townshend claimed that he wrote the song on the night that he gave up drinking. Lead singer Roger Daltrey refused to sing the song, possibly because (according to Richard Barnes) the song was too personal. Alternatively, it was speculated by authors Steve Grantley and Alan Parker that Daltrey wanted to make it clear that Townshend had the drinking problem, rather than himself. Townshend later said about his drinking with the Who: The song, containing additional lyrics not seen in the final version, was originally demoed with the working title of \\"No Way Out.\\" This version later appeared on Townshend's demo collection album, Scoop 3. \\"However Much I Booze\\" addresses themes including loneliness, the illusion of reality within the entertainment world and Townshend's own feuding with Who lead singer Roger Daltrey. The song's cheerful melody contrasts with the grim subject matter. The melody is complemented with energetic playing from drummer Keith Moon and bassist John Entwistle, further contrasting the mood of the lyrics. Live history \\"However Much I Booze\\" was played sporadically during The Who's 1975 tour, making it one of the three songs from The Who by Numbers to be played at that time (although \\"Slip Kid\\" was attempted during the band's 1976 tour.)

Early methods Last-position memory dates back to the days of magnetic tape-based media. For instance, open-reel tapes and cassette tapes automatically have this property since they automatically stay where they are when paused or stopped. Indeed, tape-based media can be started and stopped and left at any point, and moved to any point, the only problem being that the further the point one wishes to move to in a recording, the longer it takes to get there. It is easy to go back and listen again to the last few seconds of a tape recording, e.g. to listen to something one could not hear properly. Some tapes such as 8-track tapes couldn't be re-wound, seeing as \\"looped\\" with a solenoid that shifted the tape to a spool aside of its endless loop. Other early methods of \\"last-position memory\\" sometimes involved a user having to manually jot down a timecode of a program, such as a movie they were watching, in order to know where to continue from. Early DVD players didn't have last- position memory, and they also suffered from always starting back at the beginning after a disc had been ejected. Computer-based devices Some of the earliest instances of non-tape-based media playback devices to have \\"last- position memory\\" paired computer chips with media storage that didn't natively support it. For instance, some CD players have last-position memory to the level of the playback device itself, as opposed to the storage medium; in which if a disc is ejected, it clears the memory buffer. MP3 players also have last-position memory. Typically this is to be found on mid- to high-end models of them. Less expensive models of MP3 players sometimes only do last-position memory by knowing the file it's on without knowing the playback progress, and some lower-end models don't store last position memory at all. =Save- stating= Sometimes the effect of \\"last-position memory\\" can be emulated by savestating in virtual machines playing media playback software, such as VLC Media Player which doesn't natively support \\"last-position memory\\" Category:Computer memory Category:Digital audio players Category:Portable audio players Category:Portable media players ","title":"Last position memory"},{"id":"42352235","text":"William Henry Murch (18 November 1867 - 1 May 1928) was an English cricketer active from 1889 to 1906 who played for Gloucestershire and London County.

The historic name was Elerch (the Welsh word for 'swan'; also recorded as a male personal name), which may be related to the name of the river Leri which flows through the area. The modern name Bontgoch in Welsh means \\"the red bridge\\". The nearest major town is Talybont. It is 2 miles northeast of Aberystwyth. Population The population of the parish in 1929 was 185. There are now about 53 properties in Bont Goch. In 2005, a survey noted \\"that in recent years the village has experienced a remarkable regeneration, with an influx of younger couples moving back into the area, and that the village now has 30 children under fifteen years of age, 22 of whom were born in Bontgoch.\\" Early history The village is in the valley of the river Leri. The original settlement was by the bridge, hence the name \\"Bont Goch\\" or \\"Red Bridge\\". There is a medieval holy well, with a possible Dark Age dedication to St Padarn. There are also several bronze age burnt mounds or hearths, and what may be a Bronze Age standing stone. The earliest mine appears to have been at Llanerch-clydau, which is said to be \\"quite ancient... worked in the 17th century, but not later\\". The area remained, however, essentially rural. By the late 18th century the Crosswood and Court Grange estates had landholdings in the area. The Crosswood estate maps in the National Library of Wales show that there was very little settlement or enclosure in the 18th century, with just a few cottages on unenclosed moorland, and a single small farm surrounded by a few small fields and woodland on steeper slopes. There were still some metal mines. The Gilbertson family In about 1818, the Gilberston family moved to Plas Cefn Gwyn, Elerch, now a Grade II listed building, situated about 500 metres north east of what is now the church. Plas Cefn Gwyn was built in about 1818 for William Cobb Gilbertson (1768-1854). William Cobb Gilbertson came from Shadwell in London in about 1789 and settled first in Plas Dolclettwr, Llangynfelyn, before moving to Plas Cefn Gwyn, Elerch, in about 1818, as shown by baptismal records. The house at Plas Cefn Gwyn was built for him. He was appointed as an Attorney at the Court of the King's Bench in 1791. He became a deputy lieutenant of Cardiganshire and a captain in the Cardiganshire battalion for Supplementary Militia in 1797, at the time of the Fishguard invasion. He became a Justice of the Peace for Cardiganshire in 1800, and a Commissioner, under the Income Act, for Genau'r-glyn and Llanbadarn, Cardiganshire. In 1802 he became a Commissioner for managing Stamp Duty and of the Property Act in 1803. His son, the Reverend Lewis Gilbertson B.D. (1814-1896) spent his youth at Elerch. He was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1836 (M.A. 1839, B.D. 1847). He was a Fellow of Jesus College, 1840-72. He was ordained deacon in 1837 by the bishop of Gloucester and Bristol and started his clerical career as curate of Sheringham, near Cheltenham before being ordained priest in 1838. From 1841 until 1852 he was vicar of Llangorwen, Cardiganshire, where he became known for his connection with the Oxford Movement. He introduced Tractarian practices such a daily service (in Welsh), a weekly Eucharist and the singing of Gregorian Chant. In 1852 he returned to Jesus College and after a period as junior bursar and lecturer (1852-1855) became Vice-Principal in 1855, a position he retained until 1872. He was responsible for the construction of three very fine buildings in the village: a school, a church and a vicarage. He was a follower of the Oxford Movement, which is reflected in his choice of medieval revivalist architecture of high quality. He had a school built in 1856, followed by a church in 1865-1868, and a vicarage in 1874, using nationally regarded architects. The architect of the school was George Edmund Street (who went on to design the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand). The architect of the church was William Butterfield. The architect of the vicarage (Elerch Vicarage) was John Prichard. Gilbertson became the first vicar of Elerch in April 1869, but exercised his right as patron to appoint a successor in November 1870, becoming rector of Braunston in Northamptonshire (a position within the gift of Jesus College) that same year. He was rector of Braunston until retiring to Aberystwyth in 1893, where he died on 2 April 1896. His widow had a stained-glass window erected in the Jesus College chapel in his memory, which includes a picture of Archbishop William Laud. He left a son, Rev. Canon Lewis Gilbertson, M.A., who donated the family papers to the National Library of Wales in 1927. Revival of lead mining In the second half of the nineteenth century, the population was boosted by new work in new lead mines, and houses were built in a settlement adjacent to the present church. No doubt the school, church and vicarage were constructed in order to reflect and serve the larger and more concentrated population of the village which sprang up to house the lead miners. The miners worked in the hills behind the village. The Mynydd Gorddu Mine, Bontgoch (Elerch) was a small mine about 1.5 km west south west of the village. A trial trench was dug in 1848 and in 1870 a seam of lead glance was found. By 1884, output of the mine was up to 901 tons of lead ore and 183 tons of zinc ore. Mining appears to have ceased by 1900. Wind farm In 1997, Mynydd Gorddu became the site of a windfarm, which continues to operate there. Listed buildings The village contains a number of listed buildings, including the church, the vicarage and the school built by Lewis Gilbertson. The other listed buildings are Plas Cefn Gwyn, a small non-conformist chapel with a house attached, and a 19th century mill. The last class in the school was the class of 1958, consisting of four boys and three girls. Church of St Peter The parish church of St Peter designed in 1865 by renowned Victorian architect William Butterfield on the instructions of the Reverend Lewis Gilbertson is a Grade II* listed building. It was originally constituted as a chapelry of the Llanbadarn Fawr parish with a priest with the status of a perpetual curate who was allowed an income of ¬£150 per annum. Before the construction of the church, the parish was contained with the parishes of Llanbadarn Fawr and Llanfihangel Genau'r-Glyn. There is stained glass by Alexander Gibbs (1868). The baptismal register begins in 1865 and the registers of marriage and burial begin in 1868.

Judge Bundy then took him on as a partner in his firm. Public offices In 1868, he was elected district attorney of Dunn County; he served until 1873, earning re-election in 1870. In November 1873, he was elected County Judge for Dunn County and served two four year terms. The November after leaving office as County Judge, he was elected to represent Dunn County in the Wisconsin State Assembly as a Republican in the first election in the state for two-year assembly terms. He did not run for re- election in 1884. He was City Attorney for Menomonie from 1882 until 1890, when he was elected to another term as district attorney.

Based in Quebec early in her career, she worked as a teacher associated with the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario for a decade, returned to Quebec, and ended her career in Vancouver, British Columbia. A well-known painter, she worked with or organized groups including the Art Association of Montreal, the Beaver Hall Group and the Canadian Group of Painters. Her works are in the collection of the Canadian War Museum, the National Gallery of Canada, the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts Montr√©al, Mus√©e National des Beaux-Arts du Qu√©bec, the Vancouver Art Gallery and other, smaller galleries. One art critic referred to May as the \\"Emily Carr of Montreal\\" due to her interest in landscape and nature. Her art was originally influenced by her avid interest in French Impressionism, but her mature style owed much to the Group of Seven and more international modernist trends. Early life May was born to Evelyn Henriette Walker and Edward May. Her date of birth is often reported as 1884, but she was in fact born on September 11, 1877. Her father, Edward May was a self-made man and became the mayor of Verdun, a borough on the outskirts of Montreal. He later became a successful real estate developer and moved her and the rest of her family to a more prosperous neighbourhood in Montreal called Westmount. Education Though May displayed an active interest in art throughout her early years, she did not pursue formal education until she was in her mid-twenties. She delayed her education in order to help take care of her nine younger brothers and sisters while her parents worked trying to provide for them. In 1902 she became one of the first female students enrolled in the Art Association of Montreal (1909 - 1912) under teachers Alberta Cleland and William Brymner. There she was awarded scholarships twice. During this time, she exhibited small watercolours as part of the 1910 Art Association of Montreal Annual Spring Exhibition. Cleland was a female artist from Montreal that worked with a broad range of subjects and tools. Brymner was an important influence on May's style of art, and taught her from 1909 until the end of her studies in 1912. May was influenced by Brymner's teachings of French modernism, including Impressionism and Post- Impressionism, and his encouragement for students to find their own individual style. These influences took her to France, England and Holland after her graduation in 1912. There she traveled, visited galleries, studied and painted until her return to Quebec in 1916. During her travels, she studied with James Wilson Morrice, who strongly influenced her style of painting. In 1916, she returned to Montreal, where she resumed her artistic career. Her family owned a second home in the countryside of Hudson, Quebec, where she frequently retreated to paint. Career The years following her education brought May a series of remarkable achievements and work opportunities. In 1913 the National Gallery bought three of her art works and would eventually buy two more before 1924. In 1916, after May returned to Montreal, she joined other female artists who worked on commissioned pieces specifically about women's involvement in the First World War. One of her major works was a detailed six-by-seven foot canvas entitled Women Making Shells (1919) honoring munitions workers in a factory. During May's commissioned employment with the Royal Canadian Academy, she made 250 dollars per month, a large fee at that time. 1x1px 2x2px Beaver Hall Group In 1920, May was a founding member of the Beaver Hall Group in Montreal, which supported the local Montreal art community and organized exhibits of their work. Initially led by A. Y. Jackson of the Group of Seven, the Beaver Hall Group was a selection of talented painters from Montreal; most of them had attended the Art Association of Quebec and/or studied under William Brymner. The Beaver Hall Group was extremely progressive at the time for allowing women to join and have important roles and positions. Though the group officially disbanded around 1924, a majority of the female members continued to do artistic work afterwards, nearly all of them foregoing marriage or childbearing to do so. Many of the women continued to work with and exhibit with each other. Among those were Prudence Heward, Lilias Torrance Newton, Mabel Lockerby, Anne Savage, Sarah Robertson, Nora Collyer, Kathleen Morris, and Ethel Seath. Emily Coonan, with whom May had traveled in Europe in 1912, was also a member of the group but preferred to go her own way when the group disbanded. In the winter of 1924, May traveled to Baie-Saint-Paul, where she painted with A.Y. Jackson of the Group of Seven. May developed a landscape style in part based on the aesthetic of the group. In 1927, May, along with three other women from the Beaver Hall Group, met with the British Columbian painter Emily Carr. Canadian Group of Painters Shortly after the Beaver Hall Group dissolved, May founded a new group: the Canadian Group of Painters, which officially began in 1933. The group had their first exhibition the same year of their founding in Atlantic City, New Jersey, followed by another exhibition in Toronto a few months later. The group was the successor of the Group of Seven and the Beaver Hall Group. May's involvement with the Canadian Group of Painters lasted a few years, but, while she was in that group, the problems of the Great Depression affected her and her family's finances. She moved to Ottawa, Ontario, where she taught in a private school. In 1938 she was appointed leader of children's classes at the National Gallery of Canada. She taught for 12 years until 1950, when she returned to Montreal, before later moving to Vancouver, British Columbia.  Artistic style  Henrietta Mabel May's primary medium was painting in oil. Initially, she followed the Impressionists. Her main focus was landscapes, although she also painted human figures. Her paint strokes were very strong and pleasing to the eye as the colours flowed together softly. The colours she used were not straight from the tube but blended for more of a naturalistic approach. While May traveled to Europe, she was inspired by the culture of Paris, which was incorporated into her work. During the time she spent in Hudson every summer, she painted the views around her, creating some of her most successful works. In 1913 her paintings began garnering a lot of recognition and attention. She sold four of her works to the National Gallery of Canada and continued to sell several more in the following years. She was elected as an associate of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1915. May was a bold painter who could paint unusual scenes that people did not expect from a woman. For example, Women Making Shells was a powerful painting conveying a scene where women were working in a factory along with men, a novel scene at that time. Once she became a member of the Beaver Hall Group, her style began to deviate from its impressionistic origins. As the years went on, May's naturalistic approach of applying colour in soothing, rhythmic brushstrokes developed greatly. Her art exhibited more realism, and showed a greater understanding of light and the atmosphere in her landscapes. She began to take on the style of the Group of Seven by whom she was heavily influenced. May's Melting Snow (1925) was a reflection of the dancing waters and lyrical mountains surrounded by flat colours and hills. In addition, she used loose brushstrokes in the sky. Her palette was further modified by the influence of a religious group she joined in the late 1930s. An offshoot of the theosophists, the I AM group believed that dark colors produce negative effects.

Exhibitions May exhibited frequently. Upon her retirement to Vancouver at the age of 50, she held a retrospective of her work at the Dominion Gallery. This show resulted in the sale of 100 of her paintings. A posthumous exhibition of her work along with other works from the Beaver Hall Group occurred at the Sir George Williams Art Galleries (now Concordia Art Gallery) in October 1982. In 2015, the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts Montr√©al organized a multi-museum tour of a show containing May's work among others: 1920s Modernism in Montreal: The Beaver Hall Group. Personal life May never married, but was immersed in family life via her 9 brothers and sisters. After the dissolution of the Beaver Hall Group's studios, she retained close personal friendships with the remaining female artists, including Lilias Torrance Newton, Mabel Lockerby, Anne Savage, Sarah Robertson, and Nora Collyer. Savage remembered her as both a painter and a person: She was a brilliant figure at the gallery. She painted with such vigour and strength - gay, rhythmic colour using the impressionist's technique of scintillating colour. She spent some time in France, came back radiant - loved life - painted in the landscapes of the Eastern Townships, where she built up her singing happy pictures.

Wilson has also held visiting positions at the University of Cologne, the University of St. Andrews, the University of Barcelona, Australian National University, and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science. Philosophical work Wilson's research has focused largely on metaphysics and epistemology, with a focus on the metaphysics of modality, fundamentality, science, and mind, and the epistemologies of skepticism, a priori deliberation, and necessity, as well as physicalism, emergentism, and mental causation. In the study of physicalism, Wilson first published on the 'proper subset strategy' for avoiding the worry that higher- level and their realizing lower-level properties would causally overdetermine their effects: properties are associated with sets of causal powers, and one property realizes another by the realized property being associated with a set of causal powers that is a proper subset of that associated with the realizing property;'How superduper does a physicalist supervenience need to be?' Wilson also argues that a nontrivial version of physicalism must be defined to exclude fundamental mental entities. Wilson's criticism of 'Grounding', understood as a generic relation of metaphysical dependence, problematizes a notion that has recently occupied center stage in metaphysics.'No work for a theory of grounding' Wilson argues that examples of \\"the ‚Äòsmall-g‚Äô grounding relations\\" such as \\"token identity, realization, the classical extensional part-whole relation, the set membership relation, the proper subset relation, and the determinable-determinate relation\\" are \\"a heterogeneous lot\\" which \\"counts against the idea there is a distinctive coarse-grained metaphysical relation that is the unifying element with respect to these relations‚Äîfor what real unity do they display?\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/grounding/#SkeAboGro References External links * Category:21st-century American philosophers Category:Living people Category:American women philosophers Category:Metaphysicians Category:Epistemologists Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:University of Toronto Scarborough faculty Category:Cornell University alumni Category:University of California, San Diego alumni Category:University of Colorado Boulder alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jessica Wilson"},{"id":"42352448","text":"The Dumping Ground Survival Files is a five-part CBBC miniseries various Dumping Ground characters, giving information on how to survive in The Dumping Ground.

History In 1144, the Commune of Rome attempted to establish a government modeled on the old Roman republic in opposition to the temporal power of the higher nobles and the pope. This included setting up a senate along the lines of the ancient one. The revolutionaries divided Rome into fourteen regions, each electing four senators for a total of 56 (although one source, often repeated, gives a total of 50). These senators, the first real senators since the 7th century, elected as their leader Giordano Pierleoni, son of the Roman consul Pier Leoni, with the title patrician, since the term consul had been deprecated as a noble styling. This renovated form of government was constantly embattled. By the end of the 12th century, it had undergone a radical transformation, with the reduction of the number of senators to a single one ‚Äì Summus Senator ‚Äì being thereafter the title of the head of the civil government of Rome. In modern terms, for example, this is comparable to the reduction of a board of commissioners to a single commissioner, such as the political head of the police department of New York City.

The parish is part of the benefice of Abbas and Templecombe, Henstridge and Horsington within the archdeaconry of Wells. History One of the manors within the parish was held by Earl Leofwine who gave it to Bishop Odo of Bayeux after the Norman Conquest. The church was probably established during the period when the manor was held by Shaftesbury Abbey, but granted to the Knights Templar while it was held by his descendant Serlo FitzOdo. who established a preceptory in the village in 1185. The preceptory served as an administrative centre for the lands held by the Templars in the south west of England and Cornwall. It may also have been used to train men and horses for the Crusades. After the Knights Templar were suppressed following the 1307 order by Pope Clement IV, it was granted to the Knights of St John, who held it until the dissolution of the monasteries. Parts of the original 12th- century church remain; however it underwent a major Victorian restoration in the 19th century, which included complete rebuilding of the chancel and the addition of the vestry. The foundations of the tower are probably Saxon. The church was damaged by bombing in World War II. Four bombs falling near the church on its southern side damaged some of the arches in the nave along with the roof and tower, breaking some of the windows and damaging the organ. Architecture The stone church is dressed with Hamstone with clay tile roofs. It has a two-bay chancel, four-bay nave and a south transept. The entrance porch is at the southern end of the church at the base of the two- stage tower. The buttresses were added after the tower was built. The oldest bell in the tower was cast at the Salisbury foundry around 1420. Two bells of 1656 were cast by Robert Purdue with two from 1736 by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family. The most recent bell is from 1891. In the churchyard is a high stone cross which serves as the war memorial for the village. The churchyard also contains four Commonwealth war graves, of two British Army soldiers of World War I and an airman and a WRNS Petty Officer of World War II. CWGC Cemetery report, details from casualty record. Interior The font was made from Purbeck Marble in the 12th century; however the cover is from 1897. A cup and cover from 1628, two salvers made by Anthony Nelson in 1725 and a flagon from 1845 are included in the church plate. =The Templecombe Head= In the church is a painting on wooden boards of a head, which was discovered in the roof of an outhouse of a local building in 1945. The tenant of the cottage was collecting wood in an outhouse where part of the ceiling had fallen down. She noticed a face above her which was on a wooden panel fixed by wire to the inside of the roof and previously plastered over. The painting is thought to be from the 13th century, and connected with the Templecombe Preceptory (or Combe Templariorum) which was established in the village in 1185. It was given to the church in 1956. Restoration work in the 1950s and again in the 1980s has identified gold stars on the picture and microscopic evidence for bright colours which are no longer in evidence. The colours were present in the 1940s when it was discovered, but impaired when the local vicar cleaned it in his bath with Vim. The addition of a keyhole and hinges at some time in the past suggests it was used as a door. For many years the head has been believed to be that of Christ but without the halo which was the norm in religious iconography at the time. The Knights Templar were suppressed partly because of their use of the image of Christ without the halo. There has been speculation linking the image with the Shroud of Turin. Other explanations suggest the image is not of Christ but of John the Baptist.

They were built at the same time as a diesel-hydraulic version, BB 69000.  Transmission  The locomotives were an attempt to produce a new class of locomotives of extremely high power. Two high-speed diesel engines producing 2,000 hp each could provide this, but existing electric transmissions were unable to handle so much. New techniques were needed, with several innovations. A three-phase AC alternator was used, rather than a DC generator. This avoided the commutator needed, which had become a limitation on power and machine speed for large locomotives. The AC current was then rectified by arrays of silicon diodes and the DC produced was fed to the two traction motors. The motor voltage was 1,800V at a continuous current rating of 980A, 1,030A (one hour) and 1,580A peak for starting. Control of power was by controlling the excitation of the alternator, although there was also a single step of field weakening for the motors. The Alsthom ATD2 alternator was itself an innovative design in which two diesel engines drove a common alternator sited between them. The size of the alternator had also become a limitation at this time, requiring it to be either larger or spun more rapidly in order to handle the power. However both of these increased the centrifugal forces on the alternator, making its mechanical construction more difficult. The innovation was to have no stator but instead two concentric rotors spinning in opposite directions. The two engines each rotated in the same relative direction, but were mounted at opposite ends with their drive through Geislinger couplings, and so drove the rotors contra- rotating. Each diesel engine ran at up to 1,500 rpm so the effective rotational speed of the alternator was 3,000 rpm, between the two parts. The inner rotor carried the field, supplied by two slip rings, with the outer rotor delivering its current through three more slip rings. There were only two roller bearings for each rotor with the outer rotor bearings carried on the frame and the inner rotor carried on the frame at one end and inside the other rotor at the far end: this was the only bearing running at the full 3,000 rpm relative speed. Unlike some twin-engined locomotives, both engines needed to be running in service. The alternator brushgear would overheat if one was not rotating and also the cooling airflow would be inadequate. The auxiliaries were split between the two engines: electrical charging and the alternator excitation on one, and the brake compressor on the other. There were two traction motors, each mounted on an Alsthom 3-axle monomotor bogie of the same design as the electric CC 40100. The bogies had two gear ratios, which could be selected when stationary, giving top speeds of either for passenger services or for freight.

Opened in January 1942, the Atlantic City Training Center was a large enlisted basic training centers (BTC) of the Army Air Forces during World War II.Manning, Thomas A.

History The need to train the tens of thousands of men entering the Army Air Corps in 1942 led to the decision by the service to open additional Basic Training Centers (BTC). In June 1942, Atlantic City was selected for a BTC, and with time of the essence, the War Department leased hotels, apartment houses, and other miscellaneous building to accommodate trainees. With the assistance of public officials and owners of the city's hotels, forty-five hotels were provided for United States Military occupancy. Included in the Army‚Äôs acquisitions was the Atlantic City Convention Hall, the largest structure of its kind in the world (at that time), to be used as the Headquarters of Basic Training Center No. 7. The main hall was used for mass exercises and physical training where up to four thousand men could do calisthenics together. Most of the other space was used for offices. The government also renovated the facility. On 22 July 1942, the first trainees arrived for six weeks of indoctrination training. It consisted of: * Basic military general orders, military conduct, close order and open order drill. * Familiarization with all standard weapons, assembly, cleaning and utilization. * Physical training with obstacle course. * Gas mask training and procedures. * Rifle range qualification on the 30 cal carbine rifle * One week of field training One part of the Atlantic City Center was the training of illiterate recruits how to read and write. Without these skills, a modern war machine could not function as designed. This task fell to the Army‚Äôs Special Training Units. The 704th Training Group, from Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, came to Atlantic City to assist the newly activated 565th Technical School Squadron. It was their mission to see that every recruit reached a fourth grade reading/writing level within twelve weeks. Instructions in reading and writing were added to the other training and drilling that recruits practiced daily. Overcrowded conditions, however led the War Department to open a facility in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1943, and many of the men assigned to Atlantic City were sent to North Carolina to the new Basic Training Center No. 10 there.AFHRA Document 00146912 Basic training ended at Atlantic City on 28 February 1944 and jurisdiction of Greensboro was transferred to the AAF Personnel Distribution Command. The mission was changed from basic training to the perpetration of airmen and soldiers for overseas combat duty. AAF personnel, many who had completed basic training at Atlantic City were assigned to one of the overseas air forces, equipped and scheduled for deployment to whatever part of the world they were needed. In February 1945, overseas shipments were ended and the facility was inactivated later that year with the end of the war. All leases were terminated and the facilities returned to their civilian owners. The military facilities were completely redeveloped in the postwar years, and was incorporated into the city's urban community and there is no evidence today of the center. Most military written records about the Atlantic City Training Center were destroyed during the 1950s and 1960s. According to an archivist at the National Archives, College Park, Maryland, the decision was made to destroy written World War II records if they were not directly related to combat units. Basic Training Center No. 7 was not considered directly connected to combat units, and its records were disposed of.

She was commissioned on 4 December 1943 at Montreal. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service Grou arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia at the end of 1943 and worked up in St. Margaret's Bay. In March 1944, she was assigned to escort group EG 6 based at Derry. In April 1944, Grou made her way to Kola Inlet to escort a RA 59 back to the United Kingdom. From then on she was based at different times at Derry, Portsmouth and Plymouth. During Operation Neptune, the naval component of the invasion of Normandy, Grou was used for anti-submarine patrols to protect the invasion fleet. In February 1945, Grou returned to Canada to begin a tropicalization refit on 4 March at Dartmouth. She emerged from the refit in September 1945 and was transferred to the west coast in October. On 25 February 1946, she was paid off into the reserve at Esquimalt, British Columbia. She was sold in 1948 to Capital Iron & Metals Ltd. at Victoria, British Columbia and broken up 1948‚Äì1949.

It was written by Pete Townshend. Lyrics The lyrics of \\"New Song\\" are about FM radio's demand for bands to clone their previous hits. Pete Townshend, the author of the song, once said, \\"This is a diatribe against the requirements of FM radio (at the time) for every band of the day to produce 'clones' of their earlier successful airplay hits. This was my signal to everyone that I had decided to deal a wonky deck full of theatrical parodies and anachronisms. Needless to say, the song didn't get airplay and neither did it make the critics happy. Great sounding cut, such a pity it is full of such cynical sentiment.\\" Music Like many of Who Are You's songs, \\"New Song\\" features a slick production sound, as well as the use of synthesizers. New Song' was the first song I ever wrote on a polyphonic synthesizer. It was blocked out on an ARP OMNI, that company's first polyphonic machine. It may have been the first multi-voice synth ever. But I cheated quite a lot; it had only one filter and envelope-shaping amplifier.\\", Townshend said. Release and reception \\"New Song\\" was first released on the Who Are You album.

They were built at the same time, and for comparison with, as a diesel-electric version, CC 70000. The use of hydraulic transmission saved 30 tons in weight and enabled the locomotives to run on four axles instead of the six axles of the diesel-electric. These locos should not be confused with the BB 69200 which were rebuilds of the BB 66000\\\\.  Design  From 1959, the SNCF had identified a need for high-power mixed- traffic diesel locomotives of around 4,000 hp. (MTE), a joint venture between Jeumont-Schneider and Creusot-Loire, began work on a suitable design. Alsthom also started work on a diesel-electric with the same engines, which would become the CC 70000. Powertrain There were two diesel engine prime movers and each drove one bogie through a hydraulic transmission. Past experience led MTE to place the transmission units directly on the bogies: cardan shafts led from the engine to the transmission, which unusually was mounted transversely, and the transmissions were geared to the typically French monomotor bogie. The transmissions used were Voith L821gr, These had two torque converters and a fluid coupling. The first torque converter was scoop-controlled and was only fully filled for starting. For efficiency, high-speed running used a coupling. A 500 hp hydraulic retarder was also considered, although not initially installed, and this would be used for long descents. ; Cooling Each engine had a separate cooling group mounted in the side panels with a pair of cooling fans in the roof. These had three separate circuits: high-temperature engine cooling water, medium-temperature cooling water and engine oil. An oil-water heat exchanger cooled the transmission oil.

Examples exist in condensed matter systems, and are typically reached by the non-ergodic conditions created through laser photo excitation. Nasu, K. Photoinduced phase transitions. World Scientific, Singapore (2004). Short-lived hidden states of matter have also been reported in crystals using lasers. Recently a persistent hidden state was discovered in a crystal of Tantalum(IV) sulfide (TaS2), where the state is stable at low temperatures. A hidden state of matter is not to be confused with hidden order, which exists in equilibrium, but is not immediately apparent or easily observed. Using ultrashort laser pulses impinging on solid state matter, the system may be knocked out of equilibrium so that not only are the individual subsystems out of equilibrium with each other but also internally. Under such conditions, new states of matter may be created which are not otherwise reachable under equilibrium, ergodic system evolution. Such states are usually unstable and decay very rapidly, typically in nanoseconds or less. The difficulty is in distinguishing a genuine hidden state from one which is simply out of thermal equilibrium. Probably the first instance of a photoinduced state is described for the organic molecular compound TTF-CA, which turns from neutral to ionic species as a result of excitation by laser pulses. However, a similar transformation is also possible by the application of pressure, so strictly speaking the photoinduced transition is not to a hidden state under the definition given in the introductory paragraph. A few further examples are given in ref. Photoexcitation has been shown to produce persistent states in vanadates and manganite materials, leading to filamentary paths of a modified charge ordered phase which is sustained by a passing current. Transient superconductivity was also reported in cuprates.  A photoexcited transition to an H state  A hypothetical schematic diagram for the transition to an H state by photo excitation is shown in the Figure (After ). An absorbed photon causes an electron from the ground state G to an excited state E (red arrow). State E rapidly relaxes via Frank-Condon relaxation to an intermediate locally reordered state I. Through interactions with others of its kind, this state collectively orders to form a macroscopically ordered metastable state H, further lowering its energy as a result. The new state has a broken symmetry with respect to the G or E state, and may also involve further relaxation compared to the I state. The barrier EB prevents state H from reverting to the ground state G. If the barrier is sufficiently large compared to thermal energy kBT, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, the H state can be stable indefinitely. A photo excited transition from a ground state to a hidden state typically involves two intermediate states  References  Category:Condensed matter physics Category:Engineering thermodynamics Category:Phases of matter ","title":"Hidden states of matter"},{"id":"42352877","text":"Bangor Teifi is a hamlet in the community of Llandyfriog, Ceredigion, Wales, which is 63.7 miles (102.5 km) from Cardiff and 184.7 miles (297.2 km) from London.

Since 2017 it has been represented by Plaid Cymru councillor Dorian Williams. Carmarthenshire County Council The first election to the new unitary Carmarthenshire County Council took place in 1995. Pam Palmer, who had represented the ward on the former Carmarthen District Council was elected with a large majority over the Plaid Cymru candidate. In 1999, Palmer was returned unopposed. Palmer faced opposition from Plaid Cymru and the Labour Party in 2004 but comfortably retained the seat. In 2008, faced only by a Plaid Cymru opponent, Palmer increased her vote significantly. At the 2012 election, Palmer was faced by an experienced Plaid Cymru candidate who had fought the Neath by-election in 1991. She was again returned but with a much- reduced majority. History =County Council Elections= Abergwili first became an electoral ward in the late nineteenth century with the formation of Carmarthenshire County Council and elected a member to that authority until its abolition in 1974. With the formation of Dyfed County Council, Abergwili was part of the Carmarthen Rural No.6 Ward. This ward was renamed Abergwili in 1989. This ward was considerably larger than the previous Abergwili ward and included Cynwyl Elfed, Bronwydd and Abernant. When the current Carmarthenshire County Council was formed in 1995 a ward based on similar boundaries to those in existence between 1889 and 1974 was re-established. =District Council Elections= From 1973 until 1996, Abergwili formed an electoral ward for the purposes of elections to Carmarthen District Council.

Early life  Kreisinger was born in New Jersey. In 2008, she received a B.A. in Communications & Women's Studies from Simmons College in Boston.  Career  = New media art = Kreisinger started to explore the idea of feminist remix of media as an undergraduate at Simmons College, with a focus on remixing the feminist narrative as it relates to identity. She interned at Cambridge Community TV, where she had access to equipment and video training. Kreisinger's videos remix Mad Men into feminists and The Real Housewives into lesbians. Her Mad Men trailers on Vimeo have had more viewership than the original series' YouTube trailers. Kreisinger's work explores feminist and queer-friendly perspectives through remix and mashup of mainstream media texts. The Queer Carrie Project recuts entire seasons of Sex and the City into short, 1-3 minute webisodes that portray its characters as lesbians. Most of Kreisinger's work uses the language and style of existing TV shows or Hollywood editing as a way to, as she describes it, \\"talk back\\" to pop culture. Kreisinger's work has been featured in online publications such as Salon and California Western School of Law's New Media Rights. = Digital = From 2012 to 2014, Kreisinger worked at Eileen Fisher in Communications.

Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. p. 47. ) is a contemporary visual artist known for paintings in which ambiguous race relations are depicted with a graphic clarity and cartoon strip format. Early life and education In her youth, Ali originally intended to be a lawyer or a doctor. Ali received her B.A. (English and Studio Art) from Williams College, Williamstown, MA in 1991. She participated in the Whitney Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City in 1992, and completed a residency at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Skowhegan, ME in 1993. Ali received her M.F.A. in 1994 from Washington University in St. Louis, MO. She lives and works in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and is currently a professor at Williams College. Work In Ali's earlier work, she would draw or paint something violent. She focused more on the action than the violence itself. In her current work, there is not a lot of focus on the act; she is more attentive to what happens before and after. The works are small scale gouache paintings and drawings on paper. She is known to prepare for many months, planning out every detail so there is no room for mistakes. Ali's work is based on life experiences. Although one may not be able to tell, she says all of her work holds meaning and that what's in her mind transcends from her hands on paper. About the performative nature of her work, Ali says, \\"The paintings can be like crude stages or sets, the figures like characters in a play. I think of them equally as characters and figures.\\" = The Greenheads Series = The subject of Ali's most well-known gouache paintings are the Greenheads ‚Äì characters designed to minimize or eliminate categorical differences of gender, height, age, and in some ways race.Ali, Laylah. \\"Interview.\\" Laylah Ali. By Rebecca Walker. The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, 2001. Ali created more than 80 of these paintings between 1996 and 2005. Ali drew on imagery and topics from newspapers, such as images of protest signs or world leaders hugging, but tweaked the stories in order to create something distant and new. Ali designed the characters and images to be specific and yet vague. They have meaning from Ali herself but the viewer brings their own references to interpret the image as well. Ali designed the characters to look human-like but not quite human so that they would be removed from our world and social context. They have a socio- political meaning yet they exist outside of our world. = Acephalous = Since 2015, Ali has been working on a series of paintings she calls Acephalous, featuring figures she describes as gender conscious, potentially sexual or sexualized, some of which have racial characteristics and some of which do not have heads. \\"They are on an endless, determined trek, a multi- part journey,\\" she says. \\"It has elements of a forced migration.\\" = Collaborations = Laylah Ali has collaborated with dancer/ choreographer Dean Moss at The Kitchen in 2005 with Figures on a Field and in 2014 with johnbrown. In 2002, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, commissioned Ali to create a wordless graphic novelette.  Collections  Ali‚Äôs works are included in the permanent collections of numerous public institutions, including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN, among many others.

It is located in Wayne, West Virginia. The abbot and confessor of the monastery is Archimandrite Seraphim. Holy Cross is a growing monastery consisting of more than two dozen monks, novices and candidates living a traditional monastic life of prayer and manual labor. There are 25 monastics in the brotherhood as of October, 2017, as well as several candidates and lay workers.  History  Holy Cross Monastery was founded in September 1986 by Hieromonk Kallistos (Pazalos) in House Springs, Missouri under the auspices of Bishop Tikhon (Fitzgerald) of San Francisco, Los Angeles and the West. Following the death of Hieromonk Kallistos in 1992, the monastery went under the spiritual guidance of the Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York. In 1999, brotherhood had doubled in size since founding, filling all cells of the monastery. At the time the monastery could not expand due to surrounding city development. In the summer of same year the continued growth of the surrounding city solved its own problem for the monastery, as the civil authorities required the building of a major highway through the monastery. An alternate piece of land in West Virginia was offered to the community. On May 25, 2000, the monastery moved to Wayne, West Virginia. On December 7, 2008, the monastery's spiritual father Archimandrite George was consecrated auxiliary bishop of Mayfield with his cathedra at Mayfield. In May 2009, Holy Cross received its independence from Holy Trinity Monastery, and Bishop George was elected as the abbot.http://www.synod.com/synod/eng2009/5enholycrosshermitage.html On April 13, 2015 Bishop George (Schaefer) of Mayfield was reassigned to Canberra in the Diocese of Australia & New Zealand. Before his departure, Bishop George elevated Igumen Seraphim (Voepel) to the rank of Archimandrite and installed him as the abbot of Holy Cross.

The actual elements of a game engine that can cause so-called \\"netcode issues\\" include, among other things, latency, lag compensation or the lack thereof, simulation errors, and network issues between the client and server that are completely out of the game's hands. Netcode as a term tends to be used only in the gaming community, as it is not recognized as an actual computer science term.  Potential causes of netcode issues  Latency is an unavoidable fact of online games, caused by not only network latency, which is largely out of a game's control, but also latency inherent in the way game simulations are run. There are several lag compensation methods used to disguise, reduce, or cope with latency, however their feasibility varies by application. A single update of a game simulation is known as a tick. The rate at which the simulation is run on a server is referred often to as the server's tickrate; this is essentially the server equivalent of a client's frame rate, absent any rendering system. Tickrate is limited by the length of time it takes to run the simulation, and is often intentionally limited further to reduce instability introduced by a fluctuating tickrate, and to reduce CPU and data transmission costs. A lower tickrate increases latency in the synchronization of the game simulation between the server and clients. Tickrate for games like first-person shooters can vary from 60 ticks per seconds for games like Quake or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in competitive mode to 30 ticks per seconds for games like Battlefield 4 and Titanfall. A lower tickrate also naturally reduces the precision of the simulation, which itself might cause problems if taken too far, or if the client and server simulations are running at significantly different rates. Games may limit the number of times per second that updates are sent to a particular client, and/or are sent about particular objects in the game's world. Because of limitations in the amount of bandwidth available, and the CPU time that's taken by network communication, some games prioritize certain critical communication while limiting the frequency and priority of less important information. As with the tickrate, this effectively increases the synchronization latency. Game engines may also reduce the precision of some values sent over the network to help with bandwidth use; this lack of precision may in some instances be noticeable. Various simulation synchronization errors between machines can also fall under the \\"netcode issues\\" blanket. These may include bugs which cause the simulation to proceed differently on one machine than on another, or which cause some things to not be communicated when the user perceives that they ought to be. Traditionally, real-time strategy games have used lock-step peer-to-peer networking models where it is assumed the simulation will run exactly the same on all clients; if, however, one client falls out of step for any reason, the desynchronization may compound and be unrecoverable. = Input delay and rollback networking = In order for an online game to function smoothly, player input must be received within a certain time for each frame (e.g. 16 ms at 60 FPS). However, due to inconsistent network conditions and physical distance between players, this may not be realized. Many games solve this using delay-based netcode, which allows for a buffer (e.g. 3 frames) within which input can be received. When input fails to be sent within this buffer, the game has to wait, causing freezes. Because this delay can be variable, this causes an inconsistent experience compared to offline play, and can affect player performance in timing-sensitive genres such as fighting games. An alternate solution, rollback networking, predicts remote player input instead of waiting (assuming the same input). When this prediction is correct, the game proceeds as-is. If the prediction was incorrect, the game state is reverted and gameplay continued from the corrected state, seen as a \\"jump\\". Most games utilize a hybrid solution, with a fixed input delay, and then rollback being used. Rollback requires the game engine to be able to turn back its state, so requires changes to existing engines. A library named GGPO also exists to help implement rollback. = Transport layer protocol and communication code = A game's choice of transport layer protocol can also affect perceived networking issues. Should the game use TCP, networking will have a high overhead cost and increased latency. Should it use UDP, the game engine may need to implement its own networking code to handle error conditions and other things that are handled by TCP; this increases the engine's complexity and might itself lead to issues.

Falcondale is represented in the Senedd by Elin Jones (Plaid Cymru) and the Member of Parliament is Ben Lake (Plaid Cymru).National Assembly for Wales website; recalled 24 February 2014 Located 59.3 miles (95.4 km) from Cardiff and 174.8 miles (281.3 km) from London. A single track road (the South Drive) can be found on the A475 from Lampeter towards Newcastle Emlyn and Cardigan. The road contains bungalows mostly built in the 1980s. A second single track road (The North Drive) can be found on the A482 from Lampeter to Aberaeron, where workers' cottages are, Home Farm and a coach house dating from 1859. Both drives meet in the centre where the main house is situated, also called Falcondale, which was grade II listed in November 1992. History There were three estates in and around Lampeter, Maesyfelin, Peterwell and Falcondale all having substantial houses. Only Falcondale (the youngest of the three) now exists. Maesyfelin was resided in from the 16th century by the Lloyd family. Sir Lucius Lloyd, High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1746, married Anne, daughter of Walter Lloyd of Peterwell. On his death in 1750 his estates were inherited by his widow's family. Only a few garden walls remain of this property, as stones from this house were used to remodel Peterwell House. Sir Herbert Lloyd, 1st Baronet, had remodelled Peterwell House with a rooftop garden and corner towers after 1755, but before his suicide in 1769. He left many debts and so the house remained empty and became derelict. It was firstly inherited by his nephew John Adams of Whitland Abbey, an MP in Carmarthenshire in 1774-1780, who amassed more debts and eventually sold the estate in 1776 to Albany Wallis the attorney who held the original mortgage. Peterwell Estate was sold to Richard Hart-Davies in 1807, who was a partner of Harford Bank in Bristol. John Scandrett Harford was a partner in the same bank and his son (also called John Scandrett Harford) married Richard Hart-Davies' daughter Louisa. John Scandrett Harford purchased the Peterwell estate from his father- in-law jointly with his younger brother in 1820. It was John Scandrett Harford's nephew John Battersby Harford who commissioned the architect Thomas Talbot Bury of London to build the Italian style villa that currently stands in Falcondale. Peterwell house became derelict and now only a few stones remain down a lime-lined driveway off the A475, a mile or so west of Lampeter. The house John Battersby Harford, 1846 In 1850 John Battersby-Harford married Mary von Bunsen, daughter of the Prussian ambassador to St. James's. He, and much of his family, spent time in Europe, especially in France and Italy; as testified in Alice Harford's Annals of the Harford Family. This could explain the Italian features seen at Falcondale. Once his training for the bar had ended he decided not to follow his Uncle into Harford bank, but \\"settle at Falcondale, and gradually to bring order out of the chaos into which the estate had sunk, and to provide decent houses and buildings for tenants\\". His letters of 1854 to his uncle explains his motivations which contain a hint of the Harford family's Quaker philanthropy. It is believed that John Battersby Harford built Falcondale on an older farmhouse building dating from 1820. An earlier building shows on the 1845 tithe map with a modest house and a service block near by. The name was changed to Falcondale from the original, loosely translated as \\"valley of the kestrel\\". Keystones above two of the entrances place the newer building at 1859. On being grade II listed in November 1992, it was described as an \\"Italian villa style on an unusually large scale; stuccoed with painted ashlar dressings and deep-eaved low-pitched hipped roofs. Big panelled stacks with corbelled and sometimes gabled caps\\". J. C. Harford Esquire In 1873 it is estimated that the estate had 8,399 acres in Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire. The estate passed to his son John Charles Harford in 1875 (pictured), followed by his son John Henry Harford. The estate was auctioned by Messers Knight, Franks & Rutley (largely to its tenants) in 1951, the main house of Falcondale being bought by the local council and turned into an old people's home. This lasted for 20 years, before the Smith family converted the building into the hotel we see today. Chris and Lisa Hutton (the present owners) bought the property in 2000 and have modernised where required, but the grandeur and architecture of the original building of 1859 mostly remains intact.

He and his brother took their first art lessons from his father. As a young boy, he was fascinated with the new Berlin Zoological Gardens and went there so often he was able to befriend Martin Lichtenstein, the zoo's founder, who allowed him into areas that were normally closed to the public. This experience led him to specialize in animal painting.German Wikisource: \\"Ein gl√ºcklicher K√ºnstler\\" (Article on Meyerheim from Die Gartenlaube, 1869) From 1857 to 1860 he attended the Prussian Academy of Arts. Later, he made several study trips to Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands and spent a year in Paris. In 1883, he established an animal painting class at the Academy. He was appointed a Professor there in 1887 and became a member of the Academic Senate. Meyerheim was a friend of the Borsig family, owners of the Borsig-Werke, a company that manufactured railroad locomotives. He produced many illustrations and designs especially for them. A major attraction at the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in 1912 was a series of seven huge images, painted on copper, that he had done for the Borsigs in 1873/76. The panels were called \\"Lebensgeschichte einer Lokomotive\\" (Life History of a Locomotive) and were originally intended for the garden loggia at their home in Alt-Moabit.

Today, Baratuciat is found almost exclusively in the province of Turin, particularly in the Susa Valley, where it is found in the villages of Almese, Buttigliera Alta, Rosta, Rubiana and Villar Dora. History Baratuciat grapes growing in a pergola. Unlike many Piemontese varieties, Baratuciat does not have a long history of wine production use in Piedmont with only written records in the twentieth and twenty-first century describing its use for both table grape and winemaking. Ampelographers believe that the name Baratuciat is derived from the term used in the local Piemontese dialect for the testicles of cats. Viticulture Baratuciat is a mid-ripening grape variety that can be very vigorous and prone to producing a large canopy and high yields if not kept in check by winter pruning, green harvesting and canopy management techniques throughout the growing season. The grape tends to be a high acid variety that lends itself well to balancing the sugars in the production of sweet, late-harvest dessert wines. Baratuciat berries tend to be small with very thick skins that are prone to infection by botrytis bunch rot. While for some grape varieties, such as Sauvignon blanc, Furmint and S√©millon, growing in some wine regions, such as Sauternes in Bordeaux and the Tokaj wine region of Hungary, the development of \\"noble rot\\" can be desirableJ.

However, ampelographers believe that the grape is almost exclusively grown in the Susa Valley located within the province of Turin. The villages of Almese, Buttigliera Alta, Rosta, Rubiana and Villar Dora have the most significant plantings of Baratuciat with one winery in Almese cultivating the grape on a commercial scale since the early 21st century. Wine critics are watching the development of plantings of the variety within the (currently) red wine only Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) of Valsusa, noting that the grape has \\"potential\\" in this region.Riccardo Modesti \\"Valsusa DOC, tra biodiversit√† e piccoli numeri \\" Wine Report (Italian), March 6th, 2003. Accessed: March 30th, 2014 A 2011 study by the University of Adelaide in Australia, documented of the grape variety being cultivated in 2010 which ranked it as the 1124th most cultivated wine grape variety in the world.Kym Anderson and Nanda R. Aryal \\"Which Winegrape Varieties are Grown where? A Global Empirical Picture\\" pg 40, University of Adelaide Press 2011. Accessed: March 30th, 2014 Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Baratuciat tends to produce very \\"Sauvignon blanc-like\\" wines with high levels of acidity and characteristic elder flower and \\"cat box\\" aromas. Like many white Italian wine varieties, the grape can also have some slight bitter notes on the finish. Throughout most of its history, the grape was mainly used as an eating variety on the table with some limited use for late harvest wines.

It aired on Fox in the United States on March 23, 2014. Plot Bob and Linda go out of town to a burger convention attended by Bob's online burger forum friends. Teddy volunteers to watch the kids when they cannot find a suitable sitter. While ordering them take out at Reggie's Deli, Tina becomes enamored with the delivery boy, Jonas. He gives her a ride back to the restaurant on his moped. Teddy, who bonds with Gene and Louise and encourages the kids to call him \\"Uncle Teddy\\", thinks this is unsafe. Jonas convinces Tina to let him and his friends hang out at Bob's Burgers after hours and get free food. When Teddy discovers Jonas and his friends in the restaurant, he kicks them out; Tina is embarrassed and angered. Jonas tells Tina to meet them at the lighthouse and to bring them more \\"free\\" burgers. Teddy grounds Tina, but she sneaks out to meet the boys at the lighthouse. Tina finds that Jonas' interests and habits are aggravating to her and to his friends. In an effort to appear \\"cool\\", Jonas suggests they break into the lighthouse. A police officer arrives just as Tina gets inside. Jonas flees but the officer catches the other boys. Tina tries to hide but her moans give her away and she is captured too. Meanwhile, Bob and Linda check into the hotel for the convention, and learn that the other attendees hate Bob. Due to his lack of experience in online communication, the others mistook his frequent jokes and posts to be insults. Bob tries to explain that he likes them and didn't intend for his posts to be insulting, but the other attendees snub him. Attempting to cheer him up, Linda suggests that they enjoy the hotel and its amenities together. However, the other attendees continue to harass them as they wait for their turn at the hot tub. When the attendees complain to the management, Bob and Linda retaliate by dumping mayonnaise and relish into the hot tub. They are kicked out of the hotel. After speaking to the deli owner, Teddy, Gene, and Louise go to the lighthouse and spot Tina in the back of the squad car. Teddy is able to negotiate with the officer and she is let go. Tina apologizes to Teddy and thanks him. They see Jonas sneaking back to get his moped, but Teddy is furious that Jonas had only been using Tina all this time and he throws Jonas' moped into the sea. Bob and Linda return early and call Teddy to let him know. Teddy plans to race back to the restaurant with the kids, but Bob and Linda spot him at the beach from their car. The kids cooperate with Teddy and go to bed to assuage their parents. Tina finally calls him \\"Uncle Teddy\\". Reception Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-, saying \\"The best moments come at the end of the episode, when Teddy loses his cool and throws Jonas‚Äô motorbike into the water. Teddy seamlessly transitions into the role of a concerned, protective guardian (and really earns the 'Uncle' title he's been gunning for) for Tina. Bob and Linda would‚Äôve given Tina a pep talk that makes her feel better, but Teddy's immediate go-to is to punish the boy who hurt her. It's funny and warm, like all of my favorite Bob‚Äôs Burgers episodes, and it's comforting knowing that Tina‚Äîand the rest of the Belcher kids‚Äîhave so many people who care about them.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.3 out of 10, saying \\"As rough as he is at the job of babysitting, it‚Äôs endearing to see him try to be a huge part of the Belchers‚Äô lives. Even after he rescues Tina from the park ranger, he tries to hurry the kids home to bed before their parents can find out, but alas, they all get caught. Here's hoping we see some more Teddy-centric episodes this season and next.\\" The episode received a 1.2 rating and was watched by a total of 2.45 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to American Dad!, The Simpsons, and Family Guy with 4.38 million.
