Previously, he was the SpyTalk columnist (and national security correspondent) at Newsweek, and before that, the SpyTalk blogger at The Washington Post. From 2002 to 2009, he was the founding editor of CQ/Homeland Security, and later national security editor at Congressional Quarterly, where he first launched his SpyTalk column. He had already covered the spy agencies and national policy topics for decades. He has also written three books and hundreds of news articles, opinion pieces and book reviews for a wide array of magazines and newspapers. He has also made numerous television and radio appearances. Biography Stein was born in Philadelphia but grew up in New England, moving with his family to Maine in 1954. After attending school in Providence, Rhode Island, he moved to Hingham, Massachusetts, where he graduated from high school in 1962. Following high school, he attended Boston University, earning a bachelor's degree in American history. Stein then attended the University of California, Berkeley, for a master's degree in China studies. He entered the U.S. Army in 1967 and served with U.S. Army Intelligence as a case officer from 1968 to 1969. While stationed in Vietnam, he was awarded a Bronze Star. Stein began his journalism career at a suburban Washington, D.C. weekly. He reported for NPR during its early years, while freelancing for major newspapers and magazines. In 1981, he briefly edited the Washington City Paper before founding his own paper, The Washington Weekly, which folded in 1984, after a year of publication. He then joined United Press International (UPI), rising to deputy foreign editor. During this period he also wrote his first book, The Vietnam Factbook, published in 1987. In 1992, Stein followed up with A Murder in Wartime, a book which detailed a Green Beret murder case that occurred during the Vietnam War. Time magazine lauded the book, calling it \\"...the best military morality tale since The Caine Mutiny... an exhaustively researched and heavily documented history of the Green Beret murder case.\\" In the 1990s, Stein began writing for Salon.com eventually becoming a national security correspondent and breaking one of its biggest stories, an expos√© of the secret ties between the Ringling Bros. Circus and a former CIA official, Clair George. In 2000, Stein teamed with Khidhir Hamza, a scientist who worked on Saddam Hussein's nuclear program before defecting in 1994, to write Saddam's Bombmaker. The book garnered widespread and enthusiastic reviews, including one from former chief of the National Security Agency, Gen. William E. Odom, who, in The Washington Post, called it \\"Not only stranger but frequently bloodier than fiction. The book should attract a wide range of readers, from foreign policy and security specialists to bored airplane passengers looking for a thriller.\\" In 2002, Congressional Quarterly hired Stein to launch and edit CQ/Homeland Security which was nominated for an award in its first year of existence. In 2005, Stein began writing a weekly column for CQ, entitled \\"SpyTalk\\", which evolved into a daily blog featuring original reporting and regular exclusives. In October 2006, Stein sparked an uproar when he reported in The New York Times that many top counter-terrorism officials and members of the House Intelligence Committee did not know the difference between Sunnis and Shiites. Two months later in his column, Stein got the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to reveal that he knew little about Al Qaeda and the Middle East. In April 2009, Stein, writing for CQ Politics, broke the story that Representative Jane Harman had been wiretapped discussing aid for AIPAC defendants. The scandal brought additional attention to the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy and implicated a number of other figures. In addition to his SpyTalk work, Stein continues to write op-ed pieces and book reviews for The New York Times and The Washington Post. Through the years, he has also written for a wide range of other publications, including Esquire, Vanity Fair, GQ, Playboy, The New Republic, The Nation and The Christian Science Monitor. He also appears on CBS, CNN, MSNBC, NPR and BBC, among others, to comment on U.S. national security issues. Personal life Stein resides in Northwest Washington, DC, in a restored Victorian era farmhouse. He is a member of both the Association of Former Intelligence Officers and Investigative Reporters and Editors.

It is the sixth installment in the Persona series, which is part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017, and was published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by Deep Silver in Europe and Australia. An enhanced version featuring new content, was released for the PlayStation 4 in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020. Persona 5 takes place in modern-day Tokyo and follows a high school student known by the pseudonym Joker who transfers to a new school after being falsely accused of assault and put on probation. Over the course of a school year, he and other students awaken to a special power, becoming a group of secret vigilantes known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as their Personas. The game incorporates role-playing and dungeon crawling elements alongside social simulation scenarios. Persona 5 was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer Katsura Hashino. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier Persona games included character designer Shigenori Soejima and music composer Shoji Meguro. Preparatory work began during the development of Persona 4, with full development beginning after the release of Catherine in 2011. First announced in 2013, Persona 5 was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolve around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by picaresque fiction, the party's Personas being based on outlaws and rebels from literature. Persona 5 was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation, art direction, gameplay, story, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. Including Royal, the game has sold over copies, making it the best-selling entry in the overall Megami Tensei franchise. Several other related media have also been released, including two spin-off games, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight and Persona 5 Scramble, as well as manga and anime adaptations. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.  Gameplay  Persona 5 is a role-playing video game where the player takes on the role of a male high school student, codenamed Joker, who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day Tokyo. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a social simulation game. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive buffing effects during battle. When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as Confidants; an evolution of the Social Link system from Persona 3 and Persona 4. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with party members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \\"Baton Pass\\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost. Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new items and equipment and boosting experience point and yen gain. Alongside the normal school life is dungeon crawling gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and a multi- layered, randomly-generated Dungeon called Mementos. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from non-playable characters (NPCs) received from a \\"Confidant\\" links. While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \\"Third Eye\\", which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \\"Security Level\\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The security level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight. Throughout Palaces are locations known as \\"Safe Rooms\\". In them, the player can save their game, heal their party, and fast travel to other safe rooms within the Palace. As with previous entries in the series, the game uses a turn-based combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack known as a \\"Ambush\\" and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and ranged weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks. If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn known as a \\"1 More\\". If all enemies are knocked down, a \\"Hold Up\\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \\"All-Out Attack\\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher. Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails. New Personas can be gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \\"fused\\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story. In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \\"Guillotine\\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \\"Hanging\\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \\"Electric Chair\\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \\"Solitary Confinement\\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength. Minor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \\"Thieves Guild\\" feature. Similar to the \\"Vox Populi\\" system from Persona 4 Golden, players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy. Synopsis =Setting and characters= Persona 5 takes place within the Persona universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche. Persona 5 is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \\"20XX\\" (2016), with navigable real-world locations within the city including Akihabara, Shinjuku and Shibuya. Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends. The second major location is the \\"Metaverse\\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \\"Palace\\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \\"Treasure\\" symbolic of their desires. Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in Persona 5, it takes the form of a prison. The player character is a silent protagonist, a commonplace feature in other Persona games, codenamed Joker. He becomes the leader of a vigilante group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse. He forms it together with school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto, fashion model Ann Takamaki and Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president Makoto Niijima, hikikomori computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura. Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine. Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, fortune teller Chihaya Mifune, shogi master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and model gun store owner Munehisa Iwai. =Plot= After the protagonist defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on probation, resulting in expulsion from his school. He is sent to Tokyo to stay with family friend Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \\"rehabilitate\\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads him into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. The protagonist meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \\"Treasure\\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. The protagonist assumes the codename Joker and, together with Morgana and his friends Ryuji and Ann, reforms Kamoshida. The group then forms the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city. As the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape, reach and ultimately defeat Shido. Despite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos, the Palace of everyone's hearts, and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure itself, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor that Joker has been seeing in the Velvet Room up until this point is Yaldabaoth, who imprisoned the real Igor. Yaldabaoth, the Holy Grail, was created from humanity's wish to give up control, and through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor. Joker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown. Royal In Persona 5 Royal, two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as Joker, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling Joker to a new Palace in Odaiba. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, Akechi turns himself over to Sae in Joker's place. At the beginning of the following year, Joker finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief has had their deepest wish granted. Joker, Akechi, and Kasumi investigate the Palace in Odaiba and learn that its owner is Maruki, who is also a Persona-user and able to alter reality. Through Yaldabaoth's influence, Maruki also controls Mementos, having usurped it from the Phantom Thieves after they confessed their desires to him during their counseling sessions. Maruki reveals that \\"Kasumi\\" is her little sister Sumire, impersonating her to cope with her death, and gives Joker time to choose whether to accept his idealized reality. Joker reminds the Phantom Thieves and Sumire of their real lives, and they agree to change Maruki's heart. In the beginning of February, Joker learns from Maruki that Akechi was brought back to reality out of Joker's desire to save him and that whether he continues to live depends on Joker accepting Maruki's world. Joker refuses his offer, and the Phantom Thieves defeat Maruki the following day. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing, Joker finds himself back in prison, but with the help of the Phantom Thieves and his Confidants, he is acquitted of his charges. On their final meeting after Joker's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their future. On the day he is due to return home, Joker escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki, who is now a taxi driver. At the station, Sumire finds him and bids him farewell. A post-credits scene achieved through certain game play requirements shows a person resembling Akechi passing by the window on Joker's train ride home. Development The game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the Persona series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of Persona 4, with full development beginning following the release of Catherine in 2011. Hashino was only fully involved in development after Catherine was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next Persona game's development. Development lasted five years. Persona 5 would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero. When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the Trauma Center series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with. While the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system. A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous Persona games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different. A returning feature from both earlier Persona games and the mainline Megami Tensei series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for Persona 5 was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \\"Hold Up\\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history. While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \\"institutions\\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments. Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers. While Catherine used the third-party Gamebryo game engine, Persona 5 used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game. The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware. Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning. The characters were originally rendered realistically like in Catherine, but the team felt that it was \\"wrong\\" for the Persona series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design. In contrast to Persona 4, which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for Persona 5 enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay. Persona 5 was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team. =Story and themes= The original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka. The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of Persona 3 and Persona 4, with \\"self- discovery\\" and \\"journey\\" being its keywords. Originally using the concept of a backpacking trip around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes. Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces. Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan. Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it. He wanted to make the game more \\"thematically approachable\\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of catharsis and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives. The narrative of Persona 5 was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly. As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel Water Margin, the Japanese crime movie Hakuchuu no Shikaku, and the Spanish novel Lazarillo de Tormes. Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a picaresque fiction; the team originally asked the question of how a character like Ars√®ne Lupin III might win appeal in modern society. This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment. Having a more \\"stereotypical\\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the Persona series. The series' recurring motif of \\"masks\\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well, and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts. The main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \\"no longer have a place where they belong in society\\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging. Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, Persona 5 would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \\"juvenile academics,\\" with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations. In contrast to previous Persona casts, the party of Persona 5 willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them. The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system. Technological advances such as smartphones and the use of social media were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals. The characters' initial Personas (Ars√®ne, Captain Kidd, Carmen, Zorro, Goemon, Johanna, Necronomicon, Milady, Robin Hood) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities. Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon Mephistopheles, but it was changed to Ars√®ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes. The cast's alternate Personas (Satanael, Seiten Taisei, Hecate, Mercurius, Kamu Susanoo, Anat, Prometheus, Astarte, Loki) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels. The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were Ars√®ne Lupin, The Fiend with Twenty Faces, and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon. The name of Joker's high school, \\"Shujin\\", was chosen because it was a homonym of , the Japanese word for \\"prisoner\\". Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. The use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in Persona 4. The relation to police activities was also carried over from Persona 4, but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed. Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan. The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole. In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions. =Art design= Shigenori Soejima, who had worked on the last two main-series Persona games, returned as character designer. The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the user interface (UI) displays. The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team. As the team considered previous Persona games to be \\"fun\\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience. According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while Persona 4 was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for Persona 5 came together. Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where Persona 4 left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development. Following the respective thematic coloring of Persona 3 and 4 blue and yellow, Persona 5 used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling. Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it. There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world. Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars√®ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style. The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations. When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \\"aggressively animated\\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style. Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu. The first character sketches were submitted in 2012. Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes. Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes. Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of Persona 5 revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \\"phantom thief\\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to sh≈çnen manga, but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the Persona series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others. The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character. The game's animated cutscenes were produced by Production I.G and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono. Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. Persona 5 was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by Sayo Yamamoto. The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in Yuri on Ice. The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \\"wild\\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage. =Music= The game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director Shoji Meguro. Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well. Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total. Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a jazz and soul music singer. Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \\"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\\". The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \\"Hoshi To Bokura To\\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori. To express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong acid jazz elements into the score. He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous Persona games, aiming to match the game's visuals. Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two Persona games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \\"do-la\\" syllable: the opening used \\"so la re mi\\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \\"do-la\\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo. A three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017. Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the Oricon charts with sales of over 29,000. The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and liner note artwork were designed by Soejima. In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion, was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle. The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on iTunes on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by iam8bit. Release Promotion of Persona 5 at the 2017 Taipei Game Show Persona 5 was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin- off games Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth, Persona 4: Dancing All Night, and the PlayStation 3 port of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3. During a Sony press conference in September 2014, it was announced that the game would also be released for the PlayStation 4, also announcing that it had been delayed into 2015. According to director Katsura Hashino, the game was delayed to fully develop for the PlayStation 4, and improve the general quality of the game for both versions. The game's first gameplay trailer was revealed during a special livestream on February 5, 2015. A Blu-ray Disc containing an exclusive trailer for the game was bundled with first print copies of Persona 4: Dancing All Night in Japan on June 25, 2015. The song used in the first gameplay trailer was an instrumental version of the main theme. During a special livestream for the game at the 2015 Tokyo Game Show, it was announced that the game would be delayed once again to late 2016. Speaking in a staff interview, Hashino apologized for the delay and stated that it was necessary to deliver a high-quality product without having to hold back in terms of content. In April 2016, Atlus launched an official countdown relating to the game that counted down to May 5, 2016. Shortly after, a special livestream was announced titled Take Tokyo Tower, which would coincide with the countdown date. During the Take Tokyo Tower livestream on that day, the release date for the game was revealed in a trailer shown during the livestream. The game was released in Japan on September 15, 2016. Along with the standard edition, a 20th Anniversary Edition was released, which features all downloadable content (DLC) based on Persona 3 and Persona 4, a five-CD best-of album set featuring music from all six main games in the series, and the official artbook for the game by Soejima. In honor of the game's Japanese release, the series-focused variety show Persona Stalker Club featured a new programming block titled Persona Stalker Club V. In promotion of the game in Japan, Atlus partnered with AKG Acoustics to release a limited edition wireless headphone based on the one Futaba wears in-game. The headphones came with box art designed by Soejima, as well as a music CD featuring two remixed tracks from the game by Meguro and Kozuka. Certain character apparel from the game were also made and released in Japan, such as jackets and tote bags. Following its release, character skins and additional Personas were released as paid downloadable content (DLC). The costumes included those incorporated into the 20th Anniversary Edition based on Persona 3 and Persona 4, in addition to new costumes based on the characters of Revelations: Persona, the Persona 2 duology (Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment), Shin Megami Tensei If..., Catherine, Shin Megami Tensei IV, Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army, Persona 4 Arena, and Dancing All Night. The costumes were accompanied by arranged battle music from each costume set's respective game, which replaces the default battle theme based on what costume Joker wears. The Personas were reskinned and original versions of key Personas from Persona 3 and Persona 4. In addition, PlayStation themes and avatar sets were released based on the central characters of Persona 5. An additional difficulty setting known as \\"Merciless\\" was also released as free DLC. Pre-order bonuses and its initial North American release date was announced a week before E3 2016. As with the Japanese release, the North American version was delayed so it would keep with other Persona games. In Europe and Australia, the game was published by Deep Silver. Initially planned for a Western release on February 14, 2017, the game was pushed back two months to April 4; the stated reason was that Atlus wanted the game to be at its highest possible quality. As with previous Persona games, the English localization was handled by Atlus USA and led by Yu Namba. According to Namba, the team began with a \\"blank slate\\" when choosing the English voice cast, as it was a new setting to earlier Persona games. Localizing Persona 5 was described by Namba as a massive project with the largest staff yet dedicated to the series. Namba, as project lead, made the final call on issues brought up by the team during the localization process. The localized script was estimated as being 50% bigger than that of Persona 4 Golden. The game's title also dropped the use of the \\"Shin Megami Tensei\\" moniker in English regions, which was used for Persona 3 and Persona 4. For the English release, the Japanese dub was made available as free DLC. Upon the game's worldwide release, Atlus published a set of guidelines for streaming footage of the game, noting that streamers who shared footage past a certain in-game date \\"[did] so at the risk of being issued a content ID claim or worse, a channel strike/account suspension\\". The guidelines were widely perceived as threatening, and were criticized by many in the games press and streaming community. About three weeks later, Atlus apologized for the tone of its original guidelines and revised its policy, extending the amount of the game that could be streamed considerably, though some critics continued to argue that even the revised streaming policy remained unfriendly to the game's fans and counterproductive to its success. =Persona 5 Royal= Persona 5 Royal, released in Japan as Persona 5: The Royal, is an enhanced version of the game for PlayStation 4, similar to Persona 4 Golden before it. This version features an additional Phantom Thief member named Kasumi Yoshizawa, a new Palace, new music, additional plot and social elements, a playable third semester, and support for the PlayStation 4 Pro, alongside many other changes and additions. Atlus had first teased the game as Persona 5 R in December 2018, with its full reveal in April 2019. It released in Japan on October 31, 2019, and worldwide on March 31, 2020. As with the original game, Domerica co- produced the anime cutscenes. Reception Persona 5 has been cited as one of the greatest role-playing games of all time, receiving \\"universal acclaim\\" according to review aggregator Metacritic. Famitsu gave it a positive review, with the game garnering a near-perfect score. PlayStation Official Magazine ‚Äì UK described the game as \\"an unabashed masterpiece\\". One of the aspects of the game that was highly praised was its graphical style and art direction. The quality of the game's English localization was one of the few aspects singled out for criticism, with Polygon describing it as \\"aggravatingly mediocre\\". Another was the game's treatment of LGBT topics. Kenneth Shepard noted in Paste that the only characters to exist outside of the game's thoroughly heteronormative setting are a \\"lecherous\\" gay couple who are treated as a joke, which led him to conclude that Persona 5 sees gay men \\"at best as a joke and at worst something revolting to be feared\\". These scenes were altered in the Western version of Persona 5 Royal. Famitsu praised Persona 5 Royal newer elements. Others in Japan expressed disappointment that the content could have been delivered as an expansion to the original game instead. IGN listed it as one of the best contemporary role-playing games. =Sales= The game received a boost to pre-order sales following the delayed release of Final Fantasy XV, which was originally scheduled for the same month as Persona 5. Sales went up on Amazon Japan by 450%, bringing the game to second place in their best- seller charts behind Tales of Berseria. In its first week of release, the PS4 version reached first place with sales of 264,793 copies, while the PS3 version reached second place with 72,974, resulting in total sales of 337,767 copies. This made Persona 5 the fastest-selling title in the series' history, surpassing Revelations: Persona, and together with Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 pushed sales of the PS4 up significantly over the previous week. It was later reported by Hashino that combined physical shipments and digital sales had reached over 550,000 copies by September 2016. Within three weeks of its launch in Japan, the game became Atlus' best-selling game in the country. , the original version of Persona 5 has sold an estimated 582,772 copies in Japan, including 517,827 physical and an estimated 64,945 digital sales. Outside of Japan, it was the biggest debut for any Persona game to date, with packaged sales five times better than Persona 4.IGN Japan (12.01.2017) On the PlayStation Network in April, the game topped the PS4 charts, and was third on the PS3, with Atlus announcing that it had shipped 1.5 million copies worldwide. By November 2017, that number had risen to over two million, which made it the best-selling game in the series. The success of Persona 5 contributed to increasing annual revenue for Sega, the owner of Atlus, in 2017. At the 2018 PlayStation Awards, it received the Platinum Prize for topping a million sales in Asia. The game's worldwide sales had risen to over 3.2 million copies by December 2019, not including the Royal edition. Persona 5 Royal shipped over 400,000 copies in Japan by December 2019. This brought total sales of Persona 5 and Royal to over copies worldwide by December 2019. In February 2020, Royal topped the Media Create sales charts in South Korea and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom, Royal debuted at number five on the sales chart. Royal had sold over 1.4 million copies by July 2020, bringing the total sales of Persona 5 and Royal to over . =Awards= Persona 5 won two awards in the Japanese 2016 PlayStation Awards.

Legacy Prior to the game's release, a standalone anime special titled Persona 5: the Animation -The Day Breakers- aired on Japanese television on September 3, 2016. Created by A-1 Pictures, The Day Breakers is set during the events of the game, being portrayed as a \\"sub event\\" separate from the main narrative. A manga adaptation by Hisato Murasaki began serialization online from September 15. Persona 5: the Animation, an anime television series based on the game's events, was produced by CloverWorks and began broadcast in April 2018.

The light station was established in 1829, and its present structures date to 1875. It was deactivated in 1933, but relit in 1951. The two-story wood keeper's house is now a private summer residence. The light is on continuously, showing white to the west and red to the east. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Hendricks Head Light Station on November 20, 1987. Description and history The town of Southport occupies an eponymous island on the Mid Coast of Maine, separating the Sheepscot River from the Boothbay Harbor. Hendricks Head is a peninsula extending southwest on the northern part of the island's western shore, and marks the westernmost point of the island. The lighthouse is located at the tip of the peninsula. The station includes a tower, keeper's house, fog bell tower, shed, and oil house. The tower is a tapered square- shingled wood-frame structure, topped by an octagonal lantern house. It was originally connected to the keeper's house via a covered walkway. The keeper's house is a T-shaped -story wood-frame building. The bell tower is a roughly pyramidal structure, with a central enclosed section housing the bell. The light station was established in 1829 to mark the mouth of the Sheepscot River, which provided access to the then-important shipbuilding and port center of Wiscasset. The original light station consisted of a keeper's house, built on a rubble foundation, with the lantern house mounted on top. The present tower and keeper's house were built in 1875, the house on the foundation of the previous building.

Early life Wales was born around 1734 to John and Sarah Wales and was baptised in Warmfield (near the West Yorkshire town of Wakefield) that year. As a youth, according to the historian John Cawte Beaglehole, Wales travelled south in the company of a Mr Holroyd, who became a plumber in the service of George III. By the mid-1760s, Wales was contributing to The Ladies' Diary. In 1765 he married Mary Green, sister of the astronomer Charles Green. In 1765, Wales was employed by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne as a computer, calculating ephemerides that could be used to establish the longitude of a ship, for Maskelyne's Nautical Almanac. 1769 transit of Venus and wintering at Hudson Bay As part of the plans of the Royal Society to make observations of the June 1769 transit of Venus, which would lead to an accurate determination of the astronomical unit (the distance between the Earth and the Sun), Wales and an assistant, Joseph Dymond, were sent to Prince of Wales Fort on Hudson Bay to observe the transit, with the pair being offered a reward of ¬£200 for a successful conclusion to their expedition. Other Royal Society expeditions associated with the 1769 transit were Cook's first voyage to the Pacific, with observations of the transit being made at Tahiti, and the expedition of Jeremiah Dixon and William Bayly to Norway. Due to winter pack ice making the journey impossible during the winter months, Wales and Dymond were obliged to begin their journey in the summer of 1768, setting sail on 23 June. Ironically, Wales when volunteering to make a journey to observe the transit, had requested that he be sent to a more hospitable location. The party arrived at Prince of Wales Fort in August 1768. Due to the scarcity of building materials at the chosen site, the party had to bring not only astronomical instruments, but the materials required for the construction of living quarters. On their arrival, the pair constructed two \\"Portable Observatories\\", which had been designed by the engineer John Smeaton. Construction work occupied the pair for a month and then they settled in for the long winter season. When the day of the transit, 3 June 1769, finally arrived, the pair were lucky to have a reasonably clear day and they were able to observe the transit at around local midday. However, the two astronomers' results for the time of first contact, when Venus first appeared to cross the disc of the Sun, differed by 11 seconds; the discrepancy was to prove a cause of upset for Wales. They were to stay in Canada for another three months before making the return voyage to England, thus becoming the first scientists to spend the winter at Hudson Bay. On his return, Wales was still upset by the difference in the observations and refused to present his findings to the Royal Society until March 1770; however, his report of the expedition, including the astronomical results as well as other climatic and botanical observations, met with approval and he was invited by James Cook to join his next expedition. Captain Cook's second circumnavigation voyage Wales and William Bayly were appointed by the Board of Longitude to accompany James Cook on his second voyage of 1772‚Äì75, with Wales accompanying Cook aboard the Resolution. Wales' brother-in-law Charles Green, had been the astronomer appointed by the Royal Society to observe the 1769 transit of Venus but had died during the return leg of Cook's first voyage. The primary objective of Wales and Bayly was to test Larcum Kendall's K1 chronometer, based on the H4 of John Harrison. Wales compiled a log book of the voyage, recording locations and conditions, the use and testing of the instruments entrusted to him, as well as making many observations of the people and places encountered on the voyage. Later life Following his return, Wales was commissioned in 1778 to write the official astronomical account of Cook's first voyage. Wales became Master of the Royal Mathematical School at Christ's Hospital and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1776. Amongst Wales' pupils at Christ's Hospital were Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Lamb. It has been suggested that Wales' accounts of his journeys might have influenced Coleridge when writing his poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The writer Leigh Hunt, another of Wales' pupils, remembered him as \\"a good man, of plain simple manners, with a heavy large person and a benign countenance\\". He was appointed as Secretary of the Board of Longitude in 1795, serving in that position until his death in 1798. He was nominated by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Earl Spencer, and his appointment confirmed 5 December 1795. Recognition of his work During his voyage of 1791‚Äì95, George Vancouver, who had studied astronomy under Wales as a midshipman on HMS Resolution during Cook's second circumnavigation, named Wales Point, a cape at the entrance to Portland Inlet on the coast of British Columbia, in honour of his tutor; the name was later applied to the nearby Wales Island by an official at the British Hydrographic Office. In his journal, Vancouver recorded his gratitude and indebtedness to Wales's tutelage \\"for that information which has enabled me to traverse and delineate these lonely regions.\\" Wales featured on a New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) postage stamp of 1974 commemorating the 200th anniversary of Cook's discovery of the islands. The asteroid 15045 Walesdymond, discovered in 1998, was named after Wales and Dymond.

It was established in 1854 as an aid to navigation for Vinalhaven's main port, and for the Hurricane Channel extending northwest from Heron's Neck. The light was automated in 1984. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Heron Neck Light Station on January 21, 1988. Description and history The town of Vinalhaven is primarily located on an eponymous island in the Fox Island group at the southern center of Penobscot Bay. The island is surrounded by smaller islands and ledges, and its town center and main port are located in Carver's Harbor, on Vinalhaven Island's south side. Southwest of Carver's Harbor lies Green's Island, one of the largest satellite islands. Heron Neck Light stands at the southernmost tip of Green's Island, on a projecting peninsula called Heron Neck. To the west of Green's Island is a channel separating it from a series of islets and ledges, the largest of which is Hurricane Island. The light station consists of the lighthouse, a connected keeper's house, an oil house, and a fog signal. These are all set on the exposed southern face of Heron Neck, with a boat landing on the more sheltered northern side of the peninsula. The tower is a circular brick structure, with a polygonal lantern house mounted on top, with an iron parapet and railing surrounding it. A covered passage joins the tower to the keeper's house, a 1-1/2 story L-shaped wood frame building. The oil house is a small stone structure with a gabled roof; it is a departure from most of Maine's oil houses, which are built out of brick. North of this complex stands the fog signal, a mid-20th century square hip-roofed building. The station was authorized in 1853 and went into service in 1854. The tower is original; the keeper's house was built in 1895-96 to replace the original brick house. At this time Vinalhaven was a fishing and agricultural community, but it saw significant growth in the late 19th century as a resort community and because of its granite quarries. Originally fitted with a fifth-order Fresnel lens, the light was automated in 1984.

Incumbent mayor Leslie Saunders was defeated by Nathan Phillips in a close contest. Toronto mayor Controller Leslie Saunders had been appointed mayor after the resignation of Allan Lamport, who left to work with the Toronto Transit Commission. He was challenged by Nathan Phillips, a longtime city councilor who had made a previous attempt to win the mayoralty. Phillips was Jewish, a sharp departure from the standard for Toronto mayors, who for decades had been Protestant Orange Order members. Phillips' religion was an important issue in the election. Saunders publicly proclaimed he was running as \\"Leslie Saunders, Protestant\\". Saunders was a leader of the Orange Order and the publisher of the radical monthly newspaper Protestant Action. His anti-Catholicism and proclamations that Toronto was a \\"Protestant city\\" had caused controversy in the past. One of his first acts after ascending to the mayoralty was to issue an official proclamation commemorating The Twelfth, the anniversary of the victory of William of Orange over the Irish. A second controversy arose during the election when Brown released accusation about room 1735 in the Royal York hotel. He argued that the room was a secret entertainment suite paid for by the city for the use of the mayor. Saunders claims that it was rented by Mayor Lamport and that he was totally unaware of the suite. Nonetheless the scandal hurt his reelection bid. Also running was former school board head Arthur Brown, who had previously come close to defeating Lamport for the job, and who had the support of the Globe and Mail newspaper.

It is one of the most species-rich groups within the family and it is distributed all over the Paleotropics. Description Spines on Canthium angustifolium Stylar head-complex of Vangueria dryadum Several different life forms are present in the tribe: most species are shrubs, but geofructices (plants with woody rhizomes) (e.g. Fadogia homblei, Pygmaeothamnus zeyheri), small trees (e.g. Vangueria infausta), and climbers (e.g. Keetia gueinzii) also occur. As all Rubiaceae species, the leaves are opposite, simple and entire, and they have interpetiolar stipules. The phyllotaxis is decussate, sometimes conspicuously so (e.g. Canthium inerme), and rarely whorled (e.g. Fadogia). Some species have spines (e.g. Canthium). Secondary pollen presentation is characteristic for the tribe and the species develop a conspicuous ‚Äústylar head‚Äù-complex, which is a structural unit consisting of a pollen presenting organ combined with stigmatic surfaces. Distribution and habitat The species of this tribe are found in the Paleotropics. Most genera and over 70% of the species occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Madagascar and the islands in the Western Indian Ocean. The remainder of the species is mostly found in Southeast Asia. A few species are restricted to islands in the Pacific Ocean, especially New Caledonia, and another fraction of the species occurs in the Eastern states of Australia, especially in coastal Queensland. The countries with the largest diversity with over a hundred species each are Tanzania, Madagascar and D.R.Congo. The tribe is characterized by a high degree of endemism. Several monotypic genera have a restricted distribution range: Eriosemopsis is found in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, Everistia occurs in the Eastern states of Australia, Perakanthus occurs in Peninsular Malaysia, and Temnocalyx is only found in southwestern Tanzania. Other larger genera with a restricted range are Cyclophyllum that is mainly found in New Caledonia, Peponidium that is only found on Madagascar or the Comoros, and Pyrostria of which most species are restricted to Madagascar. The tribe is a common and important constituent of many different kinds of habitats. Species of Vanguerieae are found in both extreme wet habitats, such as the rainforests of tropical Africa, and in the very dry desert-like areas of the horn of Africa and of the southernmost part of Madagascar. The tribe is found at elevations of over in the mountains of Malawi and Tanzania, but also at sea- level along the coast of South Africa. Ecology There is a wide range of flower sizes and fruit morphologies, suggesting different adaptations to pollination and dispersal. Most of the species are probably pollinated by insects, but it is suspected that at least some of the large-flowered species of Fadogia are bird-pollinated. The edibility of many fruits suggests that they are dispersed by animals. Almost 30% of the species within the tribe have a symbiosis with endophytic bacteria, which are found intercellularly within the leaves. The presence of these bacteria is consistent on a genus level and all species belong to the following 5 genera: Fadogia, Fadogiella, Globulostylis, Rytigynia, and Vangueria. The bacteria are identified as Burkholderia, which is a genus that is also found in the leaves of other Rubiaceae species. The hypothesis is that these endophytic bacteria provide chemical protection against insect herbivory. Uses Ripe fruit of Vangueria infausta Some species are consumed locally and fruits may be used as famine food. Examples are African medlar (Vangueria infausta) and Spanish tamarind (Vangueria madagascariensis), but the fruits of other Vangueria and Fadogia species are edible too. In West Africa, Vangueria agrestis (known under its old name Fadogia agrestis) is traditionally used as an aphrodisiac. It is known as bakin gagai (Hausa) or black aphrodisiac. Systematics =Taxonomy= The first genus of the tribe to be described was Canthium, containing the species C. coronatum (now Catunaregam spinosa in the Gardenieae tribe) and C. parviflorum (now C. coromandelicum). The second genus to be described was Psydrax, containing the species Psydrax dicoccos. Although the tribe is predominantly found in Africa, these first described species are Asiatic taxa. The first non-Asiatic taxa to be described were the genera Pyrostria and Vangueria, based on material collected on Western Indian Ocean islands. The first genus from continental Africa was Cuviera, with the species Cuviera acutiflora from Sierra Leone. Dumortier first mentioned a tribe Vanguerieae (as ‚ÄúVaugnerieae‚Äù) attributed to Achille Richard and put the genera Hamelia, Evosmia, Mitchella, ‚ÄúVaugneria‚Äù (Vangueria), and Nonatelia in it. However, this circumscription of the tribe was far from correct, as Canthium and Cuviera were put in different tribes and Psydrax and Pyrostria were not even mentioned. Also, the only genus that actually belongs in the tribe is Vangueria; the other genera belong elsewhere. At that time, authors often used the number of locules as a character for delimiting groups, but this is problematic for Vanguerieae as both 2-locular (e.g. Canthium) and 5-locular (e.g. Vangueria) ovaries occur in the tribe. The first monograph of the tribe was performed by Walter Robyns in 1928 and a total of 17 genera were allocated to the tribe. Although 9 new genera were described, this work was not entirely complete, e.g. Canthium, Cuviera, and Pyrostria were not treated. Since then, several new genera have been described or made synonym and more taxonomic adjustments on genus level will probably still be necessary. =Genera= Currently accepted names * Afrocanthium (Bridson) Lantz & B.Bremer (17 sp) * Bridsonia Verstraete & A.E.van Wyk (1 sp) * Bullockia (Bridson) Razafim., Lantz & B.Bremer (6 sp) * Canthium Lam.

Designed and built by Continental Motors/TCM, the Tiara series were commercially unsuccessful, costing the company millions of dollars. Design and development Continental began development of the Tiara series in 1965.Leyes, p.119 At the time, CAE, Continental Motor's turbine engine subsidiary, had developed the T65, a small turboshaft engine which was being considered by Bell for its new Model 206 helicopter. Faced with having to fund the production tooling for the T65 in order to keep the price reasonable, or funding the Tiara series, Continental's corporate management chose to invest in the Tiaras. While the Tiara series were basically traditional boxer engines, they did have some unique features.Gunston, p.191 The engines had high rotational speeds, 0.5:1 gearing was used to reduce propeller speed, with the camshaft forming an extension of the propeller shaft.Continental, Teledyne Continental Motors, TCM (US); Rolls-Royce (UK) Part 1: Introduction and O-110 through OL-300 The propeller shaft featured the Hydra-Torque drive to reduce the shaft's vibrations. The engines were available with four, six- and eight-cylinders. All were fuel-injected, with turbocharging being optional. The engines' fuel consumption was high, which became a disadvantage during the 1973 oil crisis era. In addition, the Tiaras' performance was not significantly improved over existing engines, making it difficult for aircraft manufacturers to justify the costs of certificating their products for the engines. These problems led Continental to finally discontinue the engines in 1980.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Indian Island Light Station on March 23, 1988. Description and history The town of Rockport is located on the western shore of Penobscot Bay in central Maine. Its harbor is sheltered by Beauchamp Point, a peninsula extending roughly southward. Indian Island is, at , the largest of a short chain of islands that extend south from the point. Indian Island Light is located at the southern tip of Indian Island. The station consists of a tower, keeper's house, shed, and oil house. The tower is a squat tapered square brick structure, surmounted by a square lantern house ringed by a catwalk and railing. A small workroom projects from the south side of the tower, sheltered by a gabled roof. The keeper's house is set just south of the tower; it is a 1-1/2 story structure, with the original 1850 brick block augmented by a frame addition. East of the tower is a large shed, consisting of two gable-roofed structures joined at a gable end; one is finished in board-and-batten siding, the other in shingles. Northwest of the tower stands a small brick oil house. The light station was authorized and established in 1850, and was the principal aid to navigation marking the entrance to Rockport harbor, which was then a major shipbuilding and lime rock processing center. The light was originally mounted on top of the keeper's house, with a fourth-order Fresnel lens installed in 1856. The light was deactivated in 1859 but restarted in 1861. In 1874-75 the present tower was built, with the oil house added in 1904. The property was sold by the United States Coast Guard in 1932, with the light deactivated in 1934. The light station is in private ownership.

A publication of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, the Crystal Ball was founded by political analyst Larry Sabato, the Robert Kent Gooch Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia. History =2002= The Crystal Ball was first launched in September 2002, evolving from pre-election presentations given by founder Larry J. Sabato. For the 2002 midterm elections, the Crystal Ball tracked every U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race and the top 50 U.S. House of Representatives races. In 2002, the website received 160,000 hits, averaging over 5,000 hits per day over the last three weeks of the campaign, with over 1,500 people subscribing to its weekly e-mail updates. =2004= Following a post-election hiatus, the Crystal Ball re-launched on January 27, 2003, to cover the 2004 election cycle. In addition to continuing its e-mail newsletter and website analysis, the Crystal Ball sent correspondents to both the Democratic National Convention in Boston and the Republican National Convention in New York City. On Election Day, the Crystal Ball correctly predicted 434 of the 435 U.S. House races (99.7%), 33 of 34 U.S. Senate races (97%), 10 of 11 governor's races (91%), and 48 of 50 states in the presidential Electoral College (96%). =2006= The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that the Crystal Ball \\"probably came closer than any other of the 10 top political predictors\\" on the 2006 election cycle. During the 2006 election cycle the Crystal Ball added House Race Editor Dave Wasserman and expanded its election coverage and analysis. The Crystal Ball correctly predicted a 29-seat pick-up for Democrats in the House and 6 seat pick-up in the Senate. =2008= In August 2007, the Crystal Ball added political analyst and author Rhodes Cook to its team, a veteran of Congressional Quarterly and editor of the America Votes series. Also in 2007, House Race Editor Dave Wasserman left to assume that same position at the Cook Political Report and was replaced by Isaac Wood. In July 2008, when many analysts were predicting a tight race for President, the Crystal Ball published an essay which correctly projected that Barack Obama would win in a near-landslide. In the elections of November 2008, the Crystal Ball correctly predicted 421 of 435 U.S. House races (97%), 34 of 35 U.S. Senate races (97%), and 11 of 11 gubernatorial races (100%). In the presidential election, the Crystal Ball predicted an Electoral College victory of 364 to 174 for Democrat Barack Obama, a total which was just one vote off of the final tally. =2010= In November 2010, Crystal Ball projected that Republicans would pick up 55 seats in the House of Representatives.2010 Election Special November 1, 2012 The Republicans picked up 63 House seats. It predicted a pickup of 8 seats in the Senate for Republicans.Election Eve Special November 1, 2010 The Republicans picked up 6 Senate seats.GOP picks up Senate seats but falls short of majority November 3, 2010 =2012= In 2012, Crystal Ball projected that Obama would win the presidency 290 electoral votes to 248 for Mitt Romney; there would be no change in composition of the Senate with Democrats at 53 and Republicans at 47; and Democrats would pick up 3 seats in the House of Representatives making it 239 Republicans and 196 Democrats. Actually, incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama won 332 electoral votes, to Republican challenger Mitt Romney's 206. In the Senate, the Democrats gained a net of two seats, leaving them with a total of 53 seats. The Republicans lost a net of two seats, ending with a total of 45 seats. The remaining two senators, both independents, caucused with the Democrats, leaving the majority party with a combined total of 55 seats. House Republicans retained a 234 to 201 seat majority. =2014= In 2014, the Crystal Ball predicted that Republicans would win control of the U.S. Senate and hold the House, while also retaining the majority of state governorships. However, they underestimated the magnitude of Republican victories, incorrectly calling the result in the North Carolina Senate race, where Republican Thom Tillis defeated Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan, and predicting that Republicans would pick up nine net House seats, when they actually gained thirteen. Additionally, they predicted that the Democrats would defeat incumbent Republican Governors in Florida, Kansas and Maine, while retaining their seats in Illinois and Maryland. Republicans ended up winning all five races, although the Crystal Ball correctly predicted the Republican gains of open Democratic-held governorships in Arkansas and Massachusetts, and the defeats of Republican incumbents Tom Corbett in Pennsylvania and Sean Parnell in Alaska. =2016= In the 2016 election, Crystal Ball projected that Democrat Hillary Clinton would win the presidency 322 electoral votes to 216 for Republican Donald Trump. They predicted a 50 - 50 senate, and for the Democrats to pick up 13 seats in the House of Representatives, making it 201 Democrats and 234 Republicans. It would turn out to be the most inaccurate prediction in the history of the Crystal Ball, with Sabato saying \\"Well, what can we say ‚Äî we blew it.\\" The Crystal Ball incorrectly predicted Hillary Clinton to win Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan, all states that they had predicted as leaning for Hillary Clinton, as well as Wisconsin, a state they had rated as even safer for Clinton, all predicting she would get 90 more electoral votes than she actually had pledged to her. They incorrectly predicted that Republican Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania would be defeated, which would have caused a 50-50 tie in the Senate when combined with the correct predictions of Democratic gains in Illinois and New Hampshire. Crystal Ball overestimated the number of the Democratic gains in the house, as they picked up 6 seats instead of 13. Additionally, they failed to predict Republicans retaining the governorship of Indiana and picking up the governorship of New Hampshire. They summarized by saying \\"...we were wrong. The Crystal Ball is shattered.\\" =2018= The Crystal Ball's success rate was much higher in the 2018 midterms; they correctly predicted the outcome of every U.S. Senate race, with the exception of Florida, where Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson narrowly lost to Republican Rick Scott. They slightly underestimated the number of Democratic gains in the U.S. House, as Democrats picked up a net of 40 seats, as opposed to the Crystal Ball's prediction of 34, while overestimating the number of governorships Democrats would gain, incorrectly predicting that Democrats would win Florida, Iowa and Ohio, while believing that Georgia would go to a runoff election. In fact, Republicans held all of the former three, and Republican candidate Brian Kemp narrowly won without a runoff in Georgia.

The bacteria are identified as Burkholderia, which is a genus that is also found in the leaves of other Rubiaceae species.

Libby Island Light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Libby Island Light Station on June 18, 1976. Description and history Libby Island Light is located on South Libby Island, one of two islands (collectively known as the Libby Islands) marking the southernmost approach to Machias Bay on the northeastern coast of Maine. The light station's principal feature is the lighthouse, an unpainted conical granite tower in height, with its base in diameter and its upper parapet in diameter. The tower is located on the southern shore of the island, with a fog signal house to its west. A boat landing is located on the northern shore of the island, and a small helipad is near its center. The light station was authorized in 1817, and its first tower was a wood frame structure that was blown down about 1822. The present tower was built in 1823, and a keeper's house added the following year. A fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed in the tower in 1855, and a fog signal and several outbuildings (like the keeper's house since demolished) were built the following year. The present fog signal house was built in 1884. The light was automated in 1974, and converted to solar power in 2000. The tower is now the property of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and is not open to the public.

History =Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815)= Another use of units of marksmen was during the Napoleonic Wars in the British Army. While most troops at that time used inaccurate smoothbore muskets, the British \\"Green Jackets\\" (named for their distinctive green uniforms) used the famous Baker rifle. Through the combination of a leather wad and tight grooves on the inside of the barrel (rifling), this weapon was far more accurate, though slower to load. These Riflemen were the elite of the British Army, and served at the forefront of any engagement, most often in skirmish formation, scouting out and delaying the enemy. Another term; \\"sharp shooter\\", was in use in British newspapers as early as 1801. In the Edinburgh Advertiser, 23 June 1801, can be found the following quote in a piece about the North British Militia; \\"This Regiment has several Field Pieces, and two companies of Sharp Shooters, which are very necessary in the modern \\"Stile of War\\".\\" The term appears even earlier, around 1781, in Continental Europe, translated from the German Scharfsch√ºtze. =U.S. Civil War (1861‚Äì1865)= During the American Civil War, sharpshooters saw limited action, as tacticians sought to avoid the heavy casualties inflicted through normal tactics, which involved close ranks of men at close ranges. The sharpshooters used by both sides in the Civil War were less used as snipers, and more as skirmishers and scouts. These elite troops were well equipped and trained, and placed at the front of any column to first engage the enemy. Their battlefield role could be misunderstood, too. At the Battle of Mine Run, one sharpshooter company was ordered to conduct a bayonet charge, even though they were equipped with rifles that were unable to take bayonets. Union Army Notable sharpshooter units of the Civil War included the 1st and 2nd United States Volunteer Sharpshooter Regiment (USVSR), composed of companies provided by numerous (primarily eastern) Union states. The U.S.V.S.R. were organized by Colonel Hiram Berdan, a self-made millionaire who was reputed to be the best rifle marksman in the nation at that time. There were also battalion size sharp shooter units including the Ohio Battalion Sharp Shooters, The First New York Battalion Sharp Shooters and the First Maine Battalion Sharp Shooters. There was also an all-Native American company of sharpshooters in the Army of the Potomac. These men, primarily Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi from northern Michigan, comprised the members of Company K of the 1st Regiment Michigan Volunteer Sharpshooters. In the Western Theater were the well known 66th Illinois Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Western Sharpshooters), originally known as \\"Birge's Western Sharpshooters\\" and later the \\"Western Sharpshooters-14th Missouri Volunteers\\". The regiment was raised by MG John C. Fremont at St. Louis' Benton Barracks as the Western Theater counterpart to Berdan's sharpshooters. Members were recruited from most of the Western states, predominantly Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Missouri. Competitive induction required candidates to place ten shots in a three-inch circle at 200 yards. They were initially armed with half-stock Plains Rifles built and procured by St. Louis custom gunmaker Horace (H.E.) Dimick. These \\"Dimick Rifles\\" (as they were known in the unit) were modified for military use by the installation of the Lawrence Patent Sight, and fired a special \\"Swiss-chasseur\\" minie ball selected by Horice Dimick for its ballistic accuracy. They were the only Federal unit completely armed with \\"sporting rifles\\". Beginning in the autumn of 1863 soldiers of the regiment began to reequip themselves with the new 16 shot, lever action Henry Repeating Rifle giving them a significant advantage in firepower over their opponents. Over 250 of the Western Sharpshooters purchased Henrys out of their own pocket, at an average price of forty dollars (over three months pay for a Private). Illinois Governor Richard Yates provided Henrys for some members of the 64th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment or Yates Sharpshooters and other soldiers of the unit appear to have similarly equipped themselves with Henry Rifles in 1864. Confederate Army On the Confederate side, sharpshooter units functioned as light infantry. Their duties included skirmishing and reconnaissance. Robert E. Rodes, colonel of the 5th Alabama Infantry Regiment, and later a major general, was a leader in the development of sharpshooter units. The Confederate States Army made more widespread use of sharpshooters than Federal forces, often having semi-permanent detachments at the regimental level and battalions of various size attached to larger formations. Dedicated sharpshooter units included the 1st Georgia Sharpshooter Battalion and three more from that state, the 9th (Pindall's) Battalion Missouri Sharpshooters as well as the sharpshooter battalions of the Army of Northern Virginia. Confederate sharpshooters were often less well equipped than Federal counterparts, often using the Enfield Rifled Musket or (the more uncommon) hexagonal bore British Whitworth rifles, rather than breech loading Berdan Sharps rifles. In his memoirs, Louis Leon detailed his service as a sharpshooter in the Fifty-Third North Carolina Regiment during the Civil War. As a sharpshooter, he volunteered as a skirmisher, served on picket duty, and engaged in considerable shooting practice. Of his company's original twelve sharpshooters, only he and one other were still alive after Gettysburg. As related by the regiment's commanding officer, Col. James Morehead, in a rare one-on-one encounter Pvt. Leon killed a Union sharpshooter, whom the Confederates identified as a \\"Canadian Indian\\".

A light station was first established at this site in 1846, and the present structure was built in 1876. It is one of the only iron lighthouses in the state, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Little River Light Station on March 14, 1988. The light station is now owned by the American Lighthouse Foundation, which offers overnight stays in the keeper's house, and occasional tours of the property. Description and history The Little River is an east-west tidal inlet on the coast of Down East Maine, with the town of Cutler on its northern bank. At the mouth of the inlet stands Little River Island, near whose easternmost point the lighthouse stands. The station consists of a tower, keeper's house, oilhouse, and boathouse. The tower is an iron structure, with a supporting frame of steel and brick. It is tall, with an octagonal lantern house surrounded by a metal balcony and railing. Entrance is gained via a projecting gable-roofed vestibule. The keeper's house is an L-shaped two-story wood frame structure, with a shed-roof ell across one side. The oilhouse is a small brick gable- roofed structure set a short way inland. The boathouse, a simple wood-frame structure, is located at the western end of the island, connected to the rest of the station by a wooden boardwalk. Little River Lighthouse, Cutler, ME The light station on Little River Island was authorized in 1846, and began operation the following year. The present tower was built in 1876 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the house was built in 1888, replacing an earlier stone structure. The boathouse dates to 1881, and the oilhouse was added in 1905. In 1916, the original 5th order Fresnel lens was upgraded to a 4th order. In the 1960s the Fresnel lens was removed and a DCB-10 rotating lens put in its place. The light was automated in 1975 when a modern 300mm optic was placed on a nearby steel skeleton tower. In 2001 the tower was leased to the American Lighthouse Foundation, which restored the tower, allowing the light to be displayed once again in the original lantern. A Vega revolving beacon was lit there on October 2, 2001 after 26 years of darkness in a ceremony attended by over 1000 people. Because the event was timed shortly after the events of 9-11, the relighting was noted as a \\"Beacon of Freedom to the World.\\" The keeper's house has since been fully restored and is available through for overnight stays. Periodic open houses of the property are offered during the summer months.

Incumbent mayor Allan Lamport won an unexpectedly close race against school board trustee Arthur Young. This election was the first for councils in the municipality of Metropolitan Toronto which would be created on January 1, 1954 and was composed of 14 municipalities: the City of Toronto, the towns of New Toronto, Mimico, Weston and Leaside; the villages of Long Branch, Swansea and Forest Hill, and the townships of Etobicoke, York, North York, East York, and Scarborough. A Metropolitan Toronto Council had come into being on April 15, 1953 and was made up of the Metro Chairman, Frederick Gardiner, who had been appointed by the province, the Mayor of Toronto, the City of Toronto's two most senior Controllers, nine senior aldermen from each of the City of Toronto (the top finisher in each ward), and the twelve suburban mayors and reeves.\\"Inaugural Meeting April 15 Large Sums To Be Needed For Services\\", The Globe and Mail (1936-2016); Toronto, Ont.

The final result ended up being closer than expected as Young, who had never run for or held citywide office, came within 10,000 votes. A central issue of the campaign was the introduction of rent control, which Lamport opposed and Young favoured.

In the north the average height declines to , and to in the south. Name Classically, this range was known as the Bargylus;Hackett, Horatio B.

The Greek \\"Bargylus\\" had its roots in the name of an ancient city-kingdom called Barga most probably located in the vicinity of the mountains; it was a city of the Eblaite Empire in the third millennium BC, and then a vassal kingdom of the Hittites, who named the mountain range after Barga. In the medieval period were known as the Jabal Bahra () after the Arab tribe of Bahra‚Äô. They are also sometimes known as the Nusayriyah Mountains or the Ansarieh mountains ( JibƒÅl an-Nu·π£ayriyah) or the Alawiyin Mountains ( JibƒÅl al-‚ÄòAlawƒ´yin); both of these names refer to the Alawi ethnoreligious group which has traditionally lived there, though the former term is based on an antiquated label for the community that is now considered insulting. Geography The western slopes catch moisture-laden winds from the Mediterranean Sea and are thus more fertile and more heavily populated than the eastern slopes. The Orontes River flows north alongside the range on its eastern verge in the Ghab valley, a longitudinal trench,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica ‚Äì Syria and then around the northern edge of the range to flow into the Mediterranean. South of Masyaf there is a large northeast-southwest strike-slip fault which separates An- Nusayriyah Mountain from the coastal Lebanon Mountains and the Anti-Lebanon Mountains of Lebanon, in a feature known as the Homs Gap. Between 1920 and 1936, the mountains formed parts of the eastern border of the Alawite State within the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon.

It is a third-line medication to metformin. It is used together with exercise and diet. It is not recommended in type 1 diabetes. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include vaginal yeast infections, nausea, constipation, and urinary tract infections. Serious side effects may include low blood sugar, Fournier's gangrene, leg amputation, kidney problems, high blood potassium, and low blood pressure. Diabetic ketoacidosis may occur despite nearly normal blood sugar levels. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. Canagliflozin is a sodium- glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. It works by increasing the amount of glucose lost in the urine. Canagliflozin was approved for medical use in the United States, in the European Union, and in Australia in 2013. In 2017, it was the 192nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions. Medical uses Canagliflozin is indicated to be used with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes; to reduce the risk of major heart-related events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in people with type 2 diabetes who have known heart disease; and to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, worsening of kidney function, heart-related death, and being hospitalized for heart failure in certain people with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease. Canagliflozin is an anti-diabetic medication used to improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. It is a third-line medication to metformin. Per the British National Formulary it is also less preferred than a sulfonylurea as of 2019, while the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes consider either a SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist a reasonable second line medication in those with heart disease. Canagliflozin decreases HbA1c levels by 0.77% to 1.16% when given by itself, in combination with metformin, in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, in combination with metformin and pioglitazone, or in combination with insulin, from initial HbA1c levels of 7.8% to 8.1%. When added to metformin, canagliflozin does not appear worse than sitagliptin or glimepiride in reducing HbA1c levels, while canagliflozin maybe better than sitagliptin and glimiperide in decreasing HbA1c. It is unclear whether or not it has any unique cardiovascular benefits beyond lowering blood sugar. Although canagliflozin produces beneficial effects on HDL cholesterol, it has also been shown to increase LDL cholesterol to produce no change in total cholesterol. Evidence shows that apart from positive effects on glycemic levels, canagliflozin also provides reduces the risk of heart attacks and heart failures. SGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliflozin, reduce the likelihood of hospitalization for congestive heart failure or progression of renal disease in persons with diabetes mellitus type 2 and reduce the likelihood of stroke and heart attack in persons with diabetes mellitus type 2 who have known atherosclerotic vascular disease.

Accessed April 5, 2017. * Patients on dialysis Adverse effects As with other SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin is associated with increased incidence of urinary tract infections, fungal infections of the genital area, thirst, elevations in LDL cholesterol, increased urination and episodes of low blood pressure. Rarely, use of canagliflozin is associated with necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, also called Fournier gangrene. There are concerns that it may also increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Possible cardiovascular problems are an ongoing issue with gliflozin drugs. The pre-specified endpoint for cardiovascular safety in the canagliflozin clinical development program was \\"Major Cardiovascular Events Plus\\", defined as the occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal strokes, or unstable angina leading to hospitalization. This endpoint occurred in more people in the placebo group (20.5%) than in the canagliflozin treated group (18.9%). Nonetheless, a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee expressed concern regarding the cardiovascular safety of canagliflozin. A greater number of cardiovascular events was observed during the first 30 days in study subjects who received canagliflozin (0.45%) compared those who received placebo (0.07%), suggesting an early period of increased cardiovascular risk. In addition, there was an increased risk of stroke in subjects who received canagliflozin. However, none of these effects were statistically significant. Additional cardiovascular safety data from another ongoing study are expected in 2015. On May 15, 2015, the FDA issued a warning that certain SGLT2 diabetes drugs, including canagliflozin, may lead to ketoacidosis, a condition where the body produces higher levels of ketone bodies. The FDA is continuing to investigate the issue, and cautions that patients should not stop taking canagliflozin without first talking to their doctor. On September 10, 2015, the FDA issued a drug safety communication for canagliflozin to address risks for bone fracture and decreased bone density. A label warning for fractures was already included in the Adverse Reactions section; however, the FDA made the addition to the Warnings and Precautions section to reflect new information from a placebo study. They advised that health care professionals should consider fracture risk factors before prescribing canagliflozin, and patients should disclose any bone fracture risk factors to their doctors, but that patients should not stop taking the medication without first talking to their doctor. On December 4, 2015, the FDA issued another safety communication for SGLT2 inhibitors, indicating that it would require new warnings to be added to the canagliflozin label about elevated blood acid levels and urinary tract infections. In June 2016, the FDA strengthened the warning about the risk of acute kidney injury for the type 2 diabetes medicines canagliflozin (Invokana, Invokamet) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga, Xigduo XR). A June 29, 2016, report on the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial for canagliflozin (CANVAS) revealed interim findings of new safety concerns including heightened risk of bone fracture that was found to increase with the duration of treatment. In May 2016, the FDA announced they were going to investigate a safety issue related to clinical trials that found an increase in leg and foot amputations, mostly affecting the toes, in people treated with the diabetes medicine canagliflozin (Invokana, Invokamet). In May 2017, the FDA concluded that canagliflozin causes an increased risk of leg and foot amputations. The FDA began requiring a boxed warning to be added to the canagliflozin drug labels to describe this risk. In August 2020, the FDA removed the requirement for the boxed warning. To lessen the risk of developing ketoacidosis (a serious condition in which the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones) after surgery, the FDA approved changes to the prescribing information for SGLT2 inhibitor diabetes medicines to recommend they be stopped temporarily before scheduled surgery. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should each be stopped at least three days before, and ertugliflozin should be stopped at least four days before scheduled surgery. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and trouble breathing. Interactions The drug may increase the risk of dehydration in combination with diuretic drugs. Because it increases renal excretion of glucose, treatment with canagliflozin prevents renal reabsorption of 1,5-anhydroglucitol, leading to artifactual decreases in serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol. Therefore, canagliflozin can interfere with the use of serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (assay trade name, GlycoMark) as a measure of postprandial glucose levels. Dosing adjustment is also required for concomitant therapy with UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) inducers such as rifampin, phenytoin, or phenobarbital, ritonavir. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Canagliflozin is an inhibitor of subtype 2 sodium- glucose transport proteins (SGLT2), which is responsible for at least 90% of renal glucose reabsorption (the remaining 10% is done by SGLT1). Blocking this transporter causes up to 119 grams of blood glucose per day to be eliminated through the urine, corresponding to 476 kilocalories. Additional water is eliminated by osmotic diuresis, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure. This mechanism is associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia (too low blood glucose) compared to other types of anti-diabetic drugs such as sulfonylurea derivatives and insulin. =Pharmacokinetics= When taken by mouth, canagliflozin reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after one to two hours and has an absolute bioavailability of 65%, independently of food intake. When in the bloodstream, 99% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. It is metabolized mainly by O-glucuronidation via the enzymes UGT1A9 and UGT2B4, and by hydroxylation to a lesser extent. The terminal half life is 10.6 hours for a 100 mg dose and 13.1 hours for a 300 mg dose, with 43% being excreted in the faeces (mostly in unchanged form) and 33% in the urine (mostly as glucuronide).Drugs.com: Canagliflozin . History It was developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma and is marketed under license by Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson. On July 4, 2011, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a paediatric investigation plan and granted both a deferral and a waiver for canagliflozin (EMEA-001030-PIP01-10) in accordance with EC Regulation No.1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the council. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2013. Canagliflozin was approved by the FDA on March 29, 2013, and became the first SGLT2 inhibitor in the United States. Canagliflozin was approved for medical use in Australia in September 2013.

The southern terminus of PA 147 in West Chillisquaque Township near the borough of Milton. The route heads northward along the West Branch Susquehanna River through Milton, Watsontown and Muncy until entering Hughesville, where it terminates at an intersection with U.S. Route 220 (US 220). PA 405 originated as the Muncy and Hughesville Plank Road, a plank road from Muncy to Hughesville, created in 1853. The plank road also consisted of a bridge over the Muncy Canal on the outskirts of the community. PA 405 was assigned in 1941, after switching between numerous designations, including alignments of US 15, US 111, US 220, and US 711\\\\. The alignment of PA 405 was extended to its current southern terminus when PA 147 was realigned onto a new highway. As part of the Central Susquehanna Valley Transportation Project, PA 405 will continue south from its current southern terminus, replacing the stretch of PA 147 until its junction with PA 61 in Sunbury, its new southern terminus. PA 147 will have a new alignment between those two junctions and will not be duplexed with PA 405 at any point.  Route description  = PA 147 to Watsontown = PA 405 north in West Chillisquaque Township, Northumberland County The stretch of PA 44 and PA 405 through Watsontown PA 405 begins at an intersection with PA 147 in Chillisquaque. The route heads to the northwest, heading along a parallel to PA 147 near rural farms and houses. The route reaches the center of Chillisquaque, where it turns westward for a distance through an isolated area along the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. The route meets the shoreline, where PA 405 turns to the northwest along a rural, unpopulated stretch of West Chillisquaque Township. The route heads northward, crossing through a deep patch of forests. A short distance later, the forests dissipate, and PA 405 intersects with PA 45 (the Purple Heart Highway) just across the river from the borough of Lewisburg. PA 405 continues northward along the Susquehanna River, intersecting with a former alignment of PA 45 a short distance later. The route continues through the rural farmland along the river, entering the small community of East Lewisburg. North of East Lewisburg, PA 405 passes a large farmland plot before leaving the shoreline of the Susquehanna West Branch. The route continues northward a short distance from the Susquehanna River before entering the borough of Milton. In Milton, PA 405 crosses over a set of railroad tracks and turns onto Ferry Lane. The route heads eastward until turning northward onto Garfield Street, heading past homes and businesses and intersecting with PA 642 (Mahoning Street). The route continues northward onto South Arch Street, intersecting with Center Street, where it turns northward. At the end of the block, PA 405 intersects with PA 254 (Broadway). The highway continues northward, intersecting with local streets and paralleling railroad tracks. At the intersection with 10th Street, PA 405 turns to the northwest and leaves the community of Milton. The route returns to the shoreline of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River, continuing northward along the Turbot Hills Golf Course. The route continues northward, intersecting with Golf Course Road, where the route becomes surrounded by forests. A short distance later, PA 405 crosses under the four lane alignment of Interstate 80 (I-80) and intersects an old alignment of the Susquehanna Trail. The route continues northward along the West Branch of the Susquehanna River, passing a large industrial complex before reaching a merge in the railroad tracks. At the merge, PA 405 enters the borough of Watsontown. = Watsontown to Hughesville = PA 405 heading through the community of Muncy After entering Watsontown, PA 405 passes the local memorial park and intersects with PA 44 (South Main Street). PA 405 and PA 44 become concurrent along Main Street into downtown Watsontown. The two highways continue several blocks from the Susquehanna River, intersecting with Brimmer Avenue. The surroundings of the highways are highly populated, and the two routes continue in Watsontown until an intersection with East 11th Street, when the two roads leave the community. PA 405 and PA 44 continue northward, intersecting with local roads in a rural region north of Watsontown. The highways continue, entering the community of Dewart, where PA 44 turns to the west towards the Susquehanna West Branch. PA 405 continues northward, bypassing around Dewart and crossing the railroad tracks it had been paralleling for the distance. The route continues northward, leaving Dewart at an intersection with Delaware Drive. The route heads northward, crossing through the rural areas before intersecting with PA 54, where they merge. PA 405 and PA 54 continue through a deep patch of forests before crossing the river, entering the borough of Montgomery. PA 405 at the intersection with the western terminus of PA 118 in Hughesville In Montgomery, PA 405 and PA 54 continue for a short distance along Second Street, until Montgomery Street, where PA 405 turns to the northeast, while PA 54 turns to the northwest. PA 405 continues along Montgomery Street, passing through downtown. At an intersection with School House Road, the highway leaves Montgomery. PA 405 continues to the northeast along a set of railroad tracks and at an intersection with Saegers Station Road, enters the community of Saegers. At a merge with Private 158 Road, PA 405 turns to the north, passing the small community to the north. At an intersection with Armstrong Road, the highway turns to the northeast, leaving Saegers. The route continues to the east, crossing over the West Branch once again, entering the borough of Muncy. In Muncy, the highway heads to the southeast along Water Street into the community center, where it turns to the northeast. The route leaves Muncy a short distance later, interchanging with I-180 Exit 13. PA 405 passes south of a park and ride lot and heads to the northeast until reaching Muncy Creek, where it turns to the southeast, intersecting with the western terminus of PA 442\\\\. PA 405 continues farther, intersecting with local roads, running along South Main Street for a distance, entering the borough of Hughesville, where the highway becomes densely populated. The route heads northward, intersecting with the western terminus of PA 118\\\\. The route continues northward for a short distance, with the Route 405 designation terminating at an intersection with US 220.  History  The Fence Drive-In, a landmark along PA 405 = Old roads = The short alignment of PA 405 from Muncy to Hughesville contains the most of the highway's history. The bridge over the West Branch of the Susquehanna River was originally privately maintained, with the charter for its construction coming down from the Pennsylvania State Legislature on March 13, 1835. The charter designated the company that owned the bridge as the Susquehanna Bridge Company at Walton's Landing (now Muncy) and the state appointed eleven commissioners to help erect the toll bridge. In 1853, a portion of land from the Susquehanna River West Branch (which was a canal at the time) was chartered to become a canal. The canal was constructed in 1848 by a privately maintained company for $3,000 (1848 USD). The bridge over the canal that currently uses PA 405 was constructed in 1854 at a cost of $27,000 (1854 USD), nine times the amount to construct the canal. The portion of PA 405 from Muncy to Hughesville was also chartered in 1853, consisting of a plank road between the two towns. = Designation = US 711 was signed on a small piece of PA 405 from 1926 to 1928. On May 31, 1911, the state of Pennsylvania signed the Sproul Road Bill, which started a drastic state takeover of highways. Originally, only several routes were assigned around the state. The stretch of PA 405 from the southern terminus to the current day intersection with PA 44 was designated as Legislative Route 18. The portion of PA 405 along the PA 44 concurrency to Delwart was designated as Legislative Route 240 (most of this alignment is PA 44). The stretch from Delwart to Montgomery was not designated in 1911. From Montgomery to Muncy, PA 405 follows more of Legislative Route 240. After Muncy, PA 405 follows Legislative Route 19 until the current terminus in Hughesville. When the switch was made in 1924 from the old highway system in Pennsylvania, the alignment of PA 405 was designated as PA 4 from the community of Chillisquaque to the intersection with the Susquehanna Trail. PA 4 was designated in 1925 along the main alignment of the Susquehanna Trail. The route designation remained in place for a short time. The stretch from Muncy to Hughesville (which followed the alignment of the Penn's Plank Road), was designated in 1926 as an alignment of US 220. The portion of PA 4 from Chillisquaque to the Susquehanna trail was also designated as US 111 and US 711, both decommissioned spurs of US 11 in 1926. US 111 remained in place until 1936, while US 711 and PA 4 were decommissioned in 1928 and 1930 respectively. In 1928, the segment of PA 4 from Watsontown to Muncy was re- designated as PA 14. In 1936, US 111 was decommissioned, and the route from Chillisquaque to Watsontown was redesignated as part of US 15. PA 14, US 220 and US 15 remained on most of PA 405's alignment until 1941, when the alignment of all three routes were changed. Upon the decommissioning, PA 405 was designated onto the alignment from the Susquehanna Trail (where it intersected with PA 147) to Hughesville. The alignment of PA 405 south of the Susquehanna Trail was part of PA 147 until 1972, when it was realigned, and PA 405 was extended to Chillisquaque. = Proposed extension = PA 405 currently has its southern terminus at PA 147 in the community of Chillisquaque. Near that intersection, PA 147 turns into a super-2 freeway towards Williamsport. The Central Susquehanna Valley Transportation Project is proposing to extend the super-two freeway alignment of PA 147 on a new freeway along the opposite side of the Susquehanna. The designation of PA 405 is proposed to be extended over the non-freeway alignment of PA 147 down to an intersection with PA 61 in Sunbury. An interchange with PA 405 would also be constructed. The long project will also involve a realignment of US 11/US 15 onto the new alignment as well, a proposal that lost funding in the 1970s. As of July 2009, the design is 40% completed, while the project was put on a freeze by Governor Edward Rendell. The project, which will take $9 million (2009 USD) to study and design, and another $525 million (2009 USD) to construct.

The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Lubec Channel Light Station on March 14, 1988. The lighthouse was sold by auction into private hands on 2007. Description and history The town of Lubec is located in far eastern Maine, standing across the international border from Canada's Campobello Island. The Lubec Narrows passes between the two, which are joined by the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge. South of the bridge lies a shallow bay, which opens into the Gulf of Maine after passing West Quoddy Head Light. In the 1880s a channel was dredged through the shallows to facilitate seagoing commerce from the port communities of Lubec, Eastport and Calais. An 1883 report recommended installation of a light on the channel to aid navigation, funding was authorized in 1888, and the light went into operation in 1890. It was automated in 1939. The light is set to on the west side of the channel, and is mounted on a concrete foundation set in the muddy channel bottom. Its lower stage is a cast-iron round base, which flares out to support a wide deck. Originally sheltered by a shed roof, this deck is now exposed. The tower's second stage rises above, with a railing around its top, and a narrow third stage which supports the lantern house, also surrounded by a deck and railing. The lantern house is crowned by a spherical ventilator. The lantern stands above Mean High Water.

It is located between the Southend Arterial Road (A127 road) and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. It is usually known as Dunton. Name The name Dunton has Saxon origins (\\"dun\\" meaning hill and \\"tun\\" meaning town). Wayletts is also derived from the Saxon (\\"Weylete\\") and Old English (\\"Weg-gelaetu\\") both meaning a place where ways or roads meet.Portrait of Dunton the Lost Village by Ivy Titchen and Sheila Mountfield (1988) History The earliest reference to Dunton is found in the Domesday Book of 1086 when 'Dantona' was held by Bishop Ode (half brother of William the Conqueror). During the Middle Ages, the parish of Dunton was divided into two manors: Dunton Hall and Fryern Manor. In the 12th century Dunton came under the ownership of the Abbey of Bec-Hellouin. In the 1440s the manor of Dunton was granted to King's College, Cambridge. The manor of Dunton remained in the possession of King's College until well into the 18th century.Portrait of Dunton the Lost Village In 1801 the population of Dunton was 121. In 1837 the Parish of Dunton comprised 2,000 acres of land out of which 1,719 was cultivated land, 222 acres meadow pasture, 37 acres woodland, 22 acres was common land and 17 acres belonging to the Rector. In the 1841 census the population of Dunton was 194.'Portrait of Dunton the Lost Village' In 1871 Dunton had 33 houses with a population of 174. In 1967 the Ford Motor Company opened the Dunton Technical Centre on former agricultural land at the north end of Dunton. Dunton's amenities declined during the 1970s. The village school closed in 1977 and the one village shop closed a year later. Buildings Friern Manor, to the north of Lower Dunton Road, was built in the 18th century. It was owned by the governors of St Bartholomew's Hospital in the 19th century. During the 1930s it was owned by the parents of Holocaust denier David Irving. It is now used as a wedding venue.http://www.stnicholaslaindon.co.uk/Mag/Images/Mags%202009/April2009IWeb.pdf Dunton Wayletts Farm is a Grade II listed building, a timber-framed and plastered farmhouse built in the 16th century, probably on the site of a much earlier building. It is now owned by the Highways Agency / Department for Transport. Upper Dunton Hall (now Dunton Hall) and Lower Dunton Hall were owned by Kings College, Cambridge. Dunton Hall was built in the 18th century and is a Grade II listed former farmhouse. The building was converted to a private dwelling following the closure of the farm. The Old Rectory is a substantial Victorian house built in the mid-19th century which originally served as the rectory of St Mary's Church, until a new rectory was built in the 1930s. In 1934 the Old Rectory was bought by journalist Charles Leatherland, who lived there for fifteen years; when he received a life peerage in 1964, he took the title Baron Leatherland of Dunton. Charles Leatherland also bought the former Dunton School building. In 1987 the Old Rectory became a restaurant and is now used as a country house hotel and wedding venue. Rose Cottage and Ivy Cottage are small 18th-century Grade II listed timber-framed and plastered cottages in Dunton Road, weatherboarded on the front. Southfields Farm was an early 18th-century farmhouse. It was destroyed by fire in the early 1960s, and the land was bought by the Ford Motor Company as part of the site of their Dunton Technical Centre. =St Mary's Church= The parish church of St. Mary the Virgin has medieval origins. It was rebuilt in 1873 at a cost of ¬£950, except for a part of the north wall of the chancel which is of 16th-century brick and a 15th-century truss. St Mary's stands on the site of a medieval church or priory. In 1923 the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England cited evidence of its medieval origins including a 13th-century font, a 13th-century stone coffin in the churchyard, a cup dating from 1563, a date stone of 1686, a 17th-century table in the vestry, and a church bell dating from 1712. By the 1950s St Mary's was in a poor structural condition caused by subsidence. The condition of the church had been causing concern for many years and in 1968 the Lay Commission on Churches advised it be pulled down. In 1978 the former Dunton parish was now united with Laindon and the church closed to services and became a chapel of ease (a church building other than the main church) before the Church Commissioners applied to have it declared redundant which was granted in 1980. After closure, the building and churchyard was left to the mercy of the elements and vandals. The Church Commissioners recommended it become a private residence, and the building was sold in 1985. Following the sale the church was restored for use as a private residence which it remains to this day. There are still a few gravestones remaining from the former churchyard adjacent to the house. St. Nicholas Church in Laindon now serves the parish of Laindon with Dunton. =Schools= Dunton's first known school was a dame school which opened in 1836. In 1843 a National School was built in Lower Dunton Road on a site granted by King's College, Cambridge. The school had two rooms to accommodate some fifty children. In 1929 Dunton School was sold by Essex County Council and became a private dwelling. During the Second World War, the Home Guard occupied the building. After the war a new council school was built partly to accommodate the growing number of children from the new Dunton Plotlands estate. The school closed in 1977 due to declining attendance. =Dunton Poor Law labour colony= In 1904 the Poplar Board of Guardians acquired Sumpners Farm, Dunton as a 130-acre labour colony for 110 men who were transferred from Poplar Workhouse in East London. This was the first Poor Law labour colony in England. It closed in 1935. Dunton Plotlands The Dunton Plotlands were smallholdings which became popular with East Enders moving out of London. Much of the Plotlands area was compulsorily purchased for the Southfields Industrial Estate.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Monhegan Island Lighthouse and Quarters on May 7, 1980, reference number 80000239. Description and history Monhegan Island Light stands on a hill near the center of Monhegan Island. The lighthouse complex includes the tower, keeper's house, storage building, and oil house. The tower is a circular structure built out granite blocks with sloping walls, and is tall, with the lantern house mounted on top. A brick entry house, with gabled roof, is attached to the south side of the tower. The storage building is a single-story wood frame structure, and the oil house is a small brick structure with a gabled roof. The keeper's house, now serving as the Monhegan Museum, is a 1-1/2 story wood frame building. The light station was authorized by Congress in 1822, and went into operation in 1824; the present tower dates to 1850. The light was automated in 1959, and is managed by remote control from the Manana Island Sound Signal Station. (The latter station was administratively managed as part of the Monhegan Light Station from 1850 to 1874, and has been under separate administration since.)

Redmond was founded in Spring of 1985 as the south campus of Etobicoke's first Catholic high school, Michael Power/St. Joseph High School, merged in 1982 and then became a separate, standard high school in 1986. The Regional Arts Program has since started in 2006. The school was named after Father John Redmond C.S.B. (1934-September 21, 1981), a teacher, coach, educator, priest, and principal of Michael Power. History =Origins= Father John Redmond C.S.B. was born in Weston, Ontario in 1934 and aspired to helping others all his life. He was a faithful priest, dedicated teacher and accomplished coach.http://www.etobicokesports.ca/1999/redmond_john.htm Educated in Toronto at St. Michael's College School and later University of Windsor, Father Redmond was ordained a Basilian priest in 1963. His entire professional teaching career, which spanned from 1963 to his death on September 21, 1981, revolved around Michael Power Catholic High School. He was the school's athletic director for thirteen years, principal from 1976 to 1981, and nineteen years as a teacher. He helped develop thousands of Etobicoke teenagers into responsible adults through his example of a Christian life and through the discipline of sport. Under Redmond's tutelage, Power won fifteen Toronto and District College School Athletic Association Track Championships and, provincially, nine out of ten Ontario Federation of Secondary Schools Association Crowns. In 1976, an American reporter wrote that the Power track team won a US invitational meet over 243 schools \\"handily\\". Redmond was inducted into the Etobicoke Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. =Background= The original home of Father John Redmond from 1985-2006. During a period of reorganization by public school boards across Ontario following a decision by the Ontario Government to extend funding of Catholic schools to include secondary school grades 10 to 13 (OAC) in the 1980s, many public schools of the Etobicoke Board of Education in southern Etobicoke with low enrollment were ceded to the Metropolitan Separate School Board (later the Toronto Catholic District School Board). Originally offered the former Mimico High School (now John English Junior Middle School), the MSSB preferred the newer, designed buildings of Kingsmill Secondary School (later Bishop Allen Academy), which were already nearby, requested the former Alderwood Collegiate Institute in Alderwood (which was closed in June 1983) to serve the rest of southern Etobicoke; Alderwood reopened as the South campus outlet of Etobicoke's first Catholic high school, Michael Power/St. Joseph High School. The school's namesake, Father John Redmond was named in his honor after serving as a Basilian priest, a principal, an educator, and prominent national track and field coach. The roots clearly relied on the Basilian motto of \\"Teach me Goodness, Discipline and Knowledge.\\" The South campus of MPSJ opened its doors in spring 1985 with 17 staff and 300 students under vice-principal Jack Smith. On September 2, 1986, the Father John Redmond community was established with the motto of Cursum Consumavi Fidem Servavi (\\"I Have Finished The Race, I Have Kept The Faith\\"). Jack Smith is the founding principal of the new school. In its first year, Father Redmond Catholic Secondary School had an enrollment of 427 students in grades 9, 10 and 11. By September 1987 grades 12 and OAC had been added and the student population reached 1140 students. The 1960s school buildings were in a very bad state of repair forced Father John Redmond to relocate to newly constructed buildings in New Toronto (St. Teresa's parish), on the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital grounds beside the historic 19th century buildings of the Mimico Lunatic Asylum, which are now the site of Humber College's Lakeshore Campus, in September 2006. As the Toronto Catholic District School Board does not operate an arts school in Etobicoke, Father John Redmond was chosen as the Catholic board's Regional Arts Centre on June 12, 2005. The school serves Catholic students from the former Lakeshore Municipalities (Mimico, New Toronto, Long Branch) in southern Etobicoke.

It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The site was originally a market from 1749 and courthouse from 1752. A new building was constructed in 1817 but after an extensive fire in 1871 it was rebuilt as a replica of the former building. History The site of Alexandria City Hall dates back to 1749 when a market was established there. In 1752, lottery proceeds funded the building of a town hall and courthouse on the site, designed by local gentlemen. George Washington served as a justice in this court, which served Alexandria and Fairfax County (of which Alexandria was a part), and was a town trustee before the Revolutionary War. In 1817, a new three-story brick building was built along Royal Street, including a town clock tower designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe. The tall-steepled tower became a prominent landmark. The Alexandria-Washington Masonic Lodge had its headquarters located in the building for some time. The original city hall was something of a complex, containing the Masonic Lodge, court facility, and both the principal police and fire stations of Alexandria. Market stalls were once situated on the first floors of the west and north wings and in the courtyard which are absent today. Benjamin Henry Latrobe who designed the original 1817 clock tower, later replicated in 1871 and seen today. A wide stairway with rails led from the public entrance on Fairfax Street into the courtrooms. In the northeast corner on the second floor were two offices for the Clerk, one for clerical use and the other for records storage. The Court Room in the northern section of the building on the second floor was in length, wide, and high. It had thirteen windows, with six overlooking the market square below and seven located along Cameron Street. The wainscotting was made from yellow pine with walnut rails. Two doors in the western wall led into the judge's retaining room and to a stairway and private quarters of the judge and officers of the court. The main entrance to the Royal Street western wing was beneath the clock tower. Adolf Cluss On May 19, 1871, an extensive fire gutted the building and, given the importance of the building, the townspeople raised enough money to pay for an exact replica of the 1817 building. The reconstruction was paid for by the sale of 2,000 shares in the Orange and Alexandria Railroad to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad for $40,000 and $10,000 insurance from the destroyed building.Alexandria Gazette (June 3, 1873) Adolf Cluss, a prominent architect, originally from Germany, who had previously designed the U.S. Department of Agriculture building in 1869 and Washington's Central Market in 1870 was swiftly hired‚Äîwithin a week, according to the Alexandria Gazette‚Äîto draw up plans for the building. Cluss was especially noted for his technical skill and attention to building safety and strength. Cluss soon presented a plan for the new City Hall to the council, who authorized it formally on June 28, 1871. His design reflected his strong emphasis on safety and the new building would be constructed from brick with cast iron columns, and rolled iron beams and trusses with roofs made of metal or slate, discarding as many wooden or other combustible construction materials as possible. Delahay, an Alexandria-based builder, presented a bid for $45,000, which was received and accepted on October 5, 1871. The Alexandria-Washington Lodge formally approved Cluss's design on April 2, 1872, and on April 29, 1872, Delahay and Cluss began the construction of the Masonic portion of the building. The new City Hall would be U-shaped around a central courtyard. Another local architect, Benjamin F. Price, provided a plan for replicating the original Latrobe steeple and its estimated cost of $8,000 was paid for by private donors, notably John B. Daingerfield. Price's design for the reconstructed Latrobe tower was approved by the City government on June 12, 1872. Alexandria City Hall in 1871 In the early 20th century, several alterations were made to the site. The Alexandria Fire Company, once located in the southwest corner, vacated the building and opened the way for the expansion of the police headquarters and prisoner detention cells on the first floor. The Court Records Room was relocated from the second floor to the northeast corner of the first floor and bathrooms were added. In 1945, the Alexandria-Washington Masonic Lodge moved out of City Hall when the new George Washington Masonic National Memorial was completed on King Street. Interior renovation of the vacated space then commenced and a second Court Room was established on the second floor with additional offices. In 1960-61, an addition was built, filling in the old courtyard; it was not until 1981 that this addition was linked to the main building and elevators, stairs and corridors were added. A plaza, completed in 1967, is located towards the southern half of the City Hall block. It is an open, landscaped plaza with a central fountain, built as part of the Gadsby Commercial Urban Renewal Project. The current City Hall building houses many of the Alexandria government offices, including the City Council Chambers on the second floor. Architecture =Exterior= The entrance underneath the clock tower In designing the building, Cluss paid particular attention to the strength and durability of the framework. Alexandria City Hall consists of masonry bearing walls with cast-iron columns, supporting the wood ceiling and floor joists. It is constructed in the Second Empire style, incorporating three-dimensional massing, mansard roofs, and superimposed orders. The window types and sizes and decor are largely symmetrical. The majority of the building is laid out in two stories, although there are four three-story corner pavilions and a central four-story pavilion on the north facade. The north facade on Cameron street is approximately long, with a breadth of . Six bays divide the two- story sections and there were two entry doors to the Masonic Lodge. The top floors of the three-story pavilions have semi-circular windows and have hip roofs, two of which are gabled. The central pavilion is crowned by a grouping of three mansard roofs, whilst the two-story sections of the building have gabled roofs, sheathed in slate with galvanized iron cornices. The central pavilion originally had slate with wood cornices and a tin capping but following restoration work in the 1960s these were resheathed and the wood and tin was replaced with iron and copper respectively. The west facade The central clock tower, unlike the rest of the roofing, is still in the original diamond pattern slate, crowned by a gold leaf finial and weather vane. It is a replica of the original 1817 market steeple and is constructed in the Georgian architectural style. The tower has a square rusticated brick base and is structured in three tiers, with the main entry door on the west facade. An inscription on the tower indicates that it was destroyed by a fire on May 19, 1871, and rebuilt in 1872. The tower is supported by two cast-iron columns with Corinthian capitals; above the clock is a smaller octagonal tier with eight narrow windows, enclosed by a wooden balustrade. The tower is crowned by a spire and a gilded weather vane. The west facade of Alexandria City Hall is approximately long and consists of two-story section split with two three- story pavilions which are divided into three bays by four three-story brick piers. The east facade of the hall is located on North Fairfax Street and is the same length as the west at ; it is deep. It has a two-story section, divided into nine bays by brick pilasters, and is terminated on both ends by three-story pavilions which are three bays wide and have three-story corner piers. Some of the pilasters originally contained stove flues and were topped by brick chimneys, but these no longer exist. There is a door at the southern end of the facade which was once the main entrance of old police station. The door at the northern end led into the former Court House. In 1967, the Gadsby Commercial Urban Renewal Project brought about the reorientation of the City Hall towards the southern facade with the new entrance facing King Street and Market Square. It is characterized by an open, landscaped plaza with a central fountain. The southern facade Interior Little remains of the original interior furnishings from 1871, and all that remains are the masonry bearing walls and cast iron columns. The hall was extensively renovated several times in the twentieth century. Some traces of old plaster, paint, and wallpaper are visible in some parts however. In the second floor chamber of the northeast pavilion, the wooden framework is also visible from the cove ceiling. When the structure was extended in 1961 it was necessary to remove some of the original cast iron columns, leaving except ten columns in the central pavilion. When a new Court House opened on King Street in 1981, the court rooms, judicial chambers, prisoner holding cells, clerk's office, jury rooms, witness room, and ancillary facilities were moved out of City Hall. Today the building functions exclusively as a City Hall.

He was a professional dancer and dance teacher, largely responsible for introducing the Latin American dances to England, and for codifying them, and laying the groundwork for their use in competitions and in social dance. The system he and his colleagues developed became the basis for all Latin and American competitions held under the World Dance Council (WDC). Early life As a young man, Pierre's engineering studies at Zurich University were abruptly halted when he was struck in the eye by a tennis ball. This accident resulted in the loss of sight in that eye. After this accident he went to live in Paris where his spare time was spent in the night clubs where Cuban and other Latin immigrants enjoyed their music and dances. He next worked in the French consular service in Liverpool, but was forced to resign when the eye strain began to affect the sighted eye. He moved to London, where he enjoyed ice skating and dancing. After World War I ended in 1918 he started on a career as a professional ballroom dancer.Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing 2004. 100 years of dance: a history of the ISTD Examinations Board, London. p. 62. Although he spent the rest of his life resident in London, Pierre remained a French citizen for his entire life. Latin dance in England The rhythms which make Latin American dance popular were brought to Britain between the two World Wars. Pierre was already an accomplished dancer and teacher in the English ballroom style. In Latin dances, his repertoire first consisted of the Argentine tango, the Paso doble and the Samba. :\\"The tango was always his speciality in demonstrations and as a result many teachers were attracted to it and first learnt it from him.\\" :\\"Pierre had been a celebrated exponent and teacher of tango, dancing first with Countess Gioia, then Mme Bayo, followed by Meredyth Owen. He had established a reputation as the leading specialist for all Latin dances.\\"Wainwright, Lyndon. The story of British popular dance (1997), International Dance Publications, Brighton, UK. For a number of years Pierre's studio was in or near Regent Street.Adverts in The Dancing Times. By 1934 the studio was at 28 Heddon Street, off Regent Street. Later, Doris Lavelle went to him to learn the tango. He quickly realised her potential and after training she became his next dance partner. They demonstrated as often as three nights a week at London restaurants, ballrooms and night clubs, of which there were many at that time. By the 1930s Pierre had moved more towards the Latin American dances, and in 1934 his full-page trade adverts featured the rumba.Richardson PJS (ed) 1934. The Dancing Times: Double Xmas issue. December 1934. The studio stayed open all through World War II, and was a popular meeting place for the Free French fighters on leave in London. After the war, the studio was re-established at 15, Greek Street, Soho. A small studio on the top floor with a good maple floor, and a sound system installed by James Arnell, who later became International Latin American dance champion.Spencer, Frank and Peggy. 1968. Come dancing. Allen, London. pp. 137, 179‚Äì81. James Arnell won the International Amateur Latin American Championship in its first year (1953) with E. Pescador, and the Professional with Jillian LaValette five years in succession 1955‚Äì1959, and 1965. =The rumba arrives in London= The ballroom rumba is so called despite the music, and the dance, being of a different genre from the authentic Cuban rumba. The rumba danced in America and Europe was, and is, a music of the son type: 'rumba' was a marketing term to cover several terms used by Cubans; salsa is a comparable case today. In 1932, Monsieur and Madame Chapoul, well known French demonstrators, gave an exhibition of rumba at the Caf√© de Paris in London, followed by Don Azpiaz√∫ and his band, the very group who had had such a hit with their recording of Peanut Vendor. Pierre was present and later went to the Cabine Cubaine club in Paris to take a look at the dancers. Originally, Pierre had visited Paris to find out how their dancers and teachers dealt with the rumba. He discovered they used a system devised in the USA, the square rumba, so called after its basic figure. By 1934 he was featuring the rumba in his demonstrations, his adverts, his classes and in magazine articles.Richardson PJS (ed) 1934. The Dancing Times: Double Xmas issue (December). Article by Pierre: The basic steps of the rumba, pp. 298-99. Following the war, in 1947, Pierre visited Cuba, where he discovered to his surprise that the Cubans danced it differently. When he danced with Suzy of Pepe and Suzy Rivera, the then Cuban champions, according to Lavelle's diary,Evans, Irene. A concise history of Latin American dancing in the UK Part II, ISTD LA Faculty website (1992). the first thing she said was \\"you are out of time\\". So he had a lesson every day and danced at the acadamias [sic] every night. After this period of study he returned to London determined to replace the square rumba with the Cuban rumba, \\"el sistema cubano\\". To this end, Pierre wrote the first account of his ideas on the rumba as a dance.Pierre 1948. Latin & American dances for students and teachers. Self-published, London. In this short book, Pierre gives the square rumba at the start of the book, and the first published account of the Cuban 'rumba' in Chapter 7. This latter was substantially the same as in the finally agreed syllabus of 1955.Evans, Irene 1992. A concise history of Latin American dancing in the UK UK Alliance of Professional Teachers of Dancing; also web-site of ISTD LA Faculty. One of the characteristics of Cuban dance to the son, and other similar rhythms, was, and still is, their method of taking three steps to four beats of music (whether 2/4 or 4/4). Whereas the Square rumba had been danced on beat 1, the Cuban rumba figure starts on beat 2, counting (pause) 2, 3, 4-1 as (pause) quick, quick, slow with the hip settling over the standing foot on 4-1. All social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and, though this is scarcely noticeable in fast salsa, it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba.Laird, Walter. The Laird Technique of Latin Dancing (2003). International Dance Publications Ltd. pg. 9. \\"Transfer full weight to this foot allowing the pelvis to move sideways and back so that the weight is felt to be near the heel of the standing foot. The knee of the supporting leg is locked back.\\" This description incidentally illustrates the difficulty of describing body movements in print. The Latin and American section of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) Ballroom Branch was formed in 1947 by Monsieur Pierre as Chairman, his partner Doris Lavelle, and their colleague, Doris Nichols. They were the first examiners, soon joined by Gwenethe Walshe and Dimitri Petrides. This small band of specialists worked to establish an examination system and syllabus for both amateur and professional dancers. Walter Laird and Peggy Spencer, were other important members, among others, added a few years later. The syllabus which was finally agreed in 1955 has been the foundation of teaching and competition in the Latin American dances ever since. This work naturally included the samba, paso doble and jive as well, but it was the composition of the rumba which was critical. After further visits to Cuba in the early 1950s, when Doris Lavelle and James Arnell accompanied Pierre, the cha cha cha was added to make the five Latin American dances that are still the basis of teaching and competition today in the international dance community. On Monsieur Pierre's death in 1963, his colleague Doris Nichols commented: \\"The Latin American dancing world was so influenced, fostered and built up by him that the names of 'Pierre' and 'Latin American' became virtually synonymous.\\" Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing 2004. 100 years of dance: a history of the ISTD Examinations Board, London. pg. 62 Monsieur Pierre was a Fellow, Examiner and committee member of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) and a Member of the Official Board of Ballroom Dancing (OBBD).

The timeline of clothing and textiles technology includes major changes in the manufacture and distribution of clothing. From clothing in the ancient world into modernity the use of technology has dramatically influenced clothing and fashion in the modern age. Industrialization brought changes in the manufacture of goods. In many nations, homemade goods crafted by hand have largely been replaced by factory produced goods on assembly lines purchased in a consumer culture. Innovations include man-made materials such as polyester, nylon, and vinyl as well as features like zippers and velcro. The advent of advanced electronics has resulted in wearable technology being developed and popularized since the 1980s. Design is an important part of the industry beyond utilitarian concerns and the fashion and glamour industries have developed in relation to clothing marketing and retail. Environmental and human rights issues have also become considerations for clothing and spurred the promotion and use of some natural materials such as bamboo that are considered environmentally friendly. Production The advent of industrialization included factories, specialized and technologically advanced equipment, and production lines for the mass production of textiles. Globalization and advances in trade increased sourcing of metrials and competition for wares across borders. The swadeshi movement in India was an effort to counteract the economic control and influence that British factories exerted over the one-time colony. Concerns have also been raised over the use of so-called sweat shops. Clothing lines based on famous designers have been featured and advertised in magazines and other media. Branding and [marketing] are features of the advertising age. Some designers have also become television and media personalities. In recent years fashion and design has also been the subject of television shows. Sports The design and constructions of sportswear has changed dramatically over time. Swimwear used in competitions been developed including foams, synthetic and stretchable tapes, and lightweight materials with performance characteristics specially designed for various athletics pursuits have been developed. Education Computer-aided design is used in the production of clothing. Corporate and business training to address accounting, trade, and finance issues has also become a significant part of the trade. Courses and programs at Universities specialize in these fields. the Beijing Institute of Clothing Technology and Fachhochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin are examples institutions focused on the business. National governments have also become involved in the business with trade rules and negotiations as well as investments such as Europe's Future Textiles and Clothing program.

Traditional portfolio construction balances expected portfolio variance with return and uses a risk aversion metric to select the optimal mix of investments. By contrast, GBI optimizes an investment mix to minimize the probability of failing to achieve a minimum wealth level within a set period of time. Goals-based investors have numerous goals (known as the \\"goals- space\\") and capital is allocated across these goals as well as to investments within them. Following Maslow's hierarchy of needs, more important goals (e.g. survival needs: food, shelter, medical care) receive priority over less important goals (e.g. aspirational goals such as buying a vacation home or yacht). Once capital is divvied between an investor's golas, the portoflios are optimized to deliver the highest probability of achieving each specified goal. It is a similar approach to asset-liability management for insurance companies and the liability-driven investment strategy for pension funds, but GBI further integrates financial planning with investment management which insures that household goals are funded in an efficient manner. In goals-based investing, assets are the full set of resources the investor has available (including financial assets, real estate, employment income, social security, etc.) while liabilities are the financial liabilities (such as loans, mortgages, etc) in addition to the capitalized value of the household's financial goals and aspirations. GBI takes into account the progress against goals which are categorized as either essential needs, lifestyle wants or legacy aspirations depending on level of importance to an individual or family. It also helps to prevent rash investment decisions by providing a clear process for identifying goals and choosing investment strategies for those goals. These goals may include ability to put children in a good school, retiring early, and be able to afford a quality life after retirement.  Mathematical model  Goals-based investors are typically assumed to have a collection goals which compete for a limited pool of wealth. This set of goals, \\\\mathsf{G}, is called the goals-space and is rank-ordered such that \\\\\\\\{A,B,C,...,N\\\\\\\\}\\\\in \\\\mathsf{G}, where goal A is preferred to goal B, goal B is preferred to goal C and so on, across the total number of goals, N. Mathematically, a goal is defined as a three-variable vector, A=(w,W,t), where w is the current wealth dedicated to the goal, W is the future wealth required to fund the goal, and t is the time period in which the objective must be funded. W and t are given by the investor; w is an output of the across-goal optimization procedure. Current wealth, w, could be also thought of as the percentage of overall wealth an investor dedicates to the goal. Because of this definition, the goal vector can be equivalently stated as A=(\\\\varpi\\\\vartheta,W,t) with \\\\varpi representing the total pool of wealth available to the investor and \\\\vartheta representing the percentage of the total wealth pool allocated to this particular goal (of course, \\\\sum_i \\\\vartheta_i=1 ). Because preferences across the goals-space can be declared, there exists a value function such that A\\\\succeq B \\\\implies v(A)\\\\geq v(B). It is therefore the objective of the investor to maximize utility by varying the allocation of wealth to each goal in the goals-space, and vary the allocation of wealth to potential investments within each goal: \\\\max_{\\\\vartheta,\\\\omega} \\\\sum_i^N v(i)\\\\phi(\\\\varpi\\\\vartheta_i, W_i, t_i) where \\\\phi(\\\\cdot) is the probability of achieving a goal, given the inputs. In most theoretical applications, \\\\phi(\\\\cdot) is assumed Gaussian (though any distribution model that fits the application may be used), and \\\\phi(\\\\varpi\\\\vartheta,W,t) usually takes the form \\\\phi(\\\\varpi\\\\vartheta,W,t) = 1 - \\\\Phi\\\\left( \\\\frac{W}{\\\\varpi\\\\vartheta}^{\\\\frac{1}{t}}-1; \\\\mu, \\\\sigma\\\\right) where \\\\Phi(\\\\cdot) is the Gaussian cumulative distribution function, \\\\frac{W}{\\\\varpi\\\\vartheta}^{\\\\frac{1}{t}}-1 is the return required to achieve the portfolio's objective within the given time period, and \\\\mu, \\\\sigma are the expected return and standard deviation of the investment portfolio. Expected returns and volatility are themselves functions of the portfolio's investment weights: \\\\mu = \\\\sum_i \\\\omega_i m_i \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\sum_i \\\\omega^2_i s_i ^2 + \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_{i eq j}\\\\omega_i\\\\omega_j s_i s_j\\\\rho_{i,j} with m representing the investment's expected return, s representing the investment's expected standard deviation, and \\\\rho_{i,j} representing the correlation of investment i to investment j . The implementation of the model carries some complexity as it is recursive. The probability of achieving a goal is dependent on the amount of wealth allocated to the goal as well as the mix investments within each goal's portfolio. The mix of investments, however, is dependent on the amount of wealth dedicated to the goal. To overcome this recursivity the optimal mix of investments can first be found for discrete levels of wealth allocation, then a Monte Carlo engine can be used to find maximal utility.  Comparison to modern portfolio theory  Goals-based optimization results in investment portfolios that may or may not lie on the mean-variance efficient frontier. When a goal is valued highly enough it receives a capital allocation sufficient to keep it on the frontier (A and B in the picture). However, when the goal is more aspirational (and valued less) the portfolio departs from the frontier in favor of high-variance investments. In this example, portfolio C is fully funded and therefore allocated to the risk-free asset. Though not necessarily mean-variance efficient, goals-based portfolios will generate portfolios with higher probabilities of goal achievement than mean-variance portfolios. The fundamental difference between goals-based investing and modern portfolio theory (MPT) turns on the definition of \\"risk.\\" MPT defines risk as portfolio volatility whereas GBI defines risk as the probability of failing to achieve a goal. Initially, it was thought that these competing definitions were mutually-exclusive, though it was later shown that the two are mathematically synonymous for most cases. In the case where investors are not limited in their ability to borrow or sell short, there is no cost to dividing wealth across various accounts, nor is there a mathematical difference between mean-variance optimization and probability maximization. However, goals-based investors are generally assumed to be limited in their ability to borrow and sell short. Under those real- world constraints, the efficient frontier has an endpoint and probability maximization produces different results than mean-variance optimization when a portfolio's required return (r_{req.}) is greater than the maximum return offered by the mean-variance efficient frontier (\\\\mu_e). This is because when r_{req.}>\\\\mu_e probability is maximized by increasing variance rather than minimizing it. MPT's quadratic utility form u=r-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2}\\\\sigma^2, \\\\gamma>0 assumes investors are always variance averse whereas GBI expects investors to be variance seeking when r_{req.}>\\\\mu_e, variance averse when r_{req.}<\\\\mu_e, and variance indifferent when r_{req.}= \\\\mu_e. Mean-variance portfolios are therefore first-order stochastically dominated by goals-based portfolios when short-sales and leverage are bounded. In its pure form, modern portfolio theory takes no account of investor goals. Rather, MPT portfolios are selected using an investor's variance aversion parameter, \\\\gamma, and no account is taken of future wealth requirements, current wealth available, nor the time horizon within which the goals must be attained. MPT has since been adapted to include these variables, but goals-based portfolio solutions yield higher probabilities of goal achievement than adapted MPT. For most applications, mean-variance optimized portfolios and goals-based portfolios are the same. For aspirational goals, where an investor has allocated little initial wealth, goals-based portfolios will favor high-variance investments that would be eliminated from a mean-variance efficient portfolio.  History and development  Goals-based investing grew out of observations made by behavioral finance and ongoing critiques of modern portfolio theory (MPT). Richard Thaler's observation that individuals tend to mentally subdivide their wealth, with each mental \\"bucket\\" dedicated to different objectives (a concept called mental accounting) was foundational to the later development of GBI. Indeed, some authors refer to goals-based portfolios as \\"mental accounts.\\" Other authors began to critique MPT as not as effective when applied to individuals, especially in light of taxes. Behavioral portfolio theory (BPT) combined mental accounting with the redefinition of risk as the probability of failing to achieve a goal, and investors balance returns over-and-above their requirement with the risk of failing to achieve the goal. BPT also revealed a problem with adapting MPT. While most practitioners were building investment portfolios wherein the portfolio's expected return equaled the required return required to achieve the goal, BPT showed that this necessarily results in a 50% probability of achieving the goal. The probability maximization component of goals-based investing was therefore adopted from behavioral portfolio theory. Early critics of this approach suggested that divvying wealth across separate portfolios may generate inefficient mean-variance portfolios. It was eventually shown, however, that this physical manifestation of the mental accounting framework was not necessarily inefficient, so long as short-sales and leverage were allowed. As long as all portfolios reside on the mean- variance efficient frontier, then the aggregate portfolio will reside on the frontier as well. Other researchers further questioned the use of MPT when applied to individuals because the risk-aversion parameter was shown to vary through time and in response to different objectives. As Carrie H. Pan and Meir Statman put it: \\"foresight is different from hindsight, and the risk tolerance of investors, assessed in foresight, is likely different from their risk tolerance assessed in hindsight.\\" MPT was synthesized with behavioral portfolio theory, and in that synthesis work the risk-aversion parameter was eliminated. Rather than assess her risk aversion parameter, the investor is asked to specify the maximum probability of failure she is willing to accept for a given goal. This probability figure is then mathematically converted into MPT's risk aversion parameter and portfolio optimization proceeds along mean-variance lines. The synthesis work, then, eliminated the risk-is-failure- probability of original behavioral portfolio theory and thus yielded infeasible solutions when the required return was greater than the portfolio's expected return. In addressing how investors should allocate wealth across goals, Jean Brunel observed that the declaration of a maximum probability of failure was mathematically synonymous to the declaration of a minimum mental account allocation. Investors, then, could allocate both within and across mental accounts, but some conversation was still required to allocate any remaining excess wealth. To solve the infeasibility problem of the synthesized MPT, as well the problem of allocating \\"excess wealth,\\" the original probability maximization component of BPT was resurrected and the value-of- goals function was introduced. Investors, then, face a two-layer allocation decision: allocating wealth across goals and allocating to investments within each goal. In an effort to promote goals-based investing research, The Journal of Wealth Management was formed in 1998. Since 2010s, some robo advisors have been providing the goals-based investing feature through their websites and mobile apps.

Somapala and mother Chitra Somapala (nee Perera) had been renowned Sri Lankan musicians, as well as music directors and producers, in which his father also worked in the capacity of a movie music director. Chitral's father, who entered the music arena in the 1940‚Äôs, had made contributions towards various fields of music, such as gramophone records, radio, cinema and television, for several decades that followed. After the marriage of Chitral's father, P.L.A. Somapala, to his mother Chitra Perera in 1952, almost all songs with the original tunes of Chitral's father began to be sung by his mother. The duo also contributed to the soundtrack of the renowned Sri Lankan movie \\"Asoka\\", a 1955 Sri Lankan Romantic Musical based on the Bollywood movie titled ‚ÄúSheesa‚Äù. His parent's songs \\"Lalitha Kala\\" and \\"Dambulu Gale\\" are still popular hits among both the young and old generations in Sri Lanka. ‚ÄúDambulu Gale‚Äù was also recreated by Chitral in later years, adding a soulful and accentuated touch to the original song, which brought mixed feedback by critics, musicians, and fans. Chitral was educated at Isipathana College (formally known as Greenlands College), a national school for boys, located in Colombo 5, Sri Lanka. He was a talented sportsman including earning National Medals in junior cricket, football (soccer), and hockey. In 1977 he was selected from All Island as a teenage footballer for the International Year of the Child Programme in Tokyo, Japan. At the tender age of 10, and prior to focusing on singing, young Chitral (Chity) began to take guitar lessons. Soon after, at the age of 14, he switched to electric bass, and eventually began singing thereafter. As a teenager, at the considerably young age of 17, Chitral began to hit the Top 40 Nightclub Circuit in Colombo, Sri Lanka, where he ended-up gigging with the leading bands and artists of Sri Lanka of that particular era. In the year 1985, the ingenious musician joined the Sri Lankan band called Shock, an alternative band founded by Diliup Gabadamudalige, considered to be the pioneer of computer-based music production in Sri Lanka, and a main figure of the modern music industry in the island nation. In 1986, Chitral traveled to Europe: namely; Switzerland, Germany, Austria and Finland ‚Äî as the bassist and singer of a Top 40 band called Rendesvouz (which was later named Friends). The band Friends also backed numerous well-known artists in the aforesaid European countries. After indulging in the night club tenure for a considerable duration, in time ‚Äî and after touring from club to club for a while playing Top 40 Hits ‚Äî he decided to take a diverse turn in his music career. Therefore, in 1994 Chitral left the previously involved music/performance sequence, and began concentrating on performing only as a vocalist in order to pursue his dream of playing Hard Rock and Heavy Metal. In this noteworthy journey, he joined a well-known German underground metal act called Court Jester in 1996, with whom he recorded the album \\"Forced II Believe\\", which received countless favorable reviews in the European press. Work Chitral \\"Chity\\" Somapala in 2009 In 1998, Chitral contributed the astounding song \\"Nadee Ganga\\", which has ever since been continuously heard not only on Sri Lankan radio stations and TV channels, but also has become a hit song sung by numerous contestants at popular reality TV programmes conducted in Sri Lanka over the years. It was originally recorded by Chitral for a TV/Radio commercial to promote the brand of Lion Beer in Sri Lanka, which is of high demand on the island. It immediately became an undying, captivating hit, and is based on the melody of \\"Many Rivers To Cross\\" by Jimmy Cliff. However, Chitral sings this amazing song with Sinhala lyrics in a Hard Rock and Metal style, via his significantly smashing own idiosyncratic vocal stylings. As the years flew by, Chitral joined a German Melodic Power/Progressive band called Avalon as front man and lead singer. In collaboration with others, Avalon was produced by Charlie Bauerfeind, a German sound engineer and producer who had worked mostly with power metal bands such as Helloween, Gamma Ray, Blind Guardian, Saxon, etc. The aforesaid German progressive outfit Avalon was in the midst of the underground scene going back to 1992. While their earlier exploits were a clear exercise in solid musicianship, 1998 brought in the voice that would both solidify and codify this band's sound: the then up & comer Chity Somapala. The third album by Avalon, ‚ÄúVision Eden‚Äù, received excellent reviews in the international press. Moreover, the Vision Eden tour had Avalon as a support act for bands such as HammerFall, Uriah Heep, Metallica, Mot√∂rhead, Royal Hunt, Pink Cream 69, and many others. During the summer of 2000, Chitral participated on Avalon's 4th Album, \\"Eurasia\\", under the hands of Sascha Paeth, who is known for his work with Rhapsody Of Fire, Kamelot, Heaven's Gate, Angra and others. On ‚ÄúEurasia‚Äù certain Asian musical influences from Chitral's native Sri Lanka could be heard as well. In addition, during the vocal parts on ‚ÄúEurasia‚Äù, Chitral could be heard playing a member of the guitar family, the \\"Chapman Stick\\", an electric musical instrument devised by Emmett Chapman in the early 1970s. Avalon was more diverse than the usual power metal bands, and consisted of quality Euro Power Metal with plenty of Prog Metal influences in their music. They necessarily did not attempt to go over the top with countless double bass or stretching guitar licks. Instead, Avalon utilized these entities only when necessary, creating an exclusive effect which made them unique. The release of ‚ÄúEurasia‚Äù was followed by a European tour with Metalium. Avalon disbanded shortly afterwards. In 2002, Chitral contributed \\"Greenland's Theme\\" for his alma mater, Isipathana College's International Rugby Championships in Sri Lanka. Later that year, Chitral formed a melodic rock outfit called Faro. The band released the albums ‚ÄùDawn of Forever‚Äù and \\"Angelost\\" through MTM Music. Also in 2002. In Summer 2003 Chitral recorded the album \\"Echoes Of A Nightmare\\" with the Swedish symphonic metal band Moonlight Agony for Massacre Records. Towards the latter part of 2003, Chitral was auditioned by the young Greek guitar virtuoso Gus G (who has also played in Mystic Prophecy, Nightrage, Arch Enemy, Dream Evil, and Ozzy Osbourne) to join his band Firewind for a January 2004 headline tour of Japan. Following a successful Japanese tour, Gus G asked Chitral to join the band on a permanent basis, and soon after they began sharing ideas for Firewind‚Äôs third album. The result of their timely collaboration, \\"Forged By Fire\\", entered the Japanese TOP 100, and received excellent reviews around the globe. After a tour with Hammerfall in 2005, Chitral decided to leave Firewind. In 2006, Chitral formed his own band Civilization One together with guitarist Aldo Lonobile (Secret Sphere), bassist Pierre-Emmanuel Pelisson (Maladaptive, Ex-Heavenly), and drummer Luca Cartasegna (Secret Sphere). Their intention was to form a band which created hard and aggressive riffs with the sensitivity of classical music, and combine them with memorable vocals and choruses, as achieved by the classic Heavy Metal bands. Civilization One released the critically acclaimed albums ‚ÄúRevolution Rising‚Äù (2007) and ‚ÄúCalling The Gods‚Äù (2012). Civilization One is currently on hiatus. Chitral was recording and performing with the German progressive metal band Red Circuit from 2002 till 2016 and the British Classic Rock/Metal band Rekuiem from 2008 till 2012, one of the founding members of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal Movement back in the early 1980s from Birmingham. In May 2010, Chitral joined the British power metal band Power Quest. Following 17 months as a member of the band and an album release, \\"Blood Alliance‚Äù, he left the band on amicable terms, Chitral was the composer and singer of the Olympic Theme Song, ‚ÄúDreams of Fire‚Äù for MTV in Sri Lanka, and he also composed and sang ‚ÄúBelieving The Dream‚Äô‚Äù, the Official Cricket World Cup song for MTV.  Film Music  Having countless experiences in the music field of recording, Chity was offered to work with some internationally recognized film directors for film scoring. He has worked with Chandran Ratnam, Asoka Handagama, and other notable filmmakers and has won international & national awards. In addition, he has been producing his compositions of film scores for Sri Lankan movies of the new generation, as well as several music videos featuring his original hits, which have a deep message to injustices occurring in current affairs in his native land. He also recorded a duet titled \\"Malakuth Thibuna \\" with popular Sri Lankan female vocalist Umara Sinhawansha. His other original Sri Lankan hits, produced during the recent past, which acquired absolute positive feedback from the local press, as well as promising devotion from his local fans include: Aherenna (Ege Esa Aga / Let Her Cry - Film-score + Theme Song), Man Adareyi (Me Wage Adarayak / A Love like this - Movie Score + Theme Song), Miringuwa Parada, Sihinaya Pupura Yai from the movie ‚ÄòDedunu Akase‚Äô, Vilpaththuwe deforestation of the national park ‚ÄòWilpaththwa‚Äô Chitral also performed as a solo singer at the 2009 & 2011 ‚ÄòFete La Musique‚Äô Concerts with the Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra at Rock Am Knuedler with Professor/Conductor Gast Waltzing, a highly acclaimed achievement for a Sri Lankan born musician. Chitral is a Sri Lankan musician who has done wonders in bringing the Contemporary Rock/Metal flavor to Sri Lankan audiences, and perhaps the most important figure in Sri Lankan 20th century popular music; He undoubtedly holds responsibility for bringing Rock and Heavy Metal Music to Sri Lankan ears. As such, today Chitral is considered one of the most acclaimed Hard Rock/Metal vocalists & composers in his native country of Sri Lanka.

While the first light station was established in 1830, the current lighthouse was built in 1847. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Mount Desert Light Station in 1988. History The conical granite structure was one in a series of lighthouses in Maine designed by architect Alexander Parris. A bell tower and fog bell were added in 1858, as well as a new lantern with a 3rd order Fresnel lens. The bell was replaced by a steam-powered whistle in 1889. The present keeper's house was built in 1892. The station was electrified in 1931 and automated in 1977; around that time, the lantern was removed and the lens was replaced aero-beacon. In 1985, a replica of the lantern was installed, and circa (c.) 1995, the aero-beacon was replaced with a VRB-25 lighthouse system. The station was transferred in 1998 to the College of the Atlantic as part of the Maine Lights program. It is used as an ecology research station, primarily known for its work on finback and humpback whales. The station is both farther offshore and more exposed than any other lighthouse on the east coast. It sustained serious damage during Hurricane Daisy (1962) and Hurricane Bill (2009). In August 2009, the boathouse was washed away, two walls of the generator building were ripped apart, and all the furniture and equipment on the first floor of the lightkeeper's house were ruined when it flooded almost to the ceiling. The college research station was subsequently closed until August 2010. Keepers *Esais Preble (1833‚Äì1835) *William Preble (assistant, 1833‚Äì1835) *Benjamin Ward Jr. (1841‚Äì?) *Jacob L.

He was known for his studies of the historical phonology of Chinese. Life and career Edwin G. \\"Ted\\" Pulleyblank was born on August 7, 1922, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. His father, William George Edwin Pulleyblank, was a teacher of mathematics who later became a school vice-principal, and his mother, Ruth Pulleyblank, had also been a teacher. Pulleyblank was an avid student with a bright intellect and an excellent memory for details, and taught himself Ancient Greek while in high school. He matriculated at the University of Alberta in 1939 on an Alberta provincial government scholarship, and majored in the Latin and Greek Classics while also tutoring other students in math and physics in his spare time. Pulleyblank graduated in 1942 at the height of World War II. Noticing his aptitude for both mathematics and foreign languages, one of Pulleyblank's professors offered him a chance to do \\"secret war work\\", which he accepted. On February 22, 1943 Pulleyblank joined the Examination Unit in Ottawa. This Unit was the civilian codebreaking unit of the Canadian Government. On May 13, 1943 Pulleyblank was sent to England to train with the Government Code and Cipher School at Bletchley Park. He returned to Canada and on December 12, 1943 joined the Japanese Diplomatic Section of the Examination Unit, and later began studying Chinese at Carleton University. In 1946, Pulleyblank received a Chinese government scholarship to study Chinese at the School of African and Oriental Studies, University of London, where he stayed for two years. In 1948, the SOAS made Pulleyblank a Lecturer in Classical Chinese, even though he would later recall that his command of Japanese was at that time still better than his Chinese. He taught courses while pursuing doctoral studies under the German sinologist Walter Simon, and received a Ph.D. in 1951 with a dissertation entitled \\"The Background and Early Life of An Lu-shan\\". Pulleyblank spent a year doing research at libraries in Tokyo and Kyoto, Japan, and also did additional studies in Chinese at Cambridge University, receiving an M.A. in 1953.

Parts of the church, most notably the tower, are Anglo-Saxon, and it is the oldest church in Cambridgeshire as well as the oldest building in Cambridge. The church is dedicated to Saint Benedict of Nursia, the founder of the Benedictine order of monasticism. ‚Äì on the 'About St Benedict' tab. Bene't is an attempt to reconcile the Anglo-Norman name Benet with the Latin (and modern English) form of the saint's name Benedict. Latin documents from the 13th and 14th century refer to \\"ecclesie sancti Benedicti\\" while a contract (in English) of 6 June 1452 for a new roof referred to the \\"cherche of seynt Bennettys\\". Lyne's map of Cambridge of 1574 shows \\"Benett Ch\\" while Loggan's map of 1688 shows \\"St Bennetts Church\\". In the 19th century the church was variously referred to as being of \\"St Benedict\\", \\"St Benet\\" or \\"St Bene't\\". Modern usage is either \\"St Benet\\" or \\"St Bene't\\". Location The church is on the south side of Bene't Street next to Corpus Christi College.St Bene't's Church, Cambridge St Bene't's was the College's chapel until 1579. The College remains the church's patron, and there are continuing links between the church and the College chapel. History St Bene't's Anglo-Saxon tower was \\"most probably\\" built between AD 1000‚Äì1050, although the present bell-openings were added in 1586. The tower has characteristically Anglo-Saxon long-and-short quoins. These project beyond the rubble face, indicating that the tower used to be rendered, as All Saints' Church, Earls Barton is. Inside the church the 11th-century arch supporting the tower is the most notable feature. The arcade of the nave is from a rebuilding of c.1300, when the aisles were also rebuilt. The 14th- century aisles and the north and east walls of the chancel were razed when the church was widened during two Victorian restorations: in 1853 Raphael Brandon rebuilt the north aisle and added the porch; in 1872 Arthur Blomfield rebuilt the south aisle, the chancel and the clerestory of the nave including the chancel arch. During these works Anglo-Saxon footings of quoins were found which indicated that the original nave was wider than it is today. It is not known when aisles were first added, but it seems likely to have been at a rebuilding before that of c.1300. In the 13th century the chancel was altered, hence the deeply splayed Early English Gothic lancet windows on the south side (one of which is now blocked). The sedilia and piscina in the chancel are 14th-century, with Decorated Gothic ogeed arches. The clerestory and roof of the nave are late Perpendicular Gothic and date from 1452. St Bene't's has one monumental brass: a small kneeling figure of Richard Billingford, who died in 1442 and had been Master of Corpus Christi College 1398‚Äì1432. The church is a Grade I listed building. The 11th century tower arch Bells From its earliest days until the 17th century, the University paid the church to use its bells. A document of 1273 records that the rector agreed to the bells being rung for the University provided the \\"customary gratification\\" was paid. This became an annual sum of six shillings and eight pence which was paid as late as 1624, after the tower of Great St Mary's had been completed. In 1655 the University gave thirty shillings \\"as a free gift\\" towards the repair of the bells. The tower has a ring of six bells, five of which are 16th or 17th century. Oldest is the second bell, cast by an unknown bellfounder in 1588. A local founder, Richard Holdfield of Cambridge, cast the third bell in 1607 and the fifth bell in 1610. John Draper of Thetford cast the tenor bell in 1618 and Robert Gurney of Bury St Edmunds cast the treble bell in 1663. The youngest is the fourth bell, cast by William Dobson of Downham Market in 1825. Dobson was a prolific bellfounder and 233 of his bells are known to survive. Surviving bells by Holdfield, Draper or Gurney are much rarer. People Michael Ramsey, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury, was vicar in 1938. Brothers of the Society of Saint Francis (among them Br Michael (Fisher)) served at St Bene't's from 1945 until 2005. The Revd Angela Tilby, a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day, was vicar, 2007‚Äì11. From September 2012, the vicar has been the Revd Canon Anna Matthews, previously precentor of St Alban's Cathedral.The History of St Bene't's church Fabian Stedman (1640‚Äì1713), a pioneer in the development of change ringing, was clerk of the parish in the mid 17th century.

Dopp kit Dopp kit is a term particularly in use in the US for toiletry bags. The name derives from the early 20th century leather craftsman Charles Doppelt, whose company designed the case in 1926. Toiletry kits had been issued by the US military services during World War I. \\"Toiletry\\" and \\"Dopp\\" kits became synonymous when the military issued them through World War II. The Dopp brand name was purchased by Samsonite in the early 1970s and was acquired by Buxton in 1979. The trademark Dopp was filed by Samsonite for registration at the US Trademark Office on March 24, 1980. The class of goods for which it was applicable was \\"toilet cases sold empty, briefcases, briefcase type portfolios, sample and catalog cases sold empty, luggage identification tags, and traveling bags.\\" An additional filing for the trademark Dopp Kit was made on April 3, 1980 for the class of goods \\"travel kits, sold empty\\". In both of those applications, Samsonite stated that the trademarks were first used in July 1936. The registration for Dopp Kit was cancelled in March 2003 when no one filed a required (Section 8) Declaration of Continued Use, but the required declarations have been filed for Dopp. The marks were assigned to DHP Limited Partnership (dba Buxton) in 1990; the current owner of the Dopp trademark is listed as Buxton Acquisition Co., LLC, of Chicopee, Massachusetts. However, owing to the genericization of the trademark during the period since registration by Samsonite lapsed, the trademark for Dopp by Buxton is unenforceable, and the term may be used freely.

The ministry of education assured him that he would succeed Wilhelm Schlenk as head of the chemistry institute of the University of Berlin, but this never happened. His personality became strongly misanthropic.

AP Newsfeatures carried Paprocki's panel as part of its Sunday package from 1942 to March 5, 1955. To see this image at a full resolution, go to Stripper's Guide. AP Newsfeatures, aka AP Features, was the cartoon and comic strip division of Associated Press, which syndicated strips from 1930 to the early 1960s.  History  = Origins = In February 1930, I. M. Kendrick, executive assistant to AP president Kent Cooper, announced a March 17, 1930, launch for the Associated Press Feature Service, with an initial nine units, including a daily news cartoon, various comic strips and several panels. With the expansion of the Associated Press Feature Service to include a comprehensive comic strip and cartoon service for evening papers, AP that April announced plans to provide a similar service for morning papers. Cooper commented: =The 1930 launch= The first nine features: * Gloria, a daily \\"pretty girl\\" strip with continuity, by Julian Ollendorf (who also worked on the animated Topics of the Day and Sketchographs) * Homer Hoopee, a daily family strip by Fred Locher (former creator of Cicero Sapp for the New York Evening World) * Colonel Gilfeather, an imitation of Our Boarding House in a daily three-column panel by Dick Dorgan (brother of the cartoonist Tad Dorgan) * Scorchy Smith, an aviation-adventure strip by John Terry (who also worked on animated cartoons) * Rollo Rollingstone, a daily strip by Bruce Barr * Modest Maidens, a two- column \\"pretty girl\\" panel by Don Flowers * news cartoon by Lance Nolly (formerly of the Austin American and the Dallas News) * three-column village life feature by Oscar Hitt * two-column cartoon by Aleyn Burtis The AP service eventually made a full page of daily strips available, including Dickie Dare and Oaky Doaks. Other strips carried by AP included C. Mozier's Junior's Viewpoint (1935), Aldine Swank's panel Beautyettes (1935), Frank Stevens' Li'l Chief Hot-Shot (1945‚Äì46), Ed Sullivan's The Nerve of Some People (1945‚Äì46), George Wunder's See for Yourself (1946), Rome Siemon's Little Moonfolks (1952), Bud Sagendorf's Spur Line (1954-55) and Sylvia Robbins' panel, Don't Do That (1950‚Äì56). How Christmas Began, which first appeared in 1951 and ran annually for five days each Christmas week, was drawn in an outline form, minus blacks or shadows, so children could color the panels. Flowers also created Oh, Diana!, which was continued by Bill Champi and Phil Berube after Flowers left AP for King Features. Virginia Clark was drawing Oh, Diana! in 1947. Flowers' other AP creation, Modest Maidens, was taken over by AP staff artist Jay Alan.Waugh, Coulton. The Comics. Macmillan, 1947. AP carried a set number of strips, so a new strip was not added until one was dropped. When the Oaky Doaks daily debuted on June 17, 1935, it replaced Harold Detje's Be Scientific with Ol' Doc Dabble which ran from June 6, 1932, until June 15, 1935. In a similar fashion, when Milton Caniff learned of an opening while he was working on AP spot illustrations, he spent the weekend drawing samples, and Caniff's strip career was launched when his Dickie Dare began in 1933. The following year, Dickie Dare was taken over by Coulton Waugh.Holtz, Allan.

Fred Locher worked with Rand Taylor on Homer Hoopee, and Phil Berube drew the strip's final three years (1953‚Äì56). Hank Barrow wrote and drew Things to Come, an AP Sunday feature focusing on speculative technology. The title derived from H. G. Wells science fiction novel, The Shape of Things to Come (1933).

It lies about 4 miles due north of Eglingham, and can be reached by lining up the tall mast behind the farm with the left-hand end of the wood to the side of the Quarry House farm (to the north of the cave), then walking on this bearing. A shallow crater with cut steps lead down into an easy rift passage which ultimately chokes. After the initial steepness of the steps, the passage is roomy with a slight downward tilt, running between two large planes of Gritstone which close in above. After about 30m a block, protruding downwards from the ceiling, reduces the route to a crawl into a small chamber which is choked by large blocks ahead. This crawl is sandy and often completely dry, although in very wet weather it occasionally sumps.Scaife, Chris: The Caves of Northumberland, Sigma Leisure, 2019 The main fault, however, continues, and it is likely that this cave could be extended by concerted digging (a dangerous activity), although it is difficult to see why this would be done in Gritstone, where there is unlikely to be found any significant lateral development. Cateran Hole is reputed to have been a smugglers' hiding place,Brook, D.; Davies, G.M.; Long, M.H.; Ryder, P.F.: Northern Caves - Volume 1 Wharfedale and the North-East, Dalesman, 1988, p. 249 although locals claim that it once linked nearby Chillingham Castle with Hepburn. The latter seems an unlikely conclusion as it tends in the direction of neither, while the carved stone steps favour the former.

It was produced by Richard S. Flink, directed by William Gref√©, and written by Al Dempsey. The movie stars Joe Morrison, Valerie Hawkins, John Vella, and Jack Nagle, with Neil Sedaka heard performing the pop dance song \\"Do the Jellyfish.\\" Sting of Death was paired on a double bill with the Gref√© film Death Curse of Tartu (1966). Its plot concerns five female college students who head to the Florida Everglades for a holiday, but instead of fun in the sun, run into trouble with a mutated, bloodthirsty, and quite deadly jellyfish-man-monster. Plot A young blonde woman in a black bikini lies on a dock in Florida, sunbathing and listening to her transistor radio. She turns it off after hearing a news report about unexplained local murders. Then, without warning, a monstrous hand reaches up from the water and grabs her ankle, dragging her under, where she drowns. Meanwhile, five of six college friends arrive at the home of Dr. Richardson (Nagel), the father of one of them, Karen (Hawkins). Richardson is a marine biologist who studies the \\"evolution of sea life\\" with his assistant, Dr. John Hoyt (Morrison). Karen and the others - Louise (Sandy Lee Kane), Jessica (Deanna Lund), Donna (Lois Etelman), and Susan (Blanche Devreaux) - are staying at Dr. Richardson's house. But they all wonder why Ruth (Judy Lee), who had gotten there earlier, hasn't joined them on the patio for a cold glass of orange drink. Several raucous college students who have been invited to a pool party show up by boat. They taunt Richardson's mildly facially disfigured helper Egon (Vella), who is secretly in love with Karen. Unfortunately for him, Karen has fallen for John. But Egon can take revenge for all the wrongs done him by turning himself into a half-man half-jellyfish monster. He picks off the girls one by one: Ruth was the woman killed while sunbathing; Louise is seriously injured in an attack in the pool during the party; Donna dies while being chased through a swamp; Jessica is killed during the search for Donna; and Susan is murdered while having a shower. Many of the other students die when their boat sinks - the monster has chopped a hole in its hull with an axe - and they're attacked by a school of Portuguese Man O' War jellyfish. Egon forces Karen to swim to his secret laboratory in an underwater cave. There, he shows her an enormous Portuguese Man O' War in an aquarium that is connected to the machine he uses to transform himself from man to monster. John fatally injures the now-transformed Egon during a fight and rescues Karen. Just as she and John surface, the machine explodes, finishing off Egon and his evil alter ego.

Regional films in general \\"were conceived, produced and often distributed entirely in corners of the country not typically associated with the entertainment industry - from the backwoods of Utah to the bayous of Louisiana to the outer boroughs of New York. Made with little regard to genre convention, or in some cases even any basic knowledge of filmmaking, by the 1970s\\" - just a few years after Sting of Death was made - \\"these regional indies were at the vanguard of horror cinema.\\" Such films were made on low budgets with actors (often amateurs) and crews who were local to the shooting location. In this movie the Everglades and nearby locations in southern Florida were used as exteriors, while interior filming was done at the home of producer Flink. Underwater sequences were shot at Rainbow Springsthe same site used for Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954). Although listed in the credits as \\"Special Singing Guest Star,\\" Sedaka does not physically appear in the movie. He is only heard singing \\"Do the Jellyfish\\" as the students perform the dance during the pool party. The song is included on the Sedaka LP Oh Carol: The Complete Recordings 1955-1966, released on Bear Family Records in 2003.  Release  In the US, the double bill of Death Curse of Tartu and Sting of Death \\"played nationwide in 1967 and did fairly well,\\" according to \\"actor/stuntman/amateur makeup artist Doug Hobart.\\" For release in the UK, Sting of Death was granted an X-certificate by the BBFC on 10 June 1968. The UK version of the film was cut to a running time of 78 minutes 13 seconds, although details of the exact nature of the cuts are not available. The X-cert meant the film could only be shown to persons age 16 or older.  Distribution  The film was distributed in the US by Thunderbird International Pictures to help fulfill an annual need for inexpensive horror double features which were timed to coincide with 15 April, the traditional season opening of drive-ins in the northern part of the country. UK distribution was handled by Borden Films. Sting of Death was released for home viewing in 2001 as a VHS single film and on DVD as a double feature with Death Curse of Tartu. Both were distributed by Something Weird Video. A new restoration of the movie by Arrow Films premiered at the Fantasia Film Festival in Montr√©al, Quebec, Canada, which ran 20 August through 2 September 2020. The restored Sting of Death is to be included as part of the Blu-ray boxed set He Came from the Swamp: The William Gref√© Collection, scheduled for release on 23 November 2020. The other films in the set are Death Curse of Tartu, The Hooked Generation (1968), The Psychedelic Priest (1971), The Naked Zoo (1971), Mako: Jaws of Death (1976), Whiskey Mountain (1978), and They Came from the Swamp, an updated version of the 2009 documentary about Gref√© and his movies.  Reception  A 1967 review in BoxOffice says that the film is \\"very much in keeping with the youth-oriented horror market\\" of the time, well-made enough to earn a \\"good\\" rating - on its Very Good-to-Very Poor scale - and that Gref√© \\"has generated a surprisingly strong mass market appeal pattern and, for good measure, headliner Neil Sedaka is present in the capacity of singing guest star.\\" BoxOffice calls Morrison, Hawkins, and Vella \\"professionally poised in pivotal roles\\" and says that Nagle \\"provides some interesting moments.\\" On the other hand, film historian Phil Hardy has little positive to say about Sting of Death. He opines that Hawkins is a \\"wooden heroine\\" and Morrison a \\"hard-headed hero,\\" and calls the film an \\"unimaginative piece of low-budget Science Fiction.\\" TVGuide.com uses the similar phrase \\"mindless science fiction\\" in its brief description of the movie. Critic Fred Beldin of Allmovie.com is even more damning. He writes that Sting of Death is a \\"peculiar sci-fi calamity,\\" a movie that is \\"wrong-headed, absurd, and unintentionally funny\\" but one that will nonetheless \\"thrill lovers of trash cinema and confuse everyone else.\\" He is of the opinion that Gref√© \\"films the dance sequences with special attention paid to his female subjects' posteriors, suggesting an almost Russ Meyers-like appreciation of this portion\\" of their anatomy. Beldin also notes that the \\"succession of unlikely events and robotic actors\\" are all filmed \\"in blazing color.\\" In an interview, Gref√© attributes the latter to the \\"glare off the ocean [that] really lends itself to beautiful photography\\" and to \\"cameramen back then [who] believed in putting color in\\" as many shots as possible. Besides writing that Sting of Death has an \\"overabundance of mundane dialogue and amateurish acting, film historian Bryan Senn makes special note of the Jellyfish Man costume. He quotes Hobart, the man inside the costume, as saying that \\"The monster suit cost about $300 to make\\" and took about two weeks to complete. However, Senn points out, \\"In fact, it looks just like what it really is - a man in a crusty, dirty wetsuit and flippers, with plastic cords hanging from his shoulders and a clear hefty bag inflated over his head.\\" Gref√© seems to agree with Senn, saying in an interview, \\"Now if you tried to release that in the theaters, they'd stone you to death in the lobby. Back in those days, it wasn't too bad. You could get away with a lot of stuff on the low-budget pictures.\\"  See Also  *List of American films of 1965 References External links * Category:1965 films Category:1965 horror films Category:American films Category:American monster movies Category:Films directed by William Grefe Category:1960s monster movies ","title":"Sting of Death"},{"id":"23889797","text":"A semiconductor package is a metal, plastic, glass, or ceramic casing containing one or more discrete semiconductor devices or integrated circuits. Individual components are fabricated on semiconductor wafers (commonly silicon) before being diced into die, tested, and packaged. The package provides a means for connecting it to the external environment, such as printed circuit board, via leads such as lands, balls, or pins; and protection against threats such as mechanical impact, chemical contamination, and light exposure. Additionally, it helps dissipate heat produced by the device, with or without the aid of a heat spreader. There are thousands of package types in use. Some are defined by international, national, or industry standards, while others are particular to an individual manufacturer. Package functions A semiconductor package may have as few as two leads or contacts for devices such as diodes, or in the case of advanced microprocessors, a package may have hundreds of connections. Very small packages may be supported only by their wire leads. Larger devices, intended for high-power applications, are installed in carefully designed heat sinks so that they can dissipate hundred or thousands of watts of waste heat. In addition to providing connections to the semiconductor and handling waste heat, the semiconductor package must protect the \\"chip\\" from the environment, particularly the ingress of moisture. Stray particles or corrosion products inside the package may degrade performance of the device or cause failure.Lloyd P.Hunter (ed.), Handbook of Semiconductor Electronics, McGraw Hill, 1956 ,Library of Congress catalog 56-6869, no ISBN chapter 9 A hermetic package allows essentially no gas exchange with the surroundings; such construction requires glass, ceramic or metal enclosures. This replica of the first laboratory transistor shows connecting leads and a glass jar for protection; packaging the device was critical to its success. = Date code = Manufacturers usually print  using ink or laser marking  the manufacturer's logo and the manufacturer's part number on the package, to make it easier to distinguish the many different and incompatible devices packaged in relatively few kinds of packages. The markings often include a 4 digit date code, often represented as YYWW where YY is replaced by the last 2 digits of the calendar year and WW is replaced by the two-digit week number.Texas Instruments. ‚ÄúQuality & Lead-free (Pb-free): Marking Convention.‚Äù Retrieved August 6, 2015. Vintage Calculators Web Museum: Frequently Asked Questions: \\"Date codes on electronics components and circuit boards\\". Retrieved 2020-04-23. Leads To make connections between an integrated circuit and the leads of the package, wire bonds are used, with fine wires connected from the package leads and bonded to conductive pads on the semiconductor die. At the outside of the package, wire leads may be soldered to a printed circuit board or used to secure the device to a tag strip. Modern surface mount devices eliminate most of the drilled holes through circuit boards, and have short metal leads or pads on the package that can be secured by oven-reflow soldering. Aerospace devices in flat packs may use flat metal leads secured to a circuit board by spot welding, though this type of construction is now uncommon. Sockets Early semiconductor devices were often inserted in sockets, like vacuum tubes. As devices improved, eventually sockets proved unnecessary for reliability, and devices were directly soldered to printed circuit boards. The package must handle the high temperature gradients of soldering without putting stress on the semiconductor die or its leads. Sockets are still used for experimental, prototype, or educational applications, for testing of devices, for high-value chips such as microprocessors where replacement is still more economical than discarding the product, and for applications where the chip contains firmware or unique data that might be replaced or refreshed during the life of the product. Devices with hundreds of leads may be inserted in zero insertion force sockets, which are also used on test equipment or device programmers. Package materials Many devices are molded out of an epoxy plastic that provides adequate protection of the semiconductor devices, and mechanical strength to support the leads and handling of the package. Some devices, intended for high-reliability or aerospace or radiation environments, use ceramic packages, with metal lids that are brazed on after assembly, or a glass frit seal. All-metal packages are often used with high power (several watts or more) devices, since they conduct heat well and allow for easy assembly to a heat sink. Often the package forms one contact for the semiconductor device. Lead materials must be chosen with a thermal coefficient of expansion to match the package material. A very few early semiconductors were packed in miniature evacuated glass envelopes, like flashlight bulbs; such expensive packaging was made obsolete when surface passivation and improved manufacturing techniques were available. Glass packages are still commonly used with diodes, and glass seals are used in metal transistor packages. Package materials for high-density dynamic memory must be selected for low background radiation; a single alpha particle emitted by package material can cause a single event upset and transient memory errors (soft errors). Spaceflight and military applications traditionally used hermetically packaged microcircuits (HPMs). However, most modern integrated circuits are only available as plastic encapsulated microcircuits (PEMs). Proper fabrication practices using properly qualified PEMs can be used for spaceflight.Ronald K. Burek, Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest. ‚ÄúThe NEAR Solid-State Data Recorders.‚Äù 1998. Retrieved August 6, 2015. Hybrid integrated circuits A hybrid integrated circuit Multiple semiconductor dies and discrete components can be assembled on a ceramic substrate and interconnected with wire bonds. The substrate bears leads for connection to an external circuit, and the whole is covered with a welded or frit cover. Such devices are used when requirements exceed the performance (heat dissipation, noise, voltage rating, leakage current, or other properties) available in a single-die integrated circuit, or for mixing analog and digital functions in the same package. Such packages are relatively expensive to manufacture, but provide most of the other benefits of integrated circuits. A modern example of multi-chip integrated circuit packages would be certain models of microprocessor, which may include separate dies for such things as cache memory within the same package. In a technique called flip chip, digital integrated circuit dies are inverted and soldered to a module carrier, for assembly into large systems.Keyan Bennaceur, Nature.com. ‚ÄúMechanical Flip-Chip for Ultra-High Electron Mobility Devices.‚Äù September 22, 2015. April 23, 2015. The technique was applied by IBM in their System/360 computers.Michael Pecht (ed) Integrated circuit, hybrid, and multichip module package design guidelines: a focus on reliability, Wiley-IEEE, 1994 , page 183 Special packages Semiconductor packages may include special features. Light-emitting or light-sensing devices must have a transparent window in the package; other devices such as transistors may be disturbed by stray light and require an opaque package. An ultraviolet erasable programmable read-only memory device needs a quartz window to allow ultraviolet light to enter and erase the memory. Pressure-sensing integrated circuits require a port on the package that can be connected to a gas or liquid pressure source. Packages for microwave frequency devices are arranged to have minimal parasitic inductance and capacitance in their leads. Very-high-impedance devices with ultralow leakage current require packages that do not allow stray current to flow, and may also have guard rings around input terminals. Special isolation amplifier devices include high-voltage insulating barriers between input and output, allowing connection to circuits energized at 1 kV or more. The very first point-contact transistors used metal cartridge-style packages with an opening that allowed adjustment of the whisker used to make contact with the germanium crystal; such devices were common for only a brief time since more reliable, less labor-intensive types were developed. Standards Just like vacuum tubes, semiconductor packages standards may be defined by national or international industry associations such as JEDEC, Pro Electron, or EIAJ, or may be proprietary to a single manufacturer.

Life He was the son of Thomas Winston, a carpenter, of Painswick, Gloucestershire, and his wife Judith, daughter of Roger Lancaster of Hertfordshire. He graduated M.A. at Clare Hall, Cambridge in 1602, and continued a fellow of that college till 1617. He then studied medicine at Padua, where he attended the lectures of Fabricius ab Aquapendente, and at Basle, where he became a pupil of Caspar Bauhin. He graduated M.D. at Padua, and was incorporated M.D. at Cambridge in 1608. He was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians in London on 9 March 1610, a candidate or member on 10 September 1613, and was elected a fellow on 20 March 1615. He was ten times censor between 1622 and 1637. He was an active member of the Virginia Company, regularly attending its meetings in London until October 1621, and acting as one of the editors of A Declaration of the State of the Colonie and Affaires in Virginia, published in 1620. He was elected Professor of Physic at Gresham College on 25 October 1615, and held office till 1642. He then went abruptly to France, but returned in 1652. William Lenthall wrote to the Gresham committee on his behalf, and on 20 August 1652 he was restored to his professorship, which he held till his death. He had a large practice as a physician, and always kept an apothecary, who followed him humbly. He died on 24 October 1655. Works His works show anatomical reading as well as a practical acquaintance with the anatomy of man and of animals. He was well read in Galen and in Latin literature and Meric Casaubon praised his learning. After his death his Anatomy Lectures were published in London in 1659 and 1664. He made no original discoveries, held the old erroneous opinion that there are openings in the septum between the ventricles, showed no acquaintance with William Harvey's work on the circulation of the blood, and believed that the arteries transmit vital spirit elaborated in the left ventricle as well as blood.

It became available for download from PlayStation Store as a PSone Classic for play on the PlayStation 3 on January 10, 2008, in PAL regions. The game utilizes 3D environments and truck models. The soundtrack features hard rock music. Gameplay Screenshot from Hardcore 4X4 Hardcore 4x4 is an off-road racing game. The player controls a 4x4 like a Jeep or pickup truck around 3D cross-country loops and attempts to get to the finish line first. There are six different vehicles to choose from, each with differing handling, acceleration and suspension settings. Circuits have differing surfaces for the player to contend with, including tarmac, dirt, sand and ice. Weather conditions can be changed to add another challenge to the game. There are three race types. In single race mode players participate in only one race on a track of their choice against five other competitors. In championship mode, players race through all six courses in a row in an attempt to win a Mother truck. Time trial lets up to eight players compete round-robin style for the fastest lap time around a track. Hardcore 4x4 also includes a hidden game called Roids, an Asteroids clone, accessible with a cheat code. Development In order to accurately model 4X4 vehicles, the developers separated the wheels off into four sections which would respond independently to the environment. The PlayStation and Saturn versions were developed simultaneously. Reception Todd Mowatt and Joe Rybicki of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the Saturn version \\"4x4 racing at its best\\" and \\"one of the most realistic games I've ever seen.\\" They both praised the track design and inclusion of weather, though they felt the inability to drive off the tracks was inappropriate and frustrating.Electronic Gaming Monthly issue 90, January 1997, page 222. Bonehead of GamePro called the gameplay too slow, and additionally criticized the pixelization, lack of detail, and low frame rate.Gamepro issue 104, May 1997, page 95. Sega Saturn Magazines Rad Automatic was pleased with the concept, noting, \\"Instead of just having to take corners and go really fast, in Hardcore you have to read the track, take the lines of least resistance, avoid too-steep slopes, not fall over and not bounce around too much.\\" However, he found fault with the execution, citing the slow gameplay, low frame rate, clipping, and lack of inertia during collisions. He concluded that the game would be entertaining for off-road enthusiasts but not general audiences, and expressed a desire to see an improved sequel. Reviewing the PlayStation version, Air Hendrix of GamePro commented that \\"the basic action and squirrelly handling prevent 4X4 from building addictive gameplay. Worse, there's no real-life licenses or two- player action.\\" He also cited breakup, redraw problems, and cheesy music. A reviewer for Next Generation said the game successfully simulates the handling of a 4x4 truck, but that the narrow tracks allow a player to easily block opponents from passing them once they get in the lead, greatly reducing the racing excitement. Like EGMs reviewers, he considered the inability to drive off the tracks inappropriate and \\"just plain annoying\\". GameSpot criticized the game's track design as having \\"drab colors and textures\\" and for being \\"far too narrow\\" and said that the lack of a map or overhead view makes the game a lot more difficult than it would have been with such a feature included. IGN said that \\"The trucks themselves handle very well\\" and \\"the physics of the jumps and bumps are very nice\\", but that the graphics are \\"incredibly grainy\\", and the narrow circuits are a problem.

Hunter was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1878 and received his early education in local public schools. He completed his Secondary education at Auckland Grammar School. He attended Auckland University College, where he earned his Bachelor's in 1900, and his Master's degree in 1902, and later studied at University College, London, earning a Doctor of Science degree, and at various other European universities. He met his future wife Mary Pond in Europe, as a fellow student, and married after traveling to America. He became employed at the research laboratories of General Electric, where he began his research into Titanium. Following the recession of 1908, he left GE and became a professor of Electrical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. Background Titanium was discovered in 1791 by William Gregor but proved difficult to isolate. It was isolated to 95% purity by Lars Nilson and Otto Pettersson, and later isolated to 98% purity by Henri Moissan using an electric furnace. In 1910, Hunter produced 99.9% pure titanium in a method that became known as the Hunter Process. The process involves heating Titanium Chloride with metallic Sodium in an airtight steel cylinder known as a \\"metal bomb\\". Because of the dangers of elemental Sodium and the high temperatures and pressures involved, many of the experiments were done outside on the football field of the RPI campus. Hunter believed titanium might have a high melting point and would be able to replace the carbon filaments that were used in light bulbs at the time. It turned out its melting point was not high enough for application in light bulbs, but he found other useful properties of the metal. The Hunter process is very inefficient, and is not able to produce large amounts of Titanium, so production of Titanium remained mainly confined to the laboratory until being replaced by the more efficient Kroll process in the 1940s. The Hunter process remains of use only in the most demanding applications where high purity is needed. Hunter served for five years as head of the Department of Electrical Engineering, and helped found the Department of Metallurgical Engineering. He served as head of the Department of Metallurgical Engineering from 1935-1947 and became Dean of Faculty in 1943. The department of Metallurgical Engineering was eventually transformed into the Department of Materials Engineering. He received an honorary doctorate from RPI in 1949. In 1959, Dr. Hunter received the Gold Medal of the American Society of Metals in recognition of a lifetime devoted to advancing metallurgical and engineering education. The Matthew Albert Hunter Prize in Metallurgical Engineering was established at RPI in 1951. He died March 24, 1961 in Troy at the age of 82. He was inducted into RPI's Alumni Hall of Fame in 2009.

Born into a musical family, Sillamaa was herself onstage from a very young age: in the musical theatre Colombina, founded by her mother Kaari Sillamaa, she played lead roles in many children's musicals, including \\"Thumbelina\\" and a revue programme \\"Mini-Cabaret\\". In 1993 Sillamaa performed at the Roskilde Festival. She was then a student in the pop-jazz department of the Georg Ots Music School in Tallinn, where her vocal-coaches were Jaak Joala and Kare Kauks. In 1992 Sillamaa was internally chosen to represent Estonia at Eurovision 1993 - Estonia's first Eurovision participation - with Sillammaa performing eight potential entrant songs in a national preliminary round televised live as Eurolaul 1993 on 20 February 1993. The song selected for Sillamaa to perform as the Estonian Eurovision entrant was \\"Muretut meelt ja s√ºdametuld\\". With representatives of six other former Eastern bloc nations and nations of former Yugoslavia, Sillamaa performed \\"Muretut meelt ja s√ºdametuld\\" at the Kvalifikacija za Millstreet semi-final round broadcast live on 3 April 1993 in Ljubljana, when four of the seven competing entrants were eliminated, including \\"Muretut meelt ja s√ºdametuld\\" which finished the round at #5. In 1992 Sillamaa played her first adult role in a stage musical: Mary Magdalene Jesus Christ Superstar at the Linnahall. Having recorded a few singles as vocalist for rock group the Names from 1995, Sillamaa again participated in Eurolaul in 1998 bidding to represent Estonia at Eurovision with \\"Viimne valge kuu\\" a song composed by Sillamaa's mother Kaari which finished Eurolaul 1998 in fourth place. In 2000 Sillamaa commenced studies at the Higher Drama School of Estonia intending to complete a four-year programme in stage directing. Only a matter of months before her graduation, however, a red card was shown for delicate reasons, possibly. Neither of the sides, nor the commission or the drop-out herself have yet agreed to reveal on the matter. Despite the controversy over the diploma she was never awarded, Sillamaa has since directed stage plays on a regular basis. The 2000s (decade) also mark another turn to Janika Sillamaa's career. Several lead roles of blockbuster musicals have come on her credit, such as Elton John\`s \\"Aida\\" (title role), Ulvaeus- Andersson\`s \\"Chess\\" (Svetlana), Sch√∂nberg-Boublil\`s \\"Miss Saigon\\" (Ellen) and Webber\`s \\"Cats\\" to name a few. In 2009, she formed a rock band, Famagusta, with friends and recorded a single, Rong, which she described as an anthem for women in their 30s. Janika Sillamaa has settled in Tallinn.

In 1978 he met Paul Gillman and the Picozzi (Giancarlo and Giorgio) brothers, who were trying to form a band and they asked Marshall to join the group. The name of the band was Power Age, considered the pioneer of the Heavy Metal music in Venezuela. This band played covers of stars like Aerosmith, Judas Priest, Kiss and AC/DC. Freddy did not want to play covers, and through his leadership, the band began to include original material in their repertoire. The first original song performed by Power Age was a theme called \\"Paper Life\\", composed by Freddy Marshall during his stay in Equos Reverber Band. For the next two years the band made several nationwide tours which attracted a large following among hard rock and metal fans. This caught the attention of various record labels, one of which, COLOR, offered them a contract to produce and record four albums. In 1980, Power Age changed its name to Arkangel and for the next 23 years the musical career of Freddy Marshall remained tied to the band. During this time, the band recorded seven albums with Marshall composing some of the most powerful songs included in them. Songs like \\"El Vagon de la Muerte\\", \\"Nada es Eterno\\", \\"Despierta America\\", \\"La Procesion de Satanas\\", \\"Paper Life, \\"El Juicio Final\\" among others, became a kind of trade mark for the band\`s musical style. Arkangel shared stage with Scorpions, Joe Perry Project, Bar√≥n Rojo, Harlequim, Wrabbit, REO Speedwagon and Rick Wakeman when these artists performed in Venezuela, the band also took part in the Rom√°n Chalbaud's motion picture called \\"Cangrejo\\", with some of their songs being included in the sound track and appearing in some scenes of the film. In addition to his work as musician, Marshall was the executive producer on the Arkangel's \\"No M√°s Apariencias\\", \\"Inmortal\\" and \\"El Angel de la Muerte\\" albums. In 2003 after a long and successful career, Freddy Marshall left Arkangel. In 2013 after a long retirement, Freddy Marshall takes up again his career as producer releasing a new album called \\"Hard Times\\", including some of the best songs composed during his long stay in Arkangel. In March 2020 Fred Marshall released his first solo album called Iron Horse, containing 8 new songs.

It was engaged in development and commercialization of proprietary underground coal gasification technology. Produced gas was used for production of synthetic fuel through gas-to-liquid technology, and has been planned also to be used for power generation. The company had its headquarters in Brisbane, Queensland. In April 2016 the company was placed into voluntary administration. At the second creditors meeting in May 2016 the unanimous vote was for the company to be liquidated. History Linc Energy was incorporated on 29 October 1996 as Linc Energy N.L. On 17 November 2000, it changed its name to Linc Energy Ltd. It listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on 10 May 2006 and on the OTCQX in New York in December 2007. On 19 December 2013, Linc Energy delisted from the ASX and listed on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange. Linc started its Chinchilla Demonstration Facility in July 1999. First gas was produced in that very same year. Initially Linc Energy used the underground coal gasification technology worked out by Ergo Exergy Technologies, Inc, of Canada. However, in 2006 the cooperation with Ergo Exergy was terminated and the cooperation agreement for technology usage, consultation and engineering services was signed with the Skochinsky Institute of Mining and the Scientific-Technical Mining Association of Russia. In 2005, Linc signed a memorandum with Syntroleum granting a licence to use the Syntroleum's proprietary gas-to-liquid technology and started to build a GTL pilot plant in November 2007 at the Chinchilla facility. The plant was commissioned in August 2008. The first synthetic crude was produced in October 2008. In November 2007, Linc Energy, in cooperation with BioCleanCoal Pty Ltd, established a joint venture to develop a prototype bioreactor for converting carbon dioxide through a photosynthesis into oxygen and solid biomass. On 20 December 2007, Linc Energy acquired a 60% stake and later increased it to 91.6% in Uzbekistan's underground coal gasification company SPC Yerostigaz. On 15 October 2008, a South Australian oil and gas company SAPEX Limited was merged with Linc Energy. This acquisition provided Linc Energy with tenements in the Arckaringa, St Vincent and Walloway basins. In 2009, Linc Energy purchased from GasTech IncNorth American coal tenements in Montana (Powder River Basin), Wyoming, and North Dakota. In 2010, Linc Energy acquired tenements in the Cook Inlet Basin in Alaska from GeoPetro Alaska. At the same year, it sold non-core Emerald, Galilee and Pentland coal mining tenements in Queensland to Adani Mining Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Adani Group. In October 2010, Linc Energy acquires 10% stake in the UK-based alkaline fuel cell company AFC Energy and in 2011, it increased its stake up to 12%. In the cooperation with AFC Energy and B9 Coal, the company commissioned a hydrogen fuel cell named Alfa System at Chinchilla. Combining the fuel cell technology with the underground coal gasification allows usage of hydrogen, produced by the underground coal gasification process, as a feedstock for the fuel cell. In 2011, it acquired three producing oil fields from Rancher Energy, 14 oil fields from ERG Resources, and purchased Renaissance LLC to take control in the Umiat oil field. In April 2012, Linc Energy partnered with a subsidiary of Hong Kong listed Golden Concord Holdings (GCL) to commercialise fuel using its UGC to GTC technology in China. Golden Concord purchased a 5% stake in the company for 120 million Australian dollars (US$124 million). On 23 January 2013, Linc Energy announced the discovery of tight oil resource surrounding Coober Pedy estimated at between of oil. At the same year, their subsidiary New Emerald Coal bought the Blair Athol coal mine. In July 2014, the company announced that it had gained initial approval from the Ministry of Environment of Poland to commence an underground coal gasification project and that the company has been awarded its third coal exploration license in Poland. Also in July 2014, Linc Energy announced plans to commence drilling wells to prove up deeper parts of the Arckaringa Basin. On 16 April 2016 the company was placed into voluntary administration with some claims in the media this has been done to avoid fines from the Queensland Government.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-15/linc-energy-goes-into- voluntary-administration/7331154 PPB Advisory has been appointed as the administrator.https://www.ppbadvisory.com/creditor-information/v/427/linc- energy-ltd On 13 May 2016 the administrators announced that in their opinion the company should be liquidated.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-13/administrators-of-linc- energy-recommend-the-company-liquidated/7414126 At the second creditors meeting on 23 May 2016 the unanimous vote was for the company to be liquidated.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-23/linc-energy-to-go-into- liquidation-creditors-vote/7437382 Operations Linc Energy had business interests in Australia, North America, the United Kingdom, Poland, South Africa, China, Vietnam and Uzbekistan. In addition to the underground coal gasification, the company was active in traditional coal mining and oil and gas exploration and production. The company owned and operated the Chinchilla Demonstration Facility west of Brisbane, which was the world's first gas-to- liquid plant operating on synthesis gas produced by underground coal gasification. The facility hosted five underground coal gas generators, a GTL pilot plant, a laboratory, and a wastewater treatment plant. Linc Energy also planned to build a gas-to-liquid plant on the Arckaringa Basin in South Australia. The plant was to be designed by Aker Solutions and it was to be fed by synthesis gas produced by underground coal gasification. BP had an option to buy 70% of the produced diesel fuel. In the Yining mining area in China, Linc Energy planned to develop a coal gasification project in cooperation with Xinwen Mining Group. Together with Vinacomin, Song Hong Energy and Marubeni, Linc prepared the Red River Delta UCG (UCG Tonkin) project in Hung Yen, Vietnam. Linc Energy cooperated with UK Coal in the UK and Exxaro in South Africa. It had a coal exploration lease in the Upper Silesia Coal Basin, Poland. In December 2012, it started cooperation with Ukrainian energy company DTEK to evaluate potential of the underground coal gasification on the DTEK's local coal resources. Linc Energy located had a subsidiary in Angren, Uzbekistan called Yerostigaz. Yerostigaz was established in 1961 and operated in the field of underground coal gasification. It produced about one million cubic meters of syngas per day. The produced syngas was used as fuel in the Angren Power Station. Controversy In Australia in 2014 the Queensland Government filed charges over alleged serious environmental harm stemming from Chinchilla Facility.http://www.governmentnews.com.au/2014/04/queensland- government-hits-underground-coal-gasification-player-linc-energy- environmental-damage-charges/ Linc Energy reported that these charges are not material to the company's finances or operations and that it would staunchly defend allegations.http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/132612/Linc_Energy_Stands_Firm_in_Environmental_Dispute_with_Queensland_Government/?pgNum=1#sthash.k3X1Fplj.dpuf In April 2018, Linc Energy was found guilty of causing serious environmental harm and the following month was fined $4.5 million. The court was told that groundwater underneath its plant in Hopeland, will take 20 years to recover from the leakage of toxic chemicals, such as BTEX. It was also alleged by a whistle blower, that the government ignored warnings and put the company's profits above the environment.

It tells the converging narratives of five troubled teenage protagonists. The novel is noted for its gritty realism in addressing issues of sexual activity and drug use for a young adult readership. This book has also been banned due to drug uses, sexual themes, and language. Plot In the novel Tricks, the story begins with five teenagers, all residing in various parts of the United States. The first character, Eden Streit, lives with her father, mother, and younger sister, Eve. Being a daughter of a minister also comes with expectations, such as not having sex until marriage and marrying men within the Christian faith. But for Eden, that doesn‚Äôt matter with Andrew, her boyfriend. Her only problem is trying to keep their relationship a secret from her parents. The second character, Seth Parnel, lives with his father after his mother dies from cancer a year and a half ago. Seth struggles with identifying his sexuality after he breaks up with his girlfriend, Janet Winkler. He meets Loren and is catapulted into a new kind of relationship. The third character, Cody Bennet, doesn‚Äôt know who his biological father is and spends his time with his step-father Jack. Jack hasn‚Äôt been feeling well, and Cody starts to drink. The fourth character, Whitney Lang, lives with her mother, while her father works and lives in another city nearby and her sister, Kyra, attends college. Whitney is disconnected with her mother and likes when her dad is home since she sees him as her hero. Whitney hooks up with Lucas at one of Kyra‚Äôs performances and they hit it off, but she still worries about committing to the relationship with him. The fifth character, Ginger Cordell, encounters rape from an early childhood and deals with keeping these secrets from her family. Ginger‚Äôs only friend is Alex, and she has begun questioning how she feels about her. Eden‚Äôs parents finds out about her relationship with Andrew, and assumes that she is being controlled by the devil, and so she is sent to Tears of Zion. There, she is being kept in captivity and forced to do work that would supposedly rid her of evil. She starts giving a worker named Jerome sex in exchange for food, shampoo, and other treats. She hopes that Jerome can be the key to her escape. Loren moves away and leaves Seth, and Seth‚Äôs dad finds out he is gay, so he kicks him out of the house. He goes to live with Carl, an older man he met at a bar, and moves with him to Vegas as his companion. Lucas leaves Whitney by dumping her after taking her virginity, and she turns to Bryn for support. She gives herself to him, and leaves her family to move with him to Vegas for his photography business. Ginger‚Äôs brother, Sandy, is run over by a motorcycle, and Gram goes with him to the hospital. Ginger is raped again by one of her mother‚Äôs boyfriends, and she finds out that Iris is charging them to have sex with her. She takes her mother‚Äôs money and leaves with her friend, Alex, and they go to stay with Alex‚Äôs aunt, Lydia, in Vegas. Cody‚Äôs step-father, Jack, dies from cancer, and Cody takes on the responsibility of paying for bills. He gets deep into online gambling, drifting away from Ronnie, whom he believes he loves. Eden manages to escape with the help of Jerome and decides to ditch him at a gas station. She succeeds, and gets rides from truck drivers to Vegas. She uses sex for money and means of survival until she finds a place that helps young people in similar situations. She finds Andrew‚Äôs mother‚Äôs e-mail, and sends her a message. Andrew‚Äôs mother replies, and Andrew sends a message shortly after. They both express relief that she is alive, and hope to see her again soon. Seth becomes attracted to Jared, a man he meets in the gym, and they have sex. Carl reveals that he had paid Jared to act as bait, and kicks Seth out. Seth goes online and looks for a new man to stay with. Bryn is revealed to have acted a certain way to get Whitney to fall in love with him. He cheats on Whitney, forces her to record their sex and have sex with other people, and gets her addicted to drugs. Toward the end of the book, the author seems to make Whitney to be losing more of herself. One night, she takes an overdose and ends up in the hospital with her family around her. Her mother cries for her and says that she wants them to have a better relationship now, and that she does care about her. Whitney‚Äôs father is angry, and her sister is said to be angry that Whitney stole all of the attention. Lydia sets up Alex and Ginger in the stripping business, and that becomes how they get money and a place to stay. Sex becomes less about love and more about surviving. They get arrested because they were discovered by Vegas Vice, and they are sent to a place that was supposed to help them get their life back together. Ginger calls Gram and finds out that Iris is dying from an STD. She decides to go back home and take care of her siblings. Alex stays. She is revealed to be pregnant, and she says that she will be a better mother to her child than Ginger or Alex‚Äôs mothers were to them. Cody gets into business with Lydia, partnering up with Misty occasionally in having sex with men. He does not believe himself to be gay, but he is described as feeling that he has to do anything to get money and support the rest of his family. His relationship with Ronnie becomes distant, and he hopes that she would find a better man who deserves her. On one of their ‚Äúdates‚Äù, Misty‚Äôs boyfriend, Chris, finds them almost naked with their client. He is expressed as being very angry with Misty, and he attacks them, putting them in the hospital. Cody wakes up occasionally there, and Misty and their client are revealed to be dead. Cody hears voices while he is partially conscious. He hears his mother speaking to him, comforting him, and begging him not to leave her.

Style Karin's Book Nook complimented the author's work in the novel by saying \\"Ellen Hopkins, once again, comes through for her readers with this spellbinding novel-in-verse.\\" Additionally, Kirkus adds that \\"Hopkins's pithy free verse reveals shards of emotion and quick glimpses of physical details. It doesn't matter that the first-person voices blur, because the stories are distinct and unmistakable.\\" Theme One reviewer explained that \\"[Tricks] shows the bad decisions teenagers make.\\" Kirkus also added that Tricks is about \\"[g]raphic sex, rape, drugs, bitter loneliness, despair - and eventually, blessedly, glimmers of hope.\\" Reception The School Library Journal praised Tricks as \\"[a] graphic, intense tale that will speak to mature teens.\\" Karin's Book Nook said, \\"Ellen Hopkins utilizes her trademark realistic voice; there isn't any sugar-coating of the subject matter here to weave the story of five total strangers to form a heartbreaking look at what some people are forced to do simply to survive.\\" Also, Publishers Weekly commented that \\"[e]ach story is unique (one teen needs money, another was thrown out because of his sexuality, still another was simply looking for love from the wrong person); while readers may connect with some characters more than others, they will long remember each painful story.\\" References Category:2009 American novels Category:Verse novels Category:Novels by Ellen Hopkins Category:American young adult novels ","title":"Tricks (novel)"},{"id":"23890234","text":"Amp√©re is a municipality in the state of Paran√° in the Southern Region of Brazil.

The Scottish Surnames of Colonial America. Baltomore, MD: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2003 p. 108. Although there are many stories of its origin, an old theory explains that the name is a corruption of \\"Gomer's Mount\\" or \\"Gomer's Hill\\" (Latin: Mons Gomeris), any of a number of hills in Europe named in attribution to the biblical patriarch Gomer, but it does not explain the final -y or -ie (the phonetical evolution would have been *Montgomer(s), *Montgomier) and it does not correspond to the old mentions of the place name Montgommery in Normandie : Monte Gomeri in 1032‚Äì1035, de Monte Gomerico in 1040 and de Monte Gumbri in 1046‚Äì1048.Ernest N√®gre, Toponymie g√©n√©rale de la France, Librairie Droz, 1998, p. 1668, n¬∞ 29164 More relevant is the explanation by the Germanic first name Gumarik,Albert Dauzat, Charles Rostaing, Dictionnaire √©tymologique des noms de lieu en France, Librairie Gu√©n√©gaud, Paris, 1979, , p. 470b a compound of guma \\"man\\" (see bridegroom) and rik \\"powerful\\", that regularly gives the final -ry (-ri) in the French first names and surnames (as in Thierry, Amaury, Henry, etc.). Moreover, the name is still used as a surname in France as Gommery,G√©opatronyme : repartition of births with the surname Gommery in France from the older first name Gomeri.N√®gre, 1663 The earliest known person to be styled with the name is Roger de Montgomerie, found in a contemporary document as father of the 11th century Norman nobleman, Roger de Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, who owned the village of Montgommery, today in the Calvados d√©partement. Alternatively, a Hugh de Montgomery is given as the earl's father by a Norman chronicler writing in the next generation and some have hypothesized an error whereby Hugh is actually father of the elder Roger. The original family Counts de Montgomerie were prominent in early Anglo-Norman England and gave their name to Montgomeryshire in neighbouring Wales. In some cases, the surname of modern Montgomerys is probably derived from this Welsh place name (the Scottish Montgomerys for example). Seventeen counties in the United States of America as well as districts, neighbourhoods and streets around the world, have been named for people named Montgomery.

Kelly was a civil engineer by training and a consultant in the energy industry by profession. Politically he was a member of the Big Blue Machine, a group of advisers, organizers and strategists around Ontario Premier Bill Davis and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in the 1970s and 1980s. He was appointed to the Senate in 1982 by Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. At the time, the Liberals had been in power for almost all of the previous twenty years resulting in a steady decline in the number of Tory senators. Trudeau adopted a policy of replacing retiring Progressive Conservative Senators with other Progressive Conservatives in order to ensure the opposition caucus was large enough to be functional. The Leader of the Official Opposition would submit a short list of names from which the Prime Minister would choose an appointee for a vacant Tory Senate seat. Several senior Red Tories such as Joe Clark's chief of staff, Peter Harder as well as Norman Atkins, Hugh Segal and Bill Davis himself lobbied Clark to include Kelly on the short list and lobbied the Prime Minister's Office to choose Kelly from the list. As a Senator, Kelly served variously as caucus chairman and whip and served on various Senate committees, most notably as Chair of the Special Senate Committee on Security and Intelligence and the Special Senate Committee on Terrorism and the Public Safety. In the 1990s Kelly served as rapporteur and delegate on the second committee to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna. His Senate tenure was also notable for his having introduced a procedural intervention that succeeded in putting an end to the filibuster and the passing of the GST (Goods and Services Tax) bill in late 1990s. On his mandatory retirement from the Senate in 2000, Senate colleagues of both parties in the Senate lauded his distaste for partisanship and gentlemanly attributes. World War II During World War II, Kelly served as a lieutenant, of the Second Field Engineer Regiment. Affiliations/honours Kelly also served as a director of the Council on Drug Abuse, chairman of the Board of Governors at Ryerson Polytechnic University and co-chairman of a 1984 task force on Crown corporations. He also served for a period as Chairman of the Board of Rothmans Benson & Hedges Inc. He was a director of numerous national and international companies and financial institutions, governor of the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame and a commander of the Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem (CLJ).

A de Bruyne and built by Aero Research Limited (ARL) of Cambridgeshire. It was built to test low weight, bakelite-bonded plywood, stressed skin wing and fuselage structures. Development Apart from the structure the Snark was a conventional looking low-wing four-seat cabin monoplane, powered by a nose-mounted 130 hp (97 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major piston engine. Registered G-ADDL the Snark first flew from Cambridge on 16 December 1934 flown by de Bruyne. Though stressed plywood skinned aircraft had been built before, it was claimed at the time that the Snark was the first to have been designed with full stress calculations, including loads carried by both wing and fuselage skins. This led to a high loaded/unloaded weight ratio of 1.82; the similarly engined, almost exactly contemporary 3/4 seat Miles Falcon had achieved 1.62. In May 1936 the Snark was transferred to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough for research into the aerodynamics of thick wing monoplanes, with serial number L6103.

Life He was of Welsh descent, son of Edward Gwinne, grocer, and was born in London. On 28 April 1570 he entered Merchant Taylors' School. He was elected to a scholarship at St John's College, Oxford, in 1574, and afterwards became a fellow there. He proceeded B.A. 14 May 1578, and M.A. 4 May 1582. In 1582, as a regent master, he read lectures in music, but on 19 February 1583 he was allowed to discontinue the lecture. In 1588 he was junior proctor. Queen Elizabeth visited Oxford in September 1592, and he took part as replier in moral philosophy in an academic disputation held for her amusement, defending the Moderns against the Ancients and being cut short by the proctors,;Christopher Hill, Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution Revisited (1997), p. 47. and at the same time was appointed to provide for plays in Christ Church. He took the degree of M.B. 17 July 1593, and was the same day created M.D., on the recommendation of Lord Buckhurst, chancellor of the university; one of his quaestiones on this occasion was 'whether the frequent use of tobacco was beneficial'. In 1595 he went to France in attendance on Sir Henry Unton, the ambassador. When Gresham College was founded in London, Gwinne was nominated by the university of Oxford on 14 February 1597 the first Gresham Professor of Physic, and began to lecture in Michaelmas term 1598. He was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London 30 September 1600, and a fellow 22 December 1605. He was six times censor, and twice held the office of registrar. In 1605 he was given the appointment of physician to the Tower. When in 1605 James I and Queen Anne of Denmark visited Oxford, Gwinne disputed on physic with Sir William Paddy for the royal entertainment, on the questions whether the morals of nurses are imbibed by infants with their milk, and whether smoking tobacco is wholesome. The same evening at Magdalen College a play by Gwinne, entitled Vertumnus sive annus recurrens, was acted by students of his own college, St John's, and pleased the king, although it did not keep him awake. Gwinne resigned his Gresham professorship in 1607, and attained large professional practice. In 1620 Gwinne was appointed commissioner for inspecting tobacco. Gwinne lived in the parish of St Mary Magdalen Old Fish Street, London, and there died in October 1627. Matthew and his wife Susanna left two sons, John and Henry, who both appear to have been ministers.Edward J. Davies, \\"Nell Gwyn and 'Dr Gwyn of Ch. Ch.'\\", The Bodleian Library Record, 24(2011):121-28. Works The Gresham inaugural oration, with another, was published in 1605: Orationes duae, Londini habitae in sedibus Greshamiis in laudem Dei, Civitatis, Fundatoris, Electorum. Like all his Latin prose compositions these orations are crowded with quotations. Vertumnus sive annus recurrens was printed in London in 1607, with a preface praising the king, and with prefatory verses to Gwinne by Sir William Paddy and John Craig, the royal physicians. In 1611 was published his only medical work, against Francis Anthony.In assertorem Chymicae sed verae medicinae desertorem Fra. Anthonium Matthaei Gwynn Philiatri &c.; succincta adversaria, dedicated to James I. Gwinne proves that Anthony's aurum potabile contained no gold, and that if it had, the virtues of gold as a medicine in no way corresponded to its value as a metal, and were few, if any. It is written in the form of a Latin dialogue between Anthony and his opponent; prefixed to were laudatory verses from the physicians Paddy, Craig, Forster, Fryer, and Hammond. Allen Debus considers that this work shows knowledge of the Paracelsian as well as the Galenist literature, and that the polemic, from the conservative angle, also shows some discrimination amongst different kinds of chemists in the medical field.Allen G. Debus, The English Paracelsians (1965), p. 143. He was friendly with literary men, especially with John Florio, to whose works he contributed several commendatory sonnets under the pseudonym of 'Il Candido.' Gwinne also had significant connections to the circle of Sir Philip Sidney, and collaborated with Fulke Greville on the 1590 edition of the Arcadia. The links include sight of Sidney's now-lost translations from Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas.Katherine Duncan-Jones, Sir Philip Sidney: Courtier Poet (1991), p. 252. In the second dialogue of Giordano Bruno's La Cena de le Ceneri (1584) Gwinne and Florio are represented by Bruno as introducing him to Greville, at whose house the three dined before holding a philosophical disputation. He wrote also: * Epicedium in obitum &c.; Henrici comitis Derbiensis, Oxford, 1593. * Nero, London, 1603, and a second edition, 1637 and 1639, a tragedy in Latin verse written at St John's College, Oxford (unconnected with the two English tragedies of Nero, published in 1607 and 1624 by unknown authors).Modern edition Matthew Gwinne, Nero (Printed 1603), Prepared with an Introduction by Heinz-Deiter Leidig (Renaissance Latin Drama in England Series, vol.

It is also a short distance from Ballymadun.Dublin, 1837, Samuel Lewis: A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, vol. 1 It is located in hilly country, sloping down from west to east, with views towards the hills around the Naul. The village centre is 120m above sea level.Swords, 2003, Fingal County Council: Garristown Local Area Plan History Records from 1200 show John Comyn, Archbishop of Dublin, granting the church at Garristown to the priory of Lanthony. William de Bardelby, later a senior judge, was parish priest here in 1318. By 1607, features included a windmill at Holtrass hill and two other mills, with of land within the townland. The village is also recorded in the Down Survey (1654). The medieval church was later replaced by a Church of Ireland church. Garristown's current street formation has not changed much since the Rocques map of County Dublin (ca. 1746). In 1837, the village had a population of 741, and the surrounding civil parish 2,801. There was a police station, a dispensary, a windmill and churches of both the Church of Ireland (with a ruined residence constructed in 1791) and the Roman Catholic Church (built in 1828), along with one national school for boys and two private schools. There were three fairs a year, and the area had natural resources in the form of stone and peat. A new Roman Catholic church, the Church of Assumption, was dedicated on 10 June 1906. The village today The main street of Garristown runs north to south, with a tree-lined mall on the western side, and the central area where Main Street meets the Naul Road.

Other amenities include a primary school and a community centre, which was a secondary school, Garristown VEC, which, after closure, was acquired by the community council, and converted into the multi- purpose hall and ancillary facilities. This centre is used by sub-groups of the community council, by the local branch of the Irish Countrywomen's Association, local scout groups (the 76th Garristown) and the youth club. There is a bottle bank near the entrance to the old church yard opposite the butchers shop. The base of the local windmill also survives. Business There is one open public house, a butchers shop, small supermarket, one hair dressing salon and a service station. The village is served by a Garda station. Religion In the Roman Catholic church, Garristown is a parish in the Fingal North deanery, served by the Church of the Assumption. There is a former Church of Ireland church and cemetery.

Injury to the perineum or surgical cuts (episiotomy) to the vagina during childbirth can cause sexual dysfunction. Sexual activity in the postpartum period other than sexual intercourse is possible sooner, but some women experience a prolonged loss of sexual desire after giving birth, which may be associated with postnatal depression. Common issues that may last more than a year after birth are greater desire by the man than the woman, and a worsening of the woman's body image. Birth method and injuries Women with damage or tears to their perineum resume sex later than women with an intact perineum, and women who needed perineal sutures report poorer sexual relations. Perineal damage is also associated with painful sex. Women who have an anal tear are less likely to have resumed sex after six months and one year, but they have normal sexual function 18 months later. Assisted vaginal delivery using suction or forceps is correlated with increases in the frequency or severity of painful sex, the delay in resuming sex, and sexual problems. Cesarean section may result in less painful sex during the first 3 months, or there may be no difference, and there is no difference in sexual function or symptoms by six months, although women who delivered by cesarean report greater sexual satisfaction relating to vaginal tone six years on. Delay before resuming sex Many doctors recommend waiting four to six weeks before resuming sex, to allow the cervix to close, bleeding (known as lochia) to stop, and tears to heal. A study of women in Turkey found that 42% resumed sexual intercourse within six weeks of giving birth. American and British studies found that at six weeks, 57% of women had resumed sexual intercourse, 82‚Äì85% had by three months, and 89‚Äì90% had by six months. Another American survey found that masturbation (74%) and oral sex (58%) were begun much more frequently within six weeks than vaginal penetration (34%). Sexual intercourse was resumed by two-thirds of Ugandan women within six months of childbirth, and among Chinese women 52% had resumed sex by two months and 95% had by six months. Sexual dysfunction About half the men and women questioned eight months after childbirth in one British study described their sex life as ‚Äòpoor‚Äô or ‚Äònot very good‚Äô, though another found that 70% of British women and 89% of Taiwanese women were satisfied with their sex life during the postnatal period. Six months after giving birth, one quarter of American women said they had lower sexual sensation, satisfaction, and ability to reach orgasm, and 22% said that sex was painful. More than 80% of British women experienced sexual problems three months after giving birth, and nearly two-thirds at six months, compared to pre-pregnancy levels of 38%. Of Ugandan women who had resumed sex within six months of giving birth, nearly two-thirds experienced vaginal pain and about a third had discharge or bleeding. Vaginal dryness may occur following giving birth for about three months due to hormonal changes. Women who breast-feed are much more likely to report painful sex as well as reduced libido, both due to hormonal changes such as a reduction in levels of estrogen. Women with major trauma reported less desire to be held, touched, or stroked by their partner. Risks A fatal air embolism, when air enters the bloodstream, can occur due to sex shortly after childbirth before the placental bed has healed, particularly if the woman's knees are pressed against her chest, but this is rare. More common complications of having sex early after pregnancy are tears to incisions and infection of the uterus. Reduced libido Having given birth within the previous year is associated with persistent low sexual desire. More than a third of first-time mothers report a loss of libido at eight months, though only 1 in 7 of experienced mothers have a loss of libido. Women often have a poor body image after giving birth. Women are often uncomfortable with their physical changes after birth, and often want sleep or to have time for themselves, which leads to a changed sexual pattern. Discordance of sexual desire with their partner is frequent. Another potential cause of low libido is postpartum depression; depressed women are less likely to have resumed sex at six months and more likely to report more sexual health problems. Dissatisfaction with the sexual relationship a year after childbirth is associated with a lack of sex early in pregnancy as well as older ages of women, but not with factors relating to pregnancy or birth. =In partners= A study of found that the sexual desire of partners, both fathers and co- mothers, is often low following the birth: \\"High sexual desire in co-parents at this time was influenced not only by sexual interest, but also feelings of intimacy. Low desire was influenced not by partner disinterest or breast- feeding status, as more typically assumed, but by fatigue and stress.\\" Treatment Only 15% of London women who had a postnatal sexual problem reported discussing it with a health professional, whereas 59.4% of Ugandan women who had resumed sex and had a sexual problem sought medical assistance. Performing pelvic floor muscle exercise appears to improve sexual function, and painful sex and vaginal dryness can be reduced using different sexual positions and lubricants. 83% of British and 60% of Taiwanese women thought they had sufficient information about sex during the postnatal period.

He was a renowned member of the Vic-Wells Ballet and Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet and was also artistic director of the La Scala Theatre Ballet.  Biography  Born John Greenfield in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, in 1921, Field began training in dance with Edna Slocombe and Shelagh Elliott-Clarke in Liverpool. He made his stage debut with the Liverpool Ballet Club in 1938, before moving to London, where he trained at the Sadler's Wells Ballet School under Ninette de Valois. He joined the Vic-Wells Ballet in 1939 and danced with the company for two years before leaving to serve in the Royal Air Force during World War II. On returning to the company, he was promoted to the rank of Principal Dancer, partnering many of the leading British ballerinas of the 20th century, including Dame Beryl Grey, Dame Margot Fonteyn and Svetlana Beriosova. In 1946, the Vic-Wells Ballet relocated from Sadler's Wells to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, becoming known as the Royal Ballet in 1956. To continue ballet performances at Sadler's Wells, a sister company was formed known as the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet, with Field appointed as its founder Artistic Director. The company would be the predecessor of today's Birmingham Royal Ballet. After a number of years directing the Sadler's Wells company, in 1970 Field was appointed co-director of the Royal Ballet alongside Sir Kenneth MacMillan. He held the position for a year, but his relationship with MacMillan deteriorated and he eventually resigned, after being invited to take the post of artistic director at La Scala Theatre Ballet and the La Scala Theatre Ballet School in Milan, Italy. He was artistic director of La Scala for three years from 1971 to 1974. On returning to England in 1975, Field was appointed director of the Royal Academy of Dancing and was a director of the British Ballet Organization he also taught at the Arts Educational School in London. His last post with a professional ballet company was as artistic director of the London Festival Ballet, today's English National Ballet. Following his death in 1991, it was decided to hold a regular summer school in his memory, so the John Field Memorial Ballet Seminars were established in 1993 and ran for a number of years.

Incumbent mayor Allan Lamport easily won against former alderman Nathan Phillips. There were two referendum questions on the ballot. One called for municipal terms in the city to be extended from one year to two. This measure was rejected, but was later passed in the 1955 election. The second measure was to approve funds for the construction of the Regent Park housing project, which was passed by a slim margin. The province of Ontario passed legislation on April 7, 1953 federating the City of Toronto and twelve surrounding suburban townships and villages into the municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. A Metropolitan Toronto Council came into being on April 15, 1953 and was made up of the Metro Chairman, Frederick Gardiner, who had been appointed by the province, the Mayor of Toronto, the City of Toronto's two most senior Controllers, nine senior aldermen from each of the City of Toronto (the top finisher in each ward), and the twelve suburban mayors and reeves.\\"Inaugural Meeting April 15 Large Sums To Be Needed For Services\\", The Globe and Mail (1936-2016); Toronto, Ont.

Biography Blacklock was born in Shoreditch, London, the second of five children. His father was James Blacklock (1782‚Äì1823), a bookseller and publisher, and his mother was Mary Ann Blacklock (n√©e Pearson) (1784‚Äì1853). The Blacklock family had roots in Cumberland dating back to the 1730s, and in 1818 they moved from London to the small village of Cumwhitton, about eight miles east of Carlisle, where the family owned property and farmed. They are believed to have lived in Cumwhitton House, a detached, double fronted sandstone property dating back to 1818. As a boy, Blacklock was apprenticed to Charles Thurnam, a publisher and bookseller in Carlisle and a friend of his father. He was, however, keen on drawing and decided to pursue a career as an artist. Carlisle had become an important artistic centre since the Academy of Art had opened in 1823, and Blacklock was taught there by the Carlisle artist Matthew Ellis Nutter. Blacklock exhibited at the Academy in 1833, and was described as a \\"rising artist\\" with a \\"feeling for nature and a correctness of taste.\\" Blacklock moved to London in 1836 and lived there until 1850, enjoying increasing success and renown. His picturesque style was likened to that of William Mulready and he was praised by such artists as J. M. W. Turner, David Roberts and Thomas Creswick. He exhibited four pictures at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1836, and went on to show a total of eleven pictures at the Society of British Artists, four at the British Institution and thirty six at the Royal Academy of Arts during the period 1835‚Äì1855. It is believed that Blacklock may have seen the cleaning of old masters in the National Gallery in 1844-45, which would have been an invaluable experience in terms of the evolution of his own technique. In 1847 William Ewart Gladstone bought Blacklock‚Äôs painting Lanercost Abbey. James Leathart and Lord Armstrong, both Tyneside industrialists and art collectors, bought several of Blacklock‚Äôs paintings in the early 1850s, through Blacklock's admirer and friend of the Pre-Raphaelites, William Bell Scott. However, by 1850 Blacklock's health and eyesight were deteriorating, and he moved back to Cumwhitton and worked in a studio in Stanwix just outside Carlisle until 1854, when illness and the loss of sight in one eye made work increasingly difficult. In November 1855 his youngest brother Thomas had him admitted to the Crichton Royal in Dumfries, suffering from an illness described as \\"monomania of ambition and general paralysis.\\" The Institution pioneered the use of artistic activity in treating patients, and his case notes indicate that he continued to draw until mid-1857; a drawing of a cathedral and a watercolour of Craigmillar Castle produced during this time have been attributed to him. After this he suffered further mental deterioration and died in the Crichton on 12 March 1858 of general paresis of the insane, or syphilis, aged 42. He was buried in Cumwhitton on 16 March 1858. An extract from his obituary described him as a \\"truthful and unpretending artist, who wooed nature rather than popular favour.\\" Assessment An old mill near Haweswater, 1854 William Bell Scott recognised the early Pre-Raphaelite precision in Blacklock's technique and his great power of truth; indeed it was Scott and his artistic friends (almost certainly including Rossetti), who used Blacklock's painting Barnard Castle of 1852‚Äì53 to try to study his luminous glazes over a white ground which had been developed over many years. Blacklock thereafter developed into an artist of great power. The Steps at Haddon Hall, exhibited in 1848 at the Norwich Exhibition, has been described as the first thorough going mature white ground technique Pre-Raphaelite-influenced English landscape painting, and both its technique and inclusion of Huguenot figures, representing a thematic trend in British art of the period, as seen in John Everett Millais's later A Huguenot (1851-52). Although Blacklock's art can be described as semi-photographic, Blacklock rejected Ruskin's exact copying of truth to nature and the Victorian faith in facts for his own inner thoughts and imagination. Geoffrey Grigson had written in the mid-twentieth century that \\"Blacklock, I reflect, belongs to the generation of Courbet, that creative wonder between Romanticism and Impressionism: he comes after Constable and after Corot,\\" adding that Blacklock participated differently in a naturalism of vision and imagination which changed the arts by the middle of the 19th century, and was related to a broader artistic response at the time to newly valued works of the Italian Renaissance by Giorgione and Giovanni Bellini. Writing in a Sotheby's sale catalogue in 2010, Christopher Newall noted that, \\"Although hard to place in the evolving pattern of progressive landscape painting in the mid-nineteenth century, Blacklock is an important and intriguing figure who may be regarded as a pivot between the early nineteenth-century landscape school and the achievements of Romanticism, and the earnest and obsessive innovation of the Pre-Raphaelite school.\\" Blacklock's finished oils are very rare, with the largest collection of his work is housed in the Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle, which also owns around a dozen watercolors and drawings by the artist Works His works include: * 1843 ‚Äì Gilnockie Tower (oil)https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/gilnockie- tower-144152/view_as/grid/search/keyword:william-james-blacklock/page/1 * 1843 ‚Äì On the Banks of Derwentwater; Silver Birch, Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle * 1844 ‚Äì Askerton Castle * 1844 ‚Äì Buit's Castle, Bewcastle, Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle * 1845 ‚Äì The Terrace, Haddon Hall, Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle * 1847 ‚Äì Lanercost Abbey * 1847 ‚Äì Calder Abbey * 1848 ‚Äì The Steps at Haddon Hall * 1849 ‚Äì Naworth Castle, Cumbria, National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin * c. 1850 ‚Äì Solway (watercolour) * 1852‚Äì3 ‚Äì Barnard Castle * 1853 ‚Äì Devock Water, Abbot Hall Art Gallery * 1853 ‚Äì Lakeland mountains, Crummock water, Grassmoor and Whiteless Pike (sold 2008 for ¬£51,650) * 1854 ‚Äì An old mill near Haweswater * 1854 ‚Äì The Ruins of Kirkoswald Castle, Cumberland, Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle * 1854 ‚Äì Catbells and Causey Pike, Derwentwater, Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle * 1854 ‚Äì The Rookery, Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle * 1855 ‚Äì By the lakeside * 1855 ‚Äì Hermitage Castle * 1855 ‚Äì The Border Keep * 1855 ‚Äì Elter Water, and the Langdale Pikes * 1855 ‚Äì Belted Will's Tower, Naworth Castle * 1850-58 ‚Äì Landscape with Bridge and Figures, Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle Galleries Blacklock's works are in the following collections: *Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle, with 33 works. *National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin *Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal References Sources * Category:19th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:English landscape painters Category:Deaths from syphilis Category:1816 births Category:1858 deaths Category:People from Shoreditch Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom ","title":"William James Blacklock"},{"id":"23890663","text":"Chrometa is a product of the software company Chrometa LLC, which is based in Sacramento, California.

Circuit riders usually operate within a specific area of their designated state, visiting the small utilities on a regular basis. Drinking water/wastewater Circuit riders are usually categorized as either drinking water or wastewater specialists. Drinking water circuit riders specialize in the supply, treatment and distribution of clean drinking water through a water utility. Wastewater circuit riders specialize in the processes required for the safe collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater and sewage. Circuit riders in both fields have extensive knowledge and experience with the state and federal regulations governing drinking water and wastewater. Management and accounting Some state associations have circuit riders who specialize in assisting utilities with management, accounting and record-keeping issues. These circuit riders are often asked to perform rate studies, which examine a utility's expenses and incomes and recommends rates that allows them to meet their financial obligations.

Main characters  ; Tasha Godspell Tasha Godspell is a Black Class WH, achieved after only one year of training under his master, Edea. His goal is to rescue his sister Aria from the North Witch's influence, have her remove the curse on him which will eventually kill him and take her back home to their mother. He is obsessed with money and a swindler, but he is very kind to women and witches, never killing witches, but instead taking their hats to make them powerless. He was trained in using a magically powered weapon by his master, the White Witch Edea Florence, whom he cares very much for, and does not hesitate to attack anyone who may insult her name. His Magic Bullet Gun can fire three types of ammunition: piercing, grenade, or tranquilizer. His Arcane Desert Eagle Custom has the firing power of 10,000 bullets in a single shot. The recoil is so great it can break his arm after 3 shots, and heavily drains his mana. In addition to mana bullets, Tasha can also fit real bullets into his guns. His Dimensional Gallery stores his guns, supporter, and also regulates the flow of mana in his body. It is revealed later that he can convert into a S-level White Class using Dimensional Gallery's summoners to sing \\"The Songs of Moirae\\" to release his limiter, however his mental state is very unstable when he is at this level. He received Halloween, a pumpkin doll supporter, from his teacher Edea, before she was killed by his sister. As such, he treasures Halloween above all else, but he does occasionally shoot it or mistreat it in a comical fashion. During the fight with Ryuhwan, Tasha broke one of Halloween's seals before Ryuhwan's Halloween could kill it, reverting his Halloween's shape back to its original form of a young girl, greatly surprising him. As a result, Halloween received an increase in her speed and strength with the release of the first seal, and it is hinted that she will be able to be even stronger with the second release. Tasha may have feelings for Halloween, as his reaction to Cooga's taunts have shown.Chapter 51 It is revealed late into the series that Tasha is capable of generating his own mana, and is the only male shown to be naturally capable of doing so, as Merlin had to change himself into a woman in order to do so. His source had originally been dormant, but responded when he used The Song of Moirae, the mana awakening his source. It is unknown how powerful his mana is, but is implied to heavily surpass that of an S-Class witch, as Merlin mentioned Tasha's mana source far outclassed his, who's mana level is that of an Archmage. It is because of this that East and North are keeping a close eye on him. After his second conversation with Merlin, Tasha quits WH to escape with Halloween but ends up fighting with several fellow WH agents in the attempt. During the fight he is taken by the Witch of the East in order to train him. His hobbies include cleaning, cooking, and counting money. His likes are traveling by himself, money, and free stuff, and he hates things that don't make money.Volume 2 omake He seems to attract girls who are shy or outgoingChapter 10 omake and he has a rivalry with fellow Witch Hunter Cooga. It is revealed that he is the reincarnation of West, one of the four Great Witches. ;Halloween Tasha's supporter, she takes the form of a pumpkin doll and fights using two swords, Yin and Yang. She protects Tasha no matter what, but is not above striking him in retaliation for an insult. She had two seals placed around her neck to suppress her power and help Tasha keep her in check, but during the fight with Ryuhwan's Halloween, Tasha breaks one seal, reverting her into a young girl, increasing her speed and strength. In this form she summons her blades from her clothing and can change their shape for defensive purposes. She can also restore the swords if they break but without them she's much weaker. According to East, she can become stronger than Varete and Ryuhwan. It is shown that Halloween may have feelings for Tasha, blushing when he compliments her on how she looks in her new uniform and comforts him about Aria. It is also revealed she is the daughter of King Arthur and the witch Guinevere, her real name being Mordred. Later, the Witch Hunter headquarters ordered her to separate from Tasha as a supporter and become the King of Britain. ;East East is one of the Four Legendary Witches and the master of Surtr. Because East needs Tasha to stop main antagonist North's plan, she protects and guides Tasha, urging him to get stronger. She is currently in a weakened state, resulting in a physical appearance of a young girl. Despite that, she is shown to be stronger than Varete, who in turn is many levels above Tasha. Unlike most Witches, East never had a hat to begin with. East is revealed to govern death and rebirth. East knew West and Ryuhwan in the past. She offers Ryuhwan a contract with her in exchange for the name of the Witch who killed West. She also appears to know Halloween's true identity, revealing that if her last seal is released, she will become several times stronger. The appearance that many people knew East by was actually her Sorella, Etwal, who pretended to be East to hide her true identity. Etwal was killed by South and North in order to steal East's powers. Her supporter is the Fiery Earth of Musphelheim's King, Surtr, though due to her weakened state she cannot fully utilize him Witch Hunters Witch Hunters, or WHs for short, are people who fight against witches and they have several headquarters around the world. There are both Humans and Witches among their ranks, the latter being good-natured Witches that have been recruited to help fight their evil counterparts. Witch Hunters are divided into five classes depending on abilities. The class is signified by the color of the WH's clothing, which judges the abilities of the wearer and changes colors accordingly. It also has defensive properties and is laced with memory-lapse fiber to make Witch Hunters blend in among ordinary people. The classes are: * S class: White, the strongest WHs * A class: Black, also strong ones, it is noted that one A class WH has the same power as a team of B rank WHs * B class: Blue, significantly weaker, but they still fight witches directly on the battlefield in teams * C class: Green, WHs of this class only have search and investigation duties * D class: Gray, the weakest class, who do the office work at the WH bases. Apparently, every A class WH has his/her own personal financial manager, who is a D class WH. =Team Unnamed= ; Tasha Godspell Tasha was part of Team Unnamed until he defected from the WH because he refused to give up his supporter Halloween which Merlin requested as a bargaining chip for giving the location of the castles of the four Great Witches. ; Xing Bairong Although he's a famous skirt chaser, Xing is very capable. He typically hates men with the exception of Tasha. He prefers women with sexy bodies and has a hobby of collecting sunglasses.Volume 2 omake He also loves to make cool entrances. His real name is Prince Yue and he is the brother of Lee and Xing, the other Emperor candidates. Yue is a genius and considered the most talented of the three brothers. Because he didn't want to become Emperor, he constantly cuts class and avoids training. His dream is to leave the Bairong Empire and to roam the world. Ironically, he is chosen as the next Emperor by the White Dragon. After the ceremony, Jang-chung and his elite forces attempts to kill Yue but fail. Eunwon, Lee's assistant, intervenes and attempts to finish off a heavily wounded Yue. Lee also shows up but loses as well. Shortly after, the current Emperor appears and kills Eunwon. Yue stops the Emperor's attempt at killing Lee by threatening to commit suicide. The Emperor reveals that he has all fifty past Emperor's souls inside him, providing him with 5000 years of power and knowledge. Before the official nomination of the next Emperor, Yue decides to let Xing rule since Xing truly cares for the kingdom. Since they are twins, they exchange identities. Yue, now as Xing, leaves the Bairong Empire behind, knowing he's left it in good hands. ; Taras Doberg Possessing incredible control over Earth, Taras is an egotistical jerk and refers to himself with the suffix -nim (Korean equivalent of -sama). His personality antagonizes many people so he usually works alone. Despite being very powerful, he was defeated by Tasha's little sister and controlled by a Witch, facts which Tasha teases him about. According to the author, he was supposed to be an unnamed extra but the author liked his personality and expanded his role. His hobbies include gardening. As expected of his personality, he loves receiving praise and hates being ignored.Volume 2 omake The only person Taras fears happens to be his older sister, Tania, who is also the S-Class Administrator of the North and currently ranked the third strongest WH. ; Elmar Hyacinth A former B-class Witch who witnessed her entire team being wiped out by a Witch. She gets almost killed by the enemy witch too, but Xing and Taras comes to the rescue, and inform her that a supporter is waiting for her. Vihyungrang introduces Elmar to her supporter, Tirving. When Elmar wields Tirving, she meets the blood thirsty sword hilt in the form of a woman. In exchange for power, Tirving explains her endless craving for blood. If the Master cannot satisfy her craving with enemy blood, she will drain her Master's blood. With the desire to become stronger, Elmar accepts these conditions and the sword hilt transforms into a blade of blood. Vihyungrang states that Elma is truly the Master of Tirving because she is able to cast high-level healing magic endlessly and has considerable swordsmanship. Elmar and Halloween are sparring partners. =Team Golden Moon= ; Monica A thief who stole Tasha's bag. After Tasha tracks her down, he quickly realizes that Monica has a special ability. Monica reveals that after an accident, she began to see invisible threads attached to people, typically colored black. However, when the color of the thread turned red, it indicates that they would die the next day. Afterwards, in exchange for helping him earn money, Tasha promises to get rid of the witch that killed her best friend. During Tasha's fight with the Witch, Monica gets controlled and stabs Tasha. Distraught over her actions, she begins crying but Tasha scolds her and says it's not her fault. However, Tasha, heavily wounded, falls to the Witch. Upon seeing Tasha almost defeated, she awakens as a Witch and her Spiritual Supporter, Paravati, heals Tasha and dispels the threads controlling them. With the Witch's abilities weakened, the WH takes her down with ease. With Monica's new appearance as a Witch, the townsfolk hold her responsible for everything that has happened. Before the problem escalated, Tasha intervenes and defends Monica. To show her gratitude, she joins the WH and becomes Eclipse's apprentice. She has romantic feelings for Tasha. Her Spiritual Supporter allows Monica to be classified as a A-class WH overnight. Paravati, her Spiritual Supporter, is a support type, with capabilities ranging from healing to dispelling to absorbing. ; Eclipse Shadenon Eclipse appears to be on good terms with Tasha because of his connection to Edea Florence. She notes that Tasha always manages to recruit Witches who have a Spiritual Supporter. Taking an immediate interest, Eclipse takes the reluctant Monica as her apprentice. Eclipse acts as older sister to Alv Bronte and keeps her killing intent in check. ; Alv Bronte A small Witch who is portrayed as emotionless. She is very attached to Eclipse and doesn't hesitate to kill anyone who insults Eclipse. =Team Blondie= ; Cooga Kunein Tasha's rival. He despises Witches and the weak, including those who operate under WH. His attacks are lightning-based. He holds Words in high regard and enjoys making hats. ; Words Blondy Von Worth Often seen by Cooga's side. His special ability is the manipulation of gravity. He is fond of wine and reading and is somewhat sophisticated. He likes to act cool. =Team BeastMaster= ;Ran A young Witch who is attracted to Tasha Godspell. She first appears in chapter eleven, wherein she and her teacher suffer an attack by Ryuhwan. Tasha comes to her rescue. Her supporter, Baghira, takes the form of a talking panther. ;Nekbet Ran's master. First appears in chapter eleven. =Other= ; Vihyungrang Currently the strongest WH, he is a ghost summoning shaman. Due to his special ability, his attacks are invisible and inescapable. Per Edea Florence's request, he watches over Tasha. Bari, Vihyungrang's assistant, is also one of his ghosts. She is incredibly powerful, capable of firing laser beams from her eyes and possessing superb swordsmanship. In addition, any attacks of this world will have no effect on her. Vihyungrang confronts East since she only appears around Tasha. After knowing her true intentions, he proceeds to attack her. Although he surpassed Surtr in strength, he was easily defeated once East supplied him with Mana. After East retreats, the defeated Vihyungrang retreats to Shrina and vows to return with a Phantom Corps. ; Tania Doberg The S-Class Administrator of the North and Taras' older sister. She is considerably stronger, able to use Flower of Earth (a much, much bigger one) without a chant, only tapping the ground with her staff. Tania interrupts Tasha's fight with Lancelot and forces him to retreat without much effort. Tasha said he and Taras were a team, which prompted Tania to give him a lollipop. When questioned on the whereabouts of her brother, Tasha tells her that he has headed East. Infuriated that Taras lied to her, Tania presumably heads East, at the same time, allowing Lancelot to escape. ; Diana Basil A Witch said to have infinite knowledge, managing the WH Magic network. However, her services are not free and anyone who wish to access information must provide their past and future. After touching Tasha, she says she cannot see his future. As a result, she takes an immediate interest in Tasha because the future she cannot see are those involving the 4 Great Witches. In exchange for a magic link in Tasha's head so she can see through his eyes, Diana provides him with limitless information. Her memories are apparently altered after having come in contact with a D-class WH whose special ability is memory alteration. Her Supporter, The Secret Garden, shows people who they want to see in order to hide Diana's true appearance. For example, she appears as Aria in front of Tasha and in front of Xing(Yue) like one of his brothers. ; Edea Florence Tasha's master who was killed by Aria. Her hobbies included making puppet dolls, making both Halloween dolls that became her apprentices' Supporters. She worked on researching the Magic Bullet Gun. Although she was presumed dead, Varete and Neptis has claimed she's not dead and they have plans to resurrect her. ; Linda Cuthbert Linda is Tasha's Financial Manager who takes care of him by legal (and illegal) means. She is very effective at her job, obtaining upgrades and equipment for no cost, much to Tasha's relief. She also equipped Halloween after her first seal was unlocked and turned human. She is one of the girls who likes Tasha. ; Felice Fidelier Felice is Cooga's manager and Linda's friend. Not much information about this woman is seen in the manga. ;Visul Visul has taken care of Prince Yue ever since they were young. When Yue left from Bairong Empire as his brother Xing, she followed him and together they joined the ranks of WH. She works as his assistant and constantly beats him due to all the flirting complaints. Even though she is a D class WH, it seems that Visul is able to pull off Shinsok and use Kaizer Fist. She claims that she is \\"the D class WH that surpasses all A class WH\\". She carries a giant mace. ;Alisha Daisy Alisha is Taras' assistant. She is not the least bit intimidated by him. Because she takes care of his personal garden while he's out, Alisha knows he treasures the garden very much. She threatens to destroy his garden to force him to complete his paperwork. Antagonists Ryuhwan West's only human apprentice that she took on when he was still very young. When Ryuhwan was young, he met East and Varete. As West's apprentice, he received training similar to Tasha, but it is yet to be known if Edea, Tasha's teacher, was one of West's apprentice. But because Ryuhwan was under West apprenticeship for a longer period of time, he is significantly stronger than Tasha, capable of defeating both him and Halloween in his released form. For unknown reasons, West disowned him. Ever since Ryuhwan found out West was killed by a Witch, he has gone around killing Witches and taking their hats to increase his own mana. Just like Tasha, he won't hesitate to kill anyone who speaks ill will of his master. After Varete told him that he is partly the cause of his master's death; he was struck down by her, only to be rescued by East. According to his memories, he was orphaned when he was but a child after her mother was killed and was a resident of the city-Bairong. He is very perceptive and is able to quickly determine his own combat weaknesses and train to turn them into strengths. He is currently training with Tasha and Halloween, only to be interrupted by South's witches. If Ryuhwan removes the Mana Replenish Limiter in his Dimensional Gallery, his body is flooded with mana, turning his hair white and making him very powerful. However, he can only maintain this form for a limited amount of time, before returning to normal, either due to lack of mana or to prevent the mana from poisoning him. His Halloween is possibly stronger than Tasha's, fighting at the bare minimum amount of mana but nearly killing it, however only his Halloween only has one seal as opposed to Tasha's which has two. Ryuhwan is revealed to be 67 years old thanks to the amount of witch hat he accumulated over the years. Aria Godspell Tasha's little sister, known as the Red Witch. Before she became a witch, she was a very bright and kind girl who loved her brother dearly.Volume 2 author notes She likes collecting pretty things, especially receiving gifts from her brother. While her personality has become dark and sinister since becoming a witch, her love for Tasha has not diminished but intensified. When Halloween was bragging to Aria about her situation with Tasha, Aria became furious. So strong is Aria's desire to be with her brother that she massacred an entire town just to lure him there. Despite Tasha's pleas for her to stop being a witch, Aria continues as a witch, knowing she can never be normal again as she killed their father and countless innocent people since the change. Unable to live a normal life with Tasha, Aria instead resolves to turn Tasha into her Supporter, so that he will belong to her forever. All of Aria's actions and motives are directed towards this goal. Her current Supporter, Aegis, takes the form of numerous flying disks that could freely and independently attack and defend. Each disk's power is equal to an A-class WH. When Aria learned of Tasha's tutelage under the White Witch Edea Florence, and seeing how much Edea cared for Tasha, Aria fought and killed Edea out of jealousy. Though victorious, Aria lost most of her Aegis disks in the battle. Even with her Supporter now only having two disks, Aria is still extremely powerful, and remains one of the most feared Witches. Shortly after becoming a Witch, Aria placed a magical curse on Tasha that is slowly 'killing' him. When the curse is complete, Tasha's life as a human and WH will end, and he will be transformed into Aria's new Supporter, bound to her forever. She has expressed remorse for using the curse, but since Tasha refuses to come to her willingly, she will use whatever method necessary to have him for herself. Before she was killed by Aria, Edea had placed a seal on the curse, slowing it down greatly and giving Tasha time to try to undo it. The only way currently know to remove the curse is for Aria to either willingly cancel it, or for Aria to die. However, when Tasha used \\"The Song of Moirae\\", the seal placed by Edea was broken and accelerated the curse into its final stage. Varete Varete was supposed to have died by the hands of North and South, but North spared her life. In exchange, she would serve and protect North while acting as Aria's guardian and teacher. Varete is so powerful that North, in her current state, and Neptis could not hope to defeat her. She also forced East to supply mana to Surtr. She easily defeats Tasha with her Supporter. In a dream, Tasha found himself in a huge castle with Varete by his side. Tasha felt a sense of longing for her as she took off her hat and smiled at him. Due to dialogue from other Witches regarding the West Witch's demise and South's claim of Varete being \\"one of the four great witches like me\\" during her trip to North's castle it's safe to assume Varete prior to her \\"death\\" was West. Her Supporter is Abyss, a shadow that can appear wherever a shadow is present. It cannot be killed. North One of the Four Great Witches. Because North needs Tasha for part of her plan, she took Aria in and placed her in Varete's care. That way, Tasha would inevitably make his way towards North. North is in a weakened state and has stated she has limited body movement. As a result, she has Neptis and Varete do most of her dirty work. East has said that North's ultimate plan is to drive all humans to extinction. South One of the Four Great Witches. While South agreed to an assault on Britain and Bairong, South does not trust North. South, in an attempt to find out North's plans, enters North's castle, only to be met with Neptis and Varete. South, who thought Varete had died, became ecstatic because she had found an \\"exciting\\" situation. At that moment, South's hat turned into her Sorella (blood sister), Poene. Poene also craved excitement but resisted the current situation because she knew North had something planned. She easily convinces South to back off for now. East has said South's ultimate plan is to enslave all of humanity. Neptis A Witch serving under North, she is on bad terms with Varete. She is a young girl with long wavy hair who seems to be attached to North. After Tasha used \\"The Song of Moirae\\", his body was overflowing with mana, but his body could not handle it. Neptis released all the overflowing mana by plunging her hand into his chest. She is able to create space barriers, preventing outside access. The barriers are incredibly strong as it took Ryuhwan's strongest weapon to break through. Rose A Witch serving under South. Under South's orders, Rose sent five of her subordinates to attack the WH train herself. . After realizing that her subordinates have all died, she engages three A class WH by She is acquainted with Taras, but their connection is not deep. Her Supporter is Vital, a Supporter that resides deep in the Earth, sprouting vines all over the battlefield. Along the vines are roses that transforms into Rose's appearance. She eventually is defeated by Tasha after he used \\"The Song of Moirae\\". Lancelot Du Lac A mysterious knight who is heading the destruction of the Kingdom of Britain. He is in fact this world's version of Sir Lancelot. His past and motives are unclear but he has stated that he feels no sympathy for Britain because it is no longer ruled by King Arthur. He still sees himself as a knight, and will not do sneak attacks and will show mercy to his enemies. Upon recognizing Halloween as Mordread, Queen Guinevere's daughter, Lancelot is now determined to take her away from Tasha. To that end, he has chopped off Tasha's gloved hand. Tasha, while fighting Lancelot, asks Lancelot if he wants to free Halloween because she looks at Tasha the way she is supposed to look at Lancelot, implying that Halloween (as Mordread) might have been in love with Lancelot before she became Tasha's supporter. Lee Bairong Brother of Xing and Yue, he believes that strength is need to rule his country. When Yue was chosen as the next emperor he was convinced by his servant Euhwan and his father the emperor to kill his brother. Having trained 17 years to be the next emperor, not becoming emperor was the same as death to him. Lee shows up but loses the emperor appears and kills Eunwon and tries to kill Lee, stating that he wanted to gather up and get rid of as many traitors as possible, but Yue threatened to kill himself. He then left the kingdom only to reappear during the second great war.. Palguek Palgeuk is a White S-Class WH from the Southern WH Base who saved Vihyungrang from Surtr and East after she start giving her mana to Surtr. He has hinted that he is not as powerful as Vihyungrang who made the claim he's worth two white classes. He seems to be working with Words Blondy von Worth and killed the Southern center's S-Class witch, meaning he may be like Word and hate Witches, even those who work with him. He works with North, like Word. At Neptis's command, he later fights with Ryuhwan, defeating him, but leaves without killing the boy. Before the battle, he reveals his true name is Eunryu.

It encourages understanding and cooperation between the United States and China.  Mission  Since 1966, the National Committee has been the leading American nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to promoting mutual trust and collaboration between the United States and China. The National Committee conducts exchanges, as well as educational and policy activities in areas of politics and security, education, governance and civil society, economic cooperation, media and transnational issues, addressing these topics with respect to Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. National Committee exchanges and conferences bring together leaders in multiple fields from both sides of the Pacific, and promote forthright dialogue, engagement, and decision-making across a range of disciplines. The committee's membership consists of American citizens, corporations and professional firms. They represent many viewpoints, but share the belief that productive U.S.-China relations require ongoing public education, face-to-face contact and forthright exchange of ideas.  Activities  The National Committee promotes mutual understanding and constructive relations through programs in four primary categories: Informing policy makers and thought leaders through exchanges that enable elected officials, government leaders, and senior military personnel to meet, develop working relationships, and discuss critical issues. Activities include: * Congressional member and staff delegations to China * Events for visiting Chinese leaders (including Presidents Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao, and Premier Wen Jiabao) * Reports on U.S.-China capital flows * Briefings and delegations for senior U.S. military officers Fostering Dialogue on cutting edge issues to promote frank exchanges among experts and policy leaders. Track II dialogue topics include: * Digital economy * Economic relations * Healthcare * Maritime issues and international law * The rule of law and human rights * Strategic security Next generation programs to develop the capacity of future leaders from the United States and China. Initiatives include: * Public Intellectuals Program for American specialists on China * Professional Fellows Program, which brings together U.S., PRC, Hong Kong and Taiwan NGO leaders * Student Leaders Exchange to introduce top American secondary students to China * Young Leaders Forum for emerging leaders from multiple fields * Professional Fellows Program: Capacity building and two-way exchange for emerging NGO leaders in China, Mongolia and the United States in the fields of environment, philanthropy, legal aid and community building for marginalized populations Public Education: Facilitating the exchange of ideas through public outreach and educational exchanges, including: * Public events, book talks, lectures, and discussions with leading experts * CHINA Town Hall: A simultaneous 100-city nationwide event * Barnett-Oksenberg Lecture Series, an annual event in Shanghai * Video, podcast, and transcript series to educate a global online audience  History  = Origins of the National Committee = The National Committee on United States‚ÄìChina Relations was founded in 1966 by a coalition of academic, civic, religious, and business leaders. The founders included leading figures in the China field such as Robert A. Scalapino, A. Doak Barnett, Alexander Eckstein, Lucian Pye, and Cecil Thomas, who became its first executive director. Their aim was to build a network of accomplished individuals from a broad political spectrum, committed to fostering open discussion and to improving U.S. policy toward China. The committee's express mission was to educate the U.S. public, but it soon found itself in the position to offer information and advice to President Lyndon B. Johnson and other political leaders. In 1972, it co-hosted the Chinese table tennis team's tour of the United States, a widely publicized event that captured world attention. The historic two-way exchange by American and Chinese table tennis teams became known as Ping Pong Diplomacy. The National Committee was founded in the wake of two groundbreaking conferences: the ‚ÄúInstitute on China Today‚Äù held at University of California-Berkeley in 1964, and the ‚ÄúNational Conference on the United States and China‚Äù in Washington, D.C. in 1965. Together, they gave a platform to leaders from many sectors to advocate for the reshaping of the U.S. approach towards China. At the time, U.S. presidents wanted to move closer to normalization of relations with China but faced resistance in Congress. By privately advising Johnson in 1968 and Nixon in 1970, members of the National Committee played a vital role in the move towards normalization of relations. = 1970s to the 1990s = During the years leading up to the 1979 normalization of relations, the National Committee encouraged thoughtful discussion about China policy among Americans and encouraged direct dialogue between American and Chinese people. The National Committee became the principal organization conducting public policy and other exchanges between China and the United States during the years leading up to the Reform and Opening (simplified Chinese: ÊîπÈù©ÂºÄÊîæ; traditional Chinese: ÊîπÈù©ÈñãÊîæ; pinyin: G«éig√© kƒÅif√†ng) and the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. In the 1980s, the Committee expanded its work to promote sustained interactions between influential Chinese and Americans in governance, media, urban planning, international relations, and economic management. During the 1990s, the Committee expanded into rule of law, legislative affairs and the expansion of civil society in China. Programs included mayoral and municipal leader exchanges, judicial training and exchanges of senior jurists (including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy), and exchanges and programs on banking and economic policy, journalism, NGO and foundation development, human rights, and public health. = From 2000 to the present = In the 2000s, the National Committee expanded its range with new public education programs, study tours to introduce Chinese consular officers to American society, and in-depth briefings and trips to China for senior U.S. military officers. The National Committee also developed a 2005 program on community planning for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; a groundbreaking visit to the United States by the chairman of the China Foundation for Human Rights Development; a program to help the reform of labor law in China; and a 2009 Land Use and Public Participation Program that addressed rights and ownership issues, among other initiatives.  Leadership  The National Committee includes Americans from around the country, as well as corporations and professional firms. Members of the Committee and its board of directors include a number of distinguished citizens: former secretaries of state Madeleine K. Albright, Henry A. Kissinger, and Condoleezza Rice and other former Cabinet secretaries; all of the former American ambassadors to China; leading scholars of the past several decades such as Jerome A. Cohen, Harry Harding, David Lampton, Nicholas Lardy, Kenneth Lieberthal, Susan Shirk, and Ezra Vogel; and Maurice R. Greenberg and many other corporate executives interested in China. The National Committee's current President is Stephen A. Orlins. The National Committee has long benefited from the experience and expertise of its staff leadership. President Stephen A. Orlins speaks Mandarin fluently and was a member of the State Department team that created the legal framework for the establishment of formal relations in 1979. He has also served as president of Lehman Brothers Asia and as managing director of Carlyle Asia. Vice president Jan Berris has been with the National Committee since 1971 and has led hundreds of delegations between the United States and China, including the Chinese table tennis team's 1972 tour.

During 1979 he toured the UK, Europe and the US during June, July and August. Also during the 1970s Raymond recorded five albums released in Australia on the Festival Records (Australia) and CBS labels.

In 1980 Raymond's eighth LP, A Touch of Tartan, was released and the stage production of Scotland The Brave continued to be one of Clubland's greatest draws. Raymond produced a 13-week series of \\"Tonight\\" variety shows for NBN TV through his production company, Glen-Martin Associated. During 1981 Raymond appeared in TV and radio shows ‚Äì the top- rating radio station 2CH featured him in a \\"Nine O'Clock Special\\" and he had a smash-hit season at the Manly Music Loft Theatre Restaurant with a specially devised revue, A Toast to the Tartan, which also played an eight-week season in the Sir Joseph Banks Room Theatre Restaurant at Bankstown RSL.

Early life and family Born in Nelson on 19 February 1925, Martin was educated at Nelson College from 1939 to 1940. In 1951, he married Ngaire Dawn Wilmshurst in Nelson. Cricket umpiring career Martin was an umpire in first-class cricket from December 1958 to January 1978. A substantial majority of his first-class matches as umpire were played at Wellington's Basin Reserve. He also umpired six List A one-day matches. He stood in 15 Test matches between 1963 and 1973. All of the Test matches he umpired were played in New Zealand. He made his debut as a Test umpire in the 2nd Test between New Zealand and England at the Basin Reserve in Wellington in March 1963, standing with Douglas Dumbleton. In that match, the unbeaten partnership of 163 between Colin Cowdrey (128*, coming in down the batting order at number 8) and Alan Smith (69*) for the ninth wicket in England's first innings set a world record which stood until 1967, when Pakistan's Asif Iqbal and Intikhab Alam reached 190 for the ninth wicket. Cowdrey and Smith's ninth-wicket partnership remains a record for England. Later that month, he umpired the 3rd Test between New Zealand and England, at Lancaster Park in Christchurch, where Fred Trueman took his 243rd Test wicket, passing Brian Statham's world record (Statham played three further Tests in 1963 and 1965, taking another 10 wickets, but did not pass Trueman's new record). Martin also umpired the 1st Test against South Africa at Wellington in February 1964 which was disrupted by damage to the pitch caused by anti-apartheid demonstrators. He and Tony Mackintosh both stood in their last Test as umpire in the 3rd Test between New Zealand and Pakistan at Eden Park in Auckland in February 1973. The tenth wicket partnership of 151 between Brian Hastings (110) and Richard Collinge (68*) in New Zealand's first innings was a world record until 2013. New Zealand opening batsman Rodney Redmond scored 107 and 56; this was to be the only Test match in which he was to play, leaving him with a Test batting average of 81.50. In the 1978 New Year Honours, Martin was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket. Death Martin died in Tauranga on 4 August 2017.

It was built as an aid to navigation for the bay, and the port of Milbridge, then an important deep-water shipbuilding port. It was deactivated in 1934, and is now privately owned. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"Narraguagus Light Station\\" on November 20, 1987. Description and history Narraguagus Bay is a broad and deep indentation on the southeastern coast of Maine, and is dotted with islands and rock ledges. The Narraguagus River empties into the west side of the bay, where the town of Milbridge is located. Pond Island is one of the larger islands marking the southern extent of the bay, where it opens into the larger Gulf of Maine. Narraguagus Light is set in a small clearing on the east side of the island. The light station consists of a circular brick tower, from which an L-shaped work room connects to the keeper's residence. The tower is from base to lantern, with an iron deck and railing surrounding the ten-sided lantern house, from which the lens has been removed. The lantern house is capped by a spherical ventilator. The L-shaped workroom is a single-story brick structure, and the keeper's house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure. The property also includes two wood frame sheds. The light station was established in 1853, one year after the United States Lighthouse Board was established to build and manage the nation's lighthouses. The tower is original, dating to 1853, and was originally built with the keeper's house around it. The current keeper's house dates to 1875, around the time when the present lantern house railing was installed. The light was deactivated in 1934, and the property has been sold into private hands.

Early years The Baltimore Theatre Project was founded in 1971 by Philip Arnoult as an appendage to Antioch University. Such diverse theatre companies as Pilobolus Dance Theater, Urban Bush Women, Bread and Puppet Theatre, Studio Scarabee, the IOWA Theatre Lab, and Spider Woman Theatre were invited to perform throughout the 1970s. Arnoult also established community outreach programs such as the Baltimore Neighborhood Arts Circus and Baltimore Voices.

(photo: Brad Mays) Theatre Project was a co-producer of The New Theatre (TNT) Festivals at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and downtown Baltimore (1976‚Äì1979). Early in the 1980s, the theatre's association with Antioch ended, thus making it impossible to continue offering free performances to the public. 1983 to Present In 1983, the Baltimore Theatre Project began an extensive renovation of its mainstage space, modernizing its facility with the addition of chair lifts providing handicapped accessibility, as well as redesigning its performing and audience spaces. In 1992, Theatre Project came under the direction of Robert Mrozek. During his tenure, such artists as Karen Finley; Danny Hoch; Holly Hughes; James Magruder; da da kamera's Daniel McIvor; Squonk Opera; and David Drake have performed for Baltimore audiences. In the fall of 2001, directorship of the Baltimore Theatre Project was turned over to Anne Cantler Fulwiler, whose background included work in New York City for companies such as Meredith Monk/The House Foundation and Obie Award-winning MCC Theater. Her tenure has seen performances from local companies such as, Blue Rose Theatre, Run of The Mill, Air Dance Bernasconi and national hits, such as Jacksonville playwright and slam poet Al Letson. She has also had a partnership between the Theatre Project and Spur Designs during most of her time with the theater, with Spur providing poster designs for the subscription shows, including their poster for the silent production of Romeo and Juliet. The Theatre often works together with local restaurants and businesses such as Soup's On, Sylvan Beach ice cream factory, and Zodiac Restaurant. In late 2009, Theatre Project became a recipient of stimulus funding from the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation as part of the national stimulus project to fund the arts.

It was established in 1898, as part of a major upgrade of the river's lights  the Doubling Point Light and the separate Range Lights on the point, Perkins Island Light, and Squirrel Point Light were all built at the same time. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Perkins Island Light Station in 1988. Description and history Perkins Island is a small, predominantly wooded island in the southern reaches of the Kennebec River, on the west side of Georgetown Island. It has a teardrop shape, oriented north- south, with the light station located at the westernmost part of the island. The station consists of a tower, keeper's house, barn, bell house, and oil house. The tower is a tapered octagonal wood-frame structure, with its exterior clad in wooden shingles. The lantern light stands above its base, in an octagonal lanternhouse with a surrounding exterior gallery. The keeper's house is a 2-1/2 story L-shaped wood frame structure, with a cross-gabled roof and wooden shingle exterior. To its north stands a small wood-frame barn, also with a gabled roof and shingled exterior. To the south of the tower stands the oil house, a small brock gable-roofed structure. The bell tower is a pyramidal structure covered in shingles, standing near the shore south of the tower. The light station was authorized by Congress in 1895, following recommendations by the Lighthouse Board in 1892 that the Kennebec River's aids to navigation be improved. The tower, barn, and keeper's house were completed in 1898, the year the light went into service. The station also originally included a boathouse, which has not survived. The bell tower was added in 1902, and the oil house was added in 1906. The station was automated in 1959, and most of the buildings were transferred to the state in the 1960s. The light continues to serve as an active aid to navigation.

She was co-principal of Dramatens elevskola in 1877-86. Life Hedwig Willman was bolrn in Stockholm. She was the daughter of the clothe's seller P. A. C. Harling and Emelie Charlotta W√†hlsten. She married the actor Anders Willman (1834-1898) in 1871. =Career= Hedvig Willman made her debut in Ladug√•rdslandsteatern in Stockholm in 1857, and was engaged at the theater company of Johan Anders Oskar Andersson (1813-1866) and then by Edvard Stjernstr√∂m at the Mindre teatern. From 1863 onward, she was employed as an actor at the Royal Dramatic Theatre and, from 1865, as an opera singer at the Royal Swedish Opera in parallel. About her career at the Mindre teatern it was said: :\\"She was there given the opportunity to demonstrate an intelligent judgement, which in union with a lively acting and an elegant appearance made her noted by the audience and resulted in her being among those of the Stjernstr√∂m staff selected to remain in employment when the Mindre Teatern was sold to the Royal Theater in 1863. Kungl. teatrarne under ett halft sekel 1860-1910: personalhistoriska anteckningar (vol. 1) In her capacity of a singer, she was often used within the Op√©ra comique.

About her career as a singer it was said: :\\"... while not the owner of any remarkable resources she managed, by her acting talent and energetic work, solve several important tasks very well.\\" In 1877, she and her spouse were appointed joint principals of Dramatens elevskola. She also gave singing lessons. One of her notable pupils was John Forsell (1868‚Äì1941) who was later the leading baritone of the Royal Swedish Opera. Of Willman as an instructor it was said that: :\\"... there she exposed the energy and the sense, which illustrated her as an professional artist.\\" Hedvig Willman died in Stockholm in 1887 \\"after a long lasting illness\\". In retrospect it was said about her career: :\\"Mrs Willman was in possession of a great deal of stage talent, much will power and perseverance. As a purely dramatic artist she would with no doubt, if she had acted exclusively as such, reached an immensely more important position, than what she was able to reach now, when she gave her strongest efforts to the opera. \\"  References Other sources * Nordensvan, Georg (1918) Svensk teater och svenska sk√•despelare fr√•n Gustav III till v√•ra dagar.

Based in the New London area of New Hampshire, KAT operates out of the Kearsarge Regional High School annually for the entire month of July. Classes primarily run Monday through Thursday, and give students a wide variety of classes, including Chorus, Dance, Visual Art, Photography, Acting, Improv, Costuming, Technical Theatre, and much more. Depending on the class offerings, students have the option of taking up to two morning classes and one afternoon class. The end of the month culminates in performances for those in the higher-level performing arts classes, and are treated as a community or even small professional musical production, open to the public.  Programs  KAT offers a variety of classes within its summer program, which may vary year to year and often attempt to tie into the themes of the mainstage shows. = Youtheatre = KAT's longest- running and mainstage theatre class is Youtheatre. Students audition for parts at the beginning of the month, and participate in rigorous rehearsals 12:45-4PM, Monday through Thursday, to collaborate on large-scale, Broadway- style musicals that show for five performances at the end of the fourth week. Students receive experience working with a large cast, professional music directors and dance choreographers, and working in a professional rehearsal process with integrated technical and performance processes. Youtheatre productions tend to be large, lavish, and generally well received. Recent productions include musicals such as Peter Pan, Godspell, The Wizard of Oz, Disney's Beauty and the Beast, and Seussical the Musical. Alternatively, KAT occasionally produces new and original musicals, such as its award-winning 2002 production of A You & Me World, or the similarly themed Hope Is Like a Feather (2007) and the recurring Mail to the Chief (2000 & 2004). In 2010 they performed A Star Spangled Salute, honoring the soldiers fighting overseas. Casts often number well into the seventies, including performers aged 8‚Äì18 with varying levels of experience, and occasional professional guest performers and returning alumni. = KAT Kabaret = More geared towards the experienced performer, KAT Kabaret begins the summer program with a week-long intensive rehearsal process. Under the direction of Robb Dimmick, students learn to interact with an audience in a more intimate space and setting. Often set in the round or thrust-stage style, performances take place in the school's cafeteria/lobby area, which undergoes major transformations to become the chosen production's setting. Performers interact with audiences before the performances in an optional dessert-theatre. Drinks, desserts and treats are available for additional purchase, and the performers act as waiters, chefs and hosts at individual tables. Productions range from original revues created by Dimmick to full musicals. Recent productions include noted Broadway shows like Putting It Together (2008), Honk! The Musical (2007), and original revues Christmas in July (2006) and A Celtic Cabaret (2005). The revue-style format, smaller casts and more intimate playing space (under 100 seats) give students the chance to build strong ensemble work while allowing each the opportunity to shine in various musical numbers. With an earlier production schedule (beginning one week before normal KAT classes, and performing one week in) older performers often take KAT Kabaret concurrently with KAT Youtheatre, allowing for a largely varied theatrical experience for the month of July. In 2009, Kabaret celebrated its 20th year with Celebrate! 20 Songs for 20 Years, a musical theatre revue which was built around the talents and performing style of each individual ensemble member. For the first time in its 20-year history, KAT cut Kabaret's performing schedule from two weekends down to one, adding an extra matinee showing for younger (and elderly) audiences.  Awards and honors  Throughout its long history, KAT has received many honors and recognitions for both its staff and its productions. = Outstanding productions = In 2002, Dr. Lindberg's original musical production of A You & Me World, performed with an international cast and based on the writings of children across the world, gained recognition as the New England Theatre Conference's pick for Youth & Children's Theatre category before going on to win the prestigious Moss Hart Trophy as the Overall Best Production for 2002. At the awards ceremony in Bedford, New Hampshire, Dr. Lindberg thanked the NETC for recognizing \\"unique and outstanding productions throughout the six state region,\\" and announced that an international tour of the production would be taking place in South Africa the following summer. Additionally, starting in 2008, KAT applied for submission into the statewide New Hampshire Theatre Awards. In its first competing production (The Wizard of Oz), KAT took away 11 top-ten nominations in the community theatre category, including Best Director and Best Production. At the NHTA ceremony on February 10, 2009, KAT was honored to receive two awards for members in its production: Best Costume Design (Jessica Pribble), and Best Actor (Kai de Mello-Folsom, for his work as \\"The Scarecrow\\"). In its second year running, KAT has been nominated for 7 top-ten nominations for its production of Godspell. = Artistic Director Trish Lindberg = Artistic Director Dr. Trish Lindberg has notably been the recipient of numerous awards for her work in the integrated arts and children's theatre. In 2003, she received the National Youth Theatre Director of the Year Award from the American Alliance for Theatre and Education (AATE). The same year, Dr. Lindberg was named the Plymouth State University Distinguished Teacher of the Year (2003) and one of New Hampshire's most remarkable women by New Hampshire Magazine (2003). In 2004, she was awarded New Hampshire Professor of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, and in 2007 she received the Excellence in Education Award from the New Hampshire Department of Education. In 2007, Dr. Lindberg was specially honored with the Excellence in Children's Theatre Award from the New Hampshire Theatre Awards, a statewide non-profit organization which recognizes outstanding productions and contributions to the NH Theatre scene, professionally and in the community sector.  National and international tours  For nearly a decade, KAT has been the hub for a number of international theatrical tours, hosted independently or through the Plymouth State University's International Outreach programs. In these programs, a handful of student performers In 2000, KAT began its tradition with a national tour of its original summer production, Mail to the Chief. Written and conceived by Dr. Trish Lindberg, the production was based on the writings by American children to the next president, and in its touring production featured 45 young performers from Massachusetts and New Hampshire. After premiering in NH, the production was invited to the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., for a special run of performances for its newly commissioned, free public performance Millennium Stage Theatre.

The founder of the Bulgarian school of physical chemistry, Stranski is considered the father of crystal growth research. Stranski headed the departments of physical chemistry at Sofia University and the Technical University of Berlin, of which he was also rector. The Stranski‚ÄìKrastanov growth and the Kossel‚ÄìStranski model have been named after Ivan Stranski. Biography Ivan Stranski was born in Sofia, the capital of the Principality of Bulgaria, as the third child of Nikola Stranski, pharmacist to the royal court, and his wife Maria Krohn, a Baltic German. * Ever since his childhood he suffered from bone tuberculosis, an incurable disease at the time. Stranski finished the First Sofia High School for Boys. Seeking ways to fight the illness, Stranski decided to study medicine, though he returned to Bulgaria disappointed after a year of studies in Vienna. He graduated from Sofia University in 1922, majoring in chemistry, and acquired a doctor's degree in Berlin under Paul G√ºnther with a dissertation on X-ray spectroscopy. In 1925, Stranski joined Sofia University's newly established Department of Physical Chemistry of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics as a reader, becoming the first reader of physical chemistry in the country. By 1929, he was promoted to associate professor and by 1937 he was a regular professor at Sofia University. Stranski attracted prominent scientists such as Rostislav Kaishev and Lyubomir Krastanov to the department. In 1930, Ivan Stranski received a Rockefeller scholarship and along with Kaischew was invited to the Technical University of Berlin, where he collaborated with prominent physical chemist Max Volmer. The 1930s saw the publishing of several important articles which Stranski co-authored with Kaischew and Krastanov, such as the 1939 discovery of Stranski-Krastanov growth. In 1935-36 he was head of department at the Ural Institute of Physics and Mechanics in Sverdlovsk in the Soviet Union. In 1941, Stranski was invited by Walther Kossel to conduct research in Breslau. He put forth his kinetic theory of crystal growth, which became known as the Kossel‚ÄìStranski model‚ÄîKossel independently proposed the same model. With the advance of the Red Army, Stranski returned to Berlin to work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry. As Nazi Germany surrendered, Volmer was taken by force to the Soviet Union and Stranski took his place as the director of studies at the Technical University of Berlin's Department of Physical Chemistry. Despite the heavy damage caused by Allied bombing, not without Stranski's assistance the Technical University was among the few that opened for the 1945 academic year. In 1948‚Äì1949, Stranski was the dean of the Faculty of General and Engineering Sciences. In 1951‚Äì1953, Stranski was rector of the university; he also held the position of vice rector. In 1953, he became deputy director of the Fritz Haber Institute. Until 1963, Stranski taught at the Free University of Berlin. After the Bulgarian coup d'√©tat of 1944 and the installment of a communist government, Stranski was accused of links to the preceding pro-fascist r√©gime and removed from the department that he established. It was not until the 1960s that he was re-accepted as a foreign member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and he would only return to Bulgaria from West Berlin in 1967. He died in Sofia in 1979, but was buried in Berlin. Ivan Stranski was a member of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences (1939), Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (1959), New York Academy of Sciences, the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the Swedish Academy of Sciences.  Honors  He was nominated for Nobel prize by Georg-Maria Schwab. Two modern institutes bear his name: the Stranski Laboratory for Physical und Theoretical Chemistry of the Technical University of Berlin (Iwan N.-Stranski-Institut from 1967 to 2001), and the I.

Forming on August 8, 2009 from an area of low pressure, the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking in a curved path around the edge of a subtropical ridge, Etau continued to intensify as it neared Japan. By August 10, the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a weak tropical storm with winds of 75 km/h (45 mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 992 hPa (mbar). Shortly after, Etau began to weaken. Increasing wind shear led to the center becoming devoid of convection and the system eventually weakened to a tropical depression on August 13\\\\. The remnants of Etau persisted for nearly three days before dissipating early on August 16\\\\. Although Etau did not make landfall, the outer bands of the storm produced torrential rainfall in Japan, peaking at . These rains triggered deadly flooding and mudslides, especially in Hy≈çgo Prefecture. Twenty-eight people were killed by the storm and ¬•7.1 billion (US$87.5 million) in damage occurred throughout the affected region. According to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, a total of 5,602 homes were flooded and 183 were destroyed. Following the storm, 600 Japanese soldiers were deployed from Tokyo to assist in cleanup efforts. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Etau originated on August 5 out of an area of low pressure associated with disorganized convective activity located about 550 km (280 mi) east-northeast of Guam. The following day, the system relocated several dozen kilometers to the north. Convective turning began to appear on satellite imagery and a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) cell to the north provided a northward component to the system's movement. Early on August 7, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the developing system as deep convection consolidated around the low pressure system. Around 0000 UTC on August 8, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a tropical depression. Several hours later on August 8, the JTWC also declared the system a tropical depression, classifying it at 10W. Later that day, convection associated with the depression became disorganized, preventing intensification of the system. The depression generally tracked towards the northwest during the day in response a subtropical ridge to the north. By August 9, the center of circulation became more defined as convection wrapped around it. Around 1200 UTC, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Etau. The JTWC, however, did not upgrade the system to a tropical storm for several more hours. On August 10, the JTWC briefly downgraded the storm to a tropical depression. By this time, the system had re-curved to the east around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. Etau also became slightly disorganized as it began to interact with the baroclinic zone near Japan. Early on August 11, the JMA reported that the storm winds had peaked at 75 km/h (45 mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 992 hPa (mbar). Later that day, the storm once more became slightly disorganized due to increased wind shear; however, the JTWC reported that the storm intensified based on satellite intensity estimates and weather radar imagery from Japan. Later on August 11, the center of Etau became partially devoid of convection, with only a narrow band of shower and thunderstorm activity persisting to the southeast of the center. Increasing wind shear prevented convection from redeveloping and the storm continued to weaken. Early the following day, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Etau as they reported it had weakened to a tropical depression well to the east of Japan. Roughly 24 hours later, the JMA also downgraded the system to a tropical depression. The final advisory on Etau was issued by the JMA early on August 14 as it slowly tracked northward. Preparations, impact and aftermath Debris filled street in Sayo after flood waters receded In anticipation of wind gusts up to and heavy rains, Japanese officials evacuated roughly 47,000 residents from western regions along the coast as gale warnings were declared by the JMA. Officials also feared that flooding from Tropical Storm Etau would mirror that of Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan where at least 14 were killed in the country's worst flood in 50 years. Six flights in the country were canceled after a plane was struck by lightning. Fifteen railway services were also canceled due to heavy rains. According to officials in Japan, nearly 140,000 people were evacuated to shelters in relation to flooding and landslides produced by Etau. As Tropical Storm Etau brushed Japan on August 10, torrential rains fell within its outer bands. In a 24‚Äëhour span, a record of rain fell, triggering extensive flooding and landslides. Initial reports stated that 13 people were killed and 10 others were missing due to the storm. Most of the fatalities took place in Hy≈çgo Prefecture where hundreds of homes were flooded and numerous others were damaged or destroyed by landslides. In some areas, flood waters reached a depth of . One man drowned after driving his car into a flooded street and being overcome by the water. Another person was killed after her home was destroyed by a landslide in Okayama prefecture. In Tokushima, two people were listed as missing and two others sustained serious injuries. Later news reports stated that up to 18 people were missing following further landslides. The affected region was especially susceptible to landslides due to recent seismic activity, with a magnitude 6.4 earthquake taking place on August 10. By August 11, one of the missing persons was confirmed to have been killed during the storm. About 800 people were placed in public shelters and 53,000 homes were left without running water. By August 12, a total of 18 people were confirmed to have been killed and nine others were still missing. Three bridges in Tokushima were also washed away. Days later, the Japanese Fire and Disaster Management Agency finalized the death toll at 26 with one other missing, making Etau the deadliest tropical cyclone to impact Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan since Typhoon Tokage in 2004. Throughout several prefectures, 5,602 homes were flooded and 183 were destroyed. Landslides triggered by the storm damaged another 2,109 structures, most of which were in Okayama and Hy≈çgo prefectures. Following severe damages, in the town of Sayo it requested assistance from the national government. As a result, more than 200 troops were deployed to the town. A post-disaster office was also set up by the prime minister's office crisis management center. An additional 400 troops were deployed to the city by August 11 to assist in rescue efforts.

Born in Toronto, she married F.J. Birchard, an agricultural scientist who was an expert on grain. During the First World War the family moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba. A self described left- wing Liberal, May Birchard was a strong believer in the Canadian Social Gospel movement that originated in Winnipeg during the first part of the 20th century. In 1933, during the Great Depression, Birchard founded The Good Neighbours' Club to aid unemployed men. A few years later a branch was opened in Toronto. The organization continues to operate with a drop-in centre on Jarvis Street. After the death of her husband in 1940, Birchard moved back to Toronto and became active in local politics. She first served as a school board trustee in 1942. At the height of the war, she pushed for daycare for the children of women helping with the war effort for free meals for impoverished children. She was first elected to Toronto City Council in 1946 but was defeated in in 1947. She was defeated several more times before again being elected in the 1956 election. She was reelected in 1958 but defeated in 1960. She returned again in 1962 but was defeated in her final election in 1964. She represented Ward 2 which was a mixed area west of the Don River. The northern part of the riding was Rosedale, the wealthiest part of the city. The southern part was Cabbagetown, the poorest part of the city. Birchard's had much support in Cabbagetown, but she was vulnerable to candidates who could win the backing of Rosedale. Thus Birchard's career was marked by alternating victories and defeats on council campaigns. On the council she pushed for women's rights, most notably on improving access to birth control. She was also an advocate for the poor and for more social housing, including strong support for the Regent Park project that was built in her ward in the era. In honour of her efforts a Toronto Community Housing Corporation building at Dundas and Broadview was named the May Birchard Apartments.

History After Congress chartered the Northern Pacific Railroad (NP) in 1864, the communities along Puget Sound competed to be its Pacific terminus. Tacoma, about south of Seattle, became the winner in July 1873, when the NP, then building north from Portland, selected it. Seattle businessmen immediately incorporated the Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad and Transportation Company to build their own line east, but were only able to build of narrow gauge line to a coal mine at Newcastle. Although it proved successful in carrying coal to the salt water at Seattle, it did not give Seattle its eastward connection.Kurt E. Armbruster, Orphan Road: The Railroad Comes to Seattle, Columbia Magazine, Winter 1997-98: Vol. 11, Num. 4 Columbia and Puget Sound Railway station and docks in Seattle Henry Villard, owner of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, bought the Seattle and Walla Walla in November 1880 and reorganized it as the Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad (C&PS;), intending to connect the two in eastern Washington. Villard gained control of the NP in June 1881, and created the Oregon and Transcontinental Company (O&T;) as a holding company for the NP and other companies that would build branch lines prohibited by the NP's charter. In contrast to the NP's earlier spurning of Seattle, Villard promised that the main line would not end at Tacoma, which it had reached in 1874, but would continue to Seattle. That city granted the O&T; right of way along Elliott Bay between King and Cedar Streets in March 1882, and on August 19 the Puget Sound Shore Railroad was incorporated to build the branch. From a junction with the 1877 Tacoma‚ÄìWilkeson branch at Meeker (east of Puyallup) north to Stuck Junction (south of Auburn), the NP itself constructed the line; the remainder to Seattle was built by the new company. North of Black River Junction, the Puget Sound Shore Railroad built its standard gauge line on the grade of the narrow gauge C&PS; at the base of Beacon Hill, by laying two new standard gauge rails and replacing one of the C&PS;'s rails between them in a dual gauge setup. At a junction point near Addition Street (just north of Atlantic Street), the new line left the C&PS;'s curving alignment and headed directly northwest on a trestle, crossing King Street at First Avenue and then following the waterfront. The last spike of the NP's transcontinental line was driven on September 8, 1883, but Villard's financial empire collapsed later that year, with the branch to Seattle not yet completed. New NP president Charles B. Wright announced that Tacoma would be the railroad's terminus, with Seattle simply the end of a local branch line. O&T; subsidiary Oregon Improvement Company completed the construction, and Seattle's first standard gauge train entered the city on June 17, 1884. Regular service between Seattle and Tacoma did not begin until July 6, 1884, but in late August it suddenly ended when the NP and Oregon Improvement Company could not agree on the operation of what had become known as the \\"Orphan Road\\". The NP incorporated a new lessor subsidiary, the Northern Pacific and Puget Sound Shore Railroad, on August 23, 1884, to acquire the entire line between Meeker and Seattle. Talks dragged on, and finally, in early October 1885, the NP began repairing the damage from a year of neglect, reopening it permanently on October 26. On October 31, 1889, the property of the Puget Sound Shore Railroad was sold to the new NP subsidiary, and on April 21, 1898, the line was sold to the reorganized Northern Pacific Railway. In addition, the company in 1890 and 1891 had partially constructed a branch from Black River Junction around the east side of Lake Washington to Woodinville, which the NP completed in 1903 and 1904. (The NP's line over Stampede Pass would open in 1887, connecting near Wilkeson with the old branch and shortening the distance east from Seattle and Tacoma.) The C&PS; standard-gauged its line in 1897, and in 1901 the C&PS; and NP came to an agreement to split the shared right-of-way, the NP taking the west half and the C&PS; the east half. The NP also built a new line between Argo and Seattle, mostly along Colorado Avenue, and in 1903 the two companies swapped lines north of Argo. The C&PS; now crossed the NP at Argo to reach the Colorado Avenue trackage, and the NP became sole owner of the grade at the base of Beacon Hill north of Argo.Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1904, p. 1203 This grade soon became a minor branch when a straighter line on Second Avenue opened, connecting at the new King Street Station with the Great Northern Railway's new tunnel under downtown. The main line between Meeker and Seattle has remained as a major part of today's BNSF Railway, now forming the north end of the Seattle‚ÄìVancouver Seattle Subdivision,BNSF Railway, Northwest Division Timetable No. 3, effective April 26, 2006 and carries Amtrak's Coast Starlight and Cascades.

While frequently described as being 'silver' some are composed of a large percentage of silver oxide due to their large ratio of surface to bulk silver atoms. Numerous shapes of nanoparticles can be constructed depending on the application at hand. Commonly used silver nanoparticles are spherical, but diamond, octagonal, and thin sheets are also common. Their extremely large surface area permits the coordination of a vast number of ligands. The properties of silver nanoparticles applicable to human treatments are under investigation in laboratory and animal studies, assessing potential efficacy, toxicity, and costs. Synthetic methods =Wet chemistry= The most common methods for nanoparticle synthesis fall under the category of wet chemistry, or the nucleation of particles within a solution. This nucleation occurs when a silver ion complex, usually AgNO3 or AgClO4, is reduced to colloidal silver in the presence of a reducing agent. When the concentration increases enough, dissolved metallic silver ions bind together to form a stable surface. The surface is energetically unfavorable when the cluster is small, because the energy gained by decreasing the concentration of dissolved particles is not as high as the energy lost from creating a new surface. When the cluster reaches a certain size, known as the critical radius, it becomes energetically favorable, and thus stable enough to continue to grow. This nucleus then remains in the system and grows as more silver atoms diffuse through the solution and attach to the surface When the dissolved concentration of atomic silver decreases enough, it is no longer possible for enough atoms to bind together to form a stable nucleus. At this nucleation threshold, new nanoparticles stop being formed, and the remaining dissolved silver is absorbed by diffusion into the growing nanoparticles in the solution. As the particles grow, other molecules in the solution diffuse and attach to the surface. This process stabilizes the surface energy of the particle and blocks new silver ions from reaching the surface. The attachment of these capping/stabilizing agents slows and eventually stops the growth of the particle. The most common capping ligands are trisodium citrate and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), but many others are also used in varying conditions to synthesize particles with particular sizes, shapes, and surface properties. There are many different wet synthesis methods, including the use of reducing sugars, citrate reduction, reduction via sodium borohydride, the silver mirror reaction, the polyol process,Wiley, B.; Sun, Y.; Xia, Y. Synthesis Of Silver Nanostructures with Controlled Shapes and Properties. Accounts of Chemical Research Acc. Chem. Res. 2007, 40, 1067‚Äì1076. seed- mediated growth, and light-mediated growth. Each of these methods, or a combination of methods, will offer differing degrees of control over the size distribution as well as distributions of geometric arrangements of the nanoparticle. A new, very promising wet-chemical technique was found by Elsupikhe et al. (2015). They have developed a green ultrasonically-assisted synthesis. Under ultrasound treatment, silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are synthesized with Œ∫-carrageenan as a natural stabilizer. The reaction is performed at ambient temperature and produces silver nanoparticles with fcc crystal structure without impurities. The concentration of Œ∫-carrageenan is used to influence particle size distribution of the AgNPs. Monosaccharide reduction There are many ways silver nanoparticles can be synthesized; one method is through monosaccharides. This includes glucose, fructose, maltose, maltodextrin, etc., but not sucrose. It is also a simple method to reduce silver ions back to silver nanoparticles as it usually involves a one-step process. There have been methods that indicated that these reducing sugars are essential to the formation of silver nanoparticles. Many studies indicated that this method of green synthesis, specifically using Cacumen platycladi extract, enabled the reduction of silver. Additionally, the size of the nanoparticle could be controlled depending on the concentration of the extract. The studies indicate that the higher concentrations correlated to an increased number of nanoparticles. Smaller nanoparticles were formed at high pH levels due to the concentration of the monosaccharides. Another method of silver nanoparticle synthesis includes the use of reducing sugars with alkali starch and silver nitrate. The reducing sugars have free aldehyde and ketone groups, which enable them to be oxidized into gluconate. The monosaccharide must have a free ketone group because in order to act as a reducing agent it first undergoes tautomerization. In addition, if the aldehydes are bound, it will be stuck in cyclic form and cannot act as a reducing agent. For example, glucose has an aldehyde functional group that is able to reduce silver cations to silver atoms and is then oxidized to gluconic acid. The reaction for the sugars to be oxidized occurs in aqueous solutions. The capping agent is also not present when heated. Citrate reduction An early, and very common, method for synthesizing silver nanoparticles is citrate reduction. This method was first recorded by M. C. Lea, who successfully produced a citrate- stabilized silver colloid in 1889. Citrate reduction involves the reduction of a silver source particle, usually AgNO3 or AgClO4, to colloidal silver using trisodium citrate, Na3C6H5O7.Wojtysiak, Sebastian, and Andrzej Kudelski. \\"Influence of Oxygen on the Process of Formation of Silver Nanoparticles during Citrate/borohydride Synthesis of Silver Sols.\\" The synthesis is usually performed at an elevated temperature (~100 ¬∞C) to maximize the monodispersity (uniformity in both size and shape) of the particle. In this method, the citrate ion traditionally acts as both the reducing agent and the capping ligand, making it a useful process for AgNP production due to its relative ease and short reaction time. However, the silver particles formed may exhibit broad size distributions and form several different particle geometries simultaneously. The addition of stronger reducing agents to the reaction is often used to synthesize particles of a more uniform size and shape. Reduction via sodium borohydride The synthesis of silver nanoparticles by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduction occurs by the following reaction: :Ag+ \\\\+ BH4‚àí \\\\+ 3 H2O ‚Üí Ag0 +B(OH)3 +3.5 H2 The reduced metal atoms will form nanoparticle nuclei. Overall, this process is similar to the above reduction method using citrate. The benefit of using sodium borohydride is increased monodispersity of the final particle population. The reason for the increased monodispersity when using NaBH4 is that it is a stronger reducing agent than citrate. The impact of reducing agent strength can be seen by inspecting a LaMer diagram which describes the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles. When silver nitrate (AgNO3) is reduced by a weak reducing agent like citrate, the reduction rate is lower which means that new nuclei are forming and old nuclei are growing concurrently. This is the reason that the citrate reaction has low monodispersity. Because NaBH4 is a much stronger reducing agent, the concentration of silver nitrate is reduced rapidly which shortens the time during which new nuclei form and grow concurrently yielding a monodispersed population of silver nanoparticles. Particles formed by reduction must have their surfaces stabilized to prevent undesirable particle agglomeration (when multiple particles bond together), growth, or coarsening. The driving force for these phenomena is the minimization of surface energy (nanoparticles have a large surface to volume ratio). This tendency to reduce surface energy in the system can be counteracted by adding species which will adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles and lowers the activity of the particle surface thus preventing particle agglomeration according to the DLVO theory and preventing growth by occupying attachment sites for metal atoms. Chemical species that adsorb to the surface of nanoparticles are called ligands. Some of these surface stabilizing species are: NaBH4 in large amounts, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and/or dodecanethiol. Once the particles have been formed in solution they must be separated and collected. There are several general methods to remove nanoparticles from solution, including evaporating the solvent phase or the addition of chemicals to the solution that lower the solubility of the nanoparticles in the solution. Both methods force the precipitation of the nanoparticles. Polyol process The polyol process is a particularly useful method because it yields a high degree of control over both the size and geometry of the resulting nanoparticles. In general, the polyol synthesis begins with the heating of a polyol compound such as ethylene glycol, 1,5-pentanediol, or 1,2-propylene glycol7. An Ag+ species and a capping agent are added (although the polyol itself is also often the capping agent). The Ag+ species is then reduced by the polyol to colloidal nanoparticles. The polyol process is highly sensitive to reaction conditions such as temperature, chemical environment, and concentration of substrates. Therefore, by changing these variables, various sizes and geometries can be selected for such as quasi-spheres, pyramids, spheres, and wires. Further study has examined the mechanism for this process as well as resulting geometries under various reaction conditions in greater detail. Seed-mediated growth Seed-mediated growth is a synthetic method in which small, stable nuclei are grown in a separate chemical environment to a desired size and shape. Seed-mediated methods consist of two different stages: nucleation and growth. Variation of certain factors in the synthesis (e.g. ligand, nucleation time, reducing agent, etc.), can control the final size and shape of nanoparticles, making seed-mediated growth a popular synthetic approach to controlling morphology of nanoparticles. The nucleation stage of seed-mediated growth consists of the reduction of metal ions in a precursor to metal atoms. In order to control the size distribution of the seeds, the period of nucleation should be made short for monodispersity. The LaMer model illustrates this concept. Seeds typically consist small nanoparticles, stabilized by a ligand. Ligands are small, usually organic molecules that bind to the surface of particles, preventing seeds from further growth. Ligands are necessary as they increase the energy barrier of coagulation, preventing agglomeration. The balance between attractive and repulsive forces within colloidal solutions can be modeled by DLVO theory. Ligand binding affinity, and selectivity can be used to control shape and growth. For seed synthesis, a ligand with medium to low binding affinity should be chosen as to allow for exchange during growth phase. The growth of nanoseeds involves placing the seeds into a growth solution. The growth solution requires a low concentration of a metal precursor, ligands that will readily exchange with preexisting seed ligands, and a weak or very low concentration of reducing agent. The reducing agent must not be strong enough to reduce metal precursor in the growth solution in the absence of seeds. Otherwise, the growth solution will form new nucleation sites instead of growing on preexisting ones (seeds). Growth is the result of the competition between surface energy (which increases unfavorably with growth) and bulk energy (which decreases favorably with growth). The balance between the energetics of growth and dissolution is the reason for uniform growth only on preexisting seeds (and no new nucleation). Growth occurs by the addition of metal atoms from the growth solution to the seeds, and ligand exchange between the growth ligands (which have a higher bonding affinity) and the seed ligands. Range and direction of growth can be controlled by nanoseed, concentration of metal precursor, ligand, and reaction conditions (heat, pressure, etc.). Controlling stoichiometric conditions of growth solution controls ultimate size of particle. For example, a low concentration of metal seeds to metal precursor in the growth solution will produce larger particles. Capping agent has been shown to control direction of growth and thereby shape. Ligands can have varying affinities for binding across a particle. Differential binding within a particle can result in dissimilar growth across particle. This produces anisotropic particles with nonspherical shapes including prisms, cubes, and rods. Light-mediated growth Light- mediated syntheses have also been explored where light can promote formation of various silver nanoparticle morphologies. Silver mirror reaction The silver mirror reaction involves the conversion of silver nitrate to Ag(NH3)OH. Ag(NH3)OH is subsequently reduced into colloidal silver using an aldehyde containing molecule such as a sugar. The silver mirror reaction is as follows: :2(Ag(NH3)2)+ \\\\+ RCHO + 2OH‚àí ‚Üí RCOOH + 2Ag + 4NH3. The size and shape of the nanoparticles produced are difficult to control and often have wide distributions. However, this method is often used to apply thin coatings of silver particles onto surfaces and further study into producing more uniformly sized nanoparticles is being done. =Ion implantation= Ion implantation has been used to create silver nanoparticles embedded in glass, polyurethane, silicone, polyethylene, and poly(methyl methacrylate). Particles are embedded in the substrate by means of bombardment at high accelerating voltages. At a fixed current density of the ion beam up to a certain value, the size of the embedded silver nanoparticles has been found to be monodisperse within the population, after which only an increase in the ion concentration is observed. A further increase in the ion beam dose has been found to reduce both the nanoparticle size and density in the target substrate, whereas an ion beam operating at a high accelerating voltage with a gradually increasing current density has been found to result in a gradual increase in the nanoparticle size. There are a few competing mechanisms which may result in the decrease in nanoparticle size; destruction of NPs upon collision, sputtering of the sample surface, particle fusion upon heating and dissociation. The formation of embedded nanoparticles is complex, and all of the controlling parameters and factors have not yet been investigated. Computer simulation is still difficult as it involves processes of diffusion and clustering, however it can be broken down into a few different sub-processes such as implantation, diffusion, and growth. Upon implantation, silver ions will reach different depths within the substrate which approaches a Gaussian distribution with the mean centered at X depth. High temperature conditions during the initial stages of implantation will increase the impurity diffusion in the substrate and as a result limit the impinging ion saturation, which is required for nanoparticle nucleation. Both the implant temperature and ion beam current density are crucial to control in order to obtain a monodisperse nanoparticle size and depth distribution. A low current density may be used to counter the thermal agitation from the ion beam and a buildup of surface charge. After implantation on the surface, the beam currents may be raised as the surface conductivity will increase. The rate at which impurities diffuse drops quickly after the formation of the nanoparticles, which act as a mobile ion trap. This suggests that the beginning of the implantation process is critical for control of the spacing and depth of the resulting nanoparticles, as well as control of the substrate temperature and ion beam density. The presence and nature of these particles can be analyzed using numerous spectroscopy and microscopy instruments. Nanoparticles synthesized in the substrate exhibit surface plasmon resonances as evidenced by characteristic absorption bands; these features undergo spectral shifts depending on the nanoparticle size and surface asperities, however the optical properties also strongly depend on the substrate material of the composite. =Biological synthesis= The biological synthesis of nanoparticles has provided a means for improved techniques compared to the traditional methods that call for the use of harmful reducing agents like sodium borohydride. Many of these methods could improve their environmental footprint by replacing these relatively strong reducing agents. The problems with the chemical production of silver nanoparticles is usually involves high cost and the longevity of the particles is short lived due to aggregation. The harshness of standard chemical methods has sparked the use of using biological organisms to reduce silver ions in solution into colloidal nanoparticles. In addition, precise control over shape and size is vital during nanoparticle synthesis since the NPs therapeutic properties are intimately dependent on such factors. Hence, the primary focus of research in biogenic synthesis is in developing methods that consistently reproduce NPs with precise properties. Fungi and bacteria A general representation of the synthesis and applications of biogenically synthesized silver nanoparticles using plant extract. Bacterial and fungal synthesis of nanoparticles is practical because bacteria and fungi are easy to handle and can be modified genetically with ease. This provides a means to develop biomolecules that can synthesize AgNPs of varying shapes and sizes in high yield, which is at the forefront of current challenges in nanoparticle synthesis. Fungal strains such as Verticillium and bacterial strains such as Klebsiella pneumoniae can be used in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. When the fungus/bacteria is added to solution, protein biomass is released into the solution. Electron donating residues such as tryptophan and tyrosine reduce silver ions in solution contributed by silver nitrate. These methods have been found to effectively create stable monodisperse nanoparticles without the use of harmful reducing agents. A method has been found of reducing silver ions by the introduction of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. The nanoparticles formed in this method have a size range between 5 and 15 nm and consist of silver hydrosol. The reduction of the silver nanoparticles is thought to come from an enzymatic process and silver nanoparticles produced are extremely stable due to interactions with proteins that are excreted by the fungi. Bacterium found in silver mines, Pseudomonas stutzeri AG259, were able to construct silver particles in the shapes of triangles and hexagons. The size of these nanoparticles had a large range in size and some of them reached sizes larger than the usual nanoscale with a size of 200 nm. The silver nanoparticles were found in the organic matrix of the bacteria. Lactic acid producing bacteria have been used to produce silver nanoparticles. The bacteria Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enteroccus faeciumI, and Lactococcus garvieae have been found to be able to reduce silver ions into silver nanoparticles. The production of the nanoparticles takes place in the cell from the interactions between the silver ions and the organic compounds of the cell. It was found that the bacterium Lactobacillus fermentum created the smallest silver nanoparticles with an average size of 11.2 nm. It was also found that this bacterium produced the nanoparticles with the smallest size distribution and the nanoparticles were found mostly on the outside of the cells. It was also found that there was an increase in the pH increased the rate of which the nanoparticles were produced and the amount of particles produced. Plants The reduction of silver ions into silver nanoparticles has also been achieved using geranium leaves. It has been found that adding geranium leaf extract to silver nitrate solutions causes their silver ions to be quickly reduced and that the nanoparticles produced are particularly stable. The silver nanoparticles produced in solution had a size range between 16 and 40 nm. In another study different plant leaf extracts were used to reduce silver ions. It was found that out of Camellia sinensis (green tea), pine, persimmon, ginko, magnolia, and platanus that the magnolia leaf extract was the best at creating silver nanoparticles. This method created particles with a disperse size range of 15 to 500 nm, but it was also found that the particle size could be controlled by varying the reaction temperature. The speed at which the ions were reduced by the magnolia leaf extract was comparable to those of using chemicals to reduce. The use of plants, microbes, and fungi in the production of silver nanoparticles is leading the way to more environmentally sound production of silver nanoparticles. A green method is available for synthesizing silver nanoparticles using Amaranthus gangeticus Linn leaf extract. =Products and functionalization= Synthetic protocols for silver nanoparticle production can be modified to produce silver nanoparticles with non-spherical geometries and also to functionalize nanoparticles with different materials, such as silica. Creating silver nanoparticles of different shapes and surface coatings allows for greater control over their size-specific properties. Anisotropic structures Silver nanoparticles can be synthesized in a variety of non-spherical (anisotropic) shapes. Because silver, like other noble metals, exhibits a size and shape dependent optical effect known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at the nanoscale, the ability to synthesize Ag nanoparticles in different shapes vastly increases the ability to tune their optical behavior. For example, the wavelength at which LSPR occurs for a nanoparticle of one morphology (e.g. a sphere) will be different if that sphere is changed into a different shape. This shape dependence allows a silver nanoparticle to experience optical enhancement at a range of different wavelengths, even by keeping the size relatively constant, just by changing its shape. This aspect can be exploited in synthesis to promote change in shape of nanoparticles through light interaction. The applications of this shape-exploited expansion of optical behavior range from developing more sensitive biosensors to increasing the longevity of textiles. =Triangular nanoprisms= Triangular-shaped nanoparticles are a canonical type of anisotropic morphology studied for both gold and silver. Though many different techniques for silver nanoprism synthesis exist, several methods employ a seed-mediated approach, which involves first synthesizing small (3-5 nm diameter) silver nanoparticles that offer a template for shape- directed growth into triangular nanostructures.Dong, X.; Ji, X.; Jing, J.; Li, M.; Li, J.; Yang, W J. Phys. Chem. C 2010; 114, 2070-2074. The silver seeds are synthesized by mixing silver nitrate and sodium citrate in aqueous solution and then rapidly adding sodium borohydride. Additional silver nitrate is added to the seed solution at low temperature, and the prisms are grown by slowly reducing the excess silver nitrate using ascorbic acid. With the seed- mediated approach to silver nanoprism synthesis, selectivity of one shape over another can in part be controlled by the capping ligand. Using essentially the same procedure above but changing citrate to poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) yields cube and rod-shaped nanostructures instead of triangular nanoprisms. In addition to the seed mediated technique, silver nanoprisms can also be synthesized using a photo-mediated approach, in which preexisting spherical silver nanoparticles are transformed into triangular nanoprisms simply by exposing the reaction mixture to high intensities of light. =Nanocubes= Silver nanocubes can be synthesized using ethylene glycol as a reducing agent and PVP as a capping agent, in a polyol synthesis reaction (vide supra). A typical synthesis using these reagents involves adding fresh silver nitrate and PVP to a solution of ethylene glycol heated at 140 ¬∞C. This procedure can actually be modified to produce another anisotropic silver nanostructure, nanowires, by just allowing the silver nitrate solution to age before using it in the synthesis. By allowing the silver nitrate solution to age, the initial nanostructure formed during the synthesis is slightly different than that obtained with fresh silver nitrate, which influences the growth process, and therefore, the morphology of the final product. Coating with silica General procedure for coating colloid particles in silica. First PVP is absorbed onto the colloidal surface. These particles are put into a solution of ammonia in ethanol. the particle then begins to grow by addition of Si(OEt)4. Electron micrograph of core-shell nanoparticles, which comprise dark silver cores and light silica shells In this method, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is dissolved in water by sonication and mixed with silver colloid particles. Active stirring ensures the PVP has adsorbed to the nanoparticle surface. Centrifuging separates the PVP coated nanoparticles which are then transferred to a solution of ethanol to be centrifuged further and placed in a solution of ammonia, ethanol and Si(OEt4) (TES). Stirring for twelve hours results in the silica shell being formed consisting of a surrounding layer of silicon oxide with an ether linkage available to add functionality. Varying the amount of TES allows for different thicknesses of shells formed. This technique is popular due to the ability to add a variety of functionality to the exposed silica surface. Metrology A number of reference materials are available for silver nanoparticles. NIST RM 8017 contains 75 nm silver nanoparticles embedded in a cake of the polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone to stabilize them against oxidation for a long shelf life. They have reference values for mean particle size using dynamic light scattering, ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy; and size distribution reference values for the latter two methods. The BAM-N001 certified reference material contains silver nanoparticles with a specified size distribution with a number-weighted median size of 12.6 nm measured by small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Use =Catalysis= Using silver nanoparticles for catalysis has been gaining attention in recent years. Although the most common applications are for medicinal or antibacterial purposes, silver nanoparticles have been demonstrated to show catalytic redox properties for dyes, benzene, carbon monoxide, and likely other compounds. NOTE: This paragraph is a general description of nanoparticle properties for catalysis; it is not exclusive to silver nanoparticles. The size of a nanoparticle greatly determines the properties that it exhibits due to various quantum effects. Additionally, the chemical environment of the nanoparticle plays a large role on the catalytic properties. With this in mind, it is important to note that heterogeneous catalysis takes place by adsorption of the reactant species to the catalytic substrate. When polymers, complex ligands, or surfactants are used to prevent coalescence of the nanoparticles, the catalytic ability is frequently hindered due to reduced adsorption ability. However, these compounds can also be used in such a way that the chemical environment enhances the catalytic ability. Supported on silica spheres ‚Äì reduction of dyes Silver nanoparticles have been synthesized on a support of inert silica spheres. The support plays virtually no role in the catalytic ability and serves as a method of preventing coalescence of the silver nanoparticles in colloidal solution. Thus, the silver nanoparticles were stabilized and it was possible to demonstrate the ability of them to serve as an electron relay for the reduction of dyes by sodium borohydride. Without the silver nanoparticle catalyst, virtually no reaction occurs between sodium borohydride and the various dyes: methylene blue, eosin, and rose bengal. Mesoporous aerogel ‚Äì selective oxidation of benzene Silver nanoparticles supported on aerogel are advantageous due to the higher number of active sites. The highest selectivity for oxidation of benzene to phenol was observed at low weight percent of silver in the aerogel matrix (1% Ag). This better selectivity is believed to be a result of the higher monodispersity within the aerogel matrix of the 1% Ag sample. Each weight percent solution formed different sized particles with a different width of size range. Silver alloy ‚Äì synergistic oxidation of carbon monoxide Au-Ag alloy nanoparticles have been shown to have a synergistic effect on the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO). On its own, each pure-metal nanoparticle shows very poor catalytic activity for CO oxidation; together, the catalytic properties are greatly enhanced. It is proposed that the gold acts as a strong binding agent for the oxygen atom and the silver serves as a strong oxidizing catalyst, although the exact mechanism is still not completely understood. When synthesized in an Au/Ag ratio from 3:1 to 10:1, the alloyed nanoparticles showed complete conversion when 1% CO was fed in air at ambient temperature. The size of the alloyed particles did not play a big role in the catalytic ability. It is well known that gold nanoparticles only show catalytic properties for CO when they are ~3 nm in size, but alloyed particles up to 30 nm demonstrated excellent catalytic activity ‚Äì catalytic activity better than that of gold nanoparticles on active support such as TiO2, Fe2O3, etc. Light-enhanced Plasmonic effects have been studied quite extensively. Until recently, there have not been studies investigating the oxidative catalytic enhancement of a nanostructure via excitation of its surface plasmon resonance. The defining feature for enhancing the oxidative catalytic ability has been identified as the ability to convert a beam of light into the form of energetic electrons that can be transferred to adsorbed molecules. The implication of such a feature is that photochemical reactions can be driven by low-intensity continuous light can be coupled with thermal energy. The coupling of low-intensity continuous light and thermal energy has been performed with silver nanocubes. The important feature of silver nanostructures that are enabling for photocatalysis is their nature to create resonant surface plasmons from light in the visible range. The addition of light enhancement enabled the particles to perform to the same degree as particles that were heated up to 40 K greater. This is a profound finding when noting that a reduction in temperature of 25 K can increase the catalyst lifetime by nearly tenfold, when comparing the photothermal and thermal process. =Biological research= Researchers have explored the use of silver nanoparticles as carriers for delivering various payloads such as small drug molecules or large biomolecules to specific targets. Once the AgNP has had sufficient time to reach its target, release of the payload could potentially be triggered by an internal or external stimulus. The targeting and accumulation of nanoparticles may provide high payload concentrations at specific target sites and could minimize side effects. Chemotherapy The introduction of nanotechnology into medicine is expected to advance diagnostic cancer imaging and the standards for therapeutic drug design. Nanotechnology may uncover insight about the structure, function and organizational level of the biosystem at the nanoscale. Silver nanoparticles can undergo coating techniques that offer a uniform functionalized surface to which substrates can be added. When the nanoparticle is coated, for example, in silica the surface exists as silicic acid. Substrates can thus be added through stable ether and ester linkages that are not degraded immediately by natural metabolic enzymes. Recent chemotherapeutic applications have designed anti cancer drugs with a photo cleavable linker, such as an ortho-nitrobenzyl bridge, attaching it to the substrate on the nanoparticle surface. The low toxicity nanoparticle complex can remain viable under metabolic attack for the time necessary to be distributed throughout the bodies systems. If a cancerous tumor is being targeted for treatment, ultraviolet light can be introduced over the tumor region. The electromagnetic energy of the light causes the photo responsive linker to break between the drug and the nanoparticle substrate. The drug is now cleaved and released in an unaltered active form to act on the cancerous tumor cells. Advantages anticipated for this method is that the drug is transported without highly toxic compounds, the drug is released without harmful radiation or relying on a specific chemical reaction to occur and the drug can be selectively released at a target tissue. A second approach is to attach a chemotherapeutic drug directly to the functionalized surface of the silver nanoparticle combined with a nucelophilic species to undergo a displacement reaction. For example, once the nanoparticle drug complex enters or is in the vicinity of the target tissue or cells, a glutathione monoester can be administered to the site. The nucleophilic ester oxygen will attach to the functionalized surface of the nanoparticle through a new ester linkage while the drug is released to its surroundings. The drug is now active and can exert its biological function on the cells immediate to its surroundings limiting non-desirable interactions with other tissues. Multiple drug resistance A major cause for the ineffectiveness of current chemotherapy treatments is multiple drug resistance which can arise from several mechanisms. Nanoparticles can provide a means to overcome MDR. In general, when using a targeting agent to deliver nanocarriers to cancer cells, it is imperative that the agent binds with high selectivity to molecules that are uniquely expressed on the cell surface. Hence NPs can be designed with proteins that specifically detect drug resistant cells with overexpressed transporter proteins on their surface. A pitfall of the commonly used nano- drug delivery systems is that free drugs that are released from the nanocarriers into the cytosol get exposed to the MDR transporters once again, and are exported. To solve this, 8 nm nanocrystalline silver particles were modified by the addition of trans-activating transcriptional activator (TAT), derived from the HIV-1 virus, which acts as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). Generally, AgNP effectiveness is limited due to the lack of efficient cellular uptake; however, CPP-modification has become one of the most efficient methods for improving intracellular delivery of nanoparticles. Once ingested, the export of the AgNP is prevented based on a size exclusion. The concept is simple: the nanoparticles are too large to be effluxed by the MDR transporters, because the efflux function is strictly subjected to the size of its substrates, which is generally limited to a range of 300-2000 Da. Thereby the nanoparticulates remain insusceptible to the efflux, providing a means to accumulate in high concentrations. Antimicrobial Introduction of silver into bacterial cells induces a high degree of structural and morphological changes, which can lead to cell death. As the silver nanoparticles come in contact with the bacteria, they adhere to the cell wall and cell membrane. Once bound, some of the silver passes through to the inside, and interacts with phosphate-containing compounds like DNA and RNA, while another portion adheres to the sulfur-containing proteins on the membrane. The silver-sulfur interactions at the membrane cause the cell wall to undergo structural changes, like the formation of pits and pores. Through these pores, cellular components are released into the extracellular fluid, simply due to the osmotic difference. Within the cell, the integration of silver creates a low molecular weight region where the DNA then condenses. Having DNA in a condensed state inhibits the cell's replication proteins contact with the DNA. Thus the introduction of silver nanoparticles inhibits replication and is sufficient to cause the death of the cell. Further increasing their effect, when silver comes in contact with fluids, it tends to ionize which increases the nanoparticles' bactericidal activity. This has been correlated to the suppression of enzymes and inhibited expression of proteins that relate to the cell's ability to produce ATP. Although it varies for every type of cell proposed, as their cell membrane composition varies greatly, It has been seen that in general, silver nanoparticles with an average size of 10 nm or less show electronic effects that greatly increase their bactericidal activity. This could also be partly due to the fact that as particle size decreases, reactivity increases due to the surface area to volume ratio increasing. It has been noted that the introduction of silver nano particles has shown to have synergistic activity with common antibiotics already used today, such as; penicillin G, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin against E. coli and S. aureus. Silver nanoparticles can prevent bacteria from growing on or adhering to the surface. This can be especially useful in surgical settings where all surfaces in contact with the patient must be sterile. Silver nanoparticles can be incorporated on many types of surfaces including metals, plastic, and glass. In medical equipment, it has been shown that silver nano particles lower the bacterial count on devices used compared to old techniques. However, the problem arises when the procedure is over and a new one must be done. In the process of washing the instruments a large portion of the silver nano particles become less effective due to the loss of silver ions. They are more commonly used in skin grafts for burn victims as the silver nano particles embedded with the graft provide better antimicrobial activity and result in significantly less scarring of the victim.These new applications are direct decedents of older practices that used silver nitrate to treat conditions such as skin ulcers. Now, silver nanoparticles are used in bandages and patches to help heal certain burns and wounds. They also show promising application as water treatment method to form clean potable water. This doesn't sound like much, but water contains numerous diseases and some parts of the world do not have the luxury of clean water, or any at all. It wasn't new to use silver for removing microbes, but this experiment used the carbonate in water to make microbes even more vulnerable to silver.Giaimo, Cara (24 March 2015) \\"Silver Nanoparticles Could Give Millions Microbe-free Drinking Water\\". PBS NOVA Next. First the scientists of the experiment use the nanopaticles to remove certain pesticides from the water, ones that prove fatal to people if ingested. Several other tests have shown that the silver nanoparticles were capable of removing certain ions in water as well, like iron, lead, and arsenic. But that is not the only reason why the silver nanoparticles are so appealing, they do not require any external force (no electricity of hydrolics) for the reaction to occur.Prasad, R. (7 May 2013) \\"Affordable water purification using silver nanoparticles\\", The Hindu. Conversely post-consumer silver nanoparticles in waste water may adversely impact biological agents used in waste water treatment. =Consumer Goods= Household applications There are instances in which silver nanoparticles and colloidal silver are used in consumer goods. Samsung for example claimed that the use of silver nanoparticles in washing machines would help to sterilize clothes and water during the washing and rinsing functions, and allow clothes to be cleaned without the need for hot water. The nanoparticles in these appliances are synthesized using electrolysis. Through electrolysis, silver is extracted from metal plates and then turned into silver nanoparticles by a reduction agent. This method avoids the drying, cleaning, and re-dispersion processes, which are generally required with alternative colloidal synthesis methods. Importantly, the electrolysis strategy also decreases the production cost of Ag nanoparticles, making these washing machines more affordable to manufacture. Samsung has described the system: > [A] grapefruit-sized device alongside the [washer] tub uses electrical > currents to nanoshave two silver plates the size of large chewing gum > sticks. Resulting in positively charged silver atoms-silver ions (Ag+)-are > injected into the tub during the wash cycle. Samsung's description of the Ag nanoparticle generating process seems to contradict its advertisement of silver nanoparticles. Instead, the statement indicates that laundry cycles. When clothes are run through the cycle, the intended mode of action is that bacteria contained in the water are sterilized as they interact with the silver present in the washing tub. As a result, these washing machines can provide antibacterial and sterilization benefits on top of conventional washing methods. Samsung has commented on the lifetime of these silver-containing washing machines. The electrolysis of silver generates over 400 billion silver ions during each wash cycle. Given the size of the silver source (two ‚Äúgum-sized‚Äù plate of Ag), Samsung estimates that these plates can last up to 3000 wash cycles. These plans by Samsung were not overlooked by regulatory agencies. Agencies investigating nanoparticle use include but are not limited to: the U.S. FDA, U.S. EPA, SIAA of Japan, and Korea's Testing and Research Institute for Chemical Industry and FITI Testing & Research Institute. These various agencies plan to regulate silver nanoparticles in appliances. These washing machines are some of the first cases in which the EPA has sought to regulate nanoparticles in consumer goods. Samsung stated that the silver gets washed away in the sewer and regulatory agencies worry over what that means for wastewater treatment streams. Currently, the EPA classifies silver nanoparticles as pesticides due to their use as antimicrobial agents in wastewater purification. The washing machines being developed by Samsung do contain a pesticide and have to be registered and tested for safety under the law, particularly the US Federal insecticide, fungicide and rodenticide act. The difficulty, however behind regulating nanotechnology in this manner is that there is no distinct way to measure toxicity. In addition to the uses described above, the European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON) has highlighted that silver nanoparticles are used in colourants in cosmetics, as well as pigments. A recently published study by the EUON has illustrated the existence of knowledge gaps regarding the safety of nanoparticles in pigments. Health and safety Although silver nanoparticles are widely used in a variety of commercial products, there has only recently been a major effort to study their effects on human health. There have been several studies that describe the in vitro toxicity of silver nanoparticles to a variety of different organs, including the lung, liver, skin, brain, and reproductive organs. The mechanism of the toxicity of silver nanoparticles to human cells appears to be derived from oxidative stress and inflammation that is caused by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulated by either the Ag NPs, Ag ions, or both. For example, Park et al. showed that exposure of a mouse peritoneal macrophage cell line (RAW267.7) to silver nanoparticles decreased the cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. They further showed that the intracellular reduced glutathionine (GSH), which is a ROS scavenger, decreased to 81.4% of the control group of silver nanoparticles at 1.6 ppm. =Modes of toxicity= Since silver nanoparticles undergo dissolution releasing silver ions, which is well-documented to have toxic effects, there have been several studies that have been conducted to determine whether the toxicity of silver nanoparticles is derived from the release of silver ions or from the nanoparticle itself. Several studies suggest that the toxicity of silver nanoparticles is attributed to their release of silver ions in cells as both silver nanoparticles and silver ions have been reported to have similar cytotoxicity. For example, In some cases it is reported that silver nanoparticles facilitate the release of toxic free silver ions in cells via a \\"Trojan-horse type mechanism,\\" where the particle enters cells and is then ionized within the cell. However, there have been reports that suggest that a combination of silver nanoparticles and ions is responsible for the toxic effect of silver nanoparticles. Navarro et al. using cysteine ligands as a tool to measure the concentration of free silver in solution, determined that although initially silver ions were 18 times more likely to inhibit the photosynthesis of an algae, Chlamydomanas reinhardtii, but after 2 hours of incubation it was revealed that the algae containing silver nanoparticles were more toxic than just silver ions alone. Furthermore, there are studies that suggest that silver nanoparticles induce toxicity independent of free silver ions. For example, Asharani et al. compared phenotypic defects observed in zebrafish treated with silver nanoparticles and silver ions and determined that the phenotypic defects observed with silver nanoparticle treatment was not observed with silver ion-treated embryos, suggesting that the toxicity of silver nanoparticles is independent of silver ions. Protein channels and nuclear membrane pores can often be in the size range of 9 nm to 10 nm in diameter. Small silver nanoparticles constructed of this size have the ability to not only pass through the membrane to interact with internal structures but also to be become lodged within the membrane. Silver nanoparticle depositions in the membrane can impact regulation of solutes, exchange of proteins and cell recognition. Exposure to silver nanoparticles has been associated with \\"inflammatory, oxidative, genotoxic, and cytotoxic consequences\\"; the silver particulates primarily accumulate in the liver. but have also been shown to be toxic in other organs including the brain. Nano-silver applied to tissue- cultured human cells leads to the formation of free radicals, raising concerns of potential health risks. * Allergic reaction: There have been several studies conducted that show a precedence for allergenicity of silver nanoparticles. * Argyria and staining: Ingested silver or silver compounds, including colloidal silver, can cause a condition called argyria, a discoloration of the skin and organs.In 2006, there was a case study of a 17-year-old man, who sustained burns to 30% of his body, and experienced a temporary bluish-grey hue after several days of treatment with Acticoat, a brand of wound dressing containing silver nanoparticles. Argyria is the deposition of silver in deep tissues, a condition that cannot happen on a temporary basis, raising the question of whether the cause of the man's discoloration was argyria or even a result of the silver treatment. Silver dressings are known to cause a \\"transient discoloration\\" that dissipates in 2‚Äì14 days, but not a permanent discoloration. * Silzone heart valve: St. Jude Medical released a mechanical heart valve with a silver coated sewing cuff (coated using ion beam-assisted deposition) in 1997. The valve was designed to reduce the instances of endocarditis. The valve was approved for sale in Canada, Europe, the United States, and most other markets around the world. In a post-commercialization study, researchers showed that the valve prevented tissue ingrowth, created paravalvular leakage, valve loosening, and in the worst cases explantation.

The island is at the end of a series of ledges extending out from Petit Manan Point, between Dyer Bay and Pigeon Hill Bay, that projects into the Gulf of Maine. Description The Petit Manan light station consists of a light tower, keeper's house, boathouse, and other outbuildings. The tower is a circular granite stone structure, in height and in diameter at its base. Atop this is mounted a two-story twelve-sided lantern house, placing the light's focal plan at . The inside of the tower is lined with brick, and has iron stairs. The keeper's house is a two-story wood frame structure. Accompanying outbuildings include a rain shed (possibly built in 1868), paint shed (1876), generator building (1887), and boathouse (probably built 1868, and enlarged 1900). History It was first established in 1817 as a small stone lighthouse. The present structure was built in 1855, and the keeper's house in 1875. The original lens was an enormous second order Fresnel which is now on display at the Maine Lighthouse Museum in Rockland, Maine. Being in a very exposed position, it has suffered storm damage from time to time. In 1856 a storm knocked out some of its blocks. In 1869, it swayed enough that the weights that turn the lens fell, damaging the staircase. Finally, in 1887, iron tie rods were installed to stabilize it. The light was automated in 1972, at which time the Fresnel lens was removed. The light was out of service for two months in 2001 after a nor'easter damaged its submarine power cable; as a result it was converted to solar power later that year. The light station is part of the Petit Manan Wildlife Refuge and is not open to the public. There is a colony of breeding puffins on the island. There are boat tours to the island. It is the second tallest light tower in Maine and is very similar to the Boon Island Light which is slightly taller and was built in the same year. Petit Manan Light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Petit Manan Light Station on October 30, 1987.

Early floppy disks only used one surface for recording. The term single-sided disk was not common until the introduction of the double-sided disk, which offered double the capacity in the same physical size. Initially, double-sided disks had to be removed and flipped over to access data on the other side, but eventually devices were made that could read both sides without the need to eject the disk. A commercially-made floppy disk \\"notcher\\"Manufacturers sold both single-sided and double-sided disks with the double-sided disks being typically 50% more expensive than single-sided disks. While the magnetic-coated medium was coated on both sides, the single- sided floppies had a read-write notch on only one side, thus allowing only one side of the disk to be used. When users discovered this, they began buying the less-expensive single-sided disks and \\"notching\\" them using scissors, a hole punch, or a specially-designed \\"notcher\\" to allow them to write to the reverse side of the disk. DVDs also are available in single-sided and double-sided formats, often as an alternative to two-disc packages. Both sides can be either single layered (DVD-10) or dual layered (DVD-18) or both (DVD-14). When used for movie releases, double-sided DVDs typically have the widescreen (or letterbox) version of the movie on one side, and the pan and scan (sometimes called \\"fullscreen\\") version on the opposite side, often with different set of bonus content on each side (Many Fox and MGM DVDs have this setup). Some releases place the feature on Side A, and the extra features on the Side B (e.g. The Pianist and Terminator 1 and 2). Some particularly lengthy films (e.g. Schindler's List and Oliver!) are divided between the two sides, starting on Side A and continuing on Side B, and include a prompt for when to flip the disc (identically to a LaserDisc). It is more convenient, however, for movies to be released on single-sided discs, with the film and extras on the same side, and widescreen and letterbox versions packaged separately. DualDisc and DVDplus are two variants on the double-sided DVD format where one side is a compact disc. Both formats were created as potential successors to the compact disc format; in particular, the ability to include both audio and video features on the DVD side was intended to boost album sales by providing consumers with an added incentive to purchase physical albums instead of downloading pirated MP3s. However, both disc formats failed to make any long- lasting commercial impact and faded into obscurity by the end of the 2000s, due to competition from digital downloads and the Super Audio CD and DVD-Audio formats and because of physical design flaws that impeded DualDiscs and DVDplus discs' compatibility with many commercial CD players. Specifically, the CD side of a DualDisc was much thinner than a standard CD (whereas the DVD side was thick enough to meet standardized specifications), offsetting it from the focal length of CD players' infrared lasers, while DVDplus discs were much thicker than both standard CDs and standard DVDs, causing the discs to have difficulties fitting into slot-loading players and disc changers.

North Simcoe landfill (Site 41) was a planned 20.7 hectare (50 acre) landfill site for municipal waste in northern Simcoe County, 40 kilometres northwest of Barrie, Ontario. The site would have received waste from municipalities of Midland, Penetanguishene, Tiny and Tay. The site was slated to begin operation in the fall of 2009, however, Simcoe County Council voted in September 2009 to shelve the project after a massive public protest. County officials claimed the site would use a combination of natural and engineered features to provide containment and protection for the natural environment. Opponents say it was too large of a threat to local groundwater. Background Plans for Site 41 were established to provide the four north Simcoe County with municipalities of Midland, Penetanguishene, Tiny and Tay with a local waste disposal site. These municipalities, along with Port McNicoll and Victoria Harbour, had been using a site known as the Pauze landfill since 1966. Hydrogeological surveys of the Pauze landfill in 1982 and 1983 revealed a leachate plume migrating towards Nottawasaga Bay, and evidence of the illegal dumping of liquid industrial waste. Consequently, the landfill was closed in October 1987, and a new water system would have to be constructed for the impacted residents of Perkinsfield. There are estimates that there is less than 10 years left of waste disposal capacity for North Simcoe, a capacity that was shortened by the diversion of waste originally intended for the Pauze landfill to others in the county, causing the premature closure of one of them. From 1995-2008 Simcoe County hauled more than 200,400 tonnes of waste from the four North Simcoe municipalities to sites elsewhere in the county at an estimated cost of $7.25 million. Throughout the process the County considered alternatives and stepped up its efforts to divert waste from landfill. Since 2003 diversion of curbside waste has tripled and by the end of 2009 the County will have reached a diversion rate of 60 per cent overall. Approvals The site had to pass many Ministry of the Environment approvals associated with opening the waste site, including the Environmental Assessment Act, the Environmental Protection Act, Design and Operations Plan approval, Certificate of Approval and a Permit to Take Water. In total, the process has taken 30 years. In 1989, an Environmental Assessment Board rejected an application for Site 41. The board was highly critical of the methodology that went into selecting potential sites for landfilling, including issues of considering the hydrogeologic acceptability of sites, prioritizing other considerations such as lot size and ownership, narrowing its search options, and not having a clear and 'traceable' process that led to the selection of Site 41. While the board accepted evidence that Site 41 would be hydrogeologically suitable, it would be the flawed methodology of site selection that led it to its ruling. The county challenged the decision by going to the Lieutenant Governor in Council regarding the decision, where the hearing was adjourned in order to allow the county to produce more evidence of investigating other alternative sites. Resuming hearings on Site 41 was challenged by a group known as Wye Citizens' Group and the Township of Tiny. The site received Environmental Assessment Act and Environmental Protection Act approvals in 1995. Construction Construction of the site was supposed to be implemented in six phases, with each phase anticipated to last between four and eight years. As clay is excavated, groundwater located in a sand layer of soil directly below the clay will be pumped out to prevent upward water pressure from causing breaks in the clay base. Pumping, if required, was estimated to last only three to six months during the construction of each phase and would cease once sufficient ballast is in place. The first phase was supposed to be operational in the fall of 2009. =Natural Protective Features= Simcoe County claims a \\"hydraulic trap\\" or upward hydraulic gradient means that groundwater at the site is under upward pressure and will not allow potential contaminants to enter. A layer of clay which ranges from 3.6 to 12 metres in depth restricts upward water flow to 11 millimetres per year. =Engineered Protective Features= Construction of the landfill cells includes: * a high-density polyethylene liner that is supposed to prevent leachate from leaving the site. The liner serves a second function in preventing the entry of water under upward pressure. *A collection system will continuously divert leachate for treatment at an off-site waste water facility. The system consists of a filter layer of stone, a porous geotextile separator layer, a 500-millimetre layer of 50-millimetre drainage gravel, perforated high- density polyethylene drainage pipe at 30-metre intervals, and  a geotextile cushion layer against the liner. If the site opens, a system of groundwater wells is supposed to be monitored to confirm the protective features functioning as designed. Controversy The proposed location is above the Alliston aquifer. The aquifer stretches from Georgian Bay to the Oak Ridges Moraine, and allegedly has some of the purest water on earth, however the county states that these results are from a limited sample, and groundwater at the site sometimes does not meet Ontario Drinking Water Standards. Much public opposition stemmed from the fact the site is located on the aquifer, and from the general distrust of municipal servants after the Pauze landfill incident. In addition, the municipality of Tiny withdrew from the North Simcoe Waste Management Association (NSWMA) in 1986 due to a perceived lack of concern over Tiny's agricultural land, and the NSWMA's handling of the environmental assessment. A group of local citizens, including a deputation of aboriginal women, started a protest movement against the landfill plans and camped at the site to prevent construction. Simcoe County responded by having more than a dozen protesters charged with mischief. Opposition to the site also included former US presidential candidate Ralph Nader, Council of Canadians president Maude Barlow and Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki. The protests were captured in the 2010 Canadian documentary film Water On The Table. The County has invested $10 million in costs for land acquisition, consulting fees, site development, and legal and consulting fees for challenges by opponents to the site. Discontinuing development and future plans In August 2009, Simcoe County voted to put a one-year moratorium on the development of Site 41. On September 22, 2009, Simcoe county council voted to permanently discontinue any plans for the site. The county states that it only has a seven-year capacity left for waste without Site 41, so a consulting firm is now examining a new waste management plan. There were also lingering concerns over the fact that the Certificate of Approval for the site had not been revoked. The county has not ruled out using the site for other waste management purposes, such as for recycling. On May 26, 2010 the operating certificate was revoked by the province, protecting the property from ever being used for waste disposal again. The community effort to stop the Site 41 landfill is cited as a standard by which opposition was mounted against the Highland Companies mega quarry north of Toronto.

In retirement he lived in Hampshire. Private life and family Roy Leonard Dommett, a descendant of an old East Devon family, was born on 25 June 1933, at Southampton. He was educated at Itchen Grammar School and Bristol University, gaining a first in aeronautical engineering in 1954. Employed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough from 1953 to 2000, while it became DRA and DERA, he retired before it divided into Qinetiq and Dstl. He was married in November 1955 to Marguerite Patricia Dawson whom he had met at school, and they had seven sons and one daughter. Dommett's first experience with rocket technology was witnessing the arrival of a V-2 at Southampton. His family had links with the aviation industry (his uncle worked at the Supermarine works in Southampton on the Spitfire). Dommett died on 2 November 2015.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11980063/Roy-Dommett-rocket- scientist-obituary.html Two weeks later he was featured as the lead obituary on BBC Radio 4's tribute programme Last Word. He was survived by his wife Marguerite, who died in 2020, and his seven sons; his daughter predeceased him. Pioneering developments Dommett initially specialised in aerodynamic heating and supersonic flows. He worked on the re-entry vehicle design for Blue Streak, and was more deeply involved in the design and analysis of the Black Knight re-entry requirements. Whilst in the Space Department he was the British member of the ELDO Aerodynamics Committee on EUROPA and a contributor to the design of the Black Arrow. He moved to the weapons department in 1967 for the Polaris improvement studies which culminated in KHG793/Chevaline in 1970 with responsibility for the new delivery system, and was given a Special Merit promotion in 1980. He led on some outstanding UK issues with Trident II and then on the counter measure aspects in the UK contributions to the US SDI studies. He attempted to initiate a number of small studies that would have developed UK system understanding, but funding was not available. In all, he contributed in some way to 32 projects. For ten years he was a member of a Research Advisory Council supporting the Chief Scientific Officer. Chief Missile Scientist Dommett worked at both the RAE and the rocket testing station of Saunders-Roe at High Down on the Isle of Wight, where the United Kingdom's first indigenous rocketry system Black Knight was developed. Dommett was designated 'Chief Missile Scientist' on the key projects Black Knight (nuclear rocket), Blue Streak (nuclear missile),See notes here . and Black Arrow (satellite launcher). Despite the enormous success of all these projects, all were later abandoned on grounds of expense. To date the United Kingdom is the only country to have successfully developed and then abandoned a satellite launch capability. All other countries to have developed such capability have retained it either through their own space programme, or in the case of France through its involvement in the Ariane programme. The nuclear missile programme was abandoned in favour of buying in the American Polaris system; Dommett was the Chief Missile Scientist on the programme of developing Polaris for British use, known as the Chevaline project. Later working life Roy Dommett did, in his later years, voice the regret and upset felt in the British rocket industry by its professionals, following the decision of the British Government to cut funding, and terminate the research.Dommett is quoted on the BBC website here. Following the cessation of the British independent space programme, and independent rocket development, Dommett continued to hold a senior role in British defence. From 1982 he was Chief Scientist for the Special Weapons Department, and then a Principal Consultant on Ballistic Missiles for the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, after his formal retirement. Dommett was almost unique in the UK in having begun work on Black Knight and Blue Streak and continued his career working on Polaris, Black Arrow, the Polaris Improvement programme and Trident, which together constitute all of the major UK missile programmes. During the final years of his life Dommett was one of a hundred leading United Kingdom scientists and engineers engaged by the British Library to document their ground-breaking work in a series of archives and filmed interviews. The programme, entitled An Oral History of British Science includes recordings of Dommett's interviews, which can be accessed through the British Library's Voices of Science system. Decorations For his pioneering research and development work, Roy Dommett received the Royal Aeronautical Society Silver Medal in 1991. Later the same year he was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 2004 the British Rocketry Oral History Programme Conference met in Godalming and made a special 'lifetime achievement' presentation to Dommett, including an evening's biographical presentation through the eyes of family members and professional colleagues.A brief report is published here . Morris dancing Besides being honoured for his groundbreaking scientific work, Roy Dommett was one of the leading figures in the English Morris Dancing tradition, and a touring lecturer on its history and techniques.Many of his lecture notes are extant and available. He was a much-published author on the subject.See for example. He was a founder of the Farnborough Morris in 1954, and danced by invitation with the Traditional Abingdon side from 1960 to 1972. He ran a series of successful instructionals at Halsway Manor, Somerset, at Boys Town, St Athlan, Barry and then at Laines Barn, Wantage. In 1976 he worked as a musician with a new generation of women morris sides including; Fleur de Lys, Goldalming, Minden Rose at Alton and latterly Fleet Morris. He has also toured and instructed in the USA, Australia and New Zealand. Although he was well-known through English morris dancing circles, few of his fellow morris-dancers were ever aware of his professional commitments, until towards the end of his life the passage of time allowed some details to become public. During his working career Dommett attended a morris dancing event near Birmingham, unaware until his arrival that the dancing was taking place at a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament rally. The event was monitored by the UK Security Service, and on his return to work the following week Dommett was interviewed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment security officer, and obliged to explain his presence at the rally. On his retirement from active Morris Dancing a cake was baked in the form of a life- sized model of Dommett's head, which remains a talking-point in British Morris circles.Bring me the Head of Roy Dommett, an on-line article, may be read here. In retirement he still occasionally performed on the accordion.. His work in the field was recognised by the award of the Jubilee Medal and then, in 2001, the Gold Badge of the English Folk Dance and Song Society. In the final years of his life, despite over ten years of very poor health, he made attempts to catalogue and summarise his extensive knowledge of morris. Stave dancing In addition to Morris dancing, Dommett was instrumental in the revival of stave dancing, a style of country dance local to the south-west of England, which he submitted originated during the ‚Äúclub walks‚Äù of nineteenth century friendly societies. Beginning with a series of talks at Sidmouth Folk Festival during the 1980s, he single-handedly popularised the dance style and continued to teach and promote it through workshops and lectures.English Folk Dance and Song Society http://www.efdss.org/efdss-education/resource- bank/resources-and-teaching-tools/jargon-buster#Stave/s External links *British Library video interview with Roy Dommett, 2014 *BBC audio tribute, BBC Radio 4 \\"Last Word\\", November 2015 References Category:Space programme of the United Kingdom Category:English aerospace engineers Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Royal Aeronautical Society Silver Medal winners Category:Morris dance Category:1933 births Category:2015 deaths ","title":"Roy Dommett"},{"id":"23891514","text":"Good Hair is a 2009 American documentary film directed by Jeff Stilson and produced by Chris Rock Productions and HBO Films, starring and narrated by comedian Chris Rock.‚ÄòGood Hair‚Äô TrailerChris Rock's 'Good Hair' Premiering at the Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2009, Good Hair had a limited release to theaters in the United States by Roadside Attractions on October 9, 2009, and opened across the country on October 23. The film focuses on the issue of how African-American women have perceived their hair and historically styled it. The film explores the current styling industry for black women, images of what is considered acceptable and desirable for African-American women's hair in the United States, and their relation to African American culture. Overview According to Rock, he was inspired to make the movie after his three-year-old daughter Lola asked him, \\"Daddy, how come I don't have good hair?\\" She has curly, wiry hair typical of many people of African descent. He realized she had already absorbed the perception among some black people that curly hair was not \\"good\\". Rock delves into the $9 billion black hair industry, and visits such places as beauty salons, barbershops, and hairstyling conventions to explore popular approaches to styling. He visits scientific laboratories to learn the science behind chemical relaxers that straighten hair.\\"Chris Rock gets to the root of 'Good Hair'\\", CNN, February 5, 2009 Rock intended to explore the topic seriously, but with humor. The movie features interviews from hair care industry businesspeople, stylists (Derek J, Jason Griggers and others) and their customers, and celebrities such as Ice-T, Nia Long, Paul Mooney, T-Pain, Raven-Symon√©, Maya Angelou, KRS-One, Salt-n- Pepa, Kerry Washington, Eve, Reverend Al Sharpton, Andre Harrell, Tracie Thoms, Lauren London, and Meagan Good. These public figures discuss their experiences with their own hair, and the issue of how different types and characteristics of black hair are perceived in the black community. Themes Rock explores why black women adopt so many different styles for their hair. Techniques designed to straighten hair appear to be intended to give it characteristics of European (or \\"white\\") hair. Other styles create elaborate designs related to African traditions and recent innovations in fashion. Rock is quoted as saying, \\"I knew women wanted to be beautiful, but I didn't know the lengths they would go to, the time they would spend‚Äîand not complain about it. In fact, they appear to look forward to it.\\" Interviews with public figures The film features interviews with prominent entertainers and other public figures, including Nia Long, Ice-T, Raven-Symon√©, Maya Angelou, Salt-n- Pepa, Eve, Tracie Thoms, and Reverend Al Sharpton. They provide opinions on \\"good hair\\" and recount personal experiences in dealing with their hair. Nia Long says, \\"There's always this sort of pressure within the black community like, if you have good hair, you're prettier or better than the brown-skinned girl that wears the Afro or the dreads or the natural hairstyle.\\" In Jeannette Catsoulis' review of the film, she notes that Rock questions why African- American women adopt a concept of \\"beauty\\" that is not based on the natural characteristics of their hair. Some endure sometimes-painful hair treatments in order to achieve this definition of beauty. If the treatments, such as hair relaxers, are done improperly, they can cause hair loss or burns on the scalp. Al Sharpton says, \\"We wear our economic oppression on our heads.\\" He refers to the hair business, which yields billions of dollars in revenues and has shifted from African-American manufacturers to Asian manufacturers, redirecting the profits from the industry out of the African-American community. To gain insights into the cultural issue, Rock also interviewed students and faculty at Santa Monica High School, customers in hair salons and barbershops, and hair dealers. He visited Dudley Products, one of the few companies owned by African Americans that makes hair products for the African- American community. Reception The film met with positive reviews from critics. Good Hair currently holds a 95% \\"certified fresh\\" rating on aggregate review website Rotten Tomatoes based on 78 reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10. Another review aggregation website, Metacritic, based on 100 reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 72/100 based on 27 reviews. It received the Special Jury Prize Documentary at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.2009 Sundance Film Festival sundance.org Good Hair opened in limited release on October 9, 2009, becoming the fourteenth-highest-grossing film for the weekend of October 9‚Äì11, 2009 with $1,039,220 in 186 theaters with a $5,587 average. The film expanded to 466 theaters on October 23. Criticism In his review, Roger Ebert stated \\"Few people of any race wear completely natural hair. If they did, we would be a nation of Unabombers.\\" Rock responded to critics on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying \\"it's not important what's on top of your head‚Äîit's important what's inside of your head. That is the theme of the movie.\\" Recognition and honors The film received the Special Jury Prize for a Documentary at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.2009 Sundance Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival Official website Chris Rock, Jeff Stilson, Lance Crouther, and Chuck Sklar were nominated for Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America.  Controversies  =Lawsuit from Regina Kimbell= On October 5, 2009, documentary filmmaker Regina Kimbell filed a lawsuit in a Los Angeles court against Chris Rock Productions, HBO Films, and Good Hairs American and international distributors. Kimbell charged that Rock's film is an illegal infringement of her similarly themed documentary, My Nappy Roots: A Journey Through Black Hair-itage, which she says she screened for Rock in 2007.\\"Filmmaker sues Chris Rock over 'Good Hair'\\", Associated Press, 8 October 2009, Retrieved 8 October 2009 Kimbell sought an injunction against the wide release of Good Hair, but a federal judge allowed Rock's film to be released as scheduled.\\"Judge refuses to block Chris Rock film\\" =Rock on The Oprah Winfrey Show= Rock appeared on the popular TV show hosted by Oprah Winfrey to promote and discuss his film. During his second appearance, a roundtable of prominent black women, some from the fashion industry, discussed the issue of hair and self-esteem. Mikki Taylor, beauty and cover editor for Essence magazine, said that the term \\"good hair\\" is no longer relevant to many young black women. She believes that what is now considered \\"good hair\\" is healthy hair. She questioned, > When will our hair cease to be political? Every other group of women can do > what they want with their hair, and it's not seen as making a statement. > We're over that, and we wish everyone else would be over it, too. Ayana Byrd, an editor for Glamour magazine, said, \\"The point is not to say hair is good or bad, it's to say that once we work through the history behind our hair, we can get to a place where it can just be hair.\\" During the discussion, Rock noted that many women used hair relaxers to straighten their hair. Given its cost, it has sometimes been called \\"creamy crack\\". Women of other ethnicities get \\"permanents\\" to curl their hair. Black women use similar products to straighten curly hair. He said that sodium hydroxide (lye), the active ingredient in relaxers, is strong enough to burn through a soda can if left in the solution for long enough. It can damage women's hair or scalps. Rock pleaded with parents to stop exposing their young daughters to relaxers. He argued they should not have to worry about such styling questions before becoming teenagers.

The town was moved south one mile to a nearby railroad and renamed Gordon in 1881. Geography Hampton was located at (32.56747, -98.98.36420). History The town of Hampton was settled around the year 1864, one mile north of present- day Gordon, Texas. Hampton was a wood-structured town on the frontier. A post office opened its doors in 1879, with Robert Rogan appointed as postmaster. Mr. Rogan and a Mr. Cotney were early town businessmen. Jess Neblet was the first merchant selling groceries and dry goods in town. On the religious scene, the First Baptist Church of Hampton was organized 1879, with the Methodist Church following a few months later. Just as Hampton was beginning to thrive, the Texas and Pacific Railway started making its way through southern Palo Pinto County. The new railroad was part of the largest single expansion of the Texas and Pacific system, linking Fort Worth to Sierra Blanca; and it occurred between 1880 and 1881. The track did not go through Hampton proper but was located about a mile south of town. Town leaders met and decided that it would be best for the community to move closer to the railroad and take advantage of what it had to offer. Town leaders included the likes of Albert Lusk, Ben Foster, Jess Neblet, Jim Moore, John Moore, Tod Wood, Alf Beckham, Jasper Odan, Jeff Cowden, and Dock Abels. By late 1881 Hampton was full-swing in the process of relocation to the railroad town of Gordon. Records indicate that the First Baptist Church relocated to Gordon in late 1881 and the Methodist Church made the move in early 1882. The Hampton post office was one of the last official re-locations when it was moved to Gordon, re-opening there on October 17, 1883. http://www.gordontexas.com/history.asp Education The area in which Hampton was located is served by the Gordon Independent School District.

Life He was born in London, and entered Merchant Taylors' School in 1569, with schoolfellows Lancelot Andrewes, Giles Tomson, and Thomas Dove. In 1571 he entered as a commoner at St. John's College, Oxford, and graduated B.A. in July 1573. On 21 July 1589 he graduated M.D. at Leyden, and was incorporated on that degree at Oxford on 22 October 1591. He was elected a fellow of his college, where he was contemporary with his friend Matthew Gwinne. He was examined at the College of Physicians of London on 23 December 1589, admitted a licentiate on 9 May 1590, and a fellow on 25 September 1591. He was elected a censor in 1595, and again from 1597 to 1600, and was four times president of the college (1609, 1610, 1611, and 1618). James I appointed him his physician in the first year of his reign, and knighted him at Windsor on 9 July 1603. When James I was at Oxford on 29 August 1605, Paddy argued before him against two medical theses, 'Whether the morals of nurses are imbibed by infants with the milk,' and 'Whether smoking tobacco is favourable to health.' On 3 September 1609 Paddy's house was attacked by Sir John Kennedy of Barn Elms with a band of \\"furious Scots\\", because Kennedy's estranged wife Elizabeth Brydges was staying there. According to Dudley Carleton the raiders were equipped with hot irons ready to mutilate Paddy, suspected to be having an affair with Brydges.Maurice Lee, Dudley Carleton to John Chamberlain: Jacobean Letters (Rutgers, 1972), p. 113: Chris Kyle, 'Paddy, Sir William (1554-1634)', The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1604-1629, ed. Andrew Thrush and John P. Ferris, 2010. In 1614 the College of Physicians appointed him to plead the immunity of the college from arms-bearing before the lord mayor, Sir Thomas Middleton, and the recorder, Sir Henry Montagu. He pointed out the acts 14 and 32 Henry VIII, which state the privileges of physicians; he also maintained that physicians are by their science surgeons without further examination. The recorder decided in favour of the claim of the College. Paddy attained to a large practice, and enjoyed the friendship of Sir Theodore Mayerne and of Dr. Baldwin Hamey. Mayerne praises him in his preface to his edition of Thomas Muffett's Insectorum Theatrum (1634). On 7 April 1620, with Matthew Gwinne, he was appointed a commissioner for garbling tobacco.I.e. sifting out waste . Raphael Thorius alluded to this role in his Latin eulogy on Paddy in 1626. He sat in parliament as member for Thetford, Norfolk, in 1604‚Äì11. He supported his fellow-collegian William Laud, and called on Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, then chancellor of Oxford, and spoke to him in praise of Laud's character and learning, to gather support for Laud's struggles with the Oxford Calvinists. When in March 1625 James I was attacked by his final illness, complicating gout, of which he died, Paddy was sent for to Theobalds. Thinking the king's case desperate, he warned him of the end, which came two days later.John Nichols, Progresses of James the First, vol. 4 (London, 1828), p. 1031-2. Paddy's copy of the Book of Common Prayer (ed. 1615), which was preserved in St. John's College, Oxford, contains a manuscript note which records the king's last profession of faith. Paddy died in London on 22 December 1634. He was a munificent benefactor of his college at Oxford, to which he gave an organ, ¬£1,800 for the improvement of the choir, and ¬£1,000 towards the commons, as well as many volumes to the library. His tomb is in the chapel of St. John's College. Works His only published work appeared in 1603, a copy of verses lamenting the death of Queen Elizabeth, beginning with the line 'Terminus huc rerum meus huc me terminus urget;' and after praise of her successor, of whom he says 'solus eris Solomon,' ending with the wish 'Sic tamen ut medica sis sine, salvus, ope.'

The WaitƒÅkere Ranges in the west are the remains of a large andesitic volcano, and Great Barrier Island was formed by the northern end of the Coromandel Volcanic Zone. The main isthmus and North Shore are composed of Waitemata sandstone and mudstone, and portions of the Northland Allochthon extend as far south as Albany. Little Barrier Island was formed by a relatively isolated andesitic volcano, active around 1 to 3 million years ago. The Manukau and South Kaipara Harbours are protected by the recent sand dune deposits of the Awhitu and South Kaipara Peninsulas. Recent basaltic volcanic activity has produced many volcanic cones throughout the Auckland Region, including the iconic Rangitoto Island. Basement rocks As with most of New Zealand, the basement rocks of the Auckland Region are composed of greywacke (indurated sandstone, siltstone and mudstone). Murihiku Terrane Greywacke lies beneath the Auckland Region on the western side, and outcrops south of the Waikato River. The Murihiku Terrane is considered to be an accretionary wedge of mainly volcanogenic forearc sediments. It was formed in Late Triassic to Late Jurassic times (220-145 Ma). A line of Dun Mountain- Maitai Terrane rocks are assumed to pass north‚Äìsouth through the centre of the Auckland Region, separating the Murihiku Terrane and Waipapa Composite Terrane. The existence of this terrane at depth is inferred from its distinctive magnetic anomaly (Junction Magnetic Anomaly or JMA) and xenoliths in the Auckland Volcanic Field. Some Murihiku rocks occur to the east of the JMA, forming the Taupiri and Hakarimata Ranges, but it is assumed that these rocks have been shifted to their present position. Hunua Terrane Greywacke lies beneath the Auckland Region on the eastern side, as far south as the Hunua Ranges, and outcrops in the Hunua Ranges, many islands in the Hauraki Gulf (Waiheke, Motutapu, Motuihe, Tiritiri Matangi, Kawau, etc.), and Tawharanui Peninsula. It sometimes includes Chert and Argillite. The rocks are generally fine grained and highly deformed. It was formed in Late Triassic to Late Jurassic times (220-145 Ma). The Morrinsville Terrane Greywacke lies beneath the Auckland Region on the eastern side, south of the Hunua Ranges, and further east to the Coromandel Peninsula. The rocks are generally coarser grained, with massive sandstones and conglomerate. It was formed in Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times (160-120 Ma). Te Kuiti Group coal and limestone The Te Kuiti Group Rocks overlie the basement rocks, and are present in Northland, Auckland, the Waikato, and King Country, although they have often been eroded or covered. Rocks containing coal were formed from swampland in Late Eocene times (37-34 Ma). The land sank and the sea transgressed, and calcareous sandstone, mudstone, and limestone was deposited in Oligocene times (34-24 Ma). The coal deposits outcrop near Huntly and Maramarua, where they are mined. Flaggy limestone bluffs are located in the area south and west of the Waikato River. Northland Allochthon In Early Miocene times (24-21 Ma), a series of thrust sheets were emplaced over Northland, extending as far south as the Kaipara Harbour and Albany areas. The rocks came from the northeast, and were emplaced in reverse order, but the right way up. The original rocks are of Cretaceous to Oligocene age (90-25 Ma), and include mudstones, limestone and basalt lava. These rocks outcrop around Silverdale, Warkworth, and Wellsford, reaching as far south as Albany.Bruce Hayward, Bernhard Sp√∂rli and Mike Isaac (2002). Field Trip 1: Northland Allochthon emplacement, South Whangarei Harbour. Field trip guides, GSNZ Annual Conference ‚ÄúNorthland 2002‚Äù, Geological Society of NZ Miscellaneous Publication 112B, pp 3-10. . West Coast volcanism A volcanic arc became active to the west of the current land in Northland in Miocene times (23 Ma), and gradually moved south down to Taranaki. It produced mainly andesitic strato-volcanoes. Volcanoes were produced in what is now sea to the west of the Auckland Region, near the Kaipara Harbour and WaitƒÅkere Ranges (22-16 Ma), and Waikato Heads (14-8 Ma). The Waitakere volcano has mainly been eroded, but conglomerate from the volcano formed the WaitƒÅkere Ranges. The WaitƒÅkere Ranges also contain many dikes, volcanic plugs, etc., that formed part of this volcano. Waitemata sandstone While the volcanic activity occurred to the west, a rapidly deepening basin developed further to the east, in the Auckland area. These Early Miocene volcanoes, along with the Northland Allochthon, eroded and deposited most of the material that makes up the Waitemata sandstones and mudstones in the Waitemata Basin. The Waitemata sandstones and mudstones form the cliffs around the WaitematƒÅ Harbour and East Coast Bays, and land further north up to Cape Rodney, with outcrops further south down to Mercer and Miranda. Lahars produced the coarser Parnell Grit, found in many headlands around the East Coast Bays. Greywacke pebble beaches can be seen forming a layer in Waitemata sandstone cliffs on Motutapu Island. Coromandel volcanism Shortly after (18 Ma), a volcanic arc developed further east to create the Coromandel Ranges and undersea Colville Ridge. The initial activity was andesitic, but later became rhyolytic (12 Ma). In the Kauaeranga Valley, impressive volcanic plugs remain, as does a lava lake that now forms the top of Table Mountain. Active geothermal systems, similar to those that now exist near Rotorua, were present around 6 Ma, and produced the gold and silver deposits that were later mined in the Coromandel gold rush. Later (5-2 Ma), volcanic activity moved further south to form the Kaimai Ranges. The Hauraki Plains and Hauraki Gulf are believed to represent a rift valley. The Coromandel Ranges used to be much closer to Auckland, and the rift valley is assumed to have developed about 2 Ma ago, due to the clockwise rotation of the eastern North Island, that stretched the land between Auckland and East Cape. The Waikato River used to flow from Karapiro, through the Hinuera Gap, and Hauraki Plains, to come out on the east coast in the Hauraki Gulf. The sediment from Oruanui eruption of Lake Taupo caused the river to change direction, and come out to the west. Rivers around Auckland, that now flow to the east, such as the rivers around Clevedon, used to flow to the west, and deposited rocks from the Coromandel Ranges in the Manukau Harbour. Recent basaltic volcanism of the Auckland Volcanic Province The Auckland Volcanic Province comprises the Auckland, South Auckland, Ngatutura and Okete volcanic fields. Intra-plate basaltic volcanism in the Auckland region started in the south, at Okete, near Raglan in late Pliocene times (2.7-1.8 Ma), and has moved north through the Ngatutura, South Auckland and Auckland fields since then. =Okete Volcanic Field= The Okete Volcanics erupted over short periods, between 1.8 and 3 Ma ago, from at least 27 tuff rings, or scoria mounds, surrounded by lava flows. At Maungatawhiri the initial eruption was of fine-grained volcanic tuffs, thought to be comminuted by water interacting with magma, followed by strombolian activity and lava flows. North of Papanui Point violent phreatomagmatic eruptions have formed tuff rings of airfall and pyroclastic surge deposits. The Okete Volcanics include basanites, alkali olivine basalts, hawaiites, and lavas with ultramafic xenoliths. Lava flows from the Okete Volcanic Field generated the Bridal Veil Falls. =Ngatutura Volcanic Field= Activity then moved to the Ngatutura Volcanic Field, south of Port Waikato in early Pleistocene times (1.8-1.5 Ma). Little remains of this field. =South Auckland volcanic field= Activity then moved to the South Auckland volcanic field, in the area from Pukekawa north to Waiuku and Papakura, in mid Pleistocene times (1.5-0.5 Ma), producing over 100 eruptions. This field includes the lava flows at Hunua Falls, scoria cones that form the Bombay Hills, Pukekohe and Pukekawa, and tuff rings at Pukekohe and Onewhero. The rich soils used for market gardening in this area are the product of the Hamilton Ash tephra formation, not the weathering of the South Auckland volcanic field. =Auckland volcanic field= The Auckland volcanic field,Hayward, B.W., Murdoch, G., Maitland, G. (2011). Volcanoes of Auckland: the essential guide. Auckland University Press. is believed to have started around 250,000 years ago, and is still active. It covers the area from Wiri in the south, through the Auckland Isthmus, to Lake Pupuke and Rangitoto Island in the north, and contains around 50 vents. The field contains many maar craters, generated by eruptions where the magma encountered water, and a series of explosive eruptions produced a large crater, surrounded by a tuff ring. Examples include Lake Pupuke, Onepoto, Tuff Crater, Orakei Basin, Pukaki Lagoon, etc. Many of the craters have been breached by the sea, and are now filled with mud. The eruption of Lake Pupuke caused the Wairau River, which used to come out around Little Shoal Bay, to change its course to north of Milford. Dry fire-fountaining eruptions have produced scoria cones. Examples include North Head, Mount Victoria, Mount Eden, Mount Hobson, Mount St Johns, One Tree Hill, Mount Roskill, Three Kings, Mount Albert, Mount Mangere. Some produced substantial lava flows. For example, a lava flow from Mt St John flows through Sandringham, Morningside, Western Springs, and out to the WaitematƒÅ Harbour, forming Te Tokaroa Reef, which reaches within 500 m of Kauri Point, Birkenhead. Some lava flows contain caves, for example at Wiri, Three Kings, and One Tree Hill. Rangitoto Island is the most recent volcano, erupting around 600 years ago. Apart from the summit, it is composed of Pahoehoe (smooth) and ‚ÄôA‚Äôa (broken) lava flows, which are still largely bare of vegetation or soil. It also has lava caves, near the track up to the summit, that are very accessible to visitors. While the ages of individual volcanoes in the Auckland volcanic field are somewhat uncertain, the following ages have been obtained: *Onepoto: ~250,000 years ago. *Pupuke: ~200,000 years ago. *Orakei Basin: ~85,000 years ago. *Puketutu, Taylors Hill, Mt Richmond, Wiri, Crater Hill: 32,000 years ago. *Three Kings: 28,500 years ago. *Mt Eden: 28,000 years ago. *Mangere Mt: ~20,000 years ago. *Mount Wellington: 10,000 years ago. *Rangitoto Island: 600 years ago. Pumice deposits Over the last few million years, rhyolitic pumice deposits from the centre of the North Island have been washed down into the Auckland area, and form substantial deposits around the Hauraki Plains and Manukau Harbour, Western WaitematƒÅ Harbour, and even up into the Kaipara Harbour. Coastal dunes The Awhitu Peninsula (the west coast from Waikato Heads up to Manukau Heads), and the coastal barriers north and south of the entry to the Kaipara Harbour, are essentially consolidated sand dunes, built up over the last few million years. The black sand on the west coast beaches is known for its high iron content, and is ‚Äúmined‚Äù north of Waikato Heads, being extracted by electromagnets. The iron comes from the undersea volcanoes, to the west of the coast, and from the Tongariro Volcanic Centre, and Taranaki. Quartz sand to the north of Auckland, around Tawharanui and Pakiri, appears white, due to its purity. Geological sites of interest Rangitoto Island is a very recent volcano. Apart from the summit, it is composed of Pahoehoe (smooth) and ‚ÄôA‚Äôa (broken) lava flows. A walk up to the scoria summit passes lava caves. The vegetation has pohutukawa forests, astelia growing on the lava, and a grove of kidney ferns. The coast on Motutapu Island from Islington Bay to Administration Bay starts with Waitemata sandstone cliffs, and finishes with greywacke and chert near Administration Bay. Ancient greywacke pebble beaches can be seen embedded in the Waitemata sandstone cliffs. It is possible to walk from Rangitoto Island to Motutapu Island via a causeway. Motuihe Island has a mixture of Waitemata sandstone, with Parnell Grit in the headlands, greywacke at the south, and even a coastal section with flaggy limestone on the west coast. It is also a bird sanctuary, with kiwi, saddleback, dotterel, oyster catcher, heron, and more common birds such as the fantail, tui, and pukeko. Tiritiri Matangi Island is a rugged island composed of greywacke. It also a bird sanctuary, with rare birds, including saddleback, takahƒì, parakeet, North Island robin, k≈çkako, whitehead, little spotted kiwi, stitchbird and brown teal. Waiheke Island is mostly composed of greywacke. At Stoney Batter, at the eastern end of the island are the remains of a volcano (7-8 Ma), with the remains of a lava flow in the form of large boulders. Lake Pupuke on the North Shore is the crater lake of one of Auckland's earliest volcanoes. Water flows underground through cracks in the lava from the lake to Thorne Bay, where it is discharged by natural springs. At the northern end of Takapuna Beach are the remains of a lava flow, that flowed over a forest, preserving moulds of the tree stumps before incinerating them. Further north along the coast is a mould of a large Kauri tree. Onepoto and Tuff Crater beside the North Shore motorway are examples of explosion craters, that have been breached and are now open to the sea. Onepoto basin has largely been reclaimed and now forms a park, while Tuff Crater hosts a tidal mangrove swamp. Volcanic cones include Mount Eden, One Tree Hill, Mount Albert, Mount Roskill, Mount Hobson, Mount St John, Auckland Domain, Mount Mangere, North Head and Mount Wellington. Most have a large scoria cone and crater(s). They also often have the remains of a MƒÅori pƒÅ (fortified village). Te Tokaroa Reef is a lava flow that flows 10 km from MT St John to the WaitematƒÅ Harbour, and almost managed to cross the harbour. Many of the East Coast Bays beaches, such as Long Bay and Campbells Bay are good places to see the Waitemata sandstone and mudstone cliffs, with embedded Parnell Grit. Shakespear Park, at the end of Whangaparaoa Peninsula is also a good place to visit. Large blocks of basalt rock have been moved from the WaitƒÅkere Ranges to the coast just beyond Army Bay. Further north is Waiwera, with more Waitemata sandstone cliffs and Parnell Grit, and also commercial hot pools. The WaitƒÅkere Ranges have streams which often flow down narrow gorges surrounded by conglomerate rocks formed from debris from the Waitakere volcano. The Piha Gorge, Pararaha Gorge and Karamatura Valley are examples. Maori Bay, just south of Muriwai, has good examples of pillow lava. It is also the home of a gannet colony. Te Henga Beach has large sand dunes behind it, and two lakes behind the same dunes. This area has been used to make several TV series, including ‚ÄúXena: Warrior Princess‚Äù. On the way to the beach, it is worthwhile visiting the Auckland City Walk, to see the native bush, including large kauri trees. Piha Beach is one of Auckland's surf beaches. The area to the south has blowholes, that the sea surges through. Whites Beach, to the north of Piha is also interesting. Further south is Mercer Bay, which has a headland, with an enormous hole that has eroded up a jointed lava dike. Still further south are Karekare Beach and Whatipu Beach, backed by steep cliffs. Sand dunes are accumulating along the shore at an amazing rate, and the beach has grown almost two kilometres wider in the last 100 years. Lakes are developing behind the dunes. All the beaches have black iron sand, that can be extracted by using a magnet. Awhitu Peninsula, south of the Manukau Harbour, is essentially composed of consolidated sand, more than 100 m high. The cliffs are rapidly eroding, and preserved tree stumps and blocks of peat in the cliffs fall down to the beach. The Hunua Ranges are an example of greywacke rock. The route out to Waikato Heads gives examples of the volcanoes of the South Auckland volcanic field. Closer to the river mouth, the geology changes to Murihiku Terrane greywacke. A walk south from the beach gives good access to the greywacke. Travelling south from Waikato Heads on unsealed roads takes you through country roads, among cliffs composed of Te Kuiti sandstone and limestone, and finally out to the Waikato Plains at Te Kauwhata and State Highway 1.

Also known as Prospect Harbor Light, it was first established in 1850. The present structure was built in 1891. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Prospect Harbor Light Station in 1988. Description and history The light station at Prospect Harbor was authorized by Congress in 1847 and went into operation in 1850. At that time Prospect Harbor was home to a significant fishing fleet. The light was deactivated in 1859, after the United States Lighthouse Board claimed it was not needed because the harbor was not used as a shelter during storms. It was reactivated in 1870. In 1891 the station was rebuilt; the present tower and keeper's house date to this period. The brick oil house was added in 1905. The light was automated in 1934, but keepers remained on site until 1951, when its Fresnel lens was removed and replaced by modern optics. The station last underwent major restorative work in the early 2000s; it remains an active aid to navigation. The first tower built (in 1848) was a rubble-stone tower. This tower was replaced in 1891 by the present round wood-frame tower, which is in height and clad in wooden shingles. It is capped by a lantern house which is topped by a polygonal roof, and surrounded by a in iron walkway with railing. The door is on the north side, and there is a window on the west side.

This small portion of Brudenell is now a National Historic Site of Canada called Roma Three Rivers. This French settlement built several significant roads on the island (which they called Isle St. Jean). These are still used today. After taking control of this territory from the French after the Seven Years War, the English burned the settlement to the ground.

It was written by Kirk J. Rudell and directed by series producer James Burrows. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in the United States on March 30, 2006. Guest stars in \\"Buy, Buy Baby\\" include Britney Spears, Wanda Sykes, and George Takei. In the episode, Jack's (Sean Hayes) talk show Jack Talk is completely revamped, after right-wing conservatives take over the gay network, OutTV. The new owners hire the ultra-conservative Amber-Louise (Spears) as Jack Talk's new co-host, infuriating Jack. While Jack is deciding whether or not he will stand up to his new bosses, Karen (Megan Mullally) desires a baby of her own. After seeing Grace (Debra Messing) so happy about her pregnancy, Karen decides she wants a baby and offers to pay a surrogate (Sykes) to carry one for her. Before the airing of \\"Buy, Buy Baby\\", a press release from NBC revealed that the episode would include a scene in which Spears hosted a Christian cooking segment called \\"Cruci-fixins\\". The name of the segment was met with protest from Christian groups, who accused it of mocking Jesus' crucifixion. The network canceled the segment after criticism from the American Family Association. \\"Buy, Buy Baby\\" received generally mixed reviews and, according to Nielsen ratings, was watched by 3.7 million households during its original broadcast. Plot Jack (Sean Hayes) learns that OutTV, the gay television network where he is employed, has been bought by a \\"large corporation\\" and that his talk show Jack Talk will have a co-host \\"to widen the audience.\\" Not in favor of the idea, Jack agrees and meets his co-host, Amber-Louise (Britney Spears). During an episode of Jack Talk, Jack is stunned to realize that OutTV, which has been bought by right-wing conservatives, have made changes to the show, including it being renamed Talk Time USA. Not thrilled at the idea, Jack is told to compromise; Amber-Louise admits to Jack that she is a lesbian, and is merely pretending to be an ultra-conservative Christian to get by in the TV world. She asks him to go along with it, so that he can keep his job. Jack gets on board and informs his guest, actor George Takei, that the network asked that he not reveal he is gay on the show. Will tells Jack not to be let himself be pushed around, and to stand up for who he is. Jack takes Will's advice and does not compromise, which ultimately costs him his job. Grace's (Debra Messing) pregnancy prompts Karen (Megan Mullally) to have a baby of her own. She pays a surrogate, Cricket (Wanda Sykes), to carry her child. Grace, who is bewildered at the idea of Karen having a baby, suspects that the only reason is that she is having one. Karen, however, dismisses the idea. Meanwhile, Cricket begins to have second thoughts on becoming Karen's surrogate, following Karen's strange behavior towards her and Karen's admission on how she and her husband, Stanley, will raise the child. This prompts Cricket to quit and Karen revealing to Grace that the only reason she wanted a baby was to help her marriage. She also admits that she has thought about leaving her husband. Production Britney Spears guest starred in the episode. Her appearance received mixed reviews from critics. \\"Buy, Buy Baby\\" was written by Kirk J. Rudell and directed by series producer James Burrows. In February 2006, it was confirmed that singer Britney Spears would guest star on the show. She rehearsed with the cast on February 11, 2006, and recorded her lines in front of a live audience on February 13 and February 15, 2006. Spears' appearance on Will & Grace was her first acting performance on prime- time television, and her first television appearance since giving birth to a child in September 2005. The show's creators, David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, thought she did a \\"surprisingly good job\\". On March 28, 2006, the Human Rights Campaign announced that actor George Takei would also appear in the episode, in support of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender (GLBT) issues since coming out as gay. In addition, actress Wanda Sykes appears as Cricket. The episode first aired on NBC in the United States on March 30, 2006. According to a press release for \\"Buy, Buy Baby\\" released by NBC in February 2006, the episode was to air on April 13, 2006 (Maundy Thursday), the day before Good Friday and the crucifixion of Jesus. In the press release, NBC said the episode would include a scene in which Spears hosted a Christian cooking segment called \\"Cruci-fixins\\". The name of the segment was met with controversy from Christian groups, who called it a \\"mockery\\" of Jesus' crucifixion. According to the American Family Association (AFA), pressure from themselves and NBC's affiliates, caused NBC to cancel the segment and move the episode's air date. NBC, however, stated that the \\"Cruci-fixins\\" segment was \\"erroneous information\\" mistakenly included in the press release and that it was an idea for another episode that had yet to be written. An NBC spokesperson stated: \\"The reference to 'Cruci-fixins' will not be in the show and the storyline will not contain a Christian characterization at all. We value our viewers and sincerely regret if this misinformation has offended them.\\" AFA responded by claiming that the network was \\"lying\\" in its claim that the segment had never been a part of the episode. A statement on AFA's website read: Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Buy, Buy Baby\\" was watched by approximately 3.7 million households, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode achieved an 11% in the key 18-49 demographics among adults. It was the eighth highest-rated show on the NBC network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. R. D. Heldenfels of the Akron Beacon Journal said Spears' appearance on the show was \\"uninspired\\". Lenny Ann Low of The Sydney Morning Herald commented that Spears as a right-wing co-host was a miss. \\"It proves she can talk and avoid the furniture but her flitting, one-dimensional character feels like a stunt.\\" In Low's opinion, the only thing that saved the episode from a \\"thumbs down\\", was \\"its message about finding the courage to be yourself in a sea of conservatism, saccharine though that sounds.\\" Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune thought Spears \\"bombed\\" in the episode, and Jeff Hidek of Star-News disliked the Southern accent she used in her performance. The Plain Dealer's Mark Dawidziak commented: \\"Granted, the episode wasn't very well written, but Spears seemed more out of place on the show than Megan Mullally's Karen at a sensitivity seminar.\\" A Herald Sun reviewer, however, thought she gave the final season of Will & Grace the \\"send-off it deserved.\\" Rachel Browne of The Sun-Herald said the problem with Spears' performance is that \\"it's impossible to accept her in any role other than her own headline-hugging self.\\" Browne, however, thought her appearance was \\"fun to watch\\". The Sunday Mail was also positive about Spears' performance, commenting that she \\"does well, especially when you remember the dismal Crossroads.\\" Trent Vanegas of Pink is the New Blog said that doing the show was a \\"great move\\" for Spears. Television researcher Tim Brooks, the co-author of the 1979 book The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, commented that Spears' role was a \\"very good way to get her chops into comedy\\", in part because it is \\"very out of type.

The light station was established in 1854 and discontinued in 1933. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Pumpkin Island Light Station on February 1, 1988. The island and former light station are privately owned. Description and history Pumpkin Island is roughly in size and is located off the northern tip of Little Deer Island on the east side of Penobscot Bay. The channel to the east of the island, Eggemoggin Reach, connects Penobscot Bay to Blue Hill Bay further east. The island was chosen (in preference to a site on the mainland to the north) in 1852 to be the site of the station marking the northwestern end of the channel. Construction began in 1854, and the station entered service the following year. The tower is a round brick structure, measuring from its base to the light. It is capped by an octagonal lantern house that was installed in about 1890, replacing an original larger unit. An iron walkway with railing surround the lantern house. There are two windows in the tower, and a frame workroom to the south connects it to the keeper's house. The house is a small, three-bay, single-story, wood-frame clapboarded structure, with a single gabled dormer on the east side and a wing (added in 1887) extending to the south. A small brick oil house stands a short way off, and there is a wood-frame boathouse, built in 1885 and enlarged in 1906, at the boat slip on the north end of the island. The light station was built as part of a comprehensive plan for providing aids to navigation on the east side of Penobscot Bay that was developed in the early 1850s. The light was operated until 1933, when it was discontinued and sold. The island and buildings have remained in private hands since that time.

John Street Methodist Church According to Hoople, \\"For several years after I was a member of a praying band\\". In the early 1890s Hoople began attending the noonday prayer meeting at the John Street Methodist Church at 44 John Street, Manhattan. There he met Charles H. BeVier (born September 5, 1858; died about 1905),Katherine Bevier, The Bevier Family: A History of the Descendants of Louis Bevier (Higginson Book Company, 1916):221; Ernest Alexander Girvin, Phineas F.

House, 1916):322; Ingersol, \\"Century\\". \\"a zealous witness to holiness and choir leader at the largest Methodist church in Brooklyn.\\"Smith, Called, 53; Ingersol, \\"Century\\". According to Nazarene historian Timothy L. Smith, \\"Hoople thought BeVier's \\"fanaticism\\" a pity, and set out to argue his new friend into rejecting sanctification. Instead, Hoople wound up finding the blessing himself\\" in his own shop in 1893.Smith, Called, 53; Floyd Cunningham, ed., Our Watchword and Song: The Centennial History of the Church of the Nazarene (Kansas City, MO: Beacon Hill Press of Kansas City, 2009):61; Miller, 34. Hoople began attending some holiness meetings held in private homes in Brooklyn, \\"where they could worship God in the freedom of the Spirit.\\"Redford, 30. In July 1893 Hoople underwrote the expenses for the first ever camp meeting to be held in the small hamlet of Nanuet, New York, near his country home.\\"WE'LL MAKE THE DEVIL HUM\\"; SO SANG LIEUT.

The NYT indicates erroneously it was at \\"Nannet\\". At that time Hoople was a still a member of Central Congregational Church, which was pastored by Dr. Adolphus J.F. Behrends (born 1839 in the Netherlands; died c.1899 in New York).Behrends was the pastor of the Central Congregational Church from 1883 until his death, see Dolkart, 4, 7. However, by October 1893 Hoople had left the Congregational church and was attending the Methodist church at Windsor Terrace, Flatbush.\\"Mrs. Haeslip Was Dropped\\", Brooklyn Eagle (Tuesday, October 24, 1893):10. In 1895 Hoople indicated that because he became an adherent of \\"Methodist doctrine\\", he was \\"unwelcome in the Calvinistic church that nurtured his early faith in Christ\\".\\"Across a Century: The Heritage of the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America\\", http://www.nazarene.org/ministries/administration/centennial/goals/across/display.aspx. Ministry Soon after his entire sanctification, Hoople continued to operate as a leather merchant in business hours, but each evening he began preaching on the streets,Brooklyn Eagle (February 1, 1895):12. His 1896 US Passport application indicates he was still a leather merchant. in rented halls, and \\"wherever a tiny crack in some mission door appeared\\". Gradually Hoople believed that \\"God was leading him to provide a place where sanctified people could sing and shout to their hearts' content\\". Consequently, Hoople rented a former saloon (next to a brothel) at 123 Schenectady Avenue in Brooklyn.Smith, Called, 53; Ingersol, \\"Century\\"; Cunningham, 61; Miller, 35. Hoople had it cleaned and furnished, and on New Year's Day, 1894, began holding services. On January 4, 1894 Hoople and BeVier, who led a Methodist mission in Brooklyn, opened an Independent Holiness Mission, with Hoople being elected superintendent by the members.Redford, 30‚Äì31; Smith, Called, 53; Ingersol, \\"Century\\"; Cunningham, 61; Miller, 35. From the beginning the basic motivation was to establish a holiness work and especially to preach to the poor.Fred Parker, \\"Those Early Nazarenes Cared: Compassionate Ministries of the Nazarenes\\", Preachers Magazine, (n.d.):32R, http://www.usamission.org/Portals/1/Documents/Those%20Early%20Nazarenes%20Cared%20by%20Fred%20Parker.pdf =Utica Avenue Pentecostal Tabernacle (1894‚Äì1904)= From this mission a congregation developed rapidly, necessitating relocation to a larger facility.

In April 1894 Hoople's father funded the estimated $2,000 cost to erect a simple one-story frame tabernacle-style church building that measured 49.5 feet in length and the same in width on the site.\\"Brooklyn Realty Matters\\", The New York Times (April 22, 1894):12; Norcross, 173; Redford, 31.

See Smith, 53; Redford, 31. The Utica Avenue Pentecostal Tabernacle was dedicated on June 15, 1894see Redford, 1948:100; Smith, 53; Cunningham, 61; Ingersol, \\"Century\\" with the dedication sermon preached at 7.30 pm by Methodist Rev.

At 9.30 am on February 1, 1895 Hoople opened the Bedford Avenue Pentecostal Tabernacle at the corner of south Third Street and Bedford Avenue in east Brooklyn in a former Unitarian church which they leased for $1,000 per year.\\"Mr. Hoople's Unique Church\\", Brooklyn Eagle (Friday, February 1, 1895):12; Timothy L.

The congregation was organised as the Bedford Avenue Pentecostal Church on February 24, 1895, with 20 charter members.The Nazarene Messenger 12 (1907):3.; Redford, 31. By January 1897 this congregation had grown to about 130 members. John Norberry was called to be its pastor.Ingersol, \\"Century\\"; Cunningham, 61. The church was congregational in polity with two elders (Hoople and Ryon), three deacons, and two deaconesses. It was independent of all denominations, and its doctrine was self-described as \\"Bible holiness and entire sanctification obtainable in this life\\".\\"Mr. Hoople's Unique Church\\", Brooklyn Eagle (February 1, 1895):12. It prohibited raising funds through church fairs, entertainments or picnics. Hoople indicated: \\"I do not believe that money for the Lord should be raised through the medium of a man's stomach, or his mere love of amusements. The only offerings that will find favor in His sight is free will offerings.\\" In 1895 Hoople described himself in the Christian Witness as a Congregationalist who had \\"embraced Methodist doctrine\\". This logic lay behind the churches Hoople shepherded in Brooklyn. He rejected American Methodism's episcopal system. Hoople received no salary for his ministry, and paid most of the expenses including rent, gas, and heat himself as the members of his congregation were often impoverished. One 1897 newspaper account indicated: \\"His work in the church is a labor of love. He receives no salary. The little church he built and paid for with his own money.\\" At that time a church representative (possibly Hoople himself) explained: > We are an Independent, dependent body, and are not come-outers but as none > of the evangelical bodies seemed to desire to push holiness as a second work > of grace, and where they had tried this it took a good deal of coaxing and > teaching and then after it was about accomplished some one came along and > upset the whole thing, because they had control of the temporal power and > were opposed to holiness; and as our time here is short and we didn't amount > to much, we thought the most sensible thing for us to do was to walk alone > with the Triune God. Perhaps this may sound strange to some of my Methodist > brethren, but after all you can't expect very much from one who was a > Congregationalist and embraced Methodist doctrine. Holiness is apt to make > us appear to the world a little peculiar.Christian Witness, January 3 and > February 21, 1895, quoted in Smith, 53 > (http://wesley.nnu.edu/wesleyctr/books/2501-2600/hdm2593.pdf) As early as February 1895 Hoople envisioned additional congregations: \\"It is my intention if our two churches become in any way self-supporting to start others in different parts of the town. There is plenty of room for them.\\"Hoople, \\"Mr. Hoople's Unique Church\\", Brooklyn Eagle (February 1, 1895):12. The third church planted was the Emmanuel Pentecostal Tabernacle, which was organised in a deserted church building at the corner of Lewis Avenue and Kosciusko Street, Brooklyn on Labor Day (Monday, September 3), 1895 with Frederick William \\"Fred\\" Sloat (born January 12, 1875, in New York)Sloat was the fifth son and ninth child of Henry Cork (or Corkey) Sloat (born April 2, 1842, in Pine Bush, New York; died August 28, 1906) and Laura Parmeley (or Parmlee) (born October 26, 1841; died 1904). See David Eugene Sloat, \\"The Sloat Family\\", http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~desloat/MayHartSmith.doc. Sloat was converted at age 18, called to preach as a child. See Secretary of the Alumni Association, Alumni Record of Drew Theological Seminary 1867‚Äì1905, (S. G. Ayres, 1906):426. Attended Centennial Collegiate Institute, Brooklyn Polytechnic School. See Alumni, 426. When he became pastor of the Emmanuel Pentecostal Tabernacle, Sloat was not married at the time. He married Mary Emma Rhodes 26 (born January 1875) on October 22, 1897. One source indicates it was October 27, 1897, see Alumni, 426. Sloat and his wife had four children: Florence (born March 12, 1899), Raymond L. (listed as Aymos in one source) (born June 27, 1900), Frederick Parmlee (born February 12, 1906) and Lester (1908‚Äì1910). See David Eugene Sloat, \\"The Sloat Family\\", http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~desloat/MayHartSmith.doc, and US Federal Census 1910. By 1900 Sloat was pastor of an APCA Church in Middle Smithfield Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania. See US Federal Census 1900. By 1901 Sloat had left the APCA and was serving as a supply pastor for the Methodist Episcopal church, see Minutes of the Newark Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church (The Conference, 1901):17, 24, 104. Sloat graduated from Drew Theological Seminary in Madison, New Jersey, in 1904. See Alumni, 426. Also in 1904 he transferred his ministerial credentials to the Methodist Episcopal Church where he was recognised as a deacon and was appointed pastor for two years of the ME Church at Barryville, New York (now Highlands, New York) on the Newark District. See \\"NEWARK CONFERENCE CHANGES\\", Special to The New York Times (March 30, 1904):7. In March 1906 he was ordained as an elder in the ME Church. See Minutes of the Newark Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church (The Conference, 1906):9, 37, and appointed for two years to Rockland Lake and Congers (1907‚Äì1908), and then for four years to the Summit Avenue ME Church, Jersey City (1909‚Äì1913), see Minutes of the Newark Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church (The Conference, 1911):157; In 1916 Sloat was elected to a four-year term on the Board of Examiners. See Minutes of the Newark Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church (The Conference, 1916):11. From 1927 to 1932 Sloat was pastor of the ME Church at Somerville, New Jersey. ordained as the pastor \\"amidst the outpouring of the Spirit\\", with the church membership soon reaching 39.The Nazarene Messenger 12 (1907); Ingersol, \\"Century\\"; Cunningham, 61; Redford, 31. This church relocated to the former Monroe St. P.M. Church at Monroe Street and Stuyvesant Avenue on March 21, 1897, with Sloat still serving as pastor. See \\"The Emmanual Pentecostal Church\\" The Brooklyn Eagle (March 20, 1897):8. =Association of Pentecostal Churches of America (1895‚Äì1907)= Hiram F Reynolds On December 12, 1895 Hoople and BeVier, with the assistance of Hiram F. Reynolds, a Methodist minister who had joined Hoople's group in October 1895, organised the three churches into a new holiness denomination, the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America (APCA),Smith, 54; M.E. Redford, The Rise of the Church of the Nazarene, 4th ed. (Kansas City, MO: Beacon Hill Press of Kansas City, 1948, 1965, 1971, 1974):30, http://wesley.nnu.edu/wesleyctr/books/0101-0200/HDM0145.PDF which was incorporated in the state of New York about April 8, 1896, with Hoople, Norberry and Sloat as three of the six trustees.The others were A.M. Owens, O.J. Copeland, and Harry Elsner. See \\"In State Departments\\", Brooklyn Eagle (Wednesday, April 8, 1896):7. While all of the APCA churches were at that time in Brooklyn, the choice of name indicated clearly that the founders had a vision for it to become a national denomination.Ingersol, \\"Across a Century\\". The APCA proposed union with the Central Evangelical Holiness Association (founded in 1890), and ultimately most of the fifteen congregations of that group became members of the APCA.Smith, 54. After initial discussions held in Hoople's parlor from November 11, 1896, that resulted in a plan of union being developed, the union was finalized on April 13, 1897, at Lynn, Massachusetts.Manual, PCON (1907):12; Smith, Called, 55. at which time the APCA decided to send its first missionaries to India.Cunningham, \\"Watchword\\", 63. A standing missionary committee of twelve members was created to oversee all foreign missionary work, with Hoople elected chairman.Cunningham, 63; Smith, Called, 61. This committee was the only central planning body of the denomination.Smith, Called, 61. While its focus was on its embryonic work overseas, which was to support missionary work from 1898 in India and from 1900 in Cape Verde, its executive committee also increasingly supervised domestic activities. In May 1897 Hoople was accused by two excommunicated church members of using hypnotism to frequently put some members of his congregation into trances that lasted up to three hours in special meetings held after the usual services,\\"The Goodales' Story of Pentecostal Tabernacle Sanctifications; Mr. Hoople's Strange Power\\", Brooklyn Eagle (Friday, May 14, 1897):16. where one woman was allegedly driven insane, and one man even died of a heart attack.\\"Trances at Revival Services; Unusual Happenings at the Pentecostal Tabernacle at Utica Ave.\\", Brooklyn Eagle (Tuesday, May 11, 1897):16. One church member indicated that during her sanctification, \\"I knew nothing of what was going on around me, but I was permitted to see God and he gave me hymns to sing and unhappiness fell from me.\\"Mrs. Elsinore Paulin Vauclair, a deaconess in the Utica Avenue church, and one of the women who passed out during the services, denied the accusations against Hoople, indicating \\"It is the spirit of God which inspires us to act as we do, and Pastor Hoople has no more to do with it than you do.\\"Paulin Vauclair quoted in Bruce Herald, \\"Saw Heaven in a Trance: A Tale of Pentecostal Vision\\", R≈çrahi XXVIII, Putanga 2880, (27 H≈çngongoi 1897):3, http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&d;=BH18970727.2.10&l;=mi&e;=-1010-all. Vauclair indicated that a number of men and women fainted, and that these also occurred when Hoople was absent.Herald, op. cit. Another deacon responded to the accusations: \\"Pastor Hoople possesses no power save that which comes from the Holy Ghost.\\" After the accounts featured in the Brooklyn Eagle and elsewhere, Hoople took a three weeks' trip and the services were more subdued.\\"Rites of the Pentecostals\\", Brooklyn Eagle (May 12, 1897):3. However, on May 27, 1897 Hoople was still scheduled to join a number of APCA ministers at the dedication of the new People's Pentecostal Tabernacle APCA church at the corner of Latham and Division streets, Sag Harbor, New York, on June 3‚Äì4, 1897.See \\"Church Dedication\\", The Brooklyn Eagle (May 27, 1897):5. Among the clergymen of the APCA at that time were W.H. Hoople (spelled Whoople), H.N. Brown, John Norberry (spelled Narberry), F.W. Sloat, Charles Bevier (all of Brooklyn); H.F. Reynolds, New York; F.W. Weed, North Scituate, Massachusetts; A.R. Eagan, Good Ground (now Hampton Bays, New York); Isaac Rumsen, Jamaica, Queens; Andrew Pattie, Noank, Connecticut; and Charles P. Pattie, Norwich, Connecticut. Charles A. Renney was to be ordained pastor of the Sag Harbor congregation. Hiram Reynolds recalled in 1933: > About this time we dedicated a church building, over at Sag Harbor, Long > Island, New York. At the altar service, following the dedication, the power > and glory of God, as in the Old Testament times, so filled the church and > fell on the officiating ministers and upon the people that there was no more > service in the sanctuary. Such grace remained upon the ministry that as they > were trying to walk to their places of entertainment they laughed, cried and > shouted. It took them a long time to reach the parsonage, for en route they > would lean on picket fences, and against buildings, the glory was so great. > After reaching the pastor's home they had to wait a long time on the steps, > too overcome to climb the stairs ... In the days of the late '90s it was the > common experience to see persons fall under 'the power' of God. It was not > infrequent to have them, as they recovered from these visitations, shout, > laugh and demonstrate in various ways. Invariably on these occasions the > glory of God would fill the place and often many of the people ... In these > early days, of which we write, the holiness people nearly everywhere > practiced getting together, especially in cities, or where there were nearby > holiness bodies of different denominational preferences, and having what > they termed 'an all day holiness meeting.' ... We were once having such a > meeting in Brooklyn, N. Y. when at the close of the forenoon service, before > the speaker could call for seekers, the power and glory of God were poured > out upon the entire place, Rev. Wm.

Hoople organized the John Wesley Pentecostal Church on November 11, 1897, in Manchester, CT.Minutes, Manchester CT Church of the Nazarene, p. 3 Reynolds organized churches in Oxford and Springhill, Nova Scotia, in 1902. A congregation in Pittsburgh led by John Norris united in 1899. By 1907 there were churches in Illinois and Iowa. In 1900 the Pentecostal Collegiate Institute (now Eastern Nazarene College) was founded at Saratoga Springs, New York, and relocated to North Scituate, Rhode Island, in the fall of 1903.PCI was incorporated in Rhode Island in January 1903 by Fred A. Hillery, Henry N. Brown, William H. Bache, Henry M. Randall, and Frank L. Sprague, see Rhode Island, Acts and Resolves Passed by the General Assembly, 174‚Äì175. The Act was passed by the General Assembly of Rhode Island on April 17, 1903. By 1900 Hoople was a featured speaker in the Brooklyn Forward Movement, a movement that united pastors of various denominations to conduct co-operative evangelistic and civic activities, and to promote temperance.\\"Movement is Extending\\", Brooklyn Eagle (Friday, February 23, 1900):15; \\"Brooklyn Forward Movement\\", Brooklyn Eagle (Monday, March 5, 1900):15. Their approach was to use churches as the venue for their activities rather than halls and theatres, and to have meetings extended over a longer period rather than those of only a few days.\\"The 'Forward Movement'; Methodist Will Extend the Work on the East Side of the City\\", The New York Times (May 7, 1898):5. Hoople also supported the Prohibition movement and both allowed his churches to be used as venues for temperance rallies and to speak at them.\\"A Temperance Rally\\", Brooklyn Eagle (Wednesday, October 23, 1901):12. On January 1, 1904 Hoople resigned as pastor of the Utica Avenue Pentecostal church exactly ten years after he began the work in Brooklyn.Utica Manual 1904:2. At the 1904 annual meeting of the APCA, the delegates elected Hoople as both field evangelist and superintendent of home missions with an annual salary of $1,200 per year.Smith, Called, 65; Miller, 35. However, by the end of 1904 Hoople resigned his full-time salaried position in the APCA partly because the committee would not act on his recommendations regarding the debt-ridden Pentecostal Collegiate Institute.Smith, Called, 65. While remaining a minister within the APCA, Hooper then worked with Henry B. \\"Harry\\" Hosley (born November 1861 in New York; died 1925), then pastor of the Wesleyan Pentecostal APCA Church in Washington, D.C.Hosley was married to Caroline E. \\"Carrie\\" Hosley (born August 1860; died 1953) by 1892 and had one daughter, Annie E. Hosley (born 1885). After a career as a huckster and a Real Estate agent, Hosley became a Methodist minister in 1893 and was appointed to the Wesley Chapel in Viola, New York, at the Methodist Episcopal Conference at Newark, New Jersey, in April 1895, see \\"M.E. PASTORS APPOINTED; The Newark Conference at Tottenville Ended Yesterday. WOMEN NOT YET TO BE ADMITTED\\", The New York Times (April 10, 1895):7. Later in 1895 he left the Methodists, and became the founding pastor of the APCA church at Spring Haven, New York. See \\"The Rev. H.B. Hosley Installed as Pastor\\", The Washington Times (December 29, 1902):4, http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1902-12-29/ed-1/seq-4.pdf.

Some sources indicate that there was a subsequent relocation to the corner of Hopkinson Avenue and McDonough Street, Brooklyn. The new site was dedicated on Sunday April 14, 1907, and a building seating 800 was constructed and opened about September 1, 1907. The church was to be a memorial to BeVier.Girvin, 174. Union discussions (April 1907) PF Bresee At a meeting held at the Utica Avenue church between the leaders of the APCA (including Hoople and John Norberry) and Phineas F. Bresee, C. W.

In May 1903 Ruth had contact with the APCA at a camp meeting in which he was one of the preachers. As he was considerably impressed with the APCA, he wrote Bresee from Allentown, Pennsylvania, that \\"William Howard Hoople, H. F. Reynolds, and C. Howard Davis led a 'plain, fire-baptized, Holy Ghost people' who conducted \\"about the noisiest and 'shoutinest'\\" camp meeting he had ever attended.\\"See Smith, Called, 130; Charles R.

Only a few weeks earlier, Hoople had written in the Beulah Christian: \\"With some of us our present form of government is a matter of principle.\\"William Howard Hoople, Beulah Christian (February 23, 1907):8. Hoople was willing to unite with the Church of the Nazarene if it would \\"consent to the Congregational form of government; [however] if it is to be the connectional Episcopal form there is one person in the Association who will be left out of the Union ‚Äì the writer.\\"Hoople (February 23, 1907):8; Cunningham, 148. After the plan of union was agreed upon, Hoople indicated that he had submerged secondary matters in order to facilitate \\"a combined attack on the powers of hell and darkness\\".Hoople, Beulah Christian (April 20, 1907):5; Cunningham, 150. Hoople admitted that he had had to \\"gulp a good deal down in order to make the union possible.\\" At the consummation of the union with the Church of the Nazarene, the APCA had 45 congregations and 2,407 members, scattered from Iowa to Nova Scotia, while the Church of the Nazarene reported 48 congregations and 3,827 members at that time.\\"Merging Religious Bodies: Documentary Sources on the History of Ten Nazarene Parent Bodies: A Guide to the Microfilm Contents\\" (Kansas City, MO: Nazarene Archives):1, http://www.nazarene.org/files/docs/merging.pdf =Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene (1907‚Äì1922)= Hoople at General Assembly At the General Assembly in Chicago in October 1907, Hoople started to re-consider his support of the union, and had thought of keeping the churches he had pioneered in Brooklyn out of the merger, but he finally acquiesced.Cunningham, 151. After giving an account of the origin and development of the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America, Hoople informed the assembled delegates: > We thank God for the prosperity we have had; that repeatedly in one section > and another we found openings. Today we have something like forty churches, > and it is wonderful how the Lord has blessed us. Sometimes it seems that > there were periods when things were against us, but we have stood the storm, > and come out the stronger ...

According to C.B. Jernigan, \\"Brother W. H. Hoople addressed the Assembly on the prospective joy of the union of the two churches, and expressed satisfaction in seeing nothing but the spirit of Jesus in all the deliberations. \\"It is holiness that has done it, and Jesus is responsible for it.\\"Charles Brougher Jernigan, Pioneer Days of the Holiness Movement in the Southwest (Kansas City, MO: Pentecostal Nazarene Publishing House, 1919):93, http://wesley.nnu.edu/wesleyctr/books/0501-0600/HDM0527.PDF Nazarene historian Timothy L. Smith recorded: \\"After the unanimous vote for union had been announced, a wiry little Texan started across the platform saying, 'I haven't hugged a Yankee since before the Civil War, but I'm going to hug one now.' At once Brooklyn's William Howard Hoople, his 275 pounds adorned with a glorious handlebar mustache, leaped up from the other end of the platform and met the Texan near the pulpit. Their embrace set off a celebration. The gap between North and South was closed forever.\\"Smith, http://wesley.nnu.edu/wesleyctr/books/2501-2600/hdm2593.pdf, 174. As a result of the consummation of the union, three general superintendents would be chosen. On the first ballot both Bresee and Reynolds were re-elected, with Hoople and Edgar P.

In 1910 Hosley had transferred the ownership of the church's property in Washington, D.C., to an interdenominational holiness trust.Smith, 190. Hoople, \\"a champion of local church autonomy\\", exonerated Hosley, who after June 1913 subsequently resigned and withdrew with the majority of his congregation from the denomination into a new group that was \\"Wesleyan in doctrine\\" but \\"independent and congregational\\" in government.Cunningham, Watchword, 199; Smith, 190.

Reynolds in early 1917 that \\"the only basis under which he would continue to stay in the church was that he be released from all he had formerly agreed to 'in the line of Superintendency.' He would thereafter 'privately and publicly advocate away with all Superintendents.\\"Timothy L. Smith, Called Unto Holiness, 217, http://wesley.nnu.edu/wesleyctr/books/2501-2600/HDM2593.PDF; Cunningham, Watchword, 209.

Hoople preached \\"in barns, buildings that had been shot to pieces, from the tail end of wagons, and auto trucks.

The initial phase of the project resulted in 27,000 feddans of barren desert land was converted to fertile land. There are about 400 water wells in the area with a further 250 under construction. There is also a nursery that includes 26 greenhouses. Different agricultural ventures are being carried out, many of the high yield produce of the area are meant for exportation (mainly to Europe). The area has its own hospital, police station, telephone lines and television transmission. A power plant is current under construction in addition to a livestock slaughter house and meat processing unit. In August 2009, the UAE-based agricultural company, Janan, agreed a contract to cultivate 100,000 feddans (about 42,000 hectares) of land with wheat, corn, and feed.

On the island stand the keeper's house, and a fuel house, both wood frame structures, and a small brick oil house. with By the late 19th century, Boothbay Harbor had become a major commercial and shipbuilding center of Mid Coast Maine, with a growing tourist trade and scheduled steamer service from cities further south. This station was established in 1883 to mark the easternmost entrance to the harbor area, and the western approach to the Damariscotta River. The light was automated in 1965.

Original Run The Heart of Gold Band was formed in early 1980, shortly after Keith and Donna Godchaux had left the Grateful Dead in 1979. Other founding members of the group were guitarist Steve Kimock, drummer Greg Anton, bassist Dexter LaBlanc, and vocalist Greta Rose. Keith Godchaux was killed in a car accident on July 23, 1980, just a few days after the band's first gig. The band continued on for another year, adding keyboardist Mark Adler and replacing Dexter LaBlanc with Donna Godchaux's future husband, David MacKay, before disbanding. A self-titled CD was released in 1998, containing 13 tracks recorded by the original band, 11 of them prior to Keith Godchaux's death. Reformation The band was reformed in 2004 when Donna Godchaux and her husband, David MacKay, were looking to form a band. They originally intended to call the group \\"Godchaux MacKay\\", but drummer Greg Anton got involved and the group was named the Heart of Gold Band. Also involved in the reconfigured group are former keyboardist Mark Adler, percussionist Russ Randolf, Keith and Donna's son Zion Godchaux, Keith's brother Brian Godchaux, and Kinsman MacKay, the son of Donna and David MacKay.

The full text of the commandment reads: Background According to the biblical narrative when God revealed the Ten Commandments to the Israelites at biblical Mount Sinai, they were commanded to remember the Sabbath and keep it holy by not doing any work and allowing the whole household to cease from work.Exodus 20; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043; Sabbath, The New Unger's Bible Dictionary, Moody Publishers, 1988, pp. 1095-1096 This was in recognition of God's act of creation and the special status that God had conferred on the seventh day during the creation week.Exodus 20:11-12; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043 Ancient understanding The Torah portrays the Sabbath concept both in terms of resting on the seventh day and allowing land to lie fallow during each seventh year.Exodus 23:11-12; Leviticus 25:2-4; Sabbatical Year, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 p. 1043 The motivation is described as going beyond a sign and remembrance of Yahweh's original rest during the creation weekExodus 31:17; Sabbath, The New Unger's Bible Dictionary, Moody Publishers, 1988, pp. 1095-1096 and extends to a concern that one's servants, family, and livestock be able to rest and be refreshed from their work.Exodus 23:12, Deuteronomy 5:14; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043 In addition to the instruction to rest on each seventh day and seventh year, periods of seven days are often relevant aspects of Biblical instructions. For example, the quarantine period for suspected skin diseases after initial examination by a priest was seven days, after which the priest would re-examine the skin and pronounce the person clean or unclean.Leviticus 13; Commentary on Leviticus 13, The Hebrew Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 234-238 Other special days included the day after the seventh Sabbath,Leviticus 23:16; Commentary on Leviticus 23, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 262-267 the first day of the seventh month,Leviticus 23:24; Commentary on Leviticus 23, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 262-267 the day of ritual cleansing after being healed from an unclean disease or other event bringing uncleanness.Leviticus 14; Numbers 19; Commentary on Leviticus 24, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 238-241 In addition, in the battle of Jericho, Joshua commanded the army to march around Jericho each day for seven consecutive days and to march around Jericho seven times on the seventh day.Yahoshua 6; Commentary on Joshua 6, The Hebrew Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 473-474 The Torah describes disobedience to the command to keep the Sabbath day holy as punishable by deathExodus 35:2; Numbers 15:32; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043 and failing to observe Sabbath years would be compensated for during the captivity that would result from breaking covenant.Leviticus 26:34-43; Yeremiah 34:14-22; Sabbatical Year, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982, p. 1043 The Torah also describes how special bread was to be set out before Yahweh Sabbath by SabbathLeviticus 24:5-9; Commentary on Leviticus 24, The Hebrew Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 267-268 and describes Sabbath day offerings.Numbers 28:9-10; Commentary on Numbers 28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 340-341 The Day of Atonement was regarded as a \\"Sabbath of Sabbaths\\" Leviticus 16:31; Nosson Scherman, Yom Kippur, Mesorah Publications, 1989, p.57 It was on this day alone that the Kohen Gadol (High Priest) entered the Kodesh Hakodashim (Most Holy Place) inside the Tabernacle where the Ark of the Covenant contained the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were engraved. The presence of YHWH in the Kodesh Hakodashim on that yearly day, upon the mercy seat, required that the Kohen Gadol be first purified by the sacrifice of a bull in a prescribed manner. Entering the Most Holy Place on other days or without fulfilling the ritual requirements would subject the priest to death.Leviticus 16; Commentary on Leviticus 16, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 243-247 In the same way that observing the Sabbath did not prevent Joshua from marching around Jericho for seven consecutive days,Joshua 6; Commentary on Joshua 6, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 473-474 Sabbath observance did not prevent the chief priest Jehoiada from organizing a palace coup on the Sabbath in order to remove queen Ataliah from the throne and replace her with Joash, a rightful heir to the throne. Ataliah had murdered all the other heirs to the throne upon the death of Ahaziah and usurped the throne of Judah for herself. Jehoiada's wife had rescued young Joash, and Jehoiada had kept him hidden for six years while Ataliah reigned as queen over Judah. The priest Jehoiada used the occasion of the transfer of the guard on the Sabbath to proclaim Joash as king because at that time, he could arrange twice the normal guard on duty at the temple of Yahweh. On that day, a covenant was made, Joash was proclaimed king, Ataliah was put to death, the temple of Baal was torn down, idols were smashed, and Mattan, the priest of Baal, was killed.2 Kings 11; 2 Chronicles 22-23; R. Kittel, A History of the Hebrews Vol. II, Williams and Norgate, 1896, pp.286-287 A number of the prophets condemn desecration of the Sabbath with various forms of work, including Isaiah,Isaiah 56; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043 Jeremiah,Jeremiah 17; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043 Ezekiel,Ezekiel 20; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043 and Amos.Amos 8; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043 According to Nehemiah, after the captives return to Jerusalem from Exile, they make a covenant which includes a promise to refrain from desecrating the Sabbath,Nehemiah 10; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043 yet some give in to the ongoing temptation to buy and sell on the Sabbath. As a result, Nehemiah has to rebuke them and station guards to prevent commerce in Jerusalem on the Sabbath.Nehemiah 13; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043 Jewish view Ibn Ezra taught that the Exodus account of the Ten Commandments contains the text exactly as written on the stone tablets and that the different version in Deuteronomy contains Moses' words which remind Israel to obey the commandments, \\"as the your God has commanded you.\\" Ibn Ezra explains that Moses did not need to re- iterate the reference to six days of creation at the beginning of the commandment in Deuteronomy, because the command in Deuteronomy itself refers back to the command from Exodus with the words \\"as YHWH your Elohim has commanded you.\\" Instead, Moses revealed in Deuteronomy the motive for the command that slaves rest on the Sabbath day in order that Israel remember that they were slaves in Egypt and that God redeemed them. Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (the Ramban) also views the Exodus version of the Sabbath day commandment as a direct recitation by God, and the version in Deuteronomy as Moses‚Äô personal reconstruction and exposition. The Ramban explains that Moses wishes to emphasize that the prohibition of work extends even to agricultural work aimed at food production. He further explains the difference in the stated rationals (creation in Exodus, exodus in Deuteronomy). The exodus from Egypt serves as further evidence of Yah's creation of the world. God's awesome display of power during the exodus annuls any doubts regarding YHWH as creator, because only the creator can possess such total control over the elements. Maimonides (the Rambam) gives equal footing to both rationales for the Sabbath command: Christian view =New Testament= Moral imperatives mirroring nine of the Ten Commandments are repeated in the New Testament, but the commandment regarding the Sabbath is notably absent.Warren W. Wiersbe, The Bible Exposition Commentary: New Testament: Volume 1, Cook Communications, 1989, p. 392; Greg L. Bahnsen, Wayne G. Strickland, Douglas J. Moo, Willem A. Van Gemeren, Five Views of Law and Gospel, Zondervan, 1999, p. 81; John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck, The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament Edition, David C.

It was not unlawful to eat on the Sabbath, even if food must be obtained by plucking grain from the ears. It was not unlawful to do good on the Sabbath day. Healing was a work of mercy, and Jesus, portrayed as Lord of the Sabbath, was merciful. Consequently, criticisms of healing on the Sabbath were unjustified.Matthew 12:1-14; Sabbath, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1042-1043 =Catholic views= The Catholic Church views the commandment to \\"remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy\\" (Exodus 20:8-10) as an essential part of observing the command to \\"love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all your mind.\\"(Mark 2:27-28)Catechism of the Catholic Church, The Third Commandment Catholic teaching emphasizes the holiness of the Sabbath day (Exodus 31:15),Catechism of the Catholic Church 2168, The Third Commandment connects the Sabbath with God's rest after the six days of creation (Exodus 20:11),Catechism of the Catholic Church 2169, The Third Commandment views the Sabbath as a reminder of Israel's liberation from bondage (Deuteronomy 5:15),Catechism of the Catholic Church 2170, The Third Commandment and views God's example of resting on the seventh day as an example for human resting and protesting the servitude of work and the worship of money. (Exodus 31:17, 23:12)Catechism of the Catholic Church 2172, The Third Commandment The Catechism of the Catholic Church discusses many incidents when Jesus was accused of violating the Sabbath law, and points out that Jesus never fails to respect the holiness of this day. (Mark 1:21, John 9:16) Jesus is described as giving the Sabbath law its authentic and authoritative interpretation: \\"The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.\\" (Mark 2:27) With compassion, Christ declares the Sabbath for doing good rather than harm, for saving life rather than killing.(Mark 3:4)Catechism of the Catholic Church 2173, The Third Commandment Sunday is distinguished from the Sabbath, which it follows. According to Catholic teaching, ceremonial observance of Christ's resurrection on the first day of the week replaces that of the Sabbath. Sunday is described as a fulfillment of the spiritual truth of the Jewish Sabbath and an announcement of man's eternal rest in God.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2175, The Third Commandment The Catholic Catechism describes Sunday celebration as observing the \\"moral commandment inscribed by nature in the human heart to render to God an outward, visible, public, and regular worship.\\" Thus, Sunday worship fulfills the \\"moral command of the Old Covenant, taking up its rhythm and spirit in the weekly celebration of the Creator and Redeemer of his people.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2176, The Third Commandment The Catholic Church teaches that the Lord's day should be \\"a day of grace and rest from work\\" to cultivate their \\"familial, cultural, social, and religious lives.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2184, The Third Commandmen On Sundays and other holy days, faithful Christians are to refrain from work and activities that hinder the worship owed to God, the joy proper to the Lord's Day, works of mercy, and the \\"appropriate relaxation of mind and body.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2185, The Third Commandment Christians also sanctify Sunday by giving time and care to their families and relatives, often difficult to do on other days of the week. \\"Sunday is a time for reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and meditation which furthers the growth of the Christian interior life.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2186, The Third Commandment In addition to one's own rest, Christians should avoid making unnecessary demands on others that would hinder them from observing the Lord's Day.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2187, The Third Commandment An oration given by Jesus to Saint Elizabeth, Queen of Hungary, along with Saint Matilda and Saint Bridget, titled \\"A True Letter of Our Saviour Jesus Christ\\", which is venerated by Roman Catholics, implores the faithful: \\"If you want to reap an abundant harvest you must not work on Sunday, for Sunday you must go to Church and pray to God to forgive your sins. He gave you six days in which to work and one for rest and devotion and to tender your help to the poor and assist the Church.\\" =Lutheran views= Martin Luther taught that with regard to external observance, the Sabbath commandment was given to Jews alone and not strictly applicable to Christians. Luther did see wisdom in voluntary observance of a day to rest from labor and pay particular attention to Christian duties of reading the Scriptures, worshiping God, and prayer. He thought that this need not occur on any particular day, but should continue on Sunday (the Lord's day), since this was the long established practice, and there was no reason to create disorder by unnecessary innovation. Luther emphasized that no day is made holy by rest alone, but rather by the individual seeking to be holy through washing himself in God's word. From Martin Luther there is also the following comments on the reason for, importance of, and continuing need for the seventh-day Sabbath, specifically, found in Luther on the Creation: A Critical and Devotional Commentary on Genesis 1-3: Here one does not find Luther saying the Sabbath command of Genesis 1 is something that could be dispensed with. It was the command of the Creator of the universe and had a specific purpose. = Reformed views = John Calvin taught that since Jesus Christ fulfilled the Sabbath, binding observance to the Sabbath was abrogated for Christians. However, he emphasized that because Christians are buried with Christ in baptism and raised from the dead to the glory of God the Father (Romans 6:4), that what Christ fulfilled in the Sabbath requires not one day each week, but rather \\"requires the whole course of our lives, until being completely dead to ourselves, we are filled with the life of God.\\"John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Two, Chapter 8, Section 31 Calvin taught that spiritual wisdom deserves to have some part of every day devoted to it, but owing to the weakness of many daily meetings cannot be held. Consequently, the pattern of weekly observance established by God is useful for the church to emulate. This church practice is not to be in the manner of Jewish observance of minute formalities, but rather one of ordering church life in a useful and predictable manner to serve the body with opportunity to hear the word, receive the sacraments, and participate in public prayer.John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Two, Chapter 8, Section 33-34 The Westminster Confession of Faith describes the Sabbath day as being the seventh day of the week from the creation until the resurrection of Christ, and as being changed to the first day of the week with Christ's resurrection. = Methodist views = In Methodism, an \\"important aspect of the pursuit of sanctification is the careful following\\" of the Ten Commandments. The General Rules of the Methodist Church required \\"attending upon all the ordinances of God\\" including \\"the public worship of God\\" and prohibited \\"profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work therein or by buying or selling\\". As such, \\"Methodist observance of the Lord's Day was grounded in their sense that the observance of Sunday as a day of rest fulfilled the Commandement to sanctify the Sabbath.\\" The 2014 Discipline of the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches states, with regard to the Lord's Day: Theologically speaking, for Methodists, Sunday is \\"the special but not the only day for worship, it is hallowed by God, recalls creation and the resurrection, requires release from earthly toil and responsibilities, and anticipates the eschatological day of the Lord that is the hope and desire of all believers.\\" = Latter-day Saints views = Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe the Lord has commanded them to continue to observe the Sabbath. He has promised them that if they obey this commandment, they will receive \\"the fullness of the earth.\\". Members are taught that they should keep it a holy day and it should be reserved for holy activities. Latter-day Saints attend sacrament meeting each week, which includes the ordinance of partaking of bread and water in remembrance of the Lord Jesus Christ as He instructed his apostles to do at the Last Supper. Other Sabbath- day activities may include: praying, meditating, studying the scriptures and the teachings of latter-day prophets, reading wholesome material, spending time with family, visiting the sick and distressed, and attending other Church meetings.True to the Faith, Pg 146 (PDF) = Seventh-day Adventists = Seventh-day Adventists observe the sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset. In places where the sun does not appear or does not set for several months, such as northern Scandinavia, the tendency is to regard an arbitrary time such as 6 p.m. as \\"sunset\\". During the sabbath, Adventists avoid secular work and business, although medical relief and humanitarian work is accepted. Though there are cultural variations, most Adventists also avoid activities such as shopping, sport, and certain forms of entertainment. Adventists typically gather for church services on Saturday morning. Some also gather on Friday evening to welcome in the sabbath hours (sometimes called \\"vespers\\" or \\"opening Sabbath\\"), and some similarly gather at \\"closing Sabbath\\". Traditionally, Seventh-day Adventists hold that the Ten Commandments (including the fourth commandment concerning the sabbath) are part of the moral law of God, not abrogated by the teachings of Jesus Christ, which apply equally to Christians. Adventists have traditionally distinguished between \\"moral law\\" and \\"ceremonial law\\", arguing that moral law continues to bind Christians, while events predicted by the ceremonial law were fulfilled by Christ's death on the cross.

It is a prohibition of blasphemy, specifically, the misuse or \\"taking in vain\\" of the name of the God of Israel, or using His name to commit evil, or to pretend to serve in His name while failing to do so. Exodus 20:7 reads: Based on this commandment, Second Temple Judaism by the Hellenistic period developed a taboo of pronouncing the name of God at all, resulting in the replacement of the Tetragrammaton by \\"Adonai\\" (literally \\"my lords\\" ‚Äì see Adonai) in pronunciation. In the Hebrew Bible itself, the commandment is directed against abuse of the name of God, not against any use; there are numerous examples in the Hebrew Bible and a few in the New Testament where God's name is called upon in oaths to tell the truth or to support the truth of the statement being sworn to, and the books of Daniel and Revelation include instances where an angel sent by God invokes the name of God to support the truth of apocalyptic revelations.Oath, in The Zondervan Topical Bible, Viening, E., ed., Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, 1978, , pp. 719‚Äì720 God himself is presented as swearing by his own name (\\"As surely as I live ‚Ä¶\\") to guarantee the certainty of various events foretold through the prophets.Live, in Carpenter, E.E. and Comfort, P.W., Holman Treasury of Key Bible Words: 200 Greek and 200 Hebrew words defined and explained, Broadman & Holman Publishers, 2000, , p. 117; Bruce, F.F., The Epistle to the Hebrews, The New International Commentary on the New Testament, Wm. B. Eardman's Publishing Company, 1990, , p. 154 In Judaism =Hebrew Bible= The Hebrew is translated as \\"thou shalt not take in vain\\". The word here translated as \\"in vain\\" is ( 'emptiness', 'vanity', 'emptiness of speech', 'lying'), while 'take' is 'to lift', 'carry', 'bear', 'take', 'take away' (appearing in the second person as ). The expression \\"to take in vain\\" is also translated less literally as \\"to misuse\\" or variants. Some have interpreted the commandment to be against perjury,Ten Commandments, Illustrated Dictionary & Concordance of the Bible, Wigoder, G., general editor, et al., G.G. The Jerusalem Publishing House, Ltd., , p.980 since invoking God's name in an oath was considered a guarantee of the truth of a statement or promise. Other scholars believe the original intent was to prohibit using the name in the magical practice of conjuration.Ten Commandments, HarperCollins Bible Dictionary, 1996, Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York:HarperCollins Publishers, , p.1109; Names of God in the OT: Attenuation of the Divine Name, in The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Freedman, D.N., editor-in-chief, New York: Doubleday, 1992, , p. 1010 Hebrew Bible passages also refer to God's name being profaned by hypocritical behavior of people and false representation of God's words or character.See for examples Leviticus 18:21, 20:3, 21:6; Isaiah 48:1‚Äì2; Jeremiah 5:1‚Äì2, 7:9‚Äì15; Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible, Vol. 1 Commentary on Exodus 20:7 Many scholars also believe the commandment applies to the casual use of God's name in interjections and curses (blasphemy). The object of the command \\"thou shalt not take in vain\\" is this-same name of YHWH, thy elohim', making explicit that the commandment is against the misuse of the proper name Yahweh specifically. In the Hebrew Bible, as well as in the Ancient Near East and throughout classical antiquity more generally, an oath is a conditional self-curse invoking deities that are asked to inflict punishment on the oath-breaker. There are numerous examples in the Book of Samuel of people strengthening their statements or promises with the phrase, \\"As surely as Yahweh lives ...\\" See, for examples, 1 Samuel 14:39, 45, 17:55, 20:3, 20:21, 25:26, 25:34, 26:10, 26:16, etc. and such statements are referred to in Jeremiah as well. The value of invoking punishment from God was based on the belief that God cannot be deceived or evaded. For example, a narrative in the Book of Numbers describes how such an oath is to be administered by a priest to a woman suspected of adultery, with the expectation that the accompanying curse will have no effect on an innocent person.Numbers 5:19‚Äì24; Isaacs RH, Every Person's Guide to Jewish Sexuality, Jason Aronson Publishers, 2000. , pp.74‚Äì75 Such oaths may have been used in civil claims, regarding supposed theft, for example, and the commandment is repeated in the context of honest dealings between people in Leviticus 19:12. At one point of the account of the dedication of the Temple of Solomon, Solomon prays to Yahweh, asking him to hear and act upon curses uttered in a dispute that are then brought before his altar, to distinguish between the person in the right and the one in the wrong.First Kings 8:31‚Äì32; Hooker, Paul, First and Second Chronicles, Westminster John Knox Press, 2001, , p. 138, 143 The prophet Isaiah rebuked Israel as the Babylonian Captivity drew near, pointing out that they bore the name of God, and swore by him, but their swearing was hypocritical since they had forsaken the exclusive worship of Yahweh for the worship of idols.Isaiah 48:1‚Äì2; Isaiah 40‚Äì66, InterVarsity Press,2007, , p. 99 The Israelites had been told in Leviticus that sacrificing their children to idols and then coming to worship God caused God's name to be profaned, thus breaking the commandment.Leviticus 18:21, 20:3, 21:6;Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible, Vol. 1 Commentaries on Leviticus 18:21, 20:3 and 21:6 According to the Book of Jeremiah, Yahweh told him to look around Jerusalem, asserting that he would not be able to find an honest man ‚Äì \\"Even when they say, As Yahweh lives,' they are sure to be swearing falsely.\\"Jeremiah 5:1‚Äì2; Calvin, J, McGrath A, and Packer, J.I., Crossway Classic Commentaries: Jeremiah and Lamentations, Good News Publishers,2000 , p. 43 Jeremiah refers to a situation in which Israelites repented and took oaths in God's name ‚Äì only to renege by reclaiming as slaves persons they had freed as part of their repentance. This hypocritical act was also considered profaning God's name.Jeremiah 34:16; Pixley, J., Jeremiah, Chalice Press, 2004, , pp. 109‚Äì110 In Jeremiah 12, an opportunity is also described for Israel's neighbors to avoid destruction and prosper if they stop swearing by their idol and swear only by the name of Yahweh.Jeremiah 12:16‚Äì17; McKane, W., A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Jeremiah: Introduction, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1986, , p. 279 = In practice = To avoid coming under guilt by accidentally misusing God's name, Jewish scholars do not write or pronounce the proper name in most circumstances, but use substitutes such as \\"Adonai (the Lord),\\" or \\"HaShem (the Name).\\"Lamm, Norman, The Shema: Spirituality and law in Judaism, Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 2000, , pp. 23‚Äì26 In English translations of the Bible, the name Adonai is often translated \\"Lord,\\" while the proper name Yahweh represented by the tetragrammaton is often indicated by the use of capital and small capital letters, L·¥è Ä·¥Ö.The Episcopal Church, The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments ‚Ä¶, New York: Church Publishing Inc., , p.583; Barker, Kenneth, The Accuracy of the NIV, Baker Books, 1996, , p. 21 Rabbi Joseph Telushkin wrote that the commandment is much more than a prohibition against casual interjections using God's name. He pointed out that the more literal translation of Lo tissa is \\"you shall not carry\\" rather than \\"you shall not take\\", and that understanding this helps one understand why the commandment ranks with such as \\"You shall not murder\\" and \\"You shall not commit adultery\\". One of the first commandments listed by Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah is the responsibility to sanctify God's name.The Kaddish Prayer: A new translation with a commentary anthologized from Talmudic, Midrashic and Rabbinic sources. New York: Mesorah Publications, Ltd., 2001, , p.8 Maimonides thought the commandment should be taken as generally as possible, and therefore he considered it forbidden to mention God's name unnecessarily at any time. Jewish scholars referred to this as \\"motzi shem shamayim lavatalah\\", \\"uttering the Name of Heaven uselessly.\\"Terumah 3b To avoid guilt associated with accidentally breaking the commandment, Jewish scholars applied the prohibition to all seven biblical titles of God in addition to the proper name, and established the safeguard of circumlocution when referring to the Name of God.Hoffman, L.A., My people's prayer book: traditional prayers, modern commentaries, Vol. 1: The Sh'ma and its blessings, Jewish Lights Publishing, 1997, p. 36 In writing names of God, a common practice includes substituting letters or syllables so that the written word is not exactly the name, or writing the name in an abbreviated manner. Orthodox Jews will not even pronounce a name of God unless it is said in prayer or religious study. The Sacred Name (Tetragrammaton), is never pronounced by these Jews but always read as \\"Adonai (the Lord),\\" \\"HaShem (the Name),\\" or sometimes \\"AdoShem\\".Lamm, Norman, The Shema: Spirituality and law in Judaism, Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 2000, , p. 23 The Kaddish is an important prayer in a Jewish prayer service whose central theme is the magnification and sanctification of God's name.Donin, Hayim Halevy, To pray as a Jew: a guide to the prayer book and the synagogue service, Jerusalem: Moreshet Publishing Co.,1980, , p. 216 Along with the Shema and Amidah, it is one of the most important and central prayers of Jewish liturgy. In Christianity = In the New Testament = In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught that a person's word should be reliable and one should not swear by God or his creation.Matthew 5:33‚Äì37; In his letter, the Apostle James reiterates the instruction to just say 'yes' or 'no' and keep your word, \\"so that you may not fall into condemnation.\\"James 5:12 According to a volume of commentary published by the David C. Cook publishing company, appeals to authorities to validate the truth of a promise had expanded in Jesus' day, which was not in line with the original commandment.Hale, T., Thorson, S., Applied New Testament Commentary, Colorado Springs: David C. Cook, , p. 200 Jesus is quoted as warning that they were blind and foolish who gave credibility to such arguments.Matthew 23:18‚Äì22; Long, T.G., Matthew, Westminster John Knox Press, 1997, , p. 261 According to the Gospel of John, Jesus made appeals to the power of the name of GodKruse, C., The Gospel According to John: an introduction and commentary, Wm B. Eerdman's Publishing, 2004, , p. 342 and also claimed the name of God as his own [cite source], which constituted blasphemy if it were not true. The Gospel of John relates an incident where a group attempts to stone Jesus after he speaks God's name.John 8:57‚Äì59; Stott, J., Warren, R., Basic Christianity, Wm. B. Eerdman's Publishing Co., 2008, , p. 37 Jesus says that he is the Messiah, and makes parallels between himself and the \\"Son of Man\\" referred to by the prophet Daniel, which evokes an emphatic response that he has blasphemed (broken the commandment) and deserves death.Matthew 26:63‚Äì66;Levy, L.W., Blasphemy: verbal offense against the sacred, from Moses to Salman Rushdie, UNC Press, 1995, , p. 18 The Apostle Paul occasionally invokes God's name in his letters, calling God as witness to the purity of his motives and honesty of his dealings with the churches to whom he ministered.2 Corinthians 1:23; Galatians 1:20; Best, W.M., Russell, J.A., Morgan A., The Principles of the Law of Evidence: rules for conducting examination and cross-examination of witnesses, Jersey City: Federick D.

B. Eerdman's Publishing, 1990, , pp. 153‚Äì154 Similar to the events described in the Book of Daniel, the Book of Revelation includes a description of an angel who swears by God to the truth of the end-time events being revealed to John.Revelation 10:5,6; Smith, Robert H., Apocalypse: A commentary on Revelation in words and images, Order of St. Benedict, Inc., 2000, , p. 54 = In the Catholic Church = The Catholic Church teaches that the Lord's name is holy and should be introduced into one's speech only to bless, praise or glorify that name.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2143 The name should be used respectfully, with an awareness of the presence of God.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2144‚Äì2145, 2153 It must not be abused by careless speech, false oaths, or words of hatred, reproach or defiance toward God, or used in magic.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2148‚Äì2149 Since Jesus Christ is believed to be the Messiah, and \\"the image of the invisible God,\\"Luke 15:11‚Äì32; Catechism of the Catholic Church 1701 this commandment is applied to the name of Jesus Christ as well. The sentiment behind this commandment is expressed in the Lord's Prayer, which begins, \\"Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\\" According to Pope Benedict XVI, when God revealed his name to Moses he established a relationship with mankind; Benedict stated that the Incarnation was the culmination of a process that \\"had begun with the giving of the divine name.\\"Benedict XVI, pp. 143‚Äì145 Benedict elaborated that this means the divine name could be misused and that Jesus' inclusion of \\"hallowed be thy name\\" is a plea for the sanctification of God's name, to \\"protect the wonderful mystery of his accessibility to us, and constantly assert his true identity as opposed to our distortion of it.\\" Taking an oath or swearing is to take God as witness to what one affirms. It is to invoke the divine truthfulness as a pledge of one's own truthfulness.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2150 For the same reason, the Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that it is a duty to reject false oaths that others might try to impose; an oath may be made false because it attests to a lie, because an illegitimate authority is requiring it, or because the purpose of the oath is contrary to God's law or human dignity.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2151‚Äì2153 = In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints = Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe in this commandment as written in Exodus 20. This commandment has been repeated in the LDS Scriptures such as the Book of Mormon and in Doctrine and Covenants. Former prophet and president of the Church, Spencer W. Kimball told the following story to inspire believers: President Kimball underwent surgery many years ago, he was wheeled from the operating room to the intensive care room. The attendant who pushed the gurney which carried him stumbled and let out an oath using the name of the Lord. President Kimball, who was barely conscious, said weakly, \\"Please! Please! That is my Lord whose names you revile.\\" There was a deathly silence; then the young man whispered with a subdued voice, \\"I am sorry.\\" The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 198 = Reformation and post- Reformation doctrines = Matthew Henry described five categories of actions that constitute taking God's name in vain: 1) hypocrisy ‚Äì making a profession of God's name, but not living up to that profession; 2) covenant breaking ‚Äì if one makes promises to God yet does not carry out the promised actions; 3) rash swearing; 4) false swearing; and 5) using the name of God lightly and carelessly, for charms or spells, jest or sport. He pointed out that though a person may hold himself guiltless in one of these matters, the commandment specifically states that God will not.Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible, Vol. 1 Commentary on Exodus 20:7 The Lutheran Witness, a doctrinal document representing the Lutheran faith, supports the view that oaths should not generally be taken at all, except \\"for the glory of God and the welfare of our neighbor.\\" Specifically, it states that proper use of God's name includes administration of oaths in court, and in swearing-in a spiritual or political leader to their respective offices, which include responsibilities toward God and fellow human beings.The Lutheran witness, Volume 11, General English Lutheran Conference of Missouri and Other States, English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri and Other States, Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and Other States, Lutheran Church‚ÄîMissouri Synod, Edited and published under the auspices of the Cleveland District Conference by C.A. Frank, 1892, p. 181 In his Institutes of the Christian Religion, John Calvin sets the stage for discussing this commandment by noting that an oath is calling God to witness that what we say is true, and that an appropriate oath is a kind of worship of God in that it implies a profession of faith. When human testimony fails, people appeal to God as witness, as the only one able to bring hidden things to light and know what is in the heart. False swearing robs God of his truth (to the observer), and therefore it is a serious matter. With regard to the casual use of God's name, Calvin summarized, \\"remember that an oath is not appointed or allowed for passion or pleasure, but for necessity.\\" He wrote that the frequency of casual use of the name of God has dulled the public conscience but that the commandment, with its penalty, still stands.Calvin, John, (Beveridge, Henry), Institutes of the Christian Religion, Hendrickson Publishers, 2008, , pp. 246‚Äì248 Winwood Reade's doctrine Historian Winwood Reade has a different interpretation of the third commandment: \\"Invention of the Oath: But the chief benefit which religion ever conferred upon mankind, whether in ancient or in modern times, was undoubtedly the oath. The priests taught that if a promise was made in the name of the gods, and that promise was broken, the gods would kill those who took their name in vain. Such is the true meaning of the third commandment. Before that time treaties of peace and contracts of every kind in which mutual confidence was required could only be effected by the interchange of hostages. But now by means of this purely theological device a verbal form became itself a sacred pledge: men could at all times confide in one another; and foreign tribes met freely together beneath the shelter of this useful superstition which yet survives in our courts of law.\\"Winwood Reade \\"The Matyrdom of Man\\", Trubner & Co, London 1872.

Sanh. 86a; Commentary on Exodus 20:13, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press (2004), p. 150 With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be rendered as \\"Thou shalt not kidnap\\". Kidnapping would then constitute a capital offence and thus merit its inclusion among the Ten Commandments. Nevertheless, this commandment has come to be interpreted, especially in non-Jewish traditions, as the unauthorized taking of private property (stealing or theft), which is a wrongful action already prohibited elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty. Ancient usage Significant voices of academic theologians (such as German Old Testament scholar A. Alt: Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog (1953)) suggest that commandment \\"you shall not steal\\" was originally intended against stealing people‚Äîagainst abductions and slavery, in agreement with the Talmudic interpretation of the statement as \\"you shall not kidnap\\" (Sanhedrin 86a). The Hebrew word translated ‚Äústeal‚Äù is ‚Äúgneva‚ÄùThe NIV Complete Concordance, Zondervan, 1981. The Hebrew Bible contains a number of prohibitions of stealing and descriptions of negative consequences for this sin. The Genesis narrative describes Rachel as having stolen household goods from her father Laban when she fled from Laban's household with her husband Jacob and their children.Genesis 31 Laban hotly pursued Jacob to recover his goods, and intended to do him harm, but Rachel hid the stolen items and avoided detection. Exodus 21:16 and Deuteronomy 24:7 apply the same Hebrew word to kidnapping (stealing a man) and demands the death penalty for such a sin. The Hebrew word translated ‚Äústeal‚Äù is more commonly applied to material possessions. Restitution may be demanded, but there is no judicial penalty of death. However, a thief may be killed if caught in the act of breaking in at night under circumstances where the occupants may reasonably be in fear of greater harm. The ancient Hebrew understanding honored private property rights and demanded restitution even in cases that might have been accidental, such as livestock grazing in another man's field or vineyard (Exodus 22:1-9 (ESV)). In the book of Leviticus, the prohibitions of robbing and stealing are repeated in the context of loving one's neighbor as oneself and the prohibition is expanded to include dealing falsely or fraudulently in matters of trade and negotiations. Wages owed to a hired worker are not to be withheld. Neighbors must not oppress or rob each other. Neighbors are to deal frankly with each other, protect the lives of each other, refrain from vengeance and grudges, and stand up for righteousness and justice in matters that go to court.Leviticus 19:9-17 The law obliged the thief to pay seven times (if the thief steals because he is hungry). If the thief wasn't able to pay compensation for his theft by selling his things, he was sold as a slave. If the thief confessed his sin, he was allowed to return the object, adding a fifth of its price and he brought to the priest as his compensation to the Lord a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering; and the priest made atonement for him before the Lord, and he was forgiven In Proverbs, the otherwise unknown Agur requests the lord not make him poor or rich fearing poverty or greed might tempt him to theft. In proverbs 9:16, the idea that stolen things are sweet and the bread (food) eaten in secret is pleasant is rebuked as foolish. Even to be partner to a thief is described as to hate one's own life ‚Äì to know of wrong doing but be unable to testify to it. Like wise in Romans, rulers such as those of Sodom and Gormorah who lust after bribes are described as detestable, corrupting their entire state. The book of Proverbs contrasts the response of a victim to a thief who steals to satisfy his hunger with the response of a jealous husband to adultery. The thief is not despised by his victim, even though the thief must make restitution even if it costs him all the goods of his house. In contrast, the jealous husband will accept no compensation and will repay the adulterer with wounds and dishonor, not sparing when his fury takes revenge.Proverbs 6:29-35 The book of Zechariah describes God as cursing the home of the thief and the home of those who swear falselyZechariah 5:1-4 and Jeremiah describes thieves as being shamed when they are caught.Jeremiah 2:26 Jewish doctrine Jewish law enumerates 613 Mitzvot or commandments, including prohibition of stealing and a number of other commandments related to the protection of private property and administration of justice in related cases. Maimonides (the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder. Maimonides‚Äô admonition to learn from the example of Ahab and Naboth refers to the narrative in 1 Kings 21 in which King Ahab of Israel tried to convince Naboth the Jezreelite to sell him the vineyard Naboth owned adjacent to the king's palace. Ahab wanted the land to use as a vegetable garden, but Naboth refused to sell or trade the property to Ahab saying, ‚ÄúThe forbid that I should give up to you what I have inherited from my fathers!‚Äù1 Kings 21:4 (JPS) Ahab's wife Jezebel then conspired to obtain the vineyard by writing letters in Ahab's name to the elders and nobles in Naboth's town instructing them to have two scoundrels bear false witness claiming that Naboth has cursed both God and the king. After Naboth was subsequently stoned to death, Ahab seized possession of Naboth's vineyard. The text describes the as very angry with Ahab, and the prophet Elijah pronounces judgment on both Ahab and Jezebel.1 Kings 21:20-23 New Testament doctrine The New Testament repeats the commandment not to steal,Matthew 19:18, Mark 10:19, Luke 18:20 contains dire warnings about spiritual consequences of the practice,1 Corinthians 6:10 and upholds the basic ideas of private property rights and the proper role of governmental authorities in punishing thieves.1 Peter 4:15, Romans 13 Thieves are exhorted to steal no longer, but to work hard with their own hands so that they might have something to share with people in need.Ephesians 4:28 Aquinas identifies five types of theft: by stealth, by violence, in withholding wages, fraud, and by buying positions of preferment.Aquinas, Thomas. \\"Explanation of the Ten Commandments\\" The hypocritical thief is personified by Judas, who took secretly his part from the money Jesus and the apostles raised for helping the poor; he objected when Mary ointed Jesus with pure nard, pretending hypocritically it would have been useful if the nard would have been sold and the money given to the poor. There were some Pharisees like Judas: they stole, although preaching not to steal. While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one's material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that \\"the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils\\" (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also: The book of 1 Corinthians asserts that thieves, swindlers, and the greedy will be excluded from the kingdom of God as sure as adulterers, idolaters, and the sexual immoral, but that those who leave these sins behind can be sanctified and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). The command against stealing is seen as a natural consequence of the command to ‚Äúlove your neighbor as yourself.‚Äù The prohibition against desiring forbidden things is also seen as a moral imperative for the individual to exercise control over the thoughts of his mind and the desires of his heart. Thomas Aquinas points out that just as \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" forbids one to injure his neighbor in his own person; and \\"Thou shalt not commit adultery\\" forbids injury to the person to whom one is bound in marriage; the Commandment, \\"Thou shalt not steal,\\" forbids one to injure his neighbor in his goods.Thomas Aquinas. Summa Theol., II-II, Q. cxxii, Art. 6] Roman Catholic doctrine Catholic teaching regards the commandment ‚ÄúYou shall not steal‚Äù as an expression of the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states : Catholic teaching states that in economic matters, respect for human dignity requires practicing temperance, a virtue that moderates attachment to worldly goods; justice, a virtue that preserves our neighbors rights and renders what is due; and solidarity, in accordance with the golden rule. Even if it does not contradict explicit provisions of civil law, any form of unjustly taking and keeping the property of others is against the seventh commandment: thus, deliberate retention of goods lent or of objects lost; business fraud; paying unjust wages; forcing up prices by taking advantage of the ignorance or hardship of another. The following are also considered morally illicit: speculation by which one contrives to manipulate the price of goods artificially in order to gain an advantage to the detriment of others; corruption in which one influences the judgment of those who must make decisions according to law; appropriation and use for private purposes of the common goods of an enterprise; work poorly done; tax evasion; forgery of checks and invoices; excessive expenses and waste. Willfully damaging private or public property is contrary to the moral law and requires reparation. In addition, Catholic teaching demands that contracts and promises be strictly observed. Injustices require restitution to the owner. Following Thomas Aquinas, Catholic teaching holds that \\"if the need be so manifest and urgent, that it is evident that the present need must be remedied by whatever means be at hand (for instance when a person is in some imminent danger, and there is no other possible remedy), then it is lawful for a man to succor his own need by means of another's property, by taking it either openly or secretly: nor is this properly speaking theft or robbery\\". Catholic teaching also supports the doctrine of occult compensation. Catholic teaching reminds that Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone, and bids them \\"renounce all that [they have]\\" for his sake and that of the Gospel.Luke 14:33 Jesus gave his disciples the example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who gave out of her poverty all that she had to live on.Luke 21:4 Detachment from riches is portrayed as obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of heaven. \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit\\"Matthew 5:3 represents the expectation that those who do not receive all their physical longings are more inclined to seek fulfillment of their spiritual longings through Jesus Christ. ‚ÄúThe Lord grieves over the rich, because they find their consolation in the abundance of goods.‚Äù \\"I want to see God\\" expresses the true desire of man. The water of eternal life quenches the thirst for God.John 14:14 Attachment to the goods of this world are a bondage. The Scriptural remedy is the desire for true happiness that is found in seeking and finding God. Holy people must struggle, with grace from on high, to obtain the good things God promises. Faithful Christians put to death their cravings and, with the grace of God, prevail over the seductions of pleasure and power.2548-2550 For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet lose his own soul?Mark 8:36 Reformation and post-reformation doctrines Martin Luther ascribes this commandment to God's desire to protect private property rights. He views this commandment as prohibiting not only the taking of another's property, but all unjust and fraudulent dealing in the marketplace, workplace, or any other place where transactions are conducted. Luther further describes negligence and dereliction of duty as violations of this commandment if such negligence causes one's employer to suffer loss. Likewise, laziness and unfaithfulness in one's paid employment are viewed as a fraud that is worse than the petty thefts that can be prevented with locks and bolts. Martin Luther taught that it is each person's duty, at the risk of God's displeasure, not only to do no injury to his neighbor, nor to deprive him of gain, nor to perpetrate any act of unfaithfulness or malice in any bargain or trade, but faithfully to preserve his property for him, to secure and promote his advantage, especially when one accepts money, wages, and one's livelihood for such service. Those who trespass this commandment may escape the hangman, but he shall not escape the wrath and punishment of God. Luther held that it must be impressed upon the young that they be careful not to follow the old lawless crowd, but keep their eyes fixed upon God's commandment, ‚Äúlest His wrath and punishment come upon them too.‚Äù John Calvin explains that since injustice is an abomination to God, the intent of the commandment against stealing is that one must render to every man his due. This commandment forbids us to long after other men's goods. Calvin holds that each individual's possessions have not fallen to him by chance, but by the distribution of the sovereign Lord of all. Therefore, no one can pervert his means to bad purposes without committing a fraud on a divine dispensation. Calvin asserts that God sees the long train of deception by which the man of craft begins to lay nets for his more simple neighbor. For Calvin, violations of this commandment are not confined to money, or merchandise, or lands, but extend to every kind of right. We defraud our neighbors to their hurt if we decline any of the duties which we are bound to perform towards them. God's wrath is incurred if an agent or an indolent steward wastes the substance of his employer, or does not give due heed to the management of his property; if he unjustly squanders or luxuriously wastes the means entrusted to him; if a servant holds his master in derision, divulges his secrets, or in any way is treacherous to his life or his goods. Likewise, a master incurs God's wrath if he cruelly torments his household, because he is guilty of theft before God; along will all who fail to deliver what he owes to others, keeps back, or makes away with what does not belong to him. Calvin further teaches that obedience requires us to be contented with our own lot. We should desire to acquire nothing but honest and lawful gain. We should not endeavor to grow rich by injustice, nor to plunder our neighbor of his goods, that our own may thereby be increased. We must not heap up wealth cruelly wrung from the blood of others. It should be our constant aim faithfully to lend our counsel and aid to all so as to assist them in retaining their property; or if we have to do with the perfidious or crafty, let us rather be prepared to yield somewhat of our right than to contend with them. Calvin further asserted that the individual Christian should contribute to the relief of those observed under the pressure of difficulties, assisting their want out of one's own abundance. Calvin describe the commandment against stealing as requiring the unwavering delivery of any and all obligations: Matthew Henry sees the prohibition on stealing as applying to the unjust taking, sinful spending, and sinful sparing. One must not take another's goods or encroach upon the boundaries of his property. One must restore what is lost. One must pay what is owed: debts, rents, wages, taxes, and tithes.

What constitutes adultery is not plainly defined in this passage of the Bible, and has been the subject of debate within Judaism and Christianity. Hebrew Bible =Pre-law examples= In Genesis 12, Abram's wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh‚Äôs palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts ‚Äúserious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.‚ÄùGenesis 12:17 (NIV) The Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram's wife and tells him, \\"What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.\\"Genesis 12:18-19 (ESV) In Genesis 20, Abraham (renamed after his encounter with El Shaddai (God Almighty) has moved to the Negev and again conceals his marriage to Sarah. A local king, Abimelech, intends to marry her, but God appears to Abimelech in a dream and says: \\"Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man‚Äôs wife.\\"Genesis 20:3 (ESV) Years later, Isaac tells the same lie regarding his wife, Rebecca, but Abimelech quickly discovers the truth. Appalled, he confronts Isaac, saying, \\"Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\\"Genesis 26:10 (ESV) In Genesis 39, a positive example is presented in Joseph, one of Jacob's twelve sons. He is sold into slavery in Egypt and quickly rises to a prominent and successful position managing the household of Potiphar, a military captain. He resists sexual advances from Potiphar's wife ‚Äúday after day,‚ÄùGenesis 39:10 (ESV) protesting that he does not wish to betray Potiphar's trust. One day her advances become physical, and in his effort to escape, Joseph leaves his cloak behind. Potiphar's wife uses this ‚Äòevidence‚Äô for a false accusation of rape against Joseph. Joseph is imprisoned, losing all but his life.Genesis 39:20 More than two years laterGenesis 40:1 and 41:1 he is restored to an even higher position, serving the Pharaoh himself. =After Mount Sinai= According to the Book of Exodus, the law forbidding adultery was codified for the Israelites at biblical Mount Sinai. It was one of the Ten Commandments written by the finger of God on stone tablets.Exodus 20:12, Deuteronomy 4:13 Details regarding the administration of the law and additional boundaries on sexual behavior followed. For example, the ordeal of the bitter water was established to prove the guilt or innocence of a wife whose husband suspected her of adultery.Numbers 5:11-31 Adultery was a capital crime,Leviticus 20:10 and if adulterers were caught, at least two witnesses were required before the death penalty would be carried out.Deuteronomy 17:6 Since men were permitted to have multiple wives, adultery was interpreted to consist of sexual relations between a man and a married or betrothed woman who was not his wife.Deuteronomy 22:22-23 A man who had sexual relations with a woman who was not married or betrothed was not guilty of adultery per se, but the man was then obligated to marry the woman and not divorce her until the end of his life.Deuteronomy 22:28-29, Other boundaries on sexual behavior included the prohibition of sexual relations between close relatives, between persons of the same sex, and between people and animals; prostitution was also forbidden.Leviticus 18:6-25, 19:29, 19:29, 20:11-20, 21:9 The prohibition of prostitution has been interpreted by rabbinical scholars to preclude sexual relations outside of marriage in general,Mitzvoh N355 in the order of Sefer Hamitzvos of RambamCCN133 in Chafetz Chaim's Concise Book of Mitzvot, 1990. New York: Feldheim Publishers and a woman who, after getting married, was found to have been promiscuous before marriage faced the death penalty.Deuteronomy 22:13-21 A woman who was raped was not guilty of breaking the law, provided she cried out for help (which was taken as proof that she did not consent).Deuteronomy 22:25-27 According to Deuteronomy, the commandment against adultery was reaffirmed as the leadership of Israel passed from Moses to Joshua.Deuteronomy 5:18 Thou shalt not commit adultery by Baron Henri de Triqueti (1803‚Äì74). 1837. Bronze bas-relief panel on the door of the Madeleine Place de La Madeleine, Paris King David's seduction of Uriah‚Äôs wife Bathsheba and the murderous cover-up of their adultery is an infamous transgression of this commandment. Occurring approximately four centuries after the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, the event and its aftermath are recounted in the books of Second Samuel and First Kings. Despite David‚Äôs sincere and lasting repentance,See Psalm 51, NIV Study Bible commentary on 2 Samuel 12:13 his breaking the commandment against adultery brought temporal punishment2 Samuel 12:10, 11, 14 and initiated a cascade of tragic events in the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah. The Book of Proverbs contains entire chapters warning against adultery and describing its temptations and consequences.Proverbs 5,7 and much of Proverbs 6 Direct warnings are given to stay far away from the adulteress.Proverbs 5:8 Wisdom is described as a protection against \\"the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words, who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed; none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.\\" Proverbs 2:16-19 (ESV) A modern Ketubah (traditional Jewish wedding document) =Spiritual parallels= The prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Hosea indicate that God viewed Israel's worship of idols as spiritual adultery.Jeremiah 3:6-9, 5:7, Ezekiel 16:38, 23:37, Hosea 1:2 This led to a broken covenant between them and ‚Äúdivorce,‚ÄùJeremiah 3:8 manifested as defeat by an enemy nation followed by exile, from which the northern kingdom never recovered. This spiritual adultery was apparently accompanied by the prevalence of physical adultery as well.Jeremiah 5:7, 23:14, 29:23, Hosea 4:13, 15 In Judaism A Jewish wedding in Vienna, Austria, 2007 The Mitzvoh against adultery is interpreted to refer to sexual relations between a man and a married woman. Sexual relations outside marriage are also prohibited based on Deuteronomy 23:18.see also Deuteronomy 22:13-21 The mitzvah are as follows: *Not to have intercourse with another man's wife.Leviticus 18:20Mitzvoh N347 in the order of Sefer Hamitzvos of RambamCCN124 in Chafetz Chaim's Concise Book of Mitzvot 1990 New York: Feldheim Publishers *There shall be no intercourse with a woman, without previous marriage with a deed of marriage and formal declaration of marriage.Deuteronomy 23:18CCN133 in Chafetz Chaim's Concise Book of Mitzvot 1990 New York: Feldheim Publishers In the Torah, if a husband suspected his wife of adultery, there was a prescribed ordeal she underwent to determine her guilt or innocence.Numbers 5:11-31, Isaacs RH, Every Person's Guide to Jewish Sexuality, Jason Aronson Publishers, 2000. , pp.74-75. A separate procedure was to be followed if a newlywed husband became suspicious that his wife had been promiscuous before marriage. Alternatively, to enforce capital punishment for adultery, at least two witnesses were required, and both the man and woman involved were subject to punishment.Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 17:6; Every Person's Guide to Jewish Sexuality pp. 75-76. While cases of adultery could thus be difficult to prove, divorce laws added over the years enabled a husband to divorce his wife on circumstantial evidence of adultery without witnesses or additional evidence.The Jewish Encyclopedia article on adultery If a woman committed unlawful intercourse against her will, she was not guilty of adultery, because she did not act as a free agent. Punishment was not inflicted in such cases, and the legal consequences of adultery did not follow. In the first century, enforcement of the ordeal became less common as additional restrictions were put on prosecution of capital cases of adultery. In the year 40, before the destruction of the Second Temple,Sanhedrin 41a the Jewish courts relinquished their right to inflict capital punishment (perhaps under Roman pressure). Changes in punishment for adultery were enacted: the adulterer was scourged, and the husband of the adulteress was not allowed to forgive her crime,So·π≠ah 6:1 but was compelled to divorce her, and she lost all her property rights under her marriage contract.Maimonides, \\"Yad ha-·∏§aza·∏≥ah, Ishut,\\" 24:6 The adulteress was not allowed to marry the one with whom she had committed adultery;So·π≠ah 5:1 if she did, they were forced to separate.See also The Jewish Encyclopedia article on adultery Though legal enforcement was inconsistently applied, the mitzvah remained. Adultery is one of three sins (along with idolatry and murder) that are to be resisted to the point of death.Sanhedrin 74a This was the consensus of the rabbis at the meeting at Lydda, during the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132.Graetz, Heinrich. History of the Jews, 2002. Wipf & Stock Publishers, The mitzvoh to practice sexual relations only within marriage is affirmed by many Orthodox, Conservative and Reform rabbis into modern times.Every Person's Guide to Jewish Sexuality, pp.44-46. They point out that sexual relations outside of marriage undermine marriage and even love itself, and also emphasize the positive role of sexual relations in strengthening and promoting love within marriage. In the New Testament In the gospels, Jesus affirmed the commandment against adulteryMatthew 19:18, Mark 10:19 and seemed to extend it, saying, ‚ÄúBut I say to you, anyone who looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.‚ÄùMatthew 5:28 (NASB) He taught his audience that the outward act of adultery does not happen apart from sins of the heart: \\"From within people, from their hearts, come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly. All these evils come from within and they defile.‚Äù Mark 7:21-23 (NAB), see also Matthew 15:19-20 However, some commentators, including Thomas Aquinas, say that Jesus was making the connection with the commandment, ‚ÄúYou shall not covet your neighbor‚Äôs wife.‚ÄùExodus 20:17, Deuteronomy 5:21, St. Thomas Aquinas, Catena Aurea ‚Äì Gospel of Matthew, London: J.G.F. and J. Rivington. read online According to the gospels, Jesus quoted the book of Genesis regarding the divine origin of the marriage relationship, concluding, \\"So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, no man must separate.‚ÄùMatthew 19:6 (ESV) Jesus dismissed expedient provisions allowing for divorce for nearly any reason, and cited sexual immorality (a breaking of the marriage covenant) as the only reason why a person may divorce without committing adultery.Matthew 19:9, Mark 10:11,12, Luke 16:18 The Apostle Paul similarly taught (commonly called the Pauline privilege): In the gospel of John is an account of a woman caught in adultery. Leaders responsible for executing justice brought her to Jesus and asked for his judgment. Jesus clearly identified adultery with sin, however, his statement ‚ÄúLet he who is without sin cast the first stone,‚Äù did not refer to the precepts of law but to conscience.Pope John Paul II, \\"The Content of the Commandment: You Shall Not Commit Adultery\\", General Audience, August 13, 1980 Some commentators point out that if the woman was caught in adultery, there should also have been a man standing trial.Johnson BW. The New Testament Commentary, Vol. III- John, 1886. The Christian Board of Publication, St. Louis, MO. read online The law clearly stated that both parties were to receive the death penalty. By not bringing the guilty man to justice, these leaders shared in the guilt and were not fit to carry out the punishment. Not condoning her adultery, Jesus warns the woman in parting, ‚ÄúGo and sin no more‚ÄùJohn 8:11 (ESV) The Apostle Paul wrote frankly about the gravity of adultery: Within marriage, regular sexual relations are expected and encouraged. \\"The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.\\"1 Corinthians 7:3-4 (ESV) As ‚Äúone flesh,‚Äù the husband and wife share this right and privilege; the New Testament does not portray intimacy as something held in reserve by each spouse to be shared on condition. \\"Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control.\\"1 Corinthians 7:5 (NASB) A stated reason for maintaining marital relations is to reduce the temptation to adultery. The Apostle Paul himself never married and realized the practical advantages of remaining single.1 Corinthians 7:1,8,28,32-34 However, he referred to contentment in celibacy as ‚Äúa gift,‚Äù1 Corinthians 7:7 and sexual desire as the more common condition of people. For this reason, he recommends that most people are better off married, in order to preclude being tempted beyond what they can bear or going through life ‚Äúburning with passion.‚Äù1 Corinthians 7:2,5,9 In Christianity In Egypt, Joseph resisted temptation to adultery at great personal cost. Image from the Vienna Bible, 1743 =Catholic Church= The modern Catechism of the Catholic Church begins its teaching on this commandment with a positive summary of God's creation of men and women and his purposes for sex within marriage. These purposes include unifying husband and wife,Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2335 demonstrating unselfish, even generous love between them, and producing children.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2335, 2360-2363, 2366 According to the Catechism, those who are engaged must refrain from sexual relations until after the marriage ceremony. This exercise of restraint in order to keep the commandment against adultery is also seen as important practice for fidelity within marriage: Chastity for the married Catholic is not abstention from sexual relations, but the enjoyment of God-given sexuality within marriage only.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2348-2349 The tradition of the Catholic Church has understood the commandment against adultery as encompassing the whole of human sexualityCatechism of the Catholic Church, 2336 and so pornographyCatechism of the Catholic Church, 2354 is declared a violation of this commandment. Several other sexual activities that may or may not involve married persons are also directly addressed and prohibited in the Catechism. Adultery is viewed not only as a sin between an individual and God but as an injustice that reverberates through society by harming its fundamental unit, the family:Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2207 =Reformation and post-Reformation commentary= John Calvin understood the commandment against adultery to extend to sexual relations outside of marriage: ‚ÄúAlthough one kind of impurity is alone referred to, it is sufficiently plain, from the principle laid down, that believers are generally exhorted to chastity; for, if the Law be a perfect rule of holy living, it would be more than absurd to give a license for fornication (sexual relations between persons not married to each other), adultery alone being excepted.‚Äù Matthew Henry understood the commandment against adultery to prohibit sexual immorality in general, and he acknowledged the difficulty people experience: ‚ÄúThis commandment forbids all acts of uncleanness, with all those fleshly lusts which produce those acts and war against the soul.‚ÄùMatthew Henry‚Äôs Commentary on the whole Bible, comments on Exodus 20:14 read online Henry supports his interpretation with Matthew 5:28, where Jesus warns that whoever looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Regarding the above passage, Matthew Henry comments: ‚ÄúHere you have, 1. A recommendation of God's ordinance of marriage, that it is honourable in all, ‚Ä¶ 2. A dreadful but just censure of impurity and lewdness.‚ÄùMatthew Henry‚Äôs Commentary on the Whole Bible, comments on Hebrews 13:4 read online John Wesley believed this scripture and the sure judgment of God, even though adulterers ‚Äúfrequently escape the sentence of men.‚ÄùJohn Wesley Commentary on the Whole Bible, comments on Hebrews 13:4 read online Martin Luther observed that there were many more people in his day who were unmarried for various reasons than in biblical times, which condition increased both temptation and sexual activities that are displeasing to God: Luther neither condemns nor denies human sexuality, but, like the Apostle Paul, points out that God instituted the marriage relationship to provide for its proper enjoyment. Luther comments that each spouse should intentionally cherish the other, and that this will contribute to love and a desire for chastity, which will make fidelity easier. The so-called \\"Wicked Bible\\", printed in 1631, omits the word \\"not\\", reading \\"Thou shalt commit adultery.\\" Historians are divided as to whether this was a typographical error or the attempt of a competitor to sabotage the print-run.Green, Emma. \\"Thou Shalt Commit Adultery\\", The Atlantic, October 23, 2015  Islam  The commandment to avoid adultery has been mentioned in Surat Al-Isra': The Messenger of Allah said that a person is a nonbeliever while he or she is perpetrating the sinful intercourse.

The image is from the altar screen of the Temple Church near the Law Courts in London. Thou shalt not kill (LXX; ), You shall not murder (Hebrew: ; ') or You shall not kill (KJV), is a moral imperative included as one of the Ten Commandments in the Torah (Exodus 20:13).Exodus 20:1‚Äì21, Deuteronomy 5:1‚Äì23, Ten Commandments, New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174‚Äì1175 The imperative not to kill is in the context of unlawful killing resulting in bloodguilt.Bloodguilt, Jewish Virtual Library, Genesis 4:10, Genesis 9:6, Genesis 42:22, Exodus 22:2-2, Leviticus 17:4, Leviticus 20, Numbers 20, Deuteronomy 19, Deuteronomy 32:43, Joshua 2:19, Judges 9:24, 1 Samuel 25, 2 Samuel 1, 2 Samuel 21, 1 Kings 2, 1 Kings 21:19, 2 Kings 24:4, Psalm 9:12, Psalm 51:14, Psalm 106:38, Proverbs 6:17, Isaiah 1:15, Isaiah 26:21, Jeremiah 22:17, Lamentations 4:13, Ezekiel 9:9, Ezekiel 36:18, Hosea 4:2, Joel 3:19, Habakkuk 2:8, Matthew 23:30‚Äì35, Matthew 27:4, Luke 11:50‚Äì51, Romans 3:15, Revelation 6:10, Revelation 18:24 Hebrew Bible = Retzach = The Hebrew verb (r-·π£-·∏•, also transliterated retzach, ratz√°kh, ratsakh etc.) is the word in the original text that is translated as \\"murder\\", but it has a wider range of meanings, generally describing destructive activity, including meanings \\"to break, to dash to pieces\\" as well as \\"to slay, kill, murder\\". According to the Book of Numbers, killing anyone outside the context of war with a weapon, or in unarmed combat, is considered retzach, but if the killing is accidental, the accused must flee to one of the cities of refuge‚Äîand remain in that city until the high priest dies, or the \\"revenger of blood\\" can kill the accused with no legal repercussions. The Bible never uses the word retzach in conjunction with war. The act of slaying itself, regardless of questions of bloodguilt, is expressed with the verb n-k-h \\"to strike, smite, hit, beat, slay, kill\\". This verb is used of both an Egyptian slaying an Israelite slave and of Moses slaying the Egyptian in retaliation in . The Covenant Code and Holiness Code both prescribe the death penalty for people that commit n-k-h. The commandment against murder can be viewed as a legal issue governing human relationships, noting that the first four commandments relate strongly to man's duty to God and that the latter six commandments describe duties toward humans.Hester, Joseph P., The Ten Commandments: a handbook of religious, legal, and social issues, MacFarland, 2003, pp. 19‚Äì20Commentary on Exodus 20, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 150 The commandment against murder can also be viewed as based in respect for God himself.The Ten Commandments, William Barclay, Westminster John Knox Press, 1998, p. 52The Ten Commandments, G. Cambell Morgan, Flaming H. Revell, 1901, pp. 66‚Äì67 \\"The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.\\" (ESV) The Genesis narrative also portrays the prohibition of shedding innocent blood as an important aspect of God's covenant with Noah.The Catholic Catechism 2260The Ten commandments: a handbook of religious, legal, and social issues, Joseph P. Hester, MacFarland, 2003, p. 21 The Torah portrays murder as a capital crime and describes a number of details in the moral understanding and legal implementation of consequences.Barclay, William. The Ten Commandments, Westminster John Knox Press, 1998, pp. 52‚Äì57 The Priestly Code allowed the victim's next of kin (avenger of blood) to exact retribution on the suspect; but the accused could seek sanctuary in a city of refuge. The right of the avenger of blood to such revenge ceased, upon the death of the person who was the Jewish High Priest at the time of the crime Another verb meaning \\"to kill, slay, murder, destroy, ruin\\" is h-r-g, used of Cain slaying Abel in Genesis 4:8. When Cain is driven into exile, complaining that \\"every one that findeth me shall slay me\\" in , he again uses this verb (h-r-g). Eliezer Segal observes that the Septuagint uses the term harag, and that Augustine of Hippo recognized that this did not extend to wars or capital punishment. Most subsequent translations follow Jerome's Vulgate. While Jerome had access to Jewish scholars, \\"even the Jewish translators were not unanimous in maintaining a consistent distinctions between the various Hebrew roots.\\" Jerome's choice of the word occidere (to kill) reflects the broader range of meanings. In a more modern analysis, Wilma Ann Bailey also finds a broader application of the word retzach. =Justified killing: due consequence for crime= The Torah and Hebrew Bible made clear distinctions between the shedding of innocent blood versus killing as the due consequence of a crime. A number of sins were considered to be worthy of the death penalty including murder,Exodus 21:12, Leviticus 24:17 incest,Leviticus 20:12 bearing false witness on a capital charge,Deuteronomy 19:8‚Äì21 adultery,Leviticus 20:10 idolatry,Exodus 22:20 bestiality,Leviticus 20:15 child sacrifice to pagan gods,Leviticus 20:2 cursing a parent,Leviticus 20:9 fortune-telling,Leviticus 20:27 homosexualityLeviticus 20:13, and other sins. For example, the Exodus narrative describes the people as having turned to idolatry with the golden calf while Moses was on the mountain receiving the law from God. When Moses came down, he commanded the Levites to take up the sword against their brothers and companions and neighbors. The Levites obeyed and killed about three thousand men who had sinned in worship of the golden calf. As a result, Moses said that the Levites had received a blessing that day at the cost of son and brother. On a separate occasion, a blasphemer was stoned to death because he blasphemed the name of the Lord (Yahweh) with a curse. The Hebrew Bible has many other examples of sinners being put to death as due consequence for crimes. Achan is put to death by Joshua because he caused defeat of Israel's army by taking some of the plunder and hiding it in his tent.‚Äô'The Ten Commandments,‚Äô‚Äô G. Cambell Morgan, Flaming H. Revell, 1901, p. 69 David ordered that an Amalekite be put to death because he claimed to have killed King Saul. Following the advice of his father, Solomon ordered that Joab be killed: The biblical refrain for those justly executed as due punishment for crimes is that \\"their blood will be on their own heads.\\"Leviticus 20, 2 Samuel 1:16, Ezekiel 18:13, This expresses the idea that those guilty of certain actions have brought the shedding of blood upon themselves, and those carrying out due punishment do not bear bloodguilt. =Justified killing: in warfare= The ancient Hebrew texts make a distinction between the moral and legal prohibition of shedding of innocent blood and killing in battle.The Catholic Catechism 2261 Rabbi Marc Gellman explains the distinction between \\"harag\\" (killing) and \\"ratzah\\" (murder) and notes the different moral connotations: \\"there is wide moral agreement (not complete agreement) that some forms of killing are morally just, and killing an enemy combatant during wartime is one of them.\\" For example, the Torah prohibits murder, but sanctions killing in legitimate battle.Matthew Henry‚Äôs Commentary on Exodus 20:13, Exodus 34:10‚Äì14, Deuteronomy 7:7‚Äì26 Later generations have given great consideration to the question of what constitutes \\"legitimate battle.\\" The Bible often praises the exploits of soldiers against enemies in legitimate battle. One of David's mighty men is credited with killing eight hundred men with the spear,2 Samuel 23:8 and Abishai is credited with killing three hundred men.2 Samuel 23:18 The 613 Mitzvot extend the notion of lawful killing to the nations that inhabited the Promised Land, commanding to exterminate them completely. Deuteronomy 20:10‚Äì18 establishes rules on killing civilians in warfare: *the population of cities outside of the Promised Land, if they surrender, should be made tributaries and left alive (20:10‚Äì11) *those cities outside of the Promised Land that resist should be besieged, and once they fall, the male population should be exterminated, but the women and children should be left alive (20:12‚Äì15) *of those cities that were within the Promised Land, however, everybody was to be killed. =Justified killing: intruder in the home= As described in the Torah, the ancient understanding of the prohibition of murder made an exception for legitimate self-defense. A home defender who struck and killed a thief caught in the act of breaking in at night was not guilty of bloodshed. \\"If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed; but if it happens after sunrise, he is guilty of bloodshed.\\"Exodus 22:2‚Äì3 Jewish doctrine Jewish law views the shedding of innocent blood very seriously, and lists murder as one of three sins (along with idolatry and sexual immorality) that fall under the category of yehareg ve'al ya'avor, meaning \\"One should let himself be killed rather than violate it.\\"Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 74a, http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_74.html Jewish law enumerates 613 Mitzvot, or commandments, including prohibition of murder and a number of other commandments related to the preserving of human life and administration of justice in cases of shedding of innocent blood. Life is considered very precious, even sacred by Jewish teaching. The Talmud cites the prohibition of shedding innocent blood in Genesis 9:6 as the reason why the death penalty should be carried out against non-Jews as well as Jews, and while faithful Jews are required to obey 613 Mitzvot, gentiles are only obliged to obey the seven Noahide laws, which include the prohibition of murder and establishment of a justice system to administer law honestly.Tractate Sanhedrin 57a, http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_57.html Rabbi Dr. Azriel Rosenfeld offers a representative modern summary of Jewish teaching regarding the command not to murder. In the Talmud, Genesis 9:5 is interpreted as a prohibition against killing oneself, and Genesis 9:6 is \\"cited in support for the prohibition of abortion.\\"Commentary on Genesis 9, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 25, Talmud b.B.K 91b, b Sanhedrin 57b According to the Mishnah (older part of the Talmud), it is said of Hillel the Elder that he saw a skull that was floating on top of the water and he said (to it): \\"Since you drowned [others, others] drowned you. And in the end, those that drowned you will be drowned.\\"Pirkei Avot 2:6, Babylonian Talmud In: www.sefaria.org, retrieved 2 September 2018 From Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva it is stated in the Mishnah: \\"If we were on the Sanhedrin, nobody would have ever been executed.\\"Makkot 1:10 In: www.sefaria.org, retrieved 2 September 2018 According to conservative rabbi Louis Ginzberg, every slain man who, because of murdering, died before their time shall stay in outer part of Sheol until the course of the time predestined them is run. New Testament doctrine The New Testament is in agreement that murder is a grave moral evil,Matthew 5:21, Matthew 15:19, Matthew 19:19, Matthew 22:7, Mark 10:19, Luke 18:20, Romans 13:9, 1 Timothy 1:9, James 2:11, Revelation 21:8 and maintains the Old Testament view of bloodguilt.Matthew 23:30‚Äì35, Matthew 27:4, Luke 11:50‚Äì51, Romans 3:15, Revelation 6:10, Revelation 18:24 Jesus himself repeats and expands upon the commandment, \\"Do not murder.\\"Matthew 5:21, Matthew 19:19, Mark 10:19, Luke 18:20 The New Testament depicts Jesus as explaining that murder, as well as other sins, comes from the heart. The New Testament acknowledges the just and proper role of civil government in maintaining justiceRomans 13:1‚Äì7, 1 Peter 4:15, John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book 4, Chapter 20, http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book4/bk4ch20.html and punishing evildoers, even to the point of \\"bearing the sword.\\"Romans 13:4 and commentary, The NIV Study Bible, Zondervan, 1995 p. 2240 One criminal on the cross contrasts his death as due punishment with Jesus' death as an innocent man.Luke 23:41 When Jesus appeared before Pilate, both PilateMatthew 27:24 and the crowdMatthew 27:25 recognize the principles of bloodguilt. There is no indication in the New Testament that it is unjust, immoral, or inappropriate for secular civil governments to execute those guilty of shedding innocent blood.Matthew 22:7, Romans 13, John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book 4, Chapter 20, Catechism of the Catholic Church 2267 Like the Old Testament, the New Testament seems to depict the lawful use of force by soldiers in legitimate battles as justified.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2309‚Äì2310 The profession of soldier is used as a metaphor by Paul exhorting the Ephesians to \\"put on the full armor of God.\\"Ephesians 6 Cornelius, the Roman centurion, is portrayed as a righteous and God-fearing man.Acts 10, An Exposition of the Bible, Volume 5, Marcus Dods, et al., S.S.

Scranton Co., 1903, p. 429 When John the Baptist was preaching repentance and baptizing penitent sinners in the Jordan river, soldiers came to John and asked for specific instructions regarding their repentance. John the Baptist did not demand that the soldiers renounce their profession, instead he exhorted them to be content with their pay.An Exposition of the Bible, Volume 5, Marcus Dods, et al., S.S. Scranton Co., 1903, p. 429 Jesus was not condoning violence as the very next verse confirms it was to satisfy the prophecy of Isaiah 53 when he told his disciples to buy a sword if they do not have one, \\"now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.\\"Luke 22:36‚Äì37 NIV Jesus was quick to correct his servant for the improper use of the sword in cutting off the ear of the high-priest's servant. In John 8:7 Jesus replied to the question of capital punishment because of adultery to let him who is without sin cast the first stone ‚Äì and no one did. Roman Catholic doctrine This commandment demands respect for human life and is more accurately translated as \\"thou shalt not murder.\\" Killing may, under limited circumstances, be justified within Catholicism. The basis of all Catholic teaching about the fifth commandment is the \\"sanctity of life\\", which is often contrasted with the \\"quality of life\\" to some extent. The Church is actively involved in the public debates over abortion, capital punishment and euthanasia, and encourages believers to support legislation and politicians it describes as pro-life. = Abortion = According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church: The Catechism states that abortion is a grave moral evil because the act takes an innocent human life: human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, \\"a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person ‚Äì among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2270 https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm = Capital punishment = Legitimate defense is depicted as justifiable, even if the defender deals his aggressor a lethal blow. However, a person should not use more force than necessary to repel an attack. The legitimate defense of persons and societies should not be considered as an exception to the prohibition of murdering the innocent: the preservation of innocent life is seen as the intended outcome. Injury or death to the aggressor is not the intended outcome, it is the unfortunate consequence of using necessary force to repel an imminent threat. Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others. The Catechism says: \\"The defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm. For this reason, those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility.\\" The Catechism teaches that legitimate public authority has the right and duty to punish criminals proportionally to the gravity of the offense to safeguard the public good. Nonlethal means are preferred, if these are sufficient to defend and protect people's safety. Recourse to the death penalty was not excluded in the past. In August 2018 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith with the approval of Pope Francis changed paragraph 2267 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church and declared that the death penalty is always regarded as inadmissible.Pope Francis changes Catholic teaching to oppose death penalty, saying capital punishment 'attacks' human dignity In: www.independent.co.uk, 2 August 2018Vatican changes Catechism teaching on death penalty, calls it ‚Äòinadmissible‚Äô In: www.catholicnewsagency.com, 2 August 2018 An Ohio prosecutor publicly declared that he disagrees with that,Prosecutor disagrees with Pope Francis‚Äôs death penalty ruling In: cruxnow.com, 5 August 2018 while Catholic US scholars drafted an appeal against the change and declared it \\"scandalous\\".An Appeal to the Cardinals of the Catholic Church In: www.firstthings.com, 15 August 2018 :Recourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority, following a fair trial, was long considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good. :Today, however, there is an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes. In addition, a new understanding has emerged of the significance of penal sanctions imposed by the state. Lastly, more effective systems of detention have been developed, which ensure the due protection of citizens but, at the same time, do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption.NEW REVISION OF NUMBER 2267 vatican.va, retrieved 2 September 2018 In February 2016 Pope Francis called for the suspension of the death penalty for the duration of the Holy Year \\"because modern means existed to 'efficiently repress crime without definitively denying the person who committed it the possibility of rehabilitating themselves.\\" = Suicide, euthanasia, health, intoxication = Catholic teaching strictly prohibits euthanasia and suicide as violations of the commandment, \\"You shall not kill.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2276‚Äì2283 https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm Recognizing life and health as precious gifts from God, adherents are encouraged to avoid excess of food, tobacco, alcohol, and medications. Endangering others with excesses speed or drunkenness on the roadway incurs grave guilt.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2288‚Äì2290 https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm The use of drugs, except on strictly therapeutic grounds is a grave offense. Clandestine production and trafficking in drugs constitute \\"direct co-operation in evil.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2291 https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm = War and self-defense = The Catholic Catechism urges prayer for the avoidance of war. All citizens and governments are obliged to work toward the avoidance of war. However, it recognizes that governments cannot be denied the lawful right to self-defense, once all peace efforts have failed. The use of legitimate defense by a military force is considered grave and therefore subject to rigorous considerations of moral legitimacy. Elements of just war theory are explicitly enumerated in the Catechism:Catechism of the Catholic Church 2307‚Äì2317 https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P81.HTM > *the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations > must be lasting, grave, and certain; *all other means of putting an end to > it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective; * there must be > serious prospects of success; *the use of arms must not produce evils and > disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. The power of modern means > of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition. Reformation and Post-Reformation doctrines =Lutheranism= Martin Luther summarized the commandment against shedding innocent blood as grounded in the fear and love of God, and as having both positive and negative aspects: negative in that we must neither harm nor hurt our neighbor's body; positive in that we must help our neighbor and care for him when he is ill. In a more detailed teaching, Martin Luther explains that God and government are not constrained by the commandment not to kill, but that God has delegated his authority in punishing evildoers to the government. The prohibition of killing is forbidden to the individual in his relation to anyone else, and not to the government. Today, the Lutheran Church of Australia recognises conscientious objection to war as Biblically legitimate. It has declared, \\"The church... accepts the validity of a person's refusal to engage in military service if he or she is convinced that participation in a military conflict amounts to the transgression of God's commandment 'You shall not kill'.\\" =Calvinism= In The Institutes of the Christian Religion, John Calvin viewed the purport of this commandment as the safety of all being entrusted to each person. All violence and injustice, and every kind of harm from which our neighbor's body suffers is thereby prohibited. Christians are therefore required to faithfully perform that which is within their power to defend the life of their neighbor, be vigilant in warding off harm, and assist in removing danger when it comes. Calvin asserts that the same rule must also be applied in regulating the mind against anger, arguing that since God sees the heart and mind, the commandment against shedding innocent blood also prohibits murder of the heart and requires a sincere desire to preserve our brother's life. The hand does not commit the murder unless it is conceived by the mind under the influence of wrath and hatred. According to Calvin, where wrath and hatred dwell, there is an inclination to do mischief, quoting the Bible, \\"whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer\\"(1 John 3:15) and \\"whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement\\" (Gospel of Matthew 5:22).John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Chapter 8, Part III, Section 39 http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html#thirtynin.htm John Calvin also makes a case that the command against shedding blood is founded both in the creation of man in the image of God and in the need for a man to cherish his own flesh. Matthew Henry considered the commandment against killing to apply to both one's own life as well as the life of one's neighbor and considered it to apply not only to causing of death but also to prohibit any thing unjustly hurtful to or injurious to the health, ease, and life of one's own body or the body of any other person.Matthew Henry‚Äôs Commentary on Exodus 20 :13 http://godstenlaws.com/ten-commandments/mh-commentary6.html He also ties the commandment against bloodshed back to the command to Noah, and he sees it as a command applying to the individual against his neighbor, but not against killing in lawful war, for one's own necessary defense, or against the government instituting due punishments for criminal offenses. He portrays lying in wait for the blood of the innocent as a grave offense against human dignity as one of the fundamental laws of nature. Many modern Calvinists, such as Andr√© Trocm√© and Jacques Ellul, have been pacifists. Today, the orthodox position of conservative Calvinists is Christian pacifism. =Anglicanism= Lambeth Conference 1930 Resolution 25 declares that, \\"The Conference affirms that war as a method of settling international disputes is incompatible with the teaching and example of our Lord Jesus Christ.\\" The 1948, 1958 and 1968 conferences re-ratified this position. The Anglican Pacifist Fellowship lobbies the various dioceses of the Anglican Communion to uphold this agreed position.

Rodman Williams, 1996 p.240; Making moral decisions: a Christian approach to personal and social ethics, Paul T. Jersild, 1991, p. 24 The Book of Exodus and the Book of Deuteronomy both describe the Ten Commandments as having been spoken by God, inscribed on two stone tablets by the finger of God, and, after Moses broke the original tablets, rewritten by God on replacements. In traditions that consider the passage a single commandment, the full text reads: Unlike the other commandments which focus on outward actions, this commandment focuses on thought. It is an imperative against setting one's desire on things that are forbidden. One commandment forbids the act of adultery. This commandment forbids the desire for adultery. One commandment forbids stealing. This commandment forbids the desire for acquisition of another's goods. The New Testament describes Jesus as interpreting the Ten Commandments as issues of the heart's desires rather than merely prohibiting certain outward actions. The Catechism of the Catholic Church connects the command against coveting with the command to \\"love your neighbor as yourself.\\"Leviticus 19:18, Romans 13:9, Catechism of the Catholic Church 2514-2533 Ibn Ezra on the question of \\"how can a person not covet a beautiful thing in his heart?\\" wrote that the main purpose of all the commandments is to straighten the heart.Sefer Ha-chinukh, Mitzva 416 Ancient usage The Hebrew word translated \\"covet\\" is chamad (◊ó◊û◊ì) which is commonly translated into English as \\"covet\\", \\"lust\\", and \\"strong desire.\\"The NIV Complete Concordance, Zondervan, 1981 The Hebrew Bible contains a number of warnings and examples of negative consequences for lusting or coveting. For example, when God was instructing Israel regarding the false religion of the Canaanites, he warned them not to covet the silver or gold on their idols, because this can lead to bringing detestable things into the home. The Book of Joshua contains a narrative in which Achan incurred the wrath of God by coveting prohibited gold and silver that he found in the destruction of Jericho. This is portrayed as a violation of covenant and a disgraceful thing.Joshua 7 The Book of Proverbs warns against coveting, \\"Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.\\"Proverbs 4:23 (NIV) The prophet Micah condemns the coveting of houses and fields as a warning against lusting after physical possessions.Micah 2:2 The Hebrew word for \\"covet\\" can also be translated as \\"lust\\", and the book of Proverbs warns against coveting in the form of sexual lust. Jewish views This commandment is directed against the sin of envy. Man is given the gift of human intelligence in order to be able to sift out the good from the bad, even in his/her own thoughts.Wollenburg, Mordechai. \\"Thought Control\\", Chabad.org Bava Batra teaches that a person can even harm his neighbor with his eyes. It asserts that damage caused by looking is also regarded as damage that is prohibited.The Tenth Commandment: \\"You Shall Not Covet\\" by Rav Elchanan Samet Even if the covetous desire is concealed in the heart, the covetous desire in itself is regarded by the Torah as damaging to the neighbor.Umberto Cassuto's Comments on Exodus 20:14, The Tenth Commandment: \\"You Shall Not Covet\\" by Rav Elchanan Samet Philo of Alexandria describes covetous desire as a kind of insurrection and plotting against others, because the passions of the soul are formidable. He regards desire as the worst kind of passion, but also one over which the individual exercises voluntary control. Therefore, near the conclusion of his discourse on the Decalogue, Philo exhorts the individual to make use of this commandment to cut off desire, the fountain of all iniquity.Philo, A Treatise Concerning the Ten Commandments XXII Left unchecked, covetous desire is the source of personal, interpersonal, and international strife: > \\"Is the love of money, or of women, or of glory, or of any one of the other > efficient causes of pleasure, the origin of slight and ordinary evils? Is it > not owing to this passion that relationships are broken asunder, and change > the good will which originates in nature into an irreconcilable enmity? And > are not great countries and populous kingdoms made desolate by domestic > seditions, through such causes? And are not earth and sea continually filled > with novel and terrible calamities by naval battles and military expeditions > for the same reason?\\"Philo, A Treatise Concerning the Ten Commandments > XXVIII The Book Exodus with the commentary of Abraham ibn Ezra, Naples 1488 Abraham ibn Ezra taught that a person can control his desires by training his heart to be content with what God has allotted to him. > \\"When he knows that God has forbidden his neighbor's wife to him, then she > is more elevated in his eyes than the princess in the eyes of the peasant. > And so he is satisfied with his portion and does not allow his heart to > covet and desire something that is not his, for he knows that God does not > wish to give it to him; he cannot take it by force or by his thoughts or > schemes. He has faith in his Creator, that He will provide for him and do > what is good in His eyes.\\"Ibn Ezra, comments on \\"You shall not covet\\" Maimonides (the Rambam) viewed the prohibition of coveting as a fence or boundary intended to keep adherents a safe distance away from the very serious sins of theft, adultery, and murder: > \\"Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner > (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a > good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) > will come to steal it, as it is written (Mikha 2:2) [Micah 2:2], 'They covet > fields and (then) steal them.' And if the owner approaches him with a view > to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to > murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot > [Naboth].\\"Maimonides, Hilkhot Gezeila Va-aveida 1:11 Maimonides' admonition to learn from the example of Ahab and Naboth refers to the narrative in 1 Kings 21 in which King Ahab of Israel tried to convince Naboth the Jezreelite to sell him the vineyard Naboth owned adjacent to the king's palace. Ahab wanted the land to use as a vegetable garden, but Naboth refused to sell or trade the property to Ahab saying, \\"The forbid that I should give up to you what I have inherited from my fathers!\\"1 Kings 21:4 (JPS) Ahab's wife Jezebel then conspired to obtain the vineyard by writing letters in Ahab's name to the elders and nobles in Naboth's town instructing them to have two scoundrels bear false witness claiming that Naboth has cursed both God and the king. After Naboth was subsequently stoned to death, Ahab seized possession of Naboth's vineyard. The text describes the as very angry with Ahab, and the prophet Elijah pronounces judgment on both Ahab and Jezebel.1 Kings 21:20-23 New Testament views The Gospel of Luke describes Jesus' warning to guard one's heart against covetousness. \\"Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\\"Luke 12:15 ESV Jesus also describes the sins that defile a person as sins from coming from untamed desires in the heart.Mark 7:20-22 The Epistle of James portrays covetous desire residing in the heart as being the internal source of temptation and sin.James 1:13-15 James goes on to describe how covetous desire leads to fighting and that lack of material possessions is caused by not asking God for them and by asking with wrong motives. The Epistle to the Ephesians and the Epistle to the Colossians regard the sin of covetousness as a kind of idolatry and list this sin along with sexual immorality and impurity which give rise to the wrath of God.Ephesians 5:3-6, Colossians 3:5-6 The New Testament stresses thanksgiving and contentment as proper heart attitudes that contrast covetousness. John the Baptist exhorted soldiers to be content with their pay rather than extorting money by threats and false accusations.Luke 3:14 The book of Hebrews encourages one to keep his life free from the love of money and \\"be content with what you have\\" and depend on the promises and help of God rather than trusting in wealth.Hebrews 13:5-6 The book of 1 Timothy contains a classic warning against the love of money and stresses that it is great gain to be content with food and clothing. Catholic Church views Detail: Luxuria (Lust), in The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things, by Hieronymus Bosch The Catholic Church considers the prohibition on coveting in Deuteronomy 5:21 and Exodus 20:17 to include two commandments, which are numbered the ninth and tenth. In the Catholic view, the ninth commandment is a prohibition on carnal concupiscence (or lust), and the tenth commandment prohibits greed and the setting of one's heart on material possessions. =Prohibition of carnal concupiscence (lust)= The ninth commandment forbids \\"the interior, mental desire or plan\\" to do adultery, which is strictly forbidden by the sixth commandment. It is considered sinful when desired or thought lustfully and deliberately with \\"full knowledge and full consent of the will\\". A key point in the Catholic understanding of the ninth commandment is Jesus' statement in the Sermon on the Mount, \\"Every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, The Ninth Commandment, Matthew 5:28 In Theology of the Body, Pope John Paul II says that Jesus forbids one to commit adultery in the heart not only with another's spouse, but also with his/her own spouse when one looks at him/her lustfully or treats him/her \\"only as an object to satisfy instinct\\". There is an emphasis on the thoughts and attitudes of the heart as well as the promise that the pure in heart will both see God and be like him. While baptism confers upon the Christian the grace of purification from sins, the baptized must continue to struggle against disordered desires and the lust of the flesh. By God's grace he can prevail 1) by virtue of the gift of chastity which empowers love with an undivided and upright heart 2) by purity of intention which seeks to find and fulfill the will of God in everything 3) by purity of vision which disciplines the feelings and imagination and refuses complicity with impure thoughts, and 4) by prayer which looks to God for help against temptation and casts one's cares upon God.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2520 Adherence to the ninth commandment's requirement of purity requires modesty, which \\"protects the intimate center of the person\\". Modesty refuses to uncover \\"what should remain hidden\\". Modesty is a servant of chastity and guides how one looks at others and behaves toward them in protective conformity with the dignity of the human person. Modesty encourages patience and moderation in loving relationships, requiring that the conditions for the definitive giving and commitment of man and woman be fulfilled to one another. It is a decency that inspires one's clothing. Modesty is discreet and avoids harmful curiosity. In addition to personal purity and modesty, the Catholic Church teaches that Christian purity requires a purification of the social climate. Communications media ought to demonstrate respect and restraint in their presentations which should be free from widespread eroticism and the inclination to voyeurism and illusion. Moral permissiveness rests on a wrongheaded understanding of human freedom. Education in the moral law is necessary for the development of true freedom. Educators should be expected to give young people \\"instruction respectful of the truth, the qualities of the heart, and the moral and spiritual dignity of man.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2525-2526 = Prohibition of greed and envy of possessions= 1909 painting The Worship of Mammon, the New Testament representation and personification of material greed, by Evelyn De Morgan. Catholic teaching on the prohibition of greed and envy center around Christ's admonishments to desire and store up treasure in Heaven rather than on Earth, \\"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, The Tenth Commandment, Matthew 6:21 The tenth commandment is regarded as completing and unfolding the ninth. The tenth commandment forbids coveting the goods of another, as the root of the stealing and fraud forbidden by the commandment, \\"You shall not steal.\\" \\"Lust of the eyes\\" leads to the violence and injustice forbidden by the commandment, \\"You shall not murder.\\" Covetousness, like sexual immorality, originates in the idolatry prohibited by the first three commandments. Along with the ninth commandment, the tenth summarizes the entire Ten Commandments, by focusing on the intentions and desires of the heart. Covetous desires create disorder because they move beyond satisfying basic human needs and \\"exceed the limits of reason and drive us to covet unjustly what is not ours and belongs to another or is owed to him.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2535 Greed and the desire to amass earthy goods without limit are forbidden as are avarice and the passion for riches and power. \\"You shall not covet\\" means that we should banish our desires for whatever does not belong to us. Never having enough money is regarded as a symptom of the love of money.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2536 Obedience to the tenth commandment requires that envy be banished from the human heart. Envy is a capital sin that includes sadness at the sight of another's goods and the immoderate desire to acquire them for oneself. The baptized person should resist envy by practicing good will and rejoicing and praising God for material blessings granted to neighbor and brother.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2538-2540 God warns man away from what seems \\"good for food . . . a delight to the eyes . . . to be desired to make one wise,\\"Gensesis 3:6 and law and grace turn men's hearts away from avarice and envy and toward the Holy Spirit who satisfies man's heart.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2541 Catholic teaching reminds that Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone, and bids them \\"renounce all that [they have]\\" for his sake and that of the Gospel.Luke 14:33 Jesus gave his disciples the example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who gave out of her poverty all that she had to live on.Luke 21:4 Detachment from riches is portrayed as obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of heaven.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2544, \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit\\"Matthew 5:3 illustrates that those who voluntarily do not receive their physical needs are more inclined to seek fulfillment of their spiritual needs through Jesus Christ. \\"The Lord grieves over the rich, because they find their consolation in the abundance of goods.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2547 \\"I want to see God\\" expresses the true desire of man. The water of eternal life quenches the thirst for God.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2557, John 14:14 Attachment to the goods of this world are a bondage. The Scriptural remedy is the desire for true happiness that is found in seeking and finding God. Holy people must struggle, with grace from on high, to obtain the good things God promises. Christ's faithful put to death their cravings and, with the grace of God, prevail over the seductions of pleasure and power.2548-2550 Catechism of the Catholic Church 2548-2550 For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet lose his own soul?Mark 8:36 Protestant views \\"Tenth Commandment\\", Harpers Weekly, March 12, 1870 Martin Luther views sinful human nature such that no person naturally desires to see others with as much as oneself, each acquiring as much as he can while pretending to be pious. The human heart, Luther says, is deceitful, knowing how to adorn oneself finely while concealing one's rascality. Luther further explains that the tenth commandment is not intended for the rogues of the world, but for the pious, who wish to be praised and considered as honest and upright people, because they have not broken any of the outward commandments. Luther sees covetousness in the quarreling and wrangling in court over inheritances and real estate. He sees covetousness in financiering practiced in a manner to obtain houses, castles, and land through foreclosure. Likewise, Luther sees the tenth commandment as forbidding contrivances to take another man's wife as one's own and uses the example of King Herod taking his brother's wife while his brother was still living.Mark 6:17-20 John Calvin views the tenth commandment as a demand for purity of the heart, above and beyond the outward actions. Calvin distinguishes between making an explicit design to obtain what belongs to our neighbor and a covetous desire in the heart. For Calvin, design is a deliberate consent of the will, after passion has taken possession of the mind. Covetousness may exist without such a deliberate design, when the mind is stimulated and tickled by objects on which we set our affection.John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Two, Chapter 8, Section 49 In explaining the prohibition on covetousness, Calvin views the mind as either being filled with charitable thoughts toward one's brother and neighbor, or being inclined toward covetous desires and designs. The mind wholly imbued with charity has no room for carnal desires. Calvin recognizes that all sorts of fancies rise up in the mind, and he exhorts the individual to exercise choice and discipline to shifting one's thoughts away from fleshly desires and passions. Calvin asserts that God's intention in the command is to prohibit every kind of perverse desire.John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Two, Chapter 8, Section 50 Matthew Henry sees the tenth commandment striking at the root of many sins by forbidding all desire that may yield injury to one's neighbor. The language of discontent and envy are forbidden in the heart and mind. The appetites and desires of the corrupt nature are proscribed, and all are enjoined to see our face in the reflection of this law and to submit our hearts under the government of it.Matthew Henry's Commentary on Exodus 20:16 See also * Seven Laws of Noah * Sin Notes Further reading * The Jewish Study Bible, Tanakh Translation. 2004.

Much of biblical preaching from the time of Moses to the exile is predicated on the either‚Äìor choice between exclusive worship of God and idols.Idolatry, HarperCollins Bible Dictionary, 1996, Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York:HarperCollins Publishers, The Babylonian exile seems to have been a turning point after which the Jewish people as a whole were strongly monotheistic and willing to fight battles (such as the Maccabean Revolt) and face martyrdom before paying homage to any other god.Idol: In the Exile and After, in HarperCollins Bible Dictionary, 1996, Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York: HarperCollins Publishers, ; Sermon LXXXIII: On Spiritual Idolatry, in Wesley, John, Sermons on Several Occasions, Vol. 2, Jackson, T., ed., London: J. Kershaw, 1825, pp. 314-315 According to the psalmist and the prophet Isaiah, those who worship inanimate idols will be like them, that is, unseeing, unfeeling, unable to hear the truth that God would communicate to them.Beale, G.K., We Become What We Worship: A Biblical Theology of Idolatry, InterVarsity Press, 2008, , pp.41-42, 141-142 Paul the Apostle identifies the worship of created things (rather than the Creator) as the cause of the disintegration of sexual and social morality in his letter to the Romans.Romans 1:22-29; Dunn J.D.G., The Theology of Paul the Apostle, 1998, Grand Rapids: William B. Eardmans Publishing Company, pp.33-34, Although the commandment implies that the worship of God is not compatible with the worship of idols, the status of an individual as an idol worshiper or a God worshiper is not portrayed as predetermined and unchangeable in the Bible. When the covenant is renewed under Joshua, the Israelites are encouraged to throw away their foreign gods and \\"choose this day whom you will serve\\".Joshua 24:14-15, commentary on Joshua 24:15, Adam Clarke‚Äôs Commentary on the Holy Bible, Earle, Ralph, 1967, Beacon Hill Press, , p. 263 King Josiah, when he becomes aware of the terms of God's covenant, zealously works to rid his kingdom of idols.2 Kings 22-23; 2 Chronicles 34; Josiah, The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Vol. 3, Freedman, David Noel, ed., Doubleday, 1992, According to the book of Acts, Paul tells the Athenians that though their city is full of idols, the true God is represented by none of them and requires them to turn away from idols.Acts 17:16; Walvoord and Zuck, The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament, 1983, Colorado Springs: David C. Cook, p. 402, Commandment  Words translated as \\"idol\\"  The English word \\"idol\\" in translations of the Bible may represent any of several Hebrew words. In the commandment \\"You shall not make for yourselves an idol\\", the word is pesel, indicating something carved or hewn. In subsequent passages, pesel was applied to images of metal and wood, as well as those of stone. Other terms, such as nƒìsek and massƒìk√¢, massƒìb√¢, ≈çseb, and maskit also indicate a material or manner of manufacture.Idol, Image in Unger, Merrill F., The New Unger‚Äôs Bible Dictionary, Harrison, R.K., ed., 2005, Chicago: Moody Publishers, , pp. 601-602 Some terms represent the consistently negative moral view with which idols are portrayed by the Bible.International Standard Bible Encyclopedia:E-J, Bromiley, Geoffrey W., 1982, Wm. B. Eardmans Publishing Co., , p. 795 For example, idols are referred to as \\"non-God,\\"Deuteronomy 32:17, 21; Jeremiah 2:11 \\"things of naught,\\"Leviticus 19:4 \\"vanity,\\"Deuteronomy 32 \\"iniquity,\\"1 Samuel 15:23 \\"wind and confusion,\\" Isaiah 41:29 \\"the dead,\\"Psalm 106:28 \\"carcasses,\\"Leviticus 26:30; Jeremiah 16:18 and \\"a lie\\".Isaiah 44:20 Other terms are deliberately contemptuous, such as elilim, \\"powerless ones\\", and gillulim, \\"pellets of dung\\".idol, in The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary, 1996. Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York: HarperCollins Publishers Inc.  Cultural context  The idols of the Ancient Near East were central figures of the tribal cults around the Israelites. They are said to have been placed upon pedestals, clothed and colored, and fastened with chains of silver or nails of iron lest they should fall over or be carried off.Jeremiah 10:9, 14; Ezekiel 16:18; Isaiah 40:19, 41:7 To demonstrate victory over an enemy's idols, it was customary to take away the idols of the vanquished,Isaiah 10:10-11, 36:19, 46:1; Jeremiah 48:7, 49:3; Hosea 10:5; Daniel 11:8; and a similar custom is frequently mentioned in the cuneiform texts.See, for example, History of Assurbanipal, translated from the cuneiform inscriptions by G. Smith, 1871, p. 298 Scholars have discussed whether idol worshipers made a distinction between a spiritual being that existed independently of idols and the physical idols themselves. Some scholars opine that the pagans in the Hebrew Bible did not literally worship the objects themselves, so that the issue of idolatry is really concerned with whether one is pursuing a \\"false god\\" or \\"the true God\\". In addition to the spiritual aspect of their worship, peoples in the Ancient Near East took great care to physically maintain their cult idols and thought that the instructions for their manufacture and maintenance came from the spirit of the god. Magical ceremonies were performed through which the people believed the spirit of the god came to live in the physical idol. When idols were captured or not cared for, the associated religious practices also flagged. So while scholars may debate the relative importance of belief in the physical object or the spirit it represented or housed, in practice the distinction was not easy to discern.Idol, HarperCollins Bible Dictionary, Achtemeier, Paul J., general editor, 1996, HarperCollins Publishers, , p. 449 Biblical injunctions Idolatry is prohibited in many biblical passages, although there is no single section that contains a complete definition. Rather there are a number of commandments on this subject spread through the books of the Tanakh, and taking these passages together, idolatry may be defined as the worship of idols (or images); the worship of polytheistic gods by use of idols (or images); the worship of created things (trees, rocks, animals, astronomical bodies, or another human being); and even the use of idols in the worship of the God of Israel.Idolatry, The New Unger‚Äôs Bible Dictionary, Harrison, R.K., ed., 2005, Chicago: Moody Publishers, , p. 602 The question has been raised whether the ancient view of this command prohibits images of Yahweh. Some scholars have proposed that the golden calf made by Aaron (while Moses was on the mountain receiving the Ten Commandments) was supposed to represent Yahweh, or perhaps a throne or steed on which the people were to envision Yahweh.Idol: Images in Israel, The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Freedman, David N, editor-in-chief, 1992, New York: Doubleday, , pp. 378-379 According to Exodus 32:7-8, in a divine speech to Moses, Yahweh reveals the events going on at the base of Mt. Sinai to Moses, judging the golden calf to be a violation of the recently revealed law: \\"They have turned aside quickly from the way that I commanded them\\".Dozeman, Thomas B., Eardman‚Äôs Critical Commentary: Exodus, 2009, Wm. B. Eardman‚Äôs Publishing Co., Grand Rapids, MI , p. 705 Others point out that the golden calf episode leads to the breaking of the tablets of the Decalogue, something that implies that the covenant had been violated. This event and the plurality of the language used in the second commandment leads many scholars to conclude that it prohibits the making of any image of Yahweh as well as any image of a created thing to which divinity would be ascribed.Waaler, Erik, The Shema and the first commandment in First Corinthians: an intertextual approach to Paul‚Äôs reading of Deuteronomy, (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen Zum Neuen Testament 2.Reihe) p. 95 In a number of places the ancient texts assert that God has no shape or form and is utterly incomparable; thus no idol, image, idea, or anything in creation could ever capture God's essence.e.g. Isaiah 40:18, 25; Idol: Images in Israel, The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Freedman, David N, editor-in-chief, 1992, New York: Doubleday, , p. 379 The narrative in Deuteronomy 4Deuteronomy 4:15-18 recounts that when the Israelites were visited by God at Mt. Sinai at the time the Ten Commandments were given, they saw no shape or form and this is stated as a reason why any physical representation of the divine is prohibited ‚Äì no idols of humans, animals, or heavenly bodies were to be made. Rather than use an idol, God chose to reveal himself in words, by working through people, and by working in history.Image of God, The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Freedman, David N, editor-in-chief, 1992, New York: Doubleday, , p. 389-391 According to the Book of Joshua, Abraham came from a land and a family that worshiped strange gods.Joshua 24:2; John Calvin (1509-1564) Commentary on Joshua, Commentary on Joshua 24:2 However, when their God revealed himself to Abraham and called him to leave his native land for Canaan, he did so.Genesis 12:1; Idolatry and Idol, Image, in The New Unger‚Äôs Bible Dictionary, 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed., Chicago: Moody Publishers, According to the Book of Genesis, image worship existed in the time of Jacob, from the account of Rachel taking teraphim along with her on leaving her father Laban's house.Rachel, in The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z, Wm. B. Eardman‚Äôs Publishing Company, 1988, , p. 31 As the leadership of Israel passed from Moses to Joshua, the covenant between Israel and God was renewed and warnings were repeated against adapting or adopting the customs of idol worship among the people the Israelites would encounter, on penalty of corporate destruction and loss of the promised land.Commentary on Joshua 23:1-16, The Collegeville Bible Commentary, Harren, Robert C., Censor Deputatus, The Liturgical Press, , p. 246 Through the centuries, idolatry became pervasive among the Israelites and supported by many of their kings, despite repeated warnings from the prophets and culminating in the Babylonian Exile. Along with the original warnings was a promise of restoration for those who would turn away from idols and back to God.Repentance, in Brueggemann, Walter, Reverberations of Faith: a theological handbook of Old Testament themes, Westminster John Knox Press, 2002, , p. 170 However, after repeated refusals to turn away from idols over time, God announced through the prophet Jeremiah that the covenant was broken beyond repair and the judgment (Babylonian Captivity) was sure to happen.Davidson, Robert, Jeremiah, Westminster John Knox Press, 1983, , pp.99-100 The commandments in the Hebrew Bible against idolatry also forbade the adoption of the beliefs and practices of the nations who lived around the Israelites at the time, especially the religions of ancient Mesopotamia, and Egypt. In dozens of passages, the Hebrew Bible refers to specific practices used to worship idols, including the offering of incense, prayers, food, drink, and blood offerings, singing and dancing, cutting one's flesh, bowing down to and kissing the idol, lewd behavior, passing one's children through the fire, cultic male and female prostitution, and human sacrifice, including child sacrifice.Idolatry, The Zondervan Topical Bible, Viening, Edward, ed., 1978, , p. 461; Idolatry: Idolatry of Israel‚Äôs neighbors The New Unger‚Äôs Bible Dictionary, Harrison, R.K., ed., 2005, Chicago: Moody Publishers, , pp. 603-604 The ancient understanding apparently did not conflict with the artistic rendering of created things, and the Bible describes the Tabernacle, and later the Temple, as having tapestries and objects incorporating cherubim, flowers, fruits, trees, and animals.Exodus 25, 26 and 37; 1 Kings 7 and 10; Tabernacle of Israel and The Temple of Solomon, in The New Unger‚Äôs Bible Dictionary, Harrison, R.K., ed., 2005 (originally published 1957, Moody Publishers, However, sometimes objects that God instructed to be made were turned into idols by the Israelites. The Book of Numbers contains a narrative in which God instructed Moses to make a bronze snake as part of addressing a plague of venomous snakes that had broken out among the Israelites as a punishment for sin. The bronze snake is mentioned again in 2 Kings 18; however, rather than remaining a memorial of God's providence, it became an idol that the people named and worshiped. Thus the bronze snake was destroyed in King Hezekiah's reforms.2 Kings 18:4; Bronze Serpent, in The New Unger‚Äôs Bible Dictionary, Harrison, R.K., ed., 2005 (originally published 1957, Moody Publishers, According to Exodus 25 and 37, the Ark of the Covenant was a rectangular container overlaid with pure gold with two gold cherubim on its cover. It was considered holy; it was kept in the Holy of Holies, the innermost part of the Tabernacle (and later the Temple), was not to be touched directly, and was only to be transported in a prescribed manner.Exodus 25, Walvoord and Zuck, The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament, 1983, Colorado Springs: David C. Cook, p. 148, However, it was not to be an object of worship, and when the Israelites carried it into war like a cult idol, assuming it would guarantee victory, they were defeated, suffering 30,000 casualties, and the Ark was captured and taken to the temple of a foreign god.1 Samuel 4:1-11, 5:1-5; Bell J.S. and Campbell S, The Complete Idiot‚Äôs Guide to the Bible, 2003, Indianapolis: Alpha Books, p. 103,  Violation  A narrative in 1 Kings 12:28-30 describes how Jeroboam had golden calves made for places of worship at Bethel and Dan. This was done for political purposes, to distance the allegiance of the Israelites from loyalty to worship in Jerusalem, which was in Judah and ruled by King Rehoboam. The text says, \\"This thing became a sin\\", and its establishment was accompanied by several related violations of the covenant with God.1 Kings 12:30a (NIV); Walvoord, J.F., and Zuck, R.B., The Bible Knowledge Commentary: Old Testament, 1983, Colorado Springs: David C. Cook, p. 512,514, The language used by Jeroboam to introduce the worship of these idols to Israel was very similar to that used by Aaron with regard to the golden calf at Mount Sinai. The images themselves were reminiscent of Egyptian gods represented by the bull.Idol, International Standard Bible Encyclopedia:E-J, 1982 (originally published 1915). Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., , p. 795 According to 1 Kings 13, God sends a prophet from Judah to denounce Jeroboam's actions and predict the coming of King Josiah (290 years later), who would destroy those priests who participated in the idolatrous practices.Walvoord, J.F., Zuck, R.B., The Bible Knowledge Commentary: Old Testament, Colorado Springs: David C. Cook, , p. 514 Not only did the common people substitute Canaanite gods and worship for the worship of the God of Israel, polytheism and worship of foreign gods became virtually official in both the northern and southern kingdoms despite repeated warnings from the prophets of God.God in the OT, The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Vol II, 1992. Freedman, David Noel, ed., New York: Doubleday. The Book of Kings gives an account of the great 9th-century BC contest at Carmel between Yahweh and Baal regarding control of the rain, and hence of deity: Elijah challenges the Israelites \\"If Yahweh is God, follow him, but if Baal, then follow him.\\" The people remain ambivalent until the victory of Yahweh is clear, at which point they execute the 450 prophets of Baal said to be present. Although the official, polytheistic policy propelled by King Ahab's wife Jezebel was unchanged in the short term, subsequent text indicates that Ahab later turned away from idols back to Yahweh.1 Kings 21:27-29; Smith, Mark, The Early History of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel, W.B. Eardman's Publishing Company, 2002, , p. 72 The prophetic books (Nevi‚Äôim) recount a continuing struggle against idolatry. For example, the biblical prophet Jeremiah complains: \\"According to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.\\"Jeremiah 2:28 Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Hosea referred to Israel's worship of other gods as spiritual adultery:Jeremiah 3:6-9, 5:7, Ezekiel 16:38, 23:37, Hosea 1:2; Adultery: OT Words, in Expository Dictionary of Bible Words: Word studies for key English Bible words based on the Hebrew and Greek Texts, Renn, Stephen D., ed., 2005, Hendrickson Publishers, Inc., \\"How I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have turned away from me, and by their eyes, which have lusted after their idols\\".Ezekiel 6:9; Tuell, Steven, The New International Bible Commentary: Ezekiel, 2009, Hendrickson Publishers, Inc., p. 33, This led to a broken covenant between Yahweh and Israel and \\"divorce\\",Jeremiah 3:8; Ryken P.G. and Hughes R.K., Jeremiah and Lamentations: From Sorrow to Hope, Chapter 3:God Files for Divorce, 2001, Crossway Publishers, manifested as defeat by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon followed by exile, from which the northern kingdom never recovered. The psalmist described idols as being made of gold, silver, wood, and stone. They are described as being only the work of men's hands, unable to speak, see, hear, smell, eat, grasp, or feel, and powerless either to injure or to benefit.Ps. 135:15-18; St. Augustine (Bishop of Hippo), Expositions on the Psalms: Psalms 126-150, Parker, J.H., London: F. and J. Rivington, 1857, pp. 147-148 The psalmist, and also the prophet Isaiah, warn that worship of such powerless objects is not harmless, however: \\"Those who worship them will be like them,\\" that is, unseeing, unfeeling, unable to hear the truth that God would communicate to them.Beale, G.K., We Become What We Worship: A Biblical Theology of Idolatry, InterVarsity Press, 2008, , pp.41-42, 141-142; Ps. 135:15-18; St. Augustine (Bishop of Hippo), Expositions on the Psalms: Psalms 126-150, Parker, J.H., London: F. and J. Rivington, 1857, pp. 147-148 The Bible presents Daniel and his companions as distinct, positive examples of individuals refusing to pay homage to another god, even at the price of their lives. During the time of the exile, Nebuchadnezzar erects a gold statue of himself and commands all subjects to worship it. Three Jewish officials ‚Äì Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego ‚Äì who had been taken to Babylon as youths along with Daniel, refuse to bow to the statue. As they face being burned alive in a furnace, they communicate their faith as well as their resolve: \\"If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.\\"Daniel 3:17-18; Telushkin, Joseph, Jewish Literacy: The most important things to know about the Jewish religion, its people and its history, 1991, William Morrow, pp. 80-81 Maccabean revolt After Antiochus IV Epiphanes recaptured Jerusalem in 167 BC, he forbade Torah and introduced worship of foreign gods into the Second Temple, and many Jews were martyred because they refused to acknowledge the claims of Seleucid deities.Smith, Lacey Baldwin, Fools, Martyrs, Traitors: the story of martyrdom in the western world, Northwestern University Press, pp.49-50  Judaism  In Judaism, God chooses to reveal his identity, not as an idol or image, but by his words, by his actions in history, and by his working in and through mankind. Idolatry is one of three sins (along with adultery and murder) the Mishnah says must be resisted to the point of death.Sanhedrin 74a; Telushkin, Joseph, A Code of Jewish Ethics: You shall be holy, 2006, Harmony/Bell Tower pp 471-472 By the time the Talmud was written, the acceptance or rejection of idolatry was a litmus test for Jewish identity:Seeskin, Kenneth, No Other Gods: the modern struggle against idolatry, 1995, Behrman House, pp.14-15 \\"Whosoever denies idols is called a Jew\\".Talmud Megilah 13 \\"Whosoever recognizes idols has denied the entire Torah; and whosoever denies idols has recognized the entire Torah.\\"Midrash Sifre, Deuteronomy 54 The Talmud discusses the subject of idolatry in many passages. An entire tractate, the Avodah Zarah (\\"strange worship\\") details practical guidelines for interacting with surrounding peoples so as to avoid practicing or even indirectly supporting such worship.Sicker, Martin, Between Man and God: Issues in Judaic thought, 2001, Praeger, pp.12-14 In his works, Philo of Alexandria defended the Jewish view of God against both the emperor-worship of the Roman world and the idolatrous worship of animals by the Egyptians.Philo of Alexandria, Jews in the Hellenistic World: Philo, Volume 2, translated by Williamson, Ronald, Cambridge University Press, 1989, , p.31 Maimonedes warned that special objects (such as the mezuzah) and special prayers (such as the shema) are intended to remind people of love for God and his precepts and do not in themselves guarantee good fortune (they are not to become idols).Glustrom, Simon, The Myth and Reality of Judaism: 82 misconceptions set straight, 1989, Behrman House Publishing, , p. 131; Kadden, Barbara Binder and Bruce, Teaching Mitzvot: Concepts, Values and Activities, 2003, Denver: A.R.E.

Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed., Chicago: Moody Publishers, Attitudes towards the interpretation of the Commandment changed through the centuries, in that while first century rabbis in Judea objected violently to the depiction of human figures and placement of statues in Temples, third century Babylonian Jews had different views; and while no figural art from first century Roman Judea exists, the art on the Dura synagogue walls developed with no objection from the Rabbis.Harold W. Attridge, Gohei Hata, et al \\"Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism\\" Wayne, MI:Wayne State University Press, 1992 pp 283-284  Christianity  Although Jesus discussed the Ten Commandments in the Sermon on the Mount, he did not speak directly of issues regarding the meaning of the commandment against idolatry. According to Acts of the Apostles, the apostles discussed the issue of what immediate behavioral changes would be required of gentiles who became followers of Jesus Christ at the Council of Jerusalem. They decided to instruct new converts: \\"You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality\\".Acts 15:29, Acts 21:25; Tomson, Peter J., Paul and the Jewish Law: halakha in the Letters of the Apostle to the Gentiles, 1990, Netherlands: Van Gorcum & Comp., pp. 177-178, In his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul clarified this instruction to counsel converts, who were concerned about the fact that much of the meat sold in the marketplace may have been ritually slaughtered on an idol's altar and/or part of it may have been consumed as an offering to an idol. He condemned attendance at idol feasts, where participation was clearly participation with idolatry.Commentary on 1 Corinthians 10:18-22, Adam Clarke‚Äôs Commentary on the Holy Bible, Earle, R., ed., Kansas City: Beacon Hill Press, 1967, p. 1108 However, Paul advised the Corinthians not to be concerned about meat being sold in the general marketplace or served to them at a meal at which they were a guest ‚Äì as long as it was not advertised as having been sacrificed to an idol and with consideration not to cause offense to another person's conscience.Commentary on 1 Corinthians 10:25-33, Adam Clarke‚Äôs Commentary on the Holy Bible, Earle, R., ed., Kansas City: Beacon Hill Press, 1967, pp. 1108-1109 The language used by Paul in these passages is similar to the first two commandments in regular reference to the jealousy of God, sharp warnings against idolatry and idol images, and the identification of Yahweh as creator and the one who delivered the Israelites from Egypt.Waaler, Erik, The Shema and the first commandment in First Corinthians: an intertextual approach to Paul‚Äôs reading of Deuteronomy, (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen Zum Neuen Testament 2.Reihe) , p. 97 In Athens, Paul was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols, and in the Areopagus, he presented the God of Israel as the creator of everything, as unique and not represented by any idol. He taught: In Ephesus, Paul incurred the wrath of silversmiths (who were worried about losing income from decreased sales of idols) when people responded to his preaching and turned away from idol worship.Gods, False: Artemis, in The New Unger‚Äôs Bible Dictionary, 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed. Chicago: Moody Publishers, Paul taught that Christians should actively avoid participating in the worship of anything other than God. He considered it common sense that the worship of God and the worship of any other spiritual being are incompatible: The New Testament also uses the term \\"idol\\" in reference to conceptual constructs, as in Paul's letter to the church in Colosse: \\"Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed which is idolatry.\\" This expands the scope of that which is included in idolatry to certain behaviors and priorities, which capture attention and regard at the expense of that which is owed to God.Colossians 3:5; Commentary on Colossians 3:5, Matthew Henry‚Äôs Commentary on the Whole Bible, Vol. 6, read online (See also Thou shalt have no other gods before me.) Paul warned the Galatians that those who live in idolatry \\"will not inherit the kingdom of God\\", and in the same passage associates witchcraft with idolatry.Galatians 5:19-21; Galatians: Luther, McGrath A. and Packer J.I., eds., 1998, Wheaton: Crossway Books, p. 279, In his letter to the Philippians, he refers to those whose \\"god is their stomach\\".Philippians 3:19; see also Romans 16:18, 2 Timothy 3:4, James 4:4; Hughes R.K., James: Faith that Works, 1991, Wheaton: Crossway Books, pp. 175-176, In several New Testament scriptures, including the Sermon on the Mount, the term idolatry is applied to the love of money.Matthew 6:24; Luke 16:13; Ephesians 5:5; Colossians 3:5; Idolatry: Figurative, in The New Unger‚Äôs Bible Dictionary, 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed., Chicago: Moody Publishers, The apostle James rebukes those who focus on material things, using language similar to that of Old Testament prophets: \\"When you ask [in prayer], you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God\\".James 4:3-5 (NIV); Hughes R.K., James: Faith that Works, 1991, Wheaton: Crossway Books, pp. 175-176, Paul commended the church in Thessalonica saying, \\"Your faith in God has become known everywhere ‚Ä¶ They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead‚ÄîJesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.\\"1 Thessalonians 1:8-10; Green G.L., The Pillar New Testament Commentaries: The Letters to the Thessalonians, 2002, Grand Rapids: W.B. Eardmans Publishing Co., p. 106, Paul identifies the worship of created things (rather than the Creator) as the cause of the disintegration of sexual and social morality in his letter to the Romans.

The Catholic Church teaches that idolatry extends beyond the worship of images of other gods. \\"Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of God; it is therefore incompatible with communion with God\\".Catechism of the Catholic Church 2113 The Catechism commends those who refuse even to simulate such worship in a cultural context and states that \\"the duty to offer God authentic worship concerns man both as an individual and as a social being.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2136 The Catechism of the Catholic Church notes that this commandment is recalled many times throughout the Bible and quotes passages describing temporal consequences for those who place trust elsewhere than in God: In his exposition of Psalm 96, Augustine of Hippo agreed with the psalmist's description of inanimate idols, and he recalled Paul's words to the Corinthians that sacrifices to such are offered to demons. Rather than alternate deities condemned by monotheism, these demons are portrayed by Augustine as malevolent beings seeking not to rule as much as to seduce people into sharing eternal punishment, much as a twisted criminal might implicate an innocent person to feed his own malevolence.Exposition of Psalm 96:7, St. Augustine (Bishop of Hippo), Expositions of the Psalms, Volume 4, Hill, E., Rotelle, JE, Augustinian Heritage Institute, New York: New City Press, 2002, , pp. 447-449 Anthony of Padua, seeking to reform the inordinate desire for money he observed in some priests, compared to idols those priests who bought and sold offices and abandoned their flocks, using the language of the psalmist and Isaiah to describe them as having eyes but not seeing, having feet but not walking.Antony, C.M., St. Anthony of Padua the Miracle Worker, Brunton Press, 2008, , p. 83 = Protestantism = John Calvin, a prolific and influential Reformation scholar, took a straightforward view of idolatry, patterned after the simplicity of the faith of the early apostles: John Wesley, preached on the text of the Apostle John, ‚ÄúDear children, keep yourselves from idols.\\"1 John 21, Sermon LXXXIII: On Spiritual Idolatry, in Wesley, John, Sermons on Several Occasions, Vol. 2, Jackson, T., ed., London: J. Kershaw, 1825, pp. 314-315 He thought that John was not referring to idols of the religions around Israel, since through the Babylonian Captivity, a deep abhorrence of such was in the Jewish people and would have been understood by converts. By idols, Wesley interpreted this verse to mean any thing or priority to which one's heart is given rather than to God. He notes that the Apostle John often encouraged love among Christians and realized that it must first be founded on love of God, which is only possible by being separate from the worship of idols: Martin Luther taught that whatever a person places their trust or priorities in, other than God, can become an idol. Rather than scorn the Israelites for falling into the worship of idols, Luther commented that people are spiritual beings, who know there is a divine authority and easily fall into idolatry because of our fallen nature. Knowing truth from idolatry, he explained, depends on the Bible, for without paying attention to the Word of God, people make up God's characteristics to believe that God is in agreement \\"with such works and worshippings as your devotion and good intention make choice of.\\"Luther, Martin, Hazlitt W. and Chalmers A, The Table Talk of Martin Luther, London:Bell & Daldy, 1872, p. 72 See also * Cult image * Icon * Murti * Shirk (Islam)  References   External links  * Worship, Idol entry at JewishEncyclopedia.com * Overview of the Halacha based on Maimonides‚Äô Mishneh Torah Idolatry and the Customs of the Nations * Noahide Laws * Definition of idolatry according to Merriam-Webster Dictionary * The Second Commandment Including passages from Exodus and Deuteronomy in Masoretic Hebrew, Septuagint Greek and several English translations. * Aseret Hadiberot The Second Commandment Category:Idolatry Category:Biblical phrases Category:Ten Commandments ","title":"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image"},{"id":"23892160","text":"Sir William Sydney Albert Atkins (6 February 1902 ‚Äì 15 August 1989) was the founder of Atkins, one of the United Kingdom's largest engineering consultancies.

The company also offers mobile phone repairs, jewellery and watch repair, and custom-made house signs. It is based in Wythenshawe, Manchester, and currently has over 2155 outlets in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In January 2014, Timpson purchased the photographic services franchise, Snappy Snaps, increasing its store count by 118. In January 2017, Timpson purchased the dry-cleaning business Johnsons Cleaners UK for ¬£8.25m, and together with their purchase of Morrisons Dry Cleaning business they are now the largest Dry Cleaning operators in the UK. Over half of Timpson shops are located in out of town locations, including in 550 Pods. History Timpson Shoes in Radcliffe in 1966 Timpson was founded in 1865 by shoemaker William Timpson and his brother-in-law Walter Joyce, selling shoes at 298 Oldham Road, Manchester. It expanded into shoe manufacturing in 1884 at factories in Kettering, and repairs in 1903. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1929. In the 1950s, turnover was around ¬£10,000,000 and profits ¬£900,000. The company moved its headquarters to Wythenshawe in 1964. In the early-1960s, family member and graduate of the University of Nottingham John Timpson returned from a post-graduate management training scheme to join the family- owned business, becoming director responsible for buying in 1970. In 1973, after John's father Anthony was ousted as chairman by his uncle Geoffrey, the company was acquired for ¬£28,600,000 by United Drapery Stores. John stayed with the firm, became managing director of leather and fur retailers Swears & Wells, then in 1975; appointed managing director of the former family business, William Timpson Ltd. In 1983, John led a ¬£42,000,000 management buyout of William Timpson from then-owners Hanson Trust plc. To raise funds, ¬£30,000,000 came from selling the freeholds of the firm's stores and leasing them back, the rest via debt financing from venture capitalists. After four years of poor trading, to reduce debt on the balance sheet, the company sold the loss-making shoe retail business for ¬£15,000,000 to rival George Oliver, and focused on building the shoe repairing and key cutting business. After diversifying into engraving, watch repairs, dry cleaning and photo processing, John Timpson bought the other shareholders out in 1993. The company then went on the acquisition trail, buying: 40 Persil Service concessions located in Sainsbury's stores in June 2008; 187 digital photo shops branded Klick and Max Spielmann in December 2008; 139 digital photo shops from Tesco, plus its instant kiosk business and online business, in February 2014; 200 Johnson Cleaners stores, including the Jeeves of Belgravia and Jeeves International, purchased from Johnson Service Group in January 2017. John Timpson wrote the book Dear James, in which he passes on to his son the lessons learned in thirty years as a chief executive. His second book How to ride a Giraffe describes his business philosophy. Timpson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2008 for services to the retail industry.

One of Maine's oldest lighthouses, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Saddleback Ledge Light Station on March 14, 1988. Description and history Saddleback Ledge is a rocky outcrop located roughly midway between Isle au Haut and Vinalhaven Island on the east side of Penobscot Bay. The lighthouse on it marks the entrance to the bay's main eastern passage. The light station consists of a single structure, a conical tower in height, built out of cut granite and topped by a ten-sided lantern house surrounded by an iron deck and railing. The interior of the tower has space for the keeper's quarters and supply storage, and has narrow vertical windows on its east and west faces. The light station was authorized in 1839, and the tower was built that year to a design by Alexander Parris. It is one of five lighthouses in the state whose design is attributed to Parris. The station at one point in the 19th-century had a wood frame addition, which doubled as a boathouse, but that has long since been removed. The lantern house, deck, and railing all date to 1883. The light was the second to be placed on Penobscot Bay. It was automated in 1954.

Ury. Subsequent editions in 1991 and 2011 added Bruce Patton as co-author. All of the authors were members of the Harvard Negotiation Project. The book made appearances for years on the Business Week bestseller list. The book suggests a method called principled negotiation or \\"negotiation of merits\\". Background Members of the Harvard Negotiation Project, Fisher and Ury focused on the psychology of negotiation in their method, \\"principled negotiation\\", finding acceptable solutions by determining which needs are fixed and which are flexible for negotiators. By 1987, the book had been adopted in several U.S. school districts to help students understand \\"non-adversarial bargaining\\". In 1991, the book was issued in a second edition with Bruce Patton, an editor of the first edition, listed as a co-author. The book became a perennial best-seller. By July 1998, it had been appearing for more than three years on the Business Week \\"Best-Seller\\" book list. As of December 2007, it was still making appearances on the list as one of the \\"Longest Running Best Sellers\\" in paperback business books. The third edition was published in 2011. Method of principled negotiation The method of principled negotiation was developed at the Harvard Program on Negotiation by Fisher, Ury, and Patton. Its purpose is to reach agreement without jeopardizing business relations. The method is based on five propositions: = \\"Separate the people from the problem\\" = The first principle of Getting to Yes‚Äî\\"Separate the people from the problem\\"‚Äîapplies to the interaction between the two parties to a negotiation. The principle is broken down into three subcategories: perception, emotion, and communication. The authors point out that negotiators are people first‚Äîpeople who have values, cultural backgrounds, and emotions that vary by person. Getting to Yes teaches that this human aspect can be either helpful or disastrous. Negotiation can either build trust and understanding with a positive relationship established at the end, or lead to frustration or dissatisfaction. The authors discuss how the relationship between parties tends to become entangled with the problem that the parties are discussing. Incorrectly deducing the intentions of the other party based on one's own fear is a common mistake; the authors describe it as a bad habit that could cost \\"fresh ideas in the direction of agreement\\". The authors explain that feelings are just as important as the content of the dispute during negotiation. Communication is the main aspect of negotiating, and the authors point out three common problems in communication: # Not clearly speaking with the other party, but instead attempting to impress those within one's constituency by taking a side instead of working toward a mutual agreement; # Not actively listening to the other party, but instead only listening to rebut the other party's statements; # Misunderstanding or misinterpreting what the other party has said. Similarly, in the book, I Win You Win, Carl Lyons explored the principle of \\"separating the person from the problem\\" and discovered that interests are an extension of values. People's current interests are always attempting to satisfy something that they value. Understanding this principle is a key first step in understanding people's behavior in negotiations. = \\"Focus on interests, not positions\\" = The second principle‚Äî\\"Focus on interests, not positions\\"‚Äîis about the position that the parties hold and the interests that led them to that position. The authors recommend that negotiators should focus on the interests behind the position that each party holds. Both parties should discuss their interests and keep an open mind to the other side of the argument. It is crucial to put yourself in the shoes of the other side to try to understand \\"why\\" the other side is acting the way they are or rather \\"why they are not\\". The authors state that \\"the most powerful interests are basic human needs\\". = \\"Invent options for mutual gain\\" = The third principle‚Äî\\"Invent options for mutual gain\\"‚Äîis about benefiting both parties that are doing business. This principle aims to help the parties find an option that will impact each party in a positive way, making both sides feel like they did not get taken advantage of during the negotiation. It is important to listen to the other party and not make a decision until both parties feel that they have been heard. Both parties should clearly explain their intentions and what they want out of the conversation. = \\"Insist on using objective criteria\\" = The fourth principle‚Äî\\"Insist on using objective criteria\\"‚Äîis about making sure that the conversation stays on topic and that it is productive. The parties are making deals based on objective and practical criteria. The three steps to using objective criteria are to find out what the other party's intentions are, keep an open mind, and never give in to pressure or threats. Each party is in charge of keeping the other party committed to the conversation. = \\"Know your BATNA\\" = The fifth principle‚Äî\\"Know your BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)\\"‚Äîemphasizes that no method can guarantee success if all the leverage lies on the other side. The authors suggest two methods of going about negotiating from a position of power. First, each party should protect themselves first. Second, each party should make the most of the power within their own assets to negotiate and win against the opposite party. When negotiating, the parties must resist the urge to constantly compromise for fear of completely losing the negotiation. Such compromises may allow for a shorter negotiation, but may also leave the primary party with a deal that didn't benefit them to the full extent. Establishing a \\"bottom line\\" can protect the negotiator's final offer, but may limit the ability to learn from the negotiation itself and may preclude further negotiation that possibly could result in a better advantage for all parties involved. When considering final decisions, each party may want to take a step back and consider all possible alternatives to the current offer being made. One example in the book describes a house on the market: Thinking of all other possibilities if the house were not sold should be compared with the option of selling the house to ensure the best decision is made. Principled negotiation in action The article \\"Taking steps toward 'Getting to Yes' at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida\\" highlights principled negotiation in practice by a major insurance company. Blue Cross and Blue Shield‚Äîaware of increasing competition, rising healthcare prices, and increased customer expectations‚Äîsought to highlight other parties' interests when creating policies so as not to drive away business. The authors noted that applying principled negotiation techniques came much more naturally at the executive level and needed more practice at lower levels of management. Criticism James J. White, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, suggested that Getting to Yes is not scholarly or analytical and relies on anecdotal evidence, and that \\"the authors seem to deny the existence of a significant part of the negotiation process, and to oversimplify or explain away many of the most troublesome problems inherent in the art and practice of negotiation\\". There is no quantitative evidence presented that suggests outcomes using this technique will typically be better than an alternative method, such as positional bargaining.

He met Yuliet Ortega in Cuba and decided that she would be the younger sister of Quiroz in the music video. Marcovich features the similarities of the two women: green eyes and persistent thoughts about their missing fathers. After shooting the music video, he filmed the two women over a period of three years and created the film, Who the Hell is Juliette? The film was filmed in Cuba, Mexico, and the United States. Plot Who the Hell is Juliette? begins with Yuliet Ortega saying that her name on the title card, Juliette Ortega, is misspelled and demanding that it is corrected. The director immediately complies and the card is corrected to Yuliet Ortega. Ortega is a 16-year-old girl who is being taken care of by her grandmother. Her mother committed suicide, while her father left his family and went to the United States. Ortega became a jinetera to support herself. During the shooting of a music video, Ortega meets 23-year-old Fabiola Quiroz who is a Mexican model.

Director Carlos Marcovich organizes a reunion for Ortega and her father, who lives in New Jersey. Finally, to save Ortega from street prostitution, Fabiola Quiroz helps her arrange a modeling interview. Salma Hayek and Francesco Clemente make guest appearances in the documentary. Reception =Critical reaction= Entertainment Weekly called the film the \\"artiest home movie ever made\\" and was critical about how the subtitles appeared and disappeared too quickly to be easily read. On the other hand, the New York Daily News called the film \\"a great example of what happens when a film maker follows a subject that intrigues him rather than a pre-set program\\". =Awards= The documentary received two Ariel Awards.

Watermark premiered the first episode, \\"The Sun Stealers\\", on January 7, 1979. The series gained popularity thanks to its relatable characters, full symphonic soundtrack, realistic sound effects, high production values and documentary style format. Eventually over 500 US FM radio stations, along with stations in New Zealand and Australia aired the series. Between 1979 and 1980, 26 half-hour programs were broadcast at various times on weekends, where they gained favorable worldwide press acclaim. Alien Worlds was soon heard on a weekly basis by millions of fans and was eventually carried by over 1500 top-rated FM radio stations worldwide. The series' sponsor was Peter Paul, Cadbury which advertised Cadbury Caramello chocolates touting their caramel centers. Four additional episodes were produced but never aired. The show is currently available on Sirius Satellite Radio and on the Alien Worlds website. The series is being developed for 3-D animation for television and DVD release. Plot summary The ISA, or International Space Authority, is a governing body of space development and exploration. Organized by all earth nations, it advances humans into deep space. Their base is officially named \\"The Arthur C. Clarke Astronomical Observatory\\" or \\"Starlab\\".

MixRadio was an online music streaming service owned by Line Corporation. The service was first introduced by Nokia in 2011 as Nokia Music for Windows Phone, serving as a successor to Nokia's previous Nokia Music Store/Comes with Music/Ovi Music Store initiatives, which was based on the LoudEye/OD2 platform. After its acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business, the service was briefly maintained by Microsoft Mobile Oy before it was sold to Japanese internet company Line Corporation in 2015. Following the acquisition, MixRadio expanded to Android and iOS in May 2015. On 16 February 2016, Line announced that MixRadio would be discontinued, citing \\"a careful assessment of the subsidiary's overall performance\\" and \\"the financial challenges posed by the music streaming market\\". Availability The service, in MixRadio form, was available as a free app for Android, iOS, Apple Watch, Amazon Appstore, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, Adidas miCoach Smart Run and Harman Kardon Omni Speaker range. Nokia Music Store was available in 33 countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States and Vietnam. France In France, the Nokia Music Store went live on 23 April 2008. UAE The Nokia Music Store went live in the United Arab Emirates in November 2008. Australia The Nokia Music Store went live in Australia on 22 April 2008. India The Nokia Music Store launched in India in 2009. Middle East Comes with Music was launched across 11 Middle Eastern territories, namely: Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestinian Territories, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman, on 11 February 2010. South Africa The Nokia Music Store was launched in South Africa on 24 April 2009. The Comes With Music product followed on 27 August 2009. The offerings were rebranded to align with Nokia's Ovi branding on 9 September 2010. Spain The service was announced for Spain on 28 September 2008.  History  =2007-2011= The service was originally launched in 2007 when Nokia set up their Nokia Comes With Music service, in partnership with Universal Music Group International, Sony BMG, Warner Music Group, EMI, and hundreds of independent labels and music aggregators, to allow 12, 18, or 24 months of unlimited free-of-charge music downloads with the purchase of a Nokia Comes With Music edition phone. Files could be downloaded on mobile devices or personal computers, and kept permanently. On 29 August 2007 Nokia launched the Ovi Music Store as part of the Ovi platform. services portal from Nokia. The original idea behind the store was to provide to all Nokia MP3 capable mobile users a music store on the phone as on the PC. The Ovi Music Store officially opened in the UK on 1 October 2007 with offering of music from SonyBMG, Universal Music, EMI and Warner Music Group, as well as others. This service had its own software to serve as front gate of the store on the PC and on the phones. It was called Nokia Ovi Player, and later Nokia Music Player. In October 2008, Nokia announced the Nokia 5800, a direct competitor to the iPhone and with it the service Comes With Music, which consists of a year of free music downloads included in the price of the phone. This service was optional to the carriers. Within the box of the phone there was a card with an ID that will be linked to the PC (MAC address) and mobile phone (IMEI), so that PC and mobile phone have unlimited music downloads for over a year. Until 2010 the service had DRM files that prevented files from being burn onto CDs, allowing playback from mobile devices and the PC software only. Market conditions encouraged a move to DRM free, as evidenced in the Brainstorm Magazine article \\"Music wants to be mobile...and DRM free\\". In case the user wanted to burn the song, they had to buy it from the store. During the latter part of 2010 and into 2011, Nokia Music continued developing its app client for the MeeGo platform along with its existing Symbian platform. In January 2011 Nokia withdrew this programme in 27 countries, due to its failure to gain traction; existing subscribers could continue to download until their contracts ended. The service continued to be offered until 2014 in China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa where take-up was better. Nokia Music launched for the first time on the Windows Phone platform with the Lumia 710 and Lumia 800 on 26 October 2011 in London. =2012-2013= With the launch of Windows Phone 8 in late 2012, Nokia Music came to the platform with an app optimised for the new operating system from Microsoft. During the following months, Nokia Music was also released to the Windows 8 and Windows 8 RT app stores. Nokia Music launched in the U.S. market on 15 September 2012 with a performance at Irving Plaza by Green Day. Fans were treated to a special performance from the band, along with heavy social media involvement by AT&T;, Nokia, the band themselves and Warner Bros. On 20 November 2013 Nokia renamed the service to \\"Nokia MixRadio\\". This change also made its way to the Windows 8 and Windows RT app stores The following day, Nokia MixRadio made its official global launch with a special event in New York City where Nile Rodgers played. =2014-2016= Nokia MixRadio began the year with the launch of the MixRadio app for the Nokia Asha and Nokia X platforms at GSMA Mobile World Congress in February 2014. The service was again renamed to only \\"MixRadio\\" on 1 July 2014, to reflect the change of ownership from Nokia to Microsoft. On 11 September 2014, the MixRadio application was announced for the Sonos range of wireless speakers with a companion app. MixRadio further extended their reach on 27 November 2014, with the application being added to the adidas miCoach Smart Run touchscreen watch. On 18 December 2014, after mulling a spin-off of the service, Microsoft announced that it would sell MixRadio to Line Corporation, a subsidiary of Naver Corporation, for an undisclosed amount. On 17 March 2015, the transaction was completed. At this time, beta versions of the app were released for Android and iOS. On 19 May 2015 MixRadio announced the launch of the commercial iOS and Android apps with simultaneous launch events in New York City and Singapore. MixRadio also announced their partnership with HTC at this event to integrate MixRadio into the BlinkFeed software of HTC smartphones. The HTC BlinkFeed integration with MixRadio went live on 9 June 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, MixRadio further expanded its reach to other platforms, namely Apple Watch, Amazon Appstore and Tizen. In the first week of November 2015, MixRadio launched as a fully featured web browser client for the Windows and OS X operating systems, mirroring the look and functionality of its smartphone apps. Starting in late September 2015, MixRadio was made available to download through the Amazon Appstore (and consequently BlackBerry devices). The app was also preinstalled on the Samsung Z3, a smartphone running the Tizen operating system. =Discontinuation= On 16 February 2016, Line announced that MixRadio would be discontinued, citing \\"a careful assessment of the subsidiary's overall performance\\" and \\"the financial challenges posed by the music streaming market\\". MixRadio was officially closed on 21 March 2016. Features =Catalogue= As of June 2015, MixRadio had licensed a collection of over 36 million music tracks. These tracks were collated from major, major independent and local music labels. =Mixes= MixRadio operated on the premise of playlists, named \\"mixes\\". Upon loading the app for the first time, the user was prompted to select some of their favourite genres, which will then ask for favourite artists that the user can choose. This was then designated the user's \\"My mix\\". Users were also able to select pre-made mixes by theme or genre, (for example 'Top 40 Australian charts' or 'Rock workout') or create their own mix purely on the selection of artists. =Optimised mixes= Users of MixRadio were able to like ('heart') or dislike ('broken heart)' a song as it is played, upon which these personal listening tastes are saved and new songs based on the users' preferences are played next in the mix. MixRadio possessed a team of staff that personally curated mixes tailored to the data collected around listeners' tastes and habits. =Offline mixes= A big premise of MixRadio was its ability to download mixes offline. This enabled users to listen to their favourite mixes when not in range of a WiFi or mobile data connection. =Unlimited downloads= In India, MixRadio was available for all Nokia Asha, Lumia and Nokia X phones. Users could download songs from MixRadio for free for the first three months after purchase of a Nokia Asha, Lumia or X-series phone, following which the subscription could be renewed for a fixed time period through the purchase of a voucher either online via the Oxicash website or offline through Nokia Care outlets. For Nokia Asha phones, subscription could also be renewed via carrier billing, with the supported carriers being Airtel, Vodafone and Idea. However, the vouchers were no longer issued from May 2014 and in November 2014, Microsoft announced that unlimited downloads from MixRadio will no longer be supported. MixRadio for Android and iOS public beta In late August 2015, MixRadio beta was opened to the general public to help test and contribute feedback regarding the app itself. The public betas were later expanded to the MixRadio client on iOS in early October 2015.

It was commissioned by the BBC to mark the deaths of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch, two of the last three surviving British veterans from the First World War, and was first broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 programme Today on 30 July 2009, the date of Allingham's funeral. The poem, named after the \\"Last Post\\" (the bugle call used at British ceremonies remembering those killed in war), makes explicit references to Wilfred Owen's poem from the First World War Dulce et Decorum Est. It imagines what would happen if time ran backwards and those killed in the war came back to life; their lives would still be full of possibilities and filled with \\"love, work, children, talent, English beer, good food.\\" The poem was generally well received, with one commentator saying that it was \\"simply a damn good poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending.\\" Another said that it was \\"moving reversal of history\\" and a \\"fine poem\\". Duffy herself was quoted as saying that she wanted to honour the tradition of poets who were soldiers. Commission Carol Ann Duffy, the British Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy was appointed as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman to be appointed to the post. She was asked by the BBC Radio 4 programme Today to write a poem to mark the deaths of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch. The poem was read by Duffy on Today on 30 July 2009, the day of Allingham's funeral. Allingham, who served with the Royal Naval Air Service before becoming a founder member of the Royal Air Force, died on 18 July 2009 at the age of 113; Patch, the last surviving man to have fought in the trenches in the war, died on 25 July 2009 at the age of 111. Their deaths left Claude Choules, who served in the Royal Navy during the war and who lived in Australia until his death in 2011, as the last surviving British veteran. Duffy said that she felt that she should \\"honour that great tradition of poets who were also soldiers\\", describing the poem as \\"an attempt at healing and being at one with the world\\", and \\"a tribute and blessing, even an apology, on behalf of poetry and all poets.\\" She added that she \\"had been thinking about Afghanistan and trying to enthuse new war poetry among contemporary poets.\\" The poem was broadcast one week after Duffy published a selection of poems she had commissioned from poets such as Sean O'Brien, Paul Muldoon and Daljit Nagra about the ongoing war in Afghanistan. Poem Wilfred Owen The poem takes its title from the bugle call used at British ceremonies remembering those killed in war, the \\"Last Post\\". It begins with two lines from the poem Dulce et Decorum Est by the First World War poet and soldier Wilfred Owen: In all my dreams, before my helpless sight He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. The title of Owen's poem is part of a line from the Roman poet Horace - ' (\\"It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country\\"). The phrase was inscribed over the chapel door at Sandhurst, the British military academy, in 1913. The phrase is again referenced when Duffy writes \\"Dulce ‚Äî No ‚Äî Decorum ‚Äî No ‚Äî Pro patria mori.\\" The writer Will Heaven said that, whilst the poem denies that death in war is \\"sweet and proper\\" (dulce et decorum), it does not deny that the soldiers died for their country (pro patria mori). The heart of the poem depicts events \\"if poetry could tell it backwards\\" ‚Äì soldiers who died in the war coming back to life, \\"lines and lines of British boys rewind / back to their trenches\\". The poem imagines \\"all those thousands dead / are shaking dried mud from their hair / and queuing up for home\\". Duffy pictures what would have happened to them if they had not died: You lean against a wall, your several million lives still possible and crammed with love, work, children, talent, English beer, good food. before adding, \\"You see the poet tuck away his pocket-book and smile\\". Erica Wagner, the literary editor of The Times, said that the poet Duffy refers to in the poem could be Owen, but could also be John McCrae, Isaac Rosenberg, or Charles Hamilton Sorley, or one of a number of other poets from the war. Wagner also noted that \\"Harry Patch and Henry Allingham escaped death, but never the effect of that awful war.\\" Reaction The poem received a generally favourable critical reaction. Wagner called it a \\"moving reversal of history\\", a \\"fine poem\\", and \\"the latest in a noble line of work [about the First World War] that aspires to a kind of salvation.\\" Heaven said that it was a \\"poignant and beautiful tribute\\" to Allingham. It has been called \\"sombre yet supremely uplifting\\". The poem was also noticed in the United States. Jenna Krajeski, a writer for The New Yorker, described it as \\"another strong at-bat\\", and said that the poem highlighted \\"the power, but also the shortcomings, of poetry\\" when writing about an \\"imaginary, impossible event\\" and also writing about writing about it. The American poet John Lundberg said that the poem was a \\"surprising success\\", adding that not only was it \\"accessible\\" and \\"a fitting tribute to those who served in World War I,\\" but also \\"simply a damn good poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending.\\" However, Christopher Howse, a writer for the Daily Telegraph, took a different view of the poem's merits, saying (under the title \\"Carol Ann Duffy falls short of Henry Allingham\\") that Duffy's verse form was \\"open, to the point of invisibility\\".

It was commissioned in the early 20th century by the wealthy entrepreneur Sam Hill, and dedicated on 4 July 1918 as a memorial to the people who had died in World War I. The memorial is constructed of concrete, and construction was commenced in 1918 and completed in 1929. Historical significance The Maryhill Stonehenge was the first monument in the United States to honor the dead of World War I - specifically, soldiers from Klickitat County, Washington who had died in the then ongoing war. The altar stone is placed to be aligned with sunrise on the summer solstice. Following the then-prevalent interpretation of Stonehenge, Hill thought that the original monument had been used as a sacrificial site. He was a Quaker, and commissioned the replica as a reminder that humanity is still capable of being sacrificed to the god of war. The monument is located within the former site of the town of Maryhill; the town later burned down, leaving only the concrete replica standing. The memorial overlooks the Columbia Gorge. A second formal dedication of the monument took place upon its completion on 30 May 1929. Sam Hill died in 1931, but lived long enough to see the re-installation of his Stonehenge replica completed. The dedication plaque on this Washington Stonehenge is inscribed: Current status The Maryhill Stonehenge, which also includes monuments to the soldiers of Klickitat County who died in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan is now part of the Maryhill Museum of Art. This concrete landmark is located off U.S. Highway 97, about two miles from where entering Washington from Oregon is permitted by crossing the Columbia River by bridge. Admission is free to visit the memorial; but donations for its continued maintenance are appreciated.

Retrieved on 2009-08-06. living in Nashville, Tennessee. Plot The film presents scenes of the lives of a group of seemingly deranged, sociopathic elderly individuals living in Nashville, Tennessee, \\"who do antisocial things in a non-narrative way.\\" The movie opens with multiple shots of the old gang members masturbating to trash. This continues as a recurring sequence throughout the film. These gang members are mostly male. There is only one woman among the main cast, though you can see others in brief shots later in the film. We get a glimpse into the home of the elderly thugs. The living room is squalid, and the old people lie around or dance through it and rant and rave about various meaningless topics. The kitchen, however, is clean. Various members of the gang are shown trespassing, partaking in vandalism, and disturbing the peace among other crimes. A few of the members are seen on a basketball court in broad daylight, mocking and laughing at a boy failing to make baskets. As the old people relax and lie down, the old lady sits in a wheelchair and cheers him on as the child describes hitting a doll with a hammer, before aggressively doing so. The movie displays a recurring theme of violence driven by peer pressure, and the ritualistic antics in which the gang collectively partakes. Briefly, a scene is played out involving the old lady on a small tricycle, dragging the beaten doll behind her by a string attached to the back of the bike. This is seen in greater detail towards the end of the film. An old man drags himself along the ground as the old lady, again, sits in her wheelchair. She instructs a fat kid on how to hide a razor blade in an apple and screeches with joy at the thought of their pain. The gang members display a strong, recurring theme of taking sadistic pleasure in the suffering of others. We later learn that other people have hurt the gang through societal standards and expectations and actively attempt to oppress their freedom of self. Later in the film, we see them ranting and making pancakes in the kitchen, chanting \\"make it, make it, don't fake it\\". The scene changes to the dark living room, which also features a dining table. Two old men sit across from each other, both wearing hats that are connected by a large pipe. They do not take these hats off and remain connected throughout the scenes in which they are featured. The old lady serves them pancakes, screams at them for a short time period, and then instructs an old shouting man to liberally apply dish soap to the pancakes. The hat men are henceforth forced to eat the pancakes. They do not appear to mind. The movie is peppered with more scenes of the gang humping trash. An old man, clad in only a Confederate flag t-shirt, humps a tree. The gang sits out on the porch and talks of freedom and the demons in the night. An old man jerks off in the corner. The gang hires three fat prostitutes. In a line, they bend over on the bed in their underwear while the old people walk back and forth and tap the prostitutes' butts as they pass. Occasionally, one drums on their butt before moving on. The prostitutes lie on the bed and cheer while one of the men sings and tap dances in the corner. Another man masturbates to this. That man is then shown sitting in the tap dancing corner in his wheelchair, while the prostitutes sit around him, sing \\"Silent Night\\", and rub his crotch. The gang go out for a walk. They sing songs, particularly \\"Three Little Devils\\", and are shown standing still under a bridge, doing nothing, as the water flows by. At night, a man in a french maid costume gives a sort of sermon, which ends in an expression of his hearty enthusiasm for fornicating with trash. This man appears to die in the next scene. The men wearing hats sit around him, apparently mourning. Another old man sits in a chair and plays a twangy rendition of an apparently original song, which he entitles \\"You Girls Sure Suck Large Fat Penis\\". As the film continues, the rants of the gang members grow more bitter. They express their hatred, their pain, their fear, their lack of belief in magic. A man lies on the bed, talks about drugs, and blows a trumpet. Toward the end, the gang goes for a bike ride. The woman is continuously singing \\"Three Little Devils\\". They all drag dolls behind them, tied to the back of the bicycles. Integrated with this are scenes of a night time car ride; the old people split into two car pools. A man in one car talks of society, the power it holds over people, and how the way they live is in a state of true freedom from its clutches. The films ends with the woman carrying an infant in a carriage and sings a lullaby to it as the film cuts off.

Overhead lights beamed down upon the trash in a Broadway-style that Korine found very dramatic. They began to resemble human form, beaten, abused and \\"very humpable.\\"Ebiri, Bilge.

Korine remembered, as a teenager growing up in Nashville, a group of elderly peeping toms who would come out at night. He has described them as \\"the neighborhood boogeymen who worked at Krispy Kreme and would wrap themselves in shrubbery, cover themselves with dirt, and peep through the windows of other neighbors.\\"Treihaft, Lauren; Brooks, Brian (2009-09-17). \\"Harmony Korine: 'I‚Äôm not going to lie and say that I don‚Äôt like provoking an audience'.\\" IndieWire.

He remembers his first camera, given to him by his father, and reusing the tape over and over again. \\"There was something interesting about certain images or scenes bubbling up to the surface.\\"Bilton, Chris. (2009-09-14). \\"Interview: Harmony Korine.\\" Eye Weekly. Retrieved on 2009-10-21. On the rationale for using VHS as the medium for Trash Humpers, Korine stated \\"There's this obsession nowadays with technology and the fact that everything looks so clear. Everything needs to be so high-definition. There was a strange beauty in the analog. You almost have to squint to see things through the grain and the mist. There's something sinister about it.\\" Upset over the bureaucracy in producing his previous and still most expensive feature, Mister Lonely, Korine aimed to make his next film as fast as he could, analogous to the free-form immediacy of painter and canvas. As a self-proclaimed \\"mistakist artist\\", Korine encouraged spontaneity. Like Julien Donkey-Boy, the script was merely a collection of written down ideas. Before filming, Korine shot lo-fi images of people in costumes late at night to help find his aesthetic./ Filming lasted only a couple of weeks. \\"Once everyone was in their character and their costume, and I had figured out the structure of it, the randomness, the anti-aesthetic, it was really the performers, the Trash Humpers, walking around at night, videotaping each other doing these things,\\"Tully, Michael (2009-09-16). \\"A Conversation With Harmony Korine .\\" Hammer to Nail. Retrieved on 2009-09-19. Korine recalled. \\"We would just walk around and sleep under bridges or behind a strip mall somewhere. We'd get these big tractor tires and make a nest to sleep in.\\" Korine adds, \\"it was pretty intense because there were no breaks. It was just constant. Korine says that he didn't think traditionally about scenes, sounds, or color during filming, but more about being true to a feeling. \\"If it feels right to me. If there is some strong, palpable, raw quality in the moment then I won't question it.\\" Korine himself plays as one of the Trash Humpers. Korine cut the film on two VCRs to instill an approximate randomness. \\"I wanted a kind of incidental awkwardness, like maybe the guy taping it had turned it off and on.\\" Korine often cites that in creation of the film he aimed to mimic a found object or artifact. He even flirted with the idea of \\"leaving the film on a sidewalk somewhere\\" or place various parts of the film at different flea markets to be unearthed at random and eventually put together as a whole, but ultimately decided he would claim ownership when he realized the copyright could not hold that way. At the film's premiere in Toronto, Korine informed the audience that the title was to be taken literally and those likely to walk out were given due warning. In an interview, he state, \\"That's why I named it Trash Humpers, because I didn't want to fool anyone.\\" There were only four months between filming started and the world premiere. For Korine, Trash Humpers is an elaborate portrait of the \\"American Landscape\\": a series of \\"park garages, back alleyways, and beautiful lamp posts that light up the gutter.\\" Korine has repeatedly emphasized his use of street lamps and how they are for him deeply representative of America. Korine sees the film as an ode to vandalism. \\"I have a real deep love and admiration for these characters. Not for what they do, but for the way they do it.\\" \\"There can be a creative beauty in their mayhem and destruction. You could say these characters are poets or mystics of mayhem ... comedic with a vaudevillian horror.\\"Kohn, Eric. (2009-09-30). \\"His Humps.\\" New York Press. Retrieved on 2009-10-21.

At the beginning of February 1940 the 3rd Submarine Division was briefly transferred to Casablanca to carry out surveillance of the Canary Islands, where a couple of German cargo ships were present. The submarine division was then assigned to the Mediterranean theatre on 12 April, first at Bizerte then, without the Fresnel, at Beirut, under the authority the British commander-in-chief in Alexandria. Prot√©etook part in several patrols in the Dodecanese until the signing of the armistice between France and Germany on 22 June 1940. On 25 June, the date the armistice came into force, the captain of Prot√©e ignored an order to return to Beirut, and instead sailed to Alexandria, becoming part of Force X. The captain was chastised for this incident. Force X continued in action with the Allies until June 1943, when after several months of negotiations with the French Forces of Africa, to form the French Forces of the Liberation. Prot√©e left Alexandria on 18 June to sail to Oran, departing Oran during November. On 22 November, during the boat's first mission, she torpedoed a German cargo ship off Agay, but failed to sink her. On 18 December 1943 Prot√©e, under the command of Capitaine de corvette Georges Mill√©, sailed to patrol off Marseilles but never returned. The French Navy long thought that the loss of Prot√©e was due to a surface engagement with a German naval vessel. However a dive conducted in 1995 confirmed the theory developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s that the submarine's loss was caused by striking a mine. There was no mention of an engagement with an Allied submarine in the German naval archives. Prot√©e disappeared on 20 December 1943 with the loss of all hands, including three Royal Navy liaison personnel. The later submarine Laubie was named after the Prot√©es chief engineer, Louis Laubie.  Discovery of the wreck  The wreck was discovered on 6 April 1995 at by the COMEX vessel R√©mora 2000.

Established in 1795, it is the second- oldest of Maine's coastal lighthouses, and the only lighthouse in the state housing a first-order Fresnel lens. With its light at above mean sea-level, the present tower, built in 1857, is its highest of the state's lighthouses. Automated in 1985, the buildings of the light station are now operated as a museum property by a non-profit organization, and are seasonally open to the public via scheduled ferry from Popham Beach in Phippsburg. The light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Seguin Island Light Station in 1977. Seguin Light is currently deactivated due to an issue with an undersea cable that powered the Island. Description and history Seguin Island is a island located about two nautical miles south of Fort Popham in southernmost Phippsburg. The light station is located at the island's highest point, and includes the lighthouse itself, the keeper's house, fog signal building, a small oilhouse, and a tramway for bringing supplies from the shore to the site. The tower is built of cut granite blocks, and is tall and in diameter at the base. The keeper's house is built of brick, and is 1-1/2 stories in height with a gabled roof; it now houses a museum and shop. The oilhouse and fog signal building are also brick. The tramway consists of wooden rails mounted on timber piles. The light station was established in 1795, in response to a petition by Massachusetts authorities (Maine then being part of Massachusetts). The first tower was a wood frame structure completed in 1797. It was replaced in 1820 by a stone tower, which was replaced by the present tower in 1857. Most of the extant structures on the island also date from the 1857 construction period. It is the highest lighthouse on the Maine coast and has the only first order fresnel lens currently used in the state. Seguin Light was deactivated by the coast guard in April of 2019 due to a power cable problem. The lighthouse is awaiting a generator, and eventually a more permanent fix in the form of solar panels. In the meantime, the coast guard has set up a temporary solar beacon as a navigational aid.

Both were simply known as the Northern and Southern districts, and a third separate area consisted of the City of Bridgetown. Each of these districts were run by Chairmen, and the city with a mayor affiliated with Barbados' political parties. Northern District The Northern District contained all parishes northwards of the parishes of Saint Michael, Saint George and Saint John.

Disestablishment In between 1967-1969, the process of local government was phased out. At this time all local matters became transferred to the national level, to the Interim Commissioner of Local Government.

The anti-air defence is provided by two mobile shoulder based Strela-2 SAM systems. It is fitted with an Otobreda 76mm main gun while two AK-630 30mm guns act as CIWS. In addition, the ship carries one HAL Chetak or HAL Dhruv helicopter.  Construction  The Naval Design Bureau under Project 25A designed the Kora-class corvettes. INS Kulish along with INS Karmuk were ordered in October 1994 by the Indian Navy. Her keel was laid in October 1995 and she was launched in August 1997 before being commissioned on 20 August 2001 by the then Governor of West Bengal, Viren J. Shah at Kolkata. During the commissioning ceremony, the Governor of West Bengal stressed the need for development of indigenous defence equipment.The Flag Officer Commander-in-Chief of the navy's Eastern Naval Command John C. DeSilva said \\"INS Kulish, suited for picket duties, would act as an effective sentinel in the Eastern Command in the Indian Maritime zone\\".  Operational history  INS Kulish visited the Shanghai naval base in 2003 as part of a three-vessel fleet, for a five-day official visit. The fleet was commanded by flag officer Rear Admiral R. P. Suthan of India's Eastern Naval Command. It comprised a guided missile destroyer , a fleet tanker and Kulish. The fleet held airborne and surface search and rescue exercises with China's East Sea Fleet, which were code-named Dolphin 0311. Before the joint exercise, the Chinese and Indian ships also conducted maritime communication and formation manoeuvres. These were the first joint naval exercises between China and India. The fleet left Shanghai on 14 November 2003. In May 2010, the navy's Eastern Fleet deployed INS Kulish, along with guided-missile destroyers INS Rana and INS Ranjit and fleet tanker INS Jyoti from Port Blair to South East Asia, where the fleet undertook passage exercises with the navies of Indonesia, Singapore and Australia. The fleet sailed under the command of Flag Officer Commanding, Eastern Fleet, Rear Admiral P N Murugesan and made port calls at Jakarta (Indonesia), Hai Phong (Vietnam), Manila (Philippines), Muara (Brunei), Bangkok (Thailand), Fremantle (Australia), Singapore and Port Kelang (Malaysia). At Port Kelang, the fleet conducted anti-piracy exercises with the Malaysian Navy from 20 to 23 June, and left port on 23 June. INS Kulish participated in the Malabar 2012 exercise with the United States Navy along with destroyers INS Ranvir, INS Ranvijay, frigate INS Satpura and replenishment oiler INS Shakti. The other ships which participated in the exercise included Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 1 of the US Navy, comprising USS Carl Vinson, embarked Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 17, Ticonderoga-class guided- missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Halsey. Military Sealift Command's fast combat support ship USNS Bridge also provided support for the exercise. INS Kulish along with INS Rana participated in the Navy Day celebrations in December 2011 when it was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Rajneesh Dalal. Both the ships hosted more than 1,200 people who came to watch the programme in commemoration of Navy Day. Kulish was part of the seven ships that took part in the programme in commemoration of Navy Day 2013. The other ships included Amphibious transport dock INS Jalashwa, guided missile destroyer INS Ranvijay, frigates INS Satpura, INS Shivalik and corvettes INS Khukri, INS Khanjar. Kulish was part of a seven-ship fleet which represented the Eastern Naval Command at Indian Navy's annual TROPEX exercise, which concluded on 1 March 2013. TROPEX 2013 was a month-long theatre level exercise which was conducted off India's west coast. The navy conducted manoeuvres, weapon firings and tactical evaluation. The other ships in the flotilla were the destroyer INS Rana, amphibious dock INS Jalashwa, corvettes INS Karmuk and INS Sukanya and fleet tanker INS Jyoti, and it was led by INS Ranvijay under the command of Admiral Ajith Kumar P, Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet.

Can the same 21st-century poet do both? In cityscapes, domestic interiors, and briskly ironized variations on inherited language-games, John Stammers' second collection tries, and largely succeeds.

They are Maryland's highest courts of record exercising original jurisdiction at law and in equity in all civil and criminal matters, and have such additional powers and jurisdiction as conferred by the Maryland Constitution of 1867 as amended, or by law.Annotated Code of Maryland, Courts & Judicial Proceedings Article (hereafter \\"CJP\\"), ¬ß1-501. The Circuit Courts also preside over divorce and most family law matters. Probate and estate matters are handled by a separate Orphans' Court. The Circuit Courts are the only Maryland state courts empowered to conduct jury trials. Organization Judicial circuit map Each of Maryland's 23 counties and the independent city of Baltimore has its own Circuit Court. The number of judges on each of the Circuit Courts is set by statute.CJP ¬ß1-503. The Circuit Courts are grouped into eight judicial circuits. Each circuit encompasses two or more counties, except for the Eighth Circuit, which consists solely of Baltimore City.Maryland Constitution, Art. IV, ¬ß19. The most senior judge in the circuit is the Chief Judge; all other judges are Associate Judges.Art. IV, ¬ß21. The state is divided into eight judicial circuits, which are presently as follows: *1st Judicial Circuit (7 judges): Dorchester (1 judge), Somerset (1 judge), Wicomico (3 judges) & Worcester (2 judges) counties *2nd Judicial Circuit (7 judges): Caroline (1 judge), Cecil (3 judges), Kent (1 judge), Queen Anne's (1 judge) & Talbot (1 judge) counties *3rd Judicial Circuit (21 judges): Baltimore County (16 judges) & Harford County (5 judges) *4th Judicial Circuit (7 judges): Allegany (2 judges), Garrett (1 judge) & Washington (4 judges) counties *5th Judicial Circuit (18 judges): Anne Arundel (10 judges), Carroll (3 judges) & Howard (5 judges) counties *6th Judicial Circuit (24 judges): Frederick (4 judges) & Montgomery (20 judges) counties *7th Judicial Circuit (32 judges): Calvert (3 judges), Charles (4 judges), Prince George's (23 judges) & St Mary's (3 judges) counties *8th Judicial Circuit (30 judges): Baltimore City Judges of the Circuit Courts of Maryland are elected to 15-year terms in the general election.Art. IV, ¬ß3. Their salaries may not be diminished while in office.Art. IV, ¬ß24; CJP ¬ß1-701. The Governor may fill vacancies by appointment until the next general election for the United States House of Representatives occurring after one year from the time the vacancy was created, except in cases where the vacancy is by expiration of term, in which case, the vacancy is filled until the next general election for U.S. Representatives (congressmen).Maryland Constitution, Art. IV, ¬ß5. Judges must be at least 30 years old, qualified voters, members of the Maryland bar, and residents both of Maryland for at least five years and for at least 6 months of the place for which they are elected to serve.Art. IV, ¬ß2. Judges must retire at age 70. The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals of Maryland (highest court in state and supreme court of Maryland) may assign a former judge to sit temporarily in any Maryland court, if approved by the administrative judge of the circuit in question.CJP ¬ß1-302. Each Circuit Court also has its own Clerk, who is elected by the citizens of the county (or Baltimore City) to a four- year term.Art. IV, ¬ß25. Jurisdiction In civil matters, the Circuit Courts have exclusive original jurisdiction in most cases in which equitable, declaratory, or injunctive relief is sought, or in which ownership of real property is to be determined. Two notable exceptions are: (1) actions for replevin, in which the District Courts have exclusive original jurisdiction regardless of the value of the thing in controversy;CJP ¬ß4-401(2). and (2) landlord-tenant matters, in which the District Court has exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases.CJP ¬ß4-401(4). In tort or contract cases for money damages where the amount in controversy exceeds $30,000, the Circuit Courts have exclusive original jurisdiction.See CJP ¬ß4-401(1) (defining exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court). The Circuit Courts share concurrent jurisdiction with the District Courts in such cases where the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000 but is less than $30,000.CJP ¬ß4-402(d)(1)(i). However, if the amount in controversy exceeds $15,000, either party may remove an action filed in District Court to the Circuit Court by demanding a jury trial.CJP ¬ß4-402(e); see also Maryland Declaration of Rights, Art. 23. The District Court has exclusive jurisdiction in contract and tort cases for money damages where the amount in controversy is less than $5,000. In criminal cases, the Circuit Courts generally have exclusive original jurisdiction over felonies (with many exceptions).CJP ¬ß4-302(a). They share concurrent original jurisdiction in misdemeanor cases in which the penalty may be confinement for three years or more or a fine of $2,500 or more, and in certain felony cases.CJP ¬ß4-302(d). A criminal defendant may remove the case to Circuit Court by demanding a jury trial in any case in which the defendant is so entitled.CJP ¬ß4-302(e). Dockets By rule, each of the Circuit Courts is required to have a differentiated case management plan \\"for the prompt and efficient scheduling and disposition of actions[.]\\"Maryland Rule 16-202(b)(1). Such plans vary by jurisdiction, but include the classification of cases by complexity and priority, to be assigned to particular scheduling \\"tracks\\" based on that classification. Consistent with applicable court rule, the Circuit Courts have endeavored to make their differentiated case management plans as similar as possible;Maryland Rule 16-202(b)(2). in practice, however, the plans do vary somewhat among the Circuit Courts. One noteworthy aspect of Maryland's differentiated case management system is the introduction of the Business and Technology Case Management Program ‚Äì the first of its kind in the United States ‚Äì for civil cases involving complex business or technology issues. The program includes a special designated \\"track\\" for business and technology cases within Maryland's differentiated case management system; procedures to assign such cases to the program, including special assignment of such cases to judges specially trained in issues concerning business and technology; and alternative dispute resolution proceedings by mediators specially trained in business and technology issues.Maryland Rule 16-308. Such cases may be placed into the program by request of the plaintiff upon filing the case; upon a subsequent request by any of the parties; or by court order. Maryland also permits the parties in civil cases to request assignment of their case to a Complex Science or Medical Case Management Program, which, if granted, results in the case being assigned to a judge who has received training from the Advanced Science and Technology Adjudication Resource Center, Inc. (ASTAR).

Li is known as an advocate of the Chinese New Left and as a Marxian economist.Grassroots political reform in contemporary China. Elizabeth J. Perry, Merle Goldman Biography Li was a student at the Economic Management Department of Beijing University during the period 1987‚Äì90. There he studied and became convinced of neoliberal 'Chicago School' economics. He engaged in many protests of the existing economic system, and engaged in much activism after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Li was arrested after advocating free market principles in 1990, and made a vast switch to become a Marxist after extensive reading of the works of Karl Marx, Mao Zedong, and others while a political prisoner until his release in 1992.Preface: My 1989 to: Li, Minqi. The Rise of China and the Demise of the Capitalist World Economy. Monthly Review Press, 2009. Print. Li spent the next two years traveling in China, debating with remaining liberal dissident activists and conducting his own research into political, economic, and social development in modern China, using fake identification to visit provincial and city libraries. His view became one opposed to the mainstream, being that Mao Zedong's influence was a \\"revolutionary legacy rather than a historical burden for future socialist revolutionaries.\\"Page xvi, Li, Minqi. The Rise of China and the Demise of the Capitalist World Economy. Monthly Review Press, 2009. Print. In 1994, he authored the book Capitalist Development and Class Struggle in China,http://www.econ.utah.edu/~mli/index.htm which consisted of an analysis of the economic development of China in the Maoist era and the 1980s, as well as a Marxist analysis of the 1989 ‚Äúdemocratic movement‚Äù, arguing that it was not a popular democratic movement and was abandoned by the liberal intellectuals, led to the physical and ideological slaughter of the urban working class, and led to a victory of the bureaucratic capitalists. He attempted to show that this paved the way for China's transition to Capitalism. He criticized neoliberal economics and its relation to economic rationality, inherent contradictions between democracy and capitalism, and the social and material conditions that had led to China's rise with a conclusion focusing on a criticism of state-capitalism and advocating democratic socialism.Li, Minqi. \\"CAPITALIST DEVELOPMENT AND CLASS STRUGGLES IN CHINA.\\" 1993-1996. 6 Aug 2009 . After firmly completing a political and intellectual break with the mainstream Chinese liberal tradition and their political counterparts, he established himself as a revolutionary Marxist. Li arrived in the United States on December 25, 1994 and became a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst [B.A. (summa cum laude) Economics University of Delaware (1996)]. Since then, he has been among the foremost promoters of the Chinese \\"New Left.\\"Page xvii, Li, Minqi. The Rise of China and the Demise of the Capitalist World Economy. Monthly Review Press, 2009. Print. Li went on to author many Marxist articles for Monthly Review in this period, notably \\"After Neoliberalism: Empire, Social Democracy, or Socialism?\\". In 2001 Li's focus shifted to World Capitalist Systems, and the work of Immanuel Wallerstein in particular. Inspired by Wallerstein's arguments, he wrote a Chinese article, ‚ÄúReading Wallerstein‚Äôs Capitalist World-Economy‚ÄîAnd the China Question in the First Half of the 21st Century,‚Äù being the first economist to link the \\"rise of China\\" to the demise of capitalism. The article gained popularity among the New Left in China without his knowledge, and was published in Currents of Thought: China‚Äôs New Left and Its Influences which he found by surprise while browsing in a Chinese bookstore in Philadelphia.Page xviii, Li, Minqi. The Rise of China and the Demise of the Capitalist World Economy. Monthly Review Press, 2009. Print. In late 2001 he expanded his study of China in relation to World-Systems in a critique of Jiang Zemin's theory of Chinese social strata (a refutation of Marxist social relations from a Chinese perspective, arguing that China is moving towards a \\"middle-class society\\"), in his ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Class Structure from the World-System‚Äôs Perspective.‚Äù Li argued that China‚Äôs economic rise would in fact greatly destabilize the capitalist world-economy in various ways and contribute to its final demise. Building upon his previous two papers, he wrote ‚ÄúThe Rise of China and the Demise of the Capitalist World-Economy: Historical Possibilities of the 21st Century.‚Äù ‚ÄòThe Rise of China and the Demise of the Capitalist World-Economy: Exploring the Historical Possibilities in the 21st Century,‚Äô Science & Society, 69:3 (2005), pp. 420-448. He then incorporated these and several other papers into his book \\"The Rise of China and the Demise of the Capitalist World-Economy\\" in 2009, in which he argued, based upon an analysis of environmental data in relation to the Capitalist world economy, that the only way to avoid the inevitable collapse of civilization is to adopt a socialist world government by the middle of the 21st century. From 2003 to 2006, he taught graduate and undergraduate courses on political economy at York University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and then went on to teach at the University of Utah, where he currently teaches. He later worked on translation of Ernest Mandel's \\"Power and Money\\" into Chinese with Meng Jie, and was an analyst of Chinese issues in 2008 for The Real News.

This battle group was under the command of Rear Admiral P Ajit Kumar, Flag Officer Commanding, Eastern Naval Command. According to the Ministry of Defence, the two-month deployment, far from India's usual area of operations, along with naval exercises with a number of countries, aimed to demonstrate the Indian navy's operational reach. During the deployment the battle group participated in passage exercises with the navies of the countries visited. The 'Passage Exercises' focussed on maritime security cooperation, which included humanitarian aid & disaster relief (HADR) operations and 'visit, board, search and seizure' (VBSS) drills for anti-piracy operations. These exercises aimed to increase naval inter-operability, enabling the two navies to function together smoothly during possible HADR operations. In addition, during the port visits, the Fleet Commander along with the commanding officers of the ships met high-ranking officials of the Navy, state administration, port management, coastal security organization, police, and other stakeholders of maritime security in the countries visited, to share professional experiences and exchange best practices in areas of mutual interest. = JIMEX 2012 = The ship was deployed in the North West Pacific for JIMEX 2012 (Japan-India Maritime Exercise) with the four ship group, and took part in India's first bi-lateral maritime exercise with Japan.

History In 1990, Golder Associates, an international engineering consulting firm, was asked by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) to develop probabilistic simulation software that could be used to help with decision support and management within the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The results of this effort were two DOS-based programs (RIP and STRIP), which were used to support radioactive waste management projects within the DOE. In 1996, in an effort funded by Golder Associates, the US DOE, the Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute (currently the Japan Atomic Energy Agency) and the Spanish National Radioactive Waste Company (ENRESA), the capabilities of RIP and STRIP were incorporated into a general purpose Windows-based simulator called GoldSim. Subsequent funding was also provided by NASA. Initially only offered to the original funding organizations, GoldSim was released to the public in 2002. In 2004, GoldSim Technology Group LLC was spun off from Golder Associates and is now a wholly independent company.Golder Associates Launches Independent Software Company Based on GoldSim Software (2004), Water & Wastes DIGEST Notable applications include providing the simulation framework for: 1) the Yucca Mountain Repository Performance Assessment model developed by Sandia National Laboratories; 2) a comprehensive system-level computational model for performance assessment of geological sequestration of CO2 developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory; 3) a flood operations model to help better understand and fine tune operations of a large dam used for water supply and flood control in Queensland, Australia; and 4) models for simulating risks associated with future manned space missions by NASA Ames Research Center. Modeling Environment GoldSim provides a visual and hierarchical modeling environment, which allows users to construct models by adding ‚Äúelements‚Äù (model objects) that represent data, equations, processes or events, and linking them together into graphical representations that resemble influence diagrams. Influence arrows are automatically drawn as elements are referenced by other elements. Complex systems can be translated into hierarchical GoldSim models by creating layer of ‚Äúcontainers‚Äù (or sub- models). Visual representations and hierarchical structures help users to build very large, complex models that can still be explained to interested stakeholders (e.g., government regulators, elected officials, and the public). Though it is primarily a continuous simulator, GoldSim has a number of features typically associated with discrete simulators. By combining these two simulation methods, systems that are best represented using both continuous and discrete dynamics can often be more accurately simulated. Examples include tracking the quantity of water in a reservoir that is subject to both continuous inflows and outflows, as well as sudden storm events; and tracking the quantity of fuel in a space vehicle as it is subjected to random perturbations (e.g., component failures, extreme environmental conditions). Because the software was originally developed for complex environmental applications, in which many inputs are uncertain and/or stochastic, in addition to being a dynamic simulator, GoldSim is a Monte Carlo simulator, such that inputs can be defined as distributions and the entire system simulated a large number of times to provide probabilistic outputs.Probabilistic Simulation. GoldSim website. As such, the software incorporates a number of computational features to facilitate probabilistic simulation of complex systems, including tools for generating and correlating stochastic time series, advanced sampling capabilities (including latin hypercube sampling, nested Monte Carlo analysis, and importance sampling), and support for distributed processing.

At its Saxon founding the forerunner settlement was known by an unknown name or as it in Norman times came to be recorded in an established two-part form \\"Beorma's ham\\" (\\"homestead of...\\") or \\"Beorma-inga-ham\\" (\\"homestead of the tribe/people of/related to...\\"). If Beorma, or similar, is probably a relevant personal name as the majority of Anglo-Saxon historians publishing on the subject claim, it has one other known exponent, a different Anglo-Saxon figure who owned another farmstead across the far side of Wessex, that of Barton-on-Sea, Hampshire which appears twice in the Domesday Book, as Bermintune and as Burmintune, directly cognate to the entry for Birmingham. The meaning and linguistic proximity of 'beorn', prince, coupled with the usually personal suffix -ing so correlated by following well-known names in most cases, underpins the leading theory that both places had an eponymous human leader. However few records of such princely names containing the 'm' sound supports a counter-theory of word origin. It points to relative proximity to forests/heath clearings of multi- pointed shrubs, broom (and relatives gorse), as the origin in both cases.Barton-on-Sea History Identity Birmingham in the Domesday Book As the person after whom Birmingham was named, there are three possible answers to the question of exactly who Beorma was. Beorma could have been the founder or ancestor of a tribe, the beormingas, long before its arrival in what was to become Anglo-Saxon Mercia; the ealdorman or head of a tribe or clan of kinsmen who travelled together for the purpose of migration (and who settled in Mercia); or the leader of a (possibly mercenary) group with whom he shared a contractual obligation (the frankpledge) to one of the Mercian kings. Etymology Beorma variously means, in Old English, \\"fermented\\", \\"head of beer\\", \\"yeasty\\" or \\"frothy\\",Beorma at Etymonline.com from which the modern English words barm and barmy are derived.Barm at Reference.com The assertion that Beorma was the founder of Birmingham arose from a post-war challenge to the way Anglo-Saxon place-names had been constructed. It was not until 1940 that Eilert Ekwall noted that: ‚ÄúBirmingham probably meant ‚Äòthe Hamm of Beornmund‚Äôs people‚Äô (OE Beornmund-ingaham). Or the direct base may be a pet- form Beorma from Beornmund‚Äù.Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names, ed. E. K. Ekwall (3rd edition, with revisions 1951) Ekwall's view was built on by J.M. Dodgson J.M. Dodgson The significance of the distribution of the English placenames in \\"-ingas\\", \\"-inga\\" in south-east England, Medieval Archaeology 10 (1966) who went on to suggest that ‚Äìingaham settlements like Birmingham and Nottingham were signs of earlier settlement than ‚Äìing settlements like Reading and Hastings, reinforcing the idea that Birmingham itself was preceded by a tribal territory occupied by the Beormingas. According to Tom ShippeyTom Shippey, Roots and Branches - Selected Papers on Tolkien, Walking Tree Publishers, 2007 J.R.R. Tolkien went on to use the character of Beorn in The Hobbit to evoke links between elfland and the counties surrounding Birmingham. Alternative names As no records of the place-name exist from the Anglo-Saxon period, only the entry for Bermingham in the Domesday Book of 1086 Beorma is the most often imputed form of the name of the founder of Birmingham. A number of alternative names have been put forward (including Bearm, Berm, Beor, Bearma, Beorm and Breme), based on the fact that the city's name has been spelled in many different ways throughout its history. Just as the other names have been put forward for the founder of Birmingham, this name may share its origins with similar Anglo-Saxon place namesBarton, Bearwood, Berwood, Bordesley, Brewood, and Burcot‚Äîall found within the environs of Birmingham. The high incidence of these place names has been used to suggest that Beorma's tribe, the beormingas, settled across the wider woodland area which formed the northern part of the Forest of Arden. Breme or Brom The second most common name associated with the origin of Birmingham is Breme or Brom, which could be a given name, but whose meaning is derived from the spiky shrub ‚Äòbroom‚Äô (which was commonly found in the woodland clearings of the Forest of Arden) rather than with a given name. Birmingham has also been known as Bromwycham,William Hutton, Project Gutenberg's An History of Birmingham (1783) and nearby towns with a similar etymology include Bromford, Little Bromwich, West Bromwich, Bromsgrove, Broomhill and several Bromleys scattered across Staffordshire and Warwickshire. By the 14th century there were so many English place-names prefixed by Brom- that differentiating names (such as Abbots Bromley, originally referred to as Bromleage in 1002 and Kings Bromley, originally known as Brom Legge) were adopted. Beorma and the B-Line If Beorma is a diminutive of Beornmund (Beorn = 'prince'; Mund = 'hand') then the name would mean either \\"Princely protector\\" or \\"the Prince's hand\\".Ekwall, E. (1940) The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names; 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 43 This interpretation would suggest that Beorma was a royal name, or else the name of a king's thegn. A royal connection for the founder of an early tribe whose territory is adjacent to that of the founders of Mercia draws attention to its similarity between the names Beornmund or Beorma and those of the alleged B-line of Mercian kings noted by Dr. Barbara YorkeDr. Barbara Yorke (Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England (B.A. Seaby Ltd, 1990), p. 119) that included Beornred, Beornwulf, Beorhtwulf and Burgred. Beorma in recent times Image of Beowulf Brewery's Beorma Beer Label Unlike the alternative suggestions, the name Beorma has been used to establish and promote links with the city of Birmingham on a number of occasions, evolving from an academic assumption about an etymological source into an established character, albeit mythical, which has come to symbolise Birmingham's Anglo-Saxon foundation. =Arch of the Beorma Tribe= In 2002 Birmingham's medieval history was commemorated by the placement of a set of ornate rolled steel memorial arches located in Gooch Street on a bridge over the River Rea in the suburb of Highgate by artist Steve Field,Archway home to Brum rootsC.P. Belcher Ltd which reflect upon the foundation of the city and on modern Highgate's local identity. The memorial says \\"near this river crossing an Anglian tribe led by Beorma founded Birmingham\\". =Beowulf Brewery= A micro-brewery founded in the city's Yardley suburb in 1996 (and relocated to Chasewater in 2003), the Beowulf Brewing Company established a series of Anglo-Saxon brands for its beers, most of which had thematic links to the legend of Beowulf. One of these beers - a pale session bitter - was instead named after Beorma to commemorate the city in which the brewery was founded. The Brewery's connection to the wider area has also been incorporated into its brand by referencing the Forest of Mercia. =Beorma Bar= The current name of the first floor bar at the University of Birmingham Guild of Students is Beorma BarBirmingham Guild of Students following its refurbishment in 2000. It had previously been called The Mermaid Bar and Fingal's. =Beorma Finishings= In 2020, Beorma Finishings Ltd was established to spread the need for excellence in the commercial and domestic plastering sector. Beormas' Company Director, Reve Gardener chose to include 'Boerma' in the company name because of his strong personal connection and heritage to Birmingham. Having, worked in the industry for over 9 years he believes that ‚Äúclient satisfaction is at the heart of all his company does, and has pride in delivering high standards of quality workmanship to give his clients the best possible finishes.‚Äù =Beorma Quarter= The \\"Beorma Quarter\\" is planned for construction from 2010 onwards, as a multimillion-pound 30-storey city-within-a-city development on a site at the end of Digbeth High Street, directly opposite Birmingham's already iconic Selfridges building (it will occupy the site of the city's last seven burgage plots e-architect). Complete with state-of-the-art environmental and energy systems, the final development is likely to consist of a Marriott Hotel, apartments, green spaces, a niche shopping centre, a public space originally intended to house Birmingham's historic John F. Kennedy memorial and two refurbished cold storage buildings which will be redeveloped as creative industries business incubation and innovation hubs. =Literary, artistic and musical works= ;Toccata Beorma In 1972, following the receipt of his honorary doctorate from the University of Birmingham, broadcaster and Birmingham City Organist George Thalben-Ball wrote ‚ÄòToccata Beorma‚Äô as a celebration of his links with the city.http://www.simonlindley.org.uk/the_civic_organist.html The Civic Organist ;Tribe of Beorma In 2000 the Women & Theatre company embarked on a national tour to celebrate the millennium by performing a new musical play, Tribe of Beorma, by Janice Connolly.Arts ArchiveWomen & Theatre ;What is Missing from your Life?

In the 16th century, the history of Bali started to be marked by Western influence with the arrival of Europeans, to become, after a long and difficult colonial period under the Dutch, an example of the preservation of traditional cultures and a key tourist destination. Geological formation The Tertiary limestone cliffs of Uluwatu were lifted from the sea floor by subduction. The island of Bali, like most of the islands of the Indonesian archipelago, is the result of the tectonic subduction of the Indo-Australian plate under the Eurasian plate. The tertiary ocean floor, made of ancient marine deposits including accumulation of coral reefs, was lifted above the sea level by the subduction. Layers of Tertiary limestone lifted from the ocean floor are still visible in areas such as the Bukit peninsula with the huge limestone cliffs of Uluwatu, or in the northwest of the island at Prapat Agung. The local deformation of the Eurasian plate created by the subduction has encouraged the fissuring of the crust, leading to the appearance of volcanic phenomena. A string of volcanoes line the northern part of the island, in west‚Äìeast axis along which the western part is oldest, and the eastern part newest. The highest volcano is the active strato-volcano Mount Agung, at 3,142 m (10,308 ft). Volcanic activity has been intense through the ages, and most of the surface of the island (outside of the Bukit Peninsula and Prapat Agung) has been covered by volcanic magma. Some old deposits remain (older than 1 million years), while most of the central part of the island is covered by young volcanic deposits (less than 1 million years), with some very recent lava fields in the northeast due to the catastrophic eruption of Mount Agung in 1963. Volcanic activity, due to the thick deposits of ashes and the soil fertility it generates, has also been a strong factor in the agricultural prosperity of the island. At the edge of the subduction, Bali is also at the edge of the continental Sunda shelf, just west of the Wallace line, and was at one time connected to the neighbouring island of Java, particularly during the lowering of the sea level in the Ice Ages. Its fauna and flora are therefore Asian. Paleolithic and Mesolithic occupation Bali being part of the Sunda shelf, the island had been connected to the island of Java many times through history. Even today, the two islands are only separated by a 2.4 km Bali Strait. The ancient occupation of Java itself is accredited by the findings of the Java man, dated between 1.7 and 0.7 million years old, one of the first known specimens of Homo erectus. Bali also was inhabited in Paleolithic times (1 my BCE to 200,000 BCE), testified by the finding of ancient tools such as hand axes were found in Sembiran and Trunyan villages in Bali.Bali Museum notice A Mesolithic period (200,000-30,000 BCE) has also been identified, characterized by advanced food gathering and hunting, but still by Homo Erectus.http://science.sciencemag.org/content/279/5357/1635.full?ck=nck This period yields more sophisticated tools, such as arrow points, and also tools made of animal or fish bones. They lived in temporary caves, such as those found in the Pecatu hills of the Badung regency, such as the Selanding and the Karang Boma caves. The first wave of Homo Sapiens arrived around 45,000 BCE as the Australoid people migrated south, replacing Homo Erectus. File:Java Man.jpgJava man reconstitution. File:Mesolithic arrow point Bali.jpgMesolithic arrow point, Bali Museum Neolithic: Austronesian migrations (3000-600 BCE) Neolithic stone sarcophagus, Bali Museum. From around 3000 to 600 BCE, a Neolithic culture emerges, characterized by a new wave of inhabitants bringing rice-growing technology and speaking Austronesian languages. These Austronesian peoples seem to have migrated from South China, probably through the Philippines and Sulawesi. Their tools included rectangular adzes and red slipped decorated pottery. Forests and jungles were cleared for the establishment of cultures and villages. They also made some plaited craft and a small boat was also found. Their culinary habits included pork-eating and betel-chewing. They are thought to have focused on mountain cults. They buried some of their more prestigious dead in oval stone sarcophagi, with human heads or zoomorphic figures sculpted on them. The bodies were either deposited in the sleeping position, or folded in two or three for compactness. An important neolithic archaeological site in Bali is that of Cekik, in the western part of the island. These same Austronesian people are thought to have continued their expansion eastward, to occupy Melanesian and Polynesian islands around 2000 years ago. The cultural traits of this period are still clearly visible in the culture of Bali today, and connect it to the cultures of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean.

A Bronze Age period follows, from around 600 BCE to 800 CE. Between the 8th and 3rd century BCE, the island of Bali acquired the \\"Dong Son\\" metallurgical techniques spreading from Northern Vietnam. These techniques involved sophisticated casting from moulds, with spiral and anthropomorphic motifs. As mould fragments have been found in the area of Manuaba in Bali, it is thought that such implements were manufactured locally rather than imported. The raw material to make bronze (copper and tin) had to be imported however, as it is not available on Bali. Numerous bronze tools and weapons were made (axes, cooking tools, jewellery), and ceremonial drums from that period are also found in abundance, such as the \\"Moon of Pejeng\\", the largest ceremonial drum yet found in Southeast Asia, dated to around 300 BCE. The stone sarcophagi were still in use during that period, as bronze artefacts were also found in them.

Ancient historical period: Indianized kingdoms (800-1343 CE) Buddha Manjucri from Goa Gajah cave, Bali. The ancient historical period is defined by the appearance of the first written records in Bali, in the form of clay pallets with Buddhist inscriptions. These Buddhist inscriptions, found in small clay stupa figurines (called \\"stupikas\\") are the first known written inscriptions in Bali and date from around the 8th century CE. Such stupikas have been found in the regency of Gianyar, in the villages of Pejeng, Tatiapi and Blahbatuh. This period is generally closely associated with the arrival and expansion of Buddhism and Hinduism in the island of Bali. The Belanjong pillar (\\"Prasasti Blanjong\\") in southern Sanur was inscribed in 914 with the mention of the reign of the Balinese king Sri Kesari. It is written in both the Indian Sanskrit language and Old Balinese language, using two scripts, the Nagari script and the Old Balinese script (which is used to write both Balinese and Sanskrit). It is dated 4 February 914 CE according to the Indian Shaka calendar.Louis-Charles Damais (1959) \\"Ouvrages d'√âtudes Indon√©siennes\\", Bulletin d'√âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient, 49, 2, pp. 685-686. The stone temple of Goa Gajah was made around the same period, and shows a combination of Buddhist and Hindu (Shivaite) iconography. Inter-marriages between Java and Bali royalty also occurred, as when king Udayana Warmadewa of the Warmadewa dynasty of Bali married a Javanese princess, sister of the Emperor of Java Dharmawangsa. Their son became the great ruler of East Java Airlangga, who ruled on both Java and Bali. In the 12th century, descendant of Airlangga are also known to have ruled over Bali, such as Jayasakti (1146‚Äì50) and Jayapangus (1178‚Äì81). The island of Java again started to encroach significantly on Bali with the invasion of the Singhasari king Kertanegara in 1284, as reported in the Nagarakertagama (canto 42, stanza 1). Contacts with China were also important during this period. Chinese coins, called Kepeng were in use in Bali from the 7th century. The traditional Barong is also thought to be derived from the Chinese depiction of a lion. According to recent Balinese legends, the 12th-century king Jayapangus of Bali is said to have married a Chinese princess.

Middle historical period: Majapahit dynastic rule (1343-1846) =Majapahit Golden Age= Depiction of Acintya as radiating sun god, on the back of an empty Padmasana throne, Jimbaran, Bali. The Majapahit Empire rule over Bali became complete when Gajah Mada, Prime Minister of the Javanese king, defeated the Balinese king in Bedulu in 1343. The Majapahit capital in Bali was established at Samprangan and later Gelgel. Gelgel remained the paramount kingdom on Bali until the second half of the 17th century. The rule of the Majapahit marks the strong influx of Javanese culture into Bali, most of all in architecture, dance and the theatre, in literature with the introduction of the Kawi script, in painting and sculpture and the wayang puppet theatre. The few Balinese who did not adopt this culture are still known today as \\"Bali Aga\\" (\\"Original Balinese\\") and still live in a few isolated villages. With the rise of Islam in the Indonesian archipelago, the Majapahit empire finally fell, and Bali became independent at the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th century. According to some myth the Javanese aristocracy fled to Bali, bringing an even stronger influx of Hindu arts, literature and religion. According to later chronicles the dynasty of Majapahit origins, established after 1343, continued to rule Bali for 5 more centuries until 1908, when the Dutch eliminated it in the Dutch intervention in Bali (1908). In the 16th century, the Balinese king Dalem Baturenggong even expanded in turn his rule to East Java, Lombok and western Sumbawa. Around 1540, together with the Islamic advance, a Hindu reformation movement took place, led by Dang Hyang Nirartha, leading to the introduction of the Padmasana shrine in honour of the \\"Supreme God\\" Acintya, and the establishment of the present shape of Shiva-worshipping in Bali. Nirartha also established numerous temples, including the spectacular temple at Uluwatu. File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpgPura Maospahit (\\"Majapahit Temple\\") was established during the period of the Majapahit Empire. =European contacts= The \\"Bali fleet\\" of Cornelis de Houtman, leaving Amsterdam. The first direct or indirect news of Bali by some European travelers can be traced back to Marco Polo and other possible travelers and traders via the Mediterranean Sea and Asia. The first known European contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio Abreu and Francisco Serr√£o reached its northern coast. It was the first expedition of a series of biannual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition. \\"...passing the island of 'Balle', on whose heights the nau Sabaia, of Francisco Serr√£o, was lost. ..\\" - from Antonio de Abreu, and in Jo√£o de Barros and Antonio Galv√£o (D√©cadas da √Åsia). https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&pg;=PA288&q;=bali+Antonio+de+Abreu+Francisco+Serr%C3%A3o The Magellan expedition (1519‚Äì1522), through Elcano, is thought to have possibly sighted the island, and early Portuguese and Spanish charts mention the island under various names such as Boly, Bale and Bally. Sir Francis Drake briefly visited the island in 1580. In 1585, the Portuguese government in Malacca sent a ship to establish a fort and a trading post in Bali, but the ship foundered on the reef of the Bukit peninsula and only five survivors could make it ashore. They went into the service of the king of Gelgel, known as the Dalem, and were provided with wives and homes. In 1597, the Dutch explorer Cornelis de Houtman arrived in Bali with 89 surviving men (out of 249 who had departed). After visits to Kuta and Jembrana, he assembled his fleet in Padang Bai. Enthusiastic, he christened the island \\"Young Holland\\" (Jonck Hollandt). They were able to meet with the Dalem, who produced for them one of the Portuguese who had been in his service since 1585, Pedro de Noronha. A second Dutch expedition appeared in 1601, that of Jacob van Heemskerck. On this occasion, the Dalem of Gelgel sent a letter to Prince Maurits, a translation of which was sent by Cornelis van Eemskerck. This letter was subsequently used by the Dutch in their claims to the island: File:Balinese king in Houtman Verhael vande Reyse Naer Oost Indien 1597.jpgDescription of the Balinese king, the Dalem, pulled by two white buffaloes, in Houtman's 1597 Verhael vande Reyse ...

Slave and opium trade Batavia circa 1700, from Cornelis de Bruijn's Voyages de Corneille le Brun..., 1718. Dutch records of contacts with Bali in the 17th and 18th century are extremely scarce. Although the VOC was very active in the Maluku Islands, Java and Sumatra, it took little interest in Bali. The opening of a trading post was attempted in 1620, with the mission given to the First Merchant Hans van Meldert to purchase \\"rice, beasts, provisions, and women\\". The enterprise was abandoned in the face of hostile relations with the kings of Bali, and Meldert returned with only 14 female slaves. Besides these attempts, the VOC left the Bali trade to private traders, mainly Chinese, Arab, Bugis and occasionally Dutch, who mainly dealt with opium and slave trade. According to Hanna, \\"Balinese slaves were highly prized both in Bali and overseas. Balinese male slaves were famous for their manual skills and their courage, the females for their beauty and artistic attainments\\".The kings of Bali would typically sell as slaves opponents, debtors, criminals or even orphans or widows. Such slaves would be used in Batavian households, the Dutch Colonial Army, or sent abroad, the biggest market being French Mauritius. Payment to the Balinese kings would usually be made in opium. The main port for this trade was the harbour of Buleleng in north Bali.The English also started to make various attempts to participate in the Balinese trade, to the great worry of the Dutch. Local conflicts Attempts were made for alliances between the Dutch and the Balinese in their conflicts with the Mataram Sultanate of Java. In 1633, the Dutch, who were themselves at war with Mataram sent an ambassador, Van Oosterwijck, to obtain the collaboration of the King of Bali in Gelgel, who was apparently preparing a similar offensive against Mataram. The attempt failed however. When Mataram invaded Bali in 1639, Dewa Agung requested Dutch help in vain, and finally succeeded in repelling Mataram alone. After 1651 the Gelgel kingdom began to break up due to internal conflicts. In 1686 a new royal seat was established in Klungkung, four kilometers north of Gelgel. The rulers of Klungkung, known by the title Dewa Agung, were however unable to maintain power over Bali. The island was in fact split in nine minor kingdoms (Klungkung, Buleleng, Karangasem, Mengwi, Badung, Tabanan, Gianyar, Bangli, Jembrana). The various kingdoms fought a succession of wars among themselves, although they accorded the Dewa Agung a symbolic paramount status. This situation lasted until the coming of the Dutch in the 19th century. Franco-Dutch alliance with Bali (1808) Herman Willem Daendels signed a Franco-Dutch alliance with the Balinese king of Badung in 1808. For a brief period, in 1806‚Äì1815, the Netherlands became a province of France, and Bali was thus in contact with a Franco-Dutch administration. Napoleon handpicked a new Governor-General, the \\"Iron Marshall\\" Willem Daendels, sent ships and troops to reinforce the East Indies against British attacks, and had military fortifications built through the length of Java. A treaty of alliance was signed in 1808 between the new administration and the Balinese king of Badung, to provide workers and soldiers for the Franco-Dutch defensive effort, but Java fell to the British in 1811, and the agreement was not implemented. Conflict with Great Britain (1814) During the British occupation of the East Indies by Stamford Raffles (which lasted from 1811 until 1816, right after the fall of the Napoleonic Empire), the British made fruitless advances to the Balinese kings. Raffles' abolition of slavery on the contrary triggered the indignation of the Rajas of Buleleng and Karangasem, who sent a military expedition against Blambangan, where they fought British Sepoys in February 1814. In May, Raffles sent an expeditionary force to Bali under Major General Nightingale to obtain assurances of \\"submission\\".> Raffles himself visited the island in 1815. Return of the Netherlands (1816) The British returned the East Indies to the Netherlands in 1816. After that, the Dutch endeavoured to reassert and reinforce their control over their colonial possessions. This would open the way to a much more assertive Dutch presence in the East Indies and Bali. Raffles, still looking for an island to colonize, finally settled on Singapore. A first special commissioner named H.A. van der Broek was sent to sign \\"concept contracts\\" with the Balinese kings, which the kings did not accept, but became quasi-valid in the mind of the Dutch. Meanwhile, a few European traders managed to act as intermediaries between Bali and Europe, such as the Danish merchant Mads Lange, nicknamed the \\"White king of Bali\\".

File:Balinese Raja in Thomas Stamford Raffes The History of Java 1817.jpgBalinese Raja, in Thomas Stamford Raffles's The History of Java, 1817 Modern historical period (1846-present) Dutch colonial control expanded across the Indonesian archipelago in the nineteenth century, to become the Dutch East Indies. In Bali, the Dutch used the pretext of eradicating opium smuggling, arms running, plunder of shipwrecks, and slavery to impose their control on Balinese kingdoms. = Northern Bali campaigns (1846-49) = The Raja of Buleleng killing himself with 400 followers, in an 1849 puputan against the Dutch. Le Petit Journal, 1849. A series of three military expeditions occurred between 1846 and 1849; the first two were initially countered successfully by Jelantik. The \\"kingdoms of Buleleng and Bangli waged continuous disputes, and in 1849 Bangli assisted the Dutch in their military expedition against Buleleng\\", permitted the Dutch to take control of the northern Bali kingdoms of Buleleng and Jembrana. The king of Buleleng and his retinue killed themselves in a mass ritual suicide, called a puputan, which was also a hallmark of the subsequent Dutch military interventions. = Colonial administration = Subsequently, the Dutch established a colonial administration in northern Bali. They nominated a member of the royal family as regent, and attached to him a Dutch Controller. The first resident Controller was Heer van Bloemen Waanders, who arrived in Singaraja on 12 August 1855. His main reforms included the introduction of vaccination, the banning of self-sacrifice or suttee, the eradication of slavery, the improvement of the irrigation system, the development of coffee production as a cash crop, the construction of roads, bridges and port facilities for improved commerce and communication. The Dutch also drastically revamped and increased the tax revenues from the people and from commerce, especially of opium. By the mid-1870, Buleleng was visited by 125 European-style ships annually, and another 1,000 local ships. Christianization was attempted but proved a total failure. Uprising occurred, necessitating further Dutch intervention. In 1858, the Balinese nobleman Njoman Gempol raised a rebellion by claiming that the Dutch were exploiting Java. A fourth military expedition was sent in 1858 with 12 officers and 707 infantrymen and eliminated the rebellion, sentencing Njoman Gempol to exile in Java. Another rebellion was led by Ida Mahe Rai against which was sent a fifth military expedition in 1868, consisting of 800 men under Major van Heemskerk. Initially unsuccessful, the expedition was reinforced by 700 men and a new commander, Colonel de Brabant, and prevailed with only two officers and 10 soldiers killed. = Lombok and Karangasem campaign (1894) = Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem against the Balinese in 1894. In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control. A war of the Rajas between 1884 and 1894 gave another pretext to the Dutch to intervene. In 1894, the Dutch defeated the Balinese ruler of Lombok, adding both Lombok and Karangasem to their possessions. = Southern Bali campaigns (1906-08) = Balinese corpses at Denpasar in the Dutch intervention in Bali (1906). A few years later, with the pretext of stopping the plundering of shipwrecks, the Dutch mounted large naval and ground assaults at the Sanur region in 1906 in the Dutch intervention in Bali (1906), leading to the elimination of the royal house of Badung and about 1000 deaths. In the Dutch intervention in Bali (1908), a similar massacre occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in Klungkung, sealing the end of the Majapahit dynasty which had ruled the island, and the total rule of the Dutch over Bali. Afterwards the Dutch governors were able to exercise administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture was generally left intact. The Dutch military interventions however were followed closely by the western press which supplied a steady stream of reports of the violent, bloody conquest of the southern part of the island. The disproportion between the offense and harshness of the punitive actions was pointed out. The image of the Netherlands as a benevolent and responsible colonial power were seriously affected as a consequence. The Netherlands, also under criticism for their policies in Java, Sumatra and the eastern island, decided to make amends, and announced the establishment of an \\"Ethical policy\\". As a consequence, the Dutch in Bali turned students and protectors of Balinese culture and endeavoured to preserve it in addition to their initial modernization role. Efforts were made at preserving Bali culture and at making it a \\"living museum\\" of classical culture, and in 1914, Bali was opened to tourism. In the 1930s, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and artists Miguel Covarrubias and Walter Spies, and musicologist Colin McPhee created a western image of Bali as \\"an enchanted land of aesthetes at peace with themselves and nature\\", and western tourism first developed on the island.

Maps of Balinese kingdoms during the National Revolution Imperial Japan occupied Bali during World War II with the declared objective of forming a \\"Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere\\" that would liberate Asian countries from Western domination. Future rulers such as Sukarno were brought forward by the Japanese. Sukarno famously said: \\"The Lord be praised, God showed me the way; in that valley of the Ngarai I said: Yes, Independent Indonesia can only be achieved with Dai Nippon...For the first time in all my life, I saw myself in the mirror of Asia\\". The harshness of war requisitions made Japanese rule more resented than Dutch rule. Most of all, independence was strongly desired among the populace. Following Japan's Pacific surrender in August 1945, the Balinese took over the Japanese weapons. The following month Bali was liberated by the British and Indian 5th infantry Division under the command of Major-General Robert Mansergh who took the Japanese surrender. Once the Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year. The Dutch with their return to Indonesia reinstated their pre-war colonial administration. One Balinese, Colonel Gusti Ngurah Rai, formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. Colonel I Gusti Ngurah Rai, by then 29 years old, rallied his forces in east Bali at Marga Rana, where they were trapped by heavily armed Dutch troops. On 20 November 1946, in the Battle of Margarana, the Balinese battalion was entirely wiped out, breaking the last thread of Balinese military resistance. In 1946 the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed State of East Indonesia, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia which was proclaimed and headed by Sukarno and Hatta. Bali was included in the United States of Indonesia when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949. The first governor of Bali, Anak Agung Bagus Suteja, was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province. =Post Indonesian independence= The 1963 eruption of Mount Agung killed thousands, created economic havoc and forced many displaced Balinese to be transmigrated to different parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional caste system, and those rejecting these traditional values. Politically, this was represented by opposing supporters of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs. An attempted coup in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto. The army became the dominant power as it instigated a violent anti-communist purge, in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population. With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper- caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members. As a result of the 1965-66 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno out of the presidency, and his \\"New Order\\" government re-established relations with western countries. Balinese dancers show for tourists, Ubud. The pre-War Bali as \\"paradise\\" was revived in a modern form, and the resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country. Rather than destroy Bali's culture, \\"in Bali's case, tourism has helped to reinforce a separate sense of Balinese identity, and given Balinese players in Indonesian society the means by which to support their island's idea of uniqueness\\". In 1999, about 30,000 hotel rooms were available for tourists.Bali and Lombok, p.51 As of 2004, the island achieves over 1,000,000 visitors per year, versus an initial \\"planned\\" level of 500,000 visitors, leading to overdevelopment and environmental deterioration: \\"The result has been polluted and eroded beaches, shortages of water, and a deterioration \\"of the quality of life of most Balinese\\". Political trouble has also affected the island, as the bombing in 2002 by militant Islamists in the tourist area of Kuta killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and another in 2005, severely affected tourism, bringing much economic hardship to the island. Professor Adrian Vickers wrote in 2004 that \\"the challenge of the twenty-first century will be to restore tourism while making Bali livable\\". Tourism has strongly picked up again, with a 28% increase in the first quarter of 2008 with 446,000 arrivals. By the end of 2008, tourism in Bali had fully recovered, with more than 2 million visitors, but the long term livability of Bali, plagued with overdevelopment and traffic jams, remains an issue.

Company information V&R; Planning was founded in April 1986 by Kaoru Adachi (ÂÆâÈÅî„Åã„Åä„Çã) who had previously worked in TV, mostly as an import agent. The V&R; stands for \\"Visual and Retail\\". This was a period when the VCR was becoming widely available in Japan and home viewing of movies became possible. Several other Japanese AV studios were founded about this same time including h.m.p., CineMagic, Crystal-Eizou and Alice Japan. The company started small with just two employees in a one-room Tokyo apartment and even two years later when director Company Matsuo joined the firm, he was only the fourth employee. By March 1991 V&R; had moved into its own building in Tokyo's Setagaya ward and the company incorporated in May 1991. In October 1991 director Yamashita Bakushishi („Éê„ÇØ„Ç∑„Éº„Ç∑Â±±‰∏ã) joined V&R; and started producing simulated rape videos which drew the ire of feminist groups and censors. V&R; Planning had joined the voluntary censorship group Nihon Ethics of Video Association (NEVA) in May 1986 but after some of Bakushishi's videos were rejected by NEVA, V&R; withdrew from membership in the organization in March 1993. Bakushishi left the company in 1996. The most recent financial figures for V&R; Planning list show a capital of 10 million yen (about $100,000) and sales revenue of 700 million yen (about $7 million). Head of the company is Susumu Saegusa (‰∏âÊûù ÈÄ≤), the real name of founder and director Kaoru Adachi. Former director Company Matsuo describes the firm as a middle-sized company in the AV world and \\"definitely one of the weirdest\\". He jokes that V&R; does not stand for \\"Violence and Rape\\" as many people think. As with other AV companies, V&R; has made use of the internet for advertisement and sales. In 2003, managing director Machiki Katsumi estimated that 10% of the company income came from the internet and expected that this would become \\"a crucial part of this business\\". =Documentaries= V&R; Planning doesn't only make AV - from the beginning founder Kaoru Adachi was also making documentaries. Adachi was interested in death videos and V&R; distributed the Japanese versions of the US Faces of Death as Janku or Junk. About 1989, the company sent director Company Matsuo and a cameraman to Brazil to film death scenes for V&R;'s continuation of the Junk series. A 2001 documentary Orozco the Embalmer co-produced by V&R; focused on a Colombian embalmer. The company also produced porn director Katsuyuki Hirano's trilogy of bike-trip films. The first, Yumika, about a trip with AV Idol Yumika Hayashi, was released in 1997, followed by Encyclopedia of a Drifter (Nagaremono zukan) in 1998, and the series was completed by the award-winning 1999 account of a solo bike ride to the northern tip of Hokkaido in the midst of a blizzard, Shiro - The White. =V&R; International= V&R; International was formed as a subsidiary company in August 2001 with headquarters in S√£o Paulo, Brazil to bring Japanese AV to the international market. Since it is not located in Japan, V&R; International is able to offer uncensored versions of V&R; products (which do not have the mosaic pixelation to obscure the genitals mandated by Japanese law) to countries outside Japan. In the United States, its products are released through the Oriental Dream label. In January 2009, V&R; International opened the website CRAZY JAPAN with a motto of \\"The best of Japanese hentai at your fingertips\\". The site provides Pay-per-view (PPV) streaming video of \\"extreme Japanese porn\\" including \\"amateur, scat, S&M;, gay, as well as the unique Japanese phenomenon 'chikan', the art of groping young girls on crowded trains and buses\\". =V&R; Products= was created as a V&R; Planning subsidiary in August 2004 by a group of V&R; Planning directors, Shingo Takemoto, Temple Suwa, Taro Kanbe and Uzumaki Sasaki who wanted more freedom of expression and the chance to pursue a less extreme course than the usual V&R; Planning genres. Shingo Takemoto was the president of the new company which distributed its products through porn conglomerate Soft On Demand. In a review of one of their videos in 2006, the studio was described as another AV producer making \\"strange and funny genre videos like Soft On Demand\\". But in 2007 when V&R; Products asked for full independence, the parent company balked and Takemoto and the rest of the original staff were removed.

Forming out of a tropical low on 17 April 1989, Orson gradually intensified as it tracked towards the west. After attaining Category 5 intensity on 20 April, the storm began to track southward and accelerated. The following day, the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 250 km/h (155 mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 904 hPa (mbar). Orson maintained this intensity for nearly two days before making landfall near Dampier. The cyclone rapidly weakened after landfall as it accelerated to the southeast. After moving into the Great Australian Bight on 24 April, the storm dissipated. Despite Orson's extreme intensity, damage was relatively minimal as it struck a sparsely populated region of Western Australia. Five people were killed offshore and damages amounted to (). The storm damaged a new gas platform, delaying the project for nearly two weeks. The most severe impacts took place in Pannawonica, where 70 homes were damaged. Following the storm, cleanup costs reached A$5 million (US$4.1 million). Due to the severity of the storm, the name Orson was retired after the season. Meteorological history Cyclone Orson originated out of a tropical low, monitored by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, that formed northwest of Darwin, Australia on 17 April 1989. The system tracked southwest throughout the day before turning due west and strengthening into a tropical cyclone, at which time it received the name Orson. At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began monitoring the storm as Tropical Storm 28S. The forward motion of the storm gradually slowed as it intensified and on 19 April, Orson attained Category 3 status on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, classifying Orson as a severe tropical cyclone. Later that day, as the storm attained Category 4 status, an eye developed. By this time, Orson began to turn towards the southwest and on 20 April, the storm intensified into a Category 5 cyclone with winds of 210 km/h (130 mph 10-minute sustained). The JTWC also reported significant strengthening during the same period. They assessed Orson to have attained an intensity equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale on 22 April with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph 1-minute sustained). Around this time, the storm tracked directly over the North Rankin gas platform. The platform was in the 40 km (25 mi) wide eye of Orson for roughly 40 minutes. A weather station there recorded a barometric pressure of 904 hPa (mbar; 26.69 inHg) and wind gusts of 250 km/h (155 mph) before the station was damaged. This was, at the time, the lowest pressure ever recorded in the Australian region since records began. It was later surpassed by Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 when that storm attained a pressure of 900 hPa (mbar). By this time, Cyclone Orson was roughly 555 km (345 mi) in diameter. alt=A mature cyclone over the eastern Indian Ocean near Australia. The storm is matured with a large area of deep thunderstorms and a well-defined eye. Western Australia can be seen in the bottom right of the image and some of the Indonesian islands can be seen at the top. Continuing on a southerly track, accelerating ahead of an approaching cold front, Cyclone Orson made landfall, near Dampier, around 4:45 am AWST on 23 April (2045 UTC 22 April). with winds of 220 km/h (140 mph 10-minute sustained). The JTWC also reported that Orson had weakened, with winds at landfall estimated at 230 km/h (145 mph 1-minute sustained). Tracking at 28 km/h (17 mph), the weakening storm passed over Pannawonica. Less than 12 hours after landfall, the storm weakened below Category 3 status. By this time, the JTWC was no longer monitoring the system. Around 5:00 am AWST on 24 April (2100 UTC 23 April), Orson weakened to a tropical low while situated over southern Western Australia. Continuing to accelerate to nearly 50 km/h (31 mph), the remnants of the storm moved over the Great Australian Bight late on 24 April. Several hours after moving back over water, the storm dissipated. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one-minute sustained winds. The conversion factor between the two is 1.14. The Bureau of Meteorology's peak intensity for Orson was 250 km/h (155 mph) 10-minute sustained, or 290 km/h (180 mph) one- minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Orson was 260 km/h (160 mph) one-minute sustained, or 220 km/h (140 mph) 10-minute sustained. Preparations and impact As Cyclone Orson approached the coast of Western Australia, residents were urged to prepare for the storm; people proceeded to clean up litter, secure outdoor items and make sure their disaster kits were stocked. All 200 personnel from a A$1.5 billion gas platform off the coast were evacuated ahead of the storm. (Accessed via Lexis-Nexis) Since Cyclone Orson made landfall in a sparsely populated region, its effects were relatively light compared to its intensity. More than 20 fishermen were reported missing during the storm. On 23 April, a rescue mission with three aircraft recovered roughly 20 fisherman, while one was still missing. Offshore, the storm killed four Indonesian fishermen after their ships sank in swells up to produced by the storm. The North Rankin gas platform sustained minor damage despite wind gusts reaching 270 km/h (165 mph) and waves estimated at .Christopher C. Burt and Mark Stroud Extreme Weather p. 219 The large swells also delayed the find of a major oil field that contained more than of oil. The waves knocked a drill rig used to find oil out of position; it would take several days for the drill rig to be repositioned. After an assessment of damage, it was found that the drill rig snapped off and broke the chains of two anchors before drifting nearly from the platform. The repositioning and cleanup of the drill rig delayed the project by nearly two weeks. The damages from Cyclone Orson increased the total cost of the platform to roughly (). Upon making landfall, Orson produced a storm surge of . This came during low tide, having a height of . Severe erosion was recorded along coastal areas, some losing nearly of rocks.

History Jews settled in √ìbuda, today a neighborhood of Budapest, from c. 1712 at a time when Jews were forbidden to live in Buda.Carole Herselle Krinsky, Synagogues of Europe; Architecture, History, Meaning, MIT Press, 1985; revised edition, MIT Press, 1986 (); Dover reprint, 1996, pp. 155‚Äì156 Countess Zichy invited them to live on Zichy family property in √ìbuda. A synagogue was constructed in 1737. The present building replaced it on the same site in 1820. The building's original copper roof was requisitioned by the government and melted for munitions production during World War I.Hew Strachan, The First World War: To Arms, Hew Strachan, Oxford University Press, 2003, , p. 1048. The Jewish building had not been singled out; the Holy Trinity Cathedral, Sibiu was only one of the many churches that lost its bells as not only church bells but roofs, gutters, and even brass crucifixes were melted down across the Empire to produce copper for the war effort.Arthur James May, The Passing of the Hapsburg Monarchy, 1914‚Äì1918, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1966, p. 336. At the time the synagogue was built, the community of √ìbuda was the largest Jewish community in Hungary. According to the boastful author of an 1822 Austro-Hungarian guidebook, not only was the synagogue the \\"most magnificent\\" new building in √ìbuda, few synagogues elsewhere could compare to its magnificence. It was \\"undoubtedly\\" one of the most magnificent synagogues in the entire Austro-Hungarian Empire, and one of the finest in all Europe, \\"Not even the Jewish temple of Temesv√°r can compete with it in pomp, not to mention the old synagogues of Prague. The only building that may outdo it in grandiosity is the building of the Jewish community of Amsterdam,\\" (a reference to the Portuguese Synagogue in Amsterdam). In 1831, following the death of Rabbi Moses Munz, the congregation left orthodoxy to follow reformist Neolog Judaism. Beginning in 1848, the congregation expressed its support for Hungarian nationalism by having sermons delivered every other week in Hungarian. In 1850, the town had 3439 Jewish residents, 31.4% of the population. The community shrank throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as members moved into the flourishing city of Pest. But the town, district III of Budapest was still 10% Jewish in 1926. In the 1970s, the diminished Jewish community sold the building for use as a television studio. Used for a long time as a TV studio, it was reinaugurated as a synagogue on September 5, 2010, Yona Metzger, chief rabbi of Israel and Zsolt Semj√©n, Hungarian vice-prime minister, being present.Jean Vidal; \\"Juda√Øsme et Isra√´l √† Budapest\\" in L'Arche, n¬∞ 629, October 2010 The new rabbi is Slomo K√∂ves, a Lubavitch. Architecture The synagogue was designed in French Empire style by architect Andreas Landesherr, who greatly enlarged and embellished the 1731 building, altering the appearance beyond recognition. The pediment and six Corinthian columns of the facade give the synagogue the aspect of a classical temple. The pediment was embellished with carved Classical ornament, and surmounted by the tablets of the Ten Commandments.Rachel Wischnitzer, Architecture of the European Synagogue, Jewish Publication Society of America, 1964, p. 180‚Äì181 On the side walls two tiers of round-arched windows alternate with classical pilasters. Inside, the bimah boasted four impressive corner columns in the form of the then popular Egyptian Revival obelisks. Each obelisk stood atop a plinth, both heavily embellished with carved, classical ornament, capped by a sphere capped by an eagle. The Torah ark was flanked by classical columns, and topped by Tablets of the Law, surmounted by a crown and surrounded by a painted burst of clouds. It once held no fewer than 28 Torah scrolls belonging to the wealthy congregation. The women's gallery ran along the northern and western walls. Fourteen chandeliers hung from the ceiling, causing some congregants to complain about the extravagance of the synagogue's directors.Jewish Budapest; Monuments, Rites and History, by Geza Komoroczy, Viktoria Pusztai, Andrea Strbik, Kinga Frojimovics, Central European University Press (January 1999), p. 45‚Äì46.

Barkan, intending to write a song for Dusty Springfield, had already written the chorus for \\"I'll Try Anything\\" when Millrose came on board to co-write the verses. Springfield visited Barkan's residence to hear the song which Barkan sang to her while playing the piano, and although Springfield reacted favorably to the song she still wanted to hear a demo, and Barkan obliged by prepping a demo with Ellie Greenwich as vocalist. Springfield began recording \\"I'll Try Anything\\" in a December 1966 session at the CBS Recording Studios (NYC) produced by Herb Bernstein: Barkan, who was present, recalls that the session lasted for nine hours with the first eight spent on Springfield recording another song: \\"The Morning After the Night Before\\", and the last hour spent on her recording \\"I'll Try Anything\\". On 22 January 1967 Springfield and Bernstein had another session at CBS Recording Studios which yielded a completed master of \\"I'll Try Anything\\": however Springfield elected to have the master's rhythm track extracted and used as the basis for a new recording of the song made at the Philips Studios in Stanhope Place in a 29 January 1967 session. Since making her solo debut in 1963 with the upbeat \\"I Only Want to Be With You\\" Springfield had subsequently shifted her musical focus to a softer sound as exemplified by her 1966 career record \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\". \\"I'll Try Anything\\" was largely a return to Springfield's original upbeat sound and might have been a more substantial hit for her somewhat earlier. However, by 1967 the track had a markedly out-of-date sound and in its UK release peaked at #13 breaking a Top Ten streak for Springfield which had lasted for three hits. In the US \\"I'll Try Anything\\" peaked at #40 in April 1967 on the Billboard Hot 100 - with peaks in Cash Box and Record World of respectively #29 and #34 - making it the sixth of Springfield's ten US Top 40 solo hits. \\"I'll Try Anything\\" reached #38 in Australia and #19 in Canada. The track had its strongest chart impact in Singapore with a #6 peak in June 1967. Apart from Springfield's version, the only evident recordings of the song are two non-English renderings: the French-language \\"J'aurai mon tour de chance\\" recorded by Qu√©b√©cois singer Ren√©e Martel (fr) and \\"Quero um Beatle de Presente\\" by Brazilian Jovem Guarda singer Maritza Fabiani with Portuguese lyrics by Carlos Wallace.

It appears in paintings by Andrew Wyeth and his son Jamie Wyeth, who have owned the lighthouse since 1978. History It was established in 1857 on Southern Island, on the south side of the entrance to the harbor. It is on the west side of Two Bush Channel, the southwestern entrance to Penobscot Bay. The light was above the high-water mark. By the 1900s a fifth-order Fresnel lens replaced the original fourth-order (larger) lens. The 1¬Ω-story, wood-framed, colonial cape lighthouse keeper's residence was constructed in 1857. A brick- covered passageway connects the tower and the keeper's quarters. Other buildings include a storage building (1895), an oil house (1906), a boathouse, and a hand-operated fog bell in a square pyramidal tower (automated subsequently). The light was discontinued in 1933 and auctioned off as surplus in 1936. Current status The lighthouse was purchased in 1978 by Andrew Wyeth. His son Jamie now owns it. He reconstructed the white square pyramid bell house, and it is said to be a scaled-down replica of one of Lord Horatio Nelson's cabins on HMS Victory. The lighthouse has appeared in several Wyeth paintings, including Fog Bell (1967) and Signal Flags by Andrew Wyeth.

Robert Southey became a close friend of Coleridge during the summer of 1794 and the two originally formed a plan to start an ideal community together. Although the plan fell apart, Coleridge dedicated the poem to his friend and emphasized Southey's poetic abilities. Following the poem, Coleridge further drifted from Southey and the poem was not republished. Background Coleridge first met Southey when Coleridge was about to tour Wales during the summer of 1794. They shared similar political views and the two bonded immediately. Together, they established a plan to create a community run by the ideas of Pantisocracy, a system that would emphasize agriculture and communal living. To further attain this goal, they each married one of the Fricker sisters and started to make financial arrangements along with discussing with others that would join them. The two wrote many poems, with The Fall of Robespierre written by both, and they planned to sell the poems to help provide money. However, Coleridge left the side of his wife and travelled to London to further his poetic career.Ashton 1997 pp. 41‚Äì62 On 1 December 1794, the Morning Chronicle began to run a series of Coleridge's poems called Sonnets on Eminent Characters or on \\"Eminent Contemporaries\\".Holmes 1989 p. 81 In a 17 December 1794 letter from Coleridge to Southey, Coleridge copied a sonnet about Southey with a note that said, \\"I took the Liberty‚ÄîGracious God! pardon me for the aristocratic frigidity of that expression‚ÄîI indulged my Feelings by sending this among my Contemporary Sonnets\\".Mays 2001 qtd. p. 167 The poem was printed for the 14 January 1795 Morning Chronicle, which ran it as the tenth poem of Coleridge's series under the name \\"To Robert Southey, of Baliol College, Oxford, Author of the 'Retrospect,' and Other Poems\\". It was the only time the poem was published.Mays 2001 p. 167 Although Coleridge and Southey continued to spend time together and collaborate on their poetic efforts, their relationship was greatly strained and their ideas for the Pantisocratic government fell apart.Speck pp. 53‚Äì61 The change in Coleridge's opinions on both Southey and William Godwin is reflected in Coleridge's not republishing the poems on either of them within his 1796 collection of poems. However, Coleridge also omitted the poems because he did not think they were any good.Joseph and Francis 2004 p. 267 Poem The only edition of the poem reads: Themes The Sonnets on Eminent Characters contained many poems dedicated to those Coleridge considered his hero from many fields, with Southey ranking amongst them.Ashton 1997 p. 61 Like the poems in the series \\"To Godwin\\" and \\"To Bowles\\", \\"To Southey\\" talks about Coleridge's personal life and Southey's involvement in it.Mays 2001 p. 166 The heroes were divided into those who were artists, intellectuals, political figures, and military figures in a way similar to Milton. In particular, Milton's sonnet on Henry Lawes (\\"Sonnet 13\\") was the model for Coleridge's poem on Southey, along with the poem \\"To Bowles\\" and \\"To Mrs Siddons\\".Curran 1986 p. 35 Like with Coleridge's feelings towards William Godwin after writing \\"To Godwin\\", Coleridge began to intellectually separate from Southey after \\"To Southey\\", and, during his lecture series in 1795, he began to stress Christianity as essential to his political beliefs.Trott 2990 p. 44 However, even within the poem, there is no direct reference to Southey's liberal political beliefs. Instead, the poem only discusses Southey as a poet. A side effect from not including the sonnet in the 1796 series is that Coleridge effectively removed the only sonnet about a contemporary poet from the series. Notes References * Ashton, Rosemary.

It developed on May 17, 1970 north of Panama, and rapidly intensified on May 20 to peak winds of , near Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. It stalled south of Cuba and deteriorated due to wind shear, and by May 22 it weakened to tropical depression status. After progressing northwestward and crossing western Cuba, Alma reorganized in the Gulf of Mexico, although continued shear prevented strengthening. It moved across Florida on May 25, and on May 27 it dissipated off the coast of Virginia. The storm first brought gusty winds and heavy rainfall to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. While it was weakening, Alma produced flooding in central and eastern Cuba, causing seven deaths and forcing 3,000 people to evacuate. Moderate precipitation spread across Florida, while thunderstorms from the storm caused light damage, killing one. Moisture from the storm spread up the Atlantic coast. Meteorological history Late on May 17, the US National Hurricane Center, reported that a tropical depression had formed about to the southeast of Kingston, Jamaica. Over the next couple of days, the depression became better organized as it moved towards the northwest; on May 19 it entered an area of favorable environmental conditions, which enabled the depression to rapidly intensify. On May 20 it strengthened into a tropical storm, at which point it was given the name Alma. That day, it rapidly strengthened under favorable developmental conditions, which included low wind shear, strong upper-level outflow, and apparent eastward inflow. Later on May 20, a Navy reconnaissance plane recorded winds of , which proved to be the peak intensity of Alma. It became one of only four Atlantic hurricanes on record in the month of May. Subsequent to its peak intensity, increasing westerly shear disrupted the storm's circulation and thermal pattern, which caused rapid weakening to tropical storm strength and later tropical depression status. By May 22, the low pressure area became poorly defined after stalling south of Cuba; with only a few squalls and showers, advisories were discontinued on Alma. The remnants of Alma continued westward near the Cayman Islands, and later turned to the north, passing over western Cuba. On May 24, the low pressure area reorganized as spiral rainbands became more evident on radar, and Alma was re-classified as a tropical depression. As the depression approached the Florida coast, radar imagery indicated the system remained well-organized, with a spiral band structure around an eye feature; however, wind shear limited convection and strength, and Alma moved ashore as a depression near Cedar Key on May 25\\\\. It turned northeastward and moved across the southeastern United States, becoming extratropical in North Carolina on May 27\\\\. After moving off the coast of Virginia, the remnants of Alma were absorbed by an approaching cold front. Impact Rainfall map After Alma weakened from hurricane status, it passed near the Cayman Islands on May 21, where winds of up to were recorded. Gale-force winds and heavy rainfall also occurred in Jamaica. Heavy rains ahead of the storm caused flash flooding in central and eastern Cuba. Seven people died as a result, and several homes were destroyed. The flooding forced the evacuation of 3,000 people in Oriente Province. Inclement weather closed 16 sugar mills, which stalled harvesting that was already behind schedule in the country. In Florida, the remnants of Alma brought rainfall across most of the state, with some isolated areas experiencing or more. The highest rainfall from the storm was near Miami, Florida, with of rain. The rainfall was beneficial in alleviating drought conditions, although thunderstorms caused hazardous driving conditions in the Florida Keys and elsewhere in the state. Small craft warnings were posted along the coast. One girl died from lightning in Miami, and a thunderstorm near Fort Myers damaged some roofs and outbuildings. In Saint Petersburg, flooding disrupted phonelines in about 400 households. Merritt Island experienced wind gusts. In Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, Alma dropped moderate rainfall, with some isolated areas receiving up to .

After discovering the work of Donald Westlake, Browne set his sights on becoming a writer and at seventeen wrote 130 pages of a comedy mystery novel that remains unfinished. Browne tried writing speculative episodes of The Rockford Files and Harry O, among others, but none of these scripts were ever purchased and Browne shifted his interest to music. Hollywood In 1990, Browne took up writing again and completed a feature- length screenplay, which was a winner in the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting competition. The program is sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences and is designed to give aspiring screenwriters a way into the film industry. Browne was one of five winners that year and received a twenty thousand dollar grant for his screenplay, Low Tide. Several weeks after winning, that screenplay sold to Showtime and was slated to be produced by the network. After two years of development, executives overseeing production left the network and the screenplay was put into turnaround. Browne continued working in Hollywood for many years. In the late 1990s, he worked with producer-writer Larry Brody, and was hired by Saban/Fox Kids as a staff writer for the animated show, Diabolik, based on the famed Italian comic book. He and Brody later worked together on the Marvel production, Spider-Man Unlimited. In 2010, CBS Television and Sony Pictures produced a television pilot based on Browne's novel, Kiss Her Goodbye. The pilot starred Dylan Walsh, Michael Rapaport, Sandrine Holt, and Terry Kinney, with a script written and directed by Michael Dinner. Career as a Novelist In 2005, Browne's first novel, Kiss Her Goodbye, sold to St. Martin's Press. St. Martin's subsequently published three more novels, Whisper in the Dark (which received a starred review from Publishers Weekly), Kill Her Again, and Down Among the Dead Men. In 2011, Browne moved to Dutton Penguin, which released his apocalyptic supernatural thriller, The Paradise Prophecy. In 2012, Browne released a mystery thriller entitled Trial Junkies, which became an Amazon bestseller. 2013 brought two books: Trial Junkies 2: Negligence and Poe, co- written with Brett Battles, and later Takedown, a sequel to Poe. In 2015, Browne launched a new series Linger using the pen name Edward Fallon. Under his Braun Haus Media banner, Browne commissioned several authors to write further stories in the Linger series using the Fallon name, and wrote the seventh book himself.

Plot The film takes place in the year 1750 on the American frontier during the colonial days, before the United States declared its independence. A group of pioneers narrowly escape persecution when their preacher is accused of adultery and polygamy. The preacher, Will Smythe, is accused of having an affair with a married woman, Eloise Dalton, whose husband is away hunting for food, and another woman, Leah, who is insane. Also among their group is Eloise's daughter Fanny Dalton, the couple Jewell Buchanan and Margaret Buchanan along with their daughter Cathleen, Calvin and his wife who goes by the name Sister, and their granddaughter Meg. As the group travels farther away from their town, the threat of attack from hostile Native American tribes becomes more prevalent until the group is eventually ambushed. Calvin does not survive the attack, but the others are protected by Leah, who has used witchcraft to provide their protection. All the while the others are unaware that Leah is using magic to keep them safe. The remaining members of the group are forced to abandon their trail along the riverbank, and take cover in the woods far from man-made trails. At this time, Eloise's husband Marion Dalton returns home to find news that his wife was scheduled to be executed along with Will for affair and also learns that the two are on the run with others from the town. Marion pursues and eventually catches up to them. Leah wanders away from the group for a short while. By this time the Shawnee Indians have caught up to the group and Marion Dalton, who speaks fluently in many tribal languages, is able to convince the Shawnee to abort the attack, at least for a short while, though Marion is certain the Shawnee will be back in bigger numbers. Leah returns covered in white feathers and Marion recognizes this as a warning from the Shawnee Indians to other members of the Shawnee tribe not to enter a nearby valley. Realizing that the Shawnee have superstitions about the valley, Marion leads the group into the valley, knowing that if the Shawnee were to return, they would not follow the pioneers into the valley because of various Native American superstitions some of the tribes have in regards to this particular valley. Once the group settles in the deserted valley, they are safe from any and all tribes of Native Americans. Though the pioneers are no longer under the threat of attack from the Shawnee, they find a young Native American orphan on the outskirts of their camp. The pioneers are still unnerved by the previous attacks, but reluctantly bring the girl into the camp and care for her. It seems that only Will is pleased with the orphan's unexpected appearance, and he is delighted at the possibility of baptizing her into Christianity. Aside from Will, it seems the others in the group are unnerved by the orphan girl's presence. And Leah, who has an extraordinary connection to the supernatural, senses that there is something unusual about the Native American child, and Leah soon begins to have visions as she tries to uncover the motives of the orphan girl. Fanny disappears soon afterward, and her body is later found by Marion, with the help of Leah through her abilities and visions, though Fanny appears to be in a coma. Only when Fanny awakens do they realize that the warnings to stay away from the valley are founded on more than just mythology, coupled with the frightening revelation that the orphan girl is more than what she seems when the group is terrorized by an evil spirit that desires to make them all its living captives.

Reception Caryn James from The New York Times gave the film a somewhat neutral review, calling it \\"an imagistic morality tale\\" and \\"a bizarrely fascinating story told in flashback\\", but also was somewhat critical saying \\"If Mr. Crounse had stayed poised on the line between human reality and horrific visions of evil, he might have turned out a small masterpiece, or at least a cult film. As it is, Eyes of Fire is an ambitious idea gone haywire, as if The Scarlet Letter had zoomed into the future and collided with the movie version of The Exorcist.\\" Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade B. In his review, Schwartz wrote, \\"The arty horror pic, not for all tastes... Though it's a flawed film, its strange storyline captivated me despite such obvious flaws as the performances were mostly inadequate, the story had choppy moments and the special effects were cheesy.\\" HorrorNews.net gave the film a positive review, calling it \\"creepy\\", and \\"artistically beautiful\\". Steven Ryder from Critics Associated.com awarded the film 4 out of 4 stars, praising the film's atmosphere, tone, and sense of dread; writing, \\"[it] may not be blessed with the same production values or talent that these later films are yet the electric aura and commitment to unrelenting dread make Eyes of Fire an almost- forgotten paragon of folk horror.\\" Author Edmund G. Bansak compared the film favorably to the films by Val Lewton, commending the film's acting, atmosphere, cinematography, and \\"authentic period flavor\\", while also noting that the film deteriorated towards the end. Critic Judith Crist of WOR-TV was somewhat more favorable calling the film \\"a spook movie with a difference\\" while Variety (magazine) praised the film's \\"big league special effects\\".  Availability  As of 2020, there is still no official DVD release. Lions Gate Entertainment is the current copyright holder. There have been recent 35mm screenings of this film, so if the original negatives no longer exist, good source materials are still available to create a proper DVD release.

It is in the town of St.George. Established in 1804, it is one of Maine's oldest light stations, with its present tower built in 1852 to a design attributed to Alexander Parris. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Whitehead Light Station on March 14, 1988. The property is now owned by not for profit Pine Island Camp. Whitehead light station offers to the public various stays at the light station from getaway weekends to learning retreats and renting the station as a vacation home. The light itself remains an active aid to navigation, maintained by the United States Coast Guard. Description and history Whitehead Island is a island off the northeastern coast of St. George, near the southwestern approach to Penobscot Bay. In addition to the lighthouse complex, the island is also home to the former Whitehead Lifesaving Station, located near its southwestern point. The light station is located at the island's southeastern point, and includes the lighthouse, keeper's house, oilhouse, and a fog signal building. The tower is built out of cut granite blocks, rising to a sixteen-sided lantern house surrounded by an iron walkway and railing. A small brick service room projects from one side. Adjacent to the tower is the keeper's house, a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure with a gabled roof and a T-shaped configuration. The oilhouse is a small brick structure with a gabled roof and an entrance on one side. The fog signal is a square brick building with a hip roof. with The light station on Whitehead Island was authorized in 1804 by President Thomas Jefferson, and went into service in 1807; it is the third-oldest active light station in the state of Maine. The present tower was built in 1852, its design attributed to Alexander Parris, on the basis of its similarity to the Monhegan Island Light, which is known to be Parris' work. The keeper's house is a replacement, built in 1891, the same year the oilhouse was built. The fog signal was added in 1869-70, a consequence of the area's frequent foggy conditions. The complex originally included covered ways between the major buildings, but these have been removed. The station was automated in 1982, at which time the keeper's house was boarded up. In 1996, as part of the Maine Lights Program, Whitehead Light Station became property of Pine Island Camp, a 100+ year old non profit institution in central Maine. Whitehead Light Station keepers house and school house were painstakingly renovated over a 12-year period and are now beautifully restored. The light station offers adult enrichment programs during the summer months and is also available for rent by the week. The house has 7 bedrooms each with its own bathroom, three sitting rooms, a modern kitchen and dining room.

The light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Winter Harbor Light Station on February 1, 1988. Description and history The town of Winter Harbor, Maine occupies the southwestern portion of the Schoodic Peninsula, which juts into the Gulf of Maine east of Mount Desert Island. Its harbor is located on the western side of the larger peninsular, between its southernmost tip and a shorter peninsula that extends south from its western coast. Mark Island is a small island, in size that is the southernmost island of a line extending south from the tip of this western peninsula. The light station occupies the entire island. The light station includes four structures, of which the main one is the tower and keeper's house. The tower, built in 1856, is a round brick structure topped by an original octagonal lantern house with an iron walkway and railing around it. A brick single-story workroom projects from the tower, and is connected to the house by a shed-roofed wood-frame ell. The keeper's house is a two-story wood- frame structure, which was built in 1876 (along with the ell) to replace the original keeper's house. The property's other buildings are a small wooden shed of unknown construction date, a small brick oilhouse built in 1905, and a boathouse built in 1878. The light went into service in 1856, operating with a fifth-order Fresnel lens, acting as an aid to navigation for the local fishing fleet. The light was decommissioned in 1934 and sold into private hands. The property remains in private hands, and the light is inactive.

J.B. Knight et al, in 1960 included the bucaniids in the Bellerophontidae as the subfamily Bucaniinae, and considered them true gastropods belonging to the prosobranch order, Archaeogastropoda, giving evidence that embryonic torson is not the cause of asymmetric coiling of typical gastropod shells. Physiologic restriction points to the viscera being turned 180 degrees with the gills and anus to the front and the aperture positioned to best facilitate retreat inward by the head and foot. The Trestise Part I divided the Bucaniinae into two tribes, the Bucaniides, in which the exhalent emargination is a short slit, and the Salpingostoma in which the exhalent orifice consists of one or more holes in series, known as trema. Bouchet & Rocroi, (2005) have elevated the tribes Bucaniides and Salpingostoma to the subfamilies Bucaniinae and Salpingostomatinae. They added the subfamilies, Undulabucaniinae and Plectonotinae which includes the tribes Plectonotini and Boucotonotini.

K., & Sears, R. R. (1995) The Gifted Group in Later Maturity. Stanford University Press: Stanford, CA. is the oldest and longest- running longitudinal study in the field of psychology. It was begun by Lewis Terman at Stanford University in 1921 to examine the development and characteristics of gifted children into adulthood.Holahan, p. xi. The results from the study have been published in five books,Holahan & Sears, 1995 a monograph, and dozens of articles. A related retrospective study of eminent men in history by Catharine Cox, though not part of the longitudinal study, was published as part of the Genetic Studies of Genius. It further inspired the ongoing Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth longitudinal study.  Origin  Lewis Terman, founder of the Genetic Studies of Genius Terman had previously performed studies in intelligence, including his doctoral dissertation. In 1916, he adapted Alfred Binet's intelligence test for the United States and expanded its range. The result was the Stanford‚ÄìBinet Intelligence Scales, which are still in use today (in an updated form). After his service in developing the Army Alpha during World War I, Terman returned to Stanford in order to start his study. Terman had already found some bright children through his earlier research, and some of these were part of the sample in the Genetic Studies of Genius. He hired several assistants, including Florence Goodenough and Catharine Cox, to search the public schools of California for similarly gifted children. Terman initially hoped to find the 1,000 most intelligent children,Terman, 1930, p. 19. but eventually found 1,444.Terman, 1930, p. 39 However, Terman gradually added subjects to the study through 1928 until there were 1,528 (856 males and 672 females).Holahan & Sears, 1995, p. 12 Not all subjects were discovered with the Stanford‚ÄìBinet. Some were selected for the study with the National Intelligence Tests and the Army Alpha. The study subjects were born between 1900 and 1925, all lived in California, were 95-99% white, and the majority came from upper- or middle- class families.Holahan & Sears, 1995, p. 11‚Äì14  Early findings  Terman's goal was to disprove the then-current belief that gifted children were sickly, socially inept, and not well-rounded. Therefore, the first volume of the study reported data on the children's family,Terman, 1926, p. 135‚Äì252 educational progress,Terman, 1926, p. 253‚Äì306 special abilities,Terman, 1926, p. 307‚Äì362 interests,Terman, 1926, p. 363‚Äì384, 441‚Äì484 play,Terman, 1926, p. 385‚Äì440 and personality.Terman, 1926, p. 485‚Äì556 He also examined the children's racial and ethnic heritage.Terman, 1926, p. 55‚Äì112 Terman was a proponent of eugenics, although not as radical as many of his contemporary social Darwinists, and believed that intelligence testing could be used as a positive tool to shape society. Based on data collected in 1921‚Äì22, Terman concluded that gifted children suffered no more health problems than normal for their age, save a little more myopia than average. He also found that the children were usually social, were well-adjusted, did better in school, and were even taller than average.Terman, 1926 A follow-up performed in 1923‚Äì1924 found that the children had maintained their high IQs and were still above average overall as a group. Data collected in the 1920s also including a pioneering effort to implement above-level testing on a large scale, a practice that is widespread in gifted education today.  Follow-ups  Terman planned later follow-ups, and in his lifetime data would be collected in 1928, 1936, 1940, 1945, 1950, and 1955. At his death, the study was directed by Melita Oden, who collected additional data in 1960. Robert Richardson Sears later took charge of the study and collected data in 1972, 1977, 1982, and 1986.Holahan & Sears, 1995, p. 18‚Äì24 Moreover, many study participants corresponded with Terman or visited Stanford University in order to keep him updated on their lives.Holahan & Sears, 1995, p. 275‚Äì276 According to those who have access to the study archives, the files also include news articles, letters, and other documents related to the study participants. The later follow-ups asked questions about war service, college education, marital status and happiness, work, retirement, raising children, and other lifetime events and concerns.Holahan & Sears, 1995 Well over half of men and women in Terman's study finished college, compared to 8% of the general population at the time. Some of Terman's subjects reached great prominence in their fields. Among them were head I Love Lucy writer Jess Oppenheimer,Leslie, 2000 American Psychological Association president and educational psychologist Lee Cronbach, Ancel Keys,Shurkin, 1992 and Robert Sears himself. Over fifty men became college and university faculty members.Oden, 1968, p. 17. However, the majority of study participants' lives were more mundane. By the 4th volume of Genetic Studies of Genius, Terman had noted that as adults, his subjects pursued common occupations \\"as humble as those of policeman, seaman, typist and filing clerk\\" and concluded:  Criticism  The study has been criticized for not having a generalizable sample.Holahan & Sears, p. 11 Moreover, Terman meddled in his subject's lives, giving them letters of recommendation for jobs and college and pulling strings at Stanford to help them get admitted. This makes any life outcomes of the sample tainted and ungeneralizable. In his book Fads and foibles in modern sociology and related sciences (p. 70‚Äì76), sociologist Pitirim Sorokin criticized the research, saying that Terman's selected group of children with high IQs did about as well as a random group of children selected from similar family backgrounds would have done. As in any longitudinal study, it is possible that the characteristics and behaviors of the sample are a partial result of the era they lived in. Indeed, many members of the sample could not attend college, due to the Great Depression and World War II.Holahan & Sears, 1995, p. 45 Almost half of women in the sample were homemakers for most of their lives.Holahan & Sears, 1995, p. 87 Despite these shortcomings, the data from the sample is often used for studies because there is no other group of people who have been followed for so long.  Today  As time has passed, the sample has dwindled. As of 2003, there were over 200 members of the sample still alive.Christmann, E. P., & Badgett, J. L. (2008). Interpreting assessment data. NTSA Press. The study is to continue until the final member of the sample either withdraws or dies. In the 21st century researchers continue to publish articles based on the data collected in the Genetic Studies of Genius. For example, one article found that men who skipped a grade in childhood had higher incomes throughout adulthood.

Bowman (c. 1813 - December 22, 1866), also known as Sarah Borginnis or Sarah Bourdette, was an Irish American innkeeper, restaurateur, and madam. Nicknamed \\"The Great Western\\", she gained fame, and the title \\"Heroine of Fort Brown\\", as a camp follower of Zachary Taylor's army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Following the war she operated an inn in Franklin, Texas (now El Paso) before settling near Arizona City (now Yuma, Arizona). Over the course of her life she was married multiple times, often without legal record or the blessing of a priest, and was known at various times by the names Boginnis, Bourdette, Bourget, Bourjette, Borginnis, Davis, Bowman, and possibly Foyle. Following her death she was breveted an honorary colonel and buried with military honors in the Fort Yuma cemetery. Her story became part of American popular culture. Background Bowman is believed to have been born Sarah Knight sometime between 1812 and 1813 (the 1860 census indicates her birth may have occurred as late as 1818) in either Tennessee or Clay County, Missouri. Raised on the American frontier, she received no formal education, and is believed to have been illiterate due to her use of an X on business and census forms. Despite the inability to read and write, she was bilingual by her later years, with a priest near Fort Yuma noting she was the first American woman he had met fluent in Spanish. Physically, Bowman was an unusually large woman. Standing tall (some reports claim ) and reportedly weighing , she was described as \\"a remarkably large, well-proportioned strong woman, of strong nerves, and great physical power.\\" Other observers noted she had an hourglass figure. Due to her large size she was nicknamed the Great Western, an apparent reference to SS Great Western, for a time the largest ship afloat. Bowman also possessed skills to complement her Amazon-like physique. Texas Ranger John Salmon Ford said of her, \\"She could whip any man, fair fight or foul, could shoot a pistol better than anyone in the region, and at black jack could outplay (or out cheat) the slickest professional gambler.\\" Several tales are told of Bowman and her earlier years. The first is that she and her husband had accompanied Zachary Taylor during his campaign during the Seminole Wars. There is no record of a woman matching Bowman's description accompanying Taylor, but such an event would help explain her later loyalty to him. A second tale claims Bowman was in love with Taylor. If this is true, there is no evidence the affection was returned. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War The first documented record of Bowman occurs in 1845 at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. When her husband enlisted in the Seventh infantry, she signed on as a laundress, a position that included food, shelter, and the opportunity to earn a salary three times that earned by an Army private. From Jefferson Barracks she accompanied the army to Corpus Christi Bay. By the time the army arrived in July 1845, her duties included cook and nurse in addition to the laundry. The army remained encamped along the Nueces River till March 1846 when they received orders to advance to the Rio Grande. Instead of following her husband, who was ill, and most of the military wives on ships down the coast, Bowman purchased a wagon and mule team and followed the army on land. She handled the trek with skills the \\"best teamster in the train might have envied.\\" The first encounter between American and Mexican forces came on March 21, 1846 during the crossing of Arroyo Colorado. As the Americans approached the steep embankment, bugles rang out on the other bank accompanied by the warning, \\"Cross this stream and you will be shot!\\" Upon seeing the column halted, Bowman rode to the front and told the commander, \\"If the general would give me a strong pair of tongs, I'd wade that river and whip every scoundrel that dared show himself.\\" (In addition to the tool, tongs was at the time slang for men's trousers.) Inspired by her example the American troops made the crossing, scattering the opposing troops in the process. =Heroine of Fort Brown= Sarah Borginnes depicted as the Heroine of Fort Brown By May 1846, Bowman was married to her second husband, a man named Borginnes (spellings vary). Her husband was assigned to Fort Texas (later renamed Fort Brown) where she operated an officer's mess. When Taylor withdrew the majority of his troops to confront the Mexican army near the coast, forces in Matamoros, stationed directly across the Rio Grande, responded by besieging the fort. The Mexican bombardment began May 3 at 5 am. While most of the women in the fort retreated to the bunkers to sew sandbags, Borginnes remained at her cooking fire and served breakfast at 7 am. For the next week she prepared food and coffee for the besieged fort, carrying buckets of coffee to the troops manning the fort's guns, even finding time to care for the wounded and other women. Her schedule of three meals daily was continued even though bullets struck both her bonnet and bread tray. She also requisitioned a musket in case the fort was stormed. Following the siege, Borginnes came to the attention of U.S. newspapers who named her the \\"Heroine of Fort Brown\\". Stories of her exploits were published in both Philadelphia and New York City. One correspondent even went out of his way to extol her virtues and fight any \\"tongues of slander\\" that might be directed at her character. =Battle of Buena Vista= Following Fort Brown, Borginnes briefly established a boarding house called the American House in Matamoros. In addition to food, lodging, and stables for soldiers' horses, the establishment also served as a saloon and brothel. This establishment proved quite popular, with one soldier describing it as \\"the headquarters for everyone\\". As Taylor's force moved into Mexico the American House moved with the army, first to Monterrey and then to Saltillo. While Borginnes was not involved in the Battle of Monterrey, she did see action during the Battle of Buena Vista. During the conflict she prepared food and coffee, reloaded weapons, and carried wounded off the field of battle. Her attention to the injured even earned her the nickname \\"Doctor Mary\\". Legend claims she received a saber wound to her cheek while working a cannon position before slaying the Mexican soldier who cut her. Another incident involves a retreating private. The soldier ran into Borginnes' restaurant yelling that Taylor had been defeated. She responded by punching the private in the face and telling him \\"You damned son of a bitch, there ain't Mexicans enough in Mexico to whip old Taylor. You just spread that report and I'll beat you to death.\\" During the battle Borginnes learned that Captain George Lincoln, a friend that had joined the army at the same time as her husband, had been killed. Not wishing to have his body stripped, she searched for him during the battle. Upon finding him, she brought the body back to Saltillo and made sure he was properly buried. After the battle she purchased Lincoln's horse at auction, beating a $75 bid with a $200 offer, and made arrangements for the horse to be sent to the captain's family. Following her actions upon the field of battle, tradition maintains that General Winfield Scott ordered a military pension for Borginnes. Later life Following the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, the U.S. Army prepared to depart Northern Mexico. By this time Borginnes' second husband had left herwhether by death or abandonment is unknown. She wished to accompany the departing troops to California, but was informed that only military wives were allowed to join the column. In response she mounted her horse, rode through the soldiers, and shouted \\"Who wants a wife with $15,000 and the biggest leg in Mexico! Come, my beauties, don't all speak at oncewho is the lucky man?\\" Eventually a dragoon named either Davis or David E. volunteered, on condition that a priest perform the marriage ceremony. Her response to this was, \\"Bring your blanket to my tent tonight and I will learn you to tie a knot that will satisfy you, I reckon!\\" By early 1849, following a brief illness, the \\"Great Western\\" arrived in Franklin (now El Paso, Texas) without a husband and again using her second husband's name. There she established an inn that catered to people traveling across the country as part of the California Gold Rush. In the process she became known as El Paso's first Anglo woman and the town's first madam, gaining a reputation as a \\"whore with a heart of gold\\". By early 1850, Borginnes had moved up the Rio Grande to the town of Socorro. There she lived with a man named Juan Duran and five girls, possibly orphans, with the last name of Skinner. Shortly thereafter she married Alfred J. Bowman, a dragoon in the U.S. Army. Following his discharge on November 30, 1850 the couple moved west. =Fort Yuma= Bowman arrived at Yuma Crossing in 1852. Yuma's first business operator, she cooked and did laundry for the officers of Fort Yuma while her husband prospected. One of the fort's soldiers noted, \\"She has been with the Army twenty years and was brought up here where she keeps the officer's mess. Among her other good qualities she is an admirable \`pimp'. She used to be a splendid-looking woman and has done good service but is too old for that now.\\" After a time Bowman opened a hotel near the fort, along with other businesses near Fort Buchanan and Patagonia, Arizona. In addition to her business interests, she adopted a number of Mexican and Indian children. Bowman died December 22, 1866 from a spider bite. Following her death she was breveted an honorary colonel and buried with military honors in the Fort Yuma cemetery. In 1890, following the decommissioning of Fort Yuma, she was exhumed and reburied at San Francisco National Cemetery in a grave marked \\"Sarah A. Bowman\\". In popular culture In 1998, the events of Bowman's life were used as the basis for the historical novel Fearless, A Novel of Sarah Bowman.* She also features under the name Sarah Borginnis in Cormac McCarthy's epic Western Blood Meridian, and a fictionalized version of \\"The Great Western\\" appears in Larry McMurtry's novel Dead Man's Walk References Further reading   * External links *Bowman, Sarah, Handbook of Texas The Tall Man, 1960-1962 Samuel A.

History The base was originally called Bartolomeu de Gusm√£o Airport and it was constructed to handle the operations with the rigid airships Graf Zeppelin and Hindenburg. Between 1931 and 1937, Deutsche Luft Hansa had regular flights between Germany and Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro as final stop. For this reason Luftschiffbau Zeppelin decided to construct a dedicated facility and move its operations from Campo dos Afonsos Airport. The airport was inaugurated on 26 December 1936. The whole complex consisted of an airfield, the hangar, a hydrogen factory and a branch-line connecting the complex to the main railway line to downtown Rio de Janeiro 54 km away among other structures. Some of the buildings are still in use, particularly the hangar which was built to accommodate the rigid airships. Because it is the only original surviving hangar built for rigid airships in the world, on 14 March 1999, it was listed as a National Heritage Site. As a consequence to the Hindenburg disaster on 6 May 1937 at Lakehurst Air Naval Station in New Jersey, US, the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin requested to the Brazilian Government on 17 June 1937 the suspension of services. Since then no more civil operations were handled at this facility. On 12 February 1942, six months before Brazil declaring war against the Axis, the airport became a base of the Brazilian Air Force. The name of the facility was changed to Santa Cruz Air Force Base on 16 January 1943. On 3 May 1982 a British Avro Vulcan bomber was intercepted by the aircraft of the 1¬∞ Grupo de Avia√ß√£o de Ca√ßa (1¬∫GAvCa) based at Santa Cruz. The Vulcan had finished the Operation Black Buck 6 during the Falklands War and was returning to Ascension Island when it suffered technical problems. It was intercepted upon entering Brazilian airspace and made to land at the Gale√£o Air Force Base. The Brazilian aircraft flew back to Santa Cruz having successfully accomplished the first interception mission in their history. Units The following units are based at Santa Cruz Air Force Base: Subordinated to the command of the 2nd Air Force (II FAe), which is dedicated to Search and Rescue, Rotorary Wings, and Maritime Patrol: * 4th Squadron of the 7th Aviation Group (4¬∫/7¬∫GAv), the Cardeal Squadron, using P-95A (Embraer EMB 111 Bandeirante Patrulha) aircraft for Maritime Patrol Missions. Subordinated to the command of the 3rd Air Force (III FAe), which is dedicated to Reconnaissance, Attack, and Combat: * 1st Group of Combat Aviation (1¬∫GAvCa), comprising the 1¬∞/1¬∞GAvCa ‚Äì Jambock Squadron and the 2¬∞/1¬∞GAvCa ‚Äì Pif-paf Squadron, both using the Northrop F-5E Tiger II supersonic fighter aircraft. They are currently being replaced by the F-5EM, an up-graded version of the F-5E made by Embraer in partnership with the Israeli Elbit. The 1st GAvCa also operates one A-29 (Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano) light attack aircraft. All aircraft are for attack missions. * 1st Squadron of the 16th Aviation Group (1¬∫/16¬∫GAv), the Adelphi Squadron, using the A-1A and A-1B (AMX International AMX) aircraft for attack, combat, and reconnaissance missions. In 1989 the Adelphi Squadron was the first unit of FAB to receive the A-1. Subordinated to the command of the Department of Airspace Control (DECEA), which is dedicated to the control of the Brazilian Airspace: * 1st Squadron of the 1st Communications and Control Group (1¬∫/1¬∫GCC), the Profeta Squadron, using radars and equipment for air defense. Additionally, the base has one U-7A (Embraer EMB 810 Seneca) and two U-42 (Neiva Regente) for administrative missions. Access The base is located 54 km from Rio de Janeiro downtown in the district of Santa Cruz.

In January 2015, Zomato, an India-based restaurant search and discovery service, acquired Urbanspoon. The Urbanspoon website and Seattle business operation initially evolved with addition of content team workers for door-to-door data collection of restaurant information, an operational design that had served Zomato well in India. However, Zomato discontinued the Urbanspoon website on June 1, 2015, redirecting Urbanspoon traffic to Zomato servers; at the same time, Urbanspoon's logo was incorporated into a new Zomato logo. Zomato ceased earlier Urbanspoon app development, leading to departure of all Seattle engineers by August 2015. Mid-October 2015, multiple U.S. Zomato (previously Urbanspoon) offices were closed, including the former corporate headquarters in Seattle. Business reports as of October 2015 indicate either that Zomato- Urbanspoon has ceased all U.S. operations, or that it will retain a couple of sites, including Dallas, the new site of Zomato's U.S. administrative functions. Services Urbanspoon was a restaurant information and recommendation service that operated in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It offered services via its website and standard apps for mobile operating systems.Shu, Catherine (2015). \\"Windows Phone 8 gets Pandora Radio, Cut the Rope, Urbanspoon and more (Update: Full List),\\" at Engadget (online, October 10), see , accessed 23 May 2015.

Via its apps and webpage, Urbanspoon offered a restaurant search utility, with filtering by price, type of food, neighborhood, nearby businesses (movie theaters, sports venues, etc.), and special features (gluten-free fare, child-friendliness, BYOB-service, etc.). Users could then participate in the simple \\"like\\" or \\"don't like\\" rating system to review restaurants, and share restaurant information with friends via email, Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and Pinterest, and by photo pages. Users who create an account could track dining experiences (menu items, price of meal, and photos), and could create a \\"Wishlist\\" to save restaurants for future use and a \\"Guide\\" to share personal lists of dining favorites. In addition, the Urbanspoon app featured a \\"Slot Machine,\\" allowing users to \\"Spin\\" (or shake their device) to randomly see a new eating establishment based on neighborhood, cuisine, or price. The Urbanspoon website evolved in response to the Zomato acquisition, adding content based on the work of new team workers doing door-to-door data collection of restaurant information (menus, hours, etc.), an operational design that had served Zomato well in India.Demmitt, Jacob (2015). \\"Zomato makes widespread job cuts, closes Seattle office after shutting down Urbanspoon,\\" GeekWire (online, October 15), see , accessed 27 November 2015.

Its location has been based since its inception in Seattle, Washington, where the company was founded. Operations after Zomato acquisition Urbanspoon offered Zomato an annual user base estimated to be approximately 31 million in early 2015 based on app downloads, and a directory of >1 million restaurants; Zomato's intention, based on information from its CEO, Deepinder Goyal, as reported by John Cook of GeekWire, is to give the company \\"a nice footprint\\" as it expands in preparation to \\"battle industry heavyweight Yelp.\\"Cook, John (2015), \\"Zomato confirms acquisition of Urbanspoon, plans to phase out brand as it looks to pick fight with Yelp,\\" GeekWire (online, January 12), see , accessed 23 May 2015.

These visible changes came alongside Zomato's business decision to cease app development, which led 12 engineers (two-thirds of its Seattle engineering workforce at time of acquisition) to leave between January and August 2015; the remaining engineers were laid off on August 6.Soper, Taylor (2015). \\"Zomato lays off Urbanspoon engineering team 7 months after acquisition,\\" GeekWire (online, August 6), see , accessed 27 November 2015. Further extensive cuts in the U.S. workforce were made in mid-October 2015, with the closing of multiple U.S. Zomato (previously Urbanspoon) offices, including the former corporate headquarters in Seattle. This layoff of the remainder of what was a workforce of 150 in the U.S., at San Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Philadelphia, and New York offices, led former employees to report that the company has ceased all U.S. operations, with a Zomato source refining the report to say that some workers will be retained at a couple of sites, including Dallas, the new site of Zomato's U.S. administrative functions.

The treaty defined the areas of Castilian and Portuguese influence in Asia, in order to resolve the \\"Moluccas issue\\", which had arisen because both kingdoms claimed the Moluccas Islands for themselves, asserting that they were within their area of influence as specified in 1494 by the Treaty of Tordesillas. The conflict began in 1520, when expeditions of both kingdoms reached the Pacific Ocean, because no agreed meridian of longitude had been established in the Orient.  Background: the Moluccas issue  In 1494 Castile and Portugal signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, dividing the world into two areas of exploration and colonisation: the Castilian and the Portuguese. It established a meridian in the Atlantic Ocean, with areas west of the line exclusive to Spain, and east of the line to Portugal. In 1511, Malacca, then the centre of Asian trade, was conquered for Portugal by Afonso de Albuquerque. Getting to know the secret location of the so-called \\"spice islands\\" ‚Äì the Banda Islands, Ternate and Tidore in the Moluccas (modern Indonesia), then the single world source of nutmeg and cloves, and the main purpose for the European explorations in the Indian Ocean ‚Äì Albuquerque sent an expedition led by Ant√≥nio de Abreu in search of the Moluccas, particularly the Banda Islands. The expedition arrived in early 1512, passing en route through the Lesser Sunda Islands, being the first Europeans to get there.Hannard (1991), page 7; Before reaching Banda, the explorers visited the islands of Buru, Ambon and Seram. Later, after a separation forced by a shipwreck, Abreu's vice-captain Francisco Serr√£o sailed to the north and, but his ship sank off Ternate, where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the .

On 6 November 1521, the Moluccas, \\"the cradle of all spices\\", were reached from the east by Magellan's fleet, sailing then under Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano, at the service of the Spanish Crown. Before Magellan and Serr√£o could meet in the Moluccas, Serr√£o died on the island of Ternate, almost at the same time Magellan was killed in the battle of Mactan in the Philippines.Duarte Barbosa; Mansel Longworth Dames; Fern√£o de Magalh√£es.

New Delhi: After the Magellan‚ÄìElcano expedition (1519‚Äì1522), Charles V sent a second expedition, led by Garc√≠a Jofre de Loa√≠sa, to colonise the islands, based on the assertion that they were in the Castilian zone, under the Treaty of Tordesillas.The expedition of Garc√≠a Jofre de Loa√≠sa (1525‚Äì1526) aimed to occupy and colonise the Moluccas. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men included the most notable Spanish navigators: Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano, who lost his life in this expedition, and the young Andr√©s de Urdaneta. After some difficulties, the expedition reached the Moluccas, docking at Tidore, where the Spanish established a fort. There was inevitable conflict with the Portuguese, who were already established in Ternate. After a year of fighting, the Spanish suffered a defeat but, despite that, nearly a decade of skirmishes over the possession of the islands ensued. Map of the Moluccas, showing Ternate and Tidore  Conference of Badajoz‚ÄìElvas  In 1524, both kingdoms organised the \\"Junta de Badajoz‚ÄìElvas\\" to resolve the dispute. Each crown appointed three astronomers and cartographers, three pilots and three mathematicians, who formed a committee to establish the exact location of the antimeridian of Tordesillas, and the intention was to divide the whole world into two equal hemispheres. The Portuguese delegation sent by King Jo√£o III included Ant√≥nio de Azevedo Coutinho, Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, Lopo Homem, a cartographer and cosmographer, and Sim√£o Fernandes. The plenipotentiary from Portugal was Mercurio G√¢tine, and those from Spain were Count Mercurio G√¢tine, Garcia de Loaysa, Bishop of Osma, and Garc√≠a de Padilla, grand master of the Order of Calatrava. Former Portuguese cartographer Diogo Ribeiro, was part of the Spanish delegation.The records of the committee, held in the Portuguese national archive at Torre do Tombo, include a letter written by Lopo Homem, Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer, alluding to the quarrel between the two kingdoms over the sovereign rights of each. An amusing story is said to have taken place at this meeting. According to contemporary Castilian writer Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, a small boy stopped the Portuguese delegation and asked if they intended to divide up the world.

The board met several times, at Badajoz and Elvas, without reaching an agreement. Geographic knowledge at that time was inadequate for an accurate assignment of longitude, and each group chose maps or globes that showed the islands to be in their own hemisphere.As an example of this partiality, the chief advisor to Charles V, Jean Carondelet, possessed a globe by Franciscus Monachus which showed the islands in the Spanish hemisphere. John III and Charles V agreed to not send anyone else to the Moluccas until it was established in whose hemisphere they were situated. Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions to the area around the Moluccas. Gomes de Sequeira and Diogo da Rocha were sent by the governor of Ternate Jorge de Meneses to the Celebes (also already visited by Sim√£o de Abreu in 1523) and to the north. The expeditioners were the first Europeans to reach the Caroline Islands, which they named \\"Islands de Sequeira \\".Antonio Galvano, Richard Hakluyt, C R Drinkwater Bethune, The discoveries of the world: from their original unto the year of our Lord 1555, The Hakluyt Society, 1862, a partir da tradu√ß√£o inglesa de 1601 da edi√ß√£o portuguesa em Lisboa, 1563There is a much-disputed theory that Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa (1522) and Gomes de Sequeira (1525) were the first Europeans to discover Australia. Explorers such as Martim Afonso de Melo (1522-24), and possible Gomes de Sequeira (1526-1527), sighted the Aru Islands and the Tanimbar Islands.Luis Filipe F. R. Thomaz, The image of the Archipelago in Portuguese cartography of the 16th and early 17th centuries, Persee, 1995, Volume 49 pages: 56 In 1526 Jorge de Meneses reached northwestern Papua New Guinea, landing in Biak in the Schouten Islands, and from there he sailed to Waigeo on the Bird's Head Peninsula. On the other hand, in addition to the Loa√≠sa expedition from Spain to the Moluccas (1525-1526), the Castilians sent an expedition there via the Pacific, led by √Ålvaro de Saavedra Cer√≥n (1528) (prepared by Hern√°n Cort√©s in Mexico), in order to compete with the Portuguese in the region. Members of the Garcia Jofre de Loa√≠sa expedition were taken prisoner by the Portuguese, who returned the survivors to Europe by the western route. √Ålvaro de Saavedra Cer√≥n reached the Marshall Islands, and in two failed attempts to return from the Moluccas via the Pacific, explored part of west and northern New Guinea, also reaching the Schouten Islands and sighting Yapen, as well as the Admiralty Islands and the Carolines. On 10 February 1525, Charles V's younger sister Catherine of Austria married John III of Portugal, and on 11 March 1526, Charles V married king John's sister Isabella of Portugal. These crossed weddings strengthened the ties between the two crowns, facilitating an agreement regarding the Moluccas. It was in the interests of the emperor to avoid conflict, so that he could focus on his European policy, and the Spaniards did not know then how to get spices from the Moluccas to Europe via the eastern route. The Manila-Acapulco route was only established by Andr√©s de Urdaneta in 1565.  Treaty  The Treaty of Zaragoza laid down that the eastern border between the two domain zones was leagues (1,763 kilometres, 952 nautical miles), or 17¬∞ east, of the Maluku Islands.Emma Helen Blair, The Philippine Islands, 1493-1803, part 3 The treaty included a safeguard clause which stated that the deal would be undone if at any time the emperor wished to revoke it, with the Portuguese being reimbursed the money they had to pay, and each nation \\"will have the right and the action as that is now.\\" That never happened however, because the emperor desperately needed the Portuguese money to finance the War of the League of Cognac against his archrival Francis I of France. The treaty did not clarify or modify the line of demarcation established by the Treaty of Tordesillas, nor did it validate Spain's claim to equal hemispheres (180¬∞ each), so the two lines divided the Earth into unequal portions. Portugal's portion was roughly 191¬∞ of the Earth's circumference, whereas Spain's portion was roughly 169¬∞. There was a ¬±4¬∞ margin of uncertainty as to the exact size of both portions, due to the variation of opinion about the precise location of the Tordesillas line. Under the treaty, Portugal gained control of all lands and seas west of the line, including all of Asia and its neighbouring islands so far \\"discovered\\", leaving Spain with most of the Pacific Ocean. Although the Philippines was not mentioned in the treaty, Spain implicitly relinquished any claim to it because it was well west of the line. Nevertheless, by 1542, King Charles V had decided to colonise the Philippines, assuming that Portugal would not protest too vigorously because the archipelago had no spices. Although he failed in his attempt, King Philip II succeeded in 1565, establishing the initial Spanish trading post at Manila. As his father had expected, there was little opposition from the Portuguese. In later times, Portuguese colonization in Brazil extended far west of the line defined in the Treaty of Tordesillas and into what would have been Spanish territory under the treaty.

Casino and Brewery (formerly Foxy's Firehouse) was a locals casino and microbrewery on South Las Vegas Boulevard, north of the Las Vegas Strip, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The property began in 1955 as Foxy's Deli, which operated until its closure in 1975. A year later, the building was reopened as a casino named Foxy's Firehouse, which later closed in 1988. Tom \\"Big Dog\\" Wiesner purchased the building and reopened it as the Holy Cow casino in 1992. Wiesner added a microbrewery the following year, making the Holy Cow the first brewery to open in Las Vegas. Wiesner persuaded the state to change its laws that had prohibited breweries from operating in Las Vegas. The brewery won several awards for its beers, although the property ultimately closed in March 2002, because of a decline in tourism caused by the September 11 attacks. During 2005, the building was used as a sales office for two separate high- rise condominium projects, including the Ivana Las Vegas, which was to replace the Holy Cow before ultimately being cancelled later that year. The Holy Cow was demolished in April 2012, and construction of a two-story Walgreens store began on the property in 2014. History The property began as Foxy's Deli, opened by Abe Fox (19142004) in April 1955. The deli was the first restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip to allow black people, and was popular among celebrities, local business leaders, and tourists for its fresh food that was flown in from Los Angeles on a daily basis. The deli closed in 1975, after Fox sold it. A year later, the building became Foxy's Firehouse casino, which subsequently closed in 1988. In 1989, Tom \\"Big Dog\\" Wiesner and his partners sold the Marina Hotel to Kirk Kerkorian. Wiesner used the money from the hotel sale to purchase the closed Foxy Firehouse casino. Wiesner reopened the two- story building as the Holy Cow! in March 1992. A microbrewery was added a year later. The Holy Cow was the first microbrewery to open in Las Vegas. Prior to that time, long-standing laws had prevented breweries from operating in the city. However, Wiesner persuaded the state to change its laws to allow the operation of local breweries. The Holy Cow operated as part of Wiesner's Big Dog's Hospitality Group, which consisted of a chain of local bar-restaurants. The Holy Cow was known for its 14-foot-tall fiberglass Holstein cow statue, which wore sunglasses and rested atop the building's front entrance. The building's exterior featured murals of spotted black-and-white Wisconsin milk cows. At one point, Harry Caray, the announcer of the Chicago Cubs who was known for his saying \\"Holy cow!\\" during broadcasts, visited the Holy Cow Casino and Brewery and autographed a wall of the club with his signature saying. In June 1996, plans were announced to renovate the building and rename it as Chicago-Chicago Casino, while retaining the brewery. The Holy Cow's casino was to be expanded, and a restaurant named Big Dog's Chop House was to be added. In 1998, Zagat included the Holy Cow on its list of \\"America's Best Meal Deals\\". The Holy Cow suffered from a decline of tourism caused by the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The Holy Cow closed on March 22, 2002, with the exception of the brewery, which continued to operate. Big Dog's Hospitality Group planned to ultimately move brewing operations to the company's Draft House Barn & Casino in North Las Vegas. The property's 14-foot cow statue was sold for $2,200 to Jim Marsh, who owned several casinos and automobile dealerships in Nevada. Marsh set the cow statue up at his Longstreet hotel-casino in Amargosa Valley, Nevada. =Later development= In 2004, plans were announced to replace the Holy Cow with a $700 million, 940-foot condominium tower called The Summit, to be financed by Australian developer Victor Altomare. By January 2005, the Holy Cow had been converted into a $1 million sales office for Altomare's other condominium project, Liberty Tower. Later in 2005, Ivana Trump became associated with The Summit, which was renamed as Ivana Las Vegas. Trump added pink awnings to the Holy Cow building when it was reopened as a temporary sales office for Ivana Las Vegas, which was ultimately cancelled later that year. In September 2007, Steven Johnson, a real estate developer from Arizona, purchased the property for $47 million through his company, Aspen Highlands Holdings, LLC. Many of Johnson's properties in Las Vegas were developed into Walgreens stores, although he said that he had not decided on his plans for the Holy Cow property. By April 2008, a Walgreens store was being planned for the property. Because of the high cost for the land, Johnson hoped to sell the air rights to the property, allowing others to construct a casino and high-rise hotel or condominium project atop the Walgreens store. In June 2009, Aspen Highlands was planning a gaming and retail center on the property that would be similar to Times Square. The new project would include a two-story center with of floor space and a casino, along with a restaurant, a tavern, and a Walgreens. Aspen Highlands planned to have the Holy Cow demolished once the new project was approved, with a planned opening in fall 2010. The new project would be designed by Albuquerque architect George Rainhart, and would include a 137-foot half-moon shaped welcome sign that would mark the gateway to Las Vegas city limits. A 547-foot sign had initially been proposed, but was withdrawn for the time as it was considered uneconomical to build and had been opposed by the Las Vegas Planning Commission because of its height. In July 2009, Aspen Highlands received approval from the Planning Commission for the project. Also approved was a 98-foot-tall, 11,210-square-foot sign and video screen. The project received further approval from the Las Vegas City Council in August 2009. The Holy Cow building was demolished in late April 2012. In 2014, construction began on a two-story Walgreens store on the former property of the Holy Cow.  Beers  The brewery had a capacity of 2,200 bbl per year. In 1993, the Holy Cow! won a gold medal for its classic English pale ale, followed by bronze medals in 1994 and 1996 for its red ale and Black Lab stout respectively. In June 1997, the Holy Cow!'s Amber Gambler was among the top named beers at the Las Vegas International Beer Festival, where over 100 handcrafted beers from across the United States were sampled. The brewery had also won awards from the Great American Beer Festival. By March 1998, the 800th batch of Holy Cow beer had been brewed. At the time of the Holy Cow!'s closure, the brewery had supplied beer to five other properties owned by Big Dog's Hospitality Group.

He was president of the Pontifical Academy for Life, director of the international medical ethics journal Medicina e Morale, president of the Ut Vitam Habeant Foundation and the Donum Vitae Association of the Diocese of Rome, and honorary president of the International Federation of Bioethics Centers and Institutes of Personalist Inspiration (FIBIP). Early life Sgreccia was the youngest of six children born to an agricultural family. He was born and raised in Nidastore, a small town in the Comune of Arcevia in the Province of Ancona in the Marche region located in central-eastern Italy. His entry into the seminary was delayed by the start of World War II, so he continued to assist his family in the fields and attended a vocational school in the meantime. Church life Sgreccia entered the seminary in Fano and was ordained a priest on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul: 29 June 1952. Sgreccia first served as a spiritual minister to the youth of Catholic Action. He completed university degrees in classical letters, philosophy, and theology, and worked as a professor, vice rector, and rector at Pius XI Pontifical Regional Seminary in Fano until 1972, when he became vicar general of the Diocese of Fossombrone. On 5 November 1992, Pope John Paul II appointed him Titular Bishop of Zama Minor and secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Family, where he served until his resignation in April 1996. He was consecrated as a bishop on 6 January 1993 by Pope John Paul II. In 2004, he became president of the Ut Vitam Habeant Foundation and the Donum Vitae Association of the Diocese of Rome. In one of his last appointments, Pope John Paul II named him president of the Pontifical Academy for Life on 3 January 2005, a post he held until his age-induced resignation was accepted on 17 June 2008. He was one of four prelates over the age of 80, known for their distinguished contributions to Catholicism, whom Pope Benedict XVI elevated to the rank of cardinal in the consistory on 20 November 2010. Sgreccia was made cardinal deacon of Sant'Angelo in Pescheria and was installed on 12 March 2011. Bioethics From 1974 to 1984 Sgreccia served as a spiritual minister at the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, where he was involved with the spiritual formation of health care professionals and the investigation of biomedical moral issues. In 1984 he became a bioethics instructor at the same university. In 1985 he founded the university's Bioethics Center, with a focus on clinical ethics, and served as director until 2006. In the 1980s he was an observer for the Holy See on the Ad Hoc Committee of Experts on Bioethics (CAHBI) of the Council of Europe. In 1990 he became a full professor at the university and joined Italy's Comitato Nazionale per la Bioetica (National Bioethics Committee), where he contributed to its many expert opinions until 2006. In 1992 he was appointed director of the university's Institute of Bioethics, with a focus on research, and served until 2000. His work at the Bioethics Center and the Institute of Bioethics at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart entailed close involvement with the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic, the university's teaching hospital. Sgreccia became a member of the Committee for Guidelines on Genetic Counseling and Testing of Italy's Ministry of Health in 2001. In 2003, he founded the International Federation of Bioethics Centers and Institutions of Personalist Inspiration (Federazione Internazionale dei centri ed istituti di Bioetica di Ispirazione Personalista, FIBIP). Sgreccia authored Manuale di bioetica ('Manual of bioethics'), presenting a reason-based philosophical approach to bioethics that dovetails with the natural law and the moral teachings of the Catholic Church. He referred to his approach as \\"ontologically grounded personalism\\", which applies a three-point or \\"triangular\\" method of scientific data, philosophical anthropology and reason-based claims of moral obligation for action in order to make ethical judgments. It was first published by Vita e Pensiero in 1986 with the title Bioetica. Manuale per medici e biologi (Bioethics: A manual for physicians and biologists). Its first edition under the definitive title Manuale di bioetica was published in two volumes in 1988. The fourth Italian edition was published in 2007. It has been reprinted numerous times and has been published in whole or in part in roughly ten different languages, including Spanish, French, and Russian. The first complete English edition of Volume I was published by The National Catholic Bioethics Center in 2012 as Personalist Bioethics: Foundations and Applications. On 25 March 2011, Sgreccia received an honorary doctorate from the Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum in Rome, whose faculty of bioethics was the first in higher education to offer a complete degree program in bioethics: bachelor, licentiate (master) and doctorate. Death Sgreccia died on 5 June 2019 in his home in Rome, aged 90. His funeral was held on 7 June 2019 in St. Peter's Basilica and was presided over by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, Vice-Dean of the College of Cardinals. Pope Francis also led the rite of final commendation and farewell. Publications Sgreccia published some 400 works in Italian and various other languages. Some of his works include: * Sgreccia, Elio.

The church is considered to be an important transitional work between the more sober or moderate Baroque style of the 17th century and the extremely decorated manifestations of the Baroque of the 18th century in Mexico. Located at the corner of Madero and Isabel la Cat√≥lica Streets in Mexico City, diagonally opposite the Museo del Estanquillo, its original name was \\"La Iglesia de la Casa Profesa.\\" This church is well known for being the site of a number of historical events, including the \\"La Profesa Conspiracy,\\" which was instrumental in bringing Agust√≠n de Iturbide to power and the \\"Polkos Rebellion\\". More recently, this church was the scene for deliberations relating to the beatification of Juan Diego. The church is also noted for its very large collection of colonial-era artworks spanning three centuries by some of Mexico's best artists including Crist√≥bal de Villalpando, Juan Correa, Pellegr√≠ Clav√© and Jos√© de Alc√≠bar. History =Establishment of the church= Nave and altar of church The first Jesuit priests did not arrive to Mexico until 1572. By this time, most of the missionary work in central Mexico had been completed by other orders, such as the Augustinians and the Dominicans. Nonetheless, the Jesuits established their professed houseThe professed are all Jesuit priests, who make, besides the three solemn vows of poverty, obedience and chastity, a final Fourth Vow, of special obedience to the Pope in the matter of missions, undertaking to go wherever they are sent. here in 1578 and later a church, using property purchased from Fernando Noriega just to the west of the Z√≥calo in Mexico City. This causes a legal dispute with orders that were already there, as the Franciscans, Dominican and Augustinians, who considered the land within their jurisdiction, but the Jesuits won in 1595. The house was called \\"Casa Profesa.\\" The first church was funded primarily by Alonso de Villaseca‚Äîcommonly known as the \\"creso mexicano\\" (Mexican Croesus)‚Äîwith donations from Fernando N√∫√±ez de Obreg√≥n and Juan Luis de Rivera. This church was built between 1597 and 1610 with Juan P√©rez de Soto as architect.Juan P√©rez de Soto was the father of Melchor P√©rez de Soto, born in 1606. See and The first church was consecrated on 31 July 1610, the feast day of the recently beatified Saint Ignatius of Loyola. It was given the name of \\"Church of the Professed House\\" ( (, but commonly this name was shortened to \\"La Profesa\\"). This church was nearly completely destroyed by the Great Flood of 1629 in Mexico City. All that remains of the original construction as part of the current building is the Moorish-style roof, which can be seen in the prolongation of the choir towards the side naves. The church was rebuilt in 1714, with the patronage of with Gertrudis de la Pe√±a, Marquesa de las Torres de Rada, and designed by Pedro de Arrieta. =Expulsion of the Jesuits= Over time, the Jesuits embellished the church and their living quarters with paintings, sculptures and other ornaments, gathering a large collection of religious art. In 1767, the Jesuits were expelled from Spain and all Spanish-held lands. The La Profesa Church, along with a number of other Jesuit properties in the city, were turned over to the vice-royalty. The church, cloisters and temple that was under construction at the time were then granted to the priests of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri. The name of the church was changed to San Jos√© el Real. However, the church continued to be popularly known as \\"La Profesa.\\" Decades later, the Jesuits were able to return to Mexico. When the Jesuits regained possession of the church, a building called the \\"Casa de Ejercicios\\" () was begun and shortly thereafter expanded by Manuel Tols√°, who also redecorated the interior of the church. All this work was finished in 1802. In 1855, the declaration of the Immaculate Conception as a Roman Catholic church dogma the previous year was celebrated here, an event commemorated by an oil painting that is now at the National Museum of History in Chapultepec. The Reform Laws of 1861 forced the abandonment of La Profesa's monastery, which was then demolished in 1862 to make way for 5 de Mayo Street. The Casa de Ejercicios was temporarily converted into the Hotel Colon. =19th century to present= Madero Street facade In 1914, a severe fire destroyed the cupola paintings done by Pelegr√≠ Clav√©, who had painted the seven sacraments, and \\"The Triumph of the Holy Cross\\" on the eight sides of the cupola. The only work saved from that fire was done in 1861 which represents the blessing of Creation situated in the door of the small lantern at the very top of the cupola. Later in the century, this church was the scene of meetings of historians, theologians and other researchers during the beatification process of Juan Diego. The church was declared a historical monument in 1932 and again in 1980. The church building has also seen a number of works to correct damage from its sinking into the soft soil of Mexico City and has had its facade on Madero Street restored. It is favored by elegant weddings, particularly since it is half a block from the Casino Espa√±ol. Description of the church Two paintings inside the church The building that stands today is the church that was rebuilt in 1720 by Pedro de Arrieta to replace the church nearly destroyed by the 1629 flood. All that remains of the original 16th-century church is a portion of the roof. The new version mixes elements of 17th and 18th century architecture, and for this reason, La Profesa is considered to be a precursor of much of the architecture of Mexico City in the 18th century. Elements present in this church that would later mark 18th century works include an octagonal window in the choir area with multiple mouldings to decorate it and a recessed facade with steps leading up to the main portal. Older elements include the Latin cross floor plan with three naves and an octagonal cupola. The recessed facade is covered in tezontle with fillets of cantera (a grey-white stone). Above the main portal there is a relief done in cantera which depicts the apparition of a cross-bearing Christ to Saint Ignatius of Loyola, flanked by statues of Saint Gertrude and Saint Barbara. Between this and the main doors is an ogee arch supported by two columns which are simple Classic on the first level but show elaborate vegetative decoration on the second level. The side portal, which faces Madero Street, has a central niche containing an image of Ignatius of Loyola. Overall, the church is considered to be an important transitional work between the more sober or moderate Baroque style of the 17th century and the extremely decorated manifestations of the Baroque of the 18th century in Mexico. The original altar of this church was done by Pedro Pati√±o Ixtolinque, but it was replaced in 1799 by the Neoclassic one by Manuel Tols√° that is seen today. It is dedicated to Saint Philip Neri. The columns inside the church are somewhat Gothic in style but what stands out in the church's interior decoration is the artwork. Statues on each side of the entrance depict the Virgin of the Rosary and the Vision of Saint Teresa, both by Cristobal de Villapando and, like the church, are considered to be transitional Baroque works. A later sculpture by Manuel Tols√° of the Immaculate Conception is in the right-hand corridor. The church also possesses a reliquary that is claimed to contain splinters of the cross of Jesus. This church possesses a very large collection of colonial-era paintings with religious themes, only a fraction of which are displayed in the church proper. These include a painting of the Crucifixion by Jos√© Ju√°rez above the Altar of Perpetuo Socorro. \\"The Virgin of the P√≥pulo\\" by Juan Correa, and an anonymous oil of the crowning of Christ with thorns. One of the oldest and most valuable works is attributed to Baltasar de Echave Orio depicting the Pentecost. The sacristy and the Chapel of the Virgin of Guadalupe also contain valuable paintings. However, most of the La Profesa's collection is on display at an art gallery adjoining the church. \\"La Profesa\\" in Mexican history In the 19th and 20th centuries, a number of historical events have been connected to this church. In the early part of the 19th century, during the Mexican War of Independence, the movement known as the \\"La Profesa Conspiracy\\" took shape here. This was a conservative movement led by Mat√≠as Monteagudo, director of the Casa de Ejercicios of La Profesa, Jos√© Antonio Tirado and Miguel Bataller. Those associated with this conspiracy favored absolute rule rather than republican government and were against the Spanish Constitution of 1812. This movement was instrumental to the coronation of Agust√≠n de Iturbide becoming emperor of Mexico after the war ended in 1821. Another political movement association associated with the church was called the \\"Polkos Rebellion.\\" This occurred when two regiments of young aristocrats refused to defend the port city of Veracruz from the 1847 U.S. invasion. The term \\"Polkos\\" comes from their tacit support of President of the United States James K. Polk and from being associated with dancing polkas at fashionable parties. Legend has it that these men served banquets in the patio of La Profesa during the uprising. Art collection For much of its history, La Profesa had strong influence over the fine arts in Mexico. Both the Jesuits and the brothers of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri embellished the church and its accompanying buildings with a large number of paintings and other artworks. After the Reform Laws closed the monastery and converted the non-church buildings to other uses, this church lost its influence on the arts. The building that was known as the \\"Casa de Ejercicios\\" () eventually became an art gallery to house the church's vast collection and make them available to the public. This gallery contains works by Cristobal de Villalpando, Juan Correa, Pellegr√≠ Clav√© and many others. The collection is divided among four rooms, each with a different focus. In the first room are all the paintings that were commissioned by the Jesuits before the church passed into the hand of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri. Among these is a tablet which was probably done by Alonso L√≥pez de Herrero with a representation of Saint Francis Borgia. Also there are two enormous anonymous paintings depicting Ignatius of Loyola and the death of Saint Francis Xavier. Another painting is of the Virgin of the Jesuits by Francisco Mart√≠nez, who was better known for gold-leaf work, such as that done of the Altar of the Kings in the Metropolitan Cathedral. There are two works depicting the martyrdom of two Jesuits in Japan, very close in style to Jos√© de P√°ez, and lastly, a painting of Nicolas Enriquez with Ignatius of Loyola at the Manresa Cave, which has a description of the location. The second room is named for Cardinal Newman. It contains all the paintings associated with the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri. This gallery contains the portraits of eleven popes with ties to this brotherhood. Another series of paintings here depicts the life of Saint Philip Neri and is attributed to Antonio de Torres. At the head of this room is an enormous painting titled \\"Patrocinio de San Jos√© a los felipenses\\" done by Jos√© de Alc√≠bar in 1767. This painting was commissioned to the patron saint of this order because for a seven-year span, no member of the order here died. The painting contains a series of faces of real members of the order here at that time. The third room is called \\"Three centuries of painting in Mexico\\" with paintings by various artists from the 17th to the 19th centuries. The exhibit begins with a painting of Saint Ursula and her companions. It next moves to a series of paintings by Cristob√°l de Villalpando, among which are \\"Scenes of the life of Joseph, son of Jacob,\\" \\"Los Desposorios\\", \\"Saint Jerome\\" and a portrait of archbishop Francisco de Aguilar y Seijas, which is probably the only portrait ever done by this artist. Although it is not signed, the painting \\"Vision of Saint Vincent Ferrer,\\" is also here and attributed to Villalpando. The collection in this room also contains three works by Juan Correa, such as \\"La Dormici√≥n de la Virgen,\\" but they are not considered among his best works. Other paintings include a depiction of the Prophet Elijah by Antonio Rodriguez and of the Prophet Isaiah by Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez Ju√°rez. One other painting of note is the \\"Padre Eterno\\" of Pelegr√≠ Clav√©, the only work to survive a fire that engulfed the La Profesa Church in 1912. The left-hand wall of the room is covered with a mural with scenes of the Passion of Christ, with figures almost of natural size. This mural was done by a number of artists, including Cristob√°l de Villalpando. The last room is dedicated to works that, because of their theme, were mostly likely part of the collection that belonged to the buildings when it was the Casa de Ejercicios. The collection begins with a portrait of Joaqu√≠n de Aldama, who donated 300,000 pesos to the construction of this particular building. Next are a number of anonymous paintings with scenes of the Passion of Christ. There are two large works representing the torments and punishments of hell and the final judgment the just and unjust, both done by Miguel Correa.

Life  He was born on March 29, 1889 as Constantin Nicholas Astafieff in Voronezh, Russia. He had his art education in Russia. He married Olga Trofimoff, on May 17, 1916 in Crimea, Russia. When the Soviet revolution happened in 1917 the region had a lot of conflicts and did not support the revolution. This was not a good time for the newly married couple so they decided to escape to Constantinople (presently Istanbul). Once they moved to Turkey they changed their name to Astori to start a new life with a new name. Constantin Astori spent his years in Istanbul painting street scenes. He was particularly interested in mosques with minarets and old Istanbul streets with people. He experimented pastels and charcoal. The art world in Istanbul was limited and not intriguing. The couple first thought about moving to Paris then decided to move to New York. On October 1, 1923 he immigrated to the United States of America, while his wife Olga moved to Paris. She joined her husband three years later, in 1926. Astori settled in New York City and tried to get into the art world. He worked as an art restorer for various museums. He became naturalized US citizen in 1936. From the 1930s to the 1940s he restored art works for the Smithsonian Institution and Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum. In 1940 he was commissioned to paint a mural for American Natural Museum in New York. He completed the mural, which depicted pterosaurs, the same year. This mural is still over the stairs in the museum. Later in 1970 this mural was used in the album cover of Dinosaur Swamp by the band called the Flock (band). He participated to various art shows but never realized his dream of becoming a famous artist. He experimented with black and white drawings of New York street scenes. Later in his life he was more interested in pastels depicting serene country scenes. His wife Olga died on January 23, 1975, he died the same year on June 11, 1975. The couple had no children. His artwork can be found in art dealers internationally.

Clark is a fiber artist known for using a variety of materials including human hair and combs to address race, culture, class, and history. Her beaded headdress assemblages and braided wig series of the late 1990s, which received critical acclaim, evoked African traditions of personal adornment and moved these common forms into the realm of personal and political expression. Although African art and her Caribbean background are important influences, Clark also builds on practices of assemblage and accumulation used by artists such as Betye Saar and David Hammons.  Biography  Clark's father who was a psychiatrist from Trinidad of Yoruba descent while her mother was a nurse from Jamaica. Clark was influenced by the craftspeople in her family, including a grandmother who worked as a tailor, and a grandfather who was a furniture maker. Clark's personal connection to the comb began like that of nearly every young girl, squirming on a chair while an adult armed with a comb and good intentions attempted to bring order to the disorder on her head.  Education  Clark holds an MFA from Cranbrook Academy of Art and in 2011 was honored with their first Distinguished Mid- Career Alumni Award. She has a BFA from the Art Institute of Chicago where she studied under the artist Nick Cave (performance artist) and a BA in psychology from Amherst College in 1989, where she also received an honorary doctorate in 2015. She graduated from the Sidwell Friends School in 1985. Clark cites professor Rowland O. Abiodun, Amherst College as an early influence in her studies of the connection between her Caribbean culture and Yoruba culture, which was further enhanced by a post-graduation trip to the Ivory Coast, where she learned to weave on a hand loom. Clark also cites Nick Cave as instrumental in furthering her investigations in fiber.  Professional academic career  Clark is a professor of Art in the department of Art and the History of Art at Amherst College. Between 2006 and 2017, she was chair of the Craft/Material Studies Department and was honored as a Distinguished Research Fellow. In 2016, she was awarded a university-wide Distinguished Scholars Award at the highly acclaimed School of the Arts at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA. The department is ranked by U.S. News and World Report as one of the top in the nation. Prior to her appointment at VCU, she was Baldwin-Bascom Professor of Creative Arts at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she received tenure with distinction and an H.I. Romnes award. Previously, she was Baldwin-Bascom Professor of Creative Arts at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Art career  Clark's work has been exhibited in over 300 museums and galleries in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and throughout the Americas. Her work is in the collection of many museums including the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Delaware Art Museum, Philadelphia Museum of Art and Memphis Brooks Museum. Her work has been favorably reviewed in journals such as Art in America, The New York Times, Sculpture, Surface Design Journal, The Los Angeles Times, Fiber Arts, New American Paintings, Philadelphia Inquirer, Italian Vogue, Hyperallergic, Mother Jones, and Huffington Post.

The poetry and politics of Black hair care specialists are central to my work as an artist and educator. Rooted in a rich legacy, their hands embody an ability to map a head with a comb and manipulate the fiber we grow into a complex form. These artists have mastered a craft impossible for me to take for granted.\\" She claims, \\"hair is power,\\" and, \\"as carrier of DNA, hair holds the essence of identity.\\" ‚ÄúI grew up braiding my hair and my sister's hair, so in one sense, like many black women, I had been preparing to be a textile artist for a very long time.\\" Clark further considered the hair strand as a tool for communication and worked with graphic designer Boquin Peng to create an alphabet based on the curl pattern of her hair. = Flag Project = Clark's explorations with flags began with her thesis Kente Flag Project in 1995.This work is a mixture of elements from African and Western/American culture. She weaves Kente patterns into the design for strength and endurance, advancement and achievement, and prosperity. Since 2009, Clark has created serial projects surrounding the Confederate Battle Flag. She has performed Unraveling in June 2015 at the now-defunct Mixed Greens gallery in New York City and then at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, in October 2016. Her more resent presentation of the exhibit in Louisville Kentucky \\"was the first performance under the current presidential administration and since the country has found itself embroiled in debate over the presence and ramifications of Confederate imagery in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, this past summer.\\" \\"The act is now a part of a larger movement through which state and local governments are dismantling these objects out of a sense of civic duty.\\" During the exhibition, members of the audience are encouraged to join Clark one at a time in the unraveling of a confederate flag while she explains her vision and demonstrates how to pull the strands of the flag apart. According to Goodman, \\"Clark stands side-by- side by participants, shoulder-to-shoulder as they pull each strand of the flag and confront the reality it represents\\". In April 2018, Clark returned to her alma mater, Amherst College, to perform \\"Unravelling\\" at the Mead Art Museum. In 2017, Clark created a hand woven linen cloth reproduction of the white dish towel used by a Confederate soldier to surrender at the Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. This piece is known as \\"Monumental Cloth (sutured)\\". It is the artist's hope that this flag of truce becomes as well known as the Confederate Battle Flag. Both \\"Unravelling\\" and \\"Monumental Cloth (sutured)\\" were on display at the Mead Art Museum from April 5, 2018 to July 1, 2018. Clark reproduced the Truce Flag with the intention of drawing attention back to the flag that brokered and to the Civil War, questioning why symbols of white supremacy, such as the Confederate Battle Flag, are memorialized in favor of symbols of peace.

By 1902 the station had two platforms, two signal boxes, a pedestrian footbridge, the goods yard to the east and a station building with ticket office and waiting room on the southbound platform. Ancillary buildings stood on the east side of the loading dock and sidings. The up platform had a small wooden shelter.Banffshire Sheet XIX.SE (includes: Botriphnie) Publication date: 1905. Date revised: 1902. In 1967 the passing loop was lifted and the signal boxes were closed. The wooden station building was a Great North of Scotland Railway design however the old wooden footbridge had been replaced by a LNER metal design fabricated from old rails and signal wire.McKenzie, Ian and Coull, Alistair. (2016). The Whisky Line. A Guide to the Keith and Dufftown Railway. The Keith & Dufftown Railway Association. p.21 =Closure and reopening= The station had closed to regular passenger services in May 1968 and closed to goods on 15/11/71. 'Northern Belle' excursion trains from Aberdeen however used the line for several years in the summer from 1984 and BR ran special trains from London until early 1991 when deteriorating infrastructure brought them to an end.McKenzie, Ian and Coull, Alistair. (2016). The Whisky Line. A Guide to the Keith and Dufftown Railway. The Keith & Dufftown Railway Association. p.11 The Keith - Dufftown section was however 'mothballed' by BR and was then purchased by the Keith & Dufftown Railway and it is now publicised as 'The Whisky Line'. Services Train for Dufftown arriving at Drummuir. The station has a car park and nature trail with a bird hide has been created in the old sidings and loading dock area. It is a regular timetabled stop for trains during the operating season with three trains a day in each direction (datum 2019).Train times on the Keith & Dufftown Railway.

It has fibrous or stringy bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth bark above, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of eleven or more, white flowers and conical or pair-shaped fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus fastigata is typically a tall, straight tree that grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous or stringy bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth white to brown bark above which often hangs in strings in the crown. Young plants and coppice regrowth have petiolate, broadly elliptical to egg-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are more or less the same glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of eleven, thirteen fifteen or more, the groups often paired, on a peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval or club-shaped, long and wide with a conical or rounded operculum. Flowering occurs between December and February and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody conical or pear-shaped capsule, long and wide with the valves at abour rim level. Eucalyptus regnans is similar to E. fastigata but has rough bark only at the base of the trunk, smaller buds and fruit, and a wider distribution in Victoria. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus fastigata was first formally described in 1897 by Henry Deane and Joseph Maiden in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet is from the Latin word (fastigatus) meaning \\"bring to a point\\" or \\"sharpen\\". Distribution and habitat Brown barrel grows in tall open forest in valleys and on slopes between the Ebor district on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales to the Errinundra Plateau in far north-eastern Victoria.Brooker, I. & Kleinig, D., Eucalyptus, An illustrated guide to identification, Reed Books, Melbourne, 1996 It is widely planted in New Zealand.
