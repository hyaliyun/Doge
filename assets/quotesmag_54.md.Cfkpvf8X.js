It is found in Central America and North America. Taxonomy Lygaeus kalmii was first formally named in 1874 by Swedish entomologist Carl St√•l in his Enumeratio Hemipterorum. There are two recognized subspecies: * Lygaeus kalmii angustomarginatus ‚Äì eastern small milkweed bug * Lygaeus kalmii kalmii Description Young nymphs of Lygaeus kalmii are initially fully red, developing black diagonal markings on the pronotum. Adults are orange to red and gray/black, reaching in length. The head is black with a red spot in the center. The forewings are patterned with a black heart inside of an orange-red X which does not meet in the middle. The membranous portion of the forewings in the eastern subspecies Lygaeus kalmii angustomarginatus has a narrow white margin, while that of the western L. k. kalmii has white spots and a broader margin. The small milkweed bug is commonly confused with other black and red or orange insects, including Oncopeltus fasciatus, Lygaeus turcicus, and Lygaeus reclivatus. Distribution and reproduction Lygaeus kalmii angustomarginatus is found in north temperate regions of North America and is not a migratory insect. Only adults overwinter and they do not begin reproduction until the following April. Females are receptive to males in all seasons. The eggs are laid on milkweed (Asclepias spp.) in the spring. Diet Small milkweed bugs' primary sources of nutrients are flower nectar and milkweed seeds. If these food sources are limited, they may feed on other insects.

They could reach up to in length and had two biped shear masts which doubled as boarding ladders. They also had one to three banks of oars rowed by galley slaves. They were specialized for naval battles. They were prominently used for piracy and slave raids from the mid-18th century to the early 19th century in most of Southeast Asia. The name lanong is derived from Lanun,Lanun also became the word for \\"pirate\\" in the Malay language an exonym of the Iranun people. Like the karakoa, large lanong were also inaccurately known by the Spanish as joangas or juangas (Spanish for \\"junk\\"), a name which was also applied to other large ships in Southeast Asia. Description Lanong can reach up to long and wide amidships. They were crewed by up to 150 to 200 men, led by a panglima (commander). Unlike the similar karakoa, the lanong were heavily armed specifically for naval battles. The prow jutted past the keel into a beakhead that also mounted a long gun (lela) and several swivel guns (lantaka). Lanong had two biped shear masts which were composed of two spars lashed together at the top, in contrast to the more common tripod masts used in other maritime Southeast Asian native ships. They were rigged with tanja sails. Their bases can partially revolve, which allowed them to be raised or lowered as needed. They are frequently used as ladders for boarding enemy vessels or for disembarking the crew on shores. A triangular banner with the standard of the panglima was flown from the stern. Like in karakoa, lanong had decks above the rowers and on both sides of the outriggers for accommodating warriors and for fighting. These platforms were defended by rows of fixed shields. Rowers (who were all galley slaves) were all housed inside the main hull, with none stationed on the outriggers. The oars were arranged into one to three banks on each side, one on top of the other. Like the garay and penjajap, lanong usually served as motherships to smaller salisipan war-canoes. History Lanong could sail long distances and attacked ships as far as the Straits of Malacca and Java. They became notorious from the mid-18th century to the early 19th century for the raids and piracy (magooray) in most of Southeast Asia. This was spurred by the rising demand for slave labor in the Dutch East Indies as well as growing enmity between the Moro Sultanates and the European colonial powers. Each year, Dutch, Spanish, and English colonies in the region were warned of the \\"pirate wind\\", from August to September, when the Iranun and Banguingui ships would traditionally start raiding. From 1774 to 1794, it is estimated that around 100 to 200 ships were launched annually from the Sulu Sea to raid the surrounding areas. The raids were either mounted independently or under the orders of the Sultanate of Sulu and the Sultanate of Maguindanao, whom the Iranun and Banguingui were subjects of. Unlike the captives of traditional raiders in the rest of the Philippines (who were treated as bondsmen, rather than true slaves), male captives of the Iranun and the Banguingui were treated brutally, even fellow Muslim captives were not spared. Female captives, however, were usually treated better. There were no recorded accounts of rapes, though some were starved for discipline. Rowers in lanong were composed entirely of previously captured male slaves, and it was not uncommon for rowers to die during long cruises due to exhaustion. Most of the slaves were Tagalogs, Visayans, and \\"Malays\\" (including Bugis, Mandarese, Iban, and Makassar). There were also occasional European and Chinese captives who were usually ransomed off through Tausug intermediaries of the Sulu Sultanate. Numerous accounts were recorded during this period from escaped slaves. It is estimated that in between 1770 to 1870, around 200,000 to 300,000 people were enslaved by the raiders. By 1850, as much as 50% of the population of the Sultanates in the Sulu archipelago were slaves. The sheer scale of the raids led to the disruption and cessation of traditional trade routes in the Sulu Sea. Notably, the traditional trade with China and the Sultanates of the Sulu Sea stopped. This contributed to the 19th-century economic decline of the Sultanates of Brunei, Sulu, and Maguindanao, eventually leading to the collapse of the latter two states. Spanish authorities and native Christian Filipinos responded to the Moro slave raids by building watchtowers and forts across the Philippine archipelago. Many of which are still standing today. Some provincial capitals were also moved further inland. Major command posts were built in Manila, Cavite, Cebu, Iloilo, Zamboanga, and Iligan. Defending ships were also built by local communities, especially in the Visayas Islands, including the construction of war \\"barangayanes\\" (balangay) that were faster than the Moro raiders and could give chase. As resistance against raiders increased, Lanong were eventually replaced by the smaller and faster garay (which did not have outriggers) in the early 19th century. The Moro raids were eventually subdued by several major naval expeditions by the Spanish and local forces from 1848 to 1891, including retaliatory bombardment and capture of Moro settlements. By this time, the Spanish had also acquired steam gunboats (vapor),Notably the Magellanes, the Elcano, and the Reina de Castilla used by Governor-General Narciso Claver√≠a y Zald√∫a in the 1848 Spanish expedition to Balanguingui. The Spanish fleet in the Philippines eventually operated a total of eighteen steam gunships. which could easily overtake and destroy the native Moro warships.

They operated in the region as pastoralists, whalers and shipbuilders. A number of things in the area were named after them. These include Imlay Street, the main street in Eden, the Mount Imlay National Park and Imlay Shire (today part of Bega Valley Shire). Early life One source says Alexander was born in Scotland and baptised in the parish of Methlick, Aberdeen, on 16 January 1794. His death notice records that he was aged 46 in March 1847, meaning he was born around 1800. The source with the earlier date reports that he attended Aberdeen University and qualified as a surgeon in March 1816.Peter Anderson (Ed.) Officers and graduates of University and King's College Aberdeen, 1495-1860, Aberdeen, 1893. In January 1827 he enlisted as a surgeon in the British army.Colonel William Johnston, Roll of commissioned officers in the medical service of the British Army ... 20 June 1727 to 23 June 1898, Aberdeen University Press, 1917, p.283. Imlay first arrived at Sydney in December 1829 on the Elizabeth, and was working as a government medical officer in the Civil Hospital by March 1830. His brother, George, who also trained as a surgeon, later joined him at the Sydney Infirmary. In 1831 Imlay journeyed to the Illawarra district and on his return reported a disease resembling smallpox had broken out there among the Aboriginal population. (Although the disease was never endemic on the continent, it was the principal cause of death in Aboriginal populations between 1780 and 1870.) He was on the move again in 1832 when he accompanied Governor (Sir) Richard Bourke (1777-1855) on a tour of inspection of southern New South Wales. By 1833 Alexander had taken up 1,280 acres (518 hectares) on the Bredalbane plains. Peter and George took up land at Twofold Bay in southern New South Wales near what is now Eden. They operated in the region as pastoralists, whalers, and shipbuilders, and produced casks of tallow and salted meat. The remoteness of the area and the lack of roads meant transport and communication was generally by sea. Activities in Tasmania Mount Imlay, June 2001 Alexander Imlay resigned his government post in 1833 and went to Tasmania to act as the local agent in Hobart for his brothers who remained in New South Wales. He arranged for vessels to bring their cattle and sheep from Twofold Bay to Tasmania.The Hobart Town Courier 20 February 1835, p.3 These shipments were well received and he was soon supplying most of the retail butchers in Hobart.The True Colonist (Hobart) 24 February 1836, p.2. Some of the ships were used as bay whalers in the winter months. He operated a number of shore-based whaling stations in Tasmania, and his brothers did the same at Twofold Bay. Alexander had one or two pastoral properties in Tasmania. He married Sophia Atkins in Hobart and the couple had four children.Wellings, Pioneers of Eden, p.8. Later life and legacy The brothers experienced financial difficulties in the economic depression that began in 1840. Alexander left Tasmania and joined his brothers at Twofold Bay. George had an incurable disease and shot himself in December 1846. Alexander died in 1847 at his brother (presumably Peter)'s home. Peter moved to New Zealand in 1851 and lived there for 30 years. Among the things named after Imlay brothers in the New South Wales area is Imlay Street, the main street in Eden, the Mount Imlay National Park and Imlay Shire (absorbed into Bega Valley Shire in 1981).

There are at least 140 described species in Augochloropsis.  Description and identification  Species of the genus Augochloropsis are generally between 8 and 12 mm long and metallic, typically bright green or blue in color, with some exceptions such as gold, red, or purple.Mitchell, T. B. (1960). Bees of the eastern United States. Augochloropsis species can be differentiated from other Augochlorini at the genus level by the tegulae that are punctate, D-shaped, and bent inwards.Packer, L., Genaro, J. A., & Sheffield, C. S. (2007). The bee genera of eastern Canada. Canadian Journal of Arthropod Identification, 3(3), 1-32.  Geographic distribution  The genus Augochloropsis is restricted to the New World, and the vast majority of species of are found in the tropical and subtropical regions.Choe, J. C., & Crespi, B. J. (Eds.). (1997). The evolution of social behaviour in insects and arachnids. Cambridge University Press. Three Augochloropsis species are found in the temperate regions of North America (A. anonyma, A. metallica, and A. sumptuosa), but no species have managed to successfully exploit niches present in the subarctic zone.  Nesting behavior  Augochloropsis nests begin with one long main burrow, dug out of soft ground, that extends straight down. This main burrow has a lateral burrow that extends outward horizontally, perpendicular to the main. Cells all hang vertically down from this one lateral burrow, a sort of clustering that is common for all genera in the tribe Augochlorini.Eickwort, George C., and Shoichi F. Sakagami. 1979. A classification of nest architecture of bees in the tribe Augochlorini with description of a Brazilian nest of Rhinocorynura inflaticeps. Biotropica 11 (1): 28‚Äì37. https://doi.org/10.2307/2388168 Aside from this, the overall structure of one main burrow and one lateral burrow is considered unique within the tribe.  Sociality  A broad spectrum of social behaviors have been observed in the tropical Augochloropsis species. These range from solitary, to communal, semisocial, and even eusocial nesting behavior.Gibbs, Jason. 2017. Notes on the nests of Augochloropsis metallica fulgida and Megachile mucida in Central Michigan. The Great Lakes Entomologist 50 (1): 17‚Äì24. A few faunal studies have looked at North American species as well. A. sumptuosa has been studied in New Jersey and Kansas and has been found to be either communal or semisocial. Some species have been observed to nest in aggregations, where the openings of several nests are located within just centimeters of each other.Michener, C.D., Lange, R.B. (1959) Observations on the behavior of Brazilian halictid bees IV. Augochloropsis, with notes on extralimital forms. American Museum Novitates 1924: 1-41. Some evidence of division of labor or partitioning of social roles to some extent has been observed within this genus. An excavated nest of A. metallica in Michigan led to the discovery of two female nest-mates with different levels of ovarian development that was determined not to be due simply to the age of the individuals. This was interpreted as strongly indicative of division of labor within this species, suggesting at least that individuals have varying levels of reproductive responsibility within a nest. This may be a larger pattern found within the social species of this genus. There is a large amount of behavioral variability observed within augochlorine bees. Species within this tribe can also display polyethism, or differences in sociality and work activity among different members of a species. Unlike certain species that may be reliably eusocial or reliably solitary, members of Augochloropsis show behavioral plasticity. It is not very well known what factors determine the sociality of an individual, but it does seem clear that species of this genus are quite variable in this regard.  Diet  Augochloropsis are classified as polylectic,Porter, C. C. (1983). Ecological notes on Lower Rio Grande Valley Augochloropsis and Agapostemon (Hymenoptera: Halictidae). Florida Entomologist, 344-353. a term which indicates that these species are broad generalists that collect pollen from multiple families of plants.Cane, J. H., & Sipes, S. (2006). Characterizing floral specialization by bees: analytical methods and a revised lexicon for oligolecty. Plant-pollinator interactions: from specialization to generalization, 99-122. Certain life history traits of bees are actually known to predict polylecty, including social lifestyles, long windows of adult activity, and producing more than two generations of offspring a year. Some of these traits are often seen in different Augochloropsis species. For example, Augochloropsis anonyma adults are active between April and September in the northern portion of its range and year- round within its range in southern Florida. Having this long window of activity makes this species more likely to forage from a large number of different plant taxa. Another species, Augochloropsis iris, which is native to South America, is primitively eusocial, and engages in three rounds of brood production over the course of a year, which correspond to the traits listed above that often promote wider diet breadth.Coelho, B.W.T. (2002) The biology of the primitively eusocial Augochloropsis iris (Schrottky, 1902)(Hymenoptera, Halictidae). Insectes Sociaux, 49(2), 181-190. = Floral associations = All three Augochloropsis species found in the United States have recorded floral associations with Hypericum. Additionally, Augochloropsis anonyma has been recorded in association with Baccharis, Bidens, Cirsium, Erigeron, Helenium, Ilex, Linaria, Melilotus, Metopium, Ocimum, Polygonurn, Pycnanthemum, Rhus, Rubus and Trifolium. Augochloropsis sumptuosa has been associated with Asclepias, Berlandiera, Bidens, Clethra, Crataegus, Eriogonum, Eryngium, Helianthus, Melilotus, Silphium, Stachys and Vaccinium. Augochloropsis metallica has the largest recorded floral associations of the 3 North American temperate species, with 73 floral records for the subspecies A. metallica metallica and 17 floral records for the subspecies A. metallica fulgida. Floral records common between the two subspecies of A. metallica include Aster, Chrysanthemum, Cornus, Erynigium, Geranium, Ilex, Rhus, Rubus, and Solidago.  Antagonistic interactions  = Brood parasitism = Brood parasitism by mutillid wasps (Sphinctopsis sp.) have been documented in Augochloropsis iris nests. While guards appear to deter invasion by mutillid wasps, they are not completely effective at preventing parasitism by these wasps. Members of the fly family Phoridae have been documented parasitizing Augochloropsis iris as well. However, members of Phoridae have only been documented parasitizing the nests of solitary females, indicating that the presence of guards at the entrances of multi-female nests are effective at preventing parasitism. = Endoparasites = Strepsipterans have been documented parasitizing Augochloropsis iris. = Nest Invasion = Ants have been documented invading and removing cell contents from the nests of Augochloropsis iris.

It feeds on bats and was known only from Ney Cave in Medina County, Texas, (39 MB) but has since been found in a cave near Chocoyos, Chimaltenango, Guatemala. Description Like all cimicids, Primicimex cavernis is small, flat and oval-shaped, becoming plumper after feeding. It is unable to fly and has beak-like mouthparts with which it pierces the skin and sucks the blood of its host. It differs from other cimicids (except Bucimex chilensis) in having claws and a row of erect, peg- like spines on the tarsus and has been observed using these structures to cling onto the bat's pelage. Ecology Primicimex cavernis and its nearest relative, Bucimex chilensis, are the only members of the cimicid subfamily Primicimicinae. Their hosts are exclusively bats; in the case of P. cavernis, this is the Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis), although the ghost-faced bat (Mormoops megalophylla), which roosts in the same cave, may act as a secondary host. Ney Cave is a limestone cave in semiarid savannah grassland with oak (Quercus), mesquite (Prosopis) and grasses. The cave is a seasonal roost used by the bats as nursery quarters, and at dusk during the summer, upward of 400,000 bats may stream out of the cave entrance to forage for insects, returning to the roost before dawn. The young are mostly born in June and remain in the roost until able to fly, at about 40 days of age. Cimicids have the ability to survive for long periods without feeding, and this allows Primicimex cavernis to hide in crevices, awaiting the return of their hosts from their over-wintering sites. Like other cimicids, Primicimex cavernis feeds exclusively on blood. It is exceptional within the family in that insemination takes place through the reproductive tract, while in all other species, traumatic insemination occurs, with the sperm being injected through the body wall.

Accessed 28 August 2011. stars Tim Pigott-Smith as James Wisheart and Madhav Sharma as Janarda Dhasmana, who whilst working together to perform 33 arterial-switch operations, drew up a mortality rate of 66% among patients under a month old, and 43% among those over a month old. Aden Gillett co-stars as Steve Bolsin, the whistleblower whose testimony first brought the scandal to public attention. The film broadcast in the United States as part of PBS' Masterpiece Theatre strand on 6 May 2002. The New York Times review of the film commented that \\"Neil McKay's script captures the intelligent persuasiveness of the surgeons and the twisted rationales employed by fairly good people doing bad things. Obviously there is no shortage of human drama in this story, and the scenes of parents reacting to news about their babies are almost painfully real. Eventually the confused drama within the infirmary becomes gripping, too.\\" The film was nominated for an international Emmy Award in 2001.

They occur in both freshwater and seawater, have cylindrical bodies, and typically have a large, bell-shaped, anterior sucker with which they cling to their host. Some of the leeches in this family have external gills, outgrowths of the body wall projecting laterally, the only group of leeches to exchange gases in this way. Worldwide, around 60 genera and 100 species of leeches are in this family, all parasitic on the blood of marine, estuarine, and freshwater fishes. These leeches are less common in the tropics, and more abundant in temperate and polar waters. Taxonomy Historically, the Piscicolidae have been divided into three subfamilies: the Pontobdellinae, characterised by two pairs of pulsatile vesicles on each urosome segment; the Pontobdellinae, characterised by a single pair of pulsatile vesicles on each urosome segment; and the Platybdellinae, with no pulsatile vesicles. However, molecular phylogenetic analyses performed by Williams and Burreson in 2006, do not support these subdivisions. The Piscicolidae were confirmed as being monophyletic, but the Platybdellinae were shown to be polyphyletic with four distinct clades, and the Piscicolinae were similarly polyphyletic, again with four distinct clades, and the Pontobdellinae were paraphyletic with respect to the genus Oxytonostoma. Ecology The Piscicolidae are parasitic on the blood of fishes. Some species are host-specific, while others can accept a larger range of hosts. Some, such as the European Piscicola geometra, take a blood meal and then drop off the host and hide somewhere while they digest the blood; some, mostly in marine or estuarine habitats with soft substrates, attach themselves temporarily to a crustacean after leaving their fish host; others remain attached to a fish semipermanently. Leeches are hermaphrodites, and mating may take place on or off the fish host, but in either case, the cocoon, usually containing a single egg, is deposited elsewhere, usually stuck to a stone or piece of vegetation, or even to the carapace of a crustacean. When the egg hatches, the juvenile leech has about a week to find a suitable fish host for itself.

Release The Haunting of Sarah hardy was distributed on home video by CIC in the United Kingdom in December 1989. Critical response Irv Letofsky of the Los Angeles Times wrote of the film: \\"The thing about suspense is that the characters can be dumb and the plot can be muddled and the whole production can be awkwardly filmed and sometimes it can still work. But if there's no passion in the playing and it all lies there flat and deadly and every twist and turn of the story is predictable by a mile, then there's not much fun and surprise left.\\" John Stark of People wrote: \\"The hokey plot, with its ending right out of When a Stranger Calls, could be excused if the characters weren‚Äôt so one-dimensional. There‚Äôs no sense of locale, either. Although filmed in and around Portland, Ore., it could be Anywhere, U.S.A.

Club and state rowing Blair's senior rowing was done from the Melbourne University Boat Club. Blair raced in Victorian representative women's crews who contested the Victoria Cup at the Interstate Regatta. Till 1998 that race was in lightweight coxless four and Blair raced in Victorian fours in 1996 and 1997 (to victory). From 1999 the lightweight women's interstate race was contested in quad sculls. Blair raced for Victoria in quads in 1999 (to victory) and in 2000. International representative rowing Blair's first Australian representative appearance was in the 1995 u/23 Trans Tasman series where she raced in a lightweight pair. Her senior Australian representative debut was the following year in a lightweight coxless pair at the 1996 World Rowing Championships, a lightweight only regatta in Strathclyde, Scotland. She raced with her Victorian team-mate Justine Joyce to a fifth place. The following year at Aiguebelette 1997 still paired with Joyce, Blair won World Championship gold in a lightweight coxless pair. As a result of the women's lightweight coxless pair being retired from international racing in 1997, Blair's 7:18:32 time set with Joyce is the standing world record in that event. By 1998 Blair had switched to sculling and she competed at international World Rowing Cups that year in firstly a double scull and then the quad. For the 1998 World Rowing Championships in Cologne, Blair was selected in the lightweight quad scull with Josephine Lips, Rebecca Joyce and Dearne Grant. They placed fifth. At the 2000 World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne, Switzerland Blair rowed in Australia's lightweight women's quad. The next month that same crew contested the lightweight quad scull at the 2000 World Rowing Championships in Zagreb, Croatia and Blair won a silver medal in a crew with Catriona Roach, Sally Causby and Amber Halliday.

The salmon farm was run by Cooke Aquaculture Pacific, LLC. According to the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the inadequate cleaning of biofouling on the net pens containing the farmed salmon was likely the primary cause for the pen break. Background Prior to the incident, Washington was the only state on the Pacific coast where Atlantic salmon was farmed. Atlantic salmon are favored by salmon farmers, since their domestication process is much farther along; farmed Atlantic salmon have been selected for faster growth, higher tolerance to disease, and greater docility. The net pen was managed by Cooke Aquaculture, a Canadian company based in New Brunswick and one of the largest aquaculture companies in the world. It took over the Cypress Island aquafarms in 2016. The pen that was breached was a 10-cage salmon pen that contained 305,000 fish, placed in 2001. It was anchored in Deepwater Bay, southeast of Cypress Island and to the west of Bellingham Channel which separates Cypress Island from Guemes Island. The pen was submerged from to . It was approximately wide by long. The August 2017 pen break was preceded by an incident a month earlier in the same pen between July 24‚Äì25 where its mooring failed twice. This incident occurred during the highest tidal current level in the summer of 2017. Initially, the salmon pens were stocked with 369,312 smolts during May 2016 and had been scheduled to be harvested starting September 2017. At the time of the incident, the biomass held by the salmon pen was estimated to be at around . Incident The pen break was reported by a boater on August 19, 2017. The Washington State Department of Natural Resources estimated that 243,000 to 263,000 salmon escaped the pen, which was much higher than Cooke Aquaculture Pacific's estimates of 4,000 to 5,000 salmon. The company later estimated that around 160,000 fish had escaped. According to Cooke Aquaculture Pacific, the pen break was due to unusually strong tidal currents during that week's solar eclipse, but Washington State Department of Natural Resources investigators found that the tidal currents were well within the range that the net pens had survived in previous years, and the solar eclipse did not affect the tidal currents significantly. The investigators determined that insufficient maintenance and cleaning of the biofouling on the net pens was the primary cause of the break. Investigators found that the pen held around of biofouling, which was over 600-percent of the total original weight of the pen. Aftermath In the immediate aftermath of the incident, the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife authorized the unlimited catching of escaped Atlantic salmon from the farm, and around 57,000 were recaptured. Coastal tribes such as the Swinomish, Samish, and Lummi were involved in recapturing them. The Lummi declared a state of emergency and caught around 44,239, approximately . The salmon were sold back to Cooke Aquaculture Pacific, which paid $30 per fish. Cooke offered to raise the price to $42 per fish if the Lummi were willing to abandon their pursuit of banning salmon aquaculture, but they refused. In November and December 2017, the salmon were captured from the Skagit River by members of the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe. In April 2018, fishermen from the tribe continued to recover salmon from the river, up to eight months after the incident. The Washington State Senate passed a law in March 2018 banning the farming of Atlantic salmon in the state by 2025. In April 2018, the Thurston County Superior Court upheld the termination of Cooke Aquaculture Pacific's farming license by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, which effectively prevented the company from restocking its Atlantic salmon fishing pens. Documentary Annie Crawley's documentary short film Frankenfish concerning the event was selected for the 2018 Seattle International Film Festival, and shown at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration‚ÄìUniversity of Washington Sea Grant Programs River and Ocean Film Festival the same year.

When she was 10 years old she began freestyle skiing training at Thredbo, and when she was 14 she started competing internationally. Days before her appearance at the 1998 Nagano Olympics in Japan, she fractured her back and skied in her events with a back brace, plaster casts on her shins, knee braces and shoulder taping. Her injury was severe, however, and she retired from skiing. Gill moved into sports management and administration, working with the Organising Committee for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

Reynolds has stated that the novel requires no previous knowledge of Aurora Rising, functioning as a standalone work. Aurora Rising and Elysium Fire comprise the Prefect Dreyfus Emergency series. Synopsis Elysium Fire begins two years after the events of Aurora Rising. Senior Prefect Tom Dreyfus and Field Prefect Thalia Ng are investigating a series of strange deaths. Random, unconnected citizens in the Glitter Band are \\"melting\\"  the neural implants in their heads rapidly overheating and frying their brains. The meltings begin to occur at an increasing rate, and the Prefects have no idea where to start the investigation. As the meltings are happening, several habitats in the Glitter Band, unhappy with the decisions made by Panoply at the end of Aurora Rising, begin seceding from the Glitter Band and thus no longer fall under the authority of Panoply. Leading the movement to secede is the mysterious Julius Devon Garlin Voi, who seems to have inside knowledge of what has been happening. Reception Eric Brown of The Guardian praises Reynolds's world building for the novel, and his ability to populate the far-future technological societies with well rounded characters.

In order to assess patient outcomes and to ensure that patients get treatment that is right for them, real world data needs to be utilized. RWE is generated by analyzing data which is stored in electronic health records (EHR), medical claims or billing activities databases, registries, patient- generated data, mobile devices, etc. It may be derived from retrospective or prospective observational studies and observational registries. In the USA the 21st Century Cures Act required the FDA to expand the role of real world evidence. Real World Evidence comes into play when clinical trials cannot really account for the entire patient population of a particular disease. Patients suffering from comorbidities or belonging to a distant geographic region or age limit who did not participate in any clinical trial may not respond to the treatment in question as expected. RWE provides answers to these problems and also to analyze effects of drugs over a longer period of time. Pharmaceutical companies and Health Insurance Payers study RWE to understand patient pathways to deliver appropriate care for appropriate individuals and to minimize their own financial risk by investing on drugs that work for patients.  Data quality  In order to use real world data to generate evidence, data must be of sufficient quality. Kahn et al. define data quality as consisting of three components: (1) conformance (do data values adhere to do specified standard and formats?; subtypes: value, relational and computational conformance); (2) completeness (are data values present?); and (3) plausibility (are data values believable?; subtypes uniqueness, atemporal; temporal).  Fitness for purpose  Similarly to having sufficient data quality, the real world data must be fit for purpose. An RWD resource can be fit for addressing some questions, but not others. For example, a dataset that lacks mother-to-baby links may not be appropriate to address drug risk for fetus but can be used for questions for drug safety in patients taking epilepsy treatment (limited to the patient; not including safety for fetus). Since data quality can be evaluated outside a particular purpose (on a general level), fitness for purpose is evaluated separate from data quality and is not included in the concept of data quality.

History Gunston was founded in the 1950s by the \\"Winston Tobacco Company\\" in South Africa. It was one of the most popular South African brands on the market, until sales started to decline in favour to other brands such as Peter Stuyvesant and Marlboro. On the 28th of April 1972, a trademark request for the words \\"Gunston cigarettes\\" was filed and it was approved on the 19th of June 1973. The trademark expired on 19 June 2004. In December 1999, the Independent Online reported that Gunston, but also brands like John Player International Filter, Camel Plain and Gitanes could be outlawed if the manufacturer would not lower the tar content in the afromentioned brands. The manufacturers had three months to comply with the regulation changes, and eventually complied. The limits on the amount of tar in cigarettes were said to be in line with the World Health Organization recommendations of 1999, which stipulate that 15 mg of tar and 1,5 mg of nicotine should be the maximum. After two or three years these limits were to be reduced to 12 mg of tar and 1,2 mg of nicotine. Advertising Pack of Gunston with a text warning above Various magazine and poster advertisements were made to advertise the brand. Some ads also included Team Gunston (a Formula One team owned by Rhodesian racing driver John Love) and the \\"Gunston 500\\", a South African surf competition. The slogan that was frequently used was \\"Men Rate Gunston Great\\". Some radio advertisements for Springbok Radio were also made. Sponsorship =Formula 1= Gunston sponsored Team Gunston from until . They were known as the first team who introduced tobacco sponsorship to motor racing when they sponsored Rhodesian drivers John Love and Sam Tingle in the 1968 South African Championship for Formula 1 and Formula 5000 machinery. Prior to the F1 sponsorship, the team participated in the non-championship race Rhodesian Grand Prix held at the James McNeillie Circuit in Bulawayo. =South African F2= Gunston sponsored Team Gunston in the South African F2. =Kyalami 9 Hours= Gunston sponsored Team Gunston in the Kyalami 9 Hours (also known as the 1000 km of Kyalami. =Surfing= Gunston sponsored the \\"Gunston 500\\" surfing championship. Originally it was called the \\"Durban 500\\", but once Gunston became their main sponsor, the name was changed. The sponsorship ended when tobacco sponsorship in South Africa was banned in 1999.
