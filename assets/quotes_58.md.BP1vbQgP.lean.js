(1 December 1947 ‚Äì 21 July 2019) was an Egyptian Roman Catholic prelate who served as the Apostolic Vicar of Alexandria since 2009 until 2019. Prior to his episcopal appointment, he served in various parishes across cities such as Cairo and was also the order's national provincial superior for a time before returning to parish work. Life Bishop Adel Zaky was born on 1 December 1947 in Luxor. Brother of Edward, Tharwat, Atef and Magdy Zaky. From 1959 until 1963 he attended the Assiut University where he obtained his bachelor's degree in theological studies. He entered the Order of Friars Minor in the 1960s in Guizeh and began his novitiate on 30 September 1968 before making his simple profession on 1 October 1969. Zaky made his solemn religious profession on 10 September 1972. On 24 September 1972 he received his ordination to the priesthood from the Bishop Jean de Capistran Aim√© Cayer. Following his ordination he continued with additional studies from 1973 to 1975 at the Jesuit-run Saint Joseph University in Beirut in Lebanon where he obtained a licentiate in dogmatic theology in 1975. From 1975 until 1989 he served in the parishes of Assiut, El-Tawirat and then in Nag-Hammadi while from 1989 to 1998 served as the order's national provincial superior residing in Daher in Cairo. From 1998 until 2009 he served as a pastor in Boulacco in Cairo. Pope Benedict XVI appointed Zaky on 1 September 2009 as the Apostolic Vicar of Alexandria and also made him the Titular Bishop of Flumenzer; he received his episcopal consecration on 31 October 2009 from Archbishop Michael Louis Fitzgerald, with Archbishop Marco Dino Brogi and Bishop Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli serving as the principal co-consecrators. He attended his first \\"ad limina\\" visit to Pope Francis on 8 March 2018. The bishop spoke Arabic but was also fluent in Italian and also knew Latin, English, and French. On 10 February 2014 the bishop met with representatives of various Christian communities in Our Lady of Heliopolis in Cairo to pray for peace and national stability. Attendees included the Coptic Patriarch Ibrahim Isaac Sidrak as well as representatives from Christian communities such as the Melkites and Lutherans. Zaky said: \\"at the moment the common prayer of Egyptian Christians takes on a particular character: we are going through a time where severe episodes of violence continues in the country, but also one can see signs of hope on the horizon\\". In March 2015 the Franciscan- managed Coptic Church of Kafr el-Dawar was attacked prompting Bishop Zaky to refer to the episode as a link to a series of attacks against infrastructure leading him to believe the objective of attackers was to make the country insecure and also to destabilize it.

She overcame this dubious distinction to become the highly regarded Matron of the hospital, then one of the first Australian nursing Matrons to serve at the front during World . History Graham was born in Carlisle, Cumberland, daughter of Margaret Graham, n√©e Farrer and her husband house painter John Graham. Nothing further is known of her early life until she emigrated to South Australia in 1886 aboard the steam ship Austral, on 2 April 1891 enrolled as a probationary nurse at the Adelaide Hospital. In March 1894 was appointed acting charge nurse in charge of Adelaide ward, and on 19 November was recommended by the hospital board for appointment as night charge nurse. This recommendation was not implemented Adelaide Hospital in the last decade of the 19th century was a dysfunctional workplace, beset with factional jealousies and professional rivalries, exacerbated by opponents of the Government, who saw political benefit in keeping the hospital an \\"open sore\\". Graham became embroiled in controversy when nurse Gordon (1861‚Äì1940), a sister of the Chief Secretary (later Sir) John Gordon, was promoted to Superintendent of Night Nurses, the second highest nursing rank. Many nurses thought the position should have gone to the more senior charge nurse Louise Hawkins, and that this was a case of favoritism. Six nurses, Graham among them, sent a petition to Premier Kingston requesting an independent enquiry. A committee of twelve, including Drs. Way (who was instrumental in her promotion),Way would shortly become personally involved in a similar controversy when his daughter was promoted over more senior nurses. Stirling, Giles and Sir John Colton, met to consider the Premier's request for a review of the appointment. This they endorsed on the grounds that Miss Gordon's selection was on her leadership potential, not her nursing ability (an analogy with officers and \\"men\\" was made). Further, they regarded the letter as insulting and impertinent, and recommended suspension of the signatories. This reference includes the text of the letter and names of the signatories. Hawkins afterwards (29 May 1897) married Andrew Gr≈´ber, author of the petition and characterized by J. H. Symon as a manipulator and Kingston's (whom he loathed) toady and informant as well as being a fomentor of the Hospital troubles. Under pressure, five of the nurses withdrew their support for Hawkins, but Graham refused to retract and was urged by her superior, Matron McLeod, to resign, and Dr. Way suggested she take a position at the Port Adelaide Hospital. A Royal Commission found that her protest was justified, but insulting terms had been used against the Government and the Hospital Board, and if these were retracted Graham should be reinstated. The Government dissolved the hospital board, and in the interval between their sacking and appointment of the new one, reinstated Nurse Graham. The medical superintendent Dr. Perks, who had originally recommended Gordon's promotion to Way, resigned in September 1895 after Graham's return. Matron McLeod, a personal friend of Perks, also resigned. On 8 April 1896 the honorary medical staff and surgical staff resigned en masse, but continued attending to their patients until their contracts expired or replacements were appointed. Professional rivalry between surgeons (such as Napier and Corbin) Resident House Surgeon Napier was one of Kingston's \\"strikebreakers\\", the other being Ramsay Smith. Intern R. W. Hornabrook would become one of Australia's leading anaesthesiologists was so intense that the welfare of patients suffered. Graham was appointed charge nurse and put in charge of Wyatt ward on 4 March 1896. She soon lived down her reputation as a rebel by dedication to her profession, and was appointed Matron on 1 January 1898. When the Duchess of Cornwall, married to the future George V, visited the Adelaide Hospital on 10 July 1901, Graham served as her guide, showing her over Albert, Victoria, Alexandra, Alfred, Hope, and Flinders wards. In November 1911, in an echo of 1895, three nurses were sacked by the board for complaining about the conduct of one Sister Dunstan, who was responsible to Matron Graham. Subsequently 81 nurses refused to work under her; Graham informed the medical superintendent, Dr. C. T. C. de Crespigny, who individually ordered them to work in Victoria ward under Dunstan, and all but two probationers refused and were suspended. Graham smoothed the way for the nurses to return to work, advising them they would not be required to serve under Dunstan. Dunstan was an efficient and conscientious nurse and might have had better relations with her juniors had Graham been more accepting, tactful and accommodating. Matron Graham was an excellent teacher but avoided paperwork wherever possible, leaving it for her night charge nurse. In April 1912 Dunstan was transferred to the Adelaide Destitute Asylum, where in 1913 she was at the centre of another staff dispute, but was again exonerated. Army service Army records originally had Graham aboard Ascanius, but later amended to indicate a 5 December embarkation aboard Kyarra. In 1904 she enlisted with the Australian Army Nursing Service, a newly formed volunteer body of 108 (14 in SA) women nurses attached to the Australian Army Medical Corps, and was appointed the State's Lady Superintendent, with Miss Mary Knowles as Matron. Graham enlisted for active service with the 1st AIF on 19 or 28 September 1914 (later army documents have 21 November); Sister Edith May Menhennett enlisted around the same time. With some 2,000 troops she boarded Ascanius (aka Transport A11), which left Port Adelaide's Outer Harbor on 20 October 1914, arrived Fremantle on 25 October, and Colombo 14 November, destined for Malta where she joined the hospital ship Guildford Castle. :An alternative history can be found in the biography of Nurse Frances Mary Deere, who enlisted 25 November 1914, travelled by train from Adelaide to Melbourne, joining the medical unit ship HMAT Kyarra (transport A55), which departed Melbourne on 5 December 1914 under a news blackout. Among the 20 nursing volunteers from Adelaide was Matron Margaret Graham. This accords with the handwritten correction on the record card pictured here and by Merrilyn Lincoln's assertion in the Australian Dictionary of Biography that Graham \\"embarked at Melbourne in December\\". :There is however no doubting newspaper reports of Graham boarding Ascanius which left Adelaide in October, and several Army records in Graham's file mention that ship. The Matron in charge of the nurses on the Kyarra was not Graham but the less senior Mary Knowles. Graham reported for duty at 2nd Australian General Hospital, Mena House, Heliopolis on 27 April 1915 where Ellen Gould may have been Matron, then on 4 May 1915 at the 1st Australian General Hospital in Heliopolis, where she served 1915‚Äì16, also at the Red Cross hospital (2nd Australian General Hospital?) at Ghezireh and the military infectious diseases hospital at Choubra. She also worked on hospital transport ships carrying wounded from Gallipoli. She returned to Melbourne on duty aboard hospital transport ship Euripides, leaving Suez 22 January 1917. She reenlisted on 2 April 1917 and returned to London, reporting for duty at the 3rd Australian Auxiliary Hospital in Dartford, Kent, which specialised in war neurosis and PTSD patients. Her last posting was the 2nd Australian General Hospital, England, before in January 1918 reporting to the medical offices at A.I.F. Headquarters, London. She was a few months in the Glen Almond Convalescent Home for Sisters, then returned to Australia, embarking on the steamer Marathon (aka Transport A74) 15 April 1918, admitted to the 7th Australian General Hospital 28 June 1918 and was discharged as an invalid 28 August 1918. Last years Graham rejoined the Adelaide Hospital staff, then in 1919 was seconded to the Jubilee Exhibition Building on North Terrace, which had been requisitioned by the Army as a convalescent hospital for military victims of the influenza pandemic, and was returned to public use on 1 December 1919. She resigned in 1920 and Eleanor Harrald was appointed Superintendent of Nurses in her place. On 27 January 1921 Margaret Graham boarded the Benalla for England where she died in Carlisle. She never married. Recognition *She was Mentioned in Despatches 13 October 1916 by Gen. A. J. Murray. Many of these records are confused and confusing, especially that relating to her service before 1917, which almost certainly was added at a later date. Her date of enlistment was variously recorded as 28 September 1914; 20 or 21 November 1914. Even her Next of Kin, Elizabeth Bell, is variously described as her cousin and her sister. *In December 1916 she was awarded the Royal Red Cross, 1st Class, so was entitled to the post-nominal letters RRC. The award was personally presented by King George V. *She was in 1900 the founder of the SA branch of the Royal British Nurses' Association and awarded the title of Lady Consul by the parent body. *She was awarded the Honorary Diploma of the Royal British Nurses' Association, a rare honour. *The Adelaide Hospital Nurses' Quarters, a four-storey building at the former RAH site close to Frome Road, was built in 1911, later repurposed as an administrative centre and in 1954 named Margaret Graham Building for her. *A plaque on North Terrace, Adelaide was laid in her honour as part of the Jubilee 150 Walkway.

Following the end of the Battle of An L·ªôc, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 18th Division turned over the defense of the An L·ªôc area to the III Corps Ranger Command and the 92nd Ranger Battalion was given responsibility for defense of Tong Le Chon. The ARVN presence at Tong Le Chon forced the PAVN to detour from its preferred logistical corridors from T√¢y Ninh Province into B√¨nh Long Province and southward along the Saigon River to B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province. In March 1973 the PAVN began a siege of the camp. Battle The PAVN siege began on 25 March. Soon after that date all resupply had to be parachuted, evacuation became almost impossible, and the bombardment was almost continuous. Helicopters could not land without prohibitive risk, and the PAVN antiaircraft positions around the camp became so dense that even approach by helicopter became almost impossible. In the 16-week period beginning on 25 March, the PAVN conducted almost 300 attacks by fire against the camp, expending over 13,000 mortar, rocket, and artillery rounds. There were also 11 ground attacks and at least 9 attempts by sappers to infiltrate defenses. The PAVN supported the attacks with psychological bombardments, promising over loud-speakers to afford the defenders safe passage out of the camp and appealing to the camp commander to lead his men out. As of the first week in July, the total strength of the 92nd Ranger Battalion inside the camp and two close-in outposts was 224 officers and men, of whom 34 were out of action because of wounds or illness. Total casualties for the period were 16 killed, 4 seriously wounded, and 192 lightly wounded or sick, including some with beri-beri and malaria. Despite isolation and deteriorating morale, the Rangers held fast and during those 16 weeks counted 86 PAVN soldiers killed and 10 individual weapons captured, including an antiaircraft machine gun, and claimed destruction of one PAVN 105 mm howitzer. During the 16-week period, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) flew over 3,000 sorties supporting the camp, dropping more than 300 400-pound bundles of food and other supplies, of which 134 were recovered by the defenders while the remainder fell into PAVN hands. The besieging force consisted at first of a battalion of the 271st Regiment, 9th Division, later replaced by a battalion of the 201st Independent Regiment. Also included in the forces surrounding Tong Le Chon were a battalion each of the 42nd and 271st Antiaircraft Regiments of the 69th Artillery Group and firing batteries of the 28th Artillery Battalion, the latter equipped with 130 mm field guns. After a brief respite in June 1973 following the call for the signatories to observe the terms of the Paris Peace Accords, the shelling resumed, moderately enough at first, but reached crescendo proportions later in the year as the PAVN added 120 mm and 160 mm mortars and 122 mm and 130 mm howitzers and guns to the batteries ranging on the camp. Antiaircraft artillery, including 37 mm and 57 mm guns from the newly formed 377th Antiaircraft Artillery Division at L·ªôc Ninh continued to make supply difficult and evacuation next to impossible. The PAVN 200th Battalion, which had been used in local security missions in the Tay Ninh logistical area, was assigned to the infantry element of the siege force. One of its platoon leaders rallied to the South Vietnamese side in September with some interesting comments on the conduct of the operation. He said that in June the PAVN organized a company to collect parachuted supplies that fell outside the Tong Le Chon perimeter, which between April nod June amounted to about 80 percent of all supplies dropped. After June, according to this rallier, RVNAF techniques had improved to the point where only 10 percent of the drops were recoverable by the company. He asserted that an understanding had been reached between Rangers and the PAVN whereby the C-130s dropping supplies would not be fired upon so long as the company would not be opposed as it collected the supplies outside the perimeter. This assertion cannot be corroborated, but it fits the general character of the situation at Tong Le Chon. If there was a tacit withholding of fire against the C-130s at Tong Le Chon, it certainly did not apply to helicopters. Many attempts were made to fly helicopters into Tong Le Chon to evacuate casualties and land replacements. Between late October and the end of January 1974, 20 helicopters attempted landings; but only 6 managed to land and 3 of these were destroyed by fire upon landing. In the last week of December 1973 a CH-47 Chinook was destroyed as it landed, the 13th helicopter hit by enemy fire on a Tong Le Chon mission during December alone. Casualties were 9 killed and 36 wounded. Another crashed and burned in January, and as the anniversary of the 28 January 1973 ceasefire came and went, 12 seriously injured Rangers remained in the camp. By March 1974, the situation was becoming desperate for the 92nd Rangers. Seriously wounded soldiers could be neither treated nor evacuated. Resupply was by parachute drop only. Morale in the camp was deteriorating under the strain of isolation and constant heavy bombardment. The cost of the continued defense of Tong Le Chon, as a symbol of gallantry, was exceeding its real worth. The human suffering was incalculable, but the expense in aircraft losses, flying hours, ammunition, and other logistical support was great. As the ARVN's scarce resources became even more scarce, it was clearly time to reassess priorities and determine how best to end this intolerable situation. As of 15 March, about 255 officers and men of the 92nd were still alive in Tong Le Chon, and five of these were critically wounded. On 20 March Lt. Gen. Ph·∫°m Qu·ªëc Thu·∫ßn proposed to the Chief of the Joint General Staff, General Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n, that one of three methods be selected to relieve the 92nd Rangers. First, a division-sized operation could be launched from An L·ªôc to secure a corridor through which the 92md could be withdrawn, replaced, or reinforced. Second, the commander of the PAVN siege forces could be enjoined to permit the orderly and safe withdrawal of the 92nd, surrendering the camp to the PAVN. Third, the 92nd commander could be ordered to plan and execute a withdrawal- by exfiltrating in small groups-bringing out all his men, including the sick and wounded. General Thu·∫ßn realized at the outset that only the third plan was even remotely feasible, as General Vi√™n and his staff no doubt understood. The ARVN could not punch through from An L·ªôc to Tong Le Chon when repeated efforts to attack even a few miles north of Lai Kh√™ had failed. A division could not be assembled with the road to An L·ªôc held by the PAVN and in any case, all ARVN divisions were heavily committed coping with other threats. The second option was equally unrealistic due to the political repercussions and the precedent could portend future such capitulations, some possibly with less than adequate justification. Only the third option had any merit, but the decision had to be referred to President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu. Meanwhile, the situation at Tong Le Chon was becoming critical. The intensity of the PAVN's artillery and mortar attacks increased greatly in the week of 17-24 March. In the Two-Party Joint Military Commission meetings in Saigon, South Vietnam's representative warned the Provisional Revolutionary Government that if the attacks on Tong Le Chon did not cease, the RVNAF would launch devastating attacks against PAVN bases in T√¢y Ninh and B√¨nh Long. In fact, the RVNAF did fly 30 or more sorties around Lo Go in T√¢y Ninh and around Tong Le Chon on 23 March, but the PAVN bombardments continued. PAVN artillery used against Tong Le Chon between 22 and 24 March included 122 mm rockets, 122 mm howitzers, 120 mm mortars and nearly 1,000 rounds from 82 mm and 60 mm mortars. Many of the bunkers and fighting positions were badly damaged. PAVN sappers attempted to break through the defensive wire on the night of 21/2 March but were driven off. On the 21st, the commander of the 92nd Battalion, Lt. Col. Le Van Ngon, sent a message to Colonel Nguyen Thanh Chuan, commander of the 3d Ranger Command at An L·ªôc. Colonel Ngon calling for more support or the destruction of the camp. He asked for more airstrikes, although it was already apparent that the RVNAF could not materially change the situation. He asked for a ground relief column, but he probably knew as well as did Colonel Chuan that this could not succeed. In emotional desperation, he asked for airstrikes on his own camp as the only feasible alternative to surrender, which he said he and his men would never do. Colonel Chuan relayed this urgent message to General Thu·∫ßn who replied that he had received no response from the JGS to his earlier proposals for evacuation or relief. By this time, the survivors at Tong Le Chon included 254 Rangers, 4 artillerymen, 7 stranded helicopter crewmen, and 12 field laborers. Of this force, 10 were seriously wounded and 40 slightly wounded. On the nights of the 24, 25 and 26 March, PAVN sappers penetrated three of seven rings of barbed wire before being forced to withdraw. The unrelenting bombardment and repeated sapper attacks continued through the month and into April. Still, no initiatives or decisions came from the President Thi·ªáu, III Corps or 3rd Ranger Command to ameliorate the suffering or offer hope to the defenders of Tong Le Chon. While nearly 1,000 rounds of mortar and artillery were falling on the base the night of 11 April, Headquarters, III Corps, received a final request from Colonel Ngon: give us authority to abandon the camp. Whether General Thu·∫ßn conferred with General Vi√™n or President Thi·ªáu is not known, but at 23:30 that night he ordered Colonel Ngon to defend at all costs. Shortly after midnight, the defenders of Tong Le Chon reported that sensitive papers were being burned. Later they requested that RVNAF stop dropping flares over the camp because they were moving out. Radio contact with the Rangers was broken until 09:00 on 12 April, when a radio operator outside the camp responded to a call. By that time the march to An L·ªôc, some 16km northeast through the jungle and PAVN lines, had started. The ranks of the wounded had swollen by 14 during the night's action and 35 more were wounded during the withdrawal. All wounded were brought out; those who could not walk were carried. In the firefights during the withdrawal 4 more Rangers were killed, but even these bodies were carried on to An L·ªôc. Following an intensive artillery preparation, a ground attack of infantry and tanks was launched against the camp, but the defenses were so heavily mined that the PAVN was unable to get through the defenses until the 13th. The PAVN found that all equipment had been destroyed or removed and all wounded had been carried out. Only two Ranger bodies were found, and only one Ranger was captured. A captured PAVN soldier said that the attacking PAVN infantry had been ordered to block the Rangers' withdrawal but had disobeyed the order for fear of the South Vietnamese air and artillery fire. Aftermath The last of the survivors from Tong Le Chon entered the An L·ªôc perimeter on 15 April. Although the record was clear that Colonel Ngon had disobeyed orders by withdrawing, he was not punished, but the battalion was dissolved and its men sequestered from the press. The official South Vietnamese position was that the camp had been overrun in clear violation of the ceasefire and appropriate protests were made to the International Commission of Control and Supervision and the Two-Party Joint Military Commission. On 13 April, the RVNAF flew 19 sorties against what remained of the camp. With Tong Le Chon obliterated, the PAVN had unrestricted use of its important east-west line of communication between T√¢y Ninh and B√¨nh Long and controlled the Saigon River corridor from its source to D·∫ßu Ti·∫øng District.

The genetic history of East Asians relates to the genetic makeup of the East Asian race.  Xiongnu people (ancient)  The Xiongnu, possibly a Turkic, Iranian, Mongolic, Yenisseian or multi-ethnic people, were a confederation of nomadic peoples who, according to ancient Chinese sources, inhabited the eastern Asian Steppe from the 3rd century BC to the late 1st century AD. Chinese sources report that Modu Chanyu, the supreme leader after 209 BC, founded the Xiongnu Empire.di Cosmo 2004: 186 A majority (89%) of the Xiongnu sequences can be classified as belonging to Asian haplogroups, and nearly 11% belong to European haplogroups. = Paternal lineages = Over the past decade, Chinese archaeologists have published several reviews regarding the results of excavations in Xinjiang. They imply the genetic composition of Xiongnu's supreme ruling class. Particularly interesting are the tombs in the cemetery at Heigouliang, Xinjiang (the Black Gouliang cemetery, also known as the summer palace of the Xiongnu king), east of the Barkol basin, near the city of Hami. By typing results of DNA samples during the excavation of one of the tombs, it was determined that of the 12 men: 6 Q1a* (not Q1a1-M120, not Q1a1b-M25, not Q1a2-M3), 4 Q1b-M378, 2 Q* (not Q1a, not Q1b: unable to determine subclades):Lihongjie, Y-Chromosome Genetic Diversity of the Ancient North Chinese populations, Jilin University-China (2012) In a paper (Lihongjie 2012), the author analyzed the Y-DNAs of the ancient male samples from the 2nd or 1st century BCE cemetery at Heigouliang in Xinjiang ‚Äì which is also believed to be the site of a summer palace for Xiongnu kings ‚Äì which is east of the Barkol basin and near the city of Hami. The Y-DNA of 12 men excavated from the site belonged to Q-MEH2 (Q1a) or Q-M378 (Q1b). The Q-M378 men among them were regarded as hosts of the tombs; half of the Q-MEH2 men appeared to be hosts and the other half as sacrificial victims.  Xianbei people (ancient)  The origins of the Xianbei are unclear. Chinese anthropologist Zhu Hong and Zhang Quanchao studied Xianbei crania from several sites of Inner Mongolia and noticed that anthropological features of studied Xianbei crania show that the racial type is closely related to the modern East-Asian Mongoloids, and some physical characteristics of those skulls are closer to modern Mongols, Manchu and Han Chinese.Anthropology of Archaeological Populations from East- and Central-Asia* = Maternal lineages = Genetic studies published in 2006 and 2015 revealed that the mitochondrial haplogroups of Xianbei remains were of East Asian origin. According to Zhou (2006) the haplogroup frequencies of the Tuoba Xianbei were 43.75% haplogroup D, 31.25% haplogroup C, 12.5% haplogroup B, 6.25% haplogroup A and 6.25% \\"other.\\" Zhou (2014) obtained mitochondrial DNA analysis from 17 Tuoba Xianbei, which indicated that these specimens were, similarly, completely East Asian in their maternal origins, belonging to haplogroups D, C, B, A and haplogroup G. The research also found a relation between Xianbei individuals with modern Oroqen, Ewenki and Outer Mongolian people. Especially Tungusic Oroqen show close relation to Xianbei. Genetic history of Han Chinese A 2018 study calculated pairwise FST (a measure of genetic difference) based on genome-wide SNPs, among the Han Chinese (Northern Han from Beijing and Southern Han from Hunan and Fujian provinces), Japanese and Korean populations sampled. It found that the smallest FST value was between North Han Chinese (CHB) and South Han Chinese (CHS) (FST[CHB-CHS] = 0.0014), while CHB and Korean (KOR) (FST[CHB- KOR] = 0.0026) and between KOR and Japanese (JPT) (FST[JPT-KOR] = 0.0033). Generally, pairwise FST between Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean (0.0026~ 0.0090) are greater than that within Han Chinese (0.0014). These results suggested Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean are different in terms of genetic make-up, and the difference among the three groups are much larger than that between northern and southern Han Chinese. Another study shows that the northern and southern Han Chinese are genetically closest to each other and it finds that the genetic characteristics of present-day northern Han Chinese was already formed as early as three-thousand years ago in the Central Plain area. A recent genetic study on the remains of people (~4000 years BP) from the Mogou site in the Gansu-Qinghai (or Ganqing) region of China revealed more information on the genetic contributions of these ancient Di-Qiang people to the ancestors of the Northern Han. It was deduced that 3300‚Äì3800 years ago some Mogou people had merged into the ancestral Han population, resulting in the Mogou people being similar to some northern Han in sharing up to ~33% paternal (O3a) and ~70% maternal (D, A, F, M10) haplogroups. The mixture rate was possibly 13-18%. The estimated contribution of northern Han to southern Han is substantial in both paternal and maternal lineages and a geographic cline exists for mtDNA. As a result, the northern Han are the primary contributors to the gene pool of the southern Han. However, it is noteworthy that the expansion process was dominated by males, as is shown by a greater contribution to the Y-chromosome than the mtDNA from northern Han to southern Han. These genetic observations are in line with historical records of continuous and large migratory waves of northern China inhabitants escaping warfare and famine, to southern China. Aside from these large migratory waves, other smaller southward migrations occurred during almost all periods in the past two millennia. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences into the gene frequency data of Han subpopulations and ethnic minorities in China, showed that Han subpopulations in different regions are also genetically quite close to the local ethnic minorities, meaning that in many cases, blood of ethnic minorities had mixed into Han, while at the same time, the blood of Han had also mixed into the local ethnic minorities. A study on Armenian admixture in varied populations found 3.9% Armenian-like DNA in some northern Chinese Han. A recent, and to date the most extensive, genome-wide association study of the Han population, shows that geographic-genetic stratification from north to south has occurred and centrally placed populations act as the conduit for outlying ones. Ultimately, with the exception in some ethnolinguistic branches of the Han Chinese, such as Pinghua, there is \\"coherent genetic structure\\" (homogeneity) in all Han Chinese. While Northern Vietnam Kinh people assimilated Han Chinese immigrants into their population, have a sinicized culture and carry the patrilineal Han Chinese O-M7 haplogroup, Cham people carry the patrilineal R-M17 haplogroup of South Asian Indian origin from South Asian merchants spreading Hinduism to Champa and marrying Cham females since Chams have no matrilineal South Asian mtdna and this fits with the matrilocal structure of Cham families. Analysis of Vietnamese Kinh people's genetics show that within the last 800 years there was mixture between a Malay like southern Asian and a Chinese ancestral component that happens to fit the time period in which Kinh expanded south from their Red river delta homeland in Nam ti·∫øn which also matches the event 700 years ago when the Cham population suffered massive losses. Japanese and Middle Eastern merchants as well as other foreigners have travelled to the coast of Vietnam for more than 2,000 years and left genetic traces among Vietnamese due to its location on the Silk Roads and commercial paths. Vietnamese ethnicities descend from groups that migrated to SEA islands and the SEA mainland from the region in China south of the river Yangtze. With the exception of Cham who are Austronesian speaking and Mang who are Austroasiatic speaking, the southern Han Chinese and all other ethnic groups in Vietnam share ancestry. = Paternal lineages = Y-chromosome haplogroup O2-M122 is a common DNA marker in Han Chinese, as it appeared in China in prehistoric times. It is found in more than 50% of Chinese males, and ranging up to over 80% in certain regional subgroups of the Han ethnicity. Other Y-DNA haplogroups that have been found with notable frequency in samples of Han Chinese include O-P203 (15/165 = 9.1%, 47/361 = 13.0%), C-M217 (10/168 = 6.0%, 27/361 = 7.5%, 187/1730 = 10.8%, 20/166 = 12.0%), N-M231 (6/166 = 3.6%, 18/361 = 5.0%, 117/1729 = 6.8%, 17/165 = 10.3%), O-M268(xM95, M176) (54/1147 = 4.7%, 8/168 = 4.8%, 23/361 = 6.4%, 12/166 = 7.2%), and Q-M242 (2/168 = 1.2%, 49/1729 = 2.8%, 12/361 = 3.3%, 48/1147 = 4.2%). However, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Han Chinese increases in diversity as one looks from northern to southern China, which suggests that male migrants from northern China married with women from local peoples after arriving in modern-day Guangdong, Fujian, and other regions of southern China. Despite this, tests comparing the genetic profiles of northern Han, southern Han and southern natives determined that haplogroups O1b-M110, O2a1-M88 and O3d-M7, which are prevalent in southern natives, were only observed in some southern Han (4% on average), but not in northern Han. Therefore, this proves that the male contribution of southern natives in southern Han is limited, assuming that the frequency distribution of Y lineages in southern natives represents that before the expansion of Han culture that started two-thousand years ago. In contrast, there are consistent strong genetic similarities in the Y chromosome haplogroup distribution between the southern and northern Chinese population, and the result of principal component analysis indicates almost all Han populations form a tight cluster in their Y chromosome. However, other research has also shown that the paternal lineages Y-DNA O-M119, O-P201, O-P203 and O-M95 are found in both southern Han Chinese and South Chinese minorities, but more commonly in the latter. In fact, these paternal markers are in turn less frequent in northern Han Chinese. = Maternal lineages = The mitochondrial-DNA haplogroups of the Han Chinese can be classified into the northern East Asian-dominating haplogroups, including A, C, D, G, M8, M9, and Z, and the southern East Asian-dominating haplogroups, including B, F, M7, N*, and R. These haplogroups account for 52.7% and 33.85% of those in the Northern Han, respectively. Among these haplogroups, D, B, F, and A were predominant in the Northern Han, with frequencies of 25.77%, 11.54%, 11.54%, and 8.08%, respectively. However, in the Southern Han, the northern and southern East Asian-dominating haplogroups accounted for 35.62% and 51.91%, respectively. The frequencies of haplogroups D, B, F, and A reached 15.68%, 20.85%, 16.29%, and 5.63%, respectively. Genetic history of Japanese = J≈çmon people = J≈çmon people is the generic name of people who lived in the Japanese archipelago during the J≈çmon period. Today most Japanese historians believe that the Jomon people were not one homogeneous people but were at least two or three distinct groups.  Proposed origin  The origin of the J≈çmon people and their ancestors is disputed. Several theories suggested Southeast Asia or Northeast Asia as possible place of origin. Another theory supported an origin in East Asia itself. Newest genetic studies (since 2017) conclude that the J≈çmon are the last descendants of a unique group of ancient people. The study suggests an origin in modern Central Asia. Another study by Hideaki Kanzawa showed that the J≈çmon people of Hokkaido and Honshu have a genome that is commonly found in Arctic populations but is rare in Yamato people. The study further suggests that the J≈çmon drank alcohol and had wet earwax that is more common in western Eurasians. According to Mitsuru Sakitani the J≈çmon people are an admixture of two distinct ethnic groups: A more ancient group (carriers of Y chromosome D-M55) that were present since more than 30,000 years in Japan and a more recent group (carriers of Y chromosome C1a) that migrated to Japan about 13,000 years ago. Haplogroup D1 arrived from Central Asia to northern Kyushu via the Altai Mountains and the Korean Peninsula more than 40,000 years before present, and Haplogroup D-M55 (D1b) was born in Japanese archipelago. D-M55 is distinct from other D-branches since more than 53,000 years and has five unique mutations not found the others.Â¥éË∞∑Ê∫Ä„ÄéDNA„ÉªËÄÉÂè§„ÉªË®ÄË™û„ÅÆÂ≠¶ÈöõÁ†îÁ©∂„ÅåÁ§∫„ÅôÊñ∞„ÉªÊó•Êú¨ÂàóÂ≥∂Âè≤„ÄèÔºàÂãâË™†Âá∫Áâà 2009Âπ¥Ôºâ(in Japanese) C1a1's ancestral type reached Japan over the Korean Peninsula via the Altai Mountains from Western Asia. Although its age of arrival is unknown, the spread of the existing subgroup is about 12,000 years ago, which is almost consistent with the start of the J≈çmon period. The next relative C1a2 was common in ancient European and West Asian samples and is still found in small numbers of modern Europeans, Armenians, Algerians (Kabyle Berbers), and Nepalis.  Paternal lineages  Recent Y chromosome haplotype testing has led to the hypothesis that male haplogroups D-M55 and C1a1, which have been found in different percentages of samples of modern Japanese, Ryukyuan, and Ainu populations, may reflect patrilineal descent from members of pre-J≈çmon and J≈çmon period of the Japanese Archipelago. Haplogroup D-M55 is found in about 20% to 40% and haplogroup C1a1 in about 6% of modern Japanese people. C1a1 has its highest amount in Tokushima Prefecture at about 10%, followed by Okinawa Prefecture, Aomori Prefecture, and Tokyo at about 7-8%. In addition, it is assumed that the haplogroup C2 existed in a small amount of J≈çmon people.Â¥éË∞∑Ê∫Ä (2009)„ÄéDNA„ÉªËÄÉÂè§„ÉªË®ÄË™û„ÅÆÂ≠¶ÈöõÁ†îÁ©∂„ÅåÁ§∫„ÅôÊñ∞„ÉªÊó•Êú¨ÂàóÂ≥∂Âè≤„ÄèÂãâË™†Âá∫Áâà (in Japanese) Recently it was confirmed that the Japanese branch of haplogroup D-M55 is distinct and isolated from other D-branches since more than 53,000 years. The split between D1a (which is common in Tibet and has a medium distribution in Central Asia) happened likely in Central Asia, while some others suggest an instant split during the origin of haplogroup D itself, as the Japanese branch has five unique mutations not found in any other D-branch.Mondal, Mayukh & Bergstr√∂m, Anders & Xue, Yali & Calafell, Francesc & Laayouni, Hafid & Casals, Ferran & Majumder, Partha & Tyler-Smith, Chris & Bertranpetit, Jaume. (2017). Y-chromosomal sequences of diverse Indian populations and the ancestry of the Andamanese. Human Genetics. 136. 10.1007/s00439-017-1800-0. A recent DNA study in 2019 suggests that haplogroup D-M55 was carried by about 70% and haplogroup C1a1 by about 30% of the ancient J≈çmon people. A specific Japanese-J≈çmon clade is only found in ancient J≈çmon and some modern Japanese. No other population was found to carry this specific clade, which support the distinct position of the J≈çmon population.  Maternal lineages  MtDNA Haplogroup of J≈çmon people is characterized by the presence of haplogroups M7a and N9b. M7a is estimated to share a most recent common ancestor with M7b'c, a clade whose members are found mainly in Japan (including J≈çmon people), other parts of East Asia, and Southeast Asia, 33,500 (95% CI 26,300 <-> 42,000) years before present.YFull MTree 1.01.5902 as of April 20, 2019 All extant members of haplogroup M7a are estimated to share a most recent common ancestor 20,500 (95% CI 14,700 <-> 27,800) years before present. Haplogroup M7a now has its highest frequency in Okinawa. Haplogroup N9b is estimated to share a most recent common ancestor with N9a and Y, two clades that are widespread in eastern Asia, 37,700 (95% CI 29,600 <-> 47,300) years before present. All extant members of haplogroup N9b are estimated to share a most recent common ancestor 21,100 (95% CI 16,700 <-> 26,200) years before present. Haplogroup N9b now has its highest frequency among Tungusic peoples in southeastern Siberia (especially Udeges), but it has been found to be very common in skeletal remains of J≈çmon people of northern Japan (T≈çhoku and Hokkaid≈ç). In addition, haplogroups D4, D5, M7b, M8, M9a, M10, G, A, B, and F have been found in J≈çmon people as well.2017 Â∫¶Á¨¨ÔºîÂõûÊó•Êú¨Êµ∑Â≠¶Ë¨õÂ∫ß 2018Âπ¥1Êúà13Êó•ÔºàÂúüÔºâÂØåÂ±±ÁúåÊ∞ë‰ºöÈ§®611Âè∑ÂÆ§ 14:00ÔΩû15:30 „ÄåÊó•Êú¨Êµ∑Âú∞Âüü„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãÊó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÊ≠¥Âè≤ÔºçÂ∞èÁ´πË≤ùÂ°öÂá∫Âúü‰∫∫È™®„Çí‰∏≠ÂøÉ„Å®„Åó„Å¶Ôºç„Äç ÂõΩÁ´ãÁßëÂ≠¶ÂçöÁâ©È§® Á†îÁ©∂‰∏ªÂππ ÂùÇ‰∏äÂíåÂºòÊ∞èÁØ†Áî∞Ë¨ô‰∏Ä„ÄéÊó•Êú¨‰∫∫„Å´„Å™„Å£„ÅüÁ•ñÂÖà„Åü„Å°‚ÄîDNA„Åã„ÇâËß£Êòé„Åô„Çã„Åù„ÅÆÂ§öÂÖÉÁöÑÊßãÈÄ†„ÄèÊó•Êú¨ÊîæÈÄÅÂá∫ÁâàÂçî‰ºö„ÉªNHK„Éñ„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ„ÄÅ2007Âπ¥ (in Japanese)ÂõΩÁ´ãÁßëÂ≠¶ÂçöÁâ©È§®‰æø„Çä 2014Âπ¥7Êúà 2010Âπ¥Âá∫Âúü‰∫∫È™®„ÅÆÔº§ÔºÆAÂàÜÊûê These latter haplogroups are all distributed widely among populations of East Asia (including modern Japanese, Ryukyuans, and Ainus) and Southeast Asia, but some of their subclades are distributed almost exclusively in Japan. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (\\"mtDNA\\") of J≈çmon skeletons from Hokkaido, Okinawa Island and T≈çhoku region indicates that haplogroups N9b and M7a may reflect maternal J≈çmon contribution to the modern Japanese mtDNA pool. In another study of ancient DNA published by the same authors in 2011, both the control and coding regions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) recovered from J≈çmon skeletons excavated from the northernmost island of Japan, Hokkaido, were analyzed in detail, and 54 mtDNA samples were confidently assigned to relevant haplogroups. Haplogroups N9b, D4h2, G1b, and M7a were observed in these individuals. According to 2013 study, there was mtDNA sub-haplogroups inter-regional heterogeneity within the J≈çmon people, specifically between studied Kant≈ç, Hokkaido and T≈çhoku J≈çmon. According to 2011 study all major East Asian mtDNA lineages expanded before 10,000 YBP, except for two Japanese lineages D4b2b1 and M7a1a which population expanded around 7,000 YBP unequivocally during the J≈çmon Period (14‚Äì2.3 kya), thousands of years before intensive agriculture which imply that the growth of population and depletion of food resources was the reason for population expansion and not agriculture. A study about maternal DNA of J≈çmon individuals resulted in similarities between Jomon people and ancient Siberian people. Interestingly, the study also suggests a relation of some Jomon people to at least some Native American groups.  Autosomal DNA  A 2017 study on ancient Jomon aDNA from Sanganji shell mound in T≈çhoku region estimates that the modern mainland Japanese population probably inherited less than ~20% of J≈çmon peoples' genomes. The first full genomic DNA analysis of J≈çmon individuals by Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama of the department of genetics in the University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI) showed that the J≈çmon people are not closely related to any modern ethnic group. His analysis groups the J≈çmon people into a unique genetic cluster far away from any modern ethnic groups. Hideaki says that some J≈çmon DNA is found in modern ethnic groups, such as Japanese people, Udege people, Nivkh people, Ainu people and Ryukyuan people. From all ethnic groups, the Ainu and Ryukyuans show the closest relation to ancient J≈çmon people. Compared with populations worldwide, the Jomon are relatively close to modern Ryukyuans, Ainu and Yamato Japanese. A DNA-based reconstruction of a 3,800-year old Jomon woman of Rebun Island in Hokkaido showed that she had slightly darker skin than modern Japanese people but a lighter eye colour. She also had freckles and thin brown hair. A full genome analysis (Kanzawa-Kiriyama et al. 2019), using high-confidence SNPs and functional SNP assessments to assign possible phenotypic characteristics as well as Y-chromosome polymorphisms, analysed a male and a female Jomon sample. The study results suggest that the J≈çmon are their own distinct population and not closely related to other populations. The Funadomari J≈çmon are not related to Australo-Melanesians (including Andamanese) or Africans. The J≈çmon are closer to Eurasian populations and form a cluster near the ‚ÄúBasal East Asians‚Äù. Modern Japanese share about 9% to 13% of their genome with the J≈çmon. J≈çmon specific genome is also found in minor percentage in populations of Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, suggesting gene-flow from J≈çmon related groups. Additionally, the J≈çmon share specific gene alleles with populations in the Arctic regions of Eurasia and northern America. Tests using phylogenetic relationship suggests that the Funadomari J≈çmon have about 86% East Asian related ancestry and about 14% West Asian/European related ancestry. According to the scientists, more data is needed to explain these results. A full genome analysis published in the Cambridge University Press in 2020, analysed for the first time the complete genome of several J≈çmon samples. The results were \\"rather surprising\\" and complicate the peopling of Asia. The J≈çmon people were found to be genetically distinct and not related to \\"Basal-Asians\\" (such as the Tianyuan and Hoabhinians). This disproves the hypothese of a possible Southeast Asian origin for the J≈çmon which was proposed by a small amount of scholars. The J≈çmon share relatively most genome with Paleolithic Siberians, as well as with modern people in Japan and various groups around the Sea of Okhotsk. = Yayoi people = The Yayoi people were migrants to the Japanese archipelago from Asia (Korea or China) during the Yayoi period (1000 BCE-300 CE) and Kofun period (250‚Äì538 CE). They are seen as direct ancestors of the modern Yamato people, the majority of Japanese and of the Ryukyuan people. It is estimated that modern Japanese share in average about 90% of their genome with the Yayoi.  Paternal lineages  It is estimated that Yayoi people mainly belonged to Haplogroup O-M176 (O1b2) (found in ~32% of present-day Japanese males), Haplogroup O-M122 (O2, formerly O3, today ~20%), Haplogroup O-K18 (O1b1, today ~1%), and Haplogroup O-M119 (O1a, today ~1%), which are typical for East and Southeast Asians. Mitsuru Sakitani suggests that haplogroup O1b2, which is common in today's Japanese, Koreans, and some Manchu, and O1a are one of the carriers of Yangtze civilization. As the Yangtze civilization declined several tribes crossed westward and northerly, to the Shandong peninsula, the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago.Â¥éË∞∑Ê∫Ä„ÄéDNA„ÉªËÄÉÂè§„ÉªË®ÄË™û„ÅÆÂ≠¶ÈöõÁ†îÁ©∂„ÅåÁ§∫„ÅôÊñ∞„ÉªÊó•Êú¨ÂàóÂ≥∂Âè≤„Äè(ÂãâË™†Âá∫Áâà 2009Âπ¥ One study calls haplogroup O1b1 as a major Austroasiatic paternal lineage and the haplogroup O1b2 (of Koreans and Japanese) as a \\"para-Austroasiatic\\" paternal lineage.  Maternal lineages  A recent study confirms that modern Japanese are predominantly descendants of the Yayoi. The mitochondrial chromosomes of modern Japanese are nearly identical with the Yayoi and differ significantly from the Jomon population (see below). =Modern Japanese= Paternal lineages The main paternal haplogroups of modern Yamato Japanese are Haplogroup D-M55 (today ~33%, with the frequency in various samples ranging from 18/70 = 25.7% in a sample from Tokushima Prefecture to 24/59 = 40.7% in a sample of Japanese male volunteers and 11/27 = 40.7% in a sample from Aomori Prefecture), Haplogroup O-M176 (O1b2) (today ~32%, range 37/142 = 26.1% in a sample of Japanese to 35/97 = 36.1% in a sample from Western Japan), Haplogroup O-M122 (O2, formerly O3) (today ~20%, ranging from 4/59 = 6.8% in a sample of Japanese volunteers and 11/102 = 10.8% in a sample of adults from Fukuoka to 38/157 = 24.2% in a sample of Japanese and 14/53 = 26.4% in a sample from Kyushu), Haplogroup C-M217 (C2, today ~6%, ranging from 0/26 = 0.0% in a sample from Aomori, 1/61 = 1.6% in a sample from Shizuoka, 1/47 = 2.1% in a sample of Japanese, and 3/137 = 2.2% in a sample from the Kant≈ç region to 15/206 = 7.3% in a sample from Sapporo, 18/241 = 7.5% in a sample from Osaka, 4/53 = 7.5% in a sample from Kyushu, and 8/102 = 7.8% in a sample from Fukuoka), and Haplogroup C-M8 (C1a1, today ~5%, ranging from 0/53 = 0.0% in a sample from Kyushu to 7/70 = 10.0% in a sample from Tokushima). Haplogroups N-M231, O-M119, O-K18, and Q-M242 also have been observed with low frequency among present-day Japanese. A comprehensive study of worldwide Y-DNA diversity (Underhill et al. 2000) included a sample of 23 males from Japan, of whom eight (35%) belonged to haplogroup D-M174, six (26%) belonged to O-M175, five (22%) belonged to O-M122, three (13%) belonged to C-M8 and C-M130, and one (4.3%) belonged to N-M128. Among 259 males from Japan (70 from Tokushima, 61 from Shizuoka, 53 from Ky≈´sh≈´, 45 from Okinawa, 26 from Aomori, and 4 Ainus) whose Y-DNA has been examined in a 2005 study by Michael F. Hammer, ninety (34.7%) belong to haplogroup D-M55, eighty-two (31.7%) belong to haplogroup O-P31 (including 22% O-47z, 7.7% O-M176(x47z), and 1.9% O-M95(xM111)), fifty-two (20.1%) belong to haplogroup O-M122, fourteen (5.4%) belong to haplogroup C-M8, ten (3.9%) belong to haplogroup NO-M214(xO-M175) (including 2.3% NO-M214(xO-M175, N-LLY22g), 1.2% haplogroup N-LLY22g(xM128, P43, M178), and 0.4% haplogroup N-M178), and eight (3.1%) belong to haplogroup C-M217 (including 1.9% haplogroup C-M217(xM86) and 1.2% haplogroup C-M86). The patrilines belonging to D-P37.1 were found in all the Japanese samples, but were more frequently found in the Ainu (75.0%) and Okinawa (55.6%) samples and less frequently found in the Tokushima (25.7%) and Ky≈´sh≈´ samples (26.4%). Haplogroups O-M175 and C-M8 were not found in the small Ainu sample of four individuals, and C-M217 was not found in the Okinawa sample of 45 individuals. Haplogroup N was detected in samples of Japanese from Aomori (2/26 N-LLY22g(xM128, P43, M178)), Shizuoka (1/61 N-LLY22g(xM128, P43, M178)), and Tokushima (1/70 N-M178), but was not found in the Ky≈´sh≈´, Okinawa, or Ainu samples. This study, and others, report that Y-chromosome patrilines crossed from the Asian mainland into the Japanese archipelago, and continue to make up a large proportion of the Japanese male lineage. If focusing haplogroup O-P31 in those researches, the patrilines derived from its subclade O-SRY465 are frequently found in both Japanese (mean 32%,238/744 = 32.0% O2b-SRY465 in a pool of all Japanese samples of Xue et al. (2006), Katoh et al. (2004), Han- Jun Jin et al. (2009), Nonaka et al. (2007), and all non-Ainu and non-Okinawan Japanese samples of Hammer et al. (2006). with frequency in various samples ranging from 26% to 36%) and Koreans (mean 30%,202/677 = 29.8% O2b-SRY465 in a pool of all ethnic Korean samples of Hammer et al. (2006), Xue et al. (2006), Katoh et al. (2004), Wook Kim et al. (2007), and Han-Jun Jin et al. (2009). with frequency in various samples ranging from 19% to 40%). According to the research, these patrilines have undergone extensive genetic admixture with the J≈çmon period populations previously established in Japan. A 2007 study by Nonaka et al. reported that among a total of 263 healthy unrelated Japanese male individuals born in 40 of the 47 prefectures of Japan, but especially Tokyo (n=51), Chiba (n=45), Kanagawa (n=14), Saitama (n=13), Shizuoka (n=12), and Nagano (n=11), the frequencies of the D2, O2b, and O3 lineages were 38.8%, 33.5%, and 16.7%, respectively, which constituted approximately 90% of the Japanese population. Haplogroup diversity for the binary polymorphisms was calculated to be 86.3%. Poznik et al. (2016) have reported that the males in the JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) sampleThe JPT sample is considered \\"as generally representative of the majority population in Japan\\". See of the 1000 Genomes Project are 20/56 = 36% D2-M179, 18/56 = 32% O2b-M176, 10/56 = 18% O3-M122, 4/56 = 7.1% C1a1-M8, 2/56 = 3.6% O2a-K18, and 2/56 = 3.6% C2-M217. In a project approved by the Ethics Committee of Tokai University School of Medicine, Ochiai et al. (2016) have reported finding D-M174 (rs2032602 T>C) in 24/59 (40.7%), O-M268 (rs13447443 A>G) in 21/59 (35.6%), C-M130 (rs35284970 C>T) in 8/59 (13.6%), O-P198 (rs17269816 T>C) in 4/59 (6.8%), N-M231 (rs9341278 G>A) in 1/59 (1.7%), and O-P186(xM268, P198) (rs16981290 C>A, rs13447443 A, rs17269816 T) in 1/59 (1.7%) of a sample obtained through buccal swabs from Japanese male volunteers (n = 59) who had given informed consent to participate in the study. Maternal lineages According to an analysis of the 1000 Genomes Project's sample of Japanese collected in the Tokyo metropolitan area, the mtDNA haplogroups found among modern Japanese include D (42/118 = 35.6%, including 39/118 = 33.1% D4 and 3/118 = 2.5% D5), B (16/118 = 13.6%, including 11/118 = 9.3% B4 and 5/118 = 4.2% B5), M7 (12/118 = 10.2%), G (12/118 = 10.2%), N9 (10/118 = 8.5%), F (9/118 = 7.6%), A (8/118 = 6.8%), Z (4/118 = 3.4%), M9 (3/118 = 2.5%), and M8 (2/118 = 1.7%). Single-nucleotide polymorphism A 2011 SNP consortium study done by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Max Planck Society consisting of 1719 DNA samples determined that Koreans and Japanese clustered near to each other, confirming the findings of an earlier study that Koreans and Japanese are related. However, the Japanese were found to be genetically closer to South Asian populations as evident by a genetic position that is significantly closer towards South Asian populations on the principal component analysis (PCA) chart. Some Japanese individuals are also genetically closer to Southeast Asian and Melanesian populations when compared to other East Asians such as Koreans and Han Chinese, indicating possible genetic interactions between Japanese and these populations. A 2008 study about genome-wide SNPs of East Asians by Chao Tian et al. reported that Japanese along with other East Asians such as Joseon Koreans and Han Chinese are genetically distinguishable from Southeast Asians and that the Japanese are related to Koreans, who in turn are more closely related to Han Chinese. However, the Japanese are relatively genetically distant from Han Chinese, compared to Koreans. Another study (2017) shows a relative strong relation between all East and Southeast Asians. Immunoglobulin G Hideo Matsumoto, professor emeritus at Osaka Medical College tested Gm types, genetic markers of immunoglobulin G, of Japanese populations for a 2009 study. According to this study, the Gm ab3st gene is found at notably high frequencies across eastern Siberia, northern China, Korea, Mongolia, Japan, and Tibet. The mean frequency of Gm ab3st for the mainstream Japanese population was found to be 26.0%, with a peak in the Yaeyama Islands (36.4% Yonaguni, 32.1% Ishigaki) among all populations in Japan and peaks in Akita (29.5%) and Shizunai (28.3%) among mainstream Japanese. On mainland Asia, peak frequencies of Gm ab3st were found among Oroqen (44.0%) and Tungus (30.0%) in northeast China and among the north Baikal Buryats (30.7%); however, this gene is also frequent among Eskimos (25.4% Alaska, 24.7% Greenland, 20.5% Chaplin, Russia), Luoravetlans (Koryak 20.0%, Chukchi 15.3%), and Athabaskans (New Mexico Apache 19.7%, Alaska Athabascan 14.3%), and it is not uncommon even as far west as the south shore of the Caspian Sea (8.8% Gilani, 8.5% Mazanderani). Minimum frequencies of Gm ab3st were found in Yakushima (22.0%) among all populations in Japan and in Tsu (23.3%) and ≈åita (23.6%) among mainstream Japanese. The data from small, isolated island populations, such as those of Yonaguni, Ishigaki, and Yakushima, were not used when calculating the mean for the mainstream Japanese population. The study also considered Ainu and Korean populations and found Gm ab3st with a frequency of 25.2% among Ainu in Hidaka, Hokkaido and a mean frequency of 14.5% (range 13.1% Pusan, South Korea to 18.6% Yanji, China) among Koreans. Gm afb1b3, on the other hand, is a southern marker gene possibly originating in southern China on the background of the fb1b3 gene (the modal Gm type among Caucasoids) and found at very high frequencies across southern China, Southeast Asia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Assam, and the Pacific Islands. Professor Matsumoto has remarked that the center of dispersal of the Gm afb1b3 gene may be in the Yunnan and Guangxi area of southern China; extremely high frequencies of this gene have been observed in samples of mostly Daic peoples from this region (95.2% Shui in Sandu, Guizhou, 94.2% Zhuang in Guangxi, 91.4% Bouyei in Duyun, Guizhou, 87.5% Miao in Guizhou, 84.0% Dai in Luxi, Yunnan) and from neighboring Laos (97.0% Laotian) and Thailand (89.9% Thai). However, Gm afb1b3 is almost equally common among people in Malaysia (97.3% Kadazan on Borneo, 85.0% Malay), Indonesia (76.6% Sulawesi, 75.2% Java), the Philippines (83.6% Luzon Filipinos, 76.4% Luzon Negritos, 67.2% Mindanao Negritos), Karen people in Thailand (82.3%), Kacharis in Assam (80.9%), Cambodians (76.7%), Taiwanese aborigines (76.2%), Micronesians (88.7%), Melanesians (74.6%), and Polynesians (74.7% Cook Islands, 69.4% Hawaii). The study found that the mean frequency of Gm afb1b3 was 10.6% (range 7.8% Shizunai to 13.0% Osaka) for the general Japanese population. Minimum frequencies (4.0% to 4.4%) of Gm afb1b3 were found among the native people in the Yaeyama and Miyako islands in the extreme south of Japan and among the Ainu (4.3%) in the extreme north of Japan. The author suggested that the somewhat elevated frequency of the Gm afb1b3 gene among the mainstream Japanese compared to the Sakishima islanders and the Ainu may have resulted from some admixture of the mainstream Japanese population at rates as low as 7‚Äì8% with southern Asian (from southern China or Southeast Asia as far west as Bangladesh and Nepal) populations having the Gm afb1b3 gene in high frequency. The other Gm types observed among Japanese are ag (45.8%) and axg (17.6%), which are not so useful for discerning human migrations and genetic relationships because they appear to be retained from a common ancestor of most modern humans and are found in similar proportions (with the frequency of ag being significantly greater than the frequency of axg) in many populations all over the world (aboriginal Australians and Americans, South Asians, Caucasoids, etc.).  Genetic components compared with other Asian populations  A 2017 study conducted by Fumihiko Takeuchi, Tomohiro Katsuya, Ryosuke Kimura and Norihiro Kato compared three genetically distinct Japanese groups, Hondu (Honshu), Ryukyu and Ainu to 26 other Asian populations to analyze the shared ancestry and genetic differentiation between the Japanese people and other Asians. The study revealed for the Japanese as a whole, some genetic components from all of the Central, East, Southeast and South Asian populations are prevalent in the Japanese population with the major components of ancestry profile coming from the Korean and Han Chinese clusters. The major components of the Japanese Hondo cluster is similar to the Korean (87‚Äì94%), followed by Han Chinese 1 (0‚Äì8%) clusters. The genetic components from the Southeast Asian (Thais, Vietnamese and Malays) and South Asian (Sinhalese and Tamils) clusters were larger for the Ryukyu cluster ‚Äì Southeast Asian (4‚Äì6%) and South Asian (4‚Äì6%) ‚Äì in comparison to the results found in the Hondo cluster ‚Äì Southeast Asian (0‚Äì1%) and South Asian (1‚Äì2%).  Yayoi Origins of the Modern Japanese  A recent study (2018) shows that the Japanese are predominantly descendants of the Yayoi people and are closely related to other modern East Asians, especially Koreans and Han Chinese. It is estimated that the majority of Japanese only has about 12% J≈çmon ancestry or even less. Recent studies suggest that the Japanese people are predominantly descendants of the Yayoi people, and that the Yayoi largely displaced the local J≈çmon. A genome research (Takahashi et al. 2019) shows that modern Japanese (Yamato) do not have much J≈çmon ancestry at all. Nuclear genome analysis of J≈çmon samples and modern Japanese samples show strong differences. A more recent study by Gakihari et al. 2019 estimate the gene- flow from J≈çmon people into modern Japanese people at only 3,3% and that modern Japanese cluster closely with other East Asians but are clearly distinct from the Ainu people. Genetic history of Koreans Studies of polymorphisms in the human Y-chromosome have so far produced evidence to suggest that the Korean people have a long history as a distinct, mostly endogamous ethnic group, with successive waves of people moving to the peninsula and three major Y-chromosome haplogroups. The reference population for Koreans used in Geno 2.0 Next Generation is 94% Eastern Asia and 5% Southeast Asia & Oceania.Reference Populations ‚Äì Geno 2.0 Next Generation . (2017). The Genographic Project. Retrieved 15 May 2017, from link. Several studies confirmed that Koreans are basically a Northeast Asian population, but that Korean populations have both Northeast and Southeast Asian genome. =Paternal lineages= Jin Han-jun et al. (2003) said that the distribution of Y-chromosomal haplogroups shows that Koreans have a complex origin that results from genetic contributions from range expansions, most of which are from southern-to-northern China, and genetic contributions from the northern Asian settlement. Korean males display a high frequency of Haplogroup O-M176 (O1b2, formerly O2b), a subclade that probably has spread mainly from somewhere in the Korean Peninsula or its vicinity, and Haplogroup O-M122 (O2, formerly O3), a common Y-DNA haplogroup among East and Southeast Asians in general. Haplogroup O1b2-M176 has been found in approximately 30% (ranging from 20% to 37%) of sampled Korean males, while haplogroup O2-M122 has been found in approximately 40% of sampled Korean males. Korean males also exhibit a moderate frequency (approximately 15%) of Haplogroup C-M217. About 2% of Korean males belong to Haplogroup D-M174 (0/216 = 0.0% DE-YAP, 3/300 = 1.0% DE-M145, 1/68 = 1.5% DE-YAP(xE-SRY4064), 8/506 = 1.6% D1b-M55, 3/154 = 1.9% DE, 18/706 = 2.55% D-M174, 5/164 = 3.0% D-M174, 1/75 D1b*-P37.1(xD1b1-M116.1) + 2/75 D1b1a-M125(xD1b1a1-P42) = 3/75 = 4.0% D1b-P37.1, 3/45 = 6.7% D-M174). The D1b-M55 subclade has been found with maximal frequency in a small sample (n=16) of the Ainu people of Japan, and is generally frequent throughout the Japanese Archipelago. Other haplogroups that have been found less commonly in samples of Korean males are Y-DNA haplogroup N-M231 (approx. 4%), haplogroup O-M119 (approx. 3%), haplogroup O-M268(xM176) (approx. 2%), haplogroup Q-M242 and Haplogroup R1 (approx. 2% total), J, Y*(xA, C, DE, J, K), L, C-RPS4Y(xM105, M38, M217), and C-M105. Korea Foundation Associate Professor of History, Eugene Y. Park, said that there is no correlation between a Korean person's Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup and their surname or ancestral seat.Eugene Y. Park. (n.d.). Penn Arts & Sciences East Asian Languages and Civilizations. Retrieved January 24, 2018, from link. In a YouTube video which was published on May 18, 2015, from the 9:09 mark of the video to 9:56 mark of the video, Korea Foundation Associate Professor of History, Eugene Y. Park said, \\"Unlike the Jewish people, Jewish males with the traditionally priestly surnames such as the Levi, Levine, Cohen, and others, who claim that they're descended from Moses's brother, Aaron, and the Y-DNA analysis actually shows that the majority of the Jewish men with the, such surnames, descend from a single male, who lived about a hundred generations ago, around the time of the Exodus. In complete, in stark contrast, Y-DNA analysis shows that there's no correlation between Y-DNA haplotype or haplogroup, and a Korean person's surname or ancestral seat. It's fairly random.\\" He Miao et al. (2009) created an artificial combination of equal parts of the Y-chromsomes of the HapMap samples of Han Chinese in Beijing and Japanese in Tokyo. The study said that this artificial combination resembled five populations which included Koreans in South Korea and Koreans in China. =Maternal lineages= Studies of Korean mitochondrial DNA lineages have shown that there is a high frequency of Haplogroup D4, ranging from approximately 23% (11/48) among ethnic Koreans in Arun Banner, Inner Mongolia to approximately 32% (33/103) among Koreans from South Korea. Haplogroup D4 is the modal mtDNA haplogroup among northern East Asians (Japanese, Ryukyuans, Koreans, Manchus, Oroqens, Manchurian Evenks, Daurs, Mongols, northern Han Chinese, Tibetans) in general, with a peak frequency among Japanese and Ryukyuans in Japan. Haplogroup B, which occurs very frequently in many populations of Southeast Asia, Polynesia, and the Americas, is found in approximately 10% (5/48 ethnic Koreans from Arun Banner, Inner Mongolia) to 20% (21/103 Koreans from South Korea) of Koreans. Haplogroup A has been detected in approximately 7% (7/103 Koreans from South Korea) to 15% (7/48 ethnic Koreans from Arun Banner, Inner Mongolia) of Koreans. Haplogroup A is the most common mtDNA haplogroup among the Chukchi, Eskimo, Na-Dene, and many Amerind ethnic groups of North and Central America. The other half of the Korean mtDNA pool consists of an assortment of various haplogroups, each found with relatively low frequency, such as G, N9, Y, F, D5, M7, M8, M9, M10, M11, R11, C, and Z. A study of the mtDNA of 708 Koreans sampled from six regions of South Korea (134 from Seoul-Gyeonggi, 118 from Jeolla, 117 from Chungcheong, 114 from Gangwon, 113 from Jeju, and 112 from Gyeongsang) found that they belonged to haplogroup D (35.5%, including 14.7% D4(xD4a, D4b), 7.8% D4a, 6.5% D5, 6.4% D4b, and 0.14% D(xD4, D5)), haplogroup B (14.8%, including 11.0% B4 and 3.8% B5), haplogroup A (8.3%), haplogroup M7 (7.6%), haplogroup F (7.1%), haplogroup M8'CZ (6.5%), haplogroup G (6.1%), haplogroup N9a (5.2%), haplogroup Y (3.8%), haplogroup M9 (2.7%), haplogroup M10 (1.6%), haplogroup M11 (0.42%), haplogroup N(xN9, Y, A, F, B4, B5) (0.28%), and haplogroup N9(xN9a) (0.14%). A study of 1094 individuals in the Korean Genome Project found that they belonged to haplogroup D (34.19%), haplogroup B (13.89%), haplogroup M(xC, D, G, Z) (13.8%), haplogroup A (8.32%), haplogroup G (8.23%), haplogroup F (7.86%), haplogroup N(xA, B, F, R, Y) (5.76%), haplogroup C (3.02%), haplogroup R(xB, F) (2.01%), haplogroup Y (1.74%), and haplogroup Z (1.19%). The individuals sampled for the Korean Genome Project are mostly from the Ulsan metropolitan region. = Autosomal DNA = Jin Han-jun et al. (1999) said that, based on genetic studies of classic genetic markers of protein and nuclear DNA, Koreans tend to be closely genetically related to Mongols among East Asians, which is supported by the following studies: Goedde et al. (1987); Saha & Tay (1992); Hong et al. (1993); and Nei & Roychoudhury (1993). The study said that the mtDNA 9‚Äêbp deletion frequency in the intergenic COII/tRNALys region of Mongols (5.1%) is lower than that of Chinese (14.2%), Japanese (14.3%) and Koreans (15.5%). The study said that these 9‚Äêbp deletion frequencies suggest that Koreans are closely related to Japanese and Chinese and that Koreans are not so closely related to Mongols. The study said that the homogeneity in the 9-bp deletion frequencies among Chinese (14.2%), Japanese (14.3%) and Koreans (15.5%), only spanning from a low of 14.2% for Chinese to a high of 15.5% for Koreans, indicates that very few mtDNA are differentiated in these three populations. The study said that the 9‚Äêbp deletion frequencies for Vietnamese (23.2%) and Indonesians (25.0%), which are the two populations constituting Mongoloid Southeast Asians in the study, are relatively high frequencies when compared to the 9-bp deletion frequencies for Mongols(5.1%), Chinese (14.2%), Japanese (14.3%) and Koreans (15.5%), which are the four populations constituting Northeast Asians in the study. The study said that these 9-bp deletion frequencies are consistent with earlier surveys which showed that 9-bp deletion frequencies increase going from Japan to mainland Asia to the Malay Peninsula, which is supported by the following studies: Horai et al. (1987); Hertzberg et al. (1989); Stoneking & Wilson (1989); Horai (1991); Ballinger et al. (1992); Hanihara et al. (1992); and Chen et al. (1995). The study said that Cavalli-Sforza's chord genetic distance (4D), from Cavalli-Sforza & Bodmer (1971), which is based on the allele frequencies of the intergenic COII/tRNALys region, showed that Koreans are more genetically related to Japanese than Koreans are genetically related to the other East Asian populations which were surveyed. The Cavalli-Sforza's chord genetic distance (4D) between Koreans and other East Asian populations in the study, from least to greatest, are as follows: Korean to Japanese (0.0019), Korean to Chinese (0.0141), Korean to Vietnamese (0.0265), Korean to Indonesian (0.0316) and Korean to Mongols (0.0403). The study said that the close genetic affinity between present-day Koreans and Japanese is expected due to the Yayoi migration from China and the Korean Peninsula to Japan which began about 2,300 years ago, a migration which is supported by the following studies: Chard (1974); Hanihara (1991); Hammer & Horai (1995); Horai et al. (1996); Omoto & Saitou (1997). The study said that Horai et al. (1996) detected mtDNA D-loop variation which supports the idea that a large amount of maternal lineages came into Japan from immigrants from the Korean Peninsula after the Yayoi period. Wook et al. (2000) said that Chu et al. (1998) found that phylogeny which was based on 30 microsatellites indicated that Korean people were closely related to Chinese people from Manchuria and Yunnan, but Kim Wook et al. (2000) found that the high incidence of the DXYS156Y-null variant in northeast Chinese implied that it is possible to exclude these northeastern Chinese populations from being sources which are significant in Korean people. The phylogenetic analysis done by Wook et al. (2000) indicated that Japanese people are genetically closer to Korean people than Japanese people are genetically related to any of the following peoples: Mongolians, Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesians, Filipinos and Thais. The study said that mainland Japanese having Koreans as their closest genetic population is consistent with the following previous studies: Hammer and Horai (1995); Horai et al. (1996); and Kim et al. (1998). The study found that Koreans are more genetically homogenous than the Japanese, and the study said that this might be due to different sizes of the founding populations and range expansions. The study said that the moderate mean Y-chromosome haplotype diversity value for Koreans might be the result of migrations from East Asia that had a homogenizing influence. The study said that it is more probable that Koreans descend from dual infusions of Y-chromosomes from two different waves of East Asians rather than a single East Asian population due to the dual patterns of the Y-chromosome haplotype distribution found in Koreans. Kim Jong-jin et al. (2005) did a study about the genetic relationships among East Asians based on allele frequencies, particularly focusing on how close Chinese, Japanese and Koreans are genetically related to each other. Most Koreans were hard to distinguish from Japanese, and the study was not able to clearly distinguish Koreans and Japanese. Koreans and Japanese clustered together in the principal component analysis and the best least-squares tree. The study said that \\"[c]ommon ancestry and/or extensive gene flow\\" historically between Koreans and Japanese appears to be \\"likely\\" and results in a lot of difficulty finding population-specific alleles that could assist in differentiating Koreans and Japanese. Jung Jongsun et al. (2010) used the following Korean samples for a study: Southeast Korean (sample regions: Gyeongju, Goryeong and Ulsan), Middle West Korean (sample regions: Jecheon, Yeoncheon, Cheonan and Pyeongchang) and Southwest Korean (sample regions: Gimje, Naju and Jeju). Due to political reasons, the study said that it did not use North Korean samples, but the study said that the \\"historical migration event of Baekje from Goguryeo Empire (BC 37‚ÄìAD 668) in Northern Korea imply that Northern lineages remain in South Korea.\\" The study said that the \\"Northern people of the Goguryeo Empire\\" are closely related to Mongolians, and the study said that this group of people ruled most of Southwest Korea. The study said that \\"some of the royal families and their subjects in the Goguryeo Empire moved to this region and formed the Baekje Empire in BC 18‚Äì22.\\" Southwest Koreans are closer to Mongolians in the study's genome map than the other two Korean regions in the study are close to Mongolians. Southwest Koreans also display genetic connections with the HapMap sample of Japanese in Tokyo, and, in the neighbor joining tree, the nodes for Southwest Korea are close to Japan. In the study's Korea-China-Japan genome map, some Southwest Korean samples overlap with samples from Japan. The study said that the fairly close relationship, in both the study's genetic structure analysis and genome map, of the Jeju Southwest Korean sample and the HapMap sample of Japanese in Tokyo, Japan, has made the evolutionary relationship of Chinese, Japanese and Koreans become clearer. Southeast Koreans display some genetic similarity with people of Kobe, Japan, which indicates that there might have been links between these regions. The study said that it is possible that outliers in the Gyeongju sample, one of the sampled Southeast Korean regions, and outliers in the Kobe, Japan, sample both have Siberian lineage due to Southeast Koreans having connections with Siberian lineages with respect to grave patterns and culture. The overall result for the study's Korea-Japan-China genome map indicates that some signals for Siberia remain in Southeast Korea. In contrast to the Gyeongju sample, the Goryeong and Ulsan samples, which are both Southeast Korean samples, displayed average signals for the Korean Peninsula. The study said that Middle West Korea was a melting pot in the Korean Peninsula with people traveling from North to South, South to North, and people traveling from East China, including from the Shandong Peninsula. Western Chinese, which included those in the Shandong Peninsula, travelled across the Yellow Sea, and these Western Chinese lived and traded in both China and Korea. In the study's genome map, Middle West Koreans are close to the HapMap sample of Han Chinese in Beijing and, in the neighbor joining tree, the nodes for Middle West Korea are close to China. The overall result for the study's Korea-Japan-China genome map indicates that Middle West Korea displays an average signal for South Korea. Chinese people are located between Korean and Vietnamese people in the study's genome map. Kim Young-jin and Jin Han-jun (2013) said that principal component analysis had Korean HapMap samples clustering with neighboring East Asian populations which were geographically nearby them such as the Chinese and Japanese. The study said that Koreans are genetically closely related to Japanese in comparison to Koreans' genetic relatedness to other East Asians which included the following East and Southeast Asian peoples: Tujia, Miao, Daur, She, Mongols, Naxi, Cambodians, Oroqen, Yakuts, Yi, Southern Han Chinese, Northern Han Chinese, Hezhen, Xibo, Lahu, Dai and Tu. The study said that the close genetic relatedness of Koreans to Japanese has been reported in the following previous studies: Kivisild et al. (2002); Jin et al. (2003); Jin et al. (2009); and Underhill and Kivisild (2007). The study said that Jung et al. (2010) said that there is a genetic substructure in Koreans, but the study said that it found Korean HapMap individuals to be highly genetically similar. The study said that Jin et al. (2009) found that Koreans from different populations are not different in a significant way which indicates that Koreans are genetically homogenous. The study said that the affinity of Koreans is predominately Southeast Asian with an estimated admixture of 79% Southeast Asian and 21% Northeast Asian for Koreans, but the study said that this does not mean that Koreans are heterogenous, because all of the Koreans which were analyzed uniformly displayed a dual pattern of Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian origins. The study said that Koreans and Japanese displayed no observable difference between each other in their proportion of Southeast Asian and Northeast Asian admixture. The study said the 79% Southeast Asian and 21% Northeast Asian admixture estimate for Koreans is consistent with the interpretation of Jin et al. (2009) that Koreans descend from a Northeast Asian population which was subsequently followed by a male-centric migration from the southern region of Asia which changed both the autosomal composition and Y-chromosomes in the Korean population. Veronika Siska et al. (2017) said that the Ulchi people are genetically closest in the study's panel to the human remains from the Devil's Gate Cave which are dated to about 7,700 years ago. Modern Korean and Japanese, the Oroqen people and the Hezhen people display a high affinity to the human remains from Devil's Gate Cave. Considering the geographic distance of Amerindians from Devil's Gate Cave, Amerindians are unusually genetically close to the human remains from Devil's Gate Cave. Korean genomes display similar traits to Japanese genomes on genome-wide SNP data. In an admixture analysis, when the genes of Devil's Gate is made into a unique genetic component, this new Devil's Gate genetic component is highest in peoples of the Amur Basin, including Ulchi, and makes up about more than 50% of Koreans and Japanese. It also has a sporadic distribution among other East Asians, Central Asians and Southeast Asians. = Immunoglobulin G = Hideo Matsumoto, professor emeritus at Osaka Medical College, tested Gm types, genetic markers of immunoglobulin G, of Korean populations for a 2009 study. The Korean populations were populations in Jeju Island, Busan, Gwangju, Kongsan, Jeonju, Wonju, the Kannung of South Korea and a Korean population in Yanji. Matsumoto said that the Gm ab3st gene is a marker for northern Mongoloid possibly originating in Siberia and found at high frequencies across northeast Asia and Tibet. Matsumoto said that the average frequency of Gm ab3st for Koreans was 14.5% which was intermediate between an average frequency of 26% for general Japanese and a frequency of 11.7% which was for a Han Chinese population in Beijing. Matsumoto said that Gm afb1b3 is a southern marker gene possibly originating in southern China and found at high frequencies across Southeast Asia, southern China, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Assam and parts of the Pacific. However, given the result that the Okinawans being genetically most northern among the Japanese with the highest frequency of the Gm ab3st gene which is assigned to be northern, the term northern and southern used in his study is controversial. Matsumoto said that the average frequency of Gm afb1b3 for Koreans was 14.7% which was intermediate between a frequency of 10.6% for general Japanese and a frequency of 24.1% for Beijing Han Chinese. Matsumoto said that Koreans displayed the northern Mongoloid pattern, but Matsumoto said that Koreans displayed a higher frequency of the southern marker gene, Gm afb1b3, than the Japanese. Matsumoto said that \\"Japanese and Korean populations were originally identical or extremely close to each other\\", and Matsumoto said, \\"It seemed to be during the formation of the contemporary Korean population that such a Gm pattern intermediate between Japanese and the northern Han in China emerged.\\" Matsumoto said that the different Gm pattern between Japanese and Koreans most likely came about from frequent inflows of Chinese and/or northern populations into the Korean Peninsula.  Genetic history of Mongolians  The Mongols are an ethnic group in northern China, Mongolia, parts of Siberia and Western Asia. They are believed to be the descendants of the Xianbei and the proto- Mongols. The former term includes the Mongols proper (also known as the Khalkha Mongols), Buryats, Oirats, the Kalmyk people and the Southern Mongols. The latter comprises the Abaga Mongols, Abaganar, Aohans, Baarins, Gorlos Mongols, Jalaids, Jaruud, Khishigten, Khuuchid, Muumyangan and Onnigud. The Daur people are descendants of the para-Mongolic Khitan people. Mongolians are also related to the Manchurians. = Paternal lineages = The majority of Mongolians belong to the y-DNA Haplogroup C-M217. Haplogroup C-M217 among the Mongols is characterized by very deep total diversity that dates back to the very origin of haplogroup C-M217 (TMRCA 33,900 [95% CI 31,300 <-> 36,500] ybp) and very shallow diversity in each of the frequently observed subclades: C-M504 (TMRCA 2,900 [95% CI 2,200 <-> 3,700] ybp), C-M86 (TMRCA 3,700 [95% CI 3,000 <-> 4,500] ybp), C-M407 (TMRCA 4,400 [95% CI 3,500 <-> 5,200] ybp), and C-F1756 (TMRCA 5,000 [95% CI 4,200 <-> 5,800] ybp). Of these four subclades, C-M407 is phylogenetically extremely divergent from the others, and is more closely related to subclades of C-M217 that are found among present-day Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, and other East and Southeast Asians; however, among Mongols, C-M407 is found most frequently toward the north (among BarghutsBoris A Malyarchuk, Miroslava Derenko, Galina Denisova, Marcin Wo≈∫niak, Urszula Rogalla, Irina Dambueva, and Tomasz Grzybowski, \\"Y chromosome haplotype diversity in Mongolic-speaking populations and gene conversion at the duplicated STR DYS385a,b in haplogroup C3-M407.\\" Journal of Human Genetics (2016) 61, 491‚Äì496; doi:10.1038/jhg.2016.14; published online 25 February 2016. and Buryats as well as the neighboring Khamnigans and Soyots) and toward the west (among Dorbet Kalmyks). Haplogroup O-M175 and Haplogroup N-M231 are found at medium rates among present-day Mongols. The subclades of Haplogroup O-M175 that have been observed among Mongols tend to be similar to those found among Han Chinese, whereas the subclades of Haplogroup N-M231 that have been observed among Mongols tend to be similar to those found among Nenets, Nganasans, Khakasses, and Tuvans (N-B478) on the one hand or those found among Chukchi, Koryaks, and Asian Eskimos on the other (N-B197). However, N-M2118, a subclade which is most often noted for its extremely high frequency among present-day populations of Yakutia, has been observed in 21.4% (6/28) of a sample of Kalmyk Khoshut, and N-B525 is also widely observed among Mongols with low frequency. In addition, some members of a wide variety of other Y-DNA haplogroups have been found among present-day Mongols, including Haplogroup Q-M242, Haplogroup R-M207 (Haplogroup R1b-M478, Haplogroup R1b-M269, Haplogroup R1a-M17, Haplogroup R2a-M124), Haplogroup D-M174, Haplogroup J2a-M410, Haplogroup J1-Page8, Haplogroup G1-M285, and Haplogroup I2a2-M436. = Maternal lineages = The maternal haplogroups are diverse but similar to other northern Asian populations. The most common maternal haplogroups in Mongolians are haplogroup D4, Haplogroup A, and Haplogroup B. West Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups Haplogroup HV, Haplogroup U, Haplogroup K, Haplogroup I, Haplogroup J, represents 14% in western Xingjang Mongolian, 10% in Mongolia, 8.4% in central Inner Mongolian samples, 2% in eastern Xin Barage Zuoqi County samples. Genetic history of Tibetans Modern Tibetan populations are genetically most similar to other modern East Asian populations. They also show more genetic affinity for modern Central Asian than modern Siberian populations. A 2016 study found that the Tibetan gene pool diverged from that of Han Chinese around 15,000 years ago, which can be largely attributed to post-LGM (Last Glacial Maximum) arrivals. Analysis of around 200 contemporary populations showed that Tibetans share ancestry with populations from East Asia (~82%), Central Asia and Siberia (~11%), South Asia (~6%), and western Eurasia and Oceania (~1%). These results support that Tibetans arose from a mixture of multiple ancestral gene pools but that their origins are much more complicated and ancient than previously suspected. = Relationship to other populations = A study in 2010 suggested that the majority of the Tibetan gene pool may have diverged from the Zang around 15,000 years ago. However, there are possibilities of much earlier human inhabitation of Tibet, and these early residents may have contributed to the modern Tibetan gene pool. The date of divergence between Tibetans and Sherpas was estimated to have taken place around 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. = Relationship to archaic hominins = After modern Oceanic populations, modern Tibetan populations show the highest rate of allele sharing with archaic hominins at over 6%. Modern Tibetans show genetic affinities to three archaic populations: Denisovans, Neanderthals, and an unidentified archaic population. In comparison to modern Han populations, modern Tibetans show greater genetic affinity to Denisovans; however, both the Han and Tibetans have similar ratios of genetic affinity to general Neanderthal populations. Modern Tibetans were identified as the modern population that has the most alleles in common with Ust'-Ishim man. = Paternal lineage = The distribution of Haplogroup D-M174 (subclade Haplogroup D-Z27276) is found among nearly all the populations of Central Asia and Northeast Asia south of the Russian border, although generally at a low frequency of 2% or less. A dramatic spike in the frequency of D-M174 occurs as one approaches the Tibetan Plateau. D-M174 is also found at high frequencies among Japanese people, but it fades into low frequencies in Korea and China proper between Japan and Tibet. The claim that the Navajo people and Tibetans are related, while discussed among linguists since Edward Sapir, has not found support in genetic studies. Some light has been shed on their origins, however, by one genetic study in which it was indicated that Tibetan Y-chromosomes had multiple origins, one from Central Asia and the other from East Asia.Su, Bing, et al. (2000)  Genetic history of Turks  The Turkic peoples are a collection of ethno-linguistic groups of Central-, Eastern-, Northern- and Western-Asia as well as parts of Europe and North Africa. They speak related languages belonging to the Turkic language family. Proposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the Transcaspian steppe to Northeastern Asia (Manchuria). According to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near South Siberia and Mongolia as the \\"Inner Asian Homeland\\" of the Turkic ethnicity. Authors Joo-Yup Lee and Shuntu Kuang analyzed 10 years of genetic research on Turkic people and compiled scholarly information about Turkic origins, and said that the early and medieval Turks were a heterogeneous group and that the Turkification of Eurasia was a result of language diffusion, not a migration of homogeneous population. = Paternal lineages = Common Y-DNA haplogroups in Turkic peoples are Haplogroup N-M231 (found with especially high frequency among Turkic peoples living in present-day Russia), Haplogroup C-M217 (especially in Central Asia and, in particular, Kazakhstan), Haplogroup Q-M242 (especially in Southern Siberia and among Turkmens and the Qangly tribe of Kazakhs), and Haplogroup O-M175 (especially among Turkic peoples living in present-day China and the Naiman tribe of Kazakhs). Some groups also have Haplogroup R1b (notably frequent among the Teleuts and Kumandins of Southern Siberia, the Bashkirs of the Southern Ural region of Russia, and the Qypshaq tribe of Kazakhs), Haplogroup R1a (notably frequent among the Kyrgyz, Altaians, and several other Turkic peoples living in present-day Russia), Haplogroup J-M172 (especially frequent among Uyghurs, Uzbeks, Azerbaijanis, and Turkish people), and Haplogroup D-M174 (especially among Yugurs, but also observed regularly with low frequency among Uyghurs, Southern Altaians, Nogais, Kazakhs, and Uzbeks). = Anatolian/European Turks = The modern Turkic groups in Anatolia (Turkey) and Europe have less relation to East-Asian groups than their Central-Asian relatives. Various studies estimate about 15-30% East-Asian lineages in Anatolian/European Turks with the average at 21.7%.  Relationship to other Asian groups  =Central Asians= The genetic evidence suggests that the Turkification of Central Asia was carried out by East Asian dominant minorities migrating out of Mongolia. According to a recent study, the Turkic Central Asian populations, such as Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, and Turkmens share more of their gene pool with various East Asian and Siberian populations than with West Asian or European populations. The study further suggests that both migration and linguistic assimilation helped to spread the Turkic languages in Eurasia. =North Asians= =South Asians= The genetic landscape of South Asia is generally described as a composite of West Eurasian and East Asian exogenous components that mixed with the indigenous South Asian groups (who belong to an ancient East Eurasian lineage) to create modern-day South Asians. Basu et al. (2016) noted that mainland India harbors two East Asian components, in addition to the main components, which are the \\"Ancestral South Indian\\" (ASI) and \\"Ancestral North Indian\\" (ANI) components, which have contributed to the gene pools of modern South Asia, namely Ancestral Austro-Asiatic (AAA), from Southeast Asia or southern China, and Ancestral Tibeto-Burman (ATB), which came directly from East Asia. =Southeast Asians= A 2020 genetic study about Southeast Asian populations in 2020 (Liu et al. 2020), found that mostly all Southeast Asians are closely related to East Asians and have mostly \\"East Asian-related\\" ancestry. Austronesian and Austroasiatic speaking populations of Southeast Asia were found to have mostly East Asian-related ancestry (89% to 96%) and minor Onge- related ancestry (1% to 11%). Additionally they found evidence for ancient gene flow from East Asian-related groups into the Andamanese people. Andamanese (Onge) were found to have about 30% East Asian-related ancestry next to their original Negrito ancestry. Taiwanese indigenous peoples had on average 99% East Asian-related ancestry. Kra-Dai speaking populations had, similar to the Taiwanese indigenous peoples, nearly exclusively East Asian- related ancestry.

His father having ceded the rule of Sharjah to Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi, Sultan found himself dispossessed and married the daughter of Abdulrahman bin Shamsi, a secessionist troublemaker from Al Heera. Buoyed by Khalid's unpopularity and Abdulrahman's force of personality and arms, Sultan deposed Khalid and became Ruler of Sharjah. However, he found the interior of the country dominated by Bedouin tribes and the East coast was increasingly dominated by the former Ruler, Khalid bin Ahmad, leaving Sultan the effective ruler of a cluster of coastal settlements, many of which constantly tried to secede from his rule. He is cited as having presided over a low ebb in the power of the Al Qasimi, formerly a powerful maritime federation.  Accession  Sultan's father, Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi, died while Sultan was still a young boy. Shortly before his death, he agreed that Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi (his senior cousin) should become Ruler. Khalid acceded in 1914. Sultan bin Saqr, on reaching his majority, petitioned Khalid for the restitution of the property and money that he had seized on assuming power, but in vain. Embittered, Sultan left Sharjah in 1921 and settled in Dubai. In 1923, he married the daughter of Abdulrahman bin Muhammad Al Shamsi the headman of Al Heera, a dependency of Sharjah that had been embroiled in open conflict with both the Rulers of Sharjah and Ajman. Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi took this as a challenge and attacked Sultan's father-in-law at his home in Al Heera. Following an intercession by the British Resident Agent, Abdulrahman quit Al Heera and went live in Dubai with Sultan. By now, the people of Sharjah had had enough. Khalid was unpopular and was seen as weak, having lost Ras Al Khaimah and oppressed Heera. His actions towards Sultan, as the son of the former ruler, were widely deprecated and his taxes and levies were resented. On 1 November 1924, Sultan bin Saqr was welcomed into Sharjah and, acting with the support of Abdulrahman and his forces, deposed Khalid in an 11-day conflict.  Rule  Although removed as Ruler of Sharjah, Khalid had considerable influence over Sharjah's eastern dependencies, Dhaid, Dibba and Kalba. On taking control of Sharjah, Sultan bin Saqr removed Khalid's brother Rashid bin Ahmad as wali of Dibba. However, he was restored in 1926 after leading a popular revolt and remained as wali until his death in 1937. In June 1927, following a brief and bloody fight in Sharjah between forces loyal to Khalid bin Ahmad and forces loyal to Sultan bin Saqr, an agreement was reached between Sultan and Khalid to provide for the upkeep of the deposed ruler's family. This ceded the fort at Dhaid and the revenues of the inland oasis town to Khalid bin Ahmad. Dhaid, in 1906, generated some 228 Marie Theresa Dollars annually in water rates, as well as revenue from the sale of dates. Although he had Sultan bin Saqr's agreement, Khalid remained in Umm Al Qawain and sent some of his men to Dhaid to occupy his newly acquired property as the Bedouin who had manned the fort for Sultan were still active in the area. With the support of the Sheikhs of the Bedouin Bani Ka'ab and Na'im tribes, who favoured any scheme which would weaken Sharjah, it was agreed that the ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, Sultan bin Salim Al Qasimi, would possess Dhaid 'on behalf of Khaled bin Ahmad'. This arrangement was not fully supported by Sultan bin Salim himself, who feared antagonising Sultanb bin Saqr and also believed Khalid bin Ahmad would represent an ongoing financial burden with little hope of any return other than conflict. Khalid bin Ahmad finally took full possession of Dhaid in his own right in July 1928.  Abdulrahman Al Shamsi  Sultan's father-in-law was, to say the least, a colourful figure and in October 1925 was accused of the murder of the cousin of the Residency Agent. Although it wasn't doubted that Abdulrahman disliked the man, there was scant proof of his involvement in the murder and the British sent the Political Resident (accompanied by the Bahraini trader, Yousuf Kanoo) to Sharjah to investigate. They concluded that Abdulrahman was responsible. This caused an increasing outcry and outbreak of tension between the Al Bu Shamis and other leaders on the coast. Due to the increase in tensions and consequent instability, the British Political Resident decided to exile Abdulrahman to Aden for four years. Captain Parry of the Triad was sent to Ras Al Khaimah to disembark Abdulrahman, but Sultan bin Salim Al Qasimi, the Ruler, refused to give Abdulrahman up until the British had issued barely veiled threats to bombard the coastal towns, including Al Heerah and Sharjah. On 16 June 1926, Abdulrahman was given up to go into exile but in 1929 he was permitted to return after a sustained outcry led by Sultan bin Saqr and the leaders of the Al Bu Shamis. Abdulrahman was to be a staunch and helpful ally to Sultan, who was seen as weak by many of the uncompromising and warlike chiefs of Bedouin tribes such as the Bani Qitab, who declared war on Sultan but who were allied to Abdulrahman. When war broke out between Sharjah and Ajman in 1933, Abdulrahman brought the Bani Qitab and Manasir to fight on Sharjah's side. This didn't stop the Bani Qitab, who were paramount across much of the interior of the peninsula, in 1936 blocking geologists from Petroleum Concessions from exploring the interior, even though they held permits from Sultan. Eventually Sultan was to petition his predecessor, Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi, to intercede on his behalf with the Bani Qitab ‚Äì Khalid having become a highly influential leader amongst the tribes of the East Coast. However, this was not successful, Sultan remaining in effective control by 1937 of only the Western coastal area of Sharjah. Abdulrahman's powerful personality and position appear to have given him a dominant role in his relationship with Sultan, who came to resent his father-in-law - especially when he declared Al Heera independent of Sharjah. He attempted to have Abdulrahman ostracised by other leaders but to no avail and it was only on Abdulrahman's death that Al Heera was confirmed as a part of the territory of Sharjah.  East Coast  Sultan bin Saqr's 18th century namesake had established Al Qasimi dominance over the east coast, the area known as the Shamaliyah but the Al Qasimi relationship with the dominant tribe of Fujairah, the Sharqiyin, was fractious and the Sharqiyin on a number of occasions moved to secede from Sharjah, but also to encroach on the territory of Kalba. In 1926, strained relations boiled over into open conflict between Kalba and Fujairah. A number of tribal affiliations were brought into the fray and Sharjah, Muscat and Ras Al Khaimah were all involved in what looked to be escalating into a major tribal conflict. The involvement of the Sultan of Muscat led to an agreement agreed by all parties and peace broke out, only to be threatened again in 1927. By 1936, the grant of Trucial Status to Kalba by the British and the establishment of stable rule over Kalba by Khalid bin Ahmad Al Qasimi stabilised the situation.  Sharjah Airport  An air route to connect the British empire was established by Imperial Airways, running from Croydon via Cairo to Cape Town in South Africa and Brisbane in Australia. The agreement to use a base on the Persian coast lapsed in 1932 and a Southern route was subsequently sought. Negotiations with several Trucial Sheikhs resulted in British offers being rejected before, finally, Sultan bin Saqr agreed ‚Äì with reservations ‚Äì to host the airfield. An agreement was made on 22 June 1932 with Sultan bin Saqr, which secured him a monthly rental of 800 Rupees for landing rights and fees and a personal subsidy of 500 Rupees. Concerned that the airfield would result in British interference in Sharjah's internal affairs, he also gained assurances that British shipping would route through Sharjah, providing income for the town's traders. He agreed to build a rest- house for crew and passengers which was fortified against \\"possible but unlikely raids by bedouin\\" according to the 1937 documentary film Air Outpost, which featured Sharjah's airport. Sultan also supplied a number of armed men as guards. The route was originally flown by Handley Page H.P.42s, with two weekly flights landing in Sharjah on Sunday and Wednesday evenings on the outbound flight and Wednesday and Saturday evenings on the return flight. A backup landing strip was established in Kalba in August 1936. By 1938, Sharjah was no longer an overnight stop on the route although the Imperial Airways flying boat service from Sydney to London included an overnight stop in Dubai, following the establishment of Civil Air Agreements with Dubai's ruler. p 171 The outbreak of skirmishing between Dubai and usurpers who had escaped to Al Khan in Sharjah in 1940 threatened the security of Sharjah's airport and led to unusual intervention by the British political agent in a land-based dispute: the British had previously restricted their interests and treaties purely to maritime affairs. The airport was used extensively during World War II by the RAF and a new agreement was made with Sultan to establish an RAF base in Sharjah.  Secession  Sultan's rule was plagued by attempts at secession, not only by Al Heera, but also Kalba, Dibba, Fujairah, Dhaid, Al Khan and Hamriyah. Having lost the effective control of the East coast and the interior, he relied on British interventions in order to retain control even of his diminished coastal holding. In trying to allow access to the interior for geologists exploring for oil under the terms of concessions he had signed, he was forced to ask Khalid bin Ahmad for help in pacifying the tribes of the East Coast and interior, particularly the Bani Qitab, paying Khalid 1500 Rupees for his intercession. Sultan bin Saqr died in 1951. Saqr, his son lost the throne in 1965, but since 1999 the crown prince is Sultan bin Muhammad, his direct grandson again, and also Ahmad, his son was deputy ruler 1990-2020 (his death) and was also UAE justice minister in 1972‚Äì76.https://web.archive.org/web/20200714133002/https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/tributes- paid-to-deputy-ruler-of-sharjah-1.1047026 References Category:Sheikhs of the Emirate of Sharjah Category:House of Al Qasimi Category:History of the United Arab Emirates ","title":"Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi II"},{"id":"58702464","text":"Lutimaribacter marinistellae is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming and motile bacterium from the genus of Lutimaribacter which has been isolated from a starfish from Sanya in China.

NB: The spoken text written by De Andr√© and featured on the original version is omitted from this recording, although the booklet does include it. ‚Äì 3:55 Overview The album features a selection of songs from all stages of De Andr√©'s 40-year career, from his very first studio album to his very last. Westley's orchestral arrangements add a sense of epic, cinematic grandeur to the singer-songwriter's usually quiet, restrained style, generating a unique, unusual mixture of sounds, textures and styles, and bring all of the Genoan artist's creations into new territory. Differences between original studio recordings and new versions All songs are built on De Andr√©'s original vocals, taken from his studio recordings (i.e. studio albums). However, only two songs over ten (\\"Ho visto Nina volare\\" and \\"Rimini\\") are re-orchestrated recordings of the respective album versions. All others have been changed, some subtly, some significantly. The changes are as follows: *\\"Preghiera in gennaio\\" is extended with new orchestral material, by Westley. *\\"Hotel Supramonte\\" is taken at a much slower pace than the original studio version. The single vocal lines are separated from each other and dilated, which enables Westley to build a vast, breathy orchestration on a very broad largo tempo in (in lieu of the original metre of ). *\\"Valzer per un amore\\" has a marked symphonic, Strauss-like feel, rather than the country- sounding original, and incorporates a short excerpt from Dmitri Shostakovich's popular \\"Waltz 2\\", taken from his 1956 Suite for Variety Orchestra. Vinicio Capossela sings a virtual duet with De Andr√© on this track. *\\"Tre madri\\" is slightly slower than the original, and, like \\"Hotel Supramonte\\", it is changed from to . *\\"Laudate Hominem\\" is a completely new recording of the original track from La buona novella; De Andr√© is not featured on this track, which is instead sung by an operatic choir. *\\"Disamistade\\" is relatively faithful to the original studio version, but includes a few orchestral passages newly composed by Westley. *\\"Anime salve\\" is, yet again, much slower, broader and substantially extended than the version on the same-titled 1996 album. Franco Battiato, De Andr√©'s virtual duet partner on this track, enters by singing his opening line \\"Passaggi di tempo...\\" (i.e. \\"Time passages...\\") a few bars after De Andr√© has finished singing it. In the original version, Ivano Fossati, his duet partner at the time, finishes the line himself, while De Andr√© does not ‚Äì the start of Fossati's vocal is overlaid on his. *\\"Le nuvole\\" is another entirely new recording where De Andr√© is not featured at all. It consists of the orchestral piece written by Mauro Pagani, and arranged by Piero Milesi, for the original song from the same-titled 1990 album, without the spoken-word vocals featured in the original (although the poetical lyrics from that recording are retained in the CD booklet). Album title and artwork The title Sogno n¬∞ 1 is a paraphrase of \\"Sogno numero due\\", a track from De Andr√©'s 1973 album Storia di un impiegato (he never actually wrote or recorded a \\"Sogno numero uno\\"). Dori Ghezzi chose it because hearing her late husband's voice over all-new orchestral backgrounds was a dream come true for her.From Dori Ghezzi's liner notes in the CD booklet. The artwork for the album, created by designer Arturo Bertusi for the Chiaroscuro Creative design company in Bologna, is a CG combination of the Genoa port skyline on the upper side, and the Westminster skyline on the lower side, symbolizing an ideal union of De Andr√©'s hometown and London. The back cover features the same design but with the upper/lower positions of the two cities having been exchanged. The inner gatefold of the Digipak CD features a simpler, line drawing version of the same artwork.

Born in New Haven, Connecticut in April 1896, she earned a degree in law from New York University Law School and at the age of 21 became the first woman to be admitted to the Connecticut Bar Association, and then the first women prosecutor for New Haven in 1925. After leaving her job as assistant prosecutor at the New Haven city court in 1937, she aided the state's welfare commissioner on juvenile delinquency issues and supervised a newly formed juvenile court in the early 1940s. She also served as secretary of the Social Protection Committee in the Connecticut War Council during World War II. She had developed a reputation for being able to \\"get things done\\", and the New Haven Restaurant Association asked her to direct a new culinary school, which eventually was named the Culinary Institute of America. The school opened on May 22, 1946 with sixteen students, and she ran it until 1965 by which time it had expanded to have over 300 students. In 1951 she discussed the school with Eleanor Roosevelt on the latter's radio program. Roth died in 1971, at the age of 75. Early life and education Frances Levenstein was born in New Haven, Connecticut in April 1896. Her brother also worked in law, earning a degree from Yale Law School. She went straight from high school to New York University School of Law at the age of 18. To pay for school, she worked at a settlement house in Manhattan, which helped engender a concern for children in crisis; at her father's shoe store in New Haven; and part-time at a law office in New Haven, which she left because her work at the shoe store paid more. After graduating, she was admitted to the Connecticut Bar Association at the age of 21‚Äîthe first women to do so. Career =New Haven prosecutor= She became the first women prosecutor for New Haven, being assistant prosecutor at the New Haven city court from 1925 to 1937. Though she was \\"very capable\\" at her job according to the Hartford Courant, she faced opposition in reappointments to the post as some preferred a man do it. During her time as assistant prosecutor, which was a part-time post, she worked in the domestic relations department, dealing with \\"abused or abandoned wives, delinquent husbands, wayward girls, and troublesome sons\\". She expressed her attitude as prosecutor as: \\"My first duty is to prosecute and obtain punishment of offenders. So I just don't feel anything at all about it. Of course, I am just as human as the next fellow but I refuse to let my feelings get the better of me. If you have some rotten apples on the social tree, the only thing to do is to pick them off.\\" The Hartford Courant described her in 1934 as having \\"a rich good humor, a becoming frankness, natural sincerity and spontaneous wit ... a sturdy physique and an abundance of energy.\\" By that time she had dealt with over 6000 family disputes. Roth wrote articles on ways to improve the court system and advocated for the creation of a domestic relations court. She gave a lecture to the American Bar Association's criminal law section in October 1932 about the value of psychiatrists in examining offenders in courts. In 1933, the lecture was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. =State government= Governor Raymond Baldwin Around the time of her resignation as assistant prosecutor in 1937, there was suggestion that she should run for Connecticut Secretary of State. In 1939 she was assigned to work in the Bureau of Child Welfare by Governor Raymond Baldwin‚Äîwith whom she had legal and political contacts‚Äîto help Robert J. Smith, the welfare commissioner, with juvenile delinquency issues. She produced two reports on that matter. The first, about the \\"duties and responsibilities of the state commissioner of welfare re delinquency\\", described the role of juvenile probation officers in the state, and advocated for an overhaul of the juvenile probation system to match that of Massachusetts and an increase in the juvenile cut-off age to 18 from 16. The second report was on a \\"simplified system of the reporting the cases of juvenile offenders\\" and listed all juvenile probation officers in Connecticut, included a form she had created which was used in 169 towns, and recommended a statewide juvenile court rather than a juvenile judge for each congressional district. The report was given to Baldwin and Connecticut Supreme Court Chief Justice William M. Maltbie in mid-1940. Smith also asked her to advise juvenile court justices with interpretation of legislation and on how to improve their work. In 1939, Roth led 150 women in the old Connecticut Senate chamber rallying for the passage of a juvenile court reform bill; she argued that Connecticut needed a \\"true juvenile court\\". Fiscal issues prevented the bill's passage that year. She advocated for the reform to the Judiciary Committee in the 1941 session, and the bill passed on the last day of it. Though she desired the post, Governor Hurley did not appoint Roth to one of the three juvenile court judge positions created by the law. However, she was assigned by Chief Justice Maltbie to arrange and supervise the new juvenile court. =World War II and private practice= While working in the judicial branch, Roth also became secretary of the Social Protection Committee in the Connecticut War Council during World War II. She identified places where troops should not go and wrote a paper titled \\"Drunkenness in Wartime Connecticut\\" on the increasing alcoholism due to the war; she suggested a commission to find solutions for the issue. To address juvenile delinquency, with issues of girls \\"following soldiers to camp; runaways who got picked up-often in trucks-and transient wayward minors who were hardest to control\\", she started an association of policewoman. Because of the rising amount of sexually transmitted diseases, she helped in the creation of a sex- education program for communities in 1944. That year she also proposed the Connecticut War Council fund a training center for guiding veterans, including psychologists for determining the veterans' work interests. The War Council presented the proposal to the Connecticut Reemployement Commission. Roth's employment by the government ended in 1945. She then worked as a defense attorney, represented Connecticut in the American Arbitration Association, and wrote an article titled \\"Arbitration, a Vital Tool for Lawyers\\". =Culinary Institute of America= Roth had gained a reputation of being able to \\"get things done\\", which had impressed some restaurant owners that she had met through her work in the war. The executive secretary of the New Haven Restaurant Association, Charles Rovetti, asked Roth to direct a new culinary school. After some persuasion she agreed to start the school, then named the New Haven Restaurant Institute but now known as The Culinary Institute of America. Roth contacted the Connecticut commissioner of education Alonzo Grace to get the school accredited and thus qualify for payments under the GI Bill. Roth and Katharine Angell incorporated the school as a non-profit and therefore independent of the New Haven Restaurant Association. Roth picked staff and a board of directors. The school opened on May 22, 1946 with sixteen students, a budget of $12,700, and a ten-week course that included instructions on how to make foods like beef stew and apple pie. Roth aimed to grow the school. A report by the Connecticut State Department of Education from around 1949 said of Roth: \\"Her leadership, excellent contacts and dynamic personality have accomplished in two years, that which other groups or individuals would have required five to ten years to accomplish.\\" In December 1950, she testified to the House Select Committee investigating the education programs under the GI Bill; the Veterans Administration (VA) managing the GI Bill payments had deemed the institute that year as massively overcharging the VA. She described to the committee the founding, running, and finances of the institute and the issues with the VA the school had. To the committee she justified the expenses that had been pronounced improper: for example, the VA complained that there were \\"excessive charges\\" for the food used in culinary training which the students then ate, but she argued that the students needed practice with cooking gourmet food and that the food prepared needed to be eaten by the students so that they could appraise it. She said she felt there was a bias against trade schools in the VA and that \\"we have gone white-collar haywire in this country of ours.\\" Roth also said that \\"I have had boys come with their parents to our school to inspect and be absolutely astonished to find it the way it is pictured in the brochure. They simply have no faith in it until they come and actually see it.\\" The committee members, persuaded that the institute was not engaging in malpractice, asked her for advice on bettering the teaching of veterans in trade schools. She discussed the institute with Eleanor Roosevelt on the latter's radio program in 1951, telling Roosevelt that students almost always had three or four job offers after graduation and that students from 38 states attended the school. According to Roth's family, she also debated politics with Roosevelt. Roth Hall at the institute's Hyde Park campus, which was named after her. On her time at the institute, she wrote: In 1960, Craig Claiborne, writing in The New York Times, said of her that: \\"All of the world's great chefs have been men, but the one individual who has probably done more than any other to give fine cuisine a foothold in the United States is a woman. She is Mrs. Frances Roth, a kind and intelligent gem of a person, with a seemingly inexhaustible capacity for getting her own way.\\" Roth chose to retire in 1964. Jack Rosenthal became co-director in 1965 and succeeded her as director in June 1966. By that time in 1965 the school had 300 students. She consulted for the Office of Economic Opportunity and became the first woman inductee of the society Confr√©rie de la Cha√Æne des R√¥tisseurs towards the end of her life. She died on June 20, 1971, at the age of 75. Personal life She met Charles G. Roth at NYU Law School, and just before Charles left for World War I, they married in May 1917. They had two daughters: Bernice and Norma. Norma became a lawyer and passed the bar in 1944, making them the first mother and daughter to pass the Connecticut Bar. Roth's marriage was troubled; Charles aspired to a career in finance in New York and so was rarely at home. They later divorced. =Politics= Roth was an active Republican, advocating for the re- election of Herbert Hoover in 1932 at Republican meetings in Hartford and Barkhamsted. She supported Alf Landon's election in 1936 while she was chair of the New Haven Republican Women's Club and was against the enactment of Social Security. Campaigning for Dwight Eisenhower, she lauded him as someone \\"we can really depend upon and get behind\\" and was a Republican National Convention delegate in 1952.

Women's association football is a largely amateur sport in Italy, given the greater emphasis of the male competitions. History In February 1933, in Milan, the Feminine Football Group (Gruppo Femminile Calcistico) was formed as the first organized women's football club; the girls played on the pitch wearing petticoats. However, the activity lasted only about 9 months because, after the enthusiasm given by the release of the news on Calcio Illustrato which published an entire page with the photos of the Milanese girls, other girls' teams were set up in different cities. To prevent the \\"phenomenon\\" from taking hold, the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) prevented women from being able to play not only tournaments but above all individual competitions, hijacking female footballers in various athletic sports. In 1946 two teams were formed in Trieste: Triestina and San Giusto. Four years later in Naples, the Italian Football Women's Association (Associazione Italiana Calcio Femminile) was formed, which continued its activities until 1959. However, an official championship was yet to be formed. In 1968 the Italian Women's Football Federation (Federazione Italiana Calcio Femminile, FICF) was born: the Italian championship was played with two groups of five teams and in the final in Pisa the first championship was awarded to A.C.F. Genova, who won against Roma. This situation of stability lasted only two years: indeed, on 31 January 1970, ten clubs decided to abandon the FICF and formed the Italian Federation of Female Football (FFIGC). In 1970 the FFIGC hosted the first unofficial football Women's World Cup, also known as the Martini Rosso Cup. The tournament was organized entirely without the involvement of FIFA or any of the common national associations. Seven teams appeared in the tournament with Boldklubben Femina, representing Denmark, beating Italy 2‚Äì0 in the final to win the title. In 1972 a 45-team qualifying championship was held divided into four groups. The Serie B, the only regional level, was transformed into the national league which was given the name of Interregional Serie A (Serie A Interregionale) in the first 3 years. With an interregional Serie C being inaugurated, in 1983 the foundations were laid for the development of youth categories, constituting the Esordienti championship in 1979 (which in 1982 became the Serie D). However, it was only in 1986 that women's football lost its autonomy and enters the ranks of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC). The national activity was developed as follows: the Serie A with 16 participating teams and single round; the Serie B divided into three groups of 14 teams. The Supercoppa was set up to be played between the winners of the Italian Women's Cup and the Serie A championship. In 1998, the clubs participating in the Serie B were divided into 4 groups of 12 teams with final playoffs to identify the three winners who would enter the Serie A. While previously run by the Lega Nazionale Dilettanti (LND), starting from the 2018‚Äì19 season the Serie A and Serie B championships have been run by the FIGC. League The league system is divided into five tiers: Serie A and Serie B as single divisions, Serie C divided into four groups, and Eccellenza and Promozione divided into further regional groups. = National divisions =  Serie A  Serie A is a tournament that takes place between 12 teams. The team that gets the most points during the season wins the league title and qualifies for the UEFA Women's Champions League. The 2nd place team also earns a place in the UEFA Women's Champions League. Two teams are relegated to the Serie B. Serie A is growing in professionalism as women's football. Many professional women's teams started in the 1970s.  Serie B  The Serie B (formerly Serie A2) is the second division of women's football in Italy. The league is made up of 12 teams competing in a single round. The first two classified are promoted directly to the Serie A, while the last two are relegated directly to the Serie C. The ninth and tenth ranked go through a relegation play-off with the Serie C teams that came out defeated by the promotion playoffs.  Serie C  Starting from the 2018‚Äì19 season, the Serie C became the third division with an interregional national championship consisting of four groups of 12 or 14 teams. The first ranked of each group play in the promotion play-off, in which the two winners are promoted to the Serie B. The two losing teams play a play-off with the ninth and tenth place in Serie B to determine who should participate in the Serie B the following season. = Regional divisions = The remaining structure of the Italian football league is divided into two more levels. The first of each division are promoted to the one above. Both championships are organized by the Lega Nazionale Dilettanti (LND): * Eccellenza * Promozione National team The women's national team has had mixed results as team although they have qualified for FIFA Women's World Cup and UEFA Women's Championship. Italy participated at the inaugural World Cup of 1991 where, after two wins and a loss in the group stage, they qualified for the quarter-finals, where they lost against Norway. After having failed to qualify for the second edition, Italy played in the 1999 edition where they didn't go past the group stages. For the following four editions, between 2003 and 2015, Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup, coming close in 2015 after losing in the final match of qualification to Belgium. In 2019, Italy returned to the World Cup after a 20-year absence.

Sergio became the eighth in the East Pacific for 2018, breaking the old record of seven set in 2015. The twentieth named storm, eleventh hurricane, and ninth major hurricane of the season, Sergio originated from a system that was located over northwestern South America on September 24\\\\. The National Hurricane Center monitored the disturbance for several days as the system organized into a tropical storm on September 29\\\\. Sergio gradually strengthened for the next couple of days as it traveled west-southwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 2\\\\. The storm then turned towards the northwest as it underwent rapid intensification and an eyewall replacement cycle, before peaking as a Category 4 hurricane on October 4, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). The hurricane maintained peak intensity for 12 hours before undergoing a second eyewall replacement and turning towards the southwest. The system then began another period of intensification, achieving a secondary peak with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) on October 6\\\\. The next day, Sergio began a third eyewall replacement cycle, falling below major hurricane strength. At the same time, the system unexpectedly assumed some annular characteristics. Over the next few days, the cyclone curved from the southwest to the northeast, weakening into a tropical storm on October 9\\\\. Sergio made landfall as a tropical storm on October 12 on the Baja California Peninsula, and later in northwestern Mexico as a tropical depression before dissipating early on October 13\\\\. Sergio's approach warranted the issuance of tropical storm watches, and warnings along the western and eastern coasts of Baja California from October 10‚Äì11. The cyclone made landfall in western Baja California Sur and Sonora on October 13 as a tropical storm and tropical depression, respectively, causing over US$2 million1 in damage, over a thousand school closures, and a few hundred evacuations due to severe flooding. Sergio's remnants brought heavy rainfall to Arizona, resulting in the closure of its state fair. Multiple tornadoes also spawned in Texas as a result of the increased moisture. About US$548,000 in damage occurred throughout both states. No injuries or deaths were reported in association with the hurricane or its remnants. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Sergio can be traced to a system that was located over northwestern South America on September 24\\\\. Although uncertain, there is a possibility that Sergio arose from a tropical wave that departed from the west coast of Africa on September 13. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasted on September 25 that a low- pressure area would form a few hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec in about two days. A low-pressure system materialized a few hundred miles south-southeast of Mexico's southern coast around 12:00 UTC on September 26. The NHC continued to track the disturbance for a few more days as the system traveled west-northwest, before it developed into Tropical Storm Sergio on September 29 at 12:00 UTC, while approximately 385 mi (620 km) south of Zihuatanejo, Mexico. Unlike most other tropical cyclones, Sergio did not possess an inner wind core. Instead, the maximum sustained winds were located in a rainband approximately 125 mi (205 km) east of the center. alt=Category 3 Hurricane Sergio acquiring some annular characteristics on October 7 Despite being located within a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, Sergio only gradually intensified over the next couple of days, the system becoming a Category 1 hurricane on October 2 at 00:00 UTC. Meanwhile, the storm tracked just south of west as a mid-level ridge developed to the north. At that point, the storm had developed a well-defined eye surrounded by clouds. The hurricane then began a period of rapid intensification, reaching Category 3 major hurricane status by 18:00 UTC. The wind speed then leveled off for about 18 hours as the system underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. At the same time, the mid-level ridge had weakened, resulting in the storm travelling to the northwest. Sergio then began another period of intensification, becoming the eighth Category 4 hurricane of the season on October 4 at 00:00 UTC, breaking the old record of seven set in 2015. Six hours later, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 942 mbar (27.82 inHg), while located about 825 mi (1325 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. The storm maintained peak intensity for 12 hours before weakening due to another eyewall replacement cycle. As a result, its structure deteriorated, the eye fading and the surrounding cloud tops warming. A faraway mid-latitude ridge caused Sergio to turn towards the southwest from October 5‚Äì6. After bottoming out as a low- end Category 3 hurricane on October 5 at 06:00 UTC, Sergio began to intensify once more, reaching a secondary peak with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) on October 6 at 00:00 UTC. After maintaining its intensity for 18 hours, the hurricane began to weaken around 00:00 UTC on October 7 due to upwelling and a third eyewall replacement cycle. Soon after, Sergio began another turn, rotating from the southwest to the northeast over the next few days due to the influence of a mid-latitude trough. It unexpectedly acquired some annular characteristics early on October 7, the eye having doubled in size while most of the banding features disappeared. The system gradually weakened over the next two days, falling to tropical storm status on October 9 at 18:00 UTC, due to cooling sea surface temperatures. Sergio made landfall near Los Castros, Baja California Sur, around 12:00 UTC on October 12, as a 50 mph (85 km/h) tropical storm. After crossing over the Baja California Peninsula and traversing the Gulf of California, the storm made a second landfall near Guaymas, Sonora, as a tropical depression around 18:00 UTC, before dissipating over northwest Mexico around midnight. Its remnants continued northeastward, causing heavy rainfall and tornadoes in the United States. Preparations and impact =Mexico= alt=Tropical Storm Sergio approaching the Baja California Peninsula on October 11 The Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch on October 10 along the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula from Punta Eugenia to Cabo San Lazaro and along the eastern coast from to San Evaristo. As Sergio rapidly approached the peninsula on the next day, the tropical storm watch on the west coast was upgraded to a tropical storm warning, while the watches on the east coast were upgraded to warnings later in the day. All watches and warnings were discontinued as Sergio moved inland. Civil protection agencies in Baja California, Baja California Sur, and Sonora issued yellow alerts, indicative of moderate danger, in anticipation of severe weather conditions. Several municipalities around the landfall area in Sonora had orange alerts, which signaled high danger. Plan DN-III-E and the Marine Plan were activated in advance for Baja California Sur, allowing the Mexican Army to help with disaster relief efforts and rescue operations. A blue alert, meaning minimal danger, was issued for Sinaloa and emergency shelters were opened due to rainfall and Sergio's proximity. Sergio made landfall in western Baja California Sur and later in Sonora, bringing heavy rains and strong winds to northern Mexico. In Baja California Sur, Sergio's impact was mainly minimal, homes experiencing power outages and roof damage. Multiple roads and schools in Loreto were damaged. In Sonora, almost 400 people had to evacuate to a temporary shelter as a result of flooding. Strong winds up to downed trees, utility poles, and damaged homes and businesses in Guaymas, causing approximately MX$40 million (US$2.12 million) in damage as well as several power outages. Hermosillo experienced street flooding which impeded traffic and overflowed sewers in several areas; multiple power outages also occurred. A concert scheduled to take place in the city was canceled in the interest of public safety. In Punta de Aqua II, over of rain was reported. Mazatl√°n and Plutarco El√≠as Calles reported rainfall totals of and , respectively. The Puerto Pe√±asco Municipality was impacted, causing flood damage to houses in the region. More than 1,000 schools were closed in Chihuahua and classes in 72 municipalities of Sinaloa were suspended. In the Chihuahuan municipality of Nuevo Casas Grandes, heavy rainfall flooded streets and houses. Throughout the state of Michoac√°n, the combined effects from Sergio and nearby Hurricane Rosa destroyed of crops. =United States= High waves from Sergio affected Hawaii and its remnants moved into Arizona, California and Texas, generating heavy rains and spawning multiple tornadoes. Sergio produced waves and rip currents along the shores of Hawaii's Big Island, Maui, Molokai, and Oahu on October 10. As a result, high surf advisories were issued for east-facing shores. These swells gradually relaxed over the next couple of days. No injuries or damage was reported in Hawaii. In Arizona, a Pacific upper-level low and remnant moisture from Sergio led to heavy rainfall; some areas in Phoenix recorded rainfall totals of and ankle- deep flooding. The Arizona State Fair was closed for the first time in \\"recent memory\\" due to flooding. Damage on the fairgrounds and to the surrounding roads was estimated at US$50,000. A portion of Old U.S. Route 80 was closed between Gila Bend and Buckeye after rainfall exceeding per hour caused flooding in the area. Moderate to heavy rainfall in the deserts southeast of Phoenix caused flash flooding, halting traffic on State Route 187 between state routes 87 and 387. Runoff from heavy rainfall in the Maricopa Mountains flowed across State Route 238, resulting in multiple closures from Mobile to Bosque and US$2,000 in damage. Numerous other road closures occurred throughout the Phoenix Metropolitan Area as a result of flash floods, damage in the region totaling approximately US$73,000. Moisture from Sergio's remnants also entered Southern California, producing thunderstorms mainly to the south of Point Conception. Widespread storms caused flash floods throughout the Coachella Valley, with a 12-hour rainfall total of observed at Palm Desert. In nearby Indio, hail up to in diameter was reported. Floodwaters up to deep were reported on a segment of Interstate 10 near Cactus City. Multiple flood-related road closures also occurred near Rimlon and Thousand Palms. The remnants of Sergio moved through Texas from October 12‚Äì13, producing severe thunderstorms that caused US$475,000 in damage throughout the state. About US$15,000 in damage was reported after wind gusts damaged a storage unit between Eureka and Mildred. Wind gusts of caused about US$4,000 in damage to power lines and a carport near Greenwood. Outside of Shiloh, wind gusts destroyed a metal barn and either damaged or destroyed multiple trees, resulting in US$5,000 in damage. Wind gusts between were reported2 in numerous other counties. There were also reports of hail in several counties. Just outside Baxter, hail in diameter fell on several properties, causing US$5,000 in damage. Flash flooding affected the state, resulting in multiple road closures. In Wink, the intersection of State Highway 115 and Wildcat Drive was closed due to flooding. Outside of Midland, State Highway 158 experienced flooding near Interstate 20. At least ten tornadoes spawned in Texas as a result of the increased moisture. An EF2 tornado near Knickerbocker extensively damaged a metal building and either uprooted or snapped many trees, causing US$200,000 in damage. In Brady, an EF0 tornado uprooted one tree, caused another to fall on a home, and generated roof damage, resulting in US$150,000 in damage. Approximately US$25,000 in damage occurred near Sardis when an EF0 tornado damaged a corner of a gymnasium, broke out windows on cars, bent down lightpoles and handicap signs in a parkinglot, and threw a trailer into a nearby field. Two tornadoes occurred near Chat. The first was an EF0 tornado that damaged a few trees as well as shingles and fences at multiple homes, generating US$15,000 in damage. The second was an EF1 tornado that substantially damaged one home, damaged the roof and deck of another, destroyed a shed, and tossed a boat and RV trailer, resulting in about US$50,000 in damage. An EF0 tornado near Brandon caused about US$5,000 in tree damage. At least four more EF0 tornadoes occurred:2 two in Navarro County, one in Freestone County, and one in Panola County.

This principles are crucial to be taken into consideration because assessment is an important aspect of educational process which determines the level of accomplishments of students.  Five principles  There are five general principles of assessment: # practicality # reliability # validity # authenticity # washback = Practicality = This principle refers to the time and cost constraints during the construction and administration of an assessment instrument. Meaning that the test should be economical to provide. The format of the test should be simple to understand. Moreover, solving a test should remain within suitable time. It is generally simple to administer. Its assessment procedure should be particular and time-efficient. = Reliability = The principle of reliability refers to the stability of scores over time and different raters. There are four types of reliability: student-related which can be personal problems, sickness, or fatigue, rater-related which includes bias and subjectivity, test administration-related which is the conditions of test taking process, test-related which is basically related to the nature of a test. = Validity = Validity refers to the tests that measure what it claims to measure. * content validity * criterion validity * construct validity * consequential validity * face validity = Authenticity = The assessment instrument is authentic when it is contextualized, contains natural language and meaningful, relevant, and interesting topic, and replicates real world experiences. = Washback = This principle refers to the consequence of an assessment on teaching and learning within classrooms. Washback can be positive and negative. Positive washback refers to the desired effects of a test, while negative washback refers to the negative consequences of a test.

It is the headquarters of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales (ICAEW). The Hall is one of the richest examples of late Victorian architecture in the City and has been praised for its seamless integration of sculpture. It established the fame of its architect, John Belcher. Chartered Accountants‚Äô Hall was Belcher's first building in a more monumental Baroque Revival style, drawing on Baroque architecture which he had studied while travelling in Europe. Some sources attribute the building as a joint design by Belcher in conjunction with Arthur Beresford Pite, who was a partner in Belcher's practice. The two men were friends and admired each other's work. A pupil of Belcher's at the time claimed that Pite's energy and personality had 'very strongly' influenced Belcher and had left its impression above all on the Chartered Accountants building.RIBA Journal (1914), v21 (3rd series), p. 78, cited in Hanson, Brian, \\"Beresford Pite\\", Architects Journal, 1 May 1991, vol.193, no.18, MBC Architectural Press, p. 32. In ‚ÄòThe Alliance of Sculpture and Architecture‚Äô (1993) the authors begin a discussion of the influence of Pite upon Belcher's new Baroque style for the Hall by stating: . Construction Between 1880 and 1890, ICAEW was based in 3 Copthall Buildings while a location was sought for a permanent headquarters. During a special meeting in 1888, William Deloitte put forward a motion to purchase the site at Moorgate Place on a 999 year lease at a ground rent of ¬£900 per annum. The competition for designs was won by John Belcher, with an estimated cost of ¬£17,250. The ICAEW Council also commissioned Hamo Thornycroft to produce a sculpted frieze at an additional cost of ¬£3,000. Construction was delayed as the original contractors went into receivership, the work being completed by Messrs Coll & Sons. In the event, the terms of the lease were altered to ¬£472 for twenty years increasing to ¬£786 thereafter, in return for part of the site being given up to expand Great Swan Alley. The foundation stone of Chartered Accountants‚Äô Hall was laid in July 1890. Under the stone were placed current issues of The Times and The Accountant, a copy of the Institute‚Äôs Charter and Bye-Laws, a list of members, and examples of the copper and silver (though not gold) coins of the day. The Hall was formally opened in 10 May 1893 by the Institute President, Edwin Waterhouse. It originally provided 19,500 square feet of accommodation. The final cost came to ¬£41,561 3s 0d, including heating, lighting, ground rents and the architect‚Äôs commission. Interior The former library of the hall, now a members' room, includes a balustraded Venetian-style bridge, decorated with lanterns The building has been described as ‚Äúone of the few Victorian buildings in the City with interiors worthy of its ornate facades.‚Äù It features a pilastered entrance hall with coffered ceiling after Alessi‚Äôs Palazzo Cambiaso in Genoa. The substantial library (now the members‚Äô room) has a gallery and balustraded bridge inspired by the Rialto Bridge in Venice. It is believed to be the only example of an indoor bridge in the UK. The staircase originally featured stained glass windows by Henry Holiday, completed in 1898. These were re-installed in 2017, a year ahead of the 125th anniversary of the building‚Äôs opening, and are now positioned in the entrance to the Great Hall. Holiday's original 1897 watercolour designs for the windows are housed in the Prints, Drawings & Paintings collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The council chamber (now the reception room) has a high domed ceiling and elaborate wall-paintings by George Murray to Belcher‚Äôs designs, representing the Triumph of the Law and Science bringing Order to Commerce. Frieze Thornycroft‚Äôs frieze depicts groups of figures representing Arts, Sciences, Crafts, Education, Commerce, Manufacture, Agriculture, Mining, Railways, Shipping, India, the Colonies, and Building. The figure of the architect is based on Belcher and the sculptor on Thornycroft himself. The figure of the solicitor is H. Markby of Markby, Stewart & Co., who acted for ICAEW in its early years. When the Hall was expanded in 1930 the frieze was continued for another 50 feet by J.A. Stevenson on the theme of the history of building. This is represented by British, Italian, Gothic, Byzantine, Roman, Greek, Assyrian, Egyptian and Prehistoric figures. For the Whitfield extension in the 1960s, David McFall completed three final panels. These depict Egyptians and the foundation of accounting, 19th century men as the founding fathers of ICAEW, and four Renaissance figures including Luca Pacioli, the first person to publish a work on double-entry bookkeeping. First extension As ICAEW expanded after the First World War it became necessary to extend the original building. In 1926 the Institute purchased Swan House on the adjoining land. J.J. Joass, a pupil of Belcher‚Äôs, was commissioned to extend the building eastwards and provide an additional 5,000 square feet for meeting rooms and offices. The final cost of the extension came to ¬£35,976 9s. 6d. Second extension In 1957 the Society of Incorporated Accountants was integrated into the national bodies of accountants, boosting the Institute‚Äôs membership by 10,000. William Whitfield was commissioned in 1959 to report on the feasibility of a new building. It was decided to extend the existing building substantially and create a Great Hall to accommodate functions, large meetings and other events. Final designs were accepted in 1964 and the new headquarters was opened by HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in May 1970. Unusually for a space of this size, Whitfield‚Äôs Great Hall is uninterrupted by any supporting columns. Instead the office floors above are supported by exterior concrete piers. The rough plaster relief finish that covers the walls is by Cathy Ward and is known as ‚ÄòElephant Trunking‚Äô as it was first used on the Elephant House at London Zoo. Of the building as a whole, Nikolaus Pevsner noted that: ‚Äùhere is proof, if proof were needed, that the uncompromisingly new can go with the old, if handled by an appreciative and imaginative architect.‚Äù The two extensions - Joass's complementary extension juxtaposed with Whitfield's Brutalist bush- hammered concrete - help contribute to Chartered Accountants' Hall being designated a Grade II* listed building. The extension was awarded a Certificate of Commendation by The Concrete Society in 1971. The total cost of the new building came to almost ¬£2.5 million and added 63,000 square feet of space. The improvements included a new set of offices for the library and a members‚Äô restaurant. It was at this point that the council chamber became the reception room, the old library became the members‚Äô room, and the Oak Hall was divided horizontally into a new council chamber and a set of interview rooms. In 2018, the Great Hall was refurbished with new floors, furniture and wall decoration, and updated conferencing facilities. Ornaments and furnishings ICAEW possesses numerous antique furnishings and works of art gifted by individuals or accountancy bodies, including several given to celebrate the centenary in 1980. The walls of the Hall feature portraits of the ICAEW‚Äôs first presidents, including William Barclay Peat and William Welch Deloitte. The Hall owns a set of silverware by Gerald Benney and paintings by John Piper. A set of three tapestries by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi have been moved from the Great Hall to a new location on the Copthall Avenue stairway, leading down from the ground floor to the members' club. The three highly distinctive pieces, which represent present day and future societies in relation to the role played by ICAEW, were commissioned in 1980 as part of the Institute's centenary celebrations. Titled A Perspective on Innovation, the colourful abstract designs feature modern innovations such as a jet engine, a micro chip and a television. In creating the tapestries, Paolozzi described his aim as being to \\"depict our world of today in a manner using the same bold pictorial style as the Bayeux tapestries in France ‚Äì to record the images of our time for future years in a proven and permanent material.\\" The library‚Äôs rare book collection holds early works on accounting and bookkeeping, including the complete published works of Luca Pacioli, and the only complete copy of the oldest surviving original book on accounting in English (James Peele‚Äôs ‚Äò‚Äô). Facilities In addition to functioning as ICAEW‚Äôs administrative headquarters, Chartered Accountants‚Äô Hall offers business and social facilities to its members and the general public. These include a caf√©, a members‚Äô club, a lending library and a business centre.

Overall, she rates the movie 80%. Ayomide Crit praised the storytelling, production and casting but was of the opinion that the storyline lacked sufficient depth. The critic also held the opinion that the directorial composition was averagely done and finally described the movie as 'just there, nothing spectacular and nothing remarkable'.

As a very young man, Hohendorff in 1679 became a junior member of the Danish legation at the court of Versailles, yet soon leaving the diplomatic service for an officer's commission in the French R√©giment Royal. Returning to Denmark in 1683, Hohendorff became a captain in the Danish Guards; in 1687 also a groom of the privy chamber. In 1689, he went with the Guards battalion in the Danish Auxiliary Corps to Ireland, and later to Flanders. Hohendorff was promoted to major in 1690, the same year he was wounded by a cannonball at the siege of Kinsale.

The memorial was erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1926. It was constructed of quartz monzonite from Stone Mountain, the Georgia landmark and birthplace of the modern Ku Klux Klan. History The 10-ton slab of granite used in Seattle‚Äôs memorial was shipped to Seattle via the Panama Canal from Georgia‚Äôs Stone Mountain by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1926. The President of the UDC Robert E. Lee Chapter #885 and Washington Division at the time, Mrs. May Avery Wilkins, who was originally from Georgia, is credited with establishing the monument. Her father, Col. Avery appears to have been a Commander in Chief of a Georgia county Ku Klux Klan in the late 19th century. =Vandalism and removal = The monument has been vandalized repeatedly. In 2005, \\"the flag insignia, bayonets, and a plaque with Robert E. Lee on it were stolen, but then restored\\". Following the Charleston church shooting of 2015, \\"Fuck White Supremacy\\" was painted on it. On July 5, 2018, \\"several parts of the 10-ton piece of granite [were] smashed, including a portion of the monument's inscription, insignia, and relief of Robert E. Lee.\\" In 2015, a petition was started to have it removed. In 2017, in response to the Charlottesville, Virginia Unite the Right rally, and the increased pace of the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials in other parts of the country, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said, \\"Seattle needs to join with cities and towns across the country who are sending a strong message by taking these archaic symbols down,\\" acknowledging that Lake View is private property outside the city's control. Murray also called for the removal of the Statue of Lenin in Fremont, also on private property, prompting the Seattle City Council to consider debating a symbolic resolution asking for the removal of the two monuments. The memorial shown toppled on July 4, 2020 On March 19, 2018 Heidi Christensen, former and last acting President Of the Seattle Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the Veterans for Peace Seattle Chapter, and the NW Museum of Legends and Lore, spoke to Seattle City Council to request removal of the monument in Lakeview Cemetery. Christensen stated during her comments, \\"It is high time we retire these relics to private property. While I realize the Lakeview Cemetery is private property, it becomes a symbol for misguided minds.\\" It is on the Make It Right Project's 2018 list of the 10 Confederate monuments it most wants removed, noting that \\"It is located near 14 Confederate graves but there are no bodies below it, which means it is not a grave marker, but a propagandistic piece of the Lost Cause effort.\\" In October 2018, the Project put up a billboard in Seattle, saying: \\"Hey Seattle, there's a Confederate Memorial in your backyard\\". During the 2020 George Floyd protests, demonstrators demanded the removal of the monument. The monument was toppled by \\"a group of local activists supportive of racial justice and the Black Lives Matter movement,\\" apparently on July 3, 2020. In the process, the lower ends of both formerly vertical columns were broken in multiple places. The activists responsible wrote in a statement to the South Seattle Emerald that, \\"this action is for everyone, living or dead, who has been stolen, murdered, enslaved, raped, tortured, brutalized, terrorized, displaced, incarcerated, colonized, exploited, or separated from land, family, and culture by white supremacy. May the memory of those who have gone home be a blessing to us all, and may their descendants know the peace of true and everlasting justice.\\" The wreckage was discovered by visitors to the cemetery on July 4. Lake View Cemetery quietly removed the rubble of the monument by early September, 2020. There are no plans to restore or replace the monument, according to a statement given by the cemetery to the Capitol Hill Seattle community blog.

Hesham Ali Ashmawy Mos'ad Ibrahim (; 1978 ‚Äì March 4, 2020) was a convicted terrorist who previously was an Egyptian Army officer, suspected by the government of having orchestrated and been involved in a number of terrorist attacks on security targets and state institutions, including the 2014 Farafra ambush and the 2015 assassination of Prosecutor general Hisham Barakat. Ashmawy joined the military in 1996 and eventually became an officer in the Thunderbolt unit. He showed increasing signs of radicalization over the years, which was further aggravated by his father's death in 2010. Accusations of spreading extremist thought and of incitement against the Egyptian Armed Forces led to his eventual dismissal from the military in 2011 under circumstances that remain unclear. He embraced al-Qaeda and went on to join Ansar Bait al-Maqdis in 2012, but eventually defected from the group in 2015, following its declaration of allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. He formed instead his own network, al-Mourabitoun, which based itself in Libya and remained loyal to al-Qaeda. He became one of Egypt's most wanted militants, before being arrested on 8 October 2018, during a counter- insurgency operation by the Libyan National Army in Derna. On 28 May 2019, Ashmawy was handed over to the Egyptian authorities. He was executed on 4 March 2020.  Early life and military career  Ashmawy was born in 1978. His father, Ali Ashmawy, was a French language teacher, and his mother, Ghalia Ali Abdelmegid, worked in a school. Little information exists about his life prior to joining the Egyptian Armed Forces, though he was known by family and friends to be an association football enthusiast. In 2003, Lieutenant Ashmawy married Nesreen Sayed Ali, a former senior year student in Abdelmegid's school who became a teaching assistant at Ain Shams University. They had two sons and lived in a building that was built by his father in the 10th District of Nasr City, Cairo. He entered the Egyptian Military Academy in 1996, from which he graduated in 2000. He served in the Egyptian Army, initially as a regular infantryman and later as a special forces officer in the Thunderbolt unit. He trained in camouflage and combat readiness in challenging terrain. Ashmawy was deployed to the Sinai Peninsula for 10 years, during which the 2005 Sharm el- Sheikh and 2006 Dahab bombings took place.  Radicalization and dismissal  Ashmawy started showing signs of extremism in 2000, when he argued with a military-assigned preacher who accidentally misread Quranic verses during a sermon. He ended up being placed under Military Intelligence surveillance as a result of the incident. Around that time, he was also distributing Salafist literature to his colleagues. One of them told Reuters that Ashmawy used to wake his fellow conscripts at dawn and organize Fajr prayers. He also encouraged them \\"not to accept orders without being convinced of them.\\" Nesreen later described the death of Ashmawy's father in 2010 as turning point in her husband's life, after which he became depressed and started reading the works of Sunni theologian Ibn Taymiyyah. He prayed more frequently and visited mosques during leaves. He was interrogated for the first time in 2006, a year in which a close friend of his may have been tortured and killed in state custody. Ashmawy was accused during the investigation of holding radical and inciting views aimed at state institutions. He severed ties with most of his army and SSI colleagues following the death of his friend, according to Ashmawy's nephew. He was tried in 2007 for continued incitement, and was reassigned to an administrative post in the Popular Defense Forces branch of the Egyptian military. The exact dates and circumstances under which Ashmawy left the military are conflicting. A military court hearing in 2011 decided that he should be formally dismissed from the Armed Forces.  Militancy  Ashmawy regularly visited the al-Anwar al-Muhamadiyya Mosque in Cairo's Matareya district between 2010 and 2012. Meetings between him and \\"extremist elements\\" became frequent after he left the military, according to an October 2015 episode about Ashmawy on Death Making, an Al Arabiya program. During that time, he started embracing Islamic militancy as an ideology, particularly the al-Qaeda brand. Ashmawy managed to form a militant cell with four other suspended officers following his 2011 dismissal, and later joined Ansar Bait al-Maqdis (ABM) in 2012 and gradually rose in the group's ranks. The Ministry of Interior also traced down a trip that he made to Turkey on 27 April 2013, and then later across the border into Syria, where he is suspected by authorities to have fought alongside al-Nusra Front. Ashmawy's name appeared in the media for the first time in September 2013, as one of the prime suspects in the attempted assassination of interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim Moustafa, the other suspects being Emad Abdel Hamid and suicide bomber Waleed Badr. Security forces raided his house and the gym he frequented later that same year. They found a large amount of combat training equipment in his residence. His wife later told the prosecution that she hadn't heard from him since the assassination attempt. Egyptian authorities have linked his name with several militant cells and operations throughout the following year, including the Arab Sharkas case and the 2014 Farafra ambush, which he had personally executed and previously planned while based in Ansar al-Sharia camps in Libya. Ashmawy was assigned the training of ABM recruits in 2014, and commanded the organization's cells in the Egyptian mainland. He fell out with ABM that same year, however, when it declared allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and became Wilayat Sinai. ABM, both in Sinai and in the mainland, had consequently split between members loyal to ISIL and some others linked to al-Qaeda. Ashmawy's mainland operations were gradually taken over by Wilayat Sinai commander Ashraf al-Gharably. = Al-Mourabitoun = His name resurfaced in the media as a suspect in the assassination of Prosecutor General Hisham Barakat in July 2015. He announced in a video that same month the formation of a network named al-Mourabitoun which would remain loyal to al-Qaeda rather than ISIL, to which the latter responded later on by referring to Ashmawy as an \\"apostate\\" and issuing a bounty on his life. Ashmawy's al- Mourabitoun based itself in Libya and developed close ties with the local Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna. During the same video announcement, he encouraged Muslims to wage global jihad and denounced Egypt's government and its president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Ashmawy's tactics differed from those of ISIL. The latter would often employ suicide bombing as a method, while the former favored car bombings and did not claim responsibility for his attacks. ISIL also tends to focus on territorial expansion while Ashmawy emphasized guerrilla warfare. Zack Gold, an analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses, described him as \\"a boogeyman for the Egyptian army.\\" Ashmawy released a second statement in March 2016 in the form of an audio communique accompanied by image slides that included a photo of him in military uniform and a panorama of Jerusalem with the words \\"O Aqsa, we are coming\\" appearing on the screen. In the message, Ashmawy called on Egyptian ulama and clerics to rally Muslim youth and encourage them \\"to expel the invaders from the abode of Islam and wage jihad against the criminal el-Sisi, his soldiers, and supporters.\\" Ashmawy gave himself the nom de guerre \\"Abu Omar al-Mujhajir\\", and became associated with other militant groups like Jund al-Islam and Ansar al-Islam. The latter, which he was suspected of leading, claimed responsibility for the Bahariya Oasis attack in October 2017 that killed between 16 and 54 security personnel. His deputy, Emad Abdel Hamid, was killed in a retaliatory airstrike in Egypt's Western Desert later that month. Ashmawy, under the nickname \\"Abu Mohannad\\", was sentenced to death in absentia by a military court on 27 December 2017, along with ten other defendants, for various terrorism-related charges as part of a case called Ansar Bait al-Maqdis 3 by local media. When he was arrested the following year, Egyptian media credited him with 17 attacks, including the Barakat assassination, the 2015 Italian Consulate bombing, the Minya bus attack and the Bahariya attack, among others. \\"Every major attack, he either has been behind it or has been blamed for it,\\" according to Gold. He became one of Egypt's most wanted militants prior to his arrest.  Arrest and death  On 8 October 2018, Ahmed al-Mismari, spokesman of the Libyan National Army (LNA), announced the capturing of Ashmawy during a surprise operation by a unit of the 106th Mujahfal Brigade in the mountainous al-Maghar district of Derna. Other militants were also captured, as well as the family of Omar Sorour, al-Mourabitoun's mufti who was killed earlier in June. They were later taken to a barracks in the port city. Nasser Ahmed al- Najdi, commander of the LNA's Battalion 169, told Asharq Al-Awsat that the operation was the result of intelligence sharing between Egypt's government and the LNA under the command of General Khalifa Haftar, months after a tunnel network was uncovered in Derna during a battle between LNA forces and the Shura Council of Mujahideen for control of the city. The LNA, which fights for the eastern government in the Libyan Civil War, believed that Ashmawy was using that network to move around between cities in the region. According to Najdi, \\"not a single bullet was fired\\" during the \\"successful\\" operation, which was carried out moments after Ashmawy was spotted trying to leave al- Maghar. The Libyan authorities said in their statement that Ashmawy would be extradited to Egypt following investigations. The LNA also released video footage from the raid's aftermath showing Ashmawy being escorted to an armored vehicle, as well as photos of his bloodied face. An earlier statement added that he was wearing an explosive belt that failed to detonate when the troops closed in on him. Different teams of Egyptian investigators began arriving in Libya later that day to jointly interrogate Ashmawy with the Libyan authorities. Mismari announced on 1 November that Ashmawy was being tried by a military court in eastern Libya, along with over 200 defendants. He added that Ashmawy took part in the fighting against the LNA in Derna and orchestrated attacks and assassinations of several Libyan officers. On 28 May 2019, Ashmawy was extradited by the Libyan national army to Egyptian authorities. On March 4, 2020, Ashmawy's death sentence was carried out.

The small settlement of Weston Mill also lay near by and the halt was opened as part of Plymouth's suburban network development, together with other halts such as the nearby Camels Head Halt, by the London and South Western Railway in 1906, closing in 1921 or Sunday 4 May 1942. It was located on the outskirts of the city not far from the Great Western Railway main line's Weston Mill Bridge.  Infrastructure The Plymouth Devonport and South Western Junction Railway in 1892 As stated the halt, with the entrance on Bridewell Road, was named after a well known local mill where housing developments had taken place and although it officially opened on 1 November 1906 it may have had services from Wednesday 26 September when suburban service was launched. Some disagreement exists over its closure date that is variously recorded as being from the 27 June 1921, 14 September 1921 or even Sunday 4 May 1942. Like Camels Head Halt, Weston Mill was probably built as two short wooden platforms of a single carriage length, with fencing and ramps with a shelter on a double track section of line. The halt was located in a cutting, now infilled. On the route west St Budeaux Victoria Road was the next station and was only a quarter of a mile distant, and Camels Head Halt stood on the line to the east of the halt, barely a quarter of a mile away.  History  Weston Mill was held by Weston Peverel in the Parish of Pennycross and was one of the oldest mill in the Plymouth area with a deed of Geoffrey de Weston. The halt officially opened on 1 November 1906 although services may have operated as early as 30 September 1906 as the result of a complaint by the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway to the London and South Western Railway that month that while they had constructed the halt, the LSWR had not provided any service, with a subsequent report that services commenced before the official opening date. Weston MIll Halt was one of a number of new halts that were constructed to allow a suburban service to be operated between Plymouth Friary and St Budeaux for Saltash station in response to competition from tram lines. Weston Mill Halt always suffered from a severe lack of patronage and as stated closed in either 1921 or 1942, the former being more likely. The trains on the line were third class only and no Sunday service was provided. The wooden platforms posed a fire threat to the local houses and if the closure was in 1942 rather than 1921 then this would have been a part of the reason. The site today Nothing remains of the old mill, quay, station, etc. and most of the old line's cuttings, etc. have been infilled or removed and built over.

They have been a regular and popular feature of Christmas in London. The lights were originally installed in response to nearby Regent Street, which had featured Christmas lights since 1954. The lights were paid for by shop owners and the local council, and were installed in order to give a sense of occasion to shoppers that could not be found anywhere else. The tradition fell out of favour by the early 1970s because of the economic climate, and no lights were featured for some years. It returned in the 1980s following campaigning from local traders. Since 2010, management of the lights has been undertaken by Field and Lawn, a marquee hire company who also install the Regent Street lights. Around 750,000 bulbs are used annually. Current practice involves a celebrity turning the lights on in mid- to late-November, and the lights remain until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The position of turning the lights on can be considered an aspiration, and an indication that a particular celebrity is very popular. The festivities were postponed in 1963 because of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In 2015, the lights were switched on earlier, on Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic.

He served in the missions in India since arriving there in the mid-1920s and dedicated his apostolate to tending to children suffering from malnutrition and fostering interreligious dialogue and tolerance. He also dedicated himself to preserving the environmental protection of local communities in waste- ridden areas and travelled to various communities to bring forth the Gospel message to all people. The process for the late priest's beatification launched in the Krishnagar diocese in the late 1990s and he became titled as a Servant of God; he was later titled as Venerable in 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that Convertini had practiced heroic virtue throughout his life. Life Francesco Convertini was born in Marinelli near Cisternino in the Brindisi province on 29 August 1898 as the second of two children to a poor family: His parents were Sante Convertini (who died when he was three months old) and Caterina (who died when he was eleven). His mother provided for his religious upbringing in his childhood. He and his elder brother Samuele (who was thirteen when their mother died) were orphaned and sent to the friars to be paired with foster parents; the couple Vito and Anna Petruzzi from Fasano adopted them and treated the two as their own, so that the two would refer to them as \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\" due to the connection the four formed with each other. His brother emigrated to the United States of America around 1918. He served in the Italian armed forces in World War I from January 1917, after being conscripted to the 124th Chieti Regiment. He served with on the frontlines in Trento from May 1917; on 23 December he was wounded and captured by the Austrian forces and held as a prisoner of war at a camp in Poland for the next eleven months. He was freed upon the war's conclusion but after returning to his homeland on 15 November 1918 suffered from severe meningitis therefore forcing him to recover in isolation in the hospital in Cuneo; his poor health made it worse since he looked skeletal upon his release. It was after he recovered that he decided to begin the next stage of his life and so decided to join the Guardia di Finanza around 1920. But at the same time he met a girl from his town that he fell in love with and with whom he planned to be married to. He followed his captain to Trieste and Pola before going to Turin where he attended confession in the Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians; this event proved to change his life since he confessed to Father Angelo Amadei who became his spiritual director and put him in direct contact with the religious congregation known as the Salesians of Don Bosco. But this newfound call to enter the priesthood tore him since he was divided between accepting God's call and his love for his girlfriend. He settled on the priesthood and on 6 December 1923 commenced his ecclesial studies at the Salesian mission institute in Ivrea. He received his mission crucifix from the Rector Major Filippo Rinaldi himself. It was following his release from imprisonment that he entered the Salesians of Don Bosco and was sent to India to serve in their missions there. Convertini left for India from the port in Genova on 7 December 1927 and arrived in Bombay on 26 December before taking a train to Calcutta. Convertini commenced his novitiate period in Schillong under the direction of the bishop Stefano Ferrando and was also a disciple of both Servant of God Costantino Vendrame and Archbishop Louis Mathias (he passed his theological and philosophical studies despite some difficulties). He received his ordination to the priesthood on 29 June 1935 from Bishop Ferrando. It was not long before Convertini gained fame among the people for his unconditional and unbiased services to all people; he also mastered the Bengali language in order to better communicate with the people. Convertini would travel to various villages on bike or on foot or even on horseback with his backpack in order to go around evangelizing and aiding people (covering miles in order to visit far-reaching villages). He was also considered one of the few missionaries who could enter into Hindi or Muslim homes due to the strong rapport he fostered with people of other religions. This enabled him to create an air of interreligious dialogue and tolerance. His superiors forced him twice in 1952 and 1974 to return to his homeland to recover due to Convertini being known for his constant workload. Convertini died in 1976 in Krishnagar and his remains were interred in the garden adjacent to the Krishnagar cathedral. Beatification process The attention on Francesco Convertini was rekindled by the publication of a book by the Salesian Nicola Palmisano. The beatification process launched in the Krishnagar diocese on 12 December 1997 in a diocesan investigation that was later concluded there on 20 June 2005. The formal introduction to the cause came on 27 July 1998 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause) decree and titling Convertini as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. later validated the diocesan process on 19 June 2006 after the cause was transferred to Rome while the department received the official Positio dossier in 2009 for evaluation. Nine theologians voiced their confirmation for the cause at their meeting held on 11 November 2015 while the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members also issued an affirmative vote to the cause on 10 January 2017. Convertini became titled as Venerable on 20 January 2017 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged that Convertini had led a life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for the cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni.

The product line consists of four models (Portal, Portal Plus, Portal Mini, and Portal TV) that provide video chat via Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, augmented by a camera that can automatically zoom and track people's movements. The devices are integrated with Amazon's voice-controlled intelligent personal assistant service Alexa. Facebook uses some types of data collected from Portal devices for targeted advertising. Reviewers rated the Portal line's video and audio handling capabilities positively, but criticized Facebook's privacy practices for data captured by Portal devices.  History  On October 8, 2018, Facebook Inc. announced the sale and shipment of the Portal and the Portal Plus. The second generation of Portal devices was announced on September 18, 2019; the second- generation Portal and Portal Mini were released on October 15, while Portal TV was released on November 5.  Privacy  According to Facebook, the Portal devices only record audio after the user speaks the \\"Hey Portal\\" command, and only record video during video calling sessions. Each Portal device also includes a cover that can be slid over the camera when not in use. During the product announcement, Facebook initially claimed that data obtained from Portal devices would not be used for targeted advertising. One week after the announcement, Facebook changed its position and stated that \\"usage data such as length of calls, frequency of calls\\" and \\"general usage data, such as aggregate usage of apps, etc., may also feed into the information that we use to serve ads\\". The company later clarified that it analyzes the metadata, not the content, of video calls made through Portal devices.  Reception  =Critical reception=  First generation  Dan Seifert of The Verge found the video and audio quality of Portal's video calling feature via Facebook Messenger to be better than that of competing devices and videotelephony services, but said that \\"Outside of video calling, the Portal‚Äôs functionality is rather limited.\\" In light of the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal, he expressed concerns that the product is \\"always-watching and always-listening\\". Megan Wollerton of CNET praised the device's autotracking wide-angle cameras, which allow the subject to remain centered in the device's field of view. Wollerton also had reservations regarding Facebook's privacy policy in relation to Portal's video calls and wrote, \\"a spokesperson told us that Facebook will, in fact, track information about calls made via Portal to expand on the user profiles it uses to inform ads that show up elsewhere.\\" In a PC Magazine review, Sascha Segan said, \\"From a purely technical standpoint, this is by far the best video calling appliance we've seen\\", and believed that Portal would be a good complement for telecommuters if it gains integration with Workplace by Facebook, a feature that is not yet released. However, Segan considered Portal a \\"horror\\" from \\"a policy and privacy perspective\\" because of the \\"massive abuses of data on Facebook's consumer platform\\". Writing for Tom's Guide, Mike Prospero and Monica Chin criticized the \\"large and obtrusive\\" size of the display, characterizing it as \\"dystopian\\" and \\"more at home in a Black Mirror episode than in my living room or kitchen\\". The reviewers echoed \\"Ongoing privacy concerns\\", but presented a favorable impression of Portal's automatic panning and audio quality.  Second generation  In Engadget, Nicole Lee complimented the second-generation Portal's subdued appearance and ability to be used in both portrait and landscape orientations. Adrienne So of Wired highlighted Portal's video tracking and augmented reality features, but denounced Facebook's inclination to \\"default to sharing more, not less\\". Segan's review of the Portal TV in PC Magazine contrasted the device's competitive video calling capabilities with its \\"thin\\" support for streaming media services, and criticized Facebook's data security record. In a negative CNET review, Wollerton stated that the Portal TV is \\"a solidly performing, decently priced device that just isn't suited for anyone because of the privacy concerns and increasingly alarming issues\\" affecting Facebook. =Amazon reviews= On January 17, 2019, The New York Times columnist Kevin Roose posted on Twitter that Facebook Portal's Amazon product listing contained five-star reviews that appeared to have been written by Facebook employees, including one who claimed to have \\"historically not been a big Facebook or other social media user\\" before purchasing Portal. These reviews were written in violation of Amazon's community guidelines, which forbid \\"creating, modifying, or posting content regarding your (or your relative‚Äôs, close friend‚Äôs, business associate‚Äôs, or employer‚Äôs) products or services\\". In response, Facebook's augmented and virtual-reality vice president Andrew Bosworth stated that the reviews were \\"neither coordinated nor directed from the company\\" and indicated that Facebook would instruct the employees to remove them.

The parish is part of Ryedale and is located north of Kirkbymoorside, west of Pickering and north east from York. The first church on the site was a monastery founded in 654, though the present church dates from the latter part of the 11th century. Lastingham has been an important part of Christian heritage and culture in Northern England and as such, has been a place of pilgrimage, especially for its rare crypt, which is said to be unique architecturally for England, and possibly, the world. History The Venerable Bede described how in 654, monks established a wooden monastery at Lastingeau, which in Bede's time (730) meant the abode of L√¶ÃÉsta's people. The land for the monastery was procured form the King of Deira and the monks established their house in \\"a fold of the Yorkshire Moors\\". St Cedd was the first abbott and he died of the plague at Lastingham in 664. At first he was buried in the open air, but the monks eventually built a church around him. This church has no substantial structures left; it is thought that the church was destroyed during the various raids in the area over the next 400 years, particularly by Danish invaders. When Cedd died, his brother St Chad, took over as abbot and running of the monastery, but not long afterwards, he moved to Lichfield. Eventually, the relics and remnants of St Cedd's presence at Lastingham were removed and kept with those of his brother in Lichfield. Some of their bones are now entombed in Birmingham's Catholic Cathedral though St Cedd is believed to be mostly buried at Lastingham. The monastery is believed to have been destroyed in 870, but William the Conqueror gave permission for a new church to be built on the site in 1078, when a cohort of Benedictine monks from Whitby, set up the new church under Stephen. However, they only stayed for ten years before moving on to York; it was reasoned later that the remoteness of the abbey and the outlaw nature of the area forced them to relocate. The revival of the church has therefore been confined to a clear decade and the Romanesque architecture is prominent in the reconstructed church. Some have pointed out the rarity in being able to see a start and end date in the building of the church. During the 13th century, arcades, bays and aisle in the north and south parts of the church were added. In the following century, the tower was erected and it was left for five centuries with little further work until 1879, when it was renovated by John Loughborough Pearson with the porch being rebuilt and the whole church being re-roofed. This has led to a mix of architectural styles; the walls of the aisles are Perpendicular, but the nave (and indeed, most of the foundations and crypt) are Norman. Glynne was quite critical of the restoration, but Pevsner wrote favourably about it describing Pearson's efforts as \\"remarkably sympathetic\\". Stone altars in the church have been dated back to Roman times with current thinking being that they were re-worked during the Anglo-Saxon period. Lastingham church crypt The crypt underneath St Mary's, has walls that are thick. It is reputed to be the only crypt in England that has a nave, apse and side aisles. The crypt also lays claim to be the oldest Norman crypt in the world and additionally the only one with a nave, aisles and an apsidal chancel. The crypt runs underneath the whole footprint of the church above and is furnished with one square shaft which is indented with a piscina. The crypt is supported by four pillars believed to be of pre-conquest in origin and historians estimate that the crypt has not been altered since the time of William the Conqueror. The crypt is accessed by a staircase descending from nave. During the 18th century, cock-fighting was said to have taken place in the crypt, with or without the knowledge of the clergy and churchwarden. The architecture of the church in conjunction with its history, means that it regularly features on the best of lists for Anglican churches in England. Pevsner described the crypt as \\"unforgettable\\"; John Betjeman concurred describing St Mary's as \\"one of the most moving places in England\\". Simon Jenkins is equally effusive in his book, England's Thousand Best Churches, awarding the church four stars out of a possible five and stating that while \\"most churches are a challenge to the faithful, Lastingham is a challenge to the faithless.\\" Jenkins notes the rarity of the crypt but also points out that the church lacks monuments and historical artefacts; The parish and benefice The church has been the parish church for Lastingham since at least 1228, although the church was given to St Mary's in York until 1299 and its first vicar is not listed until 1314. The benefice of Lastingham includes four parishes with five churches; Christ Church Appleton-le-Moors, St Gregory Cropton, St Chad Hutton-le-Hole,Actually a Chapel of Ease to St Mary's at Lastingham.

It is based in Cape Town, South Africa, is an observer at the International Labour Organisation and UNESCO and is a member of SOLIDAR. History The idea to form an international federation of educational associations for workers was conceived during World War II, at the annual conference of the United Kingdom Workers' Educational Association. In 1945 a conference for members of workers' educational organisations from a number of countries was held in London, where it was resolved to create an international coalition to support collaboration between organisations. In October 1947 the International Federation of Workers' Educational Associations (IFWEA) was officially launched at a conference in London where a formal constitution was adopted. Worker representatives from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden attended, while observers from Germany, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and the United States of America were present. A President and Secretary General were elected, and an Executive Committee was appointed with regional representation. Representation is now regularly modified to reflect the federation's membership. Over the past 71 years membership of IFWEA has increased. , IFWEA has affiliates in more than 30 countries including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Nepal, New Zealand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Philippines, India, Cambodia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Iceland, Finland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Belgium, Bolivia, Peru and the United States of America. IFWEA helps new organisations, particularly in developing countries, and provides a global space for worker educators to share resources and advance the role of trade unions and community struggles in the transformation of society. An important role is to facilitate information exchanges between members. Purpose The purpose of IFWEA is to ‚Äúadvance the education of the public with respect to the democratic labour movement; and to promote the carrying out of free and voluntary educational work, according to the principles of solidarity and cooperation, justice and equality, and democracy and freedom‚Äù. Governance The highest decision making assembly in IFWEA is the quadrennial International General Conference. The General Secretary, President and Executive Committee are elected at this conference. The 22nd IFWEA General Conference was held in Lima, Peru in 2015. The role of the IFWEA Secretariat is to stimulate the development of a democratic workers‚Äô education movement, by providing contact between member organisations, assisting with the development of partnerships, and promoting best practice in educational design and delivery through the provision of education resources, web communication and learning events such as workshops, seminars and conferences. The IFWEA Secretariat was registered in Cape Town, South Africa in 2009, after the election of IFWEA General Secretary Sahra Ryklief in December 2007. Previously it had been registered in the UK with the Secretariat in Manchester, and prior to that, it was hosted by the AOF Norway, with the Secretariat in Oslo. Archival records of IFWEA 1945 to 1986 are held at the Trades Union Congress (TUC) Library Collections and University Archives at London Metropolitan University, reference code GB 1924 IFWEA. Current records are held at the Institute of The Hague.

He married Helena Johanna Augusta Munnik on 17 March 1871. He died in Cape Town on 17 August 1916. He studied theology at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands up to 1866, when he graduated. Influences picked up in the Netherlands The denomination under which he studied was Dutch Reformed. He had become aware of different ways of thinking (free thinking). This was expressed to him by Prof. J.H. Scholten. Upon his return to South Africa in 1866, the Dutch Reformed Church had a panel of theological experts that interviewed graduates before admitting them to the church (called Colloquium Doctum (Latin). Due to Faure‚Äôs Dutch influence he was not admitted as pastor. The Colloquium Doctum was put in place, as two theological contemporaries of him, Burgers, T.F. from Hanover (1862) and Kotze, J.J. from Darling (1864) was suspended as they differed from the church prescribed theory. Founding of the Unitarian Church In 1867, Faure founded the Unitarian Church. It was first called the Free Protestant Church.

Inspired by the Batla House encounter case that took place on 19 September 2008, the film stars John Abraham. His character, Sanjay Kumar, is inspired by Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, the police officer who played a crucial role in the encounter. The story showcases the encounter and in its aftermath, Sanjay's struggle to catch the fugitives and prove the encounter wasn't a fake one, while dealing with nationwide hatred and posttraumatic stress disorder. The film was theatrically released in India on 15 August 2019 during Independence Day weekend. It became commercially successful at the box office.  Plot  ACP Sanjay Kumar (John Abraham) is informed that his team have cornered 5 university students in L-18, Batla House, who might have been involved in the 13 September 2008 Delhi bombings, the responsibility for which was claimed by the terrorist organisation \\"Indian Mujahideen\\" (IM). Sanjay orders not to engage until he arrives, but a restless K.K. Verma (Ravi Kishan) proceeds with some officers. Sanjay arrives and upon hearing the gunshots, decides to engage. The building is cleared, and K.K. is found shot down. Sanjay enters the room and there's more shooting, as a result of which 2 students end up dead, 2 escape and 1 is arrested alive. Sanjay now starts facing the heat from media and politicians who start billing the encounter as a fake one. They're joined by the whole nation in condemning the Delhi Police and everyone starts demanding justice for the students who were supposedly killed to account for the bombings. Sanjay's wife Nandita Kumar (Mrunal Thakur), a news anchor, is however unwilling to accept this and decides to stay with Sanjay, who soon becomes diagnosed with Posttraumatic stress disorder, frequently hallucinating about getting shot by the terrorists. Nandita somehow stops him whenever he becomes suicidal. Sanjay now starts looking for the 2 terrorists that escaped, and finds one of them to hiding in Nizampur. Sanjay is informed by his senior that he would be awarded for the encounter and that he must celebrate. Realizing he's not been told where to celebrate, he heads to Nizampur where he manages to find Dilshad, one of the fugitives. Everyone tries to stop Sanjay, who chases, beats up and almost arrests Dilshad, only to be cornered by the politicians and public who let him escape but without Dilshad. After being awarded the President Medal, Sanjay begins his hunt again and this time, through Dilshad's girlfriend Huma (Nora Fatehi), tricks him into coming to Nepal. He teams up with his officers once again, and sends a van to pick up Dilshad, as a part of his plan. The latter, however, sends someone else to check for anything suspicious. Sanjay runs to stop his officers from engaging upon realizing Dilshad's not in the van and lets it flee. Learning of nothing suspicious, Dilshad informs the van driver he'd depart the next day, and upon landing in Nepal, is stopped, thrashed and arrested by Sanjay and his team. The court proceedings begin, where the opposing lawyer (Rajesh Sharma) brings up arguments to counter Sanjay's truth and a parallel story of fake encounters, as per which K.K. and his men brought the students in L18, tortured and decided to kill them when they were ordered not to do so, following which K.K. was shot by one of his officers. Sanjay, however, brings out the truth that actually his officers had been closely watching the students and realized they belonged to the Indian Mujahideen. The real shootout then plays out, showcasing K.K. and his team engaging when the students fire, and the very fact that K.K. died gives Sanjay's argument a strong support when he tells everyone that no officer has ever died in a fake encounter. His arguments convince the court to sentence the 2 terrorists to life imprisonment, while the last one somehow escapes the country. While sections of the media still oppose the ruling and believe the police to be culprits, a video clip that surfaced in 2016 featured a confession from the terrorist who had escaped the encounter, about he managed to do so and later join the ISIS, further confirming the credibility of the encounter.

Produced by Dinesh Vijan under Maddock Films, the film stars Rajkummar Rao, Mouni Roy, Boman Irani, and explores the story of a Gujarati businessman, played by Rao, who goes to China to increase his business prospects. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Parinda Joshi. Principal photography began in September 2018 and concluded in May 2019. Initially planned to be released in August 2019. The film was theatrically released in India on 25 October 2019, on the occasion of Diwali. Plot During a cultural event in Gujarat, a Chinese delegate, General Zeng consumes a product called Tiger Soup and dies. The investigation into his death point towards the Tiger Soup as a possible cause of death and its manufacturer, Raghuvir \\"Raghu\\" Mehta who surrenders himself to the authorities. Over a flashback, it is shown that Raghu has been a failed Gujarati entrepreneur who lives with his wife Rukmini and his son Chintu. He struggles to come up with a profitable business idea and have cycled through several products which have failed to take off. His uncle forces him to go on a trip to China with his cousin Devraj where he is to meet investors about a sports drink business. In China, Devraj presents his product to Tanmay, a successful Gujrati entrepreneur, who rejects it. Despondent Devraj abandons Raghu to his own devices. He strikes up a bond with Tanmay who explains that customer's needs are akin to a lock and Raghu must find the key to that lock in order to be a successful businessman. Raghu goes on a drunken binge with Devraj's contact Xui Lee and in stupor, commits to meet her boss Hao Li while posing as Devraj. During the meeting, Hao introduces Raghu to Tiger Penis Soup which is the Chinese equivalent of Viagra. Hao proposes that Raghu shall sell this product in India and suggests that it will be successful over there because Chinese and Indians are constantly thinking about sex. While researching the market in India, Raghu realizes that there is no genuine solution available for sexual problems faced by men. Raghu proposes a business partnership to Dr. Tribhuvan Vardhi, a sexologist whose book have impressed Raghu, but Vardhi initially rejects the offer. Meanwhile, Raghu's inability to provide a steady income for his family creates tension between him and Rukmini. Raghu proceeds to recruit Vardhi with the promise of spreading sex awareness to the public and eventually Vardhi agrees. Back in the present, General Zeng's autopsy is held up in diplomatic red tape, forcing the investigators into trying to get to the truth through Raghu. Rewinding to the past, Raghu puts together a team of talented young professionals to handle manufacturing and distribution of the product. After some initial struggles, Raghu meets Tanmay who suggests Vardhi as the face of their product. The team arranges a seminar but Vardhi accidentally walks into a parent-teacher conference; his impassioned plea to make sexual discourse normal in society goes viral. As a result, the Tiger Soup business is wildly successful. However, Raghu hides the product from Rukmini and his extended family who think that he is running a business related to Chinese fans. Devraj soon finds out that the Tiger Soup is behind the success of Raghu. Raghu meets with Abhay Chopra, a successful investor and motivational speaker, who is in league with Devraj. Chopra proposes a business partnership but Raghu rejects the proposal. In retaliation, Devraj reveals to the family that Raghu is running the ostensibly disreputable Tiger Soup business. Chintu is expelled from his school when a bottle of Tiger Soup is found in his bag. When Rukmini finds out that Raghu lied about his business, she confronts him about it. A distressed Raghu goes to Vardhi to end their partnership but a timely call from Tanmay causes him to reconsider. Back to the present, Raghu and Vardhi appear before a preliminary commission consisting of several government agencies to explain their role in Zeng's death. Raghu reveals that there is no secret ingredient in the soup, it is just Rabdi, an Indian dessert, and implies that most sexual issues are more psychological than biological. Dr. Vardhi appeals to the commission not to consider sex as a taboo topic and encourages them to let the product continue instead of banning it. However, while bureaucratic pressures from the Chinese delegation force the commission to ban the Tiger Soup for some time, Raghu and Vardhi are acquitted and convey to the media that they are happy that the product was not banned completely. At the end, Raghu is shown as a successful owner of a chain of sexual health- related clinics with Dr. Vardhi as the face of the business and he is invited to a premier business school to give a lecture on being an entrepreneur. Rukmini is overwhelmed at the success of her husband and the achievements he has made. Raghu ends with the catchphrase \\"Customer .....\\" .

Vetticad of Firstpost gave two-star out of five and opined that the film had 'tonal and logical inconsistency in the narrative.' She noted that the film was a drag on long stretches, and the storytelling lacked liveliness. However, praising the performance of Rao and Roy, Vetticad concluded, \\"Made in China fails to hit the bull's eye because it sorely needed an evening out of pace and tone, depth of characterisation and detailing in the plotline. The best thing about it are Rao and Irani, who are a pleasure to watch even in this middling affair.\\". =Box office= Made In Chinas opening day domestic collection was 90 lacs.

The type species (and sole known species) is Dynamoterror dynastes. The generic name is derived from the Greek word dynamis (Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπœÇ) meaning \\"power\\" and the Latin word terror. The specific name is derived from Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ¨œÉœÑŒ∑œÇ, \\"ruler\\". Description Reconstructed frontal complex It has been estimated that Dynamoterror would have been about long. The holotype specimen, UMNH VP 28348, is an incomplete but associated skeleton consisting of cranial and postcranial elements including the left and right frontals, four vertebral centra, fragments of ribs, the right second metacarpal, the ilium, and two phalanx bones of the fourth toe of the left foot. Discovery Centrum of a middle tail vertebra The holotype specimen, UMNH VP 28348, was recovered in the lower Campanian Allison Member of the Menefee Formation in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico. The remains were first discovered in August 2012 during an expedition led by Andrew McDonald of the Western Science Center and Douglas Wolfe, the CEO of the Zuni Dinosaur Institute for Geosciences. During the expedition, volunteers Brian Watkins and Eric Gutierrez noticed fragmentary bones present within the sandstone. The specimen is currently housed in the collection of the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. Along with Lythronax, Dynamoterror is one of the oldest tyrannosaurids discovered so far. Classification McDonald et al. found Dynamoterror to belong to the Tyrannosaurinae. In their phylogenetic analysis, the genus formed a polytomy with other large bodied derived tyrannosaurines. This polytomy was likely caused by the genus' fragmentary nature. Below is a cladogram from McDonald et al., 2018. A study in 2020 determined Dynamoterror to be a nomen dubium due to the holotype's undiagnostic, fragmentary nature. Paleoecology Dynamoterror originates from the lower Campanian of the Allison Member of the Menefee Formation, New Mexico. Other fauna known from the formation include the nodosaurid Invictarx, the alligatoroid Brachychampsa sealeyi, and an unnamed centrosaurine ceratopsid.Williamson TE. 1997.

Since 2013 she has been a member of the Bundestag (Germany's national parliament), representing the Hanau electoral district which incorporates a number of towns and villages in the commuter belt to the east of Frankfurt and Offenbach. Within the CDU/CSU Bundestag Group, parliamentary colleagues elected her one of the alliance's eleven Bundestag deputy chairpersons in January 2018.  Early life and education  Katja Isabel R√ºb was born at Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe, a mid-sized town on the edge of the Pf√§lzerwald, roughly half an hour to the southwest of Ludwigshafen. She grew up in the Rhineland, her family ending up in Hanau after 1988. In 1994 she passed her school leaving exams (Abitur) at the Franziskaner-Gymnasium Kreuzburg (secondary school) in nearby Gro√ükrotzenburg. After that she took what in some ways amounted to a gap year, working as a teaching assistant at the Duke of York's Royal Military School in Dover, England. In 1995 Leikert embarked on a degree course in Political Sciences at Frankfurt university. By 2001 her university studies had also taken in Applied Economics, Statistics and Anglistics. Supported by the Erasmus Programme, she spent a semester at the University of Oslo between 1997 and 1998. In July 2003 she won a bursary under the German-American Fulbright Program which took her to Amhurst in Massachusetts. She was the recipient of a further bursary, this time from the German Marshall Fund of the United States and the German military authorities, during May/June 2005. Her doctorate, received from the University of Kaiserslautern (\\"Technische Universit√§t Kaiserslautern\\"), followed in 2006. Her dissertation was supervised by J√ºrgen Wilzewski and concerned United States security policy in respect of Iran and North Korea; it has subsequently been commercially published.  Political career  Katja Leikert joined the centre right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 2012. Leikert is chair of the Women's Union for her home region of Main-Kinzig, a co-opted member of the regional party executive, a co-opted member of the party executive for the municipality of Bruchk√∂bel and a member of the Bruchk√∂bel Commission for Families, Children, Young people and Old people. In the 2013 national parliamentary election Leikert stood successfully for election to the Bundestag, representing the Hanau electoral district (Wahlkreis 180). She won 44.3% of the first preference votes. It was, as she herself commented to reporters, an unbelievably rapid progression for someone who had only been a party member for slightly more than eighteen months. \\"I was certainly helped by the [national] political climate\\" (\\"Mir hat eindeutig das politische Klima geholfen\\"). She became a member of the Bundestag Health Committee, where she served as her parliamentary group's rapporteur on organ donation and eHealth. She also became meetings secretary (Schriftf√ºhrerin) and a deputising member of the Committee for Families, Women and Young people, and of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In the 2017 national parliamentary election Leikert successfully defended her parliamentary seat, albeit with a reduced majority. She won only 35.3% of the first preference votes, but this was still comfortably more than the second placed candidate, Sascha Raabe of the SPD. Both candidates saw reductions in their share of the vote, and populist or fringe parties gained vote share, reflecting wider national and international trends. Parliamentary colleagues elected her one of the CDU/CSU alliance's eleven Bundestag deputy chairpersons in January 2018, first under the leadership of Volker Kauder and later Ralph Brinkhaus.Guy Chazan (October 30, 2018), Looming end of Merkel era leaves hard choices for German parties Financial Times. Her areas of responsibility within the parliamentary group include policy on Europe, political co-ordination and co-operation with like- minded political parties in other parts of Europe, the European People's Party, the CDU's office in Brussels and human rights. In the negotiations to form a coalition government with Social Democrats (SPD) and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU), Leikert was part of her party's delegation.Mitglieder der CDU in den Koalitionsverhandlungen mit CSU und SPD CDU, press release of January 28, 2018.

Established in October 2012, it took control of the main oil export terminals in eastern Libya in the summer of 2013 and starting in March 2014 attempted to sell oil. In 2014, Ibrahim Jadhran ousted Idris Bukhamada, and became the new leader of the PFG. Despite initially allying himself with Khalifa Haftar, this alliance would later sour and lead to Jadhran accusing the LNA of trying to assassinate him in September 2015. During the Battle of Sirte (2016), the PFG joined the Government of National Accord-led offensive against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, taking control of Bin Jawad and Nawfiliyah on 27 May. After controlling the ports for years and costing Libya over 60 billion dollars of oil revenues, the Libyan National Army launched Operation Surprise Lightning on 10 September 2016 in a bid to take the PFG-controlled Brega, Zuwetina, Sidra and Ras Lanouf oil terminals. The next day, Local activists reported that Libyan National Army‚Äôs 166th Battalion managed to capture the town of Ajdabiya, Sadra, and Ras Lanouf after a fierce battle with the PFG forces in western Benghazi. By the 12th of September, The LNA had captured the headquarters of the Zueitina oil terminal, leaving the PFG with hardly any territory under its control. On the 14th, The LNA seized Brega, Prompting LNA Colonel Muftah al-Muqarief to declare victory, being quoted as saying \\"The entire oil crescent region is now under our control\\". Later in September, the PFG launched an abortive attempt to retake the Gulf of Sidra, Before being driven back with 5 PFG members killed and several vehicles destroyed. On 6‚Äì7 December 2016, the PFG, allied with the Benghazi Defense Brigades, launched another attempt to retake the Gulf of Sidra, Briefly seizing Nofaliya and Bin Jawad before being driven back by an LNA counterattack and retreating toward Harawa. The LNA followed up their victory with a retaliation raid in the vicinity of Al Jufrah air base, Killing field commander Umar Al Mukhtar and wounding 13, as well as advancing on Gate 50 east of Sirte with the 21st and 101st Infantry Battalions, and seizing the Brak Al Shati air base and Tamanhint air base in Sabha region with the 12th Brigade led by Mohammed Ben Nayel. In February 2017, Ibrahim Jadhran was sacked by the presidency council as leader of the PFG, and Idris Bukhamada was appointed as the new leader. By July 2019, the PFG, now under the command of Naji al-Maghrabi, had once again aligned itself with the LNA.

Cuticulosomes are 300-600 nm in diameter and are composed of ferritin-like granules that in some cases are structured in paracrystalline arrays. Due to its specific location in sensory hair cells of the inner ear and its iron-rich composition it was proposed to be involved in the magnetic sense of birds. However, physical simulations and calculations showed that it lacks sufficient magnetic susceptibility to act as a torque based magnetoreceptor.

Co-produced by the band with producer Flood, the material was recorded over several years, and displays the band's unique style of dance music, taking influences from hip hop, rock and dub music. The music incorporates breakbeats, tape loops, stalking basslines and numerous samples sourced from disparate material. The album's lyrics concern social issues, with the band aiming to write lyrics that approach issues from unusual angles. The album was promoted by three singles, including the UK Top 40 hit \\"Probably a Robbery\\" and dancefloor hit \\"Biting My Nails\\". Upon release, the album reached number 74 on the UK Albums Chart, and remains their only charting album. Music critics noted the band's hybrid sound and disparate influences. Over time, the album has been regarded as an innovative release, and has influenced numerous electronic acts including the Chemical Brothers and Leftfield. The band followed Soundclash with the remix album In Dub later on in 1990. Background and production Formed by multi- instrumentalists Gary Asquith, Danny Briottet (both formerly of Mass) and Carl Bonnie, Renegade Soundwave emerged on the London music scene in the late 1980s, applying the musical styles of punk rock and industrial music to electronic dance floor styles such as dub music, earning them comparisons with Meat Beat Manifesto, Cabaret Voltaire and Skinny Puppy. The band described themselves as a \\"by-product of punk,\\" explaining: \\"It forged the way we think, though the sound is nothing to do with it.\\" Their notorious first single, \\"Kray Twins\\" (1987), was released on Rhythm King Records and set samples of a television documentary to an underlying throbbing bass line. Following the release of the similarly notorious \\"Cocaine Sex,\\" which was released in a cocaine envelope, Renegade Soundwave switched labels to Mute Records as they appreciated the greater eclecticism present in their catalogue. Their first release on Mute was the Biting the Nails EP in 1988. Soundclash was Renegade Soundwave's debut album, and was co-produced by Renegade Soundwave and Flood. Paul Kendall engineered the sessions. Some of the songs on Soundclash date from as early as 1986, as the band spent some two years recording material for the album. Composition Soundclash blends together different styles of dance music into the band's distinctive style of alternative dance. The album draws from British dub music, American hip hop and rock music, and incorporates tape loops, samples, clattering breakbeats, and \\"stalking\\" bass lines. Asquith's rap vocals are nasal and reminiscent of Madchester music, although writer Greg Kot wrote that the \\"deadpan\\" vocals were similar to the Pet Shop Boys. Vocals, dance breaks and guitars are employed more conventionally on \\"Biting My Nails\\" and \\"Probably a Robbery.\\" The album samples from a diverse range of sources, including Queen, Tchaikovsky, Andy Williams and film soundtracks. The usage of several hip hop-oriented samples highlights the influence of golden age rap. The lyrics concern social issues; Asquith said of Soundclash: \\"It's adult, adult music. Our angle is not the obvious angle. It's a lot more ambiguous. A lot more open. There's a lot more ideas going into it than just one singular one. It's sort of ‚Äì objectionable.\\" \\"Blue Eyed Boy\\" features a sample later re-used by Public Enemy on their song \\"By the Time I Get to Arizona.\\" \\"Probably a Robbery\\" features a \\"rueful- vengeful jailbird narrative\\" that incorporates black humour. Musically, the song features a brass hook, singalong chorus, brittle beats and backing strings. \\"Murder Music\\" is a recording of a song Asquith wrote with Rema-Rema for their unreleased album, and samples the introductory drum beat from \\"The Crunge\\" by Led Zeppelin. The dance song \\"Biting My Nails\\" samples the chord progression and horn riff from Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\" (1966), and features lyrics about frustration over nightclub sets. A deconstructed cover version of Andy Williams' \\"Can't Get Used to Losing You\\", also a hit for The Beat, exemplifies the band's diverse tastes, and incorporates sinister sound effects, a pulsating bass line and a funky guitar riff reminiscent of Prince. Release Released on 20 February 1990, Soundclash was issued via Mute Records, and reached number 74 on the UK Albums Chart, spending one week on the chart. It remains their only charting album. Original British CD copies feature \\"The Phantom\\" and \\"Ozone Breakdown\\" as bonus tracks that are unlisted besides on a sticker. The release of Soundclash was preceded by several dance floor-orientated singles. \\"Space Gladiator\\" was the album's first single; it reached number 81 on the UK Singles Chart in November 1989 and stayed on the charts for four weeks. Even more successful was second single \\"Probably a Robbery\\", which spent six weeks on the chat, peaking at number 38 in February 1990. \\"Biting My Nails\\" reached number 76 on the chart in July. Adam Higginbotham of Select described \\"Probably a Robbery\\" and \\"Biting My Nails\\" as appearing to show Renegade Soundwave \\"on the verge of widespread success as their aggressive sound began to reach a wider audience.\\" Critical reception In a contemporary review, Option magazine described Renegade Soundwave as \\"[p]urposely subversive\\" and \\"calculatedly audacious,\\" and felt they created \\"danceable audio barrages, a pummeling sound that conveys a slick, edgy urban hipness, often spiked with a humorous tw[ist].\\" He felt that, despite its reliance on samples, the music is \\"a delicious tangle of sensory overload that manages to be cunningly original.\\" In his review for The Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot felt that the \\"dance noise terrorists\\" create a \\"fashionably gloomy atmosphere for their slamming rhythms, but never approach the intensity level of truly menacing industrial beat outfits such as Ministry.\\" In their review, CD Review described Renegade Soundwave as \\"an aggressive British trio that wants to attack faulty modern sensibilities and safe music by dragging you by your ear onto the dance floor.\\" They felt that Soundclash contains impressive samples, rhythm tracks and lyrics, but felt that \\"some of the material occasionally feels contrived.\\" Among retrospective reviews, John Bush of AllMusic said the album covered a lot of territory with a \\"unique sound aesthetic,\\" and wrote that it featured \\"a solid focus on the audio terrorism possible from sampling\\" despite the presence of \\"subpar\\" rapping. Tony Flecher of Trouser Press felt the album saw Renegade Soundwave suffer from \\"identity crisis,\\" adding: \\"Unsure whether to produce rock songs, dance anthems or dub jams, they experiment with each [...] and just come across confused.\\" Writing in 2010, Sputnikmusic Emeritus writer Iai described Soundclash as an \\"underground dance classic that, miraculously, still holds up.\\" The writer felt the album \\"blew away the cobwebs\\" with its ability and willingness to \\"drag several different strands of dance into [its] sound, most obviously hip-hop,\\" and complemented the band for not straying from club music territory throughout the album despite its \\"unusual orbit between genres.\\" They concluded: \\"I can't even begin to imagine how exciting this must have sounded in 1989, at a time when British music was in the doldrums and independent labels were so far out of sight that it was easy to believe that they didn't even exist; even now, it sounds like the kind of album that could spark a movement.\\" MusicRadar described Soundclash as a \\"masterpiece of genre- splicing breaks, samples and electronica.\\" Legacy Soundclash has been credited for influencing acts such as Stereo MC's (pictured). In 1994, Larry Flick of Billboard described Soundclash as innovative for breaking musical barriers, and noted its influence and inspiration on \\"so many artists and producers.\\" He continued: \\"A quick stomp through almost any current rave or trance program will turn up a slew of direct descendants of 'Biting My Nails', 'Women Respond to Bass,' and 'Probably a Robbery'.\\" Iai felt the album was influential on big beat, with The Chemical Brothers naming Renegade Soundwave as their main influence and Fatboy Slim also borrowing from the album. They also identified house act Leftfield as being influenced by the album, while crediting the album's \\"nasal, boozy, quasi-Madchester rapping\\" as a large influence on EMF and Stereo MCs. In 1999, Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger ranked \\"Probably a Robbery\\" at number 60 in his list of the \\"Top 100 Singles of the 1990s.\\" In the accompanying write-up, he wrote that Renegade Soundwave were \\"well ahead of their time, and not just musically. Their tough electro-dub experiments get some credit now for helping to spread the breakbeat virus through British dance music, but their crim-glam stance now seems just as prophetic.\\" He added of the song: In comparing Soundclash to the music of the Clash, writer Chris Knowles described Soundclash as a \\"landmark album\\" and felt it was \\"squarely in the mold of a tightly focused Sandinista!,\\" similarly to Meat Beat Manifesto's Satyricon (1992). Renegade Soundwave followed Soundclash with a \\"stripped back dub\\" remix album entitled In Dub (1990), which contained remixes of several songs from the former album, including \\"Pocket Porn\\", \\"Traitor\\" and \\"Blue Eyed Boy.\\" In a 2006 interview, Asquith named both Soundclash and In Dub as the albums of which he is most proud of, and expressed an interest in remixing Soundclash with Briottet.

They offer multiple services to their partners, and specialize in offering group exclusive rates. They represent over 700 public and private organizations, professional orders, and unions across Canada. The Personal is a subsidiary of Desjardins General Insurance, the third largest P&C; insurer in Canada.  History  In 1974, The Personal created the auto and home group insurance concept in Canada. The concept of group insurance was popular for life policies, but for the first time, the concept was applied to cars and homes. Auto and home were the only products offered initially. Later, The Personal broadened their range of services to include other products, such as recreational vehicles, travel and pets. On May 2, 1986, The Personal (then called The Security), reached an agreement with the Centrale de l'enseignement du Qu√©bec (CEQ), who was looking for group insurance. This agreement signaled the official start of group P&C; insurance in Quebec. In 2004, Desjardins Group did a major restructuring of The Personal to unify its activities all around Canada. They wanted to use the same technology, same principles and same management throughout their subsidiaries to become a true pan-Canadian company. In 2013, alongside Desjardins General Insurance, The Personal launched Ajusto, which was one of the first \\"widely available UBI offerings to be approved by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO)\\". Usage based insurance was already used in some countries (United States, United Kingdom and Europe) before telematics technology got to Canada with the help of iMetrik Solutions.  Group insurance  The sector of group insurance in Canada became more and more popular in the 1980s and 1990s, creating more competition that led to better coverage: with more choices, the prices got more stable and the service improved. However, it also led to what was called ‚Äúsynthetic groups‚Äù, that were not considered as real groups sharing the same situation (risk profile, affinity, homogeneous characteristics). The rules to be considered as a group are not the same in every province of Canada, and in Quebec, the lack of regulation created a \\"free market model\\". In reaction, The Personal created their own specific guidelines for their partners.  Services  The Personal offers group insurance products to insure cars, homes, recreational vehicles and pets, and also includes identity theft assistance. They offer their services through agents, their company website, and recently through their mobile app (used as a control center for all the mobile programs). Their two principal mobile features are Ajusto and Alert.  Prices and distinctions  According to a J.D. Power study about customer satisfaction with home insurance, The Personal ranked first in Quebec in 2015. The same study in 2018 for the auto insurance sector also ranked the company as first in Canada.  Privacy rights criticism  In 2013, some concerns were raised about the new technology Intelauto and Ajusto that could be used to \\"spy\\" on customers. Privacy Commissioner Dr. Ann Cavoukian tried to put a hold on these fears, since the program is on a voluntary basis and the contract clearly stipulates the terms, which means the users stay in control of their information. However, not all concerns were waived : John Lawford, executive director and general counsel with the Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC) in Ottawa, raised a point that even if these information are strictly for the user, they still could be disclosed to third parties in some situations like civil cases, where it could be dig out by law enforcement. In 2017, The Personal faced accusation of citizen's privacy rights. They were accused by the federal Privacy Commissioner of accessing credit rating without proper reasons. The Personal defended themselves by saying that they accessed such information only to rule out fraudulent claims, but advocate Rhona DesRoches suggested that \\"companies want instead to gauge the claimant‚Äôs financial status to help determine how little they can get away with paying out\\".

There is a baptismal record in the register of Durham Cathedral dated 24 October 1797 whilst Probate records of 28 February 1862 record her death in Heidelberg on 26 December 1861, letters of administration having been granted to her son Albert Henry. into a political and literary family. At the time of her birth her father Rt Rev Dr Henry Bathurst (1744‚Äì1837) was prebendary canon at Durham Cathedral, later becoming Bishop of Norwich. Her uncle, Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst (1684- 1775) was a Government minister and literary patron and friend of, amongst others, Laurence Sterne and William CongreveCaroline de Crespigny: Forgotten Romantic Poetess, Krysztof Fordonski; University of Warsaw, 2013 Her mother was Grace Coote, a sister of Sir Eyre Coote, a military governor of Jamaica. One of her siblings Benjamin Bathurst gained notoriety during the Napoleonic War by his sudden, unexplained disappearance. In her late teens or early twenties she may have been a mistress of Lord Byron as opined in letters by Julie Gmelin.Letters of Julie Gmelin, 19 June 1849, published in Badische Post that describes her as a former mistress of Byron, 21 March 1924 Whilst this is a possibility it may also be dubious speculation from Gmelin, who also records her as an accomplished harpist and harpsichord player. A number of watercolours also survive her. In July 1820 Caroline Bathurst married Heaton Champion de Crespigny, later vicar of Neatishead in Norfolk, settling in Vevey in Switzerland where their first child Eyre was born in May 1821.Norfolk Chronicle 22 July 1820 page 3, The British Newspaper Archive at British LibraryObituary of Bishop Henry Bathurst, Gentlemen's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, Volume 43 1837 Her husband was profligate, and family letters written by Bishop Bathurst detail that by 1828 Heaton was in serious debt and unable to adequately support his wife and five children. The marriage had ended by 1837 when her father died and she came into her own money. Heidelberg A decision was made around 1840 to relocate the family to Heidelberg in Grand Duchy of Baden, Germany, where there was a small English literary community. It was in Heidelberg in 1841 that de Crespigny met the \\"friend\\", mentioned in the preface to her collection of poems, My Souvenir published in 1844. Thomas Medwin was the cousin and biographer of Percy Bysshe Shelly and Lord Byron. Their shared knowledge of Byron may have been a catalyst to their lasting intimacy. In 1842 Medwin published a novel Lady Singleton where de Crespigny's verse appears at the head of some chapters and she is probably \\"the high-born and highly gifted lady\\" that Medwin thanks in his preface for the novel.Captain Medwin, Friend of Byron and Shelley, Ernest J Lovell Jr, University of Texas Press, Austin (1962) Neither was financially secure enough to divorce their spouse, and the relationship was primarily intellectual. They spent the next twenty years until de Crespigny's death in 1861 participating in the literary life of this university city . Their mixed German and English friends included, amongst others, Fanny Brawne Lindon, a lover and muse of John Keats and Mary and William Howitt.An Autobiography: Mary Howitt (London 1891) In 1848 Revolution swept through Germany including Heidelberg and de Crespigny and Medwin thought it judicious to exit to more peaceable Weinsberg in Wurttemberg where their host was poet, Justinus Kerner. Justinus Kerner in old age  My Souvenir, or, Poems (1844)  Her most significant publication, still in print,My Souvenir, or , Poems, volume 1, Caroline de Crespigny, General Books LLC, Memphis, USA, (2012) appeared in 1844. My Souvenir includes original poems, together with a number of translations, from Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, French and German poets. It is probable that Medwin, a skilled polyglot is responsible for some of these translations but he is not credited. Some of the original poems refer to subject matter related to her own family, such as Lines Written on Hearing of the Death My Niece Rosa Bathurst, Drowned in The Tiber, Aged Seventeen or For My Mother's Tomb at Malvern. The style is late romantic. An anonymous reviewer of My Souvenir referred to the original verses as distinguished by \\"elegance, sweetness, and tenderness rather than power or passion\\", adding that the translations \\"are selected with taste and feeling; and those from German are not the least attractive portion of the volume\\".Anonymous: Tait‚Äôs Edinburgh Magazine, July 1844, vol II (127) p.469 Two further volumes of translations and original poems appeared in quick succession: The Enchanted Rose: A Romant In Three Cantos, a translation from Ernst Schulze: The Enchanted Rose: A Romant In Three Cantos: Translated from the German of Ernst Schulze (1844),A Romant or Romaunt is a poetic term attributed to romantic verse often in epic form and A Vision of Great Men (1848) which concentrated on translating the poems of German poetessesA .Vision Of Great Men With Other Poems as Translated from the Poetesses of Germany‚Äô (1848) Whilst De Crespigny's own work remained hidden, her translations of poets such as Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff and Justinus Kerner introduced these literary figures to a wider English-speaking audience.Anglo-German and American-German Crosscurrents by Arthur Orcutt Lewis, W. Lamarr Kopp, Edward J.

During the Spanish Civil War, he fought on the Republican side and was a member to the Durruti Column. He formed part of the Spanish government in exile as a technical advisor to the War Industries Commission of Catalonia. He crossed the Pyrenees into France on 25 January 1939, was interned by French authorities and sent to a prison camp at Perpignan. In September 1939, Pablo Neruda arranged that Pey and his family board the SS Winnipeg for Chile.

Despite his complaints, Berlioz continued writing music criticism for most of his life, long after he had any financial need to do so.Murphy, p. 111 Criticism Berlioz wrote for many journals, including the R√©novateur, Journal des d√©bats and Gazette musicale.Cairns, p. 95 He was active in the D√©bats for over thirty years until submitting his last signed article in 1863. Almost from the founding, Berlioz was a key member of the editorial board of the Gazette, as well as a contributor, and acted as editor on several occasions while the owner was otherwise engaged.Cairns, p. 96 Berlioz took advantage of his times as editor, allowing himself to increase his articles written on music history rather than current events, evidenced by him publishing seven articles on Gluck in the Gazette between June 1834 and January 1835. He produced over one hundred articles for the Gazette between 1833 and 1837. This is a conservative estimate, as not all of his submissions were signed. In 1835 alone, during one of his many times of financial difficulty, he wrote four articles for the Monde dramatique, twelve for the Gazette, nineteen for the D√©bats and thirty-seven for the R√©novateur.Cairns, p. 85 These were in-depth articles and reviews. Berlioz' devotion to journalistic integrity and even-handedness is exemplified in that, while the Gazette criticized Henri Herz for his seemingly endless stream of variations on opera themes, it also positively reviewed his music on occasion.Cairns, p. 97 The Gazette did not always praise Berlioz's music, although it always recognised him as an important and serious composer. The Revue musicale published many personal attacks against Berlioz written by critic Fran√ßois- Joseph F√©tis.Cairns, p. 98 Robert Schumann published a detailed rebuttal of one of F√©tis' attacks on Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique in his own Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik journal. In writing reviews, Berlioz was able to indulge himself in attacking his b√™tes noires and extolling his enthusiasms. The former included musical pedants, coloratura writing and singing, viola players who were merely incompetent violinists, inane libretti, and baroque counterpoint.Wright Roberts (I), pp. 65, 69 and 71 He extravagantly praised Beethoven's symphonies, and Gluck's and Weber's operas, and scrupulously refrained from promoting his own compositions.Wright Roberts (II), pp. 138 and 140 Despite his complaints, Berlioz continued writing music criticism for most of his life, long after he had any financial need to do so. Books Two of the books by Berlioz were compiled from his journal articles. Les soir√©es de l‚Äôorchestre (Evenings with the Orchestra) (1852), a scathing satire of provincial musical life in 19th century France, and the Treatise on Instrumentation, a pedagogic work, were both serialised originally in the Gazette musicale. Many parts of the M√©moires (1870) were originally published in the Journal des d√©bats, as well as Le monde illustr√©.HBerlioz.com The M√©moires paint a magisterial (if biased) portrait of the Romantic era through the eyes of one of its chief protagonists. Evenings with the Orchestra is more overtly fictional than his other two major books, but its basis in reality is its strength, making the stories it recounts all the funnier due to the ring of truth. W. H. Auden praises it, saying \\"To succeed in [writing these tales], as Berlioz most brilliantly does, requires a combination of qualities which is very rare, the many-faceted curiosity of the dramatist with the aggressively personal vision of the lyric poet.\\" The work was closely studied by Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss and served as the foundation for a subsequent textbook by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, who, as a music student, attended the concerts Berlioz conducted in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

She gained her undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences in 1991 from the University of Zimbabwe, winning the BSc programs student award and the best BSc Honours student award in Biological Sciences. She gained a DPhil in Biological Sciences at the University of Oxford, as a Beit Trust Scholar. She is an alumnus of Linacre College, Oxford.  Career  The life cycle of bilharzia (Schistosomiasis) After completing her PhD, Mutapi's postdoctoral training was at the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp from 1997 to 1999. She went on to a lectureship at St Hilda's College, Oxford in the Department of Zoology. She has also worked in the Department of Microbiology at Birkbeck College and the Department of Clinical Veterinary Studies at the University of Glasgow. In 2002 Mutapi joined the University of Edinburgh on an Medical Research Council Training Fellowship. As Reader in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, Mutapi's research was in global health and tropical diseases, specialising particularly in the study of schistosomiasis/bilharzia, a disease caused by a parasitic worm which develops in snails. Her work contributed to the prioritisation of bilharzia as a public health concern by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and pharmaceutical company Merck KgaA. In 2012 Mutapi was one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh‚Äôs Young Academy. She was elected a Fellow of the African Academy of Sciences in 2015 and is a Fellow of the Zimbabwe Academy of Sciences. Mutapi is currently Professor in Global Health Infection and Immunity, and she is co- Director of the Global Health Academy at the University of Edinburgh. Mutapi is also Deputy Director of the NIHR Global Health Research Unit TIBA (Tackling Infections to Benefit Africa), which takes a holistic approach to implementing research into evidence-based policies in African countries, taking into account science, technological challenges, and socioeconomics. In 2018 Mutapi was awarded the University of Edinburgh's Chancellor‚Äôs Award for Impact in recognition of her work on the treatment for bilharzia. The next year Mutapi was made a member of the advisory board for the UK Global Challenges Research Fund. In addition to her scientific work Mutapi is a painter, using funds from her work to support education in Zimbabwe.  Research  Mutapi's lab at the University of Edinburgh, the Parasite Immuno-epidemiology Group, researches immune responses to helminths within individuals and across populations primarily in Africa. Additionally her research has a focus on developing a formulation of praziquantel, the only drug effective against schistosomiasis infection, for children. Currently the drug is a large pill which children in high-risk areas struggle and are often reluctant to take. Currently there are no available vaccines for infections by helminth worms including bilharzia. Mutapi is pioneering proteomics approaches to develop new vaccine candidates for these parasites. This involves the use of mass spectrometry find parasite antigens (proteins which activate an adaptive immune response) which are ingredients for effective vaccines. In poorer regions of Africa coinfection by multiple different pathogens is a common occurrence. Mutapi has pioneered research into many examples of this, such as malaria and schistosomiasis coinfections, and infections by multiple different malaria species.

Many artefacts have been found in the gravel around what is now the airport, and the Colne Valley.Cotton, Mills & Clegg 1986, p. 34 Waste pits filled with struck flint, arrowheads and fragments of pottery were also found in the area, indicating a settlement, though none other remains of such a settlement.Cotton, Mills & Clegg 1986, p. 36 Until about 1930, there was only one building (part of Bath Road Farm) on the north side of Bath Road between The Magpies (an area around and opposite the north exit of the recent Heathrow Road), and Longford; other buildings were built afterwards there before World War II, including three factories (Technicolor and Penguin Books and Black and Decker). By 1944, there were no buildings on the south side of Bath Road between The Magpies and Longford. Heathrow was away from main roads and further away from railways; that kept it secluded and quiet although near London. As Middlesex changed to market gardening and fruit growing to supply expanding London, parts of Heathrow held on to old-type mixed farming, and thus was chosen for Middlesex area horse- drawn ploughing competitions, which needed land which was under stubble after harvest. The ford where High Tree Lane crossed the Duke of Northumberland's River was a scenic spot used sometimes for picnics and courting couples. There was a footpath along beside the river from the ford to Longford. Development Agriculture became the main source of income for residents in the hamlet, as the brickearth soil in the area made farming ideal (it held manure well and did not go sticky when wet), so Heathrow became part of the west Middlesex market gardening industry. Many residents grew fruit, vegetables, and flowers,. The page includes an image of a half-timbered cottage in Heathrow village. which they would travel with into London to sell, on the return journey collecting manure for farming.Sherwood 1990, p. 18; Sherwood 2009, p. 32 As the coming of motor vehicles made urban horse manure (from stables and cleaned off roads) much less, they started instead using sewage sludge (up to 50 tons per acre) from the Perry Oaks sewage works as fertiliser. The Middlesex Agricultural and Growers' Association held annual ploughing matches in Heathrow, until the last, the 99th, was held on 28 September 1937;Sherwood 1990, p. 20; Sherwood 2009, p. 33 the 100th match (in 1938) was postponed to 1939 due to severe drought, and in 1939 it was cancelled because World War II had started. The Royal Commission on Historic Monuments listed 28 historically significant buildings in the parish of Harmondsworth, a third of which were in Heathrow.Sherwood 1990, p. 33 Notable buildings included Heathrow Hall, a late 18th-century farmhouse, which was on Heathrow Road,Sherwood 2006, p.14 and Perry Oaks farm, which was Elizabethan. In the 19th century much brickearth-type land in west Middlesex, including in Heathrow, was used for orchards of fruit trees, often several sorts mixed in one orchard. Much soft fruit was grown, often in the orchards under the fruit trees. Sometimes vegetables, or flowers for cutting, were grown under the fruit trees. An author in 1907Stephen Springall, Country Rambles round Uxbridge, 1907 reported \\"thousands and thousands\\" of plum, cherry, apple, pear, and damson trees, and innumerable currant and gooseberry bushes, round Harmondsworth and Sipson and Harlington and Heathrow.Sherwood 2009, p. 31 After World War I the amount of fruit growing in the area decreased due to competition from imports and demand for more market-gardening land, and by 1939 less than 10% of the orchard area was left. Produce was taken to Covent Garden market, or by smaller growers to Brentford market, which was nearer but less profitable. From the Three Magpies lane junction near Heathrow to Covent Garden is 14 miles by road, which was about 6 hours at laden horse-and-wagon speed, so goods to market had to set off at 10 pm the day before to reach the market when it opened at 4 am,Sherwood 2009, p. 33 until motor trucks came. Lighter produce such as strawberries where freshness was important could reach Covent Garden Market in an hour and a half in a light vehicle behind a light fast horse. An 11.93-acre field fronting on the south side of the Bath Road, about 600 yards east of Heathrow Road, was shown as allotment gardens on a map dated 1935,Old 1:2500 scale Ordnance Survey maps, reproduced at about 15 inches = 1 mile, publ. Alan Godfrey Maps:- * Heathrow, 1934, Middlesex sheet 19.08, * Hatton, 1935, Middlesex sheet 20.05, * Sipson, 1935, Middlesex sheet 19.04, and it appears to be allotment gardens in the 1940 Luftwaffe air survey.Sherwood 2009, p.14 In the 1930s Heathrow Hall and Perry Oaks were mixed farms with wheat and cattle and sheep and pigs, and the other farms were largely market gardening and fruit growing. Photographs from early in the 20th century show milk cattle (about 22 in the photograph) at Cain's Farm and the yearly horse ploughing competition held along Cain's Lane, in the southeast of Heathrow; later photographs show ploughing competitions in the north near Tithe Barn Lane on land belonging to Heathrow Hall. Sipson Farm at the north end of Sipson may have owned land in Heathrow. Timeline =13th century= * 1265: First mention of Southcote (later Southcoterow), a hamlet, or a name used for an area of farmland and houses (probably in the southwest of Harmondsworth parish). It occurs intermittently in mediaeval records until the 16th century, usually alternating with 'Heathrow'. At one time it included Perry (= Perry Oaks). =14th century= * 1337: Perry Oaks is mentioned (called \\"Perry\\") in a rental. =15th century= * about year 1410: Heathrow was first mentioned, as La Hetherewe. =16th century= *Henry VIII of England's reign (1491‚Äì1547): The west part of the Duke of Northumberland's River was made past Heathrow. *1530: An old record lists an increase, probably temporary, of 42 labourers who were working on a new river cut from Longford, London (probably the Duke of Northumberland's River). *1583: Heathrow contained 14 houses. =17th century= *1648 or 1647: Inhabitants of Heathrow and around unauthorizedly blocked the Duke of Northumberland's River to stop flood damage that it was causing. *1653: Petitions were lodged to try to stop the Duke of Northumberland's River from being reopened. =18th century= *1784: General William Roy sought an area of land suitable for the base line of the Anglo-French Survey (1784‚Äì1790) trigonometrical survey. He chose the site because it was flat and near the Royal Observatory. The baseline for his measurements ran from King's Arbour (now within the confines of Heathrow Airport) to the Poor House in Hampton. See map. The ends were originally marked by vertical wooden pipes (which could support flagstaffs), but in the resurvey of 1791 they were found to be rotting and were replaced by cannons which are still to be seen.For full information and references see Anglo- French Survey (1784‚Äì1790) * Late 18th century: Heathrow Hall farmhouse was built. =19th century= * For much of the 19th century the Tillyer family lived in Heathrow Hall and the Weekley family in Perry Oaks. * 18 March 1800: Start of lease of Richard Weekley at Perry Oaks. * 1819: Enclosure of Harmondsworth parish. (Before that, most of the area bounded by Heathrow Road and the Bath Road and Tithe Barn Lane, and extending some way west from that, was one of the open fields of the parish and was called Heathrow Field, and the land southeast of Heathrow Road was common land locally called The Heath; those two area names stayed in local use long after.) Heathrow Field and the common land were divided into individual landholding fields. Cain's Lane was made straight across the common land: it was named after Isaac Cane, who was assigned land by the lane. High Tree Lane was made. Then or afterwards, a new row of farms was set up on this new farmland along both sides of Cain's Lane. Common land in the area of the later Wild's farm (Shrub End and Croft House) was assigned, some to Thomas Wild, Senior and some to William Wild, one area as freehold and other areas as copyhold. Much land in the north of the Heathrow area where the soil and brickearth above the gravel would be deepest, was assigned to \\"George Byng, Esq.\\", some as landowner, some in lieu of rights to tithe; all or much of this land later became property of Heathrow Hall.Sherwood, Philip 2009, p21 (At the time, the title \\"Esq.\\" implied that he was a member of the upper gentry.) 71 acres was assigned to the Vicar of Harmondsworth in lieu of tithes. (It remained church property until on 31 Jan 1929 it was the first land in Heathrow that Fairey Aviation bought as a start to its Great West Aerodrome.) * 14 February 1834: Cain's Farm farmhouse burnt down.Sherwood, 1993, pages 46-53 * 8 November 1845: During the Railway Mania a new railway was proposed, branching off an existing railway at Knightsbridge and running to Exeter, passing through or near Hounslow and Heathrow. This railway was not built; if it had been, a station at Heathrow might have started suburban spread there. * 1847: John Byng, son of George Byng, was made John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford. (In 1799 the previous Earl of Strafford died without male heir and his title became extinct.) * 25 September 1872:Bankruptcy meeting in the case of Thomas Fowke, of Heathrow House, Heathrow, market gardener. * 1877: Heathrow School was opened on the north side of the Bath Road, almost opposite The Old Magpies. (The current Earl Strafford donated the land that it was built on.) * 1880: The Mission Church of St. Saviour was opened on the north side of the Bath Road, almost opposite The Three Magpies. It was built in corrugated iron.Sherwood, Philip 2006, p29 * 1891: Rev. J. Williams Ashman (a curate to the vicar of Harmondsworth) is listed as living (probably as a lodger) in Heathrow Hall. * 2 February 1874: A gale or a tornado demolished the Tithe Barn on Tithe Barn Lane. * 29 October 1886: George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford died aged 80 and was succeeded by George Byng, 3rd Earl of Strafford * 1894: Death duty was introduced in Britain. * 1898: A notice advertising sale by auction of an area of land east of Cain's Lane says that \\"Earl Strafford\\" (George Byng, 3rd Earl of Strafford (1830‚Äì1898) or Henry Byng, 4th Earl of Strafford (1831‚Äì1899)) owned some adjacent land that in the 1819 map was marked as belonging to George Byng, Esq. That lot was \\"lot eight\\" in the auction; it is not stated whether any or all the other lots were land. * 28 March 1898: George Byng, 3rd Earl of Strafford died childless aged 68 and was succeeded by his brother Henry Byng, 4th Earl of Strafford. * 16 May 1899: Henry Byng, 4th Earl of Strafford died aged 67. This double succession with less than 5 years' warning about death duties would probably have forced the Byng family to sell much land to pay the death duties. =20th century= ::For 1929 and after, see also Great West Aerodrome and History of London Heathrow Airport#1920s and History of London Heathrow Airport#1930s. * Some time around 1900: Heathrow Hall was sold to Jonathan Smith, who then began to live there. * 1901: A corrugated iron mission hall church (\\"tin tabernacle\\") was built on Cain's Lane, by the Baptist Church at Sipson. * Early 1900s: Jonathan Smith sold Heathrow Hall to Josia Philp and moved into Wall Garden Farm in Sipson (on the north side of Sipson Lane, now due north of Heathrow Airport's main entrance). Jonathan Smith set up a jam factory (Smith's Jams) using fruit grown in the area, and later his son Frederick took over the factory;Information from Philip Sherwood, with thanks. its site is now under part of Kenwood Close in Sipson. * 16 November 1905: a petition of bankruptcy was filed against Jonathan Smith (market gardener) of Heathrow Hall, Harmondsworth, \\"lately residing at Sipson\\". * 13 October 1908: A bankruptcy court decided to discharge Jonathan Smith's bankruptcy as from 13 October 1910, and reported that Jonathan Smith had earlier made an arrangement with his creditors, and that his assets were worth less than half of what he owed, and that he had not kept proper account books. * 1911: Frederick and his wife Irene Philp, and Frederick's father Josiah Philp, lived at Heathrow Hall. (Irene was born in 1887 as Irene Martha Whetnall.) * Week ending 8 September 1924: A power-farming demonstration organized by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders was (planned to be) held on Heathrow Hall farm (owned then by Mr. J. E. Philp). The reference says that this event \\"[took] the place of the former tractor trials\\", but not whether those tractor trials were at Heathrow. * 1925: Norman Macmillan, an RAF officer, made a forced landing and take-off at Heathrow. He noted the flatness of the land and its suitability for an airfield. * 1926: Plaques were added to commemorate the 200th anniversary of General Roy's birth. * 1929: Fairey Aviation bought the first of several plots of land west of Cain's Lane and there started the Great West Aerodrome. By then Norman Macmillan was Fairey Aviation's chief test pilot. * 1930: The Church of St. Saviour (on the north side of the Bath Road) was demolished and replaced by a brick building further from the road. (It was demolished in the 1960s and the Excelsior Hotel was built on its site.) The Road Research Laboratory was opened on the Colnbrook by-pass. * 12 June 1931: Middlesex County Council bought land for ¬£33,000 from W.Whittington & Son, the owners of Perry Oaks farm; it was orchard then; they later built the Perry Oaks sewage sludge works there. * Early 1930s: Middlesex County Council set up 24 smallholdings (Burrows Hill Close Estate and Bedfont Court Estate) west of Perry Oaks sewage works, each with a small house. * 1933: A local trade directory lists for Heathrow these: Mrs.Waddell (Cain's Farm house); _farmers or market gardeners_ : Harry Curtis (Heathrow Farm), George Dance (a small house on Heathrow Road nearly opposite the Plough and Harrow pub), William Howell (Bathurst), Frederick Philp (Heathrow Hall), Sidney Whittington (Perry Oaks), David and John Wild (Croft House); _other_ : Heathrow Sand & Gravel Co (Colnbrook) Ltd., Edgar Charles Basham (the trade directory misprinted his surname as Sasham) (publican at the Plough and Harrow pub), Fairey Aviation. * 1934: D.J.Wild married Naomi from Shrub End (a big farm a bit southwest of Colchester, now built over); Shrub End farmhouse in Heathrow may have been named after it. * 1934: The Perry Oaks sewage works was built; thereby Perry Oaks farm lost a large area of orchard. * 1935: Middlesex County Council built four houses (1,2,3,4 Perry Oaks) for the sewage works staff. They later became property of the Ministry of Defence and stayed there (between the airport and the sewage works) when Heathrow Airport at its present size was built in 1944 and after. * 5 May 1935: First Royal Aeronautical Society airshow at the Great West Aerodrome. An aerial photograph taken then shows twenty four display aircraft parked, and in front of them what may be about fifteen more, smaller, southwest of the big hangar, and about two hundred cars parked northwest of Gamble's Farm on the northeast edge. Over 2,000 people visited, some in private aeroplanes; these were parked along the south boundary, out of shot on the photograph. Perfect weather.  More people visited in these airshows than visited Heathrow in the rest of the year.Sherwood, Philip 1990, p.68, including quotation from The Aeroplane magazine, issue of 8 May 1935 * 1936: Technicolor Ltd opened a factory on the north side of the Bath Road opposite Heathrow's land. * 23 October 1936: Kingsley Wood formally opened the Perry Oaks sewage sludge works and the main sewage works at Mogden, but they had been in use for a period before that. * 1938: Penguin Books opened a factory on the north side of the Bath Road opposite Heathrow's land. * 14 May 1939: Fifth and last Royal Aeronautical Society airshow at the Great West Aerodrome.Sherwood, Philip 1990, p.69 Twenty aircraft displayed; plus also (during the first tea interval) nine Spitfires and then nine Bristol Blenheims. * 1 September 1939: World War II started. The Heathrow Brick Co., Ltd. applied to HM Land Registry to register land on Heathrow Road. Flower growers changed to growing vegetables. * 1940: Black & Decker opened a factory on the north side of the Bath Road at the junction with Hatch Lane. (It closed in the 1970s and it has gone.)Sherwood, Philip 2012, p.77 * 1940: Battle of Britain: fighter planes sometimes landed on the Great West Aerodrome for the night and their pilots sometimes got a bed for the night in Heathrow village. * 4 February 1941: D. J. Wild (living at Shrub End) and J. E. Wild (living at Croft House) applied to HM Land Registry to register land at Shrub End and Croft House on Cain's Lane in Heathrow.http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35065/pages/707 * 4 November 1941: First mention of the bankruptcy case of 4 brothers surnamed Portsmouth (builders), 2 living in Harlington and 2 in Heathrow. It ran on until at least 18 September 1942.http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35339/pages/6473 * 1 July 1943: A meeting of the creditors of the Heathrow Brick Company was scheduled to be held on 9 July 1943.http://www.london- gazette.co.uk/issues/36082/pages/3064 * 1944: The Caesar's Camp early Iron Age village on the airport site was excavated. There was a Bronze Age field system and some Neolithic remains. * 1944: Heathrow hamlet was obliterated by the modern airport construction work. The cannon in Heathrow was removed, as it would have stood close to one of the main runways, though it was later returned to the original spot with the plaque placed separately.Sherwood, Philip 1990, pp. 13‚Äì15; Sherwood 2009, pp. 25‚Äì28 One information listSherwood 2009, p.85 says that stage one of building the airport destroyed, or was planned to destroy, sixteen farmhouses, twenty three dwelling houses, and thirty five cottages, but some of these may have been in the north part of Hatton, and that list may not include Perry Oaks. Another information sourceSherwood 2009, p.86 says 2,650 acres and 215 homes, but that may be the original full plan including demolishing Sipson and most of Harlington. The Perry Oaks sewage works protected Burrows Hill Close Estate and Bedfont Court Estate for 57 more years. Responsibility for the evictees was passed between the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Health. Most of them were moved to Air Ministry property near RAF Heston.Sherwood 2009, p.81 The Wilds of Shrub End and Croft House found new farmland near Colchester (near where David Wild's wife had come from), and evacuated their greenhouses and packing shed and front gate and front hedge there. Some of the Heathrow farmers and market gardeners found land in Kent to grow crops on. * June 1946: An air photo of the airport shows only the first triangle of runways, and Cain's Farm still standing (but not necessarily still occupied) just outside the airport's perimeter road.Sherwood, Philip 2012, p6 * 25 January 1949: The Minister of Civil Aviation applied to H.M. Land Registry to register freehold ownership of land at Perry Oaks Farm. * 1949 or before: Houses along Hatton Road were demolished. * 1951: The Old Magpies pub (100 yards west of The Three Magpies) was demolished. * 1995: A road sign in a photographSherwood, Philip 2009, p35 shows that there was an Equestrian Centre for the Handicapped in the Burrows Hill Close Estate. * 2001: Burrows Hill Close Estate (east of Stanwell Moor Road) was obliterated by building Terminal 5, and Bedfont Court Estate (west of Stanwell Moor Road) was dug up to extract gravelSherwood, Philip 2006, p20; Sherwood, Philip 2009, p35 (see Google Earth image). Notable buildings :See :File:Heathrow Before World War II Map.jpg#Road names for the names of the roads. =Heathrow Road= Starting at the north end: * Doghurst Cottages, east side, north end, built around 1900, demolished in the early 1950s. Old photographs show them as brick-built 2-storey houses with slate or tile roofs. * Bathurst market garden, east side. Opposite it: * W & S Philp's market garden, west side, grew flowers until World War II started. * 2 modern houses, west side: in the 1930s Mr. Ward (headmaster at Harmondsworth school) lived there. * A thatched house, west side, the two Biddescombe families lived there in the 1930s. * A big sand and gravel quarry / brick works, east side * Heathrow Hall: west side, large farm, built late 18th century. Farm buildings area about 300 feet (E-W) by 350 feet (N-S). Square of large Dutch barns (in the British sense) round a yard with another large barn in the middle; other buildings to north and west; farmhouse at north end, facing a bit south of eastwards, about 40 feet N-S by about 50 feet E-W, had two pitched roofs E-W with a valley between, two bay windows at front. A big Lebanon Cedar in its front lawn. Farmyard gate about 130 feet south of farmhouse gate, both onto Heathrow Road, which had a sharp bend (35¬∞ eastwards) at the house gate. * Palmer's Farm: west side, built early 17th century. (Opposite it was an entrance of the brick works.) Two (blocks of) buildings in L-shape, about 140 feet square. One gate on road. * Junction with Cain's Lane (named Wheatcut Corner) (and another entrance of the brick works) * A square area of land north of the airfield. Formerly belonged to Perrott's Farm. Then passed to the Tillyers, then to W & S Philp of Harlington; was orchard. In 1938 during the Munich Crisis the Wilds got this land and grubbed out the orchard and planted vegetables on the land. * Perrott's Farm: north side, half-timbered frontage; in 1819 owned by one Martha Parrott. Farm buildings area about 280 feet N-S, 210 feet E-W. Set about 150 feet back from road. Two drives to road. In its last years Heathrow Farm used its buildings. * Plough and Harrow pub, north side, in the 1930s run by Mr. Basham (an ex-policeman) * A small market garden house nearly opposite the Plough and Harrow, south side: John Dance lived there. * A market garden house, north side, George Dance and Sons lived there. * Heathrow Farm: north side, built in 16th century half-timbered, brick faced in 18th century. It grew vegetables and cereals. * Site of Lowe's Farm, which on 16 June 1930 became part of the Great West Aerodrome, south side * Junction with High Tree Lane * High Tree Farm: south side * About 4 groups of buildings, spaced out on the north side, including a timber-framed thatched Tudor house split into 2 residences; In later years these included the village shop, run by Mr. Field. A block of 8 small buildings on the south side. This reference includes a 1930s map of Heathrow (as its covers) and a 1915 map of Heathrow (as its centerfold), both about 6 inches / 1 mile, and the 1915 map shows much fewer buildings in this area. Image of timber-framed thatched cottage in Heathrow * Perry Oaks (Elizabethan): north side. It is mentioned (called 'Perry') in a rental dated 1337. Farm buildings area oval, about 460 feet SW-NE by 240 feet SE-NW. It had a gate onto Heathrow Road and a gate onto Tithe Barn Lane. =Cain's Lane= Starting at the north end: * Wild's farm: founded in 1928 when the Wild family moved there from Longford, London. It grew flowers and flower bedding plants until World War II started in 1939, then vegetables; at the changeover many tulip bulbs were fed to pigs. It had a line of greenhouses and packing shed etc. about 500 feet long SW-NE behind Croft House. Philip Sherwood worked there in his 1941 and 1942 summer school holidays. It had 2 farmhouses:  Shrub End: east side  Croft House: east side * Gamble's Farm: west side (buildings still shown on 1934 map, but from 4 Mar 1929 part of Fairey Aviation's Great West Aerodrome) * A small \\"tin tabernacle\\" church or chapel made of corrugated iron: east side, built in 1901 * East side, behind the chapel: Land farmed by Mr.Longhurst South of the airfield:- * Cain's Farm: west side. In 1819 land around there was assigned to Isaac Cane as freehold. In the early 1900s Charles Glenie lived there and he had a dairy herd of at least 20 cows. In the early 1930s Mrs.Waddell lived there. Farm buildings area about 150 feet SW-NE by 210 feet SW-NW, plus an area of small walled enclosures. * Heathrow House: east side: built in the 18th century. In 1839 it was owned by Richard Langslow, who lived here until the 1850s. His daughter married Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet, who lived in Temple Hatton, a house in Hatton, London. In 1872 a market gardener lived there, and thus likely then the house was being used as a farmhouse. Old 1:2500 scale Ordnance Survey maps, reproduced at about 15 inches = 1 mile, publ.

She and her husband, James Grant Speed (1906-1980) co-founded the Exmoor Pony Trekking Society at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies now part of the University of Edinburgh. Etherington was responsible for the breeding of Herd 2 Exmoors after they were left to her by her mother. Originally Herd 2 was bred by Mr F.G. Heal. He then left the ponies to Etherington's mother, who was the wife of the rector at Withypool. In 1943 the ponies were split between her two daughters, Mary and Joy, with Mary taking Herd 2 and Joy taking Herd 3. Immediately following World War II, the Exmoor pony population had dwindled to under fifty as hundreds of ponies had been shot by soldiers during the war and others had been stolen from fields and killed for food. Mary Etherington rallied breeders together to restore cattle grids and secure boundaries to the Commons in order to re-establish their herds, proclaiming in 1947, \\"The coming generations will have good reason to call us unfaithful stewards if when we are gone there are no little horses on the Exmoor hills.\\" In 1948, she also exhibited two Exmoor ponies at the London Zoo in order to raise awareness of the threats they faced. Etherington was consulted in government discussions on increasing the sheep and cattle population in Exmoor in 1949. That year, she left home and moved the herd around England searching for a permanent home for the ponies. She loaned a number of ponies to Maryon Wilson Park in Greenwich in 1950 which initiated its development into an animal park. In 1952, Etherington heard from a friend at the British Museum about a research project on native pony breeds at the University of Edinburgh led by James Grant Speed, a Professor of Anatomy at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. Etherington took her herd of twenty ponies on the train to Edinburgh and donated them to the veterinary school for conservation and research. She and Speed were married soon after. The ponies were used to set up the Exmoor Pony Trekking Society after the success of pony trekking in Newtonmore. The club intended that by taking the public out for treks, the breed would be publicized as useful horses and pay for their own keep. Mary Stone ran treks each summer from the Snoot Youth Hostel in Hawick. The treks continued from a number of locations around Edinburgh and now run from the Pentland Hills. When Mary and her husband decided to sell the Herd 2 Exmoor ponies, the students who had been running the treks formed a syndicate and in 1962 bought a core group of mares. These were bred as herd two until the last foal in 2009.

They were used for installing the large stone blocks used to build breakwaters, moles and stone piers. The mid-Victorian age was a time of great expansion in industry and shipping. Better protected harbours were needed, with man-made breakwaters extending beyond natural bays or coasts, in order to enclose safe harbours for the new generations of sailing ships and iron steamships being built. This time also coincided with the availability of large-scale ironworking with which to build cranes, and portable steam power with which to drive them. In contrast to the navvies who had built the earlier canals and the first railways mostly with human and animal muscle power, these new ports were built by powered engines as well.  Development  Stothert & Pitt Titan crane Block-setting cranes were required to lift a single large block in one lift, and to position it accurately. They also needed to reach a distance horizontally, but not to lift their loads high. Their working area was along the length of the breakwater, which had not yet been constructed at the time that most of the heavy masonry was put into place. Early breakwaters had been built from rubble or small boulders, dumped by hand from barges. Development in the mid-19th century of both powered lifting gear and Portland cement with which to cast large interlocking concrete blocks now involved the lifting of larger single blocks than could be moved by hand. A granite block weighs around 2 tons per cubic yard. Larger blocks were favoured as they required less masonry work to build with them and individual large blocks were more resistant to storm damage. Since the Eddystone Lighthouse of 1756, blocks had also been dovetailed together, to hold them more strongly and flexibly than with mortar. Assembling such blocks required a way of carefully positioning them, before sliding them downwards into place. Construction of the first courses of the Noordzeekanaal, 1869, with a fixed gantry crane built as wooden pilings The first cranes used for block-setting were floating cranes on barges. These could be moved around the job site easily and could carry powerful lifting gear. However they were unable to lift far from the gunwales of the vessel without risk of capsizing. To avoid this, they had to be anchored in position before each heavy lift, either by tying them down or by ballasting them to sit on the harbour bottom. This made their use very slow. In shallow water, a Goliath crane could be used. This is a gantry crane with no jib. A trolley runs across this gantry and can move side to side across the line of the breakwater, whilst carrying a load. It ran on baulks of timber laid temporarily on either side of the construction. Such cranes could lift a load of 40 tons, large for the time, and could also move such a load sideways. Railway-mounted cranes were already in use for railway construction and the recovery of railway accidents. However these were of limited capacity at this time: manually wound and with a capacity of only around 5 tons. They also required the lowering of screw jacks onto the rail heads before they could lift, which limited their ability to move a load. Most could not luff and when under load could only rotate at a fixed radius. = Parkes' Titan = 'Parkes' Titan' and the Manora breakwater, Karachi In 1869, Stothert and Pitt constructed their first dedicated block-setting crane, 'Parkes' Titan' for the Manora breakwater, Kurrachee harbour, This was to the design of William Parkes (1822-1889). The blocks to be set were cast of concrete, laid at angles against each other, and weighing around 27 tons each. The completed breakwater was to be 24 feet square in section, comprising three courses of blocks, laid on 9000 tons of rubble, dumped as a foundation. As was typical, this rubble foundation was left to settle over a winter's storms before block-laying commenced. The gantry of the crane spanned the width of the breakwater and the two railway lines upon it, with a projection over the end of the newly constructed breakwater. A horizontal gantry, crosswise to the breakwater could run up and down this, and a traveller upon that gantry could move from side to side. The projecting gantry of 23 feet allowed two courses of blocks to be laid before the whole crane had to be moved forwards. It was powered by an 8 hp steam engine, on top of the gantry which, together with its water tank, acted as a counterweight. Construction of the Noordzeekanaal with an early Parkes' type crane, c. 1871 In 1872 it was moved to Madras Although, like many Victorian cranes, named allegorically as a 'Titan', the design had more in common with the later 'Hercules' design than the later hammerhead 'Titan'. This may have been the first crane to be so named. = Moa = Jib cranes were rarely used for block setting as they had insufficient lifting capacity. One of the first to do so was Moa, used for construction of a breakwater at the new port of Oamaru, New Zealand in 1872. Weather conditions here in the Tasman Sea meant that there was no calm Summer season for building and so a crane was needed which could lift 40 tons, was rail-mounted to allow easy movement, and could also make heavy lifts whilst still 'F.O.R.' (free on rails), rather than having to be wheeled into place, then raised on rigid blocks before lifting. Although railway steam cranes were becoming common at this time, they had lifting capacities only half this and needed to be blocked up first. Owing to a lack of local stone, the breakwater was built from concrete blocks, cast on site, using cement brought from England. This breakwater work may also have been the site of the world's first concrete mixer. = Coode's crane for Port Alfred = Stothert & Pitt's 15 ton crane for the Port Alfred harbour works In 1881, Stothert and Pitt constructed a horizontal jib crane for Sir John Coode's harbour building work on the Kowie River at Port Alfred in South Africa. This was a rail-mounted steam crane, with a fixed horizontal jib carrying a movable trolley or 'crab'. The crane, including the steam plant, could slew on a central king post bearing. This represented all the main features of the fully developed block-setting crane, although at a small scale as yet. The fixed horizontal jib extended far enough to place the hook 45 feet from the king post, and the trolley could move 20 feet in from that position. This level carriage was copied from cranes already in use in foundries. Compared to a jib crane, this allowed blocks to be moved sideways precisely, without them also being moved up and down. The crane ran on a railway carriage of 15 feet gauge and could be powered by the crane's engine. When lifting, the rail carriage was wedged underneath to take the load. Slewing was possible all around the crane, which allowed a block to be picked up from a wagon behind the crane and moved to the front of the breakwater. The lift capacity was 15 tons, and there was enough wire rope to allow the hook to descend 26 feet below rail level. The crane was highly successful in use. The ability to move blocks rapidly from the wagons bringing them, and to put them in place accurately, was better than any other crane types yet used for this work. = Hercules = Douglas Harbour Breakwater In the mid-1880s, a further development of the crane design took place, the Hercules crane. A crane was needed which could set larger and heavier blocks, up to 30 tons. The Hercules design combined aspects of the Manora and the Port Alfred cranes. A horizontal jib was used, with the ability to slew sideways. As it was not possible to adapt the kingpost bearing and full-circle slewing of the Port Alfred crane to this new load, the design reverted to the Manora type where the lower frame of the crane allowed blocks to pass beneath it on wagons. The jib was now separate from the lower frame though, supported on two carriages which could move sideways, thus allowing the jib to slew over a small angle. For building linear breakwaters, this small slew angle was enough. Although the mechanical design of the jib was as a kingpost truss, this kingpost was now part of the jib and rotated with it, rather than fixed to the frame beneath it. The kingpost was also placed further outboard, at the edge of the large ring bearing, making the most of the truss' span for increasing the reach of the jib. Placing concrete blocks in the breakwater at IJmuiden Alexander Shanks's 30 ton Hercules crane for LiepƒÅja Early examples were built by Stothert & Pitt for the Breakwater Crane Railway, Douglas Harbour, Isle of Man and by Alexander Shanks & Son for LiepƒÅja in Latvia, then part of Russia, and a 50 ton crane for Roker Pier, Sunderland. At Roker, a second separate Goliath (gantry) crane was provided at the rail head, for loading the granite blocks from the railway to the tramway along the pier. = Titan = Small Titan or hammerhead crane The ultimate development of the dedicated block-setting crane was the hammerhead or 'giant cantilever' Titan crane. These had a deep double truss as a cantilever beam atop a large diameter roller bearing, on a carriage similar to that of the Hercules. The upper edges of the two trusses formed a set of rails for a moveable trolley carrying the lifting cable sheaves and hook. The cantilever also extended behind the bearing, carrying the winch engine and also acting as a counterweight. Some also winched this counterpoise weight back and forth as the lifting trolley racked back and forth, in order to balance the changing moment of the load at each radius. The term 'Titan' had been applied to a number of earlier large cranes. Parkes' Titan at Manora was one of the first, although was missing an important feature. Some of the Hercules type cranes, with a cable-stayed jib supported by a kingpost, were termed 'Titans', if they were capable of slewing in a full circle. William Arrol built 14 of these large Titan cranes, several of them as block-setters and the rest as shipyard cranes. ; Arrol cranes * Dockyard :* Titan Clydebank, completed in 1907 :* Titan Crane, Fairfield, completed in 1911 :* Titan Crane, James Watt Dock Crane, completed in 1917 :* Titan Crane, Barclay Curle, completed in 1920 :* Garden Island, Sydney, Australia * Blocksetter :* Travelling Titan (South African Harbours and Railways); for use at Durban, completed prior to 1932 :* Travelling Hercules (South African Harbours and Railways); for use at Table Bay, completed prior to 1932 :* Travelling Hercules; for use at Ceuta, completed prior to 1932 :* Portland Breakwater, Dorset The following diesel crane was actually built by Skoda in 1931. :* Comodoro Rivadavia pier, Argentina = Later jib cranes = An electric port crane by in Maputo, used for breakwater construction. Note the interlocking pre-cast concrete blocks. By the 1920s, port cranes had developed to become much more powerful - particularly when electrically driven, for which Stothert & Pitt were again leaders. A port crane is required to make many lifts, as fast as possible, and so requires powerful motors even if their lifting capacity is not so great. Electric cranes, supplied by electricity from a single centralised generating station or prime mover, could offer a lot of power per crane, without requiring the high cost of an equivalent steam plant on each crane. Port cranes were almost all luffing jib cranes, often with a long reach. Their lifting capacity depended on how far they were reaching. Although not intended for lifting heavy loads, when the jib was raised high and the crane worked at a short radius, their capacity could become comparable to a block-setting crane. When an existing harbour was to be extended or maintained, it was now possible to use one of the existing port cranes for this work. This only required new lines to be laid along the breakwater and a longer cable supplied to power one of the existing cranes, moved into position for this work. Obviously this was far cheaper than obtaining another specialist crane just for this work.  Working life  In their heyday, block-setting cranes were sold on from completed sites and used elsewhere. Two cranes returned to the UK for further use; a S&P; Titan of 1900 for Seaham went on to Malta and thence to the Proof Testing Establishment at Shoeburyness in 1921; and a S&P; Titan of 1901 from Simonstown went to Aberdeen in 1937. They were dismantled for shipping and might even be designed to make this simpler, with bolted joints to break the crane down into components, each of which was permanently assembled by rivetting. Some cranes were only partly re- used, the more complicated and expensive parts also being the most compact. The steam plant and moving parts could be removed and re-used, whilst the large but relatively framework was scrapped in situ and a new one built for the new site. A single crane might construct several breakwaters in its working life. In later years, such cranes were in less demand and so the crane might be left in place, and available in the future for any maintenance work needed. = Tynemouth Pier = As an example, Tynemouth Pier had three cranes permanently in place at various times. The two breakwaters were constructed under the supervision of P. J. Messent (1830-1897) \\"the maker of the Tyne River\\". The first crane was used to rebuild the North pier and breakwater in 1909 and remained in service afterwards until 1931. The next crane was a steam-powered Titan hammerhead, which lasted to the late 1960s. The breakwater here also formed a pier on its landward side. Although not used for commercial cargoes, it was sometimes used for ship repair, such as lifting engines in and out. It was replaced by a more modern electric crane after this, which lasted into the 1990s.  Models  = Meccano = The Meccano Giant Block-Setting Crane Cranes have always been a popular subject for Meccano models and large Titan cranes in particular. They have appeared in instruction guides, as shop display models, and as one-off constructions by dedicated Meccanistes.  N¬∫ 4 Super Models  The instructions of ' Meccano Super Models No. 4.' were for a 'Giant Block-Setting Crane'. These instructions were printed in 1929, firstly across three issues of the Meccano Magazine. They were then reprinted in booklet form. This model required the resources of the largest Meccano set, the wooden-cased No 10 set, and so few Meccano modellers would have had the resources to build it. Even with that set, it required an additional component ‚Äì the part 167 Geared Roller Bearing. This model remains a popular goal for large Meccano builders.  Illustration  The block-setting crane model was such an icon of Meccano that it was used as cover art for several publications: the 1930 Book of New Models, the 1947 No 3 set, and the post-war revised No 7 & 8 sets. This was despite none of these sets containing enough parts, or the roller bearing, with which to build it.

These effects are useful for policy analysis but complicate the statistical analysis of experiments. Analysis of spillover effects involve relaxing the non-interference assumption, or SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption). This assumption requires that subject i's revelation of its potential outcomes depends only on that subject i's own treatment status, and is unaffected by another subject j's treatment status. In ordinary settings where the researcher seeks to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (\\\\widehat{ATE}), violation of the non-interference assumption means that traditional estimators for the ATE, such as difference-in-means, may be biased. However, there are many real-world instances where a unit's revelation of potential outcomes depend on another unit's treatment assignment, and analyzing these effects may be just as important as analyzing the direct effect of treatment. One solution to this problem is to redefine the causal estimand of interest by redefining a subject's potential outcomes in terms of one's own treatment status and related subjects' treatment status. The researcher can then analyze various estimands of interest separately. One important assumption here is that this process captures all patterns of spillovers, and that there are no unmodeled spillovers remaining (ex. spillovers occur within a two-person household but not beyond). Once the potential outcomes are redefined, the rest of the statistical analysis involves modeling the probabilities of being exposed to treatment given some schedule of treatment assignment, and using inverse probability weighting (IPW) to produce unbiased (or asymptotically unbiased) estimates of the estimand of interest.  Examples of spillover effects  Spillover effects can occur in a variety of different ways. Common applications include the analysis of social network spillovers and geographic spillovers. Examples include the following: * Communication: An intervention that conveys information about a technology or product can influence the take-up decisions of others in their network if it diffuses beyond the initial user. * Competition: Job placement assistance for young job seekers may influence the job market prospects of individuals who did not receive the training but are competing for the same jobs. * Contagion: Receiving deworming drugs can decrease other's likelihood of contracting the disease. * Deterrence: Information about government audits in specific municipalities can spread to nearby municipalities. * Displacement: A hotspot policing intervention that increases policing presence on a given street can lead to the displacement of crime onto nearby untreated streets. *Reallocation of Resources: A hotspot policing intervention that increases policing presence on a given street can decrease police presence on nearby streets. * Social comparison: A program that randomizes individuals to receive a voucher to move to a new neighborhood can additionally influence the control group's beliefs about their housing conditions. In such examples, treatment in a randomized-control trial can have a direct effect on those who receive the intervention and also a spillover effect on those who were not directly treated. This article outlines statistical issues that complicate the analysis of experiments intended to measure spillover effects.  Statistical issues  Estimating spillover effects in experiments introduces three statistical issues that researchers must take into account. = Relaxing the non-interference assumption = One key assumption for unbiased inference is the non-interference assumption, which posits that an individual's potential outcomes are only revealed by their own treatment assignment and not the treatment assignment of others. This assumption has also been called the Individualistic Treatment Response or the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption. Non-interference is violated when subjects can communicate with each other about their treatments, decisions, or experiences, thereby influencing each other's potential outcomes. If the non- interference assumption does not hold, units no longer have just two potential outcomes (treated and control), but a variety of other potential outcomes that depend on other units‚Äô treatment assignments, which complicates the estimation of the average treatment effect. Estimating spillover effects requires relaxing the non-interference assumption. This is because a unit's outcomes depend not only on its treatment assignment but also on the treatment assignment of its neighbors. The researcher must posit a set of potential outcomes that limit the type of interference. As an example, consider an experiment that sends out political information to undergraduate students to increase their political participation. If the study population consists of all students living with a roommate in a college dormitory, one can imagine four sets of potential outcomes, depending on whether the student or their partner received the information (assume no spillover outside of each two- person room): * Y0,0 refers to an individual's potential outcomes when they are not treated (0) and neither was their roommate (0). * Y0,1 refers to an individual's potential outcome when they are not treated (0) but their roommate was treated (1). * Y1,0 refers to an individual's potential outcome when they are treated (1) but their roommate was not treated (0). * Y1,1 refers to an individual's potential outcome when they are treated (1) and their roommate was treated (1). Now an individual's outcomes are influenced by both whether they received the treatment and whether their roommate received the treatment. We can estimate one type of spillover effect by looking at how one's outcomes change depending on whether their roommate received the treatment or not, given the individual did not receive treatment directly. This would be captured by the difference Y0,1 Y0,0. Similarly, we can measure how ones‚Äô outcomes change depending on their roommate's treatment status, when the individual themselves are treated. This amounts to taking the difference Y1,1 Y1,0. While researchers typically embrace experiments because they require less demanding assumptions, spillovers can be ‚Äúunlimited in extent and impossible to specify in form.‚Äù The researcher must make specific assumptions about which types of spillovers are operative. One can relax the non-interference assumption in various ways depending on how spillovers are thought to occur in a given setting. One way to model spillover effects is a binary indicator for whether an immediate neighbor was also treated, as in the example above. One can also posit spillover effects that depend on the number of immediate neighbors that were also treated, also known as k-level effects.  Exposure Mappings  Converting Networks into an Adjacency Matrix The next step after redefining the causal estimand of interest is to characterize the probability of spillover exposure for each subject in the analysis, given some vector of treatment assignment. Aronow and Samii (2017) present a method for obtaining a matrix of exposure probabilities for each unit in the analysis. First, define a diagonal matrix with a vector of treatment assignment probabilities \\\\mathbf { P } = \\\\operatorname { diag } \\\\left( p _ { \\\\mathbf { z } _ { 1 } } , p _ { \\\\mathbf { z } _ { 2 } } , \\\\dots , p _ { \\\\mathbf { z } _ {  \\\\Omega  } } \\\\right). Second, define an indicator matrix \\\\mathbf{I} of whether the unit is exposed to spillover or not. This is done by using an adjacency matrix as shown on the right, where information regarding a network can be transformed into an indicator matrix. This resulting indicator matrix will contain values of d_k, the realized values of a random binary variable D _ { i } = f \\\\left( \\\\mathbf { Z } , \\\\theta _ { i } \\\\right), indicating whether that unit has been exposed to spillover or not. Third, obtain the sandwich product \\\\mathbf { I } _ { k } \\\\mathbf { P } \\\\mathbf { I } _ { k } ^ { \\\\prime }, an N x N matrix which contains two elements: the individual probability of exposure \\\\pi _ { i } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right)on the diagonal, and the joint exposure probabilities \\\\pi _ { i j } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right)on the off diagonals: \\\\mathbf { I } _ { k } \\\\mathbf { P } \\\\mathbf { I } _ { k } ^ { \\\\prime } = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array} { c c c c } { \\\\pi _ { 1 } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right) } & { \\\\pi _ { 12 } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right) } & { \\\\dots } & { \\\\pi _ { 1 N } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right) } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { \\\\pi _ { 21 } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right) } & { \\\\pi _ { 2 } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right) } & { \\\\cdots } & { \\\\pi _ { 2 N } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right) } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { \\\\vdots } & { \\\\vdots } & { \\\\ddots } & { } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { \\\\pi _ { N 1 } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right) } & { \\\\pi _ { N 2 } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right) } & { } & { \\\\pi _ { N } \\\\left( d _ { k } \\\\right) } \\\\end{array} \\\\right]In a similar fashion, the joint probability of exposure of i being in exposure condition d_k and j being in a different exposure condition d_lcan be obtained by calculating \\\\mathbf { I } _ { k } \\\\mathbf { P } \\\\mathbf { I } _ { l } ^ { \\\\prime }: \\\\mathbf { I } _ { k } \\\\mathbf { P } \\\\mathbf { I } _ { l } ^ { \\\\prime } = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array} { c c c c } { 0 } & { \\\\pi _ { 12 } \\\\left( d _ { k } , d _ { l } \\\\right) } & { \\\\dots } & { \\\\pi _ { 1 N } \\\\left( d _ { k } , d _ { l } \\\\right) } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { \\\\pi _ { 21 } \\\\left( d _ { k } , d _ { l } \\\\right) } & { 0 } & { \\\\ldots } & { \\\\pi _ { 2 N } \\\\left( d _ { k } , d _ { l } \\\\right) } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { \\\\vdots } & { \\\\vdots } & { \\\\ddots } & { } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { \\\\pi _ { N 1 } \\\\left( d _ { k } , d _ { l } \\\\right) } & { \\\\pi _ { N 2 } \\\\left( d _ { k } , d _ { l } \\\\right) } & { 0 } \\\\end{array} \\\\right]Notice that the diagonals on the second matrix are 0 because a subject cannot be simultaneously exposed to two different exposure conditions at once, in the same way that a subject cannot reveal two different potential outcomes at once. The obtained exposure probabilities \\\\pithen can be used for inverse probability weighting (IPW, described below), in an estimator such as the Horvitz-Thompson Estimator. One important caveat is that this procedure excludes all units whose probability of exposure is zero (ex. a unit that is not connected to any other units), since these numbers end up in the denominator of the IPW regression. = Need for Inverse Probability Weights = 430x430px Estimating spillover effects requires additional care: although treatment is directly assigned, spillover status is indirectly assigned and can lead to differential probabilities of spillover assignment for units. For example, a subject with 10 friend connections is more likely to be indirectly exposed to treatment as opposed to a subject with just one friend connection. Not accounting for varying probabilities of spillover exposure can bias estimates of the average spillover effect. Figure 1 displays an example where units have varying probabilities of being assigned to the spillover condition. Subfigure A displays a network of 25 nodes where the units in green are eligible to receive treatment. Spillovers are defined as sharing at least one edge with a treated unit. For example, if node 16 is treated, nodes 11, 17, and 21 would be classified as spillover units. Suppose three of these six green units are selected randomly to be treated, so that \\\\binom{6}{3}=20 different sets of treatment assignments are possible. In this case, subfigure B displays each node's probability of being assigned to the spillover condition. Node 3 is assigned to spillover in 95% of the randomizations because it shares edges with three units that are treated. This node will only be a control node in 5% of randomizations: that is, when the three treated nodes are 14, 16, and 18. Meanwhile, node 15 is assigned to spillover only 50% of the time‚Äîif node 14 is not directly treated, node 15 will not be assigned to spillover.  Using Inverse Probability Weights  When analyzing experiments with varying probabilities of assignment, special precautions should be taken. These differences in assignment probabilities may be neutralized by inverse- probability-weighted (IPW) regression, where each observation is weighted by the inverse of its likelihood of being assigned to the treatment condition observed using the Horvitz-Thompson estimator. This approach addresses the bias that might arise if potential outcomes were systematically related to assignment probabilities. The downside of this estimator is that it may be fraught with sampling variability if some observations are accorded a high amount of weight (i.e. a unit with a low probability of being spillover is assigned to the spillover condition by chance). = Using randomization inference for hypothesis testing = In some settings, estimating the variability of a spillover effect creates additional difficulty. When the research study has a fixed unit of clustering, such as a school or household, researchers can use traditional standard error adjustment tools like cluster- robust standard errors, which allow for correlations in error terms within clusters but not across them. In other settings, however, there is no fixed unit of clustering. In order to conduct hypothesis testing in these settings, the use of randomization inference is recommended. This technique allows one to generate p-values and confidence intervals even when spillovers do not adhere to a fixed unit of clustering but nearby units tend to be assigned to similar spillover conditions, as in the case of fuzzy clustering.

His work led to the conviction that, rather than trailing Europe and Asia, Southern Africa's Stone Age technology and culture had set the pace.  Education and career Beaumont matriculated at Rondebosch Boys' High School before studying archaeology at the University of Cape Town under Astley John Hilary Goodwin (1900-59), graduating with a B.Sc. in 1956 having taken geology as a major. His first appointment was that of Research Officer (1958-64) at the Archaeological Research Unit at the University of the Witwatersrand and after that under Raymond Dart of the Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research (1965-77). Finally he became Head of Archaeology (1978-2000) at the McGregor Museum in Kimberley, Northern Cape. His name is associated with, among others, Border Cave, Wonderwerk Cave, Kathu and Canteen Kopje, all highly significant sites in determining a new Southern African chronology of hominins. Border Cave was also the focus of Beaumont's dissertation which led to an M.Sc. with distinction in 1978. In the 1960s Beaumont, while working under Dart, investigated the haematite mining activities at Bomvu Ridge in Swaziland. He determined that mining for the pigment specularite or specular hematite, pre-dated mining for ore, and extended back into the Middle Stone Age. Work by the field team uncovered an adit in the hematite excavated to gain access to a lode of specularite. The site of Lion Cavern within the Bomvu Ridge site yielded more than 30 000 artefacts in rubble older than 41 000 years. Returning in 1971 from a season of fieldwork at Border Cave, Beaumont prepared to challenge the then prevailing view that modern humans had an Asian origin. In an article published by the Rand Daily Mail he stated his conviction that Africa would eventually prove to be the \\"source of modern man's beginning\\". Finds which he had made at Border Cave when subjected to radiocarbon dating by John Vogel would support his views. Beaumont and Vogel's articles appeared in African Studies and Nature in 1972. The articles included a comprehensive and formal tabulation of radiocarbon dates available at that time. Beaumont & Vogel's dates were corroborated by a team led by Paolo Villa and Francesco d'Errico. Their findings were published in the journal of PNAS in 2012 with Beaumont as co-author. Beaumont lived during a period when archaeology was turning into a multi-disciplinary science, and utilising the expertise of palynologists, sedimentologists and radiometric dating specialists became part of his own set of skills. In 1978 he also relocated to Kimberley and the rich archaeology of the Northern Cape. His earlier interest in ancient mining at Bomvu Ridge had first brought him to the region where he examined ancient ochre mines near Postmasburg. Once settled at the McGregor Museum he started a number of excavation projects at Wonderwerk Cave, Kathu, the ancient hyaena maternity den at Equus Cave near Taung, and sites along the Vaal River which included Pniel, and Canteen Kopje near Barkly West. Beaumont's views on the status and dating of the Stone Age in Southern Africa ran counter to the prevailing views, and, until incontrovertible evidence had been produced, led to a marked split in the ranks of archaeology. He was elected president of the South African Society for Quaternary Research in 1995, and vice-president of the International Union for Quaternary Research Congress hosted by South Africa in 1999. Personal life Peter Beaumont was married to Mavis, the union producing two children, Bruce and Megan. Mavis, who predeceased her husband, shunned public appearances and was known only to family and close friends. He has two brothers.

He made iconostasis for the churches of Baƒçka and Syrmia regions and also some portraits. He is the nephew of the painter, engraver and writer Zaharije Orfelin. Biography Jakov Orfelin received his first artistic education from his uncle Zaharije Orfelin, with whom he collaborated on church commissions later. In 1766, he pursued his art studies in Vienna at the Art Academy and took courses at the newly-founded engraving academy directed by Jakob Matthias Schmutzer (1733-1811). One of his earliest work was the iconostasis in Grgeteg Monastery (1774) which was in 1902 replaced with the iconostasis done by Uro≈° Prediƒá. In 1780-1781, he collaborated with Teodor Kraƒçun in the iconostasis painting of the St. Nicholas Cathedral of Sremski Karlovci, considered by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts to be \\"a summit of Baroque painting in Vojvodina\\".Also, Orfelin painted the iconostasis in Deliblato, Stapar (1790), Parabuƒá (now Ratkovo), Veliki Radinci, Kraljevci, and with Stefan Gavriloviƒá the iconostasis in the village of Jarak. His last work, the iconostasis for the church of Bezdin Monastery, was completed in 1802. Among the portraits, the most important is the portrait of Metropolitan Stefan Stratimiroviƒá (now in the National Museum in Sremski Karlovci). Jakov Orfelin also did copper engravings. He did the figures of Nemanjiƒá family and other Serbian rulers for Rajiƒá's history illustrations. The figures of saints painted by Orfelin usually have large heads and stocky bodies. Sometimes he painted in the rococo style, using pinkish colors for the garments of saints, for example in the style of the Passion of Christ in Sremski Karlovci. However, his throne icons are based on Byzantine traditions in painting.

The Begleitpanzer (Escort Tank 57) AIFSV (Armored Infantry Fire Support Vehicle) was a project of the companies Thyssen-Henschel and Bofors. Only a single prototype was built. In the mid-1970s, the two then-existing companies Thyssen-Henschel and Bofors began without government a mandate with the development of an infantry escort tank, as they believed to have discovered a gap in a light fire support platform. The vehicle was first introduced in November 1977. However, due to lack of interest from potential buyers, the project was not pursued.  Description  The modified hull of the armored personnel carrier Marder was used as chassis. Here all the components of the infantry fight, such as bullet covers, rear MG, tailgate and hatchways of the crew compartment had been removed to accommodate the much larger turret and associated equipment. The asymmetrically shaped turret had a recess in the middle in the longitudinal direction, in which the external, crest-fixed pipe cradle was mounted. In the direction of travel left was on the turret ceiling, the hatch of the commander with angle mirrors and stabilized round periscope. On the right side of the turret, which resembled the Marder Turret, was a launching device for TOW antitank missiles, including the gunner's hatch. This operated with a telescope with night vision thermal imaging system, a laser rangefinder and tracked control system for the missiles. For the commander, there was a monitor with parallel information. The cannon moved in the elevation range from -8 ¬∞ to + 45 ¬∞ The vehicle led an ammunition supply of 48 cartridges 57 mm ammunition and six anti-tank guided missiles with it.

He was sentenced for murdering three people, in addition to being suspected of four other murders. Nestor Pirotte, \\"The Public Enemy Number 1\\" who made Belgium tremble on ViaLibre5.  Youth  The son of a chatelain's gamekeeper in the Ch√¢teau de Beau Ch√™ne estate in the Moligne√© valley and a seamstress, Nestor and his brother Anthony played with the children of aristocrats since they were little. Often boasting about being the child of a lord, he not only vocabularily but also physically engaged in high-society activities, which would later drive him to commit his crimes.Nestor Pirotte, the false aristocrat on Le Figaro It was during his military service that he began to conquer with his talk on his aristocratic origins. He invented himself a world, stating that he had begun stealing from his comrades at a very young age and looted coffers around the city. He was condemned for the first time at the age of 20, and was sentenced to a 3-month suspended sentence.Nestor Pirotte, false Belgian aristocrat who escaped the death penalty...twice! on France Info, July 30, 2012  Crimes  Pirotte's bloody journey began on April 20, 1954, when he learned that one of his great-aunts, Celina Debonny, had just sold some cattle. He proceeded to smash her skull with an iron bar near Durbuy, but the coveted money had already been spent. He was condemned according to military justice law for this crime, and on June 11, 1955 he was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Pretending to be a madman so he could be interned, Pirotte was sent to a specialized psychiatric facility. On March 23, 1968, after 13 years of incarceration, he was released on parole, shortly resuming his murders afterwards. On May 14, just a few weeks after his release, Pirotte went to a financial institution, where he pretended to be the Count of Ribaucourt. Under the pretext of wanting to negotiate a major deal discreetly, he asked to consult with the manager of the bank in Genval, Mr. Delisse, whom he shot in the head. Quickly identified, Pirotte was arrested on May 21 of the same year and was sent to prison, where he feigned a suicide attempt by throwing himself a wall six meters high. This suicide attempt was only the first attempt of escape by Pirotte. He was transferred to the Establishment of Social Defense Tournai in 1970 and, after 10 years, was considered suitable to be reintegrated into society, was released and found a job in a broadcasting store on Spintay Street in Verviers. Pirotte became a suspect in 1980, when the gendarmes discovered the lifeless bodies of Madeleine Humbert, her two employees and the dog in the restaurant \\"La Vieille France\\" in Spa on December 11. A manager in home appliances, Pirotte was a supplier of Humbert and a regular on the premises. The police found the name of the last customer on the slate of the restaurant: \\"Nestor\\". Pirotte was immediately suspected, since the owner's son had also disappeared. Although the lifeless body of the young man was found in January 1981, the killing remained a mystery to the police. However, Pirotte was soon arrested in Brussels for failing to comply with all the conditions of his parole. Once again imprisoned, he escaped on the night between August 2 to 3, and panic settled in Belgium when the news was broadcast to the public. Faithful to his habits, Pirotte killed again on September 18 while pretending to be the Count of Mee√ªs d'Argenteuil, who sought to sell the furniture of his castle. His victim being a Brussels antique dealer. Only after a while did Commissioner Fr√©d√©ric Godfroid of the Brussels Police arrest Pirotte, who was sentenced to death in 1984. Faithful to his habits once again, Pirotte tried to escape in 1992, but failed. After nearly 40 years behind bars, Nestor Pirotte was feared by other prisoners and remained until his death the most formidable \\"Public Enemy Number 1 in Belgium\\".  Death  Nestor Pirotte died from a heart attack on July 29, 2000. Having received no visits from his family since 1980, it was unsurprising that only one woman he had known from his youth attended the funeral. He was buried in the Ham-sur-Heure cemetery in an unmarked grave. Ashamed, all members of his family left the country. Although dead, he is often regarded as the first Belgian serial killer, to date only surpassed by pedophile Marc Dutroux in terms of instilling fear on the population.

If the lessee is enfranchised, that is, gets absolute and perpetual possession of the property, the landlord will lose the reversion value. The Leasehold Reform Act 1967 (houses) and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (for flats) aim to ensure that the landlord has fair compensation for this loss of value.Unless tenants have security of tenure at the end of the lease under schedule 10 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Computing the amount of compensation requires estimating the value of deferred possession of the property ‚Äì the value of the property now minus the lost income or use for the period of the lease ('jam today is worth more than jam tomorrow'). The value of deferred possession is given by the deferment rate, or the rate of return that the lessor would have received, net of management, void and maintenance costs, over the period of the lease. Lessees will typically want a high deferment rate, lessors will typically want a low deferment rate.  Sportelli method  Following the Sportelli caseCadogan v Sportelli and others [2007] 1 EGLR 153 the Lands Tribunal adopted the so-called Sportelli formula to determine the rate, as follows. :q = r* + P ‚Äì g* Where q is the deferment rate,'q' is the term used for stock dividend yield, introduced by John C. Hull in \\"Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\\"http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/ofod/, but is used in property valuation to represent net rental yield r* the real risk free rate, P the risk premium for the residential property market, and g* the real long-term growth in house prices.http://www.cluttons.com/gb/leasehold- enfranchisement/deferment-rates-enfranchisement-valuations  Hedonic regression method  An alternative to the Sportelli method was proposed by Bracke et al in October 2016.Philippe Bracke, Edward W Pinchbeck and James Wyatt, ' The time value of housing: historical evidence on discount rates', Bank of England Staff Working Paper No. 621, 2016. The authors collected market data for leases in the period 1987 to 1991, aiming to isolate the effect on value of the unexpired length of the lease in each such case by the statistical method known as hedonic regression.

These defects are common in DiGeorge syndrome and include interrupted aortic arch and LVOT obstruction (IAA/LVOTO); aortic atresia-severe stenosis with ventricular septal defect (AA/VSD); and aortic atresia with interrupted aortic arch and aortopulmonary window. This procedure allows the surgeon to keep the left ventricle connected to the systemic circulation while using the pulmonary valve as its outflow valve, by connecting them through the ventricular septal defect. The Yasui procedure includes a modified Damus‚ÄìKaye‚ÄìStansel procedure to connect the aortic and pulmonary roots, allowing the coronary arteries to remain perfused. It was first described in 1987.  Indications  A Yasui procedure can be done instead of a Norwood operation in some cases of LVOT obstruction to avoid committing a child to a single-ventricle heart, or it can follow a Norwood operation when the surgeon uses a staged approach. It is also used when the Ross procedure or Konno procedure are not feasible in children who have had other surgeries to repair coarctation of the aorta or interrupted aortic arch.  Technique  The Yasui procedure is done via a median sternotomy and uses cardiopulmonary bypass. If there is a patent ductus arterosus, the surgeon begins by closing it. The surgeon then connects the separated parts of the aorta together. The surgeon then transects the pulmonary artery and aorta and frees them from surrounding tissue, then makes an incision into the right ventricle to allow them to assess the ventricular septal defect and remove excess muscle bundles in cases of extensive right ventricular hypertrophy. If the ventricular septal defect is smaller than the pulmonary valve, the surgeon will enlarge the defect. The surgeon then uses a patch, commonly made of bovine (cow) pericardium or the child's own tissue, to create a tunnel between the ventricular septal defect and the pulmonary valve. This allows for blood to flow from the left ventricle to the pulmonary valve. After creating this tunnel, the surgeon connects the aortic and pulmonary roots (Damus-Kaye- Stansel anastomosis).  Outcomes  Children typically have good cardiac function and survival after the Yasui procedure, similar to other operations for the same conditions. However, children may require re-operation to replace the conduit in their heart if they outgrow it. Long-term survival depends on other factors, such as genetic disease.

Plot The game's plot takes inspiration from the 1979 movie The 36th Chamber of Shaolin. Hang Foy Qua, the protagonist of the game, traveled from his hometown of Queping, to the monastery of Shaolin in Tibet in order to train under the temple. Hang's younger sister has been kidnapped by the emperor. By conquering the trials and facing other fighters, we are helping Hang become a fighting master and save his sister from a tyrannical government. Gameplay The game offers two distinct styles of gameplay. Initially, the player must clear six tests that showcase the player's skill in combat disciplines, specifically Agility, Balance, Fire, Speed, Stick, and Strength. Clearing said trials requires reacting to (dodging) obstacles thrown at the player, such as dodging projectiles in the Agility and Stick tests, and hitting buttons with the correct timing as in the Balance and Fire tests. Upon clearing said tests, the player will be offered the chance to clear rounds of 1-on-1 fights with other Shaolin fighters. Performance in the previous trials impacts the player's skillset and strengths against other fighters. Reception Overall, reception for the game was positive, praising its gameplay and handling. The title was specifically of note being the first game released by Thalion Software, signifying a welcome addition to the developer in the video game marketplace. Contemporary reviews for the game state that while it was graphically unimpressive, the gameplay and controls were surprisingly sharp for the time.

She married Paul Woodman and had six children with him; he died in 1930, and she married James Rowland Angell, President of Yale University, two years later. James died in 1949, 17 years after their marriage. She chaired the Consumer Division of the State Defense Committee in World War II, and her eldest son died near the end of the war.  Career  In 1946, Angell and Frances Roth, along with the New Haven Restaurant Association, helped found the New Haven Restaurant Institute. The school was later renamed the Culinary Institute of America. Angell regarded the school as a memorial to her dead son. Since the institute was accredited, students qualified for G.I. Bill payments, and Angell created a loan fund for students whose payments were late. She used her own money to help the institute and raised money for it. When the institute purchased a mansion in September 1947 for $75,000 to allow expansion of the school, she guaranteed the loan. She convinced the union of dining hall workers at Yale to allow the school to make meals for Yale athletes. From 1948 until her retirement in 1966, she chaired the board of the institute. In 1972 she was honoured with the Yale Medal. Until her death she remained working with the Culinary Institute.

She was awarded a graduate fellowship at Howard Hughes Medical Institute and completed her postdoctoral work at the University of California, San Francisco. Research interests Murphy's lab at Princeton focuses on identifying transcriptional targets related to longevity, using the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model. Early in her career, Murphy and her postdoctoral mentor Cynthia Kenyon determined that by deactivating one C. elegans gene, called \\"daf-2\\", the worms' life expectancy doubled and they expressed a delayed senescence, showing marked behavioral improvements in long-term memory, working memory, and navigational capabilities as compared to the control. The specific longevity genes she is interested in relate to communication between different types of tissue. Once these genetic pathways in different tissue types are identified, they can be monitored in vitro in C. elegans. Since many of the genetic pathways in C. elegans are comparable to those in other organisms, including a 40% overlap with the human genome, Murphy's work is providing a better understanding of how genes related to longevity in humans express themselves, and how the breakdown of communication pathways between tissues during aging occurs. Murphy's lab developed a new suite of techniques that allow for localized tissue sampling, allowing research into these differentiated signal pathways in various tissue types within the same organism to take place. Based on the success of her early work, the National Institutes of Health awarded Murphy a NIH Pioneer Award in 2015.

In years following Citizens United v. FEC there has been a rise in outside special interest groups spending money on political campaigns in the United States.  Dark money  Shadow campaigns run on dark money, or money that is spent by an undisclosed donor that is intended to influence a given constituencies voting patterns. Dark money is often spent by non-profit organizations and super- PACs.  Types of outside interest groups  = Political non-profit organizations = Initially, non-profit organizations were limited in their abilities to contribute to political activities in The United States. Slowly, these organizations have risen to prominence in terms of campaign fundraising and spending in American elections. In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Supreme Court of the United States determined that these outside groups could spend money independently on issue ads that do not contain any expressed advocacy for a candidate or party. Additionally, they could make independent expenditures so long as that expenditure was done with \\"hard money\\" that was regulated by and disclosed to the Federal Election Commission. There are several types of political non-profit organizations, including 501(c)(4)s (social welfare organizations), 501(c)(5)s (labor unions), and 501(c)(6)s (business and trade organizations). The rise of 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations forced the courts to change how they viewed non-profit organizations. In FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life (1986), the Supreme Court recognized that non-profits serve different functions and should be treated differently. The Court ruled that the group (Massachusetts Citizens for Life) had violated the Federal Election Campaign Act by dispersing political propaganda using funds from its general treasury. But, the Court reasoned that, if social welfare groups have a predominantly political purpose and take the entirety of their donations from citizens, then the revenue generated reflects public opinion; so long as groups do not engage in any business-like activity, preventing them from spending money for political purposes this would be a first amendment violation. As a result of FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, a new type of company, the Qualified Non- Profit Corporation (QNC), was born. This would be the standard until the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (2002). The BCRA had provisions that specifically targeted non-profit organizations, disallowing them from purchasing ads aimed at a specific constituency with the intent to persuade. This would soon be challenged in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (2007) where it was found that Congress could only regulate expressed advocacy. This set up the landmark case Citizens United v. FEC (2010). The Citizens United ruling essentially equated money spent with speech, treating these groups like individuals. The Supreme Court help that limiting money spent by an interest group is equivocal to limiting the voice of an individual. As a result, organizations that had a \\"primary purpose\\" unrelated to politics could endorse candidates, organize partisan activities, and purchase advertising, all with funds from their general treasury. As long as they followed the \\"primary purpose rule\\" they are not legally obligated to disclose their donors. Hence the term, dark money. Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission = Super-PACs = A new type of committee has emerged in recent times known as a \\"Super\\" Political Action Committee. Super-PACs were created in the aftermath of Speechnow.org v. FEC. SpeechNow was an unincorporated, non-profit 527 political interest group. Their sole purpose was to pool funds to partake in independent expenditures expressly advocating in elections. The Supreme Court of the United States found that since the group was a citizen group with the sole goal of pursuing political activity, and further was not incorporated and therefore not barred from expenditures, they should not be limited in their contributions. The idea being that since their sole purpose was to engage in independent expenditures, there was no reason to believe there is a threat of corruption so long as their expenditures remain separate from the candidates, committees, and parties. Additionally, the rules of independent expenditures still apply, so they must fully disclose what they spend their money on as well as who their donors are. The United States government had no intentions of limiting donations to citizen movements, just campaigns subject to corruption. Super-PACs, as they would come to be called, began to pop up everywhere. Free to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, super-PACs dominate election spending in the United States. These independent expenditure-only committees, raise money from corporations, unions, and individuals with free rein to express advocacy as they choose. Unlike a regular Political Action Committee (PAC), these groups cannot donate to campaigns. Even talking to these campaigns is considered illegal through the United States laws on coordination. Super-PACs typically operate legally, however, there are instances where they can manipulate the system and act as a dark money organization. Super-PACs must disclose their donors, though, they can accept unlimited donations from non-profit organizations, such as 501(c) organizations and \\"shell\\" corporations who do not have to disclose their donors. These loopholes makes it easier to funnel money from group to group, expanding the amount of dark money in these shadow campaigns.  Coordination laws  The FEC Seal A \\"Super-PAC\\" can spend unlimited amounts with expressed advocacy to a campaign, as long as its expenditures are independent of any campaign: there can be no coordination between with candidates, committees, or the parties. All communications, monetary contributions or payments must be made outside of the candidate, committees, or parties. Essentially, communications made at the request or suggestion of the candidate, committee, or party are illegal. Second, the content of the expenditure directly makes political reference to a party or candidate with the intent to influence an election within ninety days of that election. Meaning, it is illegal if the campaign has any involvement in the material content of the communication. Third, the conduct of those running the advertisement should not suggest any coordination with a candidate, party, or committee. Thus, even the campaign having substantial conversations with the spender prior to the communication is illegal. Lastly, the campaign and the spender cannot employ a common vendor, nor previous employees within 120 days. This ensures that the campaign doesn't intentionally funnel information through a common vendor from party to party, nor can a campaign purposely let an employee go with the intent of coordinating on advertisements with an outside group.

Known for being an effective orator, she was one of four women honoured retrospectively by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, in the naming of Suffragette Square, Stockport. Early life Hannah Winbolt was born Hannah Oldham 1851, the youngest of three children, to William Oldham and his wife Esther in a cottage in Great Moor, Stockport. She received a part-time education at a small local school only to the age of eight, before having to start work in service as a nurse. This lack of education for girls is something to which she would return to in her later campaigning. At the age of twelve she began working in a cotton factory with other members of her family. During the cotton famine there was no work and they lived on poor relief. When she was sixteen, her health impaired by factory conditions, she went to live with her uncle, a silk weaver, who taught her his trade. In 1874 she married John O'Connor Winbolt, who was declared to be silk manufacturer. He was to become a keen supporter of her political work. They set up home at 12 Store Street and lived at various addresses in that street, developing the row of cottages along with a row fronting the main road (now the A6), including the Co-operative store on the corner. They never had children. The couple were living at 2 Store Street when John died after a long illness in 1920, and Hannah remained there until her death in 1928.Census Returns of England and Wales, 1851, 1861, 1871, 1881, 1891, 1911; the National Archives of the United Kingdom: Public Record Office The \\"Working Woman\\" suffragist Travelling to Manchester by train with completed silk cloth to sell, she met Lydia Becker (1827-1890) a leader in the early British suffrage movement, best remembered for founding and publishing the Women's Suffrage Journal between 1870 and 1890. She asked Winbolt to sign a petition in support of women's suffrage. Uncertain as to what this might involve, Winbolt asked her uncle whether she should sign and he replied \\"Yes, lass, it's nobbut right that she signs; it's just fur t'rights of women, and rights ye maun have.\\" Becker saw in Winbolt a valuable asset to the suffrage movement as a representative of the \\"working woman\\", and recruited her to campaign for women's rights.Liddington and Norris, Liddington and Norris (2000) Winbolt first came to press attention in the early 1890s, when she was elected to the committee of the Union of Women's Liberal Associations for the Manchester area. She founded a branch of the association in Hazel Grove in 1891 and was described as \\"the spirited and able president\\". Through her speaking engagements she met another well-known suffragist, Countess Alice Kearney, who was to become a good friend, often staying with the Winbolts in Store Street when speaking in the area; She also stayed with Kearney at her Kensington home in London. On 18 February 1892, Winbolt was chosen by theManchester National Society for Women's Suffrage to present to Parliament a petition by 4,292 Cheshire textile workers canvassed by the society, requesting women be appointed factory inspectors to improve the working conditions of women and children in the mills. Winbolt was elected as a \\"Progressive Candidate\\" for the Executive Committee of the Women's Liberal Federation in 1892. In 1893 she became a delegate to the National Women's Federation. Announcement of an 1894 public meeting in Accrington, England Over the next few years she spoke at many meetings around the country, on a range of topics concerning the rights of working women and children, in every case, much was made of the fact that she was a \\"working woman\\" herself. In addition to \\"Votes for Women\\", she spoke and wrote on the education of children, housing of the poor, equal pay for women, Home Rule, fair trade, the Manchester Association for the Abolition of State Regulation of Vice, and the campaigns for abolition of the House of Lords. In 1896, she was elected to the committee of the Union of Women's Liberal Associations giving \\"a rousing speech\\" to that year's meeting of the National Liberal Federation. Her public appearances were often lively affairs: Winbolt lecturing her middle-class audience in her Cheshire accent. She believed in humour as a way to get her message across, especially in response to hecklers. Reporting on a typical conference of the National Liberal Association the writer in The South Wales Daily noted: \\"Prominent features of the meeting were the utterances of Mrs. Winbolt, of Stockport, on the subjects of registration reform and the industrial position of women. Herself an experienced workwoman, with a natural gift of eloquence and a burning desire to help women who have to earn their living by manual labour, she delighted and encouraged her fellow-delegates with her vigorous advocacy for limitations on the hours which young half-timers have to work and the placing of an equality of women with men so far as employment was concerned\\". As previously mentioned, Hannah Winbolt and her husband helped in establishing a Cooperative Store in Great Moor. In 1894 she spoke at the opening meeting of the local Co- operative Women's Guild, very much a workers' movement. The Co-operative News followed her activities. Later life After Alice Kearney's death in 1899, Winbolt seems to have retired to some extent from public life though she was still speaking about how women workers were disadvantaged in the silk and cotton trades because they had no vote. In March 1902 she committed a Women's Suffrage Petition this time signed by 29,359 textile workers to Lancashire MPs to present to Parliament so earning her an even wider recognition in the press. By now, hers and others dedicated efforts were being taken up by a more militant suffrage movement which also originated in the Manchester area led by Emmeline Pankhurst. In July 1905 the Cheshire County News reported her speaking at a rally under the heading Suffragists at Stockport but in the September she was sharing a platform with Adela Pankhurst and Annie Kenney under the heading 'Suffragettes in Stockport\\". There is no evidence that Winbolt took part in civil disobedience, or damage to property, as practised by the Suffragettes. However letters to the local newspapers show her concern for those suffragettes suffering in prison. In 1918 the Representation of the People Act came into law. So, as a woman over 30 years of age and married to a husband whose property was worth a rateable yearly value of over ¬£5, Winbolt was entitled to vote in a Parliamentary election. After his death, she inherited John's property so this entitled her to vote in her own right. She lived to see the Representation of the People Act 1928 extend the vote to all adults over the age of 21 before she died later that year. Besides her speaking engagements, Winbolt wrote many letters to various newspapers, politicians and influential people on issues concerning women. She pasted copies of her published letters along with many cuttings from newspapers not fully attributed to sources into a large scrapbook now archived in Stockport Central Library. Winbolt was one of the four local women for whom Suffragette Square in Stockport was named on International Women's Day in 2018 (the others being Elizabeth Raffald, Elsie Plant and Gertrude Powicke).

Career  McGahern graduated from the University of Wolverhampton in 2009 with a degree in Animation. He became a stand-up comedian after working as a barman in what is sometimes described as the birthplace of Irish comedy, the International Bar. He stated in an interview that the two biggest influences on his early stand up were Steve Martin and Dylan Moran. Chris Tordoff, creator of Hardy Bucks, spotted McGahern during a stand-up performance one night in Dublin and offered him a cameo on his new show. McGahern's character, Sim Card, quickly became a regular cast member. In 2011, McGahern starred in the independent feature film No Party for Billy Burns which was written and directed by Padraig Conaty. The film also stars Shane Connaughton, Sonya O'Donoghue and Charlie McGuinness. The film took six years to complete and was made on a budget of between ‚Ç¨7,000 and ‚Ç¨8,000. In 2013, McGahern became the host of Republic of Telly replacing Dermot Whelan. He continued to host the show until its eventual cancellation in 2017, and was the longest serving host of the show. In 2014, he wrote and directed The Devil's Ceili with Philip Doherty, which went on to win two awards including best play at the All Ireland Drama Festival. The play presents the psychedelic experiences of three social climbers in a small Cavan town who are slipped LSD by the devil. In 2017, he hosted his own documentary series Kevin McGahern's America in which he explored various aspects of life in America: gun rights, intimacy in the digital age, and whether you really can choose your family. It received positive reviews and McGahern was praised for his \\"low-key yet alert\\" interviewing style. He has sometimes used satire for activism. The Republic of Telly sketch \\"Felix Bollard: A Serious Man\\" lampooned anti-LGBT rights campaigners' activities during the run-up to the marriage equality referendum of 2015 in Ireland. Along with fellow Irish comedian Tara Flynn, he wrote and starred in a video for LGBT Noise called \\"Armagaydon\\". The video had a swell of international support. As well as speaking out in favour of marriage equality, McGahern has also campaigned in favour of a \\"yes\\" vote in the 2018 abortion referendum.

L. M. Nicolas‚Äîwas a Persian-born French historian and orientalist who is best known today for his early work on Shaykhism and B√°bism. Although primarily remembered for his academic contributions, Nicolas worked as an interpreter and diplomat with the French Consular Service in Persia for most of his life. Nicolas was among the first Western Orientalists to devote substantial attention to the life and teachings of the revolutionary Persian religious figure known as the B√°b, and his work continues to serve as an important source for the study of the early history of Shaykhism, B√°bism and the Bah√°'√≠ Faith.  Biography  Nicolas was born on 27 March 1864, in Rasht, in the Gilan Province of Iran where his father was stationed with the French Consular Service in Persia. As a young man he learned to speak French, Persian and Russian, going on to study at the Special School for Oriental Languages in Paris. After his studies, Nicolas followed his father‚Äôs footsteps, joining the consular services in which he served as leading Persian interpreter. An ongoing disagreement between Nicolas‚Äôs father and Arthur de Gobineau‚Äîsecretary and charg√© d‚Äôaffarires at the French legation in Persia, who would go on to be an influential orientalist‚Äîled Nicolas to read Gobineau‚Äôs book Les Religions et Les Philosophies dan l'Asie Centrale.

As a result of his research, Nicolas befriended an employee of the consulate who was a member of the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Faith, and who assisted him to meet local B√°b√≠s and Bah√°‚Äô√≠s. As Nicolas continued studying, his interest did not remain purely academic. He developed friendships with local members of the two religions, and undertook to translate a selection of B√°b√≠ scriptures. Over the course of translating the B√°b‚Äôs Persian Bay√°n and Dal√°'il-i-Sab'ih (The Seven Proofs) from Persian to French, he developed a growing appreciation for the teachings and person of the B√°b, came to identify as a follower of the B√°b, or a B√°b√≠.

Strategic risk is often a major factor in determining a company's worth, particularly observable if the company experiences a sharp decline in a short period of time. Due to this and its influence on compliance risk, it is a leading factor in modern risk management.  Financial distress and strategic risk  In 2004, James Lam Associates researched the main cause for financial distress at companies that publicly traded. The research question was: when a company faces a major market value decline which is a 30 percent relative decline, what was the main cause? The research team found that 76 S&P500; companies had suffered a dramatic decline in market value in a month, after analyzing the market value data of S&P500; companies from 1982 to 2003. The JLA research team determined the root case of their market value decline by reviewing news reports, regulatory filings, and company statements. These 76 companies worked with a cross major industries such as energy, materials, industrials, telecommunications, consumer products, health care, utilities, and financials. Overall, the JLA's study found that 61 percent of occurrences were due to strategic risks (i.e. consumer demand, M&A;, competitive threats), 30 percent were caused by operational risks, and 9 percent were due to financial risks. Yet, in practice, a lot of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) programs downplay or ignore strategic risks.  Importance of strategic risk  The importance of strategic risk has risen along with both \\"regulatory and stakeholder expectations\\". In 2005, the Corporate Executive Board‚Äînow under Gartner‚Äîpublished a study on Fortune 1000 companies between the years 1998 and 2002, and the types of risks that affected them the most. These companies comprised the top 20% who faced the most drastic \\"market value declines\\", and the number one risk they had in common was strategic risk (the second and third being operational and financial risk, respectively). There are many possible kinds of strategic risk. For example, according to a different study by CEB, published 2010, companies whose cultures do not put a strong emphasis on integrity, have been found to be 10 times more likely to commit unethical acts than those who do. CEB's Dan Currell states that such a factor may seem obvious, but is difficult to enforce in reality. A firm must establish an environment in which employees feel comfortable in communicating with each other, both managers and subordinates alike. Not addressing the strategic risk‚Äîor simply changing one's corporate culture‚Äîis much more likely to incur compliance and other business risks. CEB's Matthew Dixon states several factors that are not wrong, but ineffective in today's most common customer service strategies‚Äîchiefly, the idea that a customer service worker should do everything they can to please the customer, or what many call \\"going the extra mile\\". Instead, Dixon claims a defensive approach, where the customer service worker is instead responsive, would be much less costly and require generally less resources, including \\"burn[ing] out\\" one's employees and improved concentration.  Declines in market value  Deloitte & Touche LLP and Deloitte Research, a part of Deloitte Services LP, conducted research in 2005 and analyzed the major declines the shareholders experienced in market value. The Corporate Executive Board and James Lam & Associates research also did research on the same however they used different organizations and time frame. Deloitte Research approached Thomson Financial Global 100 Companies from 1994 to 2003 to complete the research. Their discovery was astonishing as they noticed, compared to the Morgan Stanley Financial World Index, the stock price decrease just after one month. The main conclusion to this research was that most of the companies that had large losses had more than one type of risk. Out of the 100 largest declines the most affected group was strategic risk management with an astonishing 66 companies involved. The second largest decline involved 62 companies claim business decline due to external events. The third decline involved operational risk with 61 companies claiming operational risk. The last high percentage of risk would include 37 companies claiming financial risk. Most companies overall lacked intelligence to offer quick responses to developing problems. Overall most companies failed to plan for high impact risks and meet customer needs, business and economic trends, and technology trends.  Implementation and assessment methods  Implementation of the risk management plan requires the company to consider a couple factors for the success and effectiveness of the risk management plan. First, the firm must assign responsibility to a risk manager or managers to ensure the management plan can be carried out and individuals risks' owners are identified. This assignment gives individuals adequate authority and access to resources to ensure the success of the management plan. Therefore, it is important that the management team sets a clear outline as to who is responsible and for what areas of the strategic risks. Secondly, in a broader sense, the company must remain committed to the plan. This commitment should include providing adequate financial and human resources for risk managers to carry out the implementation of the plan. Most importantly, the risk manager must understands that evolving nature of the risk management plan, and to adjust the plan accordingly to reflect the changes in the phrases or stages of a strategy. For example, a risk being addressed may not be as important as previously thought; therefore, the management team should reflect such change in its plan and allocate resources originated from this risk to other ones. Also, certain risks addressed will or will not occur at a particular stage or phase of a project, and the management team should update such change to keep the plan current. Keeping a current plan frees up resources to those risks identified as more current or severe. Certain risks might result in overspending or under, affecting the resources available for the management plan. Thus, the adequacy of the financial and human resources for the success of the risk management plan should be frequently reevaluated to give as much advance warning as possible for excess contingency or future inadequacy. Assessment of the strategic risk must involve a cross-functional team that establish and maintain a review process for the company's new and current strategy. The cross-functional team should include representatives from key departments within the organization such as management, marketing, legal, operations, and technology. By assembly a cross-function team for the assessment of strategic risk allows the company to obtain a dimensional perspective on its strategy, receiving different inputs to fully grasp the situation. The assessment should establish objective criteria for each strategy. To assess a particular strategy, the team should also consider whether the risks being addressed may be derived from sources such as government policy, macroeconomics, natural, social industrialization and technological uncertainty. For instance, a cosmetic company wants to upgrade its products overseas as a strategy to leverage its revolutionizing technology to gain comparative advantage must consider whether such technology is in compliance with the local government or not.  Mitigating strategic risk  Since strategic risk comes from the business strategy of a company, it is important for top management and the board of directors to be involved in creating a plan to reduce risk in this area. Management should use their knowledge of the company and its industry to formulate a strategy, and work in collaboration with the board of directors to identify and assess possible risks associated with that strategy. It is then the role of the board to decide upon an acceptable level of risk and whether the potential gains from the strategy proposed are worth the risk. Three approaches to managing strategic risk include: * Using independent experts  Experts from outside of the firm can be used to periodically assess the risk level of projects * Facilitators  A central group manages risk across different departments of a company by collecting information from operating managers and creating a comprehensive review of the company's risk * Embedded experts  In industries such as financial services where the company's level of risk is highly variable and dependent upon the actions of traders and investment managers, risk experts can work alongside these employees to continuously monitor and assess their daily actions Strategic risk management framework By following a strategic management process, a company can ensure that risk is addressed at every step of * Strategic risk profile analysis  In this step, risks are identified by examining factors that could affect the business. These could be internal factors, such as the organization's structure and culture, or external factors such as industry trends, consumer preferences, or the regulatory environment the company is operating in. A SWOT analysis can be performed to evaluate and prioritize certain risks. * Formulation of strategic plan  Using insight gained from the analysis, the company outlines proposed strategies and defines the objectives and goals needed to carry out its strategic mission/vision. The strategic plan should detail key risk metrics and performance indicators to measure, how they will be measured, and who is responsible for managing them. It should also establish thresholds, or trigger points for these metrics, which will be used to determine when management should take action to mitigate or accept more risk. * Implementation  During this step, the company puts the strategy into practice through their operations. This includes setting budgets and the organizational structure. This is also where strategic risk is controlled and managed by monitoring the risk metrics identified during the analysis.

This was Deevy's first work to be rejected after having six consecutive plays produced and performed at the Abbey Theatre. The play follows protagonist James Whelan through his journey to success, while dealing with his complicated relationship with his childhood sweetheart, Nan. The play focuses on the conflict between ambition and contentment‚Äîa sensitive topic in the new Ireland.  Synopsis = Act I = A sunny sheltered spot on the outskirts of an Irish town‚ÄîKillbeggan, Early summer Act I begins with Nan, Kate, Bill, and Tom chattering about the job prospect in Dublin, and whether or not James got it. Bill flirts with Nan despite her lack of interest, and they gossip, saying that once Whelan leaves Nan will find herself in the arms of another. Jack rides over on his bike, and Nan is visibly softer and sweeter with him. He is from the town over but is starting a new job at Tobin's, a position previously held by James. It is evident that a relationship is likely to develop between Jack and Nan. James enters, declaring that he has been offered the job and that he is leaving for Dublin tonight. He and Nan bicker about him leaving, as he wants her to wait for him while she wants him to stay. Jack returns and there is tension between the two men. As people leave, Kate advises James that if he wants Nan, he must secure her before he leaves. The scene ends with James planning a big goodbye, asking Kate to bring everyone to the train before he leaves. = Act II = The office of the silver wings motor service, early summer. Seven years later Act II takes place seven years after Act I. James has returned to Kilbeggan and now owns Silver Wings Motor Service. Apollo Moran works as a bookkeeper for James. Nan enters the shop to ask James for work. She and Jack were married for two years before he died, and now she must provide for their child alone. She is distant and detached from James while he seems hopeful that they may rekindle their relationship. As they are speaking, Nora enters looking for James. Apollo has her wait until James and Nan are finished speaking, and James is appalled with that decision and has Nan wait outside while he meets with the Nora. While James and Nora are flirtatious with one another, James appears to be uncomfortable with some of Nora's behavior. Meanwhile, there is a talk between Tom and Apollo about James' need to choose a wife, discussing both Kate and Nora. Kate arrives at Silver Wings, and she tells James she would like to see him married. They reminisce and she says if things were different they could be married, but she ultimately advises him to propose to Nora. James and Nan return to his office where James offers Nan a job taking over Apollo's post as a bookkeeper, to allow Apollo to drive buses with Tom. He tells her he will give her one pound straight away so she can buy new clothes for work. However, when Nan believes herself to be alone, she takes some money off of James' desk. James sees this and confronts Nan, and the scene ends with him calling the police to arrest Nan. = Act III = Same as act II, six months later The scene opens with James, Tom, and Apollo talking about business. Nan enters to speak to James. She has just been released from jail, where James ensured she would get the toughest sentence possible. She is again asking for work, saying she will do anything. James offers her a demeaning and laborious job, scrubbing and tending to the fire, yet he condemns her for having no dignity in accepting this type of work. He mentions that she will need to come in early to tend the fire if Bill comes, as James is considering a business partnership between their two businesses. Nan becomes visibly anxious at the mention of Bill, and she quickly shifts subjects leading to an argument. She insists that while she stole from James, his actions in the aftermath were far worse. Mid-argument, Kate arrives at the shop and interrupts the two to speak with James. She tries to convince him to give Nan better work, urging him to forgive her since she is in a difficult situation. She leaves, and Tom and Nan talk about the incident from Act II. He says James only reacted so harshly because he still loves Nan, and mentions that James is still in search of a wife. Nora enters to speak with James, and he flirts openly with her in front of Nan. Nora notices that James still harbors feelings for Nan and confronts him about their relationship. Incited by jealousy, she taunts James before inviting him to a party later that evening at her house. Next Bill arrives to discuss the offer of employment James has made him, with the intention to negotiate the terms of the offer. Mid-conversation, Bill reveals that he and Nan were going to get married, but that she retracted her acceptance, refusing him. Upon learning this, James retracts the offer. He subsequently speaks with Nan, who reveals that after Jack died, Bill was very persistent with her for her hand in marriage. While she originally agreed thinking it would be best for her child, she could not go through with it. After she rejected Bill, he accused her of stealing money from him. She explains to James that that is why she tried to steal his money because she was in debt to Bill and she saw how easy it could be. James takes pity on Nan and offers her the position as bookkeeper again, before swiftly exiting and punching Bill in the street. He returns to find Nora and implies that there will be some sort of legal action taken against him. He says that despite the trouble he is in, if she will still have him, he will attend her party and ask her father for her hand in marriage.

Rejection from the Abbey  In 1942, Deevy submitted Wife to James Whelan to the Abbey Theatre, where six of her previous works had been well-received. The Wild Goose, her sixth play, had been performed in 1935 when the Abbey became the first subsidized theatre in the English speaking world.Morash, Christopher, \\"Teresa Deevy: Between the Lines, Mint Theater Company, 2010. The Minister of Finance, Ernest Blythe, granted the Abbey an annual subsidy, and from 1941-1961 Blythe was the managing director for the theatre. He read Wife to James Whelan and immediately rejected it. He wrote to Deevy explaining that its characters closely resembled those in another one of her plays, Katie Roche, and therefore it would not be a financial possibility. Deevy wrote to a friend saying, \\"Blythe's letter when returning it showed clearly that he had no use for my work‚Äî never asked to see any more. Said the characters were too like Katie Roche. No one else could see this resemblance... The subject matter is quite different. I suppose any play by an author has a certain resemblance‚Äîthe author's viewpoint, but that is all.\\" Blythe's rejection of the play is argued to have been due to his conservative values. The Republic of Ireland was established in 1937, and the rise of a conservative Fianna F√°il party led to increased censorship ‚Äî the Abbey was subsidized and therefore needed to be in accordance with the government. Many consider the political undertones in Wife to James Whelan and Ireland's new barring of women in the workforce outlined in the 1937 Constitution as the reason for Blythe's rejection.Article 41, Subsection 2, Ireland's Constitution of 1937 Deevy then sent the play to the Players theatre, which could not produce the show due to a lack of cast. The rejection of Wife to James Whelan marked the end of Deevy's relationship with the Abbey and the beginning of a shift to conservative ideologies by the theatre.  Production  Wife to James Whelan was performed on BBC radio in 1944. The Mint Theater in New York City first performed the play in 2010, after Deevy's nephew discovered the script in the 1990s. The show ran from July 29 to October 3, 2010. The production process included a fully staged production, directed by Jonathan Bank, with well-researched program notes, post-performance discussions, audio and video recordings, a publication of Deevy's collected works, and an academic conference with Trinity College Dublin. It received some strong reviews in the press, including praise from The New York Times. Others critiqued the production, with Variety calling the play a \\"pedestrian piece of writing.\\" The piece received its British premiere at the New Diorama Theatre in London in 2011 directed by Gavin McAlinden and was Critics' Choice in The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph and The Independent on Sunday.

Purpose  Although the Committee was involved in the passage of some broad pension bills, under which individuals could apply to executive agencies for relief, it also handled thousands of private requests from specific individuals petitioning for special consideration. During the lifetime of the Committee, pensions were entirely considered in the context of veterans of war.  History  Shortly after the founding of the United States, federal pension bills were passed on behalf of Revolutionary War veterans, but were implemented by the States, as the federal government had no means to pay for them. Pensions initially consisted of half-pay for 7 years for disabled military veterans, and were extended to include widows and orphans of veterans a few years later. In 1789, the federal government started paying for some pensions as well. In 1818, the federal government under President James Madison passed a large pension bill for veterans of the Revolutionary War at his urging. The bill didn't require applicants to provide evidence of poverty or disability to be granted benefits, unlike previous programs. However, as a result, the program cost more money than expected due to fraud, and was amended in 1820 into a means- tested benefit. Confederate soldiers were not granted pensions by the federal government; their pensions had to be granted and funded by Southern states.  Historical members  = Chairs = * James M.

History  The deme takes its name from the hero Butes, one of the legendary Argonauts, and a priest. The important family of Eteobutadae, who possessed some hereditary priestly positions, claimed the lineage of this hero and were originally called Butadae; after Cleisthenes created the deme with the same name, the priests changed their names to Eteobutadi or \\"real Butadae\\". Probably Cleisthenes gave the deme the same name as the family of priests to reduce their power: in fact, the family held two of the most important religious offices, that of priestess of Athena and that of priest of Poseidon, who were revered on the Acropolis of Athens together with Butes. They also supported the inhabitants of the plain, who fought against the Alcmaeonidae for the control of Attica. Cleisthenes also weakened the family by placing the deme in the Oene√Øs tribe rather than in Erechtheis, since they also possessed the cult of Erechtheum. The family saw this as an affront and changed its name from Butadae to Eteobutadae (i.e. \\"true descendants of Butes\\"). The site of Butadae is located northwest of Kerameis.

Calala Island is privately owned by the Wickham family. The whole island operates as a luxury resort, accommodating a maximum of eight guests. History Calala Island is situated in an area known as the Moskito Coast. Historically, the coast of Nicaragua and islands close to it have been under the rule of both the British and the Spanish. In the 1600s, the British first settled on Old Providence, which is around east of Calala Island in the Caribbean Sea. The Providence Island Company based in the area was set up to transport goods from the \\"Moskito Kingdom\\" as the British often referred to it. According to maps and documents from this period, the Pearl Cays and Calala Island were part of this territory. During this period, the Spanish more aggressively attempted to influence the region, with the first contact from the Spanish in the region dating back to 1545. By the early 1600s, the Spanish controlled a large territory in the neighbouring countries, such as Nicaragua and Honduras. The French-pirate Fran√ßois l'Olonnais is known to have spent time on the Pearl Cays in the mid-1600s. He spoke of a natives who resided on the island at this time in history, referring to them as primitive, but also as cannibals. When the Treaty of Managua was signed in 1860 between the British and Nicaragua, Calala Island became a Nicaraguan island.Memorial Submitted by the Government of Nicaragua, vol. I: Maritime delimitation between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Honduras) , International Court of Justice, 21 March 2001 Ecosystem The ecosystem on the island has a number of notable species, mainly seabirds and turtles. According to accounts from Fran√ßois l'Olonnais, parrots and monkeys were previously located in the Pearl Cays region. The critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle are often seen on the island and is part of a conservation effort to increase the numbers. Calala Island's owners and the Wildlife Conservation Society have increased nesting numbers considerably since the partnership began. It is estimated that nests on the island have increased significantly, with around 6000 eggs laid on the island by the Hawksbills each year. Laying season for the turtles is from May through to November, with hatchings taking place September through to February. Other islands species include the American yellow warbler, the white-necked puffbird, hummingbirds and the magnificent frigatebird. Location Calala Island is located in the Caribbean Sea and is part of the Pearl Cays archipelago, off the coast of Nicaragua. The island is under the administration of the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region. At some point in its history, the name of the island changed from Lime Cay to Calala Island. The likelihood is due to a name clash with a Jamaican cay. The island is located around 4 km off the Nicaraguan coast lying 27 km from Pearl Lagoon and 150 km west of San Andres, Ciudad Sandino, Nicaragua. Private ownership In 1997, a number of Nicaraguan islands were purchased by the businessman, Peter Tsokos. Calala Island was one of these islands and like many islands in the Caribbean, the purchase raised questions about the split between private and public use at the time. Necker island is one such example of this ongoing debate. Some in the media suggested Tsokos only bought the island as an investment, with no aims of developing the islands. Tim and Sarah Wickham purchased Calala Island after their honeymoon on Petit St Vincent, with the aim of creating a resort on the island. The Wickham's then developed the island with the construction of a luxury resort. The island resort contains four guest suites at the beachfront, accommodating a total of 8 guests. During interviews, Wickham stated that he wanted the island to be exclusive, but also protect the ecosystem. Apart from the suites, the island has 25 staff, a bar, two restaurants and a helipad. It received media coverage in 2017 after a week-long vacation had a price tag of $1 million. In early 2018, it was announced that Princess Eugenie became engaged to Jack Brooksbank while vacationing on Calala Island.

Despite multiple investigations, an arrest and a trial, the woman has never been identified.  Discovery of the victim  The body was found by a woman riding on horseback through Bedgebury Forest on Tuesday, 23 October 1979. The forest floor was dry as the weather had been dry and sunny for a few weeks. The body had been battered, mutilated, murdered and dumped but little attempt had been made to conceal the body and it was apparent in the undergrowth from the rider‚Äòs position. The victim had suffered massive head injuries from a beating. A bloodstained wooden stake found near the victim‚Äôs body was later concluded to have been the murder weapon. No handbag or means of identification were found with the body. Police believe that the victim had been killed up to five days prior to her discovery.  Description of the victim  The severity of the injuries to the woman's head and body prevented identification. The woman was aged between 30 and 35, she was quite short at 5 ft 1in and she had a thin build. She had brown eyes and straight shoulder-length hair which she had kept in its natural, dark-brown colour The victim was wearing black shoes, a distinctive floral dress, a black polo neck jumper and a yellow blouse. The police stated that the black and white patterned dress was the clue that was most likely to lead to the discovery of her identity. The dress was found to have been homemade from furniture fabric. It had been altered on multiple occasions; once to the hem and another to the chest area. The dress had been purchased at a charity, or second hand shop. Police believed that the victim was very poor and possibly from the north of England. The autopsy revealed that the victim had an ectopic pregnancy which had been present for 4‚Äì6 weeks and bleeding for 2‚Äì3 weeks. The victim would have been in severe pain and may have visited a doctor suspecting appendicitis as the pain would have occurred on her right side. Stretch marks on her stomach indicated that she had probably given birth to at least one child. The victim's molars were very worn down and she had wisdom teeth which indicated that she was at least 30 years old. There was no evidence that the victim had ever visited a dentist in her life. The victim had prominent, visibly decayed teeth. No nicotine staining was found on the victim's hands, teeth or lungs. Additionally, the victim's lungs did not exhibit the carbon deposits typical of a city-dweller, indicating that she probably lived in the countryside. Police believe the woman was of no fixed address and was a regular hitchhiker along the M1 and M6 motorways and may have had a connection with the Vale of Evesham. There was a possibility that she may have been working as a sex worker, operating from Spitalfields in London.  Initial investigation  After the discovery the police searched the missing persons databases at New Scotland Yard and the UK Social Services. Hospitals and doctors surgeries were also polled for persons who matched the description of the woman. A large poster campaign was launched throughout the UK and Europe. All of these investigative efforts failed to produce a match to the woman's identity.  Subsequent events  = Crimewatch 1984 = In December 1984, the victim was featured on an episode of the BBC TV programme Crimewatch. Police appealed for the persons that had made, or altered, the black and white dress to come forward. = Reopening of the case = In October 1998, the case was reopened after an investigation by forensic scientists on archived evidence. The victim's case was highlighted in the national media as one of a number of such cases that had been reopened due to a new DNA technique that enabled the generation of DNA profiles from much smaller samples than had been previously possible. The size of these samples was described as being as small as a single blood cell, or a flake of skin. = Arrest = In January 1999, the first arrest in the case was made. Harry J R Pennells (b. 1925), then 75, of Ticehurst, East Sussex, was charged with the victim's murder. Pennells, who was 54 at the time of the murder was a retired lorry driver and had worked for Henley's Transport who were based in Kent at the time of the murder. Pennells had originally been questioned by police a few days after the discovery of the body. He had been interviewed three times between 1979 and 1980 and was one of a number of suspects. He had not been charged following the initial investigation. However, after specks of blood found in his lorry in 1979 were re-examined and linked to the victim police were able to make their arrest. Pennells was subsequently bailed and a report was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. = Crimewatch 1999 = On 22 February 1999, the victim's case was featured on Crimewatch for a second time. It was revealed that after the original Crimewatch appeal in 1984, the person who made the black-and-white dress had made contact. The woman, who was from Stratford-upon-Avon, stated that she had given the dress to a charity shop in Evesham, Worcestershire after which police could not trace it. It appeared to have been subsequently altered to shorten the length, remove the zip from the back and add a black lace ruff to the collar. An appeal was made for the person who made these alterations to come forward. = Trial = The trial started on 4 May 2000 at Maidstone Crown Court. Pennells was accused of picking up the victim at Spitalfields Market on 19 October 1979, taking her in his lorry to a delivery in Keighley, West Yorkshire, then back to drop her off in South London on the morning of 20 October and beating the victim to death with a wooden stake. Pennells told the court that he had picked up a female hitchhiker. He admitted that the hitchhiker may have been the victim, but claimed that he had dropped her off alive and was innocent of her murder. Witnesses called by the prosecution stated that they had seen a woman matching the victim's description in Bedgebury Forest on 21 October 1979, the day after some estimations placed the murder. Two witnesses who were at the Keighley lorry depot stated that they saw, and spoke to, a young woman who was with Pennells. Staff at the Henley Transport's Rochdale depot also stated that they saw Pennells with a woman with a similar appearance to an artist's impression made of the victim. Samples of blood and flakes of hair found in a sleeping bag on the passenger seat of the lorry matched the DNA profile of the victim. Additionally, particles of foam from a mattress in the cab of the lorry were found on the victim's dress. The trial lasted for four weeks, after which Pennells was found not guilty in a unanimous decision made after the jury deliberated for 1 hour and 15 minutes. = Subsequent appeals to identify the victim = In October 2007, the charity Missing People appealed to the public for someone to come forward and identify the woman.

Along with this collaboration, there is also the element of Jewish songs having a direct impact on Black musicians. Throughout musical history there are many iconic moments where Black artists performed Jewish music, including notable figures such as Paul Robeson, Cab Calloway, and Aretha Franklin. Many of these Black artists claim to feel a connection to the Jewish songs and people from their shared desire for freedom and sadness from leaving their ancestral lands.  \\"Eli Eli\\"  ‚ÄúEli, Eli‚Äù a song based on a poem by Hannah Szenes, who was a Jewish paratrooper for the British government in Palestine, became a popular song sung by Jewish and black singers alike, including Paul Robeson. Paul Robeson was a famous black performer, actor, and civil rights activist known for his diverse singing style and his civil rights work. Robeson also famously performed, what he called a \\"Hassidic Chant\\", which was a version of the Jewish prayer, the Kaddish amended by the Levi Yitzhak of Berdichev, at Carnegie Hall. Robeson not only performed the chant, but connected it to his African and family roots, saying that it was a personal song that linked him to his late father, since the Kaddish is said when mourning a parent, who had been born a slave and was a preacher. \\"Eli Eli\\" was also famously covered by artists, such as Duke Ellington, and Ethel Waters, who said \\"that history of their age-old grief and despair is so similar to that of my own people that I felt I was telling the story of my own race too.‚Äù The song discussed here should not be confused with the traditional Jewish hymn of the same name recorded by Belle Baker in 1919 (see https://www.loc.gov/resource/ihas.200196253.0?st=gallery) and included in the 1931 show \\"Rhapsody in Black (see https://www.ibdb.com/broadway- production/rhapsody-in-black-11364 )  Cab Calloway  Cab Calloway, was a famous black American Jazz singer, who drew heavy influences from Jewish music, even going so far to be considered an \\"Afro-Yiddishist.\\" Calloway's friendship with his Jewish manager, Irving Mills was Calloway's main gateway into the world of Jewish music and songs. Calloway also said he learned about Jewish music when he was a kid and would go to hear the cantors sing in synagogues, which he claims directly influences his notable \\"Hi-De-Ho' style,\\" exemplified in his hit song and later famous animation, \\"Minnie the Moocher.\\" Calloway directly paid homage to the Yiddish culture introduced to him by Irving Berlin in his song \\"Utt De Zay (The Tailor's Song)\\" based on a real Yiddish song of the same name.  Fiddler on the Roof  Cannonball Adderley, was an American Jazz Saxophonist, who played legends like Miles Davis. In 1964, he released Cannonball Adderley's Fiddler on the Roof, a saxophone version of the famous Fiddler on the Roof musical soundtrack. The broadway play was a resounding success, and Cannonball Adderley's rendition helped further connect the Black and Jewish music experience. Although it is a Jazz rendition, Addereley still maintains the Klezmer style on the song \\"Tradition,\\" in order to respect the Jewish heritage of the song. The Temptations also famously recorded a medley of songs from Fiddler on the Roof, including \\"Sunrise, sunset,\\" \\"If I Were a Rich Man,\\" and \\"Matchmaker, matchmaker.\\" References Category:Jewish music Category:African-American music ","title":"Black performance of Jewish music"},{"id":"58707321","text":"\\"Sick of Drugs\\" is a 1996 single by The Wildhearts.

Previously, the country signed the Iberian Pact with Spain in 1939 for mutual defence support within the peninsula as a result of the support Salazar's regime has provided for Franco's Nationalists camp in the Spanish Civil War and the good relations between the two leaders. These two agreements have laid the foundations for Portugal's defence policy in the second half of the 20th century.  Portuguese Army  Traditionally the Portuguese Army maintained (until 2009) two distinct structures. A Base Structure of the Army (Estrutura Base do Ex√©rcito (EBE)) included the depot units (regiments, centers and schools), which had responsibilities to train, arm and support troops, maintain military infrastructure and support the civilian population during emergencies. A Permanent Operational Force of the Army (For√ßa Operacional Permanente do Ex√©rcito) included the operational units of the Army. Divisions had existed in the Portuguese Army until the mid-1970s, but then NATO-assigned field forces shrunk to brigade size. By the late 1980s, there were two brigades directly responsible to the Army Staff, the 1st Independent Mixed Brigade (established 11 May 1978) and the Special Forces Brigade (formed 3 July 1984, based upon the mechanised Commando Regiment), four military regions, and two overseas military zones. = Operational Forces = *1st Independent Mixed Brigade  Headquarters  Armoured Battalion  Mechanized Infantry Battalion Motorized Infantry Battalion  Motorized Infantry Battalion  Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron  Armoured Combat Engineer Company  Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Company  Self-Propelled Surface-to-Air-Missile Company  Light Surfact-to-Air Missile Company  Mixed Field Artillery Battalion *Special Forces Brigade (Brigada de For√ßas Especiais) (Lamego)  Commando Regiment (Regimento de Comandos) (Amadora) * Headquarters * 1¬∫ Commando Battalion * 2¬∫ Commando Battalion * 3¬∫ Commando Battalion (training unit) = Military Regions = Military Regions (Regi√µes Militares)  Military Region North  The Military Region North covered the Districts of Bragan√ßa, Vila Real, Porto, Braga and Viana do Castelo. * Headquarters - Porto  Porto Infantry Regiment  Chaves Infantry Regiment  Vila Real Infantry Regiment  Braga Cavalry Regiment  Lancer Cavalry Squadron  Administration Battalion  Espinho Engineer Regiment  Military Region Center  The Military Region Center covered the Districts of Santar√©m, Leiria, Coimbra, Castelo Branco, Aveiro, Viseu and Guarda. * Headquarters - Coimbra  Abrantes Infantry Regiment  Castelo Branco Infantry Regiment  Tomer Infantry Regiment  Averio Infantry Regiment  Leira Artillery Battalion Lancer Cavalry Squadron  Military Region South  The Military Region South covered the Districts of Faro, Beja District, √âvora and Portalegre. * Headquarters - √âvora  Beja Infantry Regiment  Elvas Infantry Regiment  Faro Infantry Regiment  Estremoz Cavalry Regiment Sul Lancer Squadron  Military Region Lisbon  The Military Region South covered the Districts of Lisbon and Set√∫bal. * Headquarters - Lisbon  Mafra Infantry Regiment  Lisbon Artillery Regiment  Queluz Infantry Regiment  Coastal Artillery Regiment  Lisbon Engineer Regiment  Lisbon Lancer Regiment (military police) = Military Zones = Military Zones (Zonas Militares)  Madeira Military Zone  * Headquarters - Funchal, Madeira  Headquarters Team  Funchal Garrison Regiment  Funchal Lancer Squadron  Azores Military Zone  * Headquarters - Ponta Delgada, Azores  Headquarters Team  Angra do Heroismo Garrison Regiment  Ponta Delgada Garrison Regiment  Ponta Delgada Lancer Squadron  Air Force  The Portuguese Air Force (For√ßa A√©rea Portuguesa (FAP)) was formed on July 1, 1952 through the amalgamation of the Army (Aeron√°utica Militar) and Naval (Avia√ß√£o Naval) aviation services. Initially the FAP followed the army distinction between a base structure (Air Forces General Command - Comando Geral das For√ßas A√©reas) and operational structure (Operational Air Forces Command - Comando das For√ßas A√©reas Operacionais). Additionally there was also a Formation and Training Command (Comando de Instru√ß√£o e Treino). In 1955 the FAP also formed an airborne troops arm with the Batalh√£o de Tropas Paraquedistas and Detection and Interception Control Group (Grupo de Detec√ß√£o e Controlo da Intercep√ß√£o) was formed to take over air defence operations. In 1956 the Air Force expanded considerably with the formation of Signals and Air Traffic Control Service (Servi√ßo de Comunica√ß√µes e Tr√°fego A√©reo), Recruitment and Instruction Service (Servi√ßo de Recrutamento e Instru√ß√£o), Medical Service (Servi√ßo de Sa√∫de), Materiel Service (Servi√ßo de Material), Infrastructure Service (Servi√ßo de Infra-estruturas) and Quartermaster and Accounting Service (Servi√ßo de Intend√™ncia e Contabilidade). At the same time the country's territory (which formally included Portuguese Colonial Empire as overseas provinces) was divided in three Air Force Regions (Regi√µes A√©reas): * 1st Air Force Region (Regi√£o A√©rea N¬∫ 1 (RA1)) with HQ in Lisbon included mainland Portugal (called Portugal Continental) and three Air Force Zones (Azores, Madeira and Cape Verde) * 2nd Air Force Region (Regi√£o A√©rea N¬∫ 2 (RA2)) with HQ in Luanda included Angola, Guinea-Bissau and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe * 3rd Air Force Region (Regi√£o A√©rea N¬∫ 3 (RA3)) with HQ in Louren√ßo Marques included Mozambique, Goa and East Timor The Portuguese Air Force bases in the Portuguese Colonial War had a very rigid hierarchy: * Air Bases (Bases A√©reas (BA)) - the main operational air bases, central for an air force region or an air force zone  Base Airfields (Aer√≥dromos-Base (AB)) - the secondary operational air bases, central for a sector of an air force region, subordinated to the region's main air base * Manoeuvre Airfields (Aer√≥dromos de Manobra (AM)) - third line airfields, which would provide basing for air force units for a particular operation, temporarily detached from an air base or a base airfield  Transit Airfields (Aer√≥dromos de Tr√¢nsito (AT)) - air transport bases supporting the Lisbon - Cabo Verde - Bissau - S√£o Tom√© - Luanda - Louren√ßo Marques air route * Diversion Airfields (Aer√≥dromos de Recurso) - airfields used for emergency landings and air rescue operations  other airfields (outros aer√≥dromos) - unclassified airfields without permanent air force activities. Normally these were minor grass airfields for light aviation, providing basing for air clubs. Private pilots formed Air Force Volunteer Formations (Forma√ß√µes A√©reas Volunt√°rias) After the end of the Portuguese Colonial Wars and the country's withdrawal from Africa the structure of the airfields was simplified. Bases A√©reas (BA) are the air bases with permanent operational air force units. Aer√≥dromos de Manobra (AM) are the forward operation locations with operational air force units based when needed. The only exception is the military section of Lisbon-Portela International Airport, which retained the Aer√≥dromo de Tr√¢nsito (AT) designation in commemoration of its role as terminus of the colonial air route, despite the fact that its Dassault Falcon 20 and 50 aircraft had Montijo Air Base as their official home base. The 2nd and 3rd Air Force Regions were disbanded and the 1st Air Force Region became the Air Force Command (Comando A√©reo). = Air Force Command = Comando A√©reo Base A√©rea de Sintra - Base A√©rea N.¬∫ 1 (BA1) * 12¬∫ Grupo Operacional  Esquadra 401 \\"Cientistas\\" - photographic survey, reconnaissance, and maritime patrol squadron flying CASA C-212 Aviocar Esquadra 401 \\"Roncos\\" - basic flying training squadron flying Socata TB 30 Epsilon Esquadra 102 \\"Panchos\\" - jet flying training squadron flying Cessna T-37C Tweet Base A√©rea da Ota - Base A√©rea N.¬∫ 2 (BA2) * 21¬∫ Grupo Operacional  Esquadra 701 \\"Jakar√©s\\" - liaison squadron flying Reims-Cessna FTB-337G Skymaster  Centro de Instru√ß√£o N.¬∫ 2 (CI2) - elementary flying training center flying De Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk  Grupo de Instru√ß√£o de T√©cnicos Especialistas (GITE) - Technical Specialists Instruction Group Base A√©rea de Tancos - Base A√©rea n¬∫3 (BA3) * 31¬∫ Grupo Operacional  Esquadra 502 \\"Elefantes\\" - multirole transport and maritime patrol squadron flying CASA C-212 Aviocar  Esquadra 552 \\"Zang√µes\\" - multirole helicopter squadron flying A√©rospatiale Alouette III  Esquadra 111 - multi-engine transport and helicopter training squadron flying CASA C-212 Aviocar, A√©rospatiale Alouette III and II Base A√©rea das Lajes - Base A√©rea n.¬∫ 4 (BA4) / Comando A√©reo dos A√ßores * 41¬∫ Grupo Operacional  Esquadra 303 \\"Tigres\\" - fighter-bomber squadron flying Fiat G.91R/3 and T/3  Esquadra 503 \\"Golfinhos\\" - maritime patrol and SAR squadron flying CASA C-212 Aviocar  Esquadra 752 \\"Pumas\\" - No.752 Helicopter Squadron - SAR helicopter squadron flying A√©rospatiale SA.330C/H/L/S1 Puma Base A√©rea de Monte Real - Base A√©rea n.¬∫ 5 (BA5) * 51¬∫ Grupo Operacional Esquadra 302 \\"√Åguias Reais\\" - fighter- bomber squadron flying LTV A/TA-7P Corsair II Esquadra 304 \\"Magn√≠ficos\\" - fighter-bomber squadron flying LTV A/TA-7P Corsair II Esquadra 103 \\"Carac√≥is\\" - advanced fighter training squadron flying Lockheed T/RT-33A Shooting Star and Northrop T-38A Talon (relocated to Base A√©rea da Beja - Base A√©rea n.¬∫ 11 (BA11) in 1987 as the German Luftwaffe began winding down its flying training activities off Beja) Base A√©rea de Montijo - Base A√©rea n.¬∫ 6 (BA6) * 61¬∫ Grupo Operacional Esquadra 301 \\"Jaguares\\" - fighter-bomber squadron flying Fiat G.91R/3 and T/3 Esquadra 501 \\"Bisontes\\" - tactical transport squadron flying Lockheed C-130H Hercules Esquadra 504 \\"Linces\\" - VIP and liaison transport squadron flying Dassault Falcon 20 and 50 from Lisbon-Portela IAP Esquadra 551 - SAR helicopter squadron flying A√©rospatiale Alouette III, disbanded in 1986 and absorbed into Esquadra 552 Esquadra 751 \\"Pumas\\" - tactical transport and SAR helicopter squadron flying A√©rospatiale SA.330C/H/L/S1 Puma Esquadra 601 \\"Lobos\\" - maritime patrol and ASW squadron flying Lockheed P-3P Orion =Parachute Troops Corps= The modern history of Portuguese paratroops started in 1955 when a selected group of the Portuguese military attended the 22¬∫ Curso B√°sico de Paracaidismo at the Murcia‚ÄìAlcantarilla Air Base in Spain. After their return to Portugal a Ranger Paratroops Battalion (Batalh√£o de Ca√ßadores Paraquedistas (BCP)) was formed in 1956 at Tancos Air Base under the Air Force. In 1961 the battalion was expanded to a regiment. During the Guerra do Ultramar the regiment was the depot formation for four ranger paratroops battalions: the BCP 31 and BCP 32 in Mozambique, the BCP 21 in Angola and the BCP 12 in Guinea-Bissau. After the end of the colonial wars and Portugal's withdrawal from Africa a Parachute Troops Corps (Corpo de Tropas Paraquedistas) was formed (again a component of the Air Force). In 1991 the government decided to transfer the paratroops from the Air Force to the Army. On January 1, 1994 the Air Force's Parachute Troops Command became the Army's Airmobile Troops Command (Comando de Tropas Aerotransportadas), also absorbing the disbanded Commando Regiment. As of 2018 the Rapid Reaction Brigade is the successor of the Parachute Troops Corps. The Portuguese land forces traditionally have distinctive fixed and mobilization structure. The fixed structure is composed of depot units (regiments, bases and schools), which are tasked with troops training, armament and infrastructure overhaul. The depot units form operational units, which are subordinated to brigades and divisions during exercises and wartime. As of 1989 the Corps had the following structure: Fixed structure: * Parachute Troops Corps Command (Comando do Corpo de Tropas Paraquedistas) * 1. Parachute Troops Operational Base (Base Operacional de Tropas Paraquedistas n.¬∫ 1 (BOTP 1)), at Monsanto (Lisbon) * 2.

The amphibious component of the marines consisted of Special Riflemen Detachments (Destacamentos de Fuzileiros Especiais (DFE)) and the local defence component consisted of Naval Riflemen Companies (Companhias de Fuzileiros Navais (CFN)). These units were directly subordinated to the local naval districts and zones and at the height of the Guerra do Ultramar as many as 14 000 marines participated in counter-partisan operations in the Portuguese African provinces. After the Carnation Revolution and Portugal's withdrawal from Africa a Riflemen Corps Command (Comando do Corpo de Fuzileiros (CCF)) was formed on June 24, 1974 to streamline the Portuguese marines' force structure.

Background Godfrey Brown was born about 1838 in Slough, near Windsor Castle in England, to landscape gardener Thomas Brown and his wife Mary Ann Rhodes. His maternal grandfather Godfrey Rhodes was a bank executive, and his maternal uncle also bore the name Godfrey. His father's ill health precipitated a relocation to Hawaii in 1844, by way of a six-month sea voyage around the Falkland Islands. At the time of the voyage, Godfrey had an older brother Arthur, and younger siblings Alice, Frank and Malcolm. Three maternal aunts Annie Rhodes Covington, Sarah Rhodes Pfister and Susannah Rhodes Robinson made the relocation to Hawaii with the Brown family. Brother Cecil Brown was born in 1917 at Wailua, Kauai County, Hawaii. Hawaii Youngest brother Cecil Brown was born in 1850 in Hawaii. All brothers except Cecil were schooled in New England, after which Godfrey worked for a while in New York, followed by employment in British Columbia, and an eventual return to Hawaii. Godfrey and Cecil became financial officers of the Hawaiian Hardware Company. Legislative career For the 1878 Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Brown was Secretary of the Legislative Assembly, an appointed position to record the proceedings. He was elected as a Representative for the 1884 session. The House of Nobles were appointed by the monarch, and included the cabinet positions. Brown was a member of the Nobles for the 1887 session in his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and for the 1890 session in his position as Minister of Finance. Both positions were appointments of KalƒÅkaua. When Lili ªuokalani ascended to the throne upon the death of KalƒÅkaua, she demanded the resignation of his entire cabinet. Death Brown remained in business for many years in Hawaii, as an officer with both the Hawaiian Electric Company and the Hawaiian Bell Telephone Company. In 1894, he replaced Samuel Mills Damon as manager of a Honolulu bank when a San Francisco company acquired the bank's shares from founder Charles Reed Bishop. He spent his final years in England, and died there in 1928 at the age of 90.

The series was produced by HBO Sports and promoted by Don King. It ended with Mike Tyson as undisputed champion, holding the championship belts of the International Boxing Federation, World Boxing Association, and World Boxing Council. Background Prior to the series, the last undisputed heavyweight champion had been Leon Spinks, who won the championship in his 1978 victory over Muhammad Ali. Spinks had been stripped of his WBC title later that year because he opted not to fight against a mandatory challenger; the heavyweight championship had been fragmented ever since. This fragmentation and the resulting proliferation of title fights was seen by many as a discredit to the sport, and resulted in declining public interest in boxing. The idea of the series originated in October 1985, when Don King visited HBO Sports president Seth Abraham to propose a WBC title fight between Pinklon Thomas and Trevor Berbick. Abraham had little interest in the fight, but, inspired by the World Series that was being televised at the time, he suggested making the fight the first in a series to unify the heavyweight titles. King and Abraham mapped out the seven fights that would constitute the series, which King estimated could be produced for $20 million. King and HBO announced the series on January 17, 1986, during a press conference before a fight between Tim Witherspoon and Tony Tubbs. That fight was seen as an unofficial prelude to the series, as the winner would hold the WBA title and would participate in the series. The series would also include WBC champion Pinklon Thomas, IBF champion Michael Spinks, and top contenders from each of the three sanctioning bodies' rankings. The organizers were hopeful that Mike Tyson, then a young, fresh face, would qualify for the tournament and generate excitement for what was otherwise seen by some analysts as an unappealing slate of fighters.

Aftermath Michael Spinks had been stripped of his IBF title in the middle of the tournament because he had accepted a lucrative offer to fight Gerry Cooney, instead of facing his mandatory challenger, Tony Tucker. Spinks, however, was still recognized as the lineal champion (which he had not lost in the ring) and was also considered to be The Ring magazine heavyweight champion. Following the unification series, there were ongoing calls for Tyson, the champion of all three major sanctioning bodies, and Spinks, the lineal champion, to fight and erase any doubt about the identity of the \\"true\\" champion. In June 1988, the two champions faced off, and Tyson knocked out Spinks in 91 seconds. Tyson held on to his titles until February 1990, when he was knocked out by Buster Douglas. The titles remained unified until December 1992, when undisputed champion Riddick Bowe relinquished his WBC title.

In the west of the locality is the Cardwell Range with peaks to 1170 metres; part of this land is within the Tully Falls National Park. In the north is the Maalan National Park. Maalan Road is the main route through the locality.  History  In 1950 the Millaa Millaa branch of the Queensland Dairymen's Association proposing opening up the land in Maalan for farming. The Minister for Lands responded that the land had valuable cabinet timbers which would be sold and removed before opening up the land for sale. In June 1952 the Surveyor General of Queensland, John Percival Harvey, inspected the area. In November 1952, the Queensland Government proposed releasing of land in Maalan. In April 1953, 36 blocks each of approximately 240 acres were sold to intending dairy farmers. In September 1953 the selectors were busy clearing the land with a number of them already living on their blocks. In October 1953 the Maalan settlers met to negotiate a route for the supply of their milk and cream to the factory at Millaa Millaa. In November 1953 a bush fire brigade was formed at Maalan. In April 1954, the Maalan settlers were praised for their efforts in pioneering this new district. In November 1954 plans to commence dairying in the district were delayed by a plague of grasshoppers which ate the newly established dairy pastures.

It's widely acknowledged as first example of higher learning in the world history. The University was particularly renowned for science, especially medicine, and the arts, but both religious and secular subjects were taught, and even subject such as archery or astrology. Students come from distant parts of India. Many Jataka of early Buddhist literature mention students attending the University. It is believed that over 10,000 students from China, Babylon, Syria and Greece in addition to Indian students studied there.https://www.hellotravel.com/stories/top-5-oldest-universities-around- world The Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley made Taxila a part of the Achaemenid Empire. The Persian conquest probably made Taxila University a very cosmopolitan environment in which numerous cultures and ethnicities could exchange their knowledge. The role of Taxila University as a center of knowledge continued under the Maurya Empire and Greek rule (Indo-Greeks) in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. The destruction of Toramana in the 5th century CE seem to have put an end to the activities of the University.

Several contemporaries, and close followers, of the Buddha are said to have studied in Achaemenid Taxila: King Pasenadi of Kosala, a close friend of the Buddha, Bandhula, the commander of Pasedani's army, A·πÖgulimƒÅla, a close follower of the Buddha, and Jivaka, court doctor at Rajagriha and personal doctor of the Buddha. According to Stephen Batchelor, the Buddha may have been influenced by the experiences and knowledge acquired by some of his closest followers in the foreign capital of Taxila. ;Story of Angulimala as a student in Taxila A Buddhist story about A·πÖgulimƒÅla (also called Ahi·πÉsaka, and later a close follower of Buddha), relates how his parents send him to Taxila to study under a well-known teacher. There he excels in his studies and becomes the teacher's favorite student, enjoying special privileges in his teacher's house. However, the other students grow jealous of Ahi·πÉsaka's speedy progress and seek to turn his master against him. To that end, they make it seem as though Ahi·πÉsaka has seduced the master's wife. Other famous students or professors =Charaka= Charaka, the Indian \\"father of medicine\\" and one of the leading authorities in Ayurveda, is also said to have studied at Taxila, and practiced there. =PƒÅ·πáini= The great 5th century BCE Indian grammarian PƒÅ·πáini is said to have been born in the northwest, in Shalatula near Attock, not far from Taxila, in what was then a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley, but the ethnicity in his name or the way of his life shows that he was of Indian origin. =Kautilya= Kautilya (also called Chanakya), the influential Prime Minister of the founder of the Mauryan Empire, Chandragupta Maurya, is also said to have been a professor teaching in Taxila. =Chandragupta Maurya= Buddhist literature states that Chandragupta Maurya, the future founder of the Mauryan Empire, though born near Patna (Bihar) in Magadha, was taken by Chanakya for his training and education to Taxila, and had him educated there in \\"all the sciences and arts\\" of the period, including military sciences. There he studied for eight years. The Greek and Hindu texts also state that Kautilya (Chanakya) was a native of the northwest Indian subcontinent, and Chandragupta was his resident student for eight years. These accounts match Plutarch's assertion that Alexander the Great met with the young Chandragupta while campaigning in the Punjab.\\"Sandrocottus, when he was a stripling, saw Alexander himself, and we are told that he often said in later times that Alexander narrowly missed making himself master of the country, since its king was hated and despised on account of his baseness and low birth\\".

Life Adams earned a degree from Bedford College, London, with second-class honours in mathematics in 1911. Her work as an inspector was centred on the West Country and particularly Bristol; she retired from the inspectorate in 1950. She joined the Mathematical Association in approximately 1915, and was a member for 51 years; she became a member of the Teaching Sub-Committee of the Mathematical Association in 1946, of which she became Chairman in 1954 and remained a member until her death. She was also a member of the Applications, Arithmetic and Secondary Modern Sub- Committees. When she became president of the Mathematical Association in 1959, she became only the second woman to hold that office since the association's founding in 1871, after Mary Cartwright in 1951, and the second HMI, after W. C. Fletcher in 1939. She died in 1965. Contributions Adams had \\"considerable experience as a teacher and inspector\\" and wrote her book, A Background to Primary School Mathematics (1953), on the basis of that experience. It was aimed at teachers of primary-school mathematics, and used case studies from approximately 80 students to advocate linking the teaching of mathematics to the individual experiences of the students. Her book \\"inspired many teachers\\" and prefigured a greater emphasis on play with mathematical tools over rote learning. As a member of the Teaching Sub- Committee of the Mathematical Association, Adams helped shift the association's focus \\"from teaching to learning\\" and from what should be taught to how it should be taught, and promoted the inclusion of primary as well as secondary education within the project's scope. Both her book and her presidential address to the Mathematical Association were a major impetus to the reform of mathematical education in the UK, as was the Teaching Sub- Committee's 1955 report The Teaching of Mathematics in Primary Schools, which she was instrumental in writing.

The game was released on December 20, 2018 in Japan, December 21, 2018 in Europe and Australia and January 4, 2019 in North America. Fitness Boxing is the successor to the Shape Boxing series for the Wii. A new entry, Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm and Exercise, will release on Nintendo Switch in December 2020. Gameplay The gameplay involves using the Joy-Con motion controllers to perform punches and dodging maneuvers. The workouts recommend a full body stretching exercise both at the start and end of the workouts. The difficulty and complexity of the workouts increase gradually over time. Free exercises are always available, regardless of if daily workout has been completed or not. The score for each exercise (excluding the stretches) is determined by how precise the player is in performing their punches and maneuvers. Fitness Boxing comes with charts that determines estimated fitness age and calorie burn based on the height and weight of the player. The game will periodically request the player to update their height and weight. The routine, length and intensity of daily workouts can be adjusted by the player at any time. The default coach is Lin, and there is a total of 5 other coaches (3 female and 2 male), each with customizable appearances. New costumes can be unlocked by performing achievements. The coaches demonstrate every maneuver involved in each exercise, making them a visual guide for maintaining rhythm. They also provide the players tips both during and outside of the exercises. =Playlist= Fitness Boxing contains a playlist of instrumental versions of popular pop songs that is played with each workout exercise.

In late- September 2018, Imagineer revealed the release date of Fitness Boxing for Japan and in early-October 2018, Nintendo revealed the release date of Fitness Boxing for North America and Europe as well as screenshots of game play. In late-October 2018, Imagineer revealed the track listing for Fitness Boxing and uploaded the first game play video of Fitness Boxing to their YouTube Channel.  Release and promotion  On November 29, 2018, a Fitness Boxing demo was released on the European Nintendo eShop for the Switch and a demo was released on the North American eShop on December 13, 2018. Fitness Boxing was released both digitally and physically on December 20, 2018 in Japan, December 21, 2018 in Europe and Australia and January 4, 2019 in North America. On January 15, 2019, Nintendo held a promotional event for Fitness Boxing at Nintendo New York, which included a group of women led by Instagram fitness influencer Niki Klasnic playing the game. Reception Fitness Boxing received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics according to Metacritic with a current Metascore of 66/100. Nintendo Life gave Fitness Boxing a 8/10; calling it \\"no substitute for hard hours at the gym\\", but still recommended the game as a workout regimen for being energetic, entertaining, and cheaper than a gym membership. Nintendo World Report gave Fitness Boxing a 7.5/10; praising it for having multiple exercises for various skill levels, but criticized the limited number of musical tracks. Nintendo Wire gave Fitness Boxing a 7.0/10, praising it for having a \\"decent selection of punches to throw\\" and for allowing the user to track their progress day-to-day, but criticized the game for its \\"lack of variety\\" and for having \\"repetitive music and trainer dialog\\". DualShockers gave Fitness Boxing a 6.5/10, saying that the game \\"just suffers from feeling inaccurate, even more so when punches and dodges aren‚Äôt correctly registered by the Joy-Cons\\", but praised the game for being \\"perfect for those who want to lead a healthy and active lifestyle\\". Destructoid gave Fitness Boxing a 7/10, saying that \\"There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.\\" Reno Gazette-Journal gave Fitness Boxing a 6/10, saying that \\"Fitness Boxing works great as a fitness app but not so much as a game.\\" = Sales = From January 7, 2019 to January 13, Fitness Boxing placed 20th on Japanese sales charts, selling 3,024 physical copies during that period. In February 2019, Fitness Boxing started experiencing shortages in Japan. In September 2020, Imagineer announced that the game had sold over 1 million copies worldwide.

History The paper was founded by printer William Bradford in 1725. Though it was first, it was not distinguished. Historian Frank Luther Mott has described the paper as a \\"small two-page paper, poorly printed, and containing chiefly foreign news from three to six months old, state papers, lists of ships entered and cleared, and a few advertisements.\\" Bradford had been a printer in Philadelphia, and he was induced to move to New York in 1693 to become the public printer. He was in his 60s when he first issued the weekly Gazette in early November 1725,Lee, James Melvin. History of American Journalism, pp. 36-39 (1917) (some sources claim the Gazette began publication in October 1725, and although there are no extant copies of the earliest issues, Lee points to later references in the paper which reflect that it began publishing in November 1725) and he supported the provincial governor William Cosby upon which his livelihood depended. Public discontent with some of Cosby's actions (which the Gazette would not touch) led to the founding of a second newspaper in the province in 1733, The New York Weekly Journal. The printer of that paper was Bradford's former apprentice John Peter Zenger, who the governor sued for libel, but was acquitted at trial. This was a critical incident in the development of the American conception of the freedom of the press.The Early History of Newspaper Publishing in New York State, NYSED.gov, Retrrieved 9 October 2018Crown v. John Peter Zenger, Historial Society of the New York Court, Retrieved 9 October 2018Hudson, Frederic. Journalism in the United States, from 1690-1872, pp. 72-73 (1873) Bradford remained neutral over the case, and defended himself in a statement in the Gazette in 1736, though acknowledging that he had felt compelled at times to print observations favorable to the Governor, which had caused anger from Zenger and others. Subscriptions to the paper do not seem to have been plentiful. In the June 17, 1728 issue, Bradford appealed for more subscribers, and for delinquent accounts to pay up, reporting that he had lost 35 pounds on the paper in the two and half-years since starting the venture.Wall, Alexander J., Jr. William Bradford, Colonial Printer: A Tercentenary Review, in American Antiquarian Society (October 1963) Over its history the paper varied in length, rising from an initial two pages to four pages, and occasionally running as high as six pages. The Gazette ceased publication November 1744 upon Bradford's retirement. Henry De Forest had been co-publishing the paper in its later years with Bradford, and he continued a paper under the title New-York Evening Post, which likely lasted until late 1752 or early 1753 (and is no relation to the current New York Post founded in 1801).Eighteenth- Century American Newspapers in the Library of Congress, Library of Congress, Retrieved 9 October 2018 (the U.S. Library of Congress records state: \\"The last issue located is that of Dec. 18, 1752, soon after which the paper probably ceased publication.\\") Other Gazettes After De Forest dropped the Gazette title, others took it on, though without any official connection. This can cause confusion in newspaper bibliographies. The first to take the name was James Parker, another former Bradford apprentice, although he had fled his indenture early. In 1743 he had founded the Weekly Post Boy with backing from Benjamin Franklin, to compete with Bradford. In 1747, he renamed his paper The New-York Gazette, revived in the Weekly Post-Boy. William Weyman joined Parker as a partner in 1753.Brigham, Clarence S.

It was founded in California first as simply WIRE in 1992, an acronym that stood for Women's Information Resource & Exchange, and could be accessed via telnet for a subscription. Women's WIRE was conceived of by self-taught computer programmer, Nancy Rhine and then co- founded with entrepreneur, Ellen Pack. Later, Women's WIRE migrated to the World Wide Web and became known as Women.com. The site drew millions of visitors a month, with around 300,000 visitors per day. It provided users with email access, community functions such as chatrooms and forums, access to news, advice, and information. In the dot.com bubble of 1999, Women's WIRE began to suffer financial losses and was eventually acquired by iVillage in 2001.  History  Nancy Rhine had imagined creating a women's space online in the early 1990s. Rhine and Pack met at the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (The WELL), where Rhine worked as the site's co-director. Pack's first experience going online had happened in 1991, and while she enjoyed the experience, Pack noticed that there was a lack of women's voices online. When Pack posted on The WELL about starting a network for women online, Rhine contacted her about her idea. Pack and Rhine worked together to develop and launch Women's WIRE in 1992. WIRE stood for Women's Information Resource & Exchange. Pack helped provide the funds of $100,000 she raised from family and friends, and Rhine, who was a self-taught computer expert, developed the site. They also involved a Silicon Valley consultant, Marleen McDaniel. When Rhine and Pack began the project, a male representative warned them against creating Women's WIRE, saying \\"there wasn't a market for women\\". Ignoring his advice, Women's WIRE became the first Internet company to target women, launching in October 1993 with 500 members. At first the organization was only known as WIRE and had secured the address wire.net. However, Wired Magazine felt that this was too close to their name and the address they used which was wired.com. The two groups agreed to settle out of court with Wired agreeing to help pay half of migration costs to a new address and WIRE agreeing to change their name to Women's WIRE. Rhine said the decision to settle was based on money so that Women's WIRE could focus on growing their business. At first, Women's WIRE was run out of Pack's home. At the time, it was the only \\"online service focused on women\\". Later, they moved to an office space in South San Francisco with an all-women staff. 1994, users, 90% of whom were women, paid $15 a month to access Women's WIRE. Also in 1994, Women's WIRE promoted McDaniel to the role of president of the organization where McDaniel helped transition the site to the Internet. As the Internet grew, Women's WIRE became Women.com in 1995. Women's WIRE migrated to a space on CompuServe and to the web address Women.com. They moved the offices from San Francisco to San Mateo. Rhine left the organization in 1996 to develop content for women at America Online. It became a \\"one-stop Web portal where women could network\\" and more. By 1996, Women's WIRE employees created content that was seen by 300,000 visitors a month. The site was supported by advertising. In 2000, approximately 80% of the site's revenue came from advertising alone. and In 1997, Pack authored a book, Women's Wire Web Directory, to help women navigate online spaces and to get them involved in Women's WIRE. By 1999, they were supported by sponsors including Microsoft, Toyota, IBM, Hallmark and Bloomberg. and Early in 1999, Women.com also took over HomeArts.com, part of Hearst Corporation. In 1999, however, stock prices fell significantly in the dot-com crash, and Women.com was purchased by iVillage in 2001. The purchase deal, which included cash and stock, was worth $47 million and merged Women.com and iVillage. The merger itself created \\"the world's largest and most comprehensive destination for women on the web\\" at the time.  Content  Women's WIRE was developed to \\"become an international communications network focused on women's issues.\\" Content on the site changed frequently to keep readers interested. The site had \\"pleasing but spare graphics,\\" according to Entertainment Weekly in 1996, and it loaded quickly. Sections of the site included questions from readers. Women's WIRE provided links to job listings also provided sources that could help women develop their careers and job hunting skills. The site was also known for having a sense of humor about the topics that it covered. As the 1996 Summer Olympic Games came up, Women's WIRE joined with Women's Sports + Fitness to provided coverage of the event and also included articles about fitness, training and sports. Women's WIRE, now known as Women.com, had continued to expand their range of content in 1999 in order to bring in more visitors to the site. Women.com had exclusive partnerships to display material from Hearst magazines. Women.com also added content from Harlequin Books to their site in 1999. and Plans to allow users to purchase books direction from the publisher through Women.com were also underway. By 2000, there were over 100,000 pages of content provided by Women.com. They also offered newsletters and the ability for users to create their own homepage. Additionally, Women's WIRE provided a sense of community to users. It was a place where women could share their concerns and find advice about their problems from other women. Resources relating to help for domestic abuse were also available. Women were able to mobilize politically through Women's WIRE, sharing information and encouraging women to call politicians. The site was more radical early on, reflecting the preferences of co-founder Nancy Rhine, who wanted to emphasize community and feminist principles.  Technology  When Women's WIRE started, it was a subscriber-based online service with around 1,300 subscribers. Women's WIRE was initially run on software called First Class BBS. Women logged in either using a local number in San Francisco or used telnet. If users needed help connecting to Women's WIRE, they could receive support from their own customer service. In 1994, Rhine and co-founder Ellen Pack had to make a decision about moving to the World Wide Web. On October 1995, Women's WIRE switched over to CompuServe. Women's WIRE was now on version 2.6 and users could access the site using a diskette and CompuServe. Version 2.6 provided client access via CompuServe and a dial-up connection.

Salt Houses follows the story of four generations of the fictional Palestinian middle-class family, the Yacoubs. Beginning in 1963 and concluding in 2014, Alyan details the family's journey through the Six Day War (1967), the First Intifada (1987), the Gulf War (1990), the Second Intifada (2000), 9/11 (2001), and the 2006 Lebanon War. Each chapter of the book follows a different member of the Yacoub family as they progress through the years, reading more like a collection of short stories that provide a holistic perspective. While this unique structure was largely praised, some reviews point out that it resulted in a lack of character development. Alyan is generally praised for providing a perspective into the plight of the privileged as opposed to focusing solely on Palestinians who live in refugee camps. The story focuses on migration and the struggle between staying connected with one's traditions and still finding a home in a new country.  Plot  The story begins with Salma in Nablus, 1963. As her daughter Alia prepares for her wedding to Atef, Salma reads her future in a cup of coffee dregs. Though Salma reads a life full of uncertainty, instability, travel, and loss, she keeps the negative to herself, telling Alia that she sees a quick pregnancy and Atef's love for her. The Yacoubs are a middle-class family who are already dispersed when the novel begins as Salma was from Jaffa, but had to flee to Nablus following WWII and Widad, Salma's very religious oldest daughter, is living in Kuwait in an arranged marriage. Mustafa, the youngest of Salma's three children, struggles with his faith despite finding a strong community in his mosque. An eloquent speaker, Mustafa uses his talent to mobilize other young Palestinians by speaking of rebellion and anger. As he is best friends with Atef, Salma worries about the influence the two have on each other as they both turn to extremism. Though Mustafa's love for a working-class girl, Aya, could provide him a way out, his fear of disappointing his mother by marrying beneath their class leads him to devote himself entirely to his cause. In the 1967 Six-Day War, the family is uprooted to Kuwait City, though Atef and Mustafa stay behind to fight. Both men are arrested and tortured during which Atef gives up Mustafa, resulting in Mustafa's death in an Israeli jail. Though the family never recovers Mustafa's body or learns what truly happened to him, Atef blames himself for Mustafa's death and is overwhelmed by guilt which results in his downward spiral caused by PTSD and depression when he joins Alia in Kuwait. In Kuwait City, Atef becomes withdrawn and spends most of his time writing letters that he will never send to his late best friend in an attempt to process his emotions and spare Alia's. Though Alia is less affected by her brother's death, she hates the heat and unfamiliarity of the new city, and the fact that they are unable to return to their home. However, Alia and Atef, still full of love for each other, attempt to create a happy life and have three children: Riham, Souad, and Karam. In the increasingly globalized world, Atef worries deeply about the influence of the West on his children, though the couple still sends the three children to international schools for a better education. The family is uprooted yet again at the start of the Gulf War (1990) and is dispersed with Alia and Atef moving to Amman, Jordan and then Beirut, Lebanon, Riham living in Amman with her husband, Latif, and Souad and Karam attending university in Paris, France and Boston, United States, respectively. Due to her close relationship with her grandmother, Salma, Riham is deeply religious. Her and her generous doctor husband, Latif, remain in Amman and care for poor patients and refugees in their shed. Though Riham wants to support this, she is traumatized by the cries of the injured at all hours and ends up somewhat resenting their generosity. Even more rebellious than her mother, Souad has a whirlwind marriage to Elie and has two children, Manar and Zain, who grow up completely Americanized in the United States. Karam marries Budur and they raise one child, Linah, who is best friends with Zain. Though they are so dispersed, the family attempts to convene for summers with Alia and Atef in Beirut, and Riham and Latif eventually relocate there. Zain, Manar, and Linah face racism against Arabs in the United States following 9/11, and, during their summers in Beirut, face racism against Palestinians. When visiting Beirut, the children witness war and violence as well. The story ends with Souad, following her divorce from Elie, moving her family to Lebanon and Zain and Linah finding Atef's old letters to Mustafa. The grandchildren of Alia and Atef try to discover their family's history as Manar attempts to feel a connection to her Palestinian heritage by traveling to Jaffa. Alia is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and, as she deteriorates, longs for a feeling of belonging and home.  Characters  *Salma is the matriarch of the Yacoub family and a religiously devout wife to Hussam and mother to three children Widad, Alia, and Mustafa. *Hussam is the husband of Salma and father of Widad, Alia, and Mustafa. *Mustafa is the youngest child of Salma and Hussam. As a representation of \\"the young man in a rudderless moment, looking for anything that will point him north\\", Mustafa finds security in the mosque, though this connection causes Mustafa to turn to extremism. During the Six Day War, Mustafa is arrested, tortured, and killed in an Israeli jail. *Widad is the oldest child of Salma and Hussam. She is described as conservative, quiet, and very committed to Islam. Widad is a young bride in an arranged marriage which moves her to Kuwait. *Alia is the middle child of Salma and Hussam. Her rebellious and head-strong nature quickly makes her the focal point of the novel with the story primarily focusing on her and her husband, their children, and their grandchildren. Alia defies her very religious mother by refusing to wear a hijab and often involves herself in conversations about war and other generally male-dominated conversations. She is mother to Riham, Souad, and Karam and favors Karam. *Atef is the husband of Alia and the best friend of Mustafa. Atef shared Mustafa's activist ideology and fought with him in the Six Day War. He was arrested and tortured in the war and, though he was released and moved safely to Amman with Alia, he struggled PTSD and depression. He is father to Riham, Souad, and Karam and favors Riham. *Riham, the eldest daughter of Alia and Atef, is very close with her grandmother, Salma. This leads her to live a very religiously devout life and get married at a young age to an older widower, Latif. She becomes the stepmother of Latif's son, Abdullah, and attempts to live a rather quiet life close to her parents in Amman. *Latif is the husband of Riham. A quiet and generous doctor, Latif opens their home in Amman to injured refugees and patients to provide them free care in their shed. *Abdullah is the son of Latif and the stepson of Widad. Similarly to Mustafa and Atef, Abdullah was filled with frustration towards the occupation of Palestine and flirted with extremism though never acted upon it. He expressed his frustration with his family for not being angry enough to fight for Palestine. *Souad is the youngest daughter of Alia and Atef and is characterized as rebellious, unruly, and fearless. Though she and Alia constantly quarrel, Atef consistently highlights the similarities between the two strong and independent women. Souad is studying in Paris at the start of the Gulf War and impulsively marries her then-boyfriend, Elie. They ultimately move to Boston to live near her brother, Karam, where they have two children and then divorce. Souad later moves with her children to Beirut where Alia and Atef live. *Elie is the husband, and later ex-husband, of Souad. Their whirlwind romance and marriage closely follows the start of the Gulf War that affected both Souad and Elie, whose families lived in Kuwait. Elie is described as the one person more volatile than Souad. *Zain is the son of Souad and Elie. He grows up very Americanized and is best friends with Karam's daughter, Linah. *Manar is the daughter of Souad and Elie. Like her brother, she also grows up Americanized. *Karam is the son of Alia and Atef, husband of Budur, and father of Linah. After moving to Boston for university, Karam stays there for much of his life and returns only to visit his family. He is described as quiet and kind. *Budur is the wife of Karam and mother to Linah. *Linah is the daughter of Karam and Budur and best friend of Zain, Souad's son. She's characterized as curious and adventurous, though it is from her perspective that readers see the racism and violence that the children experience.  Context  = Global refugee and migration crisis = According to the United Nations, the world is currently facing \\"the worst migration crisis since World War II\\". This makes the story of the Yacoub family very relevant as it communicates a personalized story of those who must leave their homes, but do not reside in refugee camps. In an Al-Jazeera interview, Alyan said that \\"the Trump era has amplified issues that have always existed... in that sense, I'm happy this book has come out in an era of literal and psychological borders\\". The Yacoubs provide an insight into the mental and emotional ramifications of the migration crisis as opposed to the physical impacts that are generally emphasized in popular discussion.  Response  The book was published in 2017 by Mariner Books and has been named a best book of the year by NPR, Nylon, Kirkus Reviews, Bustle, and BookPage.

Nikolay Belyaev served as a treasurer of the newly-founded Alexandrinsky Community of Sisters of Mercy named after Empress Alexandra Feodorovna under the Committee of Christian Relief of the Russian Red Cross Society, which organized a comprehensive system of nursing services throughout Russia. For his services to the community, Nikolay Belyaev was awarded the Order of St. Anna and the Order of St. Stanislaus of the 3rd class. In 1893, he became in 1896 a , and in 1900 a State Councillor. He also participated in the Committee for assistance to the poorest students of the 4th Moscow Gymnasium. Entrepreneurship Together with similar-minded entrepreneurs, he founded and later chaired the Society for the construction and operation of the Upper Volga Railway which built and ran a railway line in the north of Moscow on a private basis. Nikolay Belyaev was one of the initiators of the creation of the railway, which was an alternative to the upper Volga river route. For a rapidly developing industry and trade in forests, more reliable and high-speed transport was required. Thus, the idea of building a railway was strongly supported by the regional officials and by entrepreneurs. The railway was constructed in 1914-1918 (Savyolovo ‚Äì Kalyasin, Kalyazin ‚Äì Kashin), and later finished in the 1930s (Kalyazin ‚Äì Uglich). Once privately owned, this railway is now part of the October Railway and connects Moscow with Kalyazin and Uglich. Nikolay Belyaev was also a member of the jewelry trading house D.P.&M.; Frolov and of the Moscow Automobile Society, organizing public car races and developing early traffic regulations. He owned one of the first Mercedes Benz automobiles in Moscow. As liberal-minded and a member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, Nikolay Belyaev aimed to reform the Russian state as a candidate for the Moscow City Duma, supported the Provisional Government. The February Revolution proved to be a severe challenge for him and his family. While some members of the family fought in the White Army and heavily engaged in anti-bolshevik activities (and subsequently fled the country), others stayed and suffered repressions, and finally successfully adapted for the new regime. On 15 February 1920, Nikolay Belyaev died under unknown circumstances in the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius. Nikolay Belyaev was the last owner of the Golovin estate on Potapovsky Lane in Moscow.

The story traces her 28 days spent in a spa in Kerala and her meeting with her former husband. Khanna said that the novel's title came to her as she struggled to zip up her jeans after a few weeks of Diwali. Reception Nayare Ali of the Asian Age said that Twinkle Khanna‚Äôs books resonate with her readers, because she has this wonderful knack of tying up the loose ends and ensuring that her characters find salvation at the end of the book‚Äôs journey. 'What could have been a story about an embittered woman, jilted by her dissolute husband, turns into a romp, thanks to Khanna‚Äôs gift for observing the absurdities of life' states the Mint.

If there was ever a book about women, here and now, then it is this, Twinkle Khanna's first novel and third book, Pyjamas Are Forgiving(Juggernaut).

She was launched in February 1943 and completed in May that year, serving for the rest of the Second World War. She took part in the Normandy Landings in June 1944, supporting the landings at Omaha Beach and the Pointe du Hoc. Post war she served in the Mediterranean before being reduced to reserve at the end of 1947. She was sold for scrap in 1961, with disposal completed by 1962. Construction HMS Talybont was ordered for the Royal Navy from the shipbuilder J. Samuel White on 23 August 1940, one of 15 Type III Hunt-class destroyers ordered as part of the 1940 War Emergency Programme on that date. The Hunt class was meant to fill the Royal Navy's need for a large number of small destroyer-type vessels capable of both convoy escort and operations with the fleet. The Type III Hunts differed from the previous Type II ships in replacing a twin 4-inch gun mount by two torpedo tubes to improve their ability to operate as destroyers. Talybont was laid down at White's Cowes, Isle of Wight shipyard on 28 November 1941. German air raids on the shipyard slowed construction of the ship, with Talybont not being launched until 3 February 1943 and commissioning on 19 May that year. Talybont was long between perpendiculars and overall. The ship's beam was and draught . Displacement was standard and under full load. Two Admiralty boilers raising steam at and fed Parsons single-reduction geared steam turbines that drove two propeller shafts, generating at 380 rpm. This gave a speed of . of oil fuel were carried, giving a range of at . Main gun armament was four 4 inch (102 mm) QF Mk XVI dual purpose (anti-ship and anti-aircraft) guns in two twin mounts, with a quadruple 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" and three Oerlikon 20 mm cannon providing close-in anti-aircraft fire. The ship's anti-aircraft armament may have been supplemented by two Bofors 40 mm guns. Two torpedo tubes were fitted in a single twin mount, while two depth charge chutes, four depth charge throwers and 70 depth charges comprised the ship's anti-submarine armament. Type 291 and Type 285 radars was fitted, as was Type 128 sonar. Service Talybont commissioned with the pennant number L18, and after work-up was allocated to the 15th Destroyer Flotilla based at Devonport, joining the Flotilla on 12 July 1943. On 22 October 1943, Talybont, together with sister ships , and , the destroyers and and the light cruiser set out from Plymouth to intercept the German blockade runner M√ºnsterland. Early on 23 October the British force encountered a force of German torpedo boats of the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla (, , , and ). In the resulting confrontation, T23 and T27 torpedoed and sunk Charybdis, while T22 torpedoed Limbourne, blowing off much of the front of the ship. Attempts by Talybont to take Limbourne under tow failed, and the badly damaged escort destroyer was scuttled by torpedoes from Talybont and shellfire from Rocket. Talybont collided with a merchant ship on 2 December 1943 and was under repair for a month. On 5 February 1944, Talybont, , and Wensleydale engaged the and the minesweepers and off the coast of Brittany. M156 was badly damaged and was then sunk the next day by British Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers of No. 266 Squadron RAF at Aber Wrac'h. The Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944 saw Talybont assigned to the support forces for the American landings at Omaha Beach. On the morning of 6 June she and the American destroyer provided artillery support for an assault by US Rangers at Pointe du Hoc which had the aim of knocking out a German coastal artillery position. Talybont and Satterlee operated at close range (within , with Talybont at one stage using her pom-poms against German machine gun positions) to support the landings. Talybont operated in support of the Rangers at Pont du Hoc from 05:30 hr to 07:10 hr. On 17 June Talybont was on patrol off Cherbourg when she was damaged by a near miss from German shore batteries (claimed to be from a 170 mm shell) rupturing a steam pipe and knocking out a boiler room. She was under repair for six days. On 25 June she was released to convoy escort duties in the English Channel. On the night of 23/24 August 1944, Talybont, together with the Frigate and Motor torpedo boats MTB 692, MTB 694 and MTB 695 intercepted a force of German light craft evacuating from Le Havre. The German motor minesweeper (or R-boat) R229 and patrol boat V716 were damaged. Talybont transferred to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla based at Harwich for operations in the North Sea in October 1944. On 9 November 1944 she was in collision with a merchant ship and was holed on the port side aft. She was under repair for two months before returning to patrol and escort duties. The end of the war in Europe in May 1945 resulted in Talybont being allocated for service in the Far East. She was refitted at Malta from July 1945 to prepare her for service in the Pacific, and was still under refit when VJ-Day signalled the end of the war. =Post war service= On completion of the refit, Talybont joined the Mediterranean Fleet, and patrolled off the coast of Palestine to stop ships carrying illegal Jewish migrants. On 26 June 1946, Talybont, together with the destroyer intercepted the steamer Josiah Wedgewood, formerly the Canadian corvette , carrying 1250 Jewish refugees. On 19 January 1947 Talybont collided with a wreck in Haifa harbour, and was under repair at Malta until May that year. She was reduced to reserve at Portsmouth by the end of 1947, and remained in reserve at various ports around the British Isles for the rest of her career. She was used as a harbour training ship at Rosyth between 1958 and 1960. On 14 February 1961 she arrived at Charlestown for breaking up, with scrapping complete by 3 May 1962, with a scrap value of ¬£19,950.

The festival was created in 1976 by Christian Mousset in Angoul√™me, France. In 2015, the American author Eddy L.Harris took over as president of the festival.  History  Musiques M√©tisses was originally named \\"Jazz en France\\" and was first devoted to jazz, French, and European improvised music. The festival quickly began to integrate popular and urban music from Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Indian Ocean. It was the first event in France to highlight artists from the country's colonial territories, whose audience was limited, until then, to the DOM-TOM's audience. In 1985, the festival was renamed \\"Musiques M√©tisses.\\" The festival played a pioneering role by showcasing the richness and diversity of current music of the South and its importance in the \\"world sound.\\" Many internationally renowned musicians made their French stage debut in Angoul√™me. Some well-known performers include Salif Keita, Johnny Clegg, Bonga, Geoffrey Oryema, Khaled, Cheb Mami, Cesaria Evora, Compay Segundo, Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, Danyel Waro, Rokia Traore, Kassav, Doudou N'diaye Rose, Ismael Lo, Fal Frett, Elida Almeida and many more. The purpose of the festival is to showcase and support diversity and cultural blending. The festival facilitates the circulation of artists, contributes to the enrichment of musical colours by promoting exchange, meeting, and creation, and supports and develops the careers of young, emerging performers. In 1999, the festival expanded to include literary meetings called \\"Litt√©ratures M√©tisses\\" during the festival. The literary programming is led by Bernard Magnier, director of the Africa collection at the publishing house Actes Sud. In 2015, Eddy L. Harris, a 10-year resident of Charente, was named the new president of the festival. He took over the presidency with the intention of saving the festival from a deficit through a 9-year turnaround plan.

The most important monuments were the tomb of Cimon Coalemos (together with his horses, winners of the Olympics) and of the historian Thucydides.Marcellinus, Life of Thucydides 17.55 Following these sources, many historians thought that the deme was, at least in part, outside the city walls, since Cicero had written that it was illegal to bury the dead inside the walls. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that only a small part of the deme, that containing the tombs, developed outside the walls. The deme had its own agora. In the Hellenistic period a wall was built to reinforce the defenses of the city through the deme, which was abandoned and used, in Roman times, as a cemetery.

Early life and education  Christine Downing was born in 1931 in Leipzig, Germany. Her mother, Herta Fischer Rosenblatt, was a pharmacist, poet, and co- founder of the Haiku Society of America. Her father, Dr. E. F. Rosenblatt, was a professor of Chemistry at the University of Leipzig. Dr. Rosenblatt, considered Jewish by the Nazi party, lost his professorial appointment in 1933, which prompted the family to emigrate to the United States. In 1935, they settled in New Jersey. Dr. Rosenblatt eventually became president of Engelhard Industries where his laboratory invented the first production catalytic converter in 1973. In 1952, Downing graduated from Swarthmore College with a major in literature. She was the first woman upon whom Drew University bestowed a doctorate, which she earned with a dissertation on the German philosopher and religious scholar, Martin Buber.  Career  In 1963, Downing began teaching in the Religion Department at Rutgers University. In 1974, she transferred to San Diego State University, where she taught for eighteen years, including ten years as Chair of the University's Department of Religious Studies. Also in 1974, Downing became the first woman president of the American Academy of Religion. She delivered her presidential address on ‚ÄúSigmund Freud and the Mythological Tradition.‚Äù While teaching in San Diego, Downing simultaneously served as a core faculty member at the California School of Professional Psychology, inspiring her to obtain a master's degree in family therapy from USIU. In 1994, Downing assisted in the development of the Mythological Studies program at Pacifica Graduate Institute in Santa Barbara, where she remains a core faculty member, teaching courses in Greek and Roman mythologies, Hebrew traditions, and memoir. From 1995 through 2004, she delivered the annual Christine Downing Lectures at San Diego State University. Downing has been recognized for her ability to blend self- reflective, biographical writing with rigorous scholarship. She has examined how Sigmund Freud and C.G. Jung‚Äôs notions of the self and the unconscious have transformed autobiographical thinking and writing and has often followed her own dreams as imperative departure points toward personal and scholarly investigations. Downing has written and lectured extensively about the relationship between the personal and the mythic, especially the psychological significance of Greek goddess mythologies, including those focused on Demeter and Persephone, and women's experience of male gods. In October 2018, Downing received the Distinguished Educator Award from the International Forum for Psychoanalytic Education. Her collection of professional and personal materials is housed at OPUS Archives and Research Center in Santa Barbara, California.  Personal life  From 1951 to 1978, Downing was married to George V. Downing, a career chemist at Merck & Company, Inc. Between 1953 and 1958 they had five children: Peter Stalker Downing, Eric Steele Downing, Scott Drinker Downing, Christopher Lane Downing, and Sandra Leigh Downing. When it became legally possible in 2008, Downing married poet and writer River Malcolm.

Estimated at $23.4 billion, the bill, along with the $1.6 billion from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, would amount to the $25 billion projected to complete the larger and fortified wall.  History  The bill was introduced on October 12, 2018, by then-House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who stated that, in his opinion, \\"President Trump's election was a wake-up call to Washington.\\" He explained that his belief was that \\"the American people want us to build the wall and enforce the law. Maintaining strong borders is one of the basic responsibilities of any nation. For too long, America has failed in this responsibility.\\" The initial bill included several immigration enforcement proposals, funding cuts for sanctuary cities, and easing up the process to deport illegal immigrant gang members. It also included the stalled bill Kate's Law. In February 2019, President Trump launched the National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States to build the wall.

They are understood to originate from the Black Sea area, testifying to the expansiveness of the Silk Road network in the ancient world.  Description  The dagger and sheath are made up of gold, decorated with elaborate, colorful glass and garnet jewel inlays. The treasure is 14 1/8 in. (36 cm) in length and belongs to the Gyeongju National Museum of Korea. It is listed as Korea‚Äôs Treasure No. 635.  History  The Gyerim-ro Dagger and Sheath were excavated from the Gyerim- ro Tomb No. 14 in 1973 in North Gyeongsang Province. The dagger is understood to have originated from the Black Sea area of Central Asia sometime during the 5th century, coming to Korea through trade or as a diplomatic gift. This was determined by comparing the dagger and sheath to other items of similar constructor depiction (through wall paintings and fragments). The dagger has a decorative and functional head at the end of the handle and the sheath has two side appendages. These were used to attach the dagger to the carrier‚Äôs belt, from which it hung horizontally. A deeper understanding of this double- appendage suspension system supports the theory that the Hephthalite invasion of Central Asia brought with it an introduction of the two-point hanging system to (as seen in the Gyerim-ro dagger and sheath), which has since become recognizable as the Eastern Eurasian dagger and sword suspension systems that was carried on from Central Asia to China. The two-point suspension system's arrival in China is likely a result of the Silk Road. Vast scholarship on the Silk Road informs that trade between Central Asia and East Asia was affluent and thriving during the 5th century, and thus the occurrence of a Black Sea area item in a Korean tomb should not come as a surprise.  Influence  Choe Kwang-shik argues that Northern and Western influences are found in Silla art, specifically those from the Scythian nomadic peoples, which provided a direct link between Silla and the coastal area of the Black Sea. Other examples of Scythian influence on the Silla Kingdom include the Bronze Horse-Shaped Buckle and the Silla Crowns. These contain animal motifs characteristic of Scythian art. Korea's connection to the Scythian peoples. This demonstrates Korea's involvement with the Silk Road and provides an explanation for the value of placing a dagger and sheath in a tomb. The Gyerim-ro Dagger and Sheath were likely symbols of social class and the achievements of the person who wore them. Similar to the Sutton Hoo burial site, the purpose of laying someone to rest with their treasured weapon was to signify worth and aspirations for life after death.

Typically found between 200m to 1500m deep below regions of high productivity, such as the western coasts of continents. OMZs can be seasonal following the spring-summer upwelling season. Upwelling of nutrient- rich water leads to high productivity and labile organic matter, that is respired by heterotrophs as it sinks down the water column. High respiration rates deplete the oxygen in the water column to concentrations of 2 mg/l or less forming the OMZ. OMZs are expanding, with increasing ocean deoxygenation. Under these oxygen-starved conditions, energy is diverted from higher trophic levels to microbial communities that have evolved to use other biogeochemical species instead of oxygen, these species include Nitrate, Nitrite, Sulphate etc. Several Bacteria and Archea have adapted to live in these environments by using these alternate chemical species and thrive. The most abundant phyla in OMZs are Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes. In the absence of oxygen, microbes use other chemical species to carry out respiration, in the order of the electrochemical series. With nitrate and nitrite reduction yielding as much energy as oxygen respiration, followed by manganese and iodate respiration and yielding the least amount of energy at the bottom of the series are the iron and sulfate reducers. the utilization of these chemical species by microbes plays an important role in their biogeochemical cycling in the world's oceans.  Life in Anoxic Conditions  = Nitrogen Cycling = Biological productivity (photosynthesis) in marine ecosystems is often limited by the bioavailability of nitrogen. The amount of bioavailable nitrogen (nitrate (NO3‚àí), nitrite (NO2‚àí), and ammonium (NH4+)) depends on the inputs from nitrogen fixation and losses from denitrification and anammox as dinitrogen gas (N2), a compound only accessible to nitrogen- fixing bacteria. N2 production from denitrification and anammox closes the nitrogen cycle by reducing the nitrogen available in organic matter fixed by phytoplankton at the surface ocean. Denitrification in OMZs leads to a significant loss of inorganic nitrogen from the oceans, limiting growth/productivity in many regions around the world. OMZs are known for their role in the global nitrogen cycle. As no oxygen is present to fuel aerobic respiration, anoxic systems are primarily dominated by microbially-mediated nitrogen cycling. N2 fixation is performed by diazotrophs (N2 fixing bacteria and archaea), which convert N2 gas into ammonia (NH3). The amount of N2 fixation and the distribution of diazotrophs in the ocean is determined by the availability of oxygen (O2), light, phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), and organic matter, as well as habitat temperature. N2 fixation has been found in some anoxic systems, generally associated with sulfate reducers or oxidizers. However, heterotrophic denitrification is a more dominant process under anoxic conditions. Denitrification is the reduction of NO3‚àí and NO2‚àí to the gaseous form of nitrogen (N2), including the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Heterotrophic denitrification is a multi-step process that uses organic matter to reduce NO3‚àí to N2 in oxygen-depleted environments like OMZs and sediments. In OMZs, different steps in the denitrification processes are performed by separate groups of bacteria, and these denitrifiers are often found directly on sinking organic matter particles, which are hotspots of microbial activity. The first step of denitrification is nitrate reduction where NO3‚àí is reduced to NO2‚àí by the protein nitrate reductase. Anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (anammox) convert NO2‚àí and NH4+ to N2 using an enzyme called hydrazine oxidoreductase. Genomic studies conducted in these ecosystems reveal a growing abundance of the genes encoding for the proteins responsible for the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and anammox at the core of these OMZs. Such studies provide information to map out the nitrogen cycle and demystify missing links and unexplored pathways in the water column. Anammox is often coupled to denitrification as a source of NH4+ in OMZs or to DNRA in sediments. DNRA has been found to be the dominant process supplying NH4+ near the shelf and upper slope of sediments because of the presence of large bacterial mats made up of the giant sulfur-oxidizing bacteria Thioploca spp. and Beggiatoa spp. which reduce NO3‚àí and/or NO2‚àí to NH4+ using reduced sulfur. Denitrification and anammox account for about 30-50% of the N losses in OMZs, where the total N loss determined by the supply of sinking organic matter available. Additionally, ammonium and nitrite oxidation are key processes in N cycling in anoxic environments. Ammonium oxidation is the first step in nitrification and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) converts NH3 to NO2‚àí. Followed by nitrite oxidation by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), which converts NO2‚àí to NO3‚àí. Ammonium and nitrite oxidizers have a high affinity for O2 and can use nanomolar concentrations of O2 to oxidize ammonium and nitrite. These small concentrations of O2 can be supplied by photosynthesis by Prochlorococcus spp. or by horizontal mixing by jets and eddies. In anoxic environments, the competition between ammonium and nitrite oxidization and anammox and denitrification for ammonium and nitrite play an important role in controlling nitrogen loss in OMZs.  Sources of ammonium for annamox bacteria  Anaerobic ammonium oxidation with nitrite (anammox) is a major pathway of fixed nitrogen removal in the anoxic zones of the open ocean. Anammox requires a source of ammonium, which under anoxic conditions could be supplied by the breakdown of sinking organic matter via heterotrophic denitrification. However, at many locations where anammox is observed, denitrification rates are small or undetectable. Alternative sources of NH4+ than denitrification, such as the DNRA, the diffusion and advection from sulfate-reducing sediments, or from microaerobic remineralization at the boundaries of anoxic waters, can supply NH4+ to anammox bacterial communities, even though it is not yet clear how much they can influence the process. Another source of NH4+, which plays an important role in the N cycle of OMZs by contributing to the decoupling of anammox and denitrification, is the excretion of NH4+ by diel vertically migrating animals. To escape predation, diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton and micronekton can reach the anoxic layers of the major OMZs of the open ocean, and because animals excrete reduced N mostly as NH4+, they can fuel anammox directly and decouple it from denitrification. The downward export of organic matter by migrating zooplankton and micronekton is generally smaller than that of particles at the base of the euphotic zone. However, sinking particles are rapidly consumed with depth, and the active transport by migrators can exceed particle remineralization in deeper layers where animals congregate during the daytime. As a result, inside anoxic waters the excretion of NH4+ by vertically migrating animals could alter the balance between fixed N removal pathways, decoupling anammox and denitrification and enhancing anammox above the values predicted by typical stoichiometry. Methanogenesis cycle with intermediates = Methanogenesis = Sulfate reduction pathway Methanogenesis is the process by which methanogen microbes form methane (CH4). OMZs are know contain the largest amount of methane in the open ocean. Methanogens can also oxidize methane as they have the genes to do so, however this requires oxygen which they obtain from photosynthetic organisms in the upper anoxic zone. Ciliates may also aid methanogens through symbiosis to help facilitate methanogenesis. As ciliates have hydrogenosomes, which release hydrogen molecules under low oxygen conditions, they have the ability to host endosymbiotic methanogens. = Sulfate Reduction = Sulfate reduction, which occurs with the help of sulfate-reducing microorganisms, is used in the cryptic sulfur cycle. This cycle is continuous oxidation and reduction of sulfate and uses sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor rather than oxygen. The cycle was purposed to help contribute to the energy flow to anoxic water off the coast of Chile. = Aerobic Microbial Respiration = Aerobic organisms require oxygen to survive and as oxygen becomes limited in OMZs bacteria begin to use other molecules to oxidize organic matter such as nitrate. Aerobic respiration in OMZs helps remineralize organic matter and is a major source of ammonium for most of the upper oxygen minimal zones. It was also found that bacteria from OMZs use a 1/6 of the oxygen for respiration compared bacteria in normal waters.  Climate Change  While OMZs can occur naturally, they can be exacerbated by human impacts like climate change and land-based pollution from agriculture and sewage. The prediction of current climate models is substantial warming and loss of oxygen throughout the majority of the upper ocean. Global warming increases ocean temperatures, especially in shallow coastal areas, and when water temperature increases, its ability to hold oxygen decreases, leading to oxygen concentrations going down in the water. Nutrients found in both agricultural runoff and sewage can contribute to excessive primary production, creating a bloom, that introduces large quantities of organic carbon which accumulates on the seafloor. This organic carbon is then broken down through respiration, using up the available oxygen in the water. Open ocean areas with no oxygen have grown more than 1.7 million square miles in the last 50 years, and coastal waters have seen a tenfold increase in low-oxygen areas in the same time. Consequences of even a small decrease in oxygen levels can hinder reproduction, growth, and can lead to disease and death in marine animals. If there is enough decrease of oxygen in the water, it could become unlivable for the majority of the organisms living there, resulting in what are commonly called dead zones. Short term effects can be seen in acutely fatal circumstances, but other sublethal consequences can include impaired reproductive ability, reduced growth, and increase in diseased population. These can be attributed to the co-stressor effect. When an organism is already stressed, for example getting less oxygen than it would prefer, it doesn't do as well in other areas of its existence like reproduction, growth, and warding off disease. Additionally, warmer water not only holds less oxygen, but it also causes marine organisms to have higher metabolic rates, resulting in them using up available oxygen more quickly, lowering the oxygen concentration in the water even more and compounding the effects seen. Finally, for some organisms, habitat reduction will be a problem. Habitable zones in the water column are expected to compress and habitable seasons are expected to be shortened. If the water an organism's regular habitat sits in has oxygen concentrations lower than it can tolerate, it won't want to live there anymore. This leads to changed migration patterns as well as changed or reduced habitat area. Long term effects can be seen on a broader scale of changes in biodiversity and food web makeup. Due to habitat change of many organisms, predator-prey relationships will be altered. For example, when squeezed into a smaller well-oxygenated area, predator-prey encounter rates will increase, causing an increase in predation, potentially putting strain on the prey population. Additionally, diversity of ecosystems in general is expected to decrease due to decrease in oxygen concentrations.

The film stars Anthony Mackie, Nicholas Hoult, Nia Long, Jessie T. Usher and Samuel L. Jackson. The story follows Joe Morris (Jackson) and Bernard S. Garrett Sr. (Mackie), two of the first African-American bankers in the United States. The film was originally set to premiere at AFI Fest on November 21, 2019, ahead of a limited theatrical release in early December. One day before its premiere, Apple TV+ cancelled the festival and postponed the release amid sexual abuse allegations against Bernard Garrett Jr., the son of Bernard Garrett Sr. and a co-producer of the film, whose credit was later removed from the film. These childhood sexual abuse charges were made by Garrett Jr.'s half-sisters Cynthia Garrett and Sheila Garrett. It was released in a limited theatrical release on March 6, 2020, before digital streaming on March 20, 2020, by Apple TV+.  Plot  1954, Bernard Garrett wants to get into real estate but encounters racism that prevents him from being a successful real estate investor. After a chance encounter with wealthy club owner Joe Morris, he convinces Joe to be his co-investor. Together they convince Matt Steiner, a white man, to pose as the front of the company in meetings to facilitate the sales. Eventually, they become extremely successful in Los Angeles real estate, with the two teaching Matt the basics of real estate investing. The three secure a number of properties in L.A. and effectively integrate a number of previously segregated neighborhoods by selling and renting to black families. After this success, he sets his sights on the local bank in his Texas hometown to give loans to the black residents. Racist bank practices had excluded black people from receiving loans for small businesses and homeownership. Joe protests the idea at first but eventually relents and the three move to Texas. Matt buys the bank, fronting for Bernard and Joe, but the local townspeople are extremely suspicious of this move. A bank executive tracks the records of the loans and discovers that they're giving loans to black people, follows Matt and discovers that his partners are black, then threatens them with exposure which would cause \\"a run on the bank.\\" Matt persuades Joe and Bernard to purchase a second bank and put him in charge of it despite his inexperience. The racist bank executive calls in a federal investigator who checks the records of Matt's bank and discovers numerous infractions attributable to Matt's carelessness. Matt, Bernard and Joe get arrested for violating federal banking laws. Facing a 50-year prison term, Matt takes a plea deal, falsely testifying that he was duped by Bernard and Joe. The next day, Bernard testifies passionately about black people being given the same opportunity for upward mobility as whites. He and Joe are convicted and serve time in prison; upon release, they go with Bernard's wife Eunice to live in the Bahamas in two homes which Matt had purchased for them with money Bernard had entrusted to him for that purpose the night before Bernard's testimony.

The film was partially shot in Douglasville, Georgia and Newnan, Georgia. Additional casting was announced in November. Release In July 2019, Apple TV+ acquired distribution rights to the film. It was set to have its world premiere at AFI Fest on November 21, 2019, followed by a limited theatrical release on December 6, 2019, and digital streaming in January 2020. However, after claims of sexual assault were made against one of the producers of the film, Bernard Garrett's son Bernie Jr., by his half-sisters, the festival was cancelled and the film was pulled from the schedule. Bernie Jr's half-sisters also accused the filmmakers of writing their mother, Linda, out of the movie. He denies the claims of sexual assault, citing a family conflict surrounding Linda's infidelity and subsequent separation from his father, and the filmmakers maintain that the account of events depicted in the film are the result of independent research and not Bernie Jr's recollection. The film was eventually released in a limited theatrical release on March 6, 2020, followed by digital streaming on March 20, 2020.  Reception  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 76% with an average score of 6.62/10, based on 66 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"The Bankers timid approach to dramatizing its fact-based story is often outweighed by the trio of strong performances at its core.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

However, the philosophy behind many customs is what truly differentiates the two religions. There are stark differences in some core beliefs in regards to the messianic prophecies, apprehensions behind traditions, and even dietary restrictions. However, they are more similar rather than different on a vast spectrum of ideas, values and ethics.  Messianic prophecies  A primary comparison to make between Rastafari and Judaism is that both religions believe that there will be a coming of the Messiah, although they don't agree on who that Messiah is or will be. In the Jewish religion \\"The Messiah will indeed be a king from the house of David who will gather the scattered of Israel together, but the order of the world will not be radically changed by his coming.\\" This is in contrast to Nyabinghi and Bobo Ashanti belief, in which they believe Jesus, in the form of Haile Selassie, the emperor of Ethiopia from 1930-1947, is their Messiah; and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, who believe that Selassie was simply a divinely-appointed monarch and Jesus Himself is the Messiah (or Messiyah). Many Rastafari believe Haile Selassie's lineage can be traced back to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and is thusly known as the Solomonic dynasty. The perspective on the coming of the Messiah in Judaism are akin to that of Rastafari in that, \\"The Messiah will indeed be a king from the house of David who will gather the scattered of Israel together, but the order of the world will not be radically changed by his coming.\\" In addition to the belief that all Jewish People across the globe will become docile to the teachings of the Torah, is the prophecy of world peace and order. The root of the Rastafari Messianic belief came from Marcus Garvey's prophecy in which he states \\"Look to Africa where a black king shall be crowned, he shall be the Redeemer.\\" The rise of Halie Selassie's reign came promptly after Marcus Garvey's remarks, validating his prophecy and granting Selassie with the divine title of \\"God of the Black race\\" among some Rastafari.  Jewish vs. Rastafari laws  Since both Rastafari and Jews use the Old Testament as their holy scripture, they both follow more or less of the same principles, ideals, values and ethics as each other. However, Rastafari don't practice all the laws in the Old Testament but rather pick and choose which laws to obey. An example of a law both Rastafari and Jews follow would be the restriction of any alterations to the hair. It is said in Leviticus 19:27, \\"Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.\\" In Leviticus 21:5,\\"They shall not make any baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in the flesh.\\" And finally Numbers 6:5, \\"All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he spareth himself unto the Lord, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.\\" This explains the long sideburns and beards of religious Jews as well as the dreadlocks associated with observant Rastafari.

Playing career Riley played three seasons for Boston University in the mid-to-late 1960s. In his first two years with the Terriers the team finished in the top 2 in the ECAC both times and reaching the NCAA Tournament both times. BU finished as the National Runner-Up in 1967 but for his senior season Riley managed to play in only 9 of 32 games and finished his playing career after the season. Riley's time with the Terriers coincided with another future hall of fame coach, Jack Parker. Coaching career Riley graduated with a degree in physical education and immediately put his degree to work as the head coach for Lehigh University. After only one season with the Mountain Hawks Riley left to take over at Lowell Tech who began playing College Division hockey two years earlier. Riley was warned bout outgoing coach Dick Morrison that Tech would 'Never be a winner.' but the 24-year-old Riley took the job anyway. In his first season Riley got the Terriers to their first winning season, going 11‚Äì6, and continued to slowly build the program. The team was rechristened as the Lowell Tech Chiefs in 1971 and promptly made the ECAC Lower Division tournament the same season. Two years later the NCAA changed their classification system into numerical tiers and Lowell Tech joined the Division II ranks. In 1975, after setting a new program high of 14 wins, Lowell again changed their name, this time to the Lowell University Chiefs after merging with Lowell State. Two years later Riley brought in his first major recruit, landing Craig MacTavish who led the team with 88 points in his sophomore season en route to a 27-6 record the program's first ECAC championship and National title. MacTavish would leave after the year and go on to a long NHL tenure but the Chiefs didn't slip in the standings too much, finishing with 23 wins and a 3rd place finish in the NCAA tournament. The next season Lowell was back atop the heap, winning a second conference and national title. In 1981‚Äì82 Riley's team set the program record with 31 wins, dominated the ECAC tournament and took their third D-II National Championship with a 6-1 win over Plattsburgh State. Lowell went 29-2 the following season but lost in the National Semifinal, ruining their chance at a third consecutive National Championship. With little left to prove at the Division II level, Lowell jumped up to Division I in 1983‚Äì84 and were accepted into ECAC Hockey as a provisional member. Playing much stiffer competition, Lowell produced its first losing season in 10 years but still finished with a respectable 15‚Äì16‚Äì3 mark. The following year Lowell joined 6 other New England-based schools in forming the new Hockey East conference but it took two more years before Lowell produced another winning record. When the NCAA tournament expanded to 12 teams in 1988 Lowell received its first berth into the postseason as a 6 seed, losing both games convincingly to Wisconsin. Over the next three seasons Lowell wallowed near the bottom of their conference and Riley resigned after the 1991 season in the midst of an investigation that determined he had violated NCAA regulations between 1987 and 1989 by offering lower than normal rent to players in buildings he co-owned. Lowell was put on probation for 2 years following the investigation and, though the team would eventually recover, Riley's coaching career was at an end. Awards Riley was inducted into the Massachusetts Hockey Hall of Fame along with his late father Bill Sr. in 2006, the Massachusetts‚ÄìLowell Athletic Hall of Fame in 2013 and received the Hobey Baker Legends of College Hockey Award in 2017. Personal life Riley earned a Masters in physical education in 1972 from his alma mater and a Ph.D in sports psychology in 1981.

The island stretches for east-west, with the south coast offering two bays backed by sandy beaches. The north coast is dominated by steep cliffs in the west, rising to , and two shallow lagoons in the west. The twin lagoons nearly reach across the island to the bay on the south coast, almost bisecting the island. The majority of the island is in private ownership, however, of public conservation land in the central section of the island are managed by the Department of Conservation. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"reconnoitred island\\" for Motuarohia. History Motuarohia Island has a long history of human settlement, as evidenced by archaeological sites including a pa site, terraces and pits. In 1769, Captain James Cook anchored just south of the island, hence one of the bays is named Cook's Cove. His reports indicated that there were 200 to 300 Maori on the island and a pa at the eastern tip of the island. The island became also known as Roberton Island after the one-time owner who purchased it from Ngapuhi chiefs in 1839. Ownership of parts of the island changed hands later, and since 1979 the central section of the island, including the lagoons, is publicly accessible Department of Conservation land. Conservation As part of the Department of Conservation's \\"Project Island Song\\", Motuarohia is pest-free and home to a number of endangered bird species, such as whitehead, brown kiwi, and NZ dotterels during breeding season. Native forest is regenerating in most parts of the island, in particular in an area of felled pine at the western end. Recreation The twin lagoons in the central section of the island are surrounded by kikuyu grass flats. This area is used as a stopover point by small tour boats from Paihia and Russell, although not as popular as the much larger Urupukapuka Island nearby. At Motuarohia Island, the tour boats anchor in the bay and use a small tender to ferry passengers to the sandy beach. A walking track leads from this area to a lookout point overlooking the twin lagoons. There is also a walking track to the pa site, and an educational underwater trail for snorkellers.

The loop opened in June 2016 and is some of the newer streetcar infrastructure in the city. The Cherry Street branch and Distillery Loop currently form the eastern segment and terminus of the 504A King streetcar route. Distillery Loop Distillery Loop is located south of Mill Street and north of the railway viaduct on the east side of Cherry Street. It lies across the street from Distillery Lane in the Distillery District. The loop runs counter-clockwise. With the junction at Sumach Street and King Street, the loop can turn streetcars coming from either direction along King Street. Decorative features at the loop include paving blocks, a small grove of young trees, and a small flower bed between the track and the street. At the railway viaduct on the southern side of the loop stands the Cherry Street Tower which the Toronto Terminals Railway uses to control the eastern approach to Union Station. The southbound approach to Distillery Loop has a wheel greaser that is automatically activated by GPS; however, the greaser only functions for the newer Flexity streetcars. Cherry Street branch View of the full width of Cherry Street south of Eastern Avenue Running on a separated right-of-way, the branch line is approximately long and has three stops, each with a platform. Both streetcar tracks run on the east side of the street, with a tree-lined median separating them from two automobile lanes, and bike lanes on either side of them. The entire width is , including sidewalks wide. The branch line was built by Waterfront Toronto, in cooperation with the Toronto Transit Commission, to serve the West Don Lands neighbourhood and the Distillery District. The new West Don Lands neighbourhood was expected to have 6,000 units once opened. The projected cost of the branch line was $90 million. History In 2007, the plan for the Cherry Street streetcar line was finalized. Construction started south of King Street in 2012. In April and May 2014, the TTC constructed the junction at the corner of King Street East and Sumach Street. Completion and opening of the branch were delayed until after the 2015 Pan American Games; the new streetcar right-of-way crossed the security zone of the competition's Athletes Village. On June 19, 2016, the Cherry Street streetcar line opened as part of the new 514 Cherry route, using Distillery Loop as the route's eastern terminal. On October 7, 2018, the 514 Cherry route was discontinued, and replaced by route 504A King running from Dundas West Station to Distillery Loop. =Track problems= A few problems were reported within several months of the line's opening. Traffic lights were poorly timed at the intersections of Cherry and Front Streets and Cherry Street and Eastern Avenue. Along Queens Quay, painted turn lane lines were not clear enough to discourage motorists from accidentally getting onto the streetcar right-of-way and then being trapped there. Because of complaints of squealing wheels at the corner of Sumach and King Streets, as well as at the Distillery Loop, streetcars were replaced by buses overnight along the Cherry Street line. Late night streetcar service was restored on July 15, 2017, as TTC riders found the transfer between the night bus and streetcar to be inconvenient. To address the reported problems, the TTC: * Added extra signage to discourage motorists from driving on the tracks. * Imposed a maximum speed of at Sumach and King. * Use only Flexity streetcars which have an on-board wheel lubrication system. * Enhanced the on-board wheel lubrication system for higher lubricant output. In February 2020, city councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam reported that residents near the Cherry Street branch continued to complain about noise and vibration from streetcars turning at the corner of King and Sumach Streets. There were also complaints of a rumbling noise as streetcars passed over the eastbound trailing-point switch at the intersection. In June 2020, the TTC had made several changes to address track noise, some of which could be applied to other locations on the streetcar system: * Retired all CLRVs, which were noisier than Flexity streetcars. * Installed a wheel lubricator at Distillery Loop. * Installed wheel-mounted vibration dampening rings on 10 Flexity streetcars (with installation on 60 more in 2020) to reduce side noise by 5‚Äì7 dBA. * Installed on-board wheel lubricators on half of the fleet with plans to add them to the remainder of the vehicles. * Adjusted curve geometry with plans for further refinement. * Ground the bottom of switch points to sit flush and reduce the slapping sound as wheels pass over them. * Tested a new design for flexible switch points with a trial installation at College Street and Lansdowne Avenue. Future As part of the framework for redevelopment of Toronto's Port Lands, the city is aiming to have 55 percent of all trips to the area be made by public transit. As part of this initiative, it was recommended that the streetcar service along Cherry Street be extended south from Distillery Loop to the Ship Channel in a dedicated right-of-way on the east side of the street in similar fashion to the former 514 service. This would make Cherry Street the primary north‚Äìsouth transit route within the western Port Lands and would include stops at a re-aligned Queens Quay and Commissioners Street.

It is the second entry in his trilogy of metrical films, between Adebar and Arnulf Rainer. Originally commissioned to make an advertisement for , Kubelka edited footage from the shoot based on a complex set of rules, producing a rapid procession of images. Although the company was displeased with the commercial, Schwechater found favour as a work of avant-garde cinema. Description Schwechater contains 1,440 frames, making it exactly one minute long when projected at the standard rate of 24 frames per second. The film has no narrative, and it cuts between images quickly enough that they form flickering patterns.Sitney 1974, pp. 286‚Äì287. Four different moving images appear throughout the film. One shows a woman sitting at a table as beer is poured into her glass, and another shows her drinking the beer. There is also footage of a champagne glass filled with beer as well as a group of people in a restaurant. Production Director Peter Kubelka in 2014 =Photography= The Schwechater Bier brewery commissioned Kubelka to make an advertisement for its beer.MacDonald 2008, p. 186. Kubelka shot using an old, hand-operated 35 mm scientific camera. The camera had no viewfinder, and Kubelka largely ignored the composition of the images. Once the film stock was used up, Kubelka humored the art director for Schwechater Bier and cranked the empty camera, pretending to continue filming. =Editing= A sequence of red frames from the film Kubelka used four shots spanning 16, 30, 90, and 1,440 frames as the material for Schwechater. He produced high-contrast positive and negative prints, copied so that each shot looped for exactly 1,440 frames.Tscherkassky 2012, pp. 68‚Äì69. After getting the developed film from the laboratory, Kubelka let it sit for six weeks until executives from Schwechater Bier began asking about the commercial. The editing process for Schwechater lasted six months. Kubelka produced a score for the film with a complex system of overlapping structures to determine how to combine the eight film strips. One such structure specifies outlines the gradual permeation of the colour red in Schwechater. The film starts alternates between black-and-white sequences and red sequences; the black and white sequences decrease in duration from 110 frames down to 10 frames as the red sequences remain are all roughly 30 frames. As such, the film becomes increasingly red over the course of its runtime.Tscherkassky 2012, pp. 69‚Äì70. Another structure specifies which frames do and do not contain images. Each sequence of frames with images is immediately followed by a sequence of the same length containing frames showing a solid color‚Äîeither black or red. The frame count of these sequences traverses the powers of two, from 1 up to 32 and back down. =Soundtrack= For the film's soundtrack, Kubelka created a score of rasping sounds and beeps. The intermittent periods of sound happen parallel to the red-tinted sequences, with a low hum and one to three sine tones. When the Schwechater logo appears at the end of the film, Kubelka used a sustained, high-pitched sine tone.Tscherkassky 2012, p. 70. Release After Kubelka delivered the finished version to Schwechater, they stopped payment to him, ended their relation with him, and destroyed the company's print of the film. Initial reaction to Schwechater was very negative. The company sued Kubelka, and the film lab, which had Schwechater as a client, stopped making prints for him. His decision to leave Austria was in part because of the response to Schwechater. The film found success on the European film festival circuit. After several years, Schwechater Bier requested another print of it. Schwechater is now part of Anthology Film Archives' Essential Cinema Repertory collection.

It was located at Park Avenue and 86th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.  History  This station opened on May 15, 1876 with the introduction of partial rapid transit on the Harlem Line, with sixteen trains a day running between Grand Central Depot and William's Bridge. On the same date, the 110th Street station opened, and both were primarily served by the rapid transit service. While the 110th Street station also was served by trains to Golden's Bridge, 86th Street was exclusively used by Tuckahoe and White Plains locals. On April 29, 1901, the New York Central was granted permission to abandon this station and the 72nd Street station by the New York State Railroad Commissioners. While the station recorded 13,355 passengers in 1879, it only recorded 3,371 in 1900, even though the station was served by twelve daily trains. The station was last listed on the May 20, 1901 timetable and was left off the June 23, 1901 timetable.

The staircases are intact and can be accessed from the center median of Park Avenue. The station house used to be located in this median, which used to be wider. The layout of this station is different than 59th Street and 72nd Street; the platforms are on the insides of the outer tunnels, between the inner tunnels. The station platforms were long, and wide. A waiting room was located at the north end of each platform. At the south ends of the platforms staircases led to a mezzanine level where the ticket office was located.

Their first major combat test came in the Battle of Cedar Mountain (August 9), where they served in Brigadier-General Zealous Bates Tower's brigade at the far right of the Union Army commanded by Major General Nathaniel P.

She campaigned in support of the Nineteenth Amendment and the United Nations, and was the first female corporate director of Standard & Poor's.  Biography  = Early life and education = Harriet Wright Burton was born in Albany, New York, on December 16, 1873, to George Davidson Burton, a bank cashier, and Alice Davenport Wright. After her father died when she was aged six, her mother took her and her two younger brothers to live with his parents. She worked as a page at the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1894, held in Albany. Burton attended Albany High School, then went on to the New York State Normal College (now the University at Albany, SUNY) where she received a bachelor's degree in pedagogy in 1895 and a master's in 1896. Burton went to Illinois and received a Ph.B from Illinois Wesleyan University in 1898 before returning to New York to attend Barnard College, where she received a B.A. in 1902. She took summer courses at Harvard in 1900, the University of Chicago in 1901, and Oxford University in 1903. While working as an English teacher in the New York public high school system, she pursued a PhD at Columbia University, but stopped both after her marriage in 1905. She was awarded an honorary LLD degree by Rollins College in 1930. = Family and personal life = Burton married James Lees Laidlaw, a partner in the brokerage firm Laidlaw & Company and a strong advocate of women's rights himself, on October 25, 1905. They had a daughter, Louise Burton Laidlaw, in 1906. James died of Parkinson's disease in 1932, after which Harriet was named as the only female member the board of directors of Standard & Poors. Harriet died in New York City after a brief illness on January 25, 1949. At the time of her death, she was living in Manhattan at 920 Fifth Avenue and had a vacation home in Sands Point, Long Island.  Activism  Laidlaw gave her first speech in support of women's suffrage to an audience of friends and relatives at the age of 20. She became the secretary of the College Equal Suffrage League in 1908 and the acting Manhattan Borough Chairperson of the Woman Suffrage Party in 1911. The party's founder, Carrie Chapman Catt, asked her to fill the latter position more permanently, and she did so from 1912 to 1916. In addition to her work in support of women's suffrage, Laidlaw was a crusader against white slavery and the forced prostitution of both white and Chinese women in New York, and was a proponent of the Mann Act of 1910. In 1912, following a violent attack on anti- prostitution activist Rose Livingston, Laidlaw and her husband helped mobilize public opinion against the perceived inaction of Mayor William Jay Gaynor in ordering increased police protection for activists in New York's Chinatown. On November 9 of that year, she served as chairman of a torchlight parade down Fifth Avenue that drew an estimated 400,000-500,000 observers, an event that solidified her position as a leader of the suffragist movement. She wrote many articles and columns, spoke at public gatherings, and traveled around the country, including a trip through the western United States in 1913 to help organize activists. Laidlaw spoke out against the notion of separate spheres for men and women in regards to public life, writing in 1912 that, \\"insofar as women were like men they ought to have the same rights; insofar as they were different they must represent themselves.\\" In 1914, her most significant writing was published, a booklet entitled Organizing to Win by the Political District Plan, which gave activists step-by-step instructions on how to fundraise and engage with their local political leaders to keep up sustained pressure in support of suffrage. Harriet Burton Laidlaw, 1921 Laidlaw became a director of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1917, and was among a group of leading suffragettes who met with former President Theodore Roosevelt to persuade him to lend support to their cause. Later that year, an amendment to the New York Constitution granting women the vote was passed. Following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, Laidlaw's attention turned to international relations, and she promoted the United States' entry into the League of Nations as well as the formation of the United Nations. She was a strong supporter of Prohibition and was a member of the New York State Prohibition Society. = Honors = Both Harriet and James Laidlaw were honored by the League of Women Voters on a plaque unveiled in 1931 and now displayed in the New York State Capitol in Albany listing those of ‚Äúdistinguished achievement‚Äù in the women's suffrage movement; James is the only man listed.

Children with disabilities are 3.7 times more likely to be affected by any sort of violence, 3.6 times more likely to be victims of physical violence, 2.9 times more likely to be victims of sexual violence, and children with intellectual impairment are the most vulnerable being 4.6 times more likely to experience sexual violence than their non-disabled peers. An article published by the World Health Organization titled Prevalence and risk of violence against adults with disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies revealed that adults with any form of disability are 1.5 times more likely to experience some form of violence while adults with some form of mental impairment are 4 times more likely to experience violence than those without disabilities.  Comparison Groups  As mentioned by Powers and Oschwald, there are seven categories of abusive behavior defined by both male and female individuals who have some form of disability: physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal or emotional abuse, neglect or withholding support, financial abuse, manipulation of medications, and destroying or disabling equipment. = Institutional vs. non-institutional = When comparing and contrasting institutional and non-institutional cases of violence against people with disabilities, 82% of violence against people who are disabled happens when they are institutionalized. Common thought is that institutions \\"inherently promote abuse and dehumanization.\\" Although, institutionalized cases are far more present than non-institutionalized cases, statistics show that sexual assault based violence is 7 times more probable among intellectually disabled people and that number jumps to 12 times more probable if that person is a woman compared to a non-disabled peer. = Disability type vs. age = Age plays a major factor when looking into non-institutionalized violence. Those who have some form of disability ranging from the ages of 12 to 15 experience violence at a rate of 144.1 out of 1000 persons compared to their non-disabled peers at a rate of 38.8 out of a thousand with a rate difference being 105.3. Disabled teens ranging from the ages of 16 to 19 experience violence at a rate of 86.6 out of 1000 persons compared to their non-disabled peers at the rate of 31.4 out of 1000 persons. Examining the age ranges of 20 to 24, and 25 to 34 collectively to represent a persons twenties to mid thirties, the data shows that people with a some form of disability in that age range goes at a rate of 147.9 out of 1000 persons compared to 55.9 to their non-disabled peers with a rate difference of 92 out of 1000. = Disability type vs. gender = Examining statistics from Crime Against Persons with Disabilities table 5, results highlight that females between the ages of 12 and higher experience slightly higher percentages of violence among the disabled community compared to males of the same age group except for ambulatory disabilities. The rate of violence committed against men with a cognitive disability is 55.4 while females are at 60.3 out of 1000. Ambulatory disability being the only category where men have a higher rate comes to 29.6 while females are at 29.3 with a difference of 0.3. Visual impairment has a significant effect on the outcome of violence between the sexes as men are at a rate of 24.6 while females are 32.3 out of 1000 concluding a difference of 7.7. Lastly, table 8 displays a slight difference of 1.8 between the sexes with males at 15 while females are at 16.8. = Victim-offender relationship vs. disability status = Referencing Crime Against Persons with Disabilities table 8, it is evident that persons with disabilities are at risk of a higher rate of violence committed against them than their non-disabled peers. Additionally, according to the data, individuals who have some form of disability are at a higher risk of being victimized by a well-known or casual acquaintance over a complete stranger unlike their non-disabled peers; people whom have experienced an act of violence by a stranger with a disability being at 30.3% while non-disabled people are at 39.4% by a complete stranger.

It is the focal point of the Indian Brook Town Conservation Area. History The reservoir was created to address the increasing demand for water in Chittenden County. A series of droughts in the early 20th century lead to the village of Essex Junction needing to procure land for the sake of water conservation. On June 29, 1955, Essex Junction purchased 501 acres of land from various owners.Essex Land Records (1955). ‚ÄúWarranty Deed‚Äù (transfer of 500 acres around Indian Brook from various landowners to the Village of Essex Junction). Vol. 56, pp. 345-350. Town of Essex, VT. In 1957, the village hired Knight Consulting Engineers, Inc. to build a dam across Indian Brook and flood the valley. The resulting impounded water formed a 58 acre reservoir and became the main source of water for the village. The land surrounding it was established as a water conservation area known as the Indian Brook Town Conservation Area.Essex Conservation Committee (2011). Indian Brook Management Plan. Town of Essex, Essex, VT. In the early 1970s, the growth of the village was again restricted by inadequate water supply, so in 1973 the village officially connected to the Champlain Water District and discontinued use of the reservoir. The taxes on the land, and the need to repay the new water infrastructure debt and future costs, led to a push to sell and/or rezone the land.Gregg, Katherine (23 October 1973). ‚ÄúEssex Trustees Agree to Sell 1,000 Acres,‚Äù Burlington Free Press. Burlington, VT. In August 1977, after a public bidding process, the village trustees sold the Indian Brook property for $167,000 to several private developers. In November 1986, the town of Essex made a decision to purchase the land from private developers. On December 31, 1986, the land was purchased for $435,000. The Nature Conservancy provided a donation of $16,000. Following the purchase, the land was rezoned for open recreation. In 1988, water was lowered in the reservoir to facilitate minor repairs on the dam. Parking lots and roads were also upgraded, a boat launch and picnic sites were established, the remains of the old water treatment plant were razed, and park signs and trail markers were added.

The official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels. Lenin was given a state funeral and then buried in a specially erected mausoleum on 27 January. A commission of the Central Committee of the RCP(b) was in charge of organizing the funeral.  Funeral service  On 23 January, the coffin with Lenin's body was transported by train from Gorki to Moscow and displayed at the Hall of Columns in the House of the Unions, and it stayed there for three days. On 27 January, the body of Lenin was delivered to Red Square, accompanied by martial music. There assembled crowds listened to a series of speeches delivered by Mikhail Kalinin, Grigory Zinoviev and Joseph Stalin, but notably not Leon Trotsky, who had been convalescing in the Caucasus. Trotsky would later claim that Stalin had given him the wrong date for the funeral. Afterwards the body was placed into the vault of a temporary wooden mausoleum (soon to be replaced with present-day Lenin's Mausoleum), by the Kremlin Wall. Despite the freezing temperatures, tens of thousands attended. Against the protestations of Nadezhda Krupskaya, Lenin's widow, Lenin's body was embalmed to preserve it for long-term public display in the Red Square mausoleum. The commander of the Moscow Garrison issued an order to place the guard of honour at the mausoleum; whereby it was colloquially referred to as the \\"Number One Sentry\\". During the embalming process, Lenin's brain had been removed; in 1925 an institute was established to dissect it, revealing that Lenin had suffered from severe sclerosis.  Post USSR  After the events of the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, the guard of honour was disbanded. In 2018, Russian MP Vladimir Petrov suggested that Lenin‚Äôs body be buried in 2024, the 100th anniversary of his death, because it was costing the state too much money to house the body in the mausoleum and proposed it be replaced with a wax or rubber model.

It is notable for once having the highest residential property taxes in Cook County, Illinois. History Edgecliff was commissioned by Max Epstein when he became chairman of General American Transportation Company in 1929. The building was completed in 1930 by Samuel Abraham Marx. Nathan Cummings, whose business became Consolidated Foods Corporation and then Sara Lee Corporation, purchased the building in 1954 from Epstein's estate. He, his daughter and son-in-law lived there until 1961 when Cummings relocated to New York after remarrying. His son-in-law, Robert Mayer, acquired the house in 1961 and added a art gallery along the south end of the estate. The property had several galleries when it was owned by Buddy and Robert B. Mayer. Terry McKay acquired the property in 1995 for $4.6 million. By 1996, he had removed the art gallery. Description The 4-1/5 acre (1.7 hectare) property contains the two-story main complex, which is fronted by matching gatehouses, a long driveway and forecourt, is described as inspired by the 17th- and 18th- century French manor houses of Normandy and the Loire Valleys. The main building is flanked by one-story Mansard roofed wings that are attached to the north and south ends of the main building; the property also includes gardens, a pool, gazebo, and several service buildings. The building has minimal exterior decoration and the interior is marked by French doors. Located at 915 Sheridan Road and sometimes referred to as the Max Epstein House, it was the eighth property designated as a Landmark by the Winnetka Landmark Preservation Commission. In 2014, eight of the ten highest property taxed residences in Cook County were in the North Shore villages of Winnetka and Glencoe. With a 2014 valuation of $12.2 million, Edgecliff had a property tax of $294,001.88, making it the highest taxed residential property in Cook County. When Edgecliff repeated atop the Cook County property tax roll for 2015 with a bill of $300,439, it was one of five residences on Sheridan Road in Winnetka that made the top ten.

The film stars David Oakes, Tom Kane, Jennie Jacques, Liam Boyle, Jack Gordon, Florence Hall and Alexander Vlahos. Plot The film opens at an end-of-term Halloween house party, where a quiet guy named Felix (Tom Kane) enters, alone. A group of friends is there too, including Chris (Jack Gordon), a spoilt brat, with his mild-mannered girlfriend, Gemma (Florence Hall), his friend Paul (Liam Boyle), with his girlfriend, the abrasive Eleanor (Jennie Jacques), and his drug-dealer friend, Luke (Alexander Vlahos). Felix appears fond of Gemma and watches her from a distance for most of the party, catching Luke's attention. Luke provides Felix with cocaine, and convinces him to go and talk to her (although knowing of the upcoming consequences). Felix asks her out but she politely turns him down. Meanwhile, Paul and Eleanor attempt to have sex in an upstairs room, but Paul passes out drunk. Dejected, Eleanor decides instead to play truth or dare with the other party guests, downstairs. The bottle is spun and lands on Felix, who chooses truth, and Eleanor asks him to pick anyone he'd like to fulfill his fantasy with. Begrudgingly, he chooses Gemma, who appears somewhat embarrassed. Chris grows jealous and taunts Felix, before punching him. Gemma dumps Chris and runs to console Felix. Months later, after the Christmas holidays, all five friends get an invitation to Felix's surprise birthday party. It is revealed that Felix comes from a very wealthy family, and this is realised when they arrive at his home; a beautiful, but a seemingly abandoned mansion. After trying to find a way into the building, they are interrupted by the groundsman, Woodbridge (David Sterne), who tells them the correct address; a small shack half a mile down the beaten track, in the forest behind the mansion. They walk through the woods to the shack, where they are welcomed by a mysterious, handsome man named Justin (David Oakes), who reveals himself to be the elder brother of Felix. Justin reveals that due to last-minute flight cancellation, Felix will be unable to join them for the party, but welcomes them to stay for drinks anyway. The group start to make themselves comfortable and discover that Justin is a well-trained soldier, having recently returned from three tours of Afghanistan. Justin is also revealed to be particularly homophobic, frequently and casually throwing gay slurs. Justin suggests they play a game of truth or dare to liven up the party, and before long begins asking them questions regarding the night of the Halloween party, and reveals to everyone that he lied about Felix's absence. He tells them that Felix actually hung himself from the roof of the shack, the night after the party, with nothing but a postcard in his pocket marked \\"Truth or Dare, bitch!\\" (something Chris had said to him previously). Justin threatens that no one can leave until he knows who wrote the postcard, that he believes drove his brother to suicide. He goes on to explain how Felix's suicide has brought great shame to his family (being both highly religious and respected), and the only way to reconcile this shame is to bring justice to those deemed responsible. When the group tries to leave, Justin shoots Chris in the leg, and convinces Luke to act as his partner throughout the night, and tie up everyone else. Justin insists on continuing their game of truth or dare by incorporating a torture method he calls 'The Acid Test', whereby Gemma is force-fed a tube attached to two jars of identical clear liquid; one is said to be filled with tap water, and the other battery acid. Justin forces Chris to choose a jar, and fortunately he chooses the one containing water. Justin later swaps the roles, force-feeding Chris the tube, and forcing Paul to choose a jar. With Justin having swapped the position of the jars, Paul unintentionally chooses the one containing acid, and Chris chokes to death, bleeding heavily from his mouth. Before Justin can continue, the group is interrupted by an intruder, knocking at the door (who is revealed to be Luke's drug-dealer friend, Jonesy (Jason Maza), who followed them to the party). After Luke fails to convince Jonesy to leave, Justin intervenes by breaking his arm and threatening to shoot him, before handing the gun to Luke and gives him an ultimatum; given there's a 50-50 chance of firing either a blank or a bullet, he can either risk shooting Jonesy, killing him, or shooting Justin, and being able to leave with his surviving friends. Justin assures Luke should he shoot a blank at Jonesy, he can go free, but should he shoot a blank at him, he will kill him instead. Reluctantly, Luke shoots at Jonesy, killing him. Meanwhile, Gemma loosens her binds and escapes through the back window. Upon returning to the shack and finding Gemma missing, Justin leaves to find her, while Luke remains to keep watch on Paul and Eleanor. Gemma reaches the mansion, and searches for help, but is terrified to find Felix, alive but bed- ridden and almost completely paralysed. Woodbridge arrives and, aiming a shotgun at Gemma, reveals that it was he who found Felix hanging in the shack and has been caring for him ever since - he and Gemma get into a scuffle, and in an attempt to wrestle his gun away from her, he is fatally wounded. Justin arrives at the house, and breaks Gemma's neck in front of Felix, before taunting his brother with her corpse. Meanwhile back at the shack, Luke is reluctant to free Paul and Eleanor, claiming that as he's gained Justin's trust and is also responsible for killing Jonesy, he hopes Justin will use his connections to keep him from punishment. He also reveals that it was him who sent the postcard. However after convincing him to help her snort cocaine while she's tied up, Eleanor bites off Luke's little finger, sending him flying backwards and impaling himself in the back of the head on a tool lying on the floor, killing him. Freeing themselves, Paul and Eleanor attempt to escape, but with Paul's leg wound bleeding out they don't get far, before Justin returns with Felix, in a wheelchair. The three break out into a brawl, wherein Eleanor manages to both shoot Justin in the shoulder, and severely scald him by smashing the jar of battery acid over his head. Justin later awakens tied to a post by Eleanor, as Paul attempts to start Justin's car outside for them to make their escape. Eleanor reveals that it was never really the postcard that drove Felix to suicide, but in fact, a video she had blackmailed him with in exchange for money to help save her father's failing business. She explains that after Felix was humiliated in the game of truth or dare, she seduced and convinced him to perform oral sex on the unconscious Paul, upstairs - the fear of his brother discovering his questionable sexuality was what led Felix to attempted suicide. She then gives Felix a grenade and escapes with Paul, while the house blows up, killing both the brothers.

Morosco, 252 U.S. 317 (1920), was a United States Supreme Court case with two principal holdings. First, the copyright transfer contract in question was not limited to five years because the agreement dealt in minimum requirements. Secondly, the transfer of the copyright for the production of a play on stage did not grant the ability to make a motion picture based on the play. However, a grant of exclusivity implies a negative guarantee that the original creator will not do anything that may adversely affect that exclusivity, meaning the author forfeited their own ability to authorize a motion picture production. The Court enjoined both parties from making a film version. The case concerned Peg o' My Heart by J. Hartley Manners. A film version of the play was created in 1919 directed by William C. deMille and starring Wanda Hawley, but it was never released due to the legal issues raised by this case. Manners did produce a 1922 version starring his wife Laurette Taylor, and a 1933 version emerged later. Justices John Hessin Clarke and Mahlon Pitney dissented because they saw nothing in the original or revised contract indicating that either party expected the agreement to last longer than five years.

It is the first major game by Amanita Design that is not a point & click adventure. It was announced on 9 October 2018. The game was released on 10 July 2020 for Apple Arcade. Development Radim Jurda and Jan Chlup came up with the idea for Creaks while at university, during which time they created various prototypes using Flash as their graduation work. They eventually met Jakub Dvorsk√Ω, who started helping them with the project with his advice. Their project caught Dvorsk√Ω's attention and Jurda with Chlup were allowed to join Amanita Design, forming a small team within the studio to develop the game. Originally, the game was to be titled \\"Pareidolia\\". It was then changed to \\"Blik\\", and then again to the final title \\"Creaks\\", because a game named \\"Blik\\" already existed. The game was officially revealed on 9 October 2018 with a short teaser trailer uploaded to Amanita Design's YouTube channel. The budget of the game surpassed 20 Million CZK. The game was released after eight years of development for Apple Arcade on 10 July 2020 with the PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One versions being announced for later in the month. The Nintendo Switch version was in the works at the time of initial release. On 14 July 2020, the release date for PC and consoles was announced as 22 July 2020. Plot Creaks begins in the bedroom of the unnamed player character, who is seen sitting at his desk when the light flickers and dies, and the wallpaper peels away to reveal a secret tunnel behind his wall. The protagonist ventures through the newly-discovered tunnel and, after climbing down a ladder, finds himself in a massive mansion-like structure contained within an enormous cavern. He encounters aggressive monsters that become harmless inanimate objects when seen under the light. He also discovers that there is a giant feline monster slowly destroying the mansion by climbing on it. While exploring the underground world, the protagonist also meets several friendly bird-like people; an elderly bird person searching for a codex in order to defeat the giant monster, a younger bird person who tries to fight it with weapons and traps, a scientist bird person, and a small mechanic with a pipe for a head. The protagonist eventually reaches the bottom of the mansion, where he finds the scientist and the mechanic fighting the giant monster. It swallows the mechanic before retreating, and the scientist, saddened, leads the protagonist to her workshop, where it is revealed that she originally built the giant creature to power the mansion. The elder then arrives with the codex and reveals plans about a crystal, which the scientist builds a container lantern for. She then takes the protagonist further down into the sewers in search of it. He finds the crystal in a cavern and puts it into the lantern, creating a light that can defeat the giant monster. They begin climbing back up to the top of the mansion, regroup with the other two bird folk, and prepare to fight the monster. The protagonist jumps into its mouth, encountering the mechanic still alive - the monster is entire made out of household objects. The protagonist releases the crystal, destroying the monster and rescuing the mechanic in the process. With the monster defeated, the protagonist says goodbye to the bird folk and climbs back up to his bedroom, closes the entrance to the underground world behind his wallpaper, and opens his window to find that it is now day time. Gameplay Creaks is a 2D puzzle-platform game. The player controls a person who crawls through a hole in his bedroom wall and discovers a subterranean world home to various monsters called Creaks, which are inspired by a phenomenon called pareidolia: when the monsters encounter light, they turn into ordinary household objects that they otherwise resemble. The player has to avoid these monsters and solve puzzles in order to advance through the game. Puzzles generally revolve around the use of buttons, switches, lights, and mechanical devices to bypass enemies, which turn into furniture when exposed to light, and reach the next area. Solving puzzles requires logical thinking and an understanding of the movements and behaviors of the various monsters. Besides the main storyline, the game contains various paintings inspired by 18th and 19th century aesthetics. These pictures serve as collectibles, and many also contain minigames or interactive elements that metaphorically work as windows to another world. Reception The game has received very positive reviews following its release. Nathan Birch, in his review for Wccftech, gave the game 9.5 points out of 10. He stated that \\"Creaks renovates a well-worn genre, delivering one of the most satisfying indie puzzle-platformers in some time. Between its stunning visual and audio design, absorbing world, and perfectly- balanced puzzles, it‚Äôs hard to find serious fault with any part of this game‚Äôs construction.\\" Noelle Adams of Critical Hit gave the game 8 points out of 10. She called it a \\"wonderfully weird puzzle platformer.\\" She primarilty praised the visuals, atmosphere and gameplay. She also praised the game's soundtrack. Kieron Verbugge of Well-Played also gave the game 8 points out of 10. He praised the game's puzzles, aesthetic and audio production. On the other hand, he complained about lack of any hint system and some puzzle concepts. Liam Croft of Push Square gave the game 9 points out of 10. He praised the game's puzzles, hand-drawn art style, story, and soundtrack. Steve Caife of Slant Magazine gave 3.5 star out of 5 stating that \\"the game does lack some of the sense of accomplishment and ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moments of the best puzzle games. Reasonably clever though Creaks may be, it‚Äôs primarily a vehicle for Amanita‚Äôs brand of typically immaculate artistry, augmented here by the way the jangly music from composer Hidden Orchestra changes as the puzzle pieces fall into place. Though you encounter familiar configurations of levers and passageways and other obstacles, the mansion‚Äôs rooms all feel distinct, subtly interconnected in a way you likely won‚Äôt even notice unless you hit the load screen and see that every puzzle is coherently plotted on a zoomed-out side view of the mysterious mansion. Creaks hums along smoothly and pleasantly without calling attention to itself, to its sporadic detriment but mainly to its strength.\\" References External links * Category:2020 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Amanita Design games Category:Platform games Category:Art games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Xbox One games Category:Windows games Category:Horror video games Category:Single- player video games Category:Indie video games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Puzzle-platform games ","title":"Creaks (video game)"},{"id":"58711548","text":"Helen Rand Parish (1912 - 2005) was an American writer, linguist, and social justice scholar. Early life and education Parish and her twin sister, Olive, were born in Waterbury, Connecticut on October 10, 1912. At a young age, the twins became research subjects of Arnold Gesell, a child development pioneer who founded the Yale Clinic of Child Development. The twins graduated summa cum laude from college and went on to receive master's degrees in American literature from Yale University by the age of 17. The Parish sisters also did graduate studies on Latin American problems at USC. Helen went on to study at the National University in Mexico City and eventually moved to Berkeley in 1936, where she settled. Parish was drawn there by Latin American scholar Eugene Bolton, who accepted both Helen and Olive into his seminar on 16th-Century Spanish colonial history. Writing Parish began her writing career in journalism, first with the Atlanta Constitution, writing with her sister under the joint byline \\"The Parish Twins,\\" and later for other papers including the New York Daily Mirror and the New York Times. They frequently collaborated on stories with their mother who was also a writer. Parish worked as a free-lance writer, ghost-writing a number of books for Viking Press, as well as pursuing her scholarly interests at Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley. Parish eventually became a research associate there, where she assembled the world's largest collection of rare Las Casas books and documents. As a bi- lingual writer, Parish wrote in English and Spanish, focusing mainly on non- fiction books and essays on the life and writings of Bartolome de las Casas, as well as themes of Christianity and Central America, the relationship between Latin America and the United States, and Spanish American literature. Parish co-wrote with Henry Raup Wagner: \\"The Life and Writings of Bartolome de Las Casas\\" (1967). Additionally, Parish wrote three juvenile fiction books, all with different ancient history motifs. Parish was a strong supporter for the canonization of Bartolome de las Casas. Understanding that canonizations can take centuries, Parish remarked in 1992: \\"I have never asked to live to see the canonization, only to finish my work.\\" At Cesar Chavez Park in Berkeley, California, a memorial plaque for Parish sits attached to a large rock.

Career and research  = Discovery of Sry and the genetics of sex determination = In 1988, Koopman was recruited to the Medical Research Council's National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, working first with Anne McLaren, then joining a team led by Robin Lovell-Badge to search for the Y chromosomal sex-determining gene. Koopman demonstrated that activity of mouse homologues of the existing candidate, ZFY, was not consistent with a role in sex determination. Lovell-Badge's team, collaborating with Peter Goodfellow and colleagues at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London, discovered a new candidate gene, Sry. Koopman and colleagues injected Sry into fertilized XX mouse eggs which as a result developed as males, thus proving the male sex-determining role of Sry. The discovery is regarded as one of the major achievements in molecular genetics in the 20th century. Much of Koopman's subsequent research has focused on understanding how Sry acts to direct the formation of testes in the embryo, triggering male development. This work has involved the identification and/or study of a large number of other genes involved in development of the testes or ovaries. = Sox genes = Establishing his own research group at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia in 1992, Koopman set out to discover new members of a growing family of genes related to Sry ‚Äì \\"Sox\\" genes. Among the first discoveries was Sox9, a key regulator of skeletal and testis development, which carries mutations in humans with the skeletal disorder campomelic dysplasia and associated XY sex reversal. Koopman's group also discovered Sox18, a switch gene that directs formation of the lymphatic vessels, and is defective in humans with hypotrichosis-lymphedema- telangiectasia syndrome. Given the role of lymphatic vessels in tumour metastasis, Sox18 is being developed as a potential drug target for anti- metastatic cancer therapy. Koopman found that the human and mouse genomes contain 20 Sox genes, and he proposed the naming system for Sox genes that continues to be used today. = Germ cell sex = Koopman's early work with Anne McLaren spawned an interest in the regulation of the germ cells during fetal development‚Äîcells that later become sperm or oocytes. His group discovered that the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid stimulates germ cells to enter meiosis, a critical step in the formation of gametes. They also demonstrated that the developmental signaling molecule Nodal and its receptor Cripto regulate male germ cell pluripotency in the fetal gonad, opening the way for new non-invasive diagnostics and targeted additional therapies for testicular cancers. = Intersex advocacy = With a growing interest in human variations of sex development (alternatively known as DSD, differences or disorders of sex development, variations in sex characteristics, or intersex), Koopman began to engage with relevant clinicians and intersex advocacy and support groups. To cater for a need for unbiased information relating to the causes, types, impacts of DSD and options for affected people, Koopman authored a website, published under the auspices of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council‚Äôs Research Program in Human DSD. He continues to work with the Australian Pediatric Endocrine Group and a range of advocacy groups to improve dialogue and management of these conditions. = Research integrity = From 2012 to 2017, Koopman worked as the University of Queensland's Executive Director of Research Integrity, providing academic stewardship of research integrity and managing allegations of research misconduct. = Equity and diversity = Koopman co-chairs the Equity and Diversity Reference Group of the Australian Academy of Science and is a member of the Women in Health Science Working Committee of NHMRC Australia, and is involved in developing the Decadal Plan for Women in STEM commissioned by the Australian Government.  Awards and honours  1981: First Class Honours, Department of Genetics, The University of Melbourne 1992: AMP Biomedical Research Award, Australian Society for Medical Research 1992: Australian Research Fellowship, Australian Research Council 1998: Julian Wells Medal, Lorne Genome Conference Inc 2002: Australian Professorial Fellowship, Australian Research Council 2003: Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech Medal, Australian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 2005: President's Medal, Australia and New Zealand Society for Cell and Developmental Biology 2007: Australian Professorial Fellowship, Australian Research Council 2007: Award for Research Excellence, GSK Australia 2008: Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (FAA) 2009: Lemberg Medal, Australian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology  Other achievements  Koopman instigated the Australian Developmental Biology Workshop (2001- ), the Australian Sex Summit (2004- ), and the International Workshop on Sox Transcription Factors (2005 - ). He was organizer of the Cold Spring Harbor (USA) Workshop on Molecular Embryology of the Mouse (1995-1998), and Chair of the Gordon Research Conference on Germinal Stem Cell Biology (2017). Koopman has trained 34 postdoctoral research staff and 28 PhD students. He has published more than 280 research papers that have been cited over 19,000 times.

The 11-track collection of love songs was produced by Tanongsak Arpornsiri, the same producer behind many successful records by Thai pop biggest names like Thongchai McIntyre and Tata Young. After having established himself as an actor in the leading role in several Thai language television miniseries (lakhon), Purdy signed on to headline 'Lakorn in Concert', a musical on tour in a rock concert style, and discovered his love for singing and entertaining live audience.Art Supawatt Purdy's Biography Page on the official website www.artsupawattpurdy.com In 2003, he signed a recording contract with Warner Music Thailand and gave up acting completely to devote all of his time and energy to making this album. Tanongsak Arpornsiri, a member of Thailand legendary band GrandEx, was chosen to produce Purdy's debut effort which was recorded in six months from March to August 2003 and featured songs with pop, rock, country rock and latin influence, except the lead single 'Ya Ton Eak Leoy' () which was written and produced by Sakarat Amatayakul. The result was an adult contemporary album 'Art of Love', a collection of songs about different types of love in different level of emotions. In the years that followed the release of this album, Purdy travelled the world to perform in several series of concert tours regularly in places like Japan, Europe, and USA. Art of Love proved to be most notable in 2008 at one of the world's most prestigious film festival in Cannes when Purdy appeared as himself performing the lead single Ya Ton Eak Leoy () and the uptempo version of Yaak Euie Wa Ruk () live in the climatic scenes of the film presented there at 61st Cannes Film Festival called Soi Cowboy. Directed by English director Thomas Clay, Soi Cowboy was one of only 20 films that year to receive the honour of becoming the Official Selection to compete for the Un Certain Regard Award. For his effort on the soundtrack, Purdy also received the same honour in the music department for the 2 songs from Art of Love and newly recorded theme song Where We Never Grow Old.

She then worked as a freelance cycle instructor and bike doctor in London before becoming the director of the Flight Free UK campaign.  Cyclist  In 2011 Hughes cycled 4000 miles around the coast of Britain over 10 weeks, a route she repeated by sailboat in 2013. She then rode from Land's End to John O Groats in 2015, and 1000 km from Dieppe to Nice in 2019. Hughes has also written several books about cycling, including Eat, Sleep, Cycle (2015), which documents her 2011 ride around Britain, and Pedal Power (2017), a collection of \\"inspirational stories from riders around the world\\". Hughes was included in Cycling UK's 2019 list of 100 Women in Cycling for her \\"inspirational writing on cycling\\".

The Swedish campaign for 2019 was started by neighbours Maja Rosen and Lotta Hammar. The UK campaign asks UK residents to pledge not to fly in 2020, in what Hughes has described as \\"sort of Veganuary for aviation\\". The organisation also campaigns to lower the relative cost of alternatives to flying. As director of the campaign Hughes has criticised the idea of lowering of the Air Passenger Duty Tax and continued development of long haul flight routes. She has also called on organisers of Stag and Hen dos to find alternative ways to travel, such as trains, and criticised the UK Government under Boris Johnson for \\"fundamental lack of understanding\\" of climate issues.

Rashid bin Matar ruled at a time when maritime violence was prevalent throughout the Persian Gulf, following incursions by the Portuguese and fighting at sea and on land on the Persian Coast between the British and Dutch and the British and French, over 'factories' established on that coast by both maritime powers.  Clashes with the British  British East India Company interests were habitually protected by the use of firepower and two Arab maritime forces jostling for supremacy on both coasts of the Persian Gulf, the Al Qasimi and the Bani Ma'ain, soon found themselves in conflict with the British ( J. G. Lorimer reports 'the insolence of the local chiefs'). The Al Qasimi fleet of the time comprised some 63 large and 669 small ships and a force of 18,000 men. In 1727, the Al Qasimi established a port at Qishm, causing a loss of trade to the British, which led to the bombardment of the Al Qasimi facility and a demand for restitution from the British for the losses they had suffered.  Alliances  Following the invasion of Oman by the Persians under Nader Shah, the Shah of Iran, the Al Qasimi became increasingly distrustful of their new neighbours and one of Rashid bin Matar's first acts on acceding in 1747 was to conclude an alliance with Mulla Ali Shah, the former naval chief under Nader Shah who had taken the opportunity of the latter's assassination to seize Bandar Abbas. In 1755, Rashid together with Mulla Ali Shah attacked and took Qishm and Luft. This began a prolonged conflict with the Ma'in, who allied with Mir Mahanna, the Persian governor of Bandar Rig. The overthrow of the Persians by the first of the Saidis of Muscat, the Imam Ahmad, created a new enemy for the Al Qasimis and they went to war with Muscat in 1758. In 1759, Rashid allied with the Sheikh of Charak against Mir Mahanna. The alliance with Mulla Ali Shah paid Rashid dividends when the long and bitter conflict with the Bani Ma'in was concluded with a peace agreement in January 1763 which ceded him a third of the revenues of Qishm island. Alliances shifted quickly, however, and by 1773 Rashid threw in his lot with the Sultan of Muscat in attacking Karim Khan, the Vakil of Persia, on the Persian coast. Two years later, the Al Qasimi were once again at war with Muscat.  Accusations of piracy  It was under Rashid's reign that the first accusations of piracy were leveled against the Al Qasimi by the British, an incident in 1777 where Al Qasimi forces attacked and boarded an East India Company vessel. In responding to the British complaint, Rashid pointed out that the ship was running the colours of the Sultan of Muscat, with whom he was at war and therefore the taking of the ship was an acceptable act of war. In 1777, Rashid resigned in favour of his son, Saqr bin Rashid.
