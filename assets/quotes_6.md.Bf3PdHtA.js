Formed in 1973, the group changed its name from Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital to Association for the Welfare of Child Health in 1993 and then to Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare in 2007. In 2008, the association co-wrote \\"Standards for the Care of Children and Adolescents in Health Services,\\" a set of guidelines for treating children and teenagers in wards that are separate from adults. As of 2007, the association was based in Gladesville, New South Wales. History In 1959, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Health published the Platt Report 1959, a three-year investigative account of the welfare of children in United Kingdom hospital that required hospitals to implement major changes in the non-medical care of children in hospital. That led to the 1961 formation of Mother Care for Children in Hospital (MCCH), a group formed to increase the roles mothers had over the care of their child in hospital. By 1965, enough like-minded healthcare professionals joined the mother's group and the group was renamed the National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital (NAWCH). That led to the formation of similar groups in Canada (Canadian Association for Community Care) and Australia. The Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare (AWCH) was founded as Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital (AWCH) on 15 February 1973 in Australia as a voluntary organisation that gives non-medical attention and support to hospitalised children and their parents. The newly formed organisation wanted to make the public aware of conditions for children in NSW's hospitals, including deficiencies in standards of care. The Association was particularly concerned whether parents were allowed to visit freely in hospitals. Years of debate over the need to consider the emotional as well as physical needs of children in hospital lay behind the formation of the new body. The group changed its 1973 name from Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital to Association for the Welfare of Child Health in 1993, and then to Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare in 2007. In 2008, the Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare and the Royal Australian College of Physicians co-wrote \\"Standards for the Care of Children and Adolescents in Health Services,\\" a set of guidelines for treating children and teenagers in wards that are separate from adults. The standard concluded that treating children and teenagers on mixed wards alongside adults exposed the minors to poor care and mental trauma. To address this, the Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare proposed in the standard to treat children in separate areas of adult wards where staff are trained in children's needs or in wards that are completely separate from adults.

A Real Story by A.N.Maykov\\" and with considerable censorship cuts. It hasn't been re- issued in the author's lifetime and first appeared in its original form in The Selected Works by A.N.Maykov. The poem was written in 1844 and deals with the then popular issue of a \\"superfluous man\\" of the 1840s. Scholars usually see it as the author's reaction to Vissarion Belinsky's ideas and his own interpretation of them. More obvious influence, though, was Pushkin, and the motivation of the protagonist Vladimir's wanderings looked very much like that formulated in the poem The Prisoner of the Caucasus (\\"High society reject, a nature's friend / He left his native place...\\"). Vladimir, who feels as an outcast to the society, is engaged in a feud between Westernizers and Slavophiles (for whom \\"a local cucumber is sweeter than grapevine\\"), then succumbs to the blows of fate and turns into a typical landowner, a \\"mindless 'sky-smoker'\\". For all that, according to the biographer Fyodor Pryima, \\"Two Fates is in many ways an original work, noted, if not for its artistic maturity, then with daring political verve, containing ideas which were akin to those the Decemberists had as regarding the Russian history.\\" Of the poem's main character, Maykov wrote in a letter to Pavel Viskovatov: \\"Vladimir is so ambivalent: some of his views are pro-Russian, akin to those expressed by Moskvityanin, which I share myself, others smack of Belinsky-inspired Westernizing... He is a Pechorin-type hero, but of the University kind, and full of Belinsky's ideas.\\"Zlatkovsky, A.M., Apollon Nikolayevich Maykov, Saint Petersburg, 1888, p. 40 Later Maykov changed both his political views and his opinion of the Two Fates. \\"All of it, except maybe for two or three lyrical fragments, is phony; the play as such is exceptionally bad\\", he wrote.Ezhegodnik, 1975, p. 85 Reception Contemporary critics lauded the poem for its relevance, depth and realistic characters. In his February 1845 review of Two Fates Belinsky wrote: \\"This talent that has given us such hopes, develops and progresses. The proof of that is his new poem, richly poetic, fine in its intelligence and multifacetious in terms of motifs and colours.\\"The Complete V.G. Belinsky, Vol. VIII, p. 635 Alexander Herzen wrote in his diary on March 17, 1845: \\"Two Fates, by Maykov. Lots of fine moments. He seemed to touch so many strings that vibrate in our soul so achingly! Reflected in it are our estrangement from Europe with its interests, our apathy back home, etc, etc.\\"Herzen, A.I. The Works of... in 30 volumes. Moscow, 1954-1961, Vol. 2, p. 444 Nikolay Chernyshevsky wrote in a letter to Alexander Pypin: \\"What is remarkable in Two Fates is [its author's] passionate love for our homeland and for science. His speculations as to the reasons for our mental apathy could be as well dismissed but there are wonderful fragments on science in this book.\\"The Complete N.G. Chernyshevsky in 15 volumes.

There are still a lot of vain, fig and other fruit trees but mainly for personal consumption. In addition to eating and preserving, the locals use the grapes to make triple distilled Arak. Most fruits are used also to make different sorts of jams and jellies. Farms are mostly terraces and as the region enjoy a lot of rain between September and March, hence farms are mainly rained. Most of the apple produced in the village is either golden delicious or red delicious and many regard it among the tastier in the world due to the water and soil. Some of the farmers dedicate part of their farms for wheat and corns, mainly for personal use. Wheat is used mostly to produce bulgur, which makes the main dishes all over the year; whether as a standalone meal, next to other meals or part of other meals; such as tabbouleh, kibbeh, mujaddara and many others.

The path starts in the city centre, Plaza Nueva, and continues up the Cuesta de Gom√©rez, before reaching the monument.  Style  The gate was constructed in the style of Roman triumphal arches, with a classic front fa√ßade, making it the main entrance to the walled enclosure of the Alhambra. Built during the Spanish Renaissance, under the command of Emperor Charles V, the gate is made out of bonded stone carved with Florentine designs without roughing, which highlights the ashlars of the construction.  Brief History  Construction of the gate began in 1526 to commemorate the visit of Charles I of Spain to Granada after his wedding with Isabel of Portugal, according to the imperial program (Door of Justice, Pilar and Palace of Charles V). The idea was conceived by Luis Hurtado and executed by √ç√±igo L√≥pez with help from the architect of the Palace of Carlos V, Pedro Machuca. The gate was built in substitution of the original Islamic gate, the Bib al-Buxar also known as Bib al-Jaudaq, which was a defensive tower that protected the valley located between the hill of the Sabica and the Mauror Mountain. Some of the original Arabic architecture can be seen on the right side of the gate and on its left side is a baroque door to the Palace of the Marquise of Cartagena. Formally known as the Door of the Gom√©rez, the Gate of the Pomegranates receives its name from the three large open pomegranates that sit atop the main arch, accompanied by the imperial shield of Charles I of Spain and V of Germany and the allegorical figures of Peace and Abundance, concepts that the government of Charles I promised to contribute to the new lands of Al-Andalus. The Alhambra Forest can be seen behind all arches of the gate with the right arch leading to Torres Bermejas, the Manuel de Falla Auditorium and the Carmen de los M√°rtires, while the left side, formerly called Cuesta Empedrada, leads to the southern border of the Alhambra where the Doors of Justice and Doors of the Carts can be found. The central arch, surrounded by Tuscan semi-columns, provides access to paved footpaths that lead to the Palace of Charles V, the church of Santa Maria de la Alhambra and the Parador Nacional de San Francisco.Jos√© Manuel G√≥mez-Moreno Calera.

He loves music and literature and has many spiritual concerns. Extremely romantic, he knows how to speak beautifully. He goes out with Barbara and believes he is in love with her, but realizes that Julieta is the great love of his life.

It was directed by Ph. Carli and starred Annie Krohn, Sylvain Boekebinder, Vally Lank, and Jan Kruyt. The film follows a man and his mistress who reunite after their son and step- daughter unwittingly fall in love. The black-and-white film, which may now be lost, was tinted different colours for certain scenes. It was released in early 1930 to commercial success, although critical opinion was mixed. Plot Van Kempen is a supervisor at a tea plantation named Ciranu in West Java. He keeps a mistress, or njai, named Siti. Together they have two children, Adolf and Annie. One day, van Kempen returns to the Netherlands, leaving Siti and their young mixed-race children behind. In the Netherlands he marries a young widow and takes her daughter, Ervine, as his step-daughter. Siti, meanwhile, lives with her uncle in a hut in the forest and prays fervently for van Kempen's return, even asking for help from the local shaman (dukun). Fifteen years later, after his wife dies, van Kempen and Ervine return to the Indies. He has been hired as a supervisor at another plantation, not far from his old place of work. He searches for Siti and the couple's children, but none of his old coworkers know where they are. Unbeknownst to van Kempen, his children have been raised as natives and wear the traditional clothes, although they have also received a Western education. Adolf has become a hunter, while Annie stays at home with their mother. Frederick, the new manager at Ciranu, has meanwhile fallen for Ervine and tries unsuccessfully to woo her. Some time afterwards, as Ervine is wandering through the woods she stumbles upon a deer and, startled, faints. Adolf comes across her and brings her back to the plantation, where van Kempen recognises him and takes him on as a supervisor. Frederick, however, is jealous of Adolf and Ervine's relationship and entices the workers at van Kempen's plantation to go on strike until Adolf is fired. Although heartbroken, van Kempen must fire his son. Adolf goes to Lampung, in Sumatra, to hunt elephants. Meanwhile, Frederick has begun wooing Annie, who rejects him as Ervine did before. When Adolf returns and hears of the supervisor's actions, he fights Frederick and knocks him out. Ervine, meanwhile, has heard that her lover has returned and goes to the hut in the woods, nearly fainting after being caught in a downpour. Adolf sends a letter to van Kempen telling him where to find Ervine. The family are reunited. Production De Stem des Bloeds was directed by Ph. \\"Flip\\" Carli, a man of mixed Indonesian-European descent who had previously made several documentaries. He targeted the film at Dutch audiences, which may account for the focus on native customs and farming; such coverage was unusual for contemporary works of fiction, although documentaries had handled the subject before. His production house, which handled the film, was the Bandung- based Kinowerk Carli; some contemporary reviews erroneously gave the house's name as Cosmos Film. Production began in late 1929 or early 1930, with scenes shot in West Java and Sumatra. De Stem Des Bloed starred Annie Krohn, Carli's mixed-race wife, as Annie as well as Sylvain Boekebinder (van Kempen), Vally Lank, and Jan Kruyt. The story was advertised as being adapted from the novel of the same name. Like all contemporary films produced in the Indies, De Stem des Bloeds had low production values. The film was silent and in black-and- white; the final production consisted of 3,652 meters of film. The intertitles were in Dutch, which the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran notes that most viewers ‚Äì those who were native or ethnic Chinese ‚Äì were unable to read. In order to provide a semblance of colour, Carli tinted certain scenes entirely in one shade during post-production; for instance, a scene where farmers were gathering rice was tinted violet. Release and reception Newspaper advertisement, Surabaya De Stem des Bloeds was released in 1930, seeing its Batavia (now Jakarta) premiere on 22 March of that year. By July it was being screened in Surabaya, East Java. It was reported to be a success, with native audiences filling the theatres in Batavia and Surabaya. The film received mixed critical reception. An anonymous review in the Batavia-based Doenia Film praised the film's picture (especially its colour) and both Krohn and Boekebinder's acting. A review in the Surabaya-based De Indiesche Courant likewise praised the film, stating that it \\"fascinates from beginning to end\\" and showed that even in the Indies a \\"grand\\" film could be made. However, the review criticised the censorship bureau's failure to catch scenes of Frederick drinking alcohol, which the reviewer found \\"dangerous to the prestige [of Dutchmen]\\" considering the large native audiences. Kwee Tek Hoay, writing in Panorama, criticised the film extensively, writing that it seemed meant exclusively for Dutch audiences in the Netherlands, as those living in the Indies would be able to see it did not reflect reality and was in places illogical. He found the colouring one extension of this lack of logic, writing that a violet tinge indicated that the farmers were harvesting rice at sunset ‚Äì something that never happened. Legacy Carli went on to make two more films starring Krohn. The first, Sarinah (1931), was a romance set on the south coast of Java which had Krohn in the titular role. The second, Karina's Zelfopoffering (Karina's Sacrifice), followed the following year; this film saw Krohn play a mixed-raced woman living at the palace in the Sultanate of Yogyakarta. Karina's Zelfopoffering was a commercial failure and Carli left the Indies not long afterwards, moving to the Netherlands. He lived there until his death in 1972. Writing in 2009, Biran suggests that De Stem des Bloeds was clearly written from an Indo point of view because of the positive roles of Indo children. He finds the film sympathetic to native culture, including the faithful njai. He notes with interest that, although in real life mixed-race children were faced with a sense of disgust, in De Stem des Bloeds an Indo man is heroic enough to rescue a pure Dutch woman and fight with a Dutchman. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

He was the son of Joseph Gundry Alexander and the brother of ornithologists Wilfred Backhouse Alexander and Horace Gundry Alexander.  Early life  Alexander was born on 24 March 1887 in Croydon, England, and was educated at Bootham School, York and the South-Eastern Agricultural College, Wye. He gained a BSc in Agriculture in 1908 from the college and remained there as staff for the next year. In 1909, after devoting some time to mycological work in England, Alexander left for Rome to take up a post as redacteur at the International Institute of Agriculture, where he stayed until 1916. From an early age, Alexander showed a love of natural history which continued up until his death. Whilst he was at school he kept detailed notes of observations on birds, plants, and insects. He continued these daily notes after he left school and indeed for the rest of his life. He observed the song of birds, the first blossoming of flowers, appearance of certain insects, and appearance, increase, decrease, departure and passage of migrants - until the day of his death.Ibis, April 1918, Volume 60, Issue 3  Ornithology  Alexander made very detailed observations of bird-distribution and migration, first in Kent and other parts of England, and then in Rome. Even at war in Flanders, he still made detailed records; observing the birds throughout autumn and winter and in The Somme in July. In 1916, Alexander came back to England from Rome so that he could serve in the army. He enlisted as a Private and joined the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) on 29 February 1916 before transferring to The Queen's (Royal West Surrey Regiment) after the Battle of the Somme.http://britishbirds.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/article_files/V11/V11_N09/V11_N09_P204_209_OB041.pdf During his training he was based mainly in Dover, but in June of that year, he was sent to France. There, fighting at the Somme, Alexander was able to alleviate his grim surroundings somewhat by looking and listening to birds. He was often rewarded by the sight of a green sandpiper in a flooded trench or a great grey shrike on the battlefieldH.G Alexander. British Birds XI., No. 9, 1 February 1918. One night in 1917, while on sentry duty, Alexander broke his leg. The injury was assumed to be just a sprain and was not properly treated for more than two weeks. He was then sent back to Britain, and spent his convalescence in Monmouthshire, Wales. After more training until his leg was fully healed, Alexander was sent back to France. He was mortally wounded during the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October 1917 and died the following day. He is buried in Hooge Crater Cemetery, located on the Ypres Salient in Belgium. Christopher James Alexander's grave in Hooge Crater Cemetery.  Character  Alexander was a kind, shy, unassuming man, for whom \\"social intercourse with any but very simple, unassuming, frank people, or to those who shared his interests, was a torment to him.\\" It was typical of him that it was only after he died that his family learnt that in one of the battles in which he took part he had captured a German prisoner and shared his last biscuit and water with him.

It is intended to be located on the existing railway sidings in Toton, situated between Nottingham and Derby. A connection to the Nottingham tram system and new connections to existing rail services are proposed, to link the station to Nottingham, Derby and Leicester railway stations. The station would be located adjacent to the M1 motorway in Nottinghamshire, on the border with Derbyshire. After a sifting process, High Speed Two Limited offered a shortlist of East Midlands services consisting of this site and the expansion of the existing Derby railway station, with the government stating its preference for a station at Toton in January 2013. The plans are supported by Nottingham City Council, whereas Derby City Council would prefer the station to be sited at Derby railway station and Rushcliffe Borough Council support the expansion of the existing East Midlands Parkway station. In early October 2014, reports emerged that the preferred location for the East Midlands Hub station had been relocated to Breaston, 2-3 kilometres south-west of Toton. By July 2015 High Speed Two Limited confirmed they were not considering the Breaston site and that their preferred location for the station was at Toton. In November 2016 Phase 2b was approved by the Government. Background In 2009, the Labour Government created High Speed Two (HS2) Limited to examine the prospect of further high-speed rail in the United Kingdom. Later in 2010, the Coalition Government confirmed there would be a terminus in both Leeds and Manchester. In January 2013 the final route was announced with a new station being proposed for Leeds and a new station adjacent to Piccadilly station for the terminus in Manchester. Both Leeds and Manchester were to have junctions to the south of the cities allowing for connections to the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line respectively. The East Midlands Hub station was announced at the same time and would be on the Leeds branch of HS2, between Birmingham and Sheffield. Proposal Proposed layout of the East Midlands Hub station at Toton. The station would be a newly constructed site making use of existing railway land at Toton sidings. The proposals provide for a total of eight platforms, four of which would be for high-speed rail services and four for local and regional services. Two high-speed through lines would also be provided for services not stopping at the East Midlands Hub. The platforms would be constructed at ground level, with the station entrance and forecourt built at a higher elevation to the east. The site lies on designated green belt land, but is almost entirely surrounded by urban areas. The station is sited on existing railway land. Construction time of the station itself is estimated at five years, with services to be tested in 2031 and running by 2032/33. Alternatives The government selected the East Midlands Hub station at Toton as it was the \\"best of all the options HS2 Ltd developed for serving the East Midlands market as a whole\\". It offers approx. including existing companies on the site. The main alternative considered was for an HS2 station to be developed as part of the existing Derby station. High Speed Two Limited stated that this proposal would see a drop in the number of passengers travelling to and from Nottingham (and the wider area) and that ¬£190 million of additional fare revenue could be made from the Toton Hub proposal when compared with a Derby-based HS2 station. In their consultation document, High Speed Two Limited stated that the Toton hub station could attract three- quarters of London-bound passengers from Derby and four-fifths of those from Nottingham. In July 2013 Derby City Council put forward plans to route HS2 through Derby via Swadlincote and near to Belper, arguing that the route would be shorter and cheaper to construct. Council leader Cllr Paul Bayliss stated \\"It's not a secret we've been looking at HS2 having a station in Derby rather in some place called Toton\\". These plans are opposed by Nottingham City Council, which stated it would prepare a study to describe why Toton would be the best option. In addition to the plans to locate an HS2 station in Derby, consideration was given to constructing the line through East Midlands Parkway and upgrading the existing station there. This would result in the line taking a different, more expensive route and High Speed Two Limited concluded that even with the cost of adding new connecting services to Toton factored in, a Toton station would be cheaper to build than an HS2 station at East Midlands Parkway. The green belt designation of the land at East Midlands Parkway was also felt to be a significant planning constraint that the Toton site was not subject to. Despite this, the plan to construct via East Midlands Parkway was supported by two councillors representing the Borough of Rushcliffe, who claimed the East Midlands Parkway site would retain good access to road links in the area whilst benefiting from a connection to the existing rail network. Routing HS2 via East Midlands Parkway was later formally supported by Rushcliffe Borough Council after a meeting in December 2013. =Relocation to Breaston= On 8 October 2014, reports emerged that High Speed Two Limited were considering moving the station 2-3 kilometres south-west from Toton into Breaston, Derbyshire, to the west of the M1 motorway. Consideration of the new station location was reported to be driven by reduced costs of the new alignment (as a result of not needing to tunnel the line under East Midlands Airport) and easier connections to the existing rail lines between Derby and Nottingham. By July 2015 High Speed Two Limited stated that Breaston was no longer being considered and that the preferred site was at Toton. Transport =Road= The proposed site sits close to Long Eaton and is approximately away from junction 25 of the M1 motorway, where it intersects with the A52 dual-carriageway (Brian Clough Way) that links Derby and Nottingham. To the south of the site and the opposite side of the Trent River is the A453 which leads from Nottingham to East Midlands Airport and to the south-west Via A52 and M1 is the A50 connecting junction 24A of the M1 to Stoke-upon-Trent. The proposed site would include car parking and a new, dedicated connection to the A52. A bus rapid transit is planned for completion prior to the station opening and will, alongside a new Nottingham Express Transit line, connect the station to Derby. New bus services are also planned which will connect additional settlements to the station. =Cycling= The proposed site is within 50 metres of the Erewash Valley trail, which connects towns and villages within the Erewash Valley. It is 500 metres from route 6 of the Derby-Nottingham section of the National Cycle Network. =Rail= The station will be served by a dedicated rail service connecting it to stations in Derby, Leicester and Nottingham along with other significant stations in the region, including the East Midlands Parkway railway station which is approximately 5 kilometres south of the Toton site. Nottingham Express Transit opened an extension to the park & ride system at Toton in 2015. An extension, planned for completion by 2040, will see the line extended to Derby with an interchange at East Midlands Hub. =Air= The proposed site is approximately 10 kilometres north-east of East Midlands Airport. A railway station at the airport is expected to be complete by 2040. This will have direct services to East Midlands Hub and onward to nearby cities.

Raised in Lahore and descended from the warrior tribe Punjabi Pathan, Hayat began learning his craft from a young age, seeking inspiration from his brother's library collection and his father's workshop. He trained under Pakistani portrait painter Saeed Akhtar, and became influenced by his style. He graduated from the National College of Arts (NCA), and became a lecturer of furniture design at the Pakistan Institute of Fashion and Design (PIFD). Hayat holds strong philosophies regarding his artwork; in particular it offers him solace from an often violent or frustrating world. At one point, the antagonism from his peers, who questioned whether an art career was commercially viable, caused him to lose faith in his abilities and destroy many of his works. Hayat has held two exhibitions which have met with positive reviews, and has a piece currently featured at the 2017 Venice Biennale. He has been compared to Renaissance artists, as well as the Pakistani artists Saeed Akhtar and Collin David, by English-language Pakistani broadsheet The International News.  Life  = Early life = Born in 1981 and raised in Lahore, Hayat asserts that his interest in pursuing art descended from his lineage ‚Äì Punjabi Pathans in the tribe of Mohmand ‚Äì which were known as warriors who crafted their weapons like artisans. From a young age Hayat began to draw on objects such as matchboxes and paper, and he first saw art in the pages of his brother's library collection. At the age of six, his elder brother taught him to paint surfaces with a brush. He would later recall that his family would often observe him \\"drawing cartoons on walls and doors\\". These experiences led to him to visit his father's French antique style interior furniture workshop Messrs Sharif Hayat, or Hayats' Furniture, where he observed his elders using various techniques, such as painting on wooden tables, mirrors, and stained glass. In particular, he watched a style called Trompe-l‚Äô≈ìil, a technique which uses optical illusions to depict three-dimensional scenes on two- dimensional surfaces. It was here that Hayat honed his skills and matured as an artist, learning to create what he terms \\"both commissioned portraits and stylised works of art\\". Trips to Europe with his family cemented his love and appreciation for both art and architecture. = Later life = Hayat trained under Pakistani portrait painter Saeed Akhtar, where he became influenced by his style. During this time, he dabbled in other forms of artistic expression such as architectural murals, and became a pioneering figure in Pakistani art video making. He also became enamoured by the theory of the golden ratio, and frequently placed it into his work. Hayat was faced with challenges from those who questioned if he was pursuing a financially secure career; of this time he said: \\"I was in a state of denial which made me lose most of my magnificent art works\\". He graduated from the National College of Arts (NCA), and became a lecturer of furniture design at the Pakistan Institute of Fashion and Design (PIFD). His work Muse of Hope was auctioned off by the Polish auction house Sopocki Dom Aukcyjny. In 2013, he converted his home into a private arts studio, where he currently teaches.  Philosophy  Hayat considers art to be very personal, and based on one's own experiences. Much of his work involves the capturing of \\"interesting characters which influence (his) life\\"; animal forms such as humans and horses. He sees the twenty-first century as being full of \\"chaos and suffering [and a] Cult of Ugliness‚Äù, fueled by television and digital arts, which he believes are contributing to a state of \\"violence, frustration and chronic depression\\". To remedy this, he injects beauty into his work by capturing the essence of a person; the act of which gives him a sense of solace and freedom. With Using Beauty as a Remedy for Life, Hayat asked the question \\"is it possible to be beautiful and fat?\\", and looked into whether objective standards of beauty existed. He believes that in the modern world, utility is seen as more important than beauty, citing the \\"commercial practices and advertisements [that] are bombarding viewers\\" to purchase items that have a specific use, for instance food or technology. The concept of a bird and its flight has also been fascinating to Hayat.  Works  = Mahmood Hayat (2013) = Mahmood Hayat's debut exhibition, named \\"Mahmood Hayat\\", was opened by former Punjab governor Shahid Hamid, at Nairang Art Galleries on October 11, 2013. It was the first solo exhibition by Hayat, and featured both water-color and pencil sketch works. = Using Beauty as a Remedy for Life (2014) = The Using Beauty as a Remedy for Life display was officially opened by Pakistani writer and television personality Mustansar Hussain Tarar at the NCA's Zahoorul Ikhlaq Gallery on May 8, 2014. It ran for a week and closed on May 15 of that year. The solo exhibition featured 25 portraits created using the techniques of: charcoal on paper, graphite on paper, water colours on paper and oil on canvas. Most of the guests on the exhibition's opening day were from NCA and PIFD. Hayat summed up his work by saying: \\"Man lives and dies in what he sees, but he sees only what he dreams‚Äù. An accompanying book was designed by creative house Creativ Team and published by the NCA. = High Hopes (2017) = A piece of art by Hayat entitled High Hopes was selected to be shown at the Venice Biennale in 2017. The oils on canvas is the smallest painting he has done to date, measuring 10x12cm. Art consultancy firm White Turban aided Hayat in getting the piece to feature at the exhibition.  Reception  The International News described Hayat as \\"brilliant\\", and compared his 2013 solo exhibition to Renaissance artists, as well as the Pakistani artists Saeed Akhtar and Collin David. Observing Hayat's 2014 exhibition, Mustansar Hussain Tarar commented that he saw the beginnings of a new artist who had \\"spark\\" and who was sometimes \\"extremely brilliant\\".

It is part of the former Church of San Lorenzo, built between the 13th and 14th centuries and its interior houses such treasures as Moorish tilework and paneling, as well as a small chapel. It is also home to an association called Amigos de San Ant√≥n (Friends of Saint Anthony). It was declared a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural in 1877.  History  It is said to be the place where the wake for Fernando IV ‚Äô‚ÄùThe Summoned,‚Äù who died in Jaen on 17 September 1312, was held. For this reason, throughout the centuries prayers for the dead have been held in the arch during the funerals of the city bishops. Maximiliano of Austria, the uncle of Carlos I, was baptized here on July 6, 1555. Juan de Olid, the secretary of the Constable Miguel Lucas de Iranzo is buried in the arch. The small chapel served as the head of the Hospital de la Madre de Dios (Mother of God Hospital), founded in a nearby home in 1491 by Don Luis de Torres, the son of Constable Iranzo. It was also the first chapel of the Seminario Conciliar de Ja√©n (Ja√©n Theological Seminary), founded in 1620. In 1825 the church of San Lorenzo collapsed due to neglect, leaving only the arch standing. The parish and its archives were moved to the Church of Saint Bartholomew (Spanish: la iglesia de San Bartolom√©), and its artistic treasure was divided between the Church of Saint Bartholomew and the Church of La Merced. It was declared a national monument in 1877 thanks to the work of a group of Ja√©n residents who obstructed a campaign for its complete demolition. In 1969 the Direcci√≥n General de Bellas Artes began its restoration, which was headed by an architect from Jaen named Luis Berges Rold√°n.  The old church  The church was a single nave located at the current address 2-4 San Lorenzo Street. It was noted for its artistic treasures, including an All Souls Altarpiece, a panel of Saint Dominic and Saint Bartholomew of La Cuesta, and a legendary painting on linen of Cristo de las Injurias, all currently located in the nearby Church of La Merced.  The chapel  The chapel is covered by brick vaulting in the center of which hangs a votive lamp from a plaster pendant. The entire wall of the chapel is covered by a Moorish tiled plinth of great artistic value. On the altar there is an lowered arch niche housing a crucifix on a red damask background. This niche is decorated with fine Moorish plasterwork that festoons the tile panels. On the two sides of the entrance an inscription in Gothic lettering reads: (Spanish: Esta capilla de Jes√∫s Nazareno es.../...del Hospital de la Madre de Dios)  References   See also  * List of Bien de Inter√©s Cultural in the Province of Ja√©n (Spain) Category:Bien de Inter√©s Cultural landmarks in the Province of Ja√©n (Spain) Category:Arches and vaults in Spain Category:Ja√©n, Spain ","title":"Arc of San Lorenzo"},{"id":"38363014","text":"Nice is a surname.

There is Dracula Tourism in Transylvania, Romania and in the United Kingdom. The most well-known Dracula Tourism locations to visit in Romania are: Dracula Museum in Bucharest, that presents both the story of real-life Dracula, the Wallachian prince Vlad III Dracula, aka the Impaler and also the one of the mythical Dracula, the blood-thirsty vampire. # Bran Castle (\\"Castelul Bran\\"), considered to be the home of Dracula # The City of Sighisoara, where you can visit the house in which Vlad the Impaler was born # Old Princely Court (\\"Palatul Curtea Veche\\") in Bucharest # Snagov Monastery (\\"Manastirea Snagov\\"), where, according to the legend, Vlad's remains were buried # The ruins of the Poenari Fortress (considered to be the authentic Dracula's Castle) # The village of Arefu, where Dracula legends are still told # The city of Brasov, where Vlad led raids against the Saxons merchants # The village of Piatra Fantanele, where a Dracula Hotel was built in the very same place Bram Stoker placed the Dracula Castle in his novel Dracula.  Government attitude  Although Dracula tourism is a popular attraction in Romania, government leaders prefer other attractions within the country to be Romania's image. The National Tourism Masterplan restricted any Dracula theme parks from 2007 to 2026 to be initiated. The Romanian government views Dracula tourism as a false image of Romania, as Dracula was from a fictional novel rather than a piece of Romanian history. Despite this, Dracula tourism has made an impact on the country's economy in the past and currently there are multiple attractions within the country. Initially Romania's government did not view Dracula tourism as problematic due to the positive economic change. Romania's historical Vlad the Impaler was the focus of the tours. Awards In 2019, a 7-Day Halloween in Transylvania Dracula tour including 3 Halloween parties was awarded \\"2019 Tour of the Year\\" by TourRadar at Festival category. In 2011 Dracula Tours in London were included in \\"The world's best vampire- spotting locations\\" by Lonely Planet.

In 2007 Dracula tour-Halloween in Transylvania was included in a \\"Top 10 Must-Do Adventure\\" by Fodor's.  Dracula park  Dracula Park was a theme park proposition by Radu Florescu in 1995. The idea was to attract tourists worldwide and bring a larger audience to Romania and its identity with the fictional Transylvanian vampire. There were over 5,000 share holders and multiple attractions were planned for the park, including a hotel. The theme park idea was rejected until 2001, six years after the initial proposal. Dracula Park gained widespread attention in its development. There was controversy on the theme park and if it would be harmful to Romania's image, and the Dracula Park project was dropped.

Built in the 11th or 12th century, it stood at the corner of Plaza de Bib-Rambla and Calle Salamanca. During the 19th century, the gate became the subject of several major controversies, and in 1884 it was demolished. According to documents in the city court archives, there was another gate nearby called the Puerta Real. To discourage criminal activity, decapitated heads were hung on the gates of Arc of Elvira. In 1935, Torres Balb√°s used the remains of the Gate of the Ears to create an arch in the park of the Alhambra. This arch and a small gate at the beginning of Plaza de Bib-Rambla are the only vestiges of the old gate. Etymology One popular theory suggests that the gate's name is linked to the Andalusian tradition of taking the ears (and other body parts) of executed criminals and hanging them for display. Another theory suggests that during the reign of Philip IV of Spain, a floating tablao carrying too many people had sunk. The ears of dead women were mutilated in an effort to remove their earrings, giving the Gate of the Ears its name. The Gate of the Ears was known by many different names throughout history, such as the Arc of the Ears, Bib- Arrambla Gate, Gate of the Hands, Gate of the Pesos, Gate of the Horse, and Gate of the Sandland. The name Gate of the Sandland appeared during Moorish era because the sand lands of the nearby Darro River were the site of horse races. During this era, the gate was known as Bab-Al-Rambla, which would become the name of the plaza. It was also known as the Gate of the Knives, which may be related to the placement of confiscated knives. History According to recent studies, the gate was constructed in the 11th or 12th century. It appears to have inspired similar structures, such as the 14th- century Gate of Justice (Yusuf I). The similarity between the two caused some authors to wrongly date the Gate of the Ears to the Nasrid period.\\"Puerta de Bibarrambla (y Arco de las Orejas)\\", porlascallesdegranada.blogspot.com Topped by a tower 10 or 11 meters high, the Gate of the Ears was a monumental gate heavily protected by the square tower and three arches. The exterior had a large horseshoe arch, made with voussoirs of stone from Sierra Elvira. The structure was crowned by a balcony where, according to legend, the ears of criminals were nailed. The gate also had a machicolation, closed in 1507, forming what would become a chapel. As it was not primarily a military or defensive building, it had a more elegant line\\"El Arco de las Orejas y la pol√©mica nacional por su derribo\\", Idel (newspaper) (as described in History of Granada by Juan Gay Armenteros and Cristina Vi√±es Millet). There was an open space inside for defending the entrance. The smaller arch on the opposite side had sunken and embossed voussoirs, very similar to those on the Gate of Justice in the Alhambra, which made some historians assume that this arch was built in the mid-14th century. During both the Moorish and Spanish eras, the gate was the only entrance to Plaza de Bib-Rambla, which was surrounded by city walls. A Catholic Monarch hung a painting on the second arch: Our Lady of the Rose, named after the flower that the child is holding. Its sides are decorated with the initials of the kings. The kings may have placed the canvas there during one of their visits to the city. A grandstand was also installed under the voussoirs of the first arc in 1507. The chapel was closed and left a hole that exposed the image of the Virgin to the plaza. This was common in many Spanish gates that contained such paintings. The purpose was to Christianize the main elements of Muslim architecture and show visitors the new religion of the newly conquered city. Originally, the painting followed the schemes of the late Spanish-Flemish school. Its Gothicism is most noticeable in the angels, smaller in size and with angular wings. By contrast, the faces of the Virgin and Child favored greater naturalism and remarkable sweetness.[lugaresdegranada.blogspot.com/2015/02/arco-de-las-orejas-puerta-de- bib-rambla.html \\"Arco de las Orejas, Puerta de Bib-rambla\\", lugaresdegranada.blogspot.com] In 1675, a tribune and an altar were added, hiding some of the original decoration. On the side of the plaza, Gothic characters were printed on a white marble board, alluding to a chapel above, which was built in 1507 in honor of the fiestas of the Corpus Christi by the chaplain of Queen Isabella I of Castile. It seems that the Mass was held in the chapel for the neighborhood of the plaza and the Zacat√≠n. Demolition This photograph of the Gate of the Ears, taken around 1870, shows its poor condition just before its demolition By 1873, the Gate of the Ears was in poor condition and the city council of Granada deemed it ruinous. Businessmen and burghers of Granada put pressure on the city to demolish it, arguing that the gate hindered the city's economic development and prosperity. Initiatives such as the Ensanches/Eixamples reinforced this position and underscored the congestion and stagnation caused by the gate. The city council shortly announced plans for its demolition. The decision caused such an uproar that the president of the First Republic demanded its renovation, stating that \\"it would be a shame for Granada and a disgrace to the Republic, since the monuments of Granada are the heritage of the human race.\\"\\"El Arco de las Orejas y la pol√©mica nacional por su derribo\\", Ideal (newspaper) A city council architect, D√≠az Losada, also announced his opposition to the destruction, arguing that the gate was not in ruins and only required repair. After March 27, 1879, the city council architects issued a report stating that there was no other option but to dismantle the elements of the Gate of Ears so that it could be restored later. Madrid's answer to the report was clear: in 1881, the structure was declared a national monument and came under the protection of the state. However, Granada received many complaints in response to the decree. Some claimed that the gate was a danger to public health and safety due to urbanization and the dangerous cracks weakening the gate's structure. In the summer of 1884, the fear of a cholera epidemic further raised concerns about the monument's lack of cleanliness, finally leading to its demolition, which began on September 3, 1884. Remains Leopoldo Torres Balb√°s, a conservative architect of the Alhambra, tried to rebuild the gate in 1933 with the original remains, placing a new arc in its current location. Unfortunately, many of its original features were lost. Balb√°s was able to construct an edifice from what was left, which is located in the Forest of the Alhambra, partially hidden by foliage and trees.\\"A las puertas del cielo\\", Ideal (newspaper) See also *List of missing landmarks in Spain References External links Category:Granada Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Spain Category:Moorish architecture of the Iberian peninsula Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 12th century Category:City gates in Spain Category:Virgin Mary in art Category:Former gates Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1894 ","title":"Gate of the Ears"},{"id":"38363141","text":"Mawk'a Tampu (Quechua mawk'a old, tampu inn, \\"old tampu\\", hispanicized spelling Maucatambo) is a mountain in the Andes of Bolivia.

With Maxick, he developed the Maxalding system of muscle control. Early years Born in Highgate in London, the son of George Frederick Woollaston (1828‚Äì1896), a shoe manufacturer, Methodist preacher and faith healer, and Adelaide Mary (n√©e Green) (1849‚Äì1923), Saldo was interested in strength athletics as a youth, and in his teens joined the London Weightlifting Club in Regent Street in London. From May 1895 he worked as a booking clerk for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway at their office in Brighton's Grand Hotel. An uncle with connections in the theatrical profession arranged for the 18-year-old Saldo to be apprenticed to Eugen Sandow in 1897. His first public appearance was at the Coliseum in Leeds as a demonstrator of the Sandow Exerciser. A fellow-apprentice at Sandow's gym was Italian bodybuilder Ronco, and having gained stage experience while helping Sandow in his act Saldo and Ronco decided to go it alone, creating their own strongman stage act. Billed as \\"Ronco & Monte\\", the duo first appeared in 1900 at the Cafe Chantant at The Crystal Palace. This was followed soon after by a tour of Europe; on their return to Britain they appeared for six months at the Royal Aquarium in London. Strongman Act Darracq In common with many strongman acts of the period, part of their routine was to offer money to any member of the public who could copy their feats of strength; no one was ever successful in duplicating them. Saldo and Ronco's appearance at the Royal Aquarium was so successful that their contract was extended, but when this came to an end they separated. Saldo then teamed up with his younger brother Frank Harold Woollaston, and the new strongman act opened at the Hippodrome in London, followed by a European tour during which Saldo posed for the Dutch artist Jozef Isra√´ls, who, impressed by his physique, painted him in a classical pose. During the tour the brothers appeared in Amsterdam, Dresden, Hamburg, Saxony, Prague and Paris, at the latter city regularly working out in the gymnasium of Edmond Desbonnet. On their return they appeared for a season at the London Pavilion. In 1903 Saldo added a new routine to the act which was designed to draw in large audiences, during which he supported a heavy motor car in the \\"Tomb of Hercules\\" position. Having prepared and rehearsed carefully, on stage a Darracq full of passengers was driven up a ramp and onto a bridge, where the ramp and supports were removed leaving Saldo supporting the entire weight of the vehicle and its contents on a section of the bridge. Later, the act was refined, with Saldo supporting the car on top of a ten-foot high revolving platform. This act was taken on another international tour, for which Saldo received the largest salary ever paid to a one-man strongman act. Monte Saldo weighed 144 pounds, stood 5‚Ä≤5‚Ä≥, had a 17‚Ä≥ neck, 45.5‚Ä≥ chest, 16‚Ä≥ arms, 13‚Ä≥ forearms, 30‚Ä≥ waist, 23‚Ä≥ thighs and 15,5‚Ä≥ calves. He could bent press 230 pounds and was the first man in England to do a one arm swing with more than body weight, doing 150 pounds. He is credited with showing for the first time that the swing was best done with a dumbbell loaded unevenly, with more weight on the back end of the bell. The Sculptor's Dream In 1906 Saldo refined the act even further, teaming up with his brothers Frank (now known as Frank Saldo) and Edwin, the three of them billing themselves as \\"The Montague Brothers\\", and performing a new routine called \\"The Sculptor's Dream\\". A theatrical poster for 'The Sculptor's Dream' (1906) The act was described by Alexander Zass thus: > \\"... a real strongman, and a clever weightlifter to boot was Monte Saldo, > whose stage showmanship was best displayed, perhaps, in a turn which he > presented with his brother Frank, entitled \\"the Sculptor's Dream,\\" certainly > of the most artistic and impressive of any ever given. > The curtain rose disclosing a sculptor's studio, with the sculptor at work > on a reproduction of a well known classical statue. The figure was Monte > himself, painted and garbed in an excellent imitation of marble, and behind > him was a mirror, in which the statue could be seen reproduced. After > working a while, the sculpture wearied, and concealing his masterpiece > behind curtains, stretched himself at length upon a couch, soon to be > ostensibly asleep. The curtains thereupon parted on their own account, > revealing the statue in another classical pose, again reflected in the > mirror. Then once more they closed, only to re-open and repeat their re- > opening to revelation of ever fresh poses and reflections, until finally the > statue and the mirror reflection confront each other in a famous wrestler's > attitude. > A pause, and then the mirror crashing as the 'reflection' ‚Äì brother Frank, > to be more explicit ‚Äì leapt out to grapple with Monte, and execute on stage > a variety of wrestling postures. This unique opening was followed by a > series of equally novel strength feats in which both iron and human weights > figured, closured by Monte pressing Frank aloft with one hand, and a twirl > round of the supported performer. This twirl, by the way, was very smartly > done. As Frank leant back to be supported on Monte's palm, the lifter would > interpose a revolving disc on which his brother's back rested. Thus when > Frank had been pressed aloft, it enabled Monte to spin him. > At this juncture, the sculptor would commence to stir, whereupon both > statue and 'reflection' would leap back and, resuming their original poses, > thus satisfying the now awakened chiseller of marble that all which had > transpired was actually nothing but a dream. > Monte Saldo was one of the few men who have enhanced a reputation made on > the stage as a strongman by feats performed away from its atmosphere of > glamour and make-believe. The first man in the world to 'swing' over his own > bodyweight with one hand, and one of the most successful trainers of strong > men ever known...\\"Zass, Alexander The Amazing Samson, As Told by Himself > London (1926) pp 66‚Äì68 The Entr'acte said of this new routine, \\"An absolutely original athletic act is given by the Montague Brothers. Their performance is entitled 'The Sculptor's Dream' and provides the most original setting we have ever seen, being athletic and at the same time effective when it comes to feats of strength pure and simple. Their work is simply amazing.\\"The Entr'acte 16 March 1906 The sculptor was played by Edwin John Woollaston (1874‚Äì1918), the duo's older brother. Later years Later, with William Bankier, who at this time was a wrestling promoter known professionally as Apollo the Scottish Hercules, Saldo opened the Apollo-Saldo Academy in London, which attracted many of the famous lifters and wrestlers of the day, including George Hackenschmidt, Ferdy Gruhen, Maurice Deriaz, Zbysco, and the winner of over 1,000 contests and Lightweight Wrestling Champion of the World, gold and silver medalist in the 1908 Olympics, London born George de Relwyskow. In 1909, as a result of the success of the Academy, Saldo became a founder of the Maxaldo method of exercise system of muscle control along with German strongman Max Sick (Maxick) (a name created from those of the founders, Maxick and Saldo). The name was later changed to Maxalding, and the postal course was sold into the 1970s. In 1914 Saldo published a book, How to Pose, which had a great influence on athletic, aesthetic and muscular posing. He was also active in organising the British Amateur Weightlifter's Association, (BAWLA) and was a Committee member for professional weightlifters. Largely self-taught, Saldo was an accomplished musician and was fluent in several languages. His wife Florence Annie Woollaston (n√©e Bryant) (1878‚Äì1941) was killed during a bombing raid on London during World War II, and Saldo and his daughter Florence were seriously injured. His youngest son Charles was killed during the invasion of Europe in 1944. Monte Saldo lived in Hythe in Kent during his later years, and died on 23 February 1949 at The County Hospital in Ashford in Kent aged 70. In his will he left ¬£249 13s 4d. He was survived by his daughter Florence Theresa Montague Wilson (n√©e Woollaston) (1907‚Äì1990) and a son, Frederick Harold Courtlandt Woollaston (1910‚Äì1983), also known as Court Saldo.

It is considered to be one of the oldest mosques in the region, as its foundation is believed to have been laid as early as 692 AD. An inscription found on the site, however, suggests a foundation date of sometime during the 11th century. It has since been rebuilt twice in both the 14th and 15th centuries, when the minarets were constructed. The Khamis mosque has been partially restored recently.

The station was from Whitchurch, between and and was situated more than from the town of Montgomery. It had two platforms which were slightly staggered, and the station building was on the northern side; there were also a signal box and goods shed.

The next recorded instance of Royal Bhutan Army competing in any form of football competition is in 2002. They competed in the A-Division, though their final position is not known. Indeed, the only known result for them for the season is a draw against Paro. the following season saw them finish in fourth place in the A-Division, winning three and drawing four of their eight games in the single round-robin tournament. Again, only a single result is known for them, a victory over Druk Athletic. 2004 records are too fragmentary to say whether the club participated in the A-Division that season, but they did compete in 2005, when they had a poor season, finishing fifth out of seven teams with only three wins and two draws from their twelve games, narrowly avoiding the relegation playoffs to ensure another season in the top flight. They performed better in the Knock-out Championship for A-Division clubs, reaching the semi finals, before losing 4‚Äì1 on penalties to Druk Star following a 1‚Äì1 draw in normal time. The club improved their performance in the league markedly the next season, finishing in third place, ahead of Druk Pol, but behind champions Transport United and an unknown second-place finisher. this is yet another season where fragmentary records mean that there is only one known result for the club, a 0‚Äì0 draw with Druk Pol. =2006-2009= The army finished in fifth place in 2007, eleven points behind champions Transport United after the fourteen game season. Only three results are known for this season: a 1‚Äì0 loss to Druk Pol, a 2‚Äì0 victory over Yeedzin and a 6‚Äì0 thrashing of eventual bottom place finishers Rigzung. 2008 saw arguably Royal Bhutan Army's best performance since they won the national title in 1986. They finished third in the league behind Yeedzin and Transport United, with nine wins and a draw from their fourteen games (including a 5‚Äì2 win over Druk Pol and a loss to Yeedzin). As well as this, they reached the final of the Thimpu Football Knock-out Tournament, beating Transport United 6‚Äì3 in the quarter final and Druk Star 4‚Äì1 in the semi final, only to lose to Yeedzin 4‚Äì3 in the final at the Changjiji Ground on 28 September. The following season however, was to be the club's last to date in the A-Division. After seven games, with one win and a draw, they withdrew from the competition. Their remaining game in the first half of the season against Choden was awarded to their opposition and the team were relegated.

They are commonly found near the ocean in western North America, namely Canada and the United States. It is also known as the Aleutian sculpin. Taxonomy type locality: Unalaska (right). While the name Uranidea microstoma has been used since 1880, it is unclear whether or not it corresponds to the Coastrange sculpin. The species was first officially described by Charles Henry Gilbert in 1896 from specimens he collected in streams of Unalaska island the year before. Cottus protrusus was described in 1933, but it has since been found to be a synonym. Description The Coastrange sculpin can be distinguished from other species due to several unique traits. It only has one pore under its chin, no palatine teeth, and no distinct gap between the two dorsal fins. Adults can grow to be as long as 17 cm, although their average length is only 6 cm. Their maximum reported life span is 8 years. Breeding female Coastrange sculpins are generally larger than males. Breeding males are almost entirely black with a tiny bit of orange trim on the first dorsal fin. =Cultus Lake population= At Cultus Lake in British Columbia, one of the three areas where isolated populations of Coastrange sculpin exist, there exists a form smaller than the norm that lives in the lake depths and migrates to the surface at night to feed. The Adults of this subtype, while smaller are fully mature save for the enlarged head pores that juveniles of the main form exhibit. There is no clear explanation for what produced this phenotype, which differs from all other populations. Cultus lake Distribution and habitat The Coastrange sculpin is found exclusively along the Pacific coast of North America. They range from Bristol bay and the Aleutian islands of Alaska, south to Santa Barbara County, California, Though they can also be found sporadically in streams as far south as Mendocino County There are also isolated populations in Alaska's Kobuk river, Lake Washington of Washington state, and British Columbia's Cultus Lake. Living mostly in rivers and streams, Coastrange sculpins are found in riffles and glides with coarse or cobble stone bottoms from .20m to 1.0m in depth. At night, they move into shallower, calmer waters on the edges of rivers. It occurs in virtually the same habitats as the Prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) and the two species encounter one another and interact regularly. They also tend to encounter salmon and the Three-spined stickleback as well. Behavior Coastrange sculpins are solitary, nocturnal carnivores and known to eat nymphs and larvae of insects such as mayflies, stoneflies, and chironomids (and other aquatic invertebrates). They are also known to eat the eggs and fry of the pink and chum salmon. Their larvae are free swimming/floating and feed mostly on plankton, however they become bottom dwellers after they transform and eat the same diet as the adults, except that they take smaller organisms as prey. They are also eaten by coastal cutthroat trout, coho and sockeye salmon, and Dolly Varden trout. =Spawning= Coastrange sculpins normally spawn in spring, when the water warms past 6 degrees C, though eggs have been found as early as January in British Columbia. During spawning both males and females migrate downstream, stopping just short of estuaries. Males both excavate and defend the nesting site, which is normally under flat rocks. During courtship, a female approaches the nesting site and the male begins a series of head nods, shakes and flares of the gill covers. Sometimes the body undulates during the head movements, sometimes the undulations exist without head motion altogether. Several of these movements are not for visual effect but for producing a distinct sound to attract the female. If the male has gained interest, the female will move closer into the nest site and the male will bite her on the cheek, side, tail, or pectoral fin; the male may even take the female's head into his mouth. If the female is able to lay eggs, she will always enter the nest after being bitten. Inside the nest, the female turns upside down and releases eggs that the male fertilizes. Males will spawn with multiple females this way, and may also spawn with each female multiple times. Coastrange sculpin eggs are yellow to orange in color and are deposited on the underside of the flat rock at the top of the nest. They are less prolific than other sculpins and only produce an average of ~1000 eggs. Larvae are active immediately after hatching and begin a nocturnal migration further downstream, where they usually grow for about a year in estuaries before returning to freshwater.

In the act, the Brothers displayed acts of strength including supporting a heavy motor car complete with passengers and 'The Sculptor's Dream'. Taking its name from the middle name of the act's founder, Alfred Montague Woollaston (Monte Saldo), 'The Montague Brothers' grew out of the strongman act 'Ronco & Monte' - both of whom had served apprenticeships with famed strongman and bodybuilder Eugen Sandow. On 'Ronco & Monte' breaking up Monte Saldo then teamed up with his younger brother Frank Woollaston, and the new strongman act opened at the Hippodrome in London, followed by a European tour. During the tour the brothers appeared in Amsterdam, Dresden, Hamburg, Saxony, Prague and Paris, at the latter city regularly working out in the gymnasium of Edmond Desbonnet. On their return, they appeared for a season at the London Pavilion.Biography of Saldo, Maxalding.co.uk In 1903 Monte Saldo added a new routine to the act which was designed to draw in large audiences, during which he supported a heavy motor car in the \\"Tomb of Hercules\\" position. Having prepared and rehearsed carefully, on stage a Darracq full of passengers has driven up a ramp and onto a bridge, where the ramp and supports were removed leaving Saldo supporting the entire weight of the vehicle and its contents on a section of the bridge. Later, the act was refined, with Saldo supporting the car on top of a ten foot high revolving platform. This act was taken on another international tour, for which Saldo received the largest salary ever paid to a one-man strongman act. The Sculptor's Dream In 1906 Monte Saldo refined the act even further, teaming up again with his brother Frank Woollaston (now known as Frank Saldo) and older brother Edwin, the three of them billing themselves as \\"The Montague Brothers\\", and performing a new routine called \\"The Sculptor's Dream\\". A theatrical poster for 'The Sculptor's Dream' (1906) The act was described by Alexander Zass thus: > \\"... a real strongman, and a clever weightlifter to boot was Monte Saldo, > whose stage showmanship was best displayed, perhaps, in a turn which he > presented with his brother Frank, entitled \\"the Sculptor's Dream,\\" certainly > of the most artistic and impressive of any ever given. The curtain rose to > disclose a sculptor's studio, with the sculptor at work on a reproduction of > a well known classical statue. The figure was Monte himself, painted and > garbed in an excellent imitation of marble, and behind him was a mirror, in > which the statue could be seen reproduced. After working a while, the > sculpture wearied, and concealing his masterpiece behind curtains, stretched > himself at length upon a couch, soon to be ostensibly asleep. The curtains > thereupon parted on their own account, revealing the statue in another > classical pose, again reflected in the mirror. Then once more they closed, > only to re-open and repeat their re-opening to the revelation of ever fresh > poses and reflections, until finally the statue and the mirror reflection > confront each other in a famous wrestler's attitude. A pause, and then the > mirror crashing as the 'reflection' - brother Frank, to be more explicit - > leapt out to grapple with Monte, and execute on stage a variety of wrestling > postures. This unique opening was followed by a series of equally novel > strength feats in which both iron and human weights figured, closured by > Monte pressing Frank aloft with one hand, and a twirl round of the supported > performer. This twirl, by the way, was very smartly done. As Frank leant > back to be supported on Monte's palm, the lifter would interpose a revolving > disc on which his brother's back rested. Thus when Frank had been pressed > aloft, it enabled Monte to spin him. At this juncture, the sculptor would > commence stirring, whereupon both statue and 'reflection' would leap back > and, resuming their original poses, thus satisfying the now awakened > chiseller of marble that all which had transpired was actually nothing but a > dream. Monte Saldo was one of the few men who have enhanced a reputation > made on the stage as a strongman by feats performed away from its atmosphere > of glamour and make-believe. The first man in the world to 'swing' over his > own bodyweight with one hand, and one of the most successful trainers of > strong men ever known...\\"Zass, Alexander The Amazing Samson, As Told by > Himself, London, 1926, pp. 66-68 The Entr'acte said of this new routine, \\"An absolutely original athletic act is given by the Montague Brothers. Their performance is entitled 'The Sculptor's Dream' and provides the most original setting we have ever seen, being athletic and at the same time effective when it comes to feats of strength pure and simple. Their work is simply amazing.\\"The Entr'acte 16 March 1906 The sculptor was played by Edwin John Woollaston, the duo's older brother. The act broke up in about 1909, with Monte Saldo opening a gym with William Bankier ('Apollo, the Scottish Hercules'), while Frank Saldo went into physical training and teaching. Older brother Edwin John Woollaston died in 1918.

The actress was a fan of the serial, before she successfully auditioned for the role of Rani. Her casting was officially announced on 7 December 2011 at the same time it was revealed that her on-screen parents would be promoted to regular cast members. The Kapoor's arrival marked the show's first family with Indian and Sri Lankan heritage. They also became the first family to be introduced since 2010. Cherian made her first screen appearance as Rani during the episode broadcast on 1 February 2012. In May 2013, it was confirmed that Cherian had left Neighbours and Rani made her screen exit on 2 October 2013. Rani is the teenage daughter of Ajay (Sachin Joab) and Priya Kapoor (Menik Gooneratne). She is a typical high school student, who wants to be popular. She is smart and also \\"a girlie girl\\", a trait that Cherian can identify with. Rani begins her first relationship with Harley Canning (Justin Holborow) and Cherian stated that her character had really fallen for him and wanted the \\"whole fairytale\\". However, she became the centre of a love triangle between Harley and her friend, Callum Jones (Morgan Baker). Rani becomes distraught when she discovers that her mother might have had an affair with Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Once she had evidence of the affair, she exposed it to her father. Casting Cherian told a writer for Dolly that she had been a fan of Neighbours for many years, so she was \\"excited\\" to learn from her agent that she had an audition with the serial. Cherian was called back for a second audition, where she was introduced to Kaiya Jones and Morgan Baker who portray Sophie Ramsay and Callum Jones respectively. Weeks later, Cherian was out shopping when she received a call from her mother, who told her that she had been offered the role of Rani. The actress said \\"It was such an amazing and unforgettable moment and nothing's been the same since.\\" Cherian has an on-set tutor to help keep up with her school work during filming. She also revealed that getting to know the cast was one of her favourite parts of working on the show. The character and Cherian's casting was officially announced on 7 December 2011. It was also revealed that Rani's parents, Ajay (Sachin Joab) and Priya Kapoor (Menik Gooneratne), would be promoted to the regular cast in early 2012. The Kapoors became the first family to be introduced to Neighbours since the Williams' arrived in 2010. The show's then executive producer, Susan Bower, stated \\"I'm delighted by how the Kapoors have been introduced. Viewers already know them because of their role in the community and link with other characters, and their cultural background is secondary.\\" Bower added that having a family of Indian and Sri Lankan heritage join the neighbourhood was very exciting. Cherian made her debut as Rani on 1 February 2012. Development =Characterisation= Rani is the teenage daughter of Ajay and Priya Kapoor. Before her introduction, Rani was often mentioned by the other teenage characters to give her immediate connections within the community. Cherian called Rani \\"a typical high school girl\\", who wants to be popular. She likes romantic movies and is a fan of the boy band One Direction. Gooneratne called Rani \\"a smart girl\\", who is \\"certainly her mother's daughter!\\" Cherian stated that Rani is also \\"a girlie girl\\", something that she herself could identify with. Rani finds employment at the local plant nursery alongside friend and neighbour, Callum Jones =Love triangle= In September 2012, Rani met Harley Canning (Justin Holborow) and became the centre of a love triangle between him and Callum. Holborow said that the romance with Rani makes Harley want to stay in Ramsay Street. He added \\"This girl has changed his life, but it's complicated.\\" Rani eventually begins dating Harley and Cherian told Jackie Brygel from TV Week \\"She's a hopeless romantic. She wants the whole fairytale and she's really fallen for Harley.\\" Rani's first kiss with Harley occurs while they are taking a walk near Lassiter's Lake. The scene marked Cherian's first on-screen kiss and she admitted \\"It was pretty nerve-racking. It was night-time and we were both cold and shivering.\\" The actress sought advice from her co-stars before filming the scene. Rani's first kiss soon leads to more at school, where her mother catches her and Harley together. Brygel noted that Priya \\"will be dishing out more than just a detention after finding out exactly what her daughter's been up to.\\" Rani is unaware that Callum has developed a crush on her and was heartbroken when he learned that she was dating someone else. Charian stated that Rani has been blind to Callum's feelings and has not picked up on anything at all. Talking to Susan Hill from the Daily Star, a show spokesperson revealed that while Callum could give up on Rani, he decides to imitate Harley's \\"bad boy\\" ways instead in a bid to impress her. Rani does not know what is going on with Callum when he develops an attitude. =Priya's affair and death= When Rani helps her father to plant some presents around the Lassiter's Complex for a treasure hunt, she witnesses her mother in an embrace with Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Cherian told an Inside Soap reporter that Rani is in \\"total shock\\" at what she has seen, especially as Paul is her parent' nemesis. Of her reaction, Cherian said \\"Rani thinks: 'Oh, my God! What did I just see?' She's not exactly sure - it might have just been a hug, but she has suspicions that it was something more intimate. She feels stunned, confused and enraged that her mother would even touch Paul Robinson.\\" Rani eventually finds the courage to confront her mother, who tells her that she was just comforting Paul because he was upset about his son's epilepsy diagnosis. Cherian commented that Rani really wants to believe the story, but when Priya start buying her gifts, she realises something is not quite right. Rani comes to the conclusion that her mother may be having an affair with Paul, which leaves her \\"distraught\\". Ajay notices the change in her mood and becomes concerned about her. When he talks to Rani, she decides not to tell him what she is thinking, especially as she is not a hundred per cent sure about what she saw. When Rani learns that a pair of her mother's gold earrings were found in a Lassiter's Hotel room, her suspicions that she was having an affair are reignited. Rani then steals Paul's phone and reads \\"raunchy texts\\" sent between him and Priya. Rani is \\"stunned\\", but instead of confronting her mother, she decides to go off with Harley without telling anyone. Rani later exposes her mother's affair with Paul to her father. Joab told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy \\"At first Ajay thinks his daughter is lying to hurt her mother. Priya and Rani haven't been getting along, so he puts it down initially to teenage angst. But when Priya has to choose between calling her daughter a liar and admitting the truth, she realises she has to come clean. Ajay is obviously devastated.\\" A few months later, Ajay forgives Priya, but Rani struggles to come to terms with what has happened and is not \\"so easily won over\\". During Sonya (Eve Morey) and Toadie's (Ryan Moloney) wedding reception, Rani and Priya have \\"a trivial fight\\" over the dress that Priya has brought for Rani. Rani leaves the reception and when Priya goes to send her a text message, a gas explosion causes the marquee to collapse, trapping her inside. While Priya is rushed to hospital in a serious condition, Rani is unaware of what has happened until Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) finds her and brings her to the hospital. Priya dies from her injuries and Rani goes into \\"shutdown mode\\" and keeps her emotions to herself. A week after her mother's death, Rani sees Priya's ghost sitting on their couch. Cherian explained \\"Rani is feeling guilty, as the last time they spoke, she told Priya she hated her. She didn't get the chance to tell her how much she loves her, and she almost feels that her mum didn't love her back. The ghost is a way for Rani to attempt to find some closure on the whole situation.\\" Cherian stated that Rani is calm and appears comfortable with her mother's appearance. She even talks to her, which the actress thought was \\"a little bit odd\\". Priya's ghost appears to Rani again and Rani continues to talk to her, even though she is unresponsive. Gooneratne said that for Rani, it is a way of trying to find closure. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) and Callum soon notice that Rani has become withdrawn and they try unsuccessfully to get her to open up. Ajay also realises that he has forgotten to make Rani his number one priority. Rani opens up to Ajay, telling him that she feels guilty for the way she and her mother left things, but she does not tell him about the visions. Cherian added \\"Rani doesn't want him to think she's going crazy. He's also got his own problems ‚Äì she's seen how much Priya's death has affected her dad and so she doesn't want to put any more stress on him or burden him with her own issues.\\" Ajay reassures Rani that Priya did love her, but Priya's ghost appears once more, making it obvious Rani is still feeling guilty. =Departure= On 1 May 2013, it was confirmed that Cherian had left Neighbours. She filmed her final scenes on 30 April. Cherian tweeted that she would miss the cast and crew, while executive producer Richard Jasek told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy \\"It's very special when someone joins the Neighbours family as a youngster and then to have the privilege of watching them grow into an extraordinary young adult. We have all adored working with Coco and like all our characters, we hope there will be an opportunity with our stories for Rani to make a return visit to Ramsay Street.\\" Rani initially departed with Ajay on 12 July 2013. The pair were planning a trip to India with the insurance payout from Priya's death, but when Ajay learns his grandmother is seriously ill, he decides to leave immediately to be with her. Rani is surprised when Ajay tells her that she is not going with him, as he believes she has been through enough. Cherian commented \\"But Rani wants to support her dad, and she feels that she's simply being dumped.\\" Rani points out that she needs to be with her family and Ajay eventually agrees she can come. Rani made a brief return from 27 September. Storylines Rani joins Erinsborough High when her mother becomes the principal. Callum Jones initially judges Rani, calling her a nerd and the principal's pet. However, he later tells her that she is cooler than he first thought and they become friends. When Sophie Ramsay runs away from home, Rani helps to hide her in her bedroom. Callum discovers where Sophie is and urges her to go home, while Rani agrees. Callum later tells Sophie's uncle where she is and Rani reassures him that he did the right thing. Rani and Sophie sneak out to attend a house party at Number 32, which gets out of hand. When Sophie's uncle, Paul Robinson, learns that they were there, he briefly bans them from seeing each other. Callum realises that Sophie has tried to turn him and Rani against each other because she is jealous of their friendship. They get revenge on her by pretending to date and annoying her with their romantic behaviour. Callum turns on Rani when Ajay begins representing his biological father, Troy Miller (Dieter Brummer) in a custody case. When Troy dies, Rani helps support Callum and they make up. Rani is embarrassed when she has to wear glasses, until Priya buys her some new ones and Ajay reassures her they look okay. Rani develops a crush on Harley Canning and decides to get contact lenses, so she can catch his attention. After a night out with friends, Rani and Harley share their first kiss. Priya later catches them kissing at school and calls Rani cheap, before telling Harley to stay away. She later relents and Rani begins dating Harley. Rani witnesses her mother in an embrace with Paul and when she confronts her, Priya tells her that she was just comforting Paul. Rani begins to suspect that her mother is having an affair, especially when she learns that her earrings were found in a hotel room. She later steals Paul's phone and finds texts from him and Priya detailing their time together. A devastated Rani then decides to go to a party in Frankston with Harley. However, Ajay shows up at the bus stop and takes her home. Rani tells him that Priya has been having an affair with Paul, but Ajay does not believe her. Priya then admits the truth. Rani tells Sophie that she hates her mother and later cuts up her clothes and begins ignoring her. She posts a derogatory message about her mother on Facebook, causing Priya to give her two weeks detention. Rani initially refuses to attend the detention, but Ajay tells her that he agrees with Priya's punishment and takes her back to school. Rani learns that a Facebook page has been set up to bad mouth her family and tells Ajay. She later vandalises Lassiter's Hotel with some graffiti about Paul. Sergeant Matt Turner (Josef Brown) is prevented from questioning her by Ajay. Paul later decides not to presses charges. Ajay and Priya tell Rani that she must work at Lassiter's for two days as punishment. Rani befriends Bailey Turner (Calen Mackenzie) at a street barbecue and he later apologises for his father's involvement in her punishment. Priya's relationship with Ajay improves, but Rani remains reluctant to forgive her. When Priya buys Rani a dress she does not like for Sonya and Toadie's wedding, Rani become angry with Priya. During the reception, they argue and Rani leaves. When she receives an unfinished text message from Priya, Rani tells Sophie that she hates her mother. Kyle Canning finds Rani and tells her there has been an accident and Priya is in the hospital. Rani joins Ajay at her mother's bedside and they are told that Priya will not wake up. Rani and Ajay say their goodbyes to Priya, before she dies. Rani is devastated, but hides her grief around others. She also feels guilty because the last thing she told Priya was that she hated her. Rani starts seeing and talking to Priya's ghost. After finding Priya's journal, Rani learns how much Priya loved her and stops seeing her ghost. Callum asks Rani out and they begin dating. Rani decides to produce a play written by her mother and casts both Callum and Bailey in the main roles. Rani develops feeling for Bailey and they kiss during a rehearsal. Rani feels guilty about betraying Callum and tells him the truth. Angered, Callum drops out of the play and refuses to speak to Rani. She rewrites the ending of the play, so that her character and his end up together, and Callum returns. The play is a success and Rani briefly sees Priya again. Callum asks Rani to stop speaking to Bailey if she wants to get back together with him and she agrees. When Callum realises that Rani still has feelings for Bailey, he helps them get together. Wanting to go on the pill, Rani turns to Susan Kennedy for help. Ajay assumes that Rani is planning on having sex with Bailey, but Rani tells him that she is experiencing bad period pains. While Ajay and Rani plan a holiday to India, Ajay learns that his grandmother is terminally ill and decides to leave immediately. Ajay arranges for Rani to stay with the Kennedys, but she refuses to remain behind without him. Rani says goodbye to Callum and Bailey, who tells Rani he loves her, and she and Ajay leave Ramsay Street. A couple of months later, Rani returns without Ajay to sort things out and pack up their belongings. Rani tells Bailey that she and Ajay are moving to London and she breaks up with him. Bailey then tries to win an overseas scholarship to join her in London, but Rani tells him that she does not want him to come over. She admits that she met someone else while she was in India and it made her realise that she needs to move on with her life. Rani says her goodbyes and leaves. Reception Following the announcement that the Kapoor family would become regular cast members, several racist posts were left on the Neighbours website and had to be removed by staff. Bower said most of the inappropriate comments, from viewers expressing their anger at a non-Anglo- Saxon family being introduced to the show, came from a \\"small minority\\". She later commented that for every negative comment about the family there were ten to fifteen positive ones. Joab spoke out about the issue, saying \\"There is various pockets that will say it is un-Australian to have an Indian or an Indian family on Ramsay St. Those Aussies who are saying it is un-Australian will be the same ones who pretty much supported the White Australia policy back in the day, you are never going to get away from that kind of stuff.\\" Joab added having a show, which portrays different families coming together could only be a good thing for the community. For her portrayal of Rani, Cherian was included on the long-list for the 2013 Most Popular New Female Talent Logie Award. In late January 2013, Dianne Butler from News.com.au commented \\"I wonder if it isn't time Rani wasn't sent away for a spell ... the asylum on American Horror Story?\\" While reviewing an episode that featured Rani grieving for her mother, Melinda Houston from The Sun-Herald wrote \\"Coco Cherian puts in a terrific performance as Rani. It's all surprisingly engaging.\\" References External links *Character profile at the Official AU Neighbours website Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Child characters in television Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Rani Kapoor"},{"id":"38363816","text":"Prospeeed Porsche 997 GT3 RSR at the 2010 1000 km Spa-Francorchamps Prospeed Competition is a sports car racing team based in Li√©ge, Belgium.

They were typically displayed in the form of an inscription at a prominent public location such as a major temple; several of these fasti survive, but in states of varying fragmentation. Some calendars are preserved as papyri or manuscripts. One of the original purposes of Roman calendars was to mark the religious and legal status of each day, by means of letters such as C, F, and NP. By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show days marked with these letters, probably in part as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius.Michele Renee Salzman, On Roman Time: The Codex- calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity (University of California Press, 1990), pp. 17, 122.

Gain scheduling In designing feedback controllers for dynamical systems a variety of modern, multivariable controllers are used. In general, these controllers are often designed at various operating points using linearized models of the system dynamics and are scheduled as a function of a parameter or parameters for operation at intermediate conditions. It is an approach for the control of non-linear systems that uses a family of linear controllers, each of which provides satisfactory control for a different operating point of the system. One or more observable variables, called the scheduling variables, are used to determine the current operating region of the system and to enable the appropriate linear controller. For example, in case of aircraft control, a set of controllers are designed at different gridded locations of corresponding parameters such as AoA, Mach, dynamic pressure, CG etc. In brief, gain scheduling is a control design approach that constructs a nonlinear controller for a nonlinear plant by patching together a collection of linear controllers. These linear controllers are blended in real-time via switching or interpolation. Scheduling multivariable controllers can be very tedious and time-consuming task. A new paradigm is the linear parameter-varying (LPV) techniques which synthesize of automatically scheduled multivariable controller. =Drawbacks of classical gain scheduling= * An important drawback of classical gain scheduling approach is that adequate performance and in some cases even stability is not guaranteed at operating conditions other than the design points. * Scheduling multivariable controllers is often a tedious and time-consuming task and it holds true especially in the field of aerospace control where the parameter dependency of controllers are large due to increased operating envelopes with more demanding performance requirements. * It is also important that the selected scheduling variables reflect changes in plant dynamics as operating conditions change. It is possible in gain scheduling to incorporate linear robust control methodologies into nonlinear control design; however the global stability, robustness and performance properties are not addressed explicitly in the design process. Though the approach is simple and the computational burden of linearization scheduling approaches is often much less than for other nonlinear design approaches, its inherent drawbacks outweigh its advantages and necessitates a new paradigm for the control of dynamical systems. New methodologies such as Adaptive control based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy logic etc. try to address such problems, the lack of proof of stability and performance of such approaches over entire operating parameter regime requires design of a parameter dependent controller with guaranteed properties for which, a Linear Parameter Varying controller could be an ideal candidate. Linear parameter-varying systems LPV systems are a very special class of nonlinear systems which appears to be well suited for control of dynamical systems with parameter variations. In general, LPV techniques provide a systematic design procedure for gain-scheduled multivariable controllers. This methodology allows performance, robustness and bandwidth limitations to be incorporated into a unified framework. A brief introduction on the LPV systems and the explanation of terminologies are given below. =Parameter dependent systems= In control engineering, a state-space representation is a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, u output, y and state variables, x related by first-order differential equations. The dynamic evolution of a nonlinear, non-autonomous system is represented by ::\\\\dot{x} = f(x,u,t) If the system is time variant ::\\\\dot{x} = f(x(t),u(t),t),x(t_0) ::x(t_0)=x_0 ,u(t_0)=u_0 The state variables describe the mathematical \\"state\\" of a dynamical system and in modeling large complex nonlinear systems if such state variables are chosen to be compact for the sake of practicality and simplicity, then parts of dynamic evolution of system are missing. The state space description will involve other variables called exogenous variables whose evolution is not understood or is too complicated to be modeled but affect the state variables evolution in a known manner and are measurable in real-time using sensors. When a large number of sensors are used, some of these sensors measure outputs in the system theoretic sense as known, explicit nonlinear functions of the modeled states and time, while other sensors are accurate estimates of the exogenous variables. Hence, the model will be a time varying, nonlinear system, with the future time variation unknown, but measured by the sensors in real-time. In this case, if w(t),w denotes the exogenous variable vector, and x(t) denotes the modeled state, then the state equations are written as ::\\\\dot{x} =f(x(t),w(t),\\\\dot{w}(t),u(t)) The parameter w is not known but its evolution is measured in real time and used for control. If the above equation of parameter dependent system is linear in time then it is called Linear Parameter Dependent systems. They are written similar to Linear Time Invariant form albeit the inclusion in time variant parameter. ::\\\\dot{x}=A(w(t))x(t)+B(w(t))u(t) ::y=C(w(t))x(t)+D(w(t))u(t) Parameter- dependent systems are linear systems, whose state-space descriptions are known functions of time-varying parameters. The time variation of each of the parameters is not known in advance, but is assumed to be measurable in real time. The controller is restricted to be a linear system, whose state-space entries depend causally on the parameter‚Äôs history. There exist three different methodologies to design a LPV controller namely, # Linear fractional transformations which relies on the small gain theorem for bounds on performance and robustness. # Single Quadratic Lyapunov Function (SQLF) # Parameter Dependent Quadratic Lyapunov Function (PDQLF) to bound the achievable level of performance. These problems are solved by reformulating the control design into finite-dimensional, convex feasibility problems which can be solved exactly, and infinite-dimensional convex feasibility problems which can be solved approximately. This formulation constitutes a type of gain scheduling problem and contrast to classical gain scheduling, this approach address the effect of parameter variations with assured stability and performance.

John Gordon supported the chief of his family, his cousin the Earl of Huntly against the Earl of Moray. After Huntly's defeat at Corrichie, he went into exile, and shortly after his return to Scotland he was murdered by a kinswoman. Minority John Gordon was the son of Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland and Lady Janet Stewart. His father Alexander was the son of Lady Elizabeth de Moravia, 10th Countess of Sutherland (sister of John de Moravia, 9th Earl of Sutherland) and Adam Gordon, younger son of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly. His mother Janet was the daughter of John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl and Janet Campbell. Elizabeth de Moravia and her husband Adam quashed a rival claimant to the earldom of Sutherland in 1518, at the Battle of Alltachuilain. Alexander Gordon was made Earl of Sutherland in December 1527, when his mother, the Countess Elizabeth de Moravia, resigned her rights. Alexander died in 1530, and Lady Janet Stewart married Hugh Kennedy of Girvanmains, and subsequently, Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven. John, although still a minor, attended the Parliament of Scotland, in December 1543, that rejected the Treaty of Greenwich. Some time after May 1544, John married Lady Elizabeth Campbell, daughter of Colin Campbell, 3rd Earl of Argyll. She was the Countess of Moray, being the widow of James Stewart, Earl of Moray, who was the son of King James IV of Scotland by his mistress, Janet Kennedy. On 4 May 1546, John was formally made Earl of Sutherland. In the following year, he commanded part of the rear guard at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh.Fraser, William, ed., Sutherland Book, vol.1 (1892), pp.92, 98-102, 105 His wife Elizabeth died in 1547, and in 1548, John married, as his second wife, Lady Helen Stewart, who had previously been married to William Hay, 6th Earl of Erroll. She was the daughter of John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox, and her sister, Lady Elizabeth Stewart, who had an illegitimate son with King James V of Scotland; this son was Adam Stewart, Prior of Perth Charterhouse.Fraser, William, ed., Sutherland Book, vol.1 (1892), p.107 Regency of Mary of Guise In the Autumn of 1554 Mary of Guise paid for a ship, troops and a cannon to be used by John, 11th Earl of Sutherland and his step-brother Hugh Kennedy of Girvanmains to arrest Iye du Mackay, chief of the Clan Mackay, who had caused mischief in Sutherland. They sailed in the Lion and captured Borve Castle, Sutherland. Kennedy subsequently captured Iye Mackay and brought him to Edinburgh.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 10 (1913), 233-4 Exile and death In September 1562, Mary, Queen of Scots and her half-brother James Stewart newly made Earl of Moray came north to Inverness and Aberdeen. Their discussions with John's cousin the Earl of Huntly led to armed conflict. After the battle of Corrichie, secret letters between John Gordon and the Earl of Huntly were discovered. John Gordon fled to Louvain in Flanders. At the Parliament of Scotland on 28 May 1563, in the presence of Queen Mary, Huntly and Sutherland were forfeited.Bain, Joseph, ed., Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.2 (1900), p.10 In 1565 Queen Mary of Scotland restored the Earls of Huntly, Sutherland and others of the name Gordon who had been forfeited. The Earl of Sutherland was invited to return to Scotland. The Earl of Bedford, Governor of Berwick on Tweed sent a privateer called Wilson who carried Swedish letters of marque to intercept his ship, and the Earl was imprisoned at Berwick. Sutherland was considered a danger to English policy in Scotland. Mary, Queen of Scots, demanded the release of the Earl, who was now sick with an ague. Bedford wrote to Elizabeth on his behalf. The Earl was released in February 1566 after the assurance that he was reconciled with the Earl of Moray. On his return he married Marie Seton, daughter of Lord Seton. Both were poisoned at Helmsdale Castle by Isobel Sinclair, and died at Dunrobin Castle on 23 June 1567.Fraser, William, ed., Sutherland Book, vol.1 (1892), pp.121-4, 127-9 References Category:1567 deaths Category:16th- century Scottish people Category:1525 births Category:Earls of Sutherland John Category:People murdered in Scotland Category:Deaths by poisoning ","title":"John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland"},{"id":"38364069","text":"Hamish MacDonald DA PAI (1935-2008) was a Scottish impressionist and colourist artist from Glasgow, Scotland.\\"Hamish MacDonald\\".

Biography  Dawes experimented with keyboards before picking up his first electric guitar at age twelve. He switched to steel-string acoustic guitar in 2008. From late 2008 to late 2011, Dawes performed instrumental concerts at venues and festivals throughout the United Kingdom both solo, and with a concert harp player. During this time, he performed alongside musicians including Seth Lakeman, Tommy Emmanuel, and Newton Faulkner.Acoustic Magazine Issue 70 In 2009, he released an independent EP titled Reflections, as well as gaining features on two discs in the AGF (Acoustic Guitar Forum) franchise. In 2012, Dawes signed with Wisconsin-based CandyRat Records. He released a technically virtuosic arrangement of \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" by Gotye on 19 June. MSN News and Reddit featured him on the front page of their websites. Gotye (Walter De Backer) himself publicly praised the arrangement: \\"It's a really beautiful piece of music. It's wonderfully arranged. It's just a fantastic piece of music. I also like the instrumental interpretation because it gives a different perspective on the musical arrangement. It's not about how somebody's voice transmits the story of the relationship.\\" Dawes' next release was another Candyrat single, this time dual-released with an independent collaborative remix featuring Helsinki-based guitarist Petteri Sariola and Adam 'Nolly' Getgood from the US band Periphery. Ten per cent of the proceeds of all independent releases went to FAB Projects, a Kenyan charity providing food, aid, and building projects in the region. His What Just Happened? world tour visited over 30 countries on five continents, including performances on the Great Wall of China and the Troubadour in Los Angeles, as well as the first fingerstyle guitar concert in Lebanon's history. 2016 saw Dawes become the first acoustic artist signed by DiMarzio, sharing a roster with the likes of John Petrucci, Steve Vai, and Joe Satriani, as he co- designed the Black Angel magnetic soundhole pickup with Larry Dimarzio and Nick Benjamin. He began a monthly video and print column with Guitar World in the US and taught as a special guest mentor on season 2 of Sky TV's Guitar Star. ERA, his second album, was released independently on Dawes' own QTEN Records imprint (King Records in Japan + C&L; Music in South Korea) in September 2017. The lead single, a one-man cover of Metallica's \\"One\\", gained around 40 million hits in its first fortnight online through Metal Hammer, Viral Thread, and Dawes' own YouTube channel. The single also gained the attention of the progressive metal community worldwide, a fanbase often present at Dawes' concerts. He was also featured on AMC's Better Call Saul playing percussion and additional guitar on \\"Cold Feet\\", a song created in a session with Fink. The 2018 Moody Blues Cruise saw Dawes share the stage with Cathy Richardson of Jefferson Starship while opening for the Orchestra featuring members of ELO. In addition to playing as a solo artist, Mike also plays guitar in the synth-pop group Nik Mystery, together with Spencer Sotelo (Periphery) and Jukka Backlund.  Influences and gear  Dawes is heavily influenced by folk, pop, and rock music as well as other fingerstyle players such as Michael Hedges, Pierre Bensusan, and Eric Roche. In 2017, he performed with Andreas Cuntz and Nick Benjamin guitars. He owns and performs with #100 and #138 Benjamin guitars. He also uses D'Addario strings, DiMarzio pickups, G7th capos, finger extensions, and the Tonewood Amp device.  Awards  Late 2017 saw Dawes named as the 'Best Acoustic Guitarist in the World Right Now' by MusicRadar and Total Guitars end-of-year poll. This title was awarded again in 2018.

It is occupied by a ruined castle, the Burgruine Schwanau, a chapel and a restaurant. Administratively the island lies within the municipality of Lauerz, but it is owned by the canton of Schwyz. The island is situated some off the south shore of the lake, close to the lakeside village of Lauerz. Its highest point is above normal lake level or above sea level. It is the largest of the two islands in Lake Lauerz (the other being Roggenburg). The island is accessible by a public passenger ferry from the nearby shore. Access for persons with limited mobility is possible by use of a specially adapted boat and an inclined elevator to the terrace level where the castle, chapel and restaurant are located. History Chapel, restaurant and castle Aerial view (1960) Traces of occupation on the island date back to around 1200 BC. There is little documentary evidence relating to the castle, but it is believed to have been built at the end of the 12th century and to have been ruined, probably as a result of a fire, as early as the middle of the 13th century. The island in known to have been occupied by hermits at various times, including the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1684 a chapel was built on the island, but this was destroyed by the tsunami that followed the 1806 Goldau landslide. In 1808 the council of the church in Schwyz sold the island to General Ludwig Auf der Maur on the provision that he rebuild the chapel. The island remained in the possession of the general's descendants until 1967, when it was purchased by the canton of Schwyz. In 2009 it was completely renovated.

It is approximately west of Invermere near the Commander Glacier and around the headwaters of Jumbo Creek in the Purcell Range of the Columbia Mountains.GeoBC Jumbo Glacier was planned to be a year-round skiing mountain resort developed in three phases at an estimated cost of $450 million. The future resort development had been the subject of controversy as a result of public opposition from the residents of the region, the Lower Kootenay First Nation and the Sinixt Nation for political, economic, and environmental reasons.MacLeod: 2012piq-s-mx-ikn - Jumbo Glacier It is the subject of the documentary, Jumbo Wild, by Patagonia and Sweetgrass Productions. In January 2020, a plan to designate the area as Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area was revealed instead and the remaining interest of the company formed to develop the ski resort was bought out, ultimately cancelling the development of the resort.  History  Jumbo Mountain and its glacier were named after a mining claim established on nearby Toby Creek in 1890. The stakeholders hoped it would be a large, productive mine, and named it after Jumbo, P. T. Barnum's popular performing elephant. Although the mine was productive for several years, it did not last into the 20th century.Boles, pg. 140 The idea of developing a recreational resort in the Jumbo Valley was first presented to the British Columbia government in 1990 by a consortium of investors called Glacier Resorts Ltd.CBC In 1993, the proposal was approved for further consultation and review, including preparation of environmental impact assessments. These were not completed until 2004. The same year, representatives from the Ktunaxa Nation went public with concerns about the proposal, specifically about its impact on grizzly bears and other wildlife. Opposition to the project grew, resulting in a 2010 protest in Victoria, the provincial capital. The proposal process continued, and over the next two years final approvals were granted. Letters patent to incorporate Jumbo Glacier as a municipality was approved by order in council on November 19, 2012. Its formal date of incorporation was February 19, 2013.  Government  The Government of British Columbia appointed Jumbo Glacier's first municipal council for a term beginning February 19, 2013, its official incorporation date, and ending November 30, 2014, at which point local governance will align with the province's general municipal election cycle. Despite not yet having any residents, the first municipal council consisted of a mayor, Greg Deck of Radium Hot Springs, and two councillors, Nancy Hugunin of Fairmont Hot Springs and Steve Ostrander of Invermere. Phil Taylor of Golden was appointed the municipality's interim chief officer to serve in advance of the official incorporation date until the first municipal council meeting.Rooney  Proposed development  The approved resort proposal would have involved over $450 million in new construction and a major new road into the remote area. Pheidias Project Management Corporation of Vancouver is heading the development plans. The new resort was planned to include 1,360 residential units, two hotels, 23 lifts and gondolas, and a village centre with retail stores and amenities.ESPN Construction was planned to be completed by 2015, but the environmental assessment certificate expired before construction had begun.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/controversial-jumbo- glacier-resort-not-substantially-started-in-b-c-1.3119214  See also  *Jumbo (disambiguation) *List of communities in British Columbia *List of municipalities in British Columbia *Sun Peaks, British Columbia, the only other community incorporated \\"mountain resort municipality\\" in the province  References     *  External links  *Jumbo Glacier Resort *Jumbo Glacier Resort Master Plan, Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations, Government of British Columbia Category:Mountain resort municipalities in British Columbia Category:Purcell Mountains ","title":"Jumbo Glacier, British Columbia"},{"id":"38364200","text":"Gamvik Airport () is a disused general aviation airport located at Slettnes outside the village of Gamvik in Gamvik, Norway. History A Finnmark County Municipality-appointed committee which in published a report in 1966 recommending Mehamn as one of six regional airports in Troms og Finnmark. As Finnmark had lowest priority on the state-financed construction of regional airports, Norving took initiative to start construction of smaller and simpler airfields in select communities, including Gamvik.Melling: 64 The airline also looked into two other locations on Nordkinnhalv√∏ya, Mehamn and Kj√∏llefjord.Melling: 66 The main motivation for an airport was the difficulties of transporting patients to the hospital. Until a quay was built in 1971, the Hurtigruten ships anchored up and patients had to be freight to the ship by boat before venturing on the voyage to the hospital.Melling: 76 The airline therefore contacted the municipality in December 1969 and proposed that an airfield be built within a year, which it could operate with its Britten-Norman Islander aircraft.Melling: 65 When the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) started planning an airport for the area, it considered both Kj√∏llefjord, Mehamn and Gamvik as locations for the regional airport. In early 1971 mean time Norving and local interest started looking for a suitable site in Gamvik. A committee was created for the task, which initiated a cooperation with the municipality. It was possible to take advantage of the weather station and radio navigation equipment at Slettnes Lighthouse. A gravel runway was estimated to cost 76,000 Norwegian krone, in addition to simple runway lights. Initially the CAA supported Gamvik as a location for a regional airport, in part because of the lower investment costs. The municipal council in Gamvik instead chose the municipal center of Mehamn, from Gamvik. The Gamvik chapter of the Norwegian Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps started fund-raising for Gamvik to build its own airport. It applied to the municipality, but no public funds were granted. Norving was the main contributor, funding NOK 53,000. The population of Gamvik of between 400 and 500 people donated NOK 60,000. A new committee was established and they started construction after the spring thaw started in June 1971. Within five weeks of runway had been built. The airport opened on 29 August.Melling: 77 The airfield was used for Norving's air ambulance and air taxi service which was flown using the Britten-Norman Islander. The operation of the airport was carried out as a cooperation between Gamvik Search and Rescue Corps and Norving. Yngvar Svendsen, the airline's contact person in Gamvik, was responsible for operations and manned the radio. For the first ten months he worked free of charge.Melling: 79 Norving applied in 1972 to establish a scheduled taxi route from Gamvik.Melling: 97 Mehamn Airport opened in 1974 along with an all-year road between Gamvik and Mehamn, which resulted in Gamvik Airport being reduced to an emergency airport. Facilities The airport was located at Slettnes outside Gamvik. The airport had an gravel runway. Travel distance to Mehamn was 20 minutes and to Kj√∏llefjord one hour.

It was developed in 1989 by Social Accountability International, formerly the Council on Economic Priorities, by an advisory board consisting of trade unions, NGOs, civil society organizations and companies. The SA8000's criteria were developed from various industry and corporate codes to create a common standard for social welfare compliance. Certification  SA8000 certification is a management systems standard, modeled on ISO standards. The criteria require that facilities seeking to gain and maintain certification must go beyond simple compliance to the standard. Prospective facilities must integrate it into their management practices and demonstrate ongoing compliance with the standard. SA8000 is based on the principles of international human rights norms as described in International Labour Organization conventions, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It measures the performance of companies in eight areas important to social accountability in the workplace: child labour, forced labour, health and safety, free association and collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours and compensation. Performance criteria  It also requires compliance with eight performance criteria, as outlined on the Social Accountability International website. * Child Labor: No use or support of child labor; policies and written procedures for remediation of children found to be working in situation; provide adequate financial and other support to enable such children to attend school; and employment of young workers conditional. * Forced and Compulsory Labor: No use or support for forced or compulsory labor; no required 'deposits' - financial or otherwise; no withholding salary, benefits, property or documents to force personnel to continue work; personnel right to leave premises after workday; personnel free to terminate their employment; and no use nor support for human trafficking. * Health and Safety: Provide a safe and healthy workplace; prevent potential occupational accidents; appoint senior manager to ensure OSH; instruction on OSH for all personnel; system to detect, avoid, respond to risks; record all accidents; provide personal protection equipment and medical attention in event of work-related injury; remove, reduce risks to new and expectant mothers; hygiene- toilet, potable water, sanitary food storage; decent dormitories- clean, safe, meet basic needs; and worker right to remove from imminent danger. * Freedom of Association and Right to Collective Bargaining: Respect the right to form and join trade unions and bargain collectively.

St John of God Health Care built and operates the hospitals under a public-private partnership with the Western Australian state government. St John of God Midland Public Hospital has replaced the nearby Swan District Hospital. St John of God Midland Public and Private Hospitals are divisions of St John of God Health Care, a Catholic not-for-profit health care group, serving communities with hospitals, home nursing, and social outreach services throughout Australia, New Zealand and the wider Asia-Pacific region. History Since 1954 the Midland area has been served by Swan District Hospital, which initially opened as a maternity hospital, and expanded to a general hospital in 1963. The hospital was further developed in 1971 and 2001. In September 2005, the then Health Minister Jim McGinty announced that the hospital would be upgraded to a 326-bed general hospital, either through redevelopment of the existing campus, or construction of a new campus in Midland. He confirmed in November 2005 that a new hospital would be built at the site of the former Midland Railway Workshops. In March 2010 Health Minister Kim Hames confirmed that the new $360 million Midland Health Campus would be provided by a private operator, under a public-private partnership. Expressions of interest were called for in October 2010, with St John of God Health Care announced as the campus operator on 14 June 2012. St John of God Health Care's plan included a 60-bed private hospital, which some shared services with a 307-bed public hospital. Construction began in August 2012, and the hospital opened on 24 November 2015 with Swan District Hospital closing at the same time. Curtin University has commenced construction of a new medical campus to be based near St John of God Midland Public and Private Hospitals. The campus is expected to be operational by late 2019. Services Midland Public Hospital provides a range of medical and surgical services. The public hospital includes an emergency department, critical care unit, maternity unit, neonatology unit, paediatric unit, mental health unit, and various clinical support services. The private hospital provides specialist medical and surgical care for both inpatients and day surgery patients. = Services not offered = St John of God Health Care, in accordance with its Catholic values, will not provide some procedures and services, including abortion, sterilisation, contraception, and assisted reproductive technology. In April 2012, the state government expected that this would affect approximately 250 out of 29,000 patients in the hospital's first year after opening. Terry O'Gorman, president of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, said that this would compromise the principle of secular public services, and called for contract conditions to require patients to be referred elsewhere. The Opposition's health spokesman, Roger Cook, called for the government to cancel the contract with St John of God Health Care. Subsequently, the government revealed that termination, sterilisation, and contraceptive procedures would be performed by another service provider within the public hospital. Assisted reproductive technology, which was not offered at Swan District Hospital, remained at King Edward Memorial Hospital.  Social outreach  St John of God Social Outreach provides a range of community care services in the Midland community, including: * Care for Aboriginal women and their families when they are pregnant through the Moort Boodjari Mia service. * St John of God Raphael Services provides perinatal infant mental health care and undertakes research. Staffed by mental health clinicians, Raphael Services provide free support for parents and families affected by anxiety, depression and other mental health difficulties during pregnancy and in the postnatal period. The services also provide counselling and support for parents undergoing prenatal testing or who have experienced pregnancy loss.

Jewish communities in Leipzig existed as early as the 13th century.\\"Or Zarua\\" Isaac ben Moses of Vienna Discrimination against the Jews of Leipzig was recorded as early as 1349 and perpetuated under Nazi influence.Deutsch, G., & Porges, N., n.d. Jewish Encyclopedia Vol. 12. \\"Leipsic\\". Despite mass Jewish deportations and emigration forced by the Nazis in the 1930s and 1940s, Leipzig's Jewish community began to grow again in 1945 and continues to grow today.Records of the Leipzig Jewish Community 1422‚Äì1997  Jewish life in Leipzig (pre-1933)  = 13th century = Leipzig Trade Fair The first documentation of the existence of a Jewish community within Leipzig came from a collection of responsa between 1250 and 1285 that was compiled by Rabbi Yitshak ben Moshe of Vienna, the famous Isaac Or Zarua or Riaz. In one particular responsum, Rabbi Yitshak acts as an arbitrator in a dispute between his son-in-law from Leipzig and a Jew from another town. The documentation of his answer to the dispute indicated that the Jews of Leipzig already had a synagogue at this time, and their main source of income appeared to come from finance. Jews in Leipzig were generally respected at this time, largely due to their success in commercial trade. In 1248, Duke Heinrich the Enlightened published a document thanking Leipzig's Jews for their contributions to the commercial development of Leipzig. Leipzig's central location attracted Jewish traders from all over Europe to the Leipzig Trade Fair, an important fair that cultivated foreign relations among European nations and served as a meeting place for politicians. The Trade Fair regulations of 1268 reflected this as well, as Jewish merchants were granted rights equal to the rights enjoyed by Christian merchants, and the market day was changed from Saturday to Friday in respect for the Jewish Sabbath. The relatively relaxed merchant regulations made the Leipzig fairs very popular across Europe. = 14th century = As far back as 1349, the Jews of Leipzig began to face discrimination. In February 1349, Margrave Frederick \\"the Earnest\\" exterminated Leipzig's entire Jewish population by burning. Their residences and other belongings were confiscated. After the mass expulsions in the aftermath of the Black Death (1348‚Äì1349), eventually, Jews were permitted to return to Leipzig. For a short while, Jews experienced many rights and privileges they had before 1349. By 1352, a synagogue had been established in Leipzig. In 1359, records mention a Judengasse (Jewish Street) and a Judenburg (Jewish Town). Jews were relatively safe in Leipzig at this time, and they did have some protections, but anti-Jewish regulations grew in prevalence and severity over time. = 15th century = By the beginning of the 15th century, Jews were faced with harsh regulations aimed to discriminate against their culture. Starting with a ban on public prayers within synagogues, the regulations reached a radical peak in 1430, when the Jews of Leipzig were expelled from Saxony, and their property was also confiscated. The Jews were still valued as merchants, however, as they continued to be admitted to Leipzig for the fair, but with many restrictions. They were not allowed to stay in Leipzig any time outside of fair days, every Jew who came to the Leipzig fair was required to pay protection many and present documentation issued by authorities, and they were forbidden from selling on the main streets or during Sundays and Christian holidays. = 16th, 17th, and 18th century = As Jews were, for the most part, only allowed short stays in the city between the 16th and 18th century, a permanent Jewish community was virtually non-existent. The Jewish presence in Leipzig consisted mainly of traders and merchants that remained only for the duration of Leipzig's Trade Fair. Between 1668 and 1764, 82,000 Jews attended these fairs, and played a major role in the development of Leipzig as a center for trade. Due to the overwhelming number of Jews temporarily staying in Leipzig during fair periods, many merchants established prayer rooms. An authorized synagogue, the Brody synagogue, was established in the Br√ºhl, Leipzig, in 1763, and Jews taking part in the Fair stayed in the Br√ºhl and the surrounding streets and alleys. In 1713, Gerd Levi of Hamburg, a mintmaster and purveyor, was the first Jew to be granted citizenship in Leipzig since the event of February 1349. This was the first of what is considered the \\"privileged\\" Jewish households that were allowed residence in Leipzig. By the middle of the 18th century, the number of permanent Jewish settlements grew to seven, and by the end of the century there were roughly 50 Jewish merchants and their households living in Leipzig. Adolph Jellinek, the first Chief Rabbi of Leipzig = 19th century = The old Leipzig Synagogue, before it was destroyed by the Nazi Regime on KristallnachtThe beginning of the 19th century marked a revival of the Leipzig Jewish community. Starting in 1810, Polish Jews who came to Leipzig to trade were allowed to stay. From there, the Jewish community expanded. Jews were once again allowed to hold public prayer services, and in 1815 the municipal council agreed to open Leipzig's first Jewish cemetery. On May 18, 1837, Leipzig's growing Jewish community received permission to form a religious community, though their request for permission to build a synagogue was not granted. On August 16, 1838, they were granted civil rights, with the exception of municipal and political rights. During this time, Jews began to take a more active role in Leipzig's academics. In 1839, Julius Fuerst became the first Jew to lecture at the University of Leipzig. Leipzig Jews even served in prominent judicial positions during this time, like Martin Eduard Sigismund von Simson, who served as the president of the law courts in Leipzig from 1879 until 1891. However, it was nearly impossible for Ostenjuden, foreign Jews, to obtain Saxon citizenship. In order to do so, Ostenjuden had to be born in Leipzig and 21 years of age, or a resident of Saxony for at least thirty years.Grubel, Fred and Mecklenburg, Frank. Leipzig: profile of a Jewish community during the first years of Nazi Germany Vol. 42. New York: Leo Baeck Institute, 1997. pp.159. The Jewish community as an officially state- recognized organisation was established only in 1847 and only by then were Jews allowed to settle in Leipzig without any restrictions. Reform movements of the mid-19th century eventually led to the construction of the Leipzig Synagogue in 1855, nearly two decades after Rabbi Zechariah Frankel attempted to found a Synagogue in Leipzig in 1837 and was rejected. The first Rabbi to serve the Jewish community in Leipzig was Rabbi Dr. Adolph Jellinek, who served from 1848 to 1855 and set the precedent of the Chief Rabbi's role in uniting the Jewish community of Leipzig. Towards the end of the 19th century, Antisemitism began to intensify. Several Antisemitic newspapers began to appear around this time, and the frequency of targeted harassment and discrimination against Jews increased. = Early 20th century = One Rabbi, in particular, that was especially prominent in liberal Jewish activism within Germany, Rabbi Dr. Felix Goldmann, assumed the role of Chief Rabbi of Leipzig in 1917. Rabbi Goldmann helped found the Jewish Agency for Palestine and Keren Hayesod, and he was also praised for his scientific work and works discussing Antisemitism. The Jewish community continued to grow steadily during this time. By the beginning of the 20th century, there were approximately 6,000 Jewish inhabitants in Leipzig. In 1910, that number grew to 9,728, and by 1925 Leipzig officially held the largest Jewish community in Saxony with 13,047 Jews. During this peak in the Jewish population, many Leipzig Jews were members of the upper-middle-class, which included businessmen, craftspeople, white-collar workers, physicians, and lawyers. The Jewish community of Leipzig established several programs to help the needy, and by the start of World War I there were 48 active charities. Various charitable institutions were opened during this time, including a Jewish hospital founded by Haim Eitingon in 1928, and a Jewish retirement home was established by the Ariowitsch family around the same time. As a result of the Nazi's rise to power, Leipzig's Jewish population decreased. The German Reich completed a population census on May 19, 1939, in which they determined that 0.5% of Leipzig's citizens were Jewish, where 4,470 were Jews by descent and 4,113 by religion.Blau, Bruno. The Jewish Population 1939‚Äì1945 Vol. 12 No. 2. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press 2018. pp. 164.  Nazi rule (1922‚Äì1945)  = The NSDAP = The NSDAP created a Leipzig chapter in 1922, indicating the first Nazi presence in the area.Gibas, D. M., Briel, D. C., Knoller, P., and Held, S., 2009. \\"Aryanization\\" in Leipzig Drive out. Robbed. Murdered. pp. 4. http://www.juedischesleipzig.de/arisierung_engl09.pdf (March 20, 2018). The NSDAP regional administrative authority, along with the head revenue office and state police, were responsible for the implementation of Anti-Jewish policies. In the Fall of 1939, the NSDAP created Judenhauser, in which Jewish residents and non-Jewish spouses of \\"mixed-marriages\\" were forced to live in close quarters.Gibas, D. M., Briel, D. C., Knoller, P., and Held, S., 2009. \\"Aryanization\\" in Leipzig Drive out. Robbed. Murdered. pp. 16. http://www.juedischesleipzig.de/arisierung_engl09.pdf (March 20, 2018). Families were constantly shuffled throughout Judenhauser, with some forced to move seven times in a year.Wahrman, Shlomo, Lest we forget: Growing up in Nazi Leipzig, 1933‚Äì1939. Brooklyn NY: Mesorah Publication, 1991. pp. 132. = Emigration = Leipzig's Jewish community assembled a department to deal with the anticipated emigration of the city's Jewish families.Grubel, Fred and Mecklenburg, Frank. Leipzig: profile of a Jewish community during the first years of Nazi Germany Vol. 42. New York: Leo Baeck Institute, 1997. pp.162. The department worked closely with Palastina-Ami to ensure safe arrival to Erez Israel, and with Hilfsverein der Juden in Deutschland for emigration to all other countries. However, receiving the proper paperwork to emigrate was rather difficult for Leipzig's Jews. In order to obtain the necessary certificates, Jews had to be trained for specific types of labor in which their target country was in need of. Because many of Leipzig's Jews worked in business and the fur trade which was not needed in the country they wished to emigrate to, many of them enrolled in re-training courses where they learned blue-collar jobs such as bricklaying or carpentry.Grubel, Fred and Mecklenburg, Frank. Leipzig: profile of a Jewish community during the first years of Nazi Germany Vol. 42. New York: Leo Baeck Institute, 1997. pp.163. = Political life = The city's mayor from 1930 to 1937, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, although being national-conservative, was a noted opponent of the Nazi regime in Germany. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. In mid-1938, Jews were first banned from using park benches in the Rosental Park. By the end of the year, Jews would be banned from all public parks in the city.Association of Jewish Refugees = First deportations = On October 28, 1938, Leipzig experienced its first large-scale deportation of fifty-percent of its Jewish citizens as part of the Polenaktion. Those considered as Polish nationals or stateless were transported to the Polish border by railwayGrubel, Fred and Mecklenburg, Frank. Leipzig: profile of a Jewish community during the first years of Nazi Germany Vol. 42. New York: Leo Baeck Institute, 1997. pp.164. and dropped in ZbƒÖszy≈Ñ, a forested area just across the border between Poland and Germany.Wahrman, Shlomo, Lest we forget: Growing up in Nazi Leipzig, 1933‚Äì1939. Brooklyn NY: Mesorah Publication, 1991. pp. 80. Martin Kapel experienced this deportation first hand when he and his family were forced onto a crowded train, transported across the country, and forced to march into Poland following the lead of the SS.Kapel, M., Chapters 1‚Äì4 http://holocaustlearning.org/martin-kapel (March 20, 2018). He notes that some of the prisoners on the march were too old to walk, others carrying children, and some were taken straight from their hospital beds. In accordance with a separate account, Zindel Grynszpan testified that he and his family were forced off of the train nearly a mile away from the polish border. As the group of Jews headed toward the Polish border, SS men whipped them, and those who fell faced severe beatings. = Pogromnacht (Kristallnacht ) = On Pogromnacht in 1938, 553 Jewish men were arrested, centers of Jewish communal life were destroyed as well as one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue. In fact, three synagogues were bombed and their sacred records and objects destroyed.Wahrman, Shlomo, Lest we forget: Growing up in Nazi Leipzig, 1933‚Äì1939. Brooklyn NY: Mesorah Publication, 1991. pp. 105. The Brody Synagogue and the ceremony hall of the Jewish cemetery were also damaged heavily on this night. Jewish tombstones were broken and graves exhumed, and of those exhumed, nearly 10 peoples remained unburied for nearly a week because many grave diggers had been arrested.Wahrman, Shlomo, Lest we forget: Growing up in Nazi Leipzig, 1933‚Äì1939. Brooklyn NY: Mesorah Publication, 1991. pp. 106. Along with Jewish places of worship, Jewish businesses like Bamberger and Hertz were damaged during Kristallnacht. Additionally, the windows of the Br√ºhl were smashed and costly furs stolen. Jewish properties not completely destroyed would be 'Aryanized' by the Nazis for the duration of World War Two. = Final deportations = The deportations of German-Jewish citizens from Leipzig began on January 21, 1942 until February 13, 1945 when the last 220 Jews were deported to Theresienstadt. In addition, Jews who could not travel, like the elderly, were forced to live in Judenhauser. The Nazis wished to avoid the creation of a ghetto but did not want to have a scattered Jewish population throughout the city. Following the deportation of Leipzig's Jews, the Germany's Revenue office visited the abandoned homes to confiscate any furniture, jewelry, and clothing that was left behind.Gibas, D. M., Briel, D. C., Knoller, P., and Held, S., 2009. \\"Aryanization\\" in Leipzig Drive out. Robbed. Murdered. pp. 32. http://www.juedischesleipzig.de/arisierung_engl09.pdf (March 20, 2018). These belongings were later sold by the Revenue office and the Hans Klemm Auction House for cheap prices to \\"Aryan\\" purchasers.  Post-WWII  In total, nearly 2,000 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Nazi extermination camps. By 1945 there were only 15 Jews remaining in the city at which point 200 came back from Theresienstadt to form the Jewish community once again. =Aryanization in Leipzig= Aryanization, or \\"De-Jewification\\", of Jewish businesses during Nazi rule from 1933 to 1945 was intended to rid the German economy of Jewish influence and cease the Nazi anticipation towards the \\"planned\\" destruction of the German way of life by the Jews. Newly implemented laws such as the Aryan Clause and the Nuremberg Race Laws classified Jews as \\"racially inferior\\" and, as a result, the Nazi party was slowly vocalizing their most important goal; excluding the Jews from the German way of life. Through racially biased economic policies, boycotts fueled by propaganda, and overall confiscation of Jewish property, the Nazi regime was able to exclude the Jews from German business life and eventually from the general populace which, in turn, systematically drove the Jewish emigration out of Germany. The M. Joske & Co. department store For nearly 30 years, Michaelis-Max Joske had operated a department store named M. Joske & Company. During the April boycott of 1933, his two sons, Hans and Julius, who were acting managers and partners, were ordered to stand at the entrance of the store while they were taunted and humiliated. Activists intimidated customers and blocked the entrance to the shop. Additionally, on the windows of the M. Joske department store, as well as many other shops, anti-Semitic slogans were drawn. Due to this interaction between the two sons and the boy-cotters, the store's customers began to slowly avoid making purchases here and new customers were not taking their place. Eventually, due to this loss in revenue, Julius had to file for bankruptcy which resulted in the company being liquidated and sold at auction. Deutsche Bank On April 1, 1933, the day of the nationwide anti-Jewish boycott, after a year of pressure by NSDAP functionaries on the Deutsche Bank‚Äôs supervisory board to dismiss Jewish members of the board, members of the NSBO demanded that Jewish employees be removed from the company. Following this confrontation, only a few employees received a termination of their contracts, but internal pressure was starting to bubble up beneath the board of members. As a result of this internal pressure, many Jewish-owned or operated branches and firms were purged or sold. In the end, more followed and between 1932 and 1935, Jewish-owned firms dropped from 100,000 to nearly 75,000. By the end of 1937, this number had fallen to only 33,000 currently operating branches. The demand for the firing of Jewish employees and board members was not the only way firms were \\"aryanized\\" or in which they aided in the process such as the Deutsche Bank. During this time, notably 1935‚Äì1940, state agencies had also been increasing the tax burden on such enterprises. Specifically, the rate of corporation tax was increased from 20% in 1935 to 40% in 1939‚Äì40. Additionally, a new supplemental tax (Mehreinkommensteuer) was introduced in early 1939 which added an additional 15% to profits that had increased from 1937 to 1938.  Leipzig fur trade  On the Br√ºhl, almost ten percent of Leipzig's Jews were a part of the city's fur industry. Most of the Jews in the fur trading industry were of Polish descent, and the excellent quality of the furs turned Leipzig into a center for the industry, along with other centers in Europe such as Paris and London. Through the 1930s, businesses along the Br√ºhl contributed to one-third of the world's fur trade. In 1933 when the Nazis began influencing politics, Jewish fur traders and their families in Leipzig suffered. The Nazis urged the public to boycott Jewish furs, which made it difficult for many Jews in Leipzig to make a living. Vulnerable on purely economic grounds, the Leipzig fur trade collapsed slightly before the Nazi crisis and during the world depression. During World War II, the removal of Jewish businesses and Allied push-back resulted in the decline of this industry. While most areas which came under regular attack included banking and department stores, the garment/shoe trade and cattle dealing were also prone to attack for being \\"Jewish\\". In Leipzig, most of the trading took place in medium-sized specialty shops where its owners were regularly held responsible for macroeconomic forces such as drastic increases in inflation. Although these businesses were not subjects of the later systemic \\"aryanization\\" used by the Nazis in which legislation was the driving force, and, instead, were harassed, in the early stages, by party functionaries and competitors, they were often still sold or even destroyed by these factors. Along with the pressure from party functionaries and competitors, occasionally banks, such as the Deutsche Bank branch in Leipzig, began to cancel credit lines and liquidate debit accounts. Even though the termination of the Deutsche Bank's business contacts with the Jewish firms were not concretely \\"aryanization\\" and were not specific to the fur trade, such business contacts got only more sparse in the future and, in the end, management/ownership would eventually be forced to turn Aryan. C. F. Peters music publishing house Former Building of Edition Peters (C.F. Peters) in Leipzig, corner of An der Verfassungslinde/Talstra√üe The C. F. Peters Music Publishing House, built in 1900 and owned by Henri Hinrichsen, thrived in one of the leading locations for German music publishing; Leipzig. Henri, a successful businessman and philanthropist soon became a target of discrimination and exclusion carried out by the Berufs- und Standesorganisationen der Musikverleger (Music Publisher's Association). After many years of pressure and discrimination, only 17 approved \\"Jewish\\" music publishers still existed in Germany, one of those being C. F. Peters. On November 10, 1938, however, chaos reached an extreme as the firm's headquarters was ransacked and the music was burned. A little over a year later, on November 15, 1939, Henri and his son Hans were expelled and a forced \\"aryanization\\" of the company began. The process was executed by SS regiment leader Gerhard Noatzke and in July 1939, a sales contract was finalized and the property, along with its buildings such as the Peters Music Library, were sold for one million Reichsmarks. Henri, his wife Martha, and their son Hans soon unsuccessfully attempted to emigrate to the United States and instead, after his wife and son had died in Brussels and Perpignan respectively, Henri was deported to Auschwitz and later murdered. Henri's other two sons, Max and Walter successfully escaped Germany and lived out their lives in London and the United States respectively. Max, the younger of the two, spent many years fighting for the recognition of his rights in the Peters catalog. Eventually, in 1951, they would be recognized by a High Court ruling and Max would go on to carry out the Leipzig tradition with his earlier founded Peters Edition Ltd. Walter successfully emigrated to the United States in 1936 and would eventually establish C. F. Peters Corp. in New York. Here he would reprint Edition Peters titles and ultimately head a highly regarded publishing house. Only nine years later, Walter would return to Leipzig for company business matters now as a US citizen and US Army Music Officer. Volksgut Five years after the April boycott of 1933, in 1938, a newly enacted ruling authorized the liquidation of the Jewish segment of the economy. Essentially, Jewish assets were declared as \\"Volksgut\\" (German: Public property). Many large and internationally affiliated companies were finally caught in the \\"aryanization\\" process such as the C. F. Peters House. By the end of the next year, 1939, the German economy had essentially been successfully \\"cleansed\\" of Jewish influence and movements now shifted towards residential areas. In particular, Jews were beginning to be evicted from their homes and relocated in sections known as \\"Judenh√§user\\" (German: Jew houses). Two years later, in 1941, with the enactment of an edict and decree, the first by the Reichssicherheitshauptamt ‚Äì RSHA (Reich Security Central Office) and the \\"Eleventh Decree to the Law on the Citizenship of the Reich\\" of 25 November 1941, Jews were prevented from emigrating out of Germany and were stripped of their German citizenship and the rights that went along with it; Jews living outside Germany were stripped of their citizenship. Confiscation of belongings and assets soon followed, and on January 21, 1942, deportations began in Leipzig to relocate Jews to newly marked Jewish homes.  Effect on Jewish population  Though most Jews were traveling merchants, in 1935 ‚Äì less than a century after its establishment ‚Äì the Jewish community in Leipzig consisted of 11,564 members,AJC Archives making it the sixth-largest Jewish community in Germany and the largest one in Saxony. Although Antisemitism was still prevalent, the community was thriving and uninfluenced by Nazi policies. The effect of Nazi policies in Leipzig is reflected in the significant decrease in Jews living in Leipzig from 1935 to 1939. The German Reich completed a population consensus on May 19, 1939. They determined that fifty-percent of Leipzig's citizens were Jewish, where 4,470 were Jews by descent and 4,113 by religion.Blau, Bruno. The Jewish Population 1939‚Äì1945 Vol. 12 No. 2. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press 2018. pp.161‚Äì172. The decrease in Leipzig's Jewish community from 1935 to 1939 may be attributed to Nazi persecution and emigration, however, the population is still significant in size at this time. Community services = Jewish community = Currently, Leipzig has the most active Jewish community in Central Germany. The one remaining synagogue to survive the war (the Brody synagogue) holds the only daily Minyan in Central Germany. Leipzig synagogue In 1989 the community numbered 30 members, but as a result of the immigration from the former Soviet Union, it began to grow. In 2012 the Jewish community numbered 1300 members. = The Mikveh = In year 2006, a Mikveh for women was built. = Jewish cemeteries = In Leipzig there are two Jewish cemeteries. The NSDAP, head revenue office, and state police decided to tear down the old Jewish cemetery on June 30, 1937 stating that the area appeared \\"overgrown\\", and the entrance was blocked by rubble.Gibas, D. M., Briel, D. C., Knoller, P., and Held, S., 2009. \\"Aryanization\\" in Leipzig Drive out. Robbed. Murdered. pp. 19. http://www.juedischesleipzig.de/arisierung_engl09.pdf (March 20, 2018). Three hundred and thirty-four Jews were exhumed and reburied together in a large grave in the New Israelite cemetery. The old Jewish cemetery became a playground for \\"Aryan\\" children. The new cemetery has been used since 1927. In April 1972, construction began for the renewal of the celebration hall, together with the refurbishment of the religious-ritual space. = Kosher stores = In the community there is a Kosher store where people can purchase products that can not be bought in local stores such as meat, wine, cheese, and more. As of 2012 the local Gemeinderabbiner (community Rabbi), Rabbi Zsolt Balla, gives kosher supervision to one of the bakeries that comes to the Tuesday and Friday farmers market, so the community can benefit from Kosher bread. Education = Early 1930s = Leipzig's schools either had the Carlebach Schule curriculum in which Jewish studies were integrated into other academic subjects, or non-Jewish schools.Wahrman, Shlomo, Lest we forget: Growing up in Nazi Leipzig, 1933‚Äì1939. Brooklyn NY: Mesorah Publication, 1991. pp. 29. Holocaust survivor, Martin Kapel, recalls attending a non-Jewish school although he was raised Jewish. He remembers that his teacher often included Nazi propaganda in their academic lessons each day. At the beginning of each term and sequentially throughout the term, the headmaster of Martin's school would stand in front of the student body holding a large swastika flag and made a speech filled with Nazi propaganda. Following the speech, the children were expected to raise their arms in the Nazi salute and sing the German National Anthem and Horst-Wessel-Lied, a Nazi propaganda song. In 1938, Jewish children were forced to leave non-Jewish schools and could only attend those taught by Jewish teachers. Because the schools were overcapacity, Martin Kapel recalls that he and many of his classmates had troubles focusing. = Current = For over 10 years there has been a Jewish play group and kindergarten in Leipzig run by the Leipzig Jewish community. The age range is between 2 and 6, at which point they go to first grade. In addition to the toddlers, Jewish students also have a Jewish infrastructure. In 2005 the Ronald S. Lauder foundation opened the Tora Zentrum, a place where Jewish students from Leipzig and the surrounding region can come in order to meet other Jewish students and learn about Judaism. The Tora Zentrum organizes weekly classes, Shabbat meals, and social events and activities for Jewish students between ages 18 and 32. In 2013 the Tora Zentrum changed its name to Nezach ‚Äì J√ºdisches Mitteldeutschland. In year 2007, the Ariowitsch-Haus, a Jewish community center was founded. The Ariowitsch-Haus serves as a center for Jewish culture and heritage through holiday celebrations, Israel-related programming, and Jewish education for the general community.

Part of the estate in which the hall stood is now the 35 acre (14 ha) Alkincoats public park. Originally built in the north of the estate in 1575, the hall was enlarged in 1720 and demolished in 1957. History Alkincoats was once an estate owned by the de Alkincoats family which in 1570 comprised several estates held by John Parker, a descendant of the de Alkincoats, and James de Walton. It was the home of a branch of the Parker family of Browsholme, who were park keepers for the King's forest of Bowland. The hall and its estate were bought by Robert Parker (1662‚Äì1714). It passed down through Parker family from father to son via Thomas, Robert (1720‚Äì1758), Thomas (1754‚Äì1819), a Justice of the Peace (J.P.) and Deputy Lieutenant {D.L.} of Lancashire, to Thomas Parker (died 1832), an Army captain, J.P. and D.L. who also bought Browsholme Hall from his cousin. On his early death he was succeeded by his younger brother Edward (1786‚Äì1865), also a J.P. and D.L., who left it to his son Thomas Goulburne Parker (1818‚Äì1879) a barrister-at-law, J.P. and D.L. for the West Riding of Yorkshire and also J.P. for Lancashire. Thomas Goulburne had three sons, the eldest of which was Edward (1846‚Äì1894) who died childless, as a result of which ownership passed to his younger brother, Colonel John Robinson Parker (1857-1938), who later fought in the Boer War. In 1921 the 92¬Ω acre (37.5 ha) estate was sold to Colne Borough Council by Colonel Parker for the sum of ¬£24,082 and partly used as a public park. The hall was demolished in 1957 because of structural problems. The estate lodge, now a private house, is a grade II listed building. The park has held Green Flag status each year since 2009. Etymology The name Alkincoats, for which the earliest recorded form was Altenecote (1202), likely originated as a Brittonic formation. The first element may be al-, \\"bright, shining\\", or alt, \\"slope, hillside\\" (see Oldham). The second is possibly tan, \\"under, below\\" (Welsh dan). This is suffixed with the definite article -√Ø[r] and *cƒô:d, \\"wood, forest\\" (Welsh -y coed). A possible meaning of the name is \\"hillside below the wood\\". A diminutive of the aforementioned alt, *alltan, \\"little cliff\\", may underlie the first part of the name.

Cracking of the concrete causes a migration of the neutral axis which is accompanied by in-plane expansion of the slab at its boundaries. If this natural tendency to expand is restrained, the development of arching action enhances the strength of the slab. The term arching action is normally used to describe the arching phenomenon in one-way spanning slabs and compressive membrane action is normally used to describe the arching phenomenon in two-way spanning slabs.  Background  Arching action forces in beam and slab bridge deck The strength enhancing effects of arching action in reinforced concrete floors were first recognised near the beginning of last century.Westergaard, H.M. and Slater, W.A., ' Moments and stresses in slabs', Proceedings of the American Concrete Institute, 1921, Vol. 17, pp 415‚Äì538. However, it was not until the full scale destructive load tests by OcklestonOckleston, A.J., 'Load tests on a three-storey building in Johannesburg', The Structural Engineer, 1955, Vol. 33, October, pp 304‚Äì322.Ockleston, A.J., 'Arching action in reinforced concrete slabs', The Structural Engineer, 1958, Vol. 36, No.6, pp 197‚Äì201. on the Old Dental Hospital in Johannesburg that the extent of strength enhancement caused by arching action was really appreciated. In these tests, collapse loads of between 3 and 4 times those predicted by yield-line theoryJohansen, K.W., 'Brudlinieteorier', Jul. Gjellerups Forlag, Copenhagen, 1943, 191pp (Yieldline theory', translated by Cement & Concrete Association, London, 1962). were obtained. Arching action (CMA) strength enhancement in laterally restrained slab strip  Approaches to treatment of arching action (CMA)  Since the 1950s there have been several attempts to develop theories for arching action in both one and two-way slabs.Wood, R.H., 'Plastic and elastic design of slabs and plates', Thames and Hudson, London, 1961.Christiansen, K.P., 'The effect of membrane stresses on the ultimate strength of an interior panel in a reinforced concrete slab', The Structural Engineer, 1963, Vol. 41, No. 8, pp 261‚Äì265.Leibenberg, A.C., 'Arch action in concrete slabs', National Building Research Institute Bulletin, 1966, No. 40. CSIR Research Report No. 234, Pretoria, S. Africa. One of the principal approaches to membrane action was that due to ParkPark, R., 'Ultimate strength of rectangular concrete slabs under short-term uniform loading with edges restrained against lateral movement', Proceedings Instn. Civ. Engrs, Vol.28, June 1964, pp. 125‚Äì150. which has been used as a basis for many studies into arching action in slabs. Park's approach was based on rigid plastic slab strip theory, and required the assumption of a critical deflection of one half of the slab depth at failure. Park's approach was later extended by Park and GamblePark, R. and Gamble, W.L., 'Reinforced concrete slabs', Wiley Interscience, New York, 1980, pp 562‚Äì612. in their method for predicting the plastic load-deformation response of laterally restrained slabs. In 1971, the American Concrete InstituteAmerican Concrete Institute, 'Cracking, deflection and ultimate load of concrete slab systems', SP-30, Detroit, 1971, 382 pp. produced a special publication which presented the most recent research, to that time, on arching and compressive membrane action in reinforced concrete slabs. A comprehensive review of the literature and studies of both rigid-plastic and elastic-plastic approaches to arching have been compiled by BraestrupBraestrup, M.W., 'Dome effect in reinforced concrete slabs: rigid-plastic analysis‚Äô, J. Struct. Div., Proc Am. Soc. Civ. Engrs, 1980, Vol 106, No. ST6, pp 1237‚Äì1253. and Braestrup and Morley.Braestrup, M.W. and Morley, C.T., ‚ÄòDome effect in reinforced concrete slabs: elastic-plastic analysis‚Äô, J. Struct.

Engrs, Structs & Bldgs, 1992, Vol 94, Nov., pp 419‚Äì428. were some of the earliest researchers to achieve a degree of success in finite element modelling of the phenomenon. In 1993, Kuang and MorleyKuang, J. S. and Morley, C. T., ‚ÄòA plasticity model for the punching shear of laterally restrained concrete slabs with compressive membrane action‚Äô, International Journal of Science, Vol. 35, No. 5, 1993, pp 371‚Äì385. presented a plasticity approach which included the effect of compressive membrane action on the punching shear strength of laterally restrained concrete slabs.  United Kingdom approach to CMA in bridge deck design In the United Kingdom, the method developed by Kirkpatrick, Rankin & LongKirkpatrick, J., Rankin, G.I.B. and Long, A.E., 'Strength evaluation of M-beam bridge deck slabs', The Structural Engineer, Vol. 62B, No 3, Sept 1984, pp 60‚Äì68. in 1984 and substantiated by testing a full-scale bridge in 1986Kirkpatrick, J., Rankin, G.I.B. and Long, A.E., 'The influence of compressive membrane action on the serviceability of beam and slab bridge decks', The Structural Engineer, Vol. 64B, No 1, March 1986, pp 6‚Äì9 and 12. first led to the introduction of new rules for the economic design of reinforced concrete beam and slab bridge decks in Northern Ireland.Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland, 'Design of M-beam bridge decks', Amendment No. 3 to the Bridge Design Code, Northern Ireland Roads Service Headquarters, March 1986, 11.1‚Äì11.5. The concept and method were later incorporated, by the United Kingdom Highways Agency, into the UK design manual for roads and bridges, BD 81/02, 'Use of Compressive Membrane Action in Bridge Decks'.United Kingdom Highways Agency, 'Use of compressive membrane action in bridge decks', Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, Vol. 3, Section 4, Part 20, BD 81/02, 2002. Use of this CMA methodology normally results in substantial savings in reinforcement in the slab of a beam and slab bridge deck, provided certain limitations and boundary conditions are satisfied. Punching failure in beam and slab bridge deck Top surface crack pattern of punching failure zone in model bridge deck testKirkpatrick, J., 'An analytical field and model study of M-beam bridge decks', PhD Thesis, Dept of Civil Engineering, Queen's University of Belfast, 1982, 330 pp. Bottom surface crack pattern of punching failure zone in model bridge deck test Kirkpatrick, Rankin & Long's approach to the prediction of the enhanced punching strength of bridge deck slabs was based on the punching shear prediction equation derived by LongLong, A.E., 'A two-phase approach to the prediction of the punching strength of slabs', Journal of the American Concrete Institute, Proceedings, Vol.72, No.2, February 1975, pp 37‚Äì45. for the shear mode of punching failure, combined with an effective reinforcement ratio, which represented the arching action strength enhancement. The effective reinforcement ratio was determined from the maximum arching moment of resistance in a rigidly restrained concrete slab, which RankinRankin, G.I.B., 'Punching failure and compressive membrane action in reinforced concrete slabs', PhD Thesis, Dept of Civil Engineering, Queen's University of Belfast, 1982, 334 pp. had derived for laterally restrained concrete slabs from McDowell, McKee and Sevin'sMcDowell. E.L., McKee, K.E. and Sevin. E. 'Arching action theory of masonry walls', Journal of the Structural Division, Proceedings, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1956, 82, No. ST2, 915-1‚Äì915-18. arching action deformation theory for masonry walls. The derivation of the maximum arching moment of resistance of laterally restrained concrete bridge deck slabs utilised Rankin's idealised elastic- plastic stress-strain criterion for concrete, valid for concrete cylinder strengths up to at least 70N/mm2, which he had derived on the basis of Hognestad, Hanson and McHenry'sHognestad, E, Hanson, N.W. and McHenry, D., 'Concrete stress distribution in ultimate strength design', Journal of the American Concrete Institute, Proceedings, Vol.52, No.6, December 1955, pp 455‚Äì479. ultimate parabolic stress block coefficients for concrete. The adaptation of Kirkpatrick, Rankin & Long's punching strength prediction method for laterally restrained bridge deck slabs, given in BD 81/02, is summarised as follows: The concrete equivalent cylinder strength, f_{\\\\text{c}} , is given by: = \\\\frac{ 0.8f_{\\\\text{cu}} } {\\\\gamma_{\\\\text{m}} }}} The plastic strain value, \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{c}} , of an idealised elastic-plastic concrete is given by: = { \\\\left( -400+60f_{\\\\text{c}}-0.33f_{\\\\text{c}} ^2\\\\right) x 10^{-6}} }} The non-dimensional parameter, R, for the arching moment of resistance is given by: L_{\\\\text{r}} ^2 } {h^2}}} In order to treat the slab as restrained, R must be less than 0.26. If R is greater than 0.26, the deck slab shall be treated as if it were unrestrained. The non-dimensional arching moment coefficient, k, is given by: The effective reinforcement ratio, \\\\rho_{\\\\text{e}}, is given by: = k\\\\left [ \\\\frac{f_{\\\\text{c}} }{240} \\\\right ] \\\\left [ \\\\frac{h}{d} \\\\right ]^2 }} The predicted ultimate punching load for a single wheel, P_{\\\\text{ps}} (N), is given by: = { 1.52\\\\left( \\\\phi+d\\\\right)d\\\\sqrt{f_{\\\\text{c}} }\\\\left(100\\\\rho_{\\\\text{e}} \\\\right)^{0.25} } }} where: * d = average effective depth to tensile reinforcement (mm) * f_{\\\\text{cu}} = characteristic concrete cube strength (N/mm2) * h = overall slab depth (mm) * L_{\\\\text{r}} = half span of slab strip with boundary restraint (mm) * \\\\phi = diameter of loaded area (mm) * \\\\gamma_{\\\\text{m}} = partial safety factor for strength Further details on the derivation of the method and how to deal with situations of less than rigid lateral restraint are given by Rankin and Rankin & Long.Rankin, G.I.B. and Long, A.E. (1997), ‚ÄòArching action strength enhancement in laterally restrained slab strips‚Äô, Proc. Instn. Civ. Engrs Structs & Bldgs, 122, Nov., pp 461‚Äì467.

They carried out an extensive series of field tests, which led to the introduction of an empirical method of design into the Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code in 1979.Ontario Ministry of Transportation and Communication, 'The Ontario highway bridge design code', 1979, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This required minimum isotropic reinforcement (0.3%) in bridge deck slabs, provided certain boundary conditions were satisfied. In the 1990s Mufti et al.Mufti, A. A., Jaeger, L. G., Bakht, B. and Wegner, L.D., 'Experimental investigation of fibre reinforced concrete deck slabs without internal steel reinforcement,' Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 1993, Vol. 20, No.3, pp 398‚Äì406. extended this research and showed that significant enhancements in the durability of laterally restrained slabs can be achieved by utilising fibre reinforced deck slabs without steel reinforcement. Later, Mufti and NewhookMufti, A. A. and Newhook, J.P., 'Punching shear strength of restrained bridge deck slabs', ACI Structures Journal, 1998, 8(3), pp 375‚Äì381. adapted Hewitt and Batchelor's model to develop a method for evaluating the ultimate capacity of fibre reinforced deck slabs using external steel straps for the provision of lateral restraint.

It was declared Bien de Inter√©s Cultural in 1895.  History  = Early years = This is the oldest of all Pontevedra Museum‚Äôs buildings. The only sections of the original buildings that have been conserved are the main apse, formed by five apses, exceptional in Galician gothic architecture, and part of the south wall of the church and the entrance to the chapter of the Santo Domingo convent, founded in around 1282, although the work on the conserved temple did not begin until 1383, continuing through the 15th century.http://www.museo.depo.es/museo/edificios/us.01050001.html = 1836-1880 = left Following the introduction of the exclaustration law, the convent was closed on 8 December 1836 and handed over to the \\"Junta de Enajenaci√≥n de Edificios y Efectos de los Conventos Suprimidos de la Provincia de Pontevedra\\" (body entrusted with the Dissolution and Confiscation of Convents and Convent Property in the Province of Pontevedra), and then handed over as an Asylum to the Town Council, which received the building in May 1840. Despite being occupied successively by a women‚Äôs prison, a hospice until 1869, when it was transferred to Santa Clara, an infant school, as well as other activities designated by the Town Council, the building gradually deteriorated until it fell into ruin and by 1846 some of its materials were being used to pave streets. In 1864 a chapel was demolished and between 1869 and 1870 the top part of the tower, located on the south-eastern corner, was torn down. On 12 March 1874 the Town Council, presided by Ferm√≠n Brey, applied for another concession in order to completely demolish the building and extend the property to the plot at the Fair Ground. This concession was approved by the Civil Governor and President of the Provincial Commission of Monuments, but on the condition that the part corresponding to the old church and other elements of interest be conserved. = 1880-1947 = In July 1880 an agreement was reached to demolish the church completely. This decision prompted Jos√© Casal y Lois, a member of the Commission of Monuments, to intervene in October in the name of other illustrious figures from Pontevedra, before the Governor Filiberto Abelardo D√≠az, who ordered the Mayor Alejandro Abreu to halt the demolition work. This work continued, however, prompting further reactions. Another attempt was made in 1886 to demolish the ruins, but once again it failed due to pressure from numerous important figures from Pontevedra, and particularly due to the opposition of the Provincial Commission of Monuments. Saved from demolition, the site was declared a National Monument by the Law of 14 August 1895, which stipulated that the Commission of Monuments would take over control of the building and that the Ministry of Development would implement \\"the appropriate provisions to ensure its conservation, decoration and custody\\", exactly one year after the foundation of the Pontevedra Archaeological Society, presided by Casto Sampedro y Folgar, on 15 August 1894. This Society selected the building for the future headquarters of the planned Museum at a meeting held the day before at the president‚Äôs office. The choice was made from three buildings forming the cloister of San Francisco and the ground floor of the Colegio de la Compa√±√≠a, today the \\"Sarmiento\\" building. In 1903, when work had begun on the Institute occupying part of the Ruins, the Archaeological Society requested premises on the ground floor of the Institute to house the collections that would be exhibited in the second section of the Museum, located on a premises belonging to the Provincial Government. The Society was awarded a concession to use these premises in 1905, although it only received one room once construction had been completed and this was exchanged for a small patio in 1945, where the decorative arches of the chapter room of the old convent were built, donated by the heirs of Augusto Gonz√°lez Besada, and for part of the basement then used to exhibit the epigraphy collection.

He served as an educator in Jesuit boarding schools for a while after his ordination though later left Poland to work alongside lepers in Madagascar where he remained until his death. The beatification cause started in 1985 and in 1992 he was titled as Venerable upon the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue. Pope John Paul II beatified him while in Poland on 18 August 2002. Biography Jan Beyzym was born in Stari Beizymy, Russian Empire (now Ukraine) on 15 May 1850 as the eldest of five children to Jan Beyzym and Olga. His father served as a freedom fighter and in 1863 was sentenced to death in absentia for his activities. He moved alongside his mother and siblings to Kiev and studied there from 1864 until 1871. He completed his education in Kiev before deciding to pursue the religious life; he had thought of being a diocesan priest but his late father had moved him to learn about the Jesuits and pursue a path with them - he decided to join them after a long internal struggle. Beyzym joined the Jesuits for his novitiate period on 10 December 1872 at Stara Wies and this concluded in 1874. During his novitiate there was a cholera epidemic and he received the permission of his superior to go out into the streets to tend to the ailing victims. Beyzym received his ordination as a priest on 26 July 1881 in Krak√≥w from Bishop Albin Dunajewski. He served as a teacher after his ordination until 1898 at Jesuit boarding schools in both Tarnopol and Chyr√≥w where he taught the French and Russian languages. His students knew him for his sense of humor. In 1898 he left his native land to join the Jesuit missions to lepers near Tananariwa in Madagascar with the permission of his superiors. Father Beyzym left Poland on 17 October 1898 and arrived on the following 30 December at Red Island before being posted to Ambahivoraka near Antananarivo. He fainted several times while tending to the lepers due to the horrible smells. In October 1902 he began to see the construction of a leper hospital at Marana and it was finished and inaugurated on 16 August 1911. He became a noted figure for his activism and collaboration with the lepers and became known for his intense devotion to both the Eucharist and the Mother of God while being known also as a lover of all nature. Beyzym died on 2 October 1912; his health had declined and he suffered both arteriosclerosis and sores which confined him to bed. His remains were exhumed and relocated back to his native Poland on 8 December 1993 at a Jesuit church. Beatification The Polish priest around 1904 while in Madagascar. The beatification process opened in Krak√≥w from 1984 until 1986 while a second diocesan process opened and closed in Fianarantsoa in 1987; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validated the processes on 27 October 1989. The official start to the process came on 27 September 1985 after the C.C.S. issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled her as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. later received the Positio in 1990. Theologians approved this on 28 April 1992 as did the C.C.S. on 3 November 1992; Pope John Paul II confirmed his life of heroic virtue and titled the late priest as Venerable on 21 December 1992. John Paul II decreed that a healing credited to the late priest was a miracle on 5 July 2002 and beatified Beyzym two months later on 18 August 2002 while on an apostolic visit to Poland. The current postulator for this cause is the Jesuit priest Anton Witwer.

He has worked as assistant director with notable directors such as Dariush Mehrjui, Fereydoun Jeyrani, and Alireza Davood Nejad. He is one of the most prominent and distinguished directors of the new generation of the Iranian cinema, whose films have been received well by the people, critics, and international festivals because of their social themes and modern structure, but have faced protest from the government and domestic extremist groups. He started writing as a film critic in 1997 for several newspapers. He later worked as an executive editor for cinema books and magazines. He was an assistant to some prestigious Iranian filmmakers, including Dariush Mehrjui and Alireza Davood Nejad. He has also worked as a screenwriter. He started making short films and documentaries in 2002. Hatred was his first feature film, produced independently in Istanbul. Hatred displays the frenzied love and hatred and two accounts from two phases in the life of an Iranian refugee couple in Istanbul, Turkey. The film was received well by critics and cinema writers and the Iranian critics gave it three awards (Best Directing, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing). Although Hatred was censored to be screened in Iran, it was screened and praised in various festivals such as the Competition Section of the 36th Montreal Film Festival in Canada, Competition Section of the 28th Warsaw Film Festival in Poland, and Competition Section of the Camerimage Film Festival in Poland. His second feature, I‚Äôm not angry!, was the most controversial film of the Iranian cinema in 2014.

Its eastern border lies 40‚Äì60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean, while its western side flanks the North Eastern Province in Kenya, which was carved out of Jubaland during the colonial period. Jubaland has a total area of 110,293 km2 (42,584 sq mi). As of 2005, it had a total population of 953,045 inhabitants. The territory consists of the Gedo, Lower Juba and Middle Juba provinces. Its largest city is Kismayo, which is situated on the coast near the mouth of the Jubba River. Bardera, Afmadow, Bu'aale, Luuq, Garbahareey and Beled Haawo are the region's other principal cities. During the Middle Ages, the influential Somali Ajuran Sultanate held sway over the territory, followed in turn by the Geledi Sultanate, and upon the dawn of colonialism, the Boqow dynasty. They were later incorporated into British East Africa. In 1925, Jubaland was ceded to Italy, forming a part of Italian Somaliland. On 1 July 1960, the region, along with the rest of Italian Somaliland and British Somaliland, became part of the independent Somali Republic. Jubaland was later the site of numerous battles during the civil war. In late 2006, Islamist militants gained control of most of the region. To reclaim possession of the territory, a new autonomous administration dubbed Azania was announced in 2010 and formalized the following year. In 2013, the Juba Interim Administration was officially established and recognized. It's now one of the five autonomous administrations in Somalia. History During the Middle Ages, the influential Somali Ajuran Empire held sway over the territory, followed in turn by the Geledi Sultanate during the early modern period.Luling (2002), p.272. From 1836 until 1861, parts of Jubaland were nominally claimed by the Sultanate of Muscat (now in Oman). =Colonial period= Trans-Juba postage stamps of 1926. The Geledi Sultanate that controlled this entire region later joined the Italian Somaliland protectorate after the Geledi ruler called Osman Ahmed signed multiple treaties with the colonial Italians. Jubaland was subsequently ceded to Italy in 1924‚Äì25, as a reward for the Italians having joined the Allies in World War I, and Hornsby, Kenya: A History Since Independence, 2012, 21. and had a brief existence as the Italian colony of Trans-Juba (Oltre Giuba) under governor (16 July 1924 ‚Äì 31 December 1926) Corrado Zoli (1877‚Äì1951). Italy issued its first postage stamps for the territory on 29 July 1925, consisting of contemporary Italian stamps overprinted Oltre Giuba (Trans-Juba). Britain retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District (NFD). Jubaland was then incorporated into neighboring Italian Somaliland on 30 June 1926. The colony had a total area of 87,000 km2 (33,000 sq mi), and in 1926, a population of 120,000 inhabitants. =1974 resettlement= During the post-independence period, one particularly significant historical event was the series of internal migrations into the Jubba regions by Somalis from other parts of the country. Between 1974 and 1975, a major drought referred to as the Abaartii Dabadheer (\\"The Lingering Drought\\") occurred in the northern regions of Somalia. The Soviet Union, which at the time maintained strategic relations with the Siad Barre government, airlifted some 90,000 people from the devastated regions of Hobyo and Caynaba. New small settlements referred to as Danwadaagaha (\\"Collective Settlements\\") were then created in the Jubbada Hoose (Lower Jubba) and Jubbada Dhexe (Middle Jubba) regions. The transplanted families were also introduced to farming and fishing techniques, a change from their traditional pastoralist lifestyle of livestock herding. =Somali Civil War= By the late 1980s, the moral authority of Barre's government had collapsed. Many Somalis had become disillusioned with life under military dictatorship. The government became increasingly totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia, sprang up across the country, eventually leading to the Somali Civil War and Barre's ouster. Following the ensuing breakdown of central authority, General Mohammed Said Hersi \\"Morgan\\", Barre's son-in-law and former Minister of Defense, briefly declared Jubaland independent on 3 September 1998.Footnotes to History: G to J Footnotes to History Political opponents of General Morgan subsequently united as the Allied Somali Forces (ASF), seizing control of Kismayo by June of the following year.Somalia Assessment, September 1999 Country Information and Policy Unit, Immigration & Nationality Directorate, Home Office, UK Led by Colonel Barre Adan Shire Hiiraale, the ASF administration renamed itself the Juba Valley Alliance in 2001. ‚Äì also shows Italian colonial flag & links to map On 18 June of that year, an 11-member inter-clan council decided to ally the JVA with the newly-forming Transitional Federal Government.Report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Somalia, 11 Oct 2001, Document S/2001/963 United Nations Security Council. In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), an Islamist organization, assumed control of much of Jubaland and other parts of southern Somalia and promptly imposed Shari'a law. The Transitional Federal Government sought to re- establish its authority, and, with the assistance of Ethiopian troops, African Union peacekeepers and air support by the United States, managed to drive out the rival ICU and solidify its rule. The Battle of Ras Kamboni was taking place on 8 January 2007. Afterwards, the TFG then relocated to Villa Somalia in the capital from its interim location in Baidoa. This marked the first time since the fall of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.Somalia President, Parliament Speaker dispute over TFG term. garoweonline.com (12 January 2011). Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops. =Revival of the Jubaland administration= On 3 April 2011, it was announced that the new autonomous Jubaland administration would be referred to as Azania, and would be led by Mohamed Abdi Mohamed (Gandhi), the former national Minister of Defense, as president.Muhumed, Malkhadir M., Associated Press (3 April 2011) Somalia creates new state, Azania, latest of at least 10 new administrations recently added. startribune.comMcGregor, Sarah and Omar, Hamsa (4 April 2011) Former Somali Defense Minister Named President of Jubaland.

Endorsed by the federal State Minister for the Presidency Farah Abdulkadir on behalf of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the pact was brokered by the Foreign Ministry of Ethiopia and came after protracted bilateral talks. Under the terms of the agreement, Jubaland will be administered for a two-year period by a Juba Interim Administration and led by the region's incumbent president, Ahmed Mohamed Islam. The regional president will serve as the chairperson of a new Executive Council, to which he will appoint three deputies. Management of Kismayo's seaport and airport will also be transferred to the Federal Government after a period of six months, and revenues and resources generated from these infrastructures will be earmarked for Jubaland's service delivery and security sectors as well as local institutional development. Additionally, the agreement includes the integration of Jubaland's military forces under the central command of the Somali National Army (SNA), and stipulates that the Juba Interim Administration will command the regional police. UN Special Envoy to Somalia Nicholas Kay hailed the pact as \\"a breakthrough that unlocks the door for a better future for Somalia,\\" with AUC, UN, EU and IGAD representatives also present at the signing. On 16 September 2014, President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud officially opened a reconciliation conference in Kismayo. The summit was aimed at Jubaland's Lower Juba, Middle Juba and Gedo constituencies, and was attended by delegates from across the nation and abroad. On 30 December 2014, Jubaland President Ahmed Mohamed Islam (Madobe) and South West State President Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan signed a 4-point Memorandum of Understanding on federalization, security, the 2016 general elections, trade, and the constitution. The bilateral accord was signed in the presence of representatives from the two regional states, including politicians, traditional leaders and civil society activists. Among the clauses of the accord were equitable allocation of international assistance by the federal authorities, agreeing on pre-civil war boundaries and regional demarcations established by the military government, and recommending that the federal authorities both delegate powers to regional bodies and adopt a No Objection Policy. Additionally, the memorandum stipulates that the two regional states will form a security committee consisting of representatives from both administrations, which will facilitate launching joint counterinsurgency operations, extradition, and expertise and intelligence sharing. The two administrations also proposed the creation of an interstate commission to liaise between the federal government and constituent regional states. They likewise indicated that their respective Chambers of Commerce would buttress commercial exchanges and cross-border trade. In February 2015, the Interim Juba Administration began a selection process for the members of the new regional parliament. Following consultations with local stakeholders, the lawmakers were slated to be nominated by intellectuals in conjunction with traditional elders. The legislative selection process was drawn from all of the regional state's constituent districts. On 15 April 2015, a new 75-seat chamber of Jubaland parliament was inaugurated at an official ceremony at the presidential palace in Kismayo. Federal lawmaker Sheikh Abdi Yusuf was therein elected as interim speaker, and 75 MPs were sworn into the new regional legislature. On 7 May 2015, an inauguration ceremony was held in Kismayo for the Jubaland administration's first regional parliament.

Haran is also the co-host of the Hello Internet podcast along with fellow educational YouTuber CGP Grey. On 22 August 2017, Haran launched his second podcast, called The Unmade Podcast, and on 11 November 2018, he launched his third podcast, The Numberphile Podcast, based on his mathematics- centered channel of the same name. Reporter and filmmaker Brady Haran studied journalism for a year before being hired by The Adelaide Advertiser. In 2002, he moved from Australia to Nottingham, United Kingdom. In Nottingham, he worked for the BBC, began to work with film, and reported for East Midlands Today, BBC News Online and BBC radio stations. In 2007, Haran worked as a filmmaker-in-residence for Nottingham Science City, as part of an agreement between the BBC and The University of Nottingham. His \\"Test Tube\\" project started with the idea of producing a documentary about scientists and their research, but he decided to upload his raw footage to YouTube; from that point \\"Periodic Videos\\" and \\"Sixty Symbols\\" were developed. Haran then left the BBC to work full-time making YouTube videos. YouTube channels Following Test Tube, Haran decided to create new YouTube channels. In his first five years as an independent filmmaker he made over 1500 videos and in 2012, he was the producer, editor, and interviewer behind 12 YouTube channels. Haran frequently collaborates with well-known academics and professionals. Haran's videos are often in the format of a casual interview in which Haran and an expert discuss subjects relevant to their work. =The Periodic Table of Videos= Started in June 2008, Periodic Videos is a series of videos about chemical elements and the periodic table. Working with Professor Martyn Poliakoff, Haran's videos explaining chemistry and science for non-technical persons have received positive recognition. Together, they have made over 500 short videos that cover the elements and other chemistry-related topics. Their YouTube channel has had more than 159 million views. Also, Haran and Poliakoff authored an article in the Nature Chemistry journal and an essay on Science journal discussing the impact of The Periodic Table of Videos. Martyn Poliakoff received the Royal Society of Chemistry Nyholm Prize for Education in 2011 for work taking chemistry education to a wider audience; this included his work with Haran on The Periodic Table of Videos. =Sixty Symbols= Sixty Symbols is Haran's YouTube channel for physics and astronomy. The first video was released in April 2009, with the original run of videos focusing on commonly used physics notations. Since then, videos on topics such as the greenhouse effect, the age of the universe, and several on black holes have been released. =Numberphile= Started in October 2011, Numberphile features videos that explore educational topics from a variety of fields of mathematics. It is currently Haran's most subscribed channel. In the early days of the channel, each video focused on a specific number, but the channel has since expanded its scope, featuring videos on more advanced mathematical concepts such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the Riemann hypothesis. Haran maintains the Numberphile2 channel as well, which features extra footage from the main channel, as well as The Numberphile Podcast. =Objectivity= Haran launched the YouTube channel Objectivity in late 2014. The videos feature the discussion and handling of historic objects and manuscripts, often from the archives of the Royal Society, though other historic museums and organizations have also been featured. Haran is the on-camera presenter for the channel, in contrast to his other channels where he is a behind-the-camera presence. Keith Moore, the Head Librarian of the Royal Society, is prominently featured. =Deep Sky Videos= Deep Sky Videos, started in October 2011, is Haran's astronomy-focused channel. It is similarly formatted and has some of the same contributors as Numberphile and Sixty Symbols. A project of the channel is to produce a video for each of the 110 Messier objects, with 89 of them having been covered by January 2020. =Other YouTube channels= Computerphile is the sister channel to Numberphile, featuring videos about computer science. Haran is minimally involved in the channels video creation, with most being directed and produced by Sean Riley. Haran continues to maintain the Test Tube channel, now titled nottinghamscience, as a place to post extra footage and outtakes from Periodic Videos and Sixty Symbols. He also runs channels for his podcasts Hello Internet and The Unmade Podcast. Haran has several channels that have been inactive for several years, which are Word of the World, Backstage Science, Psyfile, PhilosophyFile, Bibledex, FavScientist, and foodskey. Brady Stuff is Haran's channel for personal videos and is a self- described \\"dumping ground for clips that don't quite fit anywhere\\". Podcasts =Hello Internet= 200px postal referendum as the official flag of the Hello Internet podcast. In January 2014, Haran launched the podcast Hello Internet along with co-host CGP Grey, another YouTube educational content creator. The podcast peaked as the #1 iTunes podcast in the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, Canada, and Australia. It was selected as one of Apple's best new podcasts of 2014. The Guardian included the podcast among its 50 best of 2016, naming episode 66 (\\"A Classic Episode\\") its episode of the year. The paper described the podcast as having \\"in-depth debates and banter that is actually amusing\\". The podcast features discussions pertaining to their lives as professional content creators for YouTube, as well as their interests and annoyances. Typical topics include technology etiquette; movie and TV show reviews; plane accidents; vexillology; futurology; and the differences between Grey's and Haran's personalities and lifestyles. Grey's and Haran's opinions and comments on feedback usually starts the next episode of the podcast. As a result of their conversations, Haran has been noted for reappropriating the term \\",\\" among other words, to refer to the unauthorised rehosting of online media. The podcast has an \\"official\\" flag called the Nail & Gear which was chosen from five candidates with a postal vote by the podcast's audience using an alternative vote system. =The Unmade Podcast= In August 2017, Haran launched The Unmade Podcast along with co-host Tim Hein, a close friend of Haran. The podcast features a discussion between the two about \\"ideas for podcasts that they will never make\\". Most episodes last for approximately 40‚Äì75 minutes and each host is given the opportunity to pitch two podcast ideas in total. Hein and Brady then proceed to discuss these ideas in a light-hearted and often comedic manner. Along with the regular episodes, the podcast also has occasional 'special episodes'. These are usually, but not always, an opportunity for the hosts to attempt to actually create a podcast from an idea previously put forward on the show. A notable exception to this was the Antarctica special episode which departed from the usual format for Haran to discuss his recent visit to Antarctica with Hein. As of December 2018, there have been six special episodes including the Antarctica special. =The Numberphile Podcast= In November 2018, Haran launched The Numberphile Podcast, in which he speaks with various mathematicians in a longer-form version than the YouTube channel. Unlike with his others, Haran is the sole host of this podcast.

Basing her story on authentic characters, some from her own Serbian family, she tells the story of how in the mountains of Croatia, Milovan receives a letter informing him that his wife has died. This leads to a review of his past life. Twenty years earlier, he had given up his post as party secretary, deceived his wife with his best friend's pregnant wife and refused to use his influence to prevent the imprisonment of his own son. Now, in the early 1990s, he is surrounded by Croatian nationalists who are trying to rid themselves of Serbs like Milovan himself. The novel develops into a tale of guilt and shame, bringing us face to face with what lies behind the facade of the toughest men of the times. The reader is led to wonder why Milovan has become so cynical and why he deserted his wife. It also encourages reflection on the wider implications of the Yugoslavian clashes.Erik Skyum-Nielsen, \\"A novel need not be cheerful or violent or have a gripping plot to be described as good\\", Danish Literary Magazine.

It also seeks to increase public awareness and fashionability of the drink in the world.  Judging Process  Every sake is assessed independently, not comparatively. Sake sommeliers and jury members evaluate each sake by scoring appearance, flavour and taste in the first round of blind tasting. Labelling and packaging are assessed separately in the second round. Sake sommeliers score sakes from 0 to 5 stars.  Reward  The competition awards gold, silver and bronze medals to the highest scoring sakes in accordance with the judging criteria. Award winners receive correspondent medal stickers.

It is accessible only via boat and offers opportunities for picnicking and fishing as well as general exploration in a largely deserted setting. The island is the state's smallest state park. History In the 19th century, the island was owned by a popular music teacher, the founder of Salem's Music Vale Seminary, Oramel Whittlesey (1801-1876). Whittlesey named the island for a niece nicknamed Minnie. In the 1920s, an attempt by squatters to take possession led to the discovery that although the island was claimed by both Salem and Montville, it was not on the tax rolls of either town. In solving the dilemma, the state assembly rejected the squatters' proposed legislation, instead passing a law in 1925 that took possession of the island for the state and turned its management over to the state park's commission. Features Writers working for the WPA in the 1930s described Minnie Island as \\"a pine-grown knoll rising from the lake's depths.\\" It has a steep shoreline with gray outcropped ledges that offers few opportunities for docking. It rises approximately sixteen feet from the surface of Gardner Lake which lies at an elevation of . Its northern shore drops off into the deepest portion of Gardner Lake, some . The island is thickly forested with mountain laurel undergrowth amidst large red oaks. A clearing at the summit may be littered with the detritus of previous visitors.

The SAGD process which developed in the late 80s included drilling wells in pairs with the producer at the base of the reservoir and the steam injector from the above.

Bg5 Strategically, the bishop on g5 exerts an annoying influence where it pins Black's e-pawn and is ready to meet 2...Nf6 with 3.Bxf6, giving up the bishop pair in exchange for saddling Black with doubled pawns. White's aim is to provoke weaknesses in the kingside position while it engages the bishop. Modern Chess Openings considers the line a variation of the Trompowsky Attack, although that term is usually reserved for the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5. The Encyclopedia of Chess Openings covers 2.Bg5 in chapter D00. Development Although the opening was tested by Preston Ware in the 1880s, the namesake of the opening is the English grandmaster Julian Hodgson who studied and played the opening extensively, finding several new ideas and gaining an understanding of the arising positions that yielded him successful results with the line. The Hodgson Attack was a very rare line until the 1980s, when several players including Michael Adams and Tony Miles tried the opening, but the opening remains a sideline compared to the Queen's Gambit (2.c4). Black responses Black has several options, for instance falling in with White's idea after 2...Nf6 3.Bxf6 transposes into a variation of the Trompowsky Attack that is playable. Moves like 2...c5, 2...g6, 2...c6 and even chasing the bishop with 2...f6 are also possible. An unusual response is 2...Bg4 (the Welling Variation). A solid line is to chase the bishop with 2...h6 3.Bh4 c6, where Black will play 4...Qb6 on the next move, attacking the b2-pawn and thus taking advantage of a drawback in White's system, namely its absence from defending the queenside.

The E-COM service allowed customers to transmit messages of up to two pages from their own computers, via telecommunication lines, to one or more of 25 serving post offices (SPOs) located in the following cities: Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Richmond, St. Louis, San Antonio, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. After an electronic message was received as a SPO, it was processed and sorted by ZIP Code, then printed on letter-size bond paper, folded, and sealed in an envelope printed with a blue E-COM logo. In order to be eligible for the service, customers were required to send a minimum of 200 messages per transmission. History E-COM was originally proposed on September 8, 1978, and service was expected to begin by December of that year. The proposal was caught up in a two-year regulatory dispute, and a modified version of the E-COM service as recommended by the Postal Rate Commission was approved on August 15, 1980 by the Postal Service Board of Governors.\\"E-COM service commences January 4, 1982\\". Memo to Mailers. Vol 16 No 12. January 1982. E-COM services began on January 4, 1982, and the original rates were 26 cents for the first page plus 2 cents for the second page for each transmission. In addition, there was an annual fee of $50 for the service. During its inaugural year of service, 3.2 million E-COM messages were sent, and more than 600 customers submitted applications for the service. Federal law prohibits the USPS from subsidizing a mail class by overcharging the users of other mail classes; however, E-COM was heavily subsidized from its introduction. During its first year of operation, the USPS lost $5.25 per letter. The House Government Operations Committee indicated that \\"The Postal Service deliberately manipulates the release of information about E-COM in order to make E-COM appear to be more successful than it really is.\\" \\"Postal Service Electronic Mail: The Price Isn't Right\\". Washington: House Government Operations Committee. October 1, 1982. p3http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa047.html Subsequent to this, there were difficulties in securing approval for a competitive and profitable rate for the service, and beginning in June 1984 the Postal Service started trying to sell the E-COM service to a private firm. Having not received offers that were financially attractive enough to be accepted, Postmaster General Paul Carlin notified the board of governors at the June 3, 1985 meeting that the postal service would request through the Postal Rate Commission the authority to close down the operation as soon as possible.

A midshipman in 1656, he was in 1659 commander of a unit of marines during Michiel de Ruyter's liberation of Funen in the Dano-Swedish War (1658‚Äì1660). He continued from 1661 as a lieutenant in the marines and participated in almost every battle that the Dutch fleet fought in those years. He was present at the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665 and in actions of Lieutenant-Admiral Willem Joseph van Ghent in West Africa against the Barbary pirates in 1670. In 1669 Schey became extraordinary captain in the Admiralty of Amsterdam. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Gilles was captain of the Tijdverdrijf. In 1674 he joined the squadron of Cornelis Tromp in action against France. In 1675 he was made a full captain. He was captain of the Essen at the Battle of Stromboli, and of the Spieghel at the Battle of Agosta and the Battle of Palermo. In 1678 he fought under Cornelis Evertsen the Younger. On 6 December 1683 he became Rear-Admiral under William Bastiaensz Schepers during actions in the Baltic Sea. In 1688 he commanded the Wapen van Utrecht in the fleet with which William III of Orange invaded the British Isles. In 1690, he commanded the flagship the Princess Mary in the Battle of Beachy Head. On 1 April 1692 he became vice admiral and fought that year in the Battle of La Hougue. In the following years he performed many actions against the Dunkirk Raiders. He died in Amsterdam.

Background  Little is known about Yu Ningji's family background, other than that he was a younger second-cousin of the more well-known Former Shu official Yu Chuansu, who served as a chancellor during the reigns of both of Former Shu's emperors, Wang Jian and Wang Zongyan.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 41.  During Wang Jian's reign  At one point during Wang Jian's reign, Yu Ningji became an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). By 917, he was serving as the chief imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´ÊâøÊó®). In the fall that year, the powerful eunuch Tang Wenyi (ÂîêÊñáÊâÜ) accused then-director of palace communications Mao Wenxi of overreaching, Wang Jian exiled Mao and replaced him with Yu on an acting basis. Later in the year, Wang Jian officially made Yu director of palace communications, and also made him the minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu). When Wang Jian became deathly ill in summer 918, Wang Jian, after exiling Tang after accusations by his adoptive son Wang Zongbi, whom he was intending to entrust his son and crown prince Wang Yan to, that Tang was intending to seize power, put Yu in charge of matters of finance, civil service, and justice, while putting the eunuch Song Guangsi in charge of military dispatches. Shortly before his death, he further made Song director of palace communications ‚Äî while the historical records were silent as to whether, simultaneously, Yu remained as director of palace communications as well, or whether Yu was relieved of that post and only serving as minister of civil service affairs. After Wang Jian's subsequent death, Wang Yan took the throne as emperor. Wang Jian's last edict, naming the officials whom he entrusted the new, young emperor to, did not name Yu among the officials. (The ones named were Song and Wang Zongbi, as well as Wang Jian's other adoptive sons Wang Zongyao (ÁéãÂÆóÁë§), Wang Zongwan (ÁéãÂÆóÁ∂∞), and Wang Zongkui (ÁéãÂÆóÂ§î).)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270.  During Wang Yan's reign  However, whether Yu Ningji remained as director of palace communications or not, he remained in charge of matters of justice, for it was apparently he who oversaw the subsequent demotion and punishment of the chancellor Zhang Ge, a major political ally of Tang Wenyi's, after Tang was executed shortly after Wang Yan took the throne. It was Yu who proposed to exile Zhang to Heshui Base (ÂêàÊ∞¥ÈéÆ, in modern Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan). He further ordered Gu Chengyan (È°ßÊâøÈÉæ), the prefect of Mao Prefecture (ËåÇÂ∑û), which Heshui belonged to, to spy on Zhang, hoping further chances to accuse Zhang. After Gu declined to do so (after being warned by the wife of the general Wang Zongkan (ÁéãÂÆó‰æÉ), who was also an adoptive son of Wang Jian's, that doing so exposed Gu himself to reprisals later as well), Yu found an excuse to punish Gu. That was the last historical reference to Yu, and it was not known when he died.

Fort Massachusetts was the westernmost in a line of forts built by British colonists to protect the northern border of Massachusetts from French and Indian forces in 1745. It was constructed along the banks of the Hoosac River in what is currently North Adams, Massachusetts by a company of British soldiers led by Captain Ephraim Williams. It consisted of a wooden stockade with a guard tower at each corner and a central blockhouse which was designed to be defensible if the walls were breached. King George's War In 1746, the fort was the site of the Siege of Fort Massachusetts, a battle in King George's War between the twenty-one garrisoned British troops and almost a thousand allied French and Indian soldiers that resulted in the burning of the fort and the capturing of the British forces and their families. The twenty- nine captives were taken to Quebec to be later exchanged as prisoners of war; only fourteen, ten men and four children, lived to be traded back to the British a year later. The Reverend John Norton was among those who returned alive and he published a captivity narrative of the events titled \\"The Redeemed Captive.\\" According to Norton, Captain Williams was away on business and around half the soldiers were ill at the time of the attack. Surrounded by so many forces, it was deemed impossible for a messenger to get through and ride to the fort at Deerfield for reinforcements. The British held the fort for 36 hours before surrendering to the French captain due to lack of shot and gunpowder. Their terms of surrender were that they should be prisoners of the French only, that children be allowed to remain with their families and that they be exchanged at the first possible opportunity. The first term was not heeded, but in Norton's account they weren't treated with cruelty and Indian troops carried those who were too sick or wounded to walk. Later Colonial History The Fort was rebuilt under the command of Captain Williams ten months later in June 1747. The watchtowers were fortified with larger guns, but no full-scale attacks occurred for the rest of the fort's history. Troops were reduced after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 temporarily brought an end to the threat of a French invasion from Canada. During this period, many of the soldiers who had been garrisoned at the fort turned to farming instead. Under the charter for the nearby new township of West Hoosac (now known at Williamstown, Massachusetts), soldiers and officers had the option to take a 190-acre package of land in lieu of back-pay. They eventually became influential and respected founding members of Williamstown. Fort Massachusetts was re-fortified at the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754, where it served as an important staging point for troops passing through the area. After the war, the fort was abandoned and fell into disrepair. Reconstruction and demolition In 1895, the North Adams Women's Club began raising funds to reconstruct the fort as a memorial site. The new fort was dedicated in 1933 and operated as a historical tourist site into the 1960s. It was eventually sold and torn down due to lack of funds and vandalism. The reconstructed chimney and a rock with a commemorative plaque remain on the site, in what is now the parking lot of the North Adams Price Chopper.  References  *Burns, Deborah and Lauren R.

Farah served as United Press International bureau chief in El Salvador from 1985 to 1987, and a freelance journalist for The Washington Post, Newsweek, and other publications until being hired as a staff correspondent for The Washington Post in 1992. While working for the Post, Farah served as bureau chief of Central American and the Caribbean until 1997, international investigative reporter between 1998 and 2000, and of West Africa between 2000 and 2003. He left the Post in 2004, and has since authored two books and served as a contributor to peer reviewed publications such as the Journal of International Affairs and analysis pieces for Foreign Policy and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Early career Farah was born on July 22, 1957 and spent his childhood traveling the world with his missionary parents. He graduated from high school in 1974 from the American Cooperative School in La Paz. After traveling around Latin America and working odd jobs, Farah began attending the University of Kansas in 1980. He graduated in 1985 with a B.A. in Latin American Studies and a B.S. in Journalism. During this time he worked for United Press International, and upon graduation he was named UPI bureau chief in El Salvador, a position he held until 1987. In El Salvador his reporting covered the civil war and human rights atrocities, including coverage of right wing death squad activities and the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests. Other reporting included the use of political amnesty to free the Salvadorian murderers of US nationals, the political gamesmanship of Salvadorian president Jose Duarte, the extortion of the country's high ranking civil servants, natural disasters in the region, such as earthquakes, and the expulsion of foreign nationals from the country.  The Washington Post In 1988 Farah was the recipient of the Sigma Delta Chi Distinguished Service Award for Foreign Correspondence, for a series of articles he wrote on death squads in El Salvador for The Washington Post. He also moved to Colombia on contract with the Post to report on the drug wars in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia‚Äîspecifically the period of influence for Pablo Escobar. In 1992, after serving as a freelance reporter for several newspapers, Farah became a foreign affairs correspondent for The Washington Post. Soon afterwards he became the bureau chief for Central American and the Caribbean until 1997. In 2000 he was again named bureau chief, this time as chief of West Africa, a position he held until 2003. He reported on many different international affairs issues and civil war conflicts, including the economic reforms in Cuba, the inflation of extreme corruption among public officials as well as the civil war in Sierre Leone, the military dictatorship in Haiti, the Aristide and Preval era in Haiti, dictator Charles Taylor and his ties in the blood diamond trade to al Qaeda terrorists, American sanctions against Libya, US military involvement in Colombia, and Russian organized crime. Farah left the Post in 2004. Books and recent publications Farah is an occasional contributor to Foreign Policy, covering issues including Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. He was also a contributor to the Counterterrorism Blog between 2005 and 2011. Farah published articles in Prism and at the end of 2012 Farah published the article Central American Gangs: Changing Nature and New Partners in the Winter 2012 issue of the Journal of International Affairs. In terms of longer works, upon leaving the Post in 2004 Farah published the book Blood from Stones: The Secret Financial Network of Terror, based upon the stories he broke regarding the ties between al-Qaeda and West African blood diamonds. The book also covered the story of how Farah had to leave the region due to death-threats and was welcomed back to America by a CIA embarrassed by the fact they knew nothing of his discovery. The book explains how the revelation of international affairs material unknown to the governments of the countries involved led to him being attacked by numerous intelligence services. Farah also co-authored the book Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible with Stephen Braun. The book tells the story of the international weapons dealer Viktor Bout, and was released a year before Bout was arrested in a DEA sting. The book detailed how Bout was able to deliver weapons to the deviant groups and nations, including militants in the Taliban, Somalia, and Yemen. Publishers Weekly wrote that, \\"The authors paint a depressing picture of an avalanche of war-making material pouring into poor, violence-wracked nations despite well-publicized U.N. embargoes.\\" Consultation business Farah has been interviewed regarding international relations and criminal issues for decades. Following 9-11, he was interviewed by international newspapers regarding the link between African diamonds and terrorist financing. Farah is the principal and owner of IBI Consultants, LLC, which describes itself as \\"offer[ing] a broad range of expertise and access across Latin America on issues of national security, transnational crime, terrorism, terror finance and non-state armed actors\\". He has been featured on national broadcast stations as an expert in the field of national security issues, including on CNN. Farah is an expert for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the fields of organized crime, drugs, Latin America, and Central America. As of 2013, Farah was a Senior Fellow of Financial Investigations and Transparency at the International Assessment of Strategy Center. He is also an adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Farah has testified before the US Congress on more than a dozen occasions. For example, on October 1, 2009, Farah testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs on the subject of \\"Transnational Drug Enterprises: Threats to Global Stability and U.S. National Security from Southwest Asia, Latin American and West Africa\\". On July 7, 2011, Farah testified before the House Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence on the subject of \\"Hezbollah in Latin America: Implications for U.S. Security\\". Media appearances Farah appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on September 13, 2007. He has been interviewed on Univision and CNN. Farah was also interviewed by Terry Gross on her NPR radio show Fresh Air in 2004 and 2007, as well as on other NPR radio programs and radio programs on additional networks.

It was assembled over the course of her career by the weaver, textile artist and author Mary Ann Beinecke. The collection contains items spanning the period from 1550 to the 1970s and holds particular strengths in costume history, handicrafts and textile design. Collection interests include numerous examples of French manufacturers‚Äô sample books of fabrics, lace, ribbons and trims; treatises on textile production; dye manufacturers‚Äô formula books; bound sets of fashion plates; sketchbooks of kimono patterns; and textile sample books offering examples of traditional Japanese design. Of exceptional note is a rare collection of 16th-, 17th-, and 18th-century weavers' pattern books, including several early editions of Nathanael Lumscher's Weber Kunst- und Bild-Buch. Beautifully illustrated interior decoration books offer glimpses into the trends of the late nineteenth century and many volumes provide rich reference material on the history of subjects encompassing ink, wallpaper, handmade lace, carpet and rug making, and textile production. Crochet, knitting and needlework pattern books provide instruction and inspiration for hand work projects, while informing on the aesthetics of their time. A particular star of the collection is the Sample Book of Trims with its many samples of elaborately beaded appliques, metallic yarn embroidery and elegantly woven ribbon trimmings. Collection Creation In the early 1960s, Mary Ann founded Nantucket Looms and then the Nantucket School of Needlery, the only licensed needle arts school in the US. The mission of the School was to train local young women in the needle arts, creating a form of employment which offered to them careers on the island as instructors in the resident School and teachers for the School's Nantucket School of Needlery Home Study Course, which Mary Ann wrote and illustrated in review with them. Support from the Nantucket Historic Trust provided pay and housing for professionals in the textile arts from all over the world to teach needlery at the resident classes. Workshops were offered year round in subjects such as tapestry, weaving, vegetal dye, spinning, bobbin lace, and silk screen printing. Mary Ann began her book collection as a personal research tool and source for her home study courses. The collection was acquired through working with rare book dealers who specialized in her textile and decorative art interests, and was housed and curated in a library at the School. When the School closed in the late 1970s, Mary Ann had moved to Williamstown; the collection was too large to house at home. In the interests of her continued research and the significance of maintaining the entire collection in a single library available to scholars, the Clark Library was selected as the recipient of the collection. Digitization In 1977 Mary Ann made a generous donation of the collection to the Clark Art Library, which recently completed a digitization project of the collection, thus making 408 of the volumes freely accessible for research. Volumes included in the digitization project were selected for their rarity, fragility and structural complexity. The collection is supported in The Clark Digital Collections. The years‚Äô work of the digitization project was completed with federal funding from a generous grant by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and with funding through the federal Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA). Accessibility The collection is non- circulating, but stacks volumes can be accessed by researchers during the regular working hours as listed on the Library home page. To access rare volumes researchers are encouraged to telephone, e-mail, or write in advance of their visit; contact information is located on the home page. Collection titles can be viewed in the Library Catalog. The digitized rare and stacks volumes are available online through The Clark Digital Collections, and the at Internet Archive Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute Library Collection. Notes on the Royal School of Needlework \\"The Decorative Needlework of which so much has been said and written, of late, is a revival of old- time industries. Begun in London in 1872, this conjuration of forgotten needlecraft was chiefly due to the exertions of a lady moved to pity by the sad fate of a young governess who was found drowned in the Thames, desperate after a long struggle for livelihood in the only career open to her. The idea of creating a school for needlework of the higher ornamental class, thus prompted, has directed into a new channel the efforts of many women disqualified, by delicate health or for other reasons, for self-support by occupations requiring long continued exertion, mental or physical. The Royal School of Art Needlework, first established in a small room over a shop in a side-street, is today a great and beneficent institution, occupying permanent quarters at South Kensington. Rare and elaborate specimens of antique embroidery, with their beautiful designs and multiplicity of stitches, are there restored or imitated, to decorate the wealthy homes of modern England; while the fresh designs of contemporaneous artists are constantly employed in the production of such examples as those made generally known in America by the Centennial Exhibition in 1876.\\"Woman's handiwork in modern homes (1881) Material culture The series De inlandsche kunstnijverheid in Nederlandsch Indie by J. E. Jasper and M. Pirngadie describes the material culture of the former Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) and was first published in 1912. Part I deals with wicker work, basket weaving, and plaiting; Part II focuses on weaving, and Part III covers batik. The drawings by Mas Pirngadi are in color. Notes on the illustrator: \\"Raden Mas Pirgadie was born in Banyumas, west Java, possibly in 1875. As he was from an aristocratic family, he had contact with Dutch residents of the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia) including the artist F.J. Du Chattel (1856‚Äì1917), who taught him to paint with watercolours in 1889. Pirngadie was a very skilled and accurate draftsman, and made illustrations for J.E. Jasper‚Äôs monograph on traditional arts and crafts of the Netherland East Indies that was published in 1912. From 1928, he worked for many years at the Bataviasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen (Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences, now the Museum Nasional) in Batavia (Jakarta). He also designed airmail postaged stamps for the Post en Telegraafdienst (Post and Telegraph Services) of the Netherlands east Indies in 1931. He died in Batavia in 1936. Pirngadie was a master of Western art techniques and produced naturalistic landscapes, portraits of people, and scenes of folk life. For the artist, the realistic technique was most suitable to express the beauty and images of things around him. His style of portraiture gave prominence to showing the accuracy of form, proportion and character of the object. These qualities made a portrait painting successful, standards which had a strong influence on the next generation of Indonesian artists.\\"MAS PIRNGADIE (c. 1875‚Äì1936) * Jasper, J E, and Mas Pirngadie. De Inlandsche Kunstnijverheid in Nederlandsch Indi√´. 's-Gravenhage: Mouton & Co, 1912. NK1059 J38 Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute. Library \\"After Thomas Hope‚Äôs publications George Smith‚Äôs Collection of Designs is probably the most important and influential work on design and decoration of the Regency period both in Britain and America. It is evident that George Smith must have had either fairly accurate drawings or personal knowledge of the Duchess Street interiors and furnishings. ‚ÄòHope's designs were put into general circulation by George Smith, the author of a pattern book which quickly followed Hope's publication and had practically the same title: A Collection of Designs for Household Furniture and Interior Decoration, 1808. Little so far is known about Smith‚Äôs career. He was a practising craftsman who claimed, without justification it seems, to be upholsterer to the Prince of Wales. There is certainly much emphasis on upholstery in his book, a concession to the growing interest in this branch of interior decoration which was largely due to the increasing output of materials from the factories. This was to be of importance for furniture design, not only in the attempt to relate curtains and window cornices to the various styles which were beginning to affect furniture but also in the thicker padding which was being applied to seats of all kinds with consequent influence on their design‚Äô (Frances Collard, Thomas Hope‚Äôs Furniture, in: Thomas Hope, Yale, 2008). ‚ÄòSmith took over many of the classical features of Hope's designs. He makes great use of animal monopodia on a variety of pieces, tables, sideboards, chairs and sofas, for instance, of double lotus leaves meeting centrally in legs and stretchers, of winged feet on tables and cabinets, of console supports on tables and seats, and of varied fashionable decorative ornaments such as stars and bolt heads. His chairs in general adopt the straight lines which were considered to have been the distinguishing mark of ancient furniture, thus failing to continue the use of contrasting curves which were such an attractive feature of the ‚ÄòTrafalgar‚Äô chair. His Household Furniture undoubtedly kept classical types of furniture very much alive, as did the reissue of Tatham‚Äôs Etchings in 1810. But Smith could not possibly match the scholarship which gave precision to many of Hope's designs. ‚ÄòSmith also paid great attention to Gothic designs; indeed his book of 1808 presents more illustrations of this style than any previous publication. He claims that Gothic produced ‚Äòa more abundant variety of ornaments and forms than can possibly be obtained in any other style‚Äô, and he proceeds to apply his Gothic decoration to every kind of furniture. Herein the fundamental error of designing furniture in historical revivals becomes clear. Smith's designs are not Gothic at all; they simply show furniture of current fashionable forms with the addition of Gothic ornament - pierced quatrefoils, crockets, pinnacles, pointed arches, etc. copied from medieval buildings The work was published as a complete volume in boards sometime in 1807 for ¬£4 14s 6d or as here ‚Äòelegantly coloured‚Äô at ¬£7 17s 6d. The British Critic for March 1806 advertises the issue in parts each containing 50 plates price ¬£1 11s 6d each, plain; or elegantly coloured, ¬£2. 12s 6d.‚Äô The first group of 50 plates dated Dec. 1st 1804; the second group of 50 dated July 1st 1805 with the remaining plates dated Dec. 1st 1806 and Jan. 1st 1807.

It has distinctive attributes of its own, but has also drawn heavily from British cuisine and that of the Republic of Ireland. History Northern Ireland‚Äôs culinary heritage has its roots in the staple diet of generations of farming families; bread and potatoes. Historically, limited availability of ingredients and low levels of immigration resulted in restricted variety and relative isolation from wider international culinary influences. Recent decades, however, have seen significant improvements in the standard of local cuisine, characterised by an increase in the variety, quantity and quality of gastropubs and restaurants. There are currently two Michelin star restaurants in Northern Ireland, both of which specialise in traditional dishes made using local ingredients. Northern Irish cuisine received international attention in March 2018 when it was reported that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had Irish stew and sausage with champ for lunch at the Crown Liquor Saloon, during a tour of Belfast. Dishes and foods =Ardglass potted herring= Ardglass potted herring is found in butcher's shops and fish traders. It is herring that is marinated in vinegar, rolled with bay leaf and baked with breadcrumbs. =Breads= Potato bread Potato bread a flat bread prepared with potato, flour, and buttermilk. It is cooked on a griddle. Soda bread soda bread farl Soda bread is one of Northern Ireland‚Äôs griddle breads, it can be eaten straightaway, or cooked until golden in an Ulster fry. They are sometimes eaten with butter and homemade jam, or with savoury food such as smoked salmon, fresh fried eel, or thick dry-cured bacon. Soda bread is a soft, thick and fluffy bread. It was first baked in the 1800s in Ireland, and local people used baking soda to cause the dough to rise. It's typically served with an Ulster fry. Wheaten bread Wheaten bread is a brown bread made with whole wheat flour which also uses baking soda as a rising agent. It is often sweetened in contrast to the savoury white soda bread. Fifteens A soft tray bake cake which gets its name from using Fifteen of each main ingredient (marshmallows, digestive biscuits, cherries). =Boxty= Boxty is mainly found in County Fermanagh, Boxty is a weighty, starchy potato cake made with 50:50 mix of cooked mashed potatoes and grated, strained, raw potato. The most common variety is boiled boxty, also known as hurley, a large round loaf which is boiled whole for several hours, allowed to rest and then sliced and fried, often with bacon. =Champ= Champ is made with potatoes when they are mashed with milk and chopped spring onions are added. =Vegetable soup= There is a particular vegetable soup made throughout Ulster from carrots, celery, thin leeks and parsley, thickened with red lentils and barley. Packets of these six ingredients are often sold together as 'soup veg'. =Dulse= Dulse is a seaweed snack food. Originally, it was harvested by fishermen for income supplementation when fishing was meager. =Pasties= Pasties are made from a mixture of sausage meat, onions, and mashed potato, shaped like a burger and spiced with black pepper. They can be ordered battered from most chip shops. =Ulster fry= A full Ulster fry served in Belfast The best known traditional dish in Northern Ireland is the Ulster fry. An Ulster fry, although not originally particularly associated with breakfast time, has in recent decades been marketed as Northern Ireland's version of a cooked breakfast. It is distinguishable from a full breakfast by its griddle breads ‚Äì soda bread and potato bread, fried (or occasionally grilled) until crisp and golden. Sometimes also including small pancakes. Bacon, sausages, an egg, and (as a modern development) tomato and sometimes mushrooms complete the dish It is usually served with tea and toast. At breakfast people of Northern Ireland are also partial to porridge, made with rolled oats, milk or water and a pinch of salt or sugar. For extra luxury, in the weekend, it can be dressed with cream rather than milk, and brown sugar. Some even add a dash of whiskey. =Yellow man= Yellowman is a crunchy golden confectionery and looks a bit like honeycomb. It is mainly sold at fairs and markets. =Vegetable roll= Another uniquely Northern Irish speciality is vegetable roll ‚Äì slices of peppery minced beef, flavoured with fresh leek, tomato and onion.

Successful installation results in reducing dependence on reading glasses, so that the user can more easily engage in everyday tasks such as using a mobile phone, reading store shelf prices and working on a computer. Corneal inlays are small, thin, and permeable. Typically one is implanted in the non-dominant eye. Jose Barraquer created the first corneal inlay prototype in 1949 in Barcelona, Spain. The flint glass material which he used, however, was found to be unsuitable because of biocompatibility issues.Whitman, Jeffrey. \\"Corneal inlays provide safe, reversible option for presbyopia treatment.\\" Ocular Surgery News U.S. Edition 2012 Aug. Other transparent, permeable materials were tested, including hydrogel polymers in the 1960s. Some early corneal inlay recipients experienced complications, such as corneal opacification, thinning and melting. Researchers soon found that, as well as the material, the thickness of the inlay and the depth at which it was implanted were important, as well as permeability and centration. There was a delay in the general introduction of the treatment while considerable research was done to find safe and reliable combinations of these factors. In 2014, the use of a corneal inlay for treatment of presbyopia has not been approved United States. However, the inlays are in commercial use in some countries in Europe, Asia- Pacific, the Americas and the Middle East. The inlays are implanted into the cornea either in a laser-created corneal pocket or lamellar corneal flap (similar to LASIK). The inlays can be removed should the patient develop another condition requiring medical treatment. Types By 2016, there are four corneal inlays in use: =KAMRA= The KAMRAinlay (AcuFocus, Inc.) is a biocompatible ring that increases the visual depth of field using the physical principle of a small aperture,. This design only allows focused light to enter the eye resulting in an improvement in near and intermediate vision while maintaining distance vision. =FlexivueMicrolens= The FlexivueMicrolens (PresbiaCo√∂peratief U.A.) is a refractive hydrophilic polymer lens. The central zone of the lens is free of refractive power and the peripheral zone has a standard positive refractive power. This inlay works on a similar principle to bifocal glasses. The bifocal design provides two images to the retina simultaneously. Each specific point of focus is delivered as both a sharp and a blurred image. The FlexivueMicrolens is available in a variety of powers, and can be exchanged as presbyopia progresses. =Raindrop= The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay, formerly known as the PresbyLens or Vue+ lens (ReVision Optics, Inc) is a thin transparent biocompatible hydrogel implant. It is 2 mm in diameter and varies in thickness from 10 microns in the periphery to ~30 microns in the center. It is implanted under a femtosecond laser flap onto the stromal bed of the cornea, centered over a light- constricted pupil. The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay reshapes the central region of the cornea to provide a zone of increased power for focusing on near objects. =Icolens= The Icolens System (Neoptics AG) is another refractive hydrophilic polymer lens, similar to the Flexivue Microlens, with no power in the center and the peripheral zone has positive refractive power. This inlay is also available in assorted powers, which may be exchanged as required due to the progression of presbyopia.\\"Advances in the Surgical Correction of Presbyopia\\".

The restaurant was established in 1974 by Peter Varvaro and currently located on Saint-Laurent Boulevard right across the street from their main business rival, the famed Schwartz's Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen. The two restaurants are often compared against each other in their patronage and the flavours of their Montreal-style smoked meat. Varvaro is Italian in background, but grew up immersed in the Jewish language and culture. The deli remains a family business, and two of Varvaro's children have opened their own smoked meat restaurants in the suburbs of Montreal. Some of the regular clients of the Main Deli in the past included Stanley Lewis and Leonard Cohen as well as Celine Dion, who has gone on to become their competition as one of the owners of Schwartz's. Offerings The Main Deli's main offering is smoked meat, which they cure and smoke in the back of their restaurant. Whole beef briskets are cured with brine and their own spice mix consisting of black pepper, garlic, coriander, mustard seed, and other ingredients found in Montreal steak seasonings. The meat is then smoked in a smoking oven and steamed to completion. Peter Varvaro, the owner and maker of the smoked meat at the Main Deli indicates that while the spice mixture is important, it's the method of smoking and cooking the meat that contributes to its flavours and textures.

It states that power has the ability to transform individuals' psychological states. Most organisms have been shown to display one of the two types of reactions within the environment. These two types of reactions are approach and inhibition. Approach Approach is associated with action, seeking rewards or opportunities, increase of physical energy and movement, and self-promotion. Power activates people, increasing their drive, energy, and emotion. Often, perceived power leads to many positive consequences. An increase in power, therefore, leads to approach behaviors. Inhibition Inhibition is associated with reaction, protection of one's self, avoidance of potential threats and danger, vigilance, decrease of motivation, and reduced activity levels. A reduction in power leads to inhibition. References *Forsyth, D.R.(2010). Group Dynamics (5th Edition). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth. *Eltner, D., Gruenfeld, D., & Anderson, C.P. (In press).

See also: \\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\\". Marriage is thought to consist of a covenant between the man, the woman, and God. The church teaches that in addition to civil marriage, which ends at death, a man and woman can undergo a celestial marriage in a temple performed by priesthood authority, whereby the marriage and parent‚Äìchild relationships resulting from the marriage will last forever in the afterlife. From 1852 until 1890, the LDS Church openly authorized polygamous marriages between one man and multiple wives, though polygamous families continued cohabitating into the 1940s and 1950s.Leaders of the church secretly practiced and taught plural marriage from about 1831 to 1852. Today, the church is opposed to such marriages and excommunicates members who participate in them or publicly teach that they are sanctioned by God. The LDS Church also opposes the legalization of same-sex marriage.Fred Karger, \\"The Mormon church won't drop its opposition to gay marriage\\", The Guardian, 2013-11-29. Teachings about marriage in general A spouse is the only person other than the Lord that Latter-day Saints are commanded to love \\"with all [their] heart\\". A revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants states: \\"Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.\\" Church leaders have taught that this commandment applies equally to wives loving their husbands.Spencer W. Kimball, \\"Oneness in Marriage\\", Tambuli, June 1978.Marlin K. Jensen, \\"A Union of Love and Understanding\\", Ensign, October 1994. The LDS Church also teaches that marriage is a partnership of equals, and that partners should be thoughtful, respectful, and loyal to one another. The church teaches that if couples keep their lives centered on Jesus Christ, their love will grow. Regarding marriage and divorce, the church instructs its leaders: \\"No priesthood officer is to counsel a person whom to marry. Nor should he counsel a person to divorce his or her spouse. Those decisions must originate and remain with the individual. When a marriage ends in divorce, or if a husband and wife separate, they should always receive counseling from Church leaders.\\"General Handbook ¬ß 31.2.5. Teachings about celestial marriage Celestial (or eternal) marriage is an ordinance performed by priesthood authority in a temple of the church. A celestial marriage is thought to continue forever into the afterlife if the man and woman do not break their covenants.\\"Chapter 38: Eternal Marriage\\", Gospel Principles (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2011). Thus, eternally married couples are often referred to as being \\"sealed\\" to each other. Sealed couples who keep their covenants are also promised to have their posterity sealed to them in the afterlife. =Celestial marriage as a requirement for exaltation= The LDS Church teaches that a celestial marriage is required for exaltation. This teaching is based on Mormon scripture, in which Joseph Smith taught, ‚ÄúIn the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; and in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]; and if he does not, he cannot obtain it. He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase‚Äù. Exaltation is also known as \\"eternal life\\" and is defined as \\"the kind of life God lives\\".\\"Chapter 47: Exaltation\\", Gospel Principles (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2011). Those who are exalted will \\"live eternally in the presence of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ[;] will become gods[;] will be united eternally with their righteous family members and will be able to have eternal increase [spirit children][; and] will have everything that our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have‚Äîall power, glory, dominion, and knowledge\\". Members of the LDS Church are encouraged to prepare to be celestially married in a temple. It is believed, therefore, that all humans are spirit children of \\"heavenly parents\\" who as mortals were celestially married and went on to become exalted. This married couple is known to Latter-day Saints as God the Father and Heavenly Mother. Because of the beliefs that (1) celestial marriage is required for exaltation, and (2) that Jesus is exalted, some leaders of the LDS Church have hypothesized that Jesus must have been married, possibly to Mary Magdalene, Mary, sister of Lazarus, and/or Martha...Wilford Woodruff, Journal Entry 1883-07-22, reporting on a sermon given by Joseph F. Smith.Joseph Fielding Smith, Handwritten note responding to letter from J. Ricks Smith, 1963. Because it is a requirement for exaltation, celestial marriages are performed vicariously in church temples for deceased couples who were legally married. Civil marriage and divorce and its relationship to celestial marriage In some legal jurisdictions, celestial marriages can be recognized as civil marriages; in other cases, couples are civilly married outside of the temple and are later sealed in a celestial marriage.Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) ¬ß 3.5. The church will no longer perform a celestial marriage on a couple unless they are first (or simultaneously) legally married. A celestial marriage is not annulled by a civil divorce: a \\"cancellation of a sealing\\" may be granted, but only by the First Presidency, the highest authority in the church. Civil divorce and marriage outside the temple carry with them a stigma in Mormon culture; the church teaches that the \\"gospel of Jesus Christ‚Äîincluding repentance, forgiveness, integrity, and love‚Äîprovides the remedy for conflict in marriage.\\"Gospel Topics: Divorce\\", churchofjesuschrist.org. Polygamy Until 1890, the LDS Church openly sanctioned plural marriage, which was the practice of marrying a man celestially to multiple women. Such polygamous marriages were celestial marriages only, not legal civil marriages. Today, the church is opposed to such marriages and excommunicates members who participate in them, whether or not polygamy is legal in the jurisdiction in question. The church teaches that ‚Äúthe standard doctrine of the church is monogamy\\" and that polygamy was a temporary exception to the rule.\\"Polygamy: Latter-day Saints and the Practice of Plural Marriage\\", LDS Newsroom, mormonnewsroom.org. In defence of the practice, some early church leaders taught that God the Father and Jesus Christ both practiced polygamy. These ideas were generally accepted among church members in the 1850s. Interracial marriage In the past, LDS Church leaders have consistently opposed marriage between different ethnicities. The apostle Boyd K. Packer stated in 1977 that \\"[w]e've always counseled in the Church for our Mexican members to marry Mexicans, our Japanese members to marry Japanese, our Caucasians to marry Caucasians, our Polynesian members to marry Polynesians. The counsel has been wise.\\" Nearly every decade beginning with the church's formation until the 1970s has seen some denunciation against miscegenation, with most focusing on black-white marriage. These church leaders' views stem from racist \\"biological and social\\" principles. One exception was intermarriage with Native Americans, who Mormons believed to be Lamanites, a race descended from ancient Israelites. Intermarriage with Native Americans was actually encouraged as a way to fulfill a Book of Mormon prophecy that the Lamanites would become white and delightsome. Church publications have also contained statements discouraging interracial marriage. In the same June 1978 issue announcing that black members were now eligible for temple rites, missionary service, and priesthood ordination, the official newspaper of the LDS Church printed an article entitled \\"Interracial marriage discouraged\\". The same day a church spokesman stated \\"interracial marriages generally have been discouraged in the past, ... that remains our position\\" and that \\"the Church does not prohibit ... interracial marriages but it does discourage them.\\" In 2003 author Jon Krakauer's stated in his Under the Banner of Heaven that \\"official LDS policy has continued to strongly admonish white saints not to marry blacks\\". In response, the church public relations released a statement from BYU Dean of Religious Education Robert L. Millet that \\"[t]here is, in fact, no mention whatsoever in [the church] handbook concerning interracial marriages. In addition, having served as a Church leader for almost 30 years, I can also certify that I have never received official verbal instructions condemning marriages between black and white members.\\"Robert L. Millet, \\"Church Response to Jon Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven\\", June 27, 2003. Though, denying any condemnation of interracial marriage, there was no comment on whether it was still discouraged. The discouragement of marriage between those of different ethnicities by church leaders continued being taught to youth during Sunday meetings until 2013 when the use of the 1996 version of the church Sunday meeting manual for adolescent boys was discontinued. The manual had used a 1976 quote from past church president Spencer W. Kimball that said, \\"We recommend that people marry those who are of the same racial background generally\\". The quote is still in use, however, in the 2003 institute Eternal Marriage Student Manual. Same-sex marriage Protesters in front of the Newport Beach California Temple voicing their opposition to the church's support of Prop 8 Beginning in the mid-1990s, the LDS Church began to focus its attention on the issue of same-sex marriages. It officially endorsed a federal amendment to the United States Constitution as well as Utah Constitutional Amendment 3 banning any marriages not between one man and one woman. It opposed same-sex marriage in Hawaii and California and urged its members to donate time and money towards the initiative. In California, church members accounted for 80 to 90 percent of volunteers who campaigned door-to- door and as much as half of the nearly $40 million raised during the campaign on Proposition 8. Members who did not support the church's position could be subject to church discipline, depending on circumstances and the judgement of local leadership. In reference to church involvement with legislation around LGBT people and marriage the apostle M. Russell Ballard has said the church is \\"locked in\\" if anything interferes with the principle of marriage being between a man and a woman, and stated that a very careful evaluation is made to determine what action is appropriate. Marriage statistics for Latter-day Saints In 2008 the American Religious Identification Survey reported: \\"Mormons have the highest proportions of currently married adults, and lowest divorce rates reflecting the emphasis on family values in this tradition .... Commitment to 'traditional or normative family values' is measured by creating a combined index of the proportions divorced and cohabiting, whereby those traditions that score lowest are the most familial. The tradition with the lowest percentages on this index are Mormons (11%)\\".

Its potential impacts include global warming, sea level rise, and increased extreme weather events. Climate change is a direct consequence of elevated greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Some examples include Carbon dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous oxide. They are emitted from fossil fuel burning. Electricity production generates the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, other sources include transportation, industry, and agriculture.  Effects of greenhouse gases  These gases are said to make the planet warmer by ‚Äúthickening the Earth‚Äôs blanket.‚Äù This can lead to the overall average annual temperature to increase. Moreover, global warming will decrease snow and glaciers resulting in rising sea levels and increased coastal flooding. In addition, continued warming from the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is expected to have substantial impacts on the economy, other environmental issues and human health. Warming is likely to worsen conditions for air quality and increase the risk of heat-related illnesses. In addition, the frequency and strength of extreme event such as floods and storms are likely to threaten safety and health. In turn, warming temperatures are likely to change water resources which affect many areas, including energy production, human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. Steam to hot water conversion action plan In 2011, UBC created one of the largest steam to hot water conversions to replace UBC's old steam system. The new system will increase operational efficiencies by reducing heat distribution losses. It will heat the campus while operating at a significantly lower average temperature of 80 ¬∞C, rather than 190 ¬∞C and as a result, it will result in substantial energy and financial savings. The campus has used natural gas for heat since the 1960s.http://energy.ubc.ca/projects/district-energy/powerhouse/ The new \\"neighborhood district energy system\\" will use high-efficiency natural gas boilers. New system's purpose The main purpose of this project is to reduce campus greenhouse gas emissions. The new hot water system will reduce UBC's district heating system energy use by 24 per cent. Furthermore, it will reduce UBC's greenhouse gas emissions by 22 per cent. To save money on operational and energy costs and to advance clean energy research and development opportunities. For example, it will save 4 million a year in operational and energy costs. Moreover, to facilitate a long-term target of eliminating the use of fossil fuels on campus by 2050. Progress UBC's steam heating system pipes run underground. The hot water conversion will occur in nine different construction phases to minimize campus disruption. For example, phases two through seven will be completed from 2012 to 2015. They will be used to reduce natural gas consumption on campus.

The building is dedicated to research collaboration and outreach on urban sustainability. It was officially opened in November 2011. The CIRS vision is to be the most innovative high performance building in North America and an internationally recognized leader in accelerating the adopt of sustainable building and urban practices. Some key features: * 600 tons of carbon dioxide sequestered in the structure * Campus energy consumption reduced by 275 megawatt-hours per year * Water 100% supplied by rainwater * Campus carbon dioxide emissions reduced by 150 tons each year It has been certified LEED Platinum by the Canada Green Building Council. Mission * Develop applied technical solutions in building materials and design for commercialization by partners. * Combine expert knowledge and public values and preferences in exploring pathways to a sustainable society. * Collaborate with private, public and non-governmental organization sector partners to create superior policy and business decisions for sustainable urban development. * Educate, train and demonstrate sustainable technologies and services and the practices of sustainable urban development. Goals * Be a world leader in three critical areas of sustainability research: technology, communication, participation and behaviour change, and policy and investment. * Make real progress on sustainability in the region and transform the UBC campus into a testing ground for alternative energy sources, and technologies. * Be an incubator for sustainability technologies and capitalize on the enormous export potential to enter the trillion-dollar global urban infrastructure market. History The CIRC was conceived in 2000 by Professor John Robinson and designed by Peter Busby who excelled in green building designs. Together, they organized and talked to potential partners which led to Alberto Cayuela, formally an employee of Stantec and now associate director responsible for CIRS, joining the team as program manager. Once funding and concept was decided, the location was chosen. Originally, it was to be built on the UBC Point Grey campus, but, because CIRS was an inter-instituational project (UBC leads the project in conjunction with Simon Fraser University, BC Institute of Technology, and Emily Carr University of Art + Design) it was felt that the Great Northern Way campus would be a better position. In line with the idea of an inter-institutional project, the new position would expand its scope and breadth. In 2008, the decision to move CIRS back to UBC Point Grey campus was made due to delays to the project timeline brought on by the complexity of building on the Great Northern Campus. Although, now only one institution (UBC) owned CIRS, other institutions continued to participate through other means. Construction began in 2009 with excavation and foundation work for the first six months with the building being complete in August 2011. Building Benefits =Structural Systems= The CIRS is constructed of wood and allows for various benefits such as reducing ecological impact, sequestering carbon, helping the mitigation of an ecological problem, bringing warmth to the building interiors, and also maximizing daylight and views. =Building Materials= The primary exterior material is white brick, clear glazing, wood, and neutral colored concrete. The benefits are the reduction of 'red list' materials, improvement of indoor air quality, reduction of material waste, and reduction of carbon emissions. =Energy Systems= The CIRS achieves a net-positive energy performance and reduces UBC's overall energy consumption by over 1 million kilowatt hours per year. The energy system benefits the project by providing a comparison between energy modelling processes, allows for more opportunities for research and system testing, inspire a new approach to energy supply/consumption, reduce heat demand and carbon emissions of neighboring buildings, and provide opportunities for continued learning. =Rainwater System= CIRS is entirely water self- sufficient by harvesting rainwater and stored in a 100-cubic-meter cistern underneath the building. Around 1,226,000 litres of rainwater is harvested throughout the year, and average demand is 2000 litres per day. The benefits of a rainwater potable water system is that it creates awareness, educates the public on water supply/consumption, reduces potable water demand, promotes stormwater management, and provides an onsite water source for fire suppression. =Reclaimed Water= All the reclaimed water originates either from the CIRS building or sewer system which is treated onsite using a Solar Aquatics wastewater treatment system and reused in the building for toilet flushing and to irrigate the living roof, landscaped areas and the living wall. The main benefit of this treatment system is awareness and engaging the public in viewing sustainability as a possibility. =Lighting= Narrow floor plates allowed for daylight penetration and light to enter the building from both sides. The benefits is that it improves the inhabitant health and comfort, creates a friendly space, reduces energy consumption and cost, and provides a surface for photovoltaic cells. =Ventilation= The CIRS uses a mixed mode system utilizing mostly passive natural ventilation. There are two mechanical air handling units that supply fresh filtered air: one to the large auditorium and the other to the rest of the building. In addition, there are manual operable windows that allows for airflow and temperature control. This system reduces energy consumption, connects the inhabitants with nature, and improve their health. Public Recognition The CIRS has been publicly recognized by many as \\"North America's Greenest Building\\" and one of the greenest buildings in the world. Most recently in 2013, the CIRS won the Green Building Award awarded by the Wood WORKS! BC Wood Design Awards. Building material. SILVA PANEL for exterior cladding .

W.; Martin, F. X.; Byrne, F. J.; Cosgrove, A.: Oxford, OUP, 1976 Life The son of Claud Hamilton of Cochno in Dumbartonshire, he was educated at Glasgow University, where he proceeded D.D. Advanced by James I in 1623 to the joint sees of Killala and Achonry, he was consecrated in St. Peter's Church, Drogheda, on 29 June following. On 20 April 1630 he was translated to the archbishopric of Cashel and Emly. The temporalities of his see having been much diminished by Miler Magragh, Hamilton petitioned Thomas Wentworth for their recovery. It required a special letter of instruction from the king to undo the acts of Magragh. Archbishop William Laud cautioned Wentworth to keep a sharp eye on Hamilton, who then incurred Laud's displeasure. Summoned to Dublin to explain matters, Hamilton pleaded inability to travel. His friends, including the Queen of Bohemia, interceded with the king. When the Irish Rebellion of 1641 broke out in Tipperary, Hamilton was absent from his diocese, and joined by his wife and family, who had been helped by Catholic neighbours, he left for Sweden. His loss of personal property in the rebellion was great. He is usually said to have died at Stockholm, aged about 80, in 1659.Johan Peringski√∂ld, in his Monumenta Ullerakerensia cum Upsalia Nova Illustrata (Stockholm, 1719, p. 176), stated that he died at Upsala in 1658, and lies buried in the cathedral there, in the same grave as Laurentius Petri Nericius. Johan Henrik Schr√∂der in his Upsala Domkyrka (2nd edit., Upsala, 1857), p. 27, repeated this statement, but the destruction by fire in 1702 of the Upsala church registers made confirmation impossible.

It allows the creation of larger types, such as universes, than inductive types. The types created still remain predicative inside ITT. An inductive definition is given by rules for generating elements of a type. One can then define functions from that type by induction on the way the elements of the type are generated. Induction-recursion generalizes this situation since one can simultaneously define the type and the function, because the rules for generating elements of the type are allowed to refer to the function. Induction-recursion can be used to define large types including various universe constructions. It increases the proof-theoretic strength of type theory substantially. Nevertheless, inductive-recursive recursive definitions are still considered predicative. Background Induction- Recursion came out of investigations to the rules of Martin-L√∂f's intuitionistic type theory. The type theory has a number of \\"type formers\\" and four kinds of rules for each one. Martin-L√∂f had hinted that the rules for each type former followed a pattern, which preserved the properties of the type theory (e.g., strong normalization, predicativity). Researchers started looking for the most general description of the pattern, since that would tell what kinds of type formers could be added (or not added!) to extend the type theory. The \\"universe\\" type former was the most interesting, because when the rules were written \\"√† la Tarski\\", they simultaneously defined the \\"universe type\\" and a function that operated on it. This eventually lead Dybjer to Induction-Recursion. Dybjer's initial papers called Induction-Recursion a \\"schema\\" for rules. It stated what type formers could be added to the type theory. Later, he and Setzer would write a new type former with rules that allowed new Induction-Recursion definitions to be made inside the type theory. This was added to the Half proof assistant (a variant of Alf). The idea Before covering Inductive-Recursive types, the simpler case is Inductive Types. Constructors for Inductive types can be self-referential, but in a limited way. The constructor's parameters must be \\"positive\\": * not refer to the type being defined * be exactly the type being defined, or * be a function that returns the type being defined. With Inductive types, a parameter's type can depend on earlier parameters, but they cannot refer to ones of the type being defined. Inductive-Recursive types go further and parameter's types can refer to earlier parameters that use the type being defined. These must be \\"half-positive\\": * be a function depending on an earlier parameter if that parameter is wrapped in the function being defined. So, if D is the type being defined and f is the function being (simultaneously) defined, these parameter declarations are positive: * a:A * d:D * g:A \\\\to Type * h:A \\\\to D * i:A \\\\to B \\\\to D * j: g\\\\ a (Depends on earlier parameters, none of which are type D.) This is half-positive: * k : (f\\\\ d) \\\\to D (Depends on parameter d of type D but only through call to f.) These are not positive nor half-positive: * k: D \\\\to A (D is a parameter to the function.) * l: (A \\\\to D) \\\\to A (The parameter takes a function that returns D, but returns A itself.) * m: z\\\\ d (Depends on d of type D, but not through the function f.)  Universe example  A simple common example is the Universe √† la Tarski type former. It creates a type U and a function T. There is an element of U for every type in the type theory (except U itself!). The function T maps the elements of U to the associated type. The type U has a constructor (or introduction rule) for each type former in the type theory. The one for dependent functions would be: constructor_\\\\Pi (u:U) (u' : T(u) \\\\to U) : U That is, it takes an element u of type U that will map to the type of the parameter, and a function u' such that for all values x:T(u), u'(x) maps to the return type of the function (which is dependent on the value of the parameter, x). (The final :U says that the result of the constructor is an element of type U.) The reduction (or computation rule) says that T(constructor_\\\\Pi(u, u')) becomes \\\\prod_{x:T(u)} T(u'(x)). After reduction, the function T is operating on a smaller part of the input. If that holds when T is applied to any constructor, then T will always terminate. Without going into the details, Induction-Recursion states what kinds of definitions (or rules) can be added to the theory such that the function calls will always terminate. Usage Induction-Recursion is implemented in Agda and Idris.

The building was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2016.Tile: UNESCO approves all 3 Indian nominations for heritage tag, Publisher: India Today news, Published on: 18 July 2016, Accessed on: 18 July 2016  History  View of the building After the partition of Punjab in 1947 following the independence of India, the divided Punjab required a new capital to replace Lahore, which was now in Pakistan. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru commissioned Le Corbusier to build a new city for the capital of Punjab. This city would become Chandigarh. Nehru desired that the city's design be \\"unfettered by the traditions of the past, a symbol of the nation's faith in the future\\". Subsequently, Corbusier and his team designed not just a large assembly and high court building, but all major buildings in the city, down to the door handles in public offices. Construction of the Palace of Assembly began in 1951 and ended 11 years later in 1962. The building was inaugurated on 15 April, 1964. Today, many of the buildings in Chandigarh are considered modernist masterpieces, though most are in a state of neglect. In 2010, chairs from the assembly building were auctioned in London. A diplomatic attempt to stop the sale failed, as the items were \\"condemned\\" and deemed unfit for use.  Design  = Entrance = Entrance with set of doors painted by Le Corbusier Le Corbusier wanted to include an assembly door. He consulted with Prime Minister Nehru for symbols that could be depicted on the door to represent the new India and its modern vision. Nehru, in turn, entrusted Le Corbusier to invent them himself. The door is adorned with vibrant colors and is divided into upper and lower halves. The upper half depicts man's relationship with the cosmos and includes imagery representing solstices, lunar eclipses and the Equinox. The lower half is populated with animals and natural forms. A desert depicts the original order of the Earth, while greenery represents the Garden Of Eden. The door also displays a river, trees, bulls, and turtles, and the proverbial Tree of Knowledge in the center of the door bears fruits of knowledge. The nearly 25 square foot door, with its enameled panels, was airlifted from Paris, France. This entrance is opened on certain ceremonial occasions. = Interior layout = Le Corbusier believed that \\"architecture is circulation\\", and the Palace of Assembly is designed to encourage the movement of people and ideas. High ceilings and narrow columns make the space feel expansive, and ramps replace stairs to provide fluid transitions between levels. The General Assembly itself is circular - a literal interpretation of Le Corbusier's belief - and is off-center within the space, challenging neoclassical architecture's focus on organization.

It was once the home of the Lawson familyBulmers, History and Directory of Cumberland (1901) pages 731‚Äì3 and is a grade I listed building. History =Norman period= The recorded history of Isel begins during the reign of Henry II when Alan, the son of Waltheof, granted Randulph d'Engayne the demesnes of Ishall, Redmain and Blencrake. Randulph's granddaughter and heiress Ada married Simon de Morville, lord of the barony of Burgh by Sands, whose son Hugh left two daughters as coheirs, Ada and Joan.It was said that Sir Hugh Morville was one of the four who carried out the assassination of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, however, many historians dispute this and suggest it was Sir Hugh of Knaresborough who partook in the murder. The manor of Isel fell to the elder sister's share. Ada married Richard de Lucy of Egremont; and later Thomas de Multon, to whom she had a son and heir, Thomas. In the reign of Henry III this Thomas, entailed Isel and Blencrake on his younger son Hubert. Hubert Moulton enjoyed Isel for his lifetime, after which his son William entered the story.Nicolson and Burn Vol 2 =The Leigh connection= In 1315, William's daughter Margaret married Sir William de Leigh and this brought Isel into the Leigh family for a period stretching from the reign of Edward II (1307‚Äì1327) until 1572. William died in 1354, leaving five sons and two daughters; he is buried beside his horse in Isel churchyard. In the year 1499, one Robert Leigh of Isel assisted Elizabeth Dykes to prosecute an appeal against Thomas Curwen and others for the murder of her husband Alexander Dykes. The award made by Richard Redmain, bishop of Exeter; Master Christopher Urswyk, archdeacon of Richmond; Edward Redmain and Sir Thomas Dykes; stated that:- ::‚Äúwhereas the said parties were nigh of blood the said Elizabeth should no longer sue her appeal, but that the said Thomas Curwen and his partakers shall shew themselves meekly sorry for his death , and shall pay to the said Elizabeth four score pounds of lawful money, and further find one honest priest to sing for the soul of the said Alexander, in the church at Isel, by the space of two years, paying yearly for his salary seven marks of lawful money.‚Äù In 1509, one Sir Edward Redmain possessed Isel, having married, in 1485, the lady Elizabeth, widow of Sir Thomas Leigh, and daughter of Sir John Huddlestone of Millom. Elizabeth died in 1529, leaving Isel to Sir John Leigh. The Patent Rolls for 1530 confirm the title.Patent Rolls, 21 Henry VIII, p. I, III, Nov. II In 1544 john Leigh held the manor of Isel and Blencrake of the King by the service of one knight's fee and the cornage of 46s. 8d. (¬£2 33p). He was High Sheriff of Cumberland in 1548 and again in 1557; he died in 1563. Thomas Leigh, the last of the name, gave Isel to his second wife, Maud Redmain, who afterwards married for her third husband Wilfred Lawson, who conveyed the inheritance over to him.Curwen page 122-3 =The Lawson era= The Lawsons can trace their descent to John Lawson, lord of Fawkegrave, Yorkshire to the early part of the 13th century.Burke and Burke (1844), p.86 Through a long line of eminent ancestors we arrive at Sir Wilfrid Lawson (1545‚Äì1632), son of Thomas Lawson (died 1559) of Little Usworth, County Durham, and his wife Elizabeth Darrell, daughter of Constantine Darrell of Wiltshire.Hutchinson p.241-2 (1797) He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1562 and at Gray's Inn in 1564. In 1591 the Earl of Northumberland made him Lieutenant of the Honour of Cockermouth (Grand Steward of all his estates) and the Conveyor of the Commissioners of the Marches. He was High Sheriff of Cumberland in 1583. In 1593 he was elected Member of Parliament for Cumberland. He was High Sheriff of Cumberland again in 1597. In 1604, he was elected MP for Cumberland again. He was knighted in 1604 and in 1605 was appointed convener to the royal commission set up to govern the Anglo-Scottish border. He was High Sheriff again in 1606 and in 1612. In 1614 he was elected MP for Cumberland again. History of Parliament Online ‚Äì Wilfred Lawson Lawson died childless in 1632 at the age of 87 years and was succeeded by his great nephew Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 1st Baronet, of Isell. Sir Wilfred Lawson was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1679. Lawson was born in 1610, the son of William Lawson, and his wife Judith Bewley, daughter of William Bewley of Hesket. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford on 21 November 1628, aged 17. He was knighted by Charles I on 28 February 1641. History of Parliament Online ‚Äì Lawson, Sir Wilfred In 1688, shortly before his death he purchased a baronets patent from James II.Lyson and Lyson (1816), p.120 He also purchased Brayton from the Salkeld family and settled the family estate at Isel on his grandson Wilfrid (son of his first son William), who subsequently became Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet; and to Wilfrid his second son he conferred the estate of Brayton, so founding the line of 'Brayton' Lawsons. Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet (31 October 1664 ‚Äì November 1704)http://www.leighrayment.com/baronetage/baronetsL1.htm was an English politician. He was the son of William Lawson and inherited his title on the death of his grandfather Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 1st Baronet, of Isell in 1688. He married Elizabeth daughter and heir to George Preston of Holker Hall, Lancashire. They had three sons; Wilfrid, William and John. Lawson was High Sheriff of Cumberland in 1689, and elected to represent Cockermouth in 1690.Furguson p.462 (1871) On 11 November 1704, Lawson died. He was succeeded by his eldest son Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 3rd Baronet, of Isell.History of Parliament Online ‚Äì Sir Wilfred Lawson Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 3rd Baronet, of Isell FRS (1697 ‚Äì 13 July 1737), was a British politician. He was educated Queen's College, Oxford, graduating in 1713; and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1715. He was Groom of the Bedchamber to George I from 1720 to 1725; and was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society in 1718. He married Elizabeth Lucy, daughter of the Hon. Harry Mordaunt MP and niece of the Earl of Peterborough. The marriage produced two sons Wilfrid and Mordaunt and two daughters Elizabeth and Charlotte. He was one of the Lawson Baronets, the son and heir of Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, of Isell. In 1718, Lawson became Member of Parliament for the Boroughbridge constituency.Furguson p.466-7 (1871) In 1722, Lawson was returned for Cockermouth, which he represented until his death. Upon his death at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1737, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 4th Baronet (1731‚Äì39). However, he died in infancy. He was succeeded by his brother Sir Mordaunt Lawson, 5th Baronet (1735‚Äì43) who also died in infancy; so ending the supremacy of the Isel Lawson's.History of Parliament Online ‚Äì Sir Wilfred Lawson The residency at Isel after 1743, becomes rather sketchy. We can, with a degree of confidence, assume that branches of the Lawson family continued to live there until the arrival of the Wybergh family in 1806. After this date various members of the Wybergh family are recorded. In 1856, William Wybergh of Isel Hall died; the new owner was his brother John, who in turn was followed by his son, also called John.Carlisle Journal, 20 October 1856 At the time of her Royal highness the Princess Louise and her husband the Marquis of Lorne stayed at Isel on their way to open a bazaar at Carlisle in aid of the Cumberland Infirmary in September 1877, they were the guests of Percy S Wyndham MP.West Cumberland Times, 22 September 1856 In 1891 Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 3rd Baronet, of Brayton (21 October 1862 ‚Äì 28 August 1937), an English Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1910 to 1916 took over the estate. He remained at Isel until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by his nephew Sir Hilton Lawson, 4th Baronet. =Modern day= After the death of Sir Hilton Lawson, 4th Baronet, Isel Hall was sold by private sale to Margaret Austin-Leigh of Fareham, Hampshire, a first cousin of the previous owner.West Cumberland Times, 30 July 1960 Margaret was the daughter of Lucy Thurston and granddaughter to Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, of Brayton. In 1941, Margaret married Richard Austen-Leigh, the great nephew of Jane Austen through her brother, Henry's marriage. He was a publisher, printer and writer, who had revised the edited works of Jane Austen. He died in 1961. During Margaret's time at Isel she bred Shetland ponies and large Poodle dogs. Margaret had no children and upon her death in 1986 she left Isel to her friend and distant relative Mary Burkett OBE. Mary had recently retired from a distinguished career as director of Abbot Hall Art gallery and Museum, Kendal. At Abbot Hall she won the first award for Best museum of the Year, had served on committees of the Arts Council and Crafts Council and served as member of a visiting team of Museum Directors who had visited the United States in 1981 in an advisory role. Mary compiled a memoir of a former parlour maid at Isel Hall, Miss May Moore (I Was Only A Maid ‚Äì the life of a remarkable woman, Firpress Ltd., Workington), who also featured in a Border TV documentary filmed at the Hall in 1997. Mary carried out, with the help of English Heritage many improvements to the fabric of the building, with special attention to the Pele Tower, the terrace and the sunken garden.Rickerby page 21 Miss Burkett passed away in late 2014, leaving the house to its current owners. The Site The edifice stands on a curious, almost unique, site on the north side of the River Derwent. Such a position at first sight appears contrary to all precedents, for whenever there is a stream in the vicinity we invariably find an English Pele tower placed on the southern bank, so as to interpose the river between it and the northern enemy. However, the geography of the region today is somewhat different from that of the medieval period. There existed at that time a dense impenetrable forest between Isel, Uldale and Wigton with no roads through for the marauding Scots to descend. Their only way would be by the old Roman road from Carlisle and Wigton to Cockermouth, or else by galleys from Dumfries to Allonby or Flimby, and then up the Derwent valley. Isel, therefore could only be reached from the south, hence the Hall is situated in the correct position. The site is further protected by a woodland stream running around the north and the west sides. It is called the Bloomer Beck, which suggests that it may have been the site a forge or iron smelter.Curwen page 125 Description =Pele tower= The most striking feature of Isel Hall is the Pele Tower, which together with the Great Hall is one of the oldest parts of the building. The exact age remains unclear. We know that in the year 1387 an army of Scots under the banners of the dukes of Douglas and Fife raided and captured Cockermouth Castle, and laid waste to the surrounding countryside. The present building most probably dates to a time shortly after this occurrence. Unfortunately there are no records to authenticate the date of erection of the Pele Tower. Although both the Crown and the Warden of the Marches granted such licenses, no public records relating to the proceedings of the latter are available for collaboration. There is however one architectural feature to offer a clue to the period. This is a Carnarvon arched doorway in the basement of the tower. It is a wide doorway writes Curwen, so it could be a late example and places the tower in the early fifteenth century. The tower consists of the customary vaulted basement with three stories over. It is rectangular shaped and of medium size, measuring externally 13 metres by 7.75 metres on a north‚Äìsouth axis. The masonry is of freestone rubble with red sandstone dressings to the sixteenth century windows. There is no plinth or offset of any kind, although the parapet ejects beyond the face of the wall. The height is 13 metres and the walls are 2 metres thick. The basement is barrel vaulted, and divided by a cross wall, in which is the previously mentioned Carnarvon arched doorway. The three floors above are reached by short flights of stairs and passages. On the top floor are two light windows with square heads and drip stones in common with the period of Henry VIII. To this tower, but not in axis, the owner added a domestic range. This addition has no windows. =The Grand Hall= The later wing, also started in the 16th century, protruding in a westerly direction, is about 38 metres in length. It has a gable-roof and a plain parapet relieved on both fronts at intervals by small open stone arches surmounted by short pinnacles and having the form of a prick spur. The wing is lighted by rows of square mullioned windows which have red sandstone dressed quoins, and above the windows over the doorway is a square tablet enclosing a weather-worn coat of arms. Projecting from this wing was a further wing, now gone, balancing the Pele Tower to form an open courtyard.Rickerby page 5 The owner built the earliest part of this extended wing in the early part of the 16th century; it comprised a banqueting hall, looking towards the south, together with a new entrance hall with bedrooms over. The banqueting hall, occupied the space of the present dining room, study, and passage, and measured 12.2 metres by 7.3 metres. Four very wide and richly moulded beams span the ceiling, while laid across these are smaller moulded ribs to support the above floors. The beautiful Tudor panelling surrounding this block of rooms is one of the most interesting features of the hall. We find the Lawson arms, inlaid, above the doorway of the present study; while the adjoining panels are ornamented in colour with different devices and figures. =The Fa√ßade= The fa√ßade of the Hall is another peculiar feature which calls for attention. The line of the eaves is broken at regular intervals by a form of ornament superimposed upon the top of the wall and of which only one parallel example exists, that is at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire. The principal ornament consists of an open arch rib with the feet sunk lightly below the eaves but which rise up clear of the slates being surmounted on the crown by a terminal. At intermediate distances somewhat smaller ones occur, but in these the arch is not pierced, neither do the feet penetrate into the wall. Sale of interior property In July 1960 the auctioneers erected an enormous marquee on the terrace lawn outside of the front door of Isel Hall, overlooking the River Derwent. The three-day sale, comprising 1,071 lots, filled 30 pages of the sale catalogue. There were 20 lots of metal ware, 37 of plated ware, 109 of silver, 264 of furniture, 34 of carpets and rugs, 66 of china and glass, and many more of paintings, curtains, books and linen. One may gain an understanding of the work of the linen maids in the great country houses by studying the content of the catalogue. Almost 300 lots of linen came under the hammer, including 31 tablecloths, 60 linen sheets, 90 table napkins, and over 200 towels.West Cumberland Times, 23 July 1960 Although dealers attended from all over the country and from abroad the majority of the items went to local people. The highest price paid was ¬£300 for an inlaid mahogany Hepplewhite break front bookcase, the top enclosed by two central and two side astragal glass doors. Other interesting prices are:- ¬£10, a pair of Georgian salt cellars with spoons; ¬£32, a Georgian lidded tankard; ¬£60, a Georgian coffee pot and spirit lamp; ¬£50, a Georgian snuff box with musical box fitting; ¬£85, a Georgian three bottle inkstand; ¬£22, a Georgian oval fluted teapot; ¬£27, a Georgian oval matching tea caddy; ¬£100, six Georgian shell pattern butter dishes; ¬£92, a pair of Adam design Georgian design sauce boats. Furniture:- ¬£52, a pair of Chinese Chippendale mahogany chairs; ¬£70, a longcase clock in seaweed marquetry and walnut; ¬£50, a Regency mahogany sideboard; ¬£240, a rosewood writing table; ¬£75, antique walnut chest of drawers; ¬£80, pair of Hepplewhite mahogany armchairs; ¬£140, antique rosewood sofa table; ¬£180 antique mahogany Sheraton card table; ¬£125, Georgian partners mahogany desk. Carpets:- ¬£180, a Persian carpet; ¬£135, another Persian carpet. China:- ¬£40, part of Early English dinner service; ¬£95, 168 piece Minton dinner service; ¬£40, 45 piece Copenhagen part tea and coffee service. However, the bargain of the day went unnoticed, that of an Italian renaissance painting which had hung in the Dining room at Isel for over two hundred years. The painting, considered a copy of an almost identical painting hanging in the pitti Palace in Florence, known as the Three Ages of Man is arguably the work of Italian painter Giorgione. The unnamed buyer paid the paltry sum of ¬£200. Within a year, John Harrington, an American multi millionaire art collector, had purchased the painting from an Atlanta auction saleroom. Harrington would dedicate the next 30 years of his life travelling the art houses of the world trying to prove that the painting is an authentic masterpiece.West Cumberland Times, 14 October 1988 See also * Listed buildings in Blindcrake References Bibliography     * Category:Houses completed in the 15th century Category:Towers completed in the 15th century Category:English Heritage sites in Cumbria Category:Peel towers in Cumbria Category:Country houses in Cumbria Category:Tourist attractions in Cumbria Category:History of Cumbria Category:Grade I listed buildings in Cumbria Category:Grade I listed houses ","title":"Isel Hall"},{"id":"38365740","text":"Ahmadiyeh (, also Romanized as A·∏©madƒ´yeh; also known as A·∏©mad Rowghanƒ´) is a village in Kamazan-e Olya Rural District, Zand District, Malayer County, Hamadan Province, Iran.

A training system typically employs a syllabus or similar document that specifies and outlines the coursework to be followed. A training system may also incorporate a training manual that may serve as a guide, reference source, or both during training. A training system typically mandates the use of specific teaching methods for coursework; the choice of the teaching methods to be used depends largely on the information or skill being taught and the aptitude and skills of the trainee. Specialized equipment is often used in training systems that are used to teach physical skills. For example, a barre is used in ballet training. In some cases, simulators are used, especially when the use of actual hardware is impractical due to high cost or risk of injury. Examples of this are the flight simulators used in pilot training and the tactical engagement simulation systems used in combat training. Types Training systems are categorized in various ways. For example, military training systems are generally categorized as live, virtual, or constructive, according to the nature of the trainees' interaction with training equipment and each other. A \\"live\\" training system is one in which real people operate real equipment in the field, whereas \\"virtual\\" training systems involve real people operating models of real equipment in virtual environments. \\"Constructive\\" systems involve simulations where real people initiate events that stimulate the simulation but event outcomes are determined by the overall simulation.

Fleming Allan was born in California. His mother was a native of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.Fleming Allan, Occupation: Composer, resident in Hollywood, 1935 address in Chicago, residing with mother Minnie Fleming, divorced. 1940 United States Federal Census He worked at WLS (AM) in Chicago around the time that Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette were singing for that station, then moved to Hollywood. He spent most of the rest of his life in California, writing songs for many movies in the 1930s and 1940s. For a period in the early 1950s, Allen and the Mesner brothers operated Intro Records, a BMI affiliate. In January 1954 he left this job to join Gene Autry's music publishing business. Allan composed songs for western movies by Autry, Ken Curtis, Tim Holt, Rod Cameron, Ray Whitley, Bob Baker, George O'Brien, Roy Rogers and Dick Foran. His songs were recorded by Roy Rogers (I've Sold My Saddle for an Old Guitar), Gene Autry (Old Buckaroo) and Eddie Dean. He died in Los Angeles on his 62nd birthday.

The locomotives were notable for their green with gold trim liveries, and have been regarded by Smithsonian curator John H. White Jr. as being \\"among the most celebrated passenger locomotives operated in the United States....\\" Development In 1923, the Southern Railway began placing an order for new locomotives of the 4-6-2 Pacific design capable of handling up to fourteen cars over a moderate grade, as well as top speeds of .. The first group of locomotives were built by the American Locomotive Company at their Schenectady Works in that year, with twenty six delivered to the Southern, numbered 1366-1392; as well as five for the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific, numbered 6471-6475; and four for the Alabama Great Southern, numbered 6684-6687.. These locomotives were derived from the standard USRA Heavy Pacific design, but had notable differences based on the Southern's needs. The Ps-4s had smaller driving wheels (73 inches vs. 79 inch USRA design), as well as larger, more spacious cabs, and featured single unit 3-B Worthington feedwater heaters under the left-hand running boards. The queens of steam locomotives In 1925, Southern Railway president Fairfax Harrison traveled to the United Kingdom, where he admired the country's London and North Eastern Railway's use of green-painted steam locomotives. In 1926, Harrison's trip had inspired the appearance of the second order of Ps-4s, which was being built by ALCO's Richmond Works at the time. These Ps-4s were painted in Sylvan green with gold leaf trimming and lettering. This order consisted of eleven locomotives for the Southern, numbered 1393-1404; seven for the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific, numbered 6476-6482; and four for the Alabama Great Southern, numbered 6688-6691.. Aside from the paint scheme, which would soon be applied to all of Southern's passenger locomotives, the second order had other notable differences. They featured an Elesco feedwater heater rather than the Worthington heaters of the previous order, with the former placed on top of the smokebox between the stack and bell instead of under the running boards as the latter were placed. The second order also had larger tenders better suited for long-distance passenger runs, with three-axle bogies and 14,000-gallon water capacity, versus the two-axle bogie, 10,000-gallon standard USRA tender design of the first order. The final Ps-4s were built in 1928 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, consisting of only five engines for the Southern, numbered 1405-1409. These engines featured smaller tenders than the second order, but still larger than those of the first order, featuring two-axle bogies and a 12,000-gallon capacity. They also had Walschaerts valve gear instead of the Baker valve gear on previous orders. The final locomotive of the series, No. 1409, featured an extended smokebox with a Coffin feedwater heater.. This heater was fitted on an experimental basis and was later removed in favor of the Worthington heaters used in the first order.. In 1941, No. 1380 was given bullet-nose streamlining designed by Otto Kuhler for use on the railway's Tennessean service, which operated between Washington, DC, and Monroe, Virginia, connecting in the latter to the Norfolk and Western Railway, who had assigned its streamlined J class engines to its connecting lines... When the Tennessean was dieselized, No. 1380 joined the remainder of the Ps-4s assigned elsewhere on other express trains until it retired in 1953, though it retained its streamlining.. Revenue service The Ps-4 locomotives were assigned to many of the Southern's most famous passenger trains, including the Crescent, Piedmont Limited, Aiken-Augusta Special, and the Birmingham Special. The Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific assigned the engines to their Royal Palm, Ponce de Leon, Queen & Crescent, and Florida Sunbeam trains, among others. In 1941, the Southern began to retire the Ps-4s in favor of diesels. However, due to the onset of World War II, the railroad was unable to purchase additional diesel locomotives, and so opted to continue to employ the Ps-4s for the duration of the war. After the war, the railroad resumed dieselizing its trains, and the Ps-4s were largely out of service by 1948. Between 1949 and 1953, the Southern had scrapped all but one of the Ps-4s. Preservation Southern Railway Ps-4 No. 1401 on display at the National Museum of American History as part of the Smithsonian's \\"America on the Move\\" exhibition The sole surviving Ps-4 is No. 1401 of the 1926 order, which was saved in 1953 by the railroad's outside legal counsel and later president Graham Claytor, who requested that the locomotive would be donated to the Smithsonian Institution.. In Summer 1961, No. 1401 was placed inside the Smithsonian's newly built National Museum of American History which opened in early 1964. In June 1982, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers designated the locomotive as a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark.. Today, it currently remains on display at the museum..

First published in hardcover on November 13, 2012 by Viking Press it became a New York Times Best Seller. It has received attention from The Washington Post, The New York Times and The New Yorker. Kurzweil describes a series of thought experiments which suggest to him that the brain contains a hierarchy of pattern recognizers. Based on this he introduces his Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM). He says the neocortex contains 300 million very general pattern recognition circuits and argues that they are responsible for most aspects of human thought. He also suggests that the brain is a \\"recursive probabilistic fractal\\" whose line of code is represented within the 30-100 million bytes of compressed code in the genome. Kurzweil then explains that a computer version of this design could be used to create an artificial intelligence more capable than the human brain. It would employ techniques such as hidden Markov models and genetic algorithms, strategies Kurzweil used successfully in his years as a commercial developer of speech recognition software. Artificial brains will require massive computational power, so Kurzweil reviews his law of accelerating returns, which explains how the compounding effects of exponential growth will deliver the necessary hardware in only a few decades. Critics felt the subtitle of the book, The Secret of Human Thought Revealed, overpromises. Some protested that pattern recognition does not explain the \\"depth and nuance\\" of mind including elements like emotion and imagination. Others felt Kurzweil's ideas might be right, but they are not original, pointing to existing work as far back as the 1980s. Yet critics admire Kurzweil's \\"impressive track record\\" and say that his writing is \\"refreshingly clear\\", containing \\"lucid discussions\\" of computing history.  Background  Kurzweil has written several futurology books including The Age of Intelligent Machines (1990), The Age of Spiritual Machines (1999) and The Singularity is Near (2005). In his books he develops the law of accelerating returns. The law is similar to Moore's Law, the persistent doubling in capacity of computer chips, but extended to all \\"human technological advancement, the billions of years of terrestrial evolution\\" and even \\"the entire history of the universe\\". Ray Kurzweil in 2008 Due to the exponential growth in computing technologies predicted by the law, Kurzweil says that by \\"the end of the 2020s\\" computers will have \\"intelligence indistinguishable to biological humans\\". As computational power continues to grow, machine intelligence will represent an ever-larger percentage of total intelligence on the planet. Ultimately it will lead to the Singularity, a merger between biology and technology, which Kurzweil predicts will occur in 2045. He says \\"There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine...\\". Kurzweil himself plans to \\"stick around\\" for the Singularity. He has written two health and nutrition books aimed at living longer, the subtitle of one is \\"Live Long Enough to Live Forever\\". One month after How to Create a Mind was published, Google announced that it had hired Kurzweil to work as Director of Engineering \\"on new projects involving machine learning and language processing\\". Kurzweil said his goal at Google is to \\"create a truly useful AI [artificial intelligence] that will make all of us smarter\\".  Content  = Thought experiments = Kurzweil opens the book by reminding us of the importance of thought experiments in the development of major theories, including evolution and relativity. It's worth noting that Kurzweil sees Darwin as \\"a good contender\\" for the leading scientist of the 19th century. He suggests his own thought experiments related to how the brain thinks and remembers things. For example, he asks the reader to recite the alphabet, but then to recite the alphabet backwards. The difficulty in going backwards suggests \\"our memories are sequential and in order\\". Later he asks the reader to visualize someone he has met only once or twice, the difficulty here suggests \\"there are no images, videos, or sound recordings stored in the brain\\" only sequences of patterns. Eventually he concludes the brain uses a hierarchy of pattern recognizers. = Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind = Kurzweil states that the neocortex contains about 300 million very general pattern recognizers, arranged in a hierarchy. For example, to recognize a written word there might be several pattern recognizers for each different letter stroke: diagonal, horizontal, vertical or curved. The output of these recognizers would feed into higher level pattern recognizers, which look for the pattern of strokes which form a letter. Finally a word-level recognizer uses the output of the letter recognizers. All the while signals feed both \\"forward\\" and \\"backward\\". For example, if a letter is obscured, but the remaining letters strongly indicate a certain word, the word-level recognizer might suggest to the letter-recognizer which letter to look for, and the letter-level would suggest which strokes to look for. Kurzweil also discusses how listening to speech requires similar hierarchical pattern recognizers. Kurzweil's main thesis is that these hierarchical pattern recognizers are used not just for sensing the world, but for nearly all aspects of thought. For example, Kurzweil says memory recall is based on the same patterns that were used when sensing the world in the first place. Kurzweil says that learning is critical to human intelligence. A computer version of the neocortex would initially be like a new born baby, unable to do much. Only through repeated exposure to patterns would it eventually self-organize and become functional. Kurzweil writes extensively about neuroanatomy, of both the neocortex and \\"the old brain\\". He cites recent evidence that interconnections in the neocortex form a grid structure, which suggests to him a common algorithm across \\"all neocortical functions\\". = Digital brain = Example of a hidden Markov model. Kurzweil next writes about creating a digital brain inspired by the biological brain he has been describing. One existing effort he points to is Henry Markram's Blue Brain Project, which is attempting to create a full brain simulation by 2023. Kurzweil says the full molecular modeling they are attempting will be too slow, and that they will have to swap in simplified models to speed up initial self-organization. Kurzweil believes these large scale simulations are valuable, but says a more explicit \\"functional algorithmic model\\" will be required to achieve human levels of intelligence. Kurzweil is unimpressed with neural networks and their potential while he's very bullish on vector quantization, hidden Markov models and genetic algorithms since he used all three successfully in his speech recognition work. Kurzweil equates pattern recognizers in the neocortex with statements in the LISP programming language, which is also hierarchical. He also says his approach is similar to Jeff Hawkins' hierarchical temporal memory, although he feels the hierarchical hidden Markov models have an advantage in pattern detection. Kurzweil touches on some modern applications of advanced AI including Google's self-driving cars, IBM's Watson which beat the best human players at the game Jeopardy!, the Siri personal assistant in the Apple iPhone or its competitor Google Voice Search. He contrasts the hand-coded knowledge of the Douglas Lenat's Cyc project with the automated learning of systems like Google Translate and suggests the best approach is to use a combination of both, which is how IBM's Watson was so effective. Kurzweil says that John Searle's has leveled his \\"Chinese Room\\" objection at Watson, arguing that Watson only manipulates symbols without meaning. Kurzweil thinks the human brain is \\"just\\" doing hierarchical statistical analysis as well. In a section entitled A Strategy for Creating a Mind Kurzweil summarizes how he would put together a digital mind. He would start with a pattern recognizer and arrange for a hierarchy to self-organize using a hierarchical hidden Markov model. All parameters of the system would be optimized using genetic algorithms. He would add in a \\"critical thinking module\\" to scan existing patterns in the background for incompatibilities, to avoid holding inconsistent ideas. Kurzweil says the brain should have access to \\"open questions in every discipline\\" and have the ability to \\"master vast databases\\", something traditional computers are good at. He feels the final digital brain would be \\"as capable as biological ones of effecting changes in the world\\". = Philosophy = A digital brain with human-level intelligence raises many philosophical questions, the first of which is whether it is conscious. Kurzweil feels that consciousness is \\"an emergent property of a complex physical system\\", such that a computer emulating a brain would have the same emergent consciousness as the real brain. This is in contrast to people like John Searle, Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose who believe there is something special about the physical brain that a computer version could not duplicate. Another issue is that of free will, the degree to which people are responsible for their own choices. Free will relates to determinism, if everything is strictly determined by prior state, then some would say that no one can have free will. Kurzweil holds a pragmatic belief in free will because he feels society needs it to function. He also suggests that quantum mechanics may provide \\"a continual source of uncertainty at the most basic level of reality\\" such that determinism does not exist. Exponential Growth of Computing Finally Kurzweil addresses identity with futuristic scenarios involving cloning a nonbiological version of someone, or gradually turning that same person into a nonbiological entity one surgery at a time. In the first case it is tempting to say the clone is not the original person, because the original person still exists. Kurzweil instead concludes both versions are equally the same person. He explains that an advantage of nonbiological systems is \\"the ability to be copied, backed up, and re-created\\" and this is just something people will have to get used to. Kurzweil believes identity \\"is preserved through continuity of the pattern of information that makes us\\" and that humans are not bound to a specific \\"substrate\\" like biology. = Law of accelerating returns = The law of accelerating returns is the basis for all of these speculations about creating a digital brain. It explains why computational capacity will continue to increase unabated even after Moore's Law expires, which Kurzweil predicts will happen around 2020. Integrated circuits, the current method of creating computer chips, will fade from the limelight, while some new more advanced technology will pick up the slack. It is this new technology that will get us to the massive levels of computation needed to create an artificial brain. As exponential progress continues into and beyond the Singularity, Kurzweil says \\"we will merge with the intelligent technology we are creating\\". From there intelligence will expand outward rapidly. Kurzweil even wonders whether the speed of light is really a firm limit to civilization's ability to colonize the universe.  Reception  =Analysis= Simson Garfinkel thinks Kurzweil's \\"pattern recognition theory of mind\\" is not a theory. Simson Garfinkel, an entrepreneur and professor of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School, says Kurzweil's pattern recognition theory of mind (PRTM) is misnamed because of the word \\"theory\\", he feels it is not a theory since it cannot be tested. Garfinkel rejects Kurzweil's one-algorithm approach instead saying \\"the brain is likely to have many more secrets and algorithms than the one Kurzweil describes\\". Garfinkel caricatures Kurzweil's plan for artificial intelligence as \\"build something that can learn, then give it stuff to learn\\", which he thinks is hardly the \\"secret of human thought\\" promised by the subtitle of the book. Gary Marcus, a research psychologist and professor at New York University, says only the name PRTM is new. He says the basic theory behind PRTM is \\"in the spirit of\\" a model of vision known as the neocognitron, introduced in 1980. He also says PRTM even more strongly resembles Hierarchical Temporal Memory promoted by Jeff Hawkins in recent years. Marcus feels any theory like this needs to be proven with an actual working computer model. And to that end he says that \\"a whole slew\\" of machines have been programmed with an approach similar to PRTM, and they have often performed poorly. Colin McGinn, a philosophy professor at the University of Miami, asserted in The New York Review of Books that \\"pattern recognition pertains to perception specifically, not to all mental activity\\". While Kurzweil does say \\"memories are stored as sequences of patterns\\" McGinn asks about \\"emotion, imagination, reasoning, willing, intending, calculating, silently talking to oneself, feeling pain and pleasure, itches, and mood\\" insisting these have nothing to do with pattern recognition. McGinn is also critical of the \\"homunculus language\\" Kurzweil uses, the anthropomorphization of anatomical parts like neurons. Kurzweil will write that a neuron \\"shouts\\" when it \\"sees\\" a pattern, where McGinn would prefer he say a neuron \\"fires\\" when it receives certain stimuli. In McGinn's mind only conscious entities can \\"recognize\\" anything, a bundle of neurons cannot. Finally he takes objection with Kurzweil's \\"law\\" of accelerating change, insisting it is not a law, but just a \\"fortunate historical fact about the twentieth century\\". In 2015, Kurzweil's theory was extended to a Pattern Activation/Recognition Theory of Mind with a stochastic model of self-describing neural circuits. =Reviews= Garfinkel says Kurzweil is at his best with the thought experiments early in the book, but says the \\"warmth and humanitarianism\\" evident in Kurzweil's talks is missing. Marcus applauds Kurzweil for \\"lucid discussion\\" of Alan Turing and John von Neumann and was impressed by his descriptions of computer algorithms and the detailed histories of Kurzweil's own companies. Matthew Feeney, assistant editor for Reason, was disappointed in how briefly Kurzweil dealt with the philosophical aspects of the mind-body problem, and the ethical implications of machines which appear to be conscious. He does say Kurzweil's \\"optimism about an AI-assisted future is contagious.\\" While Drew DeSilver, business reporter at the Seattle Times, says the first half of the book \\"has all the pizazz and drive of an engineering manual\\" but says Kurzweil's description of how the Jeopardy! computer champion Watson worked \\"is eye- opening and refreshingly clear\\". McGinn says the book is \\"interesting in places, fairly readable, moderately informative, but wildly overstated.\\" He mocks the book's subtitle by writing \\"All is revealed!\\" after paraphrasing Kurzweil's pattern recognition theory of mind. Speaking as a philosopher, McGinn feels that Kurzweil is \\"way of out of his depth\\" when discussing Wittgenstein. Matt Ridley, journalist and author, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that Kurzweil \\"has a more impressive track record of predicting technological progress than most\\" and therefore he feels \\"it would be foolish, not wise, to bet against the emulation of the human brain in silicon within a couple of decades\\". =Translations= * Spanish: \\"C√≥mo crear una mente.

She grew up in the rural area of Xalapa, Veracruz with no intentions of becoming a restaurateur. However, when her husband died in 1981, she took over the restaurant he founded and expanded it adding dishes from her native Veracruz and other Mexican states along with the carnitas and barbacoa that he made. Carmen‚Äôs international recognition began when she accompanied her daughter who went abroad to study to become a professional chef. This led to classes, consulting and participation in gastronomic events principally in the United States and Europe. Life Carmen Ram√≠rez Degollado was born in 1940 in Xalapa, Veracruz, a colonial city in the mountains of the state, surrounded by nature and coffee fields. From the colonial period to the 19th century, it was a prosperous city and developed its own variant on Mexican cuisine. She was born Carmen Hern√°ndez Oropeza, but she is professionally known with her late husband‚Äôs last names, as well as the nickname ‚ÄúTitita.‚Äù Carmen was raised traditionally to be a housewife and mother, which included cooking She says that the women of her family, especially her mother and her aunt which raised her, were very industrious both in cooking and sewing. Being traditional, the cooking generally involved traditional cookware such as comals and clay pots. Women were also prominent in the family, as they generally outnumbered the men. She says she was restless as a child. Many of her childhood and adolescent memories involved food, especially the cooking of her mother and other female members of the family as well as the fruits and vegetables that grow in her native state. She remembers going to the local market as a child and being fascinated by it, with its fresh fruits and vegetables and women in indigenous dress. Her mother, Vicenta del Carmen, was raised in the very high mountains of Las Vigas, Veracruz. She gained the name of ‚ÄúTitita‚Äù because she did not like the name Vicenta and the nickname is a play off of it. Her mother married Guillermo Hern√°ndez from Papantla after they met in Xalapa, and the couple divided their time between Xalapa and Papantla. This influenced her mother‚Äôs cooking, which included dishes from her hometown, Xalapa and Papantla. Her father died when she was only five years old. She and her sister Luchi were then raised by her mother, an aunt she called Mama Luz and a nanny by the name of Amparo. Carmen gained the nickname Titita as well, being called ‚ÄúTitita chica‚Äù (Titita junior) as she grew up. As a teen, she was selected to compete in the Miss Red Cross pageant, representing Xalapa in Mexico City. Later, she met her husband Ra√∫l Ram√≠rez Degollado at a party in her honor in Xalapa. They dated for two years before they married in 1957. During the courtship, Carmen remembers meals that they ate at her house prepared by her family. Despite being from a traditional family and surrounded by food, Carmen did not begin to cook until she got married. At that time her nanny Amparo taught her the recipes she and her mother made. After marriage, she first moved with her husband to the city of Veracruz, with her nanny Amparo accompanying them. They then moved to Mexico City because of Ra√∫l‚Äôs career. Carmen remembers that one of her husband‚Äôs many friends was French who wanted nothing more than to be invited to the house to eat her noodle soup. She said this was her first indication that Mexican cooking offered something to the world. When Ra√∫l retired, he bought a restaurant in Azcapotzalco, and when he died, Carmen took over the business. With her husband, Carmen had five children. Her oldest child, Ra√∫l is a mathematician and her other son, Jos√© Guillermo, is a commercial pilot. Her three daughters have worked with the restaurant at some point in their lives. Maricarmen is an administrator of the restaurant chain. Luz Mar√≠a is also in business administration, managing the Azcapotzalco location. Mar√≠a Teresa studied to become a professional chef in England, Canada and San Francisco. She worked for a time as a pastry chef in Spain at the Drolma restaurant in Barcelona, but today owns several pastry shops in Mexico City. El Baj√≠o restaurant In 1972, Carmen‚Äôs husband Ra√∫l retired from the pharmaceutical business and decided to start a restaurant with a friend named Alfonso Hurtado Morell√≥n to make barbacoa and the Michoac√°n style carnitas he knew growing up in Cotija The partners found the Azcapotzalco location for sale, but Carmen was against it because it was far from their San √Ångel home and it was in an industrial part of the city. However, the location was bought with an initial investment of 200,000 pesos. When the restaurant opened, she went to the main market in La Merced every eight days to buy fresh produce, never canned or frozen, a tradition that continues at the restaurant today. Some years later, Ra√∫l was diagnosed with cancer and three years later in 1981, he died, leaving Carmen a widow at age 40 With the support of her family and friends, she took over her husband‚Äôs restaurant. She changed the menu adding items that she had cooked for family and friends for many years as well as dishes that were specialties of her nanny Amparo, who was helping her raise her children. She also hired waiters and trained them in customer service. These included dishes such as mole de olla, gorditas with beans and avocado leaves, seafood dishes and Veracruz style coffee. Over the decades, dishes from other regions in Mexico such as Michoac√°n, Puebla and Oaxaca were also added. In those early days, she got up each morning at 6 am to buy supplies for the restaurant at La Merced. However, she always closed the restaurant at 6pm, so she could take care of her children. She started with fifteen employees, learning the restaurant business on her own, a business long dominated by men in Mexico. She never planned on having a career in the restaurant business, but the changes made the restaurant a success, allowing her to send her children to some of the best private universities in Mexico. In addition to the food, another trademark was the decoration of the restaurant. She is an enthusiast of Mexican art and handcrafts, both of which she used to decorate the Azcapotzalco restaurant, and later in other locations. Motivated by the desire to preserver traditions related to Day of the Dead, she organized a dinner for the press in 1990, inviting journalists and artists, decorating the restaurant for the occasion. This began the tradition of decorating the restaurants for various important Mexican holidays. She also decorates the restaurants for other various major Mexican holidays such as Christmas, Independence Day and the day of the Virgin of Guadalupe . She has also celebrated D√≠a del Ma√≠z (Corn Day) with an altar as she says the plant is divine. The original restaurant is still in an industrial zone in Azcapotzalco. The menu of the restaurant concentrates on dishes from Veracruz, Puebla, Michoac√°n and Oaxaca, but it strongly reflects Carmen‚Äôs Veracruz heritage. Veracruz specialties include gorditas with beans flavored with avocado leaves, puffed gorditas, Papantla style tamales and atole with fresh fruit. One condiment that is unique to the restaurant is salsa negra de chipotle meco (black sauce of meco chipotle pepper) a specialty of her late nanny. Her food has been described as rustic and devoted to tradition. She continues to make carnitas in honor of her late husband. El Baj√≠o remains a traditional location to eat carnitas and barbacoa on weekends. The restaurant attracts both common and distinguished diners as well as tourists from other parts of Mexico and abroad. The restaurant has been visited by some of the best chefs in the world, recommended by food experts such as Diana Kennedy, chef Guillermo Gonz√°lez de Pangela and Ferr√°n Adri√† of El Bulli in Spain says it is the best Mexican restaurant he has ever eaten at. The New York Times called her one of the matriarchs of Mexican cooking, running one of the two best Mexican restaurants in Mexico City. Most of her advertising is word-of mouth. She has befriended much of Mexico‚Äôs artist and artisan communities and her restaurants include the works of Rodolfo Morales, Juan Alc√°zar, Justina Fuentes, Marisa Luisa Guerrero, Carmen Parra, Felipe Ehrenberg, Ofelia Murrieta and many more. Most of her career has been focused on the restaurant in Azcapotzalco with employees who have worked for her since the restaurant opened such as Pablo Solorio and Felix, as well as Sandra Olvera, who started working at the restaurant when she was eleven years old. A number of others have over ten years as employees. At the urging of her children, in 2006, the Baj√≠o name branched out into other areas of Mexico City. Today there are ten locations. The main restaurant has a deep blue and orange scheme, decorated with Mexican art and handcrafts. The other restaurants have similar but distinct decorative schemes. In 2012, Carmen celebrated the 40th anniversary of the opening of the original El Baj√≠o with family and many recognizable friends including Diana Kennedy and chefs such as Guillermo Gonz√°lez Berist√°in, Zahie T√©llez, Federico L√≥pez, Mark Miller and John Bagur. For the occasion, a small cookbook with forty of her soup recipes was created, printed on amate paper. Other gastronomic activities She is considered one of the most important experts on Mexican cuisine, along with Patricia Quintana, Monica Pati√±o and Alicia Gironella. However, she was never trained as a chef and proudly calls herself a ‚Äúcocinera‚Äù (cook) . One of her preoccupations is the preservation of traditional Mexican cooking. She says that the cuisine is much more than a list of typical dishes from the country. It reflects the evolution of Mexico‚Äôs culture and history and has tied Mexican cuisine to the rest of Mexican society and culture both in Mexico and abroad. It is said that there are two kinds of cooks in Mexico, those who take the time to fry noodles before making soup and those who do not. Carmen is described as one who does take that time. She defends traditional cooking and eschews modern conveniences such as microwaves. According to her, it is not a question of romanticizing the past but rather reaffirming Mexican identity. However, Carmen recognizes that much of traditional Mexican cooking, labor-intensive and with long cooking times, is almost a thing of the past as women work jobs along with men. She says she has great respect for the women of areas such as Oaxaca, Veracruz and Michoac√°n who still cook with firewood and charcoal. Carmen is concerned about the loss of varieties of corn, such as blue and red and the introduction of genetically engineered ones. Her work with the restaurant has led to other cultural and gastronomic activities, for example using the restaurant to host charity events. In 1996, El Baj√≠o hosted an exhibition dedicated to the traditional implements used in Mexican cooking, which was inspired by painting of wooden ladles done by Emilio S√°nchez for the restaurant called ‚ÄúCucharadas de color‚Äù (Large colored spoons). In 1997 another exhibition was dedicated to metates (Mesoamerican grinding stones) and petates (palm frond mats). This event was inaugurated with tamales from various regions of Mexico. In 1999, another event was dedicated to the comal and the olla (traditional cooking pot) . Carmen has traveled throughout Mexico and abroad to teach and present traditional Mexican cooking. She began to travel outside of Mexico in 1989 when her daughter began to attend culinary school, which led her to begin participating in various international gastronomic events and activities including the Andaluc√≠a Sabor in Seville in 2009 and the San Sebasti√°n Gastronomika in Spain in 2011. She has given culinary demonstrations and prepared special events in places such as the James Beard Foundation in New York, the Ritz Hotel in Lisbon, the Mana Lani Bay Hotel in Honolulu, The Culinary Institute of America in Napa Valley, the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, the Marriott Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, the Les Dames d‚ÄôEscoffier International in Atlanta and the Hyatt Hotel in Seattle. She taught classes for three years on Mexican cooking at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa Valley and has worked as a consultant for various restaurants in the United States and Europe. She also appeared on the public service announcement series ‚ÄúGot Milk?‚Äù with her episode targeting the Los Angeles area. In 2001, Carmen published Alquimias y atm√≥sferas del sabor, a book dedicated to anecdotes from her life, paying tribute to the various women of her family, including her nanny Amparo, as well as recipes from Veracruz. The book was named the Best Chef Book in Spanish award as an honorary mention in the Best Chef Book in the World category at the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards as well in Paris in 2002. Her recognitions include a Five Star Diamond Award from the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences for the El Baj√≠o restaurant in 1998, regular invitations to participate in the Festival Annual del Centro Hist√≥rico de la Ciudad de Mexico (Annual Festival of the Historic Center of Mexico City), La Llave Empresarial award from AMAIT and ABASTUR in 2006 and 2008 and the CANIRAC entrepreneur prize in 2009. It also includes membership in the Asociaci√≥n Mexicana de Restaurantes and the International Association of Chefs in the United States.

Etymology The name \\"broa\\" or \\"boroa\\" likely comes from Germanic *brauda-, specifically Suebian. This type of bread existed in Gallaecia at least since Suebian times. Prior to the addition of corn to the mixture, the main ingredients of broa were rye and malt. After corn was introduced in Europe from the Americas, \\"broa\\" became widely associated with \\"corn-bread\\". Apart from the similarity of the Portuguese and German words Broa and Brot, there is a strong resemblance between this very traditional Northern Portuguese bread and the German Roggenbrot (rye bread). Some suggest the name 'Broa' could derive instead from the Celtic word *broga- 'limit, field'.  Definition and production  It is a dark brown, very dense bread with a distinctive and intense flavour, bittersweet, made with corn and rye flours. It has a particularly slow manufacturing process: it is baked for about five to six hours in the oven. Once cooked, it is sprinkled with flour. The bread generally has the shape of a bell tower.  Recent history  Nowadays, the bread of Avintes is also produced outside its original parish with industrial source materials The old mills of Avintes no longer have economic relevance. However, for the sake of tradition, the people of Avintes have maintained its crafty production, which is well appreciated by consumers who increasingly seek genuinely traditional products.  The making and eating  Connected to its production are many so-called \\"secrets\\" which, real or not, lay in the certitudes and knowledge gained from experience of many generations of Avintes' bakers as well as the judicious choice of materials used. There are, also, some superstitions related to its mixing and baking, involving prayers and blessings, as indeed in the rest of Portugal when making bread in the old fashioned ways. The \\"br√¥a\\" can also be served fried - for example, during Christmas as part of typical dishes in some of the northerners'homes. It is also used as the basis for multiple meal starters, as, for example \\"Avintes br√¥a with coriander\\". It is also appreciated with ham (preferably, also produced by hand) and with traditional Portuguese \\"caldo-verde\\" or \\"green broth\\" . Every year, since 1988, the village of Avintes hosts the festivities celebrating their \\"br√¥a\\" bread during the last week of August.

She is the founder of Houndstooth Studio and has won more than 250 awards for business, philanthropy and animal photography, including the Best Canine Photographer in Australia in 2011 and 2013. She is the official photographer for the Dogs‚Äô Refuge Home of WA and has been featured in numerous books and magazines as well as the television show The Couch. Career Cearns grew up in South Australia, before moving to Western Australia when she was aged 11. She worked as a police officer, then a crime analyst with the Western Australian Police Service for 14 years. She then spent 5 years auditing airports for the Federal Australian Government. Her photography career started in 2006 after being inspired a year prior on a trip to Tasmania with a friend. She saw her friend using an SLR camera while she was using a film camera. When she returned from her trip, she purchased an SLR camera and multiple lenses. In an interview with Photo Review Magazine, she stated that she planned to photograph many different niches, but found herself taking more photographs of animals than anything else. During a trip to the Cocos Islands in 2007, Cearns took images of blue clams at a breeding facility. She entered the images into different state and national photo contests and won 2 of the contests while placing in 2 others. She opened Houndstooth Studio in 2008 which was named a finalist in the Telstra Business Awards in 2012 and 2013. Cearns' work has been featured in numerous exhibits. One of the most notable was Look Twice, an exhibit featuring 60 photographs of 50 species of animals that she took while on a trip to Bali. The photos included dogs, cats, turtles, snakes, and piglets from the island. In an interview, Cearns stated she became overwhelmed at the neglected animals since she first visited the island in 2010. The exhibit was held on Swan, Alfred Cove in 2012, with proceeds of the sale of the photos going to support the Bali Animal Welfare Association. In 2013, Cearns held another solo exhibit to benefit wildlife, this time in Cambodia. The exhibit, Cambodia Wild, was photographed in Cambodia and included photos of Asian elephants, Indochinese tigers, Sun and Moon bears, and rare otters. The profits from the exhibit went to benefit Free the Bears Fund and Wildlife Alliance. Cearns has appeared in numerous publications and also on television regarding her work. Most notably she has been a regular guest on The Couch, a television show broadcast in Australia and New Zealand. She has been interviewed on the show numerous times, including being a panelist on the show's BitchN segment. In 2013 she conducted a live pet photo session on the show and also was an interviewer herself when she hosted Mary Hutton from Free the Bears Fund. Cearns released her first photo book in 2014. Titled Mother Knows Best: Life Lessons From the Animal World, it featured photos of various animals capturing each one's character. Since the release of her first book, Cearns has gone on to publish 3 more, Joy: A Celebration of the Animal Kingdom (2014), Zen Dogs (2016) and her latest release in 2018, Perfect Imperfection: Dog Portraits of Resilience and Love. She also contributed photographs to the book \\"Things Your Dog Wants You to Know\\" by Laura Vissaritis. Awards and exhibitions Cearns has won numerous awards for her photography. Her first award-winning photograph \\"Blue Clams\\" also received a High Commendation in the ANZANG Nature and Landscape Photographer of the Year Competition and was displayed at the Western Australian Museum in Perth. The photograph was also part of a travelling ANZANG exhibition Australia from December 2008 to February 2009. Cearns was also chosen as a photo contributor for the 2012 book The Divinity of Dogs: True Stories of Miracles Inspired by Man's Best Friend, written by Jennifer Skiff, which has been published in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Italy. =Selected awards= * 2019 Recipient - Order of Australia Medal - For services to the community through charitable organisations. * 2013 Finalist - Pride of Australia Medal 2013 * 2013, 2012 Australian Business Excellence Awards Australia Day Honours List * 2013, 2011 Best Canine Photographer /Artist in Australia ‚Äì National Annual Master Dog Breeders and Associates Dog Owners Choice Awards * 2012, Australian Business Excellence Awards Top 3 * 2012, Australian Business Excellence Awards Top 40 * 2012, Australian Telstra Business Awards Finalist, Micro Business * 2012, Australian Telstra Business Awards Finalist, Peoples Choice * 2012, 10 x BRONZE AWARDS ‚Äì International Aperture Awards Science and Nature Category * 2012, Australian Business Excellence Award ‚Äì Women in Business * 2012, Australian Business Excellence Award ‚Äì Customer Service Excellence * 2011, Australian Telstra Business Awards Finalist, Peoples Choice * 2011, 5 x BRONZE AWARDS ‚Äì International Aperture Awards Science and Nature Category * 2010, Finalist ‚Äì Dogs Life People Pet Awards ‚Äì Outstanding Innovation category * 2009, Highly Commended ‚Äì York Society Photographic Awards, Open Colour Category, Western Australia. * 2009, Winner ‚Äì Fuji Film Showcase, Camera Magazine, Mar‚ÄìApr issue * 2008, Winner ‚Äì Expose Your World Photography Awards, Wildlife Category * 2008, Runner-up ‚Äì Expose Your World Photography Awards, Single Shot Overall * 2008, 3 x BRONZE AWARDS ‚Äì International Aperture Awards Nature Category * 2008, Highly Commended ‚Äì ANZANG (Australia, New Zealand, Antarctic, New Guinea) \\"Underwater\\" category.

In the 2005 film adaptation, they are played by Jaime King. They are blond, dark-eyed femme fatales. They first appeared in The Hard Goodbye, followed by appearances in A Dame to Kill For and And Behind Door Number Three?. The Hard Goodbye One night, Goldie offers sexual services to Marv, and he immediately falls in love with her. They spend the night together, but in the morning Marv wakes up to find Goldie lying in bed next to him, murdered. He hears the sound of the police outside the building, coming for him. He escapes, killing many of the police as he does. Wendy and Gail capture Marv, believing that he killed Goldie. They tie Marv in a chair and try to torture a confession out of him, but he unties himself and Wendy realizes that he is not her sister's murderer. Later they discover that Cardinal Roark used Kevin, a cannibalistic serial killer, to murder Goldie and frame Marv. Wendy and Marv go to the Roark farm, and while Wendy waits in the car, Marv tortures and kills Kevin. Marv finds and kills Cardinal Roark, but is seen doing it by the police. He is sentenced to the electric chair. When Wendy comes to visit him in prison, Marv mistakenly calls her Goldie and apologizes. She answers \\"Call me Goldie\\" and they kiss madly. Later, after several failed attempts, the authorities manage to electrocute Marv. A Dame to Kill For Marv and Dwight McCarthy go to Old Town, place where the twin sisters work. Goldie offers sexual services to Marv and he accepts, and that makes the beginning of \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" storyline. And Behind Door Number Three? This is a short story about Gail and Wendy (who's now wearing Marv's necklace) setting a trap for a man they suspect is 'carving up' girls in Old Town. After Wendy lures him in doors, Gail shoots him in the knee and ties him up. The story ends with Miho coming in to torture him. Film appearance They are portrayed by Jaime King in the 2005 film adaptation as the two twins in the second story in the film The Hard Goodbye. She reprises her role in the 2014 sequel based on A Dame to Kill For. In the former film, they are both blondes and look identical. In the latter film Goldie is shown in full color as a blonde who wears a white dress; Wendy is shown in black-and-white as a blonde who wears a black dress and carries a pistol in an Old West gunbelt (as her role as an Old Town enforcer).

It is a group of structurally homologous proteins, conserved throughout the species as it was identified from plants to mammals. Proteins of this family play important role in host defence, injury and stress. There are four main groups of TIR domain-containing proteins in animals; Toll-like receptors, Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), cytosolic adaptor proteins (such as MyD88 adaptor protein) and insect and nematode Toll. Each of these groups is involved mainly in host defence; Toll receptors are also involved in embryogenesis.  TIR domain  The TIR domain is about 200 amino acids long and consists of 3 conserved boxes and between these boxes there are regions of variable length. If due to some mutation all of the three boxes are damaged, there is no surface expression of the protein. If only boxes one and two are mutated, there is loss of signalling activity. There are also highly conserved regions between the three boxes as well. When the receptor is activated TIR domain recruits downstream cytoplasmic signalization adaptor proteins (such as Myd88 adaptor protein). In addition to its traditional role as a scaffolding protein, the TIR domain can also possess intrinsic enzymatic activity to cleave the metabolite NAD+, as first discovered in the protein SARM1. The ability of TIR domains to consume NAD+ is a primordial function of this protein domain, as many TIR domain-containing proteins from bacteria and archaea can degrade NAD+ into the products nicotinamide and ADP-ribose (ADPR) (or cyclic-ADPR). Immunoglobulin-like domain Ig-like domain is the part of receptor which is located extracellulary. There are minimal homologies in amino acid sequences of Ig- like domains between proteins of IL-1R family but they all show characteristic Ig-fold and two Œ≤-sheets joined together by disulfide bonds which form between cysteine residues. There are differences in number of Ig-like domains between members of IL-1R family. IL-1R signalization After ligand binding, the first step of IL-1R family signalling is oligomerization of TIR domains present on receptors (IL-1R, TLR), coreceptors (IL-1R accessory protein, CD14) and adaptor molecules (MyD88). TIR domain present on receptor creates a heterodimer with TIR domain on accessory protein. This high affinity receptor complex recruits downstream signalling molecules. The signal is transduced by cytoplasmatic kinases (such as IRAKs) and by other adaptors, such as tumor necrosis factor 6 (TRAF6). The final step of signalization is phosphorilation of the inhibitory molecule IkB by IkB kinase complex leading to transcription factor NF-Œ∫B releasing. NF-Œ∫B is translocated into nucleus and by binding DNA intermediates inflammatory, alergic and non-alergic immune response. Interleukin-1 receptor The term interleukin-1 includes IL-1Œ±, IL-1Œ≤ and Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). IL-1Rs are involved in immune host defence and hematopoiesis. IL-1R signalization activates immune response by activation of transcription of IL-1 target genes such as IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, COX-2, IŒ∫BŒ±, IL-1Œ±, IL-1Œ≤, MKP-1. Components of signalization pathway of IL-1R which are involved in cellular response to IL-1 also mediate responses to other cytokines (IL-18 and IL-33), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and many forms of cytotoxic stress. IL-1R functions as a bridge between adaptive and innate immunity. =Interleukin 1 receptor, type I= Type I IL-1R (IL-1RI) also known as CD121a is receptor for IL-1Œ±, IL-1Œ≤ and IL-1RA. IL-1RI signalling is involved in thymocyte proliferation, B cells development, IL-2 and IL-6 production, stress responses, inflammatory responses, sleep regulation and appetite. IL-1RI signalling plays also important role in Th17 development. Studies of human autoimmune diseases such as sclerosis multiplex, Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or autoimmune inflammatory bowel diseases show that defect in IL-1R1 signalling is responsible for Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases. IL-1R signalling is regulated by negative regulators such as inhibitory IL-R1 type II (IL-1RII), soluble IL-1RI and sIL-RII and IL-1Ra. It can be also regulated on the level of downstream signalling molecules by inhibiting recruitment of IRAKs, or by suppression of MyD88 secretion. IL-1R cooperates with receptor accessory protein and both are expressed on T cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. =Interleukin 1 receptor, type II= IL-1RII is predominantly expressed on lymphoid and myeloid cells including monocytes, neutrophils, bone marrow cells, macrophages and B cells, also on T cells and epithelial cells. There are three Ig-like domains located extracellulary and highly homological with IL-1RI. Intracellulary there are 24 amino acid long domains which lack the TIR domain thus it is unable to signal. IL-1RII is a surface receptor able to bind IL-1Œ±, IL-1Œ≤ and IL-1RI. It also forms a soluble form sIL-1RII. It is a decoy receptor ‚Äì it inhibites activity of its ligands. Expression of IL-1RII is regulated by two different distal 5'UTRs and their associated promoter regions. IL-1 receptor accessory protein IL-1RAcP is a second receptor subunit of IL-1RI. By forming a receptor heterodimer with IL-1RI facilitates signalization due to oligomerization of TIR domains of these proteins. IL-1RAcP does not bind IL-1 but it binds IL-1RI through its Ig-like domains 1 and 2 and is necessary for IL-1R1 signalling. In response to stress or acute phase induction, a soluble form of this protein is produced by alternative splicing. IL-1 receptor related protein 2 IL 1 receptor-related protein 2 (IL-1R-rp2) consists of three Ig-like extracellular domains, transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic TIR domain. It was detected in lung, epithelium, brain vaskular cells and in monocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. It activates NF- Œ∫B by binding IL-1œµ.

Dutton graduated from Lindsay High School in Lindsay CA, and was awarded a BSc in Physics from UC Berkeley in 1996. He was awarded his PhD in theoretical physics at Harvard University in 2000. His doctoral advisor was Prof.Lene Hau for his thesis entitled \\"Ultra-slow, stopped, and compressed light in Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates\\" Doctoral Thesis He worked on a number of papers with Hau and Cyrus Behroozi, being amongst the first group to stop light completely. He undertook postdoctoral work at NIST-Gaithersburg with Dr. Charles Clark, prior to becoming a staff physicist at the Naval Research Lab in Washington. He conducted research centred mainly around cold atomic gases, EIT, low light level nonlinear optics, quantum memories, and coherent optical storage. Dutton took a position at Raytheon BBN Technologies Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2007, where his research continued, and he is currently the manager of the Quantum Information Processing (QuIP) group at Raytheon BBN Technologies. QuIP conducts ongoing research, and has facilities in the following areas: * Bits and Waves Lab * Quantum Cryptography * Quantum Sensors * Superconducting Digital Receivers and Coprocessors * Superconducting Qubit Systems In 2011, Dutton and colleagues achieved a breakthrough, recorded in \\"Direct Observation of Coherent Population Trapping in a Superconducting Artificial Atom\\". The paper describes a physics breakthrough that Dutton predicted in a paper he published in 2004. The work establishes a major advance in quantum information technology with the coupling of light and superconductors, and is the first instance of light being able to co-exist with superconductors. Normally light (photons) is absorbed by superconductors, but Dutton's team discovered that applying a second field at a different frequency can be used to prevent this absorption, making the artificial atom effectively transparent. The United States Department of Defense has granted further research monies to this project \\"to create tools and methods that integrate all aspects of the quantum computer\\". Dutton is a prolific researcher with many published papers.

The game was drawn 4‚Äì4. On the way home they stopped for a breather at the Hall Cross on South Parade and decided to continue to play together and chose the name Doncaster Rovers. Jenkins was a constant feature on the teamlist in those early years, frequently named as captain up till January 1884. For the 1882‚àí83 season he was elected team captain as well as club secretary.

The Walls of Seville (Spanish: Murallas de Sevilla) are a series of defensive walls surrounding the Old Town of Seville. The city has been surrounded by walls since the Roman period, and they were maintained and modified throughout the subsequent Visigoth, Islamic and finally Castilian periods. The walls remained intact until the 19th century, when they were partially demolished after the revolution of 1868. Some parts of the walls still exist, especially around the Alc√°zar of Seville and some curtain walls in the barrio de la Macarena. The walls originally had eighteen gates or points of access, four of which survive today: Puerta de la Macarena, Puerta de C√≥rdoba, Postigo del Aceite and Postigo del Alc√°zar. The extant parts of the walls maintain an Almohad appearance, mixed with Classicist air resulting from restorations carried out in the 18th century.  History  = Construction during the Roman Empire = The defensive walls were built in times of Julius Caesar, approximately between the years 68 and 65 BC, when he was quaestor of the city. This new fortification was aimed at replacing the old Carthaginian stockade of logs and mud. The walls were expanded and refined during the rule of his son Augustus due to the growth of the city; these were protected by cyclopean towers. The remains of the materials this stage are only recognizable in the material reused in Caliphate period in the new Walls of the Alc√°zar of Seville. = Expansion in the Islamic period: 9th-12th centuries = Curtain wall in the Alcazar of SevilleThe inscription of the azulejo maintains: City Walls of Islamic period (9th-12th c.), which contains the conductions that in the Christian period supplied water to the Royal Alc√°zar and to the city. Restored by the Planning Department of the City of Seville thanks to the collaboration of Texsa in 1993 . During the Islamic rule, particularly in the year 844, the city was razed by the Vikings, and the walls were burned down. After that the emir Abderram√°n II, fourth Umayyad Emir of C√≥rdoba (822‚Äì852) rebuilt the walls, which were again destroyed by his great grandson Abd-ar-Rahman III, eighth independent emir (912‚Äì929) and first Umayyad caliph of C√≥rdoba (929‚Äì961). In 1023, Abu al-Qasim first King Taifa of Seville (1023‚Äì1042), ordered the walls to be raised again to protect the city from Christian troops, and between the 11th century and 12th century a major expansion that doubled the walled enclosure took place. The defense of the city was extended, widened and strengthened, expanding the space protected by the walls in almost twice its old surface. His successors, aware of the progress achieved over the northern Christian kingdoms in the stage of the reconquista, devoted themselves to strengthening their defenses, resulting in the final enclosure of the walls. The gates of al-Andalusian cities were not built with the road axis but were angled to make it as difficult as possible the siege. Thus, the attackers had to cross several gates and courtyards before entering the city. From the heights defenders fired arrows and poured boiling oil on the attackers.\\"Sevilla oculta: Puerta de C√≥rdoba\\" Culture of Seville = The Walls after the reconquista: 13th-16th centuries = Torre Blanca in the barrio de la Macarena. In this image, seen one of the two postigos opened to promote communication in the intramural area with the new round. After the Christian reconquest of the city by Ferdinand III of Castile in 1248, the Crown of Castile kept the physiognomy of the walls that had been imposed by the Arabs during its construction, and as was usual in the Kingdom of Castile, the successive monarchs swore the privileges of the city at take possession of it in some of its gates, always those of greater social or strategic importance, as symbol of power. In the Puerta de la Macarena swore Isabella I of Castile (1477), Ferdinand II of Aragon (1508), Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and his fianc√©e Isabella of Portugal (1526), and finally Philip IV (1624), while the Puerta de Goles did Philip II (1570), why it was renamed Puerta Real. During the reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor carried out a major refurbishment of the public or royal gates of the Walls to integrate them into the widening promoted by the monarch in the cities and towns, in order to facilitate the transit of such common carriages in the period. These renovations affected the Puerta de Carmona, that the Puerta de la Carne, the Puerta Real, the Puerta del Arenal, the Postigo del Aceite, where Benvenuto Tortello made works in 1572, and Postigo del Carb√≥n, which was moved from the beginning from the calle Santander until the end of it, as happened with the Puerta de Triana, originally on calle Zaragoza, which was transferred in 1585 farther north, at the confluence of that calle with de San Pablo. = Last period before being partially torn down: 17th-19th centuries = Pipes inside the Walls near the Alcazar of Seville Eventually its military function ceased to matter, and began to prevail a protective value against the flooding of Guadalquivir river. It also had a commercial function, because its presence and insulation factor it made in a customs through which it channeled and regulated the access to the city, stipulated with the payment of tariff. Also this surveillance facilitated the collection of important taxes and tributes that applied to the transit of people and goods, among which highlighted the portazgo, the alcabala or gored of the Walls, special tribute existing in Castile for this type of construction; finally it became a sanitary barrier, allowing the disease control. In the 18th century it turn out to bring remodeling in the access gates. Was rebuilt the Puerta del Arenal, was opened a small chapel on the right side of the Postigo del Aceite, where was placed a baroque altarpiece with the image of the Immaculate Conception (patron of barrio del Arenal), work by Pedro Rold√°n; finally it rise the Puerta de San Fernando to the height of the Royal Tobacco Factory. In 1836, during the invasion of Andalusia by Carlist forces, was made a moat with drawbridge near the Puerta de la Macarena in order to strengthen the set; then the Walls were practically intact. From the 1868 revolution began to tear down much of them, primarily due to the growth of the city; escaped the demolition stretches from the Macarena, where still seven square towers and one octagonal, until the Puerta de C√≥rdoba, as well as some sections in the Jardines del Valle and the sector of the Alcazar. Furthermore, the towers Torre Abd el Aziz, Torre de la Plata, Torre del Oro and Torre Blanca are conserved, own of the defenses of the walled enclosure.  Gates and porticoes of access to the city  Puerta de la Macarena next to the Basilica of its name. Puerta de C√≥rdoba, adjacent to the Iglesia de San Hermenegildo. The access to the city was mainly performed by the called postigos and gates, which were of two types: royals or public, and private. The gates had its layered access, as seen on the Puerta de C√≥rdoba, and lacked decoration. Between gates (puertas) and postigos counted the city with 19 accesses: ; Wall city gates Postigo del Aceite. * Puerta de la Almenilla, of Almoravid origin was constantly reformed; also called Puerta de la Barqueta, it was in the calle Calatrava, in the plazoleta del Blanquillo. * Puerta del Arenal, of Almoravid origin and rebuilt in the 16th century and in the 18th century; It was located at the calle Castelar with the calle Garc√≠a de Vinuesa. * Puerta de Carmona, of Almoravid origin, completely renovated in the 16th century and demolished in 1868; was located at the corner of the calles de San Esteban with Men√©ndez Pelayo.Attached to this gate was the aqueduct known as Ca√±os de Carmona. * Puerta de la Carne, of Almoravid origin and completely renovated in the 16th century; it was in the calle Men√©ndez Pelayo, up to calle Santa Mar√≠a la Blanca. * Puerta de C√≥rdoba, of Almoravid origin and reformed in the 16th century; located opposite the Convento de los Capuchinos, it is one that best preserved the original arrangement. * Puerta de Jerez, of Caliphate origin; It was located at the west end of the calle de San Gregorio, towards the river. It had engraved some allusive verses to the history of the city.On the entrance arch and in Latin prayed: Hercules built me, Julius Caesar besieged me of walls and high towers, and the Saint King won me with Garci P√©rez de Vargas. * Puerta de la Macarena, of Almoravid origin and renovated in the 18th century; located opposite the Bas√≠lica de La Macarena. * Puerta Osario, of Almoravid origin, it was located between calles Valle and Pu√±onrostro. * Puerta Real, of Almoravid origin and rebuilt in the 16th century, also called Puerta de Goles; It was in the corner of the calle Goles with the calle Alfonso XII. * Puerta de San Fernando, built in the 18th century it was the most modern; It was located at the height of the Royal Tobacco Factory. * Puerta de San Juan, of Almoravid origin; It was located on the calle Guadalquivir, between the calle San Vicente and Torneo. * Puerta del Sol, of Almoravid origin and reformed in the 16th century; it was located at the end of the calle Sol, and its name comes from the sun that had engraved on the lintel. * Puerta de Triana, of Almoravid origin and rebuilt in 1585 further north, was torn down in 1868; It was in the current calle Zaragoza, at the confluence with the calle Morat√≠n, where today is indicated. ;Postigos (secondaries wall city gates) * Postigo del Aceite, of Almoravid origin and very reformed; well known for being the place where it entered the oil; It is near the Correos building. * Postigo del Alc√°zar, of Almohad origin, replaced the Caliphate tower-gate; It was also known as postigo de la Torre del Agua, del callej√≥n de la Juder√≠a or de la huerta del Retiro. It is located in the calle Juder√≠a. * Postigo del Carb√≥n, of Almoravid origin, it moved in the 16th century from beginning to end of the calle Santander, formerly known as del Carb√≥n, that took the name . * Postigo de la Feria, also called postigo de la Basura, it was at the end of the calle Feria, corner of calle B√©cquer. * Postigo del Jab√≥n, located in the vicinity of the calle Tintes.

The theory of Phoenician discovery of the Americas suggests that the earliest Old World contact with the Americas was not with Columbus or Norse settlers, but with the Phoenicians (or, alternatively, other Semitic peoples) in the first millennium BC. The petroglyphs on Dighton Rock Background In the late 18th century, a number of people speculated on the origins of the petroglyphs on Dighton Rock in Berkley, Massachusetts. Ezra Stiles, then President of Yale College, believed them to be Hebrew. Antoine Court de G√©belin argued in Le Monde primitif (\\"The primeval World\\") that they commemorated an ancient visit to the East Coast by a group of sailors from Carthage (modern-day Tunisia). In the 19th century, belief in an Israelite visit to the Americas became a part of Mormonism. Ross T. Christensen has propounded the theory that the Mulekites in the Book of Mormon were \\"largely Phoenician in their ethnic origin.\\" In his 1871 book Ancient America, John Denison Baldwin repeats some of the arguments given for Phoenician visits to America, but concludes that: > if it were true that the civilization found in Mexico and Central America > came from people of the Phoenician race, it would be true also that they > built in America as they never built any where else, that they established a > language here radically unlike their own, and that they used a style of > writing totally different from that which they carried into every other > region occupied by their colonies. All the forms of alphabetical writing > used at present in Europe and Southwestern Asia came directly or indirectly > from that anciently invented by the race to which the Phoenicians belonged, > and they have traces of a common relationship which can easily be detected. > Now the writing of the inscriptions at Palenque, Copan, and elsewhere in the > ruins has no more relatedness to the Phoenician than to the Chinese writing. > It has not a single characteristic that can be called Phoenician any more > than the language of the inscriptions or the style of architecture with > which it is associated; therefore we can not reasonably suppose this > American civilization was originated by people of the Phoenician race. Possible artifacts In 1872, a stone inscribed with Phoenician writing was allegedly discovered in Para√≠ba, Brazil.The \\"Paraiba inscription\\" made the pages of Life, 10 June 1968 with commentary by Cyrus H. Gordon. It tells of a Phoenician ship which, due to a storm, was separated from a fleet sailing from Egypt around Africa; it also mentions the pharaoh Necho I or Necho II. A transcription was shown to Ladislau de Souza Mello Netto, director of the National Museum of Brazil. Netto first accepted the inscription as genuine, but by 1873, philologist Ernest Renan convinced him that it was a forgery. Its letter forms vary from those that occurred and disappeared over a span of 800 years; such confluence in a single piece of writing implies that it was a forgery. No scholar ever saw the stone or located its source, and during 1873‚Äì74 Netto tried and failed to find the individual who had supplied the copy of the inscription. In the 1960s, Cyrus H. Gordon provided a new translation, and stated his conclusion that it was genuine, since it didn't copy any Semitic writing that would have been widely accessible at the time.Gordon, Cyrus H., \\"The Canaanite Text from Brazil\\", Orientalia, No. 37, 1968, pp. 425-436. Frank Moore Cross disagreed, saying that \\"Everything in the inscription was available to the forger in nineteenth century handbooks or from uninspired guesses based on these easily available sources,\\" and clarified that the letter forms cover a range of ten centuries. Lithograph of the Bat Creek inscription, which Cyrus H. Gordon believed to be Paleo-Hebrew Gordon also believed that ancient Hebrew inscriptions had been found at two sites in the southeastern United States, indicating that Jews had arrived there before Columbus. One of these supposed finds was the Bat Creek inscription, which Gordon believed to be Paleo-Hebrew, but is generally thought to be a forgery.Robert C. Mainfort, Jr., and Mary L. Kwas, \\"The Bat Creek Stone: Judeans In Tennessee?\\" Tennessee Anthropologist Vol. XVI, No. 1, Spring 1991 Another find which has been claimed as supporting the theory of Semitic discovery of the Americas is the Los Lunas Decalogue Stone, which has also been dismissed as a fake. Modern theories In the 20th century, adherents have included Cyrus H. Gordon, John Philip Cohane, Ross T. Christensen, Barry Fell and Mark McMenamin. In 1996, McMenamin proposed that Phoenician sailors discovered the New World c. 350 BC.Scott, J. M. 2005. Geography in Early Judaism and Christianity. Cambridge University Press, pp. 182‚Äì183. The Phoenician state of Carthage minted gold staters in 350 BC bearing a pattern in the reverse exergue of the coins, which McMenamin interpreted as a map of the Mediterranean with the Americas shown to the west across the Atlantic.McMenamin, M. A. 1997. The Phoenician World Map. Mercator's World 2(3): 46‚Äì51. McMenamin later demonstrated that these coins found in America were modern forgeries. Lucio Russo has speculated about a probable arrival of Phoenicians in the Americas in his philologic analyses of Ptolemy's Geography. In his book Ptolemy gives the coordinates of the Fortunate Isles but at the same time he shrinks the size of the world by one third compared to the size measured by Eratosthenes.(in Italian) Russo observes that by attributing those coordinates to the Antilles, the world gets back to the right size, the geographical description given by Ptolemy fits much better and certain puzzling deformations in Ptolemy's world map disappear. Russo argues that the Antilles coordinates must have been known to Ptolemy's source, Hipparchus. Hipparchus lived in Rhodes and may have gotten this information from Phoenicians sailors, since they had full control of the western Mediterranean in those times. Scholarly assessment Marshall B. McKusick, Professor of Anthropology and former Iowa state archaeologist, reviewed and dismissed various theories of Phoenicians or Canaanites in the New World; he observed that \\"in this modern day everyone wishes to be his own authority, and the personal search for cultural alternatives seems to make every idea or theory equal in value.\\"McCusick, Marshall. \\"Canaanites in America\\" A New Scripture in Stone?\\" The Biblical Archaeologist 42.3 (Summer 1979), pp137ff. Glenn Markoe says that it will \\"probably never be known\\" whether the Phoenicians ever reached the Americas. He remarks, > Proof in the form of an inscription, like the celebrated Phoenician text > allegedly found in Para√≠ba in northern Brazil, remains unlikely. The latter, > which recounts the landing of a storm-driven party from Sidon, has long been > recognized as a clever forgery. If such a fateful expedition had actually > occurred, the proof is more likely to be found in a handful of Phoenician > pottery shards. Ronald H. Fritze discusses the history of such claims from the 17th to the 20th centuries, concluding that although technically possible, > ... no archaeological evidence has yet been discovered to prove the > contentions of Irwin, Gordon, Bailey, Fell and others.

It was declared Bien de Inter√©s Cultural in 1911Torre de El Salvador (Teruel, TERUEL). It has been included in a World Heritage Site, originally called \\"Mudejar Architecture of Teruel\\" and later extended. It is believed that the mud√©jar Tower of El Salvador may have been built during the first quarter of the XIVth century based on the judges' account in the writings known as the Libro Verde de Teruel. Its more elaborate decoration and details, together with a more evolved structure than that of San Mart√≠n Tower, which it imitates, leads us to regard it as the more recent of the two (that is to say, after 1315-1316). High rising amid the Calle de El Salvador's neighbouring buildings, the tower is positioned connected to the baroque church of El Salvador, whose early structure fell apart in 1677. Within the city walls, El Salvador was placed just a few meters from the Portal of Guadalaviar. ts interior houses the Centro de Interpretaci√≥n del Mud√©jar (Center for the Interpretation of the Mud√©jar Style) and it is open to visitors. It is advisable to visit it, since it offers one of the scarce opportunities that we have to look at the interior structure of Aragonese Mud√©jar towers.

It consisted of an gravel runway aligned 01‚Äì19 (roughly north‚Äìsouth) and had a simple terminal building. Construction of the airport was started a local aviation club in 1972 and was completed with a runway in May 1973. The runway was extended the following year and in 1976 the airport was municipalized. From the start Norving operated air taxi and air ambulance flights. Following an upgraded terminal in 1978, the taxi services became scheduled and the Britten-Norman Islander was introduced to Kirkenes and Vads√∏. From 1983 the Dornier Do 228 entered service on the B√•tsfjord route. Wider√∏e took over the route with its de Havilland Canada Twin Otter in 1990. From 1993 Wider√∏e started replacing these with the larger de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft, but had to keep one Twin Otter in operation past 1995 because it could not land on the gravel runway at B√•tsfjord. To allow for Dash 8 services, a new airport was built further up in the valley. It opened on 9 September 1999, the same day the old airport was closed. History Varangfly, later renamed Norving, was the first airline to operate regularly to B√•tsfjord. Using seaplanes they flew both air taxi and air ambulance services to Kirkenes, starting in the 1960s.Melling: 39 The regular services were terminated in 1963 with the opening of Kirkenes Airport, H√∏ybuktmoen.Melling: 41 Varangfly applied to the government for concession and subsidies to operate to B√•tsfjord,Melling: 43 but the application was rejected.Melling: 45 In 1964 Varangfly took initiative to develop plans for a small airfield in B√•tsfjord and several other villages in Finnmark.Melling: 51 This was followed up by the regional authorities; a Finnmark County Council- appointed committee published a report in 1966 recommending B√•tsfjord as one of six regional airports in Finnmark. As the county had the lowest priority on the state-financed construction of regional airports, there were many locals who called for an intermediate solution with locally financed and simpler airfields.Melling: 64 B√•tsfjord was considered for inclusion in the state- financed regional network, but skipped when it proved difficult to find a suitable location. The aviation club B√•tsfjord Flyklubb was established to build an airfield. The club was able to secure sufficient funding to start construction in 1972. The airport opened in May 1973 with a gravel runway, which was extended to the following year. The aviation club was initially responsible for operations in cooperation with the municipality and Norving. Although the airport was initially planned mainly to serve air ambulance flights, Norving also started air taxi services.Melling: 101 The airport lost money on operations and struggled to cover its costs. Flights were flown on basis of customer ordered, at the times specified by the customers. This meant that to get reasonable prices a group would have to book a flight together.Melling: 102 In 1975 the airline had 700 flights to the airport and transported 4000 passengers. From 1 January 1976 ownership and operations of the airport was taken over by the municipality. Planning of scheduled flights began following the municipalization. The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) was skeptical to such operations, citing the terrain hindrances by the location in the valley of B√•tsfjorddalen. Permission was granted following municipal investments of NOK 2.5 million and Norving could start scheduled flights in 1978 with their eight-passenger Britten-Norman Islanders. B√•tsfjord was the first airport in Norway to be designated as a route taxi airport.Melling: 103 From 10 September Norving introduced a twice-daily scheduled service to Kirkenes. Norving introduced the 16 to 19-passenger Dornier Do 228 on the B√•tsfjord run from 1983.Melling: 210 After the airline fell into financial difficulties, negotiations between it, Wider√∏e and the government were initiated regarding subsidies for the route. In November 1988 Norving was offered 10 million Norwegian krone (NOK) in annual grants for the flights to B√•tsfjord and Hasvik Airport, but this was insufficient to save the airline.Melling: 284 On 2 February 1990 the ministry announced that Wider√∏e would take over all subsidized routes in Finnmark, including B√•tsfjord.Melling: 303 They initially flew to the airport using their Twin Otters. The Ministry of Transport and Communications announced in February 1993 that they were considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the CAA. Along with Hasvik Airport and Vard√∏ Airport, Svartnes, B√•tsfjord Airport was one of three regional airports in Finnmark with government-subsidized routes which did not receive state operating grants. In December Wider√∏e articulated that B√•tsfjord Airport did not meet the demands for future operation as it lacked proper instruments and did not have an asphalt runway. Wider√∏e stated that with the introduction of the Dash 8 they would no longer be able to serve the airport. The CAA stated that instead the a new airport should be built, estimated to cost between NOK 70 and 80 million. The main reason was that the old airport was poorly located in relation to the terrain. In April 1994 the ministry stated that they were considering closing many of the smallest regional airports, including B√•tsfjord. The nearest other airport Berlev√•g Airport is located only 39 km away by air, but much longer by road, and the road is often closed to snowstorms in the winter. The various propositions culminated in April 1995 when Parliament decided to nationalize twenty-six regional airports owned by their respective municipalities. The considerations included a proposal to build a new airport. At the time Wider√∏e was obliged to operate routes to the airport until 31 March 1997. In December 1995 Wider√∏e took delivery of their fifteenth Dash 8 and thus their only need for a Twin Otter was to serve B√•tsfjord. The government through the CAA took over ownership of the airport on 1 January 1997. Construction of a new airport cost NOK 178 million and was opened on 9 September 1999, the same day as the old airport closed. Facilities Located in B√•tsfjorddalen, the airport had an gravel runway, aligned 01‚Äì19 at an elevation of . The airport terminal consisted of a single small building with an integrated control tower. The departure area had seven seats and all baggage handling took place outdoors. In 1994 the airport served 12,000 passengers.

She married Rock Scully in 1974, but they separated and divorced the following year. Scully's brother has subsequently expressed doubts about the legality of the union, which Scully misrepresented to his common-law wife as a green card marriage. Sources gave different dates for these divorces.  Roger Waters  After her divorce from Scully, Christie married Roger Waters, the bass player of the English rock band Pink Floyd; this was his second marriage. Their wedding cake was a gift from her friend, Sarah Ferguson, later Duchess of York. They had two children, Harry (born 16 November 1976), a keyboard player in his father's band as well as other bands, and India Rose (born 25 April 1978), a model, before divorcing in 1992. The two-part song \\"Pigs on the Wing\\" on Pink Floyd's Animals album is a love song from Waters for Christie, and a hidden message in the song \\"Empty Spaces\\", on the follow-up album The Wall, refers to her. It was Christie's suggestion that Bob Ezrin be asked to produce the latter album. Waters employed Christie's brother Willie to take photographs for the cover of his last album with Pink Floyd, The Final Cut, and to direct the accompanying short film.

On account of his zeal for the Reformation, Robert was recommended for the office of Chief BaronBall p.209 in 1570, on the death of James Bathe. Robert wrote personally to the Queen's most trusted advisor William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, arguing his case for becoming Chief Baron on the grounds of his long and faithful service to the Crown. He had a formidable group of supporters, including Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin, Hugh Brady, Bishop of Meath, and the Queen's cousin Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde ;The Irish Genealogist Vol.5 pp.596-7 but against their pleas he was passed over by Elizabeth in favour of Sir Lucas Dillon, James Bathe's son-in-law, despite Dillon's known inclination to the Roman Catholic faith.

In such a system, the decryption of a ciphertext is possible only if the set of attributes of the user key matches the attributes of the ciphertext. A crucial security aspect of attribute-based encryption is collusion-resistance: An adversary that holds multiple keys should only be able to access data if at least one individual key grants access. History The concept of attribute- based encryption was first proposed by Amit Sahai and Brent Waters Amit Sahai and Brent Waters, Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2004/086 (2004) and later by Vipul Goyal, Omkant Pandey, Amit Sahai and Brent Waters.Vipul Goyal, Omkant Pandey, Amit Sahai and Brent Waters, Attribute-Based Encryption for Fine-Grained Access Control of Encrypted Data ACM CCS (2006) Recently, several researchers have further proposed Attribute- based encryption with multiple authorities who jointly generate users' private keys.Melissa Chase, Multi-authority Attribute-Based Encryption TCC (2007)Melissa Chase and Sherman S.M.

Korean Math. Soc. 46 (2009)  Types of attribute-based encryption schemes  There are mainly two types of attribute- based encryption schemes: Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE). In KP-ABE, users' secret keys are generated based on an access tree that defines the privileges scope of the concerned user, and data are encrypted over a set of attributes. However, CP-ABE uses access trees to encrypt data and users' secret keys are generated over a set of attributes. Usage Attribute-based encryption (ABE) can be used for log encryption.Vipul Goyal, Omkant Pandey, Amit Sahai and Brent Waters, Attribute-Based Encryption for Fine-Grained Access Control of Encrypted Data Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2006/309 (2006) Instead of encrypting each part of a log with the keys of all recipients, it is possible to encrypt the log only with attributes which match recipients' attributes. This primitive can also be used for broadcast encryption in order to decrease the number of keys used.David Lubicz and Thomas Sirvent, Attribute-Based Broadcast Encryption Scheme Made Efficient First International Conference on Cryptology in Africa (2008) Attribute-based encryption methods are also widely employed in vector-driven search engine interfaces. =Challenges= Although ABE concept is very powerful and a promising mechanism, ABE systems suffer mainly from two drawbacks: non-efficiency and non-existence of attribute revocation mechanism. Other main challenges are: * Key coordination * Key escrow * Key revocation Attribute revocation mechanism Revocation of users in cryptosystems is a well-studied but nontrivial problem. Revocation is even more challenging in attribute-based systems, given that each attribute possibly belongs to multiple different users, whereas in traditional PKI systems public/private key pairs are uniquely associated with a single user. In principle, in an ABE system, attributes, not users or keys, are revoked. The following paragraph now discusses how the revocation feature can be incorporated. A simple but constrained solution is to include a time attribute. This solution would require each message to be encrypted with a modified access tree , which is constructed by augmenting the original access tree with an additional time attribute. The time attribute, represents the current ‚Äòtime period‚Äô. Formally, the new access structure is as follows: . For example, can be the ‚Äòdate‚Äô attribute whose value changes once every day. It is assumed that each non-revoked user receives his fresh private keys corresponding to the ‚Äòdate‚Äô attribute once each day directly from the mobile key server MKS (which is the central authority) or via the regional delegates. With a hierarchical access structure, the key delegation property of CP-ABE can be exploited to reduce the dependency on the central authority for issuing the new private keys to all users every time interval. There are significant trade-offs between the extra load incurred by the authority for generating and communicating the new keys to the users and the amount of time that can elapse before a revoked user can be effectively purged. This above solution has the following problems: # Each user X needs to periodically receive from the central authority the fresh private key corresponding to the time attribute, otherwise X will not be able to decrypt any message. # It is a lazy revocation technique the revoked user is not purged from the system until the current time period expires. # This scheme requires an implicit time synchronization (a loose time synchronization may be sufficient) among the authority and the users. Other concepts called 'attribute-based encryption' A manuscript of Ari Juels and Michael SzydloAri Jules and Michael Szydlo, Attribute-Based Encryption: Using Identity-Based Encryption for Access Control Manuscript (2004) dated 2004 proposed a different, non-collusion-resistant notion of attribute-based encryption.

Background The region of Upper Hungary was considered to be an appanage principality, and it was usually managed by the heir of Hungarian throne, or by a brother of the reigning king. This territory would be administrated from the city of Pozsony (, today's Bratislava). After peace treaty of Vasv√°r was signed in 1664, loyalty felt by Hungarians towards Habsburg dynasty was in decline. Imperial administration acted against interests of the Hungarian estates. In 1671 a rebellion was successfully thwarted. However, a year later Mih√°ly Teleki led a more successful rebellion. In 1680 Imre Th√∂k√∂ly became the leading figure of the rebellion. These rebellions were supported and sustained by the Ottoman state and the Principality of Transylvania. Establishment and later history The principality was established on 19 November 1682.J.

Founded in 1991, the 350-employee company primarily transports large-scale industrial and transportation equipment as well as rigging. They also coordinate smaller-scale moves of precise manufacturing equipment.  History  Morgan Industrial was founded in 1991 in North Plains, Oregon, by Joe Morgan where the majority of its business came from Intel Corporation in nearby Hillsboro. The company purchased Omega Rigging, based in Tacoma, Washington, in 2003 and used it to launch its heavy transport work. Jeff Morgan became the company‚Äôs CEO in 2004. The company announced in 2010 they would likely add 150 employees during construction of Intel‚Äôs D1X facility, which was on top of the 100 employees already working on projects for Intel. In 2011, the company renamed itself as Omega Morgan. At the time the company had grown to 275 employees and had revenues of $42 million in 2010 and had an office in Fife, Washington, along with the headquarters in Hillsboro. Omega Morgan headquarters - Hillsboro, Oregon John McCalla became the company's CEO in December 2011, replacing Jeff Morgan. At that time Riverlake Partners had taken majority ownership of the company for an undisclosed amount. The investment by Riverlake was hoped to allow the company to grow to annual revenues of $100 million within a few years. Move of the Sellwood Bridge Omega Morgan hauled the Canby Ferry to Portland in April 2012 due to the closure of the Willamette Falls Locks. Also in 2012, the company started an office in Phoenix, Arizona. In January 2013, the company moved the main section of the Sellwood Bridge in Portland, Oregon, as part of the construction project to replace the bridge. The move allowed for the old bridge section to be used as a detour route while the new bridge was constructed adjacent to the old span. Omega Morgan used jacks and skids to move the section, as well as Dawn dish-washing detergent as a lubricant. In August 2013, the company began hauling oversized loads to the Canadian tar sands. While the route through Idaho was approved by Idaho's Department of Transportation, environmental groups and tribal leaders protested part of the Idaho portion of the route on U.S. Route 12 that crossed tribal lands and traveled along the Clearwater River. The protests slowed the load, but the shipment later arrived in Montana. In September 2013, they moved the replacement span into place as part of the repairs to the Skagit River bridge in Washington.  Notable moves  On January 19, 2013, Omega Morgan, working with Multnomah County government, moved the 6.8-million pound Sellwood Bridge from its current location onto new pylons. To match the newly built onramps, the bridge was moved 66 feet on its west end and 33 feet on its east end.

The mature grasshopper has canary yellow and turquoise stripes on its body, green tegmina with yellow spots, and pale red hind wings. It changes its outward appearance by molting. Habits The grasshopper feeds on the poisonous plant Calotropis gigantea. Upon slight pinching of the head or abdomen, the half-grown immature form ejects liquid in a sharp and sudden jet, with a range of two inches or more, from a dorsal opening between the first and second abdominal segments. The discharge is directed towards the pinched area and may be repeated several times.

(, in some sources –õ–∞–¥—ãÃÅ–∂–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π (); ‚Äì ) was a Russian religious philosopher, playwright, and statesman, best known for his Mystical Trilogy comprising Super-consciousness and the Ways to Achieve It, Light Invisible, and Dark Force. Biography Lodyzhensky was born on February 27, 1852 near Tula in the Russian Empire. He was the son of Vasily Vasilyevich and Olga Alekseyevna Lodyzhensky. Descended from a long line of Russian nobility, he was the distant relative of composer Nikolai Lodyzhensky. He had a religious upbringing and most of his immediate family‚Äîhis father, mother, and three of his four sisters‚Äîall became monastics. In 1873, Lodyzhensky graduated from the St. Petersburg Agricultural Institute. He served as a senior forester with the new Forestry Department of Vologda Governorate. In Tula, he was a land captain (overseer) of the Chernsky District. In 1881, he married his wife Olga Pavlovna (or Aleksandrovna according to some sources), which resulted in a happy marriage of over thirty years. (Lodyzhensky rose through the ranks of the Forestry Department, becoming its head from 1884‚Äì1886. He then consecutively served as lieutenant governor of several regions: Semipalatinsk (1896‚Äì1898), Vitebsk, and Mogilev. Through his years of public service, Lodyzhensky eventually reached the rank of state counsellor and was awarded with the Order of St. Vladimir (3rd and 4th class), the Order of St. Stanislaus (2nd and 3rd class), and the Order of St. Anna (3rd class). Nevertheless, he always had financial difficulties and was forced to apply for a pension from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. After retirement, he and his wife traveled the world, going to India, Egypt, and Japan. He also took up literary work, writing several plays‚ÄîIz novenkikh (Brand New) and Lozhny vzglyad (False View)‚Äîwhich performed well at the Russian Dramatic Theatre in Moscow. Lodyzhensky‚Äôs main interest, however, was in mysticism and esotericism, especially Theosophy. He was a member and secretary of the Russian Theosophical Society, and friends with the esotericist P.D. Ouspensky. Like Helena Blavatsky, Lev Tikhomirov, and other contemporary thinkers, he attempted to synthesize philosophy, religion, and mysticism into a unified way of life. He was familiar with the Hindu yogic tradition, drawing a parallel between it and Eastern Orthodox mysticism with the implicit belief that they were essentially the same. At a November 1909 meeting of the St. Petersburg Religious-Philosophical Society dedicated to Theosophy, Lodyzhensky declared, ‚ÄúIt is possible to be a true Christian and a true Theosophist.‚Äù However, he later became convinced of the inherent incompatibility of Theosophy with Christianity, and reaffirmed his Russian Orthodox faith. His magnum opus, the Mystical Trilogy, which examines the differences between Eastern Orthodoxy and other mystical traditions, reflects this shift in views. The books were well received. In their reviews of Light Invisible, Bishop Nikon (Bessonov) of Yenisei-Krasnoyarsk highly recommended it, and Sergei Glagolev of the Moscow Theological Academy (despite some reservations) states that Lodyzhensky ‚Äúsimply, clearly, and convincingly established the apologetical significance of mystical phenomena from an Orthodox perspective.‚Äù In the summer of 1910, Lodyzhensky and his wife Olga stayed in the village of Basovo, which was located only a few miles from Yasnaya Polyana, the estate of the writer Leo Tolstoy. The Lodyzhenskys called upon Tolstoy in late July. The composer Alexander Goldenweiser, one of Tolstoy‚Äôs close friends, refers to Lodyzhensky as ‚Äúvery loud and talkative,‚Äù and Sofia Tolstoy, the author‚Äôs wife, describes the Lodyzhenskys as ‚Äúinteresting, lively people.‚Äù Lodyzhensky and Tolstoy spoke about yoga, hypnotism, Theosophy, and Christian asceticism, introducing him to the Philokalia, one of the principal collections of spiritual texts for the Eastern Orthodox Church. A few days later, Tolstoy visited Lodyzhensky to continue the discussion on the Philokalia. This was their last meeting; Tolstoy died not long afterward.For Lodyzhensky‚Äôs account of his interactions with Tolstoy, see Light Invisible, pp. 157ff. In his later years, Lodyzhensky continued to write, collaborating with the St. Petersburg journal Veshnie vody (Spring Waters) and publishing his last work, Nevidimye volny (Invisible Waves), in 1917. Lodyzhensky died on May 31, 1917. He is buried with his wife Olga at the cemetery of the now-defunct Dormition Convent in Tula.

He was born in Manhattan and raised in New Jersey, studied English literature and journalism at Lehigh University, and graduated from the MA program at Fordham University. He is the editor of PANK and At Large Magazine, and a lecturer of Latino literature and creative writing at Baruch College, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and Pace University, while serving on faculty at Yale University's Yale Writers' Workshop and the Hudson Valley Writers' Center. From 2014‚Äì2016, along with Puerto Rican novelist Jonathan Marcantoni, he ran the YouNiversity, a non- profit digital workshop that provided students access to and experience with the publishing industry through media professionals in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and Africa. Unlike the curriculum and objectives of many MFA programs across the United States, the YouNiversity focused on several different facets of a writer's literary development, including real- time interaction with editors, literary agents, graphic artists, publishers, and other readers and writers.  Style and Influence  Campanioni's work is affiliated with the Latin American neo-Surrealists along with Brion Gysin and his cut-up technique. While also influenced by the historic avant-garde (Dada, et al.), the coterie that haunts his first trilogy of novels is the Situationist International.  Reactions  His hybrid nonfiction/poetry book Death of Art (C&R; Press, 2016) was celebrated as \\"bringing surprise and joy back to Conceptual writing\\" and \\"a striking amalgamation of memoir and social critique, poetry and cultural theory.\\" His poem \\"Transport (after 'When Ecstasy is Inconvenient')\\" was a finalist for the Z√≥calo Public Square Poetry Prize in 2015, awarded annually to the U.S. poet whose poem best evokes a connection to place. In March 2014, Campanioni became the youngest finalist for the International Latino Book Awards when Going Down was selected as Best Debut Novel. Minor Literature[s] 2015 review of Campanioni's recent work focused on his parents' immigrant past and his own dislocated present, asserting that his poetry had found ways to re-evaluate technology as a conduit for connection and learning, especially linguistically. The New York Post named Going Down one of its \\"must-read books\\" of the month in October 2013. Going Down has been lauded by various media, including the Manhattan Times, for its realistic portrayal of the newsroom and the fashion industry from the Latino perspective. The novel has also garnered criticism for its dark tone and confusing meta-fiction writing style. In the spring of 2013, Campanioni was awarded an Academy of American Poets College Prize for selected poetry. From Susan L. Miller and the Academy of American Poets committee: \\"Campanioni immediately draws the reader in with a sharp sensibility for the music of language. 'Forty faces, one line' demonstrates an aptitude for poetic structure as well as a contemporary sense of rhyme, and 'Billboards' focuses first in a prose-poem, then in quatrains, on the contrast between the self commodified and the loneliness of the soul inside of the commodified body. By focusing outside and inside the self in refreshing ways, Campanioni offers us meditations on 'body and soul' that include the elegant woman who‚Äôs dropped her dentures as well as the child yearning to eat cake. The poem 'Endnotes for Life' takes familiar territory (the story of Lot‚Äôs wife, the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, and the personal narrative) and makes a structure for it that calls into question the primacy of narrative in much American poetry. These sharp views of the human theater force us to examine our place in it, and to question what more exists in our own internal worlds.\\" His poetry, fiction, and nonfiction has been published in 3:AM Magazine, The Brooklyn Rail, Word Riot, Num√©ro Cinq, Poets & Writers, Notre Dame Review, Fjords Review, Los Angeles Review of Books, San Francisco Chronicle, The Star-Ledger, The Record (Bergen County), Ambit, Across the Margin, theNewerYork, Literary Orphans, Blunderbuss Magazine, Rosebud Magazine, Gorse, RHINO, Gulf Coast (magazine), Quiddity, Prelude, Carbon Culture Review, and elsewhere. As an actor, he has also appeared on ‚ÄúThe Today Show,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe View,‚Äù and in various speaking roles on ‚ÄúAll My Children‚Äù and ‚ÄúOne Life to Live,‚Äù in addition to commercials ranging from Dentyne Ice to Axe body spray, Ab Roller Evolution and Rocking Abs. He has been photographed for international magazines, books, and catalogues spanning Rio and Milan, Paris and Melbourne, including the cover of DNA. He is most known for his work with C-IN2, a campaign he has shot since June 2007, as well as his work with Tommy Hilfiger and Izod underwear.  Multimedia Work  In collaboration with designer Ab[Screenwear] and director Nadia Bedzhanova, Campanioni's hybrid prose/piece \\"This body's long (& I'm still loading)\\" was adapted as an official selection of the Canadian International Film Festival in 2017. In the month leading to the novel's 2013 release, Campanioni created an interactive video calendar featuring film adaptations from various scenes in Going Down. The calendar reevaluates the notion of \\"real time\\" and also broadens the ways in which readers can respond to and read a text. RealClear's December 2013 feature (\\"The Model Writer\\") compared Campanioni's work to Andy Warhol's faux documentarian style and French New Wave cinema.Oradell resident writes new book based on modeling career References Category:American writers of Cuban descent Category:American people of Polish descent Category:American male novelists Category:American male poets Category:Male models from New York (state) Category:Living people Category:1985 births Category:21st-century American poets ","title":"Chris Campanioni"},{"id":"38366709","title":"Weightlifting at the 2002 Asian Games ‚Äì Men's 94 kg"},{"id":"38366713","text":"Kamazan-e Olya Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in Zand District, Malayer County, Hamadan Province, Iran.

He was the founder of Context Books, an award-winning small press, and editor-in- chief at Air America and has garnered notoriety as a provocateur for progressive causes. First published in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, most notably in the May Anthology of Oxford and Cambridge Poetry edited by Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney (under the name E.B. Friedlander), Friedlander‚Äôs writing has appeared in many publications, including Harper's Magazine, The New York Times, Time, the Los Angeles Times, The Paris Review, Lapham's Quarterly, and the Huffington Post, where he is a regular contributor. Education Beau Friedlander received a B.A. in Literature and Languages from Bennington College, a M.A. in English Romanticism from Oxford University and a M. Phil. in Comparative Literature and Scandinavian Studies from Columbia University. Career In 1998, Friedlander started Context Books, an independent press. He was twenty-seven. In 1999, Friedlander and Context Books came to public attention when he acquired a manuscript from Theodore J. Kaczynski, the Unabomber. The book, in which Kaczynski argued that he was not insane, as his family had claimed during his trial, was ready to be published by Context Books when Kaczynski refused to paraphrase some letters which he did not own the copyright to. The book was never published because of these copyright issues. Context Books published several award-winning works of literary fiction by authors including David Means, David Marshall Chan, and Daniel Quinn. Nonfiction authors included Derrick Jensen and John Bonifaz. The publishing house won several national awards, including The Los Angeles Times Book Prize (2000) for Assorted Fire Events. The New York Times singled out two of the anti-war books published by Context, stating they, ‚Äúemerged from and then codified opposition to the war in Iraq.‚Äù The first of these books was War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn't Want You to Know by William Rivers Pitt. It was published in at least 10 languages in editions worldwide, and became an international bestseller‚Äîincluding an appearance on the New York Times extended bestseller list. Target Iraq by Norman Solomon and Reese Erlich was a national bestseller. It was cited by whistleblower Katharine Gun as a catalyst in her decision to leak a 2003 NSA memo revealing illegal activity on the part of the United States to create diplomatic pressure to generate support for the war. In 2008, Friedlander became the editor-in-chief at Air America, the progressive radio network with hosts Rachel Maddow, Al Franken, Randi Rhodes and Marc Maron among others.

Despite his initial stated intention for the article to be a satire in the context of Andrew Breitbart's offer of $100,000 for an archive of progressive listserv messages, the article created a firestorm which led to the Huffington Post's pulling the article and requiring Friedlander's posts to be reviewed by an editor before being publicly viewable. Friedlander later posted an apology, stating: \\"I was actually trying to mimic what I saw as the way right wingers go about these matters, and by misapprehending the way they do things, I went too far. (I offered to broker a deal for anyone who had damaging media pertaining to Glenn Beck.) First, I owe Glenn Beck an apology. I crossed the line.

Although chiral Br√∏nsted acid catalyzed reactions may well fall into this category of catalysis under the definition given here (e.g., protonation of an imine by a chiral phosphoric acid), the extent of proton transfer and the demarcation between hydrogen bonding and full proton transfer is often ambiguous. Hence, some authors may exclude ion pair formation by proton transfer as a type of chiral counteranion catalysis. The discussion below will focus on chiral ion pairs generated through means other than proton transfer. (For a discussion about chiral Br√∏nsted acid catalyzed reactions, see the article on hydrogen bond catalysis.) The concept of utilizing the counteranion as the source of chirality in catalysis was first proposed by Arndtsen and coworkers in 2000, who applied chiral borate anions to copper-catalyzed olefin aziridination and cyclopropanation. The enantioselectivities observed were low: <10% ee in cases where the chiral borate was the only source of chirality. However, the observation that enantioinduction occurred only in nonpolar solvents supports the proposed role of the borate as the chiral counteranion. 500x500px The term asymmetric counteranion-directed catalysis was coined in 2006 by List in the context of organocatalytic iminium reduction in the presence of a chiral phosphate anion: 660x660px In 2007, Toste and coworkers reported the first successful application of chiral anions to transition metal catalysis, utilizing chiral phosphate anions for intramolecular allene hydrofunctionalization reactions catalyzed by phosphinegold(I) complexes:A Powerful Chiral Counterion Strategy for Asymmetric Transition Metal Catalysis Gregory L.

The house is a Grade I listed building, and is now used as a hospital. The associated 1,000 acre park is Grade II listed, and is now an equestrian centre and holiday park. History The Manor of Gisburne was first acquired by the Lister family in 1614 but the family only moved from Arnoldsbiggin to Lower Hall, Gisburne in 1706. The present hall was built between 1727 and 1736 by Thomas Lister with two storeys to an H-shaped floor plane, the south frontage having nine bays, the central three recessed, all pebbledashed with sandstone dressings and hipped slate roof. Lister was the Member of Parliament for Clitheroe from 1713 to his death in 1745. He was reputed to have planted over a million oak trees in this stretch of the Ribble Valley and in the surrounding parkland kept a herd of semi-wild white cattle which died out in 1859. The estate then passed from father to son through Thomas (1723‚Äì1761), also MP for Clitheroe from 1745 to 1761, to Thomas (1752-1826), MP for Clitheroe from 1773 to 1790 who in 1797 was created Baron Ribblesdale. He was followed in turn by Thomas, the second Baron Ribblesdale, then Thomas, the third Baron and finally Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale. On the fourth baron's death in 1925 part of the estate had to be sold to cover death duties. He had two sons, both of whom had been killed in action, one in the Boer War and the other in the first World War and he was survived only by his two sisters. On their deaths in 1944, the remaining estate was sold to the Hindley family, one of the founders of the British Home Stores. In October 1985, Gisburne Park house was converted and extended to become an independent private hospital and rehabilitation centre, with Christopher Hindley being its chairman and later its executive director. In 1995 the house and adjacent land was sold and became the BMI Gisburne Park Hospital.  The park  The 1,000-acre park, owned since 2003 by Guy Hindley and his American actress wife Amber Mead, is home to an equestrian centre and the Ribblesdale Holiday Park (developed around the old Deer House Farm and dairy).

History Giles was a son of Christopher Giles Snr (25 March 1802 ‚Äì 26 April 1884), a member of the Corn Exchange, London, and his wife Hannah Giles, n√©e Tester (25 December 1812 ‚Äì 17 February 1900). He came to Australia with his parents, three brothers and two sisters, leaving London on 21 January 1849 on the Calcutta, arriving in South Australia on 22 June 1849. They were accompanied by a large quantity of merchandise and other property, including a portable cottage, which they erected at his 400-acre property on the River Wakefield. In 1853 his father took up a lease of land at Ketchowla Station which is located between Terowie and Morgan. Giles and his family were later joined by Hillary Boucaut in 1861. In 1864, after a series of poor seasons and considerable losses, he sold his interest and retired to the city. Alfred Giles was educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, and after leaving school joined the party which John Ross had organised to traverse the country in 1870, planning the route for Charles Todd's Overland Telegraph Line, Giles being placed second in command. The party was the second to cross the unexplored interior of central Australia, 300 miles to the east of John McDouall Stuart's 1862 route. In the diary kept by Giles during the Overland Telegraph Survey Expedition,State Records of South Australia GRG 154/3 Diary - Alfred Giles, Overland Telegraph Survey Expedition he records the movement of the exploration party between camps and includes drawings of expedition party members, the lyrics of a song by John P. Ordway, and other observations. On 4 January 1871, Giles wrote: \\"Spelling all day in order to ascend Central Mt. Sturt, Mr. Ross started at 8 am to ascend the Mount and about 9 am Mr. Harvey and Mr. Hearn followed. At 11.30 am Mr. Ross returned having ascended the Mount, found the cairn stones raised by Stuart, and bringing with him the bottle buried by Stuart containing papers. The bottle is apparently one generally used for French capers and capped with oilskin and sealed; Inside is a thin roll also wrapped in waterproof cloth and tied with hemp, and outside all is a copy of the Adelaide \\"Observer\\" dated January 7, 1860. The whole is in excellent preservation although about eleven years since the Explorer planted it. Mr. Ross will forward the bottle unopened to Adelaide for the inspection of Mr. Todd. This is the first party to reach the Centre since the gallant Stuart planted the British flag in Central Australia.\\"State Records of South Australia GRG 154/3 Diary - Alfred Giles, Overland telegraph Survey Expedition, transcribed in GRG 154/4 Signed extract from Alfred Giles' Overland Telegraph Survey Expedition diary describing the finding of papers left by J. McDouall Stuart on Central Mount Sturt Others involved with him in this project were George Chalmers of Daly Waters, and Jack Cleland of Port Adelaide, a hero of the tragedy in 1875. In 1871 Giles was the first to cross Leichhardt's Bar on the Roper River, after the famous explorer crossed it in 1845. In 1873, 5,000 sheep were overlanded from Adelaide by Alfred Giles for distribution to Telegraph Stations along the Line, such as Barrow Creek. With his brother Arthur John Giles, he helped develop properties for pastoralist Dr. W. J. Browne. Among these were Newcastle Waters Station, Springvale and Delamere. Cattle, horses and sheep were brought into the Territory at different times for the purpose of stocking these properties. Giles married Mary Sprigg at Naracoorte in 1880. They managed Dr. Browne's Spring Vale Station at the Katherine River, 7 miles from Katherine in the early 1890s, and they afterwards owned the Bonrook Station on the Stuck-Up Waterhole, South of Pine Creek. About eight miles from Spring Vale he discovered a series of large caves, which he named the Kintore Caves, containing beautiful stalactites and stalagmites. He told how he once took Thomas Playford, a premier of South Australia, through the caves. The politician, who was remarkable for his huge bulk, got stuck tight between two stalactites, and one pillar had to be cut down before he was released. Early in 1882 he established Delamere Station on the Flora River, and grew cotton. Giles lived in the Territory for nearly 50 years, and died at his home at Marlborough Street, College Park or St. Peters. Family =Siblings= Alfred's elder brother, Christopher Giles jun., (c. 1841 ‚Äì 27 November 1917) was, with A. T. Woods, surveyors in Goyder's 1868 expedition, and with Charles Todd in 1870. He served at the Charlotte Waters repeater station until 1876 and remained with the Postmaster General's Department in charge of the accountancy section, until 1905 when he retired. He was a recognised authority on Middle-Eastern languages.

Personal life  His father was a Primitive Methodist minister called Jonathan Scott. Following the completion of his training he settled in Norwich where he opened up his own practice. His two sons joined him in the business in 1912. Scott was a very principled man. He was a practising Primitive Methodist and a strict teetotaller. He was also a strict vegetarian on moral grounds and a Sabbatarian. He disagreed with paying the part of his local government rates which funded Church of England schools and when bailiffs removed his paintings, he would buy them back again. As a Primitive Methodist he also became a local preacher and enthusiastic cyclist, he travelled thousands of miles by bicycle and even cycled to London for business on several occasions. He also, at his own expense, maintained a Chinese missionary in Western China. In 1920 he became embroiled in a dispute with Percy Carden, the minister at Scott Memorial Church. As a result of the dispute Scott and his family permanently severed relations with the church that was named after his father.  Career  In 1877 following the arrival of the railway to the North Norfolk town of Cromer. Scott operated a practice in Cromer to exploit the building boom on the North Norfolk coast at that time.

Construction of the museum is estimated to have cost $50 million.Peres Inaugurates Jewish Museum Funded by Putin, Vekselberg Bloomberg News, By Ilya Arkhipov and Henry Meyer Nov 8, 2012  Features  This museum, dedicated to the complex history of Russian Jewry, uses personal testimony, archival video footage and interactive displays‚Äîall translated into Russian and English. The exhibitions are divided chronologically, helping visitors to understand the life of Jewish communities as they travelled across medieval Europe, settling in shtetls before moving to the cities. The role of Russian Jewry in public life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is presented, as is the fate of Soviet Jews and the role of Jewish soldiers during World War II. Visitors learn about what it meant to be a \\"Soviet Jew\\" and finding out how and why so many left the USSR. Those expecting to find just a stark representation of pogroms, Holocaust, hardships and suffering will find Russian Jewish history presented as something much more complex, filled with both struggles and achievements. The museum is located in the northwestern Moscow neighborhood of Marina Roscha and can also be reached by taking tram no.19 from metro Novoslobodskaya.  History  Vladimir Putin stands at the entrance to the Jewish Museum in 2018. According to a May 2014 article by Alexis Zimberg in the Calvert Journal, the new Jewish Museum occupies the restored Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage. The 8,500-square-metre space is a landmark of the avant-garde 1920s. Designed by architect Konstantin Melnikov and structural engineer Vladimir Shukhov in 1926, the angled parallelogram building went from blueprint to structure in just one year. Vaulted ceilings and clean architectural angles echo an early Soviet mantra: ever higher, comrades, toward the radiant future. Melnikov and Shukhov even designed the interior lighting to resemble slanted rays of sunshine. In the 1990s, a fire left the garage decrepit and dysfunctional. Following mass restoration efforts it re- opened in 2008, initially to house the Garage Centre for Contemporary Culture. And then in 2012, thanks to funding from oligarchs like Roman Abramovich and Viktor Vekselberg, from Jewish organisations like FEOR and Chabad Lubavitch‚Äîeven with the support of President Vladimir Putin himself, who donated one month of his salary towards the construction‚Äîa site that had once represented another aspect of Soviet state control became home to the nation's's largest Jewish museum.Zimberg, Alexis.

Spending her senior year at Scarsdale High School on the bench with a torn ACL led her to view the game from a different perspective, and to consider coaching.Award-Winning Basketball Coach Lindsay Gottlieb to Speak in ScarsdaleDudek, Melissa, Dream Job: Lindsay Gottlieb Has an Ever-Growing List of Reasons She Loves Cal, Cal Sports Quarterly, Winter 2011‚Äì12. College Gottlieb followed in the tradition of both her parents and attended an Ivy League college, in her case Brown University. She played basketball her freshman year as a guard for the Brown Bears, but after her mother died during her sophomore year, she decided to spend a year studying abroad in Australia. It was during that year abroad that she decided to pursue a coaching career seriously. Gottlieb explained, \\"I knew that it was the perfect thing for me because it combined kind of my nerdiness and love of the X's and O's with the ability to impact 18- to 22-year-olds in a really significant way. To be able to do what I love, basketball, and have this intense impact on people, I felt that was it.\\" When Gottlieb returned to Brown for her senior year in 1998‚Äì99, she was both a player and a student assistant, working with the coaching staff. Her teammates voted her the Team Heart and Soul Award in 1999. That same year, she was also awarded her B.A. in political science.  Coaching career  = Assistant coach = Because of her experience as a player-coach at Brown, Gottlieb was hired as an assistant by Syracuse University head coach Marianna Freeman, the day after she graduated from college. In the two years she spent at Syracuse, Gottlieb also earned a master's degree in the philosophy of education. Then in 2001, she moved to the University of New Hampshire, where she was an assistant under Sue Johnson. The following year, the 24-year-old Gottlieb was asked by the head coach of the University of Richmond, Joanne Boyle, to be her top assistant. According to Gottlieb, it took her \\"about 30 seconds\\" to accept. Gottlieb worked under Boyle for three successful seasons at Richmond, 2002‚Äì05. The Spiders had three consecutive seasons with 20 or more wins. In 2003 and 2004 Richmond played in the WNIT, and in 2005 the Spiders received their first invitation to the NCAA Tournament in 14 years. In 2005, Boyle was hired as the head coach of the University of California, and she brought Gottlieb with her to Berkeley as her top assistant. At California, Gottlieb was involved in recruiting and scouting, and was the team's academic liaison. But she was primarily responsible for working with and developing the Bears' outstanding freshman post players, Ashley Walker and Devanei Hampton. Both became All- Americans, and Hampton was the first California player to be named Pac-10 Player of the Year (2006‚Äì07), while Walker went on to become the first Golden Bear to be drafted by the WNBA, a first-round pick of the Seattle Storm.Ashley Walker Profile .

Minli is a young ten-year-old girl with a fast and eager spirit, and is constantly ready for adventure. However, what she especially enjoys are her father Ba's stories, which are often told at the dinner table. Minli's mother, Ma, instead despises the stories that Ba tells, feeling that they are simply \\"nonsense.\\" Also, she is full of bitterness and resentment due to their poverty. All of the villagers, along with Minli's family, are also very poor, as farming is difficult in the hard and dry land due to Fruitless Mountain being the broken and lonely heart of the immortal Jade Dragon, a dragon that once brought rain to the Earth. Plus, there is barely enough rice to feed the people there, causing Minli to develop a wish for good fortune. Much to the displeasure of Ma, Minli spends her precious money on a goldfish. It turns out the goldfish can talk when people want to hear it. She decides to let it go because of how bitter it made Ma. When she does so, the goldfish tells her directions to Never-Ending Mountain, where a wise immortal known as the Old Man of the Moon lives. According to the goldfish, the wise man can answer Minli's question on how to bring good fortune to her family and the village. The following day, Minli then sets out, freeing the goldfish so as not to burden her parents further, and leaves the village to find \\"the old man of the moon\\". When her parents find out she is gone, they try to look for her, but are stopped by the goldfish seller, who tells them to trust Minli. Meanwhile, Minli sleeps for the night in the forest, only to wake up to find a trapped dragon, which she saves. They become friends, and Dragon offers to be her steed for the journey, despite the fact that he cannot fly, unlike other dragons. Dragon also reveals that he was born from a painting and came to life when his eyes were painted. Along the way, they encounter selfish monkeys, whom Minli manages to trick into letting them pass, and together they enter the City of Bright Moonlight, where Minli leaves Dragon in a cave and takes refuge in a boy's home. The boy is poor and has nothing but a buffalo but helps her find the king, who possesses a borrowed line of text, which is essential to finding the Old Man of the Moon. She ultimately meets the king, and he willingly gives up the borrowed line, which is revealed to be a page from the Book of Fortune, a legendary book that tells of fates and can be read only by immortal folk. Outside the city, Dragon also obtains a red string of destiny that is used to tie people destined to meet and marry together, which he believes is the borrowed line. The two then meet and after relating their adventures, set off once again, puzzled as to which is the real borrowed line. Meanwhile, at the Village of Fruitless Mountain, Ba and Ma have decided to return home and wait for Minli, and during this time, Ma feels remorse for having been so discontent when she already had her own precious treasure: her daughter. On the journey, Dragon tries to protect Minli from a poisonous Green Tiger but gets injured in the process and would have died had Minli not sought help from a nearby village of Moon Rain. The grandfather, A-Gong, gives Dragon medicine that doubles as tea. A set of twins from the village manage to trick the Green Tiger down an abandoned well and the next day take Minli and Dragon to Never-Ending Mountain, which turns out to be very close to the village. The twins explain that their village's name is due to raining seeds that fall from the moon every night, allowing flowering trees to bloom there. The blooms of the flowering trees also provide the antidote to the Green Tiger's poison, which saved Dragon. Using the borrowed line of text and the line of destiny, the adventurers stitch a kite that stretches into a bridge, and Minli goes on alone to meet the Old Man of the Moon. However, he informs her that she can ask only one question. After contemplating her choices, Minli chooses to ask Dragon's question for him: Why can he not fly? The old man instructs her to remove a rock from Dragon's head, which has been preventing him from flying. She does so, and immediately Dragon can fly. Together they fly home to Minli's village. The \\"rock\\" turns out to be the coveted Dragon's Pearl, which brings enormous wealth to her village. The Jade Dragon reunites with one of her children, Dragon, and transforms Fruitless Mountain to Fruitful Mountain. Because of Minli's sacrifice to help a friend, she and her family receive everything they could ever have hoped for.

It is heavy and sluggish, generally still by day, nestled among the cactus thorns, with the front legs and the long antennae stretched forward onto the plant's surface, parallel to each other. To escape predators it would rather drop from the cactus than take flight. It is more active at night, when it feeds and moves about. When the thorax is pinched, the insect squirts a slimy yellow fluid from two slits on the dorsal surface of the mesothorax, with a range of three to four inches. One aperture may discharge at first, and the other after the insect is pinched again. Some fluid also oozes out from other apertures over the body and legs, and also from the stumps of broken-off legs.

There is a famous press photograph of Tiny Wintringham, a portly homeless gentleman with his arms outstretched standing in the doorway of the original Gordon House, a night-shelter where he lived during the 1960s. In 1970, the owners of Gordon House had decided to have the building pulled down. Knowing that he, and other long-term residents, would thereby be made homeless, Tiny approached politicians, the unionist Norm Gallagher (leader of the Builders Labourers Federation) and newspapers. He made sufficient fuss that the State Government decided to build another Gordon House for Tiny and his comrades. Tiny was quoted in The Age newspaper as saying, ‚ÄúGordon House is a club‚Äîit‚Äôs essential for many blokes who have otherwise got no hope. But they don‚Äôt want assistance from charitable or religious organisations. They want freedom and independence‚Äîto be their own men as far as possible.‚Äù\\"Tiny's big fight to save Gordon House\\". The Age, April 14, 1970 Tiny‚Äôs success inspired Bryan Lipmann to name the company after him and has led Wintringham to begin a tradition of naming services after homeless people. Wintringham Services Wintringham provides support and services to over 2000 elderly men and women each day, the majority of whom are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Wintringham has six registered aged care facilities manages over 600 federally funded aged care packages, has an outreach and advocacy team, and through its subsidiary Wintringham Housing Ltd, owns or manages approximately 500 older persons‚Äô independent housing units. Wintringham has partnered with Allen Kong Architect in constructing McLean Lodge, Port Melbourne Hostel, Atkins Terrace Housing, Ron Conn Nursing Home, the Eunice Seddon Home and in the re- development of the Alexander Miller Trust portfolio of housing in regional Victoria. International Awards In 1998, Port Melbourne Hostel was the first Australian building to win the prestigious World Habitat Award. In 2011, Wintringham was awarded the United Nations Habitat Scroll of Honour. In the citation, UN Habitat stated that ‚ÄúThis is the first time UN-HABITAT recognises an initiative devoted to the elderly, and the first time an Australian project has been awarded.‚Äù  References  Category:Homelessness organizations Category:Non-profit organisations based in Victoria (Australia) Category:Homelessness in Australia ","title":"Wintringham Specialist Aged Care"},{"id":"38367432","text":"WNSH (94.7 FM, New York's Country 94.7) is a radio station that is licensed to Newark, New Jersey and serves the New York City area. The station is owned by Entercom. WNSH's studios are located in the combined Entercom facility in the Hudson Square neighborhood of Manhattan, and its transmitter is located in West Orange, New Jersey. The station airs a country music format, and was the flagship for Cumulus Media's \\"Nash\\" brand of country-related multimedia from 2013 until Entercom's acquisition of the station in 2019. WNSH broadcasts in the HD Radio format. History =Early years= WFME's logo in 2012, under Family Radio ownership. The 94.7 FM frequency signed on in 1947 as WAAT-FM, and was owned by the Bremer Broadcasting Company along with sister station WAAT (970 AM). The following year Bremer launched New Jersey's first television station, WATV on channel 13 transmitting from the WAAT-FM tower. In 1957 the three stations were sold by Bremer to National Telefilm Associates, who changed the operation's call letters to WNTA-FM.\\"WAAT, WATV (TV) sold to NTA for $3.5 million.\\"Broadcasting & Telecasting, October 7, 1957, pg. 9.\\"NTA Newark purchase gets FCC's approval.\\"Broadcasting & Telecasting, April 7, 1958, pg. 64. During this period the station had diversified programming such as jazz, classical music, and easy listening music. National Telefilm split up its holdings in 1961, with WNTA-TV being sold to a New York City-based nonprofit educational group (it is now WNET), and the WNTA radio stations going to Communications Industries Broadcasting.\\"Changing Hands.\\" Broadcasting, November 6, 1961, pg. 78. The new owners changed the calls to WJRZ-FM\\"For the record.\\" Broadcasting, April 2, 1962, pg. 129. and initially retained the station's previous format, however on April 14, 1963 Family Radio, a Christian broadcaster then based in Oakland, California, began leasing airtime on WJRZ-FM.\\"Family Stations sign to program on WJRZ-FM.\\" Broadcasting, April 8, 1963, pg. 53. In 1964 the station was renamed WFME, and in March 1966 Family Radio purchased 94.7 FM outright and began airing its religious programming around-the-clock.\\"For the record.\\" Broadcasting, January 31, 1966, pg. 37. WFME's local programming consisted of community announcements, weekend public affairs, and weather and traffic inserts during Family Radio's Rise and Rejoice morning show. WFME originated a portion of the network's overnight program Nightwatch, hosted by station manager/chief engineer Charlie Menut. The rest of the station's schedule originated from Family Radio headquarters in Oakland. WFME's programming was also heard on two translator stations: W213AC (90.5 FM) in Hyde Park, New York; and W247AE (97.3 FM) in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. As a result of WFME's license status change (see below), the translators could no longer legally rebroadcast WFME's broadcast signal; as a result, both translator stations are now carrying a different Family Radio station with a similar feed as of February 2012. =Sale to Cumulus Media= On January 6, 2012, Family Radio applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to change the license of WFME from noncommercial to commercial. This move followed the sales by Family Radio of stations in the Philadelphia (WKDN-FM) and Baltimore‚ÄìWashington (WFSI) markets and quickly prompted conjecture from radio industry monitors that WFME would be sold next. The application was approved on February 7, 2012. The sale rumors were confirmed on October 16, 2012, when Family Radio announced that it would sell WFME to Atlanta-based Cumulus Media; the originally undisclosed price was later confirmed to be $40 million. In addition, Family Radio acquired Cumulus' WDVY (106.3 FM) in Mount Kisco, New York. The FCC approved the sale/station trade January 4, 2013, making 94.7 FM a sister station to Cumulus' two existing New York market stations, WABC and WPLJ. Four days later, on January 8, 2013, Cumulus completed the purchase of WFME. Family Radio programming on 94.7 FM ended at 3:40 p.m. on January 11, 2013; prior to signing off of the frequency, station manager Charlie Menut stated that the network's programming would be transferred to 106.3 FM, which became the new WFME on January 15, and that efforts to acquire an AM frequency that would cover the New York City area were being made.Menut, Charles.

Retrieved January 11, 2013. Two years later, in February 2015, Family Radio programming returned to the area via its acquisition of WQEW (1560 AM), a former Radio Disney outlet. =\\"Nash FM\\" launch= NASH FM and NASH Icon brands operated by previous WNSH owner Cumulus Media. About twenty minutes after WFME signed off, 94.7 FM under Cumulus ownership began a simulcast of WPLJ, which broadcast a hot adult contemporary format. The frequency's call sign was changed three days later to WRXP, a call sign previously used on the 101.9 FM facility in New York City under two different owners and two different stints as an alternative rock station. The WPLJ simulcast ended on January 18 in favor of stunting with \\"The 94.7 Wheel of Formats.\\" During this stunt, a wide variety of sound clips and songs were played, from formats such as top 40/CHR and smooth jazz, as well as polka and all-one artist formats like all-Bruce Springsteen and \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. The stunting continued until 9:47 a.m. on January 21, when WRXP adopted a new country music format branded as Nash FM 94.7. The first song on \\"Nash FM\\" was \\"How Country Feels\\" by Randy Houser. The move gave the New York City area its first full-time country station since 2002, when the \\"Y-107\\" simulcast of four suburban stations at 107.1 FM‚Äîlocated in Briarcliff Manor and Hampton Bays, New York, and Belvidere and Long Branch, New Jersey‚Äîcancelled the format. The last station to carry country full-time within the market was WYNY (103.5 FM), which became rhythmic adult contemporary WKTU in 1996. To coincide with the \\"Nash\\" launch, Cumulus Media swapped the WNSH call sign from its sister station in Cambridge, Minnesota (the present-day WLUP) on January 29, 2013. The station served as the flagship of Nash‚Äîan initiative to create a singular multi-platform brand for country music content originated by Cumulus Media, including WNSH and other radio stations (which would either adopt the Nash FM branding themselves, or co-brand with it), Nash Bash concerts, its syndicated country programming (including American Country Countdown, and plans for other content to be distributed by Westwood One), and Nash Magazine. On November 3, 2014, 104.7 WELJ in Montauk dropped its Hot AC format for a simulcast of WNSH, to cover listeners on Eastern Long Island where WNSH's 94.7 signal is difficult to hear. The simulcast ended on August 31, 2015, when WELJ re- launched as Nash Icon (a country hits format focusing on songs and artists from the 1990s and early 2000s), In February 2019, WNSH dropped Nash FM's syndicated morning show Ty, Kelly & Chuck in favor of a local show, with former Nash network personality Kelly Ford. =Sale to Entercom= On February 13, 2019, Cumulus announced that WNSH would be traded to Entercom, as part of an exchange of WNSH and several stations in Springfield, Massachusetts for Entercom stations in Indianapolis; in the same announcement, Cumulus revealed the separate sale of sister station WPLJ and other outlets to Educational Media Foundation. Entercom assumed control of the station beginning March 1, 2019 under a local marketing agreement and WNSH maintained its country format, although Entercom's head of country stations Tim Roberts stated that the company would be evaluating whether they would continue to license the Nash brand from Cumulus. The swap was finalized on May 13. On March 25, 2019, WNSH rebranded as New York's Country 94.7, with no change in lineup or programming. Signal Unlike most of the area's FM stations like WHTZ (and its new sister stations WCBS-FM, WFAN-FM and WNEW-FM), which transmit their signals from atop the Empire State Building, WNSH transmits its signal from First Mountain in West Orange, New Jersey, about 15 miles west of Midtown Manhattan. Therefore, WNSH's signal is much stronger west of New York City than the stations from the Empire, but is considerably weaker east of Manhattan and in parts of the city itself and Long Island. It is short spaced to multiple stations, including AC-formatted sister station WMAS-FM in Enfield, Connecticut, which also broadcasts on 94.7 MHz. However, Entercom plans to move its transmitter closer to New York City, by moving its transmitter site to Lyndhurst, New Jersey, the same transmitter site location as iHeartMedia-owned station WOR, without causing any interference with WMAS-FM and other stations.

The idea of transition is a central element of his artistic practice. French photographer and photography specialist Arnaud Claass wrote about Smith's work, in the preface of Smith's first monographic book: \\"There is no mystery; SMITH's approach to the visible, at once luminarist and dark, is valid as an image of the uncertainty of sexual roles.

F. S. Grundtvig. It is composed in a metre similar to a famous hymn, Far Verden, far vel (\\"Farewell, world, farewell\\") by Thomas Kingo but unlike its baroque model, Grundtvig's work carries a more optimistic message, expressing faith in the love and grace of God. The poem was written at a critical time in Grundtvig's life but lends voice to his belief that with God's love one can find happiness in life. In 2006 it was named as part of the Danish Culture Canon, being one of the 24 items in the Lyrikantologi which was selected as one of the 12 works in the Literature section of the canon.

It is the third painting by Waterhouse that depicts a scene from the Tennyson poem, \\"The Lady of Shalott\\". The title of the painting is a quotation from the last two lines in the fourth and final verse of the second part of Tennyson's poem: This painting depicts an earlier point in the tale of the Lady of Shalott than those depicted by Waterhouse in his previous two works of 1888 and 1894; the Lady is still confined in her tower, weaving a tapestry, viewing the world outside only through the reflection in the large mirror in the background. In the painting, the mirror reveals a bridge over a river leading to the walls and towers of Camelot; also visible nearby are a man and a woman, perhaps the \\"two young lovers lately wed\\" referred to in Tennyson's poem. The scene is set shortly before an image of Lancelot appears in the mirror, enticing the Lady out of her tower to her death. The painting shows the Lady of Shalott resting from her weaving. The lady wears a red dress, in a room with Romanesque columns holding up the arches of the window reflected in the mirror. The frame of the loom and the geometric tiles of the floor lead the viewer into the room, where reds, yellows and blues echo the more vivid colours outside. A single poppy can be seen reflected in the mirror. The shuttles of the loom resemble boats, foreshadowing the Lady's death. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1916. It was sold from the estate of the accountant John George Griffiths CVO at Hampton's in 1923 for 300 guineas, and passed through the hands of the art dealer Arthur de Casseres. It was owned by Mr and Mrs Frederick Cowan, and inherited by their great-niece, the wife of Canadian engineer Philip Berney Jackson, who donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1971.

Li Yuan, with an army of around 25,000, was advancing south along the Fen River towards the imperial capital, Daxingcheng. His advance was stalled for two weeks due to heavy rainfall and he was met at the town of Huoyi by an elite Sui army of 20,000 (or 30,000) men. Li Yuan's cavalry, under the command of his two eldest sons, lured the Sui out of the protection of the city walls, but in the first clash between the two main armies, Li Yuan's forces were initially driven back. At that point, possibly due to a stratagem on Li Yuan's behalf, the arrival of the rest of the rebel army, or to the flanking manoeuvres of Li Yuan's cavalry, which had gotten behind the Sui army, the Sui troops collapsed and routed, fleeing back towards Huoyi. Li Yuan's cavalry, however, cut off their retreat. The battle was followed by the capture of weakly-defended Huoyi, and the advance on Daxingcheng, which fell to the rebels in November. In the next year, Li Yuan deposed the Sui and proclaimed himself emperor, beginning the Tang dynasty.  Background  During the later reign of the second emperor of the Sui dynasty, Yang, imperial authority began to wane. The main reason was the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. Coupled with natural disasters, the conscription of more and more men for the war, and the hoarding of scarce grain reserves for the army's needs increased provincial discontent. As a result, from 611 on, rural revolts broke out across the empire, and with the Emperor's prestige and legitimacy diminished by military failure, ambitious provincial magnates were encouraged to challenge his rule. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, and only as unrest spread within the empire and the powerful Eastern Turks turned hostile, did he realize the gravity of the situation: in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618. With the Emperor's withdrawal from the scene, local governors and magnates were left free to advance their own ambitions to power. Nine major contenders emerged, some claiming the imperial title for themselves, others, like Li Mi in Henan, contenting themselves, for the time being, with the more modest titles of \\"Duke\\" (g≈çng) and \\"King\\" (w√°ng). Among the most well-positioned contenders was Li Yuan, Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan in the northwest (modern Shanxi). A scion of a noble family related to the Sui dynasty, and with a distinguished career behind him, Li Yuan was an obvious candidate for the throne: his province possessed excellent natural defences, a heavily militarized population, and was located near the capitals of Daxingcheng (Chang'an) and Luoyang.  Li Yuan's march south  Li Yuan's march from Taiyuan to Chang'an Traditional Chinese historiography emphasizes Li Yuan's initial reluctance to revolt against the Sui, and claims that he had to be persuaded by his senior aides and his second son (and eventual successor), Li Shimin. In reality, as revealed by the diary of his chief secretary, Wen Daya, Li Yuan was considering a rebellion at least by the time of his appointment to Taiyuan in early 617, and was very much the driving force behind the revolt. In mid-617, Li began raising additional troops from his province and executed his two deputies‚Äîwho were appointed by Yang to watch over him. He also concluded an alliance with Shibi, the powerful khagan of the Eastern Turks, which secured his northern frontier from a Turkish invasion and provided him with men and, most importantly, horses, which he lacked. Initially, however, Li Yuan portrayed himself a Sui loyalist, and proclaimed his intention of placing Yang's grandson, Yang You, on the throne. Li Yuan's campaign was recorded in detail by Wen Daya. In mid-July, a first expedition under Li Yuan's eldest sons Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin was launched against the loyalist Xihe Commandery further south along the Fen River. Li Yuan's sons succeeded in capturing the province within a few days and returned to Taiyuan. Finally, after completing his preparations, on 10 August Li Yuan began his march south, along the Fen towards Daxingcheng. His \\"righteous army\\" comprised 30,000 men, raised from the local \\"soaring hawk\\" militia, but with some 10,000 additional volunteers, and including a 500-strong Turkish contingent provided by the khagan along with 2,000 horses. His fifteen-year-old son Li Yuanji was left behind to guard Taiyuan, while Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin accompanied their father as his lieutenants. A small force under Zhang Lun (ÂºµÁ∂∏) was detached to advance parallel to the main army and captured the loyalist commanderies further west, securing the flanks. Li Yuan's advance was stopped at a place called Guhubao for two weeks in late August due to heavy rainfall, giving time to the Sui authorities to react. The general Qutu Tong was sent to secure Hedong Commandery on the Yellow River. Another 20,000 elite troops under Song Laosheng advanced north to the town of Huoyi, some south of Guhubao, to confront him. Huoyi was placed on the southern exit of a defile through which the road passed, following the course of the Fen River, and provided an excellent position from which to check an army coming from the north. When Li Yuan's army learned of Song Laosheng's presence, some began advocating a retreat to Taiyuan, fearing that in their absence the Turks might break the treaty and attack it. A council was held, at which Li Yuan sided with his sons, who argued forcefully for continuing the campaign. Thus, on 8 September, after the rains stopped, Li Yuan's army set out from its encampment. Instead of following the road through the defile, however, they chose a path through the southeastern hills, allegedly revealed to them by a peasant. Li Yuan's army that arrived at Huoyi numbered less than its original 30,000 men, perhaps as few as 25,000, due to the detachments left behind. It was predominantly composed of infantry and was divided into six divisions under a general (tongjun), but it is unclear how they were subordinated to Li Yuan and his sons: Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin were named in the traditional fashion as commanders of the left and right respectively, but in the accounts of the battle, the army appears formed in van, middle, and rear divisions. The cavalry, a few hundred strong, was apparently kept as a reserve. Very little is also known about the Sui army, except that Song Laosheng's troops were considered to be elite warriors. Some sources raise their number to 30,000 from the more typical 20,000; this could be an error, or possibly indicate additional forces recruited at Huoyi.  Battle  Li Yuan, Emperor Gaozu of Tang () There are two accounts of the subsequent battle: the account of Wen Daya, and a later official account, which became the dominant version in traditional Chinese historiography. The latter was compiled during the reign of Li Shimin, and therefore enhances his own role, having him decide the battle in a cavalry charge, while denigrating the role of both his father and his elder brother Li Jiancheng, whom Li Shimin would murder and supplant on the throne. The two accounts are difficult to reconcile, but Wen Daya's account, despite its own inadequacies, is to be preferred as an eyewitness testimony. According to Wen Daya, Li Yuan feared that Song Laosheng would deny battle and instead force him to engage in a prolonged and costly siege of the town. For this reason, as soon as the headquarters with the cavalry cleared the hills and came into view of Huoyi in the early afternoon of 8 September, Li Yuan sent his sons at the head of the cavalry to manoeuvre before the walls of Huoyi, hoping to entice the Sui army to come out. In this he hoped to exploit Song Laosheng's reputation for rashness. The slower-moving infantry, which formed the bulk of Li Yuan's army, was still in the process of traversing the hills, and Li Yuan sent officers to hurry them up. Song Laosheng, who may have seen this as an opportunity to destroy his enemy piecemeal, deployed his army outside the town wall, but proved reluctant to advance further, and had to be goaded further away from the town through a feigned retreat by the cavalry. At this time, Li Yuan's infantry began arriving, with the van division deploying in a square to fend off a Sui attack while the other two divisions were coming up behind it. Wen Daya's account now becomes sketchier, indicating that the infantry charged the Sui army, at which point Li Yuan's sons led the cavalry around the Sui flank towards the town, where the small garrison left behind by Song Laosheng was forced to drop the portcullis gates. Li Yuan then let spread the rumour that Song Laosheng had been killed, which demoralized the Sui force. The Sui army began to retreat, but this turned into a rout when they found their retreat to Huoyi cut off by Li Yuan's cavalry and the barred gates. Wen Daya's narrative can be supplemented by the later account, which, despite its bias regarding Li Shimin, also contains indications that not everything went according to Li Yuan's plans: it appears that in the first clash between Li Yuan's infantry and the Sui army, the Sui had the upper hand and pushed Li Yuan back, possibly because he had not yet managed to bring all his forces into the field. Either through the arrival of the rest of Li Yuan's infantry, the actions of Li Yuan's cavalry along and behind the Sui flanks, or Li Yuan's stratagem, the Sui army's morale gave way abruptly, and their resistance collapsed. The battle was over by 4:00 p.m. in a crushing victory for Li Yuan, who then led his troops against Huoyi itself. Although he lacked any siege equipment, the garrison in the town was too small to effectively resist Li Yuan's army, and Huoyi fell within a few hours.  Aftermath  Following their victory, Li Yuan and his army continued their southward advance, and in mid-October reached the Yellow River. Part of the army was left behind to contain the Sui garrison at Puzhou, while the rest crossed the river, defeating a Sui army that tried to stop them. The governor of Huazhou surrendered the city and its vital granaries to him, and Li Yuan turned towards the capital. On the way, he was joined by his daughter, Princess Pingyang, and his cousin, Li Shentong, with the troops they had raised themselves. By the time Li Yuan's army reached Daxingcheng, it was said to number 200,000 men. After a brief siege, on 9 November, Li Yuan's troops stormed the capital. This feat established Li Yuan as a major contender for the empire, but for the moment, despite the calls of his generals to proclaim himself emperor there and then, he still pretended to be a Sui loyalist: the Sui imperial family was kept safe and its dignity respected, and the young Yang You was enthroned as Emperor Gong, with Yang himself delegated to the honorific position of \\"retired emperor\\" (Taishang Huang). It was not until 16 June 618, exactly a year after he formally broke with Sui by executing his deputies, that Li Yuan deposed the puppet emperor and proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Tang dynasty, with the temple name of Gaozu. The new dynasty still had to face the various local rebels and warlords that had sprung up throughout the Chinese Empire, but by 628, with a judicious mixture of force and clemency, the Tang had succeeded in the pacification and consolidation of China under their rule.

In the late middle age there were a handful of prosecutions for harm done through witchcraft, but the passing of the Witchcraft Act 1563 made witchcraft, or consulting with witches, capital crimes. The first major issue of trials under the new act were the North Berwick witch trials, beginning in 1589, in which King James VI played a major part as \\"victim\\" and investigator. He became interested in witchcraft and published a defence of witch-hunting in the Daemonologie in 1597, but he appears to have become increasingly sceptical and eventually took steps to limit prosecutions. An estimated 4,000 to 6,000 people, mostly from the Scottish Lowlands, were tried for witchcraft in this period, a much higher rate than for neighbouring England. There were major series of trials in 1590‚Äì91, 1597, 1628‚Äì31, 1649‚Äì50 and 1661‚Äì62. Seventy-five per cent of the accused were women. Modern estimates indicate that more than 1,500 persons were executed; most were strangled and then burned. The hunts subsided under English occupation after the Civil Wars during the period of the Commonwealth led by Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s, but returned after the Restoration in 1660, causing some alarm and leading to the Privy Council of Scotland limiting arrests, prosecutions and torture. There was also growing scepticism in the later seventeenth century, while some of the factors that may have contributed to the trials, such as economic distress, subsided. Although there were occasional local outbreaks of witch-hunting, the last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The Scottish and English parliaments merged in 1707, and the unified British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736. Many causes have been suggested for the hunts, including economic distress, changing attitudes to women, the rise of a \\"godly state\\", the inquisitorial Scottish judicial system, the widespread use of judicial torture, the role of the local kirk, decentralised justice and the prevalence of the idea of the diabolic pact. The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch-hunt has led some historians to proffer the concept of \\"associated circumstances\\", rather than one single significant cause. Origins =Legal origins= James VI, from his Daemonologie (1597) For late Medieval Scotland there is evidence of occasional prosecutions of individuals for causing harm through witchcraft. High-profile political cases included the action against John Stewart, Earl of Mar for allegedly using sorcery against his brother King James III in 1479. Evidence of these political cases indicates that they were becoming rarer in the first half of the sixteenth century however. Popular belief in magic was widespread in the Middle Ages, but theologians had been generally sceptical, and lawyers interested in prosecuting only cases in which harm from magic was evident. From the late sixteenth century attitudes began to change, and witches were seen as deriving powers from the Devil, with the result that witchcraft was seen as a form of heresy. These ideas were widely accepted by both Catholics and Protestants in the sixteenth century. In the aftermath of the initial Reformation settlement of 1560, Parliament passed the Witchcraft Act 1563, one of a series of laws underpinning Biblical laws and similar to that passed in England a year earlier, which made the practice of witchcraft itself, and consulting with witches, capital crimes. The first witch-hunt under the act was in the east of the country in 1568‚Äì69 in Angus and the Mearns, where there were unsuccessful attempts to introduce elements of the diabolic pact and the hunt collapsed. The Earl of Argyll made a progress in Lorne, Argyll, and Cowal in July 1574 holding courts and executing men and women convicted of \\"common sorcery.\\"William Boyd, Calendar of State Papers Scotland: 1574-1581, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907) p. 34. =Role of James VI= James VI's visit to Denmark in 1589, where witch-hunts were already common, may have encouraged an interest in the study of witchcraft, and he came to see the storms he encountered on his voyage as the result of magic. After his return to Scotland, he attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the 1563 Act and the first known to successfully involve the diabolic pact. Several people, most notably Agnes Sampson and the schoolmaster John Fian, were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James' ship. James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches. He subsequently believed that a nobleman, Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects. James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. Inspired by his personal involvement, in 1597 he wrote the Daemonologie, a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth, which contains probably the most famous literary depiction of Scottish witches.J. Keay and J. Keay, Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland (London: Harper Collins, 1994), , p. 556. James imported continental explanations of witchcraft. In the view of Thomas Lolis, James I's goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil. However, after the publication of Daemonologie his views became more sceptical, and in the same year he revoked the standing commissions on witchcraft, limiting prosecutions by the central courts. Nature of the trials Although Scotland had probably about one quarter of the population of England, it had three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions, at an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 over the entire period. This was about four times the European average. The overwhelming majority were in the Lowlands, where the Kirk had more control, despite the evidence that basic magical beliefs were very widespread in the Highlands. Persecution of witchcraft in Orkney differed from the mainland with most trials taking place before 1650. Large series of trials included those in 1590‚Äì91 and the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597, which took place across Scotland from March to October. At least 400 people were put on trial for various forms of diabolism. The number of those executed as a result of these trials is unknown, but is believed to be about 200. Later major trials included hunts in 1628‚Äì31 and 1649‚Äì50. Probably the most intense witch-hunt was in 1661‚Äì62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties. False witch-pricking bodkins from Reginald Scott's Discovery of Witchcraft, 1584 Most of the accused, some 75%, were women, though some men were also executed as witches or as warlocks. Modern estimates indicate that over 1,500 persons were executed. Most of these were older women, with some younger women and men accused because they were related to an accused witch, usually as daughters and husbands. Some men were accused because they were folk healers who were felt to have misused their powers, although folk healers as a group were not targeted. Most were not vagrants or beggars, but settled members of their communities. Most had built a reputation for witchcraft over years, which resulted in prosecution when a \\"victim\\" suffered ill fortune, particularly after a curse had been issued. The use of curses by some women as a means of acquiring social power may have made this process more likely to occur. Almost all witchcraft prosecutions took place in secular courts under the provisions of the 1563 Act. In 1649 the religiously radical Covenanter regime passed a new witchcraft act that ratified the existing act and extended it to deal with consulters of \\"Devils and familiar spirits\\", who would now be punished with death. There were three main types of court in which accused witches could be tried. First was the Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh, which took cases from all over Scotland, with a heavy bias to the local region. Next were the circuit courts, presided over by judges from the central courts and held in the various shires of the country. Finally, there were a series of ad hoc local courts, held under commissions by the Privy Council or Parliament and staffed by local landholders and gentlemen to try witches in the places where they were accused. Based on known outcomes, the execution rates for the local courts was much higher than the courts run by professional lawyers, with the local courts executing some 90 per cent of the accused, the Judiciary Court 55 per cent, but the circuit courts only 16 per cent. After the revocation of the standing commissions in 1597, the pursuit of witchcraft was largely taken over by kirk sessions, disciplinary committees run by the parish elite, and was often used to attack \\"superstitious\\" and Catholic practices. The central courts only launched a trial when the Privy Council issued a commission, although the council did not have full control over prosecutions in the Court of Judiciary. Scottish witchcraft trials were notable for their use of pricking, in which a suspect's skin was pierced with needles, pins and bodkins as it was believed that they would possess a Devil's mark through which they could not feel pain. Professional prickers included John Kincaid and John Dick, whose actions helped set off the outbreak of witch-hunting in 1661‚Äì62, and whose exposure as frauds, and subsequent imprisonment, helped end the trials. Judicial torture was used in some high-profile cases, like that of John Fine, one of the witches accused of plotting the death of the king in 1590, whose feet were crushed in a shin press, known as the boots. However, these cases were relatively rare. Confessions, considered the best evidence for conviction, were more usually extracted by \\"waking\\" the witch, keeping the suspect sleep deprived. After about three days individuals tend to hallucinate, and this provided some exotic detail in witchcraft trials. In Scotland, convicted witches were usually strangled at the stake before having their bodies burned, although there are instances where they were burned alive. Witch beliefs Illustration of Doctor Fian, from Newes from Scotland The belief that witches could cause harm was common among all social groups in early modern Scotland. In 1701 in Anstruther, Elizabeth Dick had been turned away from the local mill when begging. She cursed the mill and several witnesses testified that the grain in the mill turned red. Only when one of the people who had refused her help ran after her and gave her alms did she bless the mill and everything returned to normal. About half of accused witches had already gained a reputation for causing harm over a long period of time. The fact that only four per cent of recorded accused witches were involved in folk healing seems to indicate that healing skills were largely seen as different from witchcraft. The Aberdeenshire trials of 1596 reveal that spells could be purchased from folk magicians for success at fishing, to ensure a happy marriage, to prolong life and to affect the weather, but harmful spells were considered witchcraft. Many accusations included sexual fears. Margaret Bain, a midwife, it was claimed, could transfer the pains of childbirth to a woman's husband and Helen Gray cast a spell on a man that gave him a permanent erection. Witches and other sorts of folk magicians could also carry out divinations. These included by reading the marks on the shoulder blade of a slaughtered animal, measuring a person's sleeve or waist to see if they were suffering from a fever, or being able to find answers based on which way a sieve suspended from scissors or shears swung, as Margaret Mungo was accused of doing before the kirk session of Dingwall in 1649. It has often been stated that Scottish witchcraft was particularly concerned with the demonic pact. In the high court, Katherine Sands, who was one of four women accused of witchcraft at Culross in 1675, admitted to renouncing her baptism, receiving the Devil's mark and having sex with the Devil, but in local trials these demonic elements were rarer. Stuart MacDonald notes that in trials from Fife the Devil was a relatively insignificant and indistinct figure and that a number of instances of covens meeting look like fairy revels, where the dancing fairies traditionally disappeared when a human broke the ring, rather than satanic gatherings. Fairies were an important part of magical beliefs in Scotland. Isobel Gowdie, the young wife of a cottar from near Auldearn, who was tried for witchcraft in 1662, left four depositions, gained without torture, that provide one of the most detailed insights into magical beliefs in Britain. She stated that her coven met on nearby Downie Hill, that they could transform themselves into hares and that she had been entertained by the Queen of the Fairies in her home under the hill. J. A. MacCulloch argued that there was a \\"mingling of beliefs\\" in Scotland, between popular belief in fairies and elite Christian ideas of demonic action.S. MacDonald, \\"In search of the devil in Fife witchcraft cases 1560‚Äì1705\\", in J. Goodare, ed., The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), , p. 47. Decline In the seventeenth century there was growing scepticism about the reality of witchcraft among the educated elite. Scotland was defeated in the Civil Wars by the forces of the English parliament led by Oliver Cromwell and occupied. In 1652 Scotland was declared part of a Commonwealth with England and Ireland and the Privy Council and courts ceased to exist. The English judges who replaced them were hostile to the use of torture and often sceptical of the evidence it produced, resulting in a decline in prosecutions. In an attempt to gain support among the landholding orders, Sheriff's courts were re-established and Justices of the Peace returned in 1656. The result was a wave of witchcraft cases, with 102 in the period 1657‚Äì59. The limitations on prosecutions were fully reversed with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and there was a flood of over 600 cases that alarmed the restored Privy Council, leading it to insist on the necessity of its commission for an arrest or prosecution, and banning judicial torture. George Sinclair's Satans Invisible World (1685), one of the many tracts published in Scotland arguing against sceptical views of witchcraft Prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. The exposure of prickers as frauds in 1662 removed a major form of evidence. The Lord Advocate George Mackenzie made efforts to make prosecutions ineffective. There may also have been a growing popular scepticism, and, with relative peace and stability, the economic and social tensions that may have contributed to accusations were reduced, although there were occasional local outbreaks, like those in East Lothian in 1678 and in Paisley in 1697. The last executions in the records of the central courts were in 1706. The last trial was held in the court of a sheriff-depute at Dornoch in 1727, and was of questionable legality. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736, making the legal pursuit of witches impossible. Nevertheless, basic magical beliefs persisted, particularly in the Highlands and Islands. Causes Various reasons for the Scottish witch-hunt, and its more intense nature than that in England, have been advanced by historians. Older theories, that there was a widespread pagan cult that was persecuted in this period and that the witch-hunts were the result of a rising medical profession eliminating folk healers, have been discredited among professional historians. Most of the major periods of prosecution coincided with periods of intense economic distress, and some accusations may have followed the withdrawal of charity from marginal figures, particularly the single women that made up many of the accused. The reformed Kirk that emerged from 1560 was heavily influenced by Calvinism and Presbyterianism, and may have perceived women as more of a moral threat. As a result the witch-hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. Christina Larner suggested that the outbreak of the hunt in the mid-sixteenth century was tied to the rise of a \\"godly state\\", where the reformed Kirk was closely linked to an increasingly intrusive Scottish crown and legal system. It has been suggested that the intensity of Scottish witch-hunting was due to an inquisitorial judicial system and the widespread use of judicial torture. However, Brian P. Levack argues that the Scottish system was only partly inquisitorial and that use of judicial torture was extremely limited, similar to the situation in England. A relatively high level of acquittal in Scottish trials may have been due to the employment of defence lawyers in Scottish courts, a benefit not given accused witches in England. The close involvement of the Scottish Kirk in trials and the decentralised nature of Scottish courts, where local magistrates heard many cases (in contrast to England where most were before a small number of circuit judges), may have contributed to higher rates of prosecution. The diabolic pact is often stated as a major difference between Scottish and English witchcraft cases, but Stuart Maxwell argues that the iconography of Satan may be an imposition of central government beliefs on local traditions, particularly those concerned with fairies, which were more persistent in Scotland than in England. The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch-hunt has led some historians to proffer the concept of \\"associated circumstances\\", rather than one single significant cause.

Coppier was the daughter of Jacob Coppier, lord of Kalslagen and Alphen, and Margaretha van Roon. Her brothers and half-brothers all became active members of the Dutch rebellion. Coppier married Joachim Burgher, a polymath known as \\"Polites\\" from Goes, who before their marriage had become scribe of Antwerp in 1541.

Both Coppier's brother Andries and her husband took part in the plot. The Spanish governor Luis de Requesens y Z√∫√±iga however became aware of the plot and had the city gates sealed, every suspicious person rounded up and every house searched. Andries Coppier was caught and tortured to death without revealing names. The four leaders of the plot had taken refuge at the house of Coppier, who hid them just before her house was searched. Her stoicism during the search saved these people and possibly many others who could have been revealed under torture.

(retrieved 16 March 2020). The bright warning colours keep away predators and their defense when disturbed includes the ejection of a toxic foam. The insect has been called by a variety of names including coffee locust, ghost grasshopper, northern spotted grasshopper, and foam grasshopper, and enjoys some popularity as a pet insect. Description A. miliaris in Kerala The head and thorax are dark green with a canary-yellow band on the side. The tegmina are green with many yellow spots; the legs are blue, with a yellow serrated pattern on the hind femora. The abdomen is black with bright red bands. Subspecies and distribution There are two subspecies: * A. miliaris miliaris (Linnaeus, 1758) - India to Indo-China * A. miliaris pseudopunctatus Kevan, 1974 - Pakistan Habits It swarms in October, the mating and egg-laying season, collecting on bushes and grasses. It is heavy and sluggish, able to make only short leaps, very visible on vegetation. Outbreaks leading to this species damaging cultivated crops are uncommon. When A. miliaris (of either sex) is disturbed or grabbed, it emits a sharp rasping noise from its thoracic segments. If its thorax is pinched, it also squirts a clear viscous mucus with unpleasant smell and a bitter taste, faintly alkaline, with many embedded bubbles. This foam comes out as a strong jet from apertures in the thorax, and more gently from other openings in the body (ten in total); it heaps up around the insect and partly covers it. Conservation Autarchies miliaris, like most other grasshoppers, are considered a pest in agricultural areas; however it is also endangered or near threatened in South India. A. miliaris lays eggs in the soil which aerates the soil promoting biodiversity and creates ecosystem value. Their interactions and natural process contribute to the health of the soil. The presence of a variety of insects in the soil are indicators of soil quality. There are a few conservation efforts for this species. At times of high population, growth can be controlled by tilling the area where they deposit their egg pods or collecting the grasshoppers; pesticides are effective; however they are normally not environmentally friendly and can cause damage to other animals and vegetation.

A portion of the state park occupies the site of the lost village of Hopeville. The park manager's house occupies Avery House, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The park offers fishing, swimming, camping, and trails for hiking and biking. It is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.  History  Before European colonization, the Mohegan people constructed stone weirs to harvest fish from the Pachaug River. The weirs directed water flow and fish to the center of the stream for easy capture in fishing baskets. ;Village In 1711, Stephen Gates was granted 14 acres of land lying within the modern state park's boundaries. Gates constructed a gristmill and sawmill, inundating the waterfall on the Pachaug River in the process. In 1818, Elizah Abel added a woolen mill to the site. Later, John Slater purchased the three mills and constructed a satinet mill which he named the \\"Hope Mill,\\" the village, pond and state park names all having subsequently derived from his inspiration. By 1840, Hopeville was a \\"thriving village\\" according to Daniel L. Phillips, author of Griswold - a history. On November 4, 1850, a meeting was held to discuss the construction of a house of worship. A church was erected for $1,700 and dedicated on December 12, 1852. The village of Hopeville reached its peak in 1860 and was well known for its production of woolens. In 1881, the mill, then owned by Edwin Lanthrop and Company, was destroyed in a fire and not rebuilt. The Ashland Cotton Company would later acquire the property. In 1900, the church and four houses also burned. In 1908, the original gristmill from 1711 was also destroyed by fire. Sometime before 1917, the Ashland Cotton Company erected a dam on the site and created the 145 acre reservoir; the dam was used to generate electrical power for its mills in Jewett City. ;Avery House The Avery House, also known as Hopeville Pond Park House, is a by , the two story central-chimney Colonial dating to circa 1770.

The alterations in the house changed the traditional five-room first floor plan by eliminating the keeping rooms and the removal of the kitchen fireplace. It retains much of its original door frames and wrought-iron latch hardware. After the rehabilitation of the property, the Avery House became the Hopeville Park manager's residence. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. and ;Park The Civilian Conservation Corps, encamped in nearby Pachaug State Forest, developed the state park in the 1930s. Their efforts included adapting the Avery House for park use. Hopeville Pond was designated as a state park in 1938.  Activities  The park's recreational activities include biking, hiking, camping, fishing, boating, and swimming. The park's campground features 80 campsites. Fish found in Hopeville Pond include channel catfish, northern pike, largemouth bass, chain pickerel, and yellow perch. Hopeville Pond was included in an 11-mile bike trail in Connecticut: Rides for the Casual Cyclist. The Lake Lubbers website states that Hopeville Pond is a popular location for fishing, including ice fishing.

She had her debut at the theatre in the Bournonville version of La Sylphide as the first sylph (1959). She was appointed soloist in 1964 and was promoted to 1st female soloist two years later, a title that had until then only been bestowed upon Margot Lander. After long periods of illness, she was dismissed from service shortly before her 25th anniversary where she would have appeared in a production of Livj√¶gerne p√• Amager in which she would have portrayed the character of Louise.  Dance career  Born on 2 March 1942 in Copenhagen, Denmark, Anna L√¶rkesen, who came from an officer family in S√∏borg, wished to dance from an early age. While most of her early life consisted of classical ballet training and educational studies at Danish schools, L√¶rkesen was ready to further her career upon growing older with little success in the past. At age 17 in 1959, she became a cadet of the prestigious Royal Danish Ballet in her hometown of Copenhagen, breaking the previous rule of all members only to be added from the company's own ballet school.‚ÄúDansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon - Anna L√¶rkesen.‚Äù Text, 15 May 2003. http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/1878/. With them, she was able to dance in many ballets alongside other advanced performers. Her Bournonville style of training from the company allowed her to dance beautifully in front of almost 2,000 people at the historic Royal Danish Theatre‚ÄúHistory  The Royal Danish Theatre.‚Äù Accessed 26 January 2015. . in Kongens Nytorv for many seasons. Even though she loved it, performing took a lot of hard work and dedication, but it was seven years later that her time paid off. At age 24, L√¶rkesen had been named a soloist of the Royal Danish Ballet,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/arts/dance-making-ballets-just-the- way-men-do.html a prominent position within any ballet company. This promotion opened many doors for her as a dancer, allowing her to star in more leading roles. Her most well-known role to date though remains in her spot as the principal dancer of the August Bournonville revival of Tanglioni‚Äôs La Sylphide. After her performance, L√¶rkesen starred as many more acclaimed characters for the next several years until a lifetime of brutal training began to take a toll on her body. It was at 42, in 1984, that she was forced to retire from ballet at an age considered far too old among ballerinas today.https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/arts/dance-making-ballets-just-the- way-men-do.html Her career was inspiring, and amongst those almost 25 years, she had starred in many well-known ballets.  Roles  As a ballerina, Anna L√¶rkesen found herself portraying a different character in many fascinating storylines. From her beginnings with the Royal Danish Ballet, her first starring role, and most-well known to date, remains as her portrayal as the first sylph in Bournonville‚Äôs La Sylphide.Dunning, Jennifer. ‚ÄúDANCE; Making Ballets, Just the Way Men Do.‚Äù The New York Times, 15 May 1994, sec.

Choreography career  After almost twenty five years with the Royal Danish Ballet, L√¶rkesen had to decide what would come next in her life, as she was only forty two years old. At the time, she had still been working with her former company and decided to participate in a dancers‚Äô workshop a few years later.https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/28/arts/review-city-ballet-choreography- by-two-ballerinas.html It was in those classes in 1988 that L√¶rkesen created her first piece of choreography for the company. Since then, she took on choreographing full-time, developing several more ballets for the Danish. In 1990, she produced a ballet entitled Patita that did well enough to air on a local television station in her home country of Denmark.Dunning, Jennifer. ‚ÄúDANCE; Making Ballets, Just the Way Men Do.‚Äù The New York Times, 15 May 1994, sec. Arts. https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/arts/dance-making-ballets-just- the-way-men-do.html. More choreographing led her to her debut with the New York City Ballet in 1994, where she developed a piece for the second addition of the showcase entitled the Diamond Project. Her dance, \\"In the Blue\\" exhibited a combination Brahms‚Äôs Violin Concerto and principal dancers including Wendy Whelan and fellow previous Royal Danish Ballet dancer L√¶rkesen‚Äôs choreography featured a wide expansion of movement across the entirety of the stage and no perceivable rule in which she followed. Most of her choreographed pieces ended up similar to the aforementioned, and she continued creating ballets with her own company and others, including the San Francisco Ballet and the Opera of Stockholm.‚ÄúDansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon - Anna L√¶rkesen.‚Äù Text, 15 May 2003. http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/1878/.

Intuitively, it states that a set of points that is large in its Hausdorff dimension must determine a set of distances that is large in measure. More precisely, if S is a compact set of points in d-dimensional Euclidean space whose Hausdorff dimension is strictly greater than d/2, then the conjecture states that the set of distances between pairs of points in S must have nonzero Lebesgue measure. Formulation and motivation proved that Borel sets with Hausdorff dimension greater than (d+1)/2 have distance sets with nonzero measure.. See in particular the remarks following Corollary 2.3. Although this paper is widely cited as its origin, the Falconer conjecture itself does not appear in it. He motivated this result as a multidimensional generalization of the Steinhaus theorem, a previous result of Hugo Steinhaus proving that every set of real numbers with nonzero measure must have a difference set that contains an interval of the form (-\\\\varepsilon,\\\\varepsilon) for some \\\\varepsilon>0.. It may also be seen as a continuous analogue of the Erd≈ës distinct distances problem, which states that large finite sets of points must have large numbers of distinct distances. Partial results proved that compact sets of points whose Hausdorff dimension is greater than \\\\tfrac{d}{2} + \\\\tfrac{1}{3} have distance sets with nonzero measure; for large values of d this approximates the threshold on Hausdorff dimension given by the Falconer conjecture.. For points in the Euclidean plane, a variant of Falconer's conjecture states that a compact set whose Hausdorff dimension is greater than or equal to one must have a distance set of Hausdorff dimension one. Falconer himself showed that this is true for compact sets with Hausdorff dimension at least 3/2, and subsequent results lowered this bound to 4/3... It is also known that, for a compact planar set with Hausdorff dimension at least one, the distance set must have Hausdorff dimension at least 1/2.. In 2018, Guth, Iosevich, Ou and Wang (arXiv:1808.09346) proved that if the Hausdorff dimension of a planar set is greater than 5/4, then there exists a point in the set such that the Lebesgue measure of the distances from the set to this point is positive. Related conjectures Proving a bound strictly greater than 1/2 for the dimension of the distance set in the case of compact planar sets with Hausdorff dimension at least one would be equivalent to resolving several other unsolved conjectures. These include a conjecture of Paul Erd≈ës on the existence of Borel subrings of the real numbers with fractional Hausdorff dimension, and a variant of the Kakeya set problem on the Hausdorff dimension of sets such that, for every possible direction, there is a line segment whose intersection with the set has high Hausdorff dimension.. Other distance functions For non-Euclidean distance functions in the plane defined by polygonal norms, the analogue of the Falconer conjecture is false: there exist sets of Hausdorff dimension two whose distance sets have measure zero...

Shortly after, the hurricane made landfall as a slightly weaker storm just southeast of Fort Pierce, Florida at 0700 UTC on August 8\\\\. Weakening as it moved across the Florida peninsula over the course of the next day, the storm briefly moved over the Gulf of Mexico before recurving northwards. Thus, it made a second landfall on the Florida Panhandle on August 10 as a tropical storm. Once inland, the system continued to weaken, degenerating to tropical depression strength before transitioning into an extratropical storm later that day. The extratropical remnants progressed outwards into the Atlantic Ocean before entirely dissipating by August 14\\\\. In its early developmental stages north of the Greater Antilles, the storm caused minor damage to shipping in The Bahamas and generated rough seas offshore Cuba. At its first landfall on Fort Pierce, the hurricane caused extensive property damage, particularly in coastal regions, where numerous homes were unroofed. Central Florida's citrus crop was hampered by the strong winds and heavy rain. Several of Florida's lakes, including Lake Okeechobee, rose past their banks, inundating coastal areas. Damage to infrastructure was less in inland regions than at the coast, though power outages caused loss of communication statewide. At the hurricane's second landfall, wind damage was relatively minor, though torrential rainfall, aided by orthographic lift, caused extensive flooding as far north as the Mid-Atlantic states. Overall, the hurricane caused $235,000 in damages, primarily in Florida, and two deaths. Meteorological history A tropical disturbance was first identified north of the Leeward Islands near the Virgin Islands at 0000 UTC on August 3\\\\. Due to a lack of conclusive weather reports from nearby areas at the time, the origins of the tropical storm were initially unknown, but listed the system as forming near Trinidad and Barbados in the HURDAT‚Äîthe database listing all tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin since 1851. However, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project analyzed the storm to have formed north of the Leeward Islands based on reports from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and as such revised the storm's HURDAT listing. Moving to the west-northwest, the tropical storm maintained its intensity without any intensification early in its existence. Ships in the region reported tropical storm-force winds and low barometric pressures. The ship S.S. Sixaola sent a telegraphic report of the storm's location and existence west of Acklins Island on August 5, the first ship to explicitly do so. Beginning to accelerate as it paralleled the Cuban Atlantic coast the following day, the storm intensified to reach an intensity equivalent to a modern-day Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC. The hurricane continued to intensify, and attained Category 2 hurricane intensity by 0600 UTC on August 7\\\\. At around the same time, the S.S. Lempira reported a minimum pressure of 971 mbar (hPa; 28.70 inHg), while 30 miles (50 km) southeast of Jupiter, Florida. At the time, maximum sustained winds were estimated at 105 mph (170 km/h); this would be the hurricane's peak intensity. The hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall on central Florida, just southeast of Fort Pierce, Florida, at 0700 UTC the following day. Winds at landfall were estimated at 100 mph (160 km/h), with a minimum central pressure of 977 mbar (28.85 inHg) recorded in Fort Pierce within the hurricane's eye. At the time, the system's maximum winds extended up to 10 mi (15 km) from the center of circulation. The storm then slowly crossed the Florida peninsula, before entering the Gulf of Mexico the next day near Tampa, Florida, after having weakened down to tropical storm strength. Despite remaining over water, its close proximity to the continent prevented further strengthening. The tropical storm recurved to the north in the gulf, before making a second landfall near Apalachicola, Florida at 0400 UTC on August 10 with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as it continued to recurve to the northeast, further degenerating to tropical depression strength at 0000 UTC on August 11 while situated over Georgia. Based on weather station observations, the storm was analyzed to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The extratropical storm strengthened slightly over the Mid- Atlantic states, before exiting into the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia Capes. The storm system progressed eastward across the ocean before dissipating at 1800 UTC on August 14\\\\. Preparations and impact alt=Black and white contoured map showing rainfall amounts as contours, in 3 in (75 mm) increments from 3 in (75 mm) to 15 in (380 mm). =The Bahamas and Cuba= Passing through The Bahamas on August 6‚Äì7, the tropical storm caused minor damage on the islands. Due to the rough seas, ships were taken to Nassau Harbor to ride out the storm. The storm passed without any disruption of shipping services. However, the flying boat Topsy Fish, containing two people, became lost over Bahamian waters on August 8\\\\. The plane and crew were later found north of Andros Island by a Miami relief plane and a boat from Nassau three days later. Cuba, located south of the storm throughout its duration, reported minimal effects from the hurricane, other than a lowering of barometric pressures as reported by Jos√© Carlos Mill√°s, then-chief of the Cuban National Observatory. However, occasional thunderstorm activity fueled by the hurricane dropped rainfall over the island, and the storm generated heavy seas at the Cuban coast. =Florida= Upon notification that a newly formed tropical cyclone was approaching the Florida coast, the Weather Bureau posted storm warnings for coastal areas between Key West and West Palm Beach, Florida. Later on August 6, warnings were lowered in Key West, but the warning area was extended north to Titusville, Florida. Vessels and small craft located offshore north of Miami, Florida were notified to advise caution for the oncoming tropical disturbance. As the storm approached the coast, more accurate forecasts allowed vessels to be cautioned as far north as Hatteras, North Carolina. Storm warnings between Jupiter and Daytona, Florida were upgraded to hurricane warnings on August 7, in accordance with the storm's upgrade to hurricane intensity. After moving inland, hurricane warnings were lowered, but emergency warnings for the storm's potential effects were posted for the interior of the Florida peninsula north of 28¬∞N the following day. Northwest storm warnings were issued in Tampa, while northeast storm warnings were issued from Tampa north to Apalachicola, Florida. All warnings were eventually lowered following the storm's dissipation. Approaching the Floridian coast as an intensifying hurricane, the storm initially turned away from the peninsula for a short period of time on August 7, after nearly making landfall on West Palm Beach. Strong gusts of at least 30 mph (50 km/h) and squally weather impacted the city, but did not cause any damage. However, telecommunications in the city were temporarily disrupted due to the storm. In Jupiter, stronger gusts reaching 60 mph (100 km/h) were reported, but did not cause any damage as well. However, the hurricane's recurvature offshore was short lived, and the system eventually made its landfall near Fort Pierce, Florida early on August 8\\\\. Offshore, the USAHS Algonquin, a cruise ship belonging to the Clyde-Mallory cruise line, was caught in the storm, but managed to reach its destination of New York, New York without any major problems. The Honduran freighter Lempira, which had also recorded the lowest barometric pressure associated with the hurricane, experienced considerable damage due to the strong seas. The ship lost all of its lifeboats, and as a result the United Fruit Company line was sent to accompany the damaged ship. Inland, damage was concentrated in an area extending from Jupiter to the border between Florida and Georgia. The hurricane's landfall on the peninsula was attended by torrential rainfall, which damaged crops, particularly citrus. Rainfall peaked at in St. Cloud over a five-day period from August 7‚Äì12. There, the nearby East Lake Tohopekaliga began to overflow, threatening property and crops. Losses to the citrus crop were estimated by the Florida Citrus Exchange to be equivalent to 1 million boxes of citrus. However, damage to citrus in the Kissimmee area was comparatively less, and was limited to unripe fruit. Lake Okeechobee's water level rose by as a result of floodwater rushing into the lake. Damage along the lake's shores mostly occurred to the north. To the south, in Clewiston, minor damage was confined to trees and windows. Two deaths occurred in the vicinity of the Indian River; these were the only deaths associated with the hurricane in the state. Numerous highways were also washed out by the rains, especially on Florida's south-central east coast. Portions of State Road 4 were covered in debris strewn by strong winds. Damage to the state's road systems was estimated at $100,000 by the former Florida State Highway Commission. Bridges were also badly damaged, with some needing replacement. Alongside the heavy rainfall, strong winds were reported. Large live oak trees were uprooted, especially in Osceola, Brevard, Orange, and Marion counties in Florida. Initial estimates of property damage in several cities on Florida's mid-eastern coast reached $5 million, though this was later drastically scaled down. In Sebastian, winds were estimated at 100 mph (160 km/h). Due to the high winds, rail service on the Florida East Coast Railway was halted north of Jupiter after winds became unsuitable for continued travel. Portions of the railway were also flooded in water. The train station in Fort Pierce was later unroofed. Many of the state's coastal beaches suffered from window damage and damage to vegetation caused by strong winds. An estimated 75% of structures in Fort Pierce and 50% of structures in Vera were estimated to have been damaged by the strong winds, particularly in the form of torn roofs. A report suggested that damage from those two cities reached at least $1 million. The strong winds also hampered telephone and telegraph networks across the state, with losses as a result in excess of $1,000. Power transmission lines belonging to the Florida Power & Light Company were downed, causing a widespread power outage along the coast from Titusville to West Palm Beach. Thus, services requiring electric power were postponed until power was later restored. In Stuart, failure of the electric pumps led to loss of telecommunications and the local water supply. In Melbourne, additional power lines were downed, and buildings experienced awning damage. Portions of Central Florida also saw considerable damage. In Winter Haven, winds were reported to have reached 75 mph (120 km/h), before power was cut. A hotel in the city collapsed, and numerous houses were unroofed. Property damage in Kissimmee and Haines City was severe, with many collapsed buildings. In Haines City, a large garage collapsed, destroying automobiles parked within. Nearby in Lakeland, there was less damage, though winds estimated at tore signs and awnings. Effects of the storm in Tampa were comparatively less, though a lack of communications between the city and other locations led to speculation that Tampa had been severely hit. At nearby Clearwater, Florida, boats were run aground at the harbor, causing some damage. Similar conditions were felt in Ocala, though in some suburban areas trees were felled by the strong winds. Bus service in the area was delayed due to debris covering roadways. =Elsewhere in the United States= Upon the hurricane's second landfall on the Florida Panhandle on August 10, wind effects were much less significant, though the storm dropped widespread rainfall throughout its remaining path. Aided by orthographic lift from the Appalachian Mountains, the rainfall caused numerous reports of flood damage across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states. For any given area of land affected by the storm, the maximum average rainfall was . In southern and central Georgia, flood warnings were issued due to the potential for flood impacts late on August 10\\\\. In Macon, Georgia, 8.5 in (216 mm) of rain was recorded in a 16-hour period. The Ocmulgee River, which runs through Macon, began to rise past flood stage as a result, causing the lower areas of the city to be inundated. Trees were also downed due to strong winds. Portions of the Central of Georgia Railway were washed out, forcing trains to be redirected. In Thomasville, Georgia, highways leading to Florida were rendered impassable due to blocking debris. In Valdosta, Georgia, a torn roof cut through several power lines, causing electrical disruptions in the city. Similar impacts were felt in Augusta, Georgia, where strong winds toppled trees, damaged cottages, and severed telecommunication lines. Five people there were injured. In addition, a tornado occurred nearby, damaging houses and flattening trees. Further east in the Carolinas, five people were killed in the Piedmont region due to floods caused by the passing storm. Torrential rainfall in the area resulted in disruption of power, communications, and traffic. Precipitation in those two states peaked at 9 in (230 mm) in western North Carolina. In South Carolina, the heavy rainfall forced the issuance of flood warnings on the rising Santee River and its tributaries. The Broad and Congaree Rivers in South Carolina later set high water level records due in part to the saturated soils caused by the storm. The storm reached Virginia by August 12, resulting in additional flooding. A weather station in Richmond, Virginia recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg). There, the James and Rivanna Rivers exceeded their respective flood stages, washing out peripheral crops. Offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, over 100 people were rescued after rough waves swept them away. Moderate gales associated with the storm were reported as far north as New York.

Life Brawand, who came from a modest background, lost his father, a mountain guide, at the age of four when he was killed by lightning at the top of the Wetterhorn. After Brawand had graduated from the Lehrerseminar (school for teachers) in Hofwil, he worked as a primary school teacher, a small farmer, rancher and cattle breeder, and very intensively as a guide, especially for climbers from Japan. As a mountaineer, he made a name for himself with the first ascent of the Mittellegigrat (the northeast ridge of the Eiger) on 10 September 1921, serving as guide for Maki Y≈´k≈ç along with fellow guides Fritz Amatter and Fritz Steuri. Brawand's first political position was a Gemeinderat (municipal council) seat held in Grindelwald. From 1933 to 1935 he belonged to the Grand Council of Bern and from 1935 to 1947 to the National Council (the second chamber of the Federal Assembly). During World War II Brawand presided over the Begnadigungskommission (Clemency Commission) of the National Council. From 1947 to 1962, Brawand was a member of the Conseil d'Etat of the Canton of Bern and headed the governing body for building and railway management. From 1950 to 1951 and from 1961 to 1962 he was President of the Conseil d'Etat (i.e. head of government) of Bern. From July 1962 to June 1968 Brawand was director of the Bern-L√∂tschberg-Simplon railway (BLS). From 1955 to 1967 he again served in the National Council.

Its route is similar to the Rheintal/Walgau Autobahn from the border between Lindau and H√∂rbranz to Bludenz, where it connects to the Arlberg Railway. The entire route is owned and operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñsterreichische Bundesbahnen, √ñBB). The Vorarlberg Railway is the western continuation of the Arlberg Railway (√ñBB timetable number AT 401) through the Walgau valley and the Vorarlberg section of the Rhine Valley. History =Planning phase= Already in 1847, the entrepreneur Carl Ganahl, later the main proponent of the railway construction in the Vorarlberg, recognised the importance of a railway line in the Vorarlberg, although there were many problems with this idea. No mountain railway, which would be needed to cross the Arlberg, had yet been built in Austria and a line with no connection to the Tyrolean areas seemed useless. Moreover, Vorarlberg was not an independent crown land of Austria-Hungary, and thus possessed no representatives in the Imperial Council (Reichsrat) in Vienna. Operations commenced on the Bavarian Ludwig South-North Railway to Lindau in 1853 and the Swiss lines from Rorschach to Rheineck and from Rheineck to Chur opened in 1857. On the Austrian side the line from Kufstein to Innsbruck via W√∂rgl was connected to the railway network in 1859. In 1856, the president of the newly formed association now called the Vorarlberg Chamber of Trade and Commerce, Carl Ganahl signed a petition for approval of the preliminary work. He allowed only two years for the preparation of the first detailed design for the project, which he paid for out of his own pocket. In the same year he made a formal application for a license for the project to the Imperial and Royal (kaiserlich und k√∂niglich) Ministry of Commerce. There the application was postponed temporarily because consultation had to be held first with the neighbouring states. This meant that it would be as late as 1865 before the signing of treaties could be concluded. Previously, in 1864, the Ministry of Commerce had submitted a railway construction program that would also include for the first time the construction of a line from Innsbruck to Dornbirn. In March 1867, the first concept of the Vorarlberg side was submitted, which would also accommodate the construction of a tunnel between St. Anton and Langen. The Imperial Council approved the application in 1867, but construction began only on 1 May 1869. =Implementation and construction= After Carl Ganahl prevailed over two other competitors for the construction contract, work began on the construction of the first railway line in the Vorarlberg in October 1870. The bulk of the construction was carried out in 1871 as some sections could only be built after objections had been dealt with. The newly created corporation of the Royal Vorarlberg Railway (k. k. priv. Vorarlberger Bahn), a Vienna-based company received its license from the Companies Registry on 5 May 1871, its statutes were approved on 9 June, its constitution on 3 July and it was entered in the companies register on 8 July. (at Austrian National Library in Fraktur script) It would have a virtually unlimited capital, since its shares were oversubscribed twenty times. The first ceremonial run on the Bludenz‚ÄìLochau line was hauled by a steam locomotive, which had been given the name of Bregenz, on 30 June 1872. Finally, the line was handed over for public service on 1 July 1872. The railway was finally connected to the rest of the Austrian railway network by the construction of the Arlberg Railway Tunnel in 1884. The link to Buchs and to Lindau opened on 14 October 1872 and the connection to St. Margrethen opened on 23 November 1872. The first continuous express ran on the route on 1 November 1873, running on the route from Z√ºrich to Munich. The Vorarlberg Railway‚Äôs connection with the rest of the Austrian railway network also meant the end of its era of independence as it became state-owned. The railway line was completely electrified in 1954. The section from Bludenz to Feldkirch was duplicated in 1991, followed by the line Feldkirch to Bregenz in 1995. The section from Lochau/H√∂rbranz to Bregenz-Hafen is still only single-track. Construction and engineering The main route of the line, with the exception of the Bregenz‚ÄìLochau section, is duplicated and fully electrified, while the section from the state border to Lindau Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) represents a special case in that the overhead electrical line was built by the √ñBB workshop in Bludenz to German regulations. As there is no connection in Germany to the German railway electrical network this section is supplied with current from Austria. For this reason (and because Lindau station is a terminal station) almost all international trains must switch from the electrical locomotives of Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) or √ñBB to the diesel locomotives of Deutsche Bahn (or vice versa) in Lindau. Feldkirch‚ÄìBuchs connecting line At the northern end of Feldkirch station a single-track, electrified, 18.5 km line branches to Buchs from Bregenz. Although this line runs through the territory of Liechtenstein and Switzerland, it is completely operated and maintained by the √ñBB. In Buchs comes it connects with the St. Gallen‚ÄìSt. Margrethen‚ÄìSargans‚ÄìChur line of the SBB. Together with that part of the main line from Bludenz to Feldkirch, this connecting line is also an important part of the east-west EuroCity connection between Vienna and Zurich. However, a change direction in Buchs and a change locomotives from √ñBB to SBB (or vice versa) is also required.  Lauterach‚ÄìSt. Margrethen link In the area of Lauterach station a triangular junction was created to connect to Switzerland. The link from Feldkirch to Switzerland is only used by freight trains to Switzerland or to the petroleum storage of OMV in Lustenau, while the link from Bregenz is used primarily by passenger trains and is part of the major route between Munich and Zurich. In St.Margrethen the line connects to the St. Gallen‚ÄìSt. Margrethen‚ÄìSargans‚ÄìChur line of the SBB. Towards St. Gallen no change in direction of the train is required and most international trains between Switzerland and Germany are drawn by SBB locomotives, which have special pantographs for √ñBB and DB lines.

Starting with, profit equals sales minus costs, it provides a structure for modeling cost elements such as materials, losses, multi-products, learning, depreciation etc. It provides a mutable conceptual base for spreadsheet modelers. This enables them to run deterministic simulations or 'what if' modelling to see the impact of price, cost or quantity changes on profitability. Basic model : \\\\pi = pq - (F_n+wq) \\\\, where: : is profit : p is sales price : Fn is fixed costs : w is variable costs per unit sold : q is quantity sold For an expansion of the model see below.  Background  The justification for wanting to express profit as an algebraic model is given by Mattessich in 1961: :'To some operations analysts the mere translation of accounting models into mathematical :terminology, without a calculus for determining an optimum, might appear to be a rather :pedestrian task. We are convinced, however, that as long as accounting methods are acceptable :to the industry the mere change to a mathematical formulation will be advantageous for :several reasons: (1) it can be considered a prerequisite for applying electronic data :processing to certain accounting problems, (2) it articulates the structure of the accounting :models and illuminates accounting methods from a new point of view, revealing many facets so :far neglected or unobserved, (3) it enables a general and hence more scientific presentation :of many accounting methods, (4) it facilitates the exploration of new areas, thereby :accelerating the advancement of accounting, (5) it leads to more sophisticated methods and :might help to lay the foundations for close cooperation of accounting with other areas of :management science.'Mattessich, R. (1961). 'Budgeting models and system simulation', The Accounting Review, 36(3), 384‚Äì397. Most of the definitions in cost accounting are in an unclear narrative form, not readily associated with other definitions of accounting calculations. For example, preparing a comparison of fixed cost variances in stock under different stock valuation methods can be confusing. Another example is modelling labour variances with learning curve corrections and stock level changes. With the absence of a basic profit model in an algebraic form, confident development of such models is difficult. The development of spreadsheets has led to a decentralisation of financial modelling. This has often resulted in model builders lacking training in model construction. Before any professional model is built it is usually considered wise to start by developing a mathematical model for analysis. The profit model provides a general framework plus some specific examples of how such an a priori profit model might be constructed. The presentation of a profit model in an algebraic form is not new. Mattessich's model, while large, does not include many costing techniques such as learning curves and different stock valuation methods. Also, it was not presented in a form that most accountants were willing or able to read. This paper presents a more extended model analysing profit but it does not, unlike Mattessich, extend to the balance sheet model. Its form, of starting with the basic definition of profit and becoming more elaborate, may make it more accessible to accountants. Most cost accounting textbooks Drury, C. (1988). Management and Cost Accounting, London: V.N.R explain basic Cost Volume Profit modeling in an algebraic form, but then revert to an 'illustrative' Ijiri, Y. (1983). 'New dimensions in accounting education: computers and algorithms,' Issues In Accounting Research, 168‚Äì173. approach. This 'illustrative' approach uses examples or narrative to explain management accounting procedures. This format, though useful when communicating with humans, can be difficult to translate into an algebraic form, suitable for computer model building. Mepham Mepham, M. (1980). Accounting Models, London: Pitmans extended the algebraic, or deductive, approach to cost accounting to cover many more techniques. He develops his model to integrate with the optimizing models in operations research. The profit model comes out of Mephams work, extending it but only in a descriptive, linear form.  Model extensions  The basic profit model is sales minus costs. Sales are made up of quantity sold multiplied by their price. Costs are usually divided between Fixed costs and variable costs. Using: * Sales revenue = pq = price √ó quantity sold * Cost of sales = wq = unit cost √ó quantity sold *Administration, selling, engineers, personnel etc. = Fn = fixed post-manufacturing overheads *Profit = œÄ Thus the profit can be calculated from: : \\\\pi = pq - (F_n + wq) \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (1) Notice that w (average unit production cost) includes the fixed and variable costs. The square brackets contain the cost of goods sold, wq not cost of good made wx where x = cost of good sold. To show cost of good sold, the opening and closing finished goods stocks need to be included The profit model would then be: * Opening stock = go w = opening stock quantity √ó unit cost * Cost of stock = g1 w = closing stock quantity √ó unit cost * Cost of production = wx = unit production cost √ó quantity made: : \\\\pi = pq - [F_n + wx + g_0 w - g_1 w] \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (2) Presenting the profit calculation in this form immediately demands that some of the costs be more carefully defined. = Production costs = The unit production costs (w) can be separated into fixed and variable costs: : w = \\\\frac{F_m + vx}{x} \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (3) where * Fm = manufacturing fixed costs; * v = variable costs per unit; * x = production quantity. The introduction of this separation of w allows for consideration of the behaviour of costs for different levels of production. A linear cost curve is assumed here, divided between the constant (F) and its slope (v). If the modeller has access to the details of non-linear cost curves then w will need to be defined by the appropriate function. Replacing wx in (equation 2) and making F = Fn + Fm: : \\\\pi = pq - [F + vx + g0w - g1w] \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (4) = Variable-cost elements = Moving on to other extensions of the basic model, the cost elements such as direct materials, direct labour and variable overheads can be included. If a non-linear function is available and thought useful such functions can be substituted for the functions used here. The material cost of sales = m * ¬µ * q, where m is the amount of material in one unit of finished goods. ¬µ is the cost per unit of the raw material. The labour cost of sales = l Œª q, where * l is the amount of labour hours required to make one unit of finished goods * Œª is the labour cost (rate) per hour. The variable overhead cost of sales = nq where n is the variable overhead cost per unit. This is not here subdivided between quantity per finished goods units and cost per unit. Thus the variable cost v * q can now be elaborated into: : œÄ = pq - [F+(m¬µ q + l Œªq + nq)] ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶(equation 5) If the production quantity is required the finished goods stock will need to be added. In a simple case two materials can be accommodated in the model by simply adding another m * ¬µ. In more realistic situations a matrix and a vector will be necessary (see later). If material cost of purchases is to be used rather than material cost of production it will be necessary to adjust for material stocks. That is, : mx = md0 \\\\+ mb - md1‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ (equation 6) where * d = material stock quantity, * 0 = opening, 1 = closing, * b = quantity of material purchased * m = the amount of material in one unit of finished goods * x = quantity used in production = Depreciation = All depreciation rules can be stated as equations representing their curve over time. The reducing balance method provides one of the more interesting examples. Using c = cost, t = time, L = life, s = scrap value, Fd = time based depreciation: : Depr/yr = Fd = c (s/c)(t-L)/L * [L(s/c)1/L] ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ (equation 7) This equation is better known as the rule: Depreciation per year = Last year's written down value multiplied by a constant % The limits are 0 < t < L, and the scrap value has to be greater than zero. (For zero use 0.1). Remembering that time-based depreciation is a fixed cost and usage-based depreciation can be a variable cost, depreciation can easily be added into the model (equation 5). Thus, the profit model becomes: : œÄ = pq - [F + Fd \\\\+ (m¬µ + lŒª + n + nd)q].......... (equation 8) where, nd = usage (as q) based depreciation and œÄ = annual profit. = Stock valuation = In the above, the value of the unit finished goods cost ‚Äòw' was left undefined. There are numerous alternatives to how stock (w) is valued but only two will be compared here. The marginal versus absorption costing debate, includes the question of the valuation of stock (w). Should w = v or as (3) w = (Fm + v x)/x. (i) Under marginal costing: w = v. Inserting in (4), : œÄ = pq- [F + v x + g0w0 \\\\- g1 w1] Becomes : œÄ = pq- [F + v x + g0w0 \\\\- g1 v] This can be simplified by taking v out and noting, opening stock quantity + production - closing stock quantity = sales quantity (q) so, : œÄ = p q - [F + v q]‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. (equation 9) Note, v q = variable cost of goods sold. (ii) Using full (absorption) costing Using (equation 3), where xp = planned production, x1 = period production w = (Fm + v xp)/xp = Fm/xp + v. This can be shown to result in: : œÄ = p q - [Fn \\\\+ Fm \\\\+ v q + Fm/xp * (q-x1)]‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..(equation 10) Note the strange presence of 'x' in the model. Notice also that the absorption model (equation 10) is the same as the marginal costing model (equation 9) except for the end part: : F/xp * (q-x1) This part represents the fixed costs in stock. This is better seen by remem¬¨bering q ‚Äî x= go‚Äîg1 so it could be written :F/xp ‚Ä¢ (g0‚Äîg1) The model form with 'q' and 'x' in place of' g0 and g1 allows profits to be calculated when only the sales and production figures are known. A spreadsheet could be prepared for a company with increasing then decreasing levels of sales and constant production. It could have another column showing profit under increasing sales and constant production. Thus the effects of carrying fixed costs in stock can be simulated. Such modelling thus provides a very useful tool in the marginal versus full costing debate. = Modelling for losses = One way of modeling for losses is to use: *Fixed losses, (quantity) = Œ¥f, *Variable losses (%) = Œ¥v, *Material losses = mŒ¥, *Production losses = pŒ¥ The model, with all these losses together will look like, : œÄ = v q ‚Äì [F + ¬µ * mŒ¥f + {m¬µ(1 + mŒ¥v) + lŒª+n) * (1+ pŒ¥* (q +pŒ¥f)]........ (equation 11) Note that labour and variable overhead losses could also have been included. = Multi- products = So far the model has assumed very few products and/or cost elements. As many firms are multi-product the model they use must be able to handle this problem. Whilst the mathematics here is straightforward the accounting problems introduced are enormous: the cost allocation problem being a good example. Other examples include calculation of break-even points, productivity measures and the optimisation of limited resources. Here only the mechanics of building a multi-dimension model will be outlined. If a firm sells two products (a and b) then the profit model (equation 9), : œÄ = pq ‚Äî(F +vq) becomes : œÄ = (pa *qa +pb *qb) - [F + va*qa + vb *qb] All fixed costs have been combined in F Therefore, for multiple products : œÄ = Œ£(pq) - [F + Œ£(vq)].... (equation 12) Where Œ£ = the sum of. Which can be drafted as a vector or matrix in a spreadsheet or : œÄ = Œ£pq - [F + Œ£(Œ£mŒº +Œ£lŒª + Œ£n)q]..... (equation 13) = Variances = The profit model may represent actual data (c), planned data (p)or standard data (s) which is the actual sales quantities at the planned costs. The actual data model will be (using equation 8): : œÄ = pc*qc \\\\- [Fc \\\\+ (m¬µc \\\\+ lŒªc \\\\+ nc)qc] The planned data model will be (using equation 8): : œÄ = pp*qp \\\\- [Fp \\\\+ (m¬µp \\\\+ lŒªp \\\\+ np)qp] The standard data model will be (using equation 8): : œÄ = pp*qc \\\\- [Fp \\\\+ (m¬µp \\\\+ lŒªp \\\\+ np)qc] Operating variances are obtained by subtracting the actual model from the standard model. = Learning Curve Model = It is possible to add non linear cost curves to the Profit model. For example, if with learning, the labour time per unit will decrease exponentially over time as more product is made, then the time per unit is: : l = r * q‚àíb where r = average time. b = learning rate. q = quantity. Inserting into equation 8 : œÄ = pq - [F + (m¬µ + rq‚àíbŒª + n)q] This equation is best solved by trial and error, the Newton Raphson method or graphing. Like depreciation within the model, the adjustment for learning does provide a form of non-linear sub-modelling. = Percentage Change Model = Rather than the variable be absolute amounts, they might be percentage changes. This represents a major change in approach from the model above. The model is often used in the 'now that ... (say) the cost of labour has gone up by 10%' format. If a model can be developed that only uses such percentage changes then the cost of collecting absolute quantities will be saved.Eilon, S. (1984), The Art of Reckoning: analysis of performance criteria, London: Academic Press The notation used below is of attaching a % sign to variables to indicate the change of that variable, for example, p% = 0.10 if the selling price is assumed to change by 10%, Let x = q and C = contribution Starting with the absolute form of the contribution model (equation (9) rearranged): : œÄ + F = C = (p ‚Äî v)q. The increase in the contribution which results from an increase in p, v and/or q can be calculated thus: : C(l + C%) = [p(l+p%)- v(l + v%)]q(l+q%) rearranging and using Œ± = (p ‚Äî v)/p, : C% = ((l+q%)/Œ±)[p%-(l - Œ±)v%]+q%...... (equation 18) This model might look messy but it is very powerful. It makes very few demands on data, especially if some of the variables do not change. It is possible to develop most of the models presented above in this percentage change format.

It is one of the three original residence halls that date from when the University was founded in 1921, and like them is modelled on the colleges of the University of Oxford, a complex of buildings including residences, meeting rooms, dining rooms, a prayer hall, gardens, and sporting facilities. Of the approximately 2000 students of the hall, half live in the residences, and half are non-residential students affiliated with the college. Several professors at the university hold the positions of house tutors and provost at the hall. The hall includes four residential buildings: * Govinda Chandra Dev building * Sontosh Chandra Bhattacharya Bhavan (New Building) * October Memorial Building (October Smiriti Bhaban) * Jyotirmoy Guhathakurta building History October Smriti Bhawan (October Memorial Building) Kisorilal Roy Chowdhury, the Zamindar of Baliati in Tangail, who had previously established Jagannath College named after his father Jagannath Saha, also established this hall of University of Dhaka. University of Dhaka was established in 1921 as a merger of the two institutes of higher learning that existed in the city at that time, Dhaka College, a government institution, and Jagannath College, which was privately funded. With the Jagannath College Act of the Indian Legislative Council (Act No XVI of 1920), that college was renamed as Jagannath Intermediate College, and the second- and third-year students (303 in all) were transferred to University of Dhaka the following year, along with many teachers and equipment such as library books. Two residence halls at Dhaka University were then named after the contributing colleges: Jagannath Hall and Dhaka Hall (since renamed Dr Muhammad Shahidullah Hall). The first Provost of this hall was Professor Naresh Chandra Sengupta, who served from 1921 to 1924. Other famous provosts include philosopher Govinda Chandra Dev (who served from 1957 to 1970) who was murdered by the occupying Pakistani army in 1971, along with the then current provost Professor Jyotirmoy Guhathakurta. =25 March 1971= Grave of the 1971 martyrs, in front of Jagannath Hall After midnight on 25 March 1971 the campaign of genocide against intellectuals by the Pakistani army took place in the Dhaka University area. Jagannath Hall could not be defended against this action, and many residential students and employees were killed on that night. Professor Jyotirmoy Guhathakura and Professor Govinda Chandra Dev, the former and current provosts, were also murdered at their apartments on Secretariat Road. =1985 Jagannath Hall tragedy= On 15 October 1985, a tragic accident occurred when the roof of the ancient assembly building of Jagannath Hall collapsed. It killed 39 people, students, employees and guests. Since then the day is observed as a day of mourning for the university. In 1988 the building was reconstructed as a residential building, and named October Memorial Building.

It was nominated as a well-preserved example of a board and batten Gothic Revival parish church. History St. Mark's Episcopal Chapel was founded in 1871 by Octavius Longworth and the Reverend David Buel Knickerbacker, who had both been members of St. Mark's Church in Brooklyn, New York. Longworth moved to Wright County, Minnesota, in 1859, while Knickerbacker had moved to Minneapolis in 1856 and become rector of Gethsemane Episcopal Church. Knickerbacker occasionally visited Longworth's house to conduct services. The two decided to establish a church in Wright County, so Longworth donated the land and built the structure. Construction started in 1871 and finished the following year, at which time Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple dedicated the building. Fifteen years later Bishop Whipple returned to consecrate the building.

Her parents placed great emphasis on the children's upbringing and Christian education. When her father died, she lived to the home of Lieutenant Colonel J√∏rgen Meding at Toten in Oppland, where she was influenced by the pietistic movement within Lutheranism. In 1733, she started a girl school in his parents' house which she had inherited. In 1737, she was visited by the Danish theologian Gert Hansen, who had been influenced by the teachings of John Hus and the Hussites revival. When Gert Hansen was arrested for not having submitted his passport to the police after his arrival, she arranged a demonstration at the town hall. She subsequently became the local leader of the Moravian movement (Br√∏dremenigheten) in Norway. She traveled between the different Moravian congregations scattered within Norway. Church of Norway authorities were soon aware of what was happening. Her religious activity are commonly considered to have contributed to restrictions on freedom of religion in both Norway and Denmark. King Christian VI of Denmark and Norway issued a Royal Decree (konventikkel) on January 13, 1741, which forbade future religious gatherings without the consent of Church parish priests. The ordinance remained in effect in Norway until abolished in 1842.
