He stole his employer's armored truck and money, and gave the cash or left it at the homes of his mother and two friends. Baumgartner was arrested the next day in British Columbia, as he made plans to cross the U.S. border. On September 9, 2013, Baumgartner plead guilty of three counts of murder, and on September 11, 2013, was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole for forty years, one of the longest or strictest prison sentences imposed on anyone in modern Canadian history. Details =Shooting= Several minutes into midnight, Baumgartner committed the crime while on duty at HUB Mall, a student residence and indoor food court, during a routine circuit with four coworkers to replenish ATMs around the city of Edmonton, as a part of their employment with G4S Cash Solutions. While refilling the TD ATMs, Baumgartner shot three of his coworkers with a .38-calibre revolver as they entered the secured vault located behind the machines, before locking them inside. He then approached the armored car they were using and shot and killed another co-worker. All of the four victims were shot in the back of the heads, at point blank range. He then stole the vehicle and fled the scene. Three of the workers died at the scene, while one survivor was brought to the hospital with critical injuries. The victims were Brian Ilesic, 35; Edgar \\"Eddie\\" Rejano, 39, and Michelle Shegelski, 26. A fourth guard, a male, was severely injured in the shootings, sustaining brain injuries. =Capture= A manhunt ensued as Baumgartner fled Edmonton, dropping off money for his two friends and mother. While at a friend's home, Baumgartner destroyed his cell phone so that it could not be used to track him. After eventually hearing news reports in the media, both friends notified police and returned the money. Baumgartner left $64,000 on his mother's kitchen table, and then left the Edmonton area. He swapped his licence plate for one from his mother‚Äôs vehicle and drove away, heading west to the resort town of Banff. There, he threw his weapon and vest into a river, and headed to the United States border, supposedly to Seattle, Washington. On June 16, 2012, 4:08 p.m. MDT (Edmonton time), Baumgartner was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection while he was trying to cross the border at the Port of Lyndon near Langley, British Columbia with $333,580 in cash. Travis Baumgartner At the time of the shooting, Travis Brandon Baumgartner (born May 16, 1991) was living in Sherwood Park, Alberta with his mother. Baumgartner had been hired by G4S Cash Solutions two months prior to the attack, and had no known disciplinary problems there. It is a requirement from the security agency to obtain a federal firearms licence, which includes a background check being run on the applicant. On June 1, 2012, Baumgartner posted the following status post on his Facebook account: ‚ÄúI wonder if I‚Äôd make the six o‚Äôclock news if I just started popping people off.‚Äù According to a friend, Baumgartner would tell him that he would rob his coworkers, in a jokingly manner. In a police interview, Baumgartner told a detective he did not get along with his coworkers, and that people at his workplace would ridicule him. At the time of the shooting, Baumgartner had 26 cents in his bank account and owed $58,000 to his mother and two friends, due to debt over the purchase of a car and other items, and that he felt he needed to owe money to a friend due to years of being \\"forked over\\" money by him. Trial and sentencing Several days after the killings, Baumgartner confessed to an undercover Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer in a British Columbia jail cell, saying: ‚ÄúI did it all. I killed those people and robbed their truck.‚Äù On June 20, Baumgartner was flown in a RCMP aircraft to Edmonton, where he was taken into Edmonton Remand Centre. The next day, Baumgartner appeared in court and was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, and four counts of robbery with a weapon. On September 9, 2013, Baumgartner pleaded guilty to the one charge of first-degree murder, for the death of Rejano, two counts of second-degree murder for the deaths of Ilesic and Shegelski, and a single charge of attempted murder. On September 11, he was sentenced by Associate Chief Justice John Rooke to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 40 years, until 2052. At the time of Baumgartner's sentencing, it was the harshest sentence imposed on anyone in the history of the Canadian judicial system, since the 1962 execution of Arthur Lucas, who was convicted of killing a police officer in Toronto.

Burg Square is a square and former fortress in Bruges. It is one of the main squares of the city.  History  The Burg was originally surrounded by walls and had entrance gates. It is one of the oldest parts of the city centre. The fortress was located at the meeting-point of the Oudenburg-Aardenburg Roman road (the Zandstraat) and the Reie canal. The fortress was around one hectare in size. Count Arnulf I of Flanders (889-965) extended the Bruges fortress to create a powerful, imperial administrative centre of one and a half hectares. Steen Castle, which was one of the residences of the Counts of Flanders, was located on the western side of the square from the 11th century until the end of the 13th century. The castle church‚Äîwhich was dedicated to Our Lady and Saint Donatian‚Äîwas built to the north, within the fortifications, and a chapter of canons was later established. This gave the fortress a dual purpose: the southern part served a civil purpose and the northern part was religious. When Bruges became a diocese in 1559, Saint Donatian‚Äôs Church became a cathedral. The demolition of the cathedral doubled the size of the square to around 1.1 hectares, making it even larger than the Markt. However, it remains divided into two distinct adjoining areas.  Current situation  Nowadays, the square is surrounded by historic buildings including the former Manor of the Franc of Bruges, the former Civil Registry, the City Hall, the Basilica of the Holy Blood and Saint Basil Chapel and the former Provostry of Saint Donatian.

Early Germanic culture refers to the culture of the early Germanic peoples. Largely derived from a synthesis of Proto-Indo-European and indigenous Northern European elements, the Germanic culture developed out of the Nordic Bronze Age. It came under significant external influence during the Migration Period, particularly from ancient Rome. The Germanic peoples eventually overwhelmed the Western Roman Empire, which by the Middle Ages facilitated their conversion from paganism to Christianity and the abandonment of their tribal way of life. Certain traces of early Germanic culture have survived among the Germanic peoples up to the present day. Languages Germanic dialect groups and their approximate distribution in northern Europe around thumbupright=1The approximate extent of Germanic languages in northern Europe in the early 10th century: Linguists postulate that an early Proto- Germanic language existed and was distinguishable from the other Indo-European languages as far back as 500 BCE. From what is known, the early Germanic tribes may have spoken mutually intelligible dialects derived from a common parent language but there are no written records to verify this fact. The Germanic tribes moved and interacted over the next centuries, and separate dialects among Germanic languages developed down to the present day. Some groups, such as the Suebi, have a continuous recorded existence, and so there is a reasonable confidence that their modern dialects can be traced back to those in classical times. By extension, but sometimes controversially, the names of the sons of Mannus, Istvaeones, Irminones, and Ingvaeones, are sometimes used to divide up the medieval and modern West Germanic languages. The more easterly groups such as the Vandals are thought to have been united in the use of East Germanic languages, the most famous of which is Gothic. The dialect of the Germanic people who remained in Scandinavia is not generally called Ingvaeonic, but is classified as North Germanic, which developed into Old Norse. Within the West Germanic group, linguists associate the Suebian or Hermionic group with an \\"Elbe Germanic\\" which developed into Upper German, including modern German. More speculatively, given the lack of any such clear explanation in any classical source, modern linguists sometimes designate the Frankish language (and its descendant Dutch) as Istvaeonic, although the geographical term \\"Weser-Rhine Germanic\\" is often preferred. However, the classical \\"Germani\\" near the Rhine, to whom the term was originally applied by Caesar, may not have even spoken Germanic languages, let alone a language recognizably ancestral to modern Dutch. The close relatives of Dutch, Low German, English and Frisian, are sometimes designated as Ingvaeonic, or alternatively, \\"North Sea Germanic\\". Frankish, (and later Dutch, Luxembourgish and the Frankish dialects of German in Germany) has continuously been intelligible to some extent with both \\"Ingvaeonic\\" Low German, and some \\"Suebian\\" High German dialects, with which they form a spectrum of continental dialects. All these dialects or languages appear to have formed by the mixing of migrating peoples after the time of Julius Caesar. So it is not clear if these medieval dialect divisions correspond to any mentioned by Tacitus and Pliny. Indeed, in Tacitus (Tac. Ger. 40) and in Claudius Ptolemy's Geography, the Anglii, ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons, are designated as being a Suebic tribe. Despite their common linguistic framework, by the 5th century CE, the Germanic peoples were linguistically differentiated and could no longer easily comprehend one another. Nonetheless, the line between Germanic and Romance peoples in central Europe remained at the western mouth of the Rhine river and while Gaul fell under Germanic domination and was firmly settled by the Franks, the linguistic patterns did not move much. Further west and south in Europe-proper, the linguistic presence of the Germanic languages is almost negligible. Despite the fact that the Visigoths ruled a kingdom in what is now Spain and Portugal for upwards of 250 years, there are almost no recognizable Gothic words borrowed into Spanish or Portuguese. By 500 CE, the West Germanic speakers had apparently developed a distinct language continuum with extensive loaning from Latin (due to their ongoing contact with the Romans), whereas the East Germanic languages were dying out. Literature Excerpt from Nj√°ls saga in the M√∂√∞ruvallab√≥k (AM 132 folio 13r) c. 1350. Germanic literature includes all the oral and written literature which was common to the early Germanic peoples, in respect to form and nature of content. It was generally intended to honor the gods or to praise tribal ancestors. The general public plays an insignificant role in Germanic literature, which revolves almost exclusively around chieftains, warriors and their associates. Wives and other female relatives of such leaders and warriors figure prominently in many pieces of Germanic literature. Germanic literature is divided into literature transferred orally from generation to generation and literature written down at a later date. Some of this literature, such as the Grottas√∂ngr, appears to have been passed down from a very early time. Much of what is known about Germanic literature was passed down by skalds and scops, who were poets employed by a chieftain to memorize his deeds and those of his ancestors. Priscus notes that such skalds were also prominent at the court of Attila. The structure of the verse and the rime system shows that Germanic poetry followed a distinct poetic form. A significant characteristic is the alliterative verse. Riddles figure prominently in both Anglo-Saxon and early Scandianvian literature. Important works are Germanic literature are Beowulf, the Nibelungenlied, and the Icelandic Eddas and sagas. Powerful individuals of the distant past figure prominently in Germanic literature. Such individuals include Julius Caesar, Attila, Ermanaric, Theodoric the Great and Charlemagne. Accounts of the history of the Goths play and important role in Germanic literature, and although the Goths themselves disappeared, their deeds were remembered for centuries afterwards among Germanic peoples living as far as Iceland. The works of Jordanes, Gregory of Tours, Paul the Deacon, Priscus and Saxo Grammaticus were written in Latin and Greek, but since their authors were of Germanic origin and because their works show traces of Germanic heritage, philologist Francis Owen considers these works part of Germanic literature as well. A large amount of Germanic epic literature must have been produced during the violent years of the Migration Period, but few of these accounts appear to have been preserved. During his reign, Charlemagne ordered a collection of the old heroic songs to be made, but this collection was later destroyed by order of Louis the Pious. A common theme in Germanic literature as the consequences of failing to live up to ones moral principles, and the moral dilemma faced by an individual struggling to maintain his loyalty under difficult conditions. A key theme is the attempt of the individual to overcome his fate, referred to as wyrd by the Anglo-Saxons. In Germanic literature, dark humor figures prominently. Scripts An inscription using cipher runes, the Elder Futhark, and the Younger Futhark, on the 9th-century R√∂k runestone in Sweden The earliest known Germanic inscription was found at Negau (in what is now southern Austria) on a bronze helmet dating back to the first century BCE. Some of the other earliest known physical records of the Germanic language appear on stone and wood carvings in Runic script from around 200 CE. Runes had a special significance in early Germanic culture, and each runic letter had a distinct name associated with a particular subject. The origins of runes has been a source of controversy. Runic writing likely disappeared due to the concerted opposition of the Christian Church, which regarded runic text as heathen symbols which supposedly contained inherent magical properties that they associated with the Germanic peoples' pagan past. Unfortunately, this primitive view ignores the abundance of \\"pious runic writing found on church-related objects\\" (ranging from inscriptions in the doorways of churches, on church bells and even those found on baptismal fonts) when Christianity was introduced into the Germanic North. An important linguistic step was made by the Christian convert Ulfilas, who became a bishop to the Thervingi Goths in CE 341; he subsequently invented a Gothic alphabet and translated the scriptures from Greek into Gothic, creating a Gothic Bible, which is the earliest known translation of the Bible into a Germanic language. Religion Prior to the Middle Ages, Germanic peoples followed what is now referred to as Germanic paganism: \\"a system of interlocking and closely interrelated religious worldviews and practices rather than as one indivisible religion\\" and as such consisted of \\"individual worshippers, family traditions and regional cults within a broadly consistent framework\\". The gilded side of the Trundholm Sun Chariot, Nordic Bronze Age Germanic religion was polytheistic in nature, with some underlying similarities to other Indo- European religions. Despite the unique practices of some tribes, there was a degree of cultural uniformity among the Germanic peoples concerning religion. From its earliest descriptions by Roman authors in antiquity to the Icelandic accounts written in the Middle Ages, Germanic religion appears to have changed considerably. =Origins= Germanic religion appears to have emerged as a synthesis of the religion of the Indo-Europeans who arrived with the Corded Ware culture and the indigenous populations among whom they settled. It is often suggested that the conflict between the √Üsir and Vanir, the two groups in the Norse branch of the Germanic pantheon, represents a remembrance of this synthesis. =Deities= Many of the deities found in Germanic paganism appeared under similar names across the Germanic peoples, most notably the god known to the Germans as Wodan or W≈çden, to the Anglo-Saxons as Woden, and to the Norse as √ì√∞inn, as well as the god Thor ‚Äì known to the Germans as Donar, to the Anglo-Saxons as √ûunor and to the Norse as √û√≥rr. Tacitus writes that the Germanic peoples primarily worshipped \\"Mercury\\", but also \\"Hercules\\" and \\"Mars\\". These have generally been identified with Odin, Thor and T√Ωr, the gods of wisdom, thunder and war respectively. T√Ωr appears to at one point have been the chief deity in the Germanic pantheon, but he was eventually displaced by Odin. =Rituals= Stone slab from The King's Grave in southern Sweden, Nordic Bronze Age, 1400 BC Archaeological findings suggest that the early Germanic peoples practiced some of the same 'spiritual' rituals as the Celts, including human sacrifice, divination, and the belief in spiritual connection with the natural environment around them. In Germanic religion, one distinguishes between household worship and community worship. This was similar to religious worship in Roman religion. In household worship the male head of the household would act as the \\"priest\\". Spiritual rituals frequently occurred in consecrated groves or upon islands on lakes where perpetual fires burned. The Germanic peoples did not construct temples to carry out their religious rites. =Priests= Unlike the Celts, who had their druids, there does not appear to have been a priestly caste among the Germanic peoples. There were however individuals who performed certain religious duties. This included carrying out sacrifices and punishing those found guilty of crimes against the tribe. Germanic priestesses were feared by the Romans, as these tall women with glaring eyes, wearing flowing white gowns often wielded a knife for sacrificial offerings. Captives might have their throats cut and be bled into giant cauldrons or have their intestines opened up and the entrails thrown to the ground for prophetic readings. =Afterlife= Germanic ideology and religious practices were pervaded and colored to a large degree by war, particularly the notion of a heroic death on the battlefield, as this brought the god(s) a \\"blood sacrifice.\\" =Conversion to Christianity= Christianity had no relevance for the pagan barbarians until their contact and integration with Rome. Pagan beliefs amid the Germanic tribes were reported by some of the earlier Roman historians and in the 6th century CE another instance of this appears when the Byzantine historian and poet, Agathias, remarked that the Alemannic religion was \\"solidly and unsophisticatedly pagan.\\" The Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Vandals were Christianized while they were still outside the bounds of the Empire; however, they converted to Arianism rather than Roman Catholicism, and were soon regarded as heretics by Catholics. The one great written remnant of the Gothic language is the Gothic Bible made by Wulfila, the Arian missionary who converted them. Goths, Vandals, and other Germanic peoples often offered political resistance prior to their conversion to Christianity. The Lombards were not converted until after their entrance into the Empire, but received Christianity from Arian Germanic tribes sometime during the 5th century. The Franks were converted directly from paganism to Catholicism under the leadership of Clovis I in about CE 496 without an intervening time as Arians. The Visigoths converted to Roman Catholicism in 589 AD. Several centuries later, Anglo-Saxon and Frankish missionaries and warriors undertook the conversion of their Saxon neighbors. A key event was the felling of Thor's Oak near Fritzlar by Boniface, apostle of the Germans, in CE 723. When Thor failed to strike Boniface dead after the oak hit the ground, the Franks were amazed and began their conversion to the Christian faith. Eventually for many Germanic tribes, the conversion to Christianity was achieved by armed force, successfully completed by Charlemagne, in a series of campaigns (the Saxon Wars), that also brought Saxon lands into the Frankish empire. Massacres, such as the Bloody Verdict of Verden, where as many as 4,500 people were beheaded according to one of Charlemagne's chroniclers, were a direct result of this policy. In Scandinavia, Germanic paganism continued to dominate until the 11th century in the form of Old Norse religion, when it was gradually replaced by Christianity. While the Germanic peoples were slowly converted to Christianity by varying means, many elements of the pre-Christian culture and indigenous beliefs remained firmly in place after the conversion process, particularly in the more rural and distant regions. Of particular note is the survival of the pagan fascination with the forest in the retention of Christmas tree even today. Many of the Germanic tribes actually revered forests as sacred places and left them unmolested. Conversion to Christianity broke this pagan obsession with protecting the forest in some locations and allowed once migrant tribes to settle in places where they previously refused to cultivate the soil or chop down trees based on religious belief. To that end, the Christianisation of Germanic peoples facilitated the clearing of forests and therewith provided \\"a broad and stable basis for the medieval economy of Central Europe\\" by leveraging the vast forest resources available to them. =Heathenism= Elements of Germanic paganism survived into post- Christianization folklore, and today new religious movements exist which see themselves as modern revivals of Germanic Heathenry. Folklore The folklore of early Germanic peoples was intimately intertwined with their natural surroundings. Legendary creatures of Germanic folklore include, elves, who inhabited the woods, foundations and streams; dwarves, who inhabited the caves of the earth; serpents, who inhabited the sea; and the neck, who inhabited the marshes. Remnants of early Germanic folklore has survived unto the present day. Festivals Festivals in early Germanic culture included the autumn festival (Winter Nights), the New Year festival (Yule), the spring festival (Easter), and Midsummer's Day. Yule was indended to induce the sun to regain its former strength. Easter celebrated the renewal of nature. The Midsummer's Day was the greatest festival of all, in which it was celebrated that the sun had regained its full power. On this occasion numerous tribes would come together to celebrate and a general peace would sometimes be declared. Meanwhile, the autumn festival was a period of mourning. Calendar Funerary practices The H√•ga mound at Uppsala, Sweden is from the Nordic Bronze Age In Neolithic Northern Europe, the deceased were generally buried by inhumation. By the early Bronze Age, cremation became more frequent, and eventually universal. The deceased was generally burnt at a funeral pyre, while his weapons and other possessions were placed in an urn for burial. Leading members of the community were sometimes buried in burial mounds. During the Pre-Roman Iron Age, the possessions of the deceased was sometimes placed in a hollowed-out grave without an urn. During the Roman period, urns were typically placed in flat graves. The deceased was buried along with his possessions so that he could bring them to the afterlife. Such possessions included weapons, personal adornments and other belongings, sometimes including the owner's horse and even his boat. In certain rare cases the deceased was even buried along with several of his servants, who would be slain for the purpose. Tacitus reports that certain Germanic individuals were inhumated in mound graves. Archaeological evidence does not suggest that this was a common practice. Cremation appears to have been much more common and long lasting in Scandinavia than in other Germanic territories. Among the coastal and island peoples of the north, the deceased was often placed with all his possessions in his boat, and then set on fire. Boat burials remained common in later times, even when inhumation was reintroduced. In such burials, the body was often placed in a boat over which a burial mound was erected. Inhumation became common again during the Migration period. Since such graves were often arranged in long rows, they have been called row-graves. They are not distinguished by mounds. Often they were arranged on either side of a high-way. This was a practice that had survived from Neolithic times. Symbols This Thor's hammer in silver with filigree ornamentation was found in Scania. It was donated to the Swedish History Museum in 1895. There were many symbols of importance in early Germanic culture, including the sun cross and the swastika. Such symbols are attested from the Nordic Bronze Age up to the Viking Age. Patterns of thought Early Germanic society was characterized by a rigorous code of ethics, which above all valued trust, loyalty and courage. The attainment of honor, fame and recognition was a primary ambition. Independence and individuality was highly emphazised. This emphazis largely prevented the emergence of a unified Germanic state. The environment in which the Germanic peoples emerged, notably their attachment to the forest and the sea, played a major role in shaping such values. Germanic literature is filled with scorn for characters who failed to live the Germanic ideals. Although Germanic society was highly stratified between leaders, freemen and slaves, their culture still emphasized equality. On occasion, the freemen of the tribe would overrule the decisions of their own leaders. Law √ûorgn√Ωr the Lawspeaker showing the power of his office to the King of Sweden at Gamla Uppsala, 1018. The lawspeaker forced King Olof Sk√∂tkonung not only to accept peace with his enemy, King Olaf the Stout of Norway, but also to give his daughter to him in marriage. Illustration by C. Krogh. Common elements of Germanic society can be deduced both from Roman historiography and comparative evidence from the Early Medieval period. =Kingship= A main element uniting Germanic societies was kingship, in origin a sacral institution combining the functions of military leader, high priest, lawmaker and judge. Germanic monarchy was elective; the king was elected by the free men from among eligible candidates of a family (OE cynn) tracing their ancestry to the tribe's divine or semi-divine founder. Under the influence of the Roman Empire, the power of Germanic kings over their own people increased throughout the centuries, partially because mass-migrations of the time required more stern leadership. Caesar notes than in wartime, Germanic tribes would select a \\"magistrate\\" with supreme authority to wage war. Those who refused to follow him were considered traitors, and were subjected to social isolation: > When a nation either defends itself in war or wages it, magistrates are > selected to be in charge of the war with power of life and death... Those > unwilling to follow are thought as deserters and traitors and are no longer > trusted in anything. =Assemblies= thing, drawn after the depiction in a relief of the Column of Marcus Aurelius (193 CE) All freemen had the right to participate in general assemblies or things, where disputes between freemen were addressed according to customary law. In the federalist organization of Switzerland, where cantonal structures remained comparatively local, the Germanic thing survived into the 21st century in the form of the Landsgemeinde, albeit subject to federal law. =Legal codes= The king was bound to uphold ancestral law, but was at the same time the source for new laws for cases not addressed in previous tradition. This aspect was the reason for the creation of the various Germanic law codes by the kings following their conversion to Christianity: besides recording inherited tribal law, these codes have the purpose of settling the position of the church and Christian clergy within society, usually setting the weregilds of the members of the clerical hierarchy parallel to that of the existing hierarchy of nobility, with the position of an archbishop mirroring that of the king. Generally speaking, Roman legal codes eventually provided the model for many Germanic laws and they were fixed in writing along with Germanic legal customs. Traditional Germanic society was gradually replaced by the system of estates and feudalism characteristic of the High Middle Ages in both the Holy Roman Empire and Anglo-Norman England in the 11th to 12th centuries, to some extent under the influence of Roman law as an indirect result of Christianisation, but also because political structures had grown too large for the flat hierarchy of a tribal society. The same effect of political centralization took hold in Scandinavia slightly later, in the 12th to 13th century (Age of the Sturlungs, Consolidation of Sweden, Civil war era in Norway), by the end of the 14th century culminating in the giant Kalmar Union. Egill Skallagr√≠msson engaging in holmgang with Berg-√ñnundr, painting by Johannes Flintoe Elements of tribal law, notably the wager of battle, remained in effect throughout the Middle Ages, in the case of the Holy Roman Empire until the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court in the early German Renaissance. =Determining guilt= In the case of a suspected crime, the accused could avoid punishment by presenting a fixed number of free men (their number depending on the severity of the crime) prepared to swear an oath on his innocence. Failing in having witness testify in his favor, an accused man could prove his innocence in a trial. Such trials often the outcome when numerous individuals would swear oaths both in support and opposition of the defendant. Trials were typically either a trial by ordeal or a trial by combat. Common ordeals include trial by water and trial by fire. If someone was accused of crimes against the community itself, the determining of guilt or innocence was generally left to the priests. =Punishment= The Tollund Man of the 4th century BCE is one of the best studied examples of a bog body. Such bodies are often the remains of Germanic invidivuals subjected to capital punishment. Capital crimes in early Germanic culture included treason, cowardice in battle, desertion, assassination, degenerate magical practices and robbery. Tacitus notes that traitors were on occasion hanged in trees, while cowards were disposed of by drowning them in swamps: > \\"Traitors and deserters are hanged on trees. Cowards, those who will not > fight, and those who have defiled their bodies, are plunged into a boggy > mire, with a wicker hurdle pressed on top of them.\\" Hanging was considered an offering to the gods, while the drowning in swamps was more of a symbolic act, intended to completely remove the criminal from contact with the living. Some bog bodies appear to have been bound, and it is possible that they were buried alive. Corporal or capital punishment for free men does not figure prominently in the Germanic law codes, and banishment appears generally to be the most severe penalty issued officially. This reflects that Germanic tribal law did not have the scope of exacting revenge, which was left to the judgement of the family of the victim, but to settle damages as fairly as possible once an involved party decided to bring a dispute before the assembly. =Weregild= Early Germanic law reflects a hierarchy of worth within the society of free men, reflected in the differences in weregild. The weregild was instituted as a way to prevent the blood feuds. It was a sum of money which was to be paid to the injured party as compensation for damage to person or property. The amount of weregild to be paid depended upon the damage done and the position of the persons involved. It was generally regulated by the tribal assembly. A fascinating component of early Germanic laws were the varying distinctions concerning the physical body, as each body part had a personal injury value and corresponding legal claims for personal injury viewed matters like gender, rank and status as a secondary interest when deliberating cases. Among the Anglo-Saxons, a regular free man (a ceorl) had a weregild of 200 shillings (i.e. solidi or gold pieces), classified as a twyhyndeman \\"200-man\\" for this reason, while a nobleman commanded a fee of six times that amount (twelfhyndeman \\"1200-man\\"). Among the Alemanni the basic weregild for a free man was 200 shillings, and the amount could be doubled or tripled according to the man's rank. Unfree serfs did not command a weregild, and the recompense paid in the event of their death was merely for material damage, 15 shillings in the case of the Alamanni, increased to 40 or 50 if the victim had been a skilled artisan. The social hierarchy is not only reflected in the weregild due in the case of the violent or accidental death of a man, but also in differences in fines for lesser crimes. Thus the fines for insults, injury, burglary or damage to property differ depending on the rank of the injured party. They do not usually depend on the rank of the guilty party, although there are some exceptions associated with royal privilege. Free women did not have a political station of their own but inherited the rank of their father if unmarried, or their husband if married. The weregild or recompense due for the killing or injuring of a woman is notably set at twice that of a man of the same rank in Alemannic law. =Property= Caesar writes that Germanic peoples did not own private property, but that land was the property of the entire tribe, and was distributed by the tribal leaders to occupied for a specified amount of time. Such measures were intended to prevent members of the tribe from becoming settled agriculturalists, and to prevent wealth concentration, which could become a source of instability. To a large degree, many of the extant legal records from the Germanic tribes seem to revolve around property transactions. In early Germanic society, the free men of property each ruled their own estate and were subject to the king directly, without any intermediate hierarchy as in later feudalism. Free men without landed property could swear fealty to a man of property who as their lord would then be responsible for their upkeep, including generous feasts and gifts. This system of sworn retainers was central to early Germanic society, and the loyalty of the retainer to his lord generally replaced his family ties. Warfare The 3rd-century Great Ludovisi sarcophagus depicts a battle between Goths and Romans. Although the arrival of the Corded Ware culture in Northern Europe in the 3rd millennium BC must have been accompanied by widespread conflict, Germanic society during the Nordic Bronze Age of the 2nd millennium BC appears to have been largely peaceful. With the introduction of iron to Northern Europe however, Germanic society became heavily characterized by war. Germanic warfare largely emphasized offensive infantry warfare. Armies would typically attack in a wedge formation, with chieftains leading from the front fighting side by side with their immediate family members. Germanic warriors would eventually also excel at horse-powered warfare and naval warfare. Fortifications were rarely used, and as a result, there was little use for siege equipment. Raids by small war bands led by a charismatic leader, a so- called comitatus, was a common occurrence. Military training was started from an early age. During the time of the Roman Empire, large number of Germanic mercenaries served in the Roman army, some even gaining prominent positions. Early Germanic peoples believed that heroic death in battle would enable a warrior admittance to Valhalla, a majestic hall presided over by Odin, chief of the Germanic pantheon. In times of distress, a Germanic tribe would on occasion embark on a wholesale mass-migration, in which the entire able-bodied population became engaged in war. In a series of Germanic Wars, invading Germanic peoples overwhelmed the Western Roman Empire and established themselves as the foremost military powers of Western Europe in its place. Economy =Agriculture= Germanic agriculture emphasized cereal production and animal husbandry. This depended on the nature of the area. Cereals produced by Germanic agriculturalists was normally used for home consumption, rather than being sold or exported. Cattle hides was however an important export for Germanic merchants. History Traces of the earliest pastoralism of the Germanic peoples appear in central Europe in the form of elaborate cattle burials along the Elbe and Vistula Rivers from around 4000‚Äì3000 BCE. These archaeological remnants were left by the Globular Amphora culture who cleared forests for herding cattle and sometime after 3000 BCE began using wheeled carts and plows to cultivate their lands. Central to survival for their assistance in tilling the soil and supplying food, cattle became an economic resource to these early people. The Funnelbeaker culture and Corded Ware culture and (circa. 2900‚Äì2300 BCE) coincide one another and provide evidence of how the ancestors of the Germanic peoples lived. Roman descriptions Caesar writes that the Germanic tribes were not agricultural people, and that tribal leaders instituted active measures to prevent members of the tribe from becoming settled agriculturalists. Archaeological research has however discovered that this observation by Caesar is not entirely correct. Agriculture was and had been for a long time a key component in Germanic life. Caesar's observations were made from warlike tribes on the move near the Roman borders, and are thus not representative of all the Germanic peoples. That agriculture was an important part of Germanic life is attested by Caesar, when he writes that the Usipetes and Tencteri had been forced to migrate from their lands after the Suebi had sabotaged their crops. Tacitus writes that the Germanic peoples were more of a pastoral people than an agricultural people. Wealth was in a large part measured by the amount of cattle owned. He noted that Germanic cattle was of smaller size than Roman cattle. Crop raising The chief cereal grains produced were wheat and barley. In later times oats and rye were also cultivated. Garden products such as beans, beets, peas and turnips were well known. Evidence from a Saxon village known as Feddersen Wierde near Cuxhaven, Germany (which existed between BCE 50 to CE 450) shows that the Germanic peoples cultivated oats and rye, used manure as fertilizer, and that they practiced crop rotation. Husbandry Germanic agriculturalists primarily emphasized the raising of cattle, but goats, pigs, horses and sheep also played an important role. This had been the case since at least the early Bronze Age. There were plenty of chickens, ducks and geese in Germanic farmyards. A Germanic farm was typically inhabited by a large number of dogs. Germanic farmers harvested wool from their sheep, and used it for clothing. Oxen were used to plow the fields and for drawing wagons. This was the main means of transport. Horses were used for riding, ans also later as a draught animal. In areas along the North Sea coast, cattle raising appears to have been prevalent. This was because the high probability of flooding made agriculture risky. Similarly, in mountainous areas with good pasture but poor soil, husbandry was prevalent. Agricultural settlements Archaeological research has uncovered two forms of Germanic agricultural settlements. There were the farm village and the individual farm. The prevalence of either of these forms of settlements depended upon the nature of the land. The prevalence of the individual farm among Germanic peoples has sometimes been ascribed to their love of independence. Such individual farms depended upon a plentiful supply of water. Areas with poor soil or were the area was broken up by hills also encouraged the prevalence of individual farms. In the Icelandic sagas only individual farms are mentioned, and this also appears to have been the case in Norway, from where most of the Icelanders came. The establishment of agricultural villages was more common in areas rich soil or a poor water supply. Such settlements were typically grouped around a common water supply. Such settlements required a more sophisticated form or communal organization. Equipment The plough was the most important form of agricultural equipment for the early Germanic peoples, who had abandoned the hoe in Neolithic times. The Germanic words for plough are of distinct Indo-European origin. The plough was typically drawn by oxen, as shown in Bronze Age rock carvings. The wheel plough was eventually introduced to them from the south. It significantly improved the efficiency of Germanic agriculture. The Germanic tribes appear to have been the first peoples to use the heavy plough, which enabled them to farm the rough forested lowlands of Northern Europe. In this respect their technology was superior to that of the Romans. The Germanic word for harrow is of Indo-European origin, indicating that this tool was introduced at an early time. The sickle was used for the reaping of grain, while the ancient practice of beating out grain with sticks or tramping it out remained prevalent for a long time. Iron Age oak boat discovered at Nydam Mose in S√∏nderborg, Denmark. The fields were tilled with a light-weight wooden ard, although heavier models also existed in some areas. =Fishing= Among Germanic peoples living along the coasts, fishing was an important business. =Hunting= =Trade= The Amber Road from the Baltic Sea to Rome The presence of amber in Mycenaean graves, and the presence of Italian bronze daggers in Northern European graves, attest to trade relations between early Bronze Age Germanic peoples and the Mediterranean Sea. Such trade further increased in volume through the Iron Age. The early Germanic peoples imported a large amount of gold from Ireland and ornaments from cultures along the Danube. Large amounts of amber has been discovered at sites of the Hallstatt culture, testifying to a massive export of this commodity by the Germanic peoples to their Celtic southern neighbors. From the Hallstatt culture, this amber found its way to the Villanovan culture. In return, the Germanic peoples imported salt from the Hallstatt culture. The arrival of iron from the south into Germanic territories led to a partial collapse of the Nordic Bronze Age. By this time the amber trade had declined. Varangian trade routes: the Volga trade route (in red) and the Dnieper and Dniester routes (in purple). Other trade routes of the 8th‚Äì11th centuries shown in orange. Roman goods exported by the Romans to Germanic territories include beads, coins, glassware, silverware and weapons. In turn the Romans received amber, cattle, fur and slaves. By the 4th century, wine became a very important Roman export to the Germanic world. It became a luxury product widely consumed by Germanic leaders. The two most important trade routes between Rome and the Germanic world went either along the North Sea coast or along the Vistula towards the Adriatic. Significant trade routes were also located along the Oder and Elbe rivers. Trade relations between Rome and the Germanic peoples increased throughout the history of the Roman Empire. This trade also facilitated increased cultural contacts. As the Germanic peoples became more and more acquainted with Roman industrial products, their appreciation of Roman coinage increased. The importation of Roman coins into Germanic territories reduced the importance of amber in Germanic society. Large collections of Roman coinage have been found deep into Germanic terrotires, even in Scandinavia. Returning Germanic mercenaries in the Roman army brought back many Roman products to their communities. One of the reasons the Romans may have drawn borders along the Rhine, besides the sizable population of Germanic warriors on one side of it, was that the Germanic economy was not robust enough for them to extract much booty nor were they convinced they could acquire sufficient tax revenue from any additional efforts of conquest. Drawing a distinctive line between themselves and Germanic people also incentivized alliances and trade as the Germanic people sought a share of the imperial wealth. =Finance= In early Germanic society, amber was an important medium of exchange. Early Germanic peoples are recorded as being intensely opposed to taxation. For this reason, it is noted by Salvian, native Romans in many cases preferred \\"barbarian\\" rule over Roman rule. > \\"For in the Gothic country the barbarians are so far from tolerating this > sort of oppression that not even Romans who live among them have to bear it. > Hence all the Romans in that region have but one desire, that they may never > have to return to the Roman jurisdiction. It is the unanimous prayer of the > Roman people in that district that they may be permitted to continue to lead > their present life among the barbarians.\\" Roman coinage was coveted by the Germanic people who preferred silver to gold coins, mostly likely indications that a market economy was developing. Tacitus does mention the presence of a bartering system being observable among the Germanic people, but this was not exclusive, as he also writes of their use of \\"gold and silver for the purpose of commerce\\", adding rather sardonically in his text, that they preferred silver for buying cheap everyday goods. Such observations from Tacitus aside, fine metalwork, iron and glassware was soon being traded by the Germanic peoples along the coast of the North Sea of Denmark and the Netherlands. =Slavery= Slavery was common among the early Germanic peoples. Slaves were both captured during war and purchased. Certain slaves had on the contrary lost their freedom through gambling. Such individuals were however generally expelled from the community. As the Germanic peoples were frequently engaged in war, there was a constant supply of cheap slaves, although slavery was never as an important institution as it became in ancient Rome. In the Germanic economy, slaves performed both domestic work and farm labor. Attractive female slaves would often end up as concubines for leaders and wealthy landowners. Gladiator games between slaves, such as those carried out in ancient Rome, is not mentioned as having been common among Germanic peoples, although it is possible that such games were arranged among the Germanic peoples living on the Roman border. According to Tacitus, Germanic peoples treated slaves more mildly than contemporary peoples. Although the master had complete power of life and death over his slave, mistreatment of slaves is not recorded in early Germanic literature. In the Icelandic sagas, the children of slaves and masters are often mentioned as playing with each other. The manumission of slaves among Germanic peoples was common, just as it was among the Romans. Owen notes that the life of a Germanic slave was \\"infinitely better than on the industrialized farms of Italy.\\". =Craftsmanship= After 1300 BCE the societies of Jutland and Northern Germany along with the Celtic people experienced a major revolution in technology during the Late Bronze Age, shaping tools, containers and weapons through the improved techniques of working bronze. Both the sword and the bow and arrow as well as other weaponry proliferate and an arms race of sorts between the tribes ensued as they tried to outpace one another. Trade was taking place to a greater degree and simple gems and amber from the Mediterranean indicate that long-distance exchange of goods was occurring. Important small-scale industries in Germanic society were weaving, the manual production of basic pottery and, more rarely, the fabrication of iron tools, especially weapons. When the Iron Age arrived, the Germanic people showed greater mastery of ironworks than their Celtic contemporaries but they did not have the extensive trade networks during this period that their southern neighbors enjoyed with the Greco-Roman world. In many cases in fact, ancient Germanic smiths and other craftsmen produced products of higher quality than the Romans. Germanic metalworkers must have held very important positions in their societies. This is attested by the respect accorded to master craftsmen in Germanic literature, such as Wayland the Smith. Architecture =Mead hall= A reconstructed Viking Age mead hall (28.5 metres long). A significant structure in Germanic architecture was the mead hall. It was designed for the purpose of serving as a dining-hall, sleeping-room and assembly for the chieftain and his followers. Such hall are vividly described in the Germanic epics. In Beowulf, which takes place in 6th century Scandinavia, the mead hall is described as a quadrilateral structure of wood with a raised platform on either side within. In the centre on one side of the mead-hall, there was a high-seat and a secondary high-seat, which were reserved for the chieftain and his guest of honor respectively. In front of the high-seats were long tables upon which heavy planks were raised. The chief's followers would sleep in the hall at raised platforms during the night, with their equipment hanging above on the wall ready for use. The king would normally sleep in a separate structure. A blazing hearth was placed in the centre of the hall. =Infrastucture= Archaeologists have discovered a number of well- constructed roads across moors in Germanic territories. Although the Germanic peoples were not road-builders, paths and wagon tracks were created. They later learned the art of road-building from Roman engineers. Germanic peoples did not build bridges. Rivers were instead crossed at fords or by boats. This is vividly described in the Nibelungenlied. =Dwellings= The dwelling houses of the Germanic tribes varied by locality and time period. Typically, they were of timber and constructed rectangulary with walls of upright posts. Intervening spaces were filled with interwoven twigs and branches, and then smeared with clay. When dry this had the same effect as modern stucco. Roofs were thatched with grass or straw. Early Germanic houses were typically unitary, housing both humans and animals. Buildings often had upright logs or posts as walls, long crossed rafters ad the top and thatched saddle roofs, with the interior of the house being divided into three parts by two rows of posts. The entrance was typically on the side and there was an exit in the roof for the smoke from the hearth. The living quarters were generally in one part of the building, while the stalls for cattle were in the side areas. Round houses were not uncommon in Germanic architecture, but was more frequent among the Celts. This form of architecture appears to have been borrowed by Germanic peoples encroaching upon Celtic territory, such as the Marcomanni. In Roman columns, Roman soldiers are depicted setting fire to such round houses belonging to the Marcomanni. A more simple Germanic construction were log huts with thatched roofs at an angle of ca. 45 degrees. Such structures are described by Strabo and Pliny, who claim that those could be loaded on wagons and established at a new place. These constructions were probably utilized during times of war or migration. Germanic houses were frequently constructed on artificial mounds as a measure against flooding. This form of construction was particularly common along the North Sea coast, where floods were frequent. Houses belonging to powerful members of the community were normally quite spacious. =Settlements= Germanic settlements were typically small, rarely containing much more than ten households, often less, and were usually located by clearings in the woods. Settlements remained of a fairly constant size throughout the period. Germanic settlements were typically along the coasts and rivers. =Other buildings= The more simple structures in Germanic villages were often dug-out shelters with dung-covered roofs. These were generally used as supply-rooms, work-rooms or dwelling places for the poor. =Feddersen Wierde= A reconstructed house from Feddersen Wierde,in the Hannover MuseumThe best known settlements are the wurts, or warfts in North Germany. The classic site is Feddersen Wierde https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feddersen_Wierde, near Cuxhaven at the mouth of the River Weser. This was inhabited from the first century BC until the fifth century AD, when due to the rising sea level, they probably emigrated to England. A comprehensive archaeological excavation between 1954 and 1963 yielded valuable knowledge about prehistoric settlements in the North Germany Music Cuisine =Diet= Although the Germanic tribes practiced both agriculture and husbandry, the latter was extremely important both as a source of dairy products and as a basis for wealth and social status, which was measured by the size of an individual's herd. Caesar writes that the Germanic peoples mainly consumed milk, cheese and meat. The diet consisted mainly of the products of farming and husbandry and was supplied by hunting to a very modest extent. Barley and wheat were the most common agricultural products and were used for baking a certain flat type of bread as well as brewing beer. Beowulf and the Icelandic sagas describe a society with a plentiful supply of food. Many of the famous Germanic mass-migrations carried out appear to have been motivated by famine, often induced by crop failures. =Drinks= Vendel Period bronze horn fittings and 3rd century glass drinking horn on display at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities. Early Germanic peoples prepared both ale, mead, beer and wine. The importance of drinking at social functions is vividly described in pieces of Germanic literature such as Beowulf, the Nibelungenlied and the Poetic Edda. Both the words beer and ale are of distinct Germanic origin, having no cognates in other Indo-European languages. In early Germanic culture, beer had been sweetened by honey, while ale was made from grain alone. Since the honey had to be imported from the south, it is probable that ale was being drunk among the Germanic tribes earlier than beer. Tacitus notes that the Germanic drink was \\"a liquid made from barley or wheat fermented into a faint resemblance of whine.\\" Evidence from Germanic literature and the Germanic vocabulary show that mead played a particularly important role in early Germanic culture. The oldest mentioning of mead being drunk by the Germanic tribes is from the 5th century writer Priscus, who writes that mead was being consumed at the court of Attila. Mead was prepared through boiling a mixture of water and honey and leaving it to ferment. In later times wine was added to the mead. Wine seems to have been introduced to the Germanic tribes at a late date, as this drink could not be produced in Northern Europe, and had to be imported. Contrary to Caesar, Tacitus writes that several Germanic tribes were known to drink excessively. Germanic drinking bouts were often accompanied with violence. Tacitus adds in this connection that the Germanic peoples were more easily defeated through exploiting their vices than by attacking them militarily. Caesar notes that certain warlike and powerful Germanic tribes, such as the Nervii and Suebi, practiced teetotalism, banning the import of alcoholic beverages to their territories in order to combat degeneracy. Family life \\"The Women of the Teutons Defend the Wagon Fort\\" (1882) by Heinrich Leutemann The most important family relationships among the early Germanic peoples were within the individual household, a fact based on the archaeological evidence from their settlements where the long-houses appeared to be central in their existence. Within the household unit, an individual was equally bound to both the mother and the father's side of the family. Fathers were the main figures of authority, but wives also played an important and respected role. Children were valued, and according to Tacitus, limiting or destroying one's offspring was considered shameful. Mothers apparently breast-fed their own children rather than using nurses. Besides parents and children, a household might include slaves, but slavery was uncommon, and according to Tacitus, slaves normally had households of their own. Their slaves (usually prisoners of war) were most often employed as domestic servants. =Extended family= A drinking scene on an image stone from Gotland, in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. A Germanic family was part of an extended family known as the sippe, which was the basis for the organization of Germanic society. The sippe provided the basis for the organization of the \\"hundreds\\" in times of war, and determined the amount of weregild to be paid in disputes. A family was the core of the household, which also included slaves and others who worked on the estate. The writings of Tacitus allude to the Germanic peoples being aware of a shared ethnicity, in that, they either knew or believed that they shared a common biological ancestor with one another. Just how pervasive this awareness may have been is certainly debatable, but other factors like language, clothing, ornamentation, hair styles, weapon types, religious practices and shared oral history were likely just as significant in tribal identity for the Germanic peoples. Members of a Germanic tribe told tales about the exploits of heroic founding figures who were more or less mythologized. Village life consisted of free men assembled under a chieftain, all of whom shared common cultural and political traditions. Status among the early Germanic tribes was often gauged by the size of a man's cattle herd or by one's martial prowess. Before their conversion to Christianity, the Germanic peoples of Europe were made up of several tribes, each functioning as an economic and military unit and sometimes united by a common religious cult. Outsiders could be adopted into a new tribe. Kinship, especially close kinship, was very important to life within a tribe but generally was not the source of a tribe's identity. In fact, several elements of ancient Germanic life tended to weaken the role of kinship: the importance of the retinues surrounding military chieftains, the ability of strong leaders to unite people who were not closely related, and feuds and other conflicts within a tribe that might lead to permanent divisions. A code of ethics in battle prevailed among the Germanic kin. According to Tacitus, the greatest disgrace that can befall a warrior of a clan among the Germanic tribes was the abandonment of their shield during combat, as this almost certainly resulted in social isolation. Within tribal Germanic society, their social hierarchy was linked intrinsically to war and this warrior code maintained the fidelity between chiefs and their young warriors. Feuds were the standard means for resolving conflicts and regulating behavior. Peace within the tribe was about controlling violence with codes identifying exactly how certain types of feuds were to be settled. Those closely related to a person who had been injured or killed were supposed to exact revenge on or monetary payment from the offender. This duty helped reaffirm the bonds between extended family members. Yet such feuds weakened the tribe as a whole, sometimes leading to the creation of a new tribe as one group separated from the rest. Clans of Germanic people consisted of groupings of about 50 households in total with societal rules for each specific clan. Recent scholarship suggests that, despite the obligation to take part in feuds and other customs involving kinship ties, extended families did not form independent units among the early Germanic peoples. Though most members of a tribe would have been more or less distantly related, common descent was not the main source of a tribe's identity, and extended families were not the main social units within a tribe. Traditional theories have emphasized the supposedly central role in Germanic culture of clans or large groups with common ancestry. But there is little evidence that such clans existed, and they were certainly not an important element of social organization. As historian Alexander C. Murray concludes, \\"kinship was a crucial factor in all aspects of barbarian activity, but its uses and groupings were fluid, and probably on the whole not long lasting.\\" Internal competition within the factions of a tribe occasionally resulted in internecine warfare which weakened and sometime destroyed a group, as appears to have been the case for the Cherusci tribe during Rome's earlier period. When a certain number of families resided on the same territory, this constituted a village (Dorf in German). The overall territory occupied by people from the same tribe was designated in the writings of Tacitus as a civitas, with each of the individual civitas divided into pagi (or cantons), which were made up of several vici. In cases where the tribes were grouped into larger confederations or a group of kingdoms, the term pagus was applied (Gau in German). Extensive contact with Rome altered the egalitarian structure of tribal Germanic society. As individuals rose to prominence, a distinction between commoner and nobility developed and with it the previous constructs of folkright shared equally across the tribe was replaced in some cases by privilege. As a result, Germanic society became more stratified. Elites within the Germanic tribes who learned the Roman system and emulated the way they established dominion were able to gain advantages and exploit them accordingly. Important changes began taking place by the 4th century CE as Germanic peoples, while still cognizant of their unique clan identities, started forming larger confederations of a similar culture. Gathering around the dominant tribes among them and hearkening to the most charismatic leaders brought the various barbarians tribes closer together. On the surface this change appeared to the Romans as welcome since they preferred to deal with a few strong chiefs to control the populations that they feared across the Rhine and Danube, but it eventually made these Germanic rulers of confederated peoples more and more powerful. While strong, they were still not federated to one another since they possessed no sense of \\"pan-Germanic solidarity\\", but this started to change noticeably by the 5th century CE at Rome's expense. =Role of women= Hervor dying after the Battle of the Goths and Huns, by Peter Nicolai Arbo In early Germanic society, a woman had no formal political rights, meaning that she was not permitted to participate in popular or tribal assemblies. She could be represented through her male relatives, and thus only exert influence from behind the scenes. Despite their lack of direct political influence, Roman writers note that Germanic women had much influence in their society. Some tribes believed that women possessed magical powers and were feared accordingly. Female priestesses had a major influence on decisions made by Cimbri and Teutones during the Cimbrian War, and Ariovistus during his war with Caesar. Germanic epics, such as the Nibelungenlied and Beowulf, describe the strong influence which royal women exerted in their society. Goddesses revered among the Germanic tribes include Nerthus of the Ingvaeones and Freya. Tacitus describes how, during battles, Germanic warriors were encouraged and cared for by their wives and mothers. Germanic literature contains many references to mischief caused by women. Women playing a prominent role in Germanic literature include Gudrun, Brunhild and the wives of Gunther and Nj√°ll √ûorgeirsson. =Sexuality= Julius Caesar notes that early Germanic peoples believed sexual abstinence until adulthood increased physical growth and manliness. For a young Germanic man, having had sexual relations with a woman before the age of twenty was considered a disgrace: > Life is all in hunting and military exercise. From childhood they train for > labor and hardship. They have great praise among them for those who remain > longest without sexual experience. Some think this makes for height, muscle, > and strength. Indeed to have had knowledge of a woman before age twenty they > think very shameful, and there is no hiding it...\\" Caesar further noted, to his amazement, that men and women would frequently bath naked together in lakes and rivers. =Marital relations= Process of marriage The Ring of Pietroassa (drawing by Henri Trenk, 1875). Generally, there were two forms of marriage among the Germanic peoples, one involving the participation of the parents and the other, those that did not. Known as Friedelehe, the latter form consisted of marriage between a free man and a free woman, since marriage between free persons and slaves was forbidden by law. Of note, Tacitus observed that \\"The dowry is not brought by the wife to the husband but by the husband to the wife\\" and wedding gifts related to a marriage consisted of things like oxen, saddles and various armaments. The marriage of a daughter was typically arranged by her parents, although the wishes of the daughter was generally taken into considerations. Sometimes girls would be given away for marriage as a way to preserve the peace. Marriageable age The age at first marriage among ancient Germanic tribes, according to Tacitus, was late for women compared to Roman women: > The young men are slow to mate, and reach manhood with unimpaired vigour. > Nor are the virgins hurried into marriage. Being as old and as tall as the > men, they are equal to their mates in age and strength, and the children > inherit the robustness of their parents. Where Aristotle had set the prime of life at 37 years for men and 18 for women, the Visigothic Code of law in the 7th century placed the prime of life at twenty years for both men and women, after which both presumably married. Thus it can be presumed that ancient Germanic brides were on average about twenty and were roughly the same age as their husbands. Anglo-Saxon women, like those of other Germanic tribes, are marked as women from the age of twelve onward, based on archaeological finds, implying that the age of marriage coincided with puberty. Monogamy vs. polygamy Based on the writings of Tacitus, most of the Germanic men were content with one wife, which indicates a general trend towards monogamy. Tacitus notes that the Germanic tribes were strictly monogameous, and that adultery was severely punished: > Considering the great size of the population, adultery is very rare. The > penalty for it is instant and left to the husband. He cuts off her hair, > strips her naked in the presence of kinsmen, and flogs her all through the > village. They have no mercy on a woman who prostitutes her chastity. Neither > beauty, nor youth, nor wealth can find her another husband. In fact, no one > there laughs about vice, nor is seducing and being seduced called > \\"modern\\"... To limit the number of their children or to kill one of the > later-born is regarded as a crime. For those higher within their social hierarchy however, polygamy was sometimes solicited on account of their rank. Intermarriage Statue of Thusnelda, wife of Arminius, at Loggia dei Lanzi, Florence. For Germanic kings, warrior chieftains, senators and Roman nobility, a certain degree of intermarriage was undertaken to strengthen their ties to one another and to the Empire, making marriage or connubium as the Romans connoted the bond, an instrument of politics. Earlier treaty terms in the late 4th century CE had forbidden \\"foreign\\" Goths to intermarry with Romans. Some of the marriage attempts of the 6th century CE were deliberately planned for the sake of royal succession. Imperial policy had to be carefully charted between the Roman-Germanic claimants to kingship and the maintenance of Roman imperial administration, as the federated Germanic kings attempted to put their stamp on Roman rule and replace Roman armies with their own warriors. Roman leaders were not oblivious to the clever tactics (intermarriage and offspring) employed by Germanic chieftains and adopted creative treaties to either appease them or temper their ambitions. Marriage roles Upon being married, a Germanic woman fell under the guardianship of her husband. She became his property. If a man was proven guilty of being violent towards his wife, her family would in some cases begin feud against her husband. Such feuds are described vividly in the Icelandic sagas. Revealing the warlike nature of their society, Tacitus reported that wives came to their husbands as a partner in toils and dangers; to suffer and to dare equally with him, in peace and in war. Upon the death of their husbands and other male relatives on the battlefield and the defeat of their tribe, Germanic women are recorded by Roman historians as having killed their children and committed suicide. Such was the fate of the women of the Cimbri and Teutons after their defeat in the Cimbrian War. For Germanic women of later antiquity, marriage obviously had its appeal since it offered greater security and better placement in their social hierarchy. Evidence of Germanic patriarchy is evident later in the 7th century CE Edict of Rothari of the Lombards, which stated that women were not allowed to live of their own freewill and that they had to be subject to a man and if no one else, they were to be \\"under the power of the king\\". From the Icelandic sagas, it becomes evident that married women had almost complete control of household management. In the case of renowned leaders, their wives were sometimes burned alive with their dead husbands. This tradition is vividly described in the Germanic epics, and the wives who subjected themselves to immolation are praised for their loyalty to their husbands. Divorce In cases of divorce described in the Icelandic sagas, the purchase price for the woman had to be paid back to her parents, and she was permitted to retain property legally owned by her. Archaeology See the Jastorf culture for a discussion of Germanic archaeology. Art Appearances Attempt to reconstruct Bastarnae costumes at the Archaeological Museum of Krak√≥w. Such clothing and weapons were commonplace among peoples on the Roman Empire's borders. =Sources= The practice of cremation by Germanic tribes of the Bronze Age and Pre-Roman Iron Age has made it difficult to ascertain the clothing of Germanic peoples during the initial years of the Iron Age. By the beginning of the Roman Iron Age however, burial practices were again changing, although little clothing is generally preserved in burials. The clothing of Germanic criminals buried in the moors has however been well preserved due to the physical conditions. The descriptions by Roman writers, and particularly the depictions of Germanic warriors on Roman columns, provide valuable evidence of the clothing used by the early Germanic peoples. =Clothing= Male clothing By the Roman Iron Age, as in the Bronze Age, Germanic peoples were wearing long-sleeved jackets reaching down the knees, and a skin or woolen mantle held at the neck with a brooch or safety pin. Contrary to the Bronze Age however, trousers were now being used. This custom had been adopted from the Celts, who in turn had adopted this custom from nomads of the steppes. The adoption of this custom has been ascribed to climatic changes and the increased role of horsemanship in Germanic culture at the time. Caesar notes that the Suebi wore only skins, but Tacitus does not agree with this in his observations a hundre years later. While customs might have changed during this time, it is probable that Caesar based his observations strictly from warriors. Evidence from Roman columns and moor bodies substantiate Tacitus. Roman monuments typically depicts Germanic warriors as being naked from the waist up, except from a mantle worn over the shoulders. This was probably to achieve increased mobility. From about the 3rd century AD, linen clothing appears more frequently, which is a sign of increasing wealth. Vandalic couple, with the male having his hair in a \\"Suebian knot\\" (160 AD), Archaeological Museum of Krak√≥w, Poland. Jackets from the 3rd century AD were typically worn over a linen garment. Short knee trousers were also worn. This is shown from moor burials, and from the fact that such trousers began to be used by Roman soldiers at the time, probably as an imitation of Germanic warriors. Female clothing The dress of Germanic women changed considerably from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. In particular, skirts were more ample and free-flowing. The girle-ornament of the Bronze Age was no longer worn. Tacitus writes that Germanic women more frequently wore linen garments than men. They wore long dresses that were generally dyed in red or other colors. This dress had a high waist and was generally sleeveless. The dress of Germanic women indicate a high degree of practical knowledge of the use of materials. Women must have had a knowledge of dying, and colors were certainly derived from plants. Germanic women are notably depicted in one Roman illustration with trousers and the upper part of the breast partly exposed. This is however not the case from moor burials and other illustrations. It is possible that this illustration was of a female figure symbolizing Germania rather than a typical Germanic woman. =Headgear= While Germanic males of the Bronze Age generally wore a helm-like cap, the Iron Age was characterized by leaving heads uncovered, whereas the head decorations of Germanic women varied considerably with the times. Women typically wore various kinds of \\"combs, hairpins and head decoration\\" as well as ornaments around the forehead; it was also customary for women to wear their hair long and short hair was considered \\"a mark of disgrace.\\" =Shoes= Early Germanic peoples typically wore shoes of the sandal type. =Hairstyles= Osterby Head with Suebian knot By the Iron Age, Germanic warriors, particularly those of the Suebi, are known for wearing their hair in a so-called Suebian knot. By the 3rd century AD, significant changes had occurred with regards to the Germanic hairstyle. The custom of wearing the hair long had become prominent among such peoples as the Franks, among whom it became a sign of noble birth and eligibility for kingship. Germanic warriors are often depicted in Roman columns with full beards, but this practice probably varied from tribe to tribe and period to period. Germanic women typically wore their hair long or plaited. Germanic women wore various types of hairpins and combs. It was considered disgraceful to wear the hair short. =Ornaments= The Germanic peoples of the Bronze Age are well known for their ornaments. The same techniques were handed down to the craftsmen of the Iron Age. The display of ornaments played an important part in early Germanic culture. Products were made of both bronze, gold and silver. Early Germanic literature reserves a prominent place for ornaments such as the Br√≠singamen of the goddess Freya, the Nibelung hoard and the heirlooms of Beowulf. Recreational activities =Gambling= Roman writers note that Germanic peoples were extremely fond of gambling. Francis Owen note that these Roman observations were made from Germanic warriors, who were not necessarily representative of their communities as a whole. Germanic studies Thor's Fight with the Giants (1872) by was made during the Viking revival. The Renaissance revived interest in pre-Christian Classical Antiquity and only in a second phase in pre-Christian Northern Europe. The Germanic peoples of the Roman era were often lumped with the other agents of the \\"barbarian\\" invasions, the Alans and the Huns, as opposed to the civilized \\"Roman\\" identity of the Holy Roman Empire. Early modern publications dealing with Old Norse culture appeared in the 16th century, e.g. Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (Olaus Magnus, 1555) and the first edition of the 13th century Gesta Danorum (Saxo Grammaticus), in 1514. Authors of the German Renaissance such as Johannes Aventinus discovered the Germanii of Tacitus as the \\"Old Germans\\", whose virtue and unspoiled manhood, as it appears in the Roman accounts of noble savagery, they contrast with the decadence of their own day. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the Edda (notably Peder Resen's Edda Islandorum of 1665). The Viking revival of 18th century Romanticism created a fascination with anything \\"Nordic\\" in disposition. The beginning of Germanic philology proper begins in the early 19th century, with Rasmus Rask's Icelandic Lexicon of 1814, and was in full bloom by the 1830s, with Jacob Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie giving an extensive account of reconstructed Germanic mythology and composing a German dictionary (Deutsches W√∂rterbuch) of Germanic etymology. Jacob Grimm also coauthored with his brother Wilhelm, the famous Grimm's Fairy Tales. Apart from linguistic studies, the subject of what became of the Roman era Germanic tribes, and how they influenced the Middle Ages and the development of modern Western culture was a subject discussed during the Enlightenment by such as writers as Montesquieu and Giambattista Vico. The development of Germanic studies as an academic discipline in the 19th century ran parallel to the rise of nationalism in Europe and the search for national histories for the nascent nation states developing after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. A Germanic national ethnicity offered itself for the unification of Germany, contrasting the emerging German Empire with its neighboring rivals of differing ancestry. The emergence of a German ethnic identity was subsequently founded upon national myths of Germanic antiquity. These tendencies culminated in a later Pan-Germanism, ' which had as its aim, the political unity of all of German- speaking Europe (all Volksdeutsche) into a Germanic nation state. Contemporary Romantic nationalism in Scandinavia placed more weight on the Viking Age, resulting in the movement known as Scandinavism. Following World War II there was a backlash against nationalism, and as a response, government support for the study of ancient Germanic history and culture was significantly reduced both in Germany and Scandinavia. In these years, what remained of Germanic studies was characterized by a reaction against nationalism. Archaeological attempts to assign an identity to early Germanic peoples was deliberately avoided. The uniqueness, common northern origins and antiquity of the early Germanic peoples were called into question. The movement gained particular momentum during the 1960s. It has been strongly associated with the so-called Vienna School, which is associated with the European Science Foundation and includes prominent members such as Reinhard Wenskus, Walter Pohl, Herwig Wolfram. These scholars employed sociological theories to reject the concept of ethnicity entirely. While Wenskus earlier maintained that the early Germanic peoples held a certain core-tradition (), Pohl has later maintained that early Germanic peoples had no institutions or values of their own, and made no contribution to medieval Europe whatsoever. These views are seconded by Wolfram, who states that Germans and Scandinavians \\"have as much a Germanic history\\" as \\"Slavic nations, Greeks, Turks and even the Tunisians and Maltese.\\" Wolf Liebeschuetz has characterized the theories of the Vienna School as \\"extraordinarily one-sided\\" and \\"dogmatism\\", and its proponents as having \\"a closed mind\\". More recently, an even more radical group has emerged, which also employs sociological theories to deconstruct Germanic peoples, while accusing the Vienna School of being \\"crypto-nationalists\\". Andrew Gillett has emerged as a leading figure among these scholars. According to them, linguistic evidence and Roman and early Germanic literature is unreliable, while archaeology \\"cannot be used to distinguish between peoples, and should not be used to trace migration\\". They state that Germanic culture was entirely derived from the Romans, and that there was therefore no Germanic contribution to medieval Europe.\\" Gillett's theories have been dismissed by Liebeschuetz as \\"flawed because they depend on a dogmatic and selective use of the evidence\\" and \\"very strongly ideological\\". In modern times, Malcolm Todd writes, the ideologically motivated theories of the post-war era have lost currency. The origins of the Germanic peoples are again traced to the first millennium BC, or even the Late Neolithic, in Northern Europe.

He was also, for a short period, proprietor of the Stuart Arms Hotel in Alice Springs.  Early life  South was born on 8 August 1855 at Dry Creek, in Modbury, South Australia and is one of the ten children of Henry and Margaret South who had a farm in the area. He was educated at the local school at Modbury, established by Scottish Presbyterians.  Career as a police officer  On 27 July 1877 South joined the South Australian mounted police force where he served in Melrose, Blinman, Farina, Barrows Creek and Port Augusta, Yarrowie and Peake before his 1888 appointment to Alice Springs, which was then known as Stuart. South was one of the first police officers appointed in Alice Springs and he served as the officer-in-charge and warden for the Gold Mining District. As a part of this role, at the time based at the Heavitree Gap Police Station, South formed acquaintances with and was respected by Francis Gillen, Baldwin Spencer and Edward Stirling; all of whom were leaders in their fields. South is remembered to have a greater consideration for Aboriginal people than many of his fellow policeman and was involved in the arrest and prosecution of William Willshire. Willshire was the first police officer in Australia to be charged for murder for the shooting of two Aboriginal men, Roger and Donkey, at Tempe Downs Station in 1891 and South assisted Gillen in his investigation of the deaths. In this investigation South went as far as questioning Willshire's sanity. South also gave evidence in the 1913 Royal Commission on the Aborigines, which was called for by Gillen, which related to these, and similar, murders in this period South is also credited for preventing early European settlers to Central Australia from cutting down River red gums along the Todd River for building supplies; for this Stuart Traynor credits him as being \\"the town's first greenie\\". In 1895 South was removed from his position in Alice Springs because of his involvement in the Stuart Arms Hotel and investment in mining shares: there were also accusations of poddy dodging, the theft of unbranded cattle, the charges about which were dismissed by the magistrates court as being unproved. Following his move from Alice Springs South was stationed at the police barracks in Adelaide and, in 1907, was promoted to senior constable.  Chief Protector of Aborigines  South was appointed as a protector of Aborigines on 1 March 1908 and this was followed, in 1911, by promotion to chief protector of Aborigines in 1911. In this role South sought to provide shelter, food and clothing to 'full descent' Aboriginal people so that they would be \\"comfortable and happy for the remainder of their lives\\". However, he was not as giving in his attitudes towards 'half-caste' Aboriginal children who he believed should be merged in to the 'white' community and he was directly involved in removing these children from Aboriginal camps and forming part of the Stolen Generations.This action was enabled by the Aborigines Act 1911, which established his position, and made him, through his position of chief protector, the legal guardian of 'every aboriginal and half- caste child'. South did not think this was enough and called for the Aborigines (Training of Children) Act 1923 that would enable the chief protector to remove children from the former mission stations; this was not possible with the earlier act. South believed that the extinction of Aboriginal people was inevitable, except for those that inherited 'white blood' which he believed was stronger and \\"must in the end prevail\\".  Later life  South died of heart disease, following a year long illness, on 27 May 1923, in North Adelaide and in his obituary he was described as \\"a staunch friend of the aborigines, one who knew their needs and habits from long association with them\\".  Personal life  On 2 October 1882, at St. Luke's Church of England in Adelaide, South married Fanny Stevens; the couple would go on to have four children. On 12 February 1909, following Fanny's death in 1908, South married Sophia Lalor, nee Reid, a widow with five children.

Project history On 28 December 2006, the Undersecretariat for Defence Industries of the Turkish Ministry of National Defense issued a request for proposal, which was revised on 12 July 2007. As of 22 November 2007, naval defense industry companies such as the DCNS of France, Navantia of Spain and the German/British business partnership Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft GmbH (HDW)/Marine Force International LLP (MFI) submiited proposals. After completing the evaluation process, the decision was announced on 22 July 2008 to start contract negotiations first with the HDW/MFI Business Partnership. By August 2008, the negotions started. The diesel-electric Type 214 submarine of ThyssenKrupp featuring an air- independent propulsion (AIP) system was selected, and the program begin was set to early 2009. The contract between the Turkish Undersecretariat for Defence Industries and the HDW/MFI consortium was signed on 2 July 2009. Amounting to 2.060 billion, the project came into force on 22 June 2011. The submarines are to be built at G√∂lc√ºk Naval Shipyard with material packages supplied by the HDW/MFI. The shipyard's capability is to be improved regarding the construction and outfitting of the submarines. The Turkish defense industry companies ASELSAN, HAVELSAN, MilSOFT, Defense Technologies Engineering and Trade Inc.

Production The production of the Reis-class, formerly Cerbe-class, submarines takes place in two large hangars, Block A and B, of the Submarine Prƒ±duction Plant (\\"Denizaltƒ± ƒ∞malat Fabrikasƒ±\\") at G√∂lc√ºk Naval Shipyard. Block A can hold three boats at one time, and is used for assembly and outfitting works, while Block B is for welding works of submarine hull sheets and putting them together. For the six submarines, the chosen names are TCG Pirireis, TCG Hƒ±zƒ±rreis, TCG Muratreis, TCG Aydƒ±nreis, TCG Seydialireis and TCG Selmanreis, after the 16th-century Ottoman Navy admirals Piri Reis, Kurtoƒülu Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis, Murat Reis the Elder, Aydƒ±n Reis, Seydi Ali Reis and Selman Reis. The first submarine, the TCG Pirireis, was laid down at the G√∂lc√ºk Naval Shipyard with the welding ceremony taking place on 28 September 2015. Two submarines, ex from 1960 to 1973 and ex between 1980 and 2004, were formerly named TCG Pirireis. The construction of three other Reis-class submarines, namely TCG Hƒ±zƒ±rreis, TCG Muratreis and TCG Aydƒ±nreis, followed. On 22 December 2019, TCG Pirireis was launched and put into a dry dock for outfitting. While the construction of three laid-down vessels was in progress, the first welding of the fifth submarine, the TCG Seydialireis, took place the same day. Characteristics The Reis-class submarines are Type 214 submarines featuring air-independent propulsion (AIP) using fuel cell technology. The boats are able to deploy heavyweight torpedoes, anti-ship missiles and to lay mines.

Based in Sussex, Burleigh was known for painting in egg tempera with the subject usually involving a central figure. Her husband and daughter also painted but she is the best regarded of the three. Biography Sand Dunes Burleigh was born in 1883 in Hassocks and went on to study at the Brighton School of Art. She married the painter Charles Burleigh and they lived and worked together as artists in Hove and Sussex. They designed a house with a large sun-lit top floor studio. Their daughter Veronica, who would also become a notable artist, was born there in 1909. The family never became rich from their works, and often relied on Burleigh's flair for buying and selling shares. In 1911 Burleigh illustrated a book of John Keats' poetry and went on to illustrate plays by Shakespeare. In 1913 she was featured in Studio magazine. In 1927 Burleigh illustrated Thistledown by Leolyn Louise Everett. From 1939 she was a member of the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolours. Burleigh became very ill in the 1940s, dying in 1949. Shortly before she died, Burleigh was elected an associate of the Royal Watercolour Society.  Style and Technique  Washerwomen Burleigh specialised in tempera painting, although she also worked in chalk and watercolour.Hebe. \\"Hebe's News & Notes.\\" The Gentlewoman and Modern Life, vol. XLVI, no. 1193, 1913, p. 675+. Nineteenth Century Collections Online, https://link-gale- com.wwwproxy1.library.unsw.edu.au/apps/doc/ZRBUAR823834550/NCCO?u=unsw&sid;=NCCO&xid;=a6aa940d. Accessed 20 Aug. 2020. Her works tend to have a bright colour palette with contrasting colours to lead the eye around the picture. A sharp luminosity and strong sense of design govern Burleigh's tempera and watercolour paintings. Frequently, her works portray decorative renaissance subjects, usually dominated by a female figure who is regularly modelled on her daughter, Veronica Burleigh. Burleigh however is also known to have completed images of still life and flowers. Over her career Burleigh's Pre-Raphaelite manner developed in to a freer style.  Works  At the start of Burleigh's career she produced 24 colour illustrations for The Poems of John Keats in 1911. Her illustrations are Pre-Raphaelite in style and are dominated by a female figure. This is seen in 'Isabella; or, The Pot of Basil' which portrays a prominent female figure in decorative fabrics leaning upon a flourishing pot of basil. Bright pastel colours adorn the page, as they do with the other illustrations. This colour palette, along with Burleigh's use of flowing lines and bird, butterfly, and flower motifs, have led Helen Haworth to consider her \\"delicate watercolours more appropriate to a fairy-tale than Keats\\". Kostas Boyiopoulus however, proposes that this statement does not take into account Burleigh's illustrations to Keats' ballad, \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\" which Boyiopoulus has described as a \\"nightmare\\" due to Burleigh's \\"faery's child\\" metamorphosing into a femme fatale. The first of Burleigh's illustrations for \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\" depicts a meeting with a beautiful woman who has a garland of roses adorning her hair, while the second portrays the woman seated, surrounded by her victims tied to trees. In Burleigh's first illustration the wind disturbs the woman - sending her dress billowing and hair blowing, while the belle dame in the second illustration is undisturbed by the fallen leaves collecting beneath her skirts. The male warriors and rulers are strung up in trees, completely defenceless, a dystopian vision of masculinity on the eve of modern warfare. What's more, the arabesque Art Nouveau pattern on the belle dame's dress presents the female antagonist as \\"current\\". Burleigh not only illustrated Keats' poems but also plays by Shakespeare. The Chira from the late 1920s is a typical Burleigh tempera painting. It is thought there could be a literary connection to this piece. The painting is very decorative, placing it within her Renaissance revival paintings. The model is likely to have been Burleigh's daughter Veronica, while the flowers and medieval city are figments of the artist's imagination. The Still Room (1928) is a later tempera painting by Burleigh in which she uses her daughter Veronica as the model. The painting is an example of Burleigh's use of a saturated colour palette, in comparison to her early illustrations for Keats's poetry, and the use of colour to direct the viewer's eye diagonally through the painting. In the summer of 1933, the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London.  Exhibitions  Burleigh exhibited throughout her career, including at the Royal Academy in London, at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh, the Society of Women Artists, with the New English Art Club, the Royal Cambrian Academy, the Sussex Women's Art Club, the Walker Art Gallery and at the Paris Salon. From 1912 to 1945 she was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, which included showing a series of 17 tempera paintings there between 1930 and 1935. Burleigh also contributed to the 1913 Arts and Crafts Society exhibition held at the Grovesnor Galleries.

This site includes the remains of a stone fireplace and the charred traces of a wooden and cob wall. Since June 1, 1988, this site has been classified heritage site by the Ministry of Culture and Communications of Quebec. The residual portion of the site is presumed to still contain archaeological elements favorable to the research and interpretation of the site.Directory of Quebec Cultural Heritage - Accessed December 22, 2019.  History of the site  This archaeological site of M√©tabetchouane was an important place of passage, meetings and Amerindian and Euro-Quebec settlements. According to Quebec archaeologists, this site had been occupied for approximately 2000 years before today. This site is presumed to have served mainly as a seasonal camp for the nomadic Amerindian groups of the region. Many objects and vestiges discovered during archaeological excavations are associated with these domestic occupations. The nature of the objects and their arrangements make it possible to document the native ways of life according to the times. One of the particularly interesting occupations corresponds to some 250 years encompassing the end of indigenous prehistory and the start of the period of contact with individuals of European descent; it is a pivotal time when traditional lifestyles are confronted with French and English culture. While the writings of the first explorers suggest that the site was once the scene of gatherings between indigenous groups engaged in trade, the small proportion of exotic objects accumulated during these two millennia on the site suggests that these interactions were more carried out on a regional scale.

Grogan (born 8 July 1966) is an Australian-born, US-based scientist specializing in immunology and cancer research. She is currently Chief Scientific Officer at ArsenalBio, a biotechnology startup based in California established in 2019. Prior to this she was Head of Adaptive Tumor Immunity and Principal Scientist in Cancer Immunology discovery research at Genentech, a multinational biotechnology company owned by Roche since 2009.  Research  Grogan's cancer research focuses on mechanisms of T cell activation, tolerance-induction and epigenetic modifiers, using integrative approaches, combining bioinformatics, biology and diagnostics. Most significantly at Genentech, Grogan and her lab identified key regulators of effector and regulatory T cells and moved targets into clinical development for autoimmune and oncology indications including anti-lymphotoxin in rheumatoid arthritis and anti-TIGIT for cancer immunotherapy Immunotherapies that harness the activity of the immune system against tumors are proving to be an effective therapeutic approach in multiple malignancies. However, tumors can also suppress these responses by activating negative regulatory pathways and checkpoints. Blocking these checkpoints on T cells has provided dramatic clinical benefit, but only a subset of patients exhibit clear and durable responses, suggesting that other mechanisms must be limiting the immune response. Grogan and collaborators have identified that TIGIT, an inhibitory receptor expressed by lymphocytes, may play a role in limiting antitumor responses. TIGIT suppresses T cell activation by promoting the generation of mature immunoregulatory dendritic cells  Background  Grogan was born in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. She completed her undergraduate degree in science at the University of Melbourne, Australia and a PhD in Immunology at Leiden University in The Netherlands.

Most of the Kurds who were deported were forced to leave their autochthonous lands, but the deportations also included the forced sedentarization of Kurdish tribes. Turkish historian ƒ∞smail Be≈üik√ßi emphasized the influence of fascism on these policies, and Italian historian Giulio Sappeli argued: \\"The ideals of Kemal Atat√ºrk meant that war against the Kurds was always seen as an historical mission aimed at affirming the superiority of being Turkish.\\" Occurring just after the Armenian Genocide, many Kurds believed that they would share the same fate as the Armenians. Background and Ottoman deportations (1916) During the 1910s, Kurdish-Ottoman relations were complex as some Kurds had sided with the Committee of Union and Progress against the Christian minorities for opportunistic reasons, while others had positioned themselves against the Ottomans and sided with the Christians. Kurdish manpower had also been used in the Caucasus campaign against the Russian Empire, but the Ottomans did not consider the Kurds as loyal, believing that they would cooperate with the Armenians and the Russians to further their own nationalist aspirations. On this, historian and genocide expert √úng√∂r points at the memoirs of Commander Ahmed ƒ∞zzet Pasha: Moreover, Talaat Pasha ordered in May 1916: As the forced sedentarization and deportations began, the authorities meticulously followed up to learn how well the policies were working, requesting information on whether those deported had assimilated into Turkish culture. Moreover, the largest Kurdish city Diyarbakƒ±r was declared a 'Turkification Region' and Kurds were deported from the area, as migrants from the Balkans were planned to be settled there. Kurds deported from Diyarbakƒ±r were allowed only to return with a permission by the authorities. In 1916, about 300,000 Kurds were deported from Bitlis, Erzurum, Palu and Mu≈ü to Konya and Gaziantep during the winter and most perished in a famine. When the liberal Freedom and Accord Party came to power in 1918 (to 1923), the few surviving deported Kurds were encouraged to return to their areas of origin. Turkish deportations (1923-1934) The official policy of the newly-founded Turkey was to dismantle traditional Kurdish Islamic tribal society and institutions, as well as to continue with the World War I CUP's Turkist assimilationist policies against the Kurds. Consequently, the Kurds began to mobilize for a resistance and a group of Kurds led by Colonel Xal√Æd Beg√™ Cibran√Æ briefly captured the town of Beytuessebap (see Beytussebab rebellion of 1924). In spite of being unsuccessful, the rebellion generated more distrust and accumulated into the Sheikh Said rebellion in 1925 which forced the mobilization of half of the Turkish army and prompted the Turks to bomb the Kurds. The rebellion was ultimately crushed and Sheikh Said executed. The far-right wing of the Young Turks exploited this situation and demanded tougher punishments and even pro-state Kurds were persecuted including politicians Feyzi Pirin√ß√ßioƒülu and Pirin√ß√ßiz√¢de Sƒ±dkƒ±. By mid-1925, the government initiated a pogrom in Diyarbakir executing civilians and burning villages to the ground which in total destroyed about 206 villages and killed 15,200 people. By late 1925, the new deportation law Law on Migrants, Refugees, and Tribes Who Leave Their Local Settlements Without Permission was implemented and the Kurdish elite - numbering about 500 - were deported to western Turkey. In Sheikh Said's village, all men were deported making a 14-year-old boy the oldest man there. The subsequent laws Settlement Law from May 1926 and Law Regarding the Transportation of Certain Persons from the Eastern Regions to the Western Provinces further allowed the government to deport Kurds. In the western parts of the country, Kurds experiencing xenophobia, and in some cases, lynching. Assuming that the laws had become successful, Turkey eased on the restrictions and allowed some of the deported to return in 1929. Similar to the previous Sheikh Said rebellion, the Kurds of Mount Ararat rebelled in the Ararat rebellion from 1927 to 1930 and was also subdued. Consequently, the Turkish Parliament discussed new methods to oppress the Kurds. Kemalist Mustafa Na≈üit Uluƒü argued that it was needed to \\"exterminate root and branch all of the remaining social institutions from the Middle Ages‚Äô so these would ‚Äònever blossom again\\". Thus, in 1934, the Settlement Law was passed which banned the Kurdish language in public and issued the settlement of Turks to the Kurdish region. On this deportation wave, √úng√∂r writes: During the 1940s, most of the survivors of the deported Kurds received amnesty and returned to Kurdistan. Aftermath of the Dersim rebellion Turkish authorities have treated present-day Tunceli area with suspicion after the rebellion and consequent massacre in the 1930s which included new conducts of deportations. Today, a majority of the people of Dersim live in Western Turkey and Europe.

Founded in 1964, it is one of India's oldest, most selective, and most prestigious technical universities. It is located in a campus of 800 acres (3.24 km¬≤). NIT Trichy is recognized as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India under the National Institutes of Technology Act, 2007 and is one of the institutions of the National Institutes of Technology (NITs) system. The university focuses exclusively on science, technology, engineering, management, and architecture. National Institutional Ranking Framework ranked the university 1st among the NITs, 8th for architecture, 9th for engineering, 35th for management and 24th overall in India in 2020. Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry named the university as the \\"University of the Year\\" in 2017. The university has academic and research collaborations with universities and research centers in India and abroad including the United States and United Kingdom and is undergoing accelerated growth through the World Bank-funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Program (TEQIP). History The iconic clock tower above the administrative building The Regional Engineering College (REC) at Tiruchirappalli was founded in 1964 under the affiliation of University of Madras, as a co-operative venture between the Government of India and the Government of Tamil Nadu to cater to the country's need for manpower in technology. The founding principal was Prof. P.S. Manisundaram, a pioneering educationist in India. He was a graduate of Loyola College, Chennai and the Technical University of Nova Scotia (now known as Faculty of Engineering, Dalhousie University), Canada; he pioneered the formation of Computer Science as a separate educational stream on the Indian scene. He served as the Principal of REC Tiruchirappalli from its formation in 1964 to 1982. In the early 1980s, the State Government began to find the logistics of controlling these colleges from Madras to be tedious and split the aegis into the Bharathidasan and Bharathiyar universities for the Tiruchirappalli and Coimbatore areas, respectively. In 1982, the college was thus incorporated under the Bharathidasan University umbrella, of which Dr. P.S. Manisundaram served as the inaugural Vice-Chancellor. The Institute would grant degrees under this name for the next 20 years, except for a brief stint under Anna University in 2001 and 2002. The college continued its progress under Bharathidasan University and introduced a Computer Science Department around 1984, split off the Mechanical Engineering Department's manufacturing stream into a Production Engineering Department and introduced the Instrumentation and Control Engineering Department in 1992. In 2001, Anna University was granted authority over REC Trichy. This was temporary, however, as the 40-year collaboration between the Center and the State Governments for all the RECs finally dissolved; the Center upgraded all the RECs to National Institutes of Technology (NIT) and completely took control of them under the Ministry of Human Resource Development. In 2002, former Minister of Human Resource Development Murali Manoher Joshi decided to upgrade the RECs to NITs with the goal of modelling each institute based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but with roots in Indian culture. In 2003, the institution was granted Deemed University status with the approval of the University Grants Commission / All India Council for Technical Education; it was renamed the National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli and was finally granting degrees under its own name. In 2007, the National Institutes of Technology Act was passed, giving the NITs equal footing to the IITs in terms of pay scales, funding, etc. The institute receives around ‚Çπ200 crores (US$31 million) every year from the Government of India which is usually spent for research, improving the infrastructural facilities in the campus and to bring international standards. As part of the golden jubilee plans, a brand new lecture hall complex, sports arena, convention center, computer center, dining messes and several hostels were built in the campus. NIT Trichy celebrated its Golden Jubilee anniversary on July 19 and 20, 2014, with the President of India Shri Pranab Mukherjee presiding over the event as the chief guest. On 12 August 2017, during the institute's 13th convocation, Shri N. Chandrasekaran Chairman of Tata Sons who is the alumnus of the institute having completed his master of computer applications from the institute in 1986, was conferred the degree of Doctor of Letters (Honoris Causa).  Buildings and locations  = Main Zone = alt= The campus spans and is one of the largest academic campuses in India. The main entrance is located on the southern end of the campus, facing National Highway 67. There is one other entrance, popularly called the Staff Gate. The institute's academic facilities are located in the southern half of the campus; these include the department buildings, laboratories and workshops, lecture halls, computer centres and the central library. The campus has separate buildings for the departments of nine engineering, architecture, management, computer applications, energy and environment engineering. Each department has its own library, in addition to the central library, which holds more than one lakh resources including books, periodicals and journals in print and electronic format. A new lecture hall complex named as \\"Orion\\" was inaugurated in the year 2014 as a part of the institute's golden jubilee campus development plans, and it currently serves for the undergraduate students. The old lecture hall complex which has forty lecture halls is currently used for the academic classes and lectures for first-year undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral students.  Administrative building  The administrative building with its clock tower is one of the institute's landmarks. This building houses the administrative offices and also the offices of the director and deans. The eastern and western wings of this building were occupied by the physics and chemistry departments respectively prior to the opening of new building buildings for the same departments in 2016.  Orion  alt= The Orion is the lecture hall complex for the undergraduate students and consists of twenty-four large lecture halls.

It is used by native Bornean (Banjarese and Dayak) in warfare, its usage rose prominently during the Banjarmasin war (1859-1906). Kotta mara is used in riverine warfare, as an armed vessel or simply a blockhouse or fortification to prevent enemy advance in the river.  Etymology  The word kotta comes from Malay word kota which in turn comes from the Sanskrit word ‡§ï‡•ã‡§ü‡•ç‡§ü (kota) which means fort, fortress, castle, fortified house, fortification, works, city, town, or place encircled by walls. Mara likely a corruption of Malay word muara which means estuary, thus the name kotta mara means estuary fort. In various publications it is also written as kotta-mara, kota mara, kotamara, and cotta mara. In Indonesian sources it is known as lanting kotamara, with the word ‚Äúlanting‚Äù meaning raft house, a traditional Banjar floating house. According to the Great Indonesian Dictionary (KBBI), kota mara means (1) Wall on a ship to protect men mounting the cannon (2) Terrace or wall over a castle which a cannon is mounted. According to H. Warington Smyth, kota mara means transverse deck bulkhead at stem and stern (of a ship).  Description  Kotta mara is shaped like a fort on a raft. The common shape is rectangular.van Rees (1867). p. 44. However, there are version with bastion-like structure protruding on every corner.van Rees (1867). p. 43. The kotta mara with bastion, like the one seen by Jacob Jansz de Roy, is constructed from wooden logs of various size and diameter. The bastions had 4 cannons each, with the total of 16 cannons. The bastion is fortified with wooden wall of small sloping. Toward the center of the kotta mara is double row of palisade wall, one is higher than the other. At the center is the main structure of the ‚Äúcastle‚Äù, about 12 feet (3.7 m) high to the top, over which 200 musket could fire.de Roy (1706). p. 61. The main castle wall is not sloped. The simpler kotta mara, is described as being similar to Banjar shore battery. It is rectangular in shape, with various size from as small as 5 Netherland ell (3.5 m) long to as large as to ‚Äúfill the entire space of river passage‚Äù. The general arrangement of the kotta mara was practically the same; the first one, from Sungai Kayu, was 5 Nd. ells (3.5 m) long, 5 Nd. ells wide and 3.5 Nd. ells (2.45 m) high, with 8 firing holes, which were situated just above the water level. The large kotta mara (like that of Pulau Kanamit) is described with more accuracy: An elongated square window is located on a heavy raft, which is assembled from large trees. The inner space of this window is spacious in the length and width such that a deck can be laid from the split bamboo to form the floor and also to rig firm yokes and trestles against them, against which the top edge of the palisade will rest, while the feet of the posts are prevented by the above-mentioned window from slipping. 300x300px The wall of the fort is double; the outer covering consists of vertical, slight inwardly sloping trees which, placed against each other, are forming a parapet of nearly 5 Nd. palm (50 cm) thickness; a second wall of ironwood beams, similarly of a thickness of almost 0.5 Nd. ells (0.35 m) lies horizontally within this outer cover. This wall is prevented from falling backwards or loosened by means of anchoring and bracing.van Rees (1867). p. 45. The raft is closed at the top by a cover of fairly heavy parts, was completely bomb-proof by an attic of beams.van Rees (1865). p. 85. There are 4 small alcove hole at equal distances in the long side, very low on the water and almost all with polders (heavy pieces of wood) on the inside to place lila (lela - Malay cannon) on it; in the short side there are 2 holes, so that the kotta mara could be armed with 12 lilas. The outer covering was arranged in such a way that if a hole was made by a penetrating bullet, it would immediately closed again by the rolling of other parts or logs, which were set against the outer posts completely loosely. 300x300px The upper deck is almost 0.75 Nd. ells (0.525 m) below the top edge of the palisade, which at that height has not been doubled with ironwood. On the deck were two small houses set up, in one of those houses a cell block was found, which could hold 5 or 6 prisoners. The spies assured the Dutch that Juragan Kuat had intended this block for the officers he would take prisoner. A magazine of foodstuffs, blocks and shackles to store prisoners of war, a roof to sleep in and many other conveniences were present.van Rees (1867). p. 111. When that kotta mara was taken, it was still not fully completed, so probably many more ornaments were missing. However, the 4 main posts of the building had already been carved in the shape of a man with an exceptionally large nose, mouth with sharp teeth, and the lower part of the body ending in the tail of a caiman.van Rees (1867). p. 46. There was enough room inside the building for about 50 people, however the operation of the artillery must have been difficult, since the braces and struts crossed each other frequently, but everything bore the signs of solid construction. Here are dimensions of the raft encountered on 27 July 1859 from De Bandjermasinsche Krijg: Length of the raft: 40 Nd. ells (28 m) Width: 12 Nd. ells (8.4 m) Long side of the palisade: 25 Nd. ells (17.5 m) Short side of the palisade: 5 Nd. ells (3.5 m) Height: 3.5 Nd. ells (2.45 m) Thickness of the wall from below: 1 to 1.2 Nd. ells (0.7-0.84 m) Thickness of the wall from above, below deck: 0.9 to 1 Nd. ells (0.63-0.7 m) Average draft: 6 feet (1.8 m)  History  A drawing of a floating water castle (kotta mara) from Hachelijke reys-togt van Jacob Jansz de Roy. According to W. A. van Rees, the kotta mara has been known by the Banjarese for centuries. The first kotta mara encountered by European is from 1691, being mentioned in the book ‚ÄúHachelijke reys-togt van Jacob Jansz de Roy na Borneo and Atchin, in sijne vlugt of Batavia derwaards ondernomen in het jaar 1691 en vervolgens‚Äù as floating water castle (drijvend Water-Kasteel). This water-building was formidable that when the European shot a 8-pounder cannon to it, albeit with good charge, the cannon could not harm it. During the Banjar war (1859-1906), there are several accounts of Kotta mara encounter by the Dutch, but only few are known to be written. According to Ahmad Barjie the kotta maras were ordered by Raden Jaya Anum of Middle Kapuas, also known as Juragan Kuat. Among the most famous encounter is the one from 27 July 1859. The Dutch learned in Pulau Petak that a preparation of attack was being made at Sungai Kayu and three fortified rafts were being prepared; pembekkel (village chief) Soelil, who received his orders of prince Antasari, intended to launch a new attack on Pulau Petak, in which the rafts (kotta mara) would occupy the steamships, while the main attack with a large force on the land side would happen. On those occasions, the Celebes came to Pulau Petak and steamed (27 July) with the Tjipanas to the Sungai Kayu to stop the Banjar plan by an offensive act. They found (under the fire of new entrenchments) two kotta maras, one of which had not been completed. Only after a firefight of 4 hours could the rafts be taken over and dragged to Pulau Petak. The completed raft, which braved the fire of the 30-pounders for hours, was described by the Dutch in their report, mentioned earlier in this page.van Rees (1865). p. 84. At August 3, the Dutch was informed that there was still a kotta mara in Tongoehan or Pulau Palangkie. Steamship Celebes then steamed the Kapuas river to Palangka on 5 August, without finding any trace of a benting (Malay fort) or hostility anywhere. Second class sea lieutenant W. Steffens was sent in armed barkasBarkas in Dutch language may be translated as longboat or sloop. The modern indonesian word kapal bargas/kapal barkas means launch (boat). on exploration, between Pulau Kanamit and the shore by rowing. After about half an hour, the officer returned and announced that the barkas had come across a kotta mara that filled the entire space of the passage, that large masses of people on that fortification had curiously stared at the barkas, without starting hostilities, and that it might be possible to get the Celebes backwards in the passage to shoot the kotta mara with the aftside 30-pounder cannon. Returning to Plankey in the evening, Mr. Maks informed that it would be impossible to enter the passage with the Celebes.van Rees (1867). p. 110. In the morning at 8:15 on August 6, 1859, Celebes was anchored before the passage. The armed barkas Ardjoeno, under the command of sea Lieutenant Clifford Kocq van Breugel, protected the troops, and exchanged some rifle and cartet bullets (iron cannon shot) with the enemy hiding in the undergrowth. Finally the barkas came in the side of the kotta mara, releasing a cartet shot from the 12-pound carronnade, but with no effect; the shot fell like grains of sand along the poles of the kotta mara's parapet.van Rees (1867). p. 49. The enemy shot guns on the sloops, but hastily left the fortification as soon as the steamship Celebes started to cooperate with the rear middle cannon. Probably it's because the Banjar and Dayak had been fighting with the Dutch's 30-pounder before, and at 35 ells (24.5 m) rangeThere are also report that said the range is 50 ells (35 m). the Banjar and Dayak didn't like it (because at this range the 30-pounder is able to penetrate the kotta mara). The first bullet shot took the head off one of the corner posts; a second shot destroyed a couple of plates. The third shot with a 16 duim (43.2 cm) grenade (exploding shell) struck in the middle of the long side, penetrated the outer casing and remained lodged against the inner casing of ironwood and exploded there. The outer poles were thrown apart over a length of almost 8 Nd. ells (5.6 m), the pieces also thrown high into the air, and a big hole emerged.van Rees (1867). p. 50. Then the armed sloop under the command of W. Steffens was sent to take over the fortification. At about 11 o'clock the Dutch flag flew on the kotta mara and in the evening at 9 o'clock this fortification has been dragged to Plankey.

He was an advisor to both King KalƒÅkaua and Queen Lili ªuokalani. After the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, his advisory position was retained during the Provisional Government and the Republic of Hawaii. Ena Road in Waikiki is his namesake. Name His Hawaiian name was either John Liwai Kalaniopuuikapali-o-Molilele-ma-wai-o-Ahukini-Kau-Hawaii Ena, sometimes shortened as John Liwaikalaniopuu Ena, or John Kauluhinano Ena. Ena received his Hawaiian language name Liwai Kalaniopuuikapali-o-Molilele-ma- wai-o-Ahukini-Kau-Hawaii from an incident in the 18th-century reign of King Kalani ª≈çpu ªu. According to tradition, Kalani ª≈çpu ªu hanged his kahuna Naonaoaina after the latter was unable to dig freshwater from the cliffs of M≈ç ªƒ´lele, near Kalae in the district of Ka ª≈´. His gravestone bears the name John Kauluhinano Ena.  Early life  Ena was born November 18, 1845 in Hilo, on the island of Hawaii, of Chinese-Hawaiian ancestry. His father was Zane Shang Hsien (), part of the first wave of Chinese master sugar planters who emigrated to Hilo during the reign of Kamehameha III. His surname was Zane or Tseng. Like the other Chinese planters of that era, Zane adopted a Hawaiian name, John Ena Sr., from his Cantonese given name \\"Hsien\\", which is also pronounced \\"In\\". He married a Hawaiian woman, high chiefess Kaikilani or Kaikilaniwahinealiiopuna (1820‚Äì1878). Kaikilani was the descendant of the ali ªi (chief) of the district of Puna on the island of Hawaii and notable ancestors include Ululani, Ali ªi of Hilo, and Kamanawa, one of the royal twins (with Kame ªeiamoku) who advised Kamehameha I in his conquest of the Hawaiian Islands. Another more distant ancestor was her namesake Kaikilani, Ali ªi Nui of the island of Hawaii. Zane and Kaikilani's children were Amoe Ululani, John Jr., and Laura Amoy, all of whom attended American missionary Lucy Wetmore's children's school in Hilo. John Jr. was later educated at Pohukaina School in Honolulu and at the Roman Catholic College of  ªƒÄhuimanu. One of his early jobs was as a bookkeeper in Hilo.  Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company  Canadian-born Thomas R. Foster had emigrated to Hawaii in 1857, married Mary Robinson, and joined her family's shipbuilding trade. He founded in 1878 to engage in Hawaii's burgeoning steamship business. Ena moved to Honolulu, and found employment clerking for Foster, investing a portion of his wages in company stock. When Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company was launched in 1883, Foster was its president, and Ena was a founding partner. Other partners at incorporation were William Foster, George Norton Wilcox and the company's second president Captain William B. Godfrey. Ena was the company's vice president when Godfrey retired in 1898, at which time Ena became corporate president, a position he held until illness forced his retirement. The bark John Ena, in which he owned stock shares, bore his image on the vessel's figurehead. Ena was also a shareholder in the bark Hawaiian Isles.  Government service  John Ena wearing his Hawaiian royal orders Ena served on both KalƒÅkaua's Privy Council of State from 1888 to 1891 and Lili ªuokalani's Privy Council of State from 1891 to 1893. He was decorated as an Officer of the Royal Order of the Crown of Hawaii on October 7, 1886 and his obituary also claimed he was also decorated with the Royal Order of the Star of Oceania. During the reign of Lili ªuokalani, he was appointed to the Board of Health on March 30, 1891. Ena was elected to the legislative assembly in 1892. He ran as a candidate of the National Reform Party against National Liberal candidate E. B. Thomas. He was elected as a member of the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature, for a four-year term representing the island of Oahu.; ; ; From May 1892 to January 1893, the legislature of the Kingdom convened for an unprecedented 171 days, which later historian Albertine Loomis dubbed the \\"Longest Legislature\\". During this session, Ena joined his fellow members in ousting a number of Queen Lili ªuokalani's cabinet ministers for want of confidence, a power introduced by the Bayonet Constitution of 1887 which empowered the legislative branch of government at the expense of the Queen. According to later testimony of Hermann A. Widemann in the 1893 Blount Report, Ena was one of the politicians who aspired to appointment as cabinet minister. The monarchy was overthrown on January 17, 1893, by the Committee of Safety, with the support of United States Minister John L. Stevens and the landing of American forces from the USS Boston. The Provisional Government was established until an annexation treaty with the United States could be ratified.; During this turbulent time, Ena joined the side of the Provisional Government. Under the Provisional Government, Ena served on the Advisory Council to president Sanford B. Dole, as well as on the Board of Health, and the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry. Members of the Constitutional Convention, Republic of Hawaii, 1894. John Ena stands next to President Dole in the center of the group Ena was a participant of the Constitutional Convention for the oligarchical Republic of Hawaii, which was established on July 4, 1894, and was one of the five Native Hawaiian signatories of the Republic's constitution.; After Dole was named as the president of Republic of Hawaii, Ena was among the same advisors who were carried over in their positions from the Provisional Government.  Personal life and investments  His first wife was Lydia Pi ªikoi, daughter of high chief Jonah Pi ªikoi and his wife Kamake ªe. The couple divorced in 1883. With his second wife Mary Kaho ªoilimoku Lane (1859‚Äì1890), sister of future Mayor of Honolulu John C. Lane, he had nine children, including Mary Kapualahaole, Clara Keaolani, Thomas Foster Kaalokaiaokalani, Daisy Miliakalani, Ana Ululani, John Kalanikauhema and Mabel K. Two daughters Daisy Kekuakapulani and Violet died in infancy. After Mary died in 1890, he subsequently married his wife's younger sister Maria Kealaulaokalani Lane (1862‚Äì1924), who survived him. By the time of Ena's death in Long Beach, California on December 12, 1906, he had amassed considerable wealth through commerce and real estate holdings. He expanded his business investments in Honolulu to include shares in Honolulu Iron Works and Peck & Co. Although Ena inherited a Hilo sugar plantation from his father, his own investments brought the aggregate total to eight sugar plantations. He owned multiple residences in Hawaii, waterfront property in Honolulu and Waikiki, a farm, and varied extensive acreage throughout Oahu. Outside of Hawaii, Ena invested in Mexican gold mines and California real estate. When illness forced his retirement, he relocated to his Seabright Ranch, one of his two ranches in Long Beach. He also owned a home in Berkeley, a ranch in Kern County, and real estate in San Francisco. Ena was buried at the King Street Catholic Cemetery in Honolulu, also known as the Honolulu Catholic Cemetery. He was laid to rest next to his mother Kaikilani, his second wife Mary Lane, and their infant daughters: Daisy and Violet. Ena Road in Waikiki is named for him.

Diagnosis should including blood tests for calcium, potassium, and magnesium along with an electrocardiogram. Initial treatment of exposure involves removing contaminated clothing and washing with large amount of water over at least 30 minutes. Other measures include applying calcium gluconate cream. It is estimated that about a thousand cases occur a year. Most people affected are adult males. Signs and symptoms HF burns, not evident until a day after Symptoms of HF exposure include irritation of the eyes, skin, nose, and throat, eye and skin burns, and bone damage. Complications may occur due to fluoride toxicity. Once absorbed into blood through the skin, it reacts with blood calcium and may cause cardiac arrest. Burns with areas larger than 160 cm2 (25 square inches) have the potential to cause serious systemic toxicity from interference with blood and tissue calcium levels. In some cases, exposures can lead to hypocalcemia. Breathing in the HF fumes can result in fevers, pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs), bleeding, and low blood oxygen. Cause Hydrogen fluoride is used in a number of industries including glass etching and electronics manufacturing. It is generated upon combustion of many fluorine-containing compounds such as products containing Viton and polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) parts. Hydrofluorocarbons in automatic fire suppression systems can release hydrogen fluoride at high temperatures, and this has led to deaths from acute respiratory failure in military personnel when a rocket-propelled grenade hit the fire suppression system in their vehicle. Hydrofluoric acid can be released from volcanoes, sea salt aerosol, and from welding or manufacturing processes. Pathophysiology In the body, hydrofluoric acid reacts with the ubiquitous biologically important ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. Formation of insoluble calcium fluoride is proposed as the cause for both precipitous fall in serum calcium and the severe pain associated with tissue toxicity.Hoffman, Robert S. et al. (2007) Goldfrank's Manual of Toxicologic Emergencies. New York: McGraw-Hill Professional, p. 1333, . Diagnosis Diagnosis should including blood tests for calcium, potassium, and magnesium along with an electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG changes may include QRS widening and a prolonged QT interval. Treatment Initial treatment of exposure involves removing contaminated clothing and washing the affected area with large amount of water over at least 30 minutes. Calcium gluconate cream is then usually applied. If pain continues calcium gluconate can be injected into the affected area or given by injection into a vein or artery. Surgical removal of the affected tissue may be required. The calcium gluconate is a source of Ca2+ that sequesters the fluoride ions. Other special rinsing solutions may also be used. Inhaled HF may require oxygen therapy and tracheal intubation. In this situation neutralized calcium gluconate may be used.

He soon left this, and instead found work making waterproof garments. In 1929, he changed his surname to \\"Ainley\\", a change which his brother, Ben, had made two years before.John Saville, \\"Ainley, Theodore (Ted)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.X, pp.1-3 Ted was influenced by Ben's socialism, and both Ted and his younger brother David became founder members of the Manchester Young Communist League (YCL) in 1922. Ted joined the Communist Party of Great Britain the following year, and also began working full-time for the YCL, as its organiser for North East England and Glasgow. He was elected to the National Executive of Committee of the YCL, and in 1929, attended the Lenin School in Moscow. Ainley returned to the UK and his former post in 1930, then in 1931 moved back to Manchester, and in 1932, on to London, where he took a post with the Daily Worker. This proved only short-term, and he returned again to Manchester, working at the Books and Books shop until it closed in 1935. He then returned to making waterproof clothing, joining the Waterproof Garment Workers' Union, and in 1937 he was elected as general secretary of the union. However, other figures in the union objected to his communism, and he was soon removed from office. He resigned from the union, and instead found work as an organiser for the Shop Assistants' Union. In 1943, Ainley changed job again, becoming National Organiser for the Association of Scientific Workers. He won election as the union's general secretary in 1949, but took early retirement in 1951 due to poor health. He returned to working for the Communist Party, spending time as secretary of its Economic Committee, and then of its Cultural Committee.

Born in Manderfeld, Tofahrn grew up in Germany, France, Belgium and Italy, as his father moved to find work. During World War I, he worked as an agricultural labourer, then in industry, before finding work on the railways in Losheim. Because he was fluent in both French and German languages, he was able to play a leading role in the transfer of railways in the Eupen-Malmedy region to Belgium. He also joined the Belgian Railwaymen's Union, and took part in its 1923 strike.Richard Temple, \\"Tofahrn, Paul\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.X, pp.208-210 For his activism, Tofahrn was sacked, and he instead began working full time for the union. In 1928, he became assistant secretary of the railwaymen's section of the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF). His language skills saw him working closely with Ernest Bevin, but in 1931 he moved to Zurich to take a research post with the International Federation of Food and Drink Workers. He returned to Belgium in 1934, and became regional secretary of the Belgian Labour Party in the Tournai area. He proved successful, and became the party's acting general secretary, but the position was not made permanent, and so in November 1938 he returned to the ITF, now as secretary of the railwaymen's section. Tofahrn moved to Paris in 1939, and London in 1940, to avoid the Nazi advances, and keep the ITF operating. In 1943, he was appointed as Assistant General Secretary of the ITF, remaining in post under Jaap Oldenbroek and then Omer Becu, despite frequent disagreements with both. In 1955, he resigned, to become General Secretary of the International Federation of Employees in Public and Civil Services. As leader, he focused on liaising with the International Labour Organization, and encouraging the growth of trade unions in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Tofahrn had a heart attack in 1962, and took six months off work, but later returned and retired only in 1968.

In 1936 a military post known as Mappi Post was set up on an hill named Tamao, at the confluence of the Digoel and Kawarga River, to prevent Headhunting raids which were creating unrest and migrations, and assert Dutch control over the area.Boelaars, Jan H. M. C. (1981). pp.4‚Äì5. Following the Japanese invasion of New Guinea in 1942 and the subsequent bombing of the post by Japanese aircraft in 1943Donald F. Thomson. (1953). p.3., the post was essentially abandoned and only manned by a coastwatcher. In 1944, the Australian Army moved in, installing a radar station which had been previously operating in Bupul, with the goal of spotting Japanese airplanes coming from the west to attack Merauke.Simmonds, Ed (2002). pp.26‚Äì30 However, as the Japanese airfields were wiped out by allied aerial bombardments, the radar station became useless and the Australian army departed in 1945.Arnold, Anthony Peter (2013), p. 328. Shortly after the war in 1946, the administrative center of the Mappi district was moved from the Mappi Post to the village of KepiBoelaars, Jan H. M. C. (1981). pp.4‚Äì5.Steenbrink, Karel. (2008). p.549., a protestant mission with a church was established there, and catholic religious orders soon followed, such as the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart or Our Lady of the Seven Dolours in 1948.Steenbrink, Karel (2015). pp.342‚Äì343. The Dutch were also successful in eradicating the Headhunting raids in the area, the last one occurring in 1949.Steenbrink, Karel (2015). pp.343‚Äì344 The brothers of Our Lady of the Seven Dolours introduced a regional project with an agricultural centre in Mappi. This Welfare Plan Mappi and the Regional Plan, which encouraged the cultivation of cocoa and rubber, were joint ventures of the mission and the Dutch government.Ipenburg, A. N. (2004) The christian missionaries carried on their work after the withdrawal of the Dutch from the area in 1962, and the subsequent transfer of Western New Guinea to Indonesia. in 2002, following the separation of Mappi Regency from the Merauke Regency, the town became its administrative seat.  Geography  Kepi is located along the Obaa river, and is surrounded by swamps. During the rainy monsoon, the rivers in the region regularly overflow their banks and often flood large areas for several months. Climate Kepi has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round. Demographics As per 2018 the population was 5,647, according to the Indonesian Government estimates.Indonesian statistics. (2019). p.28. Transport Kepi is served by regular flights from Merauke and Mimika through the nearby Kepi Airport. The town can also be reached by boats going up the Oba river, itself connected to the Digul and the Odamun rivers through the Mappi river.

He served as a member of the Landtag (state parliament) in the so-called People's State of Hesse (\\"Volksstaat Hessen\\") between 1921 and 1922 and again between 1931 and 1933. After 1945, with Hesse now a part of the US occupation zone till May 1949, and thereafter a constituent element of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), Rink served as a member of the Landtag (state parliament) of Hesse between December 1946 and November 1950. Life Aloys Georg \\"Ludwig Wiener\\" Rink was born into a working class family in Vienna. or Urberach (near Darmstadt). Sources differ. Georg Rink, his father, worked as a \\"rabbit/hare fur cutter\\"(\\"Hasenhaareschneider\\") and was a member of the \\"Clothing Workers' [Trades] Union\\" (\\"Bekleidungsarbeitverband \\"). After leaving school Aloys Rink trained as an industrial metal worker. Supporting himself as a skilled metal worker and living in Urberach, he joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1896. The government had allowed Bismarck's \\"Anti- Socialist Laws\\" to lapse in 1890, meaning the party was no longer outlawed, but at the time when Rink joined it the SPD was still regarded by most commentators as something from outside the political mainstream. He would resign from the party in 1919, but rejoined in 1922. As a young man, hungry for education, he attended the Trades Union Academy in Berlin as well as the Party and Commercial Academy in Frankfurt am Main. Sources mention but do not identify other colleges where he attended courses. Rink also became a noted autodidact, informing himself in particular depth about Politics and Economics. On 26 June 1905 Aloys Rink married Regina Groh at Urberach. The marriage produced four recorded children. During the war years Rink had connections with the anti-war Spartacus League. In 1917 the SPD finally broke apart as internal tensions over the party leadership's parliamentary support for the war became unsustainable: Aloys Rink was part of the break-away faction that became the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). In November 1919 he attended the USPD party congress in Leipzig as a delegate. At the end of 1918 the USPD itself splintered: by or during the early part of 1919 Rink, like most USPD activists, had switched his political allegiance to the newly formed Communist Party. Shortly afterwards he accepted a position as a party secretary for the municipality of Urberach. Between 1919 and 1933 Aloys Rink served as a member of the Urberach town council. On 27 November 1921 he was elected as one of just two Communist members of the 70 seat Hesse state parliament. However, during the aftermath of the so-called March Action he backed the former party leader Paul Levi, whose political differences with the newly powerful hardliner faction continued to intensify. Levi was then, in the context of a further party split, expelled from the mainstream communist party. Rink's own position as a Communist Landtag member became untenable and he resigned his seat on 19 July 1922. His seat was taken by Katharina Roth. Aloys Rink resumed his membership of the SPD and returned to his work as a skilled metal worker, while still continuing to serve on the town council. As German politics became increasingly polarised, and following an unsuccessful Reichstag candidacy in 1930, Rink returned to the Landtag at the election of 15 November 1931, but now as one of 15 SPD members. The total number of seats was, as before, 70. The 1931 election was the first in which the National Socialists won the largest number of seats in the Hesse Landtag. The only other party to increase its vote share was the Communist Party. The vote shares of all the conventionally democratic parties had fallen since 1927. However, following a successful court case brought by the so-called \\"Economic Party\\" the 1931 state election in Hesse of was declared invalid by the State Court on 9 May 1932. A new election was therefore held on 19 June 1932. The vote share of the National Socialists again increased, so that now they held 32 seats rather than 27. However, the SPD also staged a small recovery (at the expense of the Communists), the number of their seats increasing to 17. Aloys \\"Ludwig\\" Rink retained his seat. After the National Socialists took power nationally, the country was rapidly transformed into a one-party dictatorship during the first part of 1933. The new government was keen to bring Germany more closely into line with the anglo-french government model by imposing a powerfully centralised government structure: under the terms of legislation enacted art the end of March 1933 (\\"Vorl√§ufiges Gesetz zur Gleichschaltung der L√§nder\\") state level parliaments were abolished, formally with effect from 7 July 1933. Aloys Rink's parliamentary career came to an end for the duration of the Hitler period, along with his role as a town councillor. Between 1933 and 1945 Aloys Rink survived several periods in state detention. In October 1933 he was taken into the concentration camp at Osthofen (near Worms). Later on he was held at the prison in Darmstadt for slightly under half a year, starting in December 1939. Later he was detained at Dachau for several months during 1944. With the fall of the National Socialists in 1945, non-Nazi party membership ceased to be illegal, and Aloys Rink, by now aged 64, resumed his SPD membership, becoming a co-refounder of the party in Hesse. While resuming his long-standing former role as a town councillor in Urberach, he took a senior post with the welfare department for Dieburg District. Under the post- war military occupation the state of Hesse was relaunched, and a new 90 seat democratically elected Landtag (state parliament) was inaugurated in December 1946. The SPD, with 38 seats, became the largest single party in the assembly, although it fell far short of an overall majority, and the first post-war state government was accordingly a SPD/CDU \\"grand coalitioh\\". Aloys Rink served as an SPD member of the assembly, representing Electoral District 2 (\\"Wahlkreis II\\" - Offenbach & Dieburg) between December 1946 and November 1950. Aloys Rink died at Gro√ü-Umstadt (in the Darmstadt-Dieburg region) on 21 June 1971. Sources asserting that he died in nearby Urberach are incorrect. Interviewed forty years later, Klaus-Joachim Rink described his grandfather as \\"a very balanced man, with a great sense of justice\\" (\\"...ein ausgeglichener Mann mit gro√üem Gerechtigkeitsempfinden.\\"). A memory which the grandson particularly treasured was the time that Aloys Rink had given him a bicycle, which in the context of the post-war austerity had been an exceptionally generous present.

Born in Basford, Nottingham, Charlesworth left school when he was thirteen, to become an apprentice hosiery trimmer. Within his first year of work, he took part in a lengthy strike, and as a result, was allowed to join the Basford and District Hosiery Trimmers' and Finishers' Society, despite being under the usual age for admission.Richard Stevens, \\"Charlesworth, John James\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.X, pp.42-47 Charlesworth was conscripted in 1918, serving in the Staffordshire Regiment. The war was over before he completed training, but he nonetheless served until 1921. He then returned to his trade in Nottingham, to find high unemployment, and these two experiences led him to become a socialist. In 1921, Charlesworth's union merged into the new Nottingham and District Hosiery Finishers' Association (NHFA), in which he became increasingly active. He also joined the Independent Labour Party, and was soon appointed as joint secretary of its Nottingham branch. He was elected to the executive of the NHFA in 1930, as vice president in 1933, and then president in 1934. He also represented the union to the National Federation of Hosiery Dyers and Finishers, and on the Nottingham and District Trades Council. Charlesworth joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1930, and although he did not keep this a secret, it did not initially impeded his trade unionism. In 1940, he was removed from the trades council's executive for his support for the People's Convention, but with the backing of the NHFA was soon reinstated, becoming president of the trades council in 1941 and 1942, then assistant secretary from 1943. In 1942, Charlesworth was elected as full-time general secretary of the Nottingham and District Hosiery Workers' Society. The union was in a poor financial position, losing members, and faced disputes between its men's and women's sections. Charlesworth managed to almost double membership, to 3,500, and resolve the disputes, but he believed that the various local hosiery unions should merge. In 1945, the union joined the new National Union of Hosiery Workers (NUHW), with Charlesworth becoming its Nottingham District Secretary. In 1947, Charlesworth was elected as secretary of the NHFA, winning 1,007 votes while the second-placed candidate took only 124. Within four years, he had increased its membership from 1,700 to 2,700, increased its provision of education and recreation, and took the leading role in the Hosiery Finishers' Association. By the late 1960s, he felt that the union was threatened by changes in the trade, and he led its merger into the NUHW, completed in 1969. The union became the Nottingham (Finishers) district of the NUHW, and Charlesworth continued as its secretary until his retirement in 1973, also working as secretry of the Hosiery Finishers' Association. Charlesworth was elected as secretary of the Nottingham and District Trades Council in 1950, focusing on industrial affairs, peace, and opposition to racism. He also pioneered the \\"Union Scene\\" programme on BBC Radio Nottingham. From 1953, he also served on the executive of the Labour Research Department (LRD), becoming president in 1955. Charlesworth retired from the trades council in 1970. In 1971, he was awarded the Silver Medal of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress. Charlesworth retired as president of the LRD in 1982, but was made honorary president. He remained politically active until shortly before his death, in 1993.

Duel Monsters in 2000. The series is being directed by Nobuhiro Kondo with screenplay by Toshimitsu Takeuchi and character designs by Kazuko Tadano and Hiromi Matsushita. It began airing in Japan on April 4, 2020 on TV Tokyo. On April 28, 2020, it was announced that after episode 5, the remaining episodes would be delayed for five weeks due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sevens premiered, the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game announced an update to the Master Rules, unofficially called \\"Master Rule 5\\". Effective April 1, 2020, it is now possible again to summon Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz monsters directly to the Main Monster zones without a required Link arrow pointing to it. Pendulum and Link monsters however retain their previous rules. No new type of cards were introduced to the main card game. Instead, a new format separate from the main game known as Rush Duels was introduced in a vein similar to Speed Duels. However, unlike Speed Duels, Rush Duels come with its own special rules. Normal Summoning is unlimited, though Tribute Summon rules for Level 5 or higher monsters still apply. All card effects are a \\"hard\\" once per turn, meaning a certain card's effect can only be used once during that turn. There are special satisfactions required for the player to fulfill before card effects can be used. Players can only use cards designed for Rush Duels, which have a special frame and a \\"RUSH DUEL\\" tag at the bottom of the card. Cards based on monsters from the main card game are known as \\"Legend Cards\\". Each player is only allowed one copy of one Legend Card in their deck. This Rush Duel format is currently exclusive in Japan. Reception References External links *Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens Official website at TV Tokyo *Yu-Gi-Oh!

At its peak, various branches of the dynasty controlled several Jagirs within the Maratha Empire, and later became protectorate Princely states in British India. The branches of the dynasty, in order of creation: Kurundvad Senior (est. 1733), Miraj Senior (est. 1750), Sangli (est. 1782), Tasgaon (est. 1808), Jamkhandi (est. 1811), Miraj Junior (est. 1820), and Kurundvad Junior (est. 1854). History The Patwardhan family were of the Chitpavan Brahmin caste, originally from the village of Kotawde in Ratnagiri, in the state of Maharashtra. The patriarch of the family, Haribhat, was the family priest for another Chitpavan Brahmin family, the Joshi family, who served as the Chiefs of Ichalkaranji. Three of Haribhat's sons served the Peshwas and distinguished themselves during various conquests. They were each rewarded for their efforts with a Jagir, together covering all the land between the Tungabhadra and Krishna Rivers. Although significantly reduced in size, their Jagirs were later to be raised to the status of Princely state under the British Raj, and the Rajas of Jamkhandi, Kurundwad, Miraj and Sangli were all lineal descendants of these Patwardhan brothers. After the Treaty of Salbai aligned the Marathi with the British, the three Patwardhan chiefs lent their armies in the British campaign against Tipu Sultan. They gained a reputation of heroism and success in battle. Their contributions became highly valued by the British, and in 1804 Arthur Wellesley called the Patwardhans \\"the most ancient friends that the British Government have in the Maratha Empire\\" and \\"the most respectable of all the Peshwa's subjects properly so called\\". Branches =Kurundvad Senior= This branch was established in 1733 by Trimbakrao I of Kurundvad. This state became a British protectorate on 5 May 1819, and gained seniority when a junior branch split on 5 April 1854, forming the Kurundvad Junior State. =Miraj Senior= This branch was established in 1750 by Govindrao I of Miraj. This branch gained seniority when a junior branch split in 1820. =Sangli State= This branch was established in 1782 by Chintamanrao I of Sangli. This state also became a British protectorate on 5 May 1819. This state later became a Salute state, with a hereditary salute of 11 guns. =Tasgaon State= This branch was established in 1808 and was lapsed under Lord Dalhousie's Doctrine of Lapse in 1848. =Jamkhandi State= This branch was established in 1811 by Gopalrao Ramchandrarao of Jamkhandi. =Miraj Junior= This branch was established in 1820 by Madhavrao I of Miraj Junior. =Kurundvad Junior= This branch was established in 1854, after Trimbakrao of Kurundvad Junior and Vinayakrao of Kurundvad Junior split from the senior branch.

An ephemeral acid saline lake is a lake that is relatively high in dissolved salts and has a low pH, usually within the range of <1 - 5 and does not have standing water year round. These types of lakes are identified by high concentrations of evaporite minerals, notably halite, gypsum, and various iron oxides allowing the lakes to become hypersaline. Low pH and evaporite minerals are positively correlated, allowing lakes with lower pH's to have visible evaporite mineral \\"crusts\\". Due to the highly unusual geochemistries present in these lake systems, they are considered an extreme environment in nature. Due to the low acidity and high salinity, as well as the periodic total evaporation of the lakes, the waters are generally uninhabitable to life larger than microbes. The microscopic organisms that do live there possess a startling array of biodiversity, spanning from halophilic bacteria and archaea to acidophilic fungi. Because of the unusual ability for life to survive in such a harsh environment, acid saline lakes have recently been studied for their relevance to the field of astrobiology. Acid saline lake systems are considered a rarity within the natural world, and the highest concentration of acid saline lakes occur in Western Australia. They form most favorably under semi-arid to arid conditions and have been closely connected to stable interior cratons and closed paleodrainage basins, allowing groundwaters to evaporate to the extreme salinity and acidity values present today. Unlike most natural acid saline systems, these lakes are unusual in that they are neither volcanically or hydrothermally fed and are not in direct contact with large sulfide deposits yet have brines with pH that can reach <1. Geology and geochemistry The extreme acidity and salinity of these lakes are largely influenced by geological, climatic, and geographical conditions that have developed over the past 2 million years. Geographically, the lakes are located on Archean basement rock within the stable interior craton known as the Yilgarn Craton. These ancient rocks were formed by closed basins via fault block valleys and have been incised by paleodrainage in the Eocene epoch. The most common rock are granites and gneisses, with anorthosites and quartzites being somewhat less common. The Archean complexes are highly weathered and deformed, and are economic sources of aluminium and nickel, along with other minor metals. As the craton is tectonically inactive and hasn‚Äôt dropped below sea level since the Mesozoic, it has resulted in sparse zones of sedimentary rock layers such as lignite, siltstones, sandstones, and marine limestones. These deposits are primarily thought to have been deposited during the last two marine transgressions of the Tertiary, which allowed some of the incised valleys to be filled with seawater and other marine sediments. Paleodrainage from rivers ended in the lake Eocene and the Darling Range uplift successfully dammed river flow and created isolated lake basins. Because of the varied terrain, lakes can be hosted directly on basement Archean rocks while others reside on weathered regolith, Tertiary sandstones and limestones. As such, the varying geochemistry‚Äôs of the lakes are in part attributed to the different water rock interactions due to varying host rock. In addition to geologic setting, the climate of Western Australia plays a major role in how the lakes evolve seasonally. The lakes exist in a semi-arid landscape and are directly impacted by seasonal weather variations of South Western Australia. The dry season falls primarily during the winter months (June ‚Äì August) and the wet season is during the summer months (December ‚Äì March). Despite being semi- arid, the landscape usually experiences all four seasons with precipitation differences in each. During the wetter months the lakes will be at flooding stage, decreasing the acidity (median = 3.3). Conversely, during the dry months as evapoconcentration dominates and the lakes experience an increase in acidity (median = 4.4) and salinity. Meteoric precipitation also impacts precipitates, as halite and gypsum can be shown to dissolve after rainstorms. Rainfall also washes in organic matter from local flora and fauna into the lakes, increasing the total dissolved solid content. Geochemically, the average pH range of the lakes are from >1 to 5 and the average salinity is >25%, nearly 8 times that of seawater. Most of the Western Australian waters are sodium chloride (NaCl) brines with varying, but regionally excessive, amounts of calcium, potassium, aluminium, iron, bromine and silicon (Ca, K, Al, Fe, Br, and Si). Most of the ions within the waters are Na and Cl (~88%) but can vary from 60% - 98% in some lakes. The most acidic of the lakes (ex. Wave Rock Lake, pH 1.7) has the lowest Na and Cl ions, with much higher concentration of other common ions. Many elemental components within the lake systems are made up of ions that are usually only found in trace amounts in other natural lakes. The more acidic the waters are, the more recorded Fe, Al, and Si elemental compounds. Conversely, waters with pH‚Äôs higher than 4 are nearly void of HCO3‚àí. The amount of Fe in the waters has a positive correlation with salinity, with the higher the salinity of the water the higher Fe value is present. However, this same correlation is not seen with Al and Si ions. Even more different than usual brines, in acid saline systems the amount of Al is magnitudes higher than that of Ca. Some of the most concentrated Al is at 8000mg/L, which is much higher than that of acid mine waters or seawaters. Other trace ions are present in these lakes in large amounts as well. On average, strontium (Sr) values can get up to 65mg/L and increase with salinity. 59% of the sampled waters have detectable amounts of Mn (>46 mg/L) and Cu (<9.5 mg/L). Less common trace ions include zinc, nickel, molybdenum and cobalt (Zn, Ni, Mo, and Co) in detectable amounts, and show a positive correlation with increasing acidity and salinity. Other metal ions exist to a lesser extent but are not as high in values. Metals such as cerium, lead, antimony and tellurium (Ce, Pb, Sb, and Te) have been identified. In some lakes antimony concentration values exceed that of 3 mg/L, nearly 500 times that of the EPA toxicity limit. High elevations of metallic ions and other trace elements are in most acidic of solutions represent the influence water-rock interactions play in the formation of these brines. Lakes that are close to nickel sulfide deposits and undergo oxidation are thought to contribute to local acidity. Lakes that are much farther away with slow groundwater flow are thought to be influenced predominately by the oxidation of the organic and sulfide materials hosted in the Archean basement rocks and coal deposits. During rain events when the acidity is lessened, the lakes quickly readjust to more acidic conditions. This is in part influenced by constant iron cycling and redox reactions that generate H+ ions. Al- phyllosilicates (ex. kaolinite and Fe-muscovite) are the main authigenic phyllosilicates in the lakes. They most likely form from direct precipitation from the acid lake waters, direct precipitation from shallow groundwaters to make cements, and alteration of feldspars and amphiboles. They are closely associated with other minerals within the lakes, such as gypsum, halite, hematite, jarosite, and alunite. The stability of the minerals are predominately controlled by pH and cation availability, and where kaolinite is typically most stable at neutral pH's in others waters, the positive function of Al and Si ions to increasing acidity allow kaolinite to precipitate at pH extremes. Relevance to Mars Other crucial mineral formations that form within these lakes include Al and Fe/Mg phyllosilicates. These clays play an interesting role in the lakes geochemistries and have been studied to better understand how acid saline lakes could be a useful planetary analogue for Mars. While acid saline saline systems such as those in Western Australia are unusual on Earth, there have been similar sedimentary records found within the Mawrth Vallis and Nili Fossae regions of Mars. Additionally, clay minerals have been detected in these regions on Mars, which would indicate that large reservoirs of water had to exist for their formation. The existence of jarosite, alunite, acid-tolerant kaolin groups, and chlorides on Mars indicate that these areas could share some characteristics of the Western Australian lakes. In the search for life on Mars, clays can play a crucial role in trapping and preserving organic materials. While organics are not well preserved within the clays of the lake system, they do record D values for formational waters that can shed light on potential habitable conditions. Other minerals in the lake have a higher affinity for preservation. Particularly evaporite materials, where rapid precipitation can trap and preserve organics within the crystal structure. Research done by Melanie R. Mormile et al. in 2003 show that microbes could be trapped as fluid inclusions within precipitating minerals such as gypsum and halite. Those microbes could be detected under Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis.

Jack Charlesworth, president of the union from 1934, left in 1942, but was overwhelmingly elected as general secretary in 1947, taking 1,007 votes to his nearest rival's 124. Under his leadership, membership grew from 1,768, to 2,708 by 1951, and 3,200 by 1969. In 1955, the union affiliated to the Trades Union Congress for the first time.Annual Report of the Trades Union Congress (1955), p.118 By the late 1960s, Charlesworth had become concerned that changes in the industry threatened the union's future.

The family rose to great prominence in Iraq and later America. Members of the family are notable for being the Ayatollahs of Karbala. Some of its members are founders of a number of Islamic centres in the United States. Additionally the family claim agnatic descent from Muhammad's daughter Fatimah, carrying the honorific title of Sayyid, and the children of the females of this family whos fathers are non Sayyids carry the title Mirza.  History and Lineage  The al-Qazwini family is a religious intellectual family, that followed through for generations. It's patriarch is Sayyid Muhammad-Baqir al-Qazwini, who is known as muallim al- sultan (teacher of the sultan) because he was the teacher of the governor of Kermanshah, Mir Muhammad-Ali Mirza, the son of Fath Ali Qajar. He emigrated from his hometown, to Najaf in 1771, and then to Karbala, where he settled in 1783. Muhammad-Baqir was accompanied by his brother Muhammad-Ali al-Qazwini. The lineage of the al-Qazwini family is as follows: >  øAbd al-Karƒ´m bin Ni ømatullƒÅh bin Murtadha bin Radhi al-Dƒ´n bin A·∏•med bin > Mu·∏•ammad bin ·∏§usayn bin  øAbdallƒÅh bin Mu·∏•ammad bin A·∏•med bin Musa bin ·∏§usayn > bin IbrƒÅhƒ´m bin ·∏§asan bin Mu·∏•ammad bin MƒÅjid bin Ma øad bin Isma øƒ´l bin Ya·∏•ya > bin Mu·∏•ammad bin A·∏•med al-ZƒÅhid bin Ibrahim al-MujƒÅb bin Mu·∏•ammad al- øAƒÅbid > bin Musa al-KƒÅthim bin Ja øfar as-SƒÅdiq bin Mu·∏•ammad al-BƒÅqir bin  øAli al- > Sajjad bin ·∏§usayn al-Shahid bin  øAli Ibna Abi Talib.  Persecution in Iraq  = Communism = During the days of the communist red tide, under the rule of Abd al-Karim Qasim, Sayyid Murtadha al-Qazwini supported Ayatollah Sayyid Muhsin al-Hakim's fatwa deeming communism an infidelity and atheist. He took a strong stance against Qasim, by rejecting to join the iftar he had prepared for the religious convoy in Ramadan, 1960, which lead to his imprisonment, making him the first cleric to become a political prisoner in Baghdad. = Baathism = With the advent of the despotic Baathist regime in the late 1960s and early 1970s, The al-Qazwini family and other Shia scholars and clerics increased efforts to educate the masses to combat the regime. Sayyid Mortadha al-Qazwini and his first cousin, once removed, Sayyid Mohammed Kadhim al-Qazwini were among the leading scholars in engaging in Islamic activism against the regime. After several years, the regime identified the al-Qazwini family as an ideological threat to his regime. In 1980, Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad-Sadiq al-Qazwini, was arrested and imprisoned by Saddam Hussein because he did not support the Baathist regime. Amnesty International deemed him as the oldest political prisoner in the world at the time. Following the few weeks after the collapse of the regime in 2003, the family found documents verifying his death in Saddam's prisons.

She has been a member of the Bundestag since autumn 2009. She was one of her party's eight top candidates for the 2013 Bundestag elections.  Career  Gohlke graduated from high school in 1995 and then studied communication science. She completed her studies with a Magister Artium. From 2004 to 2008, she worked as a project manager in event management as well as in market and opinion research. From June 2008 until her entry into the Bundestag, she was employed in the Regional Office South of the parliamentary group Die Linke in the German Bundestag. Gohlke first joined politics in 1991 in the movement against both the Gulf War and the racist pogroms in the 1990s. During her studies in 1997, she joined the student protests against the austerity plans at the universities. In 2001, she joined the globalization-critical Attac movement. She became a member of the coordination group of Attac Munich, to which she belonged until 2003, and took part in the protests against the World Economic Summit in Genoa in the summer of 2001. Gohlke became a member of the newly founded WASG. In June 2006 she was elected to the executive committee of the WASG in Bavaria. After the fusion of the party with the PDS, she was a member of the Bavarian state executive committee of The Left from 2007 to 2014. Since October 2016, she has been deputy district spokesperson in Munich. In autumn 2008, Gohlke stood for election as a direct candidate in the Munich-Bogenhausen constituency in the Bavarian state election and won 5.2% of the first votes. In the 2009 federal election, she received 5.9% of the votes as a direct candidate in the Munich- East constituency, and entered the German Bundestag for the first time as a member of parliament via the state list of The Left. The party nominated her as one of its eight top candidates in January 2013.Lenz Jacobsen: Nicole Gohlke Die Attrappen-Spitzenkandidatin Zeit online, 29 May 2013, accessed 12 January 2016 She was re-elected, is a member of the Committee for Education, Research and Technology Assessment, and is the spokesperson for higher education and science policy of The Left in the Bundestag. She was also re- elected via the state list in 2017. Within her party, Gohlke is in the Socialist Left caucus.  Memberships  Gohlke is a member of the GEW, ver.di, and the Association of Democratic Scientists (BdWi). She is also a member of the Advisory Board of the Studentenwerk and the Parliamentary Advisory Board of the Fernuniversit√§t in Hagen, of the F√∂rderkreis demokratische Volks- und Hochschulbildung, and of the Kurt-Eisner-Verein in Bavaria.  Positions  Gohlke criticizes university tuition fees, the Bologna Process, and expensive housing for students. As a spokeswoman on higher education policy for her parliamentary group and a member of the Education Committee of the German Bundestag, she advocates improvements in study conditions. The increased burdens on student's time in the Bachelor's program new 3-year degrees limited the possibility for students to finance their studies through work, which would be aggravated by tuition fees. She also calls for the restriction of fixed-term employment contracts in the higher education sector: only \\"formal and certifiable qualification goals\\" (master's thesis, doctorate, habilitation) should justify a time limit. Gohlke's opinion is that there should be \\"permanent positions\\" for \\"permanent tasks\\". In 2016, she rejected the cooperation of the University of Bremen with the Bundeswehr and praised the legal opinion of the association \\"NaturwissenschaftlerInnen-Initiative Verantwortung f√ºr Frieden und Zukunftsf√§higkeit\\" (Natural Scientists' Initiative Responsibility for Peace and Sustainability), which had presented the incompatibility of the cooperation with the civil clause of the University Constitution. Justice Senator Martin G√ºnthner had considered the cooperation to be admissible, since the Bundeswehr was a \\"peace army\\". In February 2017, the Bremen Senate decided in favour of further cooperation in the spirit of G√ºnthner. In the debate about the Left's refugee positions, she repeatedly took a public stand against faction leader Sahra Wagenknecht. In January 2018, together with Niema Movassat, Tobias Pfl√ºger, Norbert M√ºller, and other members of parliament, they published the appeal \\"Solidarity is indivisible\\" on the platform bewegunglinke.org, which advocated \\"full freedom of movement and equal social and political participation for all people living in Germany.\\" Further activities were announced at the first advice of the group in April 2018. When Wagenknecht's collective movement \\"Aufstehen\\" did not participate in the demonstration \\"Unteilbar\\" in October 2018, Gohlke called it \\"incomprehensible to distance oneself from thousands of people who support left-wing, humane politics.\\"  Controversies  A unanimous decision by the Left parliamentary group against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign in 2011 only came about because Gohlke and 14 other members stayed away from the vote.Leandros Fischer: Zwischen Internationalismus und Staatsr√§son: Der Streit um den Nahostkonflikt in der Partei DIE LINKE.

She also demanded that the PKK ban be lifted. At that time, PKK troops were fighting the Islamic State at Koban√™. Due to the flag showing, Gohlke's parliamentary immunity was lifted by the Bundestag after a heated debate. Gohlke's parliamentary colleague Jan van Aken described the suspension as absurd and showed a picture of the PKK flag, for which he received a call for order. The accusation was tried before the Munich District Court, which merely warned Gohlke and imposed a fine of 1,000 euros.Christian Rost: Schuldspruch f√ºr ein Vorbild, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 7 July 2015 Gohlke was, until 2015, the last member of the Bundestag to be observed by the Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution.

In 1941-42 he was present during the siege of Leningrad by the Germans during the Second World War and helped to build defensive structures.

From 1956 to 1995 he worked at the Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg and was a part-time lecturer at Saint Petersburg University (LSU) from 1951 to 1986. In 1965 he defended his doctoral thesis before the Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg on the subject of the 1617 Treaty of Stolbovo and trade relations between Russia and the Swedish state in the first half of the 17th century.

Shaskol'Skii specialised in the history of Russian relations and trade with the Baltic and Scandinavia in the medieval and early-modern periods, particularly trade and diplomatic relations with Sweden. He also addressed the Normanist theory that proposed that the origins of the Rus' were Norman, and therefore Scandinavian, taking a nuanced position that broadly accepted the anti-Normanism endorsed by Soviet historiography but also acknowledged that there was primary evidence for parts of the Normanist position. The theory was historically controversial because of disputed evidence and politically controversial because it dealt with questions of national identity.\\"Review: Fifty Years of Soviet Scholarship on Kievan History: A Recent Soviet Assessment\\". Thomas S. Noonan, Russian History, Vol. 7, No. 3, (1980), pp. 334-349. His book, Normanskaia teoriia v sovremennoi burzhuaznoi nauke (Norman theory in modern bourgeois science) was published in 1965 and also dealt with the history of the Varangian controversy. He was instrumental in the wider dissemination of primary source material from archives through his work on editorial boards and wrote many articles that made extensive use of primary sources. \\"Reviewed Work: Ekonomicheskie otnosheniia Rossii i Shvedskogo gosudarstva v XVII v.

In the book he showed that the accepted Soviet position that the trade went mainly through Arkhangelsk on the northern coast, due to the blocking effect of the Swedish Baltic provinces, was wrong and in fact Russian trade in the Baltic was strong.

Miller's spherical chess A variant described by Don Miller in 1965 and later modified by Leo Nadvorney. The fields of the board form eight rings around the sphere each consisting of eight squares and with the fields touching the poles degenerated into spherical triangles. Murali's spherical chess This variant is played on a board obtained by drawing two sets of circles with orthogonal axes of rotation on the sphere. Both players pieces are initially arranged on opposite hemispheres. Each player has a standard set of king, queen, bishop, knight and rook arranged in a square pattern surrounding a central empty square. These pieces are surrounded by 16 pawns in another square layer. Pawns move one field orthogonally away from their initial position with the exception of the four pawns at the four corners of the setup, which have two possible directions. They all capture one field diagonally forward. The other pieces have the moves from standard chess adapted to the spherical geometry. For example, the rook can move any number of fields orthogonally up to one of the \\"poles\\" of the grid and continue on the other side of the sphere, except that a \\"null move\\" is not allowed. This rule regarding \\"null move\\" also applies to the bishop and the queen. Pawns promote when reaching the fields where the opponents pieces other than pawns are initially placed. Tuveson and Saul's spherical chess A variant developed by Jared Tuveson and Lukas Saul. The board has differently shaped fields, some of them being triangles and others squares.

Early life  Dolgushin was born in a small town in the Tobolsk district of Siberia. His father was a judge and member of the minor nobility.  Revolutionary career  In 1866, Dolgushin moved to St. Petersburg, supposedly to study, but has main purpose was political activities. He led a group of 13 students from Siberia, who began as a 'commune' - a cultural club offering mutual help and a library - and evolved into a political organization advocating Siberian independence. A portrait of Nikolay Chernyshevsky, whom they regarded as an honorary Siberian because he was in exile there, hung at their meetings. In 1869, Sergey Nechayev made contact with the group during a short visit to St. Petersburg, and recruited one of its members, Pyotr Toporkov, to his conspiratorial Russian Revolutionary Society. In January 1870, Dolgushin and other members of the group were arrested, but after a year and a half in prison, they were acquitted in August 1871 for lack of evidence. By autumn 1872, Dolgushin ‚Äì married with an infant son ‚Äì had formed a new student circle, the Group of Twenty-Two, who planned to foment a peasant rebellion by promising to free them from debt, redistribute land, end military conscription, abolish the internal passport system and set up village schools. Their propaganda was expressed in religious tones as if they were creating a \\"religion of equality\\". In March 1873, they moved to Moscow, then to a small house near the city, where they set up a printing press and began handing their books and pamphlets out to the peasants, who were astonished to be offered them free.  Arrest and exile  The group was discovered when police arrested one of its members. Dolgushin was arrested in September 1873. He and 11 others were put on trial, which lasted a week, in July 1874. The two most active members, Dolgushin and Lev Dmokhovsky, were sentenced to five years hard labor. They were also subjected to symbolic execution, during which one of the group, Nikolai Plotnikov, started a demonstration by shouting \\"Down with the Tsar\\". As retribution, members of the group were confined in Kharkov Prison, instead of Siberia, in such harsh conditions that one of their numbers, a schoolteacher named Dmitri Gamov, went insane and died in the prison hospital. Dolgushin succeeded in getting an account of prison conditions smuggled out, to be printed illegally in St Petersburg in 1878. In 1880, Dolgushin was sentenced to be deported to work in the mines in the Kara district of Siberia. En route, he was held in prison in Krasnoyarsk, where his father was then based as a judge. His wife moved to Krasnoyarsk with their son to be near him. One of his fellow prisoners there, Sofya Bogomolets, was insulted by a guard on the same day that Dolgushin was denied a visit by his son. Dolgushin reacted by slapping the offending guard. For that, he was sentenced to a further ten years hard labour. While in Kara, he helped fellow revolutionary Ippolit Myshkin to escape, for which he was transferred to the Peter and Paul Fortress. In 1884, he was moved to Shlisselburg, where he died of tuberculosis.  Personality  Dolgushin was a natural leader. Writer Vladimir Korolenko, who met him in Siberia, thought that he was the \\"most significant\\" of the political prisoners there. Elizaveta Kovalskaya, who was in prison with him in Krasnoyarsk, wrote that \\"he impressed me as a person constantly burning with some inner fire, all the while maintaining an external calm in his movements and speech. Only his dark, rather sombre eyes betrayed some kind of profound suffering. His small slender figure appeared in the common room only at eating times. He made witty, biting remarks, but he never smiled. It was as if some sort of mask had hardened his face.\\"  References  Category:1848 births Category:1885 deaths Category:Narodniks Category:Russian exiles to Siberia Category:Prisoners of Shlisselburg fortress Category:Prisoners who died in Russian detention Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis ","title":"Alexander Dolgushin"},{"id":"62650132","text":"Francis Goolden (1885 ‚Äì 1950) was a Royal Navy officer who served during the First and Second World Wars.

After high school, Osteen attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and graduated in the first medical school class in 1982.  Career  = Private Practice = Soon after finishing his surgical residency in Arkansas, Osteen joined a private practice in Little Rock. Osteen stayed at the practice for 20 years before transitioning back to his home in Houston to help his brother Joel take over as pastor of Lakewood. After a medical mission trip in 2005, Osteen felt compelled to use his trained surgery skills to help others who lack access to medical care. = Humanitarian Work = Osteen ended his private career in 2005, instead choosing to address the lack of basic surgical care for those in Sub-Saharan Africa. Partnering alongside Christian aid-organizations like Samaritan's Purse and World Vision, Osteen travels to rural parts of Zambia and Kenya to provide surgical care, deliver medical equipment, and train new doctors for communities otherwise isolated from healthcare. In an interview about the role of the church in the fight against medical poverty, Osteen says: > ‚ÄúWe, as the American church, can‚Äôt get so insulated that we forget poor, > suffering people,‚Äù Paul says. ‚ÄúIf we in the church become so religious we > look the other way, it‚Äôs a sad thing.‚Äù Osteen also serves on teams that respond to immediate disasters, like the Iraq refugee crisis, and often travels to areas suffering immediately after catastrophic events transpire. = Advocacy = Osteen founded a medical conference for missionary work, called the M3 Conference, in 2016. The goal of the conference is to connect medical workers with organizations working to relieve poverty in least developed countries.

From 1940 to 1943, he served as Resident-General in Tunisia for the Vichy French government.Halpern, p. 311 Naval career Esteva entered the (Naval School) in 1898 from which he left a ship's teach in 1900. Lieutenant, he participated in the First World War. Assigned to the Mediterranean squadron, he took part, among other operations, in the Battle of the Dardanelles on the occasion of which he particularly distinguished himself. In 1920, he was a professor at the in Toulon, in 1927, captain, Esteva decided to follow a pioneering path in the nascent naval aviation, an original choice for an officer of this rank. Promoted Rear Admiral in 1929, he was Director of Maritime Aviation, then Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1930 before becoming Vice Admiral in 1935. He left for the Far East where he was commander-in-chief of the naval forces. He commanded several naval units where he hoisted his flag aboard the light cruiser . His stay in the Pacific led him to regularly visit the British bases of Hong Kong and Singapore as well as to fully appreciate the rise in power of the Imperial Japanese Navy. On his return to Metropolitan France, his versatility and his skills made him the ideal to occupy the function of inspector of the maritime forces. Subsequently, in 1939, he took command of the French naval forces in the South. =Vichy= After the armistice of June 1940, Esteva, like many other admirals including Fran√ßois Darlan, chose to serve the Vichy regime. A trusted man of Marshal P√©tain, he left for French North Africa. On July 26, 1940, he became general resident of France in Tunisia. In this position, he succeeds Marcel Peyrouton who is called upon to take up his new ministerial functions in Vichy. In November 1942, when the Anglo-Americans launched Operation Torch, the admiral was still stationed. Then begins a series of procrastinations which ends with a collaboration with the Italo-Germans. The November 9, 1942, he began by condemning the arrival on the ground of El Aouina of Luftwaffe aircraft sent on the spot by Field Marshal Albert Kesselring. But very quickly, out of loyalty to P√©tain and under pressure from Pierre Laval's instructions, Esteva was forced to change position. He provided German pilots with several French bases on Tunisian territory as well as fuel stocks. In the process, he neutralized Admiral Derrien who had encouraged his troops to join the Allies in order to fight against the Axis. In May 1943, when the Allied troops entered Tunis, Esteva was repatriated to France by the Germans. The admiral was evacuated on May 7 by plane and at the same time as the consul general of the Third Reich in Tunisia. In Paris, he was taken to the Ritz (then partly occupied by the Luftwaffe) in order to be put there under house arrest while waiting for the German authorities to rule on his fate. Locked in his room, he was guarded by German sentries. Finally released on May 18, he arrived at Vichy where he was warmly welcomed and congratulated by P√©tain for his loyalty to the orders received. German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop sent him a message of sympathy and thanks him for having \\"facilitated the conduct of the war by the Axis powers. Esteva said at his trial before the high court: \\"This letter doesn't interest me. I am a French civil servant. I had nothing to do with von Ribbentrop\\". In North Africa, however, a War Council, chaired by General Henri Giraud on May 15, sentences Esteva to the death penalty in absentia. =Arrest and trial= On 22 September 1944, he was arrested by French police in Paris and then imprisoned in Clairvaux Prison. A new trial is organized. Accused of delivering wheat to the Italian army in Libya, granted facilities to Axis troops to establish themselves on the coast and Tunisian airfields after the Allied landing in 1942, recruited workers and combatants in a Phalanx African in the service of Germany, manifested on several occasions his sympathy for the German cause, he sketches the so-called ‚Äúdouble play‚Äù defense, often repeated later. Thus, he affirms that in spite of his fidelity to P√©tain, it was not a blind discipline which guided him, that he only composed with the enemy to save the essential: his departure would have done pass Tunisia under Italian control, the delivery of wheat to the Italians in Libya was compensated by identical shipments to the French populations, he sabotaged the recruitment of the African Phalanx, he did not have enough troops, with 12,000 men, to oppose the Axis forces, the Allies being too far away. Admiral Muselier testified in his favor during this trial. He was nonetheless found guilty of treason on March 15, 1945. Militarily degraded by the High Court of Justice, he was sentenced to forced labor for life. Claude Morgan, resistant communist founder of the French Letters, takes this punishment to witness, in an article entitled \\"The smallpox\\", to denounce the indulgence of justice, which did not condemn him to death, and the complicity which would benefit Vichy, saying: \\"If Esteva is not a traitor, it is because there is no traitor.\\" Sick, Esteva was pardoned on 11 August 1950. He died a few months later and was interred in Reims. Leaning, in The Great Trials of Collaboration, on Esteva's journey, and in particular his Tunisian period and his trial, Roger Maudhuy considers, on the basis of several testimonies, that Esteva helped the local Resistance and provided false identity documents to members of the Jewish community, communist activists, German escapees and Alsatian refugees. General de Gaulle, in his War Memories, commented on this trial in these terms: > ‚ÄúAdmiral Esteva was sentenced to imprisonment. At the end of a career which, > until these events, had been exemplary, this old sailor, led astray by false > discipline, found himself an accomplice, then a victim, of a harmful > enterprise.\\" For his part, Pierre Messmer said to Roger Maudhuy: \\" What do > you want? The High Court could not begin with an acquittal. Esteva did not > deserve such a fate, I agree. Two or three years later, he would no doubt > have been acquitted. But it was war ... P√©tain, Laval, all those > responsible, the big ones, were out of reach. He was there. He was unlucky, > that's all.‚Äù He was decorated with the Order of the Francisque.

Belew also served as the letterer for the Mary Worth comic strip from its inception as Apple Mary in 1935 until the early 1970s.  Early years  Born in Aurelia, Iowa, Belew attended Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, but did not graduate. She then moved to Chicago, where she worked for a time as a ballet dancer with the Chicago Civic Opera Company before becoming a freelance illustrator. Belew lived in Chicago for most of her life until relocating to Fort Myers, Florida, in the late 1960s.  Mary Worth  Ruth Belew was the letterer for the Apple Mary comic strip, created by Martha Orr, from its inception in 1935. Allen Saunders, who had created the Steve Roper and Mike Nomad strip in 1936, was asked to take over as writer when Orr left the strip in 1939 to start a family. Saunders changed the name of the strip to Mary Worth and brought in artist Ken Ernst, but retained Belew as letterer. Saunders, who was based in Toledo, Ohio, would work with Ernst, who was based in California who would then ship the strips to Belew in Chicago for lettering.  Dell Mapbacks  Dell's earliest paperbacks featured a map on the back cover depicting some element of the book, whether it was a city block, and apartment, or a cattle trail in the old west. This innovative idea has made Dell's \\"Mapback\\" books coveted among collectors. In his catalog-index of Dell paperbacks, William Lyles theorized that Ruth Belew drew nearly all of the more than 500 maps that appeared on the back of Dell paperbacks between 1942‚Äì1951, though because records of Dell's artists are scarce, he was only able to confirm that she had drawn around 150.

She was a founder and president of World Union of Women for International Concord and honorary treasurer of the Peace and Disarmament Committee of the Women‚Äôs International Organizations. She represented Switzerland at the 5th Quinquennial Convention of the International Council of Women. As president of a peace movement, Clara Guthrie d‚ÄôArcis has become well-known internationally.  Life  Clara Guthrie was born on 22 February 1879 in New Orleans in a family of James Guthrie and Clara Cocke. Her father was a distinguished member of the Louisiana Bar and her grandfather, Judge Edwin T. Merrick, had served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Louisiana. Through her grandmother, Caroline E. Merrick, Guthrie early came in contact with the women‚Äôs movement in the United States. In 1902, Guthrie owned and managed a small factory in Mississippi. Her first husband was Philip Cocke with whom she had a daughter, Elizabeth. In 1911 Guthrie married for the second time to Swiss businessman Ludovic d‚ÄôArcis. She then moved to Geneva and joined her husband in running a successful import business for American automobiles and other consumer goods. Among other business activities they distributed General Motors cars in Switzerland. Clara Guthrie d‚ÄôArcis died on 12 May 1937 in Geneva.  Activity  In 1915 d‚ÄôArcis together with 36 other women from various countries founded World Union of Women for International Concord in Geneva. The goal of the organization was to work on international concord and become a movement of women from all the countries for moral education based on individual discipline and commitment. d‚ÄôArcis remained the president of World Union of Women for International Concord until her death. During World War I, d‚ÄôArcis was active in furthering industrial and economic relations between Switzerland and France and between Switzerland and the United States. She also led fundraising efforts to provide food for child victims of the war in neutral Switzerland and was one of the founders of the International Union of the Save the Children Fund. In the interwar period d‚ÄôArcis served as a treasurer of the Peace and Disarmament Committee of the Women‚Äôs International Organizations. She led the committee‚Äôs fundraising efforts and in 1934 launched fundraising campaign urging American manufactures of consumer goods to recognize that peace time production was more profitable than manufacturing for wars. Peace and Disarmament Committee published a ‚ÄúPeace-Roll of Industry‚Äù in which such corporations as General Motors, U.S. Steel, and Shell Union Oil declared peace essential to prosperity.  Views  Clara Guthrie d‚ÄôArcis believed that education for peace, led by women, could create a peaceful world order. She asserted that women had a special role to play in peace buildings, having maternal concern for the preservation of human life. Her experience as a peace activist and international businesswoman convinced her that economic causes of war were paramount. She argued that bankers and industrialists who funded wars and produced arms and war materials had to be re-educated to invest in consumer and other peacetime products. D‚ÄôArcis believed that moral considerations must influence business decisions and businessmen must promote peace and disarmament.

His heirs still own several of his sketches, drawings and notes. His work was rediscovered after featuring in Siena tra Purismo e Liberty, a 1988 exhibition in Siena. Life =Training= Arturo Viligiardi, The Denial of St Peter He was born on via dei Maestri in Siena to Giuseppe, a repair worker on the railways, and Giuseppina Fallani. The sculptor Giovanni Dupr√© recognised Arturo's artistic vocation and invited him to join evening classes at the La Stella drawing school. In 1882 Viligiardi took the courses at the Accademia di belle arti di Siena, where he studied under Luigi Mussini and Alessandro Franchi. In 1884 his professor G. Bandini agreed to collaborate with him on paintings for Orvieto Cathedral and then further paintings on two rooms in prince D'Ambr√≤'s villa in Naples. Viligiardi won first prize in the nude and drawing categories of the annual competition at the Accademia back in Siena. In 1888 he won the Biringucci prize for a painting entitled The Arrest of Corradino of Savoy and a prize for another entitled The Denial of Saint Peter, now in the Accademia in Siena. Both works were of the Risorgimento-historical school, inspirated by Franchi's art. = Early works = While training, he collaborated with Cesare Maccari on dome frescoes at the Sanctuary of Loreto and Genoa's chiesa della Consolazione. Viligiardi's 1890 Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery show how heavily influenced he still was by Maccari. His 1891 Samson as a Prisoner won a Ministry of Public Education competition for a four-year pension. He presented 39 different designs for the competition to design the facade of Arezzo Cathedral, but that competition was then cancelled - one of them was exhibited at the 1904 St Louis International Exhibition. At San Secondiano Co-Cathedral in Chiusi he painted a fresco entitled St Catherine's Vision of the Virgin Mary, experimenting with the \\"finto mosaico\\" (fake mosaic) technique, influenced by Byzantine art. He also exhibited at the Mary Magdalene at Calvary (1894) and the cartoons for the fresco at the \\"Esposizioni riunite\\" in Milan. He next worked in Rome at San Clemente al Laterano and on Malta at San'Agostino Church, followed by a fresco in the apse of Santa Maria Assunta, the parish church in Allerona. In 1898 he produced the painting St Margaret of Alacoque in Ecstacy before a Vision of the Holy Cross. He painted a Madonna and Child on a gold background for the chapel at palazzo Gianturco in Naples and also painted frescoes on the chapel walls of Christ in Glory with Angels. Inspired by the Neapolitan painter Francesco Paolo Michetti, in 1895 he produced Vita, now in the Galleria nazionale d'arte moderna e contemporanea in Rome. Later attracted by symbolist themes, he simplified his pictorial representations to concentrate on figures and eliminate unnecessary details - examples of this are his Calvary and Purgatory. He also decorated the San Lorenzo chapel in Rome's San Paolo fuori le mura before painting frescoes for the same basilica's quadriportico. = New commissions = Noah Building the Ark, mosaic panel by Arturo Viligiardi (1906) He exhibited The Temptation of St Catherine at the 1904 International Exhibition in Rome. He then assisted the architect Guglielmo Calderini in the \\"Roma Moderna\\" redesign of Rome's street plan and in building the city's palazzo di Giustizia. In Florence he produced new canvases for the Cathedral to replace earlier ones which had deteriorated too badly to be restored and designed three new panels of scenes from the Book of Genesis to replace medieval ones which had collapsed from the mosaic ceiling of the Florence Baptistery about a century earlier. He designed a cottage for himself on via Po in Rome, whilst in 1909 marquess Chigi-Zondadari commissioned a painting entitled La Flora from him for his palazzo Primoli in Rome. The Societ√† Cultori di Architettura di Roma commissioned designed from him on \\"Roma sparita\\" (vanished Rome). In 1909 he was appointed to the new chair in \\"Decorative art and building furnishings\\" at the Accademia in Siena, a chair which seems to have been set up especially for him. He produced designs for the Accademia Tedesca's Villa Massimo, again in Rome. Count Guido Chigi- Saracini entrusted him with rebuilding palazzo Chigi-Saracini in Siena and designing its new interiors, before also commissioning a sculpture entitled La Riconoscenza from the artist for the Cappella del Voto in Siena Cathedral. From 1916 to 1926 Viligiardi was director of Siena's Istituto di Belle Arti. = Final years = In 1928 he sculpted Bust of St Catherine for the town of Pincio. He took on a wrought iron factory in Siena and built count Galeotti's villa in Chiusi. In 1930 a gallery in Genoa hosted a retrospective of his works. Count Chigi-Saracini still asked him for the St Catherine. He next produced a series of designs for Siena's traffic planning before producing his final work, the Monument to the Fallen at Certaldo. He died in Alexandria.

The population became critically low and by 1977, only four mares remained. To preserve the breed, these mares were crossed with Spanish Mustang stallions. The modern breed name derives from the Lac La Croix First Nation of Ontario, where the horses were last found in the wild. Historically, the breed was also found in Minnesota. Today it remains a critically endangered breed. Characteristics The Lac La Croix pony is a small riding horse standing high. The breed is seen in any solid color except white and cream dilutions. Black and bay are common, as are dun shades with primitive markings. They are hardy, with smooth-flowing gaits, and a reputation for being gentle and intelligent. It is considered the only breed matured by indigenous people in Canada. The breed has a broad forehead tapering to a refined muzzle. They have cold weather adaptations including small, well-haired ears and nostril flaps able to tighten in bad weather. They have low withers, a short, straight back, sloping croup and a low-set tail. Their cannon bones are heavy and strong. Their mane and tail is thick. =Genetics= Lac La Croix ponies were believed to be a landrace cross of Canadian horse and Spanish Colonial horse or Mustang breeding. These original horses declined to the point that only four mares remained, at which time their bloodlines were crossed with Spanish Mustang stallions. Blood- typing studies conducted by Gus Cothran at the University of Kentucky indicate that the ponies have British pony ancestry as well as some Iberian horse markers. They are classified as an indigenous horse breed of Canada, but are at risk of a genetic bottleneck. A 2011 study found they had the second-lowest average effective number of alleles and allelic richness (2.83 and 4.01) among several breeds of pony breeds found in Canada. A 2012 study of matrilineal genetics verified Canadian horse and British pony breed ancestry, with Iberian origins indicated but more difficult to verify on account of modern Spanish Mustang crossbreeding. History A Lac La Croix stallion The Lac La Croix breed developed in the Great Lakes transboundary region of southern Canada and the northern United States. The original pony was a multi-purpose working animal, of particular importance to the Ojibwe people in the winter. The breed was ridden along trap lines, pulled loads of ice and wood, and hauled sleighs. At the end of the winter, people herded some of the ponies over lake ice to an isolated location called \\"Pony Island\\" to keep them safe during foaling and breeding season. There they were allowed to run loose in a semi-feral condition until the following winter. Others freely crossed the border between Ontario and Minnesota. By 1900, the ponies were relatively plentiful, with an estimated population of a few thousand, found in many of the First Nation reserves in the area. The horse population declined during the 20th century for many reasons. In the early 20th century, indigenous people were prohibited by the government from leaving their Reserves without a permit, and so taking away their horses further limited their movement. Lack of transportation also reduced their land base, allowing settlement by whites. Some horses taken away from the Ojibwe people were rendered into glue and horsemeat. When Quetico Provincial Park was created in 1913, many Indigenous people‚Äîand presumably their horses‚Äîwere forcibly removed. Free-roaming horses were particularly at risk, as they did not have caretakers watching over them. Later in the century, mechanization played a role as motor vehicles, including the snowmobile, replaced the horse. The last population in the Unites States, located at the Bois Forte Indian Reservation in Minnesota, was killed off in the 1940s. Missionaries at the reservation decided it was inappropriate for children to witness the sight of semi-feral horses in the act of mating. The last Canadian community to keep their horses was the Lac La Croix First Nation. By the 1960s, when someone accidentally shot a colt who was the last remaining male of breeding age, there were six horses left, including one elderly stallion that was unable to breed. In 1977, the Canadian government claimed the four remaining mares a public nuisance. Before officials could destroy them, the Bois Forte and the Lac La Croix planned a rescue. They loaded the mares into a horse trailer, and Fred Isham, an Ojibwe from Nett Lake, drove them to Minnesota. There they lived in a free-roaming state on a farm, protected from slaughter. Because there were no remaining stallions, a registered Spanish Mustang known as Smokey SMR 169 was bred to the mares. The first male foal, named Keokuk, was born in January 1980. Another colt, Nimkii, was foaled in 1985. These two stallions founded the modern Lac La Croix bloodlines. In the 1990s, the Lac La Croix Indian Pony was categorized as a rare breed; it was listed as \\"endangered\\" by the FAO in 2007, and in 2020 was reported to DAD-IS as \\"at risk\\". It remains on the livestock conservation list of Heritage Livestock Canada. Today, there are about 150 horses located in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Minnesota. In 2012, scientists recommended a conservation strategy be developed for the Eriskay pony and the Lac La Croix, based upon the need to preserve their unique genetics. Uses The modern Lac La Croix Indian Pony is considered a spirit animal by the Ojibwe people and is used in programs promoting indigenous heritage. Other uses include equine-assisted therapy and tourism. In particular, they are used to help indigenous youth remain in touch with their heritage.

The cottages were built on cinder blocks above ground and had above ground piping and received chlorinated water from the lake. The main building still had most bathrooms on the floor, no heat but had well water. The 1957 renovation was needed but not enough. The rooms in the cottages and newer Panorama and Holiday Inn (not the chain motel) buildings had air cooling and heat but were not connected to the main building. The rooms in the main building were small and some had air conditioning and private bath. In 1972 Alvin Atlass decided to leave the hotel business. It was too much risk for Abby Dan to run the hotel alone and in Sept of 1972 the hotel went bankrupt. It was sold at auction Abby Dan tried to help the new owner open for the 1973 season. The hotel did not open and in September 1973 the hotel burned in a suspicious fire. It was noted that the water tower which operated the sprinkler system was drained. The original main building was heated by fireplace, the newer one had no heat. The cottages had no heat and had above ground pipe. Thus, the hotel was only open in the late spring to early fall. The land remains empty today.  Hotel construction  Construction of Catskill hotels in the days before sprinkler systems and modern heating systems consisted of may separate buildings build at a distance. Buildings often burned. In Shawanga's case, the main building burned due to a chimney fire around 1923‚Äì1926. As the resort consisted of many buildings, it was not a total loss.  Main building  The main building, built in 1926 and renovated in 1957 had approximately 123 rooms. Most rooms had a shared bathroom on the floor. The main building had well water and while some rooms had AC, none had heat.  1957 renovation  Construction began after the 1957 season and proceeded during the winter. Previously the hotel catered to singles, after the renovation, the hotel catered to families.  Day camp  The camp was located about 3/4 of a mile away from the main building by the lake. There was a section for the older kids and younger. There was a nursery that was across from the main building.  Summers at Shawanga  There were many guests who spent their entire summer at the hotel, this was common at the Catskills up until the end of the 70's.

Cuddy (born 1939) is a Canadian psychologist recognized for her contributions to the field of music psychology. She is a professor emerita in the Department of Psychology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.  Biography  Cuddy was born in 1939 and grew up in a musical family in Winnipeg, Manitoba. A trained pianist, she completed an undergraduate degree in psychology at United College (now the University of Winnipeg) in 1959, while also earning a diploma in music. She earned a master's degree (1961) and a PhD (1965) in psychology from the University of Toronto, under the supervision of Endel Tulving. In 1965, Cuddy and her husband, Mel Wiebe (a scholar of Victorian literature), left Toronto to accept positions at Queen's University. In 1969, Cuddy established the Music Cognition Lab at Queen's University, the first music psychology laboratory in Canada and one of the first in the world. Her research program has examined a wide range of topics within music psychology, including melodic expectation, absolute pitch, and effects of musical training. A recent line of research explored music processing among individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This work garnered media attention for the finding that patients with memory loss associated with dementia may be able to maintain musical memories. Cuddy served as editor of the journal Music Perception from 2002 to 2017, and as a consulting editor to the journals Musicae Scientiae and Psychomusicology.

He was born in Mansoura. He has written three books: Rogers (2007), Seven Lessons Learned from Ahmed Makky (2009), and The Use of Life (2014). The latter book resulted in his being jailed in 2016 for \\"violating public modesty\\", due to its sexual content and drug references, marking the first time in modern Egypt that an author has been jailed for a work of literature. The book since been translated by Ben Koerber. Naji was also a regular contributor to Al-Akhbar al-Adab and Al-Masry Al-Youm. He served almost 300 days in jail before being released, and later was granted the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award from PEN America. He moved to Washington D.C. with his wife Yasmin Hosam El Din. He is currently serving his fellowship at Black Mountain Institute in Las Vegas, Nevada, with his wife and their infant daughter. Early Life He was born on September 15th, 1985 in Mansoura, Egypt. Growing up, Naji had always been fascinated with mainly comics or books for kids and teenagers. He soon found a passion for writing at a young age of 10 but knew how dangerous the censorship laws could be while living in Egypt. He worked as a journalist in Mansoura sourcing his income and first wrote his book Rogers in 2007. He first ran into legal trouble in 2015, when a chapter of The Use of Life was published in the state-run literary magazine Akhbar al- Adab. Career In his career, Naji has published a total of three books: Rogers (2007), Seven Lessons Learned from Ahmed Makky (2009) and The Use of Life (2014). His work in journalism consists of contributing to many articles as well as numerous blogs. He worked as a journalist for literary magazine, Akhbar Al-Adab, and contributed to numerous magazines and websites including Al-Masry, Al-Youm and Al-Modon. In May 2016, Naji received the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award. His work is viewed as controversial by many and he is concluded to have a more open-minded critical way of thought than many in his society. His work pushed boundaries in conservative Egyptian culture. Prominent Life Events In 2015, Naji ran into legal trouble after a chapter of his novel, The Use of Life, was published in literary magazine Akhbar Al- Adab. In 2016, he was fined through a higher court and imprisoned on the account that his novel The Use of Life violated public modesty by making sexual references along with references to intoxicants, which are viewed as highly taboo in Egypt. After spending 300 days in jail, he was released on December 22, 2016. He is known to be the first Egyptian writer imprisoned on accounts of immorality. In May 2016, PEN recognized him for his adversity by giving him the Pen/Barbey Freedom to Write Award. Political Views Naji has been known for being very critical of trends in Egyptian pop culture since his blogs in the early 2000s. He has been described as ‚Äúiconoclastic‚Äù, meaning that his writings tend to attack beliefs and institutions that are valued by many members of society. While Naji does tend to have writing that is considered to be controversial in Egypt, his writings oftentimes don't mention politics, but instead provoke protests and revolutions. For example, in his book Using Life Naji rarely mentions the politics in Egypt, but instead talks of how the revolution in 2011 didn't cause much political or social change. Personal life Since being convicted of violating public modesty in Egypt, the trial of his case has made his case known around the world and has increased his book sales. The rise in knowledge of his trial also increased his support, causing many to push for his release. After years of being in and out of court, Naji's jail time was replaced by a fine and his travel ban was lifted in July 2018. Since then, Naji has traveled to America to reunite with his wife after a year of not being able to see each other. Since leaving Egypt, Naji has told reporters that he now feels as if he can think freely and reexamine what has happened to him. Although Naji has felt more free in America, there are still many unanswered questions to him such as if he will stay in America, will he write for American or Egyptian audiences, how will he continue as an exiled writer and many more. While he is optimistic about his new life in America, he knows that these questions will need to be answered at some point. While the future is uncertain for Naji and his family, they are remaining positive with his wife saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing more thrilling for me than new beginnings‚Äù. Legacy Naji received most of his praise once his trial was known around the world. In May 2016, PEN America granted Naji with the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award at their annual Literary Gala in New York. Just five months later, PEN America sent a letter to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi containing signatures from over 120 writers demanding Naji to be released from prison immediately. Between these two events, an International day of Reading for Ahmed Naji was started in May to further push the release of Naji. Although Naji was not appreciated by the Egyptian Government, he had the support of many writers both near and far throughout his trial against the government.

Early life and career  Berger was born in Epsom, England in 1970, but moved to Melbourne, Australia with her family just a year later. She earned her undergraduate degree in Veterinary Science from the University of Melbourne. She was awarded her PhD at James Cook University in 2001 under the supervision of Rick Speare. In her PhD she aimed to find the cause of the decline of amphibians in Queensland between the 1970s and 1990s. She identified the cause as being a chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes a disease called chytridiomycosis. She served as the Associate Dean of Research within the College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences at James Cook University. She is currently an adjunct professor at James Cook University and the University of Melbourne.  Discovery of chytridiomycosis  Between the late 1970s and the 1990s a mysterious decline in frog species was observed in Australia. Rick Speare theorised that this was caused by an infectious disease and hired Berger to study this. At the time it was thought that infectious diseases could not cause an extinction. However, in 1998 Berger was able to identify a fungus, called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, in the skin of the frog. This fungus disrupts the skin, making the frogs unable to absorb electrolytes and water, ultimately causing them to die. Her work on this infectious disease has helped to change practices in conservation around the world.

Linsley's work traced the origin and history of the Morgan Horse breed from Justin Morgan's ownership of the foundation sire Figure in the late 1700s to the late 1850s and continues to be regarded as the seminal work on the history of the breed. From 1856 to 1859, Linsley was publisher of the Vermont Stock Journal, a monthly magazine that provided information on breeding and raising farm animals. He later moved the publication to New York City and published it until 1864 as the American Stock Journal. In the 1860s, Linsley continued his railroad career. He was chief engineer for the Vermont and Canada Railroad, and oversaw construction of the tracks from the Lake Champlain docks in Burlington to the railroad depot in Essex Junction. This work included completing the Burlington Tunnel under Burlington's North Avenue, a project that was noteworthy because it required the development and implementation of new techniques for building in loose sand. Contemporary news accounts of the tunnel's construction indicate that the stress associated with the work caused Linsley's hair to turn white prematurely. Additional Linsley projects in Vermont included passenger stations in Burlington and St. Albans, as well as extension of the Central Vermont line from St. Albans to Saint- Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec. Linsley was chief engineer of the Central Vermont from 1860 to 1862, and the Montreal and Vermont Junction Railroad from 1862 to 1865. From 1865 to 1866 he was chief engineer of the Vermont division of the Portland and Ogdensburg Railway, and he was chief engineer of the Lebanon Springs Railroad (upstate New York) from 1866 to 1869. =Career in Burlington= During the American Civil War, Linsley supported the Union and took part in activities including recruiting drives at which he contributed to cash bonuses paid to newly enlisted soldiers. Linsley's other ventures included a farm on which he grew apples and raised animals including cows, trotting horses and pigs. In addition, he operated a contracting business, D. C. Linsley & Company, which undertook projects including providing gas lighting for the town of Windsor, Vermont. A Democrat in an era when Republicans dominated Vermont politics, in 1864, Linsley was the party's unsuccessful nominee for member of the Vermont House of Representatives from Burlington. In 1865, Linsley and his brother George formed a partnership to construct a lumber mill in Burlington, which they operated as Linsley's Mills. The business was later operated by new partners as S. S. Churchill & Co. Linsley was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 1865, and was defeated by Republican Abraham B. Gardner. In 1866, Linsley was again the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, and was again defeated by Gardner. Linsley was active in Burlington's local politics and government despite his party affiliation. He served as city engineer from 1868 to 1869, and a member of the school board from 1869 to 1870. In 1870, Linsley served as Burlington's mayor. He resigned on October 6, 1870 and former mayor Torrey E. Wales served as acting mayor until Linsley's term expired in April 1871. From 1873 to 1875, Linsley was Burlington's superintendent of streets. =Later career= From 1870 to 1873, Linsley was assistant chief engineer of the Northern Pacific Railroad. In this position, he oversaw construction of lines in Minnesota and Dakota Territory. In 1874, Linsley was one of the organizers and promoters of the Burlington and Lamoille Valley Railroad, and he was its president from 1874 to 1875 and chief engineer from 1875 to 1876. He served as the railway's general manager from 1877 to 1881, and was its president again from 1881 to 1888. Linsley oversaw construction of the Canada Atlantic Railway between Ottawa and Lacolle, Canada from 1881 to 1888. From 1886 to 1888, he was the railroad's president. In 1886, Linsley moved to New York City, where he promoted the New York and Boston Rapid Transit Company, a venture which proposed to build a direct rail line between New York City and Boston, Massachusetts. Linsley was the company's chief engineer and conducted the initial surveys to determine a route. The work was still in progress at the time of Linsley's death, but the enterprise proved unsuccessful and the company became defunct. In addition to promoting the Boston to New York City rail line, at the time of his death, Linsley was also working on plans for an elevated railway in New York City. =Death= Linsley died in New York City on October 7, 1889. His funeral was held at St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral in Burlington. He was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington. In addition, his name is included on the monument to Charles Linsley and Sarah Chipman Linsley at Middlebury Cemetery in Middlebury. =Family= In 1858, Linsley married Martha \\"Pattie\\" Hatch of Burlington; her father, Joseph D. Hatch, served as mayor of Burlington from 1876 to 1883. D. C. and Martha Linsley were the parents of two children, Joseph Hatch Linsley, a doctor in New York City, and Fanny, the wife of William M. Brophy. Linsley's relatives included uncle Joel H. Linsley. Joel Linsley was a prominent minister in the Congregational church and the president of Marietta College. =Works by=  References Sources =Books=   =Newspapers=         =Internet=  * External links  Category:1827 births Category:1889 deaths Category:Middlebury College alumni Category:Norwich University alumni Category:19th-century American engineers Category:19th- century American railroad executives Category:19th-century American politicians Category:People from Middlebury, Vermont Category:Mayors of Burlington, Vermont Category:Vermont Democrats Category:Burials at Lakeview Cemetery (Burlington, Vermont) ","title":"Daniel Chipman Linsley"},{"id":"62651192","text":"Events in the year 1996 in the Netherlands.

It is commonly known by the acronym NORD. Formed in 1946, NORD was among the first of its kind in the United States. It won accolades early in its history, being considered progressive by the standards of the mid-twentieth century. As of 2010, the New Orleans Recreation Department Commission provides administrative oversight for NORD. In 2017, NORD was accredited by the National Recreation and Park Association. Although its activities emphasize sports, they are not limited to sports and include activities such as music, theater and dance. History =Founding= The New Orleans City Council created NORD with City Ordinance No. 16,630 on September 27, 1946, going into effect on January 1, 1947. Mayor deLesseps S. Morrison had started to press for its creation from his time campaigning for mayor while still a member of the Louisiana State Legislature. Morrison maintained his interest in the organization through his term of office. By 1949, the juvenile delinquency rate in New Orleans declined by 50%, with NORD receiving some credit for the change. The immediate forerunner of NORD was the New Orleans Juvenile Sports Association which was established during World War II. This association did not manage recreational activities and facilities in a comprehensive way, and administration was inefficiently divided among approximately 16 different government agencies. Morrison's interest in creating NORD began with a pitch by Lester Lautenschlaeger, John Brechtel, G. Gernon Brown, and Morris Jeff. Lautenschlaeger was a noted local athlete and civic leader. Brechtel was an administrator for the New Orleans Juvenile Sports Association. Brown was a prominent local high school football coach; and Jeff was the athletic director at Xavier University of New Orleans, an historically black university. This pitch presentation occurred while Morrison was engaged in his political campaign to become mayor of New Orleans. With Mayor Morrison's sponsorship, the city of New Orleans appropriated $300,000 to create NORD, which was a large sum of money for the time. Morrison appointed Lautenschlaeger as NORD's first director, with Brechtel as assistant director. Lautenschlaeger voluntarily served as director for a salary of $1 per year. Henry Beter served as athletic director for NORD from its inception. Lautenschlaeger, Brechtel, and Beter all had long tenures with NORD and provided forceful administration of the organization. Within 16 months of its inception, NORD constructed 58 new playgrounds and 8 new swimming pools. NORD made use of existing facilities to the extent possible, and so, with the new constructions, had 91 playgrounds, 17 swimming pools, and 8 sports stadiums. At that time, it sponsored 25 baseball leagues. Nearly from the start, its programs included classes and workshops for theater, dance, arts & crafts, and youth day camps. NORD has also provided programs for senior citizens since its earliest days. Under Morrison's city leadership, the city government funded NORD from the city's general funds, while Lautenschlaeger supplemented funding by soliciting private donations. =Olive A. Stallings= Gentilly (photo courtesy of Infrogmation) Public recreation facilities in New Orleans can be traced to the work of civic leader Olive A. Stallings (1866-1940). Following her attendance at a 1906 meeting of the National Recreation Association in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania USA, Stallings became interested in providing publicly available recreation facilities in her hometown of New Orleans. In 1906, Stallings funded and established the Poydras Playground which was the first play center in New Orleans. Stallings served on the New Orleans Playground Commission from 1911 to 1940 and was the commission's first president. She was the founder and first president of the New Orleans Outdoor Art and Improvement Association which was the forerunner of the New Orleans Parkway Commission. Stallings served on the zoning board of the city and was the founder of the first Girl Scouts organization in the New Orleans. By 1938, aided by Stallings's efforts, New Orleans had 18 playgrounds and 6 swimming pools for purposes of general recreation. In 1929, the New Orleans Times- Picayune newspaper presented Stallings with its Loving Cup Award for her efforts on civic improvement, especially children's recreation. NORD has a Stallings Playground, eponymous to her. =Segregation in NORD= The 1947 creation of NORD coincided with the Jim Crow era of the southern United States. For this reason, NORD facilities were racially segregated through its early history. Shortly after inception, NORD provided 19 facilities for the black community and more than 100 for the white community. At that time, the demographics of New Orleans were about 32% African-American, and so NORD was disproportionately supporting the white people of the city. In 1947, at the time that the city of New Orleans created NORD, Mayor Morrison established an advisory commission of African American community leaders as part of NORD's organization. In 1948, NORD opened Shakespeare Park and Julius Rosenwald Center specifically for African-Americans as segregated operations. During the period of segregation, NORD maintained a \\"negro division\\". While NORD disproportionately supported the white population, NORD provided facilities for the African-American population when previously they had none. An example of such a facility was Lincoln Beach. NORD remained racially segregated until after the 1963 Barthe v. City of New Orleans court decision. In 1964, the United States Supreme Court upheld the decision, initiating the desegregation of NORD. Lester Lautenschlaeger was still serving as NORD's director at the time of the Supreme Court decision, and he refused to comply with the court's decision. Then mayor Moon Landrieu removed Lautenschlaeger from the post, thereby clearing the way for racial integration of NORD's programs and facilities. =Period of decline= Samuel Square, a NORD facility that was racially integrated soon after court order City leaders in New Orleans reacted to the requirement by the courts to integrate NORD facilities by closing swimming pools and other NORD facilities. Public funding for NORD also diminished. These events led to the subsequent decline of the quality and quantity of NORD's programs and facilities. Voters in New Orleans rejected a proposal to incorporate Palmer Park in the Carrollton section of New Orleans into NORD, which would have resulted in racial integration of this all-white park. Opponents of the proposal claimed that racial integration of the park would result in declining property values in the neighborhood and accelerate the departure of white people to the suburbs. The opponents of the proposal pointed to the integration of the Samuel Square park as a \\"public disgrace\\", claiming the same would happen to Palmer Park should it become part of NORD. Although this proposal to New Orleans voters failed, Palmer Park subsequently became part of the city's park system in 1977, resulting in decisive racial integration. Members of the black community in New Orleans responded by forming the Target Areas Recreation Committee (TARC), which was established to call attention to the inadequate focus on black children in the city. =Impact of Hurricane Katrina= NORD was already in a state of decline by the time of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Many of NORD's facilities were seriously damaged by the hurricane, remaining in a state of significant disrepair and neglect at least until 2010 when reform movements began. At the time of a 2010 survey of NORD facilities, five years after Hurricane Katrina, seven of NORD's sixteen swimming pools were open, with many of its community centers closed or destroyed. The survey showed that the NORD facilities in the more affluent sections of New Orleans received preferential treatment. NORD facilities on the west bank of the city were undamaged in comparison to those on the east bank. Reconstruction of the NORD facilities after the hurricane was slow. Some New Orleans residents attempted reconstruction with private funds, although city government had not cooperated as of 2010. =Revitalization= Revitalization of NORD began in earnest when Mitch Landrieu became mayor of New Orleans in 2010. In his first State of the City speech, on July 8,2010, Landrieu stated: \\"... when I came into office 67 days ago, I found a recreation department that would make you weep, one that is underfunded and under-prioritized. We found many of NORD's facilities are in shambles ‚Äî swimming pools without filtration systems, no restrooms and no shower facilities.\\" As part of his efforts to reform NORD, Landrieu established the NORD Commission in 2010, to serve as a governing body for NORD. At nearly the same time, Landrieu created the NORD Foundation, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization charged with supplementing the finances of NORD. Governance and organization NORD states its mission as being \\"to advance the physical, mental, and social well-being of New Orleanians by providing safe and welcoming environments for recreational, athletic, and cultural experiences.\\" Day-to-day operations of NORD are the responsibility of its chief executive officer. NORD is directed by the NORD Commission, which is a group of community leaders appointed by the mayor of New Orleans and who serve on the commission without compensation. City funding of NORD is supplemented by the NORD Foundation, and, in this way, NORD operates as a public-private partnership. The government of the State of Louisiana has funded some NORD projects. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided public funding for some projects that were part of NORD's recovery from Hurricane Katrina. Improvements to NORD's Joe W. Brown Park were completed as a result of a public-private partnership between the city of New Orleans, the AllState Sugar Bowl, the Nike Corporation, and the Brees Dream Foundation. Programs and facilities Wesley Barrow Stadium. Its sign shows the NORD logo. Although NORD emphasizes programs for children, it provides programs for people of all ages. As of 2017, NORD operated 15 swimming pools and 12 community centers. In addition to sports, NORD provides music instruction, exercise programs, youth summer camps, art classes, programs for professional development, and homework help for school-age children. Programs include ones for people with special needs. NORD has programs specifically designed to encourage participation of girls and young women in sports. Representative NORD facilities include, among others: * Joe W. Brown Park, including Victory Field * A.L. Davis Park (formerly known as Shakespeare Park) * Rosenwald Recreation Center * Sanchez Multi-Service Center * Stallings Playground * Wesley Barrow Stadium Recognition A 1949 article by Life Magazine reported that Associate Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark referred to NORD as the most progressive municipal recreation program in the United States. In 1967, NORD was named Outstanding Organization by the Allstate Sugar Bowl. With its 2017 accreditation by the National Recreation and Park Association, NORD became part of just 1% of all the recreation departments in the United States which have earned this distinction.

Smith in November 2016, WikiLeaks denies it has been in possession of Clinton's deleted 30,000 emails since February 2016. WikiLeaks also declines to say whether Smith was in contact with the group.  Trump asks White House staff secretary Rob Porter to find out whether Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand would be interested in taking over responsibility for the Mueller investigation and eventually replacing Sessions as Attorney General. Porter ignores Trump's request because he is concerned about the implications of being involved in ending the investigation or firing Mueller. * July 7:  During a two-hour meeting with Trump at the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit, Putin denies interfering in the 2016 US election. Trump conducts a second meeting with Putin some hours later, with no US aides. The second meeting is undisclosed by the White House until July 18, following news reports. Trump takes his translator's notes and orders the translator not to discuss the meeting with other administration officials. Concerns about violations of the Presidential Records Act are later raised.  Hicks and White House communications advisor Josh Raffel learn that The New York Times is working on a story about the Trump Tower meeting. * July 8:  Returning from Germany aboard Air Force One, Trump preemptively dictates a misleading statement on behalf of Trump Jr., claiming that the Veselnitskaya meeting on June 9, 2016 concerned child adoption.  Without permission from Trump, Trump's legal team spokesman Mark Corallo works with Circa News to publish a story about the Trump Tower meeting that casts it as possibly being part of \\"a broader election opposition effort to smear [Trump] by creating the impression he and his family had extensive ties to Russia as the Kremlin was interfering in the 2016 election.\\" * July 9:  The New York Times first reports that Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort met Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016. In response to the report, Goldstone sends Emin Agalarov a text message stating that he kept Emin's father out of the story, and warns that it could blow up. The Circa News story is published an hour later.  Trump and Hicks chastise Corallo for his participation in the Circa News story.  President Trump says he and Putin \\"discussed forming an impenetrable cyber security unit so that election hacking, and many other negative things, will be guarded and safe.\\" Trump later says he does not think this will happen. * July 10  Trump, Hicks, and Corallo have a conference call to discuss the handling of the Veselnitskaya meeting revelations. Corallo says the statement drafted on Air Force One will backfire because the original emails will eventually come out. Hicks responds the emails \\"will never get out.\\" Corallo resigns shortly thereafter, reportedly due to concerns over possible obstruction of justice.  Trump Organization lawyers email Rob Goldstone and two others a prepared statement drafted in Goldstone's name to use as a response to inquires about the Trump Tower meeting. The statement supports Trump Jr.'s account of the meeting. Goldstone responds with his own version of the statement that says he was acting on behalf of Emin Agalarov and that the meeting was about DNC funding from Russia, but never uses either statement.

Trump follows-up with Lewandowski about the June 19 public statement he dictated for Sessions to read. Trump tells Lewandowski to inform Sessions that he will be fired if he doesn't meet with Lewandowski. After the meeting, Lewandowski passes the statement to Dearborn and asks him to deliver it to Sessions. Feeling uncomfortable about being the messenger, Dearborn ignores the request and does not deliver the message.  Trump, in an unscheduled interview with The New York Times, blasts Sessions for recusing himself without telling Trump in advance of his nomination to be Attorney General. Trump then threatens Mueller's job if the investigation expands to his personal finances. He tells the Times that he \\"didn't know about the [Trump Tower] meeting\\" at the time and adds, \\"As I've said‚Äîmost other people, you know, when they call up and say, 'By the way, we have information on your opponent,' I think most politicians‚ÄîI was just with a lot of people, they said, ...

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) says it has never certified Kaspersky Lab's security software, an admission that comes just a week after the Trump administration booted the firm from two of its approved suppliers lists. * July 20:  Bloomberg News reports that Mueller is investigating Trump's business transactions.  The Washington Post reports Trump is asking his attorneys about his ability to pardon himself and other key aides and family members.  Paul Behrends is removed from his position as staff director for a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee chaired by Rohrabacher. The move comes after news reports about Behrends's and Rohrbacher's trip to Moscow in April 2016.  Senator Chuck Grassley sends the Justice Department a letter calling for an investigation into alleged coordination between Chalupa and the Ukrainian government to interfere in the 2016 election. He cites the January 11 Politico report on alleged Ukrainian interference as evidence.  Mueller's team interviews Yates's top deputy Matthew S. Axelrod. * July 21:  The Washington Post reports Sessions discussed Trump campaign-related matters with Kislyak.  The Senate Judiciary Committee requests all communications between Trump Jr. and a group of people, including Jill Stein. She publicly describes the notion that she communicated with Trump Jr. as \\"an obvious smear designed to generate a fake news feeding frenzy\\".  John M. Dowd replaces Marc Kasowitz at the head of Trump's legal team, following personal threats made by Kasowitz. Legal spokesman Mark Corallo resigns. Michael Wolff later reports that Corallo had been instructed not to speak to the press or to answer his telephone, and that he privately stated his belief that the Air Force One meeting on July 8, 2017 represented likely obstruction of justice.  A complaint is filed against Representative Dana Rohrabacher with the Office of Foreign Assets Control alleging violations of Magnitsky Act sanctions. In April 2016, Rohrabacher received a document directly from Russian Deputy Prosecutor Viktor Grin, an individual under sanctions, and used it in attempts to weaken the Magnitsky Act. The allegation is that the work Rohrabacher performed was a \\"service\\" provided to Grin in violation of the sanctions against Grin.  Priebus calls Hunt in the evening to discuss whether Sessions will be fired or resign in the wake of the Washington Post article. Hunt tells him that Sessions has no intentions of resigning. She points out that Trump will still be under investigation without Sessions.  The Senate Intelligence Committee interviews Susan Rice. * July 22:  Trump asserts \\"complete power\\" to pardon anyone in relation to the Russia investigation.  Trump orders Priebus to tell Sessions that he has \\"no choice\\" and \\"must immediately resign.\\" Priebus then calls McGahn for advice. McGahn tells him to ignore Trump's order, and the two discuss the possibility of resigning instead of carrying out Trump's order to fire Sessions. When Trump follows-up with Priebus in the afternoon, Priebus tells him he will get Sessions to resign. Trump follows-up again.

Mueller announces that Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to making false testimony to the FBI. According to unsealed court documents, Papadopoulos met a Kremlin-linked professor, later identified by The Daily Telegraph as Joseph Mifsud of the University of Stirling's politics department. Mifsud told Papadopoulos that Moscow had damaging information on Clinton in the form of ‚Äúthousands of emails‚Äù.  A lawyer for Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis states that Clovis was \\"being polite\\", following reports that he encouraged Papadopoulos to meet with Russian officials.  New disclosures provided to Congress by digital social media companies indicate that during the campaign Russian agents placed 1,000 videos on YouTube, 131,000 messages on Twitter, and, via 170 accounts,120,000 posts on Instagram. 80,000 Russia-linked posts on Facebook were viewed by up to 126 million people.  Mifsud tells The Daily Beast that he isn't the professor mentioned in Papadopoulos's statement of the facts, and that he doesn't know anyone in the Russian government. * October 31:  Trump calls Papadopoulos a \\"low-level\\" advisor and a \\"liar\\".  The Kremlin dismisses as ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù and ‚Äúludicrous‚Äù the notion that charges leveled by Mueller against three former Trump campaign officials constitute possible meddling by Russia in U.S. political affairs.  The Ukrainian government says it warned Facebook and U.S. officials years ago that Russia was conducting disinformation campaigns on its platform.  Politico reports that Sam Clovis, President Trump‚Äôs nominee to be the Agriculture Department‚Äôs chief scientist, has been ‚Äúa fully cooperative witness‚Äù in the Senate Intelligence Committee‚Äôs investigation of Russian interference.

Facebook reports to Congress that the Russians succeeded in organizing a \\"Miners for Trump\\" rally. = November = * November:  Mueller's prosecutors interview Kushner.  The private equity firm Apollo Global Management gives Jared Kushner a $185 million loan. The loan is considered suspicious because Apollo's founder, Joshua Harris, met several times with Kushner at the White House to discuss, among other things, a possible job in the administration. Also, the largest investor in Apollo's real estate trust, the Apollo-controlled entity that made the loan, is the Qatari government's Qatar Investment Authority.

BuzzFeed subpoenas the DNC for information related to the DNC hack as part of its efforts to defend itself against an ongoing libel suit connected to its publication of the Steele dossier.  Ross says there is ‚Äúnothing whatsoever improper‚Äù about the relationship between an international shipping company he holds significant investments in and a Russian energy company whose owners include a Putin family member and an oligarch, Gennady Timchenko, subject to U.S. sanctions.

Butina declines a request to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee because of lack of support from Republican members. * Early December: Trump becomes furious about news reports that Mueller has issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank for records related to Trump, telling advisers he wants Mueller's investigation shut down. Trump backs off after Mueller's office tells his lawyers the reports are erroneous. Flynn statement of offense * December 1:  Flynn pleads guilty in federal court to giving false testimony to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak. As part of Flynn‚Äôs negotiations, his son, Michael G. Flynn, is not expected to be charged. In the statement of the offense, K.T. McFarland is identified as \\"PTT official\\", and Sergey Kislyak as \\"Russian Ambassador\\".  Bloomberg reporter Eli Lake speculates in an opinion piece that Kushner is the person mentioned in Flynn's plea documents who is said to have ordered Flynn to contact Russia.  ABC News reports Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians, in the context of plans to defeat ISIS.  ABC News suspends news correspondent Brian Ross for 4 weeks for wrongly reporting that it was candidate Trump rather than President-elect Trump who had directed Flynn to contact the Russian government.  Trump's lawyer Ty Cobb says that Flynn's plea \\"clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion\\" to the Russia investigation. * December 2:  The New York Times reports that even as the White House portrayed Flynn as a renegade who had acted independently in his discussions with a Russian official, emails among top transition officials provided or described suggest otherwise.  Trump admits to knowing that Flynn lied to the FBI in his tweet: ‚ÄúI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.\\" * December 3:  Feinstein says on Meet the Press that her group is \\"putting together of a case of obstruction of justice\\" against Trump.  Trump's personal lawyer, John M. Dowd, says that he wrote the December 2 tweet on the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account about Flynn's firing. Dowd also says Trump knew in January 2017 that Flynn had likely lied to the FBI.  Trump calls the FBI a biased institution whose reputation for fairness is ‚Äúin tatters‚Äù. * December 4:  Trump says he ‚Äúfeels badly‚Äù for Flynn, and claims that Clinton ‚Äúlied many times‚Äù to the agency without consequences.  An email sent during the transition by Trump‚Äôs former deputy national security adviser, K. T. McFarland, appears to contradict the testimony she gave to Congress over the summer. The email shows McFarland knew about Flynn's December 29, 2016, call with Kislyak, while her written testimony says she had no knowledge of it at the time.  Prosecutors say that Manafort worked on an op-ed with Ukrainian journalist Oleg Voloshyn, an associate with ties to Russian intelligence, while out on bail; a court filing requests that the judge revoke Manafort's bond agreement.  Mueller's team interviews Denman for a second and final time.  The Senate Intelligence Committee interviews Denman. * December 5:  Reports indicate that Mueller has subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for data on accounts held by Trump and his family, prompting denials by Trump's lawyers Jay Sekulow and John Dowd. Subsequent reports on December 6 indicate that only information on Trump's associates has been subpoenaed.  Cambridge Analytica's Alexander Nix and Trump's longtime assistant Rhona Graff are scheduled to be interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee about the connections between Trump and the Kremlin.  Democrats place a hold on McFarland's nomination as ambassador to Singapore until she answers their questions about her knowledge of communications between Flynn and Kislyak.  Deripaska and the Associated Press (AP) agree to drop their appeals of rulings in Deripaska's libel suit against the AP. In October, Judge Ellen Huvelle dismissed the suit and denied the AP's request to recover attorney's fees. * December 6:  An unnamed \\"whistleblower\\" claims that Flynn told a former business associate that economic sanctions against Russia would be ‚Äúripped up‚Äù as one of the Trump administration‚Äôs first acts.  Trump Jr. testifies to the House Intelligence Committee in private. He refuses to answer questions about conversations with his father, based on attorney-client privilege. Trump Jr. says he communicated with Hicks, not his father, about the response to his Veselnitskaya meeting.  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie says he was ousted as head of Trump‚Äôs transition team due in part to his opposition to hiring Flynn as National Security Adviser.  Rosenstein confirms that he is satisfied thus far with Mueller's work.  The U.S. House of Representatives dismisses Al Green's resolution to impeach Trump, with 58 members requesting a vote and 364 refusing it.  Trump again urges Sessions to unrecuse himself and investigate Clinton. Sessions responds that he will operate under the law. * December 7:  Mueller's team interviews White House Communications Director Hope Hicks over two days. She is interviewed again on March 13, 2018.  During testimony to Congress, Director Christopher A. Wray defends the FBI from Trump's criticism of December 3.  The House Ethics Committee clears Nunes of misconduct in relation to the matter of his proximity to the White House and accusations that he inappropriately disclosed classified information. It is unclear how thorough the ethics investigation was since the Ethics Committee relied upon outside intelligence experts to review the material instead of comparing the material to Nunes's public statements themselves. * December 8:  Representative Matt Gaetz discusses Mueller's investigation with Trump aboard Air Force One en route to Florida. Representative Ron DeSantis is also aboard.  The Senate Intelligence Committee interviews former FBI Cyber Division assistant director Jim Trainor. * December 12:  Trump's lawyers call for an investigation into the FBI's and the DoJ's alleged conflicts of interest associated with the work of Fusion GPS on the Steele dossier.

Mueller's team interviews McGahn for the second of six times. * December 13:  At a House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rosenstein states that he has seen no cause to dismiss Mueller, and confirms that Mueller is working within the boundaries of his brief.

Trump Jr. meets with the US Senate Intelligence Committee.  Mueller's team interviews Akhmetshin associate Ed Lieberman. * December 14:  The Wall Street Journal reports on the interview of Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix by the House Intelligence Committee, stating that Mueller requested documents from the firm before or during October 2017. In undercover videos released by the British Channel 4 in March, Nix described his testimony. According to Nix, the Republicans on the committee asked only three questions and that portion of the interview lasted only five minutes, while the Democrats asked questions for two hours. This description of the nature of the testimony was confirmed by Adam Schiff, who said \\"my (Republican) colleagues had a habit of asking three questions: Did you conspire, did you collude, did you coordinate with Russians? And if the answer was no, they were pretty much done\\". Schiff also said the Republicans rejected requests that Nix be brought back before the committee.  At his annual news conference, Putin describes allegations of election interference as invented by Trump's political opponents, and states that contacts between Trump's associates and Russian officials before the election were appropriate.  The Washington Post reports in detail on Trump's associates' efforts to avoid the subject of Russia, to preclude Trump's \\"rages\\".

Mueller's team interviews Sater for the second of two times. * December 16:  Kory Langhofer, a lawyer for Trump for America, sends Congress a letter alleging that Mueller's acquisition, via the GSA, of tens of thousands of emails sent and received by 13 senior Trump transition team members is unlawful. The communications derive from the official Presidential Transition Team domain, ptt.gov.  Trump escalates his criticism of the FBI over its Russia investigation, saying, \\"It's a shame what's happened with the FBI ... It's a very sad thing to watch.\\" * December 17:  Responding to Langhofer's accusation of December 16, GSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt states that Trump's transition team was explicitly advised that all material passing through government equipment would be subject to monitoring and would not be held back from law enforcement officers.  Mueller's spokesman Peter Carr rejects Langhofer's claims, stating that the Trump transition emails were acquired appropriately through the criminal investigation process.  White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short states there has been \\"no conversation\\" in the White House concerning any potential dismissal of Mueller. Trump shortly thereafter confirms that he is not considering dismissing Mueller. * December 18:  NBC News reports that the FBI warned Trump after his nomination at the 2016 RNC on July 19, 2016, that foreign adversaries, including Russia, would probably try to spy on and infiltrate his campaign.

Foreign Policy reports that records submitted to Mueller's team indicate that McGahn researched federal law related both to the Logan Act and making false statements to investigators in the early days of Trump's presidency and that he may have warned Trump that Flynn was in potential violation.  Reports emerge that a group headed by Nunes has spent several weeks compiling a report on alleged \\"corruption and conspiracy in the upper ranks of federal law enforcement\\".  In private testimony before the House Intelligence Committee this week, McCabe tells lawmakers that Comey informed him of conversations he had with Trump soon after they happened.  Felix Sater is interviewed in New York by Congressional staff.  The Senate Intlleligence Committee interviews Veterans for Trump national director Matt Miller. * December 22:  The New York Times reports that federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York have sought records from Deutsche Bank about entities associated with Kushner's family businesses.

Robbins says he declined Ryan's request for help. * December 24: The Guardian reports that the FBI has asked the Central Bank of Cyprus for financial information about the defunct FBME Bank, which was used by wealthy Russians with political connections and has been accused by the US government of money laundering.

From the beginning the statue was planned to be placed at Friends Arena in Stockholm, but was finally unveiled at the football stadium in Malm√∂ where Ibrahimoviƒá grew up. After several cases of vandalism it was removed from its plinth on 5 January 2020. Unveiling In the afternoon on 8 October 2019, the statue of Zlatan was unveiled at the football stadium in Malm√∂ in front of thousands of fans and Ibrahimoviƒá attending the ceremony. The statue is to serve as a reminder of where Ibrahimoviƒá's career started. The statue The statue of Zlatan is three metres high and depicts Ibrahimoviƒá standing with open arms. His eyes are focused and he is bare chested and wearing shorts as he steps over the world globe with determined steps. The bronze statue weighs 500 kilograms, and is placed on an eight tonne frame in red granite. Malm√∂ City municipality stated that the cost of the statue was 500,000 Swedish kronor and with an annual maintenance cost of 15,000 kronor, costs that Malm√∂ City will pay. On the ground and right under the statue there are inscriptions into granite based tiles with the clubs Ibrahimoviƒá has played for, and the many titles in football that he has won. Vandalism In November 2019, the statue was vandalized when white paint was sprayed on it. It was also burned with bengal fires and with threats and hateful messages written on the statue. The vandalism was done after it was revealed that Zlatan had become part-owner of the football club Hammarby IF, and had stated that he wanted to make Hammarby into the best football club in Scandinavia. In December 2019, the statue was vandalized again when the statue's leg was sawn off. The statue was sprayed with silver paint during the night of 22 December 2019, and its nose was sawn off and completely removed. A toe on the left foot was also removed. In the early morning of 5 January 2020, the statue was toppled, and later that day removed for repair. An art expert commented a few days earlier that it might be preserved for the future by keeping it indoors.

His tweet is before his statements on the matter to the press.  Trump tells Jim DeFede on CBS4 News in Miami, \\"I have nothing to do with Russia. Nothing to do. I never met Putin.

In September 2017, The Washington Post reports that investigators believe Kilimnik and Manafort used the term \\"black caviar\\" in communications as a reference to expected payments from former clients. In December 2018, TIME magazine reveals that the names \\"Victor\\" and \\"V.\\" mentioned in the emails between Kilimnik and Manafort refer to Deripaska aide and former Russian intelligence officer Commander Viktor A. Boyarkin. In 2018, Manafort tells Mueller's team that \\"the guy\\" was Yanukovych, who gave him a $30,000‚Äì$40,000 jar of caviar in 2010 to celebrate being elected President of Ukraine.

Manafort gives Kilimnik polling data and a briefing on campaign strategy, and, according to Gates, discusses the \\"battleground\\" states Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Manafort asks Kilimnik to pass the data to pro-Russian Ukrainians Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov, and to Oleg Deripaska. Kilimnik gives Manafort a message from Yanukovych about a peace plan for Ukraine that is an opportunity for Russian control of the region. The plan would require Trump's support and Manafort's influence in Europe. The two discuss Manafort's financial disputes with Deripaska and the Opposition Bloc in Ukraine.

DHS Secretary Johnson issues a public statement about cybersecurity and election systems that acknowledges \\"cyber intrusions involving political institutions and personal communications\\" and \\"some efforts at cyber intrusions of voter registration data maintained in state election systems.\\" * September 18‚Äì19: Stone asks Credico to ask Assange for State Department or Clinton emails from August 10‚Äì30, 2011. Credico passes the request to Kunstler, who tells Mueller's investigators in 2018 that she did not pass it on to Assange. * September 19: Crossfire Hurricane investigators obtain Steele dossier. * September 20:  Flynn meets with Rohrabacher. On November 10, 2017, the Mueller investigation is reported to have asked questions about this meeting.  GRU hackers compromise a DNC account on a cloud-computing service and begin copying 300 GB of data off of the servers.  While browsing a political chatroom, Jason Fishbein comes across the password to a non-public website (\`PutinTrump.org\`) focusing on Trump's ties to Russia that is nearing launch. He sends the password and website to WikiLeaks in a Twitter direct message. WikiLeaks tweets about the website and password. * September 20‚Äì26: BlackMattersUS, an IRA website, recruits activists to participate in protests over the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina.

WikiLeaks sends a Twitter direct message to Trump Jr. about the password to \`PutinTrump.org\`. Several hours later, Trump Jr. emails senior campaign staff about the WikiLeaks direct message and website, including Conway, Bannon, Kushner, David Bossie, and Brad Parscale. After the public launch of \`PutinTrump.org\`, Trump Jr. sends a Twitter direct message to WikiLeaks, \\"Off the record, l don't know who that is but I'll ask around. Thanks.\\" This is believed to be the first direct communication between Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks. * September 22:  Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff issue a statement warning that Russia is trying to undermine the election. Their warning is based on what they learned from intelligence briefings as members of the Gang of Eight. It is the first and only public statement prior to the December 29 Joint Analysis Report attributing cyber activity to Russian actors and election influence efforts to Russian intelligence services.  The IRA buys ads on Facebook for \\"Miners for Trump\\" rallies in Pennsylvania.  DCLeaks sends an encrypted file to WikiLeaks and, separately, a tweet with a string of characters. The Mueller Report suspects that this was a transfer of stolen documents, but does not rule out that Andrew \\"Andy\\" M√ºller-Maguhn or another intermediary may have hand-delivered the documents. In 2018, M√ºller-Maguhn, a known hacker and frequent visitor to Assange, denies transporting material to him. * September 23:  Yahoo News reports that U.S. intelligence officials are investigating whether Page has set up private communications between the Trump campaign and senior Russian officials, including talks on possibly lifting sanctions if Trump is elected. The report leads to an email discussion between J. Miller, Bannon, and Stephen Miller about removing Page from the campaign.  The \\"A record\\" of the Trump Organization's \`mail1.trump- email.com\` domain is deleted.  On or around this date, Cendyn Hospitality Marketing, the Trump Organization's email marketing firm, transfers ownership of the \`trump-email.com\` domain name to the Trump Organization after the Organization receives press inquiries about the domain name and Alfa-Bank. * September 24: Page is formally removed from the Trump campaign. Publicly, the campaign denies all knowledge of Page. * September 25:  Hicks emails Conway and Bannon instructing them to answer inquiries about Page with \\"[h]e was an informal advisor in March. Since then he has had no role or official contact with the campaign. We have no knowledge of activities past or present and he now officially has been removed from all lists etc.\\"  When asked by CNN about allegations linking Page to Russia, Conway denies that Page is part of the Trump campaign.  Page sends Comey a letter asking that the FBI drop the reported investigation into his activities in Russia. He denies meeting with sanctioned Russian officials.  FBI informant Stefan Halper asks Trump advisor George Papadopoulos if he is aware of any efforts by Russians to interfere with the 2016 election; Papadopoulos twice denies it. * September 26: Page tells Josh Rogin in an interview for The Washington Post that he is taking a leave of absence from the Trump campaign. He denies meeting with sanctioned individuals in Moscow. * September 27: Ten minutes after Alfa-Bank servers made a last failed attempt to contact to Trump Organization's \`mail1.trump-email.com\` domain (which had its \\"A record\\" deleted September 23), one of the Alfa-Bank servers looks up the new domain name \`trump1.contact-client.com\`, which was routed to the same Trump server. The new domain does not appear to have been previously active and the PTR record did not include the new, alternate name. According to \\"Max\\"'s data, the Alfa- Bank server only looked up the new domain once. Spectrum Health never succeeded in relocating the Trump server through the new route. * September 28:  Russian-American Simon Kukes donates $99,000 to the Trump Victory Committee, which distributes donations between Trump, the RNC, and state Republican parties. His 2016 political donations become a subject of the Mueller investigation.  The House and Senate leaders send a letter to the National Association of State Election Directors highlighting the \\"challenge of malefactors that are seeking to use cyberattacks to disrupt the administration of our elections\\" and urging the states to use DHS services but without any mention of Russia. The letter makes clear that DHS assistance would be free of federal interference in state and local officials running the elections. * September 29:  Comey testifies before the House Judiciary Committee, confirming that federal investigators have detected suspicious activities in voter registration databases, as stated in the August 18 alert.  Butina meets Gordon at a party at the Swiss ambassador's residence. Gordon was the Director of National Security for the Trump campaign from February to August. That night, Paul Erickson emails Butina and Gordon offering to \\"add an electronic bridge\\" to their meeting at the party. In his email to Butina, Erickson writes that Gordon is \\"playing a crucial role in the Trump transition effort and would be an excellent addition to any of the U.S./Russia friendship dinners to occasionally hold.\\" He writes that all the \\"right\\" people listen to Gordon on international security. Erickson's email to Gordon describes Butina as a \\"special friend\\" of the NRA and the special assistant to the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia. * September 30:  Ksenia Baygarova interviews Papadopoulos for Interfax on Trump's foreign policy positions in relation to Russia. The interview was approved by Trump campaign deputy communications director Bryan Lanza. Baygarova later tells The Washington Post that she had been tasked to interview a representative from each campaign. She says Papadopoulos was the only person from the Trump campaign to respond. She describes him as not very experienced. Adverse publicity generated by the interview leads to Papadopoulos being fired from the campaign in October.  The FBI hosts a conference call with Florida elections officials and VR Systems, among others, in which they warn that Russian hackers are targeting election infrastructure. The FBI shares a list of suspicious IP addresses to watch out for. * Late September: Lichtblau and his lawyer meet a roomful of officials at FBI HQ, and are told the officials are looking into potential Russian interference in the election. FBI officials ask Lichtblau to delay publishing his story. = October 2016 = * October: The FBI Counterintelligence Division tasks a contractor with identifying Russian influence activity on Twitter. * Early October: A team of FBI agents travel to Europe to speak with Steele about his dossier. On or about the same date, Steele gives the FBI a dossier of allegations compiled by Cody Shearer, which corresponded \\"with what he had separately heard from his own independent sources.\\" It includes the unverified allegation that Trump was sexually compromised by the Russian secret service at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013. * October 1:  Credico texts Stone that there will be \\"big news on Wednesday,\\" and \\"Hillary's campaign will die this week.\\"  Stone tweets that something damaging to Clinton will happen soon.  DHS Secretary Johnson issues a public statement advising states to seek DHS assistance with election security, and notes that 21 states have requested help. * October 2:  \\"Miners for Trump\\" rallies are held across Pennsylvania. The IRA uses the same techniques to organize the rallies as they used for the \\"Florida Goes Trump\\" rallies, including hiring a person to wear a Clinton mask and a prison uniform.  Stone tells Jones on InfoWars, \\"I'm assured the motherlode is coming Wednesday...I have reason to believe that it is devastating.\\" Includes relevant video clip of InfoWars interview.  After a scheduled WikiLeaks press conference is postponed, Credico tells Stone the delay is a \\"head fake.\\" * October 3:  Stone asks Credico if Assange \\"back[ed] off.\\" Credico responds that he \\"think[s] its on for tomorrow,\\" and adds that \\"Hillary and her people\\" are trying to stop Assange.  Stone tweets that Assange will release something soon.  WikiLeaks sends a Twitter direct message to Trump Jr. asking him to help \\"push\\" a WikiLeaks tweet from earlier in the day (\\"Hillary Clinton on Assange 'Can't we just drone this guy?[']\\") that includes a link to \`truepundit.com\`. Trump Jr. responds, \\"Already did that earlier today. It‚Äôs amazing what she can get away with. What‚Äôs behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?\\"  Stone emails Prince that \\"[t]he payload is still coming.\\" * October 4:  Assange announces the pending release of a million documents about the U.S. presidential election. He denies any specific intent to harm Clinton.  Bannon asks Stone if Assange cut a deal with the Clintons. Stone replies that Assange is affraid, but will make weekly releases. * October 5:  (Wednesday) Stone tweets that a payload from Assange is coming.  Trump Jr. retweets a WikiLeaks tweet announcing an \\"860Mb [sic]\\" archive of various Clinton campaign documents from \\"Guccifer 2.0\\". * October 6:  Stone tweets, \\"Julian Assange will deliver a devastating expose on Hillary at a time of his choosing. I stand by my prediction.\\"  The IRA posts nearly 18,000 Twitter messages at a rate of approximately 12 per minute. * October 7:  Before the DHS and IDNI joint statement release, Rice summons Kislyak to her office and delivers a verbal warning for Russia not to interfere in the election. She gives Kislyak a more detailed written warning for Putin that includes potential consequences that would \\"powerfully impact\\" Russia's economy.  At 12:40 PM EDT, The DHS and the ODNI issue a joint statement accusing the Russian government of breaking into the computer systems of several political organizations and releasing the obtained material via DCLeaks, WikiLeaks, and \\"Guccifer 2.0\\", with the intent \\"to interfere with the U.S. election process.\\"  Corsi holds a conference call with members of WorldNetDaily in which he warns them of the imminent release of the Access Hollywood tape and tells them \\"to reach Assange immediately\\". In November 2018 he tells Mueller's team that he thought Malloch was on the call and assumed Malloch had successfully contacted Assange because of the subsequent Podesta emails release later in the day. Travel records show Malloch was on a trans-Atlantic flight at the time. The Mueller Report says Corsi's sometimes conflicting statements about the call's contents have not been corroborated.  At 4:03 PM EDT, The Washington Post publishes a raw video tape from the television show Access Hollywood of Trump bragging about grabbing women by their genitals. While the tape is not relevant to the Russian interference in the election, the distraction of its release lessens the public impact of the joint intelligence report released hours earlier and may have triggered WikiLeaks' Podesta emails release 30 minutes later.  Around 4:30 PM EDT, WikiLeaks begins publishing thousands of Podesta emails, revealing excerpts from Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street.\\"18 revelations from Wikileaks' hacked Clinton emails\\". BBC News. October 27, 2016. Trump Jr. retweets WikiLeaks' and others' announcements about the release. * October 8: Kushner's company receives $370 million in new loans, including $285 million from Deutsche Bank, to refinance his portion of the former New York Times building.

The dinner event is sponsored by the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs, a group founded by Fabien Baussart and his business partner. Baussart is openly linked to Russian government officials. Randa Kassis, one of the hosts, travels to Moscow after the election and reports the details of the event to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov.  Podesta says he thinks the Trump campaign had advance notice of WikiLeaks's release of his emails. * October 12: WikiLeaks writes to Trump Jr., \\"Hey Donald, great to see you and your dad talking about our publications\\" and \\"Strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us wlsearch.tk.\\" Fifteen minutes later, Donald Trump tweets, \\"Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!\\" * October 13: WikiLeaks again denies communicating with Stone. Later that day, Stone and WikiLeaks communicate by private Twitter message. * October 14:  Trump Jr. tweets about \`wlsearch.tk\` as requested by WikiLeaks on October 12.

The FBI and DHS send a second \\"flash report\\" and a Joint Analysis Report warning about election systems being targeted. The reports contain a list of suspicious IP addresses but do not mention that they are associated with a state actor, so many state IT directors do not understand the urgency of the reports and do not pass them on to their election officials.  Around this date, Kislyak informs Rice of Putin's response to the warning she gave him on October 7. In a 2017 interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee, she characterizes the response as \\"denial and obfuscation\\" and says that Putin specifically mentioned that Russia remains a nuclear power. * October 15:  The Democratic Coalition Against Trump files a complaint with the FBI against Stone for colluding with Russia. They ask the FBI to look into connections between Stone, the Trump campaign, and the hacking of Podesta's emails.  The National Security Division of the Justice Department acquires a FISA warrant to monitor the communications of two Russian banks as part of an investigation into whether they illegally transferred money to the Trump campaign.

Ecuador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs releases a public statement announcing that it \\"exercised its right\\" to \\"temporarily restrict access to some of [WikiLeaks'] private communications network within its Embassy in the United Kingdom\\" and that the government of Ecuador \\"does not interfere in external electoral processes, nor does it favor any particular candidate\\". * October 19:Senator Harry Reid Letter to FBI Director James B. Comey  The FBI and the US Department of Justice (DoJ) apply for a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page. In its approval, the FISA Court finds there is probable cause to believe Page is a Russian agent.  During the third presidential debate, Clinton blames Russia for the DNC email leaks and accuses Trump of being a \\"puppet\\" of Putin. Trump denies ever having met Putin and any connection to him. Banks, Wigmore, and Farage are in attendance.  A Financial Times probe finds evidence a Trump venture has links to an alleged money laundering network.  Stone denies having advance knowledge of WikiLeaks' release of Podesta's emails.  The IRA runs its most popular ad on Facebook. The ad is for the IRA's Back the Badge Facebook group and shows a badge with the words \\"Back the Badge\\" in front of police lights under the caption \\"Community of people who support our brave Police Officers.\\"  Hours after a heated argument between Assange and Ecuadorian Ambassador Carlos Abad Ortiz the night before, two Wikileaks personnel remove computer equipment and \\"about 100 hard drives\\" from the embassy. * October 21: WikiLeaks sends Trump Jr. private tweets suggesting that the campaign give them Trump's tax returns to publish so that they seem less of a \\"'pro-Trump' 'pro-Russia'\\" source.

I'll give you a written statement.\\"  After Smith sends another email update about WikiLeaks, Charles Johnson responds that Bannon expects Smith to hand over all 30,000 Clinton emails or face legal action. In 2020, the Senate Intelligence Committee finds that there is no evidence Smith received any non-public documents from WikiLeaks. * October 27: At the Valdai Discussion Club yearly forum, Putin denounces American \\"hysteria\\" over accusations of Russian interference, saying \\"Does anyone seriously think that Russia can influence the choice of the American people?\\" * October 28:  The FBI reopens its Hillary Clinton email investigation after a monthlong delay during which it focused on investigating the Trump campaign's connections to Russia, according to the report of the Justice Department's inspector general. A key influence on the decision was a probably fake Russian intelligence document discussing a purported email from Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to Clinton campaign staffer Amanda Renteria in which she promises to go easy on Clinton. Nine days after announcing he was reopening the probe, Comey said the FBI found nothing to change its July decision against bringing charges.  Peter W. Smith sends an email to an undisclosed list of recipients in which he writes that there is a \\"tug-of-war going on within WikiLeaks over its planned releases in the next few days\\" and that WikiLeaks \\"has maintained that it will save its best revelations for last, under the theory this allows little time for response prior to the U.S. election November 8.\\" An attachment to the email says that WikiLeaks will release \\"All 33k deleted Emails\\" by November 1. Further unredacted text restored by the Department of Justice and released on June 19, 2020 in response to a court order. * October 29: Trump loans $10 million to his campaign It is his largest single contribution to his campaign, and the campaign never reimburses him for the loan. Starting in 2017, Mueller's team and, later, federal prosecutors investigate whether the funds came from a state-owned Egyptian bank, finally dropping the case in Summer 2020 without reaching a conclusion. * October 30:  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid sends FBI Director James Comey a letter asking him to reveal Trump's ties to the Russian Federation.

In May 2018 Rtskhiladze tells Mueller's team that he was told the tapes were fake but did not relay that information to Cohen. * October 31:  Through the \\"red phone\\", Obama tells Putin to stop interfering or face consequences.  Mother Jones magazine's David Corn reports that a veteran spy, later publicly identified as Steele, gave the FBI information alleging a Russian operation to cultivate Trump, later known as the \\"Steele dossier\\".  Slate publishes an article by Franklin Foer alleging that a Trump server was in suspicious contact with Alfa-Bank in Russia. Snopes examined the story and rated it \\"Unproven\\". Several cyber security experts saw nothing nefarious, while the FBI was still investigating the matter: \\"One U.S. official said investigators find the server relationship 'odd' and are not ignoring it. But the official said there is still more work for the FBI to do. Investigators have not yet determined whether a connection would be significant.\\" The New York Times publishes an article by Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers with a headline that seems to exonerate the Trump campaign, but withholds some information.  The GRU targets over 120 Florida election officials' email accounts with spearphishing attacks. They receive emails purportedly from VR Systems, the state's voter registration and election results service provider, asking them to open a purported Word document containing a trojan. At least some of the emails from \`vrelections@gmail.com\`, which VR Systems doesn't use, contain British spellings. Many of the emails are flagged by spam filters. Elections officials in Washington County and another county open the attachments and infect their systems. Later, the FBI believes one county government's network was compromised in a way that would have given security hackers the ability to alter voter registration data, but this is disputed by state election officials. = November 2016 = * November‚ÄìDecember: Michael Flynn serves as an advisor to SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. was broken shortly after the election. * November:  Mangiante quits the London Centre of International Law Practice after complaining to Mifsud about not being paid her salary.

In September 2018, Manafort pleads guilty to lying to the Justice Department about the extent of his work for Ukraine. * November 1:  Florida elections officials receive an email from VR's chief operating officer warning them about the malicious emails sent the day before. The company notifies the FBI of the spearphishing attack, but does not tell customers or the FBI about the attempted August attack.  Twitter accounts belonging to the GRU persona \\"Anonymous Poland\\" post a forged letter on Bradley Foundation stationary showing that the conservative foundation purportedly donated $150 million to the Clinton campaign, which would be illegal if true. * November 2: The IRA Twitter account @TEN_GOP alleges \\"#VoterFraud by counting tens of thousands of ineligible mail in Hillary votes being reported in Broward County, Florida.\\" Trump Jr. retweets it. * November 3: The IRA Instagram account \\"Blacktivist\\" suggests people vote for Stein instead of Clinton. * November 4:  Mother Jones reports that an October security sweep of the DNC offices in Washington, D.C., discovered a signal that may have belonged to a device outside the office that could intercept cell phone calls. The DNC says details of the security sweep were passed on to the FBI and \\"another agency with three letters,\\" but no device was ever found.  Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland rejects a formal request from the Russian Embassy to observe U.S. elections because Russia refused an invitation to pariticipate in the official OSCE observer mission. * November 5:  Konstantin Sidorkov again emails Trump Jr. and Trump campaign social media director Dan Scavino. He again offers to promote Trump to VK's 100 million users. His previous email was sent on January 19, 2016.  Anti- Clinton \\"Texit\\" rallies are held across Texas. The IRA's \\"Heart of Texas\\" Facebook group organizes the rallies around the theme of Texas seceding from the United States if Clinton is elected.

Small rallies are held in Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, and other cities. No one attends the Lubbock rally.  Manafort emails Kushner a warning that if Clinton loses, her campaign will respond to the loss by claiming voter fraud, cyber-fraud, and Russian hacking of voting machines contributed to Trump's victory. * November 8:  Trump is elected President of the United States.

Based in New York City, she is best known for chamber operas about women who find themselves in situations where they are forced to confront patriarchal structures. Sankaram is also known for incorporating the latest technologies (e.g., virtual reality) and discussing the social effects of technology in musical theater works.  Life  The daughter of an Indian father and a white American mother, Sankaram was born in Orange County, California, and grew up largely in Ramona, a small town in San Diego County. She took some piano lessons as a child, but her interest soon turned to theater. She said, ‚ÄúI was in a theater show called Choice in Southern California. I would do these big dance and song numbers and that‚Äôs what got me even more interested in it.

Her 2013 dissertation examines how interactivity affects the way people process information on the Internet. She concludes, ‚ÄúReading on the Internet may also have the potential to create a more positive effect on reading in the form of deeper information processing. In particular, reading may be enhanced by the presence of some form of interactive, two-way communication, such as a comments section.‚ÄùKamala Sankaram, ‚ÄúInformation Processing on Political Blogs by Readers, Lurkers, and Posters.‚Äù Ph.D. Dissertation: New School for Social Research, 2013, p. 56.

As a composer, her current catalogue includes eleven musical theatrical works, some of which have been produced by the Washington National Opera, the Los Angeles Opera and the Houston Grand Opera, and numerous vocal and instrumental chamber works. With regards to her musical inspirations, Sankaram stated, ‚ÄúI have played as much rock and avant jazz as I have classical music, and those connections are found in the music I write.‚Äù In the same interview, she also said, ‚ÄúI grew up hearing a lot Carnatic music in my house, so I think that those modalities are always present.

Therefore, as a gatekeeper, I see my role as inviting people to the table who may not have had an invitation before.‚ÄùLauren Alfano, ‚Äú5 Questions to Kamala Sankaram.‚Äù I Care If You Listen, January 8, 2019. https://www.icareifyoulisten.com/2019/01/5-questions-kamala-sankaram- experiments-in-opera/  Selected Commissions and Awards  = Commissions = * Washington National Opera * Houston Grand Opera * Beth Morrison Projects * Prototype Festival * Opera on Tap (for The Parksville Murders) * Opera Memphis * Brooklyn Youth Chorus = Awards = * American Theater Wing: Jonathan Larson Award * New York Innovative Theatre Awards: Outstanding Production of a Musical (Miranda) * Independent Music Awards Vox Pop: Best Eclectic Award (Bombay Rickey‚Äôs Cinefonia)  Grants  * National Endowment for the Arts * Opera America * Kevin Spacey Foundation * The MAP Fund  Residencies/Fellowships  * MacDowell Colony * The Watermill Center * The Civilians * HERE Arts Center (for the musical Miranda) * CAP21 * Con Edison/Exploring the Metropolis * The Hermitage * American Lyric Theater  Bibliography  * Suzanne G.

As part of the Selkirk Mountains, it is situated at the south end of the compact Sir Donald Range, hence the name origin. The mountain is a remote northeast of Revelstoke, and west of Golden. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Sir Donald, to the immediate northwest, and Mount Macoun rises to the south. The expansive Illecillewaet N√©v√© lies to the southwest, the Sir Donald Glacier lies below the steep northeast wall, and a small unnamed glacier lies at the bottom of the steep southeast slope. Precipitation runoff from the mountain and meltwater from the glaciers drains west into the Illecillewaet River, and east into the Beaver River. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1906 by Allan F. Kitchell, Cornelius P. Kitchell, and Edward Feuz Jr. The mountain's name was officially adopted December 31, 1924, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Terminal Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C.

Creation A declaration establishing the Femmes alg√©riennes pour un changement vers l'√©galit√© was signed on 16 March 2019 by Saadia Gacem and Fa√Øka Medjahed, members of the , , Habiba Djahnine and sixteen other women. The declaration called for full equality between female and male citizens, announced \\"the creation of a feminist square which will take place every Friday in front of the main entrance of Algiers 1 University () starting from 13:00\\" and called for equal representation of women in any citizens' projects aimed to resolve the aims of the Hirak protests. Actions =Feminist square= FACE describes the feminist square as enabling women to group together in a way that overcomes ordinary practical difficulties in meeting up while remaining active in the Hirak protests. The feminist squares aim to be static for one hour and then to start moving with the main march. The first feminist square () took place on Friday 22 March.This is the fifth Friday if 22 February is counted as the first Friday (popular usage) instead of 16 February (sources). The second took place on 29 March 2019, starting with the placing of banners. The female participants were verbally and physically assaulted and their banners were torn by protestors who stated that \\"it's not the right time\\", that the women \\"were splitting the movement\\" and that equality is against Islam. Other protestors protected the feminist square women. Police asked the women to leave. According to Le Figaro, the attack \\"damaged the image of a protest movement known for its pacifism and openness, especially for women\\". Amina Izarouken, a member of FACE responded to the demand to keep quiet by saying that \\"democracy will be made including women, with complete equality, or it won't be made\\". The feminist square became a regular component of the Hirak demonstrations. In the 1 November 2019 Hirak demonstration, one of the largest, feminist square protestors carried portraits of former female fighters. =Creation of MNFA= On 13 October in Oran, FACE and thirteen other feminist associations and coalitions, including the , established the Mouvement national des f√©ministes alg√©riennes (National Movement of Algerian Feminists, MNFA), rejecting the Algerian Family Code \\"which enshrines permanent misogyny\\", opposing the 12 December third attempted presidential election \\"imposed by an antinational force detested by the people\\" and calling for the release of political prisoners. Appeals On 16 December 2019, following the election of Abdelmadjid Tebboune in the 12 December third attempted presidential election, FACE and the feminist square declared that \\"Tebboune is not and never will be our president\\", denounced police repression, called for imprisoned protestors to be released and demanded that street protests, debates and political meetings of Hirak continue.

Her father, Jim Judkis, is a freelance photographer and her mother is an art professor. In 2007, she graduated from George Washington University with a degree in journalism and a minor in art history. While in college, she wrote for the University's paper The Hatchet, reviewing museums and concerts and providing cultural commentary. Career After college, Judkis worked for U.S. News and World Report and the since closed publication, TBD.com. Other bylines also included pieces for the Washington City Paper and the Huffington Post. She sought to cover a range of topics and fields as a way to diversity her skills and earning new assignments. While an art, theater and culture reporter for TBD.com she completed an arts journalism fellow with the National Endowment for the Arts and the University of Southern California. Judkis joined the staff of the Washington Post in 2011 as a style section producer. Her goal was to cover art and culture in the city. Her initial focus with on visual arts, which she has linked to her parents' work as artists. Judkis next worked as a reporter in the Weekend section, and joined the food section in 2014.

She was awarded the 2002 Society for Experimental Biology President's Medal. Her research investigates the role of the actin cytoskeleton in membrane trafficking and cell organisation.  Early life and education  Ayscough attended a comprehensive school near Bristol and studied biochemistry at the University of Oxford where she was a student at Exeter College, Oxford. She moved to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and University College London for her doctoral degree, where she worked on the Golgi apparatus in Schizosaccharomyces pombe under the supervision of Graham Warren.  Research and career  After her PhD, Ayscough moved to the University of California, Berkeley as a Wellcome Trust research fellow, working with David Drubin. Ayscough moved to the University of Dundee as a Wellcome Trust Development Fellow. She was appointed a Medical Research Council fellow at the University of Glasgow in 1999. In 2002 she was awarded the Society for Experimental Biology President's Medal. Ayscough joined the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of Sheffield in 2003 and was promoted to Professor in 2012. In 2016 Ayscough was appointed the Head of Biomedical Science at the University of Sheffield. She is a member of the Faculty of 1000 and has been funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). Her research considers the mechanisms that control cell organisation. In particular, she looks at how actin (an element of the cytoskeleton) can initiate the formation of filaments, which permit inward bending of the plasma membrane. Invagination, the inward bending process of the plasma membrane, is known as endocytosis, and ensures that cells can regulate the composition of their surface to respond to environmental signals. She has explored how dynamin, amphiphysin and actin work together during the formation of cell membranes. Ayscough has also studied how endocytosis and cell shape relate to the invasion and survival of Candida albicans. Alongside her research, Ayscough has worked on initiatives to promote equality and diversity including Athena SWAN. = Selected publications = Her publications include: * High rates of actin filament turnover in budding yeast and roles for actin in establishment and maintenance of cell polarity revealed using the actin inhibitor latrunculin-A * Latrunculin alters the actin-monomer subunit interface to prevent polymerization * Actin-binding proteins She has written for The Conversation.

Early Years  He was born in 1942 in Cawdor, Scotland, second son of John Campbell, 5th Earl Cawdor of Castlemartin and Wilma Mairi Vickers daughter of Vincent Cartwright Vickers (1879-1939), a governor of the Bank of England and a director of Vickers Ltd and author of The Google Book. This may have made a strong impression on James as later he often used birds in his works. James grew up on the family estates in north east Scotland and Stackpole estate in Pembrokeshire, Wales. He attended Eton College where Gordon Baldwin taught ceramics and sculpture. From 1959 the Royal College of Art ran a pilot scheme that involved accepting some students straight from school. After the entrance procedure, he gained a place and graduated in 1964 with a first class diploma.  Career  Soon he was teaching pot making on a foundation course, the students learning disciplines from ceramics to fashion. Now gainfully employed, he set up his first pottery workshop near Ross-on-Wye and started exhibiting his pots. He used different forms of clay: earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. His drawings were often executed in charcoal and colour pastels. In 1973 along with Lucie Rie, Hans Coper, Janet Leach and Ewen Henderson (artist) he exhibited at Tim Boon's Amalgam Gallery, Barnes village, opening exhibition entitled 'Five British Potters'. Campbell was the youngest exhibitor. In 2013 Campbell purchased a 16th timber-framed house and studio in Gloucestershire, not far from the site of his earlier workshop and produced hand built, individual pieces using a Staffordshire red clay.  The Google Book  He returned to The Google Book in 2019 when he collaborated with the researchers of The Google Book project. Campbell wrote the foreword to the updated and extended version of his grandfather Vincent Cartwright Vickers' original 1913 book The Google Book.

Career The first son of Barbora (born Kr√°sov√°) and Anton√≠n Slav√≠k, teacher and musician, who started to teach Josef violin in the age of four. Later on, he was a student of violin by Friedrich Wilhelm Pixis and music theory and composition by Friedrich Dionys Weber at the Prague Conservatory. Pixis wondered how anyone could write down such mad, unplayable stuff after seeing some of Slav√≠k's compositions (a concerto, variations, etc.). Before leaving Prague, Slav√≠k proved at a farewell concert at the Prague Conservatory that there was at least one who could play the mad stuff. He went to Vienna in 1825 and became a sensation. He was then a young man of nineteen, but already technically superior to other violinists that had been heard in the Austrian capital. The celebrated Mayseder called him a second Lipinski. Fr√©d√©ric Chopin who heard Slav√≠k on several occasions described his skills as: \\"With the exception of Paganini, I have never heard a player like him. Ninety-six staccatos in one bow!

Originally close to the emperor, her opposition to the Union of the Churches in 1273 led to their estrangement, and even to intrigues by Irene against Michael involving foreign rulers. As a result, she was imprisoned for the remainder of his reign. After Michael's death, she encouraged Andronikos II Palaiologos to repudiate the Union. Life Irene's brother, the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos Irene was born around 1218, the second daughter of the megas domestikos Andronikos Palaiologos and Theodora Angelina Palaiologina. Around 1240, she married John Kantakouzenos Komnenos Angelos, who died some time before 1257. After her husband's death, Irene became a nun and assumed the monastic name Eulogia. It is not known when exactly this happened, but she was a nun by 1261. Irene was close with her younger brother, Michael VIII Palaiologos, on whom she exerted great influence. The historian George Pachymeres reports on how she used to lull Michael to sleep with the assurance that he would be the future emperor who would recover Constantinople from the Latin Empire; in 1261, she was the one who brought him the news of the reconquest of Constantinople. Pachymeres also stresses Irene's political influence, including on the matter of the legitimate emperor, the young John IV Laskaris. In order to safeguard the rights of Michael's son, Andronikos II Palaiologos, Irene urged her brother to have Laskaris sidelined completely. Laskaris was eventually blinded. She also played a role in the disgrace, and subsequent blinding, of the general John Makrenos. The marriage of her daughter Maria to the Bulgarian ruler Constantine Tikh in 1268/69 further enhanced her political position. However, she rejected Michael's espousal of the Union of the Churches in 1273, and became a leader of the anti-Unionist faction at court. Her relationship with her brother turned to bitter hostility, and Michael banished her to the fortress of Gregorios in the Gulf of Nicomedia. Such was the enmity between the two, that after Michael died, Irene forbade his widow Theodora to pray for him. Irene also did not hesitate to involve her son-in-law in the anti-Unionist cause: with the aid of her daughter, she incited Tikh against Michael, and even tried, without success, to form an alliance against Byzantium between Bulgaria and the Mamluk Sultanate. After Michael died in 1282, Andronikos II Palaiologos repudiated the Union thanks, in part, to the influence of his aunt. Irene died in early December 1284. Family Irene's husband John Kantakouzenos Komnenos Angelos is identified by Donald Nicol with the pinkernes John Kantakouzenos. Known children of this couple include: * Theodora, who married (1) George Mouzalon, (2) John Raoul Petraliphas * Maria, wife of Constantine Tikh, Tsar of Bulgaria * Anna, wife of Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas * Eugenia, wife of Syrgiannes, and mother of Syrgiannes Palaiologos * a possible fifth unnamed daughter, who married Theodore Mouzalon References Sources    * Category:1210s births Category:1284 deaths Category:13th-century Byzantine women Irene Category:13th-century Christian nuns Category:Byzantine prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of the Byzantine Empire Category:Anti-Catholicism in Eastern Orthodoxy ","title":"Irene Komnene Palaiologina"},{"id":"62652328","text":"Lord (left) and Miller (right) at the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con The following is a list of unproduced Phil Lord and Christopher Miller projects in roughly chronological order. During their career, film-making duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under their direction. Some of these projects are officially cancelled or fell in development hell. 2010s =The Reunion= In 2013, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were attached to The Reunion, a comedy about a high school reunion. The film was set-up at Sony Pictures and was to be produced by Lord, Miller (under their Lord Miller banner), Jonathan Kadin, and Hannah Minghella, and written and directed solely by Miller. In 2014, Lord and Miller were still optimistic in making The Reunion while promoting The Lego Movie. =Untitled Ghostbusters film= In April 2014, Sony pursued a short list of potential directors for Ghostbusters 3, including Phil Lord and Chris Miller, but they passed on the project. =The Greatest American Hero reboot= In August 2014, Lord and Miller were attached to reboot the 1981 TV series The Greatest American Hero for Fox. They were to executive produce the series, with 22 Jump Street co-writer Rodney Rothman writing the pilot and also executive producing. By 2017, Lord, Miller, and Rothman were out as 20th Century Fox Television were interested in developing a female-led reboot from Fresh Off the Boat creator Nahnatchka Khan and would instead air on ABC. However, ABC decided to not pick up the show in 2018. =23 Jump Street/MIB 23= On September 10, 2014, 23 Jump Street was confirmed. Channing Tatum had yet to sign on to the project, stating, \\"I don't know if that joke works three times, so we'll see.\\" On August 7, 2015, it was revealed that Lord and Miller would not direct the film, but instead write and produce. A first draft of the film's script has been completed. On December 10, 2014, it was revealed that Sony was planning a crossover between Men in Black and Jump Street. The news was leaked after Sony's system was hacked and then confirmed by the directors of the films, Lord and Miller, during an interview about it. James Bobin was announced as the director in March 2016. The title of the crossover was later revealed as MIB 23, and it was revealed that the crossover would replace a 23 Jump Street film. However, the project was canceled in January 2019. Shortly after, Phil Lord stated that, despite MIB 23 not happening, a third sequel entitled 24 Jump Street was in development. =Female-driven 21 Jump Street= In early 2015, a female-driven 21 Jump Street film was rumored to also be in the works. In December 2016, Rodney Rothman was confirmed to direct the film. In December 2018, Tiffany Haddish was confirmed to lead the film and Awkwafina is in talks. =The Flash= By April 2015, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were writing a story treatment for The Flash film for the DC Extended Universe. In October 2015, Seth Grahame-Smith was in negotiations to direct and write the script, based on the treatment by Lord and Miller. He departed the project due to creative differences in April 2016. =Solo: A Star Wars Story= In January 2017, Lord and Miller began directing the then-untitled film, a standalone Star Wars movie based on the Han Solo character. On June 20, 2017 it was reported that they had been fired from the project by Lucasfilm, after over four-and-a-half months of filming, about three-quarters through principal photography. Lucasfilm announced that \\"creative differences\\" were the reason, with Entertainment Weekly reporting that Lord and Miller were going off-script and trying to make the film into more of a comedy. They were unwilling to compromise with Lucasfilm and writer Lawrence Kasdan on the direction of the film, preferring their vision. Two days later, Ron Howard was announced as the replacement, to complete the film and reshoots. Lord and Miller received executive-producer credits on Solo: A Star Wars Story. In November 2017, Lord and Miller commented on their departure from Solo: A Star Wars Story. Lord stated \\"The experience of shooting the movie was wonderful. We had the most incredible cast and crew and collaborators. [...] We're really proud of the work we did on the movie and we wish everybody the best.\\" Miller added \\"As Phil said, we had such a great relationship with cast and crew, we were really rooting for them. After we took a much-needed vacation, we got back into it and now we're writing and producing a sequel to The Lego Movie and producing a Miles Morales animated Spider-Man.\\" =America: The Motion Picture= In March 2017, they were producing an R-rated animated Netflix original film called America: The Motion Picture alongside Will Allegra, Matt Thompson, Adam Reed, Channing Tatum, Reid Carolin and Peter Kiernan from a screenplay by David Callaham and directed by Thompson.

It was first detailed in February 2019 by way of an Explanatory Memorandum. The Act will for the first time in Wales afford 16 and 17 year olds the right to vote, beginning with the 2021 Senedd Election. The decision is the largest franchise extension in Wales since 1969, when the Representation of the People Act 1969 reduced the voting age from 21 to 18. The franchise will also be extended to \\"eligible foreign nationals\\". The Act also changes the name of the legislature to \\"Senedd Cymru\\" or \\"the Welsh Parliament\\". The decision was controversial and saw much debate in the Chamber between those who favoured the single name Senedd and those (led by former First Minister Carwyn Jones) who sought to include a bilingual element. Guidance issued following the passage of the Act suggests that the institution is to be commonly known as the 'Senedd' in both English and Welsh. The law has also been changed so that disqualified individuals are prohibited from taking up a seat in the Senedd rather than being prohibited from standing for election, and by ensuring that the Electoral Commission is funded by and accountable to the Senedd for Welsh elections. The Bill was agreed by the Assembly on 27 November 2019. It became an Act following Royal Assent on 15 January 2020. The contents of the act were implemented in May 2020.

Davis' had six major collections, the last shown at Manhattan restaurant Caffe Roma.  Beginnings  Karl Davis ‚ÄúDesigner Files‚Äù archival materials at Fashion Institute of Technology‚Äôs research library reveal that during his teen years Davis was taught by a friend‚Äôs mother how to operate a sewing machine, and that when he was fifteen years old, he for the first time made classic, pleated slacks for himself. Davis graduated from high school in August 1980. At age 17, he left Brooklyn and began designing. Davis attended New York‚Äôs Fashion Institute of Technology for only one semester - six months - and while there studied pattern making. He then worked as an assistant to Carol Fertig and, too, as a freelance design assistant to Bill Blass. It was while Davis was working as design assistant that he sold first styles to Henri Bendel. During 1984, Davis established his own collection. Initially, he was financed by his supportive, fashionable mother - Rose. Fashion designer Though brief ‚Äì from age 17 until shortly before his death at age 25 ‚Äì Karl Davis experienced a career highly praised and of impressive achievement. Newsweek (10 August 1987) observed that Davis created an exclusive line of classic women‚Äôs clothing, which New York Newsday (4 May 1986) described as grown-up clothes not for those on a tight budget. New York Magazine (17 September 1987) stated that ladies dressed in Davis- designed wardrobes would look ‚Äústrong, confident, and elegant ‚Äì not to mention, in many instances, frankly sexy‚Äù. Fashion columnists of the Dallas Morning News (18 December 1985) reported that Davis‚Äôs work was strongly influenced by the great masters of couture, but that he managed to move forward, adding his own signature of modern minimalism; further stating that his approach to fashion and to his business were in remarkable contrast to his age. Taxi (November 1986) commented that being young and having no financial backing did not intimidate Davis from creating couture clothing of the highest level; that respect should be paid to him and fashion magazine should acknowledge him and take the initiative to put him on the map; and also that a lady dressed in Davis‚Äôs clothes would not only be taken seriously, but would be praised for her good taste and silent elegance - daring to detach herself from the uniforms of a working machine. Taxi quoted Davis: ‚ÄúI love what I‚Äôm doing ‚Äì making women look like women again! The lady I sell to is dressed femininely and still gains respect on a business level.‚Äù Taxi further observed that a customer from Henri Bendel would never suspect that the dress she just purchased was from a young designer who supported himself by making bagel sandwiches in a downtown coffee shop. True, Davis did prepare sandwiches at ‚ÄúTamala Designs With Bagel‚Äù [153 Prince Street], a SoHo clothing store with food counter in the back owned by Aggie Markowitz who reflected \\"[Karl] was an integral part of the downtown fashion mafia. He gave fashion commentary while he sort of made bagel sandwiches. The commentary usually came faster than the food\\". Taxi (November 1986) quoted Davis: ‚ÄúMost people would rather spend money on flashy clothes that scream and spell ‚Äòexpensive‚Äô, rather than purchasing understated elegant garments\\". Pr√™t (May 1986) said Davis was beginning to shake up the New York fashion scene with his elegant, dramatic cuts and sophisticated sense of style, that his designs were Inspired by the looks of Dior, Balenciaga and Chanel; and that he took a modern approach to the values and attitudes of Haute Couture and reinvented them for a new, younger generation. Pr√™t additionally observed that Davis chose to work with very basic shapes and inject something hidden or unexpected into them which he described as ‚Äúclassic with a twist‚Äù; that he focused primarily on playing up and enhancing the feminine form; and that to further emphasize his attention to shape, he - with a keen focus on the waist and hips for both day and evening wear - tended to stay away from loud prints and patterns and designs. During December 1985, Davis found a backer and also was able to travel to Europe ‚Äì both having significant impact on his May 1986 showing ‚ÄúKarl Davis Fall 1986 Collection‚Äù. New York Newsday (24 August 1986) declared Davis to be ‚ÄúNew York‚Äôs new crown prince of near couture‚Äù.

He is very fond of fashion: it‚Äôs as if he was born to enjoy wearing clothes. The clothes he wears are not shockingly avant-garde or showy. Karl is a unique dresser whose taste is classic, as well as modern, neat and refined. He creates his tasteful and sophisticated look by skillfully combining brand name clothes, antiques, and ordinary garments.‚Äù True to his nature, Davis in1980 was voted ‚ÄúBest Dressed Male‚Äù of his George-Wingate-High-School [Brooklyn, NY] graduating class. Illness and death On 2 May 1987, Karl Davis died of pneumonia at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY. Davis‚Äôs death was due to complications from HIV/AIDS.

He is attested by numerous accounts of the Battle of Clontarf in which he is said to have lost his life supporting the cause of Brian B√≥ruma mac Cenn√©tig, High King of Ireland, a king whose forces fought against those of Sitriuc mac Amla√≠b, King of Dublin, M√°el M√≥rda mac Murchada, King of Leinster and Sigur√∞r Hl«´√∞visson, Earl of Orkney. Domnall is the first Mormaer of Mar on record, and the Irish sources that note him are the earliest sources to note the province of Mar. Domnall is the only Scottish combatant recorded to have in the Battle of Clontarf. His motivations for fighting are uncertain. Attestations Locations relating to Domnall's life and times.

The battle was fought by the forces of the High King of Ireland against the allied forces of Sitriuc mac Amla√≠b, King of Dublin, M√°el M√≥rda mac Murchada, King of Leinster, and Sigur√∞r Hl«´√∞visson, Earl of Orkney.Wadden (2015) p. 16; Hudson, B (2005); Hudson, B (2002) p. 241. Although Brian's forces won the fight, it was a Pyrrhic victory,Casey (2013) p. 140; Casey (2010) p. 29; Jaski (2005); Hudson, B (2002) p. 242. leaving both sides decimated, with Brian and members of his immediate family amongst the dead, and his objective of capturing Dublin left unfulfilled.Jaski (2005); Hudson, B (2002) p. 242. Domnall's part in the clash is noted by numerous historical sources: including the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise,Downham (2007) p. 157; Anderson (1922) pp. 534‚Äì537 n. 2; Murphy (1896) p. 167. the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch C√©,Downham (2017) p. 95; N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2012) pp. 144‚Äì145; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1014.3; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1014.3; Duffy (1999) p. 353; Duffy (1993) p. 24; Anderson (1922) pp. 534‚Äì537 n. 2. the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters,Downham (2017) p. 95; Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1013.11; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1013.11; N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2012) pp. 144‚Äì145; Downham (2007) p. 157; Duffy (1999) p. 353; Duffy (1993) p. 24. the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster,Noble; Gondek; Campbell et al.

Another important account of the battle noting Domnall is preserved within the manuscript Oxford Bodleian Library MS Rawlinson B 486.N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2012) pp. 144‚Äì145, 160‚Äì161. It is remarkable that the Munster-based eleventh- to fourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen makes no notice of Domnall.Downham (2017) p. 95. Domnall appears to have been one of the principal commanders in the battle, and appears to have commanded a portion of Brian's army composed of foreign mercenaries. The forces of the Dublin-Leinster-Orkney coalition were commanded by M√°el M√≥rda and Sigur√∞r.Hudson, B (2005); Hudson, BT (2005) p. 99. Brian does not appear to have taken part in battle,Duffy (2014) p. 30. whilst Sitriuc's part is more obscure.Beougher (2007) pp. 192‚Äì193; Hudson, B (2005); Hudson, BT (2005) p. 99. According to Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib, Brian's forces were organised into three battalions. The battalion that appears to have formed the left flank is stated to have been composed of ten mormaers and their Scandinavian allies.Beougher (2007) pp. 207 fig. 5-7, 211; Todd (1867) pp. 168‚Äì169 ch. 97. With exception to Domnall, the obscurity of this formation's commanders is remarkable in comparison to the other battalions. This partly evinces the probability that Domnall's unit was mainly composed of Scandinavian troops.Beougher (2007) pp. 211‚Äì212. Opposite this battalion, the coalition's right flank appears to have been composite force of Scandinavian mercenaries in the fore and Leinstermen in the rear.Beougher (2007) pp. 208‚Äì209. Death A nineteenth-century depiction of the Battle of Clontarf.Duffy (2014) p. 32 fig.; Casey (2013) p. 140 fig. The most accurate accounts of the battle are the historical Irish chronicles. Sources such as Chronicon Scotorum, the Annals of Inisfallen, and the Annals of Ulster probably stem from contemporary reports of events. Sources such as the Annals of Clonmacnoise and the Cottonian Annals appear to incorporate latter legends.Downham (2005) p. 21. Instead of being an accurate and impartial account of history, Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib is probably a piece of D√°l Cais/U√≠ Briain propaganda,Downham (2017) p. 102; N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2017b); Wadden (2016) p. 175; Wadden (2015) p. 20; Clarkson (2014) ch. 8 ¬∂ 4; Somerville; McDonald (2014) p. 199; Casey (2013) p. 139; Swift (2013) p. 122; DuBois (2011) p. 269; Casey (2010) pp. 30, 32; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 46; Beougher (2007) pp. 6, 38 n. 65, 53; Breatnach (2005); Downham (2005) p. 21; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 225; Hudson, B (2002) p. 255; √ì Corr√°in (1998) p. 443; N√≠ Mhaonaigh (1996) pp. 101, 105‚Äì106; N√≠ Mhaonaigh (1995); N√≠ Mhaonaigh (1992) pp. 135‚Äì137; Candon (1988) p. 397. compiled for the benefit of Brian's great-grandson, Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster.Downham (2017) pp. 97‚Äì99; N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2017a); N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2017b) p. 170; Wadden (2015) p. 20; Somerville; McDonald (2014) p. 199; Swift (2013) p. 122; DuBois (2011) p. 269; Beougher (2007) p. 6; Taylor, S (2006) p. 27; Breatnach (2005); Downham (2005) p. 21; Hudson, B (2002) p. 255; N√≠ Mhaonaigh (1996) p. 101; N√≠ Mhaonaigh (1995); N√≠ Mhaonaigh (1992) pp. 136‚Äì137, 145; Candon (1988) p. 397. The treatment that Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib gives to British affairs appears to reflect the eleventh- and twelfth-century ambitions of the U√≠ Briain in the Kingdom of the Isles.Downham (2017) p. 100. As such, there is reason to suspect that its (possibly exaggerated) depiction of Domnall may have been intended to promote a theme of shared interests between Munster and Alba.Downham (2017) pp. 96‚Äì97. This positive portrayal of international relations reflects the political connections cultivated between Muirchertach and the Scots.Downham (2017) p. 102. Nevertheless, Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib is the only source to give specific detail about the battle, and Domnall plays a prominent part in its account.N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 139 n. 42; Hudson, BT (1994) p. 114. According to this source, the night before hostilities, a certain Plait, identified as the son of the King of , boasted that there was no man in Ireland fit to fight him. Domnall, however, is said to have made it known that he was up to the challenge.Downham (2017) pp. 94‚Äì95; Beougher (2007) p. 212; Ryan (1938) p. 39; Todd (1867) pp. 174‚Äì175 ch. 100. The following day, once the battalions were arrayed on the field of battle, Plait is said to have called out Domnall, whereupon the two fight one another, dying by each other's hand. As such, according to Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib, the two were the first combatants to clash at the Battle of Clontarf.Downham (2017) pp. 94‚Äì95; Duffy (2013) ch. 5; Swift (2013) p. 137; Beougher (2007) pp. 212‚Äì213; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 101; Ryan (1938) pp. 39‚Äì40; Todd (1867) pp. 174‚Äì177 ch. 100. The episode concerning Domnall and Plait's fight makes up an entire chapter of this source.Hudson, BT (1994) p. 114; Todd (1867) pp. 174‚Äì177 ch. 100. Whether the two actually encountered each other the night before is questionable,Beougher (2007) p. 212. as is perhaps the claim that the battle began with the duel between two opposing champions.Duffy (2013) ch. 5. If there is any historical basis to the tale, it may be more likely that the two had crossed paths sometime previous, and that the battle merely allowed them to settle an old score. Some of the dialogue attributed to Domnall and Plait by Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib contains Gaelicised forms of Old Norse vocabulary:Duffy (2013) ch. 5; Beougher (2007) p. 212; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 101; Hudson, BT (1994) p. 114; Ryan (1938) pp. 39‚Äì40, 39 n. 135, 40 n. 135. Specifically, the Gaelic in this passage is a form of the Old Norse , meaning \\"where is\\"; and the Gaelic is a form of the Old Norse , meaning \\"wretch, scoundrel\\".Duffy (2013) ch. 5; Beougher (2007) p. 212; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 101; Hudson, BT (1994) p. 114; Ryan (1938) pp. 39 n. 135, 40 n. 135; Kershaw (1922) p. 112; Todd (1867) p. 175 n. 16. The dialogue between Domnall and Plait may therefore evince bilingualism between the two.Beougher (2007) pp. 212, 212‚Äì213 n. 300; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 101; Hudson, BT (1994) p. 114. Domnall's first notice by Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib depicts him delivering a message from Brian to Brian's eldest son, Murchad, instructing the latter not to take an advanced position on the battlefield in front of his troops. When Murchad retorts that he is unwilling retreat one foot of land in front of his men, and declares that many false heroes will fall back and leave their share of the battle to him, Domnall swears that he will not shirk from his part. Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib then remarks that Domnall was indeed true to his word.Downham (2017) p. 96; Duffy (2013) ch. 5; Todd (1867) pp. 170‚Äì171 ch. 98. Domnall is thus depicted as a trusted and true follower of Brian, and it is possible that this passage was intended increase the drama in preparation for the account of Domnall's final fall.Downham (2017) p. 96. There is no mention of Domnall's title in this pre-battle scene,Downham (2017) p. 96; Duffy (2013) ch. 5. and the text implies that Domnall was personally attached to Brian, occupying a leadership role under him. Plait is otherwise unrecorded by historical chronicles. If Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib was indeed authored at the behest of Muirchertach, one possibility is that Plait is merely a literary invention intended to reflect relations between Muirchertach and the Kingdom of Norway. Although Muirchertach faced a serious threat from Magn√∫s √ìl√°fsson, King of Norway during his reign, the two orchestrated a marriage alliance between Muirchertach's daughter, Bja√∞munjo, and Magn√∫s' son, Sigur√∞r. When Magn√∫s was killed in 1103, Sigur√∞r returned to Norway, leaving Bja√∞munjo behind. It is remarkable that Plait‚Äîdescribed as the son of the King of ‚Äîis one of the few Scandinavians noted for bravery by Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib. This may reflect relations between Muirchertach and Sigur√∞r,Downham (2017) p. 101 n. 69. who, according to the thirteenth-century Morkinskinna, exacted tribute from Ireland during his reign as King of Norway.Downham (2017) p. 101 n. 69; Andersson; Gade (2012) p. 335 ch. 70; Power (2005) p. 18; Power (1986) p. 128; J√≥nsson (1932) p. 366; Unger (1867) p. 175. Context An eighteenth- century depiction of Brian B√≥ruma mac Cenn√©tig, probably the earliest depiction of the king.Emperor of the Irish (n.d.); Keating and the King in Print (n.d.); The General History of Ireland (n.d.). Domnall is the only man from Alba recorded to have died at the Battle of Clontarf.Woolf (2000) p. 162. The fact that surviving sources focus upon the slain makes it uncertain if there were other leaders from Alba present. Domnall's part in the battle partly evinces the international nature of the clash,Beougher (2007) pp. 198‚Äì199, 212‚Äì213, 244; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 99. and may be indicative of Brian's diplomatic ability.Downham (2014) p. 23. Nevertheless, it is uncertain in what context he took part in it.Duffy (2009) p. 290; Duffy (1999) pp. 353‚Äì354; Duffy (1993) p. 24. On one hand, Domnall may have merely acted as a hired mercenary,Duffy (2013) ch. 3; Walker (2013) ch. 5 ¬∂ 13; MacShamhr√°in (2005) p. 17, 17 n. 71; Duffy (1993) p. 23. or perhaps as a dislocated nobleman exiled from Alba. If he had been fostered by an Irish family, it is also conceivable that Domnall could have felt obliged to serve alongside them.Walker (2013) ch. 5 ¬∂ 13. According to Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib, Brian took tribute throughout the Irish Sea region, including from the men of Lennox and Argyll.Downham (2017) p. 93, 93 n. 29; Wadden (2016) p. 175; Clarkson (2014) ch. 8 ¬∂¬∂ 4‚Äì5; Duffy (2013) ch. 3; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 46; Taylor, S (2006) pp. 26‚Äì27; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 76; N√≠ Mhaonaigh (1995) p. 376; Hudson, BT (1994) p. 114; Candon (1988) p. 408; Anderson (1922) p. 525 n. 3; Todd (1867) pp. 136‚Äì137 ch. 78. If there is any truth to this claim, it could be evidence of otherwise unrecorded contact between Brian and the Scots that could account for Domnall's part in the battle.Hudson, BT (1994) p. 114. Less than a decade before the battle, in 1005, M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda overturned his cousin, Cin√°ed mac Duib, King of Alba, and seized the kingship of Alba.Broun (2004b).

Whether there is any connection between Brian's imperial title and Domnall's presence at Clontarf is uncertain,Duffy (2009) p. 290. although it could account for the Scottish presence at the battle,Etchingham (2007) p. 160. and may be evidence that Domnall recognised Brian's authority.Duffy (2013) ch. 3; Etchingham (2007) p. 160; Etchingham (2001) p. 180. The name of M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda as it appears on folio 16v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488 (the Annals of Tigernach): \\"\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1034.1; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1034.1; Annals of Tigernach, etc (n.d.). There is reason to suspect that Domnall's participation stemmed from dynastic discord in Alba. As such, the record of Domnall at Clontarf could be evidence that a Scottish faction, with designs upon the kingship of Alba, aligned itself with Brian and recognised his overlordship in pursuit of its royal ambitions.Wadden (2015) p. 18; MacShamhr√°in (2005) p. 17, 17 n. 71; Duffy (1999) p. 354; Duffy (1993) p. 24. Little is known of M√°el Coluim's reign. There is reason to suspect that his rule was challenged by Clann Ruaidr√≠, the family that held the mormaership of Moray. During his reign, for example, two members of this kindred‚ÄîFindl√°ech mac Ruaidr√≠ and M√°el Coluim mac Ma√≠l Br√≠gte‚Äîare styled as kings by certain Irish sources in records of their deaths.Woolf (2009) p. 261; Broun (2004b); Duffy (1999) pp. 349‚Äì350.

Nevertheless, the fact that the Annals of Inisfallen ignores the deaths of these Moravians‚Äîunlike the Annals of Tigernach, Annals of Ulster, Chronicon Scotorum, and the thirteenth-century Book of Leinster‚Äîcould be evidence that the Kings of Munster were either uninterested or opposed to them.Downham (2017) p. 101. Although it is possible that the Moravians launched their bid for the kingship immediately after M√°el Coluim's violent accession, they could have capitalised upon any event between Cin√°ed's death and the notice of Findl√°ech's royal title in 1020. One such point may have been the aftermath of the Battle of Clontarf.Woolf (2000) pp. 161‚Äì162. The name of Sitriuc mac Amla√≠b as it appears on folio 16v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1028.2; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1028.2; Annals of Tigernach, etc (n.d.). Even though M√°el Coluim was not a combatant at Clontarf, and the battle had no direct bearing on his kingship, there is evidence to indicate that several associates of his may have been involved.Downham (2014) p. 23; Woolf (2000) p. 162. For example, the twelfth- century Prophecy of Berch√°n, states that M√°el Coluim was the son of Leinsterwoman,Duffy (2013) ch. 3; Duffy (2009) p. 289; Downham (2007) p. 157; Woolf (2000) p. 162; Duffy (1999) p. 353; Hudson, BT (1996) pp. 52 ¬ß 183, 90 ¬ß 183, 220; Duffy (1993) p. 23; Anderson (1930) p. 51 ¬ß 181; Skene (1867) p. 99. whereas the thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga states that Sigur√∞r was married to a daughter of M√°el Coluim.Downham (2007) p. 157; Woolf (2000) p. 162; Hudson, BT (1994) p. 135; Anderson (1922) p. 509 n. 4; Vigfusson (1887) p. 15 ch. 12; Anderson; Hjaltalin (1873) pp. 3 ch. 1, 212 ch. 187. Another figure recorded to have fallen at the battle is Gilla Ciar√°in,The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1014.2; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1014.2; Woolf (2000) p. 162. an apparent senior member of the U√≠ √çmair who may be identical to Gilli, a Hebridean earl who, according to the thirteenth-century Nj√°ls saga, governed the Hebrides under Sigur√∞r's overlordship.Woolf (2000) p. 162; Williams (1997) pp. 143‚Äì144; Dasent (1967) p. 163 ch. 88; Anderson (1922) pp. 502‚Äì503; √Åsmundarson (1910) p. 213 ch. 89; J√≥nsson (1908) p. 203 ch. 89; Vigfusson (1887) p. 324 ch. 90. Furthermore, the mother of Sitriuc was also from Leinster, and thus possibly a kinsman of M√°el Coluim. The name Sigur√∞r Hl«´√∞visson as it appears on folio 12v of AM 45 fol (Codex Frisianus): \\"\\".Unger (1871) p. 56 ch. 35; AM 45 Fol (n.d.). The customary allegiance of the people of Mar is unknown, and it is uncertain whether Domnall's part in the fray is evidence that Brian was aligned with M√°el Coluim or Findl√°ech.Woolf (2007) p. 243; Woolf (2000) p. 162.

In fact, M√°el Coluim could well have been wary of the ambitions of the U√≠ √çmair and Orcadians, and it is possible that he decided to remain a neutral player in their struggle against Brian.Downham (2007) p. 157, 157 n. 127. The evidence that M√°el Coluim's mother was a Leinsterwoman, and that Sigur√∞r was his son-in-law, suggest that M√°el Coluim may have been inclined to side with Sitriuc and Sigur√∞r against Brian.Downham (2007) p. 157. It may be that Domnall's support of Brian stemmed from these close ties of kinship between M√°el Coluim and Sigur√∞r, and that Domnall's presence at Clontarf was a reaction to the threat of this alliance. The fact that Domnall risked‚Äîand lost‚Äîhis life to support Brian's cause could be evidence that Domnall was indeed opposed to Sigur√∞r and M√°el Coluim. One reason why some foreigners may have sided with Brian is because of growing unease of Sigur√∞r's growing power.Wadden (2015) p. 18. The threat of this Orcadian ascendance could have spurned M√°el Coluim to counter Sigur√∞r by sending Domnall overseas to assist Brian. If Domnall indeed campaigned on M√°el Coluim's behalf, and if M√°el Coluim was indeed descended from a Leinsterwoman, another possibility is that M√°el Coluim's Leinster kinsmen were rivals of M√°el M√≥rda. As such, it is conceivable that Domnall's support of Brian could have stemmed from inter- dynastic discord in Ireland.Hudson, BT (1994) pp. 114‚Äì115.

The site of the plantation was just south of Turkey Island, one of William Randolph's earliest land holdings. Richard Randolph most likely built the house at Presquile for his son David Meade Randolph, the husband of the esteemed Mary Randolph. Unfortunately, the couple did not live at Presquile for long, as the land surrounding it was extremely swampy and did not promote good health. In 1798 they moved to Richmond and lived in a grand mansion called Moldavia. The next owner of Presquile was Abner Osborne of Nottoway County, who bought the property for ¬£5,000 in 1801. It went through the 19th century and early 20th as a standard farm until 1952 when A. D. Williams, a Richmond tobacco magnate and philanthropist, died. In his will he gave the Presquile tract to the Virginia Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries to be used as a wildlife preserve. The following year the land was passed to the US Department of the Interior and is today managed by the National Park Service as the Presquile National Wildlife Refuge. The house at Presquile was originally used by the park staff until a new dwelling nearby was built. In 1964, a historical consultant for the park service stated that he believed that the house had been built after the Civil War (when in reality it was 100 years older) and thus the 200 year old house was demolished.

Early Life and Education  Igor Sinyavin (1937-2000) was born in the village of Sinyavino in the Leningrad region of Russia. He studied at the Military Topographic College, the Leningrad State University, later at the Faculty of History at the Department of Art History, but did not graduate.  Nonconformist Art and Prosecution  As he was a member of the nonconformist art scene in the USSR, he was often subject to political prosecution. During the 1960s he worked with other nonconformist painters and organized exhibitions in Moscow and Leningrad. He began to independently engage in drawing and painting in 1969, and participated in apartment exhibitions where he discussed the problems of contemporary art. He presented his art at the Bulldozer Exhibition (September 15, 1974), an unofficial exhibition that ended with several arrests and the destruction of the participants' art. Since the Bulldozer Exhibition aroused international news coverage and strong public disapproval, and Soviet authorities reluctantly agreed to allow two nonconformist exhibitions. Becoming a prominent member of the Soviet non- conformist art scene, he was on the organizing committee and presented his works in the first Soviet permitted non-conformist exhibitions in the Izmailovsky Park in Moscow (September 29, 1974) and in Leningrad (December 22-25, 1974). During the Leningrad exhibit, Sinyavin presented a blank canvas and invited visitors to sign their names with a marker. This collage of names along with the high attendance demonstrated the public's support for the nonconformist movement and angered the Soviet authorities.New York in 1978. On December 15, 1975, Sinyavin, along with other nonconformist artists and poets, staged a poetry-reading on the Senate Square to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the Decembrists' uprising. Sinyavin was detained by the police. = Emigration to the United States = In May 1976, Sinyavin exhibited his works in an unauthorized open-air exhibition and was detained and put under house arrest. The KGB pressured Sinyavin to emigrate in 1976, and he left for Vienna on his way to New York, United States. Like most immigrants emigrating from the Soviet Union, he was given an exit visa listing Israel as his destination. He returned to the USSR in 1986. = Style = Sinyavin was a constructive abstractionist. While the Soviet Union only permitted art that pertained Socialist Realism and glorified communist values, his art focused on geometric shapes and patterns. In his memoir, Glas (Russian: –ì–ª–∞—Å), he describes his modernist style \\"as a force capable of liberating a person and creating a new world of excellence\\" and one that \\"brings chaos from the bowels of the subconscious mind.\\"  Authorship  Sinyavin contributed to several political magazines, wrote multiple articles, and published two books. In early 1976, he wrote the almanac \\"Petersburg Meetings\\" (Russian: \\"–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–∏–µ –í—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∏\\") for the underground magazine Samizdat, in which he criticized the practices and policies of the Soviet Union. He also wrote the article \\"To the Creator\\" (Russian: \\"–ß–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫—É —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—è¬≠—â–µ–º—É\\") for Samizdat. Sinyavin was a member of the editorial board for the magazine \\"Time Measure\\" (Russian: \\"–ú–µ—Ä–∞ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏\\") along with Yu. Voznesenskaya, G. Trifonov, and V. Filimonov. He wrote poems and created graphics for the magazine. The KGB disrupted its release. In 1984, the newspaper Leningradskaya Pravda published his \\"Letter from There\\", in which he illustrated and criticized the American way of life and condemned the idea of emigration. After this article was written, Sinyavin came to the USSR and appeared on Soviet press and television. = Books = * Glas (Russian: –ì–ª–∞—Å) (1991) * The Path of Truth (Russian: –°—Ç–µ–∑–∏ –ü—Ä–∞–≤–¥—ã) (1996)  References  Category:1937 births Category:2000 deaths ","title":"Igor Sinyavin"},{"id":"62652654","text":"Engilbert II (died 13 August 934) was a Benedictine monk and scribe of the abbey of Saint Gall.

Four surviving charters from between the years 890 and 896 are thought to have been drafted by the future abbot. Between 895 and 914 two monks are mentioned with the name Engilbert. The future abbot was probably the younger of these. Consequently, Engilbert would have been subdeacon in 895. He is also described as the abbey's porter in a document from 2 July 898. Engilbert is first attested as abbot on 21 September 925.G√∂ssi, p. 113, on the other hand, has him elected abbot after 21 September 925 and first mentioned as abbot on 26 May 926. King Henry I of Germany recognized his election and, on 4 November 926, confirmed his abbey's immunity from taxation and the local court, its right to freely elect its own abbot and its right of inquisition over its dependencies. In 933, he retired for reasons of health. During Engilbert's abbacy in May 926, a major Hungarian raid passed through Swabia. His preemptive measures helped mitigate the damage to the monastery and its inhabitants. He ordered the construction of two castles for the protection of the inhabitants. The elderly and the children were sent for safety to Wasserburg across Lake Constance, while the library was removed to Reichenau Island and the monks took refuge in a fortress on the river Sitter. The legend of Saint Wiborada takes place before and during this Hungarian invasion.

While ABC has, in the past, aired notable sporting events such as the NFL's Monday Night Football, and various college football bowl games (including, most prominently for a period, the Bowl Championship Series), general industry trends and changes in rights have prompted reductions in sports broadcasts on broadcast television (the BCS's successor, the College Football Playoff and national championship, air exclusively on ESPN). ABC is the broadcast television rightsholder of the National Basketball Association (NBA), with its package (under the NBA on ESPN branding) traditionally beginning with its Christmas Day games, followed by a series of Sunday afternoon games through the remainder of the season, weekend playoff games, and all games of the NBA Finals. During college football season, ABC typically carries an afternoon doubleheader on Saturdays, along with the primetime Saturday Night Football. ABC also airs coverage of selected bowl games. The Saturday afternoon lineup outside of football season typically features airings of ESPN Films documentaries or other studio programs under the banner ESPN Sports Saturday, while Sunday afternoons usually feature either brokered programming, or encore and burn-off airings of ABC programs. 1950s =Early beginnings as Sports Programs, Inc.= Widely credited as a pioneer in network sports broadcasting, Edgar Scherick created the television program ABC's Wide World of Sports at his company Sports Programs, Inc. which he started in 1956 with $600.00. Scherick had formed this company after leaving CBS when the network would not make him the head of sports programming, choosing instead Bill MacPhail, a former baseball public-relations agent. Before ABC Sports even became a formal division of the network, Scherick and ABC programming chief Tom Moore pulled off many programming deals involving the most popular American sporting events. While Scherick wasn't interested in \\"For Men Only,\\" he recognized the talent Roone Arledge had. Arledge realized ABC was the organization he was looking to join. The lack of a formal organization would offer him the opportunity to claim real power when the network matured. So, he signed on with Scherick as an assistant producer. Several months before ABC began broadcasting NCAA college football games, Arledge sent Scherick a remarkable memo, filled with youthful exuberance, and television production concepts which sports broadcasts have adhered to since. Previously, network sporting broadcasts had consisted of simple set-ups and focused on the game itself. The genius of Arledge in this memo was not that he offered another way to broadcast the game to the sports fan. Arledge recognized television had to take the sports fan to the game. In addition, Arledge realized that the broadcasts needed to attract, and hold the attention of women viewers. At age 29 on September 17, 1960 he put his vision into reality with ABC's first NCAA college football broadcast from Birmingham, Alabama, between Alabama Crimson Tide and the Georgia Bulldogs won by Alabama, 21-6\\\\. That same year, ABC began broadcasting games in the fledgling American Football League and used the same innovative techniques in their broadcasts. Sports broadcasting has not been the same since. =Earliest coverage of the National Football League= In 1948 and 1950, ABC televised the National Football League Championship Game. Harry Wismer provided commentary for the game in 1948 game and the game in 1955 joined by Red Grange and Joe Hasel. Since the game was played in Los Angeles, there was no network telecast of the 1951 NFL Championship Game because at that time there was no way to send live TV programs from the West Coast to the East Coast and vice versa. ABC first broadcast regular season National Football League games in 1953. At the time, they only broadcast Chicago Bears home games and Chicago Cardinals home games. Beginning in 1954, ABC added Washington Redskins home games. In ABC's final year of their initial go around with the National Football League, they added Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers games (for the Pacific Time Zone affiliates) to go along with their coverage of the Bears and Cardinals. Wire accounts found in newspaperarchive.com indicated that the Washington-Philadelphia game in Week 2 of the 1953 season, was to have been regionally televised by ABC, but the cables needed for the telecast never arrived. The articles said that NFL Commissioner Bert Bell was \\"fuming\\" over the incident. ABC's relationship with the NFL at this point pretty much ended when CBS began carrying regular season games across its network nationwide in 1956. This came off the heels of the NFL's previous principal network TV partner, the DuMont Network suspending its operations. Less than five years later however, ABC became the initial network television partner for the American Football League. The deal called for ABC to broadcast approximately 37 regular season games, the AFL Championship Game and the AFL All-Star Game. These games were typically broadcast regionally on 15 consecutive Sundays and on Thanksgiving Day. This became the first ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs; the National Football League would follow suit in 1961, a move that required Congress to pass the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 to accommodate such collective broadcasting contracts. =Creating the Major League Baseball Game of the Week= In , Scherick broached a Saturday Game of the Week, TV sport's first network series. At the time, ABC was labeled a \\"nothing network\\" that had fewer outlets than CBS or NBC. ABC also needed paid programming or \\"anything for bills\\" as Scherick put it. At first, ABC hesitated at the idea of a nationally televised regular season baseball program. ABC wondered how exactly the Game of the Week would reach television in the first place and who would notice if it did? Also, Major League Baseball barred the Game of the Week from airing within 50 miles of any ballpark. Major League Baseball according to Scherick, insisted on protecting local coverage and didn't care about national appeal. ABC, though, did care about the national appeal and claimed that \\"most of America was still up for grabs.\\" In April 1953, Edgar Scherick set out to sell teams rights but instead, only got the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox to sign on. These were not \\"national\\" broadcast contracts since they were assembled through negotiations with individual teams to telecast games from their home parks. It was until the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, that antitrust laws barred \\"pooled rights\\" TV contracts negotiated with a central league broadcasting authority. In , ABC earned an 11.4 rating for their Game of the Week telecasts. Blacked-out cities had 32% of households. In the rest of the United States, 3 in 4 TV sets in use watched Dizzy Dean and Buddy Blattner (or backup announcers Bill McColgan and Bob Finnegan) call the games for ABC. CBS took over the Saturday Game in 1955 (the rights were actually set up through the Falstaff Brewing Corporation) retaining Dean/Blattner and McColgan/Finnegan as the announcing crews (as well as Gene Kirby, who produced the Dean/Blattner games and alternated with them on play-by-play) and adding Sunday coverage in . As Edgar Scherick said, \\"In '53, no one wanted us. Now teams begged for \\"Game\\"'s cash.\\" In , ABC broadcast the best-of-three playoff series (to decide the National League pennant) between the Milwaukee Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers. The cigarette company L&M; was in charge of all of the telecasts. George Kell and Bob DeLaney were the announcers. 1960s =Becoming ABC Sports and the birth of Wide World of Sports= In February 1960, Scherick sold Sports Programs to the American Broadcasting Company for $500,000 in ABC stock, where it became ABC Sports, the sports division of the network. With the acquisition, Scherick was appointed head of the ABC Sports division, then Vice President in charge of Network Sales. Despite the production values he brought to NCAA college football, Scherick wanted low-budget (as in inexpensive broadcasting rights) sports programming that could attract and retain an audience. He hit upon the idea of broadcasting track and field events sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union. While Americans were not exactly fans of track and field events, Scherick figured Americans understood games. So in January 1961, Scherick called Arledge into his office, and asked him to attend the annual AAU board of governors meeting. While he was shaking hands, Scherick said, if the mood seemed right, might he cut a deal to broadcast AAU events on ABC? It seemed a tall assignment, but as Scherick said years later, \\"Roone was a gentile and I was not.\\" Arledge came back with a deal for ABC to broadcast all AAU events for $50,000 a year. Next, Scherick and Arledge divided up their NCAA college football sponsor list. They then telephoned their sponsors and said in so many words, \\"Advertise on our new sports show coming up in April, or forget about buying commercials on NCAA college football this fall.\\" The two persuaded enough sponsors to advertise, though it took them to the last day of a deadline imposed by ABC programming to do it. Wide World of Sports suited Scherick's plans exactly. By exploiting the speed of jet transportation and flexibility of videotape, Scherick was able to undercut NBC and CBS's advantages in broadcasting live sporting events. In that era, with communications nowhere near as universal as they are today, ABC was able to safely record events on videotape for later broadcast without worrying about an audience finding out the results. Arledge, his colleague Chuck Howard, and Jim McKay (who left CBS for this opportunity) made up the show on a week-by- week basis the first year it was broadcast. Arledge had a genius for the dramatic story line that unfolded in the course of a game or event. McKay's honest curiosity and reporter's bluntness gave the show an emotional appeal which attracted viewers who might not otherwise watch a sporting event. But more importantly from Arledge's perspective, Wide World of Sports allowed him to demonstrate his ability as an administrator as well as producer. Arledge did not gain a formal title as president of ABC Sports until 1968, even though Scherick left his position to assume a position of vice president for programming at ABC in 1964. During its initial season in the spring and summer of 1961, Wide World of Sports was initially broadcast from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturdays. Beginning in 1962, it was pushed to 5 to 6:30 pm, and later to 4:30 to 6 pm. Eastern Time to allow ABC affiliates in the Eastern and Central Time Zones to carry local early-evening newscasts. =Broadcasting the American Football League and MLB (again)= On June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with ABC, which brought in revenues of approximately $2,125,000 per year for the entire league. The deal called for ABC to broadcast approximately 37 regular season games, the AFL Championship Game and the AFL All-Star Game. These games were typically broadcast regionally on 15 consecutive Sundays and on Thanksgiving Day. This became the first ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs; the National Football League would follow suit in 1961, a move that required Congress to pass the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 to accommodate such collective broadcasting contracts. ABC would broadcast AFL games from the league's very first season in 1960 until the 1964 season, when NBC took over as the league's primary network television broadcaster. Also in , ABC returned to baseball broadcasting with a series of late-afternoon Saturday games. Jack Buck and Carl Erskine were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season. ABC typically did three games a week. Two of the games were always from the Eastern or Central Time Zone. The late games (no doubleheaders) were usually San Francisco Giants or Los Angeles Dodgers' home games. However, the Milwaukee Braves used to start many of their Saturday home games late in the afternoon. So if the Giants and Dodgers were both the road at the same time, ABC still would be able to show a late game. In , ABC provided the first-ever nationwide baseball coverage with weekly Saturday broadcasts on a regional basis. ABC paid $5.7 million for the rights to the 28 Saturday/holiday Games of the Week. ABC's deal covered all of the teams except the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies (who had their own television deals) and called for two regionalized games on Saturdays, Independence Day, and Labor Day. Each Saturday, ABC broadcast two 2 p.m. games and one 5 p.m. game for the Pacific Time Zone. ABC blacked out the games in the home cities of the clubs playing those games. Major League Baseball however, had a TV deal with NBC for the All-Star Game and World Series. At the end of the season, ABC declined to exercise its $6.5 million option for , citing poor ratings, especially in New York. According to ABC announcer Merle Harmon's profile in Curt Smith's book Voices of Summer, in , CBS' Yankee Game of the Week beat ABC in the ratings in at least Dallas and Des Moines. To make matters worse, local television split the big-city audience. Therefore, ABC could show the Cubs vs. the Cardinals in the New York market, yet the Mets would still kill them in terms of viewership. Harmon, Chris Schenkel, Keith Jackson, and (on occasion) Ken Coleman served as ABC's principal play-by-play voices for this series. Also on the network's announcing team were pregame host Howard Cosell and color commentators Leo Durocher, Tommy Henrich, Warren Spahn (who worked with Chris Schenkel on a July 17 Baltimore-Detroit contest), and Hall of Fame Brooklyn Dodger great Jackie Robinson (who, on April 17, 1965, became the first black network broadcaster for Major League Baseball). According to ABC Sports producer Chuck Howard, \\"(Robinson) had a high, stabbing voice, great presence, and sharp mind. All he lacked was time.\\" =Early forays with college basketball= ABC first broadcast college basketball games in 1962, when the network aired the NCAA Championship Game on a day-behind delayed basis, as part of its Wide World of Sports anthology series. On December 15, 1973, ABC aired what is considered to be the first telecast of a regular season college basketball game by a major broadcast network (between UCLA and North Carolina State in St. Louis). ABC (which had recently lost the NBA rights to CBS) televised this game using its former NBA announcing crew of Keith Jackson and Bill Russell. In the 1977‚Äì78 season, C.D. Chesley (who controlled the rights to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) at the time) wanted NBC to televise select ACC games as part of its national package as it had done the previous few years. However, NBC wanted to feature intersectional games. This action greatly upset Chesley, who wound up selling the rights to the ACC Tournament final to ABC. ABC would televise the 1978 ACC Tournament final as part of Wide World of Sports. The game, called by Jim Lampley and Bill Russell, marked the first time Duke University's Blue Devils basketball team played on national television. =The debut of the Pro Bowlers Tour= Prior to the debut of the PBA on ABC television in 1962, most tournaments were organized where, once the cut was established after qualifying rounds, a set number of match-play games were bowled, and bonus pins were given to the winner of each match. The champion was then decided based on the final overall total pinfall. From 1962 to 1965, ABC started televising the PBA Tour, starting with a limited number of tournaments on ABC's Wide World of Sports, and later having its own timeslot. Therefore, a round-robin tournament format was implemented to determine the champion. The televised finals would be cut to the top four bowlers after match-play, and then three round-robin matches between the fourth, third and second-seeded bowlers would determine the final two bowlers. If any bowler were to win both of his matches in the round-robin, he would go on to face the tournament leader. If the three bowlers each split their matches to go 1 and 1 in the round-robin, total pinfall would decide which man would advance to the final match to face the tournament leader. The winner of the final match would win the tournament. The first-ever telecast was actually taped and aired at a later date. The original commentators were Chris Schenkel and bowling star Billy Welu. On May 16, 1974 Welu died suddenly of a heart attack. The search for his replacement included bowling legends Dick Weber and Dave Davis, but it was the young Nelson Burton Jr. who was ultimately selected for the analyst job in 1975. He remained Schenkel's broadcasting partner until the end of the series. =ABC's original coverage of the NBA= Meanwhile, ABC first signed a deal with the National Basketball Association to become the league's primary television partner in 1964; the network's first game telecast aired on January 3, 1965 (a game between the Boston Celtics and Cincinnati Royals).Source: ABC ad for NBA game in Chicago Tribune (January 3, 1965) ABC's initial alliance with the NBA first came about due to ABC Sports head Roone Arledge's search for live programming that could diminish the ratings of CBS Sports Spectacular, and ABC's own analogy program, Wide World of Sports a boost with sponsors. ABC initially paid the NBA only $650,000 for the rights annually. For much of the 1960s, ABC only televised Sunday afternoon games, including during the NBA Playoffs. This meant that ABC did not have to televise a potential NBA Finals deciding game if it were played on a weeknight. In 1969, ABC did televise Game 7 of the Los Angeles Lakers‚ÄìBoston Celtics series in prime time on a weeknight. The following season, ABC aired the 1970 NBA Finals in its entirety, making it the first Finals series to have all games televised nationally. By 1969, ABC's NBA contract worth only $3 million. To put things into proper perspective, in 1969, Major League Baseball's television contract with NBC was worth $16.5 million while the National Football League cost CBS about $22 million. What that meant is that ABC had made a bargain in purchasing the television rights to the NBA, considering the league's steady ratings. To give you a better idea, ABC's ratings for the NBA rose from a 6.0 in 1965 to an 8.2 in 1968. ABC was by this time, coming increasingly under fire for what perceived to be a less than spectacular presentation of the NBA. Sports Illustrateds Frank Deford in particular, singled ABC out for their coverage of the 1971 NBA Finals. Deford felt that ABC was making a mistake in trying to cover the NBA the same way that they covered a football game, because they were two different games. On that end, Deford wrote that neither ABC's announcers nor cameras were able to isolate the important phases of the game. He added that replays were used only to second-guess officials rather than \\"capture the grace and precision of the performers\\". Meanwhile, Deford also criticized play-by-play man Chris Schenkel his failure to appreciate the nuances of the game and their halftime shows, which Deford saw not innovative or imaginative. ABC lost the broadcast rights to the NBA to CBS after the 1972‚Äì73 season, with the network's initial tenure with the league ending with its last NBA Finals game on May 10, 1973. ABC filled the void left by losing the NBA by counterprogramming Wide World of Sports on Sundays against CBS' NBA coverage. =The premiere of The American Sportsman= The show has its roots in a 20-minute segment depicting Curt Gowdy and Joe Brooks fly fishing in the Andes Mountains in Argentina in 1964. The segment appeared on Wide World of Sports and immediately was spun off into its own series airing at 3 PM EST on Sundays January through March on ABC.How The American Sportsman was Born The show's first episode was on January 31, 1965 and ran through 1986.http://www.tv.com/the-american- sportsman/show/23116/summary.html ABC would present filmed highlights involving the program's hosts and celebrities participating in hunting and/or fishing trips along with outdoor recreational activities such as whitewater kayaking, hang gliding and free climbing. =Winning the NCAA football contract= ABC won the NCAA contract from the 1966 season onwards. This was essentially the television plan that stayed in place until the University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in 1981, alleging antitrust violations. The lawsuit, NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, made it all the way to the Supreme Court, who in 1984 ruled in favor of Oklahoma and Georgia and declared the NCAA's forced collective contract a violation of antitrust law. ABC then negotiated with the College Football Association for its game package. ABC announced the entire 1966 TV schedule in June with 8 national games and 24 regional games for a total of 15 broadcast windows. In 1966, the NCAA allowed each school to appear on ABC for at most one national telecast and one regional telecast. On November 19, 1966, ABC showed a regional doubleheader. The main early game was Notre Dame-Michigan State (ranked 1 and 2). This was the famous 10‚Äì10 tie. ABC was unable to televise this game live nationally due to the above restriction. However, ABC got approval from the NCAA to show this game on tape delay in the late timeslot in the regions of the country which got Kentucky-Tennessee in the early timeslot. On September 23, 1967, Chris Schenkel and Bud Wilkinson were scheduled to announce the Penn State-Navy game. However, there was an NABET strike of engineers and technicians which AFTRA was supporting and this duo (members of AFTRA) refused to work the game. So ABC Sports producer Chuck Howard did play-by-play on this game. Howard lined up Jim Tarman (Penn State's SID) and Bud Thalman (Navy's SID) to provide color commentary. =The beginning of ABC's two decade relationship with the Olympics= While CBS aired both the 1960 Winter and Summer Games (marking the first time that the Olympics were broadcast on American television), by 1964, a different network showed the Winter Games: ABC. Roone Arledge won broadcast rights for his network and began a relationship with the \\"five rings\\" that would last over two decades. The program used many of the same production staff from ABC's Wide World of Sports, as well as the same host, Jim McKay, who moved to ABC from CBS in 1961. In 1968, ABC showed both the Winter Games and the Summer Games. The 1964 Winter Games were in Innsbruck, Austria, and coverage was taped and flown by plane back to the United States. All of it was in black- and-white, but with most Winter Olympic events in the morning (local time), most TV coverage aired the day the events were held. A portion of the Closing Ceremony was televised live via satellite (Telstar, which had to be tracked and allowed about a 15-minute window between the U.S. and Europe when it was zooming over the Atlantic). Everything else was videotaped and flown to the U.S. via a Munich-London-New York route. There was little margin for error. If a flight was canceled, ABC had a tape of a U.S.-Romania hockey game, played the day before the Opening Ceremony and shipped over, ready to play. All went well and it never made the air. ABC aired 16.5 hours of coverage of the Innsbruck Games, the majority of the coverage occurring outside of primetime. By 1968, ABC was broadcasting the Olympics in full color, and satellites made possible live coverage of several events at the Winter Games in Grenoble, France and of nearly all of the network's coverage of the Summer Games in Mexico City. In reality, only the Opening Ceremony and the ladies figure skating final were televised live via satellite; most other coverage was satellited to ABC and run off tape from New York. The 1968 Winter Olympics were the first to be televised in color (except for a couple of events the French fed in black-and-white). Highlighting the 1968 Winter Games was a dramatic sweep in men's alpine skiing by Frenchman Jean-Claude Killy, while the major highlight of the Summer Games was a world-record long jump by Bob Beamon of the United States, which happened to air live in the US. 1970s =The birth of Monday Night Football= During the early 1960s, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle envisioned the possibility of playing at least one game weekly during prime time that could be viewed by a greater television audience (while the NFL had scheduled Saturday night games on the DuMont Television Network in 1953 and 1954, poor ratings and the dissolution of DuMont led to those games being eliminated by the time CBS took over the rights in 1956). An early bid by the league in 1964 to play on Friday nights was soundly defeated, with critics charging that such telecasts would damage the attendance at high school football games. Undaunted, Rozelle decided to experiment with the concept of playing on Monday night, scheduling the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions for a game on September 28, 1964. While the game was not televised, it drew a sellout crowd of 59,203 spectators to Tiger Stadium, the largest crowd ever to watch a professional football game in Detroit up to that point. Two years later, Rozelle would build on this success as the NFL began a four-year experiment of playing on Monday night, scheduling one game in prime time on CBS during the 1966 and 1967 seasons, and two contests during each of the next two years. NBC followed suit in 1968 and 1969 with games involving American Football League teams. During subsequent negotiations on a new television contract that would begin in 1970 (coinciding with a merger between the NFL and AFL), Rozelle concentrated on signing a weekly Monday night deal with one of the three major networks. After sensing reluctance from both NBC and CBS in disturbing their regular programming schedules, Rozelle spoke with ABC. Despite the network's status at the time as the lowest-rated of the three major broadcast networks, ABC was also reluctant to enter the risky venture. It was only after Rozelle used the threat of signing a deal with the independent Hughes Sports Network, an entity bankrolled by reclusive businessman Howard Hughes, did ABC sign a contract for the scheduled games. Speculation was that had Rozelle signed with Hughes, many ABC affiliates would have pre-empted the network's Monday lineup in favor of the games, severely damaging potential ratings. After the final contract for Monday Night Football was signed, ABC Sports producer Roone Arledge immediately saw possibilities for the new program. Setting out to create an entertainment \\"spectacle\\" as much as a simple sports broadcast, Arledge hired Chet Forte, who would serve as director of the program for over 22 years. Arledge also ordered twice the usual number of cameras to cover the game, expanded the regular two-man broadcasting booth to three, and used extensive graphic design within the show as well as instant replay. Looking for a lightning rod to garner attention, Arledge hired controversial New York City sportscaster Howard Cosell as a commentator, along with veteran football play- by-play announcer Keith Jackson. Arledge had tried to draw in Curt Gowdy and then Vin Scully to ABC for the MNF play-by-play role, but settled for Jackson after they proved unable to break their respective existing contracts with NBC Sports and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Jack Buck was also considered, but when Arledge assistant Chuck Howard telephoned Buck with the job offer, Buck refused to respond due to anger at his treatment by ABC during an earlier stint with the network. Arledge's original choice for the third member of the trio, Frank Gifford, was unavailable since he was still under contract to CBS Sports. However, Gifford suggested former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Don Meredith, setting the stage for years of fireworks between the often-pompous Cosell and the laid-back Meredith. Monday Night Football first aired on ABC on September 21, 1970, with a game between the New York Jets and the Browns in Cleveland. Advertisers were charged US$65,000 per minute by ABC during the clash, a cost that proved to be a bargain when the contest collected 33% of the viewing audience. The Browns defeated the Jets, 31‚Äì21 in a game which featured a 94-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by the Browns' Homer Jones to open the second half, and was punctuated when Billy Andrews intercepted Joe Namath late in the fourth quarter and returned it 25 yards for the clinching touchdown. However, Cleveland viewers saw different programming on WEWS-TV, because of the NFL's blackout rules of the time (this would apply for all games through the end of the 1972 season; beginning in 1973, home games could be televised if tickets were sold out 72 hours before kickoff). In 1971, Frank Gifford became available after his contract with CBS Sports concluded; Arledge brought him to ABC to serve as play-by-play announcer, replacing Jackson (who returned to broadcasting college football for the network, which he continued to do for the next 35 seasons). The former New York Giant had been an NFL analyst for CBS during the 1960s but had never called play-by-play prior to joining Monday Night Football. In that capacity for Monday Night Football from 1971 to 1985, Gifford was often criticized for his see-no-evil approach in regard to discussing the NFL, earning him the dubious nickname \\"Faultless Frank.\\" Regardless, Gifford would have the longest tenure of any broadcaster on the show, lasting until 1998. =Coverage of the 1972 Munich massacre= In 1972, NBC showed the Winter Games from Sapporo, Japan, then ABC returned to carry the Summer Games in Munich, Germany. It was during the Summer Games that Palestinian terrorists attacked the Olympic Village and killed 11 Israeli athletes. Although Chris Schenkel was the actual host of the Games that year, Arledge assigned the story to McKay largely because he was a local news anchor in Baltimore, Maryland prior to joining CBS (and later ABC). McKay was joined on set by ABC news correspondent (and former and future evening news anchor) Peter Jennings, and coverage continued for many hours, until the outcome was known. Howard Cosell went with the film crew to get interviews in the village. McKay later won an Emmy Award for his coverage. By the time the 1976 edition of the Winter Games came around, McKay was now installed at the host, a role he would play throughout the 1970s and '80s. =ABC's coverage of NASCAR and the Daytona 500= From 1962 to 1978, the Daytona 500 was shown on ABC's Wide World of Sports. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the race was filmed and an edited highlight package aired the following weekend. In 1974, ABC began the first semi-live coverage (joined-in-progress) of the Daytona 500. Coverage was normally timed to begin when the race was halfway over. Brief taped highlights of the start and early segments were shown, then ABC joined the race live already in progress, picking up approximately the last 90 minutes of the race. This format continued through 1978. The 1976 race was held on the same day of the final day of competition in the Winter Olympics (also broadcast on ABC). ABC carried 30 minutes of live coverage of the start of the race, then switched to the Olympics for 90 minutes to carry taped coverage of the final two competitive events (a cross-country ski race and the final runs in the bobsled), held earlier that day. Then it was back to Daytona for about an hour-and-a-half for the finish. ESPN began showing NASCAR races in 1981, with the first event being at North Carolina Speedway. The last of its 265 Cup telecasts (that number includes some on ABC Sports) was the 2000 Atlanta fall race (now the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500). =ABC launches Monday Night Baseball= In , ABC picked up the television rights for Monday Night Baseball games from NBC. For most of its time on ABC, the Monday night games were held on \\"dead travel days\\" when few games were scheduled. The team owners liked that arrangement as the national telecasts didn't compete against their stadium box offices. ABC on the other hand, found the arrangement far more complicated. ABC often had only one or two games to pick from for each telecast from a schedule designed by Major League Baseball. While trying to give all of the teams national exposure, ABC ended up with far too many games between sub .500 clubs from small markets. Reviewing the network's first two weeks of coverage for Sports Illustrated, William Leggett opined: \\"It may be unfair to say that Monday Night Baseball, as it has been presented by ABC so far this season, is the worst television treatment ever given a major sport, because by all odds somebody at sometime must have done something worse. But it is difficult to remember when or where that might have happened.\\" Just like with Monday Night Football, ABC brought in the concept of the three-man-booth (originally with Bob Prince, Bob Uecker, and Warner Wolf as the primary crew) to their baseball telecasts. Said ABC Sports head Roone Arledge \\"It'll take something different for it to work - i.e. curb viewership yawns and lulls with Uecker as the real difference\\", so Arledge reportedly hoped. Prince disclosed to his broadcasting partner Jim Woods about his early worries about calling a network series for the first time. Prince for one, didn't have as much creative control over the broadcasts on ABC as he did calling Pittsburgh Pirates games on KDKA radio. ABC's coverage for such things as its camera work (they often followed fly balls like they did golf shots, keeping the focus on the ball) and its choice of announcers: Bob Prince was accused of a National League bias, while Bob Uecker was considered to be just a Don Meredith clone. Bob Prince was gone by the fall of 1976, with Keith Jackson, Howard Cosell, and guest analyst Reggie Jackson calling that year's American League Championship Series. (Warner Wolf, Al Michaels and guest analyst Tom Seaver worked the NLCS.) On the subject of his dismissal from ABC, Bob Prince said \\"I hated Houston, and ABC never let me be Bob Prince.\\" MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn strongly objected to ABC's recruitment of Howard Cosell because of comments by Cosell in recent years about how dull baseball had become. But Roone Arledge held the trump card as the contract he had signed with Major League Baseball gave ABC the final say over announcers. So Cosell worked the 1976 ALCS and became a regular member of Monday Night Baseball the next season. In , the start of ABC's Monday Night Baseball coverage was moved back to June, due to poor ratings during the May sweeps period. In place of April and May prime time games, ABC began airing Sunday Afternoon Baseball games in September. The network also aired one Friday night game (Yankees at Angels) on July 13 of that year. =Coverage of the North American Soccer League and the FIFA World Cup= In 1979, ABC Sports began covering the NASL in a deal that called for 9 telecasts of league games, including the playoffs and Soccer Bowl. After enduring briefly during the late 1970s, attendances dropped after 1980. The sport's popularity fell and the media lost interest. The deal with ABC to broadcast NASL matches was also lost in 1980, and the 1981 Soccer Bowl was only shown on tape delay. All of the franchises quickly became unprofitable, and a salary cap enforced before the 1984 season only delayed the inevitable. In 1982, PBS and ESPN provided the first thorough American television coverage of the FIFA World Cup. ABC aired the first live telecast of the final. ABC aired commercials during the live action. Meanwhile, PBS aired same day highlights of the top game of the day. 1980s =The Miracle on Ice= The 1980 Winter Olympics was the setting for the \\"Miracle on Ice\\", a medal-round men's ice hockey game in Lake Placid, New York, on February 22. The United States team, made up of amateur and collegiate players and led by coach Herb Brooks, defeated the Soviet team, which consisted of veteran professional players with significant experience in international play. The rest of the United States (except those who watched the game live on Canadian television) had to wait to see the game, as ABC decided to broadcast the late- afternoon game on tape delay in prime time.\\"College kids perform Olympic miracle\\", ESPN.com Sportscaster Al Michaels, who was calling the game on ABC along with former Montreal Canadiens goalie Ken Dryden, picked up on the countdown in his broadcast, and delivered his famous call: During the broadcast wrap-up after the game, ABC Olympic sports anchor Jim McKay compared the American victory over the Soviet professionals to a group of Canadian college football players defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers (the recent Super Bowl champions and at the height of their dynasty). =Breaking the news of John Lennon's murder= On the evening of December 8, 1980, English musician John Lennon, formerly of the Beatles, was fatally shot in the archway of the Dakota, his residence in New York City. When Roone Arledge, who was presiding over ABC's telecast of Monday Night Football in his capacity as its executive producer, received word of Lennon's death, a game between the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins was tied with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots were driving toward the potential winning score. As the Patriots tried to put themselves in position for a field goal, Arledge informed Frank Gifford and Howard Cosell of the shooting and suggested that they be the ones to report on the murder. Cosell, who had interviewed Lennon during a Monday Night Football broadcast in 1974, was chosen to do so but was apprehensive of it at first, as he felt the game should take precedence and that it was not their place to break such a big story. Gifford convinced Cosell otherwise, saying that he should not \\"hang on to (the news)\\" as the significance of the event was much greater than the finish of the game. The following exchange began with thirty seconds left in the fourth quarter, shortly after Gifford and Cosell had been informed of what had transpired: =Sports journalism and ABC SportsBeat magazine show= In the fall of 1981, Cosell debuted a serious investigative 30-minute magazine show, ABC SportsBeat on ABC's weekend schedule. He made news and covered topics that were not part of general sports coverage - including the first story about drugs in professional sports (the story of former Minnesota Viking Carl Eller's cocaine use), an in-depth look at how NFL owners negotiated tax breaks and incentives for building new stadiums, and together with Arthur Ashe, an investigation into apartheid and sports. Though ratings were low, Cosell and his staff earned three Emmy Awards for excellence in reporting, and broke new ground in sports journalism. At the time, ABC SportsBeat was the first and only regularly scheduled network program devoted solely to sports journalism. To produce this pioneering program, Cosell recruited a number of employees from outside the ranks of those that produced games, who he felt might be too invested in the success of the athletes and leagues to look at the hard news. He brought in Michael Marley, then a sportswriter for The Washington Post, Lawrie Mifflin, a writer for The New York Times, and a 20-year old researcher who quickly rose to an associate producer, Alexis Denny. As a sophomore at Yale University, Ms. Denny had been a student in a seminar that Cosell taught on the \\"Business of Big-Time Sports in America\\", and was selected by the Director of Monday Night Football to join their production crew. She took her junior year off to join Cosell's staff at ABC Headquarters in New York City, and produced many segments, including in 1983 a half-hour special report previewing the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Despite the games being one of ABC's biggest investments, with a record-breaking 225 million dollar rights fee at the time, the 30-minute documentary-style program produced by Denny showed many sides of the questions about the viability of the Games themselves - from concerns about traffic, pollution and terrorism, to a look at how the sponsorship deals were structured. =ABC's coverage of golf= ABC broadcast golf events for the first time in 1962 when it began televising the Open Championship as part of its anthology series Wide World of Sports. The network later gained the broadcast rights to the PGA Championship in 1965, and the U.S. Open in 1966. Chris Schenkel and Byron Nelson were the initial hosts of the tournament coverage. In 1975, Jim McKay and Dave Marr became the lead broadcast team, while Bob Rosburg joined the network as the first ever on- course reporter, and Peter Alliss joined as a co-anchor. Beginning in 1982, ABC adopted its most well-known format of the Wide World of Sports era. The broadcast operated using anchor teams, in which an anchor and an analyst would call all of the action from the tower at the 18th hole, and the teams would be rotated on coverage after about a half-hour. Meanwhile, the three on-course reporters, which included Judy Rankin and Ed Sneed in addition to Rosburg, would be utilized when prompted by the anchor team. McKay and Marr would be the lead team, with Jack Whitaker and Alliss as the second team. Occasionally, Rosburg or Whitaker would host if McKay was unavailable, while Roger Twibell would take over the secondary team. After his 1986 Masters win, Jack Nicklaus would appear on ABC after the end of his round and served as an analyst for the rest of the telecast. =ABC's stint with the USFL= On Sunday, March 6, 1983 ABC televised three games. The Los Angeles Express and New Jersey GeneralsABC coverage of the USFL begins today with Herschel played in the primary regional televised USFL game, with the Express winning, 20‚Äì15. ABC also televised the Chicago Blitz at Washington Federals and the Philadelphia Stars at Denver Gold. According to an ABC spokesman, the network averaged a 6.0 ratingThe key to survival was winning television money. At first the new league had modest success, starting with $18 million from ABC and an additional $8 million from ESPN cable. But U.S.F.L. fans never showed up in force. The average game attendance dropped by 3,000 last season, to 27,000. More ominous, TV ratings fell almost 30%. By the end of its third season, the league had dwindled to eight clubs, with total losses of around $200 million. for their first USFL season. This was slightly better than the network's coverage of the first American Football League football season back in 1960. In its second year, AFL games on ABC averaged a 6.1 rating, and in 1962, the third year, a 6.5. The coverage was nonetheless quite low for a Big Three television network, with a June 17 prime-time regular season game between Chicago and Birmingham finishing as the lowest-rated prime time broadcast of the week, with a 4.8 rating.As for the ratings, the two semifinal playoff games drew a so-so 5.0 and 5.9, and the championship pulled overnights of 7.4 in New York, 8.7 in Chicago and 9.9 in Los Angeles, disappointing for prime time. On Black Friday, June 17, ABC aired a prime-time game between Chicago and Birmingham. It finished 72nd out of 72 shows that week with a rating of 4.8, the worst prime-time number of the year. Some advertisers who bought time this season seem skittish about reenlisting. ABC offered the USFL a 4-year, $175 million TV deal to play in the spring in 1986. By this point, the league had driven out most of the owners who would have been willing to accept those terms. The owners in the league walked away from what averaged out to $67 million per year starting in 1986 to pursue their big picture‚Äîmerger with the NFL. =The deregulation of college football on television begins= In June 1984, a US Supreme Court ruling ended the control that the NCAA had exercised on televised college football and allowed individual colleges to make their own TV deals. CBS obtained rights to Big 10 and Pac 10 home games while ABC obtained rights to the College Football Association (essentially home games for all schools other than the B10 and P10). CBS also separately obtained rights to Boston College-Miami and Army-Navy. CBS and ABC typically carried only 1-2 games per time slot rather than the frequent large slates of regional games in prior years. Meanwhile, ESPN carried live CFA games each Saturday typically at noon and 7:30 p.m. WTBS carried SEC games. USA Network also carried games (primarily the Big 8). =The end of Howard Cosell's tenure on Monday Night Football and later ABC= Cosell continued to draw criticism during Monday Night Football with one of his offhand comments during the September 5, 1983 game, igniting a controversy and laying the groundwork for his departure at the end of that season. In a game between the Washington Redskins and Dallas Cowboys, Cosell referred to Alvin Garrett, an African American wide receiver for the Redskins, as a \\"little monkey.\\" Cosell noted that Garrett's small stature, and not his race, was the basis for his comment, citing the fact that he had used the term to describe his grandchildren. Later, a special on Howard Cosell showed him calling Mike Adamle (a white player) a \\"little monkey.\\" Stung by the unrelenting barrage of remarks, Cosell claimed upon his departure from Monday Night Football that the NFL had become \\"a stagnant bore.\\" In Cosell's book, I Never Played the Game, he devoted an entire chapter (\\"Monkey Business\\") to the Garrett episode. In the book, Cosell also said that ABC should have had the right to choose its own Monday Night schedule. In his mind, Monday Night Football is what elevated the NFL in popularity over Major League Baseball. He felt that this should have been ABC's reward for raising the league's profile. After Cosell's memoir I Never Played the Game, which, among other things, chronicled his disenchantment with fellow ABC commentators, was published in September 1985, Cosell was taken off scheduled announcing duties for that year's World Series and was dismissed by ABC television shortly thereafter. Cosell's book was seen by many as a bitter \\"hate rant\\" against those who had offended him. TV Guide published excerpts of his memoirs and reported that they had never had as many viewers' responses and they were overwhelmingly negative towards Cosell. The magazine reported some of the \\"printable\\" ones saying things such as \\"Will Rogers never met Howard Cosell\\". In I Never Played the Game, Cosell popularized the word \\"jockocracy\\" (originally coined by author Robert Lipsyte), describing how athletes were given announcing jobs that they had not earned. Coincidentally, he was replaced for the 1985 World Series broadcast by Tim McCarver, himself a former baseball player, to join Al Michaels and Jim Palmer. (The title of the book is a double entendre, meaning that Cosell never actually played the game of football or any other professional sport he broadcast as well as implying that he never played the \\"game\\" of corporate politics.) Cosell is notably absent from the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Missing: Howard Cosell has still not won Pro Football Hall of Fame's Rozelle Award =ABC airs its very first Super Bowl= As a result of the 1982 television contract signed by the NFL with the three networks, this game was the first Super Bowl to be televised in the United States by ABC, as they earned their first turn at the Super Bowl, with a new alternation process started for the 1983 game. Previously, the Super Bowl telecast alternated between CBS and NBC, while the networks simulcast the first AFL-NFL World Championship Game. Frank Gifford was the play-by-play announcer, while then-ABC Sports analyst Don Meredith and then-Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann served as color commentators. Al Michaels and Jim Lampley hosted the pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame (Lampley presided over the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremony) coverage for ABC. Michaels and Lampley were joined by analysts O. J. Simpson (who would normally have been the second color commentator; when interviewed as to why Theismann would join Gifford and Meredith in the booth instead of Simpson; director Chet Forte was quoted in the January 14, 1985 edition of Broadcasting Magazine as saying that Theismann could contribute more due to having played both teams in the regular-season as well as having played in the two previous Super Bowls.) and Tom Landry (in a separate booth during the game). Also helping out with ABC's coverage were Jack Whitaker, Dick Schaap, Donna de Varona, Ray Gandolf, and ABC News reporters Stone Phillips, Jeff Greenfield, Judd Rose, and Bill Redeker. This would be the only ABC Super Bowl for Gifford as play-by-play announcer, the final game for Don Meredith and the second (and last) time a commentator for the Super Bowl (Theismann) was an active player (Jack Kemp in Super Bowl II was the only other active player to provide commentary). Michaels would call ABC's next six Super Bowls, until the network lost their NFL rights in 2006. =ABC airs the Indianapolis 500 live for the first time= From 1965 to 1970, ABC televised a combination of filmed and/or taped recorded highlights of the race the following weekend on Wide World of Sports. The 1965 and 1966 presentations were in black-and-white, while all subsequent presentations have been in color. From 1971 to 1985, the Indianapolis 500 was shown on a same-day tape delay basis. Races were edited down to a between two and three hour broadcast, and shown in prime time. It was also blacked out in the Indianapolis market until a later date. The broadcasts would typically open with the rendition of \\"Back Home Again in Indiana\\", and the starting command, but no other pre-race ceremonies. In addition, the broadcast was supplemented with some pre-recorded, in-depth featurettes, aired during down times. Later telecasts included live introductions at the top and bottom of the broadcast, with the closing segment sometimes an interview with the race winner, which by that time, had been revealed to the viewers. During this period, the announcers' commentary at both the start and finish of the race were recorded as those events transpired. However, the commentary of the middle parts of the race was semi- scripted, and recorded in post-production, and edited into the broadcast as it was being aired. Starting in 1986, the race has been shown live in \\"flag-to- flag\\" coverage. In the Indianapolis market, as well as other parts of Indiana, the live telecast is blacked out and shown tape delayed to encourage live attendance. On March 21, 2018, NBC Sports announced that it had acquired the television rights to the IndyCar Series (after previously serving as cable rightsholder through NBCSN or CNBC for races not aired by ABC), replacing the package of races on ABC with a package of eight races on NBC, including the Indianapolis 500 (ending ABC's 54-year tenure as broadcaster of the event). ABC's final IndyCar telecast was the second race of the Detroit Grand Prix on June 3, 2018. =ABC finally centralizes the Triple Crown of thoroughbred racing= In 1977, ABC was awarded the contract to televise the Preakness. Triple Crown Productions was formed in 1985 after CBS terminated its contract with NYRA. ABC Sports won the rights to broadcast all three races, as well as many prep races. Ratings went up after the package was centralized. Other than the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes were considered the two \\"other\\" races. ABC Sports, which had broadcast the Derby since 1975, wanted to televise all the races as a three race package. CBS Sports, which showed the other two races, had much lower ratings for them, with the possible exceptions of years in which the Crown was at stake like 1973, 1977, and 1978. Combined broadcast arrangements with ABC continued until 2001, when NBC Sports took over. =Al Michaels joins Monday Night Football= Michaels served as the play-by-play announcer, teaming with Frank Gifford for a two-man booth in 1986. During that season, the Miami Dolphins again made records with the biggest blowout in Monday Night Football history in a 45‚Äì3 rout of the then 10-1 New York Jets (the record was later tied and subsequently broken in 2005; see below). Also in 1986, when Al Michaels became unavailable because he was calling Major League Baseball's League Championship Series, Frank Gifford moved up into the play-by-play spot while Lynn Swann or O.J. Simpson filled-in as the color commentator. Gifford would once again call the play-by-play when Michaels was busy calling the World Series in 1987 and 1989 and the National League Championship Series in 1988. In 1987, Gifford and Michaels were joined by Dan Dierdorf, returning the series to its original concept of three announcers in the booth. The trio would last for 11 seasons through the conclusion of the 1997 season. In 1989, television composer Edd Kalehoff created a new arrangement of Johnny Pearson's \\"Heavy Action\\", by that time fully synonymous with the series. This more or less replaced an original composition by Charles Fox. Also debuting in 1989 was Hank Williams, Jr. performing \\"All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night\\", sung to the music of his 1984 hit \\"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight.\\" =The beginning of ABC's regular college basketball package= When ABC's coverage began in 1987, the network primarily covered the Big Ten, Big 8 and Pac-10 Conferences. By 1991 (around the time NBC was phasing out their own college basketball coverage), ABC ramped up its basketball coverage in an effort to fill the void. As a result, the network also started to cover games focusing on teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and Southeastern Conference (SEC). Otherwise, it was essentially, a considerable hodge-podge with an ACC game one week, or a Pac-10 or Big 10 game the next. The games that were broadcast were a hodge-podge of conference matchups even after the ESPN on ABC brand change, with SEC and Big East match-ups occasionally being shown alongside frequent ACC, Big 12 and Pac-10 match-ups. ABC's early regular season broadcasts were, for the most part, technically time buys from organizations such as Raycom (particularly, around 1990‚Äì91) or sister network ESPN. This in return, was a way to avoid union contracts which require that 100% of network shows had to use crew staff who were network union members. During the early 1990s, Raycom paid ABC US$1.8 million for six weeks of network airtime of 26 regional games. The format allowed Raycom to control the games and sell the advertising. In the 1987‚Äì88 season, ABC did not air any college basketball games during the last three weekends of February due to the network's coverage of the Winter Olympics. As previously mentioned, coverage by ABC steadily increased during the early 1990s; by the 1991‚Äì92 season, ABC was carrying regional games in many timeslots on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. By 1997, ABC's presenting sponsor was Paine Webber. =ABC broadcasts its final Olympic Games= The Calgary Winter Olympics were the first winter games to earn a significant television revenue base; where the 1980 Lake Placid Games generated only US$20.7 million worldwide, OCO'88 generated $324.9 million in broadcast rights. The overwhelming majority of television revenues came from the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), which agreed in 1984 to pay $309 million for American television rights, over three times the $91.5 million it paid for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. The deal, at the time the highest amount ever paid for a sporting event, allowed organizers to announce the Games would be debt-free. The CTV Television Network paid C$4.5 million for Canadian rights and to act as the host broadcaster. The games were also televised on CBC. While western European nations paid US$5.7 million combined. OCO'88 made several alterations to the Olympic program as part of efforts to ensure value for its broadcast partners. Premier events, including ice hockey and figure skating, were scheduled for prime time and the Games were lengthened to 16 days from the previous 12 to ensure three weekends of coverage. However, a significant downturn in advertising revenue for sporting events resulted in ABC forecasting significant financial losses on the Games. Calgary organizers appreciated their fortunate timing in signing the deal. King described the timing of the contract with ABC as \\"the passing of the sun and the moon at the right time for Calgary.\\" ABC lost an estimated $60 million, and broadcast rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics were later sold to the CBS network for $243 million, a 20% reduction compared to Calgary. The network, at the insistence of new owner Capital Cities Communications (much to the chagrin of Roone Arledge's successor at ABC Sports, Dennis Swanson), opted not to bid for the rights to show any future Games. Subsequently, The Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities-ABC in 1995 and began the process of putting more effort into the branding of ABC's sports channel ESPN than of ABC Sports itself. =ABC loses the baseball package to CBS and the 1989 World Series earthquake= In (the final year of ABC's contract with Major League Baseball), ABC moved the baseball telecasts to Thursday nights in hopes of getting leg up against NBC's Cosby Show. After braving the traumatic Loma Prieta earthquake and an all-time low 16.4 rating for the 1989 World Series, Al Michaels took ABC's loss of baseball to CBS as \\"tough to accept.\\" Michaels added that \\"baseball was such an early stepchild at ABC and had come such a long way.\\" Gary Thorne, who served as ABC's backup play-by-play announcer in 1989 and was an on-field reporter for the World Series that year (and covering the trophy presentation in the process), simply laughed while saying \\"Great reviews, just as ABC baseball ends.\\" Meanwhile, Dennis Swanson, president of ABC Sports, noted in a statement that baseball had been a blue-chip franchise since 1976 for the network, which was disappointed to lose it. After ABC lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS, they aggressively counterprogrammed CBS' postseason baseball coverage (like NBC) with made-for-TV movies and miniseries geared towards female viewers. Game 3 of the 1989 World Series (initially scheduled for October 17) was delayed by ten days due to the Loma Prieta earthquake. The earthquake struck at approximately 5:04 p.m. Pacific Time. At the moment the quake struck, ABC's color commentator Tim McCarver was narrating taped highlights of the previous Series game. Viewers saw the video signal begin to break up, heard McCarver repeat a sentence as the shaking distracted him, and heard McCarver's colleague Al Michaels exclaim, \\"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth‚Äî.\\"\\"Earthquake\\".

Michaels had to pickup a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point they put him back on the air. Michaels cracked, \\"Well folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!\\" accompanied by the excited screams of fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere.\\"Earthquake\\".

After about a 15-minute delay (ABC aired a rerun of Roseanne and subsequently, The Wonder Years in the meantime), ABC was able to regain power via a backup generator. ABC's play-by-play man, Al Michaels (who was familiar with the San Francisco Bay Area dating back to his days working for the San Francisco Giants from 1974-1976) then proceeded to relay reports to Ted Koppel at ABC News' headquarters in Washington, D.C. Al Michaels was ultimately nominated for an Emmy for his on-site reporting at the World Series. 1990s =The Pan American Games from Havana, Cuba= ABC was the first American television network to broadcast the Pan American Games in 1963, when they devoted one episode of their Wide World of Sports anthology program to the games. In 1991, ABC sought the rights to the Pan Am Games in Havana. The negotiations became bogged down in the U.S. embargo against Cuba, which forbade direct payments to Cuba. After a protracted negotiation with the U.S. Justice Department, ABC eventually inked a deal to broadcast the games. (The fee was paid indirectly to avoid the embargo. ABC partnered with Ted Turner's TNT cable channel for the Havana games. TNT aired the prime time coverage with Ernie Johnson Jr. as host, while Brent Musburger (who had been fired by CBS in March 1990) anchored ABC's weekend afternoon coverage. This would be the last time the games were broadcast by a major broadcast network in the United States. All coverage since has aired on cable or Spanish- language networks. =ABC's alignment with the CFA and the Bowl Championship Series= In 1991, ABC acquired the rights to the CFA from CBS in addition to the B10/P10 and went back to televising several regional games in many timeslots. Meanwhile, Notre Dame broke apart from the CFA and signed a deal with NBC for its home games. 1992 was the first year that ABC made most of its regional games available via pay-per-view (similar to what became known as ESPN GamePlan). In 1996, CBS obtained rights to the SEC, Big East, and Army/Navy Game and also added a Conference USA game. ABC however, still had rights to the SEC title game. In 1998, ABC was awarded the first exclusive Bowl Championship Series television contract beginning with the 1999 series. In 2005, the network lost rights to most of the BCS games, including the BCS National Championship Game, to Fox beginning with the 2006-07 series, in a deal worth close to $20 million per game. Although due to a separate arrangement with the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association, ABC retained the broadcast rights to events in the series that were held at the Rose Bowl stadium, such as the Rose Bowl Game and the 2010 BCS Championship. ABC sister network ESPN assumed the BCS rights, including the rights to the Rose Bowl, beginning in 2010. Keith Jackson, who was supposed to retire after the 1998 season, stayed with the network until 2005, in which he announced games televised primarily from the West Coast, where he was based; Jackson's last broadcast with the network was the 2006 Rose Bowl. In 1999, as Jackson reduced his schedule, ABC began the year with the team of Jackson and Bob Griese intact ‚Äì albeit not as the lead announcing team, as they almost exclusively handled action from Pac-10 Conference teams; Brent Musburger and Dan Fouts returned, as did the longtime tandem of Brad Nessler and Gary Danielson. These assignments were not permanent and many different combinations were used ABC locked its broadcasting teams in mid-season. Jackson was teamed with Fouts, Musburger was paired with Danielson, and Nessler with Bob Griese. =Counter programming the Winter Olympics with boxing= In 1992, ABC announced plans to counterprogram the Winter Olympics on CBS with boxing, a sport at that point, seldom seen on network television. This particular boxing series was sponsored by Fruit of the Loom. ABC proceeded to forgo the typical $300,000 rights fees of the prior year, and instead, set a $75,000 limit and scheduled three consecutive Saturdays of action. =Baseball temporarily returns to ABC= After a four-year-long hiatus (when CBS exclusively carried the over-the-air Major League Baseball television rights), ABC returned to baseball in (again, alongside NBC) . Under a six-year plan, Major League Baseball was intended to receive 85% of the first $140 million in advertising revenue (or 87.5% of advertising revenues and corporate sponsorship from the games until sales top a specified level), 50% of the next $30 million, and 80% of any additional money. Prior to this, Major League Baseball was projected to take a projected 55% cut in rights fees and receive a typical rights fee from the networks. After NBC was finished with their post-1994 All-Star Game six-week baseball coverage, ABC (with a reunited Al Michaels, Tim McCarver, and Jim Palmer as the primary crew) then picked up where NBC left off by televising six more regular season games. Joining the team of Michaels, McCarver, and Palmer was Lesley Visser, who served as the lead field reporter for the CBS' baseball coverage from 1990‚Äì1993. Visser was reuniting with McCarver, for whom she had worked with on CBS. The regular season games fell under the Baseball Night in America umbrella which premiered on July 16, 1994. In even-numbered years, NBC had the rights to the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series while ABC had the World Series and newly created Division Series. In odd-numbered years, the postseason and All-Star Game television rights were supposed to alternate. The long-term plans for The Baseball Network crumbled when the players went on strike on August 12, 1994 (thus forcing the cancellation of the World Series). In July 1995, ABC and NBC, who wound up having to share the duties of televising the 1995 World Series as a way to recoup (with ABC broadcasting Games 1, 4, and 5 and NBC broadcasting Games 2, 3, and 6), announced that they were opting out of their agreement with Major League Baseball. Both networks figured that as the delayed baseball season opened without a labor agreement, there was no guarantee against another strike. Both networks soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball for the remainder of the 20th century. =Joining forces with the World League of American Football, Major League Soccer and the Arena Football League= ABC Sports broadcast some games in both seasons, mostly on Sunday afternoons. ABC showed the 1991 World Bowl, while USA carried the game in 1992. The reported cost of the contracts varied ‚Äì the L.A. Times said that ABC had paid $28m for two years, and USA $25m. For the 1992 season the WLAF charged each network less for broadcasting rights; The New York Times reported that ABC's annual fee went down from $12m to $3m, and USA's from $14m to $10m. The ABC coverage's average ratings fell from 1991 to 1992, from around 2.1 to 1.7, and USA's from 1.2 to 1.1. Both networks asked the WLAF to expand into two major U.S. markets for 1993. Major League Soccer with ESPN and ABC Sports announced the league's first television rights deal on March 15, 1994, without any players, coaches, or teams in place. The three-year agreement covered English- language broadcasting for the 1996‚Äì1998 seasons, and committed 10 games on ESPN, 25 on ESPN2, and the MLS Cup on ABC. The deal gave MLS no rights fees, but the advertising revenue was divided between the league and networks. ABC (under the Wide World of Sports umbrella) aired the ArenaBowl five consecutive years from 1998-02\\\\. =Overhauling ABC's golf coverage= In 1990, Roger Twibell took over as lead anchor, with Dave Marr as his analyst. Peter Alliss became sole anchor of the second anchor team. During this period, ABC acquired the rights to several non-major PGA Tour events, mostly important events such as The Memorial Tournament and The Tour Championship. 1990 would also mark the final PGA Championship to be broadcast by ABC. In 1992, Brent Musburger, who had been heavily criticized for his hosting of golf coverage while with CBS, took over as host. Marr was dismissed from the network, while Twibell was reassigned to ESPN's golf coverage, although he occasionally hosted on ABC for a few lower-level tournaments. The format was also reorganized to more emphasize the on-course reporters. Steve Melnyk moved over from CBS to become lead analyst; however, Alliss would anchor for stretches during the telecast. Beyond the team in the booth, all of ABC's other voices were on the course, including Rankin, Rosburg and newcomer Mark Rolfing. After facing much criticism for its golf coverage, especially Jack Nicklaus' involvement and Musburger's perceived lack of knowledge of the game, ABC decided to completely overhaul its visual presentation, becoming more in line with cable partner ESPN, while changing the format for its coverage to be more of the standard in line with the other networks, featuring a lead anchor team, announcers assigned to individual holes, and on-course reporters. Mike Tirico became the host, with Curtis Strange serving as lead analyst. Steve Melnyk, Peter Alliss and Ian Baker-Finch became hole announcers, while Bob Rosburg, Judy Rankin and Rolfing were the primary on-course reporters. ABC continued its renewed commitment to golf when it reached a new television contract in 1999 in which the network gained the broadcast rights to many events, including the entire fall PGA Tour season and two of the new World Golf Championships events. ABC partnered with ESPN on much of its coverage, with ESPN carrying the early rounds of tournament events that ABC broadcast, in addition to those that were part of the cable channel's own schedule; the ABC team would work the cable telecasts in these cases. Beginning in 1999, ABC aired a series of match play golf challenge matches on Monday nights. All the matches have involved World Number 1 Tiger Woods, and the first seven were run by his representatives IMG. Monday Night Golf proved to be an initial success, drawing more viewers than the final round of the U.S. Open, and being second only to the final round of the Masters Tournament in terms of golf broadcasts. Ratings increased significantly for the second match, but they declined rapidly after that, and the event was initially cancelled after the 2005 edition, with Woods also wishing to take a break from the event. =The end of the Pro Bowlers Tour on ABC and Wide World of Sports= Although the Professional Bowlers Tour maintained high ratings throughout most of its years, ABC (which was transitioning to new management after being purchased by The Walt Disney Company in 1996) opted against renewing its contract with the PBA primarily due to the overall decline of the sport in the late 1980s and 1990s. This was partially attributed to the explosion of sports viewing choices in the 1990s, especially on cable television, the lack of any one bowling star to follow, and an aging audience for televised bowling. (Research in 1997 showed that 67% of the viewing audience for network TV bowling was at least 50 years old.)Callahan, Gerry. \\"The Last Frame.\\" Article in Sports Illustrated on June 30, 1997. The final PBT broadcast aired on June 21, 1997 at the St. Clair Classic in Fairview Heights, Ill. that was won by Walter Ray Williams Jr. It was a very emotional broadcast in which Williams Jr. and Pete Weber, the game's two giants at the time, battled it out until the very end. In later years, with the rise of cable television offering more outlets for sports programming, Wide World of Sports lost many of the events that had been staples of the program for many years (many, although not all, of them ended up on ESPN, a sister network to ABC for most of its existence). Ultimately, on January 3, 1998, Jim McKay announced that Wide World of Sports, in its traditional anthology series, had been canceled after a 37-year run. The Wide World of Sports name remained in use afterward as an umbrella title for ABC's weekend sports programming. =Major changes at Monday Night Football= In 1997, ABC began using a scoring bug showing the game clock and score throughout the entire broadcast. For the 1998 season, ABC pushed Monday Night Football back an hour (it has usually aired at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time). A special pre-game show was created, Monday Night Blast, hosted by Chris Berman from the ESPN Zone restaurant in Baltimore. The game would start around 8:20 p.m. Eastern for this particular season. Despite leaving the booth, Frank Gifford stayed on one more year as a special contributor to the pre-game show, usually presenting a single segment. Beginning in 1999, Monday Night Football telecasts used a computer-generated yellow line to mark where a team needs to get a first down, a method first used by ABC sister cable channel ESPN. 1999 also saw the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game being moved from Saturday afternoon to Monday night. It would remain on Monday night through 2005. 2000s =ABC lands the NHL= In the and seasons, ABC televised six weekly regional telecasts on Sunday afternoons beginning in March (or the last three Sundays of the regular season). This marked the first time that regular season National Hockey League games were broadcast on American network television since (when NBC was the NHL's American broadcast television partner). ABC would then televise three weeks worth of playoff games (or the first three Sundays of the playoffs). The network did not televise the Stanley Cup Finals, which instead, were televised nationally by ESPN and by Prime Ticket in Los Angeles () and MSG Network in New York (). Games televised on ABC were not subject to blackout. These broadcasts (just as was the case with the 1999‚Äì2004 package) were essentially, time-buys by ESPN. In other words, ABC would sell three-hour blocks of airtime to ESPN, which in return, would produce, supply broadcasters and sell advertising. In August 1998, ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 signed a five-year television deal with the NHL, worth a total of approximately US$600 million (or $120 million per year). The $120 million per year that ABC and ESPN paid for rights dwarfed the $5.5 million that the NHL received from American national broadcasts in the 1991‚Äì92 season. Following the 2003‚Äì04 season, ESPN was only willing to renew its contract for two additional years at $60 million per year. ABC refused to televise the Stanley Cup Finals in prime time, suggesting that the Finals games it would telecast be played on weekend afternoons (including a potential Game 7). Disney executives later conceded that they overpaid for the 1999‚Äì2004 deal, so the company's offer to renew the television rights was lower in 2004. =ABC airs its final boxing card= Prior to the advent of Wide World of Sports, many major heavyweight boxing title matches were televised via ‚Äúclosed-circuit‚Äù (this generally meant that you had go to a movie theater to see it, pay a decent-sized amount of money to get it, and then watch it on a giant screen). Often, Wide World of Sports would show full-length replays of the fights a week or two later; these replays were usually called by Howard Cosell, who became one of the best-known (and possibly most controversial) sportscaster in American television history. ABC's final boxing card occurred on June 17, 2000 with Jos√© Luis Castillo upsetting Stevie Johnston in the lightweight championship bout in Bell Gardens, California. Seven years after ABC's last boxing card, they were scheduled to broadcast a card from Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey on April 22, 2007. The card would've featured former light heavyweight champion Antonio Tarver facing off against Elvir Muriqi. Promoter Joe DeGuardia of Star Boxing had been working on the time buy deal (in other words, DeGuardia was not paid a licensing fee by ABC, but rather bought an hour of time from the network). The production would've been handled by ABC's sister company, ESPN with Friday Night Fights commentators Joe Tessitore and Teddy Atlas. The bout was ultimately scrapped amid rumors that Tarver would not be able to make the 175 pound weight limit. =Dennis Miller and later John Madden join Monday Night Football= Unexpectedly, comedian Dennis Miller joined the cast in 2000, along with Dan Fouts. The move was ultimately regarded as a bust by many viewers and commentators. ABC briefly considered adding radio personality Rush Limbaugh before Miller was added to the broadcast team, despite having no prior sports broadcast experience (Limbaugh would instead be assigned as a commentator to Sunday NFL Countdown on ABC sister ESPN). Miller demonstrated a knowledge of the game and its personalities, although at times he tended to lapse into sometimes obscure analogy-riddled streams of consciousness similar to the \\"rants\\" of his standup comedy act. ABC even set up a webpage dedicated to explaining Miller's sometimes obscure pop culture references. Soon, it would become apparent that Miller's comedy did not mix with football. In 2002, both Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts were dropped and John Madden joined Al Michaels in a two-man booth. Madden was a coach for the Oakland Raiders, namesake of the seminal Madden NFL video game series, and a successful broadcaster for 21 years ‚Äì first with CBS until 1993 and then with Fox ‚Äì before joining Monday Night Football. =ABC and ESPN outbids NBC for the NBA contract= In late 2001, the NBA was in the midst of putting together a new broadcast and cable television deal. At the time, conventional wisdom was that NBC would renew its existing broadcasting contract with the league. An October 5, 2001, Sports Business Daily article cited The New York Times sports columnist Richard Sandomir regarding the possibility of ESPN joining with ABC in obtaining a portion of the contract: The negotiations were closely watched by those in the business world, as it was the first time that a major sports league crafted a television deal in the new economic environment since the September 11 terrorist attacks a few months before. Declining ratings for NBC's NBA game telecasts had already led many to believe that the NBA's next television rights fee would be lower than previous years, and the economic recession made that a likely scenario. As predicted, NBC's offer to the league was lower than the previous agreement's amount. Had the NBA agreed to the network's offer, it would have been the first sports league to experience a decline in rights fees. However, the NBA rejected NBC's offer and after the network's exclusive negotiating period with the league expired, ABC and ESPN stepped in. On January 22, 2002, the NBA signed a six- year deal with The Walt Disney Company and Turner Sports, which renewed an existing deal with TNT and allowed ABC and ESPN to acquire the rights to air the league's games. ABC and ESPN reportedly paid an average of about US$400 million a season. Technically, ESPN pays the NBA for its broadcast rights and \\"buys\\" time on ABC to air select games (this is noted in copyright tags during the end credits at the conclusion of the telecasts, saying \\"The preceding program has been paid for by ESPN, Inc.\\") In all, the contract allowed the NBA to increase its rights fees by 25%. In June 2007, and again in October 2014, the NBA renewed its television agreement with ESPN, as well as TNT, with the current contract extending through the 2024-25 season. =The end of Monday Night Football on ABC= Despite high ratings, ABC lost millions of dollars on televising the games during the late 1990s and 2000s. The NFL also indicated that it wanted Sunday night to be the new night for its marquee game, because more people tend to watch television on Sundays, and games held on that night would be more conducive to flexible scheduling, a method by which some of the NFL's best games could be moved from the afternoon to the evening on Sunday on short notice. Given these factors, as well as the rise of ABC's ratings on Sunday night, and the network's wish of protecting its Desperate Housewives franchise (which they knew would be costly), on April 18, 2005, ABC and the NFL announced the end of their 36-year partnership, with the Monday Night Football broadcasts being moved to ESPN starting with the 2006 season; the move was criticized by some of the Disney shareholders (as well as NFL fans and purists). However, ESPN's ability to collect subscription fees from cable and satellite providers, in addition to selling commercials, made it more likely that ESPN could turn a profit on NFL telecasts, as opposed to ABC's heavy losses. The final Monday Night Football broadcast on ABC aired on December 26, 2005, when the New York Jets hosted the New England Patriots from Giants Stadium. Coincidentally, both the first and last ABC Monday Night Football game telecasts ended with a score of 31‚Äì21 with the Jets on the losing end. Vinny Testaverde holds the distinction of throwing the last TD pass in ABC's MNF telecast history; it was to wide receiver Laveranues Coles. Also, Testaverde's pass set an NFL record: most consecutive seasons with a touchdown pass, 19 seasons (1987‚Äì2005). Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel set a record of note during that last ABC telecast, becoming the first player to catch two touchdown passes and record a quarterback sack in the same game. The final play of the ABC era was a Pats kneeldown by 44-year-old reserve quarterback Doug Flutie. John Madden said at the show's ending: =Being fully integrated into ESPN= In 1984, ABC reached a deal with Getty Oil to acquire ESPN. ABC retained an 80% share, and sold a 20% interest to Nabisco. The Nabisco shares were later sold to the Hearst Corporation, which still holds a 20% ownership stake in the channel today. In May 1985, ABC was purchased by Capital Cities Communications in a $3.5 billion deal that was finalized in February 1986. Under Getty ownership, the channel was unable to compete for the television rights to major sports events contracts as its majority corporate parent would not provide the funding, leading ESPN to lose out for broadcast deals with the National Hockey League (to USA Network) and NCAA Division I college football (to TBS). For years, the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball refused to consider cable as a means of broadcasting some of their games. However, with the backing of ABC, ESPN's ability to compete for major sports contracts greatly increased, and gave it credibility within the sports broadcasting industry. In February 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion, and assumed the latter company's 80% stake in ESPN at that time. According to an analysis published by Barron's Magazine in February 2008, ESPN \\"is probably worth more than 40% of Disney's entire value... based on prevailing cash-flow multiples in the industry.\\"Santoli, M.. (2008, February). The Magics Back. Barrons, 88(8), 27‚Äì29,31. Retrieved February 16, 2011, from ABI/INFORM Global. (Document ID: 1435830791). Despite it technically being a joint venture, for all intents and purposes, ESPN operates as a division of Disney as a result of the company's controlling interest (as it was with ABC and Capital Cities before it). In August 2006, ESPN announced that ABC Sports would be fully integrated into ESPN, using the channel's graphics and music for its sports presentations, in addition to handling production responsibilities for the ABC sports telecasts. The last live sporting event televised under the ABC Sports banner was the U.S. Championship Game of the Little League World Series on August 26, 2006 (ABC was slated to carry the Little League World Series Championship Game on August 27, but the game was postponed to August 28 due to rain, and subsequently aired on ESPN2). The changeover took effect the following weekend to coincide with the start of the college football season, with NBA, IndyCar Series and NASCAR coverage eventually following suit. Despite the rebranding, George Bodenheimer's official title remained \\"President, ESPN Inc. and ABC Sports\\" until his retirement at the end of 2011, upon which the \\"ABC Sports\\" portion of the title was retired. In addition, ABC itself maintains the copyright over many of the ESPN-branded broadcasts, if they are not contractually assigned to the applicable league or organizer. ABC-affiliated stations owned by Hearst Television (such as WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh; WCVB-TV in Boston; WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire; WISN-TV in Milwaukee and KMBC-TV in Kansas City) have the right of first refusal over the local simulcasts of ESPN-televised Monday Night Football games involving teams within their home market, which are very rarely waived to other local stations in their market areas. Equally, other Hearst-owned stations affiliated with other networks (such as NBC affiliate WBAL-TV in Baltimore) have been able to air NFL games from ESPN for the same reason. ESPN has been criticized for decreasing the number of sports broadcasts on ABC, especially during the summer months. One such example is NASCAR: from 2007 to 2009, ABC aired all of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup races, along with the penultimate race to the chase. From 2010 to 2014, ABC only broadcast three Sprint Cup races with only one Chase race (held in Charlotte, North Carolina) to the outrage of many NASCAR fans and sponsors. Several other events such as the Rose Bowl, the Citrus Bowl and The Open Championship, have also been moved from ABC to ESPN. This, however, is not entirely the fault of ESPN, as ABC in general has attracted a primarily female viewership in recent years, with sports largely attracting a male-dominated audience. ESPN Sports Saturday, an analogy program in the vein of Wide World of Sports, was cancelled after five seasons in August 2015. This was because ABC gave back the Sunday afternoon schedule to its affiliates four months later. Also, with the rise of the Internet and 24/7 mobile applications and streaming services specializing in sports news have completely eliminated the need for a traditional anthology sports program airing on broadcast television (including ABC) during weekend afternoons. It also eliminated the need for a separate Sunday afternoon block on ABC which had seen a long decline until January 2016. It is now simply a simulcast of the 30 for 30 documentary series sourced from ESPN.

Lake Stanley, also called the Stanley unconformity, is a postglacial freshwater lake that occupied part of what is now the basin of Lake Huron during a hydrologically significant period from 10,000 years Before Present (B.P.). The lake‚Äôs surface level was approximately 70 meters below the current lake‚Äôs water surface. The lake, although geographically smaller than the current Lake Huron, was fed from a large Lake Chippewa watershed that included the basin of what is now Lake Michigan. During this period, the water from Lake Stanley drained through an outlet or outlets adjacent to what is now North Bay, Ontario. Research The lake‚Äôs now-submerged shoreline has enabled some research to be done into ecological conditions during this time period. Research, published in 2009, described placements of stones near a section of Lake Stanley shoreline that could be interpreted as hunting infrastructure; authors O‚ÄôShea and Mathews suggested that the stones, now underwater, could have been gathered and placed as ‚Äúdrive lanes‚Äù to force or entice migratory caribou into a human ambush. Lake Stanley was, however, short-lived. Starting about 8,500 B.P., the geological conditions that had created Lake Stanley underwent a series of changes. North of a geological ‚Äútilt line,‚Äù the subsurface terrain of the Canadian Shield, no longer weighed down by glacial ice, rebounded and closed off the North Bay outflow. ‚ÄúRising water in the Lake Huron basin inundated the Mackinac Straits after 8,150 yr B.P.‚Äù, ending the existence of Lake Stanley and later creating the present-day Lake Michigan-Lake Huron lake complex.

The Red August (), originally meaning August 1966 of the Cultural Revolution, is also used to indicate a series of massacres in Beijing which mainly took place during the period. According to the official statistics in 1980, from August to September in 1966, a total of 1,772 people‚Äîincluding teachers and principals of many schools‚Äîwere killed in Beijing by Red Guards; in addition, 33,695 homes were ransacked and 85,196 families were forced to leave the city. The killing by the Red Guards also made an impact on several rural districts of Beijing, causing the \\"Daxing Massacre\\", for example, during which 325 people were killed from August 27 to September 1 in Daxing District of Beijing. The oldest killed during the Daxing Massacre was 80 years old, while the youngest was only 38 days old; 22 families were wiped out. Scholars have also pointed out that, according to the official statistics in 1985, the actual death toll during the Red August was over 10,000. On August 18, 1966, Mao Zedong met with Song Binbin, a leader of the Red Guards, on Tiananmen of Beijing, which greatly encouraged the Red Guards who then started their massive killing in the city and destroyed the \\"Four Olds\\" at the same time. Methods of slaughter during the Red August included beating, whipping, strangling, trampling, boiling, beheading and so on; in particular, the method used to kill most infants and children were knocking them against the ground or slicing them in halves. Many people, including the notable writer Lao She, committed suicide after being persecuted. During the massacres, Mao Zedong publicly opposed any government intervention to the students' movement, and Xie Fuzhi, the Minister of Ministry of Public Security, also ordered to protect the Red Guards and not arrest them. However, the situation had grown out of control by the end of August 1966, forcing the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chinese government to take multiple interventions that gradually brought the massacre to an end. The Red August of Beijing is regarded as the origin of Red Terror in the Chinese Cultural Revolution, instigating Red Guards' movement in multiple cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Xiamen, where local political leaders, intellectuals, teachers and members of the Five Black Categories were persecuted and even killed by the Red Guards. There has been comparison between the date \\"18 August 1966\\", which was the crucial moment of the Red August, with the Kristallnacht, which was the prelude of Nazi Germany's Holocaust. In addition, the Red August along with the subsequent massacres across China during the Cultural Revolution has been compared to the Nanjing Massacre conducted by the Japanese military during the Second Sino-Japanese War.  History of the massacre  = Historical background = Red Guards on Tiananmen Square of Beijing (September 1966). On May 16, 1966, Cultural Revolution began in mainland, China. On August 5, Bian Zhongyun, the first vice principal of the Experimental High School Attached to Beijing Normal University, was beaten to death by Red Guards and was the first education worker in Beijing killed by the Red Guards. = Massacre in Beijing = On August 18, 1966, Mao Zedong met with Song Binbin, a leader of the Red Guards, on Tiananmen of Beijing, where Mao asked Song if the \\"Bin\\" in her given name was the same Chinese character as that in Chinese Chengyu \\"Wen Zhi Bin Bin (ÊñáË¥®ÂΩ¨ÂΩ¨)\\"; upon receiving confirmation, Mao commented that, ‚ÄúYao Wu Ma (Ë¶ÅÊ≠¶Âòõ)‚Äù, meaning \\"(you'd) better fight\\". After this meeting, the morale of the Red Guards was boosted significantly, triggering their massive slaughter in Beijing. In particular, on August 25, 1966, thousands of Red Guards started a week-long massacre in Ganlan Market () of the Chongwen District. At the same time, the Red Guards began to destroy the \\"Four Olds\\". On August 22, 1966, Mao approved a document from the Ministry of Public Security, ordering \\"do not use police force‚Äîno exception‚Äîto intervene or suppress the movement of revolutionary students\\". The next day, Mao gave a talk at a Work Conference of the Central Committee of CPC, publicly backing the students' movement and opposing any intervention to the \\"Cultural Revolution of students\\": > In my view, Peking is not all that chaotic. The students held a meeting of > 100,000 and then captured the murderers. This caused some panic. Peking is > too gentle. Appeals have been issued, [but after all] there are very few > hooligans. Stop interfering for the time being. It is still too early to say > anything definite about the reorganization of the centre of the [Youth] > League; let us wait four months. Decisions taken hurriedly can do only harm. > Work teams were dispatched in a hurry; the left was struggled against in a > hurry; meetings of 100,000 were called in a hurry; appeals were issued in a > hurry; opposition to the new municipal [party] committee of Peking was said, > in a hurry, to be tantamount to an opposition to the [party] Centre. Why is > it impermissible to oppose K? I have issued a big character poster myself, > ‚ÄòBombard the Headquarters!‚Äô Some problems have to be settled soon. For > instance, the workers, peasants, and soldiers should not interfere with the > students‚Äô great Cultural Revolution. Let the students go into the street. > What is wrong with their writing big-character posters or going into the > street? Let foreigners take pictures. They take shots to show aspects of our > backward tendencies. But it does not matter. Let the imperialists make a > scandal about us. On August 26, Xie Fuzhi, the Minister of Ministry of Public Security, also ordered to protect the Red Guards and not arrest them; he stated that it was not incorrect for the Red Guards to beat \\"bad people\\", and it was fine if the \\"bad people\\" were killed. The next day, the \\"Daxing Massacre\\" occurred in Daxing District of Beijing. While meeting with the heads of several provincial public security systems, Xie reiterated his points that the killing by Red Guards was none of their business and it would be a mistake if the public security was to arrest the Red Guards. = The end of the massacre = Mao Zedong and the Red Guards in Beijing (October 1966). By the end of August 1966, the situation had grown out of control, forcing the Central Committee of CPC and the Chinese government to take multiple interventions, which gradually brought the massacre to an end. On September 5, People's Daily published an article (Áî®ÊñáÊñó, ‰∏çÁî®Ê≠¶Êñó), calling for an end to the combat and massacre. Nevertheless, millions of Red Guards continued to arrive in Beijing to see Mao Zedong at Tiananmen square on several occasions including September 15, October 1 and so on.  The slaughter  The rally of Red Guards on Tiananmen Square (1967). = Methods of killing = During the Red August, some have claimed that methods of slaughter used by the Red Guards included beating, whipping, strangling, trampling, boiling, beheading and so on; in particular, the method used to kill most infants and children were knocking them against the ground or slicing them in halves. = Death toll = * According to the official statistics in 1980, from August to September in 1966, a total of 1,772 people‚Äîincluding teachers and principals of many schools‚Äîwere killed in Beijing by Red Guards; in addition, 33,695 homes were ransacked and 85,196 families were forced to leave Beijing. * In \\"Daxing Massacre\\", 325 people were killed from August 27 to September 1 in Daxing District of Beijing. Even though most researchers think that the number of deaths in Daxing massacre was already counted in Beijing's total tally (i.e., 1,772), some researchers disagree and argue that the number of deaths in rural districts such as Daxing and Changping were not counted in Beijing's municipal data. * Researchers have pointed out that, according to the official statistics in 1985, the actual death toll during the Red August was over 10,000; in addition, 92,000 homes were ransacked and 125,000 families were forced to leave the city.  Aftermath and influence  The Red Guards' political propaganda on the campus of Shanghai Fudan University: \\"Defend the Central Party Committee with blood and life! Defend Chairman Mao with blood and life! ‚Äù. The Red August of Beijing is regarded as the origin of Red Terror in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Some of the Red Guards from Beijing No.6 High School even wrote \\"Long Live Red Terror!\\" on the wall with the blood of their victims. The Red August instigated the movement of Red Guards in multiple cities of China, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Xiamen, where local political leaders, intellectuals, teachers and members of the Five Black Categories were persecuted and even killed by the Red Guards. For instance, on September 15, 1966, eleven Red Guards from Beijing Foreign Studies University went to Shanghai and teamed up with Red Guards from Shanghai Foreign Language School, chanting \\"Long Live Red Terror\\" and persecuting 31 teachers in total. There has been comparison between the date \\"18 August 1966\\", which was the key point during the Red August, and the Kristallnacht, which was the prelude of Nazi Germany's Holocaust. Moreover, the Red August along with the subsequent massacres across China during the Cultural Revolution has also been compared to the Nanjing Massacre conducted by the Japanese military during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Wright also recorded with his own band.  Life and career  Wright was born in Centerville, Tennessee to Jake and Mary Cobel Wright. Wright and his brothers, Sherman and George performed together in their youth. Johnny told the Terre Haute Tribune Star: \\"My brothers Sherman, who played harmonica and George, who played violin and myself, we used to play on a corner in front of the courthouse for nickels and dimes.\\" After his father died when he was 10 years old, Wright's family moved north to Richmond, Indiana, for work. In 1950, Wright moved to St. Louis. He would perform with Chuck Berry in the neighboring East St. Louis, Illinois at the Cosmopolitan Club. While traveling to Detroit on a Greyhound bus in 1953, Wright wrote the song \\"I Was In St. Louis.\\" He had broke up with his first wife and moved to Detroit in search of work. During his journey, he also wrote \\"I Stayed Down Boy,\\" about a brawl he had with a girlfriend's lover. Both were recorded with assistance from Detroit promoter, Joe Von Battle in the back room of his record store. He sent Wright's recordings to King Records which were released on the King subsidiary DeLuxe Records. In 1955, Wright auditioned for Ike Turner who was then a talent scout for Modern Records. Wright signed to the label, recording, \\"Suffocate\\" and \\"The World Is Yours\\" with Turner baking him on guitar. Wright formed his own band based in Madison, Illinois. In 1959, they recorded for Stevens Records in Granite City, resulting in \\"Look At That Chick\\" and \\"Gotta Have You For Myself.\\" Wright moved to Los Angeles, playing gigs with Ike & Tina Turner as part of the Kings of Rhythm in the early 1960s. On his own he played at local clubs, sometimes pretending to be Lightning Hopkins and Elmore James when work was slow, since he said that promoters and club owners couldn't always differentiate one black artist from another. In 1968, Wright moved back to Indiana in search of work and to be closer to his family. During this period he was drinking heavily and rarely recorded. In 1977, with the help of Steve Rusin, Wright returned to the studio. While recording, Wright was working in a steel mill. He occasionally performed in clubs, sometimes with Rusin in his group, the Highway Blues Band. After a bad fall, Wright left his job at the steel mill and worked at Cowan & Cook Florists in Terre Haute, Indiana. Wright died on June 2, 1988. He is buried in the Highland Lawn Cemetery in Terre Haute.

She has spent her political career representing Rio de Janeiro, having served as state representative since 2015. Personal life She is the daughter of Anthony Garotinho and Rosinha Garotinho. Garotinho comes from a political family, with both her parents serving as governors of the state of Rio de Janeiro. She is one of Anthony and Rosinha's nine children, with three being biological and five being adopted by her parents. In her youth she studied journalism at the Faculdades Integradas H√©lio Alonso. As with the rest of her family Garotinho is a devout Presbyterian and a member of the Evangelical Caucus. In January 2016 Garotinho announced that she was engaged to businessman Marcos Altive, and that the couple was expecting their first child. Political career In 2009 due to controversy surrounding alleged partisan infidelity, Garotinho left the Brazilian Democratic Movement and joined the Party of the Republic. She was later acquitted of the charges, with her new party claiming that she was being \\"discriminated against\\" by the Brazilian Democratic Movement. That same year Garotinho was elected to the city council of Rio de Janeiro. In 2012 the Garotinho and Maia political families joined to form what was considered by the Brazilian media an unexpected alliance to defeat the then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Eduardo Paes, who was running for reelection. The coalition between the two families and the PR/DEM parties was headed by Rodrigo Maia, son of former Rio mayor Cesar Maia, and had Clarissa as his vice mayoral candidate. This was considered controversial as Cesar Maia and Anthony Garotinho had been political rivals. However, the campaign was a failure as Eduardo Paes was comfortably reelected with more than 2 million votes or 64% of the balot, while Maia and Garotinho obtained only 95,328 votes (3% of the balot). In the 2014 Brazilian general election Garotinho was elected to the Federal Chamber of Deputies, receiving 335,061. Garotinho did not vote in the impeachment of then-president Dilma Rousseff, as she said she was unable to make it due to her pregnancy. Because of the way absentee balots were counted, Garotinho's absence actually counted as a vote in favor of Rousseff. This was considered ironic as Garotinho's party and her own parents had been advocating for Rousseff's impeachment. Garotinho voted against the 2016 and 2017 tax reforms. In November 2016 Garotinho was once again expelled from a political party for partisan infidelity, as she was released from the Party of the Republic for collaborating with politicians from a rival faction in the legislature. She subsequently joined the Brazilian Republican Party or PRB on the invitation of Marcelo Crivella. Two years later Garotinho as well as her mother Rosinha were expelled from the PRB due to being investigated for corruption. Garotinho was still reelected in the 2018 Brazilian general election. In February 2019 Garotinho announced that she would be running in the 2020 Rio de Janeiro mayoral election.

Built for use as auxiliary craft, Caribou primarily served as an at-sea training platform for junior naval officers, boatswains, reserve personnel and Sea Cadets at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Esquimalt. Her name was reused for PTC 57 Caribou Orca-class Patrol Craft (PCT) vessel that replaced the YAG 300 vessels as the RCN training tenders in 2008.  Design and Layout  Like other YAG 300 vessels, Caribou was 75‚Ä≤ long overall, 18‚Ä≤6‚Ä≥ wide, had a draft of 4‚Ä≤6‚Ä≥, measured 70 tonnes, and was powered by twin 6-71 Detroit Diesel engines. Caribou was arranged in typical naval fashion with officer‚Äôs housed forward with the galley and their own head, an engine room midships, and cadet room aft with 12-14 bunks in double tiers. The heads are equipped with a pump-action lever, that can be used to pump sewage into the black water treatment tanks held aboard or into the ocean water. Above decks was the wheelhouse mounted on the forward cabin's coaming; aft of that, the exposed breezeway; and, mounted on the after cabin's coaming, a Zodiac launch as well as a food locker and barbeque. Above the wheelhouse was an open bridge, fitted with a chart table and a gyrocompass repeater. A second gyro repeater was fitted on the quarterdeck. Caribou was equipped with a small navigation radar, with the display located in the wheelhouse.  Operational History  In 1954 she was built for the RCN as YFM 314 (Yard Ferry, Man) and served as a harbour ferry boat. Re-designated as YFP 314 (Yard Ferry, Personnel) in 1960, she was transferred to the Royal Canadian Airforce (RCAF) and renamed M.975 Nimpkish II. With the RCAF she was used to ferry personnel and supplies from Coal Harbour, Vancouver to the No. 501 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron at RCAF Radar Station at Holberg, BC. In 1965 Caribou was transferred to the Navy administratively, but remained in Holberg. In November 1975 Caribou transported 369 people from Port Alice, British Columbia after a mudslide forced the evacuation of many residents. In 1978 Caribou was returned to the Maritime Command as a Torpedo Recovery Vessel and classed as an \\"Orca Class Patrol Boat\\". Later in 1978 Caribou was assigned to the CFB Comox Sea Survival School and renamed YAG 314. In 1980 she was re-named YAG 314 (Caribou), unofficially known as CFAV Caribou, and moved to CFB Esquimalt where she was used for seamanship and navigation training until 2007. Caribou was offered for sale by the Canadian Government in 2011 as part of the YAG 300 Replacement Project, which saw the YAG boats replaced by new Orca-class patrol vessels. Caribou was sold to and refurbished into a recreational cruising vessel by G.W Kleaman Marine Services Ltd of North Vancouver in 2011. In 2017, Caribou was sold and renamed M/V Tamarind by private entrepreneurs offering coastal and celestial navigation services off the coast of Vancouver, BC.

Route description From its southern end the Deagon Deviation veers west and then north, skirting the western boundary of the Deagon Racecourse and approaching the Gateway Motorway. It then runs north-north-west, between the Gateway Motorway and the Deagon Wetlands, until the motorway turns west at the Bracken Ridge Road intersection. It passes under Bracken Ridge Road and gradually turns to the north-east on its way to its northern end. For much of this section it passes between residential areas and tidal wetlands.

The two episodes, originally aired back-to-back on USA Network on December 22, 2019, were both written and directed by series creator Sam Esmail. Its ending, which had been planned from the script's inception, shows Elliot navigating a utopian version of his world with an alternate Elliot. Reviewers praised the show's shift in focus from hacking to emotions and praised the delivery of the show's final twist.  Plot  Elliot wakes up in an abandoned lot following the explosion at the Washington Township plant, which is no longer there. He discovers the town is a thriving suburbia, where his mother and father, both alive, live. He finds out that his parents never abused him as a child, and that Darlene does not exist. He returns to the city, where he encounters Angela's parents, Emily and Phillip (the latter still being in Angela's life), who reveal to him that Elliot is marrying Angela the following day. He goes to the alternate Elliot's apartment and hacks his computer, discovering a hidden drive of sketches of himself, Darlene, and the rest of fsociety. The alternate Elliot returns home to find the original Elliot at his computer (as depicted at the end of the previous episode). Initially alarmed, the alternate Elliot explains that the sketches are of a persona he created that would lead an exciting life as a vigilante hacker, the very life the original Elliot lives. They touch, causing another earthquake, which severely injures the alternate Elliot. Alternate Elliot gets a call from Angela; hearing her for the first time since her death, the original Elliot decides that he can have the life he always wanted, and kills the alternate Elliot. Elliot hides the alternate Elliot's body in a storage container, intent on taking the alternate Elliot's place and marrying Angela. A police officer, Dominique, attempts to arrest Elliot after she discovers the alternate Elliot's body. Elliot escapes to Coney Island, where he discovers that there was no wedding. Mr. Robot explains to Elliot that the world they are in is not the parallel world Whiterose spoke of, but rather an illusion created by Elliot during a morphine withdrawal, with the intention of keeping \\"the real Elliot\\" trapped. Bewildered and confused, Elliot wakes up in Krista's office. Krista (who is a manifestation of Elliot's mind at this point) explains that the Elliot we have known since the beginning of the series is not the real Elliot, but a persona called \\"The Mastermind\\" that the real Elliot (who suffers from dissociative identity disorder) created to deal with his rage and anger at the world. However, this persona decided to take over and trapped the real Elliot in the Utopian world, getting rid of Darlene, who is the real Elliot's strongest connection to reality, and Krista explains that the Mastermind must give control back to the real Elliot, but he refuses as the world collapses. The Mastermind wakes up in the hospital, where Darlene reveals that Whiterose is dead, her machine is destroyed, and that she knew that the Mastermind had taken over. Accepting his identity, the Mastermind returns to Elliot's mind with the rest of his other personas. The real Elliot wakes up in the hospital and is greeted by Darlene.  Production  Sam Esmail had originally envisioned Mr. Robot as a feature film and had its ending already in mind as he wrote the script. Based on the script's length, he decided to expand the film into a television show, but the series' ending remained that which he originally envisioned. The show's writers forwent the initially planned fifth season after storyboarding the episodes between the third season and the double-episode ending Esmail had planned. They found that they only needed other 11 episodes‚Äîa single season‚Äîto complete the story.  Reception  = Critical response = Critics praised what they described as the show's risky and successful choice to reveal Elliot's emotions and relationships at the show's core, as opposed to the austere focus on cybersecurity heists for which the show was best known. It was fitting, said The A.V. Club, for a show based on evasive identities to close in contemplation of whether it's possible to know oneself. The finale became reassurance that when trying to live meaningfully in a hostile world, it's okay to be different from one's self-image by trying to be the best version of oneself. Critics thought that the finale handled the last plot twist well without alienating viewers, given how the show had led viewers to sympathize with the on-screen Elliot as the personality who deserved autonomy over his body. The twist did not feel like \\"lazy psychodrama\\", according to The A.V. Club, because Esmail pre-planned the narrative to be fair to its ending. Engadget described it as \\"an unexpected but riveting twist that felt earned.\\" Vox was touched by Darlene's role in the ending and the unexpected reminder of the human capacity to feel and love, in which Elliot's capacity to convince himself of lies borders on farce and is stoppable only by Darlene's love, which elicits Elliot's best self. Reviewers underscored how the show had become less about hacking and rebellion than about Elliot's life and relationships (i.e., caring for each other). Hacks played no part in the final episode. The show ends without its defining negative space cinematography, with direction that matches the earnestness of the show's emotion. Paste described the show's use of M83's \\"Outro\\" in its closing sequence as \\"transcendent\\". = Ratings = The two-part series finale aired on USA Network on December 22, 2019. The first episode at 9:00 pm ET received 464,000 viewers, while the second episode at 10:00 pm ET dropped to 318,000 viewers.

The Junior Science Olympiad of Canada or JSOC is an examination in science for secondary school students, with one test usually conducted in June and a second test in October. Organized by Jennifer Pitt-Lainsbury, Marisca Vanderkamp, Maria Ni√±o-Soto, and Andrew Moffat in association with the University of Toronto Schools (UTS), JSOC encompasses material of the grade 12 curriculum for the three sciences. The Junior Science Olympiad of Canada targets motivated students ages 15 and under intent on exploring science at a higher level. With curriculum going into grade 11 and 12 science material, the JSOC helps students tackle advanced science and the International Junior Science Olympiad with online supplementary material in biology, chemistry, and physics as well as practical training sessions.  Mission  Below are the mission objectives of the JSOC: * Enriching science classes with online and practical resources * Connect science curricula to current real-world issues * Organize theoretical and practical tests in the three sciences (Chemistry, Physics, and Biology) * Provide a selection process for Canadian representation at the International Junior Science Olympiad * Provide comparisons between the science curricula of Canada and that of other IJSO countries * To nurture girls‚Äô interest in STEM  Eligibility  In order to be eligible to attend the JSOC, one must be a Canadian citizen and be 15 years of age or younger as of December 31st of the competition year. If at any stage the student is found to be not eligible for the exam, they may be disqualified from the program. Students who wish to compete in the International Junior Science Olympiad (IJSO) on Team Canada must qualify for and write both stages of the JSOC examination in the same year of the competition, as well as meet all IJSO eligibility criteria outlined in the statues of the IJSO. Students who make the final selection for the Canadian IJSO team should participate in a JSOC practical training camp, which will run in the weeks before the competition. Students who are unable to do so must provide evidence of some sort of IJSO level practical training.  Format  The JSOC is split into two stages of selection. Both stages are reviewed and marked thoroughly for errors by an experienced panel of markers and reviewers. The Stage I exam, which takes place in April, lasts 2 hours and contains a total of 45 multiple choice questions spread evenly among Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. The 2020 Stage I exam will take place on April 27th. Students write Stage II of the JSOC selection exam in September. Stage II involves two main parts, written separately over a period of two days. Part 1 is 1.5 hours long and consists of 30 multiple choice questions, 10 in each field, and Part 2 is 2 hours long and is requires full answers to be given, similar to the theoretical portion of the IJSO. The syllabus covered by the JSOC is detailed on both the JSOC and IJSO websites.  Qualification  The selection for the second stage of the JSOC is based on the following scheme. To be eligible to get to the next level, i.e. the second stage, it is necessary that a student scores at-least a Minimum Admissible Score (MAS) which is a variable fraction of the maximum score. The top 10 students or so, drawing from a combination of demonstrated theoretical skills from Stage I of JSOC are then selected to sit for Stage II. This training process, with both theoretical and practical components, is held in the last week of October. The top 6 students are then selected to participate in the International Junior Science Olympiad, the next (2020) edition of which will be hosted in Frankfurt, Germany.  History  After participating as an observer country in the 2017 IJSO, Canada sent its first ever team of 6 contestants to Doha, Qatar, for the 2019 IJSO. There, Canadian contestant Abe Wine achieved first place in both the theoretical portion and the overall exam.

Life and career =Before World War II= Graham Williams was born in the Adelaide suburb of St Peters, and attended Prince Alfred College. When he left school he studied at the South Australian School of Mines and Industries, graduating in 1934 as a wool- classer. He worked in Adelaide with the firm Goldsbrough Mort & Co. A tall fast-medium bowler and useful lower-order batsman, Williams had his best season for South Australia in 1937-38, when he took 24 wickets at an average of 24.20 and made 233 runs at 21.18. He also recorded his best bowling figures in that season, when he took 6 for 21 against Queensland on Christmas Day 1937. He spent most of 1938 in Bradford, Yorkshire, broadening his knowledge of the wool trade. While there he played with some success for Bradford in the Bradford Cricket League. =War service and later= Williams enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in April 1940. Warrant-Officer Navigator Williams was taken prisoner in July 1941 after his plane was shot down over Libya, and was released in April 1945. While imprisoned he learned braille so he could teach it to blind prisoners. He also taught agriculture, economics and touch typing in the prison camps. In 1946 he was awarded the MBE for his services to his fellow prisoners.Wisden 1980, p. 1161. Despite having lost 31 kilograms during his imprisonment, less than a month after his release Williams was playing cricket for an RAAF team against an Empire XI at Lord's. The 15,000-strong crowd, knowing his war record, gave him a standing ovation when he went in to bat. His RAAF teammate Keith Miller described the moment as \\"the most touching moment I have ever seen or heard, almost orchestral in its sound and feeling\\".Greg Growden, Cricketers at War, ABC Books, Sydney, 2019, pp. 240‚Äì55. He played for services teams throughout the 1945 season, including all five of the Victory Tests between Australian servicemen and England.\\"'Victory' Test Match Averages\\", The Cricketer, 8 September 1945, p. 320. He married Josephine Simpson in Adelaide in January 1946. His Services XI teammate Albert Cheetham was his best man. He resumed his work with Goldsbrough Mort after the war.

Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay are the two main charts that rank the top-performing country music songs in the United States, published by Billboard magazine. Hot Country Songs ranks songs based on digital downloads, streaming, and airplay not only from country stations but from stations of all formats, a methodology introduced in 2012. Country Airplay, which began being published in 2012, is based solely on country radio airplay, a methodology that had previously been used from 1990 to 2012 for Hot Country Songs. Both charts began the year with songs at number one that started their runs in 2019; \\"10,000 Hours\\" by Dan + Shay and Justin Bieber holding the top spot on the Hot Country Songs chart, and \\"Even Though I'm Leaving\\" by Luke Combs atop the Country Airplay chart. Having spent the last 11 weeks of 2019 at number one on Hot Country Songs, \\"10,000 Hours\\" spent its 15th consecutive week in the top spot in the issue of Billboard dated January 25, and in the same week topped the Country Airplay listing for the first time. It remained at number one on Hot Country Songs until March 14, when it was dethroned by \\"The Bones\\" by Maren Morris. Having reached number one in its 53rd chart week, the song logged the second-slowest climb to the top. In addition, it was the first number one on the chart for Morris and made her the first solo female artist to top the chart since Kelsea Ballerini with \\"Peter Pan\\" in the fall of 2016. In May 2020, it charted its 11th week at number one on Hot Country Songs, surpassing Taylor Swift's \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" as the longest-lasting number one by a solo female on that chart. When Jimmie Allen's \\"Make Me Want To\\" reached number one in its 58th chart week on the Country Airplay chart dated March 7, it set two records: the slowest climb to number one in that chart's history, as well as the longest chart run. In June, Travis Denning broke this record with \\"After a Few\\", which reached the top in its 65th week. Chart history Pop singer Justin Bieber collaborated with country duo Dan + Shay on the song \\"10,000 Hours\\", which topped both charts. Lady Antebellum topped the Country Airplay chart in January wth \\"What If I Never Get Over You\\". It was the group's first chart-topper since 2014. The group would shorten its name to Lady A later in the year. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\" - ! Issue date ! Hot Country Songs ! Artist(s) ! !

Built for use as auxiliary craft, Badger primarily served as an at-sea training platform for junior naval officers, boatswains, reserve personnel and Sea Cadets at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Esquimalt.  Design and Layout  Like other YAG 300 vessels, Badger was 75‚Ä≤ long overall, 18‚Ä≤6‚Ä≥ wide, had a draft of 4‚Ä≤6‚Ä≥, measured 70 tonnes, and was powered by twin 6-71 Detroit Diesel engines. Badger was arranged in typical naval fashion with officer‚Äôs housed forward with the galley and their own head, an engine room midships, and cadet room aft with 12-14 bunks in double tiers. The heads are equipped with a pump-action lever, that can be used to pump sewage into the black water treatment tanks held aboard or into the ocean water. Above decks was the wheelhouse mounted on the forward cabin's coaming; aft of that, the exposed breezeway; and, mounted on the after cabin's coaming, a Zodiac launch as well as a food locker and barbeque. Above the wheelhouse was an open bridge, fitted with a chart table and a gyrocompass repeater. A second gyro repeater was fitted on the quarterdeck. Badger was equipped with a small navigation radar, with the display located in the wheelhouse.  Operational history  In 1954 she was built for the RCN as YFM-319 (Yard Ferry, Man) and served as a harbour ferry boat. In 1960 she was re-designated as YFP-319 (Yard Ferry, Personnel) and in 1967 she was transferred to Vancouver to serve as a training tender with HMCS Discovery Canadian Forces Naval Reserve Division. In the 1980's she was re-named YAG-319 (Badger) and regrouped under the control and operation of the Small Boats Unit (SBU) at HMC Dockyard Esquimalt where she was used for seamanship and navigation training until 2007. Badger was offered for sale by the Canadian Government as part of the YAG 300 Replacement Project, which saw the YAG boats replaced by new Orca-class patrol vessels. In 2011 Badger was sold to a West Coast fisherman for $4,680.00 CAD and restored for use by a travel adventure company offering tours of the Barkley Sound, Clayoquot Sound, and Nootka.

The compound of philosophical radicalism, evangelical religion and self reliant ability typical of its founders had given an equalitarian flavour to South Australian thinking from the beginning. It was into this social setting that in February 1850 a meeting was called primarily for the formation of an Association (apparently meaning a Y.M.C.A.) for apprentices and others, after their day's work, to enjoy books, lectures, discussions, readings, friendly relief and recreation for a leisure hour. In September 1850 records show that this became ‚ÄúThe Young Men's Christian Association of South Australia\\" as evidenced by a member's letter in London Y.M.C.A. Report 1851. There was no census in 1850 but the 1851 census put the total population of South Australia at 63,700 with males numbering 35,302. The discovery of Gold in Ballarat caused a large migration from South Australia and by 1852 some 8000 had left for the Goldfields. As a consequence the various YMCA groups that had become established failed and by 1870 none remained. \\"The next available authentic record of an Association in South Australia does not appear until some members of London Y.M.C.A. coming to Adelaide, joined with ex members of the defunct original Adelaide Branch, and also members of the Brompton Association. A meeting of promoters was also held at Presbyterian Church. They became associated in the Exchange Room of the Adelaide Town Hall (now the Queen Adelaide Room) on November 28th, 1878 at a public meeting for the promotion of a revival of the Y.M.C.A. in Adelaide.

Not known as chief executive officers until the 1990s, they were known as General Secretaries. With the YMCA of Adelaide one of the very early organisations for social good it attracted some of the state's leading influential figures to its board and men of high calibre as General Secretary. The history of the organisation in South Australia is very much tied to the leadership by both General Secretaries (CEOs) and the presidents along with the boards who backed them. \\\\ General Secretaries and CEO's 1879 - H.H.

In 1886 the annual report of the YMCA indicated a lack of funds and Walker confessed to having appropriated ¬£1288/16/7. In court and before Chief Justice Sir Samuel Way, Walker revealed the money had gone on assisting impecunious young men. Walker was regarded as a very hard working Secretary who said he did not have a night off in any month and the board believed he did not have fraudulent intent but compassion rather than criminality. He was sent to jail for 4 years hard labour.Adelaide Observer 12th June 1886 1886 - 1900 John James Virgo. The 'new' YMCA building in Gawler Place was opened in 1884 and in 1886 the Glenelg born Virgo was appointed General Secretary following the conviction of the previous General Secretary for embezzling funds. In 1888 the YMCA began Our Boys Institute for work among boys 13 to 18 years of age. For young men, activities included Bible classes, sporting teams, lectures, debating and choral societies, a gymnasium, camps and an employment and immigration department. Virgo was prominent in Adelaide's religious life and conducted evangelistic services on Sunday evenings at the Theatre Royal in Hindley Street.1900 Virgo became secretary of the Australasian Union of Y.M.C.A.s and 1903 was appointed secretary of the Y.M.C.A., Sydney then General Secretary of the London Central Y.M.C.A. in 1911.

He also provided support for British Boys brought out to help in agriculture. He attended the 100 years of Adelaide YMCA in 1978 not long before his death in 1981 and was acclaimed as one of the great men of the organisation and the community for his life of service. 1939 - 1960 Alf Gibbs . During WW1 Alf Gibbs served as YMCA War Services Department Chief Commissioner overseeing YMCA staff in almost all military camps and some 62 representative overseas to assist the troops. Gibbs was appointed General Secretary Adelaide YMCA after some negotiations with the Adelaide YMCA Board while Alf was in India. He oversaw the expansion of the YMCA and the sale of the Gawler Place building. In 1956 he negotiated the purchase of the Presbyterian Church in Flinders Street which was demolished the following year and a new modern YMCA youth complex and residential facility was constructed. Gibbs led the fundraising that enabled the construction of YMCA youth facilities at Walkerville, Kilburn, Elizabeth and Glenelg. In 1945 \\"Loftia Park,\\" a large block of land in the lovely Mount Lofty Ranges, was purchased with swimming pool, tennis courts, sports grounds and other facilities partly completed. 1960s Graeme Irvine. Irvine was an evangelical Christian and developed in the Adelaide YMCA a group of similar thinking leaders. Ultimately this became exclusive and counterproductive. He went on to build up World Vision Australia and then to New York where he grew the organisation into a large multinational NGO. Irvine was in 1978 among the signers of the Declaration of Internationalization, which declared a set of objectives for World Vision in its operations throughout the world. In 1988, Irvine became the first non-American president of World Vision International. Jim Daly. came from Woodside army camp where he was a YMCA army officer. After his Army service he joined the Adelaide Y as Extension Secretary under Irvine having responsibility for developing boards, programmes and ensuring the viability of Walkerville, Northern Districts (Kilburn), West Croydon and Elizabeth Branches. He was a senior leader at the first Kangaroo Island Camp and many others in preceding years. They were initially organised initially by Don McCallum, Physical Education Director and in following years by Ross Baxter Glen Powell, Gary Kelly, Dean Manning, Dave Badger, Tim Looker. The Kangaroo Island Camps ran for nearly 40 years. Daly's particular interest was in Adventure Camping. He personally led groups of senior leaders on Outward Bound-type expeditions to New Zealand, Tasmania (Cradle Mountain Track, Flinders Ranges and the Grampians). Daly went on become a Senior Office, then Assistant Director in the newly formed South Australian Government Department of Tourism, Recreation and Sport. He also completed his Master of Health at UNISA. Daly continues his involvement in the Y as a Life Member. Daly wrote an Honours Thesis on ‚ÄúThe Adelaide YMCA: 1879-1934‚Äú.

Powell was a man of ideas and happy to experiment with new programme initiatives. He transformed camping into a massive co-ed programme, introduced Explorers and Adventurers which at its peak had about 1000 families involved. He set up the first child safety programme \\"Alert Assert\\" which was rolled out in schools. He negotiated the first PPP at Aberfoyle Hub which was a three way collaboration with the Council, Govt and YMCA. Other initiatives included Dollar Day a door knocking fundraiser and the City Port Fun Run which attracted thousands of runners. 1980s Trevor Cleland. Was promoted from accountant to CEO with limited success. This created a crisis which inspired the recruitment to the board of some former Y members high in the corporate world who could use there expertise to review the organisation. Clive Armour (CEO of ETSA) Colin Williamson (CEO of Strategic Resources Consulting). A restructure of the organisation and shaking off the old Methodist mentality about paying people for their 'calling'. The board upped the salary offering from $19,000 to $52,000 and went to market for a new CEO. Rob Dowling 1990? - 2003. Dowling came from Carclew Performing Arts and became our first leaders called a CEO as the others were titled General Secretaries. Dowling was a transformational leader and kept all the Y programmes running at a high level and established a Registered Training Organisation running certificate course out of the Flinders Street headquarters. With the Flinders Street property becoming outdated and run down Dowling sought to redevelop site.. A 12-story, strata titled building with the Y having some floors and selling off others. Plans were drawn by Woodhead Australia and funding partners sought. Brilliant idea but the board was not able to pull it off. The Flinders' Street property was then sold as cost of fire compliance and the age of the building proved uneconomical to refurbish. Closing the residential wing affected the organisations cash flow. Dowling sought to purchase another building, an old bank, but not supported by the Board. Dowling left to undertake teaching and research at Flinders University before retirement to the Adelaide hills. Dave Bedson: Held the position for a short time. 2000s Mike Kelly. Driven by the board policy Kelly spent his time trying to win contracts for student accommodation which was an emerging area of service due to the growing numbers of overseas students in Adelaide. This chewed up significant funds which ultimately delivered no results and the money from the sale of Flinders Street property began to diminish. Changing time saw the diminishing of the camping programme and Explorers and Adventurers. Peter Schwartz. A former footballer Schwartz did some very good work, won the Aquadome contract and set up Community Strengthening unit, after school care and negotiated access to HACC grant funding to expand YMCA social services.

The film is based on the bestseller novel titled Puzzle by Franck Thilliez. The plot revolves around Lucas (Charley Palmer Rothwell), a young man who lived through his childhood marked by the abuse of his mother and who after adult decides to create a game called Paranoia, which uses as a means to make several atrocities. The film premiered on 18 April 2019 in the United States, and 10 May 2019 in Estonia, and 10 July 2019 in VOD format.  Plot  Lucas (Charley Palmer Rothwell) and Chlo√© (Roxane Mesquida) are a former dysfunctional couple who, after having spent a year apart, meet again because Chlo√© decides to invite him to play a game called Paranoia, in which they offer a million euros to the two players who finish the game. By gathering the clues to be accepted in the game they arrive at a party, where they find a way to reach an abandoned hospital where the game will take place. Upon arrival a mysterious voice tells all the players the rules of the game and how to play, but what the mysterious voice does not tell the players is that the main rules of the game are: Number 1: Nothing is real, and Number 2 : One of you will die. When starting the game Lucas begins to notice that something was not normal and that in the game they were only trying to kill all the players, but Chlo√© refuses to believe that anyone wants to kill them all. Minutes after having passed the first test of the game, in the second test of the game they run into the corpse of one of the players, so both begin to worry and get scared. Frightened by what happened, Chlo√© and Lucas just try to finish the game to save their lives, and later in a room they find another corpse of another player and some papers where there was information about Naomi (Marie Zabukovec), who was actually admitted to the hospital abandoned years ago, and she was a totally dangerous patient. So Chlo√© deduces that she is the murderer. After having passed some tests of the game, they reach the final test, which makes them go to the abandoned hospital church, that's where Chlo√© discovers that Lucas is really the murderer and that he is a psychopath who suffers from memory loss. From what Chlo√© makes him believe that they are about to reach the end of the game, when she finds a ladder to go up to the second floor of the church, she decides pushing Lucas from the stairs and she flees the place, but he manages to find her and kill her. While he is unaware of what he was doing, he thinks he has found the murderer who killed all the players in the game, but the murderer is really himself, and that is where it is discovered that he murdered his mother and that he organized everything in the game.

Wilson has been criticised for promoting New World Order theories, anti-vaccination views, unproven supplements, anti-5G claims, and dangerous COVID-19 health advice. Early life and family Wilson was born in the United Kingdom. She worked as a Lloyds Bank manager in the UK until she began working as a self-professed psychic healer and medium, following the death of her grandfather, who she claims contacted her after his death. She moved from the UK to New Zealand in 1999. Her partner and business partner is Andrew Carter and they live in Orewa in Auckland. Mediumship and psychic healing Wilson has said that she is able to communicate with several spirits, including at least one deceased surgeon, who help her to conduct spiritual healing. Her sessions include waving her hands, which she states are possessed by spirits, while humming, stomping, and clapping. Wilson has stated that her psychic healing abilities include curing arthritis and the healing of vision impairments that require glasses. She has also stated that she has treated paralysis, blindness in one eye, and many cases of life-threatening cancer. Wilson has said she never discourages her clients from seeking medical care, however she has publicly discouraged her followers from seeking medical screening for breast cancer, stating \\"I'm not convinced about mammograms. I've had one myself but personally I wouldn't have another one. That isn't me telling you not to have them, but I know what it does to me and my body.\\" When asked whether curing people of medical conditions was accurate, Wilson replied \\"It is a fair representation of what I'm saying, but I never ever use the word cure, because that doesn't fit my framework of beliefs\\". Accused serial sex abuser and debunked faith healer Jo√£o Teixeira de Faria, AKA John of God, has been described as Wilson's mentor and she has said that they are both assisted in psychic healing by some of the same spirits. She refers her clients onto de Faria and her meditation techniques taught in workshops are from the 'Casa in Brazil'. She has described her claimed psychic abilities in the context of her Christianity, stating that they are a gift from God. She has stated that her psychic sessions always include the Lord's Prayer and the Hail Mary. In June 2020, The Spinoff reported that Wilson had told audiences at a show in Chester England that a dead surgeon called Dr Augusto de Almeida was \\"working through her\\", and she was quoted as saying: \\"I wear white so that any energies taken off the patient, the recipients of the healing, don‚Äôt contaminate my energy fields.\\" The publication also reported that Wilson said \\"Imagine being able to open up everybody‚Äôs heart centre. We don‚Äôt need any more wars. We don‚Äôt need any more vaccines. We don‚Äôt need any more 5G.\\" Media coverage and public events In 2004, Wilson was the subject of a New Zealand TV Channel Three series titled Dare to Believe. Later, she was featured on an episode of 20/20. She has written four books about her experiences as a professional medium and about other new age topics: Backstage with Jeanette Wilson, Medium Rare, Rare Moments and Dare to Believe: Explore Your Own Psychic Abilities. Wilson has held public events in the UK and in New Zealand, as well as weekend workshops and psychic surgery sessions. She also conducts private consultations. In a survey of various psychic's social media accounts in June 2020, investigator Susan Gerbic found that not only had Wilson not predicted the Covid-19 pandemic but she planned April events in the United Kingdom which had to be cancelled. According to Wilson's website the events would be rescheduled for later in 2020 but Wilson was unaware of when the UK government would allow public events again, as those dates were not yet available. Anti-science and conspiratorial claims Wilson has spread anti-vaccine messages, including a claim that vaccines are linked to Alzheimer's disease. She states that her unvaccinated children show up in photos more \\"light and clear\\" than vaccinated children. She further claims that the media and pharmaceutical industries are suppressing cancer cures, that 5G technology is a \\"weapon\\", and that drug and gambling addiction can be caused by bad spirits. The Spinoff reported that Wilson's \\"fixations read like a conspiracy theorist's crib sheet ‚Äì 5G [conspiracies], anti-vaxx, lab-created virus\\" as well as her praise of Donald Trump's dealing with such issues. The Good Thinking Society's project director, Michael Marshall, has expressed concerns that Wilson's shows may discourage people from seeking medical help while \\"wasting their money,\\" and that her anti-vaccine rhetoric may endanger children. Several venues in the UK cancelled appearances by Wilson after Marshall contacted them about these concerns. The NZ Skeptics made a similar effort to urge venues to cancel Wilson's events during her tour of New Zealand. The chair of the organisation, Craig Shearer, voiced concerns about the risk of participants forgoing medical care and suffering financial exploitation. After being contacted by Marshall, the UK Advertising Standards Authority cautioned Wilson to, according to Wilson, comply with UK regulations and \\"remove any claims to work with spirit world doctors, any videos that mention any diseases. I am only able to say that I can give people a feeling of well being.\\" In June 2020, The Spinoff reported that in an online workshop on May 28, Wilson had made numerous false and unsubstantiated claims on many topics. The workshop had been attended by investigator Susan Gerbic, who recorded the event and notified the publication. Wilson's claims included: * An unproven dietary supplement, HFI, described as a \\"soil-based, broad spectrum anti-viral supplement\\", would prevent COVID-19. She claimed \\"The virus has to attach to the lungs. The particular COVID attaches to the lungs. And what that product does is it lines the lungs, making it resistant to something attaching. That's the very best preventative I can recommend.\\" * The use of ventilators for COVID-19 treatment was misguided, and that patients \\"needed antibiotics\\" instead. * The coronavirus was man-made but was accidentally released. * The coronavirus is going to \\"miraculously disappear\\" by the end of 2020 due to mutations. In the session, Wilson claimed she had been told \\"what was happening on the planet\\" and also said that \\"last May I got a little nudge again to say, 'right, you're activated' ‚Ä¶ So by December of this year, a lot more is going to be out in the open, a lot more people are going to know exactly what is happening and what's been behind it.\\" She said the revelations will include that \\"money is being controlled by very few people. There's about 300 people that have basically been in charge of the world. And these people are going to be exposed, and their nefarious doings are being exposed as well. And as that happens, it's not going to be nice but it's going to be for ultimate good. It's like the dark is being exposed to the light.\\" Wilson also said \\"God created this body with an immune system, so I'm not a believer in vaccines...\\" Elsewhere in the video, Wilson defends Donald Trump, saying \\"He's now my hero. He's one very, very smart man, and he's doing a hell of a lot behind the scenes. He's seen through [infectious diseases expert and coronavirus taskforce member] Anthony Fauci, he's sorted out the World Health Organisation, he's stopping the 5G, he's stopping mandatory vaccines, all the key things that need to happen, he's onto it a lot more than most people realise.\\" Susan Gerbic attended an on-line workshop titled \\"Connecting with Loved Ones\\" where Wilson showed photographs that were alleged to have caught images of spirits in them. Paranormal investigator Kenny Biddle examined each photo and was able to offer alternate explanations for each. In a photo depicting the shadowy, transparent legs of a man, that Wilson claimed represented a spirit that needed removing, Biddle described how a long exposure can produce the same results. In an image showing \\"Two Orbs\\" that Wilson claimed represented \\"troublesome spirits\\", Biddle states they are the result of dust particles floating close to the lens that reflect light from sources such as a flash or sunlight. In a picture that depicted people around a grave drinking beer, there is a fuzzy, white anomaly apparently sitting on the coffin which Wilson states is the soul of the deceased laying on top of the box. Biddle counters this as being either a strand of hair on the photographer's finger or a camera strap that has entered the field of view of the lens. He states that when items fall close to the lens, they will appear washed out, if it is a bright day as was apparent in the photo, and blurry. Dietary supplements In July 2020, RNZ reported that Wilson was claiming that a bluetooth device called the Healy Resonance she sells for the starting price of $780 can dose vitamins \\"vibrationally.\\" In a sales-pitch, Wilson says \\"This is the best investment you'll probably make your whole life, for what it can do for you and your family\\". The Consumer NZ head of research said Wilson's claims were \\"a load of nonsense and unfortunately these kinds of claims are rife and enforcement is lacking which means shonky traders are making advantage of the situation\\". Physics professor Richard Easther of the University of Auckland says that claims being made about the product are not valid, and that he \\"wouldn't touch this with a barge pole.\\" A Medsafe spokesman said Healy was being sold by Wilson as a medical device, therefore its promotion via testimonial was not permitted. The statement went on to warn that consumers with serious health conditions should speak to a healthcare professional before buying a device like the Healy. At her shows, Wilson advertises a dietary supplement, called alfa PXP Royale, made from micronised black rice. The supplement is sold by Enzacta, a multi- level marketing company for which Wilson is a promoter, at a dramatic markup relative to the cost of whole purple rice sold in supermarkets or \\"micronised purple rice\\" sold online. The Spinoff reported that Wilson promotes PXP Royale as \\"the most amazing product on the face of the Earth\\", and sells jars containing 30 servings at NZD$148 each. Wilson has claimed of PXP, that \\"You can use it as a preventative or you can keep a jar in the cupboard and then if anybody in the family starts to have symptoms you can introduce it to the diet at that stage.\\" She also suggested, against all evidence, that \\"the people most at risk [from COVID-19] are obviously the younger people, as in babies and children that haven't got such a robust immune system\\". A surgeon interviewed by Australia's A Current Affair television show criticised the marketing of the supplement, stating that customers are \\"wasting their money, and for this product a large amount of money; and secondly, they may be led to believe they don't need to take their effective treatments for conditions they may actually have.\\" Despite this, Wilson claims that the \\"purple powder\\" can help elderly people \\"keep their vibrations up\\", and at one performance she invited an audience member to speak with her about the \\"best thing for scar tissue\\" off camera, so that \\"trading standards don't become all uppity.\\" Aborted political career On 11 August 2020 Wilson announced she would run for parliament against Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in the Mount Albert electorate as a candidate of the Public Party in the 2020 New Zealand general election. The Public Party had joined forces (26 July 2020) with Jami-Lee Ross's Advance NZ party, and has labelled COVID-19 a \\"plandemic\\". Wilson said \\"If I'm putting my hat in the ring and going into politics, I'm going to do it with absolute truth and absolute integrity.\\" In her announcement, Wilson accused Jacinda Ardern of treason, and revealed evidence she said could bring the election to a halt. She questioned the lawfulness of the government, saying \\"I have found something that is going to challenge our very constitution here, whether our government has the right to make the laws ‚Äì such as the Covid.\\" Constitutional lawyer Andrew Geddis, asked for his opinion on Wilson's legal pronouncements, said: > \\"This is meaningless word soup, which takes various events and documents and > strings them together in a manner that bears some superficial resemblance to > a legal claim but actually is total and utter nonsense ... I‚Äôm not going to > go through it bit by bit, because it isn't worth the resultant loss of time > and braincells ... I'll also note that these kinds of frankly unhinged sorts > of claims have been raised before.\\" Twenty-two hours later Wilson changed her mind and withdrew, saying, \\"I am guided what to do, we all are, the question is whether we listen ... This morning I was guided to withdraw from being a candidate in the forthcoming election.\\" Selected publications   See also *Energy (healing or psychic or spiritual) *Psychic healer *Taylor Winterstein (fellow PXP promoter)  References  Category:Living people Category:English emigrants to New Zealand Category:New Zealand psychics Category:Mediumship Category:Faith healers Category:Paranormal hoaxes Category:Vaccine hesitancy Category:New Zealand conspiracy theorists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jeanette Wilson"},{"id":"62654126","text":"Thomas Ives (born June 25, 1997) is an American football wide receiver for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL).

This book is about the desires and aspirations of young people and portrays the memories of a Muslim girl. Part of the novel: My Name is Maram, I'm in my 20s, a medical student... I've been in college for two years, a lot of things has changed in my life, have you grown up? Maybe! But I'm sure that intellectual maturity doesn't have much to do with age... Maybe there have been some changes in my life that make me feel the difference. Yes, the environment has changed, friends and acquaintances have changed, I have lost some of my friends and made new friends... Life does not stop and goes on... But that's not all because I'm writing my own memories! Every part of life is important and has a particular value to me, because I see that every individual is inherently distinct, because Almighty God created him or her different from other people, so every individual is exceptional and can only exist once, and this experience is unique... It seems we got into philosophical talk and got away from topic. Let's go back to the subject... Hmmm, what made me write my memoir? Yes... This book was published in Arabic in 320 pages on 2006. =Fi Qalbi Ontha Ebrya ‚ÄúIn My Heart A Jewish Girl‚Äù= The book Fi Qalbi Ontha Ebrya has been published in both Arabic and Persian. This book illustrates many contemporary issues in the Arab world such as misunderstanding about Islam and Hijab. The story revolves around Rima, a Tunisian Muslim girl who her parents died. Her mother's last words to her Jewish neighbor, Jacob, are to raise Rima as a Muslim. Jacob accepts Rima's care and Rima, a teenage girl, grows up and starts wearing Islamic veil. Jacob's wife, Tanya, who cannot tolerates with Rima's veil and finds that her Jewish children are also interested in Islamic veil because of Rima, sees Rima as a threat to her childrens and asks Jacob to choose between Rima and her family. As a result, Jacob sends Rima to his sister Rachel's home in Lebanon. There, Rachel's husband mistreated Rima then she forced to move. Afterwards, she becomes acquainted with Nada and becomes one of the agents of his conversion to Islam. A love story about coexistence between religions. This book was published in Arabic in 388 pages on 2012. =Ghorbat Al Yasmeen ‚ÄúThe Expatriation of Jasmine‚Äù= This book has been published in Arabic and in novel form.

The main character in this novel is a Muslim girl who wears a head scarf and faces problems because of it in society. This book was published in Arabic in 407 pages on 2015. Excerpt from the book: When she was asked first time about the journey ahead, her mother, Fatima, responded indirectly to her by these statements. She told her about Yasmeen's flower, which her name comes from it. She said Yasmeen's flower is always convinced to the least. This plant does not need much care. A single drop of fertilizer per each spring is enough for it. Suffice it to be slightly moist, then no irrigation is needed. All types of jasmine flowers prefer to grow in a sunny place but also tolerate the presence of shade. The Tunisian sun is suitable for blossoming and completing personality of this flower, but it has the ability to withstand the shade and cold climate of Europe. Like the Mediterranean white jasmine, which is very delicate in appearance but strong in character. Yasmeen's unique fragrance conveys a sense of sincerity that other roses lack. She did not ask about the importance of the emotions that this flower brings. She knew that giving a woman a jasmine flower sometimes meant, \\"Why didn't you ever love me?\\" Just as her father had given her, Yasmeen, to her mother. It was her father's last gift to her mother because he had been evading custody of Yasmeen after divorce. After that, her mother never accepted anyone's love because she had dedicated herself to love for Yasmeen. She increasingly felt the absence of his mother more day after day. Over time, she became more confident that she would be lost without him. She knew that being a foreigner was not an easy experience. However, he had agreed to take the trip. Her mother had taught him how to be a real jasmine, but she may have overlooked the bitter truth: When it leaves its soil, Jasmine quickly fades away and wraps itself beautifully in the dry. =An Tabqa ‚ÄúTo Stay‚Äù= This book has been published in Arabic and in novel form. The novel discusses about the hardships of immigration of Muslims and whether it is worth it. This book was published in Arabic in 383 pages on 2016. Part of the text of the book: Everything was cool and exciting until I decided to make a change in my desperate path and do something extraordinary to get me out of this absurdity hell. After that, in one of the autumn night, when I stepped on the boat that had stopped on the shore, the moonlight has faded from my life, and my life became a improvisations series of exceptional cases. From then on, I went through different adventures and endangered my life many times. I became close to the borders of death by drowning and deprived myself of justice, I even almost fell into the realm of the dead. Over and over, I found myself hoping to return to a monotonous life with no excitement. I was scared to be forgotten in a corner and die alone. I was afraid that I had ruined my normal life for nothing! =Ayn Al Mafar ‚ÄúWhere to Escape!‚Äù= This book has been published in Arabic and in novel form. The novel mainly scrutinizes the Tunisian revolution and the effects that these failed revolutions have on the people. This is part of the text: If she could paint a simple picture of her life, of course if she had been so aware, she recognized that it was all just suffering. Each suffering depicts a different path, expressing certain meanings that she was unaware of it... Every suffering had to search for the next suffering to find its way... In the meantime she was looking for a way to get rid of it and always asked: Which event, like a tornado, shook the pillars of her monotonous life?... Just when there was an incentive to keep going, everything seemed void to her... Like a fisherman who fished a fish then thrown it into the sea and wait for a bigger fish...

The twenty-ninth and final named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, the origins of Phanfone can be traced to an upper-level low which had formed near the Caroline Islands and gradually organized into a tropical depression on December 19. Moving generally west-northwestard, the system intensified into a tropical storm on December 22 and moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility on the following day as it continued gaining strength. Phanfone intensified to typhoon status shortly before making its first landfalls over the Eastern Visayas region on Christmas Eve. Further intensification ensued until Christmas Day despite Phanfone making several landfalls over the central Philippine islands, peaking at 150 km/h (90 mph) 10-minute sustained winds with a central pressure dropping to 970 hPa. Phanfone maintained its typhoon strength for several hours as it exited the Philippine landmass before unfavorable conditions caused it to rapidly deteriorate and dissipate over the South China Sea. Phanfone crossed the central Philippines after the stronger Kammuri struck nearly the same region merely weeks prior, with a track fairly similar to 2013‚Äôs Haiyan. The system caused destruction in the Visayas region, particularly over Samar, Leyte and Iloilo. The total fatalities of the said typhoon is 50 deaths (with 55 people missing, and over 300 injured) and the damages is at or roughly . Meteorological history Prior to its formation on December 19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a low pressure system to the southeast of Micronesia. Showing signs of convection and sufficient banding around a defined center, the JTWC subsequently upgraded its initial warning to a medium chance of development. Shortly thereafter on December 20, JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, while the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its first advisory on the system. By December 22, the system gained tropical storm strength and JMA issued the named Phanfone. Animated enhanced satellite loop of 2019's Typhoon Phanfone from intensification to landfall Moving generally west-northwestward, Phanfone moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) at 5:00 am PST December 23 and the Philippine weather bureau PAGASA locally named the system as Ursula. Owing to favorable conditions, Phanfone intensified further into a severe tropical storm hours later. By afternoon of December 24, Phanfone gained typhoon strength shortly before making its first three landfalls over Salcedo, Eastern Samar (4:45 pm PST), Tacloban City (7:30 pm PST), and Cabucgayan, Biliran (9:15 pm PST). Further intensification ensued until December 25, with Phanfone peaking at 00:00 UTC with 150 km/h (90 mph) 10-minute sustained winds and a central pressure dropping to 970 hPa; the JTWC reported that Phanfone peaked at 175 km/h 1-minute sustained winds, equivalent to a Category 2 typhoon. Phanfone continued its west-northwestward track and, by afternoon of the same day, PAGASA had reported four additional landfalls: Gigantes Islands (2:30 am PST), Ibajay, Aklan (8:40 am PST), Semirara Island (1:00 pm PST), and Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro (3:00 pm PST). By December 26, Phanfone had already exited the Philippine landmass, moving northwest over the South China Sea. After holding strength for several hours, the system began losing strength due to unfavorable sea surface temperatures, medium wind shear and dry air intrusion. On December 27, Phanfone dropped to tropical storm status while rapidly deteriorating and slowly moving. On December 28, PAGASA issued its final warning as the system exited the PAR; later, JMA issued their final advisories as Phanfone weakened below warning threshold. Preparations and impact =Visayas= The PAGASA issued a signal 3 warning to Northern Samar, Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Biliran and the Camotes Islands, meaning that 65-92 knot (75-106 mph; 121‚Äì170 km/h) winds were expected. The PAGASA also issued a signal 2 warning to the Visayas, meaning that 33-65 knot (38-75 mph; 61‚Äì120 km/h) winds were to be expected within 24 hours. It was issued to the central portion of northern Cebu, northeastern Iloilo, northern Antique, Capiz, Aklan, Southern Leyte, and Negros Occidental, which meant that Phanfone was taking a similar path to the areas hit by the much stronger Typhoon Haiyan. The Visayas was the worst hit, with Iloilo City having 13 casualties alone that had been either struck by fallen trees, electrocuted or drowned. Roxas, Tacloban and Maasin all received 140 mm (5.5 inches) of rain. The extent of damage in the Philippines was quite far, with the Boracay Airport being heavily damaged as many people were stranded in the airport as the typhoon struck. A disaster response officer also reported that power outages and damage in the town of Batad in Iloilo Province made it appear as a ‚Äúghost town‚Äù. Severe flooding caused devastating damage in the many provinces and islands of Visayas as rain spread across the region, with many houses and vehicles being partially to completely submerged. Multiple houses were crumpled and trees were downed, as well as power lines being downed. All of these obstacles blocked off roads and made roads dangerous to walk on; and the excessive amounts of rainfall made ground, especially higher ground, very unstable. The province of Leyte was placed under a state of calamity following the damage of the typhoon, with livestock, crops and infrastructure being damaged in excess of $1 million USD. Most of the casualties are estimated to have taken place at Iloilo, as the village was badly hit with severe and swift-moving flash floods. Tacloban was hit as fires broke out and winds allowed them to spread but it the 220,000 inhabitants escaped the worst of the system. 147 cities were affected by power outages but by Friday, December 27, 31 of those 147 had their power restored. solar eclipse on December 26. Phanfone making landfall on the Eastern Visayas on December 24 =Eastern Samar= Because of the upcoming Christmas celebrations, 16,000 passengers who had holiday plans in their respective provinces with their families, were stranded in port for their safety due to the threat of the typhoon. Upon making landfall near Salcedo in Eastern Samar around 4:45 PM, it was reported that the typhoon was causing major flooding and mudslides in the region. As the storm quickly and unexpectedly intensified, over 58,000 people were evacuated in advance of the typhoon. Five fishermen were reported missing and a 70-year-old man died after his house was swept away and as a result, he drowned. Around 2,351 people have been affected by the typhoon and 1,654 were taking refuge in evacuation centers. The World Food Programme issued advisories and infographics plotting the projected path of Phanfone, as well as evacuation and relief centers. As of December 27, 2019, there are at least 28 confirmed fatalities according to the Philippines Disaster Agency, including a 13-year-old boy who was electrocuted. =Luzon= A signal 2 warning was also issued to Luzon, with the southern portion of Quezon, Marinduque, Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro including Lubang Island, Romblon, Albay, Sorsogon, Burias Island, Calamian and Cuyo Islands all forecast to be in the path of Phanfone. A signal 1 warning was issued to Bulacan, Bataan, Metro Manila, Rizal, rest of Quezon, Laguna, Batangas, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Catanduanes and northern Palawan. The island's governor ordered local government units to conduct a forced evacuation plan, prompting civilians near flood-prone areas and areas with the potential to be affected by landslides, to relocate temporarily as a safety precaution. Local representatives visited residents in Libon, Maninila and Tandarora to advise them to evacuate and temporarily celebrate Christmas in evacuation centers for their safety. Many public schools were open in order to serve as shelters for residents while the provincial government distributed food packs to the evacuees. In Naval, the local government unit deployed evacuation tents for evacuees on Monday, December 23 with some tents reserved for senior citizens, pregnant women and people with disabilities. Personnel of the Romblon Provincial Mobile Force Company were deployed and conducted an inventory of Search and Rescue (SAR) equipment on December 23 in preparation for the typhoon. San Jose experienced 217 mm (8.64 inches) of rain in just under 24 hours. Upwards of 58,000 people were evacuated from Luzon and its surrounding islands as the system brought torrential rain and severe flash flooding ensued as a result of the rains. One family was swept away whilst trying to reach higher ground. Water and power services were completely cut off, and restoration was estimated to take weeks. Retirement Due to extensive damage done by Typhoon Phanfone in the Philippines, PAGASA announced that the name Ursula will be removed from the list of typhoon names, and the agency subsequently selected 'Ugong'; thus superseding 'Ursula'.http://bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/learning-tools/philippine-tropical- cyclone-names The name Phanfone was also retired during the 52nd annual session of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in February 2020, and a replacement name will be chosen in early 2021.
