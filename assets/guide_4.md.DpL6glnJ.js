With its top at 88 m, it is one of the many hills in the Flemish Ardennes. The road is narrow with steep bankings on either side with an asphalted surface. The steepest point is 17.1%. It was the epicenter of one of the most powerful earthquakes ever measured in Belgium, at 5.5 on the Richter scale in 1938. Cycling The hill is best known from cycling, where it regularly features the Flemish races in spring, most notably the Tour of Flanders. The uphill slopes of the Kortekeer start gently before steadily getting tougher as it winds its way through the woods. The asphalt is fairly smooth, but is usually covered in mud and gravel from the high banks. Despite its central location in the Flemish Ardennes, it is a relatively new climb in cycling races. It was first included in the Tour of Flanders in 1988, as a replacement for the nearby Koppenberg, which was deemed too dangerous for a peloton to climb. It has however never become a fixed site of the race. The climb is also regularly included in the Three Days of De Panne and E3 Harelbeke.

It is a shrub or small tree growing on many Caribbean islands both as a wild plant and cultivated in gardens.  Description  Bontia daphnoides is a shrub or small tree sometimes growing to a height of with a trunk up to in diameter. The bark is light brown, thick and grooved. Its leaves are arranged alternately, mostly long, wide, elliptic in shape with a mid-vein visible on the lower surface. They are crowded on the ends of the branches and have many small oil glands. The flowers are arranged singly in the axils of leaves on a stalk long. There are 5 egg-shaped, green pointed sepals which have hairy edges and the petals are joined at their bases to form a tube long. The tube has two lobes of different sizes and the lower one is rolled back and covered on its upper surface with a dense layer of purple hairs. The tube is yellowish-brown and covered with many raised oil glands on the outside. Flowers are present for most of the year and are followed by fruits which are roughly spherical with a small beak, pale yellow at first but drying to brown. Bontia daphnoides leaves and fruits Taxonomy and naming Bontia daphnoides was first formally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus and the description was published in Species Plantarum. The specific epithet (daphnoides) possibly refers to the similarity of this species to plants in the genus Daphne. The species has many common names depending on the language spoken on the island where it is found. The name white alling is used in the Virgin Islands and wild olive in Barbados. Other names include olivier bord de mer (Martinique), mang blanc (Haiti), mangle (Puerto Rico) and aceituna americana (Cuba).  Distribution and habitat Bontia daphnoides occurs on most of the islands in the Caribbean and on the coasts of Venezuela and Guyana. It is naturalised in Florida. It grows it coastal areas, often near mangroves where it is often the dominant plant. Use in horticulture White alling is grown as a hedge or as a feature plant, especially in areas exposed to salt spray and are common in places like the coasts of Guyana. There are also grown in the high Andes of Venezuela and often occur as garden escapees.

Operating from about 1924 to 1940, the property is the best-preserved of a significant number of fox farms established by brothers Frank and Fred Gordon in Lincoln. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Description and history The Gordon Fox Ranch is located in a rural area of western Lincoln, on the south side of West Broadway. The property is more than in size, of which less than were ever cleared, the rest being forested. A cluster of buildings, some historic and some not, are set a short way south of the road. Nonhistoric buildings include a 1950s garage and a house built in 2006. Behind the garage stands a three-story square wood frame tower, which has inward-sloping sides through two levels, with a vertically-walled third level with windows in each face. Across the driveway from the garage stands a historic ranch house (set in front of the modern house); it is a 1-1/2 story wood frame building, with a saltbox profile distinctive to the Gordon's fox ranching operations. This house was built in 1924. The property also includes a nearly-complete berm, surrounding a space that would originally have been fenced off as the space where the foxes were raised. Behind the houses stands a small wood frame structure that originally served as the ranch office. When built, it was originally attached to the observation tower, but was separated in order to effect repairs on both structures. It is believed to be the only known surviving office building from one of these ranching operations. Silver fox pelts were long a highly valued fur, significantly exceeding in value that of beaver. Ranching of the animals was made possible by the successful breeding of them in captivity on Prince Edward Island in the 1890s, and ranching operations gradually spread afterward. In the 1920s brothers Fred and Frank Gordon (of Lincoln and Bangor) purchased numerous tracts of land in Lincoln and other communities of northern New England, and established ranching operations on a standardized plan. In Lincoln the brothers are known to have built at least ten such operations between 1924 and 1926, when their enterprise went bankrupt. The properties included a small house for the caretaker to live in, a fenced area for the foxes, and an observation tower from which the behavior of the animals could be monitored. This particular farm was probably used until about 1940 for fox farming, by a variety of owners.

She works as a mail carrier. Mado also teaches at a local school, where she tells fables to children. She is innocent and pure like a child and is dreaming of a beautiful prince. One day director Jean-Marie Zeleni (Oleg Yankovsky) comes to the village to search for locations for his new film, and thus becomes the \\"prince\\" for Mado. She immediately invites him to dinner, but realizing her unattractiveness, takes with herself her friend Germain (Isabelle G√©linas), a local prostitute. The slim and charming Germain immediately evokes the director's liking, and Mado can only observe their relationship. Then it turns out that the object of Mado's girlish dreams is a failed film director who shoots now commercials instead of feature films. Having filmed the next ad, he leaves, and Mado has only to watch from afar his touching farewell to Germain.

The concept was developed by Priscilla Laws, a physics professor at Dickinson College, and developed in partnership with Atari, Inc.. The AtariLab Starter Set with the Temperature Module was released in late 1983, and followed by the add-on Light Module in February 1984. Several other modules were planned for future release. The system was just coming onto the market when Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel and all development on the system ended. By this time the development company organized by Laws had ported the system to the Commodore 64 and Apple II. Small numbers of the Atari and C64 versions were sold commercially, but the Apple II version was never completed. The company went on to produce a professional version of the system for the IBM PC platform, which sold tens of thousands of examples. History Impetus AtariLab came about after Laws saw a thermistor dipped into ice water being sampled and graphed on an expensive laboratory system. Instead of having to periodically sample a thermometer and then use the data to produce a graph, the computer was creating this in real time, and \\"it blew me away.\\" Considering a common experiment carried out by students, producing a cooling curve for hot water, the system would reduce perhaps 15 to 20 minutes of work to a few moments. This would free up so much time the students would be able to carry out multiple experiments in a typical lab period, perhaps testing the effects of insulation, or producing curves for different materials in a single sitting. Development Laws began using similar devices in her teaching lab, and as Laws's son owned an Atari 8-bit computer, began development of a recording and graphing system on that platform. The Atari was ideal for the task for two reasons. One was because it had a high-resolution graphics mode that was, at the time of introduction, one of the best displays available and easily accessed through Atari BASIC. Another was that the engineers had equipped it with joystick ports of unusual flexibility, which allowed them to be used as a general purpose voltage sampling input. Combining a simple sampling board with software written by a 15-year-old middle-school student, David Egolf, the basic concept was quickly developed. Laws approached Atari with the idea of commercializing the system, and found a receptive audience in Leslie Wolf, Atari's product manager for Atari Logo and other educational materials, and a middle manager, Mike Nalblah. Forming a company to develop the concept, Laws received some funding from the University and began development. Laws flew to Atari several times to discuss the concept, how to package it and what sort of course material to include. The AtariLab Starter Set with the Temperature Module was released in late 1983, with the Light Module following soon after in February 1984. The system received considerable press, and won the Software of the Year Award for 1984 from Classroom Computer Learning magazine. Articles written at the time talked about Biofeedback, Timekeeper, Lie Detector, Reaction Time, pH, and different Mechanic modules. but the only other module under active development at the time was a Motion Module that used an ultrasonic motion sensor for various dynamics experiments. By early 1984, the effects of the North American video game crash of 1983 left Atari in turmoil, and the company was losing over a million dollars a day. The owners, Warner Communications, became desperate to sell the company, and eventually did so to Jack Tramiel, on 1 July 1984, for $50 cash and $240 million in promissory notes. The AtariLab system was caught up in the confusion, and Wolf was laid off. Production continued only because Wolf noticed that no one knew who was paying the salaries of the small production team, and she told them to keep working until their paychecks stopped arriving. After Atari By this time, Laws's holding company had released the Commodore 64 version, but Commodore was soon in similar turmoil. The Apple II version never shipped. With the market rapidly moving to the IBM PC, they decided to refocus on that platform. Continuing work on the basic concept, Laws began to develop Workshop Physics, an introductory physics course based entirely on computerized labwork instead of lectures. She partnered with Ron Thornton of Tufts University and Robert Tinker of the Technical Education Research Centers, and began development of the coursework. Looking for someone to build an adaptor, she contacted a former Atari colleague, Ron Budworth, who had since semi-retired in Silicon Valley. As it became clear that the program had wide appeal, Tinker and the TERC claimed ownership over the design. Laws's attorney ultimately relied on a recent Supreme Court case about a sculpture of Martin Luther King, Jr. The court decided that basic descriptions, i.e. \\"a sculpture of MLK\\", did not imply ownership of the ultimate expression of the idea. Accordingly, as Budworth had carried out all of the actual development of an idea amounting to \\"an analog adaptor for the Atari port\\", the design was considered his. Development of the interface continued and they ultimately made a distribution deal with friends who had recently formed Vernier Software and Technology to market into this field. Budworth produced the boards and sold them through Vernier as the ULI, short for Universal Laboratory Interface. Sales ultimately ran to 40,000 units before newer designs made it obsolete. Vernier remains the leading worldwide supplier of computerized data collection equipment. The courses originally developed as part of the Workshop Physics program have since developed into a whole suite of similar programs and books. Description The system being used to measure the temperature of a glass of water. The Atari computer's POKEY chip includes eight potentiometer (\\"pot\\") input lines, connected to eight capacitors and then in pairs to four joystick ports, each port containing two input lines. (Number of ports was later reduced to two in newer computer models). These lines were originally intended to connect up to eight paddle controllers. A paddle consisted of a potentiometer, whose two terminals would connect to the joystick port's +5V pin on one side, and a pot input pin on the other. Thus the paddle's setting influenced time it would take the capacitor to charge fully. POKEY would measure these times for each of the eight paddles, and present them as values (between 0 and 228) in its POT0-POT7 registers. Writing to POKEY's POTGO register would reset the chip's counters, allowing to repeat the measurement. The AtariLab hardware consisted largely of a single circuit board that broke out the pins in the joystick port into RCA jacks. The adaptor was about the size of a contemporary multimeter, and like those, had a stand on the back so it stood up at an angle on a desktop. The RCA jacks were color coded and matched the colors on the ends of the plugs on the probes. Setting up a probe required nothing more than plugging into the same-colored socket and then running the associated software, supplied on ROM cartridge. The only other feature of the adaptor was a red LED that indicated power was available, which was true whenever it was plugged in and the computer was turned on. The associated software had a variety of modes, including a real-time display and a recording chart. In the case of the Temperature Module, for instance, the system could display a thermometer showing the instantaneous temperature, or a strip chart continually recording the temperature over time. The system was controlled mainly through a joystick plugged into one of the other ports. Since the POT0-POT7 registers could also be read from Atari BASIC using \`PEEK\` commands, writing custom software for the system was a simple task.

Crichton moved to Turku at the age of 23 to lead a steam engine construction project at Cowie and Eriksson, a local engineering company. After two years, he moved to Helsinki to work for Fiskars, but because of the Crimean War he was arrested due to his nationality and transferred to Saint Petersburg. He was soon released with help from family connections and he remained working for Izhorsk Works for eight years. In 1862, Crichton returned to Turku after receiving an offer to buy half of Cowie & Eriksson Company. The company was renamed W:m Crichton & C:o and under Crichton's leadership it developed into the largest company in Turku. The company built predominantly ships and steam engines and its main customer was the Imperial Russian Navy. Crichton led the company until his death in 1889. He was survived by twelve children who soon sold the company to investors. Crichton's name remained in use until 1965.  Early life  Crichton was born in Leith, Scotland. His father George Crichton was a shipowner, whose company became one of the first steam ship companies in Scotland. Its ships operated between Leith and London. Crichton's mother, n√©e Allan, was also from Leith; her father was a log dealer, whaler and shipowner. He had four brothers and one sister. His older brothers Alexander and Edward studied at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich and were then employed by Scottish engineering companies. The example set by his older brothers inspired Crichton. He studied in Leith until he was ten years old, after which he went on to Hill Street Institution, Edinburgh where he graduated at the age of 14. His father died in 1841. Crichton followed his brother Alexander to Greenock, where he worked as an intern at Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company. After two years he moved to Shotts Iron Company where his brother Edward worked. When this engineering works was closed, Crichton moved to Glasgow where he worked for Robert Napier and Sons as a draftsman. In 1848 he went to sea to work as an engineer on SS Royal Victoria, which operated between London and Granton. During the winter season he studied, and in the following year he worked on SS Isabella Napier. While his brothers Alexander and Edward often worked at different occupations, Crichton's interest was focused on designing and drafting.  First years in Turku  In the summer of 1850 Crichton received a letter from the Finnish engineering company Cowie and Eriksson offering him a position as supervisor on a three-year contract. It is not known how the company found him. 23-year-old Crichton jumped at the opportunity since he had planned for a long time to move to Russia, where his granduncle Sir Alexander Crichton and cousin Sir William Crichton had already made their careers. Imperial Russia, which was developing its merchant shipping fleet, had attracted many British specialists since the 18th century, and the British population in Saint Petersburg was in the thousands. Many of them were in high positions and members of the upper class. Although the offer did not come from Saint Petersburg, but the smaller city of Turku in southwestern Finland with a population of 13,000, Crichton probably saw it as an opportunity to gain a toehold in Russia. Imperial Russian steam frigate Rurik at Turku Old Shipyard. Crichton was engaged to lead a project to construct a steam engine that was to be mounted on the steam frigate Rurik, the biggest ship built in Finland to date. The yard, Gamla Warfsbolaget i √Öbo, (\\"old shipbuilding company in Turku\\"), was the most important customer of Cowie & Eriksson. They were located close to each other on the opposite banks of the Aura River. Crichton did not like the heavy work which was hampered by poor tools. Moreover, the company owners David Cowie and Anders Thalus Eriksson did not get along. When Crichton fell seriously ill, Cowie's wife took care of him. He got to know her brother, Samuel Owen Jr., the son of engineer Samuel Owen, who had played an important role in industrialising Sweden. Owen Jr. had moved to Turku a few years earlier to lead the same project Crichton was working on and lodged at his sister's home. After recovering in spring or early summer 1851, Crichton left for a holiday in Sweden where he met Mr. Fletcher a relative of Mrs. Owen. Fletcher introduced him to Motala Verkstad, the most significant Swedish steam engine producer. Crichton also met Owen's oldest daughter Annie Elizabeth and was smitten by her. When Owen's wife and four children moved to Turku in 1852, they met each other again and became engaged the following year. Their intention was to marry after the shipbuilding project was completed.  Project in Helsinki, arrest and transfer to Saint Petersburg  Crichton signed a new contract with Fiskars which planned to open a facility in Helsinki. He travelled to England in the autumn of 1853 to purchase the needed machinery, and returned in January 1854 to oversee its installation in Hakaniemi. But global politics interfered with the project. The United Kingdom and France entered the Crimean War against Russia on 28 March. The war made importing machinery impossible and, as a British citizen, Crichton decided to return to the UK to wait until the war ended. The same evening he went to pick up his passport, military and Finnish police waited for him, told him to collect his drawings and notes, and ordered him to leave for Saint Petersburg with the papers, which travelled with him, in a sealed envelope. He was escorted by an officer and a policeman. When Crichton arrived in the city he was treated well but was not allowed to leave the arrest room. After spending few days under arrest, he asked for permission to talk to the department leader. When Crichton asked if they had found anything sensitive in his papers the answer was negative, but he was told that he was going to be sent to Moscow. Crichton mentioned his granduncle Sir William Crichton, who had worked before as a doctor for Grand Duke Nicholas, before he had become Tsar Nicholas II. The department leader answered that this might change the decision and advised him that the case would be investigated. As a result, Crichton was released and sent just twenty miles away from the city to Sir William Crichton who welcomed him warmly. Crichton spent two months with his granduncle during which time he met General Alexander Wilson, who was managing the state-owned Alexandrosk factory and Izhorsk Works in Kolpino. Wilson hired Crichton as chief engineer in Kolpino. Soon after he also organised a place for Samuel Owen who had had to leave the Rurik project after the outbreak of the war; Owen moved to Kolpino with his family. Crichton had finally achieved his dream: a good position in a state-owned engineering company.  Kolpino years  William Crichton and Annie Elizabeth Owen were married in the English church in Saint Petersburg in November 1854. The family grew during the following years with the birth of their daughter Louisa in 1856, followed by sons George in 1858, William Jr. in 1860, and Alexander Owen in 1862. Crichton did not leave notes about his role in the Izhorsk Works, but some conclusions can be drawn from the order books, Crichton's specialisation, and a few other pieces of information. Following defeat in the Crimean War, the Russian Navy ordered new armoured ships with cannon turrets, powered by steam engines which used propellers; the minimum speed requirement was 15 knots. This required very powerful steam engines, with high-pressure boilers, representing the latest technology. It is noteworthy, that the second child George was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. This indicates that Crichton had been there for a some length of time since he had taken his family with him. A third important fact is that Crichton was awarded the Great Golden Medal with Stanislaus ribbons around 1860; this was a significant award. It appears that Crichton had travelled to the UK to gather information about the latest steam technology, which he could do relatively easily as a UK citizen using his existing contacts. Further speculation suggests the technology was successfully applied to the powerful engines built in Izhorsk and this was the reason Crichton received the award.  Return to Turku  In 1862 Crichton received a letter from local businessman Erik Julin of Turku. He advised Crichton that he had bought Anders Thalus Eriksson's shares in Cowie & Eriksson and that David Cowie was ready to sell his. Julin was seeking a capable business partner who would run the company with him and suggested to Crichton that he purchase Cowie's shares. After a lengthy discussions Crichton bought the other half of the company from Cowie for 32,810 silver roubles.  W:m Crichton & C:o  House in which Crichton lived with his family in Turku. The company was now renamed W:m Crichton & C:o and Crichton became the managing director. The family moved into a wooden house located at It√§inen Rantakatu 56, next to the factory and the Aura River. Crichton, now age 35, had now become owner and manager of a company where he could use his abilities. He enlarged the company portfolio to include steam ships and he built a new ship cradle by the river in 1864; a few years later he built a larger one next to the original. He replaced old machinery with modern equipment which was most likely purchased from the UK. The Foundry was enlarged and new workshops were built. As the company still built wooden ships, Crichton invested in a steam-powered sawmill that was located next to the river downstream from the other buildings. In the meantime, the Turku Old Shipyard on the other side of the river built the largest shipbuilding cradle in Finland. The 1850s, 1860s and 1870s was a period of rapid development and economic deregulation. The Companies Act as well as the Banking Act were laid down in 1864 and, at the same time, Finland introduced its own currency, the Finnish mark. Customs duties were reduced, and a railway network started to develop. The Estates were called in 1863 and were soon followed by municipal administration reform. Despite setbacks, such as the famine of 1866‚Äì68, the atmosphere was positive: Finns were looking ahead and wanted to develop their country. W:m Crichton & C:o had a steady flow of orders and the company continued to grow. Crichton had good contacts in Saint Petersburg; about twenty per cent of the company's orders came from Finland, the rest came from the Russian military and civil customers. Crichton kept his British citizenship and, soon after settling down in Turku, he was appointed Her Majesty's Vice Consul in Turku and √Öland. During the Kolpino years he had learned to speak Russian and in Turku he used Swedish, which was widely spoken then. Due to the financial risk caused by the growing size and value of ships, Crichton and Julin decided to secure their personal property by changing the company's legal status to a limited company in 1874. Julin died in the same year, after which a trading house operated by his son John Julin became owner. During subsequent years the Russian military became W:m Crichton & C:o's most important customer. A major development was an order for six torpedo boats which were delivered in 1878. Crichton family grave in Turku. It was unusual that a small company like W:m Crichton & C:o could compete against the large Saint Petersburg shipyards for navy orders. The military's purchasing process, and those of other public institutions, was complex and a successful business required both strong credibility and the right contacts. Evidently, the connections Crichton had made in Kolpino helped him, but to obtain orders he had to give something in return, which meant corruption. Moreover, Crichton presumably collected information about the latest technology during his journeys to the UK and passed it along to the Russian Navy. In 1877 he was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus. In 1883 he took over the nearby Turku Old Shipyard but it is unclear how he was able to finance this acquisition. The time fits with the Russian decision to build a torpedo boat fleet, so perhaps Crichton travelled to the UK in the mid-1870s to gather knowledge about torpedo boat technology. Another peculiar detail is that when the Russian Navy ordered 100 torpedo boats, mainly from the navy yards, six of them were ordered from Crichton, which was the only privately owned shipbuilder involved in this order. During the late 1870s Crichton met the Welsh-born engineer John Eager in Saint Petersburg, whom he recruited to his own company. Eager's specialty was fast vessels, such as torpedo boats. During the following years W:m Crichton & C:o built a number of relatively small fast vessels, which were built in two large wooden sheds the company erected on the former premises of the Old Shipyard. Also larger vessels were built, such as two oil tankers for the Caspian Sea and the gun boat Bobr which was ordered for the Russian Pacific Fleet. With the takeover of the Old Shipyard, W:m Crichton & C:o became the largest company in Turku with 936 employees and 1,589,000 marks turnover. During the time of William Crichton's death in April 1889, the company had a numerous orders. John Eager was appointed company manager. None of Crichton's twelve children were interested in continuing the business and his shares were sold to investors. Crichton's name remained in use by the Turku shipbuilding industry until 1965 with the name of his company as well as by the Ab Crichton and Crichton-Vulcan companies.

From the 1520s Dutch Protestants started to fragment, with the Anabaptists as the first to create a rift. From 1530 to 1550 the Anabaptist movement acted as the Reformation's arm and mouthpiece. Their followers were persecuted which created disagreement among them as to how to handle this, either by taking up arms to resist or passive defiance. On the pacifist side, the followers of David Joris were the bigger group in the 1530s, and the followers of Menno Simons, called Mennonites, the smaller, and mainly in Friesland and Groningen. But by the 1540s the Mennonites had become the mainstream of Dutch Anabaptism. The Mennonites fragmented even further into subgroups. Menno tried to heal the split in 1557 but failed. In Flanders Flemish Anabaptism grew strongly in the 1550s, inspired by Menno's teachings, but at great cost, with hundreds of executions. When the Duke of Alva came to Flanders, many migrated to the north. This created tensions between various groups of Anabaptists regarding doctrine, organisation, and life-style. Flemish Anabaptism was now no longer a reference to geographical location of the group but one of confessional bloc. Dirk Philips became the leader of the 'Flemish' Anabaptists, although he was not Flemish. By the 1580s the Flemish Anabaptists had further subdivided into hardline and moderate factions, Old Flemish and Young Flemish. Haarlem in particular was a city where in the 1590s all six blocs of Dutch Anabaptism existed: Waterlanders, Old Frisians, Old Flemish, Young Frisians, Young Flemish and High Germans. Salomon van Ruysdael and, probably, his brother Isaack van Ruisdael, father of Jacob van Ruisdael, belonged to the Haarlem Young Flemish. In 1632 most Old Flemish reunited with the Young Flemish. Subsequently these United Flemish merged with a faction of Young Frisians. By the 1640s the great majority of the 75,000 Dutch Anabaptists belonged to either the new moderate conservative bloc of United Flemish, Frisians, High Germans or Waterlanders.

Plot Fenn, the domineering second officer of a merchant ship, is attempting to recruit an extra hand in the London docks for a voyage to Singapore but due to his harsh reputation he can find no volunteers. Eventually he manages to persuade a drunken, middle-class man who has apparently fallen down on his luck to sign on to the ship. Aboard ship the well-spoken \\"Gentleman\\" Burton attracts the interest of the captain's daughter Paddy who is curious at his mysterious past. This enrages Fenn who is desperate to marry her, despite her dislike of his rough manners, and he tries to bribe Burton to desert at their first port of call to remove a rival for her love. When Burton refuses to do so, Fenn arranges for local criminals to kidnap him, but is compelled by Paddy to rescue him which he successfully does. When the ship arrives at an island to take on supplies, the ship becomes embroiled in a plan by a group of British criminals living on the island to steal some diamonds from a local shopkeeper. The captain agrees to carry the diamonds to safety in Singapore, but the criminals board and take over the ship to get their hands on the diamonds, threatening to kill the surviving crew. Fenn and Burton join forces to repulse the boarders and the ship gets safely to Singapore where Burton and Paddy agree to marry, after he reveals that he quit his previous life as a respectable doctor due to a woman.

This Andronicus is probably the same as the son of Agerrhus mentioned by ArrianArrian, The Anabasis of Alexander iii. 23. and Diodorus Siculus:Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica xix. 69, 86 that is, the same Andronicus who accompanied Alexander the Great on his expedition in Asia, and was the father of Proteas of Macedon and husband to Lanike. If this is indeed the same Andronicus, he would also be the father of two sons, whose names are lost to us now, who died at Miletus in 334. This conflation is unclear, however, and this Andronicus may have been distinct from another Andronicus of Macedon. In 330, Andronicus was sent by Alexander to take command of 1500 Greek mercenaries who had served under Darius III before the latter's death; he was accompanied by former Darius loyalist Artabazos II of Phrygia. Andronicus was then sent against the rebellious Persian satrap Satibarzanes, along with Artabazos, Caranus, and Erigyius. Andronicus was one of the four generals appointed by Antigonus I Monophthalmus to form the military council of Antigonus' son, the young Demetrius I of Macedon, in 314. He commanded the right wing of the army of Demetrius at the Battle of Gaza in 312, and after the loss of the battle, and the subsequent retreat of Demetrius, was left in command of the city of Tyre. He refused to surrender the city to Ptolemy I Soter, and in response to Ptolemy's requests sent Ptolemy insulting and contemptuous messages. Andronicus later lost the city due to a popular insurrection of its inhabitants as the city's provisions ran low during the long siege. Ptolemy captured Andronicus, but spared his life, treating him as a friend, despite Andronicus having treated him with such insolence, turning the general from a stubborn enemy into a partisan.

Description The island occupies an area and is situated from the mainland. The island has a maximum elevation of . It is composed of limestone and is linked to Edwards Island by intertidal and subtidal reef platforms. Both islands are gazetted as A Class nature reserves. The island has a large beach on the landward side of the island and a smaller beach on the seaward side. The waters off the western side of the island are also a protected area, the Lancelin Island Lagoon Fish Habitat Protection Area, made up of areas of seagrass and reef systems. Along with Edwards Island it is at the southern end of the Turquoise Coast islands nature reserve group, a chain of 40 islands spread over a distance of . Origin and history The island was formed approximately 10,000 years ago after large fluctuations in sea levels caused erosion on large areas of the continental shelf during periods of glaciation. Large parallel sand dunes then formed and hardened into limestone, forming islands, most of which have been separated from the mainland for 6,500 years. The Noongar peoples are the traditional inhabitants of the Lancelin area. The first European to find and name the island was the French explorer Hamelin in 1801 aboard Naturalist. It was named after the scientific writer, P.J. Lancelin. During the 1920s the area became popular as a holiday destination, with many shacks appearing on the mainland. During World War II the island was used by the Royal Australian Air Force for bombing practice. The crayfishing industry commenced operations in the area in 1947. Flora and fauna The island has a high diversity of plants and supports over 50 plant species. The vegetation is mostly close to the ground and composed mostly of salt-tolerant grasses and shrubs. Sandier places are dominated by a low heath with shallower soils over limestone areas supporting herbfields and grasslands. The nitre bush covers the slopes and plateau of the island. Sea birds are known to inhabit the island with some species using the island as a breeding site. The Lancelin Island skink (Ctenotus lancelini ), a threatened species of lizard, is endemic to and named after the island.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Klein has worked at the Karolinska Institute since leaving Hungary in 1947. She is regarded as a founder of cancer immunology. Her life and career choices as a young Jewish woman were constrained by discrimination, and she survived the late stages of German occupation in hiding. A medical doctor with a PhD in biology, she has worked in cancer immunology and virology. In the 1960s, she led the discovery of natural killer cells and developing Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. In 1975, the U.S. Cancer Research Institute established the William B. Coley Award for Distinguished Research in Basic and Tumor Immunology. The inaugural award was shared by 16 scientists considered to be \\"founders of cancer immunology\\", including Eva and George Klein. Their award noted their \\"discoveries of tumor-specific antigens in the mouse, to the most comprehensive immunological analysis of a human cancer, Burkitt's lymphoma\\". She has pursued her own lines of work as well as working closely with her husband, George Klein. They are both regarded as founders of cancer immunology. They have three children. Early life and education Eva Fischer was born on 22 January 1925 in Budapest, Hungary, to a well-to-do Jewish family. She attended private school, with an interest in sports, theater, and science (inspired by the life and work of Marie Curie). Her career choices were constrained by the political situation, with worsening anti-semitism and persecution when Hungary was occupied by Germany after she finished secondary school. Fischer attended medical school at the University of Budapest, and in 1944/45 she and several members of her family survived by hiding at the Histology Institute of the University of Budapest. They were helped by J√°nos Szirmai, including forging documents. Szirmai was honored as one of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Fischer broke from her medical studies to act in the theater, but returned to medicine. Eva married another medical student George Klein, leaving Hungary to live in Sweden in 1947. She completed her medical degree at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden in 1955. In addition, Klein has been awarded honorary degrees from the University of Nebraska (in 1993) and the Ohio State University (in 2003). Career Klein became an assistant professor at the Karolinska Institute in 1948, and achieved tenure in 1979. She established her own areas of research from 1948 encouraged by Torbj√∂rn Caspersson from Karolinska's Department of Cell Research and Genetics, while also collaborating closely with her husband throughout her career. Eva Klein has published over 500 papers, and served as an editor of the journal, Seminars in Cancer Biology. Personal life Both Klein and her husband George Klein worked as they studied for their medical degrees in Stockholm. They had three children: the eldest is a son who is a mathematician, followed by two daughters, one of whom is a medical doctor and the other a playwright. She defended her PhD thesis when she was eight months pregnant with her second child. Even with live-in help, managing her scientific career and raising three children was a struggle. She has said that her husband was unsupportive of household and childrearing work. Post- retirement, Klein continues to support students and pursue her research interests as emerita Professor with her own research Group. Another of her interests is translating Hungarian poetry into Swedish. She gave an interview to Swedish radio in November 2015, saying that continuing to work keeps her young at 90. The Kleins undertook wide-ranging pioneering work, jointly and separately, in cancer immunology and how cancer cells' malignant behavior can be suppressed by genes in normal cells. Major achievements and honors In the 1960s, Eva Klein developed cell lines from Burkitt's lymphoma that continue to be used. In the 1970s, the Kleins' research groups were investigating whether there was an interaction between lymphocytes and antitumor response. Eva pursued an area she considered critical, while others did not. She jointly supervised three students (Rolf Kiessling, Hugh Pross and Mikael Jondal) with another Professor (Hans Wigzell), leading to the discovery of a unique type of lymphocyte (white cell) responsible for spontaneous cytotoxicity - the ability to \\"kill\\" tumor cells or cells infected with viruses. Klein named them \\"natural killer cells\\". Klein has had a longstanding interest in virology as well as immunology, studying the role of the Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus in Burkitt's lymphoma. Klein became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1987 and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1993. In 2013, she was elected to fellowship of the American Association for Cancer Research Academy. In 2005, the year of the Kleins' 80th birthdays, scientists at the Karolinska Institute established the George and Eva Klein Foundation, including a major donation from the Cancer Research Institute.

In the U.S., she became a pioneer in the psychotherapeutic use of hypnosis. She earned her medical degree in 1923 from the Medical University of Vienna. Continuing her research there, Dr. Klemperer was one of six women physicians working for Julius Wagner-Jauregg in 1927 when he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. All six women being of Jewish descent, they were forced to flee Austria under the Nazis. Among them were Drs. Alexandra Adler, one of the first women neurologists at Harvard University; Fanny Halpern, a founder of psychiatry in Shanghai; and Annie Reich, a leading psychoanalyst in post-war New York. In the 1930s, Wagner-Jauregg, their employer, embraced ideas of racial hygiene and eugenics, becoming a fervent Nazi. Fluorescent Brain Model Escaping from Austria, Dr. Klemperer arrived in New York in September 1939 with the clothes on her back, $2 in cash, and her large neon model of the human brain. Her \\"Luminous Brain,\\" which she invented in 1931 and patented in 1934, was designed to demonstrate the brain's electrical impulses to medical students and science-oriented members of the public. Popular Science magazine described her invention as the product of years of research, \\"entirely made of glass, hundreds of tubes being manipulated into the form of the brain's parts.\\" Patent for the Luminous Brain Model, 1934 Controlled by an electric switchboard, the model brain could demonstrate flashes of thought, automatic movements like breathing, and the disordered neural impulses associated with various mental illnesses. Newspapers from the U.S. to Australia reported on the model, whose glass tubes illuminated eleven different parts of the brain in \\"blue, green, crimson, purple, pink and yellow lights, an orgy of sparkling colour.\\" Klemperer's Luminous Brain was part of a trend in sophisticated 3D anatomical models, designed to be both visually dazzling and educational. Transparent Man, a three-dimensional anatomical model of the human body, drew hundreds of thousands of visitors when exhibited at the Chicago World's Fair (see Century of Progress) in 1933. Made by the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden, Germany, the Transparent Man model was commissioned by the Mayo Clinic. Today, neuroscientists continue to create 3D models of the brain, using light to show its electrical activity. One example, \\"Glassbrain Flythrough 2015,\\" which uses data from MRIs and EEGs, was created by the Neuroscape Lab at the University of California, San Francisco. Research and Hypnotherapy During her years as a researcher in Vienna, Dr. Klemperer published 24 papers, nine of them coauthored with Dr. Max Weissmann, on such topics as: chemical analyses of blood and cerebrospinal fluid in psychiatric and brain disorders; the use of insulin to manage delirium tremens; Korsakoff syndrome after insulin treatment of diabetics; and the body's response to hypnosis.

In New York during the 1940s, Dr. Klemperer was a senior psychiatrist with Bellevue Hospital. She then went on to pioneer the use of hypnosis, hypnotherapy and hypnoanalysis. As early as 1953, she used hypnosis to help people quit smoking tobacco. In the 1950s and 1960s, she published several papers in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis on such topics as hypnosis technique, primary-object relationships under hypnosis, and the ability of hypnotherapy to alter body image. She also lectured at the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis. In 1968, she published her book Past Ego States Emerging in Hypnoanalysis.

It was built in 1877 to transport patrons from Christchurch to the Riccarton Racecourse in the suburb of Riccarton; this was (and remains) a place used for both racing and for outdoor events. The line was promoted as a private enterprise by the Canterbury Jockey Club, and the assistance was sought by the government. Lancelot Walker, a former member of parliament, was sent to Wellington to negotiate the matter with John Davies Ormond, the Minister of Public Works. The businessman George Stead, as honorary secretary of the Canterbury Jockey Club from 1873 for over 30 years, was a promoter of the idea of making the horse racing ground more accessible, and to increase turnover. The line was surveyed in early October 1877 and opened four weeks later on 3 November 1877. The contractor who carried out the works was William Stokes, who had in the previous year built the bridge over the Waimakariri Gorge. The line had competition from Christchurch trams in the 20th century; although slower the trams ran right into Cathedral Square in the centre of Christchurch. The last race train ran on 10 November 1954, and the line was lifted soon after. It remained private over the course of its existence and never belonged to the New Zealand Railways Department.

She is a winner of the CBC Creative Nonfiction Prize, the Sheila A. Egoff Children's Literature Prize, and the Arthur Ellis Award, as well as various other awards and recognitions. Although known for her YA writing, Mac also writes adult fiction, leads writing workshops for adults and youth, and contributes to literary journals. She is also the resident writer/reader for The Story Forest, a collection of audio stories for children. Early life, education, and employment Mac was born in Kamloops, British Columbia. During her childhood and youth, Mac lived in Vancouver, Grand Forks, Abbotsford and on the Sunshine Coast. Mac's first job, at age seven, was to read the Bible to an ex-Son of Freedom; she was paid a quarter a page. Mac dropped out of high school in Grade eleven, completing her secondary education by correspondence. She trained as a paramedic at the Justice Institute of British Columbia. Mac also worked at various times as a sign language interpreter, a bookstore clerk, and a child and youth advocate in a transition house. Influences and inspiration A self-confessed book- aholic, Mac credits Louise Fitzhugh, author of Harriet the Spy, with the realization of \\"what kind of power words carry, and how they can be used to sharpen your own identity and injure others.\\" Other influences include: Anne Cameron, Margaret Atwood, Alice Munro. Mac explains that Raymond Carver showed her that \\"the lives of working class people (my people) are filled with stories worth writing about too, and that you don't need to go on and on and on and on to relate human emotions when you can nail it down so adroitly with less.\\" Writing for reluctant readers Pain and Wastings, Jacked, Charmed, and Crush were written for Orca Book Publisher for the Soundings Series. The Soundings series is written specifically for reluctant or difficult to engage readers, also known as hi-lo readers (high interest, low reading level). It features contemporary themes, often including what might be considered controversial material and language. Portrayal of queer characters All of Mac's YA novels have queer, gay or questioning characters. She says of her work \\"I know for myself that I can't leave queer characters out of my writing, even if they're gay and only I know it, or I don't spell it out.\\" Critical reception Quill and Quire describe Mac as a \\"powerhouse\\" and her novel The Opposite of Tidy as \\"irresistible and not to be missed.\\" C.J. Bott, in VOYA, said of The Beckoners, \\"The powerful intensity in this book will either keep the reader riveted or forced to take breaks from the haunting discomfort.\\" \\"Mac's experience as a paramedic gives her portrayal of their work an easy authority, and she sketches Ethan and his group home with a certain amount of precision and humour. The fluidity of the storytelling, as well as the dramatic circumstances of the story, are likely to attract Orca Soundings readers.\\" Mac's book Charmed, about a girl who is trapped into prostitution, was banned by the Plano Independent School District in Texas, in 2006/2007. The book \\"was challenged due to profanity, sexual content and violence.\\" However, according to Dave Jenkinson, Professor Emeritus, Faculty of Education, the University of Manitoba, \\"Mac's authentic treatment of her subject matter carries through to the book's conclusion‚Ä¶ Charmed is the gold standard of what hi-lo titles can be. Highly Recommended.\\" Personal life Mac lives in Vancouver with her children. She is a queer mom and attachment parent.

The term was coined by Thomas Tymoczko in 1979 in criticism of Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken's computer-assisted proof of the four color theorem, and has since been applied to other arguments, mainly those with excessive case splitting and/or with portions dispatched by a difficult-to-verify computer program. Surveyability remains an important consideration in computational mathematics. Tymoczko's argument Tymoczko argued that three criteria determine whether an argument is a mathematical proof: * Convincingness, which refers to the proof's ability to persuade a rational prover of its conclusion; * Surveyability, which refers to the proof's accessibility for verification by members of the human mathematical community; and * Formalizability, which refers to the proof's appealing to only logical relationships between concepts to substantiate its argument. In Tymoczko's view, the Appel‚ÄìHaken proof failed the surveyability criterion by, he argued, substituting experiment for deduction: Without surveyability, a proof may serve its first purpose of convincing a reader of its result and yet fail at its second purpose of enlightening the reader as to why that result is true‚Äîit may play the role of an observation rather than of an argument.Bonnie Gold and Roger Simons. Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy.Giandomenico Sica. Essays on the Foundations of Mathematics and Logic. Volume 1. This distinction is important because it means that non- surveyable proofs expose mathematics to a much higher potential for error. Especially in the case where non-surveyability is due to the use of a computer program (which may have bugs), most especially when that program is not published, convincingness may suffer as a result. As Tymoczko wrote: Counterarguments to Tymoczko's claims of non-surveyability Tymoczko's view is contested, however, by arguments that difficult-to-survey proofs are not necessarily as invalid as impossible-to-survey proofs. Paul Teller claimed that surveyability was a matter of degree and reader-dependent, not something a proof does or does not have. As proofs are not rejected when students have trouble understanding them, Teller argues, neither should proofs be rejected (though they may be criticized) simply because professional mathematicians find the argument hard to follow.Paul Teller. \\"Computer Proof\\". The Journal of Philosophy. 1980. (Teller disagreed with Tymoczko's assessment that \\"[The Four-Color Theorem] has not been checked by mathematicians, step by step, as all other proofs have been checked. Indeed, it cannot be checked that way.\\") An argument along similar lines is that case splitting is an accepted proof method, and the Appel‚ÄìHaken proof is only an extreme example of case splitting. Countermeasures against non-surveyability On the other hand, Tymoczko's point that proofs must be at least possible to survey and that errors in difficult-to-survey proofs are less likely to fall to scrutiny is generally not contested; instead methods have been suggested to improve surveyability, especially of computer-assisted proofs. Among early suggestions was that of parallelization: the verification task could be split across many readers, each of which could survey a portion of the proof.Neil Tennant. \\"The Taming of the True\\". 1997. But modern practice, as made famous by Flyspeck, is to render the dubious portions of a proof in a restricted formalism and then verify them with a proof checker that is available itself for survey. Indeed, the Appel‚ÄìHaken proof has been thus verified.Julie Rehmeyer. \\"How to (Really) Trust a Mathematical Proof\\". ScienceNews. https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-really-trust-mathematical-proof. Retrieved 2008-11-14.

The album was released on April 18, 2015 via Sugar Hill Records and was produced by Frank Liddell. It was released exclusively as a limited edition vinyl record and contained three new tracks. Trouble in Mind was made to be unlike Womack's previous releases because it featured limited musical production. The record only included Womack's voice and a guitarist as the primary instruments.  Background and content  Womack and her spouse/producer Frank Liddell discussed the intention to record an album with limited background production. The pair decided on choosing \\"handpicked compositions\\" and one musician for the album. American guitarist Richard Bennett was chosen as the record's session player. Bennett used \\"vintage\\" guitars for the recording process. The album was recorded in Liddell and Womack's personal studio. Hannahlee Allers of The Boot music blog called the album a \\"less is more approach\\", which followed a similar style to that of Womack's 2014 studio album The Way I'm Livin'. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Womack spoke about her reasons for the project, > \\"I love the idea of mixing things up, but stripping them back...When you > make things that basic, you can hear all the commonalities between, say, > Lightnin' Hopkins and Ralph Stanley. When you make those connections, that's > when it gets interesting.\\" Three tracks were chosen for the release of Trouble in Mind. The title track is a blues standard that has been recorded by various musical artists. The second track, \\"Where Have All the Average People Gone\\", was first made commercially successful by Roger Miller. Music journalist and critic Stephen L. Betts called the song a \\"gem\\" that was \\"unearthed\\" for the album's preparation. The third and final track, \\"I've Just Seen the Rock of Ages\\", was notably recorded by Ralph Stanley in a gospel-bluegrass format.  Critical reception and release  Trouble in Mind has mainly received positive responses from music critics and journalists. Stephen L. Betts of Rolling Stone commented, \\"For an artist who is so deeply rooted in traditional country music that the cover of her 2005 album, There's More Where That Came From, was designed to resemble a classic country LP, doing something unique to celebrate next month's upcoming Record Store Day isn't surprising.\\" Jessica Nicholson of the trade publication series MusicRow praised Womack's musical choices, stating, \\"Trouble In Mind is just the latest in a string of interesting collaborations Womack has taken part in during recent months. She co-hosted the International Bluegrass Music Awards with bluegrass stalwart Jerry Douglas, participated in a CMT Crossroads taping with John Legend, recorded with Ralph Stanley, and more.\\" The extended play was released on Record Store Day on April 18, 2015. It was issued only as a 12 inch vinyl record on Womack's label, Sugar Hill Records. It was available for a limited time period at selected record stores.

Hall House is a historic house at 1 Hapgood Street in Bellows Falls, Vermont. Built in 1890-92, it is one of Vermont's finest early expressions of Colonial Revival architecture. It is notable for its first three residents, who all played prominent roles in the major businesses of Bellows Falls, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. It is now the Readmore Inn. Description and history The Hall House is located a short way south of downtown Bellows Falls, at the northwest corner of Westminster and Hapgood Streets. It is a large, rectangular wood frame structure, three stories in height, with a dormered hip roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. A single-story porch extends across the front and wraps around to the left side, with a turned balustrade and Tuscan columns. The east facade, facing Westminster Street, consists of two bays, each of which is taken up by a two-story bowed three-window bay. The entrance is located on the south side, sheltered by a gabled porch similar to the one across the front. The interior retains elaborate original woodwork and finishes, include a glass chandelier and fireplace surrounds. The house, whose architect is not known, was built between 1892 and 1894 for William A. Hall, an executive and experimental chemist associated with the Fall Mountain Paper Company, one of Bellows Falls' leading companies. Hall, a Massachusetts native, may have played a role in bringing the Colonial Revival aesthetic to Bellows Falls, for this is one the earliest elaborate examples of the style in the region. In 1903 Hall sold the house to Francis G. Flint, part owner of a local paper mill. John Babbitt, the third owner of this house, owned one of the largest manufacturers in the nation of waxed paper. In the 1990s the building was restored and adapted for use as a bed and breakfast inn.

Etymology The Word International Ministries‚Äô name was derived from John 1:1 ‚ÄúIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God.‚Äù The church believes that Jesus Christ clearly impressed upon the church leaders that no endeavor will succeed if it does not start with God. Collectively, it was agreed by the church leadership that the name aside from identification purposes was to principally declare that Jesus Christ ‚Äì the Creator, the Master ‚Äì is the Lord of the church. Thus the Word, or the logos, became the church‚Äôs main name. The inclusion of the word ‚ÄúInternational‚Äù was deemed necessary since the church's mandate extends outside the Philippines and the inclusion of the said word was influenced by the presence of WIN churches in numerous countries outside the Philippines by the time the name was adopted and was influenced by the Filipino diaspora. The addition of the word ‚Äúministries‚Äù was also necessary as the church believe that the door to servanthood and creative evangelism is the ministry. It will also be the main strategy in the achievement of the vision of the new church. The word WIN, which stands for Word International, was adopted to describe the mission and its people to remind its members to win the lost to the Lord.  History  Early History The church traces its origin as early as the 1970s in the Philippines, a period describe by the church as the ‚Äúcharismatic movement.‚Äù The Church's foundations were laid in Makati where a group of lay people who are at least college graduates including professionals, entrepreneurs, rank and file personnel and office workers initiated gatherings in various places outside churches and other traditional venues to hold bible studies and worship services. They met in their homes, in their offices during breaks, in functions rooms of business establishments and even hotels. The meetings of the group grew in frequency and number of attendees. The entry of seminary-trained men and women was an open alternative. In the second semester of 1979, a group of these lay church workers were meeting regularly to study the Bible, to have fellowship, and to pray. One of those who would meet regularly was a small group composed of lay people from the International Charismatic Service (ICS), an Assemblies of God Fellowship. They met regularly in a bible study in a Makati Subdivision led by a Church of God missionary, and evolved finally as Word for the World Christian Fellowship. Their regular meetings were moved from a small residence to a progressively bigger place as the membership of the church grew. They went from renting a disco to a function room, to the ballroom of the Hotel Intercontinental and later the Rizal Theater. They held worship services on Sunday and on Thursdays. The King's Highway was later established allowing World International Ministry to establish its presence outside Metro Manila throughout the country under the initiative of Bro. Joseph Samson. Expansion outside the Philippines The 1970s was also the decade where many Filipinos went to countries abroad as Overseas Filipino Workers. same decade saw the migration of Filipino workers to other nations all over the globe. The Overseas Filipino Workers community is a big influence to the establishment of churches abroad. In 1984, the church targeted Hong Kong as its first overseas mission outreach. In late 1986, Bro. Chito Cordero together with Bro. Raymond Lim of the Church of Singapore-Balestier established a Bible study targeting the Filipinos in Singapore. Sisters Liza Mayo, Elvie Sinel, Marcia Anderson followed shortly. In 1988, Bro. Lito Estanislao of the Cell Ministry and Christian Couples Ministry in Makati migrated with his family and established a church in Sydney, Australia. By 1990, the efforts of Bro. Priam and Sis. Marlyn Guiuan led to the establishment of the church in Los Angeles, United States. The missionary couple, Bro. Rene and Rosanna Nepomuceno were sent to pastor the church in Dubai, United Arab Emirates as a follow up on a work that was formally received by Bro. Joseph Samson. The local church in Dubai was organized leading to various other works in others parts of the Middle East. In the 1990s, the church increased its presence in the United States and established itself in Canada and Europe. In 1992, Bro. Ed Miciano, a former Youth Ministry worker, sought to stabilize the work done in San Francisco, California initiated by Bro. Elmer Salazar, who was also a former Youth worker, into becoming a local church. Succeeding years saw Bro. Alberto ‚ÄúChito‚Äù Cordero arriving to pastor the Los Angeles church.Miciano, Ed (2010), The Faith Factor, Bridgepoint Publishers, CA, Later, Bro. Dino Miciano was sent to pastor the church in Seattle, Washington that was initiated by Roderick ‚ÄúDondi‚Äù Castillo. At the same time, Bro. Vicente ‚ÄúJun‚Äù Que, Jr. and Bro Rolando ‚ÄúRollie‚Äù Pascual saw the establishment of a church in Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada. In December 1992, Bro Babes and Sis. Nickie Paulate, the National Overseer then of the church were transferred to the United States to oversee the expansion of the Filipino ministries developing towards Canada. In 1994, the works in Europe started in the Netherlands through the efforts of Bro. Bani and Sis Cecila ‚ÄúChing‚Äù Lansang with the help of the Paulates, the Guiuans, and the Nepomucenos. In the same year a church was planted in Switzerland. In the same year, Bro Gonga ‚ÄúButch‚Äù and Sister Manju Yu were sent to pastor the church in Singapore. Bro Francisco Guinto, an engineer from the Middle East and some friends started the works in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Pastor Ramon Solidum, also another engineer and a former pastor of the church in Saudi Arabia pastored the church in Toronto, Canada. On the same year another church in Toronto was established through the efforts of workers from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates under Bro. Edgar Gelacio. These churches were either pastored by missionaries that came from the Youth, Young Adults and Christian Couples Ministries, and other professionals. In the early 1990s, To address the needs and the continuing growth of the fellowship in the Philippines, the Church of God created the COG National Urban Region under the leadership of Pastor Babes Paulate. The establishment of the COGNUR placed all the Word for the World Christian Fellowship (WWCF) under this office. By January 1993, Pastor Joseph E. Samson was appointed to replace Ptr. Babes who was appointed as the Assistant International Director of the fellowship based in the United States. Leadership crisis and reorganization By the late 1990s and into the 2000s, the establishment and strengthening of churches was becoming a reality in Canada, the United States and Western Europe. But then in the mid-1995, the occurrence of a crisis in church leadership led several of its pastors to found the need to establish a new church. The leaders who have been meeting for more than a year once again met for the last time to strengthen the churches worldwide. 80 churches all over the Philippines including the majority of the churches abroad unified together. On June 1997, the first church service in Makati was organized. And on August 4, 1997, the pastors registered the Word International Ministries as a non-profit organization and was certified by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines under SEC No. A- 1997-13753. Churches outside the Philippines likewise formally organized and registered in their respective countries. In November 1997, the Word International Ministries (WIN) gathered in Tagaytay for its first Pastors and Pastor‚Äôs Wives conference which culminated with a National Gathering held at the Mandaluyong Gym. The theme for the said gathering was ‚ÄúA New Beginning.‚Äù 2000 members came to attend the gathering filling the gym to the Gym. First national gathering On its first national gathering in November 1997, Two thousand members attended the worship convergence held at the Mandaluyong City Gym. The city government of Mandaluyong granted the use of the gym for free. During the said gathering, new vision and mission statements were introduced. Likewise a new global cry ‚ÄúWin the World for God‚Äôs Glory,‚Äù was also adopted. In 1998 another gathering with a theme, ‚ÄúEach One Win One,‚Äù was held at the Ramada Hotel in Manila. 3000 people attended the gathering. The year 1999 also marked the launching of the Word Leadership Institute (WLI) which gave the church a structured equipping and edifying programs. In 2000, another gathering was held at the Makati City Gym with the theme ‚ÄúGetting Closer, Growing Stronger,‚Äù. An estimated crowd of 4000 came to join the Gathering. In 2004, in spite of a super typhoon that hit the country, a National Pastors and Pastor‚Äôs Wives conference was held at the WIN Pasig church. A National gathering followed held at the Ynares Sports Complex in Antipolo with theme ‚ÄúBayan Ko Aaabutin Ko.‚Äù 5000 people attended the said gathering. Reorganization In June 2001, the leaders of Word International Ministries from the Philippines, Asia, Canada, the Middle East, Europe and the United States met in Burbank in Los Angeles, California, United States. The objective of that meeting was to consolidate the leadership as well as the structure of the church worldwide. On this year also, two more churches were added on the lists, the WIN New Jersey started by Mando Zacharias, and another one in Israel by Ferdie Melendres. Continued expansion By 2002, Word International Ministries has outreaches and influences in more than 26 countries with over 200 churches worldwide. In the said meeting the International leaders structured the church to have five regions, namely, The Philippines and the Pacific islands, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, Canada, and the USA. Pastors Joseph E. Samson, Butch Yu, Rene Nepomuceno, Ronaldo de Villa, Chito Cordero were appointed as regional directors respectively. Pastor Babes Paulate was also installed as the first International Director of the Church. It was also agreed that the WIN Los Angeles becomes the official and corporate address of the International office. In September 2003 works in Myanmar was added. The Hong Kong ministry was re-established in May 2004. Attempts to establish works in Japan and Nepal were made. In April 2004, the second International Leaders Meeting and Conference was held at a venue owned by Meralco in Antipolo, Philippines. The year 2004 ended with a Pastors and Pastor‚Äôs wives conference at the Valle Verde Country Club in Pasig. Meanwhile, the ministry continued to grow, and in 2006, new church was established in New York, and in 2014 another church in Massachusetts. Ministries With people continually being added, Under Bro. Emerito ‚ÄúBabes‚Äù Paulate, the church established various ministries such as Christian Couples, Young Adults, Youth, Cell ministry, Reach Youth, Singles, and the Growth Program Institute (GPI). The establishing of churches outside the Makati area was then led by Bro. Joseph E. Samson, which saw the mobilization of other lay leaders even those from the provinces. These people later become ministry heads, Bible study teachers and some became pastors. Continuity was also ensured as various training and equipping modules were developed, combined with basic discipling and mentoring methods. The Growth Program Institute, or the GPI, had become the main training program of the fellowship. The Word International Ministries seeks to expand its presence through an outreach ministry named The King's Highway. It has established itself outside Metro Manila under Bro. Joseph Samson. The project seeks to conduct Bible study in a certain province with the later intent to conduct regular worship services until it becomes a local church that has the capability to conduct its own outreaches. Headquarters Its corporate office is located at Cityland Condominium, Herrera Tower, VA Rufino corner Valero Street, Makati.

The general layout of present structure was likely built in the 13th century atop more ancient foundations. However, after numerous wars, it was rebuilt over the years. The main outline we see in 2015 dates the end of the 15th-century, when Caterina Sforza, daughter of the Duke of Milan and wife of Girolamo Riario, commissioned refurbishment from the architect Giorgio Marchesi. Riario was the grandson of Pope Sixtus IV. Marchesi, with the help of some of the military engineers working for the Sforza, helped design the defensive towers, moat, and merlons. In the 1500s, the castle was granted by Pope Clement VII to the Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggi. He converted the castle into a residence, roofing the courtyard and creating open loggias. In 1728, the passing of Lorenzo Campeggi, the last male heir of the Campeggi, the castle passed to the Francesca Maria Capeggi, married to Matteo Malvezzi. Their son, carried forth the name of Malvezzi-Campeggi. In 1798, the Napoleonic occupation of the region abolished the feudal domains, but the castle remained in the hands of the family until 1960.

Founded in August 2015 as a joint operations room of 16 member groups, three of the groups later fully merged into Jaysh al-Nasr. The group was supplied with US-made BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles.  History  Formation as a joint operations room Jaysh al- Nasr was formed in early August 2015 as a joint operations room with the stated objective being the \\"liberation of the northern countryside of Hama, breaking the regime's first defense line toward Hama the city.\\" It was announced as a first step towards unifying the Free Syrian Army in Idlib and Hama provinces into a single operations room. The alliance initially comprised the following 16 groups: * Falcons of al-Ghab * Gathering of Glory * Levant Front * Salvation Front * Falcons of Mount Zawiya Brigade * 6th Brigade * 111th Brigade * 60th Brigade * Bilad ash-Sham Brigade * 111th Regiment * Revolutionary Fedayeen Movement (former member of the Army of Revolutionaries) * Hawks of Jihad Battalion * Martyrs of Tremseh Brigade * Al-Mashhour Battalions * Antiquities Brigade Reformation as a unified group In late October 2015, it was announced that three of its component groups, the Falcons of al-Ghab, 111th Regiment, and the Salvation Front, completely merged into Jaysh al-Nasr with Suqour al-Ghab's commander, Major Muhammad Mansour, assuming the leadership of the new unified group. In late September 2016, the group previously known as Liwa Ahrar Darayya (who had been evacuated from Darayya due to a deal made with the Syrian government) announced they merge into Jaysh al-Nasr.Former Darayya rebels now fighting Syrian Army in northern Hama Al Masdar News, September 28, 2016 Jaysh al-Nasr have taken mainly- Alawite civilians, including children, as prisoners. 112 of them were released from Qalaat al-Madiq on 7 February 2017 as part of a prisoner exchange. Rebel infighting technicals in the southern Idlib countryside during the northwestern Syria campaign, 23 January 2018. On 7 February 2017, Jund al- Aqsa attacked the headquarters of Jaysh al-Nasr near the town of Murak in northern Hama. Jund al-Aqsa captured more than 250 fighters from Jaysh al- Nasr. On 14 February, they reportedly killed at least 80 Jaysh al-Nasr prisoners before withdrawing from their positions north of Khan Shaykhun. Kafr Nuboudah and Kafr Zita villages were the origin of the Jaysh Nasr members whom Liwa al-Aqsa executed according to Moussa al-Omar. The casualties given for Jaysh Nasr were 56 fighters, 3 media reporters, and 11 military commanders, according to Moussa al-Omar. After Jund al-Aqsa committed slaughter at Khan Shaykhun, only one person lived to tell the tale. After the infighting with Jund al-Aqsa, Captain Muhannad Junaid of Jaysh al-Nasr stated that \\"The whole of Idlib will be painted black\\". On 22 May 2017, first lieutenant Alaa Rakhmon of Jaysh al-Nasr was assassinated by unknown assailants in the village of Kafr Nabudah. Rakhmon was a prominent operator of BGM-71 TOW missiles and was responsible for destroying several Syrian Army tanks during the 2017 Hama offensive. Turkish support Western financial support for Jaysh al-Nasr largely ended in October 2017. On 9 February 2018, the 111th Regiment and the Salvation Front left Jaysh al-Nasr. The Falcons of al-Ghab, led by Major Muhammad Mansour, became the only significant faction left in the group. Turkey continues to provide financial and military support for Jaysh al-Nasr and other rebel groups in the region. In exchange for continued support, Turkey requested these rebel groups to participate in the Turkish military operation in Afrin, which Jaysh al-Nasr did beginning on 16 February. On the same day, Jaysh al-Nasr appointed 3 new leaders. In May 2018, along with 10 other rebel groups in northwestern Syria, the Army of Victory formed the National Front for Liberation, which was officially announced on 28 May. Maj. Muhammad Mansour, commander of Jaysh al-Nasr, was appointed chief of staff of the formation. After it left the Army of Victory, the 111th Regiment joined the Sham Legion's northern Hama branch, which is also part of the NFL. On 6 January 2019, the Sham Legion expelled the 111th Regiment for insubordination.

This whipworm species was first discovered in 1795 and is known to infect sheep and goats. These organisms are capable of inhabiting any region that has the aforementioned hosts, as can be attested by the numerous reports of T. ovis findings throughout North and South America, Australia, Europe, and Asia. Information regarding the species' general life cycle and egg development can be seen in the Trichuris page. Morphology This species of whipworm is white and is known to have a long, thin neck that composes two- thirds of its body, and a short, thick posterior. The male organisms of T. ovis usually range from 53.04mm-75.08mm in length, while their female counterparts are approximately 32.03-70.19mm in length. The spicule length is 4.18-5.62mm for both genders. Both genders also have bacillary bands. T. ovis that inhabit different species of sheep or goats can have slightly different morphologies. Symptoms and Treatment Like all whipworms, T. ovis primarily inhabit the host‚Äôs cecum. However, sheep and goats are rather resistant to the parasite infection and often do not experience many symptoms. If the host is heavily infected, a large portion of the blood vessels located in the cecal wall will be consumed. This eventually results in the thickening of the wall, thus preventing that region of the large intestine from absorbing fluids causing the host to have diarrhea. This can be extremely detrimental for the host during a drought. Although sheep and goats are relatively resistant to them, T. ovis is one of the most common nematode parasites, and many of the aforementioned hosts are infected by this species of whipworm. As a result, farmers began treating infected livestock with anthelmintics, an internal pesticide, in hopes of eradicating these infections. Unfortunately, there have been cases reported where the parasites are resistant to these treatments, thus prompting researchers to develop potential vaccines to combat such resistant whipworms.

History The AM√âP was established in Pilisszentl√°szl√≥ by Member of Parliament Izabella B. Kir√°ly, who was expelled from the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) on 22 June 1993 due to her extremist views and speeches in parliamentary debates. The party's ideology was described by scholars and media outlets as anti-Westernist and antisemitic. Kir√°ly maintained good relationship with major underground neo-Nazi skinhead groups and she also supported Hungarian irredentism in her parliamentary speeches. The party published its programme on 22 June 1996 in Visegr√°d (\\"108 points of Mogyor√≥hegy\\"), where they demanded direct presidential elections and abolition of parliamentary immunity. The AM√âP rejected political party pluralism, it supported the increasing of independent candidates in each constituencies instead. The AM√âP intended to rename itself as \\"National Assembly of the Hungarians\\" on 23 October 1996, but the Pest County Court did not allow this because of the misleading nature of the proposed name. The party contested the 1994 parliamentary election with only one candidate (Kir√°ly) in Nagyk≈ër√∂s, who failed to win a seat. It did not participate in the 1998 parliamentary election. For the 2002 parliamentary election, the AM√âP was able to nominee only Kir√°ly as individual candidate again, who received 3.69 percent of the votes in Nagyk≈ër√∂s constituency, gaining no seats.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. After the 2002 national election, the AM√âP had no political activity. Izabella Kir√°ly retired from politics in 2003. The party was dissolved on 9 January 2005. Its party foundation, the Hungarian Future in Hungarian Past disestablished in 2009. International relations Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a leaked document revealed in January 2004 that Kir√°ly's party received benefits and financial support from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party for its mediator role in sale of 4,700,000 barrels (750,000 m3) of oil. Formerly Kir√°ly admitted that she had been in Iraq several times since the second half of the 1990s. In November 2002, she also criticized the United States' Middle-East politics and planned intervention in Iraq. According to the local daily which published the beneficiaries' list, the AM√âP and the other pro-Saddam persons and organizations had to oppose the United States' foreign policy while demanding lifting of oil embargo against Iraq, in exchange for the Iraqi government's financial support.

Founded by Georgie Smith, ASOH founder Smith said of Medavoy and her charity, \\"ASOH began as a random act of kindness when I responded to a cry for a help from a young man who had aged out of foster care, and who had secured an apartment but had no means to obtain a solitary item that might make it feel like home. {Smith's] partner Melissa Goddard and [Smith] couldn‚Äôt help but notice the great void in our community. All foster youth who age out of the system, having never been adopted, are all alone in the world, without family members to offer them hand me downs let alone the helping hand it requires to source, collect, install and make a space feel like home: Home is the foundation we all need to thrive. Each year, 35,000 young people age out in the US. Statistics predict they are the least likely to succeed. Fifty percent of foster children will experience homelessness. When Irena Medavoy learned these facts, rallied her friends to donate household items and urged us to build a nonprofit modeled after the original act of kindness. Every day since then Irena has championed us forth. Connecting us with people who can help us financially, guide us and offer the youth better career prospects. We ran towards a crisis, into unfamiliar terrain and figured it out as we went along. It was absurdly daunting and exhausting. Meeting this goals of our new charity would have been entirely impossible without Irena standing shoulder to shoulder with us rallying support and goodwill.

Construction of dam and early mills In 1770, Ebenezer Hawkes constructed a roughly made dam about five rods north of the old Saugus Iron Works dam. He also constructed a canal, a grist mill, and a saw mill. In 1794, chocolate manufacturer Benjamin Sweetser, who became one of the most successful chocolate makers in the United States, purchased the property. Around 1796, Sweetser constructed a new chocolate factory about seventy feet northwest of the grist mill. Around 1800, he constructed a new residence north of the factory. From 1816 to 1820, the mill was rented to William Smith, who manufactured chocolate for Chase & Page of Salem, Massachusetts. From 1815 to 1822, the grist and saw mills were leased to Robert Eames, who manufactured dye woods. William Gray and early years In 1822, duck cloth manufacturer William Gray took apart his Stoneham, Massachusetts factory and reassembled it between the chocolate and grist mills to form one building about 150 feet in length. Gray's business only lasted about one and a half years. In 1824, Gray leased the property to Brown & Baldwin (later Brown & Baldwin, Haskins), a company that bleached printed calico. The company spent a considerable amount of money making improvements to the mill, however the business was not successful and folded at the end of 1825. In 1826, the property was transferred to True & Broadhead (later known as True & Street), which made many improvements to the mill and repaired and raised the dam. The raising of the dam resulted in a number of lawsuits for flood damage. True & Street later built an 85 foot by 40 foot, three story brick factory building. In 1829, a portion of the property was leased to flannel manufactures Brierly & Whitehead. In 1832, True & Street went out of business. In 1834, Whitwell, Bond, & Co. purchased the mill, which they used to clean and assort wood. In 1835, Livermore & Kendall purchased the property, which they named Rockville, and managed it for the New England Wool Company. In 1836, Livermore & Kendall moved their operations to Framingham, Massachusetts and the mill remained idle until 1838. Purchase by Edward Pranker In 1838, Edward Pranker, an English-born textile manufacturer from Salem, New Hampshire purchased the property on bond and established a flannel and bed sheet manufacturing business. He renovated the mill and installed new machinery. Although the conditions of the wool business in general were extremely poor during the mill's first years of operation, the business was a success. In 1840, he was able to pay off the bond on the property. By 1846, Pranker's business had grown so much that he had to build a second mill. The new mill was a seventy foot by fifty foot, three story, brick building that adjoined his first one. The factories contained six sets of cards, thirteen jacks, 180 spindles, and forty looms. Also in 1846, Pranker enlarged a dam on the Saugus River by two feet, which raised the water level of a pond that bears his name. In 1857, Pranker, his son George Pranker, and John Armitage incorporated the Edward Pranker & Co. textile firm. Also that year, Pranker had frame buildings constructed for wool pulling and sheepskin tanning. In 1860 he built a two- story, 125 by 60 foot, mill located on opposite side of the road that contained four sets of wool manufacturing equipment. Ownership by Pranker family In 1865, Edward Pranker died and ownership of the mill passed to his son George Pranker and son-in-law John Parsons, who ran the business under the name Pranker & Co. In February 1866, a fire damaged the two adjoining brick mills. As a result of the damage, the older mill was reduced from three stories to two. To compensate, a fourth floor was added to the building built in 1846. In 1870, Pranker and Parsons brought some of the younger members of the family into the business. In 1877, both Pranker and Parsons died and operations were suspended for two years. In April 1879, six of Edward Pranker's grandchildren formed the Pranker Manufacturing Company, which manufactured wool shirts, dresses, flannels, and sacks. In 1884, a one hundred foot high round brick chimney was constructed next to the building housing the mill's boiler. Pranker Manufacturing Company ran the mills until 1898, when operations were suspended until a settlement was reached with the company's creditors. That year, the business was reorganized as the Saugus Woolen Manufacturing Co. George Parsons, one of Edward Pranker's grandsons, served as the company's president. The mill operated under this arrangement for a few years before the mill went idle and the property was offered for sale. United States Worsted Company and closure In 1904, the mills were purchased by the Saugus Manufacturing Company, a new corporation formed by business interests from New Bedford, Massachusetts. Samuel H. Bailey was elected the company's first president and Charles W. Auel, superintendent of the Oneko Woolen Mill in New Bedford, was named superintendent of the mill. The Saugus Manufacturing Company manufactured dress goods and cashmere. The mill was renamed the Iroquois Mills. The Saugus Manufacturing Company fell into bankruptcy due to the Panic of 1907 and in 1908 the business was acquired by a new group of investors and reorganized as the United States Worsted Company. In 1915, the United States Worsted Company closed the Iroquois Mills. They retained ownership until 1928, when the property was sold at auction. As of 2015, the buildings remain in use.

She established the Arya Samaj, a Hindu reform movement, in Toronto, Canada and promoted social causes. Biography Bedi was born Kapila in Sahnewal, India. At a young age she moved with her parents to Kenya, which was then a British colony, at the time of global economic depression. The family lived in a \\"segregated colony.\\" She had five brothers. At age 18, her ambition to further her college education in law in England did not fructify as her parents were sick. To sustain her large family and educate her brothers she took up a job as a teacher in Nairobi. She also learned painting and developed oratorical skills with her participation in debates and lectures on Indian independence movement. She married Gobind Bedi in 1946; together they promoted social issues among the Indian diaspora. They had four children, sons Nilam, Deepak and Shalin, and daughter Sheetal. Her husband died in 2008. She also worked with the Arya Samaj at Nairobi. Following an upheaval in political conditions in East Africa, particularly in Uganda where Indians in that country were persecuted, Bedi emigrated to Toronto, Canada in 1972. In Toronto, along with her husband, she established Arya Samaj, an offshoot of the Hindu reform movement that started in India in 1875; through this institution they facilitated a large number of immigrants to become established in Canada. In 1976, Sarla became a priestess and was the first female Hindu priest in Ontario. She promoted Hindu culture as a priestess by conducting the Hindu religious rites of fire sacrifice, baptisms, weddings and funerals for the Indian diaspora.

The main characters are the Eight Immortals in Taoism, although being this is a comedy, most are portrayed as crooks in the film. Plot Goddess Buddy Wall ascends to the mortal world to retrieve the holy pearls that Lucifer stole. She saves a group of villagers from sacrificing one of their children to Lucifer by posing as one. When she cannot win, she calls upon god Ben who manages to chase Lucifer away. To defeat Lucifer, the two embark on a journey to find the other six gods who were reincarnated into mortals; they are identified by a birthmark on their body. Arriving in a town, the film introduces the reincarnated gods as mortals who are unaware of their celestial identities: Smart Han and Lousy Han are con artists, homosexual Cheung and Lotus are swindlers that run a hostel, and Lee and Tsao are employee and employer respectively for bounty hunting. Buddy Wall and Ben first meet con artists Smart Han and Lousy Han who tries to pickpocket Buddy Wall in the flea market; Ben beats them but is sidetracked when beautiful women come to watch him fight. The two meet Lee and Tsao when Lee physically abuses his mother to steal her jade bracelet to give to Tsao to pay off a debt. The two check into Cheung and Lotus' hostel as Lotus tries to seduce Ben. That evening, Lucifer claims a young boy's life in retaliation for the humans sending the gods after him, and demands the sacrifices of three boys and girls in three days. At the hostel, all of the mortal gods have unknowingly gathered there. Lotus captures the mortal gods, except Smart Han, and she fights against Ben who has been suspicious of her intentions. Cheung, Lotus' partner in crime and in love with Tsao, is lured into where they are kept and knocked unconscious, allowing the captives to escape. All of the mortal gods unite, where Ben is forced to pardon their mortal crimes and ask for their help in locating the other 6 gods to fight Lucifer. Surprisingly, they all reveal their marks, indicating that they are the gods that he and Buddy Wall had been looking for. However, the group is skeptical of their celestial origins. They see a group of villagers, marching to sacrifice three boys and girls to Lucifer. The gods promises to save the children in three days time. However, within the three days, the mortal gods dilly-dallies while Lucifer takes the initiative to break them apart by transforming as every one of them to fool the others. Ben reveals the true Lucifer but the mortal gods are disorganized and scattered, whereby Ben and Buddy Wall are captured. The rest of the injured mortal gods reunite outside of the city and try to rescue Ben and Buddy Wall, but it costs them their lives. During a lunar eclipse, Lucifer tries to consume the holy pearls but they escape to possess their respective mortals, properly reviving and turning them into gods. With their powers united, they restrain Lucifer and burn him in his own tower of pyre. They then cross a large body of water back to their home island of fairies.

She began her career performing works from the mezzo-soprano repertoire, but after encouragement from the staff at the Metropolitan Opera retrained her voice as a soprano. She successfully made that transition after winning the Young Concert Artists competition in 1993. She went on to perform as a leading soprano with orchestras and opera companies internationally. Life and career Born in Palatka, Florida, Johnson was the daughter of Bernice Baker and Emmanuel Johnson. She graduated from Central Academy High School in Palatka. She earned a Bachelor of Music degree from Bethune-Cookman University and a Master of Music degree from the Manhattan School of Music before winning a study grant from the Richard Tucker Music Foundation in 1990. Johnson made her professional debut at the Metropolitan Opera on November 20, 1985 as Lily in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess under the baton of William Vendice. She returned to the Met for more than 50 more performances over the next decade in roles like Serena in Porgy and Bess, the High Priestess in Aida, and Madelon in Andrea Chenier. Her last performance at the Met was in 1994 as the High Priestess. In 1986, Johnson made her European debut at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera as the Strawberry Woman in Trevor Nunn's critically acclaimed production of Porgy and Bess; a role she recorded with that company two years later. That same year, she was a featured soloist in a concert of spirituals for Symphony Space. In 1987, she portrayed Mama McCourt in The Ballad of Baby Doe for the Bronx Opera. In 1989, she performed the role of Mrs. Nolan in Menotti's The Medium and was the mezzo-soprano soloist in the Verdi Requiem, both for Opera Ebony. She repeated the role of the Strawberry Woman at the Finnish National Opera in 1989 and 1992. In 1990, Johnson was a soloist with The Harlem Spiritual Ensemble for a concert honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. That same year she portrayed Mrs. Noye in Britten's Noye's Fludde for the Piccolo Teatro Dell Opera, and performed the Romanze from Franz Schubert's Rosamunde at the Mostly Mozart Festival at Avery Fisher Hall. In 1992, she made her debut at the San Francisco Opera as the Celestial Voice in Verdi's Don Carlos, performed Strauss' Four Last Songs with the Greater Bridgeport Symphony, and performed the aria \\"Care salve\\" from Handel's Atalanta in concert with the Brooklyn Philharmonic. In 1993, Johnson performed the title role in Verdi's Aida at the Michigan Opera Theater, returned to the Mostly Mozart Festival to perform Beethoven's Ah! perfido under the baton of John Nelson at Lincoln Center, and sang both Ave Maria and The Lord's Prayer for the wedding of Donald Trump and Marla Maples. That same year she won the Young Concert Artists competition, which led to her New York recital debut at the 92nd Street Y on March 29, 1994. In his review of her performance, music critic Bernard Holland wrote \\"Adding Ms. Johnson up, one arrives at a powerful voice, trueness of intonation, musicality, taste and an impressive endurance. In conglomerate these qualities certainly signal a future of some proportions, maybe even a new Isolde.\\" In 1994, Johnson made her debut with Opera Pacific in the title role of Verdi's Aida, a role which she also performed for her debuts at the Atlanta Opera and Opera Mobile in 1995. Engagements with major orchestras soon followed over the next two years, including performances with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and the London Symphony Orchestra. In the late 1990s, Johnson appeared in several concerts with the Florida Philharmonic Orchestra, including performing as the soprano soloist in Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Barber's Knoxville: Summer of 1915, and Bernstein's Jeremiah Symphony among others. In 1997, she sang Aida to Fabio Armiliato's Radames in a return to the Michigan Opera Theatre. In 1998, she sang the role of Serena to Kevin Deas' Porgy with the New York Philharmonic under conductor Bobby McFerrin. In 2000, Johnson sang the role of Bess to Terry Cook's Porgy in a concert performance of the opera with the Czech Philharmonic. In 2001, she was a featured soloist in Lincoln Center's American Songbook series at Alice Tully Hall singing music by Ricky Ian Gordon. In 2002, she performed the role of Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas with the Gotham Chamber Opera. In 2005, she sang for Donald Trump's wedding to Melania Trump. In 2006, she performed Strauss' Four Last Songs for performances with the Royal Ballet Sinfonia in London. In 2007 she performed Samuel Barber's Prayers of Kierkegaard with the Oregon Symphony. Johnson died of heart failure in Palatka, Florida, in 2015 at the age of 61. She had returned to her hometown previously to take care of her aging mother. Other organizations with whom she performed as a guest artist during her career were the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and the Indianapolis Symphony. She also sang at the White House for Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography and New Media from the Kansas City Art Institute and a Master of Arts in Modern Art History, Theory, and Criticism from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She has contributed to publications, including One+One Filmmakers Journal, Art in Print, Newcity, ArtSlant, Art Papers, Review, Art21, Cacophany, Becoming the Forest, and FNews Magazine.

Her curated exhibitions include \\"Black Thorns in the Black Box\\" (with Bryan Wendorf) and \\"Black Thorns in the White Cube\\". Ishmael first encountered metal music at the age of 14, when she was living in Florida. A friend from her art class introduced her to the band Six Feet Under, and shortly afterward another friend gave her a compilation of songs by Arcturus, Emperor, Cradle of Filth, Samael, and Pink Floyd. This piqued her interest in black metal, and when she relocated to Kansas City in the late 1990s she attended shows by the local black metal band Descension. During her undergraduate studies she created sound and multimedia art installations, basing many of them off of themes from the Odyssey. For her Master's thesis she wrote on black metal in contemporary art, work in which her installation \\"Black Thorns in the White Cube\\" was grounded. The piece explored how contemporary artists draw upon the languages, iconography, and narratives of black metal ‚Äì what Ishmael calls the \\"mythology\\" of black metal. Reviewers, along with Ishmael herself, noted that some prior exposure to the black metal music scene was helpful for understanding the exhibition.

It was inspired by, but has surpassed, its rival NORAD Tracks Santa, which has operated since 1955. History In early 2004, Google saw the NORAD Tracks Santa service and said they \\"felt like it could be better for users to 'visualize' where Santa is currently at\\". So, in 2004, after Keyhole, Inc. was acquired by Google, they followed Santa in the \\"Keyhole Earth Viewer\\" (Google Earth's original name) and called it the \\"Keyhole Santa Radar\\". The audience was small due to Keyhole being a \\"pay-for\\" product. In 2018, the Santa Tracker added several features for students and educators. On December 4, 2018, the website fully launched a suite of games and lesson plans about coding basics and Christmas traditions around the world. The site also features information about nonprofit organizations Khan Academy and Code.org. The 2018 Google Santa Tracker page also allowed users to use the Google Assistant to call Santa or listen to a Christmas story. A Santa Tracker Android app is available for download in the Google Play Store. In December 2018, the website had 42.2 million visitors. How the website works Every Christmas Eve, the Google Santa Tracker begins to \\"track\\" Santa at about midnight in the furthest east time zone. The map shows Santa alternating between traveling and handing out presents in cities. Santa \\"travels\\" approximately one time zone west per hour. Counters show viewers how far Santa has \\"traveled\\", how long until he reaches the viewer's city, the distance from the viewer's city, and the total number of presents delivered. Santa is depicted as having helpers with him, including the standard reindeer and elves, along with penguins and a snowman. For each city that Santa visits, the first few paragraphs of the corresponding Wikipedia article are shown, giving an overview of the city. The website also shows photos with the city in the background and Santa or his helpers in the foreground. The temperature of the city is accurately given using data from The Weather Channel. Not every large city is visited; some large cities close to other large cities are skipped, while smaller cities that are far from any other populated place are occasionally featured. Even when Santa is traveling, the counter showing the total presents delivered increases, but at a slower rate than when Santa is in a city. The 2016 site also featured other pictures that labeled \\"This Just In\\". These resembled photos taken on social media websites, and the photos were usually of Santa and his helpers doing various things, including Santa and his helpers imitating the cover of Abbey Road, Santa delivering presents, and Santa and an elf taking a selfie. Users can also watch videos and play games. The Santa Tracker is locked until December 24. However, site visitors can interact with the games and lesson plans in Santa's Village throughout the year.

In 2013 the Australian bioentrepreneur Paul Hopper sought to bring these private companies into a public company in order to raise capital to develop them. The public company he eventually identified was Virax, listed on the ASX and looking for new directions since its previous venture, involving viral delivery of immunologic genes for the treatment of HIV, had been unsuccessful.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute in Tampa, Fl.  PTX-100  PTX-100, originally called GGTI-2418, is a first-in-class compound that blocks a cancer growth enzyme known as geranylgeranyltransferase type 1 (GGT-I). This enzyme, by posttranslationally modifying the small GTPase Rho with isoprenoid lipids, plays a role in malignant transformation of cells and the inhibition of apoptosis. PTX-100, as a synthetic peptidomimetic inhibitor of GGT-I, is able to block Rho function and thereby induce a G1 phase cell cycle arrest. It does this by a mechanism involving induction of the CDK inhibitors p21waf and p27kip1, CDK2 and CDK4 inhibition and hypophosphorylation of a tumor suppressor called Rb. GGTase I inhibitors also induce apoptosis by a mechanism involving downregulation of the expression of survivin and suppression of the activation of PI3K/AKT. PTX-100 was invented around 2009 by Said Sebti and Andrew Hamilton, then a Professor of Chemistry at Yale University, now Vice Chancellor at the University of Oxford Prescient expects to commence Phase Ib/II clinical trials in breast cancer and multiple myeloma in 2016. At the same time, Prescient plans to develop a p27 cancer biomarker as a companion diagnostic that will potentially identify those patients that are most likely to respond to PTX-100 therapy.

A lot of this story is centralized upon the daughter and how everyone's opinion changes once the daughter does something amazing. The illustrations by Young, which also precede and follow the text, include a very detailed and traditional style of art that follows very closely to the actions that are being presented in the text. Synopsis In Imperial China, there is an emperor who has four sons and three daughters that meant the world to him. He, later on, has a fourth daughter named Djeow Seow. This emperor barely pays attention to the small and young Djeow Seow. One day these \\"bad\\" men come and take the emperor from his throne to an isolated and secluded tower and then lie to everyone that the emperor is dead. The \\"bad\\" men did not notice Djeow Seow watching all the events unfold from a corner. She preserves her father's life by sending him baskets of food via kite to the hidden tower. The daughter used to play with her kite every day because no one noticed or paid any attention to her. This being her chance, she thinks of the idea to use her kite string to rescue her father. The emperor then slides down along the string of the kite to safety and returns home to reclaim China from these people who kidnapped him. He rules happily with his youngest daughter now by his side, showering her with love and affection after the events that unfolded.

She became mother superior of the convent at a young age, but is chiefly remembered as a central figure in the case of the possessed of Loudun in 1632, which led, after witch trials, to the burning at the stake of the priest Urbain Grandier two years later.  Early life  Jeanne de Belcier was born at Cozes in 1602, the daughter of Louis de Belcier, Baron de Cozes, and Charlotte de Goumard. An accident during childhood left her permanently handicapped and she was put under the care of an aunt at the Benedictine abbey of Sainte-Marie-des-Dames. Finding the Benedictine life too hard, she returned home on the death of her aunt. In 1622 she entered the convent of Ursulines de Poitiers. She made her vows a year later taking the religious name of Jeanne des Anges. In 1627, she transferred to the new Ursuline convent at Loudun, and soon afterwards became its mother superior, perhaps because of her high social standing.  Loudun  Father Urbain Grandier was already the parish priest at Saint-Pierre du March√© in Loudun at that time. He was an important figure with powerful friends but had previously been involved in scandal and controversy. Jeanne was sexually fascinated with him, writing in her autobiography, \\"When I did not see him, I burned with love for him and when he presented himself to me ‚Ä¶ I lacked the faith to combat the impure thoughts and movements that I felt\\". Unaware that Sister Jeanne had become obsessed with him, Grandier turned down an invitation to become the spiritual director of the convent after their former spiritual director, Father Moussault, had died. Then in 1632, Sister Jeanne stated that Grandier's spectral image had appeared to her, seduced her and taken from her \\"that which she had vowed to keep for her heavenly husband Jesus Christ\\". About the same time, other sisters began to complain of disturbed nights, and of seeing ghostly men, including Moussault and Grandier, moving about the building. Under exorcism, the nuns accused Grandier of causing them to be possessed. On further examination, over two dozen of them were found to be \\"bewitched, obsessed, or possessed\\", but none to as great extent as Sister Jeanne, who was said to be afflicted with seven demons. Exorcisms took place in the convent and around the town, continuing for several years with Sister Jeanne playing a prominent role. Grandier was arrested and questioned before being tried by an ecclesiastical court, which acquitted him. However, Grandier had a powerful enemy, and Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of France, took an interest in the matter. He ordered a new trial for witchcraft to be conducted by his special envoy. Despite Sister Jeanne and the nuns withdrawing their complaint, Grandier was convicted, tortured and put to death by burning at the stake.  Media  At one time Sister Jeanne manifested the symptoms of false pregnancy, and this and the Loudun possessions have been much discussed over the years. In 1635, Sister Jeanne was said to have been marked by a cross on her forehead which bled continually for three weeks. Several authorities have come to the conclusion that these manifestations were a result of hysteria in the case of Sister Jeanne and mass hysteria in the case of the other nuns. Jeanne des Anges wrote an autobiographical account of her life, and a film, directed by Jerzy Kawalerowicz and entitled M√®re Jeanne des Anges was released in 1961, starring Lucyna Winnicka, Mieczyslaw Voit and Anna Ciepielewska.

The group was first organized in 1956 as the 115th Fighter Group and served in the air defense role until 1974, when it converted to a forward air control mission. It was inactive from 1979 to 1994, when it assumed its present mission. As an Air National Guard unit, it is normally under the command of the Governor, but has a federal role as well. Currently the wing has personnel and/or aircraft assigned to Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Jump Start and regularly serves with the Air Expeditionary Force in Iraq and Afghanistan. Units The 115th Operations Group consists of the following units: * 176th Fighter Squadron * 115th Operations Support Squadron History On 15 April 1956, the Wisconsin Air National Guard 176th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron and supporting elements were reorganized as a group, and the 115th Fighter Group was established. The 176th became the group's flying squadron. The group was also assigned several support units, manned by personnel formerly assigned to the 128th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. Air defense 176th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-89J 53-2686 in 1964 The group trained for its air defense mission with annual training performed at Volk Field from 1956 to 1962. Beginning in 1963, it moved to \\"year-around\\" training. In January 1960, Northrop F-89 Scorpion crews assumed an around-the- clock runway alert commitment of two armed aircraft. With this undertaking came the F-89J with an armament platform that included the AIR-2 Genie. The AIR-2A was the first US air-to-air missile with a nuclear warhead. The 176th FIS exchanged their F-89s for the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger in early 1966. 176th Fighter Interceptor Squadron Convair F-102A-75-CO Delta Dagger 56-1279 taking off from Truax Field, Wisconsin, 1970 In May 1966, the group replaced its F-89s with the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger. After a period of retraining in the new supersonic interceptors, the unit resumed its air defense \\"runway alert\\" mission in the spring of 1967. One year later in June 1969, the unit airlifted to Gulfport, Mississippi for summer training, ending six years of \\"year around\\" alerts at their home base. In September 1972, the group's 176th Squadron won the William Tell Competition in the F-102 category. The event, held at Tyndall Air Force Base, included top Air National Guard, Canadian Air Force and active Air Force units worldwide. The competition included 12 teams of 48 aircraft, each team scored on aerial marksmanship, weapons control, weapons loading and maintenance. Forward air control Air National Guard O-2 Skymaster In 1974, the group, named the 115th Fighter-Interceptor Group since 1972, replaced its F-102s with the Cessna O-2A Skymaster forward air control aircraft and became the 115th Tactical Air Support Group. The O-2 was the military version of the Cessna 337 Skymaster, a high wing, twin-boom aircraft with a unique centerline pusher/tractor twin engine configuration. The O-2A was used in forward air control missions, often in conjunction with a ground forward air controller accompanied by a radio operator, maintenance, and driver (ROMAD) team. Its gaining command changed from Air Defense Command to Tactical Air Command.

Pope John Paul II granted the image a Canonical coronation on 28 December 1989, while its official feast is celebrated on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. On 4 August 2012, Pope Benedict XVI sent her a golden pearl rosary for the 450th centennial anniversary in recognition of the piety of the Nicaraguan people. The image is widely known among Nicaraguan Catholics who trace the image's origins with the former ownership of Saint Teresa of Avila and was brought by her brother Rodrigo Ahumada to their land in the mid-16th century.  History  The image measures at 42 centimeters and is believed to be brought to Nicaragua by Rodrigo Ahumada, the brother of Saint Teresa of Avila which pious legends claim ownership prior to the arrival in the country. The image is believed to have a final destination in Peru, but a storm ravaged their galleon ship. The natives in the area venerated the Marian image resulting in the donation to the present shrine, which is believed to be by divine appointment. In 1737, a solemn coronation by the people was granted to the image.http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/engfive.html A letter of 1673 cites a document of 5 January 1626 according to which the statue was given by Saint Teresa of Avila to her brother, who brought it to where it now is and died there. Another document, drawn up in 1751 after a visit to the settlement of El Viejo, where the statue is kept, and citing the 1673 letter, states that the name \\"Nuestra Se√±ora del Viejo\\" was a reference to Saint Teresa's brother, who was then an old man (\\"viejo\\" being Spanish for \\"old\\"). It describes the statue and its adornment, including a crown. A traditional story is that the statue was brought by an old hermit who, when the ship he was travelling on refused to leave the harbour, explained that the statue wished to remain there. A Carmelite report of 1786 recorded the tradition that the statue was a gift of Saint Teresa to her brother or uncle, who was governor of the locality, and that, when he attempted to take the statue with him when transferred to another governorship, storms repeatedly drove his ship back, so that he left the statue there. Another source gives the name of Saint Teresa's brother as Don Lorenzo de Cepeda and repeats the story of the storm forcing him to leave the statue in what was then called Chamulpa and is now El Viejo. The solemn liturgical crowning of the statue by the natives took place in 1747. The papal bull of 28 December 1989 granted her the right to wear a Pontifical crown by Pope John Paul II, who also raised her sanctuary to the status of Minor Basilica on 20 December 1995. Acta Apostolicae Sedis, LXXXVIII (1996), p. 239 Pontifical approbation * Pope John Paul II granted a Canonical coronation to the venerated image on 28 December 1989. The Papal bull was signed and executed by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli. The same Pontiff raised her sanctuary as a Minor Basilica on 20 December 1995 at the request of the Episcopal Conference of Nicaraguan Bishops who designated her as a national Patroness. * Pope Benedict XVI gifted the image a golden rosary with pearl ornamentation on 4 August 2012, in recognition of the 450th anniversary reflected by the piety of Nicaraguan people's. The rosary was delivered in person by the Secretary of the Pontifical Nunciature to Nicaragua, Monsignor Vincenzo Turturro.  Religious iconography The image is a traditional image of the Immaculate Conception, vested in precious fabrics and embroidered French bullion. The blue and white vestments of the Virgin are closely tied to the national flag of Nicaragua, while silver adornments are also part of her ensemble, a common precious metal found abundant in the area.  Feast and veneration The feast of the Marian image is celebrated on December 8, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Various cultural festivities are associated with the image, such as the following: * La Griteria or shouting on celebrating the Virgin Mary's conception at the main Cathedra * The distribution of local sweet cakes and delicacies to children in offering to the Virgin by Caroling songs * The procurement of fireworks and pyrotechnical displays * The cleaning of silver ornaments for the image * The nine-day Novena prayers offered leading up to her feast.

Short biography  Hossein Basria was born on 4 June 1963 in Nokar village, Dashti County, Bushehr Province. When he was in high school, economical issues and his political activities made him leave school and he started working in his father's store. After the Iranian revolution, he joined the Basij group. When Iran-Iraq war started, he wanted to go to battlefields but he was underage and was prevented from entering the war. On 20 April 1981, he was employed in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). He married Sakineh Jokar in 1982.  First battle with United States  At the end of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the Persian Gulf was an unsafe place for Iranians, because Iraqi forces could easily bomb Iranian ships and oil platforms. Also, American naval forces protected other countries passing through the Persian Gulf, especially the Strait of Hormuz. Commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps informed Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of Iran, about American cruisers in the Persian Gulf. Khomeini said: \\"If it was me, i would attack them\\". For this reason, Nader Mahdavi prepared his forces for operations against American cruisers. On 24 July 1987, United States naval forces escorted the Kuwaiti oil tanker al-Rekkah in the Persian Gulf. Al-Rekkah changed to a United States's flag and also changed its name to Bridgeton. The escort mission was assigned to three cruisers of the United States Navy, USS Crommelin, USS Fox, and USS Kidd. The escorted caravan arrived 13 miles west of the Iranian Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf, and hit underwater mines. Nader Mahdavi's mission was preventing Bridgetons movement. A mine explosion caused a 43 square metre dent in the body of the oil tanker. Three cruisers changed their deployment and went behind Bridgeton.  Death  On 8 October 1987, Mahdavi and his soldiers went to Persian Gulf for patrolling and they took one stinger missile. Near the Farsi land, an American Helicopter attacked them in the night and the stinger automatic system activated and shot down one of American helicopters. After a 20-minute battle, Mahdavi was arrested by American forces. Six days after his death, his body was sent to Iran from Oman. His chest was torn by something like a big nail; also, he was shot in his feet and forehead.

The group is at the northern end of the Turquoise Coast islands nature reserve group, a chain of 40 islands spread over a distance of . Geology The islands were formed approximately 10,000 years ago after large fluctuations in sea levels caused erosion on large areas of the continental shelf during periods of glaciation. Large parallel sand dunes then formed and hardened into limestone, forming islands, most of which have been separated from the mainland for 6,500 years. Well preserved Tamala limestone geological features can be found on all of the Turquoise Coast islands, with supra-tidal hard coral fossils being found on the Beagle Islands.

It only requires one host to transmit an infection; however, since this parasite lacks oncomiracidium, it must rely on either the adult or subadult for spread of infection (Roberts and Schmidt, 2009). Found in freshwater, this flatworm is commonly found on the gills and fins of the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. G. turnbulli was said to be host specific, but an experiment where parasitologists artificially infected guppies suggests that the parasite can infect a wider range of species. This ability is achievable by host switching, which promotes speciation. Morphology Posterior end of a Gyrodactylus sp., showing the hamuli used to attach to the host. This monogenean can measure up to 2 cm in length. It has two seminal vesicles, large vitelline follicles, and anchors called hamuli. The hamuli are attached to an opistohaptor located on the dorsal side the flatworm, which is used to latch onto guppies. Attachment to the fish allows G. turnbulli to feed on the gills using its prohaptor, which is located on the anterior end. These parasites are hermaphroditic and viviparous, with a fully grown embryo existing in the utero. Life cycle Gyrodactylus turnbulli has a direct life cycle, meaning they can reproduce without an intermediate host. They have an egg cell formation region (ECFR) in replacement for an ovary, where eggs and sperm are stored. This is also the location where embryos develop. Each juvenile worm contains multiple generations of the parasite, which can be described as a \\"Russian doll\\". After a worm is born, that worm contains the next generation worm, and that next generation worm holds the following generation. Once the final juvenile worm has been born, the egg in the ECFR is fertilized to continue reproducing Gyrodactylus worms. High water temperature increases the maturation rate to a few days, but low water temperature can delay maturation rate for up to five or six months. Transmission Guppy (Poecilia reticulata), the host of Gyrodactylus turnbulli. After the juvenile worm has matured to an adult/subadult transmission can occur, but only if the host is in close proximity. Successful infection causes Poeciliids to swim erratically; it also causes their dorsal fin to become flattened. If there is no host close enough for the parasite to be transmitted, G. turnbulli rests on the water‚Äôs surface. Once guppies begin to feed on the surface, the flatworm can attach to the host. While the parasite feeds, the fish‚Äôs fins contract and eventually die. After death of the host, the parasite can easily leave the host, wait at the surface, and continue to infect Poeciliids that are nearby. Diagnosis Gyrodactylus turnbulli infection can be diagnosed by performing a biopsy. Surgical removal of the parasite would be needed if it is detected on the fish. Treatment Most possible treatments to rid of the infection are not approved by the FDA. For example, praziquantel‚Äîa common drug used to cure most parasitic infections‚Äîcan irritate fish gills and cause death. Monogeneans also have the ability to survive praziquantel treatment because they can be protected by mucus that the fish produces. Hydrogen peroxide (300‚Äì560 mg/L) can also cure infection, but is not recommended because a Poeciliids cannot handle a high dosage. Formalin, a solution that is approved by the FDA, can be used to treat freshwater fish; however, it removes a large amount of oxygen from water. As a result, high aeration must be added in conjunction with formalin. Prevention Infection of Poecilia reticulata by Gyrodactylus turnbulli can be prevented by dipping the freshwater fish in salt water, since the ectoparasite rests in rivers and streams. Stress hormones are also a contributing factor for G. turnbulli infection, for these hormones inhibit the Poeciliid‚Äôs immune respond, and promotes monogenean reproduction.

The image is known to have escaped the Japanese war on bombing of Guam on 8 December 1941, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. It is permanently enshrined at the Minor Basilica of the Most Sweet Name of Mary.  History  Pious legends claim that the image was brought by Spaniards through the Galleon ship Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de Zaragoza y Santiago which was shipwrecked on 2 June 1690 at the Cocos Island of Guam. The image is thought to have been enshrined on the ship by its sailors. One account of its discovery holds that a fisherman found the statue along the shore of Merizo. He saw the image accompanied by crabs with votive candles, later interpreted as miraculous by the natives in the area. The image later gained the title of Kamalen, literally Barracks due to the image being stored in a nearby infantry compound after it was found by the fisherman. The image measures approximately 28 inches and weighs 48 pounds. The image is composed of polychromed Molave wood and ivory head and hands and wears a wig of human hair. Caretakers of the image rescued the statue on 8 December 1941 at the beginning of the Second World War, when the image was hidden for safekeeping. The image was enshrined at the cathedral again on 8 December 1945, on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. In 1948, the image was brought to the Philippines for professionally restoration by renowned Filipino Santero artist M√°ximo Vicente, who also restored the Black Nazarene of Quiapo. Popular legends also recount the image surviving the 1902 earthquake in Guam, which destroyed the shrine and many statues within the church but left the image intact. Veneration The image was stolen on three separate occasions: 19 May 1968, 3 May 1971 and 28 December 1992; it was always returned out of piety. A replica is enshrined for public veneration at the main church, while the original ivory statue is enshrined above the high altar. Today, the image is suspended above the high altar with no possibility of reaching it from the sides. A digital alarm is installed on its pedestal which is accompanied by the main caretaker of the image. Behind its niche is three panels of locked doors, accessible only by a staircase through the old rectory entrance. Pope John Paul II mentioned the image on 22 February 1981 during his Apostolic visit.

He relocated to Brazil prior to his episcopal appointment where he worked to establish the ecclesial institutions on a solid basis and opposed government efforts to control the ecclesial workings that he believed were under the domain of the episcopal superiors while he also was attentive to the needs of the poor in his diocese. In the face of strong opposition he ordained the first black slave ever to become a priest who was Blessed Francisco de Paula Victor. His patron was Pedro II who titled him the \\"Count of Concei√ß√£o\\" and made him an Imperial Counselor. Pedro II held the bishop in high esteem enough to the point that the two were collaborators and that Pedro II had granted him the Imperial Order of Christ and gave him the rank of officer of the Imperial Order of the Rose. The cause for his beatification commenced after the bishop had died and culminated in 2014 after he was titled as Venerable once Pope Francis confirmed his life of heroic virtue. Life Ant√¥nio Jos√© Ferreira Vi√ßoso was born in mid-1787 in Peniche in the Kingdom of Portugal to Jacinto Ferreira Vi√ßoso and Maria Gertrudes; his paternal grandparents were Francisco Ferreira Vi√ßoso and Joana Maria while his maternal grandparents were Luis dos Rem√©dios and Joana Francisca. In 1796 his father entrusted him to the Carmelite friars for his initial education. In 1802 he felt drawn to service as a priest and so commenced his studies for that in Santar√©m. He studied there until 1809 after which he returned to his home. During his time back home he examined his future course in life and at last felt a call to enter the Congregation of the Mission. He enrolled in their institute as a seminarian in the Rilhafoles sector of Lisbon on 11 July 1811 to prepare himself for his ordination and began his novitiate with the order on 25 July. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 7 March 1818 after which he was sent to teach philosophical studies to seminarians at the order's institute in √âvora. In 1819 he was assigned to establish his order in Brazil which was then part of the Portuguese empire. He arrived alongside a companion - Leandro Rebelo Peixoto e Castro - in 1820 and the two settled in the Minas Gerais province. It was there that the pair founded the Col√©gio do Cara√ßa and another in Jacuecanga before establishing another later in Angra dos Reis. He also assisted in a number of parishes throughout the province. He spent almost two decades in these ministries, until he was appointed in 1837 as the first superior of the order's newest ecclesiastical province in Brazil. His patron and friend Pedro II nominated for the office of Bishop of Mariana on 15 July 1843 and this received official papal confirmation from Pope Gregory XVI on 22 January 1844. He then received his episcopal consecration as a bishop from Manoel de Monte Rodrigues de Ara√∫jo - the Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro - on 5 May 1844 at the Nossa Senhora do Monserrate in Rio de Janeiro. The new bishop first focused on the reform of the education seminarians were receiving in order to bring it into line with the mandates of the Council of Trent on the formation of prospective priests. To accomplish this he entrusted its operation to colleagues in his order in keeping with one of the goals of their congregation. He was an ultramontane and sought to establish the independence of the Roman Catholic Church from the efforts of the imperial court of Brazil to dominate it. In a controversial case he became the first bishop to accept a black slave as a candidate for the priesthood and when he was called upon in 1849 to consider the desire of Blessed Francisco de Paula Victor to pursue this calling he chose to break all precedent and overrule canon law in accepting him as a seminarian. In the process he risked jeopardizing the position of the ecclesial authorities in a social landscape in which possessing slaves was still legal and formed a crucial part of the Brazilian economic enterprise. He himself ordained the former slave in 1851. In 1854 he sent a letter to Pope Pius IX after the latter proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception while Vi√ßoso praised the pope for the move in his letter to him. He admired Saint Anthony of Lisbon and Saint Teresa of √Åvila while striving to base his episcopal mission on the example of Saint Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori. The bishop created the parish of S√£o Sebasti√£o de S√£o Gotardo on 19 July 1872 and he also oversaw the construction of new schools and kindergartens. His patron Pedro II - on 7 March 1868 - titled him as the \\"Count of Concei√ß√£o\\" and also made him an Imperial Counselor. The relationship between the pair was great enough to the point that Pedro II also granted Vi√ßoso with the Order of the Rose (with the rank of officer) and the Order of Christ. He died in his residence in mid-1875. The Archbishop of Mariana Silv√©rio Gomes Pimenta - also the late bishop's godson - wrote a biographical of his predecessor. Beatification process The process for his beatification took place under the tenure of his archbishop godson who initiated the process in Mariana on 16 July 1916 during World War I and later oversaw its successful conclusion on 22 February 1922; the cause's initiation allowed for him to be titled as a Servant of God. But Archbishop Silv√©rio Gomes Pimenta's death in August 1922 put a halt to the cause. It was not re- opened until a later bishop - Oscar de Oliveira - received permission from the competent ecclesial authorities to do so in 1985. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints under Pope John Paul II issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause which would allow for its resumption. The archdiocese opened a diocesan process in 1985 which concluded on 10 October 1986 while documentation was sent in boxes to the C.C.S. in Rome who validated the process later on 13 June 1998. The postulation compiled and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 2002 for further assessment at which stage historians approved it on 23 April 2002 after meeting. Theologians likewise approved the cause a decade later on 1 March 2013 as did the members of the C.C.S. on 2 March 2014. Pope Francis confirmed on 8 July 2014 that Vi√ßoso had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue and so named him as Venerable. One miracle must be investigated and approved for him to be beatified and it must be one science and medicine cannot explain. One such case was investigated in Mariana from 13 December 2007 until the conclusion of the diocesan investigation on 22 May 2010. The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Shijo Kanjirathamkunnel.

Description The Emoia skinks, of which the Christmas Island forest skink was the most ancestral member, are a large group with marked radiation on islands in the Pacific. The forest skink is about 20 cm long, thickset, ground-dwelling, and active during the day. Its body is a chocolate-brown colour and unpatterned. The species was found in forest clearings, usually in leaf litter. Discovery The Christmas Island forest skink was described by George Albert Boulenger in 1887 based on a single tailless specimen.Boulenger GA (1888) the Reptiles of Christmas Island\\" Proc. Zool. Soc. London: 534-536. Subsequently, eight specimens were collected by naturalist Joseph Jackson Lister.

Retrieved 26 December 2015. However, populations plummeted during the 1990s and 2000s by up to 98%. In 2003, the species was limited to fragmented pockets in remote parts of the island, and a targeted survey in 2008 found the species at only a single site. The cause of the species' rapid decline is still unknown, although possibilities include predation by yellow crazy ants, giant centipedes, wolf snakes, and cats; competition with five introduced reptile species; poisoning from insecticides; and disease.

Following Gump's death, herpetologists John Woinarski and Hal Cogger wrote that: \\"For the Forest Skink, the trajectory of decline and the fruitlessness of dedicated searches provide reasonable grounds to presume extinction, although this conclusion may take some years to be officially recognised.\\" If true, this would represent Australia's first reptile extinction since European colonisation.

Early life Wu Yuanzhen () was born on 14 January 1957, in Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei province, China as the youngest daughter of a family of six brothers and sisters. As a child, Wu read books belonging to her relatives about Buddhism, Christianity and Taoism. Before the Cultural Revolution, she was able to finish high school and began working as an accountant, but no options for formal higher education were open to her. Wu began self-study, reading texts on philosophy, theology and enlightenment and at the age of 23 she followed an older sister's lead, making a commitment to Taoism, and changed her name to Wu Chengzhen. Career Early career Wu began work as a cook and gardener at the Changchun Taoist Temple of Wuhan. She studied with Xie Zhongxin, the 22nd fangzhang of Baiyun Temple in Beijing and after four years, in March 1984 she became a monk. The Changchun Temple, built during the Yuan dynasty, is one of the most important in China. In 1995, Wu was appointed the temple's zhuchi (lower-ranking abbess), and was selected as vice president of the Taoist Association of Wuhan. One of her main duties is fundraising. Taoist clergy depend on public donations for their public works projects. Wu reportedly has around 10,000 followers who annually donate at least 2 million yuan (US$292,920), used to care for the poor and children who have dropped out of school, widows, as well as for construction projects for bridges, roads, schools, and disaster relief. Later career In 2001, Wu completed a master's degree in philosophy at Huazhong University of Science and Technology She became president of both the Hubei province and Wuhan Taoist Associations in 2007. In 2009, Wu began studying for her doctorate degree at Renmin University of China with a thesis topic which evaluates the function of Taoism in creating a harmonious society. In 2009, she was unanimously elected by all of the leaders in all the Changchun Temple's departments to serve as their principal abbess. Her ordination was held on 15 November, 2009. In 2014, Wu traveled to the United States and helped found the U.S. Taoist Association.

He joined NSU in 1948, becoming the company's chairman in 1953. Following the takeover of the company by Volkswagen, he stayed on as chairman of the new conglomerate's Audi-NSU division till 31 March 1971 when he retired following a heart attack. Life Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf was born into an old Prussian aristocratic-military family in Berlin during the economically dynamic first decade of the twentieth century. His father died in 1907. Between 1923 and 1927 he studied Mechanical engineering at the Braunschweig University of Technology, emerging with an engineering doctorate in 1929.Entry for Stieler von Heydekampf's doctoral dissertation in the online catalogue of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek He then spent several years working in the United States. Here he worked first for Babcock & Wilcox and then with Baldwin Locomotive Works. On returning to Germany he joined Adam Opel AG, Germany's largest automobile manufacturer, which in 1929 had been acquired by the US based General Motors Corporation (as it was known at the time). Within Opel von Heydekampf was soon promoted, in 1936 joining the board and taking charge of the company's purchasing function. Further promotion followed in October 1938 when he took over as General Manager, in succession to Hanns Grewenig, at Opel's new Brandenburg truck plant. R√©gime change hit Germany in January 1933 and the Hitler government lost little time in imposing one-party government. The same year Stieler von Heydekampf became a Nazi Party member. He was then, in 1935, appointed a Wehrwirtschaftsf√ºhrer (literally \\"military economic leader\\"), a quasi-military honour given by government to senior industry figures expected to be supportive in any future military rearmament programme. In 1942 he left Opel where he was succeeded at the Brandenburg plant by Heinrich Nordhoff. Stieler von Heydekampf relocated to Kassel, becoming Director General at Henschel & Son and deputy chairman of the Henschel Group. Henschel had by this time become a major producer of tanks, and on 21 December 1943 he took over from Ferdinand Porsche the chairmanship of the Tanks Commission operating under Albert Speer's Ministry for Armaments and War Production. In effect this meant that Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf was now in charge of Germany's tank production until the war ended in May 1945. He presided over Germany's all-time tank production record year of 1944. Following the end of the war Stieler von Heydekampf worked as a consultant to the NSU company in Neckarsulm, becoming an employee in 1948. In 1950 he joined the company's board, with responsibility for purchasing. Three years later, in 1953, he took over as General Director and Chairman. Under his leadership by 1955, with output of slightly less than 300,000 units, NSU had become the world's largest producer of motorcycles. In 1957 the company was also able to return to automobile production, after a gap of 28 years. Following a pilot run of 150 preproduction cars, volume production began in March 1958. Under Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf the NSU company returned to automobile production in 1957/58. NSU Ro80 The 1960s were boom years for the German automobile industry. Following the bankruptcy in 1960 of the Borgward Group, the volume end of the business was represented by five domestic producers, of which Volkswagen, thanks to the runaway success of the Beetle, and Opel, supported by frequent model changes and the deep pockets of General Motors, dominated the sales charts. The other three, Auto Union-DKW, Ford and NSU survived with smaller market shares and all three struggled to fund new model investment. NSU had nevertheless acquired a license to develop the Wankel engine, during the 1960s investing lavishly in developing Wankel powered models of their own. Under Stieler von Heydekampf the first Wankel powered car, a small low volume open topped sports car, the NSU Spider, appeared in 1964. However, it was the appearance in 1967 of the futuristic NSU Ro 80 which caught the attention both of the pundits and of the business press. Unfortunately, however, the ability of the engine to rotate faster, even before the engine had warmed up, than the developers had provided for led to major reliability problems for the Ro80. Massive enthusiasm for the car's virtues was accompanied by massive warranty costs as the company found itself replacing engines that had lost pressure in their revolutionary combustion chambers. Even in September 1963, when the Spider had first been exhibited at the Frankfurt Motor Show, doubts had been expressed as to whether a company the size of NSU would have the financial capability properly to develop and produce a car that was such a departure from the industry norm. The Ro80 represented a far more substantial and important investment than the Spider: it seemed the company had not been able to apply sufficient financial resource to developing the it ahead of launch. Problems were exacerbated by insufficient training in preparation for the new technology across the company's dealership network. Engine problems were addressed in 1969 when the \\"soft carbon\\" used for the rotor-tip seals was replaced with a harder compound, and this development was accompanied with the fitting of a warning device that provided drivers with audible discouragement when they exceeded recommended engine speeds, but the reputational damage and the shortage of technical expertise across the dealership network was not so quickly addressed, and in the end only 37,395 Ro80s were manufactured, which was nothing like enough to recover the massive amounts invested in developing the car. Having gambled massively on the commercial success of the Ro80, Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf's final years at the helm of NSU were spent trying to save the company from bankruptcy. One answer to the cost of developing the Ro80 was to team up with a larger automobile producer, and in 1967 it appeared that a solution might have presented itself in the shape of Citro√´n, already famous as a producer of futuristic cars, albeit cars which (less famously) were powered by relatively conventional engines that traced their origins back to the 1930s. In 1967 a partnership was announced whereby Citro√´n would invest substantially in development of the Wankel engine and, in return, manufacture and install the power units in their own cars. The commercial details of the deal were fearsomely complicated, and Stieler von Heydekampf had to confess that the unequal financial muscle that the two companies brought to the table might, ultimately, threaten NSU's independence. (\\"Ein finanzielles √úbergewicht von Citro√´n ist nat√ºrlich zu bef√ºrchten.\\" / \\"a financial preponderance from Citro√´n is naturally something that we fear.\\") By the time NSU had completely run out of financial options, however, two years later, Citro√´n's own financial problems had intensified and their enthusiasm for the Wankel project had begun to cool. It was Volkswagen that acquired the company. NSU still enjoyed a healthy income stream (with the possibility of more to come) from the licensing deals entered into back in 1966 with well over a dozen automakers including Daimler-Benz, General Motors, Porsche and Toyo Kogyo (Mazda): in the highly pressured negotiations the NSU shareholders were keen to avoid passing over to Volkswagen shareholders the potential income stream from future Wankel engine production by licensees. The deal that emerged was described in the press reports of the time as a \\"Fusion\\" (merger). Volkswagen had indeed acquired more than 50% of the shares in NSU, but the deal expressly reserved to the existing shareholders the income stream anticipated from the licensing deals for the Wankel engine. Interviewed in March 1969, Stieler von Heydekampf insisted that the deal was \\"not a sale [of the NSU business] but a transaction\\" (\\"...handelt es sich nicht um einen Verkauf, sondern um eine Transaktion, bei der die Majorit√§t beim Volkswagenwerk liegt....\\"). It was nevertheless widely reported that Stieler von Heydekampf had been forced to agree to the \\"transaction\\" in order to secure the survival of NSU. Volkswagen, who were by now encountering unplanned financial headwinds as the world's appetite for the Beetle finally appeared to have been satisfied, merged the NSU business with the Audi business which they had acquired five years earlier in another convoluted deal. During the next few years Volkswagen acquired the remaining NSU shares. Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf stayed on as Chairman of Audi-NSU AG till 1971 when a heart attack triggered his retirement. His successor was Rudolf Leiding who himself would resign from Audi NSU before the year was out in order to take the top job at Volkswagen itself. In 1975 Audi- NSU AG moved its head office out of the Neckarsulm building from which Stieler von Heydekampf had directed NSU, to a new head office on the spacious Audi site at Ingolstadt in Bavaria. Burial arrangements Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf and his wife lived for many years in Heilbronn. They also owned a second house in Stocksberg, a hamlet in the hills to the east of the city. In 1963 Stieler von Heydekampf hit the headlines nationally when he endowed a chapel with a little bell tower and a small cemetery at Stocksberg.

Its remains have been found at the Konzentrat-Lagerst√§tte of La Venta in the Honda Group of Colombia. The type species is N. rubricae.Nuciruptor rubricae in the Paleobiology Database  Etymology  The name Nuciruptor rubricae is derived from the Latin nuci (\\"nut\\") and ruptor meaning \\"to break\\".Kay & Meldrum, 1997, p.409 Rubricae refers to the red beds where the fossils have been found.Kay & Meldrum, 1997, p.410  Description  A lower mandible fossil of Nuciruptor was discovered in the El Card√≥n redbeds of the Cerro Colorado Member of the Villavieja Formation, Honda Group, just below the San Francisco Sandstone which has been dated to the Laventan, about 12.8 ¬± 0.2 Ma. From the same locality, fossils of Saimiri annectens were recovered.Kay & Meldrum, 1997, p.437 Nuciruptor resembles living pitheciins in having elongate, procumbent, and styliform lower incisors with very weak lingual heels. Moreover, as in living pitheciins, the incisors are set in a procumbently oriented mandibular symphysis, and its mandibular corpus deepens appreciably under the molars. At the same time, Nuciruptor does not possess several of the distinctive synapomorphies of extant pitheciins. Nuciruptor remains more primitive than living pitheciins in that no diastema separates its lower incisors from the canine. Its lower canines retain the primitive structure in not having a sharply deÔ¨Åned protocristid. P2 is not a robust or high-crowned tooth and does not have a metaconid. Nor are the other premolars molarised by the addition of large talonids.Kay & Meldrum, 1997, p.421 The estimated weight of Nuciruptor was .Silvestro, 2017, p.14 The genus shows similarity with another fossil primate from La Venta, Cebupithecia.Defler, 2004, p.34 As Cebupithecia, Nuciruptor is thought to be an ancestral saki (Pitheciidae).Takai et al., 2001, p.290Tejedor, 2013, p.28  Habitat  The Honda Group, and more precisely the \\"Monkey Beds\\", are the richest site for fossil primates in South America.Rosenberger & Hartwig, 2001, p.3 It has been argued that the monkeys of the Honda Group were living in habitat that was in contact with the Amazon and Orinoco Basins, and that La Venta itself was probably seasonally dry forest.Lynch Alfaro et al., 2015, p.520  See also  * List of primates of Colombia * Lagonimico * Mohanamico  References   Bibliography       Further reading   Prehistoric primate genera Prehistoric monkeys ‚Ä†Nuciruptor Miocene genus first appearances Miocene extinctions Miocene primates of South America Laventan Neogene Colombia Fossils of Colombia Honda Group, Colombia Fossil taxa described in 1997 ","title":"Nuciruptor"},{"id":"48743281","text":"Lugushwa Airport is an airstrip serving the gold-mining townLugushwa Project of Lugushwa in Sud-Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

His two London-published books, The Russian Government's Documents on the Old Believers (1860‚Äî1862, in 4 volumes) and The Collected Russian Government's Regulations on the Old Believers (1863, in 2 volumes) were met with interest back in his homeland and received at least one favourable review, by the conservative Russky Vestnik.The Latest Feats of Our London Agitators // –ù–æ–≤—ã–µ –ø–æ–¥–≤–∏–≥–∏ –Ω–∞—à–∏—Ö –ª–æ–Ω–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∞–≥–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤.

Kenning became one of the early pioneers in selling, servicing and financing the use of motor vehicles by industry, commerce and individuals. At the time of his death, the firm had a turnover of ¬£20m. Kenning was also active as a local councillor and benefactor. He was knighted in 1943.Primary (newspaper) source: AND secondary (web) source: Life Kenning was born in 1880. His father Frank had started a door-to-door hardware retail business two years before. By 1891, he was helping his father in his business which was now based at a hardware shop on the high street in Clay Cross, but also had a stall at Chesterfield market. Business career Kenning started his own paraffin distribution business in 1901, distributing with a horse-drawn cart. In 1908, he launched two new businesses: hiring bicycles to Shell-Mex travelling salesmen and hiring horses to pull British Petroleum wagons. These were pioneering examples of what is now termed \\"contract hire\\". This hire business continued to grow until, in 1970, the Kennings Group had a hire fleet of 5,000 vehicles. In 1910, Kenning started his first motor sales agency, for BSA Royal Enfield motorcycles. His first motor car agency was with Ford in 1916. Three years later Kenning became the sole agency for Morris Motors in Derbyshire. He became a long-term business associate and friend of another pioneer of widespread car ownership, Lord Nuffield. Nuffield was the manufacturer of Morris cars. Alongside car agencies, he set up supporting businesses like forecourt petrol sales, car servicing and car spares sales. Soon after that, he won the first agency granted by the truck-making firm Dennis. In 1925, he began an association with Reeve Burgess, a firm that made truck and bus bodies for mounting on lorry frames. Vehicle-building became another subsidiary business of the Kenning empire, producing milk floats in Shrewsbury and road tankers in Ossett. Another subsidiary business was car valeting and in 1939, sophisticated valeting equipment was installed at both the London and Sheffield sites. Kenning became the first agents in the UK for Lucas electrical components and the first for the Tyresoles system of remoulding tyres for longer life. He also set up the Midlands Counties Motor Finance Company. The subsidiary businesses around tyres started by Kenning were subsequently developed and became one of the largest suppliers of car, commercial and earth mover tyres in the country. Kennings also operated three tyre remoulding factories and marketed their own label, Fisk and John Bull, tyres. Kennings was registered as a private company with a capital of ¬£100,000 in 1930; in 1939 it converted to a public company. Public service George Kenning was very active in public life. He served on the now defunct Clay Cross Urban District council as well as being a councillor and alderman on Derbyshire County Council. Kenning could have stood for election as a Liberal member of parliament but he refused to be nominated. As a Justice of the Peace, he served on the bench of the local magistrates court and he was a member of the Chesterfield Hospital Board of Management. He was an active member of the Methodist Church in Clay Cross as well as being a member of the freemasons. Kenning provided a recreation ground for use by the people of Clay Cross. This was named \\"Kenning Park\\" and is located on Holmgate Road to the west of the town. As a result of his contribution to public life, the-then Alderman George Kenning, JP, was awarded a knighthood (\\"Knight Bachelor\\") in the 1943 New Year Honours \\"for public services in Derbyshire\\". He then became known as \\"Sir George Kenning\\".Citation contained in 1943 New Year Honours. Properties Business premises The National Garage in Bridlington was Kennings. Former Kennings car showroom on Queen Street, Derby Former Kennings offices on High Street, Clay Cross Kenning had a large number of business premises. They ranged from car showrooms in city centres to tyre factories and office blocks on the outskirts of towns. The showrooms in Leadmill Road, Sheffield and Queen Street, Derby occupied what would now be called \\"prime retail\\" sites in city-centre locations. They were architect-designed and followed the Art Deco architecture style that was prevalent at the time of building. The premises in Queen Street, Derby were the subject of a special ceremony when they opened in 1930. Kenning had his first branch in Derby in 1926, but spent ¬£20,000 on building \\"Morris House\\" on a more prestigious site. As well as a car showroom for Morris cars, the depot incorporated garages, repair shops and stores. It was opened by George's business associate and friend, Sir William Morris (later Lord Nuffield), who built cars that were affordable to the middle classes at his works in Cowley, Oxford. The offices in Clay Cross and the HQ Manor Office building on Old Road in Chesterfield were also notable for their architecture. Mention also needs to be made of the premises in Clay Cross where the Kenning empire first started. Frank Kenning's first shop (selling hardware) is at the junction of King Street with the southern end of High Street. The car service building is on a road named Kenning Street. There is also an Art Deco style office building (now the Tower Business Park) towards the northern end of High Street. Residences George lived in a variety of houses during his lifetime, starting in Clay Cross and died at Stumperlowe Hall in Sheffield in 1956. Prior to that he lived at Baslow Hall in the Peak District. The Kenning family is also associated with Eastwood Grange in Ashover and Great Longstone Hall. Death and legacy By the time of his death in 1956, Kenning had the largest set of car dealerships in Derbyshire and he had 80 dealerships spread over 18 counties. The business employed 2,000 people. At the time of Kenning's death, the firm had a turnover of ¬£20m. 500 people attended Kenning's funeral in 1956. Obituaries appeared in The Times, and the Derbyshire Times. His widow bought Stumperlowe Hall in Sheffield the following year and this house would become a family residence.\\"Sheffield's Remarkable Houses\\", Roger Redfern, The Cottage Press, , Pages 30/31 The petrol forecourt business started by Kenning was expanded by his successors; Kenning Motor Group built the Motorway Service sites at Strensham M5 and Anderton M61. As at 2015, the Kenning family's interests in the motor trade has spanned 4 generations, starting with Sir George's father, Frank. Note that all but the first generation had a family member named George. Subsequent to his death, George Kenning commissioned two official biographies.

Retrieved from lecture at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 2016., and it has become apparent that the same shift has happened to Longquan Monastery. The scientific modifications in Longquan Monastery can be described in the sense that there is a shift from deep philosophy to more practical teachings, such as resolving family conflict. Longquan Monastery has become a haven for a distinct brand of Buddhism, one that preaches connectivity instead of seclusion and emphasizes practical advice over deep philosophy. When the monastery reopened in 2005, it was equipped with fingerprint scanners, webcams and iPads for studying sutras, or Buddhist texts. Moreover, the leader of the monastery, the Venerable Xuecheng, stated that Buddhism can stay relevant only by embracing modern tools and that it is no longer realistic to expect people to attend daily lectures. Modern tools that were once deemed as a form of distraction have now been ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù incorporated into Longquan Monastery.

History Indian community As in other parts of the British Caribbean, arriving indentured laborers from India brought the custom of smoking ganja with them, but this habit had fallen from fashion by the early part of the 20th century. Early legislation In 1861, British Guiana passed a law entitled An Ordinance to Regulate the Sale of Opium and Bhang. Indian Hemp Ordinance British Guiana passed its Indian Hemp Ordinance in 1913. Rastafarian usage In the 1970s, the Rastafari philosophy gained popularity in Guyana, and along with it came an increased interest in cannabis. In 2015, Guyanese Rastafarians staged a demonstration at the Attorney General's office calling for the decriminalization of cannabis, spurred by the recent arrest of former football star Vibert Butts. Prevalence The 2006 UN World Drug Report estimated that 2.6% of Guyanese age 15-64 had used cannabis that year, and as of 2009 it was reported as the most prevalent drug in the country. Production Cannabis is generally sold within Guyana, rather than trafficked abroad. Its cannabis grows year-round, and is of a high grade, but is largely consumed locally rather than exported. Enforcement Anti-cannabis operations are conducted by both the drug enforcement unit (founded in 1975) of the Guyana Police Force and by the Guyana Defence Force.

It is located on a trapezoidal lot at the corner of Nicanor Reyes st. (previously Morayta st.) and Lerma St. facing Espa√±a Boulevard. The building possesses a fa√ßade both from its original design in 1932 (Lerma side) and the post war renovation in 1960 (Nicanor Reyes side) both designed by Filipino architect Pablo Antonio Sr. who is well known for Art Deco and later on became a National Artist in Architecture in 1976. Possibly the oldest still standing work of Pablo Antonio Sr. as of 2016. History The construction of the Afable building started in 1931-1932 as the Afable of College and Medicine and Surgery that was reported to be located at Espana and Morayta (Nicanor Reyes) streets. In 1934-35, its affiliated hospital, the \\"Manila City Hospital of Dr. V. Afable\\" was built; also by designed Pablo Antonio Sr. Both buildings were named in honor of Dr. Valentin Afable, a notable physician, Lone district representative of Zambales (1938-1946), and founder of said college. At the beginning of 1940 there were 4909 licensed physicians in the Philippines or one physician for every 3216 inhabitants. About 90 percent of them were Filipinos and great majority were graduates of local medical colleges, of which there were four. The College of Medicine and Surgery of University of Santo tomas, College of Medicine and the Graduate School of Hygiene and Public Health of University of the Philippines, and the Afable College of Medicine At some point after World War II, the college could no longer sustain itself. Manila Central University acquired the facilities of the Manila City Hospital and the Afable College of Medicine and Surgery at 1947 for their Medicine and Nursing colleges.  Architectural details  Based on old photographs and amateur observations, the previous pre-war Afable was symmetrical both having exits facing Espana and Morayta st, an overhang with a classical cornice design supported each by a single cylindrical column. Overlapping flat slabs at the rear and sides. Post war renovations removed it of its symmetry. Instead an arcade of art deco design opening that side with multiple windows and spiral-like grills at each balcony. Afable Building Facade Sculptures The facade shows an inscription to when it was built and when the arcade was added. What is interesting to notice is the small bass-relief crowning the facade which shows 6 humanoid figures * Left: A muscular male holding a hammer near an anvil and cogwheel facing towards the tall female figure. * Middle: A tall female similar to Lady Justice holding a large sword on her left hand and a rod of hermes on the right. Beside her are two smaller figures wearing the same cloth. * Right: A female balancing to what appears to be a basket near piles of hay and a young figure sitting which could be her child. It is possible that this bass-relief could be the work of Italian sculptor Francesco Monti, considering some of Pablo Antonio's buildings have Monti's work Incorporated in them. Examples are the White Cross Orphanage building and the Administration building of Far Eastern University Manila. Post-war In 1956 the Afable building was renovated by same architect Pablo Antonio Sr. with an arcade facing Morayta st (Nicanor Reyes st), completed in 1960 into a modern post-war Art deco structure. The renovation altered the building's symmetrical design to what the present structure looks like today. The intention of the renovation is still unknown. A part of the annex was demolished sometime in 1970s. Current status The Afable building today is not well maintained and functions as a mixed-use retail at the ground floor while most of the remaining floors are part of the Louella Dormitory. Much of the interiors have been modified to fit its current use and the only areas left original are the exterior architectural details, metal railings, windows, and others that have not been overrun by gross alterations.

Built in Singapore and converted into a Powership in Turkey, she was commissioned in 2011 to supply electricity to the power grid in Pakistan. Vessel She was built in Singapore as a specialized submersible vessel and christened STX Rose 1. Powership End January 2011, she arrived at Port of Karachi, Pakistan joining , the first Powership of the fleet, which came to Korangi on November 17, 2010. The total installed capacity of the two Powerships amounted 330 MW, while the contract capacity of the power purchase agreement was 232 MW. The Powerships were able to meet almost 50% of the electricity power needs of the 18 million people in Karachi. Dispute In the wake of political contentions in Pakistan, the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared on March 30, 2011 that all rental power plants (RPP) are illegal and the operating RPPs have to be closed. In March 2012, the Karadeniz Energy Group (Karkey) annulled the energy purchase agreement - a RPP contract- with the Pakistan National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which covered the service of the Powerships MV KPS Kaya Bey and the later stationed MV KPS Alican Bey. The reason was that the Pakistani side failed to perform their obligations in payments and oil supply. By the end of October 2012, the Pakistani government ordered the repayment of the unused deposit in amount of US$17.2 million from the Turkish partner before the ships can leave. Upon a complaint filed by a politician in the Parliament of Pakistan, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered the seizure of the retained Powerships due to a fine of US$120 million demanded by the NAB. The case went to international arbitration on March 11, 2013. On May 16, 2014 after two years of retainment, LPS Kaya Bey left Karachi heading Dubai for repairs and maintenance in compliance with an intermediate decision of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). On August 1 the same year, a second decision of the ICSID enabled the definitive and lasting release of the Powership. The dispute was also subject of talks at highest- level of politicians between the both countries' prime ministers and state presidents. It was reported that KPS Alican Bey and two other vessels of the Turkish company were still in retainment by August 2014. Tribunal constituted under the World Bank‚Äôs arbitral center, ICSID, issued the award in August 2017 in favor of Karkey in the case filed by Karkey against Pakistan. Pakistan has been sentenced to pay the company one of the highest compensation amounts under ICSID.

Knight, and Rumer Willis and follows 10 lost souls across 10 periods in New York City history. The daisy-chained musical explores love's bittersweet embrace as the pursued become the pursuer and slip in and out of one another's arms, spinning through 10 music-fueled vignettes which come together in 1 soulful circle.  Plot Summary  The Whore and The Soldier In 1901, an American soldier is walking through the streets of New York City at night when he is approached by a prostitute who flirts with him. She takes the soldier to a boathouse on the river where they have sex. Afterwards, she meekly asks him for pay, but the soldier coldly rebukes her and leaves. The prostitute is angry when she realizes he has stolen her jeweled brooch. The Soldier and The Nurse In 1942, a soldier goes to a party being held in an underground canteen. He notices a pretty nurse carrying a tray and begins flirting with her, asking her to spend the night with him as he is shipping out to war the next day. The nurse is shy at first but eventually gives in, and they have sex outside in a car. The nurse asks the soldier to walk her home, but he leaves her sitting alone in the rain to get a drink. The Nurse and The College Boy In 1967, a nurse is hired to take care of a wealthy college student who has injured his ankle playing tennis. The boy awkwardly attempts to flirt with the nurse. When his mother leaves, the nurse surprises him by seducing him in his bedroom, even tying him up and gagging him during their romp. Afterwards, the boy jokes about no longer needing a nurse, offending her enough that she walks out, leaving him tied up. The College Boy and The Young Wife In 1929, a college student sneaks out to the movies to meet his lover, a young married woman. When she attempts to perform oral sex on him during the film, he is unable to get an erection, and privately admits to himself that he is only attracted to her when he cannot have her. She gets upset and tries to leave, but he convinces her that he loves her, and they try again. He eventually manages to climax, but when his lover asks him when they can next meet, he only makes vague promises before abruptly leaving. The Young Wife and The Husband In 1956, a married couple are getting ready to go see a play for their first anniversary. The wife, who is much younger than her husband, dresses in revealing lingerie and attempts to seduce him, but he acts uninterested, and talks about how sinful it is for people to desire \\"carnal gratification\\". The wife eventually asks her husband if he loves her, and although he claims he does, when she attempts to initiate sex he rebuffs her and goes upstairs to masturbate alone. The wife has a bath and sadly reminisces about a man named Tom she had met on the same day she met her husband, and wonders what her life would have been like if she had ended up with him instead. The Husband and The Young Thing In 1912, on the Titanic, a wealthy man traveling without his wife convinces an attractive servant to join him for dinner in his cabin. They talk, and the wealthy man begins to awkwardly flirt with the younger man. The younger man goes into the bathroom, when the ship strikes an iceberg and begins to sink. A deck hand warns them to get out, but the husband, seemingly on the verge of a total breakdown at the news, does not tell the young man what is happening and instead seduces him. The young man asks if he can join him when they arrive in New York, but the husband confesses the ship is sinking. The young man is furious and flees, running with all the other panicking passengers, while the husband chooses to die alone in the dark cabin. The Young Thing and The Writer In 1976, a wannabe filmmaker brings his camera into a nightclub where a wild party is ongoing. He spots an attractive younger man dancing and approaches him. The younger man acts coldly at first, until the filmmaker lies and says he is a Hollywood screenwriter working on a major film for Paul Newman, and agrees to go back to his apartment. The two men have passionate sex, and the filmmaker fantasizes about the two falling in love and eventually getting married; in reality, however, the filmmaker admits he lied about his work, causing the younger man to storm out of his apartment. The Writer and The Actress In 2002, a songwriter is helping his ex-girlfriend, a famous actress turned singer attempting to make a comeback in pop music, record a new song. The singer becomes irritated by the saccharine lyrics and the fact that her voice is being heavily auto tuned. The two end up arguing over their old relationship, and the singer admits she is scared she will fail. The writer boosts her confidence by describing how sexy she is, and the two end up having sex in the recording studio. She then asks him to tell her he loves her, and he reminds her that she broke up with him, and admits to sleeping with her current lover. The writer walks out, leaving the singer in angry shock. The Actress and The Politician In 1989, a former actress is working as the adviser and public relations manager to a senator who is running for the presidency. The two women are also in a secret relationship. The actress is irritated that the senator has been drifting away from her and forcing her to keep their romance quiet. However, when the senator implies they may need to break up to further her political career, the actress claims she would be content to be her secret lover forever, and gives her a ring as a gift. The actress throws a successful party to earn voters for the senator, but when she tries to make dinner plans with the senator afterwards, she cuts their conversation short and leaves, much to the actresses disappointment. The Politician and The Whore In 2012, a senator visits a unique whorehouse in which she talks to a masked male prostitute through a two-way camera. The senator asks the prostitute if he is happy doing what he does, but the prostitute refuses to answer, and asks her why she keeps coming to talk to him; she does not answer either. The senator describes a dream she had the previous night in which she woke up in a bed with a stranger - it is revealed to the audience that the dream involved waking up with the male prostitute, without his mask, and having an intimate conversation with him. In real life, the prostitute ends their session, and the senator leaves. She goes to get in her car, but changes her mind and begins walking down the streets of New York City. As she walks, each of the lovers from the various segments appears and sings to her, before the senator sees a man who looks exactly like how the prostitute appeared unmasked in her dream. They smile at each other before he walks away.  Cast   Production  Principal photography on the film began on December 1, 2015 in New York City.

McKenzie, along with long-time friend Kenny Kunene, have become known for using open letters to provoke political debate, cause controversy and attract attention. Kunene left the Economic Freedom Fighters months after its formation before helping to launch the Patriotic Alliance. Kunene was later rumoured to have also left the Patriotic Alliance after the 2014 national elections, but he has strongly denied this.

It refers to a useless relic or structure that has been preserved as part of a building or the built environment, which has become a piece of art in itself. These objects, although having the appearance of pieces of conceptual art, were not created to be viewed as such. Akasegawa deemed them even more art-like than art itself, and named them \\"hyperart.\\" In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Thomasson, especially since the publication of Akasegawa's work on the subject in English in 2010.Akasegawa Genpei, Hyperart: Thomasson, translated by Matt Fargo, Kaya Press, 2010 Origin of the term The term Thomasson comes from the professional baseball player Gary Thomasson, who was signed by the Yomiuri Giants for a record- breaking sum of money, and spent his final two seasons with the team (1981‚Äì1982) coming close to setting the league strikeout record before being benched.Prakash, Gyan and Kevin Michael Kruse, The Spaces of the Modern City: Imaginaries, Politics, and Everyday Life, 2008 p. 397 n25 Akasegawa viewed Thomasson's useless position on the team as a fitting analogy for \\"an object, part of a building, that was maintained in good condition, but with no purpose, to the point of becoming a work of art.\\" Akasegawa Genpei, Ch≈çgeijutsu tomason, Chikuma Shob≈ç, 1987 In Japanese there is no differentiation between singular and plural versions of the noun Tomason, therefore in English too, Thomasson can refer to one or many of these objects. In English, the term is sometimes spelled Tomason, or Thomason. History Akasegawa discovered the first Thomasson in 1972, in Yotsuya, Tokyo when he noticed a staircase that had no entranceway when one reached the top. The handlerail of the staircase, however, showed signs of repair, suggesting it was still being maintained despite the apparent uselessness of the staircase itself. The following year, Akasegawa discovered a boarded up ticket window at Ekoda station on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line. The plywood used to board up the window had been cut neatly to fit the curved stone tray of the ticket window, where it had been worn through years of use. Minami Shind≈ç, a fellow artist and friend of Akasegawa also found a gateway at a hospital in Ochanomizu that had been completely filled up with concrete, whilst the gateway itself was still in good condition. The artists gave these objects names such as \\"The pure staircase of Yotsuya,\\" \\"The useless window of Ekoda\\" and \\"The useless gate of Ochanomizu\\" and referred to them collectively as \\"hyperart\\": their similar characteristics being \\"an object which, just like a piece of art, has no purpose in society, but also, just like a piece of art is preserved with care, to the point where it appears to be on display. However, these objects do not appear to have a creator, making them even more art-like than regular art.\\" Hyperart cannot be created by an artist, but only found and recognized as such by an observer. Those pieces of hyperart that were part of buildings or the built environment were given the name \\"Thomasson.\\" The name was decided upon during a discussion between Akasegawa and his students during his class on \\"Modernology\\" (a concept created by Wajiro Kon). At that time, Gary Thomasson's strikeout record was at 132. The concept of Thomasson was introduced to the general public in 1982, via a series of articles in the magazine Shashin Jidai (Photo Times), published by Byakuya-Shob≈ç. The articles featured findings by Akasegawa's students from his \\"Modernology\\" class as well as photographs of those \\"objects\\" catalogued by Akasegawa himself, and those sent in by readers. The articles created a \\"Thomasson Boom\\" and the concept soon spread. The early Thomasson articles featured in Shashin Jidai were published by Byakuya-Shob≈ç as a book entitled Ch≈çgeijutsu Tomason.Akasegawa Genpei, Chogeijutsu Tomason, Byakuya Shob≈ç, 1985 The complete series of articles was later published as a paperback by Chikuma Shob≈ç in 1987, using the same title. Influence The Thomasson boom after the publication of articles in Shashin Jidai had a big effect on students and young people interested in arts and the avant-garde. The word Thomasson even spread to people who did not understand what it referred to, in a kind of social phenomenon. The cover of Ch≈çgeijutsu Tomason featured a lost neighborhood of Minato-ku in Tokyo, Tani-cho, which vanished due to land redevelopment. Whilst not directly related to Thomasson, the story of Tani embodied its spirit. Its use on the cover of the book had a large effect on the \\"Thomasson Boom.\\" This case also showed the effects of the bubble economy on the city landscape.Jun Tanaka \\"Decaying ‚Äòswamp city‚Äô: the death of Sh≈çwa and Tokyo\\", Japan Forum, 23:2, 2011, 273-285 As historian Jordan Sand notes, cataloguing Thomasson was \\"a way of regaining some sense of the human imprint on the city in an era when that imprint was being rapidly erased.\\" In 1983 the Thomasson Observation Center held an exhibition entitled \\"Cityscape in Anguish\\" at Gallery 612 in Shinjuku, displaying Akasegawa's paintings and photographs of Thomasson by Akasegawa, his students, and those sent in by readers of the magazine. Various tie-in events such as Thomasson bus tours, lectures by Akasegawa, as well as coverage on the Japanese national broadcaster NHK, and the publication, in 1987 of the complete \\"Ch≈çgeijutsu Tomason,\\" were the peak of the Thomasson Boom. Around the same time, other artists and intellectuals were pursuing similar projects. Terunobu Fujimori's work on Architecture Detectives, Hayashi J≈çji's work cataloguing manhole covers, Minami Shinbo's collections of paper stickers, Ichigi Tsutomu's work on architectural fragments and other such collections, led to Chikuma Shob≈ç publishing a book entitled Roj≈ç kansatsugaku ny≈´mon, or \\"Manual on Street Observation\\" in 1986.Akasegawa Genpei, Minami Shinb≈ç, Fujimori Terunobu (Editors) Roj≈ç kansatsugaku ny≈´mon, Chikuma Shob≈ç, 1986 Alongside this, a Street Observation Society event was held to promote their work, along with a press conference.Daniell, Thomas ‚ÄúJust Looking: The Origins of the Street Observation Society‚Äù. AA Files, no. 64, Architectural Association School of Architecture, 2012: 59‚Äì68 Although Street Observation did appear to be something of a boom, it was not the same type of movement that had surrounded the activities of Akasegawa, his students, and their magazine articles. After the arrival of the Street Observation Society, Thomasson disappeared from the public eye for a while, due in part to the fact that the Thomasson Observation Center, run by Akasegawa and his students, overwhelmed by press and public attention, stopped its activities soon after the boom reached its peak. In the years immediately after the Thomasson boom, the concept was referenced in cinema and literature. In the film Patlabor: The Movie (1989) a scene featured the \\"Atom-bomb type\\" Thomasson. William Gibson's 1993 SF novel Virtual Light also makes multiple references to Thomasson.William Gibson, Virtual Light, Bantam, 1993 pp. 70, 72, 136, 352Takayuki Tatsumi, Full Metal Apache: Transactions Between Cyberpunk Japan and Avant-Pop America, Duke University Press, 2006, p. 119 Rediscovery In 2010 the Chikuma Shob≈ç edition of Ch≈çgeijutsu Tomason was translated into English by Matt Fargo and published as Hyperart:Thomasson. In 2012, the Thomasson Observation Center created a Facebook page, and started accepting posts on Thomasson via the internet. The posts were shared widely, and a special form was made available for download to fill out with details of newly discovered Thomasson. A new, internet-era Thomasson movement began. The book and concept have been covered by several English-language media outlets.Citylab Useless and Defunct City Objects Should Be Called...

Types of Thomasson Based on the categories in Chikuma Shob≈ç's \\"Thomasson Illustrated Encyclopedia\\" (Tomason Daizukan „Éà„Éû„ÇΩ„É≥Â§ßÂõ≥Èëë)Akasegawa Genpei, Tomason daizukan: mu no maki, Chikuma Shob≈ç, 1996; Akasegawa Genpei Tomason daizukan: k≈´ no maki,'' Chikuma Shob≈ç, 1996 The Useless Staircase (Japanese: Muy≈ç kaidan ÁÑ°Áî®ÈöéÊÆµ) Also known as a Pure Staircase. A staircase that only goes up and down. Most used to have a door at the top. Some useless staircases exist that were useless right from completion, due to changes or mix-ups in the design. The Useless Doorway Example of a Useless Doorway (Japanese: Muy≈ç mon ÁÑ°Áî®ÈñÄ) Even though it has been blocked up, a Useless Doorway still maintains the majesty of its original purpose. In other cases, a Useless Doorway exists in a place that has no need for it, with no wall or fence around it. The Hisashi (Japanese: Hisashi „Éí„Çµ„Ç∑) Hisashi is the word for \\"eaves\\" in Japanese. This refers to useless eaves: ones that no longer have a window or door underneath them to protect from the rain. The Useless Window (Japanese: Muy≈ç mado, ÁÑ°Áî®Á™ì) A blocked up window: one which is still beautiful due to the care taken in blocking it up. The Nurikabe (Japanese: Nurikabe „Éå„É™„Ç´„Éô) Nurikabe is the word for \\"plaster wall\\" in Japanese. This overlaps with the Useless Doorway and Useless Window categories. It refers to a door or window that was meant to be completely sealed up with concrete, but a difference can still be seen between it and the surrounding area. The A-bomb type Example of an A-bomb Type Thomasson (Japanese: Genbaku taipu ÂéüÁàÜ„Çø„Ç§„Éó) A 2-D Thomasson. The outline of a building that remains in silhouette on a wall. This can be seen when a section of a tightly packed row of buildings is torn down. Cases that appear due to water are known as Hydrogen bombs (Suibaku Ê∞¥ÁàÜ). Cases that appear when a hoarding or sign is torn down are known as Neutron bombs (Ch≈´seishibakudan ‰∏≠ÊÄßÂ≠êÁàÜÂºæ). The Elevated type (Japanese: K≈çsho È´òÊâÄ) These objects are normal themselves, but exist in a higher than normal place, therefore seeming strange. For example, a door with a handle on the second floor of a wall. These often appear when staircases are torn down. They can also appear when a winch or crane is kept inside the building, but a standard door is used on the outside. The Outie (Japanese: Debeso „Åß„Åπ„Åù) A protrudence from a sealed up wall, such as a door knob or tap. The Uyama (Japanese: Uyama „Ç¶„É§„Éû) A sign or hoarding with letters missing. The first example of this was a shop sign which contained the words Uyama, but the rest of the lettering was missing, hence the name. The Castella (Japanese: Kasutera „Ç´„Çπ„ÉÜ„É©) A cuboid protuberance from a wall, named after Castella, a Japanese sponge cake. For example, a blocked up window which sticks out from the wall. The opposite of this, a sunken blocked up section, is known as a Reverse Castella. The Atago (Japanese: Atago „Ç¢„Çø„Ç¥) An object sticking out at the side of the road, with no clear purpose, possibly used to stop cars parking. The first example of this was found by Akasegawa whilst walking from Shinbashi to Atago, hence the name. The Live Burial (Japanese: Ikiume Áîü„ÅçÂüã„ÇÅ) A roadside object which is partly submerged in concrete. The Geological layer (Japanese: Chis≈ç Âú∞Â±§) A patch of ground that is different in height from that around it, usually where multiple construction works have taken place. The Boundary (Japanese: Ky≈çkai Â¢ÉÁïå) A guardrail, fence or wall whose purpose is not immediately clear. The Twist (Japanese: Nejire „Å≠„Åò„Çå) A part of a building which is normally meant to be straight, but is slightly twisted. Often seen when an object that was created to be used straight is used at an angle. The Abe Sada (Japanese: Abe Sada ÈòøÈÉ®ÂÆö) The remains of a telephone pole cut down. The name refers to the Abe Sada Incident; a famous case from 1930s Japan in which a woman strangled her lover and then severed his genitalia with a kitchen knife. The Devouring Tree (Japanese: Monok≈´ki „ÇÇ„ÅÆÂñ∞„ÅÜÊú®) A tree which absorbs part of a fence or wire whilst still growing. However, this is not a particularly rare phenomenon, and occurs quite often. If there is no human involvement then it cannot be called a Thomasson, just a natural phenomenon. This is also known as the Stubborn Nature Type (shizen kohashi taipu Ëá™ÁÑ∂Âº∑„Åó„Çø„Ç§„Éó). The Useless Bridge Example of a Useless Bridge (Japanese: Muy≈ç bashi ÁÑ°Áî®Ê©ã) A bridge over a filled-in river, or a bridge that has become useless. In the case of some covered drains, a bridge is still necessary for cars or heavy vehicles to cross. In this case these could not be called Useless Bridges, as they only appear useless. The Pure type Example of a Pure Tunnel (Japanese: Junsui taipu Á¥îÁ≤ã„Çø„Ç§„Éó) An uncategorizable object whose use it is impossible to fathom. For example, the Pure Shutters, which open to reveal a blank wall, and the Pure Tunnel that exists without a surrounding hill. The Pure Staircase of Yotsuya belongs in this category. Evaporation (Japanese: J≈çhatsu Ëí∏Áô∫) The fading of color on a sign, or a monument with parts missing: an object whose meaning has become hard to work out. Cases often appear due to the long-lasting material of the object. This also often occurs when a sign's key phrases, painted in red for emphasis, disappear, leaving the rest of the sign hard to understand.

The park regularly receives biology and animal psychology students who do field studies of the animals. The students come from universities in Paris, Marseille, Limoges, Poitiers, Bordeaux, Rennes, Tours, Li√®ge and also from the National veterinary school of Alfort. The park supports organizations such as FERUS and loup.org, in protecting the wolves of Europe. International Wolf Center also set up several programmes, helping to protect wolves.  History  The Monts de Gueret animal park was created following a public initiative in 2001 and belongs to the Grand Gueret urban community. The park is located in the central part of Chabri√®res forest, a few miles from the town of Gueret in the department of Creuse, France. The observatory in the park The park complex is built of wood in the style of a Gallic village; some rocks located within the park territory are decorated with wolves images in an ancient Celtic style, reflecting myths and legends of the past, where wolves are presented as beings, strongly connected to the world of the stars, planets and constellations. The observatory built within the Park Circle also emphasizes this idea. European grey wolves historically populated the forests of Creuse, but the last one died in 1937. Now wolves inhabit the Chabri√®res forest again: 23 European grey wolves live in semi-freedom inside two forested enclosures covering a combined area of . During the last years, the park extended the variety of wolves types, and smaller packs of ice white Mackenzie wolves, black Mackenzie wolves and white arctic wolves have been added to the population of the European grey wolves, the type most represented in the park. 2015 marked a new era for the animal park: new wolf packs of different types started to arrive, as well as new species of different animals, all of which will join the deers, roe deers, wild boars, badgers and foxes already living there. Since it was opened in 2001 and up to the summer of 2015, the park has been visited by over half a million visitors. In 2014, the number of visitors was 42,000, and it is estimated that the number will increase by 15% in 2015. In 2013, one of the male grey wolves managed to escape from the park through a fence that had been cut open.  Wolves  Image of a wolf in ancient Celtic style European grey wolves, ice white Mackenzie wolves, black Mackenzie wolves and white arctic wolves, are all living separately in the different parts of the park and can not interact physically. The wolves' habitat in the park is designed to let the predators' wild lifestyle be as close to natural as possible, but only the pack of European grey wolves have the privilege to live and hunt within the two areas of forested land with their lake. In 2013, two white arctic wolf cubs were born for the first time in the park. During the daily feeding in Chabri√®res Park, the European grey wolves fight for relatively small pieces of meat, which employees of the wolf park throw from the public observation deck as a spectacle for viewers and a welcome snack for the wolves. The real hunt, cruel but natural for predators, begins when the audience leaves and the pack hunts for prey under the leadership of the alpha wolf, the male or female with the highest rank in the pack. The documentary film Lobo, wolf of Chabri√®res, created at the request of the wolf park, tells the story of the life of Lobo the cub (as a rule, in the wild only the highest rank pair, the alpha wolves, can produce pups). Born in Chabri√®res and growing up in his pack of European grey wolves, a community that lives according to the natural laws of their species, the film displays the various behaviours of each individual wolf and the complex relationships based on their status in the pack. The ten-minute- long film presents Lobo's life from birth and adolescence, full of games of learning, to the time when he, a strong adult, gains the status of alpha wolf by his ingenuity, strength and courage during the hunts.  Museum  Inside the museum A museum in the Chabri√®res park is the House of the Wolf. It covers and exhibits a wealth of information about wolves; from the tales, myths and legends, to scientific materials, related to all aspects of the wolves' life and the human/wolf relationships. Also highlighted in the museum exhibition are the history of destruction of wolves' habitats and the recent positive changes, leading to the movement of protection of the wolves around the world, institutionalized by an international agreement which took place in Washington and Bern. The latest works of scientists, studying wolves' physiology and psychology, including vocal behaviours, are also well represented in the museum.  Wolves' songs  The Wolves of Chabri√®res park organizes field studies of wolves' vocal behaviour, where college students and the public can listen the songs of wolves during night walks in the forest. Vocal communication is one of many ways, that wolves use to indicate their mood and intentions, and consists of barks, whines, growls and howls, which can be solo, or chorus where two or more wolves are involved. The wolf pack howls on average for 85 seconds. It is usually started by a single wolf, after which other wolves may join in. The pack leader, the alpha wolf, usually uses a lower-pitched howl and howls more frequently than wolves standing on the lower rungs of the pack's hierarchy. Although some functions of the howling are still unknown by scientists, they believe that wolves may howl to scare off other wolf packs from their territory and to gather their own pack, as wolves possess perfect hearing and their howling can be heard for up to in the forest and in open space. Researchers have found a relationship between the number of times a wolf howls and the strength of their relationship with other pack members. According to Friederike Range, co-director of the University of Vienna's Wolf Science Center, \\"the strength of the relationship between wolves predicted how many times a wolf howled.\\" According to the wolf-watching group Alliance avec les loups, the howling of wolves, a species that is quickly spreading through the whole of France, could possibly become a common sound even in the countryside around Paris, as Telegraph newspaper claims. thumb|220px|Wolf park map.

Since 2009, the program has provided classes to more than 220 incarcerated people, primarily at Danville Correctional Center.  Funding  The three sources of funds for the project are the University of Illinois, grants, and private donations. Approximately 25% of the donations they receive are from private donations. The estimated value of donated time on the part of faculty, graduate students, staff, and community members amounted to more than $200,000. Professors and grad students are not paid for teaching in the program - the program is volunteer-based. In 2017, the project received a $1 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The funding will go toward developing a men's college-in-prison program at Danville Correctional Facility, along with further course offerings at a nearby women's prison, a new speaker's series, and an effort to improve the evaluation process of the program.  Impact  As of 2019, more than 220 people have taken classes through the program, including an estimated 5 students now in grad school.  Criticisms  One of the main criticisms of the program is that although students can earn credits that are transferable to a full degree program at a college or university, the program does not directly enable participants to earn a bachelor's degree.

Normally, such a dependence is assumed to be absent for simplicity, however spatial dispersion exists to varying degrees in all materials. Spatial dispersion can be compared to temporal dispersion, the latter often just called dispersion. Temporal dispersion represents memory effects in systems, commonly seen in optics and electronics. Spatial dispersion on the other hand represents spreading effects and is usually significant only at microscopic length scales. Spatial dispersion contributes relatively small perturbations to optics, giving weak effects such as optical activity. Spatial dispersion and temporal dispersion may occur in the same system.  Origin: nonlocal response  The origin of spatial dispersion is nonlocal response, where response to a force field appears at many locations, and can appear even in locations where the force is zero. This usually arises due to a spreading of effects by the hidden microscopic degrees of freedom. As an example, consider the current J(x,t) that is driven in response to an electric field E(x,t), which is varying in space (x) and time (t). Simplified laws such as Ohm's law would say that these are directly proportional to each other, J = \\\\sigma E, but this breaks down if the system has memory (temporal dispersion) or spreading (spatial dispersion). The most general linear response is given by: :J(x,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{-\\\\infty} dx' \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{-\\\\infty} dt'\\\\, \\\\sigma(x, x', t, t') E(x', t'), where \\\\sigma(x, x', t, t')dx'\\\\,dt' is the nonlocal conductivity function. If the system is invariant in time (time translation symmetry) and invariant in space (space translation symmetry), then we can simplify because \\\\sigma(x, x', t, t') = \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm sym}(x-x', t-t') for some convolution kernel \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm sym}. We can also consider plane wave solutions for E and J like so: :J(x,t) = \\\\operatorname{Re}(J_0 e^{i k x - i \\\\omega t}) :E(x,t) = \\\\operatorname{Re}(E_0 e^{i k x - i \\\\omega t}) which yields a remarkably simple relationship between the two plane waves' complex amplitudes: :J_0 = \\\\tilde\\\\sigma(k,\\\\omega) E_0. where the function \\\\tilde\\\\sigma(k,\\\\omega) is given by a Fourier transform of the space-time response function: :\\\\tilde\\\\sigma(k,\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{-\\\\infty} dx \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{-\\\\infty} dt \\\\, e^{-i k x + i \\\\omega t} \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm sym}(x, t). The conductivity function \\\\tilde\\\\sigma(k,\\\\omega) has spatial dispersion if it is dependent on the wavevector k. This occurs if the spatial function \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm sym}(x-x', t-t') is not pointlike (delta function) response in x-x' .  Spatial dispersion in electromagnetism  In electromagnetism, spatial dispersion plays a role in a few material effects such as optical activity and doppler broadening. Spatial dispersion also plays an important role in the understanding of electromagnetic metamaterials. Most commonly, the spatial dispersion in permittivity Œµ is of interest.  Crystal optics  Inside crystals there may be a combination of spatial dispersion, temporal dispersion, and anisotropy.Agranovich & Ginzburg . Crystal Optics with Spatial Dispersion, and Excitons [2 ed.]. 978-3-662-02408-9, 978-3-662-02406-5 The constitutive relation for the polarization vector can be written as: : P_i(\\\\vec k,\\\\omega) = \\\\sum_j (\\\\epsilon_{ij}(\\\\vec k, \\\\omega) - \\\\epsilon_0\\\\delta_{ij}) E_j(\\\\vec k, \\\\omega), i.e., the permittivity is a wavevector- and frequency-dependent tensor. Considering Maxwell's equations, one can find the plane wave normal modes inside such crystals. These occur when the following relationship is satisfied for a nonzero electric field vector \\\\vec E: : \\\\omega^2 \\\\mu_0 \\\\epsilon(\\\\vec k, \\\\omega)\\\\vec E - (\\\\vec k \\\\cdot \\\\vec k) \\\\vec E + (\\\\vec k \\\\cdot \\\\vec E) \\\\vec k = 0 . Spatial dispersion in \\\\epsilon(\\\\vec k, \\\\omega) can lead to strange phenomena, such as the existence of multiple modes at the same frequency and wavevector direction, but with different wavevector magnitudes. Nearby crystal surfaces and boundaries, it is no longer valid to describe system response in terms of wavevectors. For a full description it is necessary to return to a full nonlocal response function (without translational symmetry), however the end effect can sometimes be described by \\"additional boundary conditions\\" (ABC's).  In isotropic media  In materials that have no relevant crystalline structure, spatial dispersion can be important. Although symmetry demands that the permittivity is isotropic for zero wavevector, this restriction does not apply for nonzero wavevector. The non-isotropic permittivity for nonzero wavevector leads to effects such as optical activity in solutions of chiral molecules. In isotropic materials without optical activity, the permittivity tensor can be broken down to transverse and longitudinal components, referring to the response to electric fields either perpendicular or parallel to the wavevector. For frequencies nearby an absorption line (e.g., an exciton), spatial dispersion can play an important role.  Landau damping  In plasma physics, a wave can be collisionlessly damped by particles in the plasma whose velocity matches the wave's phase velocity. This is typically represented as a spatially dispersive loss in the plasma's permittivity.  Permittivity‚Äìpermeability ambiguity at nonzero frequency  At nonzero frequencies, it is possible to represent all magnetizations as time-varying polarizations. Moreover, since the electric and magnetic fields are directly related by abla \\\\times E = -\\\\partial B/\\\\partial t, the magnetization induced by a magnetic field can be represented instead as a polarization induced by the electric field, though with a highly dispersive relationship. What this means is that at nonzero frequency, any contribution to permeability Œº can instead be alternatively represented by a spatially dispersive contribution to permittivity Œµ. The values of the permeability and permittivity are different in this alternative representation, however this leads to no observable differences in real quantities such as electric field, magnetic flux density, magnetic moments, and current. As a result, it is most common at optical frequencies to set Œº to the vacuum permeability Œº0 and only consider a dispersive permittivity Œµ. There is some discussion over whether this is appropriate in metamaterials where effective medium approximations for Œº are used, and debate over the reality of \\"negative permeability\\" seen in negative index metamaterials.  Spatial dispersion in acoustics  In acoustics, especially in solids, spatial dispersion can be significant for wavelengths comparable to the lattice spacing, which typically occurs at very high frequencies (gigahertz and above). In solids, the difference in propagation for transverse acoustic modes and longitudinal acoustic modes of sound is due to a spatial dispersion in the elasticity tensor which relates stress and strain. For polar vibrations (optical phonons), the distinction between longitudinal and transverse modes can be seen as a spatial dispersion in the restoring forces, from the \\"hidden\\" non-mechanical degree of freedom that is the electromagnetic field. Many electromagnetic wave effects from spatial dispersion find an analogue in acoustic waves. For example, there is acoustical activity ‚Äî the rotation of the polarization plane of transverse sound waves ‚Äî in chiral materials, analogous to optical activity.

He was born in Nantes on 4 April 1864 and died in Croisic on 19 September 1930. Biography As a young boy, du Puigaudeau was close to his uncle Henri de Chateaubriant, who encouraged his artistic pursuits. His education was traditional and he studied at various boarding schools from Paris to Nice. In 1882, du Puigaudeau travelled to Italy, then to Tunisia, and taught himself to paint. The first work which can be safely attributed to du Puigaudeau was dated 1886, the year he visited Pont-Aven where he befriended Charles Laval and Paul Gauguin with whom he decided to travel to Panama and Martinique, but was unable to do so as he was called up for military service In 1890, he presented one of his works at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux Arts at a time when his father had introduced him to the dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. He got married on 7 August 1893 in Saint-Nazaire, and had one daughter, the traveler and ethnographer Odette du Puigaudeau. In 1895 he settled down in Pont-Aven for three years. After falling out with Durand-Ruel in 1903, he visited Venice in 1904 where he produced many canvases but subsequently returned to Batz-sur-Mer with serious financial problems. 1907 saw him move into the manor house of Kervaudu in Le Croisic which had been loaned to him by friends. The World War I isolated him from the rest of the world. Degas himself called him \\"the hermit of Kervaudu\\" due to his secluded and solitary existence. In 1919 he began to prepare an exhibition in New York, and worked on it for four years, but it was cancelled at the last minute. This failure had dire repercussions for him and he fell into a state of depression and alcohol abuse. He died on 19 September 1930. Du Puigaudeau's paintings depicting scenes in Brittany He painted many Breton scenes and was fascinated with the tradition of the pardon with its processions and rituals, as indeed were many artists over the years. He also favoured painting studies of Breton women. Some paintings are shown below and his fascination with the effects of light are evident in his use of flickering candlelight.

It was exclusively released in the United Kingdom for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in 1987. It is the eleventh instalment of the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during the 1941 Siege of Tobruk of the Western Desert Campaign in World War II and revolves around the Allied forces attempts to overthrow German field marshal Erwin Rommel from the city. The game is a turn-based strategy which focuses mainly on tank combat and contains elements of arcade gameplay. In the game, the player controls the Axis powers and must capture and hold various Allied bases in both Italian Libya and British Egypt, with the city of Tobruk being the ultimate goal. The game received mixed reviews upon release; critics were divided over the gameplay and were largely negative over its interface and tank mechanics. Gameplay A map showing the combat and minefields in Cyrenaica, Italian Libya. The game is a top-down turn-based strategy which contains elements of arcade gameplay and focuses mainly on tank combat. It is a simulation of the 1941 Siege of Tobruk, a part of the Western Desert Campaign of World War II. The battle revolves around Australian and British (collectively referred to Allied forces) attempts to oust German field marshal Erwin Rommel from the city. If playing alone, the player controls the Axis powers and is not able to play on the side of the Allies unless a second player is involved. The main objective of the game is to capture and hold as many fortifications in Italian Libya as possible, with the city of Tobruk and the defence of Rommel being the ultimate goals. The main display map of the game is focused on Cyrenaica, a representation of the Allied minefield that was laid in the Gazala Line between Gazala and Bir Hachieim. The Axis troops begin the game on the western side of the line, whilst Allied forces begin the offensive in British Egypt. A command box in the game provides the player with an instant report of a unit or landscape once hovered over; data given on units includes their strength in terms of supply of infantry, provisions, artillery, and the number of moves that unit can make on one turn. Every two turns lasts one in-game day and units are available to enter combat phases once a day is finished. In a combat phase, the game shifts to an \\"arcade sequence\\", which allows the player to control a tank in the Sahara Desert. The arcade sequence presents a menu of tank functions; a gun turret, shell loading, firing and navigational buttons. Only one function can be used at a time; in order to drive the tank, the player has to use the navigational buttons to manoeuvre. If the tank becomes under attack, the gun turret or shell-firing mode must be activated for self- defence. Both the arcade sequence and tank controlling is optional, however, and is not required to finish the game. Background Personal Software Services was founded in Coventry, England, by Gary Mays and Richard Cockayne in 1981. The company were known for creating games that revolved around historic war battles and conflicts, such as Theatre Europe, Iwo Jima and Falklands '82. The company had a partnership with French video game developer ERE Informatique, and published localised versions of their products to the United Kingdom. In 1986, Cockayne took a decision to alter their products for release on 16-bit consoles, as he found that smaller 8-bit consoles such as the ZX Spectrum lacked the processing power for larger strategy games. The decision was falsely interpreted as \\"pull-out\\" from the Spectrum market by a video game journalist. Following years of successful sales throughout the mid 1980s, Personal Software Services experienced financial difficulties, during a period where Cockayne later admitted that he \\"took his eye off the ball\\". The company was acquired by Mirrorsoft in February 1987, and was later dispossessed by the company due to strains of debt. Reception The game received mixed reviews upon release. Richard Blaine of Your Sinclair praised the game's playability and value for money, stating that it provides an \\"interesting challenge\\". Philippa Irving of Crash, however, criticised the playability and tank mechanics as \\"stunningly badly designed\\" and \\"unplayable\\", whilst also stating that it was \\"rather unatmospheric\\". Gary Rook of Sinclair User summarised that Tobruk was \\"pretty disappointing\\" and \\"nowhere near as successful\\" as its direct predecessor, Bismarck. Rook criticised the interface of the game as \\"clumsily\\" executed and not \\"half as good\\" as that of other strategy games at the time of release. Regarding the arcade sequences of the game, Michael Sandford of ZX Computing recommended any player to avoid them, as its difficulty would affect gameplay. However, Sandford praised the overall experience of the game, stating that it was \\"one of the best\\" wargames and endorsed it to anybody interested in the genre. Mark Reed of Computer Gamer asserted that Tobruk was \\"undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable wargames ever\\" and heralded its originality and playability. Irving, however, criticised its authenticity; stating that the game was lacking in both \\"elusive quality\\" and atmosphere. Rook found that the developers' intention of attempting to \\"marry strategy gaming with arcade gaming\\" was unsuccessful and produced negative results. A 1993 Computer Gaming World survey of wargames agreed while giving the game one-plus stars out of five, stating that \\"the simulation and arcade aspects denigrate each other's appeal\\".

The C19 replaces the longer and heavier Lee-Enfield No. 4 rifles in service since 1947. The rifles are mainly used for self-defence against large North American carnivores like polar bears, and for personal survival as regional surveillance missions are often conducted for extended periods in remote areas, requiring the Rangers to hunt for food. Further the rifles are expected to operate in temperatures ranging from with moderate to high humidity and be resistant to corrosion from long- term exposure to salt laden air and water. According to SAKO, production commenced in mid-2016, with rifle trials into 2017 and the full complement are expected to be delivered by the end of 2019. Design details The C19 has the following modifications from the original Tikka T3 CTR:NEW CANADIAN RANGER RIFLE Press Release: Colt Canada Corporation 2015‚Äê06‚Äê23 * Larger bolt handle and enlarged trigger guard to accommodate gloved hands * Protected front and rear iron sights * Laminated stock in unique red colour with Ranger badge * Two-stage trigger with three-position safety The receiver top has a NATO Accessory Rail for mounting accessories like aiming elements or optics. The free-floating, hammer-forged threaded barrel and other critical components are made of stainless steel. The buttstock is manufactured from plywood laminates. Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns, do not require lengthy maturing, and are cheaper. Further the buttstock can be lengthened by adding spacers. The Colt C19 is equipped with iron sights that consist of a rear sight element mounted on the rear receiver containing a rotary drum protected by sturdy \\"ears\\" and a semi-hooded front post. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for elevation, and features six apertures calibrated for in increments. The C19 is capable of chambering not only in-service 7.62√ó51mm NATO ammunition such as the Ball C21 cartridge, but also commercially available .308 Winchester ammunition like the Nosler Accubond hunting ammunition issued to the Canadian Rangers, simplifying the Canadian Armed Forces' supply chain. The C19 rifle is being supplied with a soft transport case, Pelican hard transport case, cleaning kit, sling, and trigger lock.

It was written by Ron Fair, Randy Bugnitz, and M√Ωa and recorded for the 2003 James Bond third-person shooter video game James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing, released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Nintendo GameCube consoles. Published by Electronic Arts, the game features the likeness and voice from M√Ωa who portrays the character M√Ωa Starling, an NSA double agent who aids Bond in dealing with the use of nanotechnology as terrorism. \\"Everything or Nothing\\" was released as a promotional single in support of the game's official release. A jazz version, also produced by Fair, was performed by M√Ωa on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in late 2004. Background In 2001, video game developer Electronic Arts approached M√Ωa to get involved in EA's James Bond franchise. While she expected to get relegated to composing the theme song to the game or providing background music, EA envisioned M√Ωa's role as being broader than that when they asked her to star as a central character named M√Ωa Starling, an NSA agent posing as a jazz singer opposite former James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan. The title of the song and game are based on EON Productions, the production company behind all of the James Bond films. Writing and recording \\"Everything or Nothing\\" was written by M√Ωa, Randy Bugnitz and frequent collaborator Ron Fair, while production was overseen by the latter. Mixing of the track was provided by Ben Grosse. EA requested the singer to record a song which would also work in a jazz club as \\"Everything or Nothing\\" was expected to be featured in a similar environment in a video game sequence. Commenting on the result, M√Ωa said: \\"It fit together. It's not like Mya, recording artist, separate and apart from [the game]. It's actually a song that the agent sings within the game. So I get to be myself a little as well as play a character and sing as the character.\\" The first jazz song she ever wrote, M√Ωa considered writing a Bond theme an opportunity to be a writer \\"outside of M√Ωa\\" as she felt the track marked a breakaway from the concrete and solid coming from a personal experience that she had frequently used on previous records. \\"'Everything Or Nothing' can mean so many things and the definition and links can be infinite\\", she said. \\"So in the lyric writing process there was everything from the analogy between cars and keys versus just relationships or some of the top R&B; clich√©s, you know, when I'm writing my own songs.\\" Fair produced three different versions of \\"Everything or Nothing\\", including the synthesizer‚Äìdriven main version, a jazz edition and a techno remix. While familiar with the classic Bond songs such as Shirley Bassey's \\"Goldfinger\\", Paul McCartney's \\"Live and Let Die\\" and Carly Simon's \\"Nobody Does It Better\\", M√Ωa did not immerse herself with the songs that were accompanying the Bond films, though she researched for the techno version of \\"Everything or Nothing\\", the first version she wrote the lyrics to. Unfamiliar with that genre, she took to rave and house music, as well as techno and pop music and invited friends to play music for her. For the jazz rendition, Fair brought in live musician and modified the melody and rhythms of the song.

The two summits rise in the middle of the east-west oriented Kellerwandgrat, an ar√™te that forms the main chain of the Carnic Alps here. The border between the Austrian state of Carinthia and the Italian Province of Udine runs along this ridge. The West Top (Westgipfel), also called the Grohmannspitze, is 2,718 m; the East or Main Top (Ostgipfel or Hauptgipfel) is 2,774 m. The mountain offers a wide panoramic view in all directions which, along with its numerous climbing routes, makes it a popular destination for mountaineers.  History  Since the 1860s there were different views among Austrian, German and Italian alpinists as to whether the Kellerspitzen or the Hohe Warte (Monte Coglians) was the highest mountain in the Carnic Alps. Paul Grohmann, the geologist and palaeontologist Fritz Frech from Breslau and Georg Geyer from Vienna claimed the Kellerspitzen, shown on the Austrian map with a height of 2,813 metres, was the highest summit; the Italians Giovanni Marinelli and Arturo Ferrucci from the Italian Alpine Club, by contrast, favoured the Hohe Warte, which was marked on the Tavolette 1:50,000, Prato Carnico map with a height of 2,782.Giovanni Marinelli: Bolletino Club Alpino Italiano, Vol. XXII, Milan, 1888, pp. 157 f. Today it is believed that the Hohe Warte, at 2,780 metres, is the highest mountain in the region, beating the Kellerspitzen by around 6 metres. According to German language literature the Kellerspitzen West Top was climbed on 15 July 1868 by Paul Grohmann, guided by Josef Moser from K√∂tschach and Peter Salcher from Luggau in the Lesach valley. They set off on 14 July from the Pl√∂cken Pass, climbed up to the Obere Collinalpe and bivouacked at a height of about 2,000 metres to the north of and below the Gr√ºne Schneide. Their route continued through the Eiskar to the summit ridge. The group only reached the lower West Top, however, a breaking storm prevented their crossing to the East Top.Paul Grohmann: Zeitschrift des Deutschen Alpenvereins, Vol. I, Munich, 1869/70, pp. 51 ff. On 31 July 1877 L. Pitacco, Pietro Galante and A. Menchini failed at the Kollinkofel. Not until 13 July 1878 did Giovanni Hocke of the Societ√† Alpina Friulana (today the Udine Branch of the IAC), together with Adam Riebler, a master locksmith and mountain guide from Mauthen, succeed in conquering the East Top, which they reached via the Kollinkofel. They returned the same way. The crossing from the East to the West Top was first achieved on 29 August by the aristocratic brothers, Guido and Cesare Mantica, with their guide, Nicol√≤ Silverio from Timau. They also initially climbed the Kollinkofel. On the West Top they found Grohmann's visiting card under a cairn. On the descent they followed Grohmann's route down to the Eiskar. Thereafter the mountains on the Kellerwandgrat were visited time and again.Giovanni Hocke: Il Kellerwand o Kellerspitz, Giornale di Udine, 27 July 1878 In the mountain war of 1915‚Äì1918 the static front between Austria and Italy ran through here. The region still has numerous remains of military positions and trenches; the old supply route between the peaks of the Kellerspitzen makes a crossing easy for today's visitors.  Geography  The Kellerspitzen have only a few immediately important neighbours. To the west, along the Kellerwandgrat ar√™te and separated by the Kellerscharte col at 2,524 m, are the 2,713-metre-high Kellerwarte (Cima di Mezzo), then the Hohe Warte, at 2,780 metres the highest mountain of the Carnic Alps, and to the east lies the Kollinkofel (Creta di Collina). To the north, towards the Valentin valley, the twin peaks drop almost vertically in an 800-metre-high rock face. The south face drops about 500 metres to the Keller (La Chiavenate), a bowl-shaped gravel cirque. The nearest significant settlements are, on the Italian side, Timau in the Val Grande, which lies about 9 kilometres away to the east as the crow flies and K√∂tschach-Mauthen, 10 kilometres to the northeast. The Pl√∂cken Pass Road runs by about 3.5 kilometres to the east.

History This is one of the Railway stations that connects North Chhatishgarh with Raipur. The Railway Ministry plans to build a new km line between Ambikapur (Chhattisgarh) and Barwadih (Jharkhand). The proposed line will reduce the distance between Mumbai and Howrah via Jabalpur by about . Britishers were the first to moot the proposal way back in 1925 to connect Ambikapur and Barwadih, both coal- rich areas, by rail. The plan was aimed to facilitate the transportation of minerals. The Britishers knew the importance of the rail line and the work on the project was started in the early 1930s after conducting the survey, sources added. The required land for the project was also acquired. But the work was stopped during World War II and the project had been pending since then, sources said. The new rail line will give connectivity from Howrah, Dhanbad & Ranchi to Mumbai via Lohardaga, Barkakana, Latehar, Barwadih, Ambikapur, Katni, Jabalpur & Itarsi. It would help reducing the rail distance between the two Metros. At present, both the Metros are connected by two different rail routes one via Nagpur & Bilaspur and another via Itarsi & Jabalpur. The distance between Howrah and Mumbai via Jabalpur is km while the same via Nagpur comes to be around . The railway runs maximum trains between both the Metros via Nagpur-Bilaspur section. Besides a daily Kolkata mail, a couple of weekly trains chug on Jabalpur-Itarsi section. Sources said that the new new Barwadih-Ambikapur line would change the rail map route between Howrah and Mumbai. If the new line starts, it will reduce the distance between both the Metros by more than , thus making it shortest route between Mumbai and Howrah by curtailing travel time by at least 6 hours 15 mins, sources added.

It also made a multi-language version musical Lieutenant, Were You Once a Hussar? (1930). In 1934 the company was forcibly disbanded and its assets taken over during the Aryanization programme of the Nazi Party which confiscated businesses from Jewish ownership. This was also part of a wider move which led to production being concentrated in the hands of four major studios Bavaria, Tobis, Terra and UFA.

It can be prepared as a cream- or broth-style soup. Additional vegetables, root vegetables and various other ingredients can be used in its preparation. It may be served hot or cold, and several recipes exist. Carrot soup has been described as a \\"classic\\" dish in French cuisine. The soup was eaten by King Edward VII every year on 26 August to commemorate the 1346 Battle of Cr√©cy. Overview Carrot soup can be prepared as a cream- style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock can be used as ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using pur√©ed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in pur√©ed versions of the dish. Those prepared with pur√©ed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality. Several ingredient variations exist in carrot soup preparations. Some carrot soups are prepared using coconut milk, coconut water, coconut cream, coconut butter or coconut pieces. Some versions include ginger as an ingredient, and some include curry. Green carrot leaves (greens) from the top of carrots can be used as an ingredient in the dish. Chopped mint leaves are used in some versions. It can be served hot or chilled. Salt and pepper can be used to season the dish, and nutmeg is sometimes used as a seasoning. It is sometimes topped with yoghurt, a yoghurt sauce, cr√®me fra√Æche, sour cream, and other ingredients. In the United Kingdom, a distinct soup variety much more popular than plain carrot soup is carrot and coriander soup, made with coarsely chopped or grated carrot, garlic and coriander (cilantro) seeds. The zest of orange can be used as a garnish, as an ingredient within the dish itself, and in both ways. Additional garnishes can include dill, carrot leaves, grated, minced or diced carrot, chives, other fresh, chopped herbs, croutons, and toast squares, among others. Carrot soup can be prepared as a vegan food, and can also be prepared as a bisque. Carrot soup may contain a significant amount of nitrite.

Potage is a variety of soups that have a thick consistency. Potage Cr√©cy is named after Cr√©cy-en-Ponthieu, a commune in Northern France that has been purported to produce carrots with the best flavor within the country. In French cuisine, Cr√©cy soup is typically prepared with rice, which can also be served as a side dish. Rice may be used as an ingredient to thicken the dish, and barley has also been used. History Although the modern sweet orange carrot was not developed until the 16th century, in the Low Countries, it has been represented as a tradition, and it was once customary for English people to eat Cr√©cy soup annually on 26 August in commemoration of the anniversary of the Battle of Cr√©cy, which occurred in Cr√©cy, France on that date in 1346. Cr√©cy soup was eaten annually by King Edward VII, King of the United Kingdom between 1901 and 1910, on the battle's anniversary day, in honour of his ancestor, Edward, the Black Prince, who led the battle. It has also been suggested that the soup was served to triumphant English soldiers after the battle concluded, using carrots from Cr√©cy.

Description The island has an area of , is located from the mainland, at the southern end of Jurien Bay, and has a maximum elevation of . The island is part of the Turquoise Coast islands nature reserve group, a chain of 40 islands spread over a distance of . Lighthouse A lighthouse was constructed in the centre of the island in 1930. Initially the lighthouse had a brightness of 6000 candlepower and was visible for . The light was a group flashing white light model, showing three flashes every fifteen seconds. Originally powered by butane gas, it was converted to solar power in 1986; it now consists of a solar powered unmanned light on top of a steel tower. Geology The islands were formed approximately 10,000 years ago after large fluctuations in sea levels caused erosion on large areas of the continental shelf during periods of glaciation. Large parallel sand dunes then formed and hardened into limestone, forming islands, most of which have been separated from the mainland for 6,500 years. Well preserved Tamala limestone geological features can be found on the islands, including the fragile fossil root networks known as rhizoliths that are found on Escape Island. Fauna The Jurien Bay skink is found on the island, inhabiting the crevices in the limestone rocks. The bull skink is also found but lives in shallow burrows in the sandy soil.

He was a pen pal of Gluck, Pietro Metastasio, Voltaire, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Catherine the Great, and Frederick William II of Prussia, to whom he dedicated a book of French verses translated from Italian, \\"L'Alcoran des Princes Destin√©s au Trone\\". Giacomo Casanova mentions Stefano Zannovich, who \\"paid a visit to Vienna under the alias of Prince Castriotto d'Albanie. Under pressure of the authorities, he left at the end of July 1784\\" for Poland and later for the Netherlands (United Provinces). Early life He was born to the Pa≈°troviƒái clan near Budva, Venetian Albania (now Montenegro), and committed suicide in an Amsterdam jail. He was the fourth child of Antun \\"Budaljanin\\", a wealthy merchant and shoemaker, and his wife Franka (n√©e Markoviƒá). He had older brothers named Marko (b. 1745), Primislav (b. 1747) and his namesake Stjepan (b. 1749) who died at an early age. After him, his parents had Vincislav (b. 1755) and Miroslav (1761-1834), and two daughters, Marija Jelisaveta (b. 1753) and Teresia Giustiniana (b. 1758).http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20020928/feljton01.asp Large number of siblings allowed them to constantly change identities, falsely impersonating one another, often making confusion by allegedly appearing in two places at the same time. His oldest brother Marko went to Russia in 1781 and became a count, living in ≈†k≈Ço≈≠ on the estate of Semyon Zorich. In 1783 he was arrested alongside his brother Anibal, for covering his brother's money counterfeiting operation. Mentioned Anibal is not the same person as Stjepan, more likely Primislav who used the same alias. They were imprisoned in Siberia until 1788 when they were pardoned by Catherine due to Zorich's intervention and because of Stjepan's fame in western Europe, where he always glorified Russian empress. Upon release they left for Arhangelsk, not to be mentioned again. His youngest brother Miroslav also adopted the title of count, enrolled in politics as a staunch opponent of Venetian aspirations towards Dalmatia and a freemason. He was a delegate of Budva on the unification assembly of Montenegro and Boka in 1813. He also published the book Thoughts and sonnets and died at a very old age in 1834. Of all his relatives, Stjepan, alongside Primislav who was often his partner in con schemes, is perhaps the best known. Stjepan claimed descendance from Skanderbeg. Stefan completed his education in Venice and Padua. He met Casanova through his brother Primislav in Florence, where he was part of the Accademia degli Apatisti, better known as the Accademia Fiorentina. In Florence he made his first moves by bankrupting certain English lord in the game of cards, for which he was expelled from Florence. In 1769 both he and his brother were expelled from Venice, as well as from Treviso the following year for document forgery and false representation. Somewhere after 1772 he undertook a trip to London in order to collect his card winnings. During this voyage he visited much of the France, including Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, Lyon and eventually Paris, where he was moving in social circles around Encyclop√©distes, thus meeting d'Alembert, Marmontel and Rousseau. His first works Opera diverse and Poesie were printed in 1773 in Paris and Milan respectively.http://www.butua.com/knjizevnost/2010/stjepan_zanovic_m_pantic.html Biography Zannowich's life is full of controversy, scarce on facts and full of fictional events that were the most likely product of his own imagination. Various fragments were recorded by his acquaintances. Apparently, at the age of 17, after a robbery he committed, he escaped to Dalmatia and became a brigand leader. Later he came to Montenegro, where, by his own account, he presented himself as Russian tsar Peter III and became the head of the country. Zannowich did, in fact, visit Montenegro on 5 May 1774 with unclear motifs. Obviously seeking to profit from the power vacuum after the death of Stephen the Little, the actual impostor of Peter III, he later took over his identity and presented himself across Europe as the man who caused such political intrigue. It is widely regarded as true that he actually met Stephen, even writing a couple of words about him in 1784, in which he made a clear distinction between the two of them. He mentioned himself in the passage as being one of Stephen's generals in the latter's battles against the Turks. After the supposed meeting he left Montenegro for the first time in 1769 for Vienna only to return five years later. While in Vienna he tried to gain support from local Orthodox deacons for his plan to seize the power in Montenegro, and it is at this point that he started his quest on proving his own noble heritage, alleged connection with Skenderbeg, etc. He claimed that the people of Montenegro as well as Prince-bishop Sava were asking him to take over the country, but that his adventurous spirit was longing for something more. In reality, he was expelled by Montenegrins who wanted to avoid being clutched by yet another impostor. So, he left the country for the second time and accompanied by archimandrite Petar I, who would later become metropolitan himself, and a group of Montenegrins he reached Vienna through Rijeka. Once in Vienna he split with his traveling group and via Strasbourg and Frankfurt he left for Poland. There he took an alias Niarta and became the prot√©g√© of the prince Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Ogi≈Ñski, whom he exploited financially. In 1775 he went to Dresden where his Opere Postume and Lettere turche were printed, then moving to Berlin the following year. There he failed to gain the trust of Frederick the Great, who immediately saw right through him, but in turn grew increasingly close with his heir Frederick William II. Johann Christian von Mannlich recounts how well he was received in Zweibr√ºcken in 1778, only to be arrested and his residence permit denied after an incriminating letter against him arrived from Berlin. Spending some time under various false identities in Alsace and Lorraine, he arrived in Rome where, despite an age difference, he started an affair with Duchess of Kingston. The pair then left for Russia. In 1780 he was in Groningen, moving to Amsterdam and eventually ending in Antwerpen. There he befriended Charles-Joseph de Ligne, who dedicated a poem to Stefan, and spent six months enjoying his hospitality at Ch√¢teau de Bel≈ìil. During his stay in Belgium, clearly not eager to abandon his political ambitions involving Montenegro, he devised a plan to place the country under the protection of Joseph II, whose intervention saved him from prison in Vienna in 1778. He claimed to be able to assemble up to 10,000 Montenegrins ready to fight for the emperor's interests in Austrian Netherlands. Stefan's plot collapsed while he was in Ath, from where he left yet another time for Frankfurt, where he resided from 19 March to 12 June in 1784. Living off various hoaxes and frauds, he there collected 5,764 Dutch guilders from a bank using a false promissory note from Duchess of Kingston. On 11 August 1784, he arrived in Frauenbr√ºnnl monastery in Abbach near Straubing and presented himself as an exiled prince seeking sanctuary and peace, thus spending some time there, making it his seat of operations in the process. He regularly paid visits to Augsburg, Regensburg and Munich, establishing contacts with wealthy merchants and persuading them to enter Dutch market where he had considerable influence. During his time in Frauenbr√ºnnl, he rarely left his room and often made overgenerous contributions to the poor locals.http://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/istorija/petrovici_xviii_vijek/stjepan_anibal_zanovic.htmhttp://www.butua.com/knjizevnost/2010/stjepan_zanovic_m_pantic.html Work The most important work, Turska pisma or Turkish Letters (Lettere turche, original title) by Stefano Zannowich, first published in Dresden in 1776, Serbian literary historiography never treated them as a novelist.

In a racing career which lasted from June 1990 until April 1992 she won four of her seven races. She was one of the best juvenile fillies in Britain and Ireland in 1990 when she won four races including the Debutante Stakes, Moyglare Stud Stakes and Cheveley Park Stakes. She missed the whole of the next season and was then sent to race in the United States where she made no impact in two starts. She was retired from racing to become a broodmare in Japan and produced at least eleven winners. Background Capricciosa was a bay mare bred in Ireland by M Maguire. She was sired by Alzao, a son of Lyphard who never won above Group Three level, but became a successful breeding stallion, his progeny including Alborada, Second Set and Shahtoush. Capricciosa was the best racehorse produced her dam, the unraced Clanjingle who was descended from the influential broodmare Molly Desmond. The filly was acquired by the British businessman Robert Sangster and was sent into training with Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. She was ridden in all of her European races by John Reid. Racing career 1990: two-year-old season On her racecourse debut, Capricciosa started 9/2 second favourite for a maiden race over five furlongs at the Curragh on 30 June 1990. She won by two and a half lengths from the Dermot Weld-trained favourite Inishdalla with four lengths back to the Jim Bolger-trained Noora Park in third. The filly was moved up sharply in class for the Group One Heinz \\"57\\" Phoenix Stakes at Phoenix Park Racecourse on 12 August. She started the joint second favourite on 5/1 but finished tenth of the thirteen runners behind the British-trained colt Mac's Imp. Twelve days after her poor run at Phoenix Park, the filly recorded her first important success when she started 11/10 favourite for the Group Three Debutante Stakes over the same course and distance and won by two lengths from Inishdalla. On 9 September Capricciosa faced Inishdalla yet again in the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh. The other fancied runners included the John Oxx-trained Isle of Glass, Capricciosa's stable companion African Dance and the British challengers Zigaura (placed in the Cherry Hinton Stakes and the Princess Margaret Stakes) and Jameelaty (runner- up in the Sweet Solera Stakes). Capricciosa won by three quarters of a length and half a length from Inishdalla and Zigaura. On her final appearance of the season, Capricciosa was sent to England for the Group One Cheveley Park over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 3 October. The French-trained Divine Danse (winner of the Prix d'Arenberg) started favourite ahead of Imperfect Circle (Firth of Clyde Stakes) with Capricciosa next in the betting on 7/1. The other eight runners included Zigaura and the Lowther Stakes winner Only Yours. Reid sent the Irish filly into the lead from the start before accelerating a furlong out. Capricciosa kept on well in the closing stages to hold off the challenge of Imperfect Circle and win by three quarters of a length with two and a half lengths back to Divine Danse in third. 1992: four-year-old season Capricciosa missed the whole of the 1991 season with training problems and injuries. In 1992 she was relocated to race in the United States where she was trained by Gary F. Jones. On her North American debut she finished fifth in an allowance race at Santa Anita Park in February. On her final appearance she contested the Grade III Las Cienegas Handicap over six and a half furlongs at the same track on 4 April and finished sixth behind Heart of Joy. Breeding record Capricciosa was retired from racing to become a broodmare in Japan. She has produced seventeen foals and eleven winners between 1993 and 2011: *Saint Aria, a bay colt, foaled in 1993, sired by Woodman. Won one race. *Brand Carey, bay filly, 1994, by Sakura Yutaka O.

It is native to the south- central United States, where it occurs in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, and eastern Oklahoma.  Description  The redfin darter can reach a length of , though most only reach about . Females and juveniles grayish and mottled with 8-10 vague saddles on their backs. The snout is slightly pointed and the lips are dark. There are prominent bars that are suborbital and extend above, behind, and in front of the eye creating a cross through the eye. The bar in front of the eye nearly joins with the bar on the opposite side of the upper lip, making it appear in a spear-like pattern if viewed from above. Etheostoma whipplei have an incomplete lateral line and the cheeks and breast area appear naked. Males in breeding colors have bright red spots that occur on the sides, the spots may not be as vivid and distinct in some specimens located in central Louisiana. They also have red spots on the spinous dorsal basal interradial membranes, and then a broad golden area followed by a bright red submarginal band with a deep blue band on the fin margin. The anal fin had a red base with the same vivid, deep blue as the dorsal, in the margins.  Habitat  The redfin darter's principle habitat is gravely or rubble riffles in small rivers, but in Louisiana and Mississippi it is associated with aquatic vegetation.  Reproduction and life cycle  Redfin darters have a spawning period of 2.7 to 3 months from February to May. Females can produce clutches of 31-207 eggs. Males reach spawning conditions earlier than females in the species, and males are larger than females. Mature eggs average 0.89-1.18 mm in diameter and ripe eggs average 1.17-1.27 mm. Breeding males have vivid red and blue colors on the fins and body, like the Gulf darter (Etheostoma swaini).  Etymology  Etheostoma whipplei is named after Amiel Weeks Whipple, a United States Army officer on whose expeditions many plant and animal taxa were first described.

Reilly. It is loosely based on Turkington's Neil Hamburger character. The plot follows a stand-up comedian as he performs in various locations where the audience is either hostile or indifferent to him. Alverson, Turkington and Tim Heidecker co-wrote the film. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2015. It was released in a limited theatrical release by Magnolia Pictures in North America, and through video on demand in November 2015, receiving a generally positive reception from film critics. Plot After touring an aircraft boneyard in the California desert, the film's main subject (Gregg Turkington) performs a stand-up routine as the character of Neil Hamburger to an audience of prisoners following a clown act by \\"Eddie the Opener\\" (Tye Sheridan). The convicts react positively to his openly sexist, racist, and homophobic jokes. Back at his hotel, he leaves a voicemail for his daughter while a soap opera plays on television. The next morning, he hikes across rock formations before performing at a bar, but the show goes poorly as few patrons laugh and one heckles him. This causes the performer to express irritation (in character) with the audience and the heckler. The performer's cousin John (John C. Reilly) approaches him after the show and awkwardly converses about the unenthusiastic audience while passively criticizing the raunchiness of his routine. He responds defensively to the criticisms and blames the poor reception of the routine on the heckler. At another hotel that night, the comedian leaves a second voicemail for his daughter. The next day, he tours an oil field. Another show takes place that night at another bar. Eddie the Opener gets a relatively positive reaction from the crowd, but the main character receives very little positivity himself, expressing the same in- character frustrations with the audience. After being told by the manager of the establishment that no hotel rooms are available, he stays at the house of the manager's cousin. A female member of the family watches the main character sleep as an image of him in a hallway dressed entirely in white appears on- screen. He tours a ghost town the next day, leaving a very despondent voicemail for his daughter in which he laments how hard it is to reach her. He spends the rest of the day with his cousin John, who drunkenly attempts to encourage the main character that night. The comedian goes to a bowling alley and a shooting park the following day before crashing a chromotherapy seminar that night and falling asleep in the midst of it. At his hotel, he runs into the woman who was giving the lecture (Lotte Verbeek). She puts him in a red- light therapy booth before setting up chairs for another seminar, and he watches the same soap opera again in his hotel room. Another show takes place the next day, but only Eddie is shown performing to a wildly energetic crowd. The comedian gets a call from an online filmmaker who wants him to star in a video. He arrives in the desert with the filmmakers the next day but soon wanders off, seemingly impatient and irritated. Before a show, Eddie approaches the comedian and briefly expresses his gratitude for working with him, but the performer responds somewhat indifferently. The show goes disastrously: not a single patron of the bar laughs and the comedian aims extremely vulgar insults at a woman (Amy Seimetz), who throws a drink at him before leaving the bar, then assaults him as he is walking to his car. Eddie tries to help him by taking him to his hotel room, but the comedian eventually lashes out at his partner as well. The next morning, the comedian stops on the road to examine a wrecked car. He hits a dog on the road that night, and later, in a public bathroom, a stranger named Tommy (Michael Cera) claims his car has broken down and asks if the performer can keep him company while he waits for help. The Comedian responds very little, staring blankly. He gets extremely drunk in his hotel room and leaves another voicemail to his daughter in which he quietly sings Ave Maria. Later, the comedian performs at a white trash party where he ends up staying the night. Afterwards, he visits a public restroom where he investigates the cries of a woman coming from the women's restroom. He finds a woman in labor who begs for his help; the film cuts to the bloodied comedian falling asleep against the wall of the bathroom as he holds the presumably stillborn infant. He wakes up the next morning to find children smearing chocolate on the window of the car he was sleeping in. That night, during his act, the comedian picks up a trophy at the venue, aims it at the audience, and pretends to fire at them; he eventually resorts to making fart noises with his mouth before walking off stage. The manager of the venue tells him, \\"We're not paying for that\\" before the performer leaves. He later leaves a fifth voicemail for his daughter in a public restroom. At the pool party of a celebrity (Tim Heidecker) the next day, the comedian emerges from a cake before having a mental breakdown on stage and throwing himself into the pool. As he swims to the edge of the pool, images appear of him dripping wet on stage, wearing the same white outfit seen before, and exiting a jail cell. He enters the set of the soap opera that he had been watching; the film ends as the comedian has a manic episode while watching himself on screen.

Alverson proposed to Turkington the idea of making a film based on his character Neil Hamburger. The two discussed what Hamburger's character would be like off stage, both finding that his life would be dull and not very dynamic. Turkington had been previously offered to make a film or television programs revolving around the character approaching people in the street which he felt was wrong for the character and was far more interested in a film that he described as a \\"Two- Lane Blacktop‚Äù art film kind of vibe.\\" The film's script was written by Alverson, Turkington and Tim Heidecker. The film's dialogue is improvised. Turkington described the dialogue as \\"really more based on descriptions of the tone or the mood that was needed in particular scenes, and kind of running with that. Turkington and Alverson initially disagreed on some aspects of the Neil Hamburger character, such as never showing the character without his glasses and never showing the character talking in a normal voice. Alverson felt the film wouldn't be credible if Turkington constantly spoke in his Neil Hamburger voice. Among the locations Hamburger visits in the film is an aircraft boneyard. No actual tours take place at the location which was part of a military facility in Mojave, California, which allowed them a few hours to film where they could only shoot the film in certain directions. Release and reception Entertainment premiered at the Next Section at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2015. It received generally favorable reviews. The film has an 80% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on forty reviews, with the consensus: \\"As brilliantly and uncomfortably confrontational as its protagonist, Entertainment is a boundary- blurring exercise in cinematic misanthropy that more than lives up to its title.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, gave the film a 65 out of 100 based on thirteen reviews from critics. In The New Yorker, critic Richard Brody calls Turkington's character an \\"intentionally, repulsively unfunny comedian\\" and Alverson's film a \\"wildly imaginative, grimly sardonic anti-comedy.\\" Notes External links * American films ","title":"Entertainment (2015 film)"},{"id":"48745179","text":"Cannabis in Namibia is illegal for recreational and medical uses, but cannabis and mandrax (methaqualone) are the most popular illicit drugs in the country.

It was launched in 1698, and sank in battle off the coast of Cartagena, Colombia, in 1708 while laden with gold, silver and emeralds worth about US$17 billion as of 2018. The sunken ship was located by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in November 2015. In July 2017 it was announced that a salvage operation would go ahead.  Career  San Jos√© was designed by Francisco Antonio Garrote and built by Pedro de Ar√≥stegui at the shipyard in Mapil, Usurbil, Gipuzkoa, Spain. Construction started in 1697 and ended in 1698. They built twin ships simultaneously and named them San Jos√© and San Joaqu√≠n. San Jos√© and San Joaqu√≠n were part of the Spanish treasure fleet during the War of the Spanish Succession, under General Jos√© Fern√°ndez de Santill√°n, the Count of Casa Alegre. On its final voyage, San Jos√© sailed as the flagship of a treasure fleet composed of three Spanish warships and 14 merchant vessels sailing from Portobelo, Panama, to Cartagena, Colombia. On 8 June 1708, the fleet encountered a British squadron near Bar√∫, leading to a battle known as Wager's Action. During the battle, the powder magazines of San Jos√© detonated, destroying the ship with most of her crew and the gold, silver, emeralds and jewellery collected in the South American colonies to finance the Spanish king's war effort. Of the 600 people aboard, only eleven survived.  Search and discovery  8 escudos). 27.07 grams, 91.70% purity San Jos√©, is estimated to be worth about $1 billion (¬£662m) as of 2012, based on the speculation that it had up to 11 million 4-doubloons (11 million 8 escudos gold coins; 11 million coins of 27g of 92% gold totaling 8.8 million troy ounces AGW or $11.5 billion) and many silver coins on board at the time of its sinking, similar to its surviving sister ship, San Joaqu√≠n. The silver and gold are from the mines of Potos√≠, Bolivia. San Jos√© is called the \\"Holy Grail of Shipwrecks\\". A group of investors from the United States called Glocca Mora Co. operating under the name 'Sea Search Armada' (SSA) claim to have found the ship off the coast of Colombia in 1981, but Colombia refused to sign a 65%/35% share offer and refused SSA permission to conduct full salvage operations at the shipwreck site. The Colombian parliament then passed a law giving the state the right to all of the treasure, leaving SSA with a 5% finder's fee, which was to be taxed at 45%. SSA sued Colombia in its own courts in 1989. In July 2007 the Supreme Court of Colombia concluded that any treasure recovered would be split equally between the Colombian government and the explorers. Sea Search Armada subsequently sued in United States courts, but the case was dismissed twice, in 2011 and 2015 on technical grounds, and the galleon declared the property of the Colombian state. The Colombian government declined to verify that the galleon was at the coordinates stated in the case. On 27 November 2015, the galleon San Jos√© was found by the Colombian Navy though the discovery was not announced by the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, until 5 December. The discovery was made using a REMUS 6000 autonomous underwater vehicle. From the dive photographs, Colombian marine archaeologists have identified San Jos√© by her bronze guns engraved with dolphins. Colombia has claimed the galleon as part of its submerged patrimony, thus it is constitutionally obliged to protect and preserve the ship and all its sunken contents. The Government of Colombia has classified the information regarding the location of the galleon as a state secret.

The director of the ICANH, Ernesto Montenegro, has stated that soil, and sea depth studies are being carried out in order to examine the methods of extraction of the ship's contents. Then Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, has also stated that a museum will be constructed in Cartagena to host some of the contents of the galleon. On 16 December 2015, the Office of the Inspector General of Colombia requested that the State, and the rest of the parties involved, be responsible for keeping thorough archives regarding the exploration and intervention of the galleon, requesting that the archives be turned in to the Ministry of Culture which is the governmental entity responsible of the underwater cultural heritage. The Inspector General also requested that a representative sum of the coins, ingots, and gemstones, which are not considered to be cultural patrimony under the concept of repetition, must be given to the central bank, Banco de la Rep√∫blica, for preservation. The Minister of Culture, Mariana Garc√©s C√≥rdoba, stated that 2016 will be \\"a year of exploration, not extraction\\". According to the Minister, Colombia sees the discovery as a project of investigation that implies the creation of laboratories that will include the entailment of specialists from different work areas, in order to properly study the shipwreck and its contents.

He then left the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company and pursued a career with an international shipping line before returning to the Isle of Man and re-joining the Steam Packet Company. The summer of 1909 saw Capt. Teare in command of the King Orry. Following the summer season he went on shore leave and as the year closed he resumed command of the Ellan Vannin for a month's winter service, which by December 1909 was the smallest and oldest vessel in the Steam Packet Fleet. Known for being a cautious and diligent captain as well as a lifelong teetotaler, James Teare was married with four children and lived at No 9 York Road, Douglas, Isle of Man. RMS Ellan Vannin pictured departing Douglas. Ellan Vannin disaster On Friday 3 December 1909, Ellan Vannin left her home port of Ramsey at 01:13hrs, under the command of Captain Teare. Ellan Vannin was carrying 15 passengers and 21 crew as well as mail and 60 tonnes of cargo which included approximately 60 sheep. The weather on departure was moderate and although the barometric pressure was falling Captain Teare did not expect a significant deterioration in the weather. The wind direction on departure was from the northwest meaning the Ellan Vannin would have a following sea during her passage, something which would have caused her Master no particular concern.The Isle of Man Examiner. December 4th, 1909, (p.9) However, the weather rapidly worsened and by 06:35hrs, when the ship arrived at the Mersey Bar Lightship, the wind had risen to a Hurricane Force 12, and waves were reported to be exceeding in height.Ships of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (Fred Henry, 1973) p.10 A strong consensus at the time was that with a following sea the Ellan Vannin had made good progress to the Bar Lightship. Upon reaching the Bar her course would have been changed from approximately 130 degrees to 080 degrees as she entered the approach channel to the river. This would have caused her to take the sea on her port beam with the result that she got sufficiently off her course to strike a sandbank thereby causing her to founder, (a nautical term for filling with water and sinking), between the Bar lightship and the Q1 buoy sinking in the Mersey approach channel (at ). It is believed she was broached by a large wave, which overwhelmed the ship. She was swept by heavy seas and filled, sinking by the stern with the loss of all passengers and crew. The home of Captain James Teare, York Road, Douglas, Isle of Man.The grave of Captain James Teare, Douglas Borough Cemetery, Douglas, Isle of Man. News of the disaster reached Douglas on the Friday evening, and the directors sat in almost continuous session until Monday. Communication was by telegram and information was difficult to ascertain. At approximately 19:00hrs a telegram was received which reported that the crew of the Formby Lightship had seen lifebuoys, bags of turnips, several dead sheep and a piano floating near the lightship. It was also reported that the crew of the lightship had picked up a mail bag which was destined for the Birkenhead Post Office and which was found to contain letters despatched from Ramsey. The following morning the company offices in Douglas received a telegram from Liverpool stating that one of the Ellan Vannin's lifeboats had been washed ashore at New Brighton with its cover on and its working gear inside. Also washed ashore were parts of the ship's bridge. It was five days after the ship went down that the first bodies were recovered. On Monday 17 January 1910 Captain Teare's body was found washed ashore on Ainsdale beach in Southport with an inquest into his death being held on Wednesday 19 January.Ramsey Courier. Friday January 21, 1910 (p.4) Also on 17 January the body of First Officer John Craine was found. It too had been washed ashore at Southport. Both bodies were subsequently returned to the Isle of Man for burial. Aftermath Headline in the Ramsey Courier, Saturday 10 December 1909.The Board of Trade inquiry found that Captain Teare was not to blame for the disaster and the cause was extreme weather. The official inquiry referred to waves high and declared the ship to have been in good condition and fully seaworthy. After the foundering, her masts broke the surface. Divers inspecting the ship found damage to the bows and that the lifeboat davits had been swung out ready for lowering. Soon after the disaster the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board destroyed the wreck using explosives, as it was causing a hazard to shipping in the channel. Although the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has a tradition of reusing ship names, they have never reused the name . A song written by Hughie Jones of The Spinners commemorates the disaster.

First published in 2014 by Fourth Estate, it talks about the definition of feminism for the 21st century. The essay was adapted from Adichie's 2012 TEDx talk of the same name, first delivered at TEDx Euston in London, which has been viewed more than six million times.We should all be feminists Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie TEDxEuston, YouTube, 2013. Content We Should All Be Feminists includes anecdotes and analyses about what it means to be a feminist. She argues that \\"feminist\\" isn't an insult, but rather a label that should be embraced by all. While feminism advocates for equity and equality between men and women in all aspects of life, the fiercest opposers of women's liberation believe that feminism is a social movement that focuses on reversing gender roles and making men inferior. Adichie's \\"We Should All Be Feminists,\\" succinctly unearths the need to transform social beliefs and gender constructs that promote the disparity between men and women. In essence, we should all be feminists not only as a commitment to women's liberation but also as a way of encouraging men to hold conversations with women on sexuality, appearance, roles, and success. Being a feminist entails championing for the rights of women and trying to make the world a better place for women. Feminism does not entirely challenge the biological roles of each gender as it only intends to revolutionize sexism by creating equal chances and opportunities for women and men. Feminism views people as human beings and aims to tackle the social injustices that silence people's will and power to exceed social expectations. Therefore, becoming a feminist normalizes women's success and allows men to strive to achieve even more in life. Participating in the contemporary feminism paves the way for a prosperous and all-inclusive future society. Empowering women is not equivalent to taking away opportunities from men. Teaching the community to accord equal respect to women creates a conducive environment for success. Therefore, encouraging people to become feminists tunes their minds away from cultural and social constructs that limit their understanding of gender on sexuality and roles and allows men and women to become who they want to be without restrictions. The book is critical of the way masculinity is constructed, suggesting that society as a whole must change if we are to reach equality.  Adaptations  Audio from Adichie's talk was included in Beyonc√©'s 2013 song \\"***Flawless\\". Adichie was credited with a featured role on the track. Caroline Framke, \\"Every Swedish teenager is about to get a brilliant crash course in feminism\\", Vox, 7 December 2015. Adichie has largely remained silent about her feelings on Beyonc√©'s use of her speech, but in a 2016 interview in Dutch magazine De Volkskrant, while acknowledging that with the song Beyonc√© had reached many people who otherwise might never have heard the word feminism, Adichie said: \\"Still, her type of feminism is not mine, as it is the kind that, at the same time, gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men. I think men are lovely, but I don‚Äôt think that women should relate everything they do to men: did he hurt me, do I forgive him, did he put a ring on my finger? We women are so conditioned to relate everything to men. Put a group of women together and the conversation will eventually be about men. Put a group of men together and they will not talk about women at all, they will just talk about their own stuff. We women should spend about 20 percent of our time on men, because it‚Äôs fun, but otherwise we should also be talking about our own stuff.\\"Sarah Al- Shalash, \\"We Can All Be Feminists: Adichie versus Beyonc√©\\", The Politics, 21 October 2016.Jackson McHenry, \\"Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Doesn‚Äôt Think Beyonc√©‚Äôs Feminism Is Flawless: ‚ÄòHer Style Is Not My Style\\", Vulture, 7 October 2016.

Exometabolomics, also known as 'metabolic footprinting', is the study of extracellular metabolites and is a sub-field of metabolomics. While the same analytical approaches used for profiling metabolites apply to exometabolomics, including liquid- chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry (GC‚ÄìMS), analysis of exometabolites provides specific challenges and is most commonly focused on investigation of the transformations of exogenous metabolite pools by biological systems. Typically, these experiments are performed by comparing metabolites at two or more time points, for example, spent vs. uninoculated/control culture media; this approach can differentiate different physiological states of wild-type yeast and between yeast mutants. Since, in many cases, the exometabolite (extracellular) pool is less dynamic than endometabolite (intracellular) pools (which are often perturbed during sample processing) and chemically defined media can be used, it reduces some of the experimental challenges of metabolomics. Exometabolomics is also used as a complementary tool with genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data, to gain insight into the function of genes and pathways. Additionally, exometabolomics can be used to measure polar molecules being consumed or released by an organism, and to measure secondary metabolite production.  History  The study of extracellular metabolites has been prevalent in scientific literature. However, global exometabolite profiling was only realized with recent advances allowing for improved chromatographic separation and detection of hundreds to thousands of compounds by the mid-2000s. The first work to demonstrate the biological relevance of comparative profiling of exometabolite pools was not until 2003, when the term \\"metabolite footprinting\\" was coined by Jess Allen and coworkers. This work attracted a great deal of interest in the community, particularly for characterization of microbial metabolism. The idea of the \\"exometabolome\\" encompassing the components of the exometabolite pool was not introduced until 2005. Recent advances in mass spectrometry imaging have allowed for spatial localization of released metabolites. As the field of microbiology becomes increasingly more centered on microbial community structure, exometabolomics has provided for rapid understanding of metabolic interactions between two or more species. Recently, exometabolomics has been used to design co-culture systems. Because the analysis of extracellular metabolites allows for the predictions and determinations of metabolite exchange, exometabolomics analyses can be used for understanding community ecological networks. Analytical technologies In principle, any technologies used for metabolomics can be used for exometabolomics. However, liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry (LC‚ÄìMS) has been the most widely used. As with typical metabolomic measurements, metabolites are identified based on accurate mass, retention time, and their MS/MS fragmentation patterns, in comparison to authentic standards. Chromatographies typically used are hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography for the measurement of polar metabolites, or reversed-phase (C18) chromatography for the measurement of non-polar compounds, lipids, and secondary metabolites. Gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry can also be used to measure sugars and other carbohydrates, and to obtain complete metabolic profiles. Because LC‚ÄìMS does not give spatial data on metabolite localization, it can be complemented with mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Applications Exometabolomic techniques have been used in the following fields:  Functional genomics  Metabolite utilization to annotate function of unknown genes.  Bioenergy  In lignocellulosic feedstock studies.  Agriculture and food  Characterization of plant root exometabolites to determine how exometabolites affect Plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria.

In 1694, she left home to enter the novitiate of the Ursulines of Quebec and received the religious habit of the Order and her religious name from Jean-Baptiste de La Croix de Chevri√®res de Saint-Vallier, the Bishop of Quebec, on 14 September of that year. Two years later, on 18 September 1696, she professed religious vows and became a member of the Order. Her dowry was paid in both land and money. Boucher served as bursar, as mistress of novices and boarders and as assistant superior. In 1750 she was elected superior of the monastery, holding that office for three years. At the end of her term, she was again elected as the assistant superior, serving from 1753 to 1759 in this office. At the end of this period, her health was no longer good and she retired from that post. Boucher died at Quebec City at the age of 89.

He was the co-founder and owner of the St. Louis Hawks of the National Basketball Association, the present-day Atlanta Hawks. In 1946 along with business partner Leo Ferris, Kerner founded a professional team in Buffalo, New York, which became the Moline, Illinois- based Tri-Cities Blackhawks after a few games. Kerner moved the team to Milwaukee in 1951 and to St. Louis in 1955. His 1958 St. Louis Hawks won the NBA Championship. Notable transactions Bob Pettit in 1957 During the 1946-47 season, Ferris and Kerner added Pop Gates to the Buffalo-Tri-Cities team. Gates finished second on the team in scoring, behind 1948 NBL MVP Don Otten. A Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame player, Gates was a factor in integrating the league and the first African-American coach in a major league when he coached Dayton in 1948. Kerner hired Naismith Hall of Fame coach Red Auerbach for the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, located in Moline, Illinois in 1949. When he discovered that Kerner had traded a player without consulting him, Auerbach left the Blackhawks to coach the Boston Celtics for the 1950-51 season and won a record nine NBA championships with the Celtics.\\"Atlanta Hawks\\"2012Drew Silvermanp.15ABDOPublishing In 1950, Kerner drafted Naismith Hall of Fame player Bob Cousy in the first round (number four) and sold him to the Chicago Stags. Cousy, reportedly unhappy to go to a small-town area, wanted $10,000 to sign with the Blackhawks and Kerner countered with $6,000 before selling him to the Stags. Cousy played for Auerbach in Boston when the Stags were sold, and played in 13 consecutive All-Star games. Kerner drafted Hall of Fame player Bob Pettit in the first round (number two) in 1954. Pettit, who averaged 26 points and 16 rebounds per game over his career, was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1959. At , Pettit was a ten- time first-team All-NBA member and retired as the all-time leading NBA scorer. His 16.2 per-game rebound average is third in league history, behind Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. In 1956, Kerner drafted Hall of Fame player Bill Russell as the second pick in the first round and traded him to the Boston Celtics for Cliff Hagan and former St. Louis University star Ed Macauley. Russell replaced Auerbach as coach of the Celtics, winning two titles as player-coach. Bill Russell and Red Auerbach in 1956 From 1953-54 to 1956-57, the Hawks were coached by Hall of Fame coach Red Holzman. Holzman was replaced in 1956-57 by Hall of Fame coach Alex Hannum.Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Holzman later won two NBA championships with the New York Knicks, and Hannum led the Hawks to the NBA championship before he was fired after the title season. In 1960, Kerner drafted Hall of Fame player and coach Lenny Wilkens as the sixth pick of the first round. After retiring as a player, Wilkens coached for 32 NBA seasons and won over 1,300 games. Hawks-Celtics rivalry Kerner had a number of ties to the Boston Celtics; he had employed Celtics coach Red Auerbach, drafted Bob Cousy and Bill Russell and obtained former Celtics Cliff Hagan and Ed Macauley. By the late 1950s, the teams had met three times in the NBA finals; Kerner's Hawks were built around four Hall of Fame players: Hagan, Macauley, Med Park and Bob Pettit.\\"Rags to Riches Story For Ben Kerner\\"Bill Lutwein, Milwaukee Journal April a5, 1958p.21 The 1957 NBA Finals went to seven games as the Hawks lost to the Celtics' Auerbach, Russell and Cousy. During the finals, Auerbach and Kerner confronted each other on the court in a dispute over the height of the basket and Auerbach punched Kerner. Although he was not ejected, Auerbach was later fined $300 for the incident.\\"Tall Tales: The Glory Years of the NBA\\" 1992 Terry Pluto, Simon & Schusterp.138-139 1958 NBA championship The next season gave Kerner and the Hawks their championship, as the Hawks and Celtics met in the 1958 NBA Finals for the second consecutive year. This time the Hawks won, defeating the Celtics four games to two. Pettit scored 50 points in the deciding game, tipping in the final basket for a 110-109 victory at home. The Celtics, still coached by Auerbach, and the Hawks (coached by Ed Macauley) met for a third time in the 1960 NBA Finals. The finals went seven games, with the Celtics winning game seven 122-103 at the Boston Garden. Pettit averaged 25 points per game during the series. Sale and move to Atlanta After the 1967-68 season, Kerner sold the St. Louis Hawks to Thomas Cousins and former Georgia governor Carl Sanders. The new owners moved the team to Atlanta, where they remain as the Atlanta Hawks. Venues Under Kerner's ownership, the Tri-Cities Blackhawks played at Wharton Field House in Moline, Illinois.

This species has cane-like stems and forms dense clumps in the understorey, a feature that makes it unique among the Eulophiinae species found in Madagascar. Like other orchid species in Eulophia and Oeceoclades that are adapted to arid climates, O. beravensis has narrow and coriaceous (leathery and stiff, but flexible) leaves with minute serrations. Because of habitat loss and existing threats to the dry forests and grasslands of Madagascar, O. beravensis was preliminarily assessed as \\"Near Threatened\\" using the International Union for Conservation of Nature guidelines. It was first described by the German botanist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach in 1881 as Eulophia beravensis and later moved to the genus Lissochilus by the French botanist Joseph Marie Henry Alfred Perrier de la B√¢thie in 1941.

Typically, the business processes managed with back-office software include some combination of inventory control, price book management, manufacturing, and supply chain management (SCM). Back-office software is distinct from front-office software, which typically refers to customer relationship management (CRM) software used for managing sales, marketing, and other customer-centric activities. Back-office software solutions have evolved with the emergence of cloud-based software as a service (SaaS). Several back-office software providers offer cloud-based services that simplify and streamline back-office management functions, particularly for companies with multiple locations. These simplified platforms have given companies an alternative to business process outsourcing (BPO), which involves handing over the management of a company's back-office to a third-party service provider. With back-office software, companies can derive actionable intelligence from the system without any particular expertise.  Cloud-based back-office software  Cloud-based back-office software provides the functionality necessary to manage numerous back-office functions from a single web-based interface. Many back-office software platforms can be accessed from both mobile and desktop devices, and are cross compatible with back-office accounting software such as Quickbooks. Some of the most common back-office software functionality options include: * Item-level inventory management * Cash register management/point of sale (POS) management * Price book management * Loyalty program management * Sales promotion * Sales forecasting * Data exchange (e.g. electronic data interchange (EDI)) * Invoice processing * Key performance indicator (KPI) monitoring (e.g. gross margin, profit margin) * Workflow management * Business reporting  Applications   Franchises  Cloud-based back-office solutions are used by franchisors for sales, inventory, and price book management. Franchisors can control inventory prices, optimize inventory supply based on projections, manage company-wide promotions, and monitor sales performance at each franchisee location from one centralized platform.  Convenience and retail stores  Companies in the convenience and retail industries use back-office software to manage inventory and identify opportunities to improve profit margins by keeping popular items in stock, preventing spoilage and shrink, as well as reducing overstock of unpopular items (by offering discounts and promotions, for example). Software allows back-office store operators to forecast inventory levels based on sales volumes and therefore optimize the store's turnover ratios (the ratio of how many times inventory is sold and replaced over a given period). Moreover, the measurement of inventory performance data allows store operators to benchmark their performance with published industry averages (e.g. from the National Association of Convenience Stores). Though turnover ratios depend on demand- side factors such as how desirable a product is, they can be increased through efficient back-office management. For instance, a case study involving a Pittsburgh-based convenience store operator showed that the company was able to achieve an average turnover ratio of 16.12 (compared to the 2013 US convenience store average of 11.36) by using cloud-based back-office software for inventory management. Back-office software can also be used to account for the effects of demand substitution and subsequently determine the optimal inventory level for each item stocked. Researchers have attempted to predict the increases in demand for complementary items (resulting from demand substitution) using a probabilistic model for selecting item inventory levels in order to maximize expected profit. Another study employed a stochastic model to optimize the inventory management process at Spain-based retailer Zara: the new model increased sales by $275 million (3‚Äì4%) in 2007 and Zara continues to use the process for all of its products and at all retail locations.  Accounting  According to research from IDC Industry Insights, more than half of all small businesses in the US use Intuit software (Quickbooks) for accounting. But with the growth of the SaaS market, Quickbooks along with other emerging online accounting options such as https://bimpos.com/ BIM CALC or Outright and Mint.com are now being adopted. These options are simple to use, but may have limited functionality compared to desktop accounting solutions. Accounting software is often integrated into or connected to back-office software for inventory management to simplify the exchange of store data between operational and other retail systems.  Supply chain  Supply chain managers use back-office software to match sales data with supply chain data and to streamline product ordering. All of the steps in supply chain management (SCM), including procurement, conversion, transportation, distribution, and partner coordination/collaboration can be controlled via back-office software. This process of enhanced information sharing and supply chain streamlining has been demonstrated to decrease supply chain costs by an average of 2.2%. Though back-office software reduces the likelihood of inventory record inaccuracies, they can still occur if items are not properly tracked as they enter/exit the retail space. One way to limit the impact of record inaccuracy is to use a Bayesian belief network of the physical inventory, creating a probability distribution that is updated as inventory inaccuracies are discovered. The application of Bayesian principles to inventories can avoid instances of inventory freezing (when physical inventory levels reach zero but records indicate otherwise).  Human resources  There are many cloud-based HR solutions available for payroll management, timesheet tracking, and hiring.

Bruckner tried to complete his knowledge in musical form and instrumentation with Kitzler after the end of his studies with Simon Sechter.  Description  Beethoven and Bruckner Stained glass window, Linz Cathedral The workbook is composed of 163 pages of different sizes in landscape format (326 numbered pages) in chronological order, some of them dated, from (Holy Night, 1861) on p. 30, to 10 July 1863 on p. 325.U. Harten, pp. 233-234C. van Zwol, p. 90 The workbook contains autograph sketches, comments, complete and partial compositions, which are displaying a rigorous tuition in musical formatting and instrumentation. The first entries (pp. 1-18) are exercises in musical form: cadences and periods. They are followed (pp. 18-57) by lieder in two and three parts, and (pp. 58-218) by pieces for piano and string quartet: waltz, polka, mazurka, √©tudes, theme and variations, rondos, sonata form, etc., and the String Quartet in C minor and its additional Rondo. The exercises in form are followed (pp. 218-250) by exercises of instrumentation, among others the orchestration of the first movement of Beethoven's Sonate path√©tique (introduction and exposition, repetition and coda). These exercises are followed (pp; 251-326) by Bruckner's first orchestral compositions: the Four Orchestral Pieces (March in D minor and Three Orchestral Pieces). The volume ends with sketches for the Overture in G minor and for the Symphony in F minor.  Complete and partial compositions  A not exhaustive list:  Edition and performances  Until 2015, only few of the compositions of the study book were published: the String Quartet and the additional Rondo in C minor (transcription allowed to Leopold Nowak),C. van Zwol, p. 682C. van Zwol, p. 676 the Sonatensatz in G minor (transcription allowed to Walburga Litschauer),C. van Zwol, p. 677 and the Four Orchestral Pieces (issued from a clean transcription given by Bruckner to Cyrill Hynais).U.

Mazama was, reportedly, the only craft ever to navigate the Wood River, a tributary of upper Klamath Lake. For a few years, until the construction of a rail line, Mazama was an important link in transportation system linking Fort Klamath to Klamath Falls. Route and ownership Mazama ran on a regular route from Klamath Falls to the town of Fort Klamath, Oregon, which required a run up the Wood River, which was a narrow and very crooked stream. Mazama was owned by Jasper B.C. \\"Jap\\" Taylor and Millard Fillmore \\"Cap\\" Parker. Their business was to haul freight to Agency Landing for Fort Klamath. On the return, the vessel usually transported hay to Klamath Falls. In March, 1908, articles of incorporation were filed with the Oregon Secretary of State for the Crater Lake Navigation Company, naming Millard Filmore \\"M.F.\\" Parker (1856-1930), J.B.C. Taylor, and Jennie Gates as the incorporators. The company was capitalized at $5,000, and reportedly all the stock had already been sold. J.B.C. Taylor was to be the general manager. The company's stated corporate purpose was to operate steam and electric boats, carrying passengers and freight, on upper Klamath Lake and its tributaries, including the Wood River. Construction In early 1908, J.B.C. \\"Jap\\" Taylor and M.F. \\"Cap\\" Parker began building Mazama near Hanks Landing on upper Klamath Lake. The boat was intended to be 50 feet long, with a 12-foot beam (width), powered by two 12 horsepower steam engines driving twin propellers. By the end of February, the keel had been laid, the frames assembled, and lumber was ready for the sides. The boat was anticipated to be placed in use by May 1. Reportedly it was specially built for operations on the Wood River to make the sharp turns around the river's bends, which could not be done by larger vessels, such as the Winema. In March 1908, J.B.C. Taylor went to San Francisco to purchase machinery for the steamer which was still under construction. Taylor was able to buy the machinery for $3,500. The steamer was launched on May 4, 1908, however the machinery had not yet arrived. The engines arrived later that month, and were scheduled to be installed into Mazama in the week starting June 1. Operations Mazama sometime between 1908 and 1912, before reconstruction. The vessel's owners are standing on the foredeck:Jasper B.C. \\"Jap\\" Taylor, on left, and Millard Fillmore \\"Cap\\" Parker on right. On July 29, 1908, Mazama made its first trip up the Wood River, reaching the Weed Bridge, at river mile 5.9. This was a point three miles away from Fort Klamath. A telephone report from the Klamath Agency had been received stating that the steamer could be seen working its way up the river. Some dredging work had been done at the mouth of the river, for a price of $100, by a Jas. Wheeler, which permitted ready crossing of the bar by boats. The contract for this work was let by the Klamath Falls Chamber of Commerce. The plan was to establish a landing at the point reached by Mazama, through which would travel all traffic between Klamath Falls and Fort Klamath, as well as tourist traffic to and from Crater Lake. By mid-August 1908, low water in the Wood River made it likely that Mazama would have to suspend its run to Agency Landing. Operation of the Mazama in the river stirred up the sand on the river bottom, which washed downstream and formed a bar at the river mouth, making it difficult for a larger vessel to pass. The bar had been removed several times, but it kept building up again. With the water low, Captain Parker of Mazama planned to use a launch on the Wood River instead of the larger steamer. Capsized in squall On October 11, 1908, while towing a barge around Eagle Point, Mazama was struck by a sudden gust of wind, which capsized the boat. General weather conditions were not stormy at the time. This was in the same area that a high wind had blown over the larger steamer Winema the previous year, 1907. There was no loss of life among the five or six men who were on board Mazama, as they were able to reach safety on board the barge. Most of the freight also was saved. Mazama lay in six to eight feet of water. M.F. \\"Cap\\" Parker the boat's owner proceeded to the scene immediately to make efforts to raise the boat. The first report of the incident stated that \\"little trouble is anticipated in raising\\" the vessel. Sunk at mooring On December 24, 1910, Mazama reached the landing for Fort Klamath, on the Wood River with a barge loaded with freight in tow. The boat was left overnight anchored in the river, while the crew left to celebrate Christmas. The next day, Captain Parker found the boat had sunk in about six feet of water. There had been a collision between the barge and the steamer, which left a hole in the boat's hull, causing it to flood. Plans were made to raise the Mazama. Reconstruction In February 1912, Mazama was overhauled and a new hull was constructed for the vessel. The work was done by boat builder I.R. McDonald. The rebuilt boat would be 63 feet long, with a beam (width) of 13 feet, and a maximum carrying capacity of 25 tons of cargo, although 15 tons would be the more usual load. On May 11, 1912, the new hull was reported to be \\"practically completed\\" and that the boat's owners, Parker and Taylor were in the process of installing the machinery from the old boat into the new one. It was thought that the old hull would be converted into a houseboat. The rebuilt boat was expected to be complete within the next week. The rebuilt steamer was reported to have greater cargo capacity, so that the use of a barge would no longer be necessary. The vessel's speed was estimated to be about ten miles per hour. Passenger accommodations were also included, and the vessel was reportedly better constructed and much safer. While the steamer was undergoing reconstruction, freight had accumulated at the company's dock awaiting transport to various points around the lake. Mazama would run up the Wood River to the Wood (or Weed) Bridge, which was about 4 miles from Fort Klamath. By 1912, a good road had been built between the steamer landing and Fort Klamath. Stranded by diversion of river water In November 1912, Mazama became stranded in the Wood River, when as a result of poorly constructed irrigation canal, most of the water in the river was diverted into the canal, flooding the surrounding area, and leaving insufficient water in the river for Mazama to navigate. The level of the river water was only a few inches, and the steamer would be stranded until the breach in the river bank caused by the diversion could be repaired. Sufficient depth of water would still have to be accumulated in the river to float the Mazama, and it was reported that this could be done by a temporary dam of sandbags, which would require construction of a substantial embankment. This was anticipated to be expensive. In the fall of 1914, Mazama was caught in the ice on Wood River, and was unable to return to Klamath Falls. Mazama was not able to return to Klamath Falls until March 17, 1915. Disposition Advertisement for the sale of Mazama and two barges, for $600, placed March 3, 1919. Mazama became the sole property of J.B.C. Taylor in 1918. The second Mazama, although larger than the original, still used the same engines, and was therefore slower, and reportedly \\"never satisfactory\\". Mazama‚Äôs operations were terminated when the Southern Pacific Railroad reached Chiloquin, Oregon, as the steamer could not compete with the rates charged for rail transport. On March 13, 1919, the steamer Mazama was advertised for sale, together with two barges, one 16 by 60 feet, the other 14 by 40 feet, for a total price of $600. Mazama was dismantled at some time, after which the hulk lay in the tule reeds for years.

They can be free-living or symbionts of leguminous plants in root nodules. S.medicae was first isolated from root nodules on plants in the genus Medicago. Some strains of S.medicae, like WSM419, are aerobic. They are chemoorganotrophic mesophiles that prefer temperatures around 28 ¬∞C. In addition to their primary genome, these organisms also have three known plasmids, sized 1,570,951 bp, 1,245,408 bp and 219,313 bp. Colonies of Sinorhiozbium medicae are mucoid and ring-shaped and can be viewed here. Phylogeny/Taxonomy The genus is sometimes referred to as Ensifer (the older term) instead of Sinorhizobium. Two major subgroups include S.medicae strain A321 and S. medicae strain WSM419. this phylogenetic tree shows relatedness to the rest of the Rhizobiaceae family based on 16s rRNA gene sequences. Ecological role and symbiosis with legumes This bacterium is often involved in mutualistic relationships with legumes. It performs atmospheric nitrogen fixation for the plants and in exchange it receives organic carbon through the process of rhizodeposition. Free-living bacteria become housed inside specialized root cells in root nodules, which creates anaerobic microhabitat in which efficient N-fixation can occur. This mutualism has been observed with many plant species, including Medicago polymorpha and Medicago truncatula plants from around the world. The extent of the mutualism may be dependent upon soil pH, as it was thought that acidity can constrain Sinorhizobium medicae. Current thinking is that acid resistance, particularly in strain WSM419, can be transferred on plasmids. Agricultural Importance Because S. medicae associates well with plants in the genus Medicago and increases plants growth, crop fields are commonly inoculated with the bacteria in addition to or in replacement of synthetic fertilizers.

During the Spanish Civil War he was the main architect of the Soviet-style New Economy. He went into exile after the war and lived the remainder of his life in Mexico. Early years (1889‚Äì1936) Estanislau Ruiz Ponsetti was born in Mah√≥n, Menorca, on 23 June 1889. He studied Exact Sciences and Engineering at the University of Barcelona. He obtained a BA in 1911 and taught geometry at the University of Barcelona in 1912‚Äì14. He graduated as an industrial engineer in 1915. He co-founded the Riera i Ruiz company in 1917, and became a director. In 1920 he was one of the founders of the General Union of Technicians of Catalonia (Sindicato General de T√©cnicos de Catalu√±a), a member of the Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores (UGT). Ruiz joined the Socialist Union of Catalonia (Uni√≥ Socialista de Catalunya). He was elected as a deputy to the Parliament of Catalonia in the November 1932 elections.

He said, Ruiz was under secretary of the economy in the Generalitat from August 1937 until 1939. He was chairman of the board of the Industrial and Commercial Credit Fund. In 1937 he became director of the School of Labor in Barcelona. Later career (1939‚Äì67) Ruiz went into exile after the defeat of the Republican side in the civil war.

He was educated at Clayesmore School in Blandford, Dorset. His brother Flying Officer Malcolm Cedric Hayes, also died on service in World War II. Pre-war activities Before the war Hayes went to Mariehamn in Finland and signed onto the windjammer Pommern on which he sailed round the world via Cape Horn and Australia. This sea-faring experience was put to good use during his military career. Wartime activities Hayes was the third founding member of the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF), a unit formed around a small group of commandos under the command of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The commandos were formed in 1940 by order of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who called for specially trained troops who would \\"develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\\", and by 1943 had become lightly equipped assault infantry specialising in spearheading amphibious landings.  Operation Postmaster  The objective of Operation Postmaster was to board three Italian and German ships in the harbour on the Spanish island of Fernando Po, now known as Bioko, off West Africa and sail them to Lagos in Nigeria. The SSRF successfully captured the ships: Duchessa d‚ÄôAosta, an Italian 8,500 ton Merchant vessel; Likomba, a large German tug boat; and Bibundi, a diesel-powered barge. Following the operation Hayes was awarded the Military Cross.  Operation Aquatint  Operation Aquatint was planned for a night in mid September 1942 as a reconnaissance mission near Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes, a small coastal town near Port en Bessin in Normandy. The mission was to collect information about the surrounding area, and take a German guard prisoner. After the mission and on their way back to the beach to rejoin the Motor Torpedo Boat which had dropped them off, the SSRF commandos were fired on by a German patrol with machine guns and hand grenades. They attempted to swim out to the MTB which by now had also been discovered and was under fire and, unable to locate it in the darkness, were forced to swim back to the beach. Hayes came ashore beside Asnieres-en-Bessin and was one of only four members of the 11-man team to escape. He managed to evade capture and made contact with a local French family who provided him with civilian clothing and contacted the French resistance. He was taken by train to Lisieux and after several weeks reached Paris, and was then moved along an escape line to the Spanish border, arriving in October 1942. After crossing into Spain he was stopped by Spanish border guards who handed him over to the Germans, and it is believed he had been betrayed by French double agent Jean-Louis Ortet, codename \\"Armand\\".If I Must Die... : From \\"Postmaster\\" to \\"Aquatint\\" : G√©rard Fournier and Andr√© Heintz, OREP Editions, 2006.

It arrived just months after the group's hit single, \\"Talk Talk\\", propelled to number 15 on the national charts. Although the album was hastily recorded to capitalize on the Music Machine's popularity, (Turn On) The Music Machine managed to become a moderate hit on the Billboard 200, and is hailed today as a classic garage rock piece. Another single, \\"The People in Me\\" was also released in support of the album. Background Fronted by their innovative songwriter and lead vocalist Sean Bonniwell, the Music Machine became a radio favorite as a result of their rebellious proto-punk song \\"Talk Talk\\", which reached number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 in mid-1966. \\"Talk Talk\\", along with the B-side \\"Come on In\\", was rigorously rehearsed by the group under the instruction of Bonniwell, who held a virtue to perfecting a uniquely hard-edged sound for the band. By the time the Music Machine entered RCA Studios to record the two songs, they were well-practiced and completed them in only a few takes. Hoping to capitalize on the band's sudden success, their record label Original Sound hastily summoned the members back into the studio to record for (Turn On) The Music Machine. The album includes five cover versions -- \\"Cherry, Cherry\\", \\"Taxman\\", \\"See See Rider\\", \\"96 Tears\\", and \\"Hey Joe\\"‚Äîthat were recorded for a local dance club in Los Angeles called 9th Street West, but were never intended to be featured on (Turn On) The Music Machine. However, the group's record producers insisted that the songs would improve record sales, a decision that Bonniwell recalled made him feel \\"artistically crest-fallen and infuriated\\". Still, Bonniwell regarded the Music Machine's arrangement of \\"Hey Joe\\" as innovative, invoking a slow, moody nuance that is strikingly similar to Jimi Hendrix's more well-known version. All of the remaining tracks were penned by Bonniwell, including the melodically complex \\"Trouble\\", the reflective ballad \\"Some Other Drum\\", which hinted at the musical direction the group would later take, and \\"Wrong\\", a song written in a similar style to \\"Talk Talk\\". Perhaps the most accomplished piece other than \\"Talk Talk\\" is \\"Masculine Intuition\\". Bonniwell explained the song is \\"very tricky for non-musicians. They really can't quite figure out what it is...I've had other musicians tell me, their bands have tried to play that song, and they can't. There's two sections--it's called a turnaround, and I invert two chords. And if you don't pick up on it, there's no way you can play the song\\". (Turn On) The Music Machine was released on December 31, 1966 and reached number 76 on the Billboard 200. The Music Machine's second single from the album, \\"The People in Me\\", was distributed in January 1967, and managed to chart at number 66. Over the years, the album has been considered a garage rock classic, with Guitar magazine ranking it at number three in its category of \\"100 Essential Garage Rock Albums\\". Music historian Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, gathers that (Turn On) The Music Machine is highlighted by Bonniwell's original material, and \\"would have been a lot better if they'd let Sean Bonniwell write all of the songs\\". Critic Doug Sheppard praised Bonniwell's lyrical style, saying it \\"transcends the typical boy-girl theme of the day by instead favoring more introspective, psychological matter\\". In his article The Psychedelic Experience, Brian Hogg wrote the album \\"naturally features the group's hit single, as well as its flipside, the moody 'Come on In'. But alongside these tracks were five equally excellent Sean Bonniwell originals, as well as five covers\\" that the author goes on to conclude were \\"all rather offbeat and idiosyncratic choices\\". In 1983, Big Beat Records reissued the album, and in 2006 its material was released on the record label's compilation album The Ultimate Turn On.

Built in 1768, this Cape-style house is believed to be the oldest surviving building in the town, and one of the oldest in the entire state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Harris House stands on the south side of Western Avenue (Vermont Route 9), just west of the Brattleboro Farmer's Market. It is a 1¬Ω-story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof, large central chimney, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. It is set close to the road, with the roof gable perpendicular to the street, and the main facade facing west. That facade is four bays wide, with a roughly centered entrance flanked by two sash windows on the left and one on the right. The street-facing facade is three bays wide, and the east side, which was originally the front of the house, is five bays wide, with the central doorway replaced by a window. The interior of the building retains original floors, finishes, and hardware. This house is reputed to have been built in 1768 (a date carved into one of its beams) by William Harris, a native of Holden, Massachusetts who was one of the first to settle the area that is now Brattleboro. The center-chimney plan Cape is a particularly rare building in Vermont, where most housing was built after the transition to smaller fireplaces and wood stoves. In the 1950s, this house was owned by Joseph Caruso, whose wife was a singer at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.

The scale was developed in 2010 by a team of experts on OCD led by Jonathan Abramowitz, PhD to improve upon existing OCD measures and advance the assessment and understanding of OCD. The DOCS contains four subscales (corresponding to the four symptom dimensions) that have been shown to have good reliability, validity, diagnostic sensitivity, and sensitivity to treatment effects in a variety of settings cross-culturally and in different languages. As such, the DOCS meets the needs of clinicians and researchers who wish to measure current OCD symptoms or assess changes in symptoms over time (e.g., over the course of treatment).  Rationale  The DOCS was developed primarily because of the need for a measure of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms that maps on to empirically established OC symptom dimensions (or \\"subtypes\\") in a conceptually consistent manner. Research consistently finds that OC symptoms distill into the following theme-based dimensions: * Contamination - Consisting of obsession about germs, illness, and disgust along with avoidance of contaminants and washing and cleaning (i.e., de-contamination) compulsive rituals. * Responsibility for harm or mistakes - Consisting of obsessional doubts and ideas of possibly having caused or failed to prevent harm, misfortune, bad luck (to oneself or others) along with checking and re- assurance seeking rituals. * Unacceptable thoughts - Consisting of recurrent, highly distressing repugnant obsessional thoughts, doubts, images, and ideas of \\"taboo\\" topics such as violence, immorality, sex, religion and blasphemy. These obsessions are typically accompanied by avoidance behavior as well as compulsive checking, repeating behaviors, mental rituals, and excessive re- assurance seeking. * Incompleteness - Obsessions involving not-just-right experiences and the sense of incompleteness or asymmetry, sometimes accompanied by the fear of causing harm or bad luck; and ordering/arranging and repeating rituals. A second aim of the DOCS was to address important drawbacks of widely used measures of OCD (such as the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale [YBOCS], Obsessive Compulsive Inventory [OCI and OCI-R] and Padua Inventory [PI and PI-R]). The limitations of these instruments include: * Bias toward assessing the most common OCD symptoms. OCD is a highly heterogeneous disorder with obsessions and compulsions that can take many forms and themes. Many OCD measures are weighted toward assessing the most common (quintessential) types of obsession and compulsions (e.g., contamination obsessions, washing/cleaning compulsions). Thus, all things being equal, individuals with the more common types of OCD symptoms (e.g., washing and checking) will receive higher scores than patients with other (less common but equally severe) types of symptoms (e.g., religious obsessions/scrupulosity). * Restricted conceptualization of severity. Most self-report OCD scales contain a one-dimensional assessment of severity. On some scales, for example, respondents simply rate their level of ‚Äúdistress‚Äù associated with various types of obsessions and compulsions. Research, however, shows that OCD symptom severity consists of multiple parameters such as distress, interference in functioning, and the frequency or duration of obsessions and compulsions * Assessment of obsessions separately from compulsions. Many OCD symptom measures assess obsessions separately from compulsions, thus treating these symptoms as disconnected clinical phenomena. Yet research shows that obsessions and compulsions are related to one another. Moreover, OCD symptoms occur along thematic dimensions (or subtypes) that include both obsessions and compulsive rituals. Thus, many measures do not provide clinicians and researchers with the proper conceptual framework for best understanding and treating OCD symptoms. * Failure to assess avoidance. Most OCD symptom measures do not capture avoidance behavior, which is a major symptom for many people with OCD. People with OCD who do not have many compulsions, for example, often have extensive avoidance patterns that contribute to the overall severity and interference in functioning associated with the disorder. * Inclusion of hoarding. Until recently, hoarding was considered (by many experts) as a symptom of OCD; yet it is now known to be a separate condition. Many OCD symptom measures include items that assess hoarding in their overall severity score. Thus, these instruments overestimate OCD symptom severity among individuals with hoarding behaviors. Accordingly, the DOCS: * assesses the severity of research-supported OCD symptom dimensions (excluding hoarding) in a conceptually consistent manner, * measures symptom severity as a function of multiple parameters, * includes an assessment of avoidance behavior, * assesses symptom severity independent of the number, range, or types of different obsessions and compulsions, and * is fairly brief and easy to administer in clinical and research settings with both clinical and nonclinical populations.  Development, scoring, and evaluation   Development  Items for the DOCS were generated on the basis of research on the dimensionality of OCD symptoms as well as on the parameters of OCD symptom severity. After writing an initial draft of scale items and instructions, the DOCS authors obtained feedback regarding the clarity, reading level, and relevance of these materials from a larger group of (a) experts on OCD, (b) experts on scale development, and (c) people with OCD. Following the incorporation of input from these groups, the final product was a self-report instrument consisting of 20 items; five items for each of the four symptom dimensions (subscales) as described above: (a) contamination, (b) responsibility for harm, injury, or bad luck, (c) unacceptable obsessional thoughts, and (d) symmetry, completeness, and exactness. Hoarding was excluded for the reasons mentioned previously. DOCS items were worded based on the research-supported idea that obsessions and compulsions are universal experiences, occurring in clinical and nonclinical individuals on a continuum of severity. This allows the DOCS to be viable in both clinical and nonclinical populations. An analysis of the item reading level revealed that the DOCS is easily understandable for people aged 13‚Äì15 years and above or who read at about a 9th-grade level.  Administration and scoring  Each of the four DOCS subscales begins with a general description and broad inclusive examples of the obsessions and compulsions within the particular symptom dimension. Respondents are next asked to consider any obsessions and compulsions within that symptom dimension that they have experienced within the last month and rate (on a scale from 0 [no symptoms] to 4 [extreme symptoms]) (a) the time occupied by obsessions and compulsions, (b) avoidance behavior, (c) associated distress, (d) functional interference, and (e) difficulty disregarding the obsessions and refraining from the compulsions. Thus, the DOCS subscales assesses the severity of the patient's own symptoms, rather than pre-defined symptoms as in most OCD measures. Within each subscale, the five item scores are summed to produce a subscale score (range = 0-20). The four subscale scores can be summed to produce an overall DOCS total score (range = 0-80). A DOCS total score of 18 optimally distinguishes between someone with OCD and someone without a psychiatric diagnosis; while a score of 21 optimally distinguishes between someone with OCD and someone with an anxiety disorder. As of this time, there are no empirically derived cutoff scores for mild, moderate, or severe OCD symptoms.  Psychometric evaluation  In the initial study describing the development and evaluation of the DOCS, the instrument's factorial validity was supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of 3 samples, including (a) individuals with OCD, (b) those with other anxiety disorders, and (c) non treatment-seeking individuals. Scores on the DOCS displayed excellent performance on indices of reliability (test-retest, internal consistency) and validity (convergent, divergent, construct), and the measure appears to be sensitive to treatment. The DOCS is also diagnostically sensitive and thus holds promise as a useful measure of OCD symptoms in clinical and research settings. The factor structure and psychometric properties of the DOCS have been examined in numerous studies in different cultures and languages, and via different methods of administration. Largely, these studies indicate that the scale's properties are consistent cross-culturally and regardless of how it is administered.  Uses and translations   Uses  As the DOCS was developed with both clinical and non-clinical samples, it is suitable for use in service delivery settings as well as in research with both treatment- seeking and non-treatment-seeking samples. As it was developed and tested using adults, the DOCS is suitable for individuals age 18 and up. A version for those under 18 is currently in development. As a self-report instrument, the DOCS requires no special skills to administer. However, interpretation of scores should be carried out by individuals with appropriate training in psychological science. When it is administered to people who have sought professional help, or who are displaying high levels of distress, interpretation should be carried out by appropriately qualified professionals such as a clinical psychologist. The DOCS is widely used in clinical research on the nature of obsessions and compulsions. It is also used in treatment outcome studies as a measure to evaluate the effects of treatment for OCD.

We also needed to be sure each artist could address a site that is so rich historically but also challenging, with restrictions around issues of historical preservation and harshness of climate. The resulting exhibition contains works in a wide variety of media ‚Äî photography, videography, sound, and both found and fabricated objects,‚Äù Sheryl Haines said of the exhibition.  Presidio Habitats  ‚ÄúThe first site-based art exhibition in a U.S. National Park, Presidio Habitats began in mid-2009, when more than two dozen artists, designers and architects were asked to design habitat sculptures for selected ‚Äúanimal clients‚Äù of the Presidio. From 25 proposals, eleven were selected to be created and installed along Presidio trails and walkways.‚Äù  Mark Dion's \\"Marvelous Museum\\" at OMCA  http://museumca.org/exhibit/marvelous-museum-project-mark-dion  Richard Long's \\"The Path is the Place is the Line\\" at SFMOMA  https://www.sfmoma.org/press/release/sfmoma-presents-exhibition-in-varied- media-richar/  Cornelia Parker at YBCA  http://artdaily.com/news/15578/Cornelia-Parker-at-Yerba-Buena-Center#.VlS- TmSrSuU References  External links  http://www.for- site.org/about2/FOR-SITE%20Foundation-International%20Orange.pdf http://www.for-site.org/ http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/art/current- exhibits/biography-cheryl-haines.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ http://museumca.org/exhibit/marvelous-museum-project-mark-dion http://artdaily.com/news/15578/Cornelia-Parker-at-Yerba-Buena-Center#.VlS- TmSrSuU https://www.sfmoma.org/press/release/sfmoma-presents-exhibition-in- varied-media-richar/ http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2014/09/27/art-behind-bars-on- alcatraz-ai-weiwei-celebrates-the-silenced/ Non-profit organizations based in California ","title":"For-Site Foundation"},{"id":"48746141","text":"Edwin Vernon Morgan (February 22, 1865 ‚Äì April 16, 1934) was an American diplomat.Edwin V Morgan papers Peabody Essex Museum; accessed Dec 6 2015Find a Grave - Edwin V Morgan Find a Grave; accessed Dec 6 2015 Biography He was born in Aurora, New York on February 22, 1865.

By origin it was a pilgrimage song that initially was spread verbally in the 19th century, starting in the catholic Eichsfeld.  Versions  The earliest known printed version with seven stanzas was found in 1850 in the collection of hymns from August von Haxthausen and Dietrich Bocholtz-Asseburg. The actual origin of the song is unclear. Occasionally this song is dated in the 16th century, which at least may not be proved.August von Haxthausen, Dietrich Bocholtz-Asseburg (editor): Geistliche Volkslieder mit ihren urspr√ºnglichen Weisen gesammelt aus m√ºndlicher Tradition und seltenen alten Gesangb√ºchern. Paderborn 1850, S. 164‚Äì165. Zitiert nach der Onlinefassung im Historisch-Kritischen Liederlexikon des Deutschen Volksliedarchivs. However, in the Andernach hymnal of 1608 a song \\"Jesus and his mother tender\\" was printed with the note \\"to the tune of Maria went through this forest\\", in which sometimes a nucleus of this Advent song is suspected.Theo Mang, Sunhilt Mang (editor), Der Liederquell. Noetzel, Wilhelmshaven, 2007, , p. 1017‚Äì1018. It was the songbooks of the German Youth Movement at the beginning of the 20th century, that procured the song's popularity. On the other hand, this effectuated its transformation from the pilgrimage to the supposedly popular Advent hymn. In 1910, the song appeared in the well-known today three-stanza version initially published in the Jugenheimer Liederblatt. In 1912, the song was absorbed by the Zupfgeigenhansl and, in 1914, issued in the Songbook \\"Der Spielmann\\" created by Klemens Neumann, co-founder of the Catholic Quickborn Youth Movement. In the Gotteslob, the current common prayer- and hymnbook of Catholic dioceses in Germany, Austria, and South Tyrol, the song is edited with No 224. There is a choral setting of the carol in English, \\"Mary walked through a wood of thorn\\", by the composer Philip Radcliffe.  Content  The first three stanzas describing the walk of Mary with the child \\"under her heart\\" refer to the pericope of the visit of Mary to Elizabeth as recorded in the Gospel of Luke, . It is decorated with the motif of the dead thornwood, a symbol of fertility and death, which begins to bloom during pass of Mary with the divine child.

The series is published in Enterbrain's Harta magazine. Yen Press has licensed the series in North America. Plot In a fantasy world of dungeon exploration, guilds go out on expeditions to raid dungeons, hoping to find the mysterious Golden Kingdom claimed to be the treasure of a certain island dungeon. The story starts with a failed mission, where six members of a team try to take on a dragon, but end up escaping at the cost of losing a member to the dragon's stomach. After this, two team members leave to join another team, leaving only Laios (a human swordsman), Chilchuck (a halfling locksmith), and Marcille (an elven spellcaster) to grieve over Laios‚Äô sister, Falin (a human spellcaster). Feeling indebted to their close teammate Falin, who used magic to teleport the team outside to safety, the remainder of the team brainstorms how to get back to the dungeon level with the dragon in time to save Falin from digestion. Much like AD&D;, the team members must consider the cost of weapons, defense, recruitment fees for more team members, and food. With the majority of their supplies left behind in the dungeon, their mission seems impossible - until Laios suggests they sustain themselves by finding food inside the dungeon. (Laios has secretly wanted to eat dungeon monsters for a long time.) Chilchuck and Marcille are opposed to this plan, but Laios assures them by presenting a cookbook designed for it, and they head off. The first floor of the dungeon is filled with adventurers and is like a market, and this is where the team meets and joins Senshi, a dwarf who has 10 years of experience sustaining himself from the dungeon. The story then details their travels through the dungeon, the environments, traps, and monsters they encounter, and the meals they create. The pros and cons of these meals, characters' reactions to them, provide a running gag. Characters ; :A Tall-man who must venture deep into a dungeon to rescue his sister Falin before she is digested by the red dragon that defeated his party. Laios is a very strong fighter and the leader of the party. He is a very calm and gentle person who is excited to try different monster meals. He often uses the knowledge gained from cooking monsters to develop techniques to defeat them. He tends to speak very quickly when excited. ; :An elven magician who fights with magic cast from a tall wooden staff. She is a cautious, mildly unconfident person who is usually hesitant and even sometimes unwilling to eat monster. She is an original member of Laios‚Äô party. ; :A halfling locksmith with good dexterity and keen senses. Chilchuck disables traps, finds hidden pathways, pickpockets, etc. for the group. He is a fairly calm and laid back person, but doesn‚Äôt like it when other people take over his job or take dangerous risks. He avoids combat as a rule but can use a bow and arrow. He is an original member of Laios‚Äô party. ; :A dwarf warrior who joins the party so he can fulfil his dream of cooking the red dragon Laios and his party have set out to kill. Senshi has an immense knowledge of the dungeon and the monsters within it, and is an expert chef. He typically fights with a large axe but always carries a pot and cooking utensils. He makes sure the party are well fed and have a balanced diet. ; :A human spellcaster and Laios' sister, who was eaten by a red dragon at the bottom of the dungeon after using her magic to teleport the rest of the party to safety. Laios and his party are on a journey to rescue and revive her before the month-long digestion cycle of the dragon ends and she can no longer be resurrected. ; :A mollusk monster from the 'living armor' monsters that now lives in the hilt of Laios' sword.

Its closure was announced in the Chronicle of Philanthropy in April 2014.  Origin  The NMI was started by the Effective Philanthropy Group at the Hewlett Foundation in 2006 with the goal that \\"by 2015, ten percent of individual philanthropic donations in the US (or $20 billion), would be influenced by meaningful, high- quality information about nonprofit organizations‚Äô performance.\\" Jacob Harold was the program officer responsible, and the Hewlett Foundation at the time was headed by Paul Brest.  Organizations funded  The NMI funded a number of charity evaluators including: * GiveWell, that was focused on finding the very best charities to donate to * Charity Navigator and Guidestar, that were focused more on rating large numbers of charities using clearly defined metrics * Philanthropedia, a platform for experts to rate charities * GreatNonprofits, a platform for people to share information about great charities Holden Karnofsky, co-founder and co-executive director of GiveWell, expressed gratitude to the NMI, saying that NMI's support of the organization was crucial in its first few years, when it was relatively unknown and the subject of unfavorable controversies. He also praised the NMI for their support despite differences in strategy and approach, and said that while the NMI often encouraged them to spread a wider net and collaborate more with other NMI grantees, they were never inappropriately pressured. Ken Berger, President of Charity Navigator, wrote a letter upon the closure of the NMI thanking the Hewlett Foundation for their generous support of Charity Navigator through their transition to version 3.0 of their product. Berger identified the Hewlett Foundation as the single biggest overall supporter of Charity Navigator.  Closure  In April 2014, an article the Chronicle of Philanthropy announced that the Hewlett Foundation was ending the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative. The Hewlett Foundation's decision was based on an internal re-evaluation of the project, motivated by two external pieces of information: * The Money For Good study conducted by Hope Consulting (paid for by the Hewlett Foundation) whose headline result was \\"few donors do research before they give, and those that do look to the nonprofit itself to provide simple information about efficiency and effectiveness.\\" * An external evaluation from Arabella Advisors whose results further convinced the Hewlett Foundation that their strategy was not working anywhere near as well as they hoped. The Hewlett Foundation also had some significant personnel changes over the time period: Jacob Harold left the Hewlett Foundation for GuideStar and was replaced by Lindsay Louise, while Paul Brest was replaced by Larry Kramer as President of the Hewlett Foundation. They said that these changes made it more logical for them to re-evaluate the strategy, but was not the reason for ending the program, since the external studies and evaluations that would lead to the program's closure had been initiated under the previous staff. The Hewlett Foundation also clarified that even though they had failed to met their own goals with the NMI, the organizations they funded, such as GiveWell, Charity Navigator, and GuideStar, had done a great job at meeting those organization's goals. Responding to the closure decision, Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell wrote that while the decision to shut down the program may have been the right one, GiveWell did not agree with the stated reasons for closure. Karnofsky argued that GiveWell's money moved in the years to come would alone more than justify the grand total of 12 million dollars spent on the NMI. This would be validated in the years to come: in 2014, GiveWell moved $13.0 million to its top charities from donors excluding Good Ventures, a multi-billion dollar foundation it works closely with. Jacob Harold, the program officer formerly responsible for NMI, who had since left for GuideStar, responded to Karnofsky's post, noting that the NMI's goals of reaching a large population were still worthwhile, and that its main problem may have been that it was too early for its time. Harold noted that he hoped to make the vision the NMI sought a reality through his work for GuideStar. He emphasized the importance of both quality and quantity, noting that GiveWell and the effective altruism movement it was part of might be too neglectful of the quantity goals that the NMI had.

On the occasion of a visit that Anne of Austria made on 10 April 1660 to the Santa Clara convent in Perpignan, Antigo asked for amnesty for exiled religious and she won Anne of Austria's favor. Thus, on May 25 of that year, Antig√≥ and her companions were able to return to the convent in Perpignan. Another one of her notable accomplishments was within the religious community during the French occupation in trying to maintain the language and culture within the community, in addition to ensuring Catholic fervor and local customs. In 1664, Antigo was named the new abbess. Accompanied by sister Coronado and the support of fifteen sisters, they asked the Pope to remove the convent of Franciscan obedience and place it on the authority of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Perpignan-Elne. One of the arguments for was that confessors could not receive confession in Catalan. She reformed the religious community, strictly enforcing adherence to the rules of order, and she maintained a strict convent life until her death. Antigo died on September 28, 1676, widely admired and revered, as evidenced by her grave, which became a place of pilgrimage locally. At least within the community, there was a willingness to pray to a woman who was already credited some miraculous actions.Conseil Gen√©ral des Piren√©es Orientales (2009).

It features roughly 1,200 monographs, including food-grade chemicals, processing aids, foods (such as vegetable oils, fructose, whey, and amino acids), flavoring agents, vitamins, and functional food ingredients (such as lycopene, olestra, and short chain fructooligosaccharides). The FCC also contains ingredients, such as sucrose and essential oils, that are not frequently found in other food additive standards resources. The FCC has been published since 1966. It provides essential criteria and analytical methods to authenticate and determine the quality of food ingredients. FCC standards are used as agreed standards between suppliers and manufacturers in ongoing purchasing and supply decisions and transactions. The United States Pharmacopoeial Convention acquired the FCC in 2006. The FCC is published every two years in print and online formats and is offered as a subscription that includes a main edition and intervening Supplements. The FCC has two primary sections: monographs and appendices. Monographs are listed alphabetically and typically cover a single ingredient. Monographs, where applicable, provide information about each ingredient, such as: *Chemical structure *Chemical formula *Molecular weight *INS Number *CAS Registry Number *Function *Definition *Packaging *Storage *Labeling requirements *IR spectra There are also several \\"family\\" monographs, which cover substance groups. These include \\"Enzyme Preparations,\\" \\"Food Starch,\\" and \\"Spice Oleoresins.\\" Additionally, specifications are included, consisting of a series of tests, procedures for the tests, and acceptance criteria. Monographs may also detail USP Reference Standards and/or other materials needed for test performance. The FCC's appendices contain step-by- step guidance for general physical and chemical tests, and apparatus use, as well as generally useful information, such as food ingredient good manufacturing practices.

International Journal of Innovation Management 17.01 (2013): They described the business model canvas as the \\"Most prominent... popular tool that makes it simple for practitioners to design business models in a creative session.\\" It is a visual chart with elements describing a firm's or product's value proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances. With contributions from 470 practitioners from 45 countries. It assists firms in aligning their activities by illustrating potential trade- offs. The nine \\"building blocks\\" of the business model design template that came to be called the Business Model Canvas were initially proposed in 2005 by Alexander Osterwalder based on his earlier work on business model ontology. See also: Since the release of Osterwalder's work around 2008, new canvases for specific niches have appeared.  Description  Formal descriptions of the business become the building blocks for its activities. Many different business conceptualizations exist; Osterwalder's 2004 thesis and coauthored 2010 book propose a single reference model based on the similarities of a wide range of business model conceptualizations. With his business model design template, an enterprise can easily describe its business model. Osterwalder's canvas has nine boxes; the name of each is given in bold below. Descriptions below are based largely on the 2010 book Business Model Generation. * Infrastructure ** Key Activities: The most important activities in executing a company's value proposition. An example for Bic, the pen manufacturer, would be creating an efficient supply chain to drive down costs. ** Key Resources: The resources that are necessary to create value for the customer. They are considered assets to a company that are needed to sustain and support the business. These resources could be human, financial, physical and intellectual. ** Partner Network: In order to optimize operations and reduce risks of a business model, organizations usually cultivate buyer-supplier relationships so they can focus on their core activity. Complementary business alliances also can be considered through joint ventures or strategic alliances between competitors or non-competitors. * Offering ** Value Propositions: The collection of products and services a business offers to meet the needs of its customers. According to Osterwalder (2004), a company's value proposition is what distinguishes it from its competitors. The value proposition provides value through various elements such as newness, performance, customization, \\"getting the job done\\", design, brand/status, price, cost reduction, risk reduction, accessibility, and convenience/usability. *** The value propositions may be: **** Quantitative ‚Äì price and efficiency **** Qualitative ‚Äì overall customer experience and outcome * Customers ** Customer Segments: To build an effective business model, a company must identify which customers it tries to serve. Various sets of customers can be segmented based on their different needs and attributes to ensure appropriate implementation of corporate strategy to meet the characteristics of selected groups of clients. The different types of customer segments include: *** Mass Market: There is no specific segmentation for a company that follows the Mass Market element as the organization displays a wide view of potential clients. e.g. Car *** Niche Market: Customer segmentation based on specialized needs and characteristics of its clients. e.g. Rolex *** Segmented: A company applies additional segmentation within existing customer segment. In the segmented situation, the business may further distinguish its clients based on gender, age, and/or income. *** Diversify: A business serves multiple customer segments with different needs and characteristics. *** Multi-Sided Platform / Market: For a smooth day-to-day business operation, some companies will serve mutually dependent customer segments. A credit card company will provide services to credit card holders while simultaneously assisting merchants who accept those credit cards. ** Channels: A company can deliver its value proposition to its targeted customers through different channels. Effective channels will distribute a company's value proposition in ways that are fast, efficient and cost-effective. An organization can reach its clients through its own channels (store front), partner channels (major distributors), or a combination of both. ** Customer Relationships: To ensure the survival and success of any businesses, companies must identify the type of relationship they want to create with their customer segments. That element should address three critical steps on a customers relationship: How the business will get new customers, how the business will keep customers purchasing or using its services and how the business will grow its revenue from its current customers. Various forms of customer relationships include: *** Personal Assistance: Assistance in a form of employee-customer interaction. Such assistance is performed during sales and/or after sales. *** Dedicated Personal Assistance: The most intimate and hands-on personal assistance in which a sales representative is assigned to handle all the needs and questions of a special set of clients. *** Self Service: The type of relationship that translates from the indirect interaction between the company and the clients. Here, an organization provides the tools needed for the customers to serve themselves easily and effectively. *** Automated Services: A system similar to self-service but more personalized as it has the ability to identify individual customers and their preferences. An example of this would be Amazon.com making book suggestions based on the characteristics of previous book purchases. *** Communities: Creating a community allows for direct interactions among different clients and the company. The community platform produces a scenario where knowledge can be shared and problems are solved between different clients. *** Co-creation: A personal relationship is created through the customer's direct input to the final outcome of the company's products/services. * Finances **Cost Structure: This describes the most important monetary consequences while operating under different business models. A company's DOC. ***Classes of Business Structures: ****Cost-Driven ‚Äì This business model focuses on minimizing all costs and having no frills. e.g. Low-cost airlines ****Value-Driven ‚Äì Less concerned with cost, this business model focuses on creating value for products and services. e.g. Louis Vuitton, Rolex ***Characteristics of Cost Structures: ****Fixed Costs ‚Äì Costs are unchanged across different applications. e.g. salary, rent ****Variable Costs ‚Äì Costs vary depending on the amount of production of goods or services. e.g. music festivals ****Economies of Scale ‚Äì Costs go down as the amount of goods are ordered or produced. ****Economies of Scope ‚Äì Costs go down due to incorporating other businesses which have a direct relation to the original product. **Revenue Streams: The way a company makes income from each customer segment. Several ways to generate a revenue stream: ***Asset Sale ‚Äì (the most common type) Selling ownership rights to a physical good. e.g. retail corporations ***Usage Fee ‚Äì Money generated from the use of a particular service. e.g. UPS ***Subscription Fees ‚Äì Revenue generated by selling access to a continuous service. e.g. Netflix ***Lending/Leasing/Renting ‚Äì Giving exclusive right to an asset for a particular period of time. e.g. Leasing a Car ***Licensing ‚Äì Revenue generated from charging for the use of a protected intellectual property. ***Brokerage Fees ‚Äì Revenue generated from an intermediate service between 2 parties. e.g. Broker selling a house for commission ***Advertising ‚Äì Revenue generated from charging fees for product advertising.  Application  The Business Model Canvas can be printed out on a large surface so groups of people can jointly start sketching and discussing business model elements with post-it note notes or board markers. It is a hands-on tool that fosters understanding, discussion, creativity, and analysis. It is distributed under a Creative Commons license from Strategyzer AG and can be used without any restrictions for modeling businesses. The Business Model Canvas is also available in web-based software format.  Alternative forms  The Business Model Canvas has been used and adapted to suit specific business scenarios and applications. Examples include: * Product/market fit * Supply chain * Cash flow * Internal communications *  Criticism  The Business Model Canvas has been characterized as static because it does not capture changes in strategy or the evolution of the model nor much detail about the interaction between the components and how this makes the model work. Some limits of the template are its focus on organizations and its consequent conceptual isolation from its environment, whether this is related to the industry structure or to stakeholders such as society and natural environment.

Early life Benjamin Moses Frankel was born to Julius and Lifshe Frankel, on September 15, 1897, in Peoria, IL, USA. Frankel is a descendant of Meir Katzenellenbogen. Frankel married Florence Koenigsberg, but never had any children together. Frankel had three brothers named Harry, Samuel, and Mendel Joseph, and two sisters named Gittel and Gertrude. Work Benjamin Frankel graduated with a rabbinical degree from Hebrew Union College and was officially ordained in 1923 at age 26. Edward Chauncey Baldwin, an English professor at the University of Illinois, lobbied Jewish businessmen in Chicago, specifically Rabbi Louis Mann, to hire a rabbi and establish Jewish life on the University of Illinois campus. Frankel was appointed as the first part-time rabbi at Temple Sinai in Champaign, IL, as well as the first director of the campus ministry. He named the organization after the sage, Hillel, as a symbol of lifelong Jewish learning and pluralism. Frankel worked closely with a small group of Jewish students from the University of Illinois, many of whom struggled with balancing their two identities of being American and Jewish at the same time. They began by meeting formally, in a room above a barbershop in downtown Champaign. Even though Frankel and his students had a stable infrastructure, space, and a community-supported budget, over time, they realized that in order to sustain and expand their organization, they needed more support and resources, so Frankel reached out to B'nai B'rith for funding. Frankel convinced B'nai B'rith to adopt the organization in 1925. His fundraising efforts quickly developed the part-time student program into a full-time organization. It wasn't soon after that the University of Wisconsin (1924), the Ohio State University (1925), and the University of Michigan (1926) opened Hillels on their respective campuses, as well. End of life Frankel died of heart disease in 1927 at the age of 30. Mann took over Frankel's efforts until 1933. Over the next several decades, Hillel continued to grow, expanding to 200 colleges and universities including campuses in New York, Washington, D.C., Canada and Cuba. David Kinley, first department head of Economics at the University of Illinois and later President in 1920, was an acquaintance and brief colleague to Frankel. He wrote in the Daily Illini and Hillel Magazine on January 20, 1928, ‚ÄúWhile my acquaintance with Rabbi Frankel was not intimate, I had learned to have a high opinion and a warm regard for him. He impressed me as a man of fine ideals, religious fervor, and fired with zeal for the young people in his charge. His influence in the community was all for what he believed to be good. We shall miss that influence in our University Life. We shall miss his kindly greeting, his hearty hand clasp, his cheery and encouraging smile. We have lost a man.‚Äù -- David Kinley, President, University of Illinois. Legacy Hillel, the organization that Frankel started, became his main legacy. Today the organization exists on 550 campuses across the world. In May 2018, the Champaign city council voted in favor of giving an honorary street name to John Street, between 5th and 6th street on the University of Illinois campus. The segment of the street was named \\"Honorary Rabbi Ben Frankel Way\\" in August 2018.

His year-long tenure as Professor of Sacred Music at Oberlin College was the first-ever appointment of a professor of music at an American college. Ingersoll was born in Lee, Mass., September 20, 1804. His father was David Ingersoll, and his mother was Sarah Parsons, a granddaughter of theologian Jonathan Edwards. He graduated from Yale College in 1832. He studied for one year in the Auburn Theological Seminary, and for somewhat over a year in the Yale Divinity School, and was ordained as pastor of the Congregational Church in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, December 22, 1834. He left this charge in November, 1835, to accept a call to Oberlin College, where he spent nearly five years, in part engaged as professor of sacred music. In 1840 he removed to Michigan, with the purpose of founding there an institution similar to Oberlin; but the effects of the financial crisis of 1837 prevented the realization of his plan, and after thirteen years spent in home missionary work (chiefly at his own expense) in Michigan, he became pastor in May, 1853, of the Congregational Church in Bloomington, Illinois. In April, 1857, he resigned this position to go to Kansas in aid of the anti-slavery cause in the Kansas Territory. There he labored at his own charge in the work of the ministry, chiefly in the neighborhood of Burlingame, until 1861, when he returned to Illinois, supplying for a year the church in Elmwood, and then for five years the Congregational Church in Malden, which he left on account of health in the spring of 1868. He then returned to Kansas, to be near his children, and settled in Rosevale, now Springfield, Clay County, where he died March 29, 1887, in his 83rd year. He married April 29, 1835, Louisa, elder daughter of Frederick Perry, of Stockbridge, Mass., who died August 29, 1836, leaving an infant son.

It was the first battalion-sized operation waged by the Royal Lao Army against the communists in Military Region 4. Carried out between 21 and 26 June 1969, the assault interdicted Route 110 of the Sihanouk Trail for its planned three-day stoppage of military supplies. The Royalist guerrillas of Special Guerrilla Unit 2 then evaded an approaching counterattack and regrouped in friendly territory. Operation Left Jab had cleared the way for Operation Diamond Arrow. Overview Map of Southern Laos and the Ho Chi Minh Trail network. The Sihanouk Trail portion is limned in dark gold at the bottom of the map. Located in the southern panhandle of the territory of the Kingdom of Laos, the Ho Chi Minh Trail was the logistics backbone of the communist forces during the Second Indochina War, as it was the main supply route for Viet Cong and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces fighting in South Vietnam. At the southern end of the Ho Chi Trail was a dirt road, Route 110, and a surrounding network of logistical trails running into Cambodia that comprised the Sihanouk Trail. The Sihanouk Trail connected the Ho Chi Minh Trail with the deep water ocean port of Sihanoukville, the entry point for thousands of tons of communist war materiel.Tambini, pp. x ‚Äì xi.Knott, pp. 47 ‚Äì 48. From December 1966 through April 1969, over 21,000 tons of ordnance entered the Sihanouk Trail from the post of Sihanoukville; it was estimated there were sufficient crew-served weapons to equip 240 battalions, and small arms enough for 585 battalions.Ahern, p. 350 note 5. Operation Left Jab was the first of a number of military operations waged against the Trail in southern Laos, including missions such as Operation Maeng Da, Operation Honorable Dragon, and Operation Junction City Jr., that originated in Laos.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 222, 443.Nalty, p. 117. Operation Left Jab The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had trained the first Royalist Lao guerrilla battalions in Military Region 4 (MR 4) of Laos. One of them was selected to undertake MR 4's first battalion-sized operation; they were tasked to temporarily cut Route 110 and clog the logistic network of the Sihanouk Trail leading into Cambodia. A secondary mission was spotting targets for future air strikes. Staging out of Pakse Site 38 on 21 June 1969, 2 SGU Battalion (2 SGU) was helilifted southeastward into the offensive by a mixed fleet of 21st Special Operations Squadron and Air America helicopters. Accompanied by four A-1E Skyraiders for air cover, 2 SGU met no resistance at their landing zone on muddy Route 110. The 350 guerrillas settled in, laying defensive land mines. Only one feasible air target occurred, though, when a communist force of approximately 180 closed in on a Royalist road block. Tactical air strikes scattered that potential counterattack.Conboy, Morrison, p. 222.Castle, p. 118. Aftermath After cutting the communist supply lines between Cambodia, Laos and South Vietnam for three days, 2 SGU withdrew in the face of gathering PAVN forces. Their interdiction having diverted communist offensive pressure from the Royalist garrison at Attopeu, 2 SGU now evaded the PAVN and regrouped there on 26 June 1969. The successful Left Jab cleared the way for the Royalists to launch Operation Diamond Arrow. Notes References * Ahern, Thomas L. Jr. (2006), Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos.

Built in 1848‚Äì51, it is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Ormskirk, the archdeaconry of Warrington, and the diocese of Liverpool. The parish and benefice includes The Good Shepherd Mission, a tin chapel also located in Scarisbrick on Smithy Lane. History The township of Scarisbrick was originally part of the ecclesiastical parish of Ormskirk, and St Mark's Church was first built as a chapel of ease to the Church of St Peter and St Paul. A scheme to build the new church was initiated by the Reverend E. J. G. Hornby, vicar of Ormskirk (1846‚Äì1850), and land was provided by Charles Scarisbrick of Scarisbrick Hall. It was built in 1848‚Äì51 to a design by George Shaw of Saddleworth, and consecrated on 19 April 1853 by the Bishop of Chester. Scarisbrick became an independent parish on 14 December 1869, with the Reverend W. R. Ramsden as its first vicar. In 1878 the Marquis and Marchioness de Cast√©ja gave additional land to St Mark's in order to extend the churchyard and build a school. Enlargements to the church building were made in 1908 by William Edward Willink of Liverpool, with the addition of a new vestry and porch and various alterations to the interior. Description Exterior Located on the junction of Southport Road and Jacksmere Lane, St Mark's Church is constructed of a pale cream-grey sandstone sourced from the local quarry at Pinfold, and has a blue slate roof. The stone is rock-faced and coursed, with smooth finished dressings to the windows and doorways. Its plan consists of a nave with bellcote and two narrow paired lancet windows at the western gable end, and a lower chancel. The other windows are lancet style with buttresses in-between. The architectural style is c. 1300. Interior fittings A war memorial consists of two stained glass windows, each of two lights, and two associated plaques. The first window depicts Joshua and Cornelius, the second depicts Saint George and Saint Nicholas. The plaques are made of marble and commemorate 33 casualties of World War I and 11 casualties of World War II. An electronic organ was donated to the church in 1947. External features There is a boundary wall with lychgate made of the same stone as the main building. In the churchyard are nine Commonwealth War Graves belonging to soldiers of World War I and World War II. St Mark's parish hall, used for meetings and functions, was opened and dedicated by Bishop Flagg on 6 June 1986. Administration An active church in the Church of England, St Mark's is part of the diocese of Liverpool, which is in the Province of York. It is in the archdeaconry of Warrington and the deanery of Ormskirk. The vicar of Ormskirk is a patron. the priest in charge is the Reverend Eileen Heaney.

Common names by which it is known include annual ryegrass, a name also given to Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), rigid ryegrass, stiff darnel, Swiss ryegrass and Wimmera ryegrass. It is a native of southern Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent and is grown as a forage crop, particularly in Australia. Description Lolium rigidum is an annual grass that grows in open tussocks. It has fibrous roots and can grow up to a metre tall. The plant form is usually erect but may be prostrate. The stems are often geniculate (with a knee-like bend) and are purplish at the base. The leaves are long, and wide; the upper surface is glossy dark green, flat and hairless with longitudinal veins, and the underside is shiny and smooth. Annotated spikelet The young leaves are rolled when in bud, the auricles are small and the ligule is white and translucent, wider than it is long. The unbranched flower spike is up to long, with the spikelets on alternating sides and edgeways-on to the rachis (stem), pressed into recesses in the stem. The spikelets bear up to twelve florets, mostly with a single glume, with only the terminal floret having two. The glumes are up to three-quarters the length of the spikelet; their outer surface is finely ribbed with longitudinal veins. There is no awn, the lemma is oblong and has five nerves and the palea is a similar shape with two nerve and a few fine hairs. The three anthers are yellow. Distribution and habitat Lolium rigidum is a native of the Mediterranean area. Its natural range includes Western, Southern and Central Europe, northern Africa, the Near East, western Asia and the Indian sub-continent. It has spread to many other parts of the world and is considered invasive in some regions. It is planted in Australia as a forage crop but not usually in Europe. Ecology Lolium rigidum is a diploid grass with a chromosome number of n=7 (2n=14). It exhibits much genetic variability and grows readily in a variety of situations and habitats. It can hybridise with both perennial (L. perenne) and Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum), as well as some species of Festuca. It propagates solely by seed; freshly shed seed displays dormancy. It is sometimes infected by a rust fungus which has an inhibitory effect on the growth of clovers. The flower spike of L. rigidum may become infected by a certain species of bacteria, which results in the production of corynetoxins which are toxic to livestock; ingestion of infected material causes a disease, known as annual ryegrass toxicity or annual ryegrass staggers, which is known to occur in the west and south of Australia and in South Africa. The infection is caused by the bacterium Rathayibacter toxicus, which is introduced into the grass by the nematode Anguina funesta. This nematode causes galls on the grass flower spikes and it is in these that the bacteria multiply. Infected galls are present in the winter, but become more toxic as the inflorescence dies in spring. The disease occurs when the pasture is grazed at this toxic stage. Topping the pasture before grazing may prevent the condition, but the seed heads are still toxic when preserved as hay. The symptoms of poisoning are neurological, often causing a mortality rate of forty to fifty percent in infected animals. L. rigidum is susceptible to infection by ergot (Claviceps purpurea), and also by take-all fungus (Gaeumannomyces graminis) which can cause serious losses in cereal crops. Uses Lolium rigidum is grown as a forage crop in suitable areas. About 80% of the seed germinates in the autumn, soon after the first significant rains, and about 5% may remain dormant for twelve months. The plant has vigorous growth, and flowering is initiated when the day length is at least eight hours. This means that the crop has a relatively uniform flowering period in late winter/early spring. Because L. rigidum has been grown as a forage crop in southern Australia since the nineteenth century and seeds readily, it grows ubiquitously in the region with large, genetically diverse populations. Now that arable crops are increasingly been grown, it has become an important weed of these crops. Attempts to control it with herbicide have met with an unexpectedly high level of herbicide resistance. Over 90% of plants in some populations are tolerant to some of the widely used herbicides. Instead of wiping out the L. rigidum, the herbicides have resulted in the selection of resistant genotypes.

CompuServe contributions  Around 1980, Dunn discovered CompuServe, an early online service popular with owners of 8-bit microcomputers. He served as the sysop of CBIG, a special interest group for users of CompuServe's CB Simulator chat service, where he went by the handle \\"Chrisdos\\". Dunn was the author of MU, an unofficial menu and mail notification program that ran on CompuServe's DEC PDP servers. (By 1984, it was no longer possible for customers to install and run server-side programs; MU was the sole exception.) In 1985, Dunn authored CBterm/C64, a terminal emulator for the Commodore 64 noted for its ability to directly display CompuServe's RLE graphics.  Online dating  In 1982, Dunn met Pamela Jensen through the CB Simulator. At the time, the 26-year-old Dunn lived in Queens, where he dialled into CompuServe using a Heathkit CRT terminal and a Teletype Model 33. Jensen, whose handle \\"Zebra 3\\" was borrowed from Starsky & Hutch, was 30 years old and working in Chicago as an animal keeper at the Lincoln Park Zoo. The two soon hit it off and began exchanging private messages. They met in person for the first time on April 23, 1982, when Dunn flew to Chicago to attend a house party hosted by Jensen. Both were immediately smitten, and on their next visit, Dunn proposed. At the time, online dating was in its infancy, and the pair's online courtship caused a nationwide media sensation. The couple appeared on Good Morning America, The Phil Donahue Show, and 20/20, and were the subject of articles in several newspapers and magazines, including The New York Times. \\"Cupid and Computers Conquer All\\", a biographical article in The Chicago Tribune, was released on the AP wire and widely reprinted in the American and international press. The couple married in April 1983, a year after their first real-life meeting, in a small civil ceremony attended by three friends and five television news crews. Dunn left his job with a security firm in New York City and moved in with Pam in Chicago, where he became the technical operations manager of the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. Though commentators‚Äîincluding Dunn's father‚Äîwere initially sure that the marriage wouldn't last, the couple celebrated their 25th anniversary in 2008. Though Dunn and Jensen's online courtship was the first to receive widespread media coverage in the United States, the couple did not exchange vows electronically. Shortly before his own real-life wedding, however, Dunn attended what may have been the world's first online wedding, held on CompuServe's CB channel 14 for George \\"Mike\\" Stickles and Debbie \\"Silver\\" Fuhrman.

Mrs. Long was most widely known for undertaking humanitarian causes for over 25 years at the side of her third husband, Dr. John Long. Her previous marriage was to American diplomat and military officer William R. Rivkin, and she lived in diplomatic missions in Europe and Africa. Early life Helen Enid Hammerman was born March 23, 1930 in Chicago, Illinois, to a Jewish family, from Germany, Austria, Galicia, and Russia. Her mother, Cecilia Kagan, was a member of the Jewish-American Sarnatzky family and fled pogroms in Czarist Russia. Celia Kagan was a founder of the North Shore chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. Hammerman's father, Sol Hammerman, was the co-owner with his brother, Meyer Hammerman, of J.K. Industries in Chicago, a company founded by her grandfather. Sol and her Uncle Meyer turned the company into one of the nation's largest children's clothing manufacturers at the time. Growing up in Glencoe, Illinois, Helen Enid graduated from New Trier High School in 1948 and attended Sarah Lawrence College in New York State. Personal life In 1952, Helen Enid married John Dreyfus, who she had met in high school in Illinois. Together they had two daughters, Laura and Julia, before Dreyfus died in 1957. In 1959 she remarried to Chicago attorney and Democratic political organizer William R. Rivkin. When Rivkin was appointed ambassador to Luxembourg, Senegal, and The Gambia, Hammerman accompanied him abroad. Noted for her elegant and gracious manner, she spent 6 years by her husband's side on his appointments overseas. She had two sons with Rivkin, Robert Samuel in 1960 and Charles in 1962. When the senior Rivkin died in 1967, she relocated with her four children back to Chicago. In 1971, Hammerman married for the third time to Chicago obstetrician Dr. John S.

In addition to being a regular at Chicago Council on Foreign Relations lectures, in 1968 she established a prestigious foreign service award, the Rivkin Award, which she founded and named after her late second husband. The Rivkin Award is continued to this day by her children and administered in concert with the American Foreign Service Association. She was a graduate of Columbia College. When she later joined the college board of trustees, she became known as a persistent voice for students' concerns. In 1967, she hosted the WLS-TV show A.M. Chicago. From the 1970s until the 1990s, she and her husband helped to bring medical relief to remote regions in Peru, Africa, Thailand and Cambodia. They once narrowly escaped a guerrilla advance in the mountains of Peru, and in 1999 they were involved in relief efforts to Macedonia. She returned to college in 1971, earning a bachelor's in communications at Columbia in 1973. Passionate about the school's ability to train people for careers in the arts and media, she became a trustee there in 1979 and served on the board until her death.

It was designed by Arthur Malpas and built in 1924. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St Luke's Anglican Church on Boyne Island was erected in the early 1920s by the small farming community on the island. Boyne Island, on the Gladstone coastline, was taken up illegally for pastoral purposes in the mid-1850s, the first official lease being granted in 1863. In 1870 much of Boyne Island was resumed by the Queensland colonial government and opened to selection, and from the late 1870s agriculturalists cultivated fruit and small crops on the island. In 1884, half the remaining pastoral lease was resumed, and several farms were established on this land in the late 1880s and early 1890s. In the 1880s, a timber mill was erected on the southwest part of the island, and a wharf reserve was proclaimed near the mouth of the Boyne River. In the early 1900s, several more farms were taken up on Boyne Island or in its vicinity. At the time, Boyne Island was also a popular picnic destination for Gladstone residents and was used as a weekend retreat by townspeople. Around 1920, a small Saturday school was established on the island for the children of the farming community in a small shelter shed. Teachers came from Toolooa School or from Gladstone and church services are also said to have also been held regularly in a shelter across the road from the current church, which may well have been the same structure as that used for the school. The local families involved decided to build themselves a church. The land on which the church is situated was part of an agricultural selection granted in 1908 to Henry Richard Thompson. It changed hands several times before being purchased by Harry Handley in 1922. The Handley family were farmers and donated about an acre for the church, officially subdividing and transferring ownership of the land to the Anglican Diocese of Rockhampton in 1925. Funds for the construction were raised both locally and in England, and materials, labour and furnishings were supplied mostly by local residents. The building was designed by Boyne Island resident Arthur Malpas, who also helped in the construction. Reputedly, Mr Malpas drew inspiration from photo-album pictures of half-timbered cottages at Worcester, England. The construction method and materials used to produce the effect however, were not traditional but those available locally. St Luke's was dedicated on 12 October 1924 by Dr Philip Crick, the Bishop of Rockhampton. At the time coins and a newspaper were placed under the foundation stone. A large sea shell was utilised as a font. In the Interwar period, as cars became more common and with the construction of a traffic bridge over the Boyne River, Wild Cattle Beach (later Tannum Sands) became a popular holiday resort. The island's permanent population appears to have risen after the Second World War, and St Luke's Church served as Boyne Island's only school building from 27 January 1953 until the school was established in another building on 14 May 1956. In 1961 the church was rehallowed by Canon Donald Kinglake Dunn, coins and a newspaper of that year being added to the time capsule under the foundation stone. Items such as prayer books, vases, a wooden cross, communion cup and paten, pews, candle sticks and christening font were given in memory of the early residents of Boyne Island who established the church. Boyne Island has become urbanised following the establishment of the Boyne alumina smelter in 1982. During the construction period alone, the population increased from 1,400 to 6,000. Housing and public facilities have enormously increased on the island which is now effectively an industrial area. In the late 20th century, St Mark's Ministry Centre was erected adjacent to St Luke's, which now has the role of a church hall rather than a church and is used for church group meetings, Sunday School and worship on special occasions.  Description  St Luke's is a small church constructed in a simple, rustic style. It is timber-framed and clad with flat galvanised iron fixed with timber battens. The roof is gabled and clad with corrugated iron. The western entrance is sheltered by a small porch and there is a vestry with a separate gabled roof at the northeast end. The church has a seating capacity for 50 people. The frame of the building consists of exposed hardwood bush posts sunk into the ground and other hardwood framing. The exterior is painted a light colour with dark stained timber battens to provide a decorative effect suggestive of half-timbering. It has a cement floor, galvanised iron roof, timber doors and window frames. Louvred panels on the side walls of the nave do not appear to be original and all other windows are casements. The interior is plain and comprises a nave, chancel and attached vestry. The walls appear to be lined with fibrous cement, but the ceiling is unlined.  Heritage listing  St Luke's Anglican Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Luke's church is a simple chapel constructed in an idiosyncratic style using volunteer labour and locally obtained materials by the farming community on Boyne Island. It illustrates the resourcefulness of pioneer communities in providing for their needs with limited resources. The main economic activity on Boyne Island is now industrial following the establishment of alumina smelters in 1982, and so the church illustrates a way of life on the island which has passed. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The church in its setting has a picturesque appeal effected by an imaginative use of available materials to create the impression of a rustic chapel and makes an attractive visual contribution to the character of the area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The church has a strong connection with the Boyne Island community having been designed and built by pioneer families and has served the community as a church, school and meeting place since 1924.

He was the last major Tahirid to hold high office, having served as the governor of Baghdad at various points between 867 and 891.The dates of his governorships used here are derived from , supplemented by . , however, provides contradictory information, mentioning a first governorship of unspecified date, a second governorship lasting from 873 (when Muhammad ibn Tahir was captured by Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar) to 876 (when Muhammad was freed following the Battle of Dayr al-'Aqul), and a third governorship commencing in 879. Hamzah al- Isfahani's dates are at times used by modern authors, e.g. , and acknowledges the chronological issues, commenting that Ubaydallah was \\"three or possibly four times governor of Baghdad.\\"  Career  Ubaydallah was the son of Abdallah ibn Tahir, the governor of Khurasan from 828 to 845. During the civil war of 865‚Äì866 he was present in Baghdad, and throughout the siege of the city he served in a military capacity under his brother Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir, who as governor commanded the overall defense against the besiegers. At the end of the war, he was responsible for transferring the signet, cloak and scepter of the defeated caliph al-Musta'in (r. 862‚Äì866) to the victor al- Mu'tazz (r. 866‚Äì869). Upon Muhammad's death in November 867, Ubaydallah assumed the governorship of Baghdad as his brother's designated successor, and he quickly received formal confirmation from al-Mu'tazz. During his first term as governor, he was responsible for hunting down the sons of the Turkish officer Bugha al-Sharabi following the latter's execution in 868. Before long, however, he was beset by fiscal problems which made it difficult for him to pay the salaries of the troops in the city, and was eventually compelled to surrender the governorship to his brother Sulayman ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir in 869.; . Before resigning the governorship, he emptied the treasuries and collected taxes on immature crops, leaving Sulayman with a major shortage of funds. Ubaydallah is subsequently mentioned in the year 874 by al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 163, as being ordered by the central government to read a statement to pilgrims from several provinces that were present in Baghdad, declaring that Yaqub ibn al-Layth was not the legitimate governor of Khurasan. This account, which suggests that Ubaydallah was in a position of authority in Baghdad, might accord with , who claims that he was actually governor of the city at the time. Following Sulayman's death in late 879, Ubaydallah was again appointed as head of security (shurtah) in Baghdad, this time as deputy to the Saffarid Amr ibn al-Layth, who had been granted that position by the central government. He probably held the governorship until 885, when a reversal in caliphal policy toward the Saffarids resulted in 'Amr being formally dismissed from office. In August 889 he was restored to the shurtah following a rapprochement between the central government and 'Amr, but in 891 the Abbasid prince Abu al-Abbas ibn al-Muwaffaq (the future caliph al-Mu'tadid, r. 892‚Äì902) appointed his own page Badr al-Mu'tadidi to that position instead. During the reign of al-Mu'tadid Ubaydallah fell into a period of hardship, and in his last years he relied on financial assistance from prominent individuals such as al-Muktafi, Ibn al-Mu'tazz, and Ahmad and Ali of the Banu'l-Furat.; He died in Baghdad in May 913.  Culture  Aside from his political career, 'Ubdaydallah was renowned for his extensive cultural patronage and expertise, leading the historian Clifford Edmund Bosworth to call him \\"the most celebrated of his family in the literary and artistic fields.\\" He was considered to be proficient in adab literature, poetry, grammar, history, geometry, and music, and his skills in these fields were praised by authors such as Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani and al-Shabushti. As a musician he was known to have composed several melodies for prominent signers of the time, although he was too proud to openly take credit for his pieces and attributed them to a singing girl that he owned instead. He also enjoyed a longstanding relationship with the poet Ibn al-Rumi, and was one of the largest dedicatees of the latter's poetry.; ; Ubaydallah was the author of several works, although they are now believed to be lost. Among his writings were a book about poems and poets (Kitab al-ishara fi akhbar al-shi'r), a treatise on government (Risala fi al-siyasa al-mulukiyya), a collection of letters sent to him by the Abbasid prince and poet Ibn al-Mu'tazz, a book on melody and the background behind the composition of well-known songs (Kitab al-adab al- rafi'a), and a work on rhetoric (Kitab al-bara'a wa al-fasaha).

Sparta had won consecutive championships the previous three seasons with Bok de Korver, but when Ajax starlets Jan de Natris and Wim Gupffert scored three goals in three minutes, the crowd at Het Houten Stadion were jumping and chanting what would become the blueprint for this song.

The highlight of the whole project was the B√ºlow street, then one of the most beautiful and widest thoroughfare of the city. It comprised a dual carriageway starting from Dantziger strasse, running eastward.

The school was founded in 1904 on the initiative of Arnold Schattschneider and was originally located at Gda≈Ñska Street 24, (). The space in the building was soon too scarce, and decision was made to build a new edifice at Adam Mickiewicz Alley, using the opportunity of the urban development of the \\"Hempelscher Feldethe\\" area. Construction lasted from December 1905 to October 1906 when an opening concert took place for the opening of the new school premises. The building displays Art Nouveau style, using rich decorative forms. The facade is balanced with vertical and horizontal lines as well as balconies having each their own designed railing. The main entrance had two doors: one leading to the staircase to the conservatoroire, the other going to private spaces for the landlord and the school headmaster. Inside, the school housed classrooms, instruments, an extensive library and a concert hall with Neo-Baroque features. In the concert hall was organized symphonic concerts, chamber music events, concerts of students and monthly subscription concerts. In smaller venues were classes for piano, violin, cello and choral singing. Teachers of the conservatoire came from Vienna, Dresden, Regensburg, Prague, Rome, Moscow and Warsaw, classes comprised Germans and Poles. Wilhelm von Winterfeld, second director since 1914, had the school moved in the early 1930s to larger premises at Gda≈Ñska Street, 54Ksiƒôga Adresowa Miasta Bydgoszczy : 1936/37, p.XXV (from where it moved again to Gda≈Ñska Street 71 in 1939). The interiors of the building in Adam Mickiewicz Alley have been entirely rebuilt to turn classrooms and auditorium into flats. In 2002-2004 a major renovation of the facade has been carried out, giving back to the frontage its original design that had been lost since the postwar period.

She lectures in theology at Mardin Artuklu University. Biography Hidayet ≈ûefkatli Tuksal was born in 1963 in Ankara, Turkey to a Muslim family from the Balkans. In 1980 she enrolled in the theology faculty of Ankara University. She joined a religious order during her time there and started veiling. She received a PhD in Islamic theology from there. In 1994, Tuksal co-founded the Capital Women's Platform (Baskent Kadin Platform). The Platform challenged the religious basis of sexism and brought attention to the discrimination and injustice experienced by religious women in secular settings. Tuksal undertook postgraduate studies in philosophy at Middle East Technical University. After experiencing obstructions and attacks due to her headscarf, she was forced to abandon the university. She opened a clothing store with her sisters and mother after she was unable to find a job she enjoyed. Tuksal taught at an ƒ∞mam Hatip school for a time before enrolling in a doctoral program. Following the 1997 postmodern coup and February 28 process, headscarves were banned in Turkish educational institutions. Tuksal identified this as a women's issue, and related that women who wear headscarves were most adversely affected by the process. She noted that even some conservative Muslim and Islamist men did not consider women wearing headscarves in Islamist institutions to be presentable due to the prevalent Kemalist discourse. Tuksal identifies as a religious feminist. She has studied religious texts and challenged Islamist ideas that lead to the marginalization of women. She authored an academic study of gender bias in hadith in 2001. She has called for the resolution of contradictory assertions about the rights of women in the hadiths. Tuksal also wrote a history of Turkey's Islamist women's movement. She has noted the divide between Islamic and secular feminists in Turkey. Beginning in 2012, Tuksal was a columnist for the newspaper Taraf. Tuksal is married and has three children.

The aforementioned agreement had not materially changed since the organization was founded in 1901. Other important change was converting the NAPBL to more of a corporate structure than a political one, which prompted an intensively grown to the organization under his leadership.

It is also known as Carnym and Wyndhams Farm. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.  History  Although Boyne Island is best remembered for William Trevelyan Wyndham's association with it, initially the selection was taken up by Charles Hedley, a naturalist originating from Yorkshire. In 1882 Hedley and J.R.B. Dawson took up selection blocks on Boyne Island resumed under the 1868 Crown Lands Act. Hedley, enjoying a \\"liberal allowance\\" from his father, sampled outback life and tried an oyster lease at Moreton Bay before trying fruit growing at Boyne Island. In 1888 an accident to his left arm rendered him unfit for manual work and he went to Brisbane and worked for the Queensland Museum, pursuing a career in natural history, concentrating on Australian fauna. Hedley wrote confidently on a range of topics including botany, ethnology, and conchology. The culmination of his career was his appointment as Scientific Director of the Great Barrier Reef Committee. In 1888 William Trevelyan Wyndham acquired Hedley's selection of 240 acres in the south east corner of the Island near the mouth of the Boyne River. Migrating to Australia in 1849 Wyndham first lived with an uncle in the Hunter River area in New South Wales. His interest in Indigenous culture led to him to live with tribal Aborigines in New South Wales for seven years. He married, but after the financial failure of his farm and subsequent break-up of his marriage he came to the Fitzroy River area in Queensland in 1875 and lived by fishing and shooting, spending time with a tribe on Keppel Island. Wyndham worked industriously to improve and establish a large orchard on the Boyne Island property, naming it \\"Carnym\\", reported to be an Aboriginal name meaning \\"sand\\". Pineapples, grafted orange trees, bananas and rare plants and seeds were imported from Kew Gardens in England. Wyndham later sent Boyne Island- grown plants such as lilies, back to Kew. The seeds of the mango trees came by boat from India and were given to Wyndham by Hedley. Whether the tamarind trees were planted by Hedley or Wyndham is unclear. The section of property that fronted the river was known as Plum Tree, presumably after the native Burdekin plums which are plentiful in the nearby scrub. Wyndham's life as a fisherman made Carnym the ideal location, and he earned extra income delivering produce from his property to market through coastal waters to Gladstone. In 1889 he prepared a paper titled \\"The Aborigines of Australia\\". which he presented to the Royal Society of New South Wales in Sydney in June. Wyndham's paper applied chiefly to the Aborigines of northern New South Wales with whom he had with lived for seven years. He explained their traditions and customs and clearly stated their belief in a supreme being. Most importantly, his linguistic skills led him to the conclusion that the different Aboriginal languages had been derived from one original stock. That he was considered an authority is confirmed by the Smithsonian Society of America's correspondence with him on the possibility of Australian Aboriginal languages being derived from Tamil. Wyndham died 8 July 1898 and was buried in the orchard at Carnym. Some time later his daughter Bessie had his remains relocated on a hill at the Western end of the property. Wyndham himself had prepared in advance by transporting a block of granite estimated to weigh 1.5 tonnes from Magnetic Island and carried by his boat. This was dumped at the mouth of the Boyne River at high tide and later dragged by bullock team to the highest point on the island to become his headstone. The family association with Boyne Island continued for three generations, later members continuing to grow pineapples on the site, Bessie continuing to live at Carnym until 1941. In 1972 Comalco purchased the farm to build an aluminium smelter, production commencing ten years later. The site where the grave lies is owned by Comalco and is listed by them as a buffer zone between the smelter and the suburb. The area where Wyndham's house was situated was sold and subdivided in the mid 1970s and the modest weatherboard house demolished in the early 1980s. A park in the area bears his name, with tamarind and mango trees from the original orchard still adorning the park and surrounding suburb.  Description  Remaining orchard trees The heritage listing identifies two areas: the gravesite and the orchard. William Trevelyan Wyndham's gravesite lies in a small clearing amid native flora at the highest point of Boyne Island facing east (). The headstone consists of roughly hewn granite and local individual stones placed five feet in front of the grave in a rectangular shape. The stone reads \\"William Trevelyan Wyndham Born 3 April 1830 Died 8 July 1898\\". Nine mango (Mangifera indica) and two tamarind trees (Tamarind indicus) from Wyndham's original orchard are located throughout the suburb. Two tamarind trees are located in the corner of Wyndham Park near the southern boundary of the park at Olunda Street ().  Heritage listing  William Wyndham's gravesite and remnant orchard trees was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The remnant trees demonstrate the uncommon aspect of a nineteenth century orchard and garden that was used simultaneously for hobby, scientific and commercial reasons. The Tamarind trees have the potential to yield comparative botanical and genetic information with examples of a similar age in other countries. Prominently situated on the highest point of Boyne Island, Wyndham's grave is located in a small clearing, its aesthetic appeal enhanced by its surroundings amid indigenous flora. Two Tamarind trees from the original orchard are located in Wyndham park, their age and size contributing to the park's visual appeal. Wyndham Park is valued by the community for social and recreational purposes. Links to the former use of the site are expressed by a cottage style play structure symbolising Wyndham's dwelling, remnant Tamarind trees and the park bearing his name. Boyne Island has a special association with the work of William Trevelyan Wyndham and Charles Hedley, both principal pioneers in the early development of Central Queensland and the Calliope area. William Trevelyan Wyndham's gravesite and the Tamarind trees are physical links to his work and interests, in particular his association with and anthropological observations of the languages and customs of Aboriginal tribes in New South Wales and Central Queensland. The site is also significant in regards to the previous owner, naturalist Charles Hedley.

Founded in 1985, NASIG is registered in the state of New York as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. History The North American Serials Interest Group was founded in 1985 after a group of sixteen American librarians attended the 1984 UKSG (United Kingdom Serials Group) conference. One of those librarians, John Riddick from Central Michigan University, took the initiative to form a study group to investigate the feasibility of a North American counterpart. Riddick recruited Becky Lenzini from Faxon to work with him to market the concept of NASIG. They conducted a survey of interest and, in July 1985 held a well-attended and enthusiastic general information at the American Library Association conference in Chicago. Following this meeting, a site selection committee chose Bryn Mawr College to be the site of NASIG‚Äôs inaugural conference. An ad- hoc Executive Council was formed in late 1985 to provide temporary structure until the passage of bylaws and elections held. In January 1986, the group published its first issue of the NASIG Newsletter. The first elections were held in November 1986 and the bylaws were approved that same month. NASIG was incorporated in January 1988 in the State of New York as a non-profit organization under the name North American Serials Interest Group. Over time, the scope of NASIG expanded beyond serials to include all forms of electronic materials as continuing resources, and more recently, scholarly communications, including libraries as publishers and management of institutional repositories. In 2015, the membership elected to change the name to NASIG, and the legal name change in New York went through the same year. In 2014, after the death of Birdie MacLennan, NASIG became the new home for the SERIALST listserv. MacLennan worked at the University of Vermont, which had hosted the listserv for over twenty years. After MacLennan passed, the remaining moderators sought a new home for the list‚Äîpreferably one that was not tied to an individual‚Äôs employment‚Äîand with its historical focus on serials, NASIG was a good fit. NASIG‚Äôs physical archives have been hosted at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign since 2003. Conference The North American Serials Interest Group held its first annual conference in June 1986 at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. The NASIG conference has been held every year since in various locations in the US and Canada. Conferences are usually held in May or June, and have evolved from a focus on print serials to electronic journals to e-resources in general, more recently moving into scholarly communications. Originally, conferences were held on college campuses, with attendees staying in dormitories. The 2003 conference at Portland State University was the first conference with attendees staying in hotels, and all conference sessions were held on campus. In 2004, NASIG transitioned to housing the full conference in a hotel setting. Publications NASIG‚Äôs annual conference proceedings are published in the Serials Librarian (ISSN 0361-526X) as a double issue each year, with the conference presentation files available on SlideShare. In addition to the proceedings, NASIG publishes NASIG Newsletter (ISSN 1542-3417) on a quarterly basis. NASIG produces a variety of online material, including one blog with job announcements, another with news and announcements, and NASIGuides, short summaries of best practices and industry topics written by NASIG members. Professional Development NASIG works independently and in partnership with other organizations to provide professional development to members, students, and other professionals in the publishing industry and library community. Approximately four times per year, and sometimes in conjunction with National Information Standards Organization (NISO), NASIG hosts webinars on a variety of information resource management topics such as vendor negotiations, integrated library systems, FRBR, linked data, and the serials crisis. NASIG created a task force‚Äînow called the Student Outreach Committee‚Äîto work with library and information science programs accredited by the American Library Association. Serials is often not a topic of focus in many such programs, so NASIG created this sub-group to recruit and encourage future serials librarians. NASIG continues to supplement traditional librarian education with cutting-edge topics through its conference and webinars, in the areas of scholarly communication, serials, and electronic resources. NASIG annually confers numerous awards for professionals, paraprofessionals, and students within North America in order to assist with funding for attendance to the NASIG Annual Conference. In addition to the annual conference and webinars, NASIG also sponsors local conferences that relate to its mission. Core Competencies As the primary professional organization for serials and electronic resource librarians, NASIG has developed and published the Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians, the Core Competencies for Print Serials Management, and the Core Competencies for Scholarly Communication Librarians. These documents provide a basis both for creating job descriptions in serials, electronic resources, and scholarly communications and for creating library school curricula. They can also be used to define qualities needed by staff working in these areas, as a guide to train new and existing staff (in the case of a library-wide re-organization, for example), and to educate all library staff about the specialized skills needed to work with library resources. The core competencies were created in part by analyzing job advertisements for professional librarian positions and are based on the occurrence of specific descriptors in the responsibilities and qualifications sections of these job advertisements. The Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians focus and expand upon seven core elements: Life Cycle of E-Resources, Technology, Research and Assessment, Effective Communication, Supervising and Management, Trends and Professional Development, and Personal Qualities NASIG has also published Core Competencies for Print Serials Management, which came out of discussions about competencies for electronic resources and serials. The Core Competencies for Scholarly Communication Librarians include four themes common across scholarly communication roles: Background Knowledge, Technical Skills, Outreach and Instruction, and Team Building, as well as Personal Strengths. It also details five potential areas of emphasis to reflect the varying ways that scholarly communication is carried out at different institutions. Those areas are: Institutional Repository Management, Publishing Services, Copyright Services, Data Management Services, and Assessment and Impact Metrics.

The language uses flow-sensitive typing also known as \\"flow typing.\\" The Whiley project began in 2009 in response to the \\"Verifying Compiler Grand Challenge\\" put forward by Tony Hoare in 2003. The first public release of Whiley was in June, 2010. Primarily developed by David Pearce, Whiley is an open source project with contributions from a small community. The system has been used for student research projects and in teaching undergraduate classes. It was supported between 2012 and 2014 by the Royal Society of New Zealand's Marsden Fund. The Whiley compiler generates code for the Java virtual machine and can inter- operate with Java and other JVM based languages.  Overview  The goal of Whiley is to provide a realistic programming language where verification is used routinely and without thought. The idea of such a tool has a long history, but was strongly promoted in the early 2000s through Hoare's Verifying Compiler Grand Challenge. The purpose of this challenge was to spur new efforts to develop a verifying compiler, roughly described as follows: The primary purpose of such a tool is to improve software quality by ensuring a program meets a formal specification. Whiley follows many attempts to develop such tools, including notable efforts such as SPARK/Ada, ESC/Java, Spec#, Dafny, Why3, and Frama-C. Most previous attempts to develop a verifying compiler focused on extending existing programming languages with constructs for writing specifications. For example, ESC/Java and the Java Modeling Language add annotations for specifying preconditions and postconditions to Java. Likewise, Spec# and Frama-C add similar constructs to the C# and C programming languages. However, these languages are known to contain numerous features which pose difficult or insurmountable problems for verification. In contrast, the Whiley language was designed from scratch in an effort to avoid common pitfalls and make verification more tractable.  Features  The syntax of Whiley follows the general appearance of imperative or object- oriented languages. Indentation syntax is chosen over the use of braces to delineate statement blocks, given a strong resemblance to Python. However, the imperative look of Whiley is somewhat misleading as the language core is functional and pure. Whiley distinguishes a \`function\` (which is pure) from a \`method\` (which may have side-effects). This distinction is necessary as it allows functions to be used in specifications. A familiar set of primitive data types is available including \`bool\`, \`int\`, arrays (e.g. \`int[]\`) and records (e.g. \`{int x, int y}\`). However, unlike most programming languages the integer data type, \`int\`, is unbounded and does not correspond to a fixed- width representation such as 32-bit two's complement. Thus, an unconstrained integer in Whiley can take on any possible integer value, subject to the memory constraints of the host environment. This choice simplifies verification, as reasoning about modulo arithmetic is a known and hard problem. Compound objects (e.g. arrays or records) are not references to values on the heap as they are in languages such as Java or C# but, instead, are immutable values. Whiley takes an unusual approach to type checking referred to as \\"Flow Typing.\\" Variables can have different static types at different points in a function or method. Flow typing is similar to occurrence typing as found in Racket. To aid flow typing, Whiley supports union, intersection and negation types. Union types are comparable to sum types found in functional languages like Haskell but, in Whiley, they are not disjoint. Intersection and negation types are used in the context of flow typing to determine the type of a variable on the true and false branches of a runtime type test. For example, suppose a variable \`x\` of type \`T\` and a runtime type test \`x is S\`. On the true branch, the type of \`x\` becomes \`T & S\` whilst, on the false branch, it becomes \`T & !S\`. Whiley uses a structural rather than nominal type system. Modula-3, Go and Ceylon are examples of other languages which support structural typing in some form. Whiley supports reference lifetimes similar to those found in Rust. Lifetimes can be given when allocating new objects to indicate when they can be safely deallocated. References to such objects must then include lifetime identifier to prevent dangling references. Every method has an implicit lifetime referred to by \`this\`. A variable of type \`&this;:T\` represents a reference to an object of type \`T\` which is deallocated with the enclosing method. Subtyping between lifetimes is determined by the outlives relation. Thus, \`&l1;:T\` is a subtype of \`&l2;:T\` if lifetime \`l1\` statically outlives lifetime \`l2\`. A lifetime whose scope encloses another is said to outlive it. Lifetimes in Whiley differ from Rust in that they do not currently include a concept of ownership. Whiley has no built-in support for concurrency and no formal memory model to determine how reading/writing to shared mutable state should be interpreted.  Example  The following example illustrates many of the interesting features in Whiley, including the use of postconditions, loop invariants, type invariants, union types and flow typing. The function is intended to return the first index of an integer \`item\` in an array of integer \`items\`. If no such index exists, then \`null\` is returned. // Define the type of natural numbers type nat is (int x) where x >= 0 public function indexOf(int[] items, int item) -> (int|null index) // If int returned, element at this position matches item ensures index is int > items[index]  item // If int returned, element at this position is first match ensures index is int > no { i in 0 .. index items[i]  item } // If null returned, no element in items matches item ensures index is null > no { i in 0 .. |items items[i]  item }: // nat i = 0 // while i < |items// No element seen so far matches item where no { j in 0 .. i items[j]  item }: // if items[i]  item: return i i = i + 1 // return null In the above, the function's declared return type is given the union type \`int|null\` which indicates that either an \`int\` value is returned or \`null\` is returned. The function's postcondition is made of three \`ensures\` clauses, each of which describe different properties that must hold of the returned \`index\`. Flow typing is employed in these clauses through the runtime type test operator, \`is\`. For example, in the first \`ensures\` clause, the variable \`index\` is retyped from \`int|null\` to just \`int\` on the right-hand side of the implication operator (i.e. \`>\`). The above example also illustrates the use of an inductive loop invariant. The loop invariant must be shown to hold on entry to the loop, for any given iteration of the loop and when the loop exits. In this case, the loop invariant states what is known about the elements of the \`items\` examined so far ‚Äî namely, that none of them matches the given \`item\`. The loop invariant does not affect the meaning of the program and, in some sense, might be considered as unnecessary. However, the loop invariant is required to help the automated verifier using in the Whiley Compiler to prove this function meets its specification. The above example also defines the type \`nat\` with an appropriate type invariant. This type is used to declare variable \`i\` and indicate that it can never hold a negative value. In this case, the declaration prevents the need for an additional loop invariant of the form \`where i >= 0\` which would otherwise be necessary.  History  Whiley began in 2009 with the first public release, \`v0.2.27\` following in June 2010 and \`v0.3.0\` in September that year. The language has evolved slowly with numerous syntactical changes being made to- date. Versions prior \`v0.3.33\` supported first-class \`string\` and \`char\` data types, but these were removed in favour of representing strings as constrained \`int[]\` arrays. Likewise, versions prior to \`v0.3.35\` supported first-class set (e.g. \`{int}\`), dictionary (e.g. \`{int=>bool}\`) and resizeable list \`[int]\`), but these were dropped in favour of simple arrays (e.g. \`int[]\`). Perhaps most controversial was the removal of the \`real\` datatype in version \`v0.3.38\`. Many of these changes were motivated by a desire to simplify the language and make compiler development more manageable. Another important milestone in the evolution of Whiley came in version \`v0.3.40\` with the inclusion of reference lifetimes, developed by Sebastian Schweizer as part of his Master's Thesis at the University of Kaiserslautern.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built in 1904 by J Connors. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000.  History  Block B of the Gladstone Central State School was erected in 1904 as the first timber classroom extension to the Gladstone State School, established in the early 1860s. The town of Gladstone at Port Curtis was founded by the New South Wales colonial government in 1853-1854 prior to the separation of Queensland from New South Wales, and during the 1850s a number of private schools operated in the township. In 1861, following the separation of Queensland, a primary school was established at Gladstone under the provisions of the Queensland Government's Education Act of 1860, which provided government assistance for primary education modelled on the New South Wales system of national (or state-assisted) schools. At Separation in December 1859, there were only three national schools in Queensland (at Drayton, Warwick and Brisbane), established under New South Wales legislation. The first 7 national schools established in the new colony of Queensland opened in 1861. Among these was the Gladstone Primary School, which opened about April that year. The Gladstone Primary School initially may have occupied the premises of a former private school conducted from 1859 by JH Carvosso, who was appointed the first national school teacher in Gladstone in 1861. A purpose-designed primary school was constructed in 1863-1864 and opened at the beginning of 1864, on the present school reserve. It was a T-shaped brick structure. The front section of the building, facing Auckland Street, was the residence of the school master; behind this, at right angles to the residence, was a long school room to accommodate 70-80 students. Queensland's national school system, administered by the Board of General Education, was replaced in 1875 with a system of free, compulsory, secular education for children aged 6 to 12 years, administered by the Department of Public Instruction. At this time the Gladstone Primary School became the Gladstone State School. By 1879, average attendance at the school had reached 110, and classes were being conducted on the verandahs. To relieve the overcrowding, a separate teacher's residence was erected in 1880-81, and the front section of the 1863 building was remodelled as a classroom. By 1897, total enrolment was close to 200 and the average attendance had reached 150. The school was again in urgent need of additional classrooms. Extensions were approved by the Department of Public Instruction, but the local community was not able to raise the one-fifth contribution needed to fund the additions until 1904, when a new timber block was erected in front of the 1863 building, and connected to it by a covered walk-way. Tenders were called in March 1904. The contract was won by J Connors with a price of , and the building was completed by late 1904. Despite a number of modifications, it survives as the present Block B. In November 1913, the Gladstone State School Committee refused to spend any more money on repairs to the 1863 school building and requested that it be demolished and replaced with a new timber building in keeping with the 1904 wing (Block B). This building (Block A) was erected in 1914-15 and opened in February 1915. In 1917 the 1863 building was sold for for demolition/removal. By the mid-1930s, Block A had become the High School wing of the Gladstone State School, and two additional timber wings had been erected. One of these accommodated primary school children (Block C), and the other was the Infants School (Block D). In 1936/37 a purpose- designed home economics and manual arts wing was erected (Block E), but there was little further expansion of the school premises until well into the second half of the 20th century. Gladstone State School was renamed Gladstone Central State School on 14 November 1968. By March 1973, the school had acquired an additional large teaching block (Block G), an administration block (Block H), and a toilet block (Block J - replacing earlier earth closets). At this time plans were drawn for a new Block C, and it appears that the old Block C was removed to another part of the site, and renamed Block F. By 1978, Block A (the 1914-15 building) had been removed and the new Block C had been constructed, but Blocks B, F (the re-sited former Block C), D & E remained.  Description  Entrance to Block B, 1999 Situated on a sloping site in the northwest corner of the Gladstone Central State School grounds overlooking Auckland Street, Block B is a free-standing, single-storeyed timber building sitting on low concrete stumps to the east and north and higher concrete stumps to the west and south. The low-pitched gable roof is sheeted with polytex sheeting and has small triangular decorative panels of vertical slats to the north and south gable ends. The exterior is clad with painted weatherboards. The north and south elevations each have a bank of fourteen awning windows sheltered by a sunshade awning with lattice triangular panels to each end. The south elevation also contains a porch entrance to the east verandah and the north elevation contains two small windows to the west corner. The building is planned about a single room with lateral verandahs. The building has been altered but some original fabric remains including timber linings, doors and windows. The single room has been subdivided with concertina doors to form three rooms and partitioned spaces and enclosures added to the verandahs. A small, single-room, rectangular, gable-roofed annexe extends from the centre of the east verandah. Clad externally with weatherboards, the annexe has two casement windows to the north and east elevations and the ceiling and interior walls are lined with tongue-and-groove boarding with coved mouldings to the corners and cornice. The east verandah is enclosed and lined internally with tongue-and- groove boarding and coved mouldings to the corners and cornice. There is a bank of clerestorey louvres to the south of the annexe and three sets of clerestorey and six sets of half height louvres to the north. Rooms to the corners of the verandah have been partitioned with fibro cement sheeting. A plain timber door opens to the annexe. There is a porch entrance to the south and a plain timber door in the east wall to the north of the annexe. The west verandah is approached by a central set of timber stairs. The corners of the verandah have been enclosed to the north for toilets and to the south for a small kitchen. Both enclosed areas open to the verandah. There are four timber casement windows to the west in the south corner and three timber casements windows to the west in the north corner. The open middle portion of the verandah has a timber handrail and two horizontal midrails and a single stop chamfered verandah post at the top of the stair. The west verandah has exposed stud framing and is lined with chamfer boards. There are three sets of triple sash windows to the centre with timber doors to each side and an additional timber door near the north enclosure. There are tilting fanlights above all doors. The panel and sheeted French doors to north of the windows are stop chamfered to the interior. Tusk tenon joints to the framing of the windows and doors. The main room has a coved ceiling lined with tongue-and-groove boarding with coved corner mouldings and cornice and exposed timber truss bases. There are winding mechanisms for the tilting fanlights.  Heritage listing  Block B of Gladstone Central State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Block B is significant historically for its association with the important work of primary school education in Gladstone since the early 1900s, The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Block B has had a special association for generations of Gladstone residents as a place important in their personal histories.

It was built in circa 1510 CE by Malik Gopi, who was an affluent merchant and governor of Surat during the Mughal Empire. In 2012, the lake was renovated by Surat Municipal Corporation and the area surrounding it was redeveloped as a recreational facility. History Malik Gopi , a Brahmin merchant, settled in Surat and the development of the city has been attributed to his contributions. The area he developed was called Gopipura, in his honour and the king of Gujarat gave him the title of \\"Malik\\". The town that he developed was still unnamed and consulting astrologers he proposed to name it \\"Suraj\\" or \\"Suryapur\\". The king disliking the Hindu inclination of the name altered it to \\"Surat\\" (meaning headings of the chapters of the Quran). Gopi also finds mentions in Portuguese literature as \\"Lord of Surat and Bharuch\\". In 1573, Emperor Akbar had set up his military base camp near the lake during the siege of Surat. Sanskrit poet Vinayavijaya (1613‚Äì1681) in his poem \\"Indudutam\\" calls this lake a \\"fine art emerged from the churning of oceans.\\" The lake also finds mentions in travelogues of European visitors. British traveler Peter Mundy who arrived in Surat in September 1628 describes the lake as \\"the Great Tancke of Surat,\\" and \\"admirable for its workemannshipp and bignes\\". Dutch geographer Joannes de Laet's 1631 Latin works mention this lake to have been cut out of a rock. Johan Albrecht de Mandelslo, a German adventurer who landed in Surat in 1638 describes the vastness of the lake along with steps surrounding it and mentions the house that stood at the centre; wrongly calling it \\"the tomb of the builder of this magnificent structure\\". Portuguese Jesuit Manoel Godinho toured the Surat region in 1662‚Äì63 and mentions two wells outside the city used to supply drinking water and this is implied as a reference to two cisterns of the lake. The lake also finds mentions in the chronicles of Italian traveler Pietro della Valle as \\"Gopi Telau\\". Sir Thomas Herbert, who toured India on various occasions in 15th century, mentions the lake to have been used to hold rain water for drinking purpose. In 1666, French traveler Jean de Th√©venot in his writings notes the absence of restorations required for the lake. By 1674, the lake had been ignored and had turned dry turning to ruins by 1717. Further in the 20th century, the steps surrounding this dry lake made it look like a huge amphitheater.

It was built from 1928 to 1929. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000.  History  This two-storeyed masonry building was constructed in 1928-29 as banking offices and bank manager's residence for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and remained the Bank's principal Gladstone branch until February 1972. The federal government's Commonwealth Bank Act of 1911 established Australia's first bank empowered to conduct both savings and general (trading) bank business, with the security of a federal government guarantee. On 16 September 1912 the Savings Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank (later the Commonwealth Savings Bank) commenced business in Queensland. The new bank established a main office in Brisbane, and operated branches through the 194 post offices throughout Queensland which had been transferred to the Commonwealth after Federation, and which previously had acted as agencies for the (Queensland) Government Savings Bank (established in 1864 by act of Queensland Parliament). The Gladstone Post Office remained the Commonwealth Bank's representative in Gladstone until 1921. The Queensland Government Savings Bank had established a regional branch at Gladstone in June 1912 in rented premises on the eastern side of Goondoon Street, between Lord and Yarroon Streets, formerly occupied by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. In December 1920 the Queensland Government Savings Bank was absorbed by the Commonwealth Government Savings Bank, following which the Commonwealth Bank's Gladstone Post Office agency was closed and all business moved to the former Queensland Government Savings Bank's premises in Goondoon Street, opening there on 3 January 1921 as the Commonwealth Bank and providing full commercial and savings bank facilities. By the 1920s Gladstone's business heart was shifting south toward the Gladstone railway station, and the Commonwealth Bank decided to erect purpose-designed banking premises closer to the centre of business. In 1927 vacant land in Goondoon Street, between William and Roseberry Streets, was purchased for from J Friend. In 1928 plans were prepared by the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways for a substantial, two-storeyed \\"Spanish style\\" brick building, with ground floor banking chamber and upstairs manager's residence. The use of Mediterranean ('Spanish') style was in vogue for both domestic and commercial buildings in Australia and overseas at this period, and the Commonwealth Bank, like other financial institutions, was keen to reflect through its buildings a modern, progressive and reliable approach to successful money management. Other popular architectural styles favoured by the Bank at this period were stripped classical and moderne. Tenders were called in September 1928, and the job was let in November to local Gladstone contractor Mr FF Hill, with a tender price of and a completion date of 30 April 1929. This was extended to 17 August 1929, and the bank opened for business in September 1929. At the time of completion, the building was described as the finest banking chamber in Gladstone. Entrance to the new branch was through a small colonnade leading to a centrally located doorway into the banking chamber on the ground floor. The manager's office was located at the front, and the main counter, which housed three teller boxes, ran across the width of the banking chamber. Behind this were the strong room, staff facilities and store room. The manager's three bedroom residence was located on the upper level. During the Second World War the Gladstone branch of the Commonwealth Bank became heavily involved with Commonwealth Bonds and other forms of government fund-raising for the war effort, and was the local agent for the meat and clothing rationing authorities. During the late 1940s and 1950s, the Commonwealth Bank expanded its activities Australia-wide, opening hundreds of branches and agencies to cater for the increase and spread of population accompanying Australia's great post-war migrant influx, and reflecting the buoyant national economy of the 1950s. In December 1959 the Commonwealth Bank of Australia was restructured and renamed the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. In the 1960s and 1970s Gladstone entered a new period of prosperity with the establishment of an alumina refinery, an alumina smelter, a cement clinker plant, a huge regional power station, and three separate coal loading facilities. As early as 1970, the growth of business through the Commonwealth Banking Corporation's Gladstone office had increased to over 7,800 savings accounts and 800 cheque accounts, and the existing premises were proving inadequate for the conduct of bank business. In June 1970 a vacant site in Goondoon Street, directly opposite the 1928-29 building, was purchased, and larger bank offices were erected there in 1971-72. The new premises opened in February 1972, and the old premises were sold a month later. Conversion of the upper floor to offices necessitated the removal of most of the original internal partitioning on that floor. In 2015, the building is occupied by the Gladstone office of Santos Limited, an oil and gas company.  Description  The former Commonwealth Bank Building in Goondoon Street, Gladstone, is a two-storeyed brick and concrete building with sub-floor, located in what has been the heart of the city's commercial precinct since the 1920s. It is one of Gladstone's more substantial interwar commercial buildings, and is designed in a restrained Mediterranean style, with a colonnaded entry porch, arched windows, and a terracotta tiled roof. The plan of the building is typical of 19th and 20th century bank buildings with a banking chamber at ground floor level and a residence for the manager on the second floor level. The building is rectangular in plan, narrower across the street frontage than the depth, and is built up to the street alignment. It has been extended at the rear. It occupies approximately half of the block, with a bitumined carpark at the rear, accessed via a driveway off Goondoon Street along the north side of the building. There are several mature trees along the perimeter of the back yard, possibly related to the period of occupation of the first floor of the building as a bank manager's residence. The site slopes considerably to the rear (east) and to the south, accommodating a basement level with what was formerly a strongroom. The building has concrete foundations, staircase, verandah floors and strong room. The external and internal walls are rendered brickwork. Internally the floors are timber The terracotta tiled roof is pyramid-shaped, with wide-eaves. The principal facade of the building facing Goondoon Street has a central recessed entrance porch which leads to the banking chamber. A small flight of steps lead to the 3-arched colonnaded porch. Above the entrance porch the first-floor verandah, which mirrored the entrance porch, has been enclosed with glazing panels. Another first floor verandah on the southern side of the building has been enclosed with brickwork and a small row of windows. The symmetry of the street facade has been marred with the conversion of a window to the left of the front entrance into a doorway, to provide street access to the internal staircase leading to the upper floor. The original external side access has been enclosed. Most of the other external openings survive and retain their original joinery. The ground floor, which remains in use as a banking chamber, has undergone refurbishment - including the insertion of a false ceiling and air conditioning ducting. However the space remains substantially intact. The timber counter and teller boxes have been removed, but the fine entrance, manager's office and rear ancillary rooms remain, and the original function of this space can be understood. There is an internal staircase at the rear southeast corner leading to the basement, which also is accessed externally at ground level from the rear of the building. The first floor is reached via an internal and original timber staircase at the northwest corner of the building, which now is accessed only from the front street. The upper floor has been gutted and refurbished as office space not associated with the bank on the ground floor, hence the alterations to create a separate entrance. There is a set of external timber back stairs leading from the first floor to the back yard, at the original northeast corner of the building. There is a concrete block extension, two-storeyed with sub-floor, at the rear. This has necessitated little alteration to the main building, with the former rear external wall now an internal partition.  Heritage listing  The former Commonwealth Bank Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Commonwealth Bank Building, Gladstone, erected 1928-29, is important in illustrating the pattern of development of Gladstone as a regional centre. As one of a group of employment-generating public buildings erected in Gladstone during the interwar period, (including the 1932 Post Office, 1934 Town Council Chambers, and 1940-42 Court House), the former Commonwealth Bank Building is significant in illustrating the less negative impact of the interwar economic depression on regional Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The two-storeyed former banking premises remains sufficiently intact to illustrate the quality of interwar Commonwealth public works design; the exterior in particular still demonstrates the intention of the design to impress, and the building remains an integral component of the principal Gladstone streetscape. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The two-storeyed former banking premises remains sufficiently intact to illustrate the quality of interwar Commonwealth public works design; the exterior in particular still demonstrates the intention of the design to impress, and the building remains an integral component of the principal Gladstone streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a group, these buildings contributed significantly to the development of a 20th century image for Gladstone, and remain important public landmarks. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place is significant for its strong association with the work of the Commonwealth Bank in Gladstone over four decades (1929-1972), during which time the town sustained the deepest economic depression of the 20th century, survived the worst global conflict of the 20th century, and finally, entered the greatest period of prosperity since the founding of Gladstone in 1853-54.

In addition to the spicule, the female sex organs can be used to differentiate the two species. T. ovis females have everted vaginas, while those of T. discolor do not. Despite these morphological differences between the two species, there are still situations where the two species cannot be easily differentiated. Therefore, the mitochondrial DNA of both species was encoded. Results confirm that the two species are indeed distinct from each other. Symptoms and treatment Hosts are relatively resistant to Trichuris infections and rarely display any distinct symptoms. However, severe infections can result in severe diarrhea, anorexia, recumbency, dehydration, and weight loss. Adult whipworms primarily inhabit and feed on the mucosa of the cecum, which causes a thickening of the cecal wall. This prevents liquids from being absorbed, thus explaining the diarrhea. The main methods of diagnosing a host with a Trichuris infection are through fecal flotation, which detects eggs, and postmortem examination of the large intestine. Severe infections can be treated through anthelmintic medications, such as levamisole and methylridine.

It is located in the Central District, directly south-southeast of Central Park, near the core of the cultural and political life of the city. It is often called the City Garden by the populace rather than Central Square. Central Square is bounded by World Peace Street on the north, Central Street on the west, and Leningrad Street on the south. To the east is mixed terrain including parkland; Central Square itself is mixed terrain, including parkland, parking lots, buildings, and monuments. The entirety, which includes large stretches of bare asphalt and random structures, does not necessarily present a pleasing aspect or sense of unified design. Within Central Square itself is the Lada Star hotel (one of the older buildings in the square), a monument to the founders of the city done in an \\"old Russian\\" style, and a statue of Saint Nicholas the Miracle Worker. There is a small chapel, the Chapel of the Nativity of Christ, erected in 2000, designed in the old style with a golden dome and stained-glass windows. There are also restaurants, trees, and walking paths. Festivals and fairs are held in Central Square. The building where the Tolyatti City Duma (City Council) meets is directly west of Central Square, across Central Street.

The neo-classical building was constructed in 1976 in Soviet times; after various interim forms, the institution was converted in 2004 to an open joint-stock company. The Palace of Culture is one of the city's largest venue for plays and concerts. Musicals, holiday extravaganzas, and other shows are presented there. The Palace also hosts corporate events. The Palace also hosts vocal, dance and acting workshops for children; other child or family centered activities are a bowling alley, laser tag arena, and the Emerald City, a large indoor children's space featuring a carousel, giant bubble maker, slides and other play structures, and other attractions.

She was a member of the Cloud Gate Dance Theater, founded by Lin Hwai-min, between 1979 and 1994. Lin subsequently founded her own dance troupe, Taipei Crossover Dance Company, and led Cloud Gate 2 from 1999 to her death. Early life and education Lo was born in Taipei, though she and her family moved to Yilan three months after her birth. She had three older sisters, one of which is the singer, Sophie Lo, and one older brother. Lo, who began taking private dance lessons at age 5, joined Taiwan's Neo-Classic Dance Company in 1974 while a student at National Taiwan University. After she graduated from NTU with a degree in English literature, Lo spent a year in New York intending to further her studies in journalism and creative writing. Instead, she returned to Taiwan to join the Cloud Gate Dance Theater in 1979, becoming the lead dancer in White Serpent Tale, Cloud Gate's dance adaption of the Legend of the White Snake, the next year before leaving in 1982 for New York University, where she earned an MFA in dance. While in the United States, Lo appeared in multiple performances of The King and I with Yul Brynner and also studied at the Alvin Ailey School of American Dance, Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance, and the Jos√© Lim√≥n Dance School. Career She graduated from NYU in 1985, and began teaching at Taipei National University of the Arts that year. Lo was named dance department chair in 1992, and later led the graduate dance program at TNUA. She was responsible for launching the school's seven-year accelerated dance program, which develops talent in high school and places candidates into TNUA upon high school graduation. In 1994, she retired from performing with Cloud Gate and started the Taipei Crossover Dance Company with three other Cloud Gate dancers. Her first choreographic works were completed in the 1980s. This was followed by more work throughout the 1990s, including, The Place Where the Heart Is, City of the Sky, and Chronicle of a Floating City. Lo wrote Restless Souls in 1999. That same year, she and Cloud Gate founder Lin Hwai-min started Cloud Gate 2, and Lo was named its first director. She also was awarded the prize for literature and arts from the Foundation. In 2000, the year she wrote The Snake, Lo was honored by the National Culture and Arts Foundation, which named her the recipient of its . As a performer, Lo was best known as the lead dancer for Lin's Requiem. In contrast to Lin's East meets West choreographic style, Lo was influenced by Chinese dances and experiences within her personal life.

Another round of chemotherapy was started at that time, and she was in remission until February 2006. Lo died at the in Taipei at age 50 in March 2006. Her final work, Pursuing the Dream, a collaboration between herself and Sophie, was performed by members of Cloud Gate 2 seven weeks after Lo's death.

Biography Clark, son of Thomas M. and Rebecca (Wheelwright) Clark, was born in Newburyport, Mass., December 17, 1813. At an early age he went to New York City as a clerk in a mercantile house, and while thus engaged became convinced of his duty to prepare for the ministry. He graduated from Yale College in 1838. He spent the year after graduation in the Andover Theological Seminary, and the succeeding year in the Yale Divinity School. He was ordained and installed as pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church in Washington, D. C, January 7, 1842, but resigned that charge in the following November, to accept a call to the North (Congregational) Church in Portsmouth, N. H., over which he was installed on the 16th of that month. He spent nine years in Portsmouth, leaving there in November, 1851 to remove to East Boston, Mass., where he was settled over the Maverick (Congregational) Church, on December 3 of that year. After a pastorate of five years and four months, he went to Brooklyn, N.Y., where he was installed over the South Congregational Church, from April 14, 1857, to November 17, 1862. From December 10, 1862, until his resignation twenty years later, he held the pastorate of the First Reformed Church in Albany, N.Y. As a pastor he was widely known through his question books for Sunday schools and other numerous contributions to religious literature. The most important of his published works, aside from those of a distinctly religious character, was his Heroes of Albany (1866, 8vo, pp. 870), written in commemoration of the sacrifices of the American Civil War. The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him by the University of the City of New York in 1862. After resigning his charge at Albany, in 1882, he made his home, in feeble health, with one of his sons, on Staten Island, N.Y. He went to Nantucket, Mass., for the summer of 1886, and died there, August 9, in his 73rd year. He married, June 14, 1843, Eliza, daughter of the Rev. William C. Walton, of Alexandria, Va., and Hartford, Conn.; she died May 21, 1877, leaving five sons and one daughter. Four of the sons were clergymen.

Like many American artists in France, Kendall spent his summers in Brittany and frequently painted the local peasantry. In 1892 he returned to New York and established his studio. Kendall and his family eventually moved to Newport, Rhode Island, and then to New Haven, Connecticut, where he was a professor and head of the School of Fine Arts at Yale from 1913 to 1922. In 1901 Kendall was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1905. He left Yale in 1922 and relocated to rural Bath County, Virginia, where he continued to paint until his death. Kendall was the recipient of numerous prizes and awards for his work; he was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1920 to 1921. His papers from 1900 to 1936 are housed at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.Thomas E. Luebke, ed., Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Appendix B, p. 547. Although mainly a painter, Kendall also modeled and carved sculptures throughout his career. His work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Baltimore Museum of Art. Personal Kendall's first wife was painter Margaret Weston Stickney, with whom he had three daughters. They divorced in 1921. Kendall had a romantic relationship with Yale student Christine Herter, who he married in 1922, following his resignation from the university.\\"Prof. Kendall Weds His One-Time Pupil,\\" The New York Times, August 3, 1922, p. 11.

It was planted . It is also known as Heritage Tree. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2003.  History  The Fig Tree, located on the corner of Roseberry and Auckland Streets, Gladstone, is a mature Ficus benjamina planted by local businessman James Friend in what was at the time, the horse paddock in the grounds of his Roseberry Street home, Elonera House. Gladstone township was established in April 1854. The Friend family, Henry and Mary Ann Friend and their two small sons Harry (Henry junior) aged 3 and James aged 1, were amongst its earliest settlers, arriving in 1855. Henry Friend senior was employed on the construction of Gladstone's first water supply. When this work was completed he established a general store in Toolooa Street, at the Barney Point end of town. As settlement gradually focussed further north, on Auckland Creek and the shipping trade, Friend established a shipping and forwarding agency, with his own wharf and warehouse, on the banks of the creek. He was a foundation alderman on Gladstone's first municipal council in 1863, and served as Mayor in 1866 and again in 1869-70. In 1875 his sons Henry and James took over the family general merchandising business as H & J Friend, with considerable success. In 1900 they moved from Auckland Creek to Goondoon Street, and in 1939 the business became a limited liability company known as Friends Pty Ltd. In 1954 the company celebrated 97 years of service to Gladstone during the centenary of the establishment of Gladstone in 1854. The Friend family were also involved in the pastoral industry. Henry Friend senior acquired an interest in Diamantina Station and the export of cattle to Asia; and by 1900 Henry junior and James Friend were the proprietors of Springwood Station in the Springsure district. By 1920 their interest in Springwood Station had passed to James Friend's sons, Herbert and Cyril. The Friends were prominent members of the Gladstone community. Both Henry and James were Justices of the Peace, and Mrs James Friend was secretary of the Gladstone Benevolent Asylum. James Friend married Ellen Matilda Prizeman in 1879. They raised a family of 3 sons and 3 daughters, born between 1880 and 1891. In June 1900 title to a one- acre block of land bounded by Roseberry and Auckland Streets and Oaka Lane, was transferred to Ellen Matilda Friend, wife of James Friend of Gladstone, merchant. On this land James and Ellen erected a substantial two-storeyed residence, Elonera House, facing Roseberry Street near the corner of Oaka Lane. It was one of Gladstone's finest houses, complemented with a large garden and stables, and a horse paddock at the corner of Roseberry and Auckland streets. It was in this paddock that the fig tree was planted on the Roseberry Street frontage, reputedly by James Friend . In February 1928 title to the property passed to Robert Horner Fletcher, medical practitioner, of Gladstone, who subdivided it into four allotments. Title to the subdivision at the corner of Roseberry and Auckland Streets, containing the fig tree, was transferred to prominent Gladstone citizen and historian William Robert Golding junior in May 1930. Elonera House was converted into a private hospital called Balcomba in 1931, and into four flats during the Second World War, in response to the housing shortage. It remained flats until 1980 and was demolished soon after. Title to the corner allotment with the fig tree passed to a series of investors in 1980-1981, until in 1982 it was acquired, along with the adjacent subdivisions, by the Queensland Government. Government offices were constructed on the site of Elonera House, at the corner of Roseberry and Oaka Lane. The fig tree remains near the corner of Roseberry and Auckland Streets, adjacent to an open area which is used as a car park. In 1983 the local community was successful in having the tree entered in the National Trust of Queensland's Register of Significant Trees, and in the early 1990s the fig tree was the focus of public attention when the community rallied to save the tree, which appeared to be in decline. In 1993 the Gladstone Port Authority funded the erection of a sign recording the history of the tree. The tree has been identified in the 1999 Gladstone City Cultural Heritage Places Study as a place of cultural heritage significance.  Description  The Roseberry Street Fig Tree is a mature Ficus benjamina (weeping fig) situated in the grounds of the Government Offices in Roseberry Street, Gladstone. It has a height of and a canopy spread of approximately with a trunk circumference of . The tree overhangs the road providing shade for cars parked along the street. Around the base of the tree is a small garden planted with shade loving shrubs which add to the aesthetic value of the place. A modern wooden seat has been placed underneath the deep shade of the tree and near this is located a plaque outlining the history of the tree and its connection to former prominent Gladstone citizens, James Friend and William Robert Golding. The tree dominates the streetscape with its obvious beauty, age and size and it has become a place of rest and conversation for those working in the immediate vicinity.  Heritage listing  The fig tree was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Estimated to be over 100 years old, the fig tree at the State Government Centre, Roseberry Street, Gladstone is a familiar landmark in the town of Gladstone, and is linked historically to James Friend, a prominent member of the Gladstone community, who reputedly planted it in his Roseberry Street garden . It is the only surviving remnant of the large garden which surrounded one of Gladstone's finest residences, Elonera House, erected and demolished . The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is the only surviving remnant of the large garden which surrounded one of Gladstone's finest residences, Elonera House, erected and demolished . The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The tree is valued by the present community for its streetscape and aesthetic value and is well-known to local residents and business houses, many of whom have contributed newspaper articles and offered support to conserve the tree when it appeared to be in decline in the early 1990s.

The episode was written by series developer Bruno Heller and directed by Danny Cannon. It was first broadcast on May 4, 2015 in FOX. In this episode, the mob war between Carmine Falcone (John Doman) and Salvatore Maroni (David Zayas) is coming to a brutal end while Oswald Cobblepot and Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) face off in their final confrontation, putting James Gordon (Benjamin McKenzie) in the middle of both conflicts. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz) sets out to find evidence that his father had a secret life before his death. Plot A group of street children, among them Selina, witness the arrival of Fish Mooney and the escapees from Dollmaker's Island. Mooney approaches Selina and states that it will be a \\"new day\\". Selina and the children soon join Mooney's gang. Two weeks later, Bruce becomes convinced his father led a double life and with help from Alfred, he looks throughout his father's study room. Carmine Falcone is shot during an ambush in the port by Maroni's men and taken to the hospital. At the GCPD, Barbara decides to take trauma counselling from Dr. Leslie Thompkins after the death of her parents at the hands of The Ogre. Cobblepot and Butch Gilzean arrive at the hospital, intending to kill Falcone. Cobblepot reveals planning the mob war since before making his deal with Falcone. Gordon stops them and handcuffs Cobblepot and Butch to a pipe and frees Falcone. Falcone will need two days in a hideout to find a way to stop the war and Gordon agrees to help him. Cobblepot, realizing Maroni's men are coming and will kill him for his betrayal, pleads with Gordon to free him, citing the favor Gordon owns him. Commissioner Loeb arrives with Maroni's hitmen and orders them to kill Gordon and Falcone. A shootout between Gordon and the hitmen ensues with Gordon killing the hitmen. With help from Bullock, Gordon, Falcone, Cobblepot and Gilzean escape in an ambulance. They get to Falcone's safe house but are taken hostage by Mooney's gang. Mooney is even more furious after noticing Butch's brainwashing treatment delivered by Victor Zsasz and Cobblepot. Mooney makes a trade with Maroni: in exchange for Falcone's head, Maroni will return Mooney's territories. Mooney also plans on killing Cobblepot for brainwashing Butch but spares Bullock's life. However, during the meeting with Maroni, Maroni makes sexist comments about Mooney, which causes her to shoot him in the head. Maroni's and Mooney's gangs then fight, which gives enough time to Falcone, Gordon, and Bullock to escape to a cargo container. Falcone decides he's \\"done\\" with business and plans on retiring. Selina's gang recaptures them and bring them back to Mooney. Cobblepot appears with a machine gun and kills some gang members. He then pursues Mooney to the rooftop of the warehouse while Falcone, Gordon and Bullock escape. Meanwhile, during the therapy, Barbara reveals that she murdered her parents, enraged that they never loved her. She then suffers a psychotic breakdown and proceeds to attempt to kill Leslie for stealing her fianc√©e Gordon. Leslie manages to neutralize Barbara in self-defense just as Gordon, Falcone, and Bullock arrive. On the rooftop of the warehouse, Mooney and Cobblepot engage in a violent fight. Butch arrives with a gun, but as he was brainwashed to obey Cobblepot and with his loyalty to Mooney, he doesn't know whom to shoot. Unknowingly, he shoots both of them. Mooney forgives Butch for shooting her but Cobblepot insults Butch. He then pushes Mooney to the edge of the rooftop, which makes her to fall in the water, seemingly killing her. A shocked Butch watches in horror as Cobblepot climbs to the edge of the rooftop and shouts: \\"I am the king of Gotham!\\". In the GCPD, in the file room, Kristen Kringle reveals to Nygma something she found in the note from \\"Dougherty\\": the first letter of each line spells out N-Y-G-M-A, his surname. Nygma denies any knowledge of the letter. When Kringle leaves, he suffers a mental breakdown and talks to an alternate personality that has manifested itself in his mind. Before leaving Gotham, Falcone gives Gordon a knife Gordon's father gave him, stating: The knife is a good friend when you have no others\\". In the final scene, Bruce and Alfred find nothing in the study. After Alfred states \\"none so blind\\", referring to Marcus Aurelius, recalling Lucius Fox calling his father \\"stoic\\". He finds a book with a device. He turns it on and makes the fireplace recede. The season ends with Bruce and Alfred finding stairs behind the fireplace, leading to a cave.

This was an increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.58 million viewers. This made Gotham the most watched program of the day in FOX, beating The Following. Critical reception \\"All Happy Families Are Alike\\" received mixed reviews from critics but acclaim from fans. The episode received a rating of 59% based on 23 reviews, with an average score of 7.3 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"'All Happy Families are Alike' brings season one of Gotham to a somewhat confusing conclusion, but some exciting twists hint at a promising, and hopefully more consistent, season two.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"okay\\" 6.3 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict: \\"Gothams Season 1 finale had some cool parts involving a freshly insane Barbara and an unexpected mob death, but the rest of it was so dang sloppy (Fish's attire, Selina joining Fish, Falcone quitting, Butch's brainwashing all of a sudden returning after being ignored for months, etc).\\" Darren Orf of EW stated: \\"Gothams first season ends much as it lived‚Äîwith confusion, poorly plotted scenes and by turning a blind eye to everything that makes Batman great. To say 'All Happy Families Are Alike' is a letdown would be to expect too much from this finale to begin with. But after this week's episode finally cuts to black and the credits roll, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like the entire first year was a missed opportunity.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"The first season of Gotham has been a mess of incomplete or simply terrible ideas, but much of the finale proves that the show does have something to offer when it remains focused. The mob power struggle was dragged out over too many episodes, but the finale boasts a narrative concision that‚Äôs promising for the show moving forward. There's hope that after an auspicious start, Gotham has found a bit of footing in the last half of this season. Then again, maybe Penguin is right: 'Hope? It‚Äôs for losers.'\\" References External links  Gotham (season 1) episodes 2015 American television episodes ","title":"All Happy Families Are Alike"},{"id":"48747619","text":"Andrej Markudov () (born 23 March 1996) is a Macedonian handball player who plays for RK Aerodrom.

It was built by the Spanish Empire, and it was one of the most important Spanish fortifications along the Pacific coast. The fort was first built in the 17th century, but was completely rebuilt in the 18th century. Today, it is an important landmark in Acapulco, and it is open to the public as the Acapulco Historic Museum (). History The fort's gate The Fort of San Diego was built by the Spanish Empire to protect Acapulco from attacks by pirates, since the city was an important trading port, being the point of departure for the Manila galleons. The fort was first built by Viceroy Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, Marquis of Guadalc√°zar, and was completed in 1617 to designs of the Dutch military engineer Adri√°n Boot. The fort was extensively damaged in an earthquake in 1776, and it was demolished and rebuilt to designs of Ram√≥n Pan√≥n. Construction of the new fort began in 1778, and it was completed in 1783. The new fort was given the name Fuerte de San Carlos in honour of the reigning monarch, King Carlos III, but it was still called Fuerte de San Diego by most people, and the new name eventually fell out of use. The fort saw use during the Mexican War of Independence, and its Spanish garrison under the command of Pedro Antonio V√©lez resisted insurgent attacks for several months until it fell to the Mexicans under Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos on 19 August 1813. The fort remained an active military installation of the Mexican Army, serving the Secretariat of War and Navy in the late 19th century. The fort also saw use during the French intervention in Mexico and the Mexican Revolution. Recent history Exhibits of the Acapulco Historic Museum in the fort It was handed to the Secretar√≠a de Bienes Nacionales e Inspecci√≥n Administrativa in 1949 in order to be converted into a military museum. It was administered by the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) until 1964, when it was handed to the Secretariat of Public Education to be used by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura. In 1970, it was handed to the Junta de Mejoras Materiales del Puerto de Acapulco and it was used for cultural and artistic purposes. The fort was handed back to INAH in 1980, and it was opened to the public as a museum in 1986. The museum is dedicated to the history of Acapulco, and its exhibits include archaeological remains from the Mezcala culture and artifacts relating to the Manila galleons, piracy, the Mexican War of Independence as well as exhibits about the fort itself. The museum is open to the public on Tuesdays through Sundays. Admission on Sunday is free. Layout First fort The original fort as designed by Adri√°n Boot had an irregular pentagonal shape, and its five bastions were called: *Baluarte del Rey (King's Bastion) *Baluarte del Pr√≠ncipe (Prince's Bastion) *Baluarte del Duque (Duke's Bastion) *Baluarte del Marqu√©s (Marquis' Bastion) *Baluarte de Guadalc√°zar (Guadalc√°zar Bastion) Second fort Model of the Fort of San Diego showing its layout The present fort as designed by Ram√≥n Pan√≥n is in the shape of a regular pentagon, and its five bastions are called: *Baluarte de San Jos√© (St. Joseph Bastion) *Baluarte de San Antonio (St. Anthony Bastion) *Baluarte de San Luis (St. Louis Bastion) *Baluarte de Santa B√°rbara (St. Barbara Bastion) *Baluarte de la Concepci√≥n (Conception Bastion) Each bastion had a guerite on its salient, but these were demolished in the 1970s.

A Path in the New Forest, watercolor. Herstmonceaux Castle, watercolor, 1906. Biography Wilfrid Williams Ball was born in London on 4 January 1853, the fifth of six children of Benjamin Williams Ball, an accountant and amateur poet, and Sylvia (Good) Ball. He was athletic as well as artistically talented, and as a member of the London Athletic Club won prizes in several sports. His younger sister Rosamund became a noted Victorian poet. Ball initially spent several years in an accountant's office as his father did not wish him to become an artist. In the evenings he studied drawing at Heatherley School of Fine Art in Chelsea, the only formal art training he ever received. Ball began exhibiting in 1877 when a small etching was accepted for a Royal Academy exhibition, and with this impetus he decided to quit his job and become a full-time artist. He gained his first substantive notice when James Abbott McNeill Whistler admired a series of etchings of the Thames River that he did in 1881‚Äì82. He followed these up with two more etching series, one focused on the Isis River and the other on the town of Stratford-on-Avon. In 1900, one of his etchings was awarded a bronze medal at the Paris Exhibition. Although Ball continued to make etchings, his major success came from watercolors of rural landscapes and marine subjects, especially in the counties of Buckinghamshire, Surrey, Norfolk, Sussex, Wiltshire, and Hampshire. He exhibited frequently at the Royal Academy; the Royal Society of Painters, Etchers and Engravers; the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours; and other venues. In 1887, he made his first trip abroad, painting the Venice lagoons; he later made sketching and painting trips to Holland, Germany, and Egypt as well. He published two books of his work, Sussex: Painted by Wilfrid Ball (1906) and Hampshire: Painted by Wilfrid Ball (1909). These helped to popularized his work, which has ever since been used on postcards and greeting cards. Writing about him after his death, the art critic C. Lewis Hind observed of him that he had no revolutionary ideas and no particular ambition, but that his work was in demand throughout his career because it offered serenely pastoral and picturesque views of England that people wanted to hang on their walls. Ball also wrote and illustrated several articles for the art magazine The Studio, one on Egypt and another on Venice. In 1886, he served as president of the Society of British Artists. In 1895, Ball married Florence Helen Brock- Hollinshead; they had no children. Ball published two lavish books of his work in the A&C; Black twenty shilling series; one of Hampshire in 1909 and an earlier one for Sussex in 1906. During World War I, Ball served as an administrator for the British Army in northern Africa. He arrived in Cairo, Egypt, in September 1916 and initially worked with the firm of accountants that he had been associated with in his youth. He was sent on to Khartoum, Sudan, to audit military accounts and died there of heat apoplexy (heat stroke) on 14 February 1917.

Meade's Yup'ik name is Arnaq which means \\"woman.\\" She also works and travels with the International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers. Meade is also part of the Nunamta Yup'ik Dance Group. Meade has been documenting the cultural knowledge of Yup'ik elders, including the values, language and beliefs of the Yup'ik people for over twenty years. She is currently an instructor at the University of Alaska Anchorage.  Biography  Meade was born and raised in Nunapiciaq which is located between the Kuskokwim River and the Bering Sea. It was a small village of about 300 people. Her knowledge of the Yup'ik language and culture came from her father and mother, Upayuilnguq and Narullgiar, and her community. Her parents were strict, and an arranged marriage was a distinct possibility for Meade, one which she was against. Meade attended the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. In 1970, she was chosen by the community to teach the first bilingual program in the village of Nunapiciaq in conjunction with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. She already spoke Yup'ik fluently, but had to learn to read and write in Yup'ik, which she learned at the Alaska Native Language Institute in Fairbanks. She taught for a year and then moved on to work at the Yup'ik Language Workshop, where she was involved in creating curriculum for Yup'ik language instruction. Meade met her husband in Fairbanks where he was stationed with the United States Army. They moved to Bethel, where Meade taught Yup'ik at the Kushokwim Community College. She and her husband had two sons together, and it was while she was raising her children that she \\"discovered the positive energy of Yup'ik dance--much of which had been stamped out by missionaries in the 1960s.\\" She has three grown sons and many grandchildren. Meade was the replacement speaker at an international conference in Fairbanks taking place in 1990. The anthropologist, Ann Fienup- Riordan, was in attendance and the meeting started \\"two decades of partnership in the documentation of the Yup'ik culture, language and practices.\\" Along with Fienup-Riordan, she has worked on cultural exhibits, identified Yup'ik artifacts in Berlin which were collected from Alaska in 1883 and worked on translations together. Mead and Fienup-Riordan created the show, \\"Agayuliyaraput,\\" a display of Yup'ik masks. The exhibition opened in 1997 in Toksook Bay, and was shown in Anchorage, New York, Washington, D.C., and Seattle. For the work on the Berlin artifacts in the Ethnologisches Museum, Meade translated conversations of Yup'ik elders and worked on a book, Ciuliamta Aklui, Things of Our Ancestors, which documents the art and the words of the Yup'ik elders.

It was designed by Raymond C Nowland and built from 1940 to 1942. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 May 1998.  History  Gladstone Court House, a two-storeyed masonry building, was erected in 1940-42. The building was designed in the office of the Queensland Department of Public Works, and replaced an 1873-1874 courthouse and lands office. The 1940s building was at least the third purpose-designed courthouse in Gladstone. Gladstone was established by the New South Wales government in 1853-1854, possibly in an attempt to create a more centralised alternative to Brisbane as the capital of any future northern colony. When Captain Maurice Charles O'Connell, first Government Resident and Police Magistrate of the Port Curtis District, arrived in March 1854, the township of Gladstone had been laid out near Auckland Inlet, and the first slab buildings had been erected. O'Connell and his family set up residence (initially in tents) at Barney Point, a couple of miles south of Auckland Inlet, and around The Residency there soon developed a small residential settlement. Architectural drawing of the 1870s Court House O'Connell first conducted court matters from his tent office at Barney Point. Within a few months he had acquired a slab and shingled building on the rise of Auckland Hill - illegally erected by storekeeper Richard Palmer on a crown reserve, prior to O'Connell's arrival - as Gladstone's first court house and public building. About 1860 this building appears to have been replaced with a purpose-designed court house and watch house. This in turn was demolished in 1873-1874 and replaced with a two-storeyed timber building, which accommodated both the courthouse and the lands office. The 1873-1874 building was situated on the present court house reserve, but at the northern end of the block, overlooking Auckland Inlet, and was accessed via a lane from Auckland Street. The building was extended in 1882-1883, and served as the Gladstone Court House until the early 1940s, when it was replaced with a two-storeyed brick building. Site preparation for the brick building, which was to face Yarroon Street and the town rather than the harbour, was carried out in the second half of 1940, and plans for the new Courthouse were prepared by the Queensland Department of Public Works in late 1940 and early 1941. A plan dated December 1940 showing front and rear elevations and ground and first floor plans, was drawn by architect Thomas Robert Gladwin, who had been employed as assistant architect in the architectural office of the Public Works Department since 1924. The design of the building is attributed to Raymond Clare Nowland who was also the designer of Stanthorpe Courthouse (1941) and Charleville Courthouse (1945). All three courthouses are similar in planning, elevational treatment, materials and detailing. These were two-storeyed masonry buildings in stripped-classical style, H-shaped in plan, generally incorporating the courtroom on the upper floor, and government public offices on the ground floor. The new Gladstone Court House was completed in late 1942, at a cost of nearly . Like the Mackay Courthouse and Charleville court house, it was a combined court house/public offices, providing court facilities (court room, offices for the Judge, police magistrate/warden and police, and rooms for the jury, witnesses and solicitor) as well as offices for the land ranger, forestry officer, stock and dairy inspectors and mining registrar. Alterations to the fabric of the building have been fairly minimal. Between 1966 and 1972, a single-storeyed brick extension, containing staffroom and toilets, was erected at the rear of the building. Some minor internal refurbishment has been undertaken. The former police office on the ground floor has been converted to a small courtroom, but it is unclear at what date - possibly the mid-1970s. This does not appear to have involved the removal of any partition walls. In the early 1980s, a suspended acoustic ceiling was installed in the courtroom and a new judge's toilet was provided.  Description  Prominently situated on Auckland Hill with the main entrance addressing Yarroon Street, the Gladstone Court House is a two-storeyed brick building with a hipped corrugated iron roof. Designed in a stripped classical style, the red face brickwork contrasts with rendered string courses at floor and window levels. A rendered masonry fence appears to have been designed with the building. The building is H-shaped in plan with the main entrance centrally positioned. A flight of stairs leads to a verandah and portico with two Doric columns supporting an entablature with \\"COURT HOUSE\\" in raised lettering. The entrance doorway contains a two-leafed, eight-panelled door with fanlight and architrave. On the southern section of the main elevation a masonry ramp gives access to the verandah. All the windows throughout the building are timber framed with either six or twelve panes. At the rear of the building a single- storeyed extension encloses the space between the wings of the building. Internally the ground floor contains a central corridor with a large general office on the right hand side and a Magistrate's Court on the left-hand side. The space occupied by the Magistrate's Court was previously an office. An enclosed verandah at the rear of the building gives access to two staircases and the extension which is a lunchroom. On the upper level the main courtroom occupies the cross section of the H with the other two wings containing offices. The courtroom contains all the original court room furniture and has a suspended ceiling with modern light fittings, air conditioning and fans. The purpose-built silky oak courtroom furniture includes a judges' bench, witness dock, public gallery, jury benches, tables, benches and chairs. The furniture is sombre and plain with decorative battened panels to the front of the judges' bench, sides of jury benches, chair backs and other associated small benches/tables. The design and detailing of the building is robust and both internally and externally it remains intact. It retains most of its original fixtures and finishes including joinery, hardware, plaster ceilings, timber floors and concrete passageways and staircases.  Heritage listing  Gladstone Court House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 May 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Gladstone Court House, erected in the early 1940s, is important in illustrating the pattern of development of Gladstone as a regional centre. As one of a group of employment-generating public buildings erected in Gladstone during the interwar period, [including the 1929 Commonwealth Bank Building, the 1932 Post Office and the 1934 Town Council Chambers], the court house is significant in illustrating a more positive impact of the interwar economic depression on regional Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The two-storeyed brick courthouse remains substantially intact, and is a good example of interwar Queensland public works design. The courtroom is important for its collection of intact purpose-built furniture. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Prominently positioned on the rise of Auckland Hill, Gladstone Court House remains an integral component of the Gladstone townscape, and has landmark status. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a group, these buildings contributed significantly to the development of a 20th century image for Gladstone, and remain important public landmarks. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building is important for its association with the Department of Public Works and in particular with the work of architect Raymond Clare Nowland.The court house, and the reserve on which it is located, is significant for its strong association with the dispensing of justice in the Port Curtis District since at least the 1870s.

The method can be used in pediatric ophthalmology for screening purposes. By simultaneously measuring the central fixation of both eyes, small- and large-angle strabismus can be detected. The method is not invasive and requires little cooperation by the patient, so it can be used for detecting strabismus in young children. The method provides a reliable detection of strabismus and has also been used for detecting certain kinds of amblyopia.RBS uses the human eye's birefringent properties to identify the position of the fovea and the direction of gaze, and thereby to measure any binocular misalignment. __TOC__  Principle  Birefringent material has a refractive index that depends on the polarization state and propagation direction of light. The main contribution to the birefringence of the eye stems from the Henle fibers. These fibers (named after Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle) are photoreceptor axons that are arranged in a radially symmetric pattern, extending outward from the fovea, which is the most sensitive part of the retina. When polarized light strikes the fovea, the layer of Henle fibers produces a characteristic pattern, and the strength and contrast of this pattern, as well as the orientation of its bright parts, depend on the polarization of the light that reaches the retina. An analysis of this pattern allows the position of the fovea and the direction of gaze to be determined. Binocular RBS has been used for diagnosing strabismus (including microstrabismus) in young children, and has also been proposed for diagnosing amblyopia by detecting strabismus and by detecting reduced fixation accuracy.  Limitations  However, also birefringent properties of the cornea and the retinal nerve fiber layer are sources of birefringence. Corneal birefringence varies widely from one individual to another, as well as from one location to another for the same individual, thus can confound measurements.

History  The former Gladstone Post Office was erected in 1932 as a purpose-designed post office for the Commonwealth Postmaster-General's Department, replacing earlier Post and Telegraph Offices on the same site. The 1932 building was at least the third purpose-built post and telegraph offices in Gladstone, and was designed by the office of the Federal Director-General of Works, Canberra. It was one of several important public buildings erected in Gladstone in the interwar years as work creation schemes, including the 1929 Commonwealth Bank Building, the 1934 Town Council Chambers and the Court House. As a group, these buildings contributed significantly to the development of a 20th-century image for Gladstone, and remain important public landmarks. Gladstone was established by the New South Wales colonial government in 1854, possibly in an attempt to create a more centralised alternative to Brisbane as the capital of any future northern colony. The town's first post office was gazetted on 1 July 1854, opening in premises at the corner of Goondoon and Yarroon Streets (later the site of the Commercial Hotel). In the late 1850s and early 1860s postal services between Gladstone and Gayndah, Maryborough and Rockhampton were established, and to the Calliope Goldfields in 1864. In 1860, the Brisbane-Gladstone postal service came by fortnightly steamer, increased to a weekly service in 1871. On 28 November 1864 the overland telegraph service was opened to Gladstone, linking the town with Brisbane, Rockhampton and the hinterland. In 1869 a substantial brick building was erected on the Customs Reserve at the corner of Lord and Goondoon Streets, Gladstone, as a purpose-designed Post and Telegraph Offices and Customs House, with attached residences for the post master and the telegraph master. For a short time, post, telegraph and customs shared this building before it was designated as Gladstone Customs House. Timber telegraph and post office in Goondoon Street, Gladstone, 1904 The post and telegraph departments then occupied temporary premises until a large timber building with separate offices and residences for post and telegraph was constructed in 1877-1878. This building was erected in Goondoon Street, at the intersection with Yarroon Street, on a prominent and centrally located site gazetted as a Post and Telegraph Reserve. Total expenditure on building and site by the Queensland government in the period 1877-1900 was . A telephone trunk line office opened at the Gladstone Post & Telegraph Offices on 20 September 1910, but the exchange was not built until 1911. In 1912, most of Queensland's Post and Telegraph Department's property, including the Gladstone Post and Telegraph Offices, was transferred to the Commonwealth Government. By the late 1920s, the shabby condition of Gladstone's Post and Telegraph Offices was an embarrassment to the local community. The Commonwealth Government's District Works Inspector, based at Rockhampton, recommended in 1925 and 1927 that the building did not warrant substantial expense on repairs, and recommended that a brick or concrete structure be erected in its place. Still the Postmaster- General's Department failed to act. By late 1928 the condition of the Gladstone Post Office had become an election issue, and in 1929, federal MHR for Capricornia, Mr Frank Forde, lobbied on behalf of his constituents for a new post office. Finally, provision was made in the estimates of 1930-1931 for a new brick and tile-roofed building, to cost approximately . However, by the end of 1930, as world-wide economic depression worsened (with primary- producing Australia particularly vulnerable) this proposal was deferred. The depression deepened, and in November 1931, the Federal Works Director for Queensland, James Orwin, recommended to Canberra that urgently required new post offices at Gladstone, Muttaburra, Hughendon and Isisford be erected under relief scheme funding, using day labour. The proposal was accepted, and work on the Gladstone project commenced almost immediately. Before the end of the year, plans and specifications were being prepared by the office of the Director-General of Works, Canberra. By late January 1932, Mr D Gallogly had been engaged as foreman of works and the Post Office half of the 1870s building had been sold for removal. The new post office was erected on the same reserve as the 1870s building, but with a smaller () frontage to Goondoon Street. To enable construction of the new building, the Post Office half and clock tower of the 1870s building were removed first, and the post office temporarily shared facilities with the telegraph office. When the new building was completed, the old Telegraph Offices were removed, leaving a frontage of to Goondoon Street for future development. The new post office was a single- storeyed rendered brick building with symmetrically arranged entrance porches on either side of the front elevation. Unlike the earlier Gladstone Post and Telegraph Offices, the new building did not include quarters for the post master or telegraph master. Only 7 of this \\"twin porch\\" type of masonry post office were erected in Queensland in the period 1923-1932, but 25 timber post offices of similar design were erected 1923-1939. The masonry post offices of this era illustrate the transition from timber to masonry post offices in Queensland, and from design by the Queensland Works Department to the Commonwealth Works Department. No new timber post offices were erected in Queensland after 1940, and the masonry post offices erected in the period 1941 to 1952 favoured the \\"porch, parapet and hip\\" design. The Gladstone Post Office was the only one of the Queensland \\"twin porch\\" masonry post offices to include a clock tower, illustrating Gladstone's role as an important regional centre. The existing clock mechanism, already recycled from Maryborough and dating to at least 1900, was overhauled and used again in the new building. In 1932 the Gladstone Town Council agreed to illuminate, each night until midnight, the faces of the town clock which was to be installed in the new post office. The new post office was opened officially on 23 July 1932, when members of the Gladstone Town Council, Chamber of Commerce and Harbour Board were taken on a tour of the building. At the time, the contribution of Mr FM Forde, MHR, in promoting the construction of this building, was acknowledged. In the second half of the 1940s a two-storeyed rendered-brick Carrier Equipment Building (telephone exchange) was erected on the southern end of the post office reserve, about from the post office building and fronting Goondoon Street. This was extended to the rear in 1965-67, linking the exchange with the 1932 post office. Perhaps at this period, and certainly between 1962 and 1976, the post office building was extended on the southern side to accommodate public telephones. By 1976, the post office had undergone a number of modifications, including a large, two-storeyed brick extension to the rear of the post office, necessitating the removal of the rear wall of the 1932 building, and changes to the two public entrances. Internal verandahs had been created along the north and east sides by means of a rearrangement of the internal partitions, accommodating an expanded number of private post boxes. By the mid-1990s, changes in postal handling techniques made the building redundant to Australia Post, and it was sold to private enterprise in 1997. The interior has been gutted since, in preparation for an internal refurbishment as offices, but the principal street facades survive reasonably intact, and the prominently positioned building, along with its clock tower, remains an integral element in the Gladstone townscape.  Description  Former Gladstone Post Office, 1998 The former Gladstone Post Office is a single-storeyed rendered masonry building with a terracotta-tiled hipped roof, prominent clock tower and two-storeyed brick extension at the rear of the building. The building is situated in Goondoon Street, the principal street in Gladstone, and overlooks the harbour. The principal facade of the building is to Goondoon Street with two flat roofed porches either side of a protruding gable. The building is designed in a stripped classical style. The clock tower sits above the gabled-end; it is square in plan, has a four-faced clock and is capped with a pyramidal terracotta roof. Below the clock tower the gable-end elevation has two sets of paired sash timber windows arranged symmetrically. There is evidence in the triangular pediment of the gable of the original signage. The entrance to the twin porches is marked by two simple columns. The northern porch is entered by a flight of steps; aluminium shop fronts and doors give access to the building. The southern porch has been extended along the southern elevation of the building. The extension is rendered masonry, with paired sash windows and a flat metal deck roof. The southern porch has aluminium shop fronts and doors. The northern elevation of the buildings has two sets of timber sash windows symmetrically arranged. The basement level below has three multi-paned timber sash windows. Internally the main Goondoon Street level of the 1932 Post Office is one large open space. The original timber floor is extant, as is some remnant light internal partitioning. The ceiling has been removed as part of the process of refurbishing the building. The back wall of the original building was demolished when the extension was constructed. The two-storeyed face brick rear extension has a flat roof. A concrete stairway leads to the lower level which contains a number of small rooms and connects with the two basement rooms of the 1932 building.  Heritage listing  The former Gladstone Post Office was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 May 1998 having satisfied the following criteria.

It is a low shrub with a restricted distribution but which often occurs in large numbers, forming a dense ground cover. It is readily distinguished from the other three species in the genus by its unusual leaf arrangement. Description Diocirea ternata is a shrub with many stems and which sometimes grows to a height of and spreads to a width of . Its branches have many raised resin glands and the leaves are arranged in rings of three around the stems. The leaves are mostly long, about wide, egg-shaped tapering to a point and sticky due to the presence of resin. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils and lack a stalk. There are 5 egg-shaped, pointed green sepals with hairs on their edges. The petals are white, sometimes pale violet at first, and are joined to form a tube long with lobes which are about long. The lobes are spotted purple near the centre of the flower and the tube is mostly glabrous except for a few hairs on the lower lobe. There are 4 stamens which extend slightly beyond the petal tube. The fruit that follows flowering is a flattened oval shape, with a crusty brown covering. Taxonomy and naming Diocirea ternata was first formally described by taxonomist Bob Chinnock in Eremophila and allied genera: a monograph of the plant family Myoporaceae in 2007 from a specimen collected west of Balladonia. The specific epithet is derived from \\"Latin ternata, in threes; referring to the whorled leaves\\". Distribution and habitat Diocirea ternata has a restricted distribution in a small area near Balladonia in the Coolgardie biogeographic region where it grows in woodland on clay loam.

It was designed by Roy Chipps and built from 1933 to 1934 by relief workers. It is also known as Gladstone Town Hall & Council Chambers. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 July 1998.  History  The Gladstone Regional Art Gallery and Museum, designed by Rockhampton architect Roy Chipps, was erected in 1933-34 as the Gladstone Town Hall and Municipal Chambers. It functioned as such for about 33 years and then as an entertainment venue until 1980, when the City Theatre opened. In 1985 the building was converted to an art gallery and museum. Gladstone was established by the New South Wales government in 1853-54 (prior to the separation of Queensland), possibly in an attempt to create a more centralised alternative to Brisbane as the capital of any future northern colony. The township acquired municipal status in 1863, and the first town hall was erected in 1868 in Goondoon Street, north of the Yarroon Street intersection. Gladstone languished in the 1870s and 1880s, but in the late 1890s sustained a period of strong development associated with the 1896 opening of the Gladstone meatworks and extension of the railway from Brisbane to Gladstone in the same year. However, by 1900 the cattle tick was decimating the local grazing industry, affecting meatworks production and cattle shipments. This, coupled with the great drought of 1900-02 and the 1903 opening of the Rockhampton extension of the railway which immediately deprived Gladstone of substantial port trade and passenger shipping, caused a crisis in business confidence in the town. The development of a local dairying industry and the 1905 opening of a butter factory at Gladstone, did much to revive the town's fortunes, and sustained the town during the interwar period, when many Gladstone business premises were rebuilt or renovated. Construction of the 1933-34 town hall, a long-needed project, was made possible by low interest loans and subsidised labour provided by the Queensland Government during the height of the economic depression of the 1930s. Other buildings constructed in Gladstone during this period as employment-generating schemes included the 1929 Commonwealth Bank Building, the 1932 Post Office, and the 1940-42 Court House. In late 1932, Gladstone Town Council applied for a State Government loan for the erection of a new town hall at the northeast corner of Goondoon and Bramston Streets, and invited competitive designs for the project. This was won by architect Roy Chipps of Rockhampton. The Queensland Department of Labour granted the Gladstone Town Council a subsidy of nearly to employ labour under the Unemployed Worker's Scheme; i.e. men receiving the dole were not eligible for relief work until their sustenance rights were exhausted, and then when given work, were to be employed on a rotational basis of 13 weeks continuous work rather than the 1 or 2 days per week under the usual day labour system. Work commenced about September 1933, under the foremanship of Mr FH Cecil of Brisbane. Bricks for the building were made in Rockhampton. The original brief and design was for Council Chambers only, but during construction a newly elected Town Council decided to extend the building to include a public hall and stage. The council chambers was already nearing completion, so Chipps had to convert the main chamber into a hall, with a stage and fly tower extension at the eastern end. This work was made possible with an additional State Government loan of , granted in January 1934. The new Gladstone Town Hall and Municipal Chambers was opened officially on Saturday 15 September 1934, by Hon Harry Bruce MLA, Minister for Public Works. For the occasion, the front of the building was garlanded with 40 International Signal Flags borrowed from the Pilot Station at Gatcombe Head. The building was considered a fine ornament to the town. The council offices and meeting room were at the western end of the building, fronting Goondoon Street. The town's First World War Honour Board was relocated from the old council chambers and hung in the new council meeting room. Behind the offices was the public hall, long by wide, accessed via a foyer from Goondoon Street, and from a side entrance facing Bramston Street. A short winding staircase near the proscenium at the eastern end led to the supper room in the basement. Stage, dressing rooms and toilets were accessed from the basement. Gladstone Town Council's first meeting in the new premises was held on 8 October 1934, and from this time the council chambers at the north end of Goondoon Street was leased to the RSSLIA (Returned Soldiers). The new Town Hall rapidly became the hub of community life, with a weekly baby clinic, \\"talkies\\" screened 3 times a week (canvas chairs were placed in the auditorium), balls, stage shows, ALP sponsored bingo, and community group meetings of all kinds. In 1956 a children's library, and in 1957 a small adult library, were opened in the basement of the Town Hall, which no longer functioned as a supper room. In 1947 the 173rd anniversary of Matthew Flinders' birth was celebrated with tree plantings on Auckland Hill and outside the Gladstone Town Hall, and with the unveiling of a plaque at the hall. Flinders had named and explored Port Curtis in August 1802, during his circumnavigation of the Australian mainland. Within a decade of its opening, plans were being discussed to replace the Gladstone Town Hall and Municipal Chambers with a larger Civic Centre. These plans were deferred a number of times, and when finally built in 1958-59, the new Civic Centre comprised only one floor, with no council chamber, and no offices for council staff. In 1966 work began on the upper floor of the Civic Centre, and the Gladstone Town Council met there for the first time on 18 December 1967. From this date the principal use of the former Town Hall and Municipal Chambers was as an entertainment and meeting venue. The library in the basement of the Town Hall also was transferred to the Civic Centre in the 1960s. The first Gladstone City Council (1976‚Äì79) built a new library and art gallery, established an immunisation centre, chose a site for a City Theatre and planned its construction - all of which contributed to the redundancy of the 1934 Town Hall. In 1980 the new City Theatre opened, and in 1984-85 the Gladstone City Council converted the former Town Hall and Municipal Chambers into an art gallery and museum, to provide the citizens of Gladstone and visitors to the city with a venue in which to view art, of all media, by professional and amateur artists from locally and elsewhere and to acquaint themselves with the cultural and historic heritage of the area. The Gladstone Regional Art Gallery and Museum was opened officially on 3 April 1985. The refurbishment necessitated the installation of \\"total environment control\\", filling-in of the proscenium arch over the stage, and removal of the internal stairs from the hall to the basement.  Description  The Gladstone Regional Art Gallery and Museum is situated on the corner of Bramston Street and Goondoon Street, which is the principal street of Gladstone. The Art Gallery and Museum is a single-storeyed masonry building, with a basement level, designed in a free classical style. The main entrance to the building is from Goodoon Street through a portico with Doric columns and an arched entablature with \\"TOWN HALL\\" in raised lettering. The doorway is in an arched opening with decorative double doors and fanlight. On either side of the entrance portico are arched windows and pilasters; this western elevation is finished with a parapet and flagpole. Behind the parapet is a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. The building is rendered and the details are moulded plasterwork. The side elevations of the building contain sash windows and decorative fanlights with a pattern of radiating glazing bars. This is a motif that is used throughout the glazing in the building. The southern elevation to Bramston Street has a secondary entrance to the building. A flight of steps with wrought iron lamp stands leads to an arched doorway. At the eastern end of the building is the concrete-framed fly tower. Internally the plan of the building is a central hallway, with rooms on either side, that opens onto the large space that was formerly the hall. The entrance vestibule has silky oak panelling to door head height, silky oak doors and fanlights all with the radiating glazing bars. Opening off the hallway to the north is the room that was the Council chamber. This room contains a very fine timber First World War honour board. The former Council chamber and hallway are connected by a hatch with a writing slope. On the southern side of the hallway are two rooms and a strong room. The former hall has been renovated to become an art gallery. This room has been lined so that the windows are covered, the proscenium arch has been removed and a wall placed between the former stage area and the hall. The room has two exposed air conditioning ducts running its length and a suspended track lighting system. The room has a curved ceiling with exposed timber trusses. The fly tower is used as a store room with a mezzanine above the stage area. The basement area is entered from Bramston Street and is also used for storage.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Gladstone Regional Art Gallery and Museum, erected in 1933-34 as the Gladstone Town Hall and Municipal Chambers, is important in illustrating the pattern of development of Gladstone as a regional centre. As one of a group of employment-generating public buildings erected in Gladstone during the interwar period, (including the 1929 Commonwealth Bank Building, the 1932 Post Office and the 1940-42 Court House), the former town hall is significant in illustrating a more positive impact of the interwar economic depression on regional Queensland. As a group, these buildings contributed significantly to the development of a 20th-century image for Gladstone, and the former town hall remains one of the town's most prestigious buildings. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The conversion into an art gallery and museum in 1984‚Äì85 necessitated some alterations, but the building remains sufficiently intact to be important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a regional town hall and municipal chambers of the interwar period, designed in a classically derived style. It is a fine example of the public work of Rockhampton architect Roy Chipps. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Located on a corner block in the main street of Gladstone, the building has strong streetscape presence and townscape value. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is valued by the local community for its strong association with municipal government and community activities and entertainments since the 1930s, for its present role as the town's principal repository of Gladstone's history, and for its aesthetic value.

Background  He was born in Cork city, the eldest son of Edward Worth, who was Dean of Cork 1645-1660 and subsequently Bishop of Killaloe 1661-1669, and his wife Susanna Pepper, daughter of Dennis Pepper of County Mayo, a cousin of the Earl of Cork.Ball p.358 His brother John continued the family's clerical tradition by becoming Dean of Kildare, and later Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. The Worths were a Cheshire family who had settled in County Cork in the sixteenth century: William's grandfather James was the first vicar of Newmarket, County Cork. William's father the Bishop has been described as an exceptionally adroit political player, who worked closely with the Cromwellian regime, and enjoyed the friendship of Henry Cromwell, yet re-emerged after the Restoration of Charles II with his reputation as a staunch Royalist more or less intact. His political influence was considerable in the late 1650s, but declined sharply after 1660. Career  William went to the University of Dublin, where he matriculated in 1661. He entered the Middle Temple in 1665 and the King's Inn in 1667. He was called to the Bar in 1669 and became Recorder of Cork in 1678. He was appointed Attorney General of the County Palatine of Tipperary in 1681, and second Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in the same year. His staunchly Protestant background was no doubt a recommendation for high office, at a time when the tolerant attitude towards Roman Catholicism which had existed in Ireland since the Restoration of Charles II had been destroyed in the anti-Catholic hysteria engendered by the Popish Plot. His mother was a Quaker, who was arrested in 1664 for attending a Quaker meeting, but her husband's outraged reaction when he learned of this is sufficient evidence of his own Protestant beliefs. His parents were estranged, and never reconciled: his father in his last will and testament referred grimly to his mother's \\"fallen ( i.e. sinful) condition\\", and urged her to perform her \\"first act\\" (i.e. of repentance). As a strong Protestant, William was naturally assumed to be a supporter of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and after the arrival of the Roman Catholic King James II of England in Ireland in 1689 he was removed from office. Unlike some of his judicial colleagues (like Sir John Lyndon, who was detained when he tried to flee from Ireland) Worth was given leave to go to England. On his return to Ireland he sought reappointment as a Baron of the Exchequer, and is later said to have lobbied to be appointed as Lord Chancellor of Ireland, but to no avail.Ball His failure to secure reappointment is perhaps surprising, since other Protestant High Court judges who had been removed from the Bench by James II, including Sir John Lyndon and Sir Standish Hartstonge, 1st Baronet, returned to their former positions. He spent some time managing the estates of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde. He was a man of considerable wealth, and a generous benefactor of his old University. He had a town house at Aungier Street in Dublin; he also had a house at Rathfarnham (then in the countryside, now a suburb of south Dublin) and another at nearby Oldbawn, which he probably acquired from his second wife's family, the Tyntes, who are recorded as its earlier owners. Family He was married four times: his marital career is unusual in that his third and fourth wives were respectively the widows of a father and son. His first wife was Alicia, daughter of William Barnet, of Yoxford in Sussex, by whom he had a son, Edward. He married secondly Mabel, daughter of Sir Henry Tynte of Ballycrenane, County Cork, and his wife Mabel Smythe, by whom he had a second son, James. He married thirdly about 1687, Dorothy, daughter of Henry Whitfield MP and his wife Hester Temple, and widow of Sir Richard Bulkeley, 1st Baronet; she died in 1705. His fourth wife was Lucy Downing. daughter of the eminent statesman Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet and his wife Frances Howard; she was also, rather strangely by modern standards, the widow of Dorothy's stepson, Sir Richard Bulkeley, 2nd Baronet. Worth's fourth marriage was short-lived: Lucy died in October 1711, only 18 months after her first husband. Worth died in 1721 and was buried in the family tomb in St. Patrick's Cathedral. He left a considerable bequest to his nephew Edward Worth, the physician and noted book collector. Sources *Ball, F.

Following a resurgence of interest in 1980s and '90s British video game development, the company crowdfunded and produced four art books: an oral history of that Britsoft era, two books on British developers Sensible Software and The Bitmap Brothers, and a definitive volume on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, for which the publisher became best known. Read-Only Memory's books are archival anthologies, including original design documents juxtaposed with developer interviews and high-quality prints of in-game graphics. Reviewers were particularly impressed with each book's breadth of unreleased concepts.  History and publications  The 30th anniversary of the ZX Spectrum home computer in 2012 generated renewed interest in Britsofta \\"golden era\\" of British video game development, particularly in the 1980s and '90s, little publicised outside Britain. Between games republished on digital platforms like Steam, re-releases for mobile platforms, and related crowdfunding projects through Kickstarter, coverage of British games development was brought closer to parity with the coverage of Japanese and American game developers. Through its Kickstarter projects, Read-Only Memory grew as a British publisher of art books on topics of video game history and culture. Kiyonori Muroga, the editor-in-chief of Japanese graphic design magazine Idea, highlighted Read-Only Memory in 2015 as performing groundbreaking art book design work with exceptional product quality. In late 2013, graphic designer Darren Wall released an art book about the history of British developer Sensible Software. Funded through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter and written by games journalist Gary Penn of Zzap!64, Sensible Software 1986‚Äì1999 is a 340-page anthology of the company's full catalogue, from its popular 16-bit games (e.g. Sensible Soccer, Cannon Fodder, Wizball) to its lesser-known products and features. It also explains the personalities behind the company, mainly its founders Jon Hare and Chris Yates, through long-form interviews. Hare was elated when Wall originally contacted him about the project, but Yates, who has been estranged from Hare since 2003, did not participate. Hare explained the company's issues with scaling and hiring, and how the company was slow to transition to 3D graphics. Other commentators featured in the book include developer and entrepreneur David Darling, television personality Dominik Diamond, musician Martin Galway, and games journalist Gary Whitta. Wall designed Sensible Software 1986‚Äì1999 in the style of an art monograph, with full pages of in-game art, concept art, and other visual assets. Each major game received its own chapter. As part of his design process, Wall personally revisited the company's catalogue to capture screenshots. The project had an immediate response during its 2012 Kickstarter campaign, and met its goal of $30,000 to begin production. Reviewers were impressed by the details of the company's unreleased concepts. Kotaku praised the volume and its breadth of personnel interviewed, though Metro wrote the absence of Sensible co-founder Yates was conspicuous. Still, the book did not appear to be one-sided. Nintendo Life called the book \\"an absolutely essential read\\" for those interested in 1990s Britsoft. The book was made available on the website of Read-Only Memory, Wall's new publishing imprint.  Sega Mega Drive/Genesis: Collected Works  Read-Only Memory released its next art book in late 2014. Sega Mega Drive/Genesis: Collected Works covers the development, life, and legacy of Sega's 16-bit console. The 352-page book sought to be the \\"definitive volume\\" on the console. It was officially licensed by Sega and contains about 30 interviews with former team members and documentary production artwork from both classic and lesser-known games. Its interview subjects include former Sega president Hayao Nakayama, former Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske, and developers such as Greg Johnson (Toejam & Earl), Yu Suzuki (OutRun), and Yuji Naka (Sonic). Its illustrations and fold-out pages include in-game pixel art, character concepts, storyboards, and other design documents. The publisher was given \\"unprecedented access\\" to Sega's archives, where they found new technical drawings, concepts, and alternative designs. The book contains an essay by The Guardian games journalist Keith Stuart, and its foreword was written by games journalist Dave Perry. The publisher presented Sega with a mock-up of the book and its potential design and content. Sega liked the focus on the 16-bit console, approved the project, and offered access to their developers and archives in Japan. Wall described himself as \\"a die-hard Mega Drive fan\\" and was thrilled to see Sega's archival findings. Read-Only Memory ran a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in November 2013 to fund the book's publication. Supporters received perks including archival prints from Sonic the Hedgehog character designer Naoto Ohshima. Upon doubling the project's funding goal, Wall and Read-Only Memory announced additional interviews and content to be included. The campaign ultimately raised over three times its goal: . The campaign also propelled Sega management from the period to offer their aid. A.V. Club called it \\"a classy, beautiful tome\\" with new treasures in each read. Kotaku reviewer echoed those terms and said the book was among the best he had read in the video game genre, from its coffee table book quality to its breadth of archival content. He reserved particular praise for the included design documentation of Streets of Rage and Gunstar Heroes, which included hand-drawn notes and level design sketches. The German Eurogamer wrote that the book had little to criticize apart from its paucity of detail on the console's technical aspects. Nintendo Life found the book flawless, as both accessible and interesting to newcomers as well as \\"every Sega fan's dream come true\\". Read-Only Memory editor-in- chief Darren Wall told The Guardian how crowdfunders shared their experiences and opinions of the book on Twitter, which generated significant traffic to the publisher's website.  Britsoft and Bitmap Brothers  Read-Only Memory published Britsoft: An Oral History in 2015 and The Bitmap Brothers: Universe in 2016, both about a golden age of British game development. Britsoft: An Oral History was designed as a companion to the 2014 film From Bedrooms to Billions, which covers the \\"Britsoft\\" era of British game development from the late '70s bedroom developer cottage industry to the present-day billion-pound industry. The book uses developer interviews to tell the era's story so as to supplement rather than reproduce the film's narrative. Interviewed developers include coders and designers David Braben, Geoff Crammond, Mel Croucher, Dino Dini, Jon Hare, Archer MacLean, Jeff Minter, Peter Molyneux and David Perry, businessman David Darling, and writers Chris Anderson, Gary Penn, and Julian Rignall. The book's editor and former Edge editor, Alex Wiltshire, divides the title into eight sections: the developers' initial exposure to video games, the first wave as it attempts to sell its software in the early 1980s, the industry that begins to form, the wealth that comes to the industry, the relationship between these developers and a burgeoning games journalism, the transition from home computers to 16-bit hardware, the coalescing of industry and closure of small businesses, and the late 1990s dispersion as these developers left the industry or moved to less prominent roles in the United States. The book is designed to be read linearly and out of order, based on its presentation as anecdotal snippets rather than long text blocks. It also features linked page numbering such that readers can skip directly to the developer's next page. Reviewers described the 422-page volume by its heft, comprehensiveness, and academicism. Eurogamer and The Verge recommended the book for readers interested in the era as well as readers interested in artistic production. Nintendo Life described the book as lavish, lush, and pleasurable. Reviewers lightly criticised the book's lack of signposted introductions to the many characters, and complained of needing to flip to the appendix for explanatory footnotes and captions for the book's personalities and illustrations. Eurogamer considered the book to come as close to a definitive history of British gaming as is feasible, and praised the book's intimate and fun tone on otherwise dry subject matter. The second book was published on the subject of The Bitmap Brothers, a prominent British developer known for games such as Speedball, Xenon, and The Chaos Engine. Written by games journalist Duncan Harris, the 360-page book covers the developer's catalogue alongside concept art and interviews with its personnel. It features information about the developer's unfinished games and possible sequels. An interview with Sega's Tetsuya Mizuguchi spoke to the developer's influence, and musicians Tim Simenon and John Foxx discussed the role of music in the developer's games. Patrons who crowdfunded the project on Kickstarter received rewards including signed copies of the book and art prints. Monocle and Kotaku UK praised the book's content and beauty, while Nintendo Life reviewer praised the book's anecdotes and recommended the title for readers interested in the history of British games. In late 2017, Read-Only Memory partnered with Polygon to publish the website's oral history of Final Fantasy 7 with Kickstarter crowdfunding. The book, 500 Years Later: An Oral History of Final Fantasy 7, adds new illustrations, additional standalone interviews, and a foreword by the creator of the Final Fantasy series.

Both nations are members of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.  History  Due to a vast distance between Afghanistan and Mexico, relations between the two nations never developed into one of high priority. Both nations established diplomatic relations with each other on the 27 June 1961. Since then, bilateral relations between both nations are mainly conducted in international forums such as at the United Nations. In 1962, Mexico accredited its first ambassador to Afghanistan, resident in New Delhi, India. The ambassador was Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz. During Paz's time as ambassador in India, he kept a journal of his travels to Afghanistan writing about his journey from New Delhi to Kabul and his experiences and he documented presenting his credentials to former Afghan King Mohammed Zahir Shah. Paz turned his journal into a book called \\"Viento Entero.\\" From 1980-1981, Mexico was on the United Nations Security Council and voted in favor of Resolution 462 condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Resolution was adopted. When Mexico was again a member of the UN Security Council from 2002-2003; it voted on numerous occasions in favor of maintaining Afghanistan's independence and sovereignty of the country (Resolution 1444 and Resolution 1453) and extending the UN Assistance Mission mandate in the country (Resolution 1471). From 2009-2010, Mexico again as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council voted in favor of UN Resolution 1868 and UN Resolution 1890. Since the beginning of the U.S led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001; many Afghan migrants have travelled to Mexico in order to enter the United States.
