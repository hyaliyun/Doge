Built in 1861, it served the town as a school until it was damaged by fire in 1951, but remains a community landmark. It is now owned by the local historical society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. Description and history The District No. 5 Schoolhouse is located a short way east of the village center of Underhill, on the south side of Pleasant Valley Road at its junction with Stevensville Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is three bays wide, with an entrance topped by a modest corniced entablature. Windows are set on both levels of the outer bays, trimmed by simple moulding. The building has plain cornerboards, and the gable ends have short returns. A flagpole is mounted at the center of the gable, rising above the roof ridgeline. The school was built in 1861, as a single-story structure, and was the third school building to stand on the site. Of the town's fifteen district schools, it is now the only surviving one still in public hands. The building's second story was added in 1915, and it served as a school until a fire in its wood stove caused significant interior damage. The building was thereafter used by the town for storage and as a garage, adding a garage door to the front. In 1983, the building was taken over by the local historical society, which undertook a partial restoration of the building to its early 20th-century appearance. Because the restoration was not completed, the building again deteriorated, and a renewed drive is underway to make it fully usable as a community space.

Hojjati, and J.-P. Immarigeon, Fusion Bonding/Welding of Thermoplastic Composites. Journal of THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITE MATERIALS, 2004. 17(4) p. 303-341. Thermoplastic composites also have the ability to be formed and reformed, repaired and fusion welded.  Fusion bonding fundamentals  Fusion bonding is a category of techniques for welding thermoplastic composites. It requires the melting of the joint interface, which decreases the viscosity of the polymer and allows for intermolecular diffusion. These polymer chains then diffuse across the joint interface and become entangled, giving the joint its strength.  Welding techniques  There are many welding techniques that can be used to fusion bond thermoplastic composites. These different techniques can be broken down into three classifications for their ways of generating heat; frictional heating, external heating and electromagnetic heating. Some of these techniques can be very limited and only used for specific joints and geometries. = Friction welding = Friction welding is best used for parts that are small and flat. The welding equipment is often expensive, but produces high-quality welds.  Linear vibration welding  Two flat parts are brought together under pressure with one fixed in place and the other vibrating back-and-forth parallel to the joint. Frictional heat is then generated till the polymers are softened or melted. Once the desired temperature is met, the vibration motion stops, the polymer solidifies and a weld joint is made. The two most important welding parameters that affect the mechanical performance are welding pressure and time. Developing parameters for different advance thermoplastic composite can be challenging because the high elastic modulus of the material will have a higher heat generation, requiring less weld time. The pressure can affect the fiber orientation which also greatly impact the mechanical performance. Lap shear joints tend to have the best mechanical performance from the higher volume fraction of fibers at the weld interface. Overall linear vibration welding can achieve high production rates with excellent strength, but is limited to the joint geometries that are flat.  Spin welding  Spin welding is not a very common welding technique for advanced thermoplastic composites because this can only be done with parts that have a circular geometry. This is done by one part remaining stationary while the other is continuously rotated with pressure applied to the weld interface. Rotational velocity will vary throughout different radii of the Interface. This will result in a temperature gradient as a function of the radius, resulting in different shrinkage for the fibers causing high residual stresses. The orientation of the fibers will also contribute to high residual stress and reduction in strength.  Ultrasonic welding  Ultrasonics welding is one of the most commonly used technique for welding advanced thermoplastic composites. This is due for its ability to maintain high weld strength, hermetic sealing, and high production rates. This welding technique operates at high vibrational frequencies (10-70 kHz)Liu, S. , Chang, I. and Hung, S. (2001), Factors affecting the joint strength of ultrasonically welded polypropylene composites. Polym Compos, 22: 132-141. doi:10.1002/pc.10525 and low amplitude. The direction of vibration is perpendicular to the joint surface, but can also be parallel to the joint for hermetic application. Heat is generated from the surface and intermolecular friction due to the vibrational. On the surface of the joint there are small asperities called energy directors, where the vibrational energy concentrates and induces melting. Design of the energy director and optimized parameters can be critical to improve the quality of the weld to reducing any fiber disruption during welding. Energy directors that are triangular or semi-circle often achieve the highest strength. With optimize welding parameters and joint design weld strength, up to 80% of the base material can be retained for advanced thermoplastic compositesBenatar, A. and T.G. Gutowski, Method for fusion bonding thermoplastic composites. SAMPE Q.;(United States), 1986. 18(1).. However, welding can cause damage to the fibers, which will result in premature failure. Ultrasonic welding of advanced thermoplastic composites is used for making automotive parts, medical devices and battery housing. = Thermal welding = Thermal welding can produce good weld quality although extra precautions need to be taken to prevent high residual stress, warping, and decohesion. Other thermal welding techniques are not commonly used due their high heat input, which can damage the composite. = Laser welding = Laser welding of advanced thermoplastic composites is a process by which the LASER (Light Amplification of Simulated Emission of electromagnetic Radiation), a highly focused coherent beam of light melts the composite tin various ways. Taking advantage of joint design and material properties, lasers can be applied either directly or indirectly to create the welded joint. There are processing methods that take advantage of material structure/properties to create the weld joint. Welding variables affect weld quality in both positive and negative ways depending on how they are manipulated.  Laser heating mechanism in matter  When a laser beam impinges on a material, it excites electrons in the outer most shell of the atom. The return of those electrons to the relaxed state induces thermal heating through conversion to vibrational states which propagate to the surrounding material.  Joining methods for laser welding  = Surface heating = This method involves using infrared radiation to heat the surfaces the composites to be welded and then clamping until and holding the parts together. = IR/Laser stacking = This method involves laser melting a polymer post and pressing a die into the molten post to create a rivet-like button to joint materials like metals. This process can be used to join metallic joints to composite structures. = Through Transmission IR welding (TTIr) = This method utilizes one laser transparent (LT) and one laser absorbing (LA) material. Typically, the components are layered as a sandwich with the laser beam passing through the LT layer and irradiating the surface of the LA. This creates a melt layer at the interface of two components leading to a weld.  Effect of Constituent Properties on Weldability  To understand how the properties of a composite affect is weldability, the effects of the individual constituents (fiber, matrix, additives, etc.) need to be understood. The effect of each will be noted separately and then the combined effects will be discussed. = Matrix =  Electromagnetic radiation interaction  A laser beam can interact in one of three ways when it contacts the polymer matrix. It can be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected. The amount of absorption determines the amount of energy available for welding. The reflectivity is affected by the index of refraction according to this relation: R=\\\\frac{(n-m)^2}{(n+m)^2}, where n is the index of refraction of the polymer and m is the index of refraction of air.. Absorption can be affected by the following structural characteristics of the polymer to be discussed below: crystallinity, chemical bonding, and concentration of additives.  Crystallinity  Increased crystallinity tends to cause lower laser beam transmission because of scattering caused by changes in the index of refraction encountered when going from one phase to the next or because of changing crystallographic orientation. Increased crystallinity can cause the transmission to increase monotonically as a function of polymer thickness. The relationship follows the Lambert-Bouuger's Law: I_t=I_0e^{-(\\\\alpha t)}, where I_t is the intensity of the laser beam at a given depth or thickness, t. I_0 is the intensity of laser beam at its source. \\\\alpha is the absorption constant of the polymer. By the same token, amorphous polymers lack this trend with thickness.  Chemical bonding  Polymers absorb EMR (Electro Magnetic Radiation) in a specific wavelength of light depending on what functional groups are present on the polymer. For instance, bending of the C-H bond on the -CH_2- at 6800 nm. Many polymers have vibrational modes at wavelengths greater than 1100 nm, so to apply methods such as TTIr, laser sources must produce photons at wavelengths shorter than that. Therefore, Nd:YAG lasers (1064 nm) and diode lasers (800-950 nm) can pass through the LT until they impinge on the intended modified polymer or additive that results in absorption, whereas CO_2 lasers (10,640 nm) will be absorbed too easily as it passes through the LT. = Reinforcements = Reinforcements such as fibers or short particles. Reinforcing fibers can be added to increase the strength of a composite. Some reinforcements like carbon fibers have high thermal conductivity and can dissipate the heat of welding, thus requiring more energy input than with other reinforcement materials such as glass. Glass reinforcements can cause scattering of the beam. The orientation of the continuous fibers can affect the width of welds being made. When the welding direction is parallel to the orientation of the fibers, the weld width is usually narrower due to heat being channeled through the fibers to the front and the rear of the weld. Increased volume fraction of reinforcements such as glass can scatter the laser beam, thus allowing less to be transmitted to the weld joint. When this happens, the amount of energy necessary to fuse the joint may increase. The increase if not done carefully can cause damage to the transparent part of a TTIr weld joint. = Additives and Fillers = Some additives can be intentionally added to absorb laser energy. This technique is especially useful in concentrating the weld joint to the mated surfaces of two materials that are relatively transparent to the laser beam. For example, carbon black increases absorption of the laser beam. There can be some unintended consequences of using these absorbing additives. Increasing the concentration of carbon black in a polymer can decrease the depth of heating and increase the peak temperature at the weld joint. Surface damage can occur if the concentration of carbon black becomes excessive. Some additives such as the highly selective materials used in the Clearweld process are applied only to the mating surfaces between the plastics to be joined. Some of the chemicals such as cyanines only absorb in a narrow wavelength band centered around 785 nm. This methodology initially was applied only to plastics, but has recently been applied to composites such as carbon fiber reinforced PEEK. Other additives called clarifiers can do the opposite of carbon black by increasing laser beam transmission by reducing crystallinity in polymers. Despite the fact that both pigments and dyes can both add color to a polymer, they behave differently. A dye is soluble in a polymer, whereas a pigment is not.  Welding technique comparisons  = Contour Welding (CW) vs quasi- simultaneous (QS) = During TTIr, although it takes more energy per unit length to achieve fusion with QS than with CW, QS offers the advantage of achieving higher weld strength and weldability of low transmissive materials such as continuous glass fiber thermoplastics. Greater strength is imparted because full fusion is achieved without damaging the surface of the transparent material. = Electromagnetic welding = Electromagnetic welding is capable of welding complex parts with also the possibility of reopening welds for replacement or repair. To achieve good welds the design of the coil and implant is important for uniform heating.  Implant resistance welding  Implant resistance welding can be a low cost solution for welding parts that are flat or with curved surfaces. The heating element used is often a metal mesh or carbon strips, which provides uniform heating. However, advanced thermoplastic composites that contain conductive fibers can‚Äôt be used due to unwanted power leakages.  Implant induction welding  Induction welding uses a implant or susceptor that is placed at the weld interface and embedded with conductive material such as metal or carbon fibers. An induction coil is then place near the weld joint, which induces a current in embedded in the material used to generate heat. When welding carbon fiber, carbon and graphite fiber mats with higher electrical resistance are used to concentrate the heat at the weld interface. This has the ability to weld complex geometry structures with great weld strength. = Challenges of welding advanced thermoplastic composites = The heat generated during welding thermoplastic composite, induces residual stresses in the joint. These stresses can greatly reduce the strength and performance of the part. Upon cooling from welding the matrix and fibers will have different coefficients of thermal expansion, which introduces the residual stress. Things such as heat input, cooling rates, volume fraction of the fibers, and matrix material will influence the residual stress. Another important factor to consider is the orientation of the fibers. During the molten state of welding, fibers can reorient themselves in a manner that reduces weld strength. = Advanced thermoplastic composites commonly used for welding = * Carbon fiber polyetherimide (CF/PEI) * Carbon fiber polyphenylene sulfide (CF/PPS) * Carbon fiber polyetheretherketone (CF/PEEK)  References  Category:Welding Category:Materials science ","title":"Welding of advanced thermoplastic composites"},{"id":"57216567","text":"Tropiphorus terricola is a species of broad-nosed weevil in the beetle family Curculionidae.

Born in Reedsville, Wisconsin, to parents Harriet and John Garrey, George Garrey grew up in Stockbridge and Wausau before his family moved to Aurora, Illinois, where he graduated from West Aurora High School. He then entered the University of Chicago, where he played on the football and basketball teams for three years, and earned a bachelor's degree in 1900. From 1898 to 1900 he taught science at West Aurora High School, and in the summer of 1900, accompanied by Eliot Blackwelder, he worked with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in western Montana, northern Idaho, and eastern Washington. This work was used as the basis for his master's degree in geology from the University of Chicago, conferred in 1902. Carrey was an assistant coach for the 1902 Chicago Maroons football team. In 1904 he received the degree in mining engineering from the Michigan College of Mines, and joined the USGS as an economic geologist to assist Josiah Edward Spurr. In 1906 Garrey resigned from the USGS to act as first assistant to Spurr, who then held the position of chief geologist to the American Smelting and Refining Company (Asarco) and allied companies. In 1911 Garrey became chief geologist for Asarco, the American Smelters Securities Co., the Guggenheim Exploration Co., and the allied companies. As this involved examination of mines in Mexico at various periods of the Madero and Huerta revolutions, Garrey and the engineers who were assisting him underwent some trying times and upon two occasions had difficulty in getting out of Mexico. Early in 1914 he again opened an office as consulting mining geologist and engineer, and continued on this general consulting work until 1916, when he accepted the position of consulting geologist and engineer in charge of the exploration department of the Tonopah Belmont Development Co. This work involved the examination of numerous mining properties presented for purchase and also the outlining of development work for the company and its subsidiaries. He was a member of the Mining and Metallurgical Society of America, American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, Society of Economic Geologists, Washington Academy of Science, and the Geological Society of Washington.

It is taken by mouth. Estetrol is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. Due to its estrogenic activity, estetrol has antigonadotropic effects and can inhibit fertility and suppress sex hormone production and levels in both women and men. Estetrol differs in various ways both from other natural estrogens like estradiol and from synthetic estrogens like ethinylestradiol, with implications for tolerability and safety. For instance, it appears to have minimal estrogenic effects in the breasts and liver. Due to its unique tissue-selective effects, estetrol has been described as a natural selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Estetrol was first discovered in 1965, and basic research continued up until 1984. It started to be studied again as well as investigated for potential medical use in 2001, and by 2008, was of major interest for possible medical use. As of 2018, estetrol is in mid- to late-stage clinical development for a variety of indications. anticipates the launch of Donesta and PeriNesta by the end of 2023. Medical uses Estetrol is under development for use alone for a variety of indications with the tentative brand name Donesta. Applications include hormonal contraception and menopausal hormone therapy among others. As of June 2018, it is in phase II clinical trials for pregnancy prevention and the treatment of atrophic vaginitis, vasomotor symptoms, osteoarthritis, hormonal contraception, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, while it is in phase I clinical studies for the treatment of migraine. It was also under development for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, multiple sclerosis, and Sj√∂gren syndrome, but development for these indications was discontinued. In addition to a single-drug formulation, estetrol is under development in combination with the progestin drospirenone for use as a birth control pill to prevent pregnancy with the tentative brand name Estelle. Drospirenone is also a potent antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogen in addition to progestogen, and in relation to this, is said to have a progesterone-like medication profile. As of April 2018, estetrol/drospirenone are in phase III clinical trials for pregnancy prevention. Estetrol has been studied in humans at oral doses of 0.1 to 100 mg. Dosages of between 2 and 40 mg/day estetrol have been studied in postmenopausal women and found to be effective in the alleviation of menopausal symptoms. Contraindications General contraindications of estrogens include breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and others. Side effects Minimal side effects have been observed with estetrol in women. In men, decreased libido (in 40%) and nipple tenderness (in 35%) have been observed with high-dose (20‚Äì40 mg/day) estetrol for four weeks. The medication poses a risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer in women similarly to other estrogens. As such, it is necessary to combine estetrol with a progestogen in women with intact uteruses to prevent such risks. Overdose High single doses of estetrol of 100 mg have been studied in women and were found to be well-tolerated. Estetrol has been said to be only 10 to 20 times less potent orally than the highly potent estrogen ethinylestradiol. During pregnancy, estetrol levels increase to high concentrations of about 723 pg/mL on average in the mother and about 9,034 pg/mL on average in the fetus (measured via umbilical cord blood) by term. Estetrol levels are 10 to 20 times higher in the fetal circulation than in the maternal circulation (which is a consequence of the fact that estetrol is produced exclusively in the fetal liver). The production of high amounts of estetrol during pregnancy suggests that it may be a reasonably safe compound at such concentrations. Interactions Estetrol shows minimal to no inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes. In addition, estetrol undergoes minimal to no metabolism, aside from conjugation. As such, estetrol is expected to harbor a low risk for drug interactions. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Estetrol is an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs), and hence is an estrogen. It has moderate affinity for the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, with Ki values of 4.9 nM and 19 nM, respectively. As such, estetrol has 4- to 5-fold preference for the ERŒ± over the ERŒ≤. For comparison, the potent nonsteroidal estrogen diethylstilbestrol showed higher affinities for the ERs, with Ki values of 0.286 nM for the ERŒ± and 0.199 nM for the ERŒ≤. Similarly, estetrol has low affinity for the ERs relative to estradiol, and both estetrol and the related estrogen estriol require substantially higher concentrations than estradiol to produce similar effects to estradiol. The affinity of estetrol for the ERs is about 0.3% (rat) to 6.25% (human) of that of estradiol, and its in vivo potency in animals is about 2 to 3% of that of estradiol. In women, estetrol has been found to be approximately 10 to 20 times less potent orally than ethinylestradiol, the most potent oral estrogen available. The high oral potency of estetrol in women in spite of relatively low affinity for the ERs is related to its high metabolic stability and favorable pharmacokinetics. Estetrol shows high selectivity for the ERs. It showed only 11 to 15% occupation of the androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors at a very high concentration of 10 ŒºM. In addition, estetrol showed no affinity (>10 ŒºM) for a set of 124 receptors and enzymes, with the sole exception of very weak affinity for the Œ±1B-adrenergic receptor (23% inhibition of prazosin binding at a concentration of 10 ŒºM). Due to its high selectivity for the ERs, estetrol is anticipated to have a low risk of undesirable off-target activity and associated side effects. Furthermore, estetrol showed no inhibition of the major cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 at a very high concentration of 10 ŒºM, unlike estradiol and ethinylestradiol. Conversely, estetrol moderately stimulated CYP3A4 (by 23%), while estradiol strongly stimulated CYP3A4 (by 83%) and ethinylestradiol moderately inhibited the enzyme (by 45%). These findings suggest that estetrol has a low potential for drug interactions, including a lower potential than estradiol and particularly ethinylestradiol. Differences from other estrogens Estetrol has potent estrogenic effects in bone, vagina, uterus (both myometrium and endometrium), arteries, and certain areas of the brain like the pituitary gland and hypothalamus (in terms of hot flash relief, antigonadotropic effects, and ovulation inhibition). It has comparable efficacy to ethinylestradiol on bone turnover and hot flashes and to estradiol valerate on vaginal atrophy. In addition, estetrol has stimulatory effects on the endometrium and poses a risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer similarly to other estrogens. Conversely, the effects of estetrol in certain other tissues such as breast/mammary gland, liver, vascular tissue, and various brain areas differ, with weakly estrogenic or even antiestrogenic effects occurring in such tissues. Based on its mixed effects in different tissues, estetrol has been described as a unique, \\"natural\\" selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) rather than as a \\"weak estrogen.\\" Estetrol is weakly estrogenic in breast/mammary gland, but shows very low potency in this tissue and, when administered in combination with estradiol, antagonizes the effects of estradiol. Relative to estradiol, estetrol shows 100-fold lower potency in stimulation of the proliferation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro and of mouse mammary gland cells in vivo. In animal models, estetrol shows antiestrogenic effects in mammary gland tissue comparable to those of the SERM tamoxifen and of ovariectomy, antagonizing the stimulatory effects of estradiol and preventing tumor development in a 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) mammary tumor model. As such, it is anticipated that estetrol may cause minimal proliferation of breast tissue and that it may be useful in the treatment of breast cancer. Estetrol has relatively minimal effects on liver function. In contrast to estradiol and ethinylestradiol, estetrol does not stimulate the hepatic production of SHBG in vitro. In addition, it has been found to produce minimal changes in liver protein synthesis in women relative to ethinylestradiol, including production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), angiotensinogen (AGT), ceruloplasmin, cholesterol, triglycerides, estrogen-sensitive coagulation proteins, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs). In a clinical study, 10 mg/day estetrol showed only 15 to 20% of the increase of 20 Œºg/day ethinylestradiol on SHBG and AGT levels (both dosages being oral contraceptive dosages). For comparison, it has been reported that a dosage of estradiol that is of similar potency to ethinylestradiol in terms of suppression and hot flash relief possesses about 25% of the potency of ethinylestradiol on SHBG increase and about 35% of the potency of ethinylestradiol on AGT increase. Estetrol has shown only a minor effect on hemostatic biomarkers, including both on coagulation and fibrinolysis. Due to its minimal influence on liver function, estetrol may have a lower risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and other undesirable side effects. This is notable, as VTE is a serious adverse effect of all known estrogens as well as synthetic SERMs (e.g., tamoxifen). Also, oral estrogens like ethinylestradiol are associated with a reduction in lean body mass due to suppression of hepatic IGF-1 production, and this may not be expected with estetrol. Estetrol has potent estrogenic effects in the brain in terms of relief of hot flashes, antigonadotropic effects, and ovulation inhibition. However, animal studies on the effects of estetrol on levels of allopregnanolone and Œ≤-endorphin in various brain areas have shown weak estrogenic effects when given alone and antiestrogenic effects in the presence of estradiol, suggesting that estetrol may have SERM-like effects in some regions of the brain. Estetrol has mixed effects in the vascular system similarly. It has been found to have estrogenic effects on atheroma prevention in arteries (and hence might be expected to have beneficial effects on atherosclerosis), but has antiestrogenic effects against estradiol-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation and acceleration of endothelial healing. Antigonadotropic effects Administration of single doses of estetrol to postmenopausal women strongly suppressed secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), demonstrating potent antigonadotropic effects. Levels of LH were not suppressed by a dose of 0.1 or 1 mg, were slightly suppressed by a dose of 10 mg, and were profoundly suppressed by a dose of 100 mg (by a maximum of 48% 4-hours post-dose). A profound and sustained inhibition of FSH levels (by a maximum of 41% 48-hours post-dose), lasting up to a week, was found with a 100 mg dose of estetrol (other doses were not assessed). The antigonadotropic effects of estetrol result in inhibition of ovulation and hence are involved in its hormonal contraceptive effects in women. In addition, the antigonadotropic effects of estetrol cause suppression of gonadal sex hormone production. In healthy men, 40 mg/day estetrol suppressed total testosterone levels by 60% and estradiol levels by 62% when measured by day 28 of administration. In another study of healthy men, testosterone levels were suppressed with estetrol therapy by 28% at 20 mg/day, by 60% at 40 mg/day, and by 76% at 60 mg/day after 4 weeks. Suppression of testosterone levels is the primary basis for the use of estetrol in the treatment of prostate cancer. =Pharmacokinetics= Estetrol levels following a single dose of different doses of oral estetrol (E4) in postmenopausal women. Estetrol shows high oral bioavailability. Its oral bioavailability in rats was 70% relative to subcutaneous injection. The high oral bioavailability of estetrol is in contrast to estradiol, estrone, and estriol (all very low, in the range of 5% and below), but is more similar to ethinylestradiol (38‚Äì48%). Estetrol shows a high and linear dose‚Äìresponse relationship across oral doses of 0.1 to 100 mg in humans, and shows low interindividual variability. Upon oral administration, estetrol is very rapidly absorbed, with maximal levels occurring within 15 to 80 minutes. At a dosage of 20 mg/day estetrol, peak levels of estetrol of 3,490 pg/mL and trough levels of 2,005 pg/mL have been reported. The high water solubility of estetrol makes it optimal for passage of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, and the drug may be expected to have effects in the central nervous system. In accordance, estetrol shows clear central effects such as alleviation of hot flashes and antigonadotropic effects in humans. In terms of plasma protein binding, estetrol is bound moderately to albumin, and is not bound to SHBG. This is in contrast to estradiol, which binds to SHBG with high affinity, but is similar to estriol and ethinylestradiol, which have only very low affinity for SHBG. Due to its lack of affinity for SHBG, the plasma distribution or availability for target tissues of estetrol is not limited or otherwise influenced by SHBG. Estetrol is metabolized slowly and minimally, and is not transformed into other estrogens such as estradiol, estrone, or estriol. This is related to the fact that estetrol is already an end-stage product of phase I estrogen metabolism in humans. The medication is conjugated via glucuronidation and to a lesser extent via sulfation. The biological half-life of estetrol is about 28 hours, with a range of 18 to 60 hours. The blood half-lives of estradiol and estriol, at about 1 to 2 hours and 20 minutes, respectively, are far shorter than that of estetrol, whereas the biological half-life of ethinylestradiol, at approximately 20 hours, is more similar to that of estetrol. Enterohepatic recirculation may occur with estetrol, similarly to other steroidal estrogens, although it has also been reported that estetrol does not seem to enter the enterohepatic circulation. Estetrol is excreted mostly or completely in urine, virtually entirely in the form of conjugates (unconjugated accounting for 0.2‚Äì0.7%). In one study, a median of 79.7% (range 61.1‚Äì99.0%) was recovered from urine; this was primarily as estetrol glucuronide (median 60.7%, range 47.6‚Äì77.2%), and, to a lesser extent, as estetrol sulfate (median 17.6%, range 13.2‚Äì22.1%). Chemistry Estetrol, also known as 15Œ±-hydroxyestriol or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,15Œ±,16Œ±,17Œ≤-tetrol, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid and a derivative of estrin (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene). It has four hydroxyl groups, which is the basis for its abbreviation of E4. For comparison, estriol (E3) has three hydroxyl groups, estradiol (E2) has two hydroxyl groups, and estrone (E1) has one hydroxyl group and one ketone. =Synthesis= Chemical syntheses of estetrol have been published. History Estetrol was discovered in 1965 by Egon Diczfalusy and coworkers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, via isolation from the urine of pregnant women. Basic research on estetrol was conducted from 1965 to 1984. It was established that estetrol is exclusively synthesized in the fetal liver and hence that it is a fetal estrogen. By 1984, estetrol was regarded as a weak estrogen; interest fell, and research was virtually abandoned. Subsequently, a project at Pantarhei Bioscience was started to investigate estetrol with state-of-the-art technologies in 2001, with the sole reasoning that estetrol must have some biological role or function of importance as it would not be produced in such high quantities in the fetus otherwise. By 2008, estetrol was of major interest for potential clinical use, and development was in-progress. As of 2018, it is in mid- to late-stage clinical development for a variety of indications. It was initially developed by Pantarhei Bioscience and Estetra SA (subsequently renamed Estetra SPRL), and is now being developed by Mithra Pharmaceuticals. Society and culture =Generic names= Estetrol is the generic name of the drug and its .http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s23133en/s23133en.pdf =Brand names= Estetrol has the tentative brand names Donesta as a single-drug formulation and Estelle in combination with drospirenone. =Availability= Estetrol is still in clinical trials and is not yet marketed in any country.

It is typically found in the western United States and Canada. Adults are brown to black, with yellow-brown hairs and gray-brown stripes on the thorax. Their scaly wings have four dark spots, which are less distinct in the male. Male Anopheles freeborni aggregate into swarms to attract potential mates. Females are able to overwinter, allowing for seasonal development of eggs in the spring. The western malaria mosquito feeds on bloodmeals. Within the United States‚Äô regions of semiarid or arid climate, it has been historically identified as the primary transmission vector for malaria. It was most notably involved in the malaria outbreaks of northern California during the turn of the 20th century. Description Adult A. freeborni are medium-sized with overall brown to black coloration. They possess a dark proboscis as well as palpi of similar length to the proboscis on their heads. The head is covered in erect scales, dark-colored at the posterior, yellow-white at the center, and light at the vertex. They also have a frontal tuft composed of several light-colored setae. Adults have a gray- brown prescutellar space and brown to black scutum, which possesses hairs of light yellow to golden-brown coloration. The central area of the scutum has gray-brown stripes and the highest density of hairs. The sickle-shaped scutellum also has similarly-colored hairs and setae. The thorax has setae on the pre-spiracular area, but not on the post-spiracular area. The adult abdomen is brown to black, also with hairs of yellow-brown coloration. Their legs have primarily dark scales, with lighter-colored scales at their tips. They possess wings of about 4.5 mm in length, covered in dark scales, with four spots formed by even darker-colored scales. These spots are less noticeable on males‚Äô wings. The media and radial sector of their wings' backsides have tapered scales, which is unique to the species. Distribution  The western malaria mosquito is present throughout North America, predominantly in the western United States and British Columbia, Canada. While most common in the United States and Canada, it has also been observed in Mexico. It typically remains west of the Rocky Mountains, but the mosquito has been observed slightly eastward in Texas, New Mexico, and southern Colorado. They are thought to be most populous in California, particularly the valleys of San Joaquin and Sacramento. Habitat Larvae are found in stagnant water; noted larval habitats include rice fields, pools along roads, and groundwater, with particularly significant larval production in algal masses surrounding rice fields. Vegetative cover is highly sought after in selection of larval habitats. Adults typically reside in cool, shaded areas in the daytime, such as drainage tunnels, dark corners of homes, or beneath bridges. One study in California found hibernating A. freeborni in the nests of wood rats. Females typically overwinter in human structures, such as basements, houses, garages, and barns. They do not remain in one location during overwintering, instead traveling to different shelters throughout the winter. Phylogeny A. freeborni is part of the genus Anopheles. It is most closely phylogenetically related to the species Anopheles hermsi. It belongs to the Angusticorn section, the Maculipennis group, and the Freeborni subgroup, which also includes the species A. hermsi, A. occidentalis, and A. earlei. Flight patterns Flight patterns of A. freeborni remain in close proximity to breeding sites in the summertime. Prehibernation flights, during which individuals disperse from breeding sites, take place in September. These flights are commonly in distance, although flights as long as have been recorded. When the temperature sufficiently rises during hibernation, flights are restricted to movement between local shelters. In February, females begin their return to habitats favoring larval development for oviposition.  Life history  A. freeborni undergo four stages of development, as do all other Anopheles. The entire development process takes about 20 days. Anopheles sp. larva = Egg = During the egg, larva, and pupa stages, the mosquito is aquatic. Eggs are deposited directly into still bodies of water, where they float. Hatching may occur as soon as two to three days after oviposition, although it may take several weeks depending on environmental temperature. = Larva = In contrast with other mosquitoes, Anopheles larvae are horizontally situated directly underneath the water surface. As larvae, all Anopheles mosquitoes develop a head, thorax, and abdomen, but no legs. They have spiracles on their abdomen, which allows them to breathe at the water surface. After 4 larval instars, each succeeded by molting, they transform into pupae. This process takes approximately 15 days. = Pupa = Anopheles pupae transform dramatically, forming a cephalothorax from the thorax and head. Respiratory openings in the cephalothorax again facilitate breathing at the water surface, but no feeding occurs. = Adult = After several days, the cephalothorax backside ruptures and the adult arises. The adult A. freeborni gathers its strength on the water surface until it is able to fly away in search of a bloodmeal. Food resources Algae is a common food source for A. freeborni Larvae feed on microorganisms on top of the water, such as algae. Feeding is facilitated by oral brushes, which generate spiraling currents that direct microorganisms into the mouths of larval A. freeborni. The adult western malaria mosquito relies on bloodmeals for food. It has been suggested as an \\"opportunistic feeder\\", with food choice influenced by available hosts. They commonly feed on humans and sizable domesticated animals, like cattle, horses, and dogs. Deer and sheep are also notable hosts. A. freeborni have also been observed frequently feeding on rabbits. Studies have not indicated a general preference for human or animal hosts, although host selection may vary with availability, human activity, and housing quality. Feeding occurs primarily during and after dusk, although daytime attacks may occur in when the weather is overcast. Females are also known to facilitate human bloodmeals by entering their homes. Mating Mating of A. freeborni occurs following the aggregation of individuals into swarms. It typically occurs on evenings during the late summer season, from about July through September. Swarms of males assemble minutes after sunset, with more individuals joining throughout the first 15 minutes, after which there is a gradual decrease. Swarming is initiated at light intensities of about 350 lux and ended at about 0.5 lux. Circadian rhythms also play a major role, as swarming does not occur during the day. These swarms can reach numbers of 500 to 3000 mosquitoes and last as long as 35 minutes. Smaller-sized males will initiate a swarm to increase their chances of mating by decreasing competition, but also experience prolonged vulnerability to predators. Smaller-sized males mate with significantly less frequency than larger-sized males. Females join the swarm during its highest density, and copulation activity occurs from about 10 to 20 minutes after swarm formation. Parental care The gonotrophic cycle indicates the time spent seeking out a host, feeding on a bloodmeal, egg development, and oviposition. For A. freeborni, this cycle varies from 4 to 6 days, depending on consumption status. Unfed females have a longer gonotrophic cycle due to the mating and maturation period required by newly-molted females. Sites selected for oviposition are synonymous with favored larval habitats. Female oviposition favors shallow, still bodies of water, which are at least partially sunlit during the day and which preferably contain some algae or other vegetative matter. Larvae are infrequently developed in bodies of water covered in shadow. Enemies E. collocata, a common predator Known predators include Erythemis collocata and Pantala hymenaea, species belonging to the Libellulidae family of dragonflies. Predation partially overlaps with mating activity, as western malaria mosquitoes are most frequently attacked during swarming. Predatory activity begins with swarm initiation and remains intense for the next 15 minutes. Dragonfly predation is reliant on visual detection, so attacks decrease as it gets darker. Attacks occur more frequently over open areas, reflecting dragonfly foraging preferences. Larval dragonflies may also prey upon the mosquito larvae, along with other predators such as frogs, spiders, and flatworms; these larval predators may be used to control the population of Anopheles mosquitos in order to decrease malarial transmission. Interactions with humans Historically, A. freeborni has been considered the primary transmission vector for malaria in the western regions of the United States. It was primarily involved in the malaria outbreaks of northern California in the late 19th century and early 20th century. However, the frequency of human bloodmeals and the mosquito‚Äôs potential as a transmission vector may be limited by human behavior and relative accessibility in certain areas. Recent studies have also questioned the significance of A. freeborni as a transmission vector due to their morphological similarity with A. hermsi, whose presence has recently been identified throughout Colorado and Arizona. =Control= Insecticides have commonly been used for mosquito control in the past. Such pesticidal agents as Bacillus thuringiensis, as well as some piperidine compounds and CIC-4, a lactone, are known to be effective at controlling A. freeborni larvae. In an effort to combat insecticide dependence, recent studies have investigated mosquitofish (G. affinis), a predator of the mosquito larvae, as a means of control. Their presence has been found to significantly reduce A. freeborni larval densities in rice fields.

She was the Lord Mayor of Newcastle, and Australia's first female Lord Mayor, from 1974 to 1976 and again from 1977 until 1984, when she retired from politics following a severe stroke. Personal life Cummings was born Joyce Anne Plumbe on 23 December 1923 at Ramsgate, New South Wales, to Charlotte and Dallas Plumbe. She moved to the Newcastle area at the onset of the Second World War when her father, a fireman, was transferred to the Scott Street Brigade. It was here that she met and married Ray Cummings, who was also a fireman, together raising a family of four children. Cummings is the maternal grandmother of actress Sarah Wynter. Political career Cummings became a member of the Australian Labor Party in 1938, at the age of 15, and later entered local politics in 1968. During her political career she was active in promoting environmental and heritage conservation, the arts, local business and industry, and social reforms. Some of her achievements included the preservation of the East End of Newcastle and Cooks Hill, the refurbishment of the Civic Theatre, and the preservation of Blackbutt Reserve and the Shortland Wetlands. She was also a vocal opponent to the closure of the Newcastle State Dockyards. Two significant social reforms was the use by her of Advance Australia Fair during Citizenship Ceremonies in 1977 and the flying of the Aboriginal flag over the town hall, both of which were Australian firsts. Cummings was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 1975 and awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001.  Death  Joy Cummings died at the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle's New Lambton Heights on 1 July 2003. Legacy The Joy Cummings Promenade on Newcastle's harbour foreshore was dedicated in her honour in 2012. The promenade plaque states that Cummings \\"presided over a period of change, as Newcastle shed its heavy industrial base to become to the city of beauty, vibrancy and diversity that it is today.\\" A bronze bust of Cummings was unveiled outside of Civic Station in the Newcastle CBD in December 2019. The bust was created by Mudgee-based sculptor and artist Margot Stephens and was overseen by Newcastle City Council. According to the City of Newcastle, Cummings was the first person in Newcastle to have received a bronze bust in their honour at the time.

It is focused on national and international security issues; military analysis, systems, and strategies; intelligence matters; and space policy analysis. It was founded in December 2000 by John Pike, who had previously worked since 1983 with the Federation of American Scientists, where he directed the space policy, cyberstrategy, military analysis, nuclear resource, and intelligence resource projects. GlobalSecurity.org is headquartered in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in Alexandria, Virginia, and John Pike is its director. The website's target audience includes journalists, policy-makers, scholars, political scientists, military and defense personnel, and the public. It supplies background information and developing news stories, providing online analysis and articles that analyze what are sometimes little-discussed topics in categories that include WMDs, military and defense, security and cybersecurity, intelligence, and space technology. It also disseminates primary documentation and other original materials, provides detailed, high- resolution satellite images and video footage from war zones, and provides definitions of widely used terms for the public. The organization also serves as a defense, military, foreign policy, and national-security watchdog group. In part it seeks to find new approaches to international security, and promotes achieving cooperative international security and preventing nuclear proliferation. To this end it seeks to improve intelligence-community capabilities to respond to new threats and to prevent the need for military action, while at the same time enhancing the effectiveness of military forces when needed. GlobalSecurity.org was listed in the War Intelligence category of Forbes' now-defunct \\"Best of the Web\\" directory from 2001 onward; the directory cited its \\"Depth of military information\\", and noted its \\"collection of satellite images and video footage from the war zone\\". In his 2004 book Plan of Attack, about the behind-the-scenes decision-making that led the Bush administration to invade Iraq, Bob Woodward called the website \\"an invaluable resource on military, intelligence and national security matters\\".

It was the last operation of the 1st Marine Division during the Vietnam War. Background The Qu·∫ø S∆°n mountains located approximately south of Danang had long been a People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong (VC) base area, and numerous operations had been mounted against the mountains and valley throughout the war. From late June 1970, the 7th Marine Regiment had been rotating reinforced rifle companies on 5-day patrols of the area, which regularly uncovered PAVN/VC positions and engaged in small skirmishes. On 13 August, Companies I and L, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines and Company A, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines began Operation Ripley Center in the central Qu·∫ø S∆°n mountains. On 15 August, Company A, 1/5 Marines was withdrawn from the operation and on 24 August, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines was landed in the area and took over the operation. The Marines uncovered numerous PAVN/VC facilities and killed 25 PAVN/VC and captured 8 for no Marine losses. The operation concluded on 31 August. In August the 1st Marine Division and the 7th Marine Regiment staffs began planning a large operation to pacify the Qu·∫ø S∆°n mountains, which were believed to harbor the PAVN's Front 4 Headquarters, the D3, R20 and V25 Infantry Battalions, the 42nd Reconnaissance Battalion and the 3D, T89 and T90 Sapper Battalions. The plan called for an intensive air and artillery bombardment intended to drive the PAVN/VC into shelters allowing the 2/7 Marines to land at 12 separate landing zones, the 1st Platoon, Company D, 1st Reconnaissance Battalion to establish 3 observations posts, and for the mortar battery of 3rd Battalion, 11th Marines to establish a firebase on Hill 845. Operation =September to December 1970= After midnight on 31 August, 10 Marines artillery batteries began shelling 53 targets in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n mountains; when the bombardment ended at 06:45 (IT) a total of 13,488 shells had been fired. The artillery barrage was immediately followed by 2 hours of airstrikes and then at 09:00 (IT) the first helicopters began landing the Marines. The 2/7 Marines command post was established on Hill 845, now named Landing Zone Vulture (). The Marine landings were unopposed, and they made no contact with the PAVN/VC over the next 4 days. On 5 September, Company E pursued a PAVN soldier into a cave in a ravine near LZ Vulture and were met by heavy weapons fire. The other 3 companies moved to the area and proceeded to engage an estimated 30-50 PAVN in the ravine in close combat over the next 3 days. On 9 September, after having lost 3 Marines killed in the ravine, the Marines were pulled back to allow air strikes on the area. By 12 September the Marines had pacified the area with the PAVN having been killed, sealed in caves or withdrawn from the ravine. From 14 to 30 September, the Marines killed 14 PAVN/VC in ambushes throughout the operational area. On 13 September, 3/7 Marines joined the operation landing southwest of the 2/7 Marines position. On 20 September, the 3/7 Marines launched Operation Imperial Lake South, which continued until the end of September with minimal results. On 16 September, a VC defector led Company E, 2/7 Marines to 2 base camps of the 91st Sapper Battalion. On 20 September, the Marines found a headquarters and hospital complex in caves and tunnel underneath LZ Vulture and captured 2 VC medical corpsmen who revealed that the complex had been evacuated after the 31 August bombardment. On 22 September, Company F, 2/7 Marines left the operation, and on 23 September, Company G, the mortar battery and the 2/7 Marines command group redeployed to Landing Zone Baldy, leaving only Company E in the area of operations and Company I, 3/7 Marines in the Imperial Lake South area of operations. At the end of September, the 5th Marine Regiment took over the operation from the 7th Marine Regiment, which was redeploying to the United States as part of Operation Keystone Robin Alpha. Company M, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines replaced Company E, 2/7 Marines at LZ Vulture, while Company L 3/5 Marines replaced Company I 3/7 Marines in the southern area. On 18 October, the 1st Marine Division ordered a change to the operation with 6-man patrols deployed in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n mountains which would call in a quick reaction force (QRF) at LZ Baldy to exploit any contact. The 1st Reconnaissance Battalion moved to LZ Vulture, now renamed LZ Rainbow, which would serve as the patrol base. On 21 October, Company F, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines replaced Company M, 3/5 Marines at LZ Rainbow while Company H, 2/5 Marines formed the QRF. The reconnaissance team/QRF tactics achieved steady results in locating PAVN/VC positions and engaging small units. On 26 October, the QRF discovered an abandoned battalion-size base camp, and on the same day 2 reconnaissance teams ambushed 10-15 PAVN north of LZ Rainbow killing 5. On 27 October, a squad from Company F of the QRF attacked a PAVN camp west of LZ Rainbow killing 6 before coming under attack themselves losing 1 Marine killed before air and artillery strikes forced the PAVN to withdraw. By the end of October the Marines had killed 74 PAVN/VC and captured 34 weapons in the operational area. On 1 November, 1/5 Marines established a forward command post in the northern Qu·∫ø S∆°n mountains, on 6 November, 2/5 Marines established a forward command post on Hill 381 (), south of LZ Rainbow and on 26 November, the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion moved its patrol base to Hill 510 () in the western Qu·∫ø S∆°n mountains. On 5 November, Company B, 1/5 Marines found an abandoned base camp and documents including the files for the VC security section in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province identifying leaders and agents. On 18 November, a HMM-263 CH-46D which was extracting a reconnaissance team by McGuire rig crashed into a mountainside in bad weather southeast of LZ Rainbow, killing all 15 Marines on board, including the Reconnaissance Battalion commander Lt. Col. William G. Leftwich Jr.. On 19 November, a newly formed Republic of Korea Marine Corps (ROKMC) Marine reconnaissance unit joined the operation establishing a base in Hill 322 in the northeast Qu·∫ø S∆°n mountains and they would be joined by the 6th and 7th ROKMC Companies later that month. On 2 December, the 3/5 Marines command group replaced the 2/5 Marines command group on Hill 381 and the 2/5 command group returned to LZ Baldy before redeploying to Hill 510 on 20 December. From 16‚Äì23 December, Companies G and H, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines operated northwest of Hill 510 with minimal results. On the afternoon of 24 December, Company L, 3/5 Marines found a group of 9 PAVN/VC outside a cave southwest of Hill 381, the Marines fired on the group killing 4 while the remainder fled. Companies K and L searched the caves and discovered a major PAVN/VC command post including 3 radios, 3 generators, spares and other equipment which were believed to be part of the elusive Front 4 Headquarters. By the end of December 1970, the operation had accounted for 196 PAVN/VC killed and 106 captured while 20 Marines and 2 Navy Corpsmen had been killed. =January to May 1971= On 8 January, 1/5 Marines withdrew its forward command post and one of its companies from the operation. On 25 January, 2nd Platoon, Company L, 3/5 Marines engaged 10 PAVN northeast of Firebase Ross, killing 9 for no losses. On 13 February, the 2/5 Marines command group replaced the 3/5 Marines command group on Hill 381 and assumed command of the operation. On 15 February Companies K and L, 3/5 Marines were withdrawn to Hill 34 () near Da Nang Air Base for redeployment to the United States. 1st Battalion, 11th Marines took over artillery support replacing the 2/11 Marines who were also being redeployed. With the planned closure of Firebases Ross and Ryder, the 1/11 Marines moved to new firebases in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n mountains at Hills 218, 381, 425 and 510. In January, and February, the Marines killed 85 alleged PAVN/VC for the loss of 1 Marine. The operation continued to uncover large quantities of ammunition and supplies, disrupting their logistics network. These includes unarmed women and children killed during the Son Thang massacre. On 1 March, the 2/5 Marines moved its command post from Hill 381 to LZ Baldy in preparation for their redeployment, on 2 March, the 1st Marine Regiment took control of the operation and established its command post on Hill 510 and on 3 March Companies F and H, 2/5 Marines were withdrawn from the operation. Elements of the 1/5 Marines await a heli- lift from Hill 510 to Hill 34 near Danang On 23 March, 1/5 Marines moved its command post and two companies from Hill 510 in preparation for redeployment and 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines established their command post on Hill 510 together with Companies K and L. On 28 March, the 1st Marine Division expanded the Imperial Lake area of operations to include the mountains west and northwest of Danang, known as the \\"Rocket Belt\\". On 30 March Companies K and L had left Hill 510 and moved back to the Rocket Belt, leaving one platoon on the hill. On 6 April, Company B, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment was landed at Hill 510 beginning the handover of the area of operations to the 23rd Infantry Division. From 7, to 8 April, the 3/1 Marines command post and the platoon from Company L, 3/1 Marines left Hill 510. On 13 April the 25th Infantry Division formally assumed control of southern Qu·∫£ng Nam Province. Aftermath Operation Imperial Lake concluded on 7 May 1971. The Marines had lost 24 killed and claimed 296 PAVN/VC killed.

The trains are designed and built by the Spanish train builder Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF), who bases the trains on the Civity platform. The trains are primarily intended to replace older train equipment (primarily the Urban Regional Material (NS SGMm)), but are also intended for the growth of the number of passengers on the Hoofdrailnet or main rail network. The Sprinter New Generation is characterized by a spacious interior, with much light and space. This is achieved through the use of Jacobs bogies , resulting in wide-body and spacious transitions. The low floor makes the train easier to access for the disabled. History =Origins= In 1983 the first plans were made for the replacement of NS Mat '64 or Materieel '64 EMUs. The intention was to have a large series of slow trains in service from the early 1990s, which would replace the Materiel '64 at once. The series became known as the Stoptreinmaterieel '90 (SM '90). From 1992, train builder Talbot built a small test series of nine train sets, as a prelude to a large series of around 250 two and three-car sets. The test series was equipped with new technologies for that time, such as computer-controlled control and diagnosis systems. However, these techniques proved to be less reliable than anticipated, and therefore a large follow-up order was omitted. The series was taken out of service at the end of 2005. Because there was a need for new equipment to replace the Materieel '64, in 2005 NS placed an order for 35 trainsets of the Sprinter Lighttrain type. These sets are based on the German DBAG Class 425, but have been adapted for use on the Dutch rail network. After placing follow-up orders in 2007 and 2009, there were 121 ordered train sets. It turned out that these couples did not fully meet the wishes of the Dutch Railways, as in the initial phase the train proved unable to withstand wintry weather. Travelers and traveler organizations also complained about the lack of toilets on board. Because of these points, further follow-up orders were cancelled and the last train set was delivered in 2012. The Sprinter Lighttrain has replaced the four-part train sets of Materiel '64, Plan T; they went out of service between 2008 and 2010. Due to the absence of further follow-up orders, it was not yet possible to replace part of the remaining two-part trainsets of the Materiel '64, the Plan V. In addition to the lack of additional equipment to replace the Materieel '64 , a number of issues began to play a role in the demand for new train equipment around 2013: the high passenger growth and the inevitable replacement of the Stadsgewestelijk Materieel or NS SGMm, the first generation of Sprinters. The number of travelers on the hoofdrailnet (main network) grew by 24% from 2004 to 2013. This growth can largely be explained by an increase in population, a larger number of students, the increase in fuel prices and the running of extra trains. Because students, like commuters, travel especially during rush hour, the demand for transport, and therefore the demand for rolling stock, is greater during rush hours. After a thorough renovation was conducted from 2003 to 2009, plans for the replacement of the Stadsgewestelijk Materieel were started at the end of the 2000s. This equipment was put into service between 1975 and 1983, so the first sets were forty years old in 2015. Because the technical lifespan of railway equipment is on average 40 years, they needed to be replaced. =Interior design process= Between 13 and 20 March 2015, NS gave travelers and staff the opportunity to choose possible interiors. Thanks to a test set-up at Rotterdam Central, interested parties were able to choose from three interiors, with seats for the first and second class and folding seats. The results have been an important factor for the interior choices for the new Sprinters. At the end of September 2015, representatives of interest groups such as the Public Transport Travelers Association were given the opportunity to view a model of the new Sprinter New Generation in Spain. NS appeared to have chosen interior C from the experiment, with Sophia seats from the Spanish Fainsa and purple folding seats.

He paddled a canoe to Honolulu to be personally instructed in the faith and to join the church. Then he returned to Maui and instructed over 4,000 people for the Catholic Mission. His boundless enthusiasm for the promotion of the Catholic faith earned him the title \\"Apostle of Maui\\".

History  Founded in 2009, the archive's initial holdings consisted of over 100,000 educational, documentary, and other unique films that were either created or distributed by Indiana University. Many of these were acquired from the Indiana University Audio-Visual Center, which rented the films and videos out across the United States for the latter half of the 20th century until its closure in 2006. As of 2012, the Moving Image Archive was accepted as a member of the International Federation of Film Archives. In 2016, a dedicated space was opened on the ground floor of Herman B. Wells Library for Media Services, the Moving Image Archive, and the Black Film Collection and Archives. A screening room opened adjacent to the Moving Image Archive in 2017 capable of high-quality film and video screenings for university classes and members of the general public.  Collections  The Moving Image Archive holds a wide variety of audiovisual materials spanning over 80 years of audiovisual history. As of 2017, its holdings were estimated at over 120,000 items, making it one of the largest and most comprehensive collections currently held by an academic library in the United States. The archive has collaborated with numerous agencies worldwide, including the Library of Congress and Visible Evidence, the international conference on documentary film and media. = Alan Lewis Small Gauge Camera and Projector Collection = In 2017, film archivist Alan Lewis donated his collection of approximately 200 small gauge cameras and 50 projectors to the Moving Image Archive. The dates on the equipment range from World War II-era machines to cameras and projectors used throughout the second half of the 20th century. Manufacturers featured include Bell & Howell, Kodak, Bolex, Wittnauer, Canon, and Yashica. = Clio Awards Collection = In 2017, the archive acquired the Clio Awards Collection from the London International Awards, the organization that purchased the collection from its creator, the Clio Awards, in 1992. The collection contains thousands of reels of 16mm and 35mm film, with entries and winners from the Clio Awards from the 1960s through the 1990s across a wide array of categories. International submissions are also included in the collection. = Educational Film Collection = Part of the Moving Image Archive's initial holdings, the Educational Film Collection was created before World War II as an outreach service provided by the Indiana University Extension Office. In 1945, its holdings consisted of almost 500 films that were distributed to various organizations - schools, public libraries, clubs and organizations - across the United States for low rates. Throughout the 20th century, the Educational Film Collection continued to grow. Under the management of the Indiana University Audio-Visual Center, it expanded to include videocassettes (U-Matic and 1/2\\" VHS) in the 1970s. Upon its acquisition by the Indiana University Library System in 2006, the collection contained approximately 50,000 reels of 16mm film and 7,000 videos, including around 1,000 films that were produced by the Indiana University Audio-Visual Center's staff. = Edward and Naomi Feil Collection = In 2016, the archive acquired the Edward and Naomi Feil Collection. The collection contains the life's work of husband and wife filmmakers Edward and Naomi Feil, whose 1968 film The Inner World of Aphasia was added to the National Film Registry in 2015.

She is acknowledged as a leader in West Australian landscape architecture and received a national award for landscape architecture in 1990.  Early life  Jean was born in Rockhampton in 1925, married Ivan Barnes Verschuer in the 1951 and remarried Laurence Brodie-Hall in 1980. She has four siblings. She studied nursing at the Children‚Äôs Hospital (now Princess Margaret Hospital), working in London and Melbourne, before settling back in Perth with her family in the late 1940s. After marrying dentist Ivan Barnes Verschuer in 1951, she enrolled in a horticultural course at Perth Technical College, balancing caring for her three young children.  Professional career  Jean was a founding member of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (AILA) and served on the Institute‚Äôs federal council for 10 years, during which time she was also the Australian delegate to the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA). For the last two years of her term, she was President of the AILA. During the 1960s, Jean‚Äôs early projects were through the architecture firms of Forbes & Fitzhardinge and Summerhayes & Associates, where she was a consultant to large public companies, private firms, government agencies and local councils on a range of projects. These included standard-gauge railway stations, the Salvation Army village in Hollywood, Western Australia, and the design of major mining towns and their surrounds. Following the incorporation of the AILA and her admission as a founding member, Jean opened a private practice in Kalamunda, Western Australia. She worked extensively for the Western Mining Corporation on their Kambalda project, at the Kwinana Nickel Refinery, the Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter and the Agricola College for the School of Mines. In 1970, Jean was engaged by the University of Western Australia (UWA), initially to report on the changes to pedestrian and vehicle movement caused by the recently completed underpass from the north of the campus. On the retirement of the curator, she was appointed the inaugural University Landscape Architect in 1974, responsible for planning, design and maintenance of the campus, in the office of the University Architect until her retirement in 1981. She was responsible for the improvement of Whitfeld Court, the Sunken Garden, Somerville Auditorium, the Great Court, the Tropical Grove, the Oak Lawn, Jackson Court, Prescott Court and Whelan Court.  Awards and recognition  In 1979, Jean became a Fellow of the AILWA and was awarded the AILA Award in Landscape Architecture in 1990. She was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for conservation and the environment in 2001 and received the Centenary Medal in the same year. Jean Brodie-Hall has maintained strong connections with UWA, helping to establish the UWA Friends of the Grounds, becoming Patron of the UWA Centenary Trust for Women, The Kwongan Foundation for the conservation of Australia's biodiversity, as well as serving on numerous committees. = List of awards = 1980 Fellow of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects 1981 Fellow of Curtin University 1990 Awarded the Medal of the Institute of Landscape Architects 2001 Member of the Order of Australia 2004 Chancellors Medal UWA  External links/further reading  20 women of landscape architecture, short film, 2014 1984, English, Video edition: Landscape architecture in Western Australia [videorecording] : founder figures : special guest, Jean Verschuer.

Casualty estimates vary, with the Houthi-owned Al-Masirah reporting the toll later that day to be at least 33 civilians including the bride, while other estimates are higher. Forty-five other people were injured. Airstrike The Saudi Arabian- led coalition carried out two separate airstrikes in Yemen. The planes repeatedly flew over the area where the strike was being conducted, thus preventing medical personnel from treating the victims. The victims were primarily women and children, who were congregating in one of the tents set up for the wedding. A Houthi government spokesperson said that ambulances were initially unable to reach the scene due to the threat from jets, which continued to fly overhead. According to the Houthi officials, the strikes first targeted the men gathering at the wedding and then the women. The airstrike killed the bride and wounded the groom with shrapnel. Some of the injured children lost eyes and limbs. According to Abdul Hakim Alkhulani, a spokesperson for the Health Ministry, \\"Due to many casualties from the coalition-led wedding attacks, field hospitals were made near the site of the attacks giving injured civilians medical treatment in order to save lives\\". Video footage of the airstrike shows body parts scattered around the area, as well as a young boy hugging a man's body who had died from the strike. According to Bellingcat, a citizen journalist organisation, the bomb was made by the American company Raytheon.https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2018/04/27/american-made-bomb- used-airstrike-yemen-wedding/ Reactions A spokesperson for United Nations secretary Ant√≥nio Guterres said \\"The Secretary-General reminds all parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law concerning the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure during armed conflicts\\". A spokesperson for the Saudi Arabian coalition which carried out the airstrike said, \\"We take this report very seriously and it will be fully investigated as all reports of this nature are\\". The foreign minister of Iran, Bahram Qassemi, responded to the airstrike saying \\"The escalated bombardment of residential areas proves the desperation and inability of the invaders in achieving their goals\\". The Saba News Agency of Yemen described the airstrike as \\"the new genocidal crime of the Saudis\\". The Campaign Against Arms Trade, a UK-based organisation, responded to the incident with a criticism of the UK government, \\"Yemen is now in its fourth year of war, and the bombardment is getting worse. Thousands have been killed, and many more will be if it continues. Theresa May has said she wants the UK to play a positive role on the world stage, so why is her government still arming and supporting Saudi atrocities?

Daniel threw him all the contracts he has to Alexander and Samuel, revealing that the black badge is real, and that alone unlocked the safe. Daniel says that Workers are disqualified from being the 4 major crews. Alexander called all his security team to corner the duo. Jong Gun talks while looking at his broken arm, and talks about his black badge being used by somebody else, suspecting that Daniel has a double agent assisting him.

Just before transferring to Jae Won High to run away from his bullies, he wakes up one day with a slimmer and more attractive body next to his chubby one. With his new ability, he makes new friends and learns about the world and himself through two point of views. The slimmer body was based on Park Hyung Suk, a fit model. Vasco/Lee Eun Tae: Vasco, from the Architecture Department, has the reputation of being a \\"Robin Hood\\", as he stands up for the weak and bullied. He is one of the strongest characters in the series and is the leader of the loyal gang, Burn Knuckles, who \\"punish bullies\\". His tough exterior is misleading as he is very sweet and seeks the friendship of those he deems as good people. He is also the childhood friend of Jace Park. The character Vasco is inspired by real-life K-rapper with the same name. Jay Hong/Hong Jae Yeol: Jay Hong, from the Fashion Department, is a quiet and mysterious character. He's rich, fights using systema and kali martial arts, and helps those that he likes. Many readers believe it is implied throughout the series that Jay has \\"romantic feelings\\" towards Daniel Park. Some reasons are through actions such as him keeping a coupon with Daniel's face on it in his wallet (the coupon is from \\"Gian Shop\\"; see \\"Fitting Model\\"), Jay adopting Inu's puppies despite his fear of dogs (see \\"Abandoned Dog Inu\\" & \\"Jay Hong and Inu's Pups\\"), and Jay's habit of giving Daniel his clothing (Chapters 20 & 162). Zack Lee/Lee Jin Sung: Zack Lee, from the Fashion Department, is a boxer and is quite aggressive excepting his soft spot for his childhood friend, Mira Kim, who he is in love with.

This shows that she feels a hint of pride in her first body. The different treatment to both of her bodies leads her to strongly believe that \\"all men are the same\\" and that the world judges those with different appearances without reason.

Background  In China's higher education system, university and college professors, particularly academic advisors, have increasingly come under fire for abuse of power and improper misconduct. In the larger context of China's emphasis on social and political \\"Stability Maintenance\\", schools and related educational mechanisms frequently suppress the public discussion of students sympathetic to the victims of systematic abuse, have been accused of treating the accused professors with unjust leniency, and allegedly tend not to defend the rights of the students. In the \\"Tao Chongyuan Incident\\" (Èô∂Â¥áÂõ≠‰∫ã‰ª∂) one month prior, this suppression of public discourse was exceedingly evident. Cultural understandings of sexuality and gender in China emphasize female chastity, and as a result, compared to other violent crimes, sexual harassment and sexual assault are more frequently covered up, if reported at all.

In April 2019, Dream11 became the first Indian gaming company to enter the \\"Unicorn Club\\". History Dream11 was co-founded by Harsh Jain, Bhavit Sheth & Varun Daga in 2008. In 2012, they introduced freemium fantasy sports in India for cricket fans. In 2014, the company reported 1 million registered users, which grew to 2 million in 2016 and to 45 million in 2018.. In April 2019, Steadview Capital completed secondary investment in Dream11. Apart from Steadview, Dream11's investors included Kalaari Capital, Think Investments, Multiples Equity and Tencent. Legality In 2017, a case was registered against the company in an Indian High Court. The court, in its ruling, stated that playing the Dream11 game involves superior knowledge, judgement and attention. The Court also held that \\"the element of skill\\" had a predominant influence on the outcome of the Dream11 game. However, the law does not allow fantasy sports in a few Indian states like Assam, Odisha and Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. A challenge to this judgement was filed with the Supreme Court of India, which dismissed the appeal. The judgement provided legality to the company and allowed them to run their operations throughout the country. Despite it being adjudged to be a \\"game of skill\\", experts believe that the company operates in the country's regulatory \\"grey area\\". Dream11 is not available on the Google Play store for Android devices as Google does not allow apps that run cash contests. Partnerships On 18 August 2020 Dream11 won the rights for the 2020 Indian Premier League sponsorship for ‚Çπ 2.22 billion after Vivo pulled out for a year. In August 2020, The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), announced Dream11 as the Official Partner for the Indian Premier League.Additionally, the ‚ÄòOfficial Fantasy Game‚Äô of IPL will also be powered by Dream11.

In 2018, through the above partnership, Dream11 introduced two new games on their platform viz.,Kabaddi and Hockey. In 2017, the company partnered with three leagues within cricket, football and basketball. Dream11 became the Official Fantasy Partner for Hero Caribbean Premier League, Hero Indian Super League and National Basketball Association (NBA). Later in the year, they partnered with the Hero Indian Super League as their Official Fantasy Football Partner. In November 2017, US professional basketball league National Basketball Association (NBA), launched a fantasy basketball game in association with Dream11 and launched their official NBA fantasy game on their platform. Brand ambassadors Cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the brand ambassador of Dream11 and launched the ‚ÄúDimaag se Dhoni‚Äù media campaign during the 2018 Indian Premier League.

Early Life She was born Naomi Grace Saalfield on May 15, 1989 in Melbourne, Australia. She and her five siblings were raised by their single mother, a choreographer and painter, until Nai was 11 years old, when her mother died of breast cancer. She was orphaned at 13 when her father died in a house fire. Saalfield was first introduced to music by her mother, playing piano and listening to soul, flamenco, and Northwest African music. Later, her brother introduced her to classic rock staples Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. After Saalfield‚Äôs mother died, she went through the foster care system, and went to live with her aunt in Mount Beauty. She also lived for a time with a family who ran a wildlife sanctuary for native animals where she developed a love and attachment to the natural world. Her aunt had an acoustic guitar, and Nai learned to harmonize with it. When Saalfield was 15 years old, she moved back to Melbourne and was homeless for a time. She started using \\"Nai Palm\\" as a professional name while working as a fire performer. Career With Hiatus Kaiyote In Melbourne, Saalfield began to perform gigs with her guitar. She met bassist Paul Bender when he saw her do a solo show, and they started working together a year later. Drummer Perrin Moss and keyboardist Simon Mavin joined shortly afterwards, and the quartet became the band Hiatus Kaiyote. In February 2012, Hiatus Kaiyote opened for Taylor McFerrin in Melbourne. McFerrin was so impressed with them that he introduced their music to influential broadcaster and DJ Gilles Peterson. Later, in 2014, Nai Palm was a featured artist on McFerrin's track, \\"The Antidote.\\" The band released their debut album Tawk Tomahawk independently in April 2012. It was noticed by numerous musicians including Animal Collective and Dirty Projectors, and received public endorsements from Erykah Badu, Questlove,and Prince, who urged their followers via Twitter to listen to the music. In early 2013, Gilles Peterson named Hiatus Kaiyote the Breakthrough Artist of the Year at his Worldwide Music Awards in London and shortly thereafter they were introduced to Salaam Remi who had just started working as an A&R; executive at Sony Music. Sony gave him the opportunity to start up his own label, Flying Buddha, and his first signing was Hiatus Kaiyote. They licensed Tawk Tomahawk to the label, adding an updated version of the track \\"Nakamarra\\" featuring Q-Tip. Following this release, the band toured extensively internationally, and were nominated in 2014 for a Grammy Award for Best R&B; Performance for that track. They were the first ever Australian artist to be nominated for a Grammy in an R&B; category. They lost out to Snarky Puppy and Lalah Hathaway's recording \\"Something\\". In 2014, the band began working on their second album, Choose Your Weapon, which was released on 1 May 2015. On 9 May 2015, Choose Your Weapon debuted at number 22 on the Australian albums chart. Nai Palm described the album as an \\"extension\\" of their debut, and stated she and the band had no intention to make a one-genre body of work. Many of the songs on the album derived from Saalfield's original ideas that were later fleshed out by the band together. During the recording the band wanted to pay tribute to the format of a mixtape, so they incorporated interludes. The album also became the band's first release to chart in the US, reaching #127 on the US Billboard 200, and #11 on the US Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The song \\"Breathing Underwater\\" from Choose Your Weapon was nominated for Best R&B; Performance at the 58th Grammy Awards, but lost out to The Weeknd's recording of \\"Earned It (Fifty Shades of Gray)\\". Solo Career In 2017, Nai Palm released her debut solo album Needle Paw, and toured in support of it. The album features only vocals and guitars, and includes original tracks as well as songs by David Bowie, Tamia, and Jimi Hendrix. She also worked with Australian indigenous performer Jason Guwanbal Gurruwiwi on the album. The recording process of this release was very different from Hiatus Kaiyote albums. During an interview with Julie Adenuga of Beats 1 Nai mentioned she thought \\"Needle Paw\\" was the name of a desert flower. In an interview with Sound of Boston, Nai Palm explained that working on a solo album gave her greater flexibility to work on her guitar sounds and the challenge of releasing a more raw and personal record. The cover art of the album, an abstract drawing of Saalfield, was done by Chilean artist Jowy Maasdamme, whom Saalfield discovered on Instagram. In June 2018, Nai Palm was featured on Scorpion by Drake, who has spoken highly of both her and Hiatus Kaiyote. She sang a cover of \\"More Than a Woman\\" by Aaliyah, which appears at the end of Drake's song \\"Is There More.\\" Personal Life On October 18, 2018, Saalfield revealed via her social media that she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She posted to Instagram, \\"I am riddled with anxiety while trying to practice courage and patience daily in the face of the scariest and most emotionally triggering shit I‚Äôve ever had to endure.\\" From her hospital bed recovering from a mastectomy, Nai performed a cover of Curtis Mayfield's ‚ÄúThe Makings of You‚Äù, accompanied by Paul Bender on guitar. She opted out of breast reconstruction in the hope to challenge beauty standards. As of an interview with KCRW Berlin in 2019, she is currently cancer-free.

It is the last film of the trilogy, started with the films New Tales of Scheherazade and And another night of Scheherazade. The heroes of the film are the shoemaker Maruf and the daughter of the Caliph, Esmag√ºl, who despite falling in love with a young man, nevertheless forces him to fight for his own happiness. Plot Full of impatience, the Caliph is eager to learn from Scheherezade what happened when cobbler Maruf returned to the city of the Caliph with the heavily laden caravan. After his arrival, Maruf pays his debts to the merchants and his wedding with Princess Esmag√ºl gets under way. However, the vizier Dschaffar finds out that Maruf is just a shoemaker, who owes his wealth to the jinn of the magic ring. Secretly he robs Maruf of the precious gem, with which he immediately rises to the rank of a caliph. He lets his predecessor and Maruf disappear into the desert. When the two ex-hunters then meet a dragon in the arid wasteland, Scheherezade tells the new caliph that she can not tell the story as long as he carries the magic ring on his finger. Desiring to learn the further events, Jaffar puts it aside, whereupon Scheherezade tells him that Princess Esmag√ºl who is standing behind him, is to take possession of the miracle ring. Those threatened by the dragon immediately wish themselves back and Jaffar is turned into a vile lizard to be thrown to the animals. Unwanted by Esmag√ºl, the ring later returns to the possession of Maruf, who then flies with the princess on the back of the giant jinn to his homeland. On the way Esmag√ºl is kidnapped by Tiuli-Kos. However, the jinn, exhausted by the many wishes, can not bring her back, so he deposes Maruf with his last strength near the kidnapper's town. Alone, the shoemaker arrives there, with the intention of liberating his princess. With the help of the liberated Saeed, who was captured for seeking his lover, also stolen for the harp of the ancient Tiuli-Kos, Maruf disguises himself as a famous physician and thus gains access to the palace of Tiuli-Kos. He lets Esmag√ºl take a soporific herbal drink, bringing the lifeless beauty, who has been found dead, into the desert. After Esmag√ºl was awakened from her sleep by Maruf, the recovering jinn flies the two lovers to the shoemaker's hometown, where they spend their lives in joy and happiness. The slaves of the harem are also cheerful and happy, because the jinn helps bring them back to their freedom at their request.

It has two dark green leaves and a single greenish brown or pinkish flower with a dark red to black, ant-like callus covering most of the upper surface of the labellum. It is similar to both C. seminuda and C. reflexa. Description Chiloglottis trilabra is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with two dark green, oblong to egg-shaped leaves long and wide. A single greenish brown or pinkish flower long and wide is borne on a flowering stem high. The dorsal sepal is spatula-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear, long, less than wide and curve downwards. There is a glandular tip long on the dorsal sepal, dark red and long on the lateral sepals. The petals are oblong to lance- shaped, long, about wide and turned downwards towards the ovary. The labellum is more or less horizontal, diamond-shaped, long and wide with a black, ant- like callus surrounded by many stalked and stalkless glands occupying most of its upper surface. The column has narrow wings. Flowering occurs from December to March. This wasp orchid is similar to C. seminuda which has a callus covering only about two-thirds of the labellum. It is also similar to C. reflexa but has longer lateral sepals and a smaller \\"head\\" on the ant-like callus. Taxonomy and naming Chiloglottis trilabra was first formally described in 1883 by Robert D. FitzGerald and the description was published in Journal of Botany, British and Foreign from a specimen \\"obtained on Mount York in the Blue Mountains\\". The specific epithet (trilabra) is derived from the Latin prefix tri- meaning \\"three\\" and labra meaning \\"lip\\". The type specimen happened to be an aberrant form having two extra labellums in place of two lateral sepals. Distribution and habitat The long-clubbed wasp orchid is widespread in moist parts of forest, mainly on the ranges in New South Wales. In Victoria it is only known from a few areas in the east, but may be more widespread because it has been confused with C. seminuda and C. reflexa.

The role of Book V in Keynes's theory Chapter 19 discusses the question of whether wage rates contribute to unemployment. Keynes's views and intentions on this matter have been vigorously debated, and he does not offer a clear answer in this chapter. The concept of the Keynes effect arises from his attempts to resolve the issue. Chapter 20 covers some mathematical ground needed for Chapter 21. Chapter 21 considers the question of how a change in income resulting from an increase in money supply will be apportioned between wages, prices, employment and profits. (The results also depend on the exogenous behaviour of the workforce and on the shapes of various functions.) Similar considerations arise within the body of Keynes's theory since an increase in income due to a change in the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital will have an equally complicated effect. When the topic arose in Chapter 18 Keynes did not mention that a full analysis needed to be supported by a theory of prices; instead he asserted that \\"the amount of employment\\" was \\"almost the same thing\\" as the national income.p. 247 They are different things but under suitable assumptions they move together. Schumpeter and Hicks appear to have taken Keynes's comment at face value, concluding from it that the General Theory analysed a time period too short for prices to adapt, which deprives it of any interest.Schumpeter's summary of the General Theory in his \\"History of economic analysis\\" attributes to Keynes the \\"hypothesis, perhaps permissible in the very short run, that it [employment] is uniquely determined by national income\\". For Hicks see \\"IS-LM ‚Äì an explanation\\" (1980/1), especially the paragraph \\"One could construct... Y is taken to be an index not only of employment, but also of output...\\". Neither author identifies the passage in the General Theory they are referring to. Brady and Gorga view Chapters 20 and 21 as providing belated elucidation of the \\"mumbo-jumbo\\" of aggregate demand presented earlier in the book, particularly in Chapter 3.\\"Integrating the Formal, Technical, Mathematical Foundations of Keynes's D-Z Model...\\" by Michael Brady and Carmine Gorga (2009). \\"Mumbo-jumbo\\" is Dennis Robertson's expression. Chapter 19: Changes in money wages =Contrast with classical view= Keynes summarizes the view of classical economists that the economy should be self-adjusting if wages are fluid, and that they blame rigidity in wages for problems like unemployment. He disagrees with what he says is the orthodox view, based on the quantity theory of money, is that wage reductions have a small effect on aggregate demand, but that this is made up for by demand for other factors of production.p. 257-8 Keynes postulates that the classical position has reached a mistaken conclusion by analysing the demand curve for a given industry and transferring this conception \\"without substantial modification to industry as a whole\\".p. 259 Keynes specifically disagrees with the theory of Arthur Cecil Pigou \\"that in the long run unemployment can be cured by wage adjustments\\" which Keynes did not see as important compared to other influences on wages.p. 278 =Keynesian analysis= Keynes considers seven different effects of lower wages (including the marginal efficiency of capital and interest rates) and whether or not they have an impact on employment.pp. 262-264He concludes that the only one that does is interest rates.p. 265 This indirect effect of wages on employment through the interest rate was termed the \\"Keynes effect\\" by Don Patinkin. Modigliani later performed a formal analysis (based on Keynes's theory, but with Hicksian units) and concluded that unemployment was indeed attributable to excessive wages.See Mr. Keynes and the \\"Classics\\". Keynes argued that interest rates can also be reduced by increasing the supply of moneyp. 266 and that this is more practical and safer than a widespread reduction in wages, which might need to be severe enough to harm consumer confidencep. 267 which would itself increase unemployment because of reduced demand. He summarises: > There is, therefore, no ground for the belief that a flexible wage policy is > capable of maintaining a state of continuous full employment;‚Äì any more than > for the belief that an open-market monetary policy is capable, unaided, of > achieving this result. The economic system cannot be made self-adjusting > along these lines.p. 267 And having come to the view that \\"a flexible wage policy and a flexible money policy come, analytically, to the same thing\\", he presents four considerations suggesting that \\"it can only be an unjust person who would prefer a flexible wage policy to a flexible money policy\\".Id. Axel Leijonhufvud attached particular significance to this chapter, adopting the view in his 1968 book Keynesian economics and the economics of Keynes that its omission from the IS- LM model had pointed Keynesian economics in the wrong direction. He argued that: > His [Keynes's] followers understandably decided to skip the problematical > dynamic analysis of Chapter 19 and focus on the relatively tractable static > IS-LM model.Peter Howitt, English draft of entry on Leijonhufvud's book for > the Darroz Dictionnaire des grandes oeuvres √©conomiques. Chapter 20: The employment function Chapter 20 is an examination of the supply function. Keynes makes use for the first time of the \\"first postulate of classical economics\\", and also for the first time assumes the existence of a unit of value allowing outputs to be compared in real terms. He depends heavily on an assumption of perfect competition, which indeed is implicit in the \\"first postulate\\". An important difference is that when competition is not perfect, \\"it is marginal revenue, not price, which determines the output of the individual producer\\".Joan Robinson, The economics of imperfect competition (1933), p. 86. Keynes interprets the relation between output and employment as a causative relation between effective demand and employment. He discusses what happens at full employmentp. 289 concluding that wages and prices will rise in proportion to any additional expenditure leaving the real economy unchanged. The money supply remains constant in wage units and the rate of interest is unaffected. Chapter 21: The theory of prices The purpose of this chapter is to examine the effect of a change in the quantity of money on the rest of the economy. Keynes does not provide a conclusive statement of his views, but rather presents an initial simplification followed by a number of corrections. =Keynes's initial simple model= Keynes's simplified starting point is this: assuming that an increase in the money supply leads to a proportional increase in income in money terms (which is the quantity theory of money), it follows that for as long as there is unemployment wages will remain constant, the economy will move to the right along the marginal cost curve (which is flat) leaving prices and profits unchanged, and the entire extra income will be absorbed by increased employment; but once full employment has been reached, wages, prices (and also profits) will increase in proportion to the money supply. This is the \\"modified quantity theory of money\\". =Quantity theory of money= Keynes does not, of course, accept the quantity theory. \\"Effective demand [meaning money income] will not\\" ‚Äì he tells us ‚Äì \\"change in exact proportion to the quantity of money\\".p. 296 The correctionp. 298 is based on the mechanism we have already described under Keynesian economic intervention. Money supply influences the economy through liquidity preference, whose dependence on the interest rate leads to direct effects on the level of investment and to indirect effects on the level of income through the multiplier. This account has the fault we have mentioned earlier: it treats the influence of r on liquidity preference as primary and that of Y as secondary and therefore ends up with the wrong formula for the multiplier. However once we correct Keynes's correction we see that he makes a valid point since the effect of money supply on income is no longer one of proportionality, and cannot be one of proportionality so long as part of the demand for money (the speculative part) is independent of the level of income. =Movement along the supply curve= Keynes reminds us that the marginal cost curve is not in fact flat (while he is not quite accurate about the reasons for this). =Premature motion of wages= Wages are exogenous in Keynes's system. In order to obtain a determinate result for the response of prices or employment to a change in money supply he needs to make an assumption about how wages will react. His initial assumption was that so long as there is unemployment workers will be content with a constant money wage, and that when there is full employment they will demand a wage which moves in parallel with prices and money supply. His corrected explanationpoint (4), page 301 is that as the economy approaches full employment, wages will begin to respond to increases in the money supply. Wage inflation remains a function of the level of employment, but is now a progressive response rather than a sharp corner. Keynes's assumptions in this matter had a significant influence on the subsequent fate of his theories. He also remarks as point (3) that some classes of worker may be fully employed while there is unemployment amongst others. =Components of marginal cost= Although we have treated an employer's marginal cost as being his or her wage bill, this is not entirely accurate. Keynes isolates user cost as a separate component, identifying it as \\"the marginal disinvestment in equipment due to the production of marginal output\\".p. 67 His point (5), which may be considered a technical detail, is that user cost is unlikely to move in exact parallel with wages. =Asymmetry of Keynes's assumptions= Keynes mentions in ¬ßV that there is an asymmetry in his system deriving from the stickiness he postulates in wages which makes it easier for them to move upwards than downwards. Without resistance to downward motion, he tells us, money wages would fall without limit \\"whenever there was a tendency for less than full employment\\" and: > ... there would be no resting-place below full employment until either the > rate of interest was incapable of falling further or wages were zero. In > fact we must have some factor, the value of which in terms of money is, if > not fixed, at least sticky, to give us any stability of values in a monetary > system. =Symbolic statement of Keynes's theory of prices= In ¬ßVI Keynes draws on the mathematical results of his previous chapter. Money supply is the independent variable, with total real output y as varying in accordance with it, and prices, wages and employment as being related to output in the same way as in Chapter 20. Constant velocity of circulation Keynes begins with the equation MV=D where: * M is the quantity of money * V is the velocity of money * D is the effective demand, the total output/income in money terms. This equation is useful to Keynes only under the assumption that V is constant, from which it follows that output in money terms D moves in proportion to M and that prices will do the same only if they move in proportion to output in money terms, i.e. only if Keynes's ep is unity. If this condition holds then it follows from the formulae for ep and \\\\epsilon above that \\\\epsilon_ u+\\\\epsilon_W is infinite and therefore that the price elasticity of supply is zero. Keynes gets an equivalent result by a different path using one of his relations between elasticities. So his conclusion is that if the velocity of circulation is constant, then prices move in proportion to money supply only in conditions in which real output is also constant. Variable velocity of circulation Keynes begins by defining a new elasticity: * e_d = \\\\frac{M}{D} \\\\frac{\\\\textrm d D}{\\\\textrm d M}. ed differs from the other elasticities in not being a property of the supply curve. The elasticity of Dw ‚Äì i.e. of Y ‚Äì with respect to M is determined by the gradients of the preference functions in Keynes's theory of employment, L(), S(), and Is(). ed is determined jointly by these things and by the elasticity of D with respect to Dw but is not analysed here. Keynes proceeds to consider the response of prices to a change in money supply asserting that: * \\\\frac{M}{p} \\\\frac{\\\\textrm d p}{\\\\textrm d M} = e_p \\\\cdot e_d\\\\qquad\\\\textrm{where}\\\\qquad e_p = 1 - e_e e_o(1-e_w). ep had been defined earlier and is now incorrectly equated to 1 - e_e e_o(1-e_w) when its true value has already been given as 1 - e_o (1-e_w). This is presumably the \\"inadequate derivation of the equations on page 305\\" mentioned by the editors of the RES edition on page 385. The likeliest explanation is that Keynes wrote this part while working with a definition of eo as the elasticity of output in real terms with respect to employment rather than with respect to output in wage units.According to Hayes ('The Economics of Keynes', 2006, p. 196) this explanation was first advanced by T. H. Naylor in 1968.

After winning the Richmond Stakes on her only start as a juvenile she took the 1000 Guineas on her three-year-old debut. She disappointed when favourite for the Epsom Oaks but returned to form to win the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. Her career was then interrupted by health problems and she was well beaten in two subsequent races. She made no impact as a broodmare. Background Winifreda was a \\"great, rangey\\" bay mare with \\"rare shoulders and depth\\" bred in England by Sir Daniel Cooper. As a two-year-old in June 1899 she was bought for 3,000 guineas by Leonard Brassey, a senior figure in the Jockey Club. During her racing career she was trained by Tom Jennings Jr at Phantom House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by St. Simon, an undefeated racehorse who was considered one of the best British runners of the 19th Century. In an outstanding stud career he won nine sires‚Äô championships, having sired ten Classic winners. Her dam Melody was a top-class racemare who won the Woodcote Stakes and the Prince of Wales's Stakes. As a broodmare she also produced St Cecilia, the female-line ancestor of the Melbourne Cup winners Backwood, Piping Lane and Tawrrific. Racing career =1899: two- year-old season= Winifreda made her first and only appearance of 1899 in the Richmond Stakes over six furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in July, in which she was ridden by Walter Bradford and started 7/4 joint-favourite in a four-runner field. After settling in third place she \\"shot out\\" and won by two lengths from Edith Crag and the colt Granite. =1900: three-year-old season= On 4 May Winifreda started the 11/2 third choice in the betting in a ten-runner field for the 87th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Sam Loates she settled behind the leaders in the centre of the wide course before moving into the lead inside the last quarter mile. She won in \\"commanding\\" fashion by three-quarters of a length from Inuisitive, with two lengths back to the favourite Vain Duchess in third and La Roche in fourth. In the Epsom Oaks on 1 June, Winifreda started 3/1 joint-favourite alongside Lady Schomberg but looked deeply unimpressive before the start, with one correspondent stating that she had lost a great deal of weight since the Guineas and was exhibiting \\"signs of wear\\" to her right foreleg. She made little impact in the race and finished seventh behind La Roche. On 13 June the filly was dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot in which she carried top weight of 129 pounds. After being restrained by her rider Thomas Weldon in the early stages she produced a strong finish and dead-heated for first place with Sainte Nitouche following a \\"sharp battle\\" in the final strides. She subsequently broke a blood vessel in training and was off the course for four months, missing an intended run in the St Leger. Winifreda returned to the track on 18 October for the valuable Sandown Foal Plate over ten furlongs. With Loates in the saddle she came home fourth of the seven runners behind Admiral Dewey, a colt to whom she was conceding eleven pounds in weight. She ended her season by finishing unplaced in the Derby Cup at Derby Racecourse over one and a half miles in November. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Winifreda an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record Winifreda was retired from racing to become a broodmare for her owner's stud. She appears to have proved difficult to get in foal with her only reported offspring being Silver Greyhound, a bay filly, foaled in 1907, and sired by King's Messenger. She was euthanized in 1912.

Career In 1977, Bengaluru hosted an important Rashtra Sevika Samiti event where Shanthakka met the then Samiti Sarkaryavahika Vandaneeya Moushiji Lakshmi Bai Kelkar. Kelkar exhorted the young woman to devote more of her time and energy to Samiti activities. By 1978, Shanthakka had taken a decision-she would devote herself full-time to the Samiti, and will not marry. The same year saw her elevation to the office of Sahakaryavahika, Karnataka region. In those days Samiti activists were not encouraged to adopt the semi-renunciate life style adopted by RSS pracharaks and travel as active field workers. They were expected to live within their families and work for the Samiti in various capacities. Shanthakka threw herself headlong into Samiti activities. The Samiti office ran out of the home of Rukminiamma, principal of Malleswaram Ladies Association College, who inspired and encouraged the young activist. In 1991, V. Shantha Kumari became Sahakaryavahika, Southern region (Karnataka,Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala). Her incessant hard work resulted in the Samiti's spread and greater visibility in southern India. She has been very dedicated to the cause of the Ramjanmabhoomi Temple. During the Ayodhya campaign in 1992, she was in the town accompanied by 200 Samiti activists from the southern states. A teacher by profession, Shantha Kumari managed to strike a balance between professional goals and her dedication to the nation. While leaving for Ayodhya she wrote an unambiguous letter to her institution's management informing them of her active participation in the Ramjanmabhoomi movement; she told them to treat the letter as her resignation from her job in case they found her participation in the movement against the policies of the institution. On her return to Bengaluru she was pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome and public felicitation accorded to her by the institution. At the insistence of the management she decided to continue with her job. In the early nineties Samiti members began to travel and work as field activists. In 1994, Shantha Kumari renounced home to live at the Samiti office at Bengaluru. In 1995, she resigned from her job and began to travel within Karnataka as a pracharika of the Samiti. 1996 onwards then Samiti Sarkaryavahika Pramila Tai Medhe took her under her wings. Her apprenticeship with Medhe gave her strong organizational skills. Her own facility for languages (English, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu) came in handy in communicating with varied audiences. The potential of her intensive campaign was noticed and she was made Sahakaryavahika in 1997. Shantha Kumari holds a record of sorts-she has apprenticed with all her predecessors- Vandaneeya Moushiji Lakshmi Bai Kelkar, Saraswati Tai Apte, Usha Tai Chati and Pramila Tai Medhe. Her association with these pioneers exposed her to the accumulated wisdom of six decades in the context of the organization and training of a dedicated cadre of women activist, a challenge anywhere, more so in India. Feminist views Shantha Kumari said she believes the Rastra Sevika Samiti to be different from other women's organizations, specially those which take the western feminist approach. She says the Samiti aims to make women more strong physically, mentally and intellectually so they may realise their potential and use it to strengthen the nation, create and guide the power of good. Her five years in office have resulted in greater visibility and diversification for the Samiti. Further reading *Bacchetta, Paola. Gender in the Hindu Nation: RSS Women as Ideologues.

The Club offered a variety of vocational skills and training to women, in additional to cultural and leisure activities. Two of its biggest goals were campaigning for women's unveiling and literacy.Heyat, F. 2002. Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94 The Ali Bayramov Women's Club was involved in many different spheres and had the overarching goal of transforming every aspect of women's lives. When German Marxist theorist and women's rights activist, Clara Zetkin, visited the Ali Bayramov club in 1924, she was greatly impressed, calling it a hub of gathering revolutionary forces.Klara Setkin.

The Club was originally founded as a literacy and sewing circle by Jeyran Bayramova with the aim of enlightening Azeri women. The Club was named after her brother-in-law whom she married after her sister's death, Ali Bayramov, who had encouraged her educational pursuits when her parents had not. Ali Bayramov, a leading Azeri Bolshevik, encouraged his wife to be active in the communist women's movement. Bayramova first proposed the Club to her school friends during her husband's funeral shortly after his death in March 1920.Heyat, F. 2002. Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94 Early on Jeyran Bayramova and several other activists on the club's presidium decided that in addition to offering conversation, prayer, and meetings, offering women the opportunity to be involved working at the sewing workshop would be an important means for attracting them to the club. Several women laid the foundations by secretly bringing their own sewing machines from their husbands and fathers‚Äô houses in order to set up the small sewing workshop. The sewing workshop which was started at the Ali Bayramov Club originally employed 7 workers, but eventually grew and was turned into the Ali Bayramov Textile Factory, where 1,500 women still work today.\\"Sharg Gadini\\" jurnalƒ± ‚Ññ2, mart 1925-ci il, Az…ôrbaycanƒ±n Milli tarix muzeyinin …ôn yeni tarix fondu. The founders faced challenges early on attracting women with organizational skills, especially given that most required permission from their husbands to participate and the male communist cadres‚Äô ambivalence towards the project. Members in the early years of the Club's activities were even targets of violence by those who thought the Club was instilling immoral values in women.Heyat, F. 2002. Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94 On May 30, 1921, D. B√ºnyadzade issued an order decreeing the first Muslim women's club in honor of comrade Ali Bayramov be established under the direction of the People's Commissariat for Education. He further declared that no other office could interfere in any of the club's work, whether administrative, financial, or organizational.Az…ôrbaycanƒ±n Milli tarix muzeyinin …ôn yeni tarix fondu.

Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94 On May 26, 1925, a ceremonial meeting was held in the assembly hall of the Ali Bayramov Club to commemorate the club's 5th anniversary.Az…ôrbaycanƒ±n Milli tarix muzeyinin …ôn yeni tarix fondu. Bilqeyis M…ômm…ôdovanƒ±n xatir…ôl…ôri The Club was closed down in 1937, by which time the younger generation of Azeri women were largely unveiled and literate. Nonetheless, the Club was known as an exemplary center for guidance among Azerbaijani women for the work that it carried out.  Activities  The Club was also a training center for cadres of women going to organize regional clubs, unveiling campaigns, and literacy courses outside of the capital. The first group of women attracted to the Club were quickly enrolled in literacy classes. After a few months the trainees had to take an exam. Some were concerned after having heard rumors that those who received good grades on the exam would be sent to work in villages around Azerbaijan. Enthusiasm grew among the trainees, many of them fearlessly embracing the challenge. Some of the women excitedly thought: ‚Äúwe came to the club, started a sewing workshop, removed our veils, abolished illiteracy, and now what? After all, there are other women who also need help.‚Äù Thus, trainees who could prove their literacy were offered jobs at provincial clubs to educate, train, politicize, and enlighten local women. By the early 1930s, there were 103 such clubs.Sultanova, A. 1964. Schastlivye Zhenschiny Sovetskogo Azerbaidzhana (Happy Women of Soviet Azerbaijan), Azerbaijan Dovlat Nashriyatti, Baku. The first group of graduates who successfully passed the exams were sent to villages throughout the republic to do the important work of the revolution‚Äî transforming Azerbaijani women into full, equal members of society. Mina Xala was sent to Shamakhi, Mesme Memmedova to Khizi, Tahire Elekberova to Goychay, Agayeva Xanim to Lankaran, Bilqeyis Esgerli to Quba, Eliyeva Xanim to Nakhchivan, and Hokume Memmedova to Shusha. History will never forget the names of these modest, courageous, fearless women who carried out the communist party's political, cultural, and educational work among Azerbaijani women. The social and political activities of the Ali Bayramov club were begun by the following talented women organizers, among others: Mina Xala, Mesme Memmedova, Melenise Melikova, Xaver ≈ûabanova-Qarayeva, Mesme Xala Elekberova, Mina Mirzeyeva, Hokume Memmedova, Q. Qedirbeyova, B. Qafarova, M. Mirqedirova, Fatma Haciyeva, B. Memmedova, S.

Bilqeyis M…ômm…ôdovanƒ±n xatir…ôl…ôri Another important function of the Club was its broader educational initiatives. The club offered literacy, vocational, and university access courses. Vocational training included telephone operating, accounting, nursing, midwifery, and sewing and weaving. In addition to the sewing workshop, many members of the Club also became midwives. The Club's midwifery course was eventually turned into the School of Midwifery in Baku.Heyat, F. 2002. Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94 Additionally, the club also offered women entertainment and socialization, which was previously inaccessible to women largely confined to working in the home or visiting the mosque.Heyat, F. 2002. Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94 There were a range of cultural, sports, and leisure activities, including plays and musical events performed by troupes of women, film screenings, game rooms (chess, backgammon, billiards), and dance classes.

All characters are from the original manga unless otherwise noted. Martial Artists =Hokuto Shinken= . Called \\"God Fist of the North Star\\" in the Gutsoon! Entertainment English translation. ; :The main character and 62nd successor to Hokuto Shinken. Known in Shanghai as . An avid smoker, reader, and endowed with an uncanny sense of smell, he places friends above almost everything else (for example, he is not shy about threatening Japanese soldiers into helping him to find Li√∫ Fƒìi-Y√†n during the Battle of Shanghai, telling them that he cares nothing for their war). His fighting technique is similar to that of Toki in Fist of the North Star, in which he fights in a fluid and smooth fighting style. In Japan, he is a lecturer at the T≈çwa Women's University and is popular with his students due to his quirky and paternal personality. Despite being depicted as somewhat easy going, as well as comical, he uses the same chilling catch-phrase as his nephew, , but says it in Chinese, \\"N«ê y«ê jƒ´ng s«ê le\\" (), or Niichinsura. ; :Kenshiro's younger half-brother, who goes on to become the 63rd successor of Hokuto Shinken, otherwise known as . He named the infant Kenshiro (from Fist of the North Star) in honor of his brother Kenshiro Kasumi, who were both born with a birthmark shaped as the Big Dipper on their head. He refers to his older brother, Kenshiro, as the \\"Strongest Hokuto Shinken warrior\\" who was \\"mighty as the blue sky above.\\" The young Ramon appears thorough the series, first protecting Aya Kitaoji from hired thugs, later serving as a bodyguard to PƒÅn Y√π-L√≠ng against the T√†i H√∫ BƒÅng during her stay in Japan. ; :Father of Kenshir≈ç and Ramon; he was the 61st successor of Hokuto Shinken. As a young man he sought to fight Li√∫ Xu√°n-X√¨n in the \\"Tenju no Gi\\" challenge, but Li√∫ had become too old to fight. Tesshin fell in love with Xu√°n-X√¨n's daughter, and they conceived a son, Kenshiro. Tesshin once fought W√®i Ru√¨-Yƒ´ng, founder of Kyokuj≈´ji Seiken, to a draw. Tesshin remarked that Ru√¨-Yƒ´ng may have been able to defeat him had he not lost a leg. ; :The founder of Hokuto Shinken, first mentioned in Fist of the North Star. He became an apprentice of Seito Gekken 2,000 years ago, learning its secrets of the Keiraku Hik≈ç pressure points and blending it with the original Hokuto style. In order to fulfill his destiny as foreordained by the Hokuto S≈çke priests, he killed the other disciples of Seito Gekken, including his lover Yahma (who it is later revealed actually committed suicide), and established the one successor rule for Hokuto Shinken so that its dangerous secrets would not fall into the wrong hands. However, Kenshiro‚Äôs battle with Yasaka reveals that there is more to the massacre than first thought, as Shuken had also been shown a vision of the future where the Seito Gekken style becomes nothing more than a weapon of war, and would be the cause of so many atrocities that Shuken felt that he had to destroy the style and seal away his own before it came to that. =Hokuto Sankaken= The are three martial arts styles that branched off from Hokuto Shinken during the Three Kingdoms period and went on to develop their styles independently after the main Hokuto Shinken school was relocated to Japan. They are named after the Cao, Sun and Liu families, which they were each sworn to protect and serve. The Liu Family Fist would later branched off from the other school and become the Hokuto Ry≈´ken school from Fist of the North Star. ; :Also known as . A master of the , he learn the forbidden art of , which drives its users insane and shortens their lifespan. He was the one that took Pan Yu-Ling's memory because he fell in love with her, but also because he thinks this is a fitting punishment to Kenshiro. He got his wish to \\"fight someone worthy of taking my life\\" granted by the Old Taoist Fortune Teller. He was already dying from a slow decaying death from his self-inflicted pressure points by then. In contrast to Yan Wang's smelling instinct, he possesses great hearing instinct which allows him to hear conversations miles away. ; :A French Jew and colonel in the French army that works with the Qing-Bang. Although he knows the Sun Family Fist, he prefers using conventional fighting methods like guns and swords; however, if necessary, he uses Sonkaken combined with either his saber or pistol and only truly uses it when he fights seriously, otherwise, he'd usually surrender, summons his soldiers, or fight regularly using firearms or fencing. He has a sister, Sophie, who suffered trauma resulting in memory suppression due to her experiences in escaping from Nazi Germany as her husband (a non-Jewish German who was prohibited from marrying her by Nazi law) got sent to a concentration camp. When she regained her memory by Kenshiro's acupressure, she was assassinated by Zhang Tai Yan. De Guise was eventually wounded fatally by Li√∫ Fƒìi-Y√†n when the latter deemed him unfit to take care of Erika and challenged him to a duel. Kenshiro used acupressure techniques on him to prolong his life just long enough to watch his friends staging a glimpse of his vision- a Shanghai in prosperity (where Jews can take refuge). Believing that Kenshiro and friends will make it come true, he then died in peace. ; :Successor to the and the H√≥ng Hu√° Hu√¨'s No.2 man. Although he appears laid back, he can be destructive when angered, his attacks are based on cutting and slicing with his hands. Has a monstrous libido and is known as the \\"Bride Thief\\" because of his habit of killing newlywed husbands and taking their wives. He assassinated Charles de Guise's little sister with a time bomb. His next target was L«ê Xi√π- B«éo, because of her resemblance to Pan, but when Kenshiro revealed that L«ê Xi√π-B«éo was Yu-Ling, it made him more determined to claim her, resulting in him fighting Kenshiro with all his strength. Due to a misunderstanding, he believed his stepfather ZhƒÅng D√†-Y√°n killed his mother and yearns to kill him for it. Later on, after learning the truth, he repented all his past sins with de Guise agreeing not to seek revenge for the time being.

Father of the Hong Hua Hui boss, ZhƒÅng Li√®-ShƒÅn. He later married ZhƒÅng T√†i-Y√°n's mother and had been led to believe T√†i-Y√°n was his child when he was actually the son of her previous husband. Years later D√†-Y√°n was enraged to learn the truth and his wife killed herself on the condition D√†-Y√°n spare ZhƒÅng T√†i-Y√°n's life. Noticing the young T√†i-Y√°n's talent, he adopted him and trained him in S≈çkaken. Eventually D√†-Y√°n passed on the title of S≈çkaken Master to T√†i-Y√°n after T√†i-Y√°n defeated him. However, D√†-Y√°n then died as a result of injuries from the fight. ; :An order of monks who serve ZhƒÅng T√†i-Y√°n. Each is known only by the number of stars they have tattooed on their heads. Their true purpose is to help T√†i-Y√°n become a worthy successor of Hokuto S≈çkaken; under the orders of ZhƒÅng D√†-Y√°n. They were challenged by De Guise, who was intent on protecting Kenshiro, who was fighting Tai-Yan at the time; realizing what De Guise was trying to do, the group thanked him. All of them are armed with a Khakkhara, which they are able to pierce through any object, especially metal. ; :Successor to the . Driven to revenge by the death of his family, Z≈çng-W«î turned evil and joined the Nazis as a German army officer even though he is Chinese. He had the chance to kill Adolf Hitler, but didn't because he felt Hitler is too pitiful a prey for him to kill. He later renounces his evil ways and becomes a monk. He bears a strong resemblance Raoh, implying he may be a blood relative or a past life incarnation. ; :Li√∫ Z≈çng-W«î's former lover. She had her nipples ripped off by him when she attempted to dissuade him from joining the Nazis. She then became a Buddhist nun, but in spite of what Z≈çng- W«î did she still loves him deeply‚Äîwhile she claimed to be wishing to see Z≈çng- W«î dead, she really meant that she wants to see him living out his destiny. ; :An orphaned young boy whose sister was killed.

A relatively new style compared to the Hokuto styles, its astrological symbol is the constellation of the Southern Cross and uses stabbing techniques that destroys the body externally. It's assumed to be the precursor to the Nanto Seiken styles. ; :The grubby founder of Kyokuj≈´ji Seiken. Ru√¨-Yƒ´ng was at first the most promising student of Hokuto Ry≈´kaken of his generation, but left after he became disgruntled since he considered all other practitioners of Ry≈´kaken too weak by his standards. When he left he asked his Hokuto Ry≈´kaken master for the right to challenge Hokuto Shinken in order to become the strongest Hokuto Master, but was refused. He then fought his own master but was hit with a poisoned arrow in the leg during the process, which he then chopped off. W√®i Ru√¨-Yƒ´ng later fought Kasumi Tesshin, Kenshir≈ç's father and 61st successor of Hokuto Shinken, to a draw. ; :W√®i Ru√¨-Yƒ´ng's elder student. Prepared for death, he challenged Kenshiro, but was shot to death by the Nazis before their actual duel.

Nicknamed the Death Bird Demon (Ê≠ªÈ≥•È¨º, S«ê Ni«éo Gu«ê), he befriended Erika and risked his life to protect her. He challenged Charles de Guise to a duel because he thought de Guise cannot bear the responsibility of protecting Erika and ended up killing de Guise. This led to a fight with Kenshiro, and although he was defeated, Erika's influence on him earned him Kenshiro's forgiveness. He was mortally wounded at the hands of Yasaka. Fƒìi- Y√†n, knowing that he was certain to die from his injuries and unwilling to add to Erika's grief by making her witness his death (although, despite Kenshiro and friends' best efforts to avoid mentioning his death, Erika is eventually able to figure it out), asked Kenshiro to send him to sea in a boat. There he recounted all the good things Erika did for him before drawing his last breath. =Seito Gekken= \\"West Dipper Lunar Fist\\" (Ë•øÊñóÊúàÊã≥, Pinyin: Xƒ´d«íu Yu√®qu√°n). A martial art of the Yuezhi people. Shuken studied this martial art and blended it with his Hokuto S≈çke no Ken (ÂåóÊñóÂÆóÂÆ∂„ÅÆÊã≥, lit. \\"North Dipper Lineage's Fist\\") to create Hokuto Shinken. Seito Gekken uses the Keiraku Hik≈ç, the same vital points used by Hokuto Shinken, to cause destruction, but does so through hitting multiple points through the course of a fight rather than hitting a single point. ; :A mysterious green-eyed warrior. A descendant of the Yuezhi who carries their nearly 2,000-year grudge against the Hokuto for Shuken's massacre of the practitioners of Seito Gekken. He works as a bodyguard for D√π TiƒÅn-Fƒìng. He claims his name is ancient Hebrew for \\"to see God\\". He eventually gives up his vendetta after Kenshiro shows him the truth about the massacre, in which it is revealed that Shuken had been shown a future where the users of Seito Gekken would be reduced to mere mercenaries and assassins selling their skills to the highest bidder and causing untold pain and misery wherever they went, and leaves on good terms with his former rival. He appears in the second closing credits of the S≈çten no Ken anime. ; :A female practitioner from 2,000 years ago that was the lover of Shuken. She was initially thought to have been killed by Shuken, but was later revealed to have committed suicide to spare her lover the pain of killing her.

The Nahash existed before Christ and defended Migdol and the Promised Land. It is a development of the Seito Gekken style from when the Nahash people from the west met the Yuezhi people from the east. Its proponents produce glowing fists which leave burn marks on their opponents. This style is used by Van der Kohl, Simeon Nagid, Himuka, and Shomer. ;; :Leader of the remnants of the Nahash people and hoping to fulfill the Nahash prophesy and recreate the world with Migadol's Thunderbolts. ;; :Initially a supporter of Simeon Nagid whom he grew up with, but following Simeon's death, his intention is to recreate the world with Migadol's Thunderbolts for his own benefit.

She first met Kenshir≈ç after he was badly beaten and she nursed him back to health. She also appears to be some sort of Christian. Her adopted father promised her to M√°ng Ku√°ng-Y√∫n as payment. But Y√π-L√≠ng was already in love with Kenshiro, and a jealous Ku√°ng- Y√∫n erased her memory and left her with a nomadic warlord in Northern China. She became the horse bandit leader L«ê Xi√π-B«éo (Êùé ÁßÄÂØ∂, Ri Sh≈´h≈ç), fighting small guerrilla battles against the Imperial Japanese Army, gaining a sense of hatred against the Japanese. She also learned some Praying Mantis martial art. She eventually regains her memories in Shanghai after meeting Kenshiro again, and soon marries him.

Formerly served in the Beiyang Army, he joins the National Revolutionary Army following the collapse of the Beiyang government, eventually becoming a general (this character reflects real historical support the Kuomintang received from various Triad gangs), but also works in secret with Chinese communist groups as well to his own benefit. His father did not train him in Hokuto S≈çkaken, something he is very resentful for, but due to his giant stature and overwhelming physical strength he is still deadly wielding a pair of matching giant sai. He later repented his actions after learning the truth behind his father not training him (that ZhƒÅng D√†-Y√°n could never bring himself to engage his own son in the fight to decide on the new Master of Hokuto S≈çkaken, a fight that can very well turn deadly). ; :The Number Three Boss after ZhƒÅng Li√®-ShƒÅn & ZhƒÅng T√†i-Y√°n.

Genoan use In ancient times through the Colla di Boasi passed the ancient path, probably the existence of which began from Roman times, called the \\"road of salt\\". On this \\"road of salt\\" on mules were transported goods and food from Genoa to Piacenza and vice versa. This path connected the east of Genoa with the Valley of Po. The first mention in the documents about the place of Colla di Boasi is linked to the battle that took place on 1 May 1747. The army of the Republic of Genoa on Mount Lavanjola was attacked by the army of the √ñrgerzog of Austria and, repulsing the attacks, it was forced to relocate to the place of Colla di Boasi, where an army of 1,000 soldiers from Genoa led by Pier Maria Canevari came to its aid. After this, the army of the Genoese Republic managed to defeat the Austrians. French use The second mention of the place Colla di Boasi comes on 1800, when on 5 March, about 800 French soldiers moved from the Colla di Boasi to Boazi by the orders of General Andrea Massena to suppress the uprising in Valle Fontanabuona and the riots in the Ligurian Republic. Later, in 1898, in the place of Colla di Boasi, Signor Genserico Benvenuto began the construction of a small castle \\"Colla di Boasi\\" and in 1905 completed the construction. Wildlife In the first half of the twentieth century, Colla di Boasi hosts one of two state-licensed points for tracking migratory and nesting birds in Liguria. Under the direction of Genserico Benvenuto, a lot of work is done to catch and further ring the various species of birds that nest in Liguria, such as Carduelis cannabina (Linnet), Emberiza melanocephala (Blackhead oatmeal), Accipitrinae (Hawks), Carduelis spinus (Eurasian siskin), Anthus trivialis (Forest horseshoe), etc. For these purposes, in Colla di Boasi was completing the household premises for short- term content of birds.

Prior to its passage, various stakeholders believed the delay in passing the bill into law was to allow exemptions of certain vital information bordering around government policies which they intend to conceal from the public (Akoto, 2012). source . This bill is to enable citizens to hold government accountable to ensure that there is a high level of transparency in governance of the country. Right to information bill in other countries The right to information is not a new on the continent. It was first adopted by Sweden in 1766 and Finland in 1951. Over the past two decades many African countries have also adopted the laws, indicating acknowledgement that transparency is an essential condition of democracy. Currently 24% of the African countries have adopted the law. These countries include: South Africa, Angola, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Liberia, Guinea and Ghana. Access to Information and Privacy Act in Zimbabwe has rather been used to protect information instead of making it available to the general public all in the name of privacy. As a result, it is not included in counts of RTI laws sometimes (Good law and practice, 2012). Source . The Middle East has only three countries adopting the law (Jordan, Yemen and Israel) and it started in the January 2013. In Asia and the Pacific sixteen countries have adopted the access to information laws. They include: Bangladesh, India, Australia, Tajikistan, South Korea, Thailand, Cook Islands, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Uzbekistan Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, and Pakistan. Fifteen countries in the Americas and six in the Caribbean had access to information laws as of September 2013. Source History The right to information Bill is implicit in the notion that the Ghanaian taxpayers need to have access to information concerning what government does with their money and what government plans to do on their behalf (Daily Graphic, July 21, 2017a). The bill is meant to ensure Ghanaians have access to governance or official information from public offices on request and without request (Boateng, 2018). The Bill is meant to put in effect, Article 21 (1) (f) of the 1992 constitution of the republic of Ghana which states that ‚ÄúAll persons shall have the right to information subject to such qualifications and laws as are necessary in a democratic society.‚Äù (Daily Graphic, July 21, 2017b). However, many years of struggle in parliamentary debates and reviews has seen the bill not passed into law yet despite it was first drafted in 1999 and reviewed 2003 (Daily Graphic, July 21, 2017c).

It was launched in 2005 by editor-in-chief Mirela Roznovschi, then NYU Law School's Foreign and International Law Reference Librarian, with the support of professor Joseph H. H. Weiler and dean Richard Revesz. Roznovschi conceived of the project while in Armenia as a guest instructor in legal research, and in 2003 after her return to NYU, she discussed the idea with Weiler, who came up with the name. GlobaLex publishes articles both on topical areas, such as treaty research (particularly travaux pr√©paratoires), regional trade agreements in Africa, or the TRIPS Agreement, as well as guides to the laws of specific jurisdictions. By 2007, GlobaLex had coverage of more than 80 jurisdictions. By 2012, that had expanded to a total of 195 research guides, including 144 guides for specific jurisdictions, 15 comparative law guides, and 32 international law guides. As editor-in-chief, Roznovschi was responsible for finding authors who are experts in their topic areas to write guides to specific jurisdictions or topic areas, and to supervise the process of writing the article. Some authors write a guide in a foreign language and have it translated into English, with the whole process often taking as long as a year. GlobaLex pays a small honorarium to authors to offset basic expenses. In 2017, Lucie Olejnikova replaced Roznovschi as editor-in-chief following the retirement of the latter. Because of GlobaLex's breadth, law librarians frequently recommend it as a valuable resource for legal research.

They were established in 1688 and were a well-disciplined force, responsible for the security of the royal family and the maintenance of order within the palace grounds.  History  The unit, also known as the \\"palace Amazons\\" or \\"the Amazon regiment\\", was established in 1688 to replace the 600 European mercenaries and Christian samurai troops that had previously been employed by the King of Siam. The all-women force was schooled in the use of the musket; Jessica Salmonson describes them as the best trained force in all of Siam. Similar troops were used in Burma to guard the private apartments of that country's princes (foreign male troops were utilised outside of the apartments). The duties of the regiment were to keep order in the palace grounds (in which role Salmonson regards them as \\"fierce\\") and to protect the lives of the king and those of his wives and family. Michael Smithies describes them as a \\"police force ... who were drilled like soldiers\\" and had responsibility for the maintenance of order among the 3-9,000 residents of the palace. The unit was to also brought into action during revolts if the regular Siamese army had failed to contain the threat. The unit accompanied the king on all occasions including hunting and riding.  Organisation, arms and uniform  An 1888 wire article in the New Zealand newspaper the Otago Witness provides detailed information on the organisation, arms and uniform of the force. It cites an interview in England with a brother of King Chulalongkorn that the unit comprised 400 women, divided into four companies of 100 with new entrants, selected for their beauty and strength, being accepted from the age of 13 and retired to a reserve at the age of 25. The reserve troops were used to guard the palaces and crown lands, while the main bodyguard protected the king's person. Entrants were required to take a vow of chastity, with an exception being made if any were selected to become a wife of the king. Each member of the unit was allocated five black female servants, to allow her to devote herself entirely to her duties. In regular duty, each member was equipped with a musket, but was also trained to use a pistol. Training was carried out for two days each week on a training ground in the capital, with the king and his brother attending once a month to award prizes to the best performing soldiers. The Otago Witness described a dress uniform comprising a gold- embroidered white knee-length woolen robe over which was worn a light mail coat and gilt cuirass. A gilt helmet was also worn and the full-dress weapon was a lance. A second uniform is described in a 1984 edition of Sawaddi magazine and comprised blue pantaloons (chong kraben) with white jackets and cream scarves.  Ma Ying Taphan  The head of the bodyguard was discussed in Anna Leonowens' 1873 book The Romance of the Harem, where she was named Ma Ying Taphan \\"The Great Mother of War\\". Steven Erlanger describes the book as \\"full of historical errors\\" and \\"a novel built on a fabrication\\" driven by a need to publish rather than by the author's experiences at the Siamese court. This work, which has been repeated by later reports such as a 1921 Pittsburgh newspaper article, ascribes to the commander a judicial role over offences committed by members of the king's harem. She was said to hold court in a hall from which a trapdoor opened directly into the palace dungeon and was permitted to sentence offenders to flogging, torture on the rack, flaying alive and burning alive.

The first men who inhabited the Mexican lands and part of Central America were great builders and later on creators of some of the biggest civilizations of that time, however the economy of that time was based on the commercial activities, the division of society in classes and the importance that generated in the economy the so-called Tlatoani.  Pre-classic Period  = The Pre-classic period in Mesoamerica (2500 B.C. - 200 A.D.) = Pre-Columbian art figurines During this period there was an increment in the population and sedentarism, causing the origin of complex societies with intensive cropping systems. Some researchers said that agriculture forced societies to adopt sedentary lifestyle; others think that the reason was due to the increment in the population since agriculture could supply more food than hunting. The ancient cultures developed on that period had the tendency to manufacture and modernize ceramics. Ceramic was very important because it allowed a better transportation of materials as well as the use of ovens to create special handcrafts such as female figurines.Economic Anthropology (Stanford University Press) 1898, p.254-286. Stuart Plattner. . = The early Pre-classic (2500 B.C. - 1200 B.C.) = In this period began the settlement of ancient societies, groups of small villages or small houses inhabited by large families. However, there was still not a social structure until the middle and late Preclassic period. In agriculture, societies that settled in states such as Puebla, Tlaxcala and Tabasco started to domesticate wild plants such as corn, amaranth, pumpkin, chili pepper and green tomato. On the other hand, in the peninsula of Yucatan and Mexico, they had not yet domesticated plants. = The middle Pre-classic (1200 B.C. - 400 B.C.) = During this period, the society was divided into classes and each of them had different activities. People from the upper class or elite groups were dedicated to the organization of commerce as well as religious ceremonies, while in the lower class were mainly focused on agriculture and the construction of cities. Long-distance trade between the ancient cultures of Mesoamerica was increasing. But above all, regional specialization was a key factor during this period. Trade was also important in order to create allegiances among their allies and vassals. However, long- distance trade was not very large since it didn‚Äôt exist any transportation for the exchange of the goods; for that reason, some cultures sent people (Tamemes) walking to those destinations. The Tamemes were in charge to carry all the products on their backs and there was a relay after every certain distance. = Civilizations of the middle Pre-classic (1200 B.C. - 400 B.C.) =  Olmecs  Olmec Head (Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a) The Olmecs is considered the mother culture of the Pre-Columbian civilizations. The Olmecs regional center was San Lorenzo (1150 - 900 B.C.) and even though their economic activity in this center is still unknown, obsidian workshops have been found. The second capital of the Olmecs was La Venta (900 ‚Äì 500 B.C.) where, due to its location and easy access to natural resources, took place many important activities such as fishing, hunting and overall, agriculture.  Mayas  The Maya civilization based their economy mainly on the agriculture trade, but hunting of wild animals and collecting forest products were also important activities. Maya agriculture was also based on harvesting corn.Maya civilization 2014, p. 14. Robert J. Sharer and Loa P. Traxler. . The population increment during the early and late pre-classic forced the rulers to find alternatives for high-productive harvesting. Intensive methods were introduced that made use of irrigation channels and special techniques associated with hydraulic engineering. They were also trading products like salt, seashells, obsidian, jade and Quetzal feathers, with other nearby regions.\\"Los Mayas\\"  Aztecs  The Aztec economy was based on agriculture and trade. Agriculture provided a great variety of fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, chili peppers, pumpkins, and beans, necessary to feed the high number of inhabitants in the empire. The Aztec agrarian economy is considered one of the most evolved of Indigenous America, only surpassed by the system implemented in the Andean area. The products that could not be obtained in the Valley of Mexico were acquired through trading with other regions by merchants, who traveled long distances. In the market of Tenochtitlan, all kinds of merchandise were traded, included product from the Pacific and Atlantic ocean, both of them 500 km away from the Aztec capital. In order to trade ‚Äúprimitive coins‚Äù were used such as cacao seeds and Quetzal feathers. The Aztec economic system based on this simple way of trading was highly efficient and maintained great stability and ensured the welfare of the majority of the population of the empire.\\"Economia Tolteca: Crecimiento y desarrollo\\".  Toltecs  Among the first economic activities of the Toltec culture is agriculture, through the cultivation of chili, corn and beans as well as maguey, the raw material for the alcoholic beverage called ‚Äòpulque‚Äô, and cotton. Later on, they specialized in other fields such as handicrafts made of cotton, as well as practices of trade and tribute. They started to create ‚Äòmonopolies‚Äô that held back the trade with other civilizations and regions under their authority in order to ensure their own economic and patrimonial wealth. The tribute system was something very characteristic of this culture, it consisted of the request and payment of scarce or new product to the tribes or regions that were conquered. Similarly, merchants that needed to cross their territories had to pay these tributes. That way Toltecs managed to control and administrate all their territories and took great advantage of their commercial areas and natural resources.\\"Fuentes de subsistencia\\".  Tlaxcala  Indian collecting woodlouse In Tlaxcala, they specialized in trading corn and woodlouse. This type of insect was very appreciated because it was used to elaborate red color paint which was later used in textiles. In exchange for those goods, they received products like cocoa, cotton, chili, vanilla, feathers, tobacco, wax, honey and maguey. The market of Ocotero was the main commercial center where, according to some authors, more than 20 thousand went every day to trade for products such as cocoa and cotton blankets brought by the Mayans. Due to their bad relationship with Tlaxcala, the Aztecs tried to prevent their trading with the regions nearby the Gulf of Mexico.Camargo, D. M. (1892). Historia de Tlaxcala. M√©xico: Oficina de la Secretaria de Fomento.  Mixtecs  In Mesoamerica, there was a very limited number of domesticated animals. The turkey and the ancient dog called Xoloitzcuintle are two examples, both of them were sources of meat consumed on a small scale in the indigenous societies. The basis of the Mixtecs economy was not only agriculture but also, hunting, the collection of materials and fishing to complement their diet and to cover other needs. One of the advantages they had was its great diversity of microclimates, reason why many of the manors that developed in that area were self-sufficient. The inhabitants were incorporated into a wide network of trading among other Mesoamerican civilizations. In addition to the fruits and woodlouse, they were trading with precious metals and handicrafts. From very early dates they were integrated as producers of minerals, especially magnetite. It has been proven that during the Middle Pre-classic period the red ceramic was a product of trade with the Olmecs of the Gulf of Mexico.J√°come, A. G. (2003). Cultura y agricultura: transformaciones en el agro mexicano. Universidad Iberoamericana.  Valley of Mexico  Chinampas Many capitals emerged in the Valley of Mexico such as Tlacopaya, Tatilco, and Coapexco; also these capitals were in charge of the trading routes. In those routes took place trade of different goods like asphalt, cinnabar, quartz, obsidian and, pyrite. Researchers have found that approximately in the year 1000 B.C. there was a great development in of hydraulic systems in semiarid regions, with the use of the chinampa, many cultures could have a better use of the land. In the Valley of Oaxaca, there was an increment in the population and a better-structured society. The most important period of that region was San Jose Mogote, which had several adobe and stone platforms and was surrounded by many villages that produced different products like salt or were specialized in the production of handcrafts.  Trade of civilizations during the middle Pre-classic  Some examples of the most important places for trade and the product they were trading are the following: * Cuenca de M√©xico and Guatemalan altiplano ‚Äì Obsidian * Valley of Morelos ‚Äì Kaolinite * Valley of Oaxaca ‚ÄìMagnetite * Pacific Coast of Chiapas ‚Äì Cocoa * Maya civilization ‚Äì Quetzal feathers = The late Pre-classic (400 B.C. - 200 A.D.) = During this period there was an increment in the construction of buildings, roads, hydraulic systems used for water storage and drainage. Also, the creation of chinampa‚Äôs and terraces allowed a better production of food which generated an increment in the population and the strengthening of centralized government. Later cities were abandoned searching for other capitals such as Teotihuac√°n, Cholula or Cuicuilco which were richer and had a stronger centralized government.  Cuicuilco  Arrowhead made of obsidian Cuicuilco was the most important region in the Pre-classic, built on a very fertile land surrounded by volcanoes, among them, the Xitle volcano. It had a population of 53.000 people which was one of the most populated cities after Teotihuac√°n. Unfortunately, due to the eruption caused by the volcano Xitle in 100 B.C. a huge part of the population died.\\"Descubren una gran estela ligada al culto agr√≠cola en Cuicuilco, de 3000 a√±os de antig√ºedad, contempor√°nea de la cultura Olmeca\\" Another natural disaster occurred in 1 A.D., the eruption of the volcano Popocat√©petl caused the population of capital cities liked Chacaltzingo, Atlantepec, Cuajimalpa, Amaluacan, etc. to move to other capitals such as Cholula, Totimehuacan, and Teotihuac√°n. Thus those capitals became megalopolis which had an exponential growth in economy and culture. Researchers affirm that the Pyramid of the Sun and Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuac√°n were expected to be finished after two centuries, however, with the arrival of more people to work, the project was finished later. The main economic activity in Teotihuac√°n was agriculture and trade, as well as the tributes that they received from other cultures that were under their domain. Agriculture in Teotihuac√°n had innovations such as the construction of terraces, chinampa and irrigation channels. Teotihuac√°n exported mainly cocoa, cotton, and obsidian. Near of Teotihuac√°n were large amounts of obsidian, a stone used to elaborate knives, arrowheads or sculptures; this allowed to trade obsidian with all the civilizations of Mesoamerica. In the Valley of Oaxaca, the great city of Monte Alb√°n reached 14000 inhabitants (200 B.C.- 250 A.D.) and they were trading with Teotihuac√°n crops like corn, beans, and avocado for obsidian, jade, pottery, and salt.  Classical Period (200 A.D. - 900 A.D.)  Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuac√°n This period is characterized by the growth of many civilizations that built large cities and improved their techniques in agriculture, goldsmithing, and ceramics. From the year 400 A.D., an increment in the efficiency of agricultural techniques achieved the transformation of the societies of that time, which besides being administrative and religious centers, served as production complexes and shopping centers. Throughout the history of the sedentary civilizations of ancient Mexico there was an important trade, especially of durable goods: specifically, raw materials and finished artifacts that were used in work processes, in war, and in rituals. Teotihuac√°n, the most important city of the period, had a strong influence throughout Mesoamerica, not because of its economic or military capacity, or because of its particular organization, but because of its role as producer and distributor of goods for exchange. The Maya civilization also played an important role in the Mesoamerican economy, with markets in a growing number of Mayan cities. Cities of the Altiplano had markets in permanent squares, which were attended by officials to resolve disputes, enforce standards, and collect taxes. However, the city that dominated trading was Teotihuac√°n, who traded with places as far away as New Mexico or Guatemala. Other important economic activities of Teotihuac√°n were the handicraft production (pottery and obsidian manufacture) and the long-distance trade. In both cases, there was an important specialization and, due to the demand, it was necessary to modify techniques to produce massively (for example, through the use of molds and modeling without a lathe in the case of pottery). Teotihuac√°n political and economic hegemony was based on two foreign products, over which they had a monopoly: the ‚Äúorange pottery ‚Äú, produced in the Valley of Puebla-Tlaxcala, and the mineral deposits in the nowadays state of Hidalgo. The existence of trade routes and redistributing centers between the great urban center of Teotihuac√°n and practically the rest of the Mesoamerican regions is undeniable. In Matacap√°n, located five kilometers east of San Andr√©s de Tuxtla, Veracruz, it has been postulated as a Teotihuacan enclave that operated as a redistribution of merchandise of the great city.  Post-classic Period (900 A.D. ‚Äì 1521 A.D.)  = The early Post-classic (900 A.D. ‚Äì 1168 A.D.) = The changes that occurred in this period did not bring significant transformations to the great civilizations. Approximately 80% of the population of Teotihuac√°n left the city. New forms of colonization were established, as well as alliances between manors to consolidate certain routes and commercial flows. The war was a constant in the last centuries of Mesoamerica, generating instability in the development in a significant way. By the year 900 A.D. Teotihuac√°n had been abandoned and Tula became the main urban center of the Valley of Mexico. The nearby rivers allowed to create a network of irrigation channels that facilitated feeding their inhabitants. The power of Tula was supported by the broad and strong network with other civilizations, also having cities that were under their control. = Social classes = Back then societies had no social structure, all families lived under the same conditions, the only one that stood out was the Tlatoani. There were three types of workers: landlords, land workers, and slaves. The landlords work other people's land but were not required to remain in perpetuity in those lands. The land workers dealt with patrimonial lands and lived nearby but they had to give most of the production of these lands away; also they didn‚Äôt have land of their own and were obliged to remain permanently in those lands. Slavery was not important from the economic point of view, but there were two types of slaves: the domestic ones and those that were used for sacrifice. The teuctli or tecutli, second rank of the nobility (below the Tlatoani), were old men, rich and prominent or sons of warriors who gained some distinction in the war or shown a lot of courage; it was necessary that they possess numerous assets, since they had to distribute many of them when they reached that rank, some merchants also had the same distinction. The rest of the population received the name of macehuales or macahualtin. They were in charge to help people from upper classes and they worked the land. Their way of dressing was very simple, without ornaments, because the costumes denoted the social class they belong to. The basic social unit was the family: a group of families formed a calpulli or neighborhood, their importance was not just in the family but also in military, politics, and religion. Each calpulli had its own god, temple, and particular ceremonies.Kelly, I. (2014). Folk Practices in North Mexico: Birth Customs, Folk Medicine, and Spiritualism in the Laguna Zone.

The electric field is applied by a pair of electrodes after the parts being joined are clamped together. The clamping force is maintained until the joint solidifies. Advantages of this process are fast cycle times (on the order of a few seconds), automation, repeatability, and good weld appearance. Only plastics which have dipoles can be heated using radio waves and therefore not all plastics are able to be welded using this process. Also, this process is not well suited for thick or overly complex joints. The most common use of this process is lap joints or seals on thin plastic sheets or parts.  Heating mechanism  Polarity demonstrated with a water molecule. The region shaded in red around the oxygen atom is partially more negatively charged than the region shaded in blue around the hydrogen atoms. Four types of polarization can occur in materials subjected to high-frequency alternating electric fields: * Electronic or electric polarization is the redistribution of electrons * Ionic polarization is the redistribution of charged particles cations and anions * Maxwell-Wagner polarization is a charge buildup at the interfaces of non-homogeneous materials * Dipole polarization is the realignment of permanent dipoles Polarity of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), with accumulation of negative charge concentration in red (surrounding more electronegative chlorine atoms) and reduced negative charge concentration in blue (surrounding less electronegative hydrogen side of molecule). Dipole polarization is the phenomenon that is responsible for the heating mechanism in Radio Frequency plastic welding, dielectric heating. When an electric field is applied to a molecule with an asymmetric distribution of charge, or dipole, the electric forces cause the molecule to align itself with the electrical field. When an alternating electrical field is applied, the molecule will continuously reverse its alignment, leading to molecular rotation. This process is not instantaneous, therefore if the frequency is high enough, the dipole will be unable to rotate quickly enough to stay aligned with the electric field resulting in random motion as the molecule attempts to follow the electrical field. This motion causes intermolecular friction which leads to heat generation.Troughton, M. J. (2008). Handbook of plastics joining: A practical guide. Norwich, NY: William Andrew. The amount of heat generated by friction in the material is dependent on field strength, frequency, dipole strength, and free volume in the material. Since the main driving force for dielectric heating is the interaction of the dipole of a molecule with the applied electrical field, RF welding can only be conducted on dipole molecules. The typical frequency range for dielectric heating is 10-100 MHz but normally RF Welding is conducted around 27 MHz. At too low of frequency, the dipoles are able to align themselves with the electrical field and stay in phase with the electrical current minimizing the intermolecular friction that is produced. This can also be described as having minimal power loss from the electrical field since the molecules will stay in phase and absorb minimal energy. As frequencies become high enough, power loss starts to increase as the dipoles are unable to align themselves at the rate of the reversing electrical field. The dipoles become out of phase absorbing energy and this is when heating occurs. At a certain frequency, a power loss maximum is reached to where higher frequencies will have decreased power loss and produce less heating. The maximum dielectric power loss is material dependent.Naylon, J., et al. \\"Efficient microwave heating and dielectric characterization of microfluidic systems.\\" Proceedings of MicroTAS. 2010.  Compatible materials  Single mer group of PVC, showing asymmetric distribution of atoms of different electronegativities. Single mer group of polyethylene, showing symmetric distribution of atoms. The Radio Frequency heating mechanism relies on a dipole in the molecule in order to generate heat and therefore the plastics used in RF Welding are limited to those whose molecules contain an electrical dipole.Leighton, J., Brantley, T., & Szabo, E. (September 01, 1993). RF welding of PVC and other thermoplastic compounds. Journal of Vinyl Technology, 15, 3, 188-192. Permanent molecular dipoles can form due to differences in electronegativities between the atoms of a molecule. Negative charge is shifted toward atoms with higher electronegativity, resulting in more negatively charged regions surrounding more electronegative atoms, and positively charged regions surrounding less electronegative atoms. Because polyethylene consists of symmetric mer groups, no dipole forms, and polyethylene cannot be joined using radio-frequency welding. Like water, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) consists of asymmetrically distributed atoms of differing electronegativities, with a resulting dipole moment. Because of its strong dipolar moment (and other properties) PVC is considered an excellent material for radio-frequency welding. In addition to polarity, properties that contribute to good radio-frequency weldability are high dielectric constant, which reduces resistance to current flow; high dielectric strength, which prevents arcing through the joint members during welding; and high dielectric loss, which is a factor that describes the amount of heat generated by an electric field. Some plastics commonly welded with dielectric heating include: * Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) * Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) * Polyurethane * Nylons * Cellulose acetate * Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) * Polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) *Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) Additional members can be added to a joint for a variety of reasons improving thermal insulation, preventing sticking of parts to the welding equipment, preventing arcing, and buffering non-uniform clamping pressure or electric field. It is possible to weld non-polar plastics by using a conductive-composite implant to improve dielectric loss.  Procedure and process  The RF Welding procedure consists of five steps: # Loading parts # Applying pressure # Applying electric field # Holding pressure # Unloading parts Loading consists of placing the joint member into the welding machine. The welding operation begins with application of pressure on the members from the electrodes. Generally, the bottom electrode is fixed, and the actuator drives the upper electrode down with a prescribed force. The electric field is applied to the parts for a specified time while pressure from the electrodes is maintained. Dielectric heating causes the parts that are in intimate contact to melt, and the liquid polymers diffuse into each other at the interface. Diffusion and solidification of the joint occur while pressure is maintained for a specified time. Once the joint is cooled and the upper electrode is retracted, the part can be unloaded. The parameters used to control the welding process consist of: * Weld time - duration electric field is applied * Power - electric field power into the joint * Clamp pressure (or collapse distance) - limit of squeeze pressure (or limit of squeeze distance) parts are pressed together * Hold time - duration pressure is applied after power source is turned off * Die temperature - temperature of dies * Number/sequence of cycles - modification of welding process to perform multiple cycles in sequences to maximize weld quality The parameters listed are often interdependent, and a process window must be developed to tune the process for acceptable weld quality.  Welding Equipment  Radio-frequency welding equipment, generally consists of: RF power generator, control unit, press, enclosure, electrodes, and sometimes a handling mechanism. The RF power generator converts line power to high-frequency, high-voltage power for welding. Typical voltages are 1kVAC - 1.5kVAC at a frequency of 27.12 MHz. The power needed for welding is based on the area of the weld, thickness, and the material. The control unit is the system used for operating the machine. The control unit is responsible for processing the information on the desired welding inputs such as force, power, and heating time, and instructing the other components of the machine to satisfy these process parameters. Some controllers are capable of monitoring outputs and adjusting parameters to ensure satisfactory welding. The press (or actuator) supplies the clamping force pneumatically or hydraulically. The electrodes are a pair of conductive structures that transmit the electric field through the members being joined. The electrodes contact the parts and apply the hold pressure prior to and during welding, and through solidification. Generally, the upper electrode projects from the upper fixture surface, while the lower electrode is a flat conductive surface. In some cases, the bottom electrode can project above the bottom fixture, to conform to geometry or to better localize melting through the reduction of stray electric field. Both electrodes can be fabricated with features to alter the finish of the welded surface. They are usually made of either brass, copper, or bronze. An RF enclosure or a cage that goes around the electrodes and open areas is used to protect the operator from injury including radio frequency radiation. Automated machines can be semi-automatic (requiring the operator to manipulate the parts) or fully automatic (where the machine is responsible for loading, transporting, and manipulating parts).  Applications  The most common application for RF Welding is sealing thin sheets of polar thermoplastics such as PVC. Some products that typically use RF Welding include beach balls, airbeds, life jackets, book covers, and loose- leaf binders. RF Welding is also commonly used for medical items such as blood bags, disposable clothing, blood pressure cuffs, and packaging for certain items. RF welding is most typically used in the construction of products that require a watertight or airtight seal. A welded seam or insertion tube sealing process creates seals that can withstand various types of requirements for certain liquid types or air pressures. An example of this would be for the medical industry, where ensuring the seal is airtight and fluid-tight is crucial. An IV drip bag, showing a RF weld around the perimeter.

In 2018, he won the Icelandic Basketball Cup with Tindast√≥ll and in 2014, he won the Peruvian championship with Real Club de Lima. College Hester was named NAIA Third- Team All-American in 2012 after averaging 15.5 points and 8.6 rebounds for the University of Mobile. Career In 2012, Hester joined Turun NMKY of the Finnish First Division. In 2014, Hester played for Real Club of Lima in the Liga de Basket de Lima, helping them win the Peruvian championship in July that year. He played for CB Tarragona during the 2014‚Äì15 LEB Plata season, averaging 13.4 points and 7.6 rebounds. In September 2014, he helped the club to victory in the LEB Catalan basketball league and was named the finals MVP. In August 2016, Hester signed with Tindast√≥ll of the Icelandic √örvalsdeild karla. A month later, Tindast√≥ll released Hester to sign Mamadou Samb. In November, Tindast√≥ll brought Hester back as a part of a major roster overhaul where they fired head coach Jos√© Maria Costa and released Samb and Pape Seck. For the season he averaged 23.5 points and 10.7 rebounds in 32.0 minutes per game. Tindast√≥ll finished third in the league but despite home court advantage, it lost to Keflav√≠k in the first round of the playoffs. In June 2017, Hester resigned with Tindast√≥ll for the 2017‚Äì2018 season. In November 2017, Hester injured his ankle badly and was initially thought to have broken it. Further tests revealed that the ankle was unbroken and that recovery time would be in weeks, not months. On January 13, 2018, Hester helped Tindast√≥ll to its first major title when it won the Icelandic Basketball Cup. For the season, Hester averaged 20.6 points and 8.7 rebounds in 25.3 minutes per game, helping Tindast√≥ll to a 16-6 record and the third seed in the playoffs. In the playoffs, Tindast√≥ll swept Grindav√≠k, 3-0, in the first round, advancing to the semi-finals against √çR. In the fifth game of the semi-finals on April 13, 2018, Hester injured his ankle. Despite the injury, Tindast√≥ll prevailed in the game and advanced to the √örvalsdeild finals. Although hobbled, Hester played in the first game of the finals series against four-time defending champions of KR. There he injured his other ankle after trying to block a shot from Brynjar √û√≥r Bj√∂rnsson, resulting in him missing game two of the series. Without him, Tindast√≥ll staged a spirited performance, blowing out KR on their own homecourt, 98-70, and tying the series at one game apiece. After the season he was named the √örvalsdeild Karla Foreign Player of the Year. In December 2018, Hester signed with Starwings Basel of the Swiss Basketball League. In 14 games, he averaged 19.9 points and 9.6 rebounds per game. Hester spent the 2019‚Äì220 season with B√†squet Girona in LEB Plata where he averaged 13.1 points and 8.3 rebounds in 25 games.

Retrieved April 23, 2018. = Research on labour economics= Most of Kramarz' research deals with various aspects of labour economics. Comparing the United States, Canada and France, Kramarz, David Card and Thomas Lemieux observe that the relative wages of less-skilled workers fell less during the 1980s in those countries with the most rigid labour market institutions, though these wage inflexibilities aren't found to explain the differences between the countries' relative employment growth. Moreover, in research with Horst Entorf and Michel Gollac, Kramarz finds that workers using ICT are 15-20% better paid than non- users, though this differential predates the introduction of ICT and likely reflects that ICT users higher inherent ability; as ICT users become more experienced, annual returns to ICT amount to 1-2% of users' wages and the likelihood of cyclical layoffs decreases for them.Entorf, H., Kramarz, F. (1997). Does unmeasured ability explain the higher wages of new technology workers? European Economic Review, 41(8), pp. 1489-1509. Entorf, H., Gollac, M., Kramarz, F. (1999). New technologies, wages, and worker selection. Journal of Labor Economics, 17(3), pp. 464-491. A particularly fruitful area of Kramarz' research has been the use of linked employer-employee data sets, which match information from households and individuals with information about the businesses or establishments they work in and which he describes at length together with John Abowd in the Handbook of Labor Economics.Abowd, J.M., Kramarz, F. (1999). The analysis of labor markets using matched employer- employee data. In: Ashenfelter, O.C., Card, D. (eds.). Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 3B. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 2629-2710. Abowd, J.M., Creecy, R.H., Kramarz, F. (2002). Computing person and firm effects using linked longitudinal employer-employee data. Suitland: U.S. Census Bureau. In research with Abowd and David Margolis, he finds that person effects account for 90% of inter-industry and 75% of firm size wage differentials in France and that firms which hire high-wage workers are more productive but not more profitable, though they become profitable once person effects are taken into account.Abowd, J.M., Kramarz, F., Margolis, D.N. (1999). High wage workers and high wage firms. Econometrica, 67(2), pp. 251-333. Moreover, with Abowd and Patrick Corbel, Kramarz finds that for each job created in the French private sector in a given year, three persons are hired and two job separations occur, whereas for each job destroyed, two separations occur yet only one hiring, with effects in both cases persisting even when controlling for skill group and the bulk of these worker flows are associated with short-term contracts; thus, employment adjustments in the private sector are made primarily by changing their hiring and not through changes in separations.Abowd, J.M., Corbel, P., Kramarz, F. (1999). The entry and exit of workers and the growth of employment: an analysis of French establishments. Review of Economics and Statistics, 81(2), pp. 170-187. Abowd and Kramarz also find that separation costs in France are degressively increasing in the number of exits, though with a large fixed component, whereas hiring costs are much lower and essentially zero for short-term contracts, driving French firms to adjust employment primarily through increases and decreases in hiring.Abowd, J.M., Kramarz, F. (2003). The costs of hiring and separations. Labour Economics, 10(5), pp. 499-530. Kramarz has also studied the labour market effects of various French policies, such as zoning boards or working time reductions, as well as the relationship between youth unemployment and crime as well as between social ties and youths' school-to-work transitions. For instance, analysing the impact of entry regulation on job creation in France with Marianne Bertrand, Kramarz finds that regional zoning boards' tendency to deter the creation or extension of retail stores increased retailer concentration and slowed down employment growth.Bertrand, M., Kramarz, F. (2002). Does entry regulation hinder job creation? Evidence from the French retail industry. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117(4), pp. 1369-1413. With Bruno Cr√©pon, Kramarz finds that the mandatory reduction of the workweek from 40 to 39 hours in France in 1982 decreased employment by 2-4%.Cr√©pon, B., Kramarz, F. (2002). Employed 40 hours or not employed 39: Lessons from the 1982 mandatory reduction of the workweek. Journal of Political Economy, 110(6), pp. 1355-1389. In research with Denis Foug√®re and Julien Pouget, Kramarz finds that crime and unemployment - especially youth unemployment - are positively correlated in France, suggesting that policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment may also contribute to decreases in burglaries, thefts, and drug offenses.Foug√®re, D., Kramarz, F., Pouget, J. (2009). Youth unemployment and crime in France. Journal of the European Economic Association, 7(5), pp. 909-938. Finally, in an extensive study of the role of social networks with regard to youth labour market entries in Sweden with Oskar Nordstr√∂m Skans, he finds that strong social ties (e.g. parents) are an important determinants for where young workers find their first job, especially for \\"weak\\" graduates in times of high unemployment or for graduates whose parents have good jobs or work in particularly productive establishments; overall, strong social ties benefit youth in terms of faster and better school-to-work transitions, including longer job match durations for their first jobs and better wage growth; by contrast, firms benefit due to such youths relatively lower entry wages and a strong drop in their parents' wage growth.Kramarz, F., Nordstr√∂m Skans, O. (2014). When strong ties are strong: Networks and youth labour market entry. Review of Economic Studies, 81(3), pp. 1164-1200.  Research on minimum wages As part of his research in labour economics, Kramarz has investigated the economics of minimum wages. For example, together with several co-authors, he found that minimum wages in Europe between the mid-1960s and mid-1990s have only caused higher unemployment if they kept the wages of low-wage jobs from decreasing, are relatively small for young people (relative to average earnings) when compared to the U.S., and don't appear to have reduced employment, except possibly for young workers.Dolado, J. et al. (1996). The economic impact of minimum wages in Europe. Economic Policy, 11(23), pp. 317-372. In further research comparing minimum wages in France and in the U.S. (with Abowd, Lemieux and Margolis), Kramarz finds that minimum wages do decrease the employment of youth, who are the by far most affected group, though in France the effect is somewhat mitigated through employment promotion programmes targeted at unemployed youth.Abowd, J.M. et al. (1997). Minimum wages and youth employment in France and the United States. In: Blanchflower, D.G., Freeman, R.B. (eds.). Youth Employment and Joblessness in Advanced Countries. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 427-472. Finally, in research with Thomas Philippon, Kramarz observes that French payroll tax subsidies appear to induce substitution between those earning the minimum wage or slightly more and receiving the subsidy and those who don't, even if the latter have slightly lower wages; essentially, a 1% increase in labour costs increases the likelihood of employees' loss of employment by 1.5%.Kramarz, F., Philippon, T. (2001). The impact of differential payroll tax subsidies on minimum wage employment. Journal of Public Economics, 82(1), pp. 115-146. = Research on international trade = Besides his research on labour economics, Kramarz has also extensively studied international trade. Using French customs data, Kramarz, Jonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum observe that most French firms only sell within France, only very few firms sell to many different foreign markets, the number of French firms selling to a foreign market, relative to French market share, increases systematically with market size, the distribution of sales are similar across markets of very different size and extent of French participation, and average sales in France rise systematically with selling to less popular markets and to more markets. Modeling these relationships, they find over half of the variation in firms' market entry decisions to be attributable to differences in firm-specific efficiency, suggesting that the gains of trade are likely to be concentrated among the most efficient firms and, while net positive, may displace less efficient firms.Eaton, J., Kortum, S., Kramarz, F. (2004). Dissecting trade: Firms, industries, and export destinations. American Economic Review, 94(2), pp. 150-154.Eaton, J., Kortum, S., Kramarz, F. (2011). An anatomy of international trade: Evidence from French firms. Econometrica, 79(5), pp. 1453-1498. In related research with Pierre Biscourp, Kramarz observes that, in France, import growth, especially of finished goods, strongly correlates with job destruction, especially of production jobs, with the strength of that relationship particularly large for larger firms.Biscourp, P., Kramarz, F. (2007). Employment, skill structure and international trade: Firm-level evidence for France. Journal of International Economics, 72(1), pp. 22-51. = Other research= Kramarz and David Thesmar find that the social networks of French CEOs and those of their directors are strongly correlated, especially for former high-ranking civil servants, and, in those firms wherein these networks are most active, CEO pay tends to be higher, the likelihood of dismissal for an underperforming CEO asis lower, and there are less value- creating acquisitions, suggesting that social networks in the boardroom may deteriorate corporate governance.Kramarz, F., Thesmar, D. (2014). Social networks in the boardroom. Journal of the European Economic Association, 12(3), pp. 780-807.

Animal acts were particularly popular as entertainment in the United States at the turn of the 18th and 19th Centuries and Don is highlighted as being a particular ‚Äúsensation‚Äù in his native Germany. Greg Daugherty of the Smithsonian Institution wrote that ‚Äúno animal act seemed to get as much notice as Don the Talking Dog‚Äù in a 2018 retrospective. Don is said to have started talking when Ebers asked him from the supper table ‚ÄûWillst du wohl was haben?‚Äú (‚ÄúYou want something don't you?‚Äù) and Don clearly responded \\"haben\\" (want). Vaudeville impresario Willie Hammerstein was keen to replicate the dog's success by bringing him to the United States. He publicised the venture by paying a $50,000 bond, equivalent to around $1.25 million today, in case the dog died while travelling to New York. Don and his owners travelled in July 1912 aboard the passenger liner SS Kronprinz Wilhelm with New York newspaper The Evening World reporting at the time that the dog ‚Äúwas too seasick on the way over to converse with anybody‚Äù. Don performed at Hammerstein's Paradise Roof Garden on 42nd Street in New York City with vaudeville veteran Loney Haskell fielding questions and acting as his interpreter. At one point Don was on the same bill as famed escapologist Harry Houdini. His salary, paid to Haberland, is rumoured to have been around $1,000 a week and the act toured around other Hammerstein stages. After a short return to Germany in the Autumn of 1912, Don went back to New York and performed alongside young comedian Sophie Tucker, a major star in the making. Don also became a celebrity endorser for Milk-Bone dog biscuits. On 27 August 1913 Don made further headlines when he allegedly helped to save a man from drowning at Brighton Beach. Don saw a flailing figure in the water and ran to assist. Sources differ as to whether or not Don barked the word ‚Äúhelp‚Äù before wading into the water. The man threw his arms around Don's neck and the pair nearly drowned before a policeman on horseback came to help. He himself was knocked off of his horse but the arrival of three lifeguards in a boat rescued the situation. Soon after Don returned to Germany to enjoy his retirement and he died in 1915.

Initially founded in October 2002 by Roger Hartley and Claire Horan, registered at Companies House. In 2016 they further expanded to become a CIC Trust Organisation. The Bureau of Silly Ideas is funded by Arts Council England and headquartered in Brixton, London. The majority of their work is in collaboration with local government councils across the United Kingdom, in addition to commissions from a variety of heritage sites and festivals across the world. They are also members of National Association of Street Artists and the Independent Street Arts Network. They were the first company to combine circus performance under the veil of construction work - transforming everyday objects into unassuming props or using radio controlled robotics.  History  = Early Conception = The Bureau of Silly Ideas was founded in October 2002 by Roger Hartley, an artist who was predominantly interested in performance in public spaces. He was interested by the fictitious transformation of everyday objects and what he saw, as their ability to unequivocally connect with individuals. This was inspired by a show in 1997 that Roger began to work on with Simon Collins to create a show based on Don Quixote with life size fire breathing robot horses and radio controlled wheelie bins. Roger had early experience in transforming spaces as he invented and launched ‚ÄòLost Vagueness‚Äô a pop up working casino and Cabaret with strict dress code that would appear in places not used to dress code. Roger and BOSI continue to infiltrate festivals but with interactive art. Roger was approached by Arts Council England to present ideas for street circus, theater and carnival; which has recently been accepted as forms of Art by the council. His proposition was performances that juxtaposed circus and funfair against construction sites and roadworks, which involved transforming these everyday objects and activities. His purpose was to engage people with their communities development in a fun and memorable way, in order to change their perception of something they may have otherwise found frustrating. Roger received funding from Arts Council England and created the Bureau of Silly Ideas and the company's first show ‚ÄòThe Hole Job‚Äô. = Development Years = In 2008 The Bureau of Silly Ideas produced a show called ‚ÄòBig Oriental Squid Inc‚Äô (BOSI) which was also an officially registered subsidiary company. The styling of performance names using the same acronym ‚ÄòBOSI‚Äô has become a hallmark of their work. This show demonstrated an important artistic shift from concentrating on everyday objects to everyday companies. Pushing and exploring legal boundaries and exploring the public's reaction to fictitious but official companies. They were the first to use a cross-media approach for the narrative of a public art event, 2008 ‚Äì Burst Pipe Dream in Brighton. Utilizing social media, fake news and company Big Oriental Squid Inc to provoke public backlash before unveiling the entire show as fictitious and for fun and then engaged them in the final performance. Subtly hitting multiple politically fused subjects. = At Present = In 2016 Roger Hartley and BOSI worked as first resident artist for Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Which culminated in the creation of the United Nations Board of Significant Inspiration (UNBOSI) and the ‚ÄòGarden of Curious Amusement‚Äô in Stratford-upon-Avon. > \\"BOSI were an inspirational partner to work with, engaging in a really > constructive dialogue with the SBT on exciting and unique project ideas, and > then delivering a successful activity that met with excellent customer > feedback from audience members who were both surprised and delighted with > their experience.‚Äù Dr Delia Garratt (Director of Cultural Engagement SBT) The UNBOSI project is continuing and has recently partnered with CPP Marketplace to conduct shows across the East Anglia area of the UK.  Philosophy  The Bureau of Silly Ideas was founded in 2002 by Roger Hartley, who wanted to address the issue of fracturing communities within an increasingly connected and globalized world. The fundamental belief of the company is that the creation of, and access to, art is a pathway out of urban poverty traps. The method of exacting this belief was through Conceptual and Process Art performances; that transposed the 'everyday' into surprising and immersive experiences \\"taking a magnifier to Duchamp urinal and extrapolating its essence, to a much greater scale\\" - Roger Hartley. The aim was to combat the loss of community involvement by creating shows that stripped back community development, such as construction and attempt to change the perception of them from interference to interactive; therefore bonding a community more closely with its refurbishment.  Shows  = The Burst Pipe Dream = The Burst Pipe Dream was a 7-day installation that took place in 2008 at Brighton's Jubilee Square, under the guise of a subsidiary company called 'Big Oriental Squid Inc'. The purpose of the event is described by BOSI as > The story that Brighton would be welcoming Europe‚Äôs first Giant Squid Farm > in newly developed, Jubilee Square. Created with two core aims in mind, the > primary being community cohesion - the building of Jubilee Square had > overrun and as such caused a discourse in the relationship between > construction, public space and community. The second was to respond to the > overfishing of our oceans by highlighting the role of corporations, who put > profit before the planet. Since its conception in 2008, BOSinc has visited > various towns. The Burst Pipe Dream is currently being redeveloped for a > national seaside town tour in 2020. The Bureau of Silly Ideas collaborated with Brighton Festival for the event. The event attracted attention from the general public and local news. = UNBOSI = United Nations Board of Significant Inspiration is a fictitious department of the United Nations, created by the Bureau of Silly Ideas and is collaborating with Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.

It is widely considered to be the second humorous novel in Gujarati literature, after Bhadrambhadra (1900) by Ramanbhai Neelkanth. The novel presents the story of protagonist Vipin from his birth to marriage. Origin Gujarati writer K. M. Munshi suggested that the authors, Dhansukhlal Mehta and Jyotindra Dave, write a humorous novel for his publication Gujarati. They agreed, and used to frequent Munshi's office and sometimes a restaurant to discuss the novel. Initially, the five chapters of the novel were serialized in Gujarati. When Gujarati was cancelled for unknown reasons, the novel was re-serialized in another magazine, Kaumudi. It was later published as a book in 1935. The intent of both writers was to depict a picture of contemporary social life in Surat. Content Twenty- seven chapters long, the novel is narrated in first person. It does not contain a continuous story, but presents events centered in Surat, the native home of both authors. It offers a humorous account of social life in Surat. The plot follows the life of the protagonist, Vipin, from his birth until after his marriage. The authors expressed humor through the everyday lives of Surati people. The content depicts typical first-hand knowledge of a 'Surat- born and bred' child, with the brush of a caricaturist. The Surati love for kite-flying, the barber's daily visits, the tailor's adventures in cutting and sewing, the washerman's duties, a hundred other rounds of visits of artisans and others are included in the novel. Some of the chapters from novel include the mode of teaching by the orthodox schoolmaster, the confusion at the time of a Surati wedding, the search for the proper bride, etc. Reception The Encyclopedia of Indian Literature mentions that the novel remains an unparalleled classic in the field of Gujarati humorous literature. Adaptation A telefilm directed by Hridaynath Gharekhan, based on Ame Badha, was broadcast on DD Girnar as an episode on the TV series Indian Classics. Dhansukhlal Mehta adapted the novel into a one-act play, Sari Jatu Surat (1942).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The farm was demolished in 2008 and the property redeveloped into Fuerst Park. History The Fuerst Farm land was first developed in 1827 by Gamaliel Simmons, who purchased this quarter section of land. The farm passed through several owners in the next few years; historical records suggest that a Greek Revival frame house was constructed on the property at some point before 1830. In 1836, the farm was purchased by George Dennis, who made improvements and constructed outbuildings on the farm. Dennis and his family owned the property until 1898, when it was purchased by James and Minnie Dunham. It is likely that the Dunhams leased the property before purchase, possibly as early as 1889. In 1918 the farm was purchased by the Jacob and Rebecca Fuerst family, who at the time owned a farm in Greenfield Township. By 1918, the city of Detroit was encroaching on Greenfield Township, and the original Fuerst farm was platted as a subdivision. farm already had some orchards planted, but the Fuersts developed them further, turning the farm into a thriving business selling fruit, eggs, and butter. In 1931 the Fuersts demolished the old Greek Revival house on the property and built a new bungalow. Rebecca and Jacob Fuerst lived on the farm until their deaths, Jacob in 1941 and Rebecca in 1954. Afterward, their daughters Ruby and Iva remained on the farm. The Fuerst sisters sold their 160 acres of land to the city of Novi in the 1970s for a token amount, retaining a life lease on this five-acre farmstead parcel. The Fuerst sisters both died in 1991. The farm was demolished in 2008 and the property redeveloped into Fuerst Park. Description The site of the Fuerst Farmstead is on a 6-1/2 acre site featuring a small hill atop which the farmhouse once stood. The site contains the remains of a fruit orchard, primarily pears and apples. Other shrubs and trees, including lilac, honeysuckle, buckthorn, barberry, sugar maple, and black walnut trees dot the site. The farmstead once consisted of a 1927 house, four barns, and a few smaller outbuildings. Most significant were the house and the 1876 Old Barn. The house was a 2500 square foot Arts and Crafts structure, sided with wood on a fieldstone foundation. A stone porch ran the length of the house, and a massive stone chimney dominated one side of the house. The Old Barn was a wood-framed structure with a front gable roof on a fieldstone basement. The barn was built into the side of the hill, so that the basement level could be accessed from below. The site has been redeveloped into a park, and contains an amphitheater, large gardens, and the historic Novi Township Hall, which was relocated onto the site.

Brown attended Christchurch School in Barnet, then Luton Technical School, followed by Ruskin College, from which he received a Diploma in Economic and Physical Science, validated by the University of Oxford. In 1919, he became the secretary of the Shipping Clerks' Guild, a trade union. Brown also became active in the Labour Party, and stood as its candidate in the 1919 St Albans by-election. Campaigning among railway workers, and also non-manual workers who he believed had been hit by profiteering during the war, he won 42.4% of the vote, a surprisingly close second place. He stood again in the 1922 United Kingdom general election, dropping back only slightly, to 42.2% of the votes cast. Brown's trade union career progressed rapidly, as he was elected as vice-chairman of the National Federation of Professional Workers, then in 1923 as assistant secretary of the International Federation of Trade Unions. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) were unhappy that he was junior to non-British officers, and in August succeeded to having him promoted to become joint general secretary. In 1927, Brown uncovered evidence which, he claimed, showed that European trade unions were intriguing against the British unions, which wished to bring Russian trade unions into the organisation. The TUC argued that Brown should be elected as sole general secretary, but this was not accepted. In the face of an impasse, both Brown and another general secretary, Jan Oudegeest, chose to resign.

Meiselman and first published in 1963, as part of studies submitted to the Commission on Money and Credit. In 2000, a survey of 298 members of the American Economic Association (AEA) found that while 84 percent generally agreed with the statement \\"Fiscal policy has a significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy\\", 71 percent also generally agreed with the statement \\"Management of the business cycle should be left to the Federal Reserve; activist fiscal policy should be avoided.\\" In 2011, a follow-up survey of 568 AEA members found that the previous consensus about the latter proposition had dissolved and was by then roughly evenly disputed. Origin In the early 1960s, contributing to the studies invited by the Commission on Money and Credit, Milton Friedman and David Meiselman published a study whereby, they found that \\"[e]xcept for the early years of the Great Depression, money is more closely related to consumption than is autonomous expenditures,\\"The term \\"autonomous expenditures\\" denotes the components of an economy's aggregate expenditure that are not affected by that same economy's real level of income. E.g. government spending, basic living expenses, and private investing. See Friedman/Meiselman (1963) claiming moreover that \\"[t]he results [of the tests] are strikingly one-sided\\". They used the following reduced form, least squares regression equation to compare the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies; in effect, to compare Keynesian and monetarist theories: ::C_t = \\\\alpha + VM_t + KA_t (1) where C is induced private consumption, Œ± is a constant, V represents money velocity, M is approximately M2, K represents an expenditure-multiplier, A is autonomous expenditures, and t represents time. Friedman and Meiselman found that, whether using annual data from 1897 to 1958 or quarterly data from 1946 to 1958, and whether using only real, contemporaneous data, or experimenting with various time lags, private consumption was not statistically significantly affected by discretionary fiscal policy, but was by monetary policy. They stated that their monetary variables were \\"highly correlated\\" with consumption, whereas fiscal policy variables were not. Debate The Friedman/Meiselman 1963 paper was addressed with numerous articles, where counter-arguments were made: The model was erroneously specified because important and statistically relevant variables were omitted; the data used were not actually coincident with the theory behind them; there was no correction for the \\"thermostat effect\\"The \\"thermostat effect\\" denotes the occasion when discretionary fiscal policy is used because spending and output are down, just as a thermostat senses the house temperature and raises the heat so that the temperature is maintained at the desired level. See Bias (2014) so that even if fiscal policy is effective it will seem to have a neutral or even negative relationship with spending rather than the positive effect it is theorized to have; and that the results were time-specific. =Hester claims bias= In 1964, Donald D. Hester criticizedHester (1964) the F/M paper for \\"bias\\" against a \\"Keynesian\\" outcome. For that purpose, Hester argued that government deficits are endogenously determined, and not exogenously, and thus no single-equation approach could properly capture government spending and deficits, while the same principle applies for short- run private investment. Also, Hester emphasized that the actual data should have been empirically tested in first-differential form so as to extricate the trends of both explanatory variables, and thus demonstrate only the endogenously generated economic growth. Hester stated that, when he tried \\"improved\\" data and empirical methods, ‚Äúthe autonomous expenditure theory outperformed the quantity theory [of money],‚Äù i.e. Keynesian economics win over monetarist economics. =Friedman/Meiselman respond= In a paper published in 1964,Friedman/Meiselman (1964) Friedman and Meiselman conceded that Hester‚Äôs suggestion of using first differences was correct and that it is a better method for their single-equation approach. But they insisted that their interpretations of income and autonomous expenditures are relevant, rejecting Hester‚Äôs misgivings. They claimed that Hester‚Äôs use of correlation coefficients with his newly defined autonomous expenditures constituted an \\"unsound argument,\\"and summarized as follows: > We remain of the opinion that there is a striking division among students of > economic affairs about the role of money in determining the course of > economic events. One view is that the quantity of money matters little; the > other, that it is a key factor in understanding, and even more, controlling > economic change. Our paper tried to present some evidence relevant to > deciding between these views. The kind of evidence we gave is not the only > kind that is relevant and may not be the most important or significant. And, > of course, much other evidence is available from other work by us and by > many others. This other evidence needs to be added to and brought to bear on > the main issue that divides economists into two groups. Hester does not > quarrel with the relevance of our evidence but with the particular form of > the income-expenditure theory we use. [Hester's] criticism of our procedure > rests primarily on a misunderstanding of the theoretical basis of our > approach. He offers neither theoretical argument nor empirical evidence in > support of his alternative formulation. Hence his criticism is largely > beside the point. That is unfortunate. We badly need work on these problems > that will clarify the issues involved. We can ill afford to waste the > energy, interest, and ability that Hester displays in his paper on frivolous > quibbling. =Ando and Modigliani: both policies affect outcome = Albert Ando and Franco Modigliani, in a paper published in 1965,Ando/Modigliani (1965) disputed the findings presented in the 1963 Friedman/Meiselman work. Ando and Modigliani claimed that > [The Friedman/Meiselman 1963 work] has shortcomings in procedures that if > repaired change the result, but, moreover, the single-equation approach > coupled with the equally single, independent variable approach and the > corresponding correlations cannot shed light on macro-policy. They argued that the consumption functionFriedman, in 1957, had written on the subject of the consumption function a book (Friedman (1957)) that he later stated he considered his \\"most important professional contribution\\". See Taylor (2001) was not correctly specified within the F/M use of autonomous expenditures and claimed that the variable that Friedman and Meiselman had derived was actually saving and not autonomous expenditures. They also observed that the data used in the 1963 paper would need to be modified by including corporate retained earnings, transfer payments made by the government to foreigners, and ‚Äúwage accruals over disbursement.‚Äù Ando and Modigliani objected to the use of an ordinary, least squares equation because of the induced influence on the independent variable by the dependent variableMeaning that the independent variable is not really independent and offered their own model, which ostensibly removed the independent part from the induced part. Ando and Modigliani criticized the Friedman/Meiselman paper for omitting to determine exogenous and endogenous components to monetary policy in the same manner as economists do with fiscal policy. Instead, Ando and Modigliani, rather than using a standard money-supply variable, introduced M*, which is meant to represent what the money stock would be if high powered money were \\"fully utilized\\", thus introducing a \\"high-usage variable.\\"This is somewhat akin to a high-employment fiscal variable. See Bias (2014) The purpose was to show that money is not exogenously determined: people can choose to hold money in different amounts and levels of liquidity as situations warrant, while lenders don't need to lend out all of their excess reserves if they so desire - which constitutes a standard Keynesian concept. Moreover, Ando and Modigliani found that the error variance in predicting output\\"NNP\\" in the paper, i.e. Net National Product was \\"much higher\\" when using money than any of the fiscal variables and labeled the F & M respective results \\"spurious.\\" They concluded that Friedman and Meiselman‚Äôs results were biased in favor of monetary policy, and that, if both policy variables were to be given a balanced approach, the end result would be that both policies would have real and statistically significant effects on the economy. Indeed, in the opening statement of their paper, they state that the \\"number of basic shortcomings in [the Friedman/Meiselman] procedure...make the results of their elaborate battery of tests essentially worthless.\\" Economists Michael DePrano and Thomas Mayer publishedDePrano/Mayer (1965) a critique of the F & M paper that was generally in line with the criticisms leveled by A & M. =FM respond to AM= In 1965, Friedman and Mieselman respondedFriedman/Meiselman (1965) to the criticism leveled at their 1963 paper, particularly by Ando and Modigliani. They claimed that although one could indeed object to their autonomous-expenditure variable, any of the alternatives that had been put forward by others were equally objectionable. Additionally, Friedman and Meiselman defended their use of their consumption function and explained why it is, in their view, the right method to use. And they pointed out that, unlike them, Ando and Modigliani used nominal data rather than real data and, therefore, the empirical results put forward by A & M could not be correctly comparable to their own. Friedman and Mieselman agreed in theory with A & M that the term M* is a valid means to determine the exogenous versus the endogenous nature of the policy variable but still disagreed with the actual A & M methodology to determine M*. As to the consumption variance, they maintained that \\"of the total variance of consumption for the 25 years, 88 per cent is accounted for by the differences between the means for the two subperiods.\\" Finally, they claimed complete lack of bias in their research and the empirical processes and claimed that even if they had built a model that seemed to favor monetary policy over fiscal policy, that was because the theory comes out that way. They concluded as follows: > None of the calculations made by our critics for supposedly the same purpose > is correct because they omit some components of income for the income- > expenditure calculations, set the two theories different tasks, or use > lengthy periods combining two different sub-periods. We have made some of > the correct calculations for one of the alternative concepts of autonomous > expenditures (Ando and Modigliani‚Äôs). Though less clear-cut, the results are > in the same direction as those from our original calculations. Hence, we are > left with no reason to change our earlier conclusion that ‚Äúso far as these > data go [and, we may now add, those adduced by Ando and Modigliani, DePrano > and Mayer, and Hester]Text inside brackets in the original the widespread > belief that the investment multiplier is stabler than the monetary velocity > is an invalid generalization from the experience of three or four years. It > holds for neither later nor earlier years‚Äù. =The St. Louis equation= In 1968, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis economists Leonall C. Andersen and Jerry L. Jordan published a studyAndersen/Jordan (1968) that fully supported the Friedman and Meiselman single-equation approach but expanded it in response to the criticisms of the 1963 paper. They offered their own economic output model, in which where all variables are in first-differential form as denoted by ‚àÜ, as follows: \\\\Delta Y_t=\\\\alpha + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{4}m_i\\\\Delta M_ + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{4}e_i\\\\Delta E_ + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{4}z_i\\\\Delta Z_ (2) where Œ± is a constant; Y is nominal domestic spending; M represents monetary policy defined by the monetary base; E represents variously high-employment expenditures, high-employment receipts, or high-employment surplus; and Z represents a catch-all variable defined as ‚Äúa variable summarizing all other forces that influence total spending.‚Äù Those forces include weather, international trade, preferences, technology, resources, infrastructure, war, etc. In their math, they used an Almon lag technique with 4th-degree polynomials and a 4-period time lag.As denoted by the figure '4' atop the sum sign \\\\Sigma They concluded that, just as Friedman and Meiselman had found, monetary policy seemed to affect whatever measure was used for spending; but fiscal policy did not. =De Leeuw and Kalchbrenner: endogenous vs. exogenous= In 1969, Frank DeLeeuw,and J. Kalchbrenner, also St. Louis Fed economists, published an articleDeLeeuw/Kalchbrenner (1969) that criticized \\"severely\\" the Andersen/Jordan study and modeling. They argued that exogenous fiscal policy cannot be properly measured by using any of the fiscal policy definitions presented by their colleagues, nor can any single-equation approach bring into relief the particular influences of such a policy variable. There exist no ways, they claimed, to separate the endogenous- from the exogenous-policy effects because those effects are effectively lost in the complex workings of an entire economy. They pointed out, in particular, that the tax and monetary-base variables are impossibly entangled with the endogeneity-exogeneity problem and claimed that the Andersen/Jordan method leaves out the influences introduced by inflation. The main argument by De Leeuw and Kalchbrenne was that causality cannot be demonstrated by the single- equation approach, and the direction of causation is impossible to establish, i.e. GNP could be driving is fiscal spending rather than the other way around. After making a \\"clear improvement\\" on the Andersen/Jordan model (using high employment receipts adjusted for inflation as the fiscal variable and two different versions of the monetary base), and re-running the \\"St. Louis equation\\" on the basis of data from 1952 to 1968, they proclaimed that, according to their findings, fiscal expenditures were statistically significant, positively correlatedIt was commented that, of course, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. E.g. Gramlich (1971) to changes in GNP in the long run - as was also true for changes in monetary policy. =Other arguments= In 1971, William L. SilberSilber (1971) posited that the researchers were altering their equations to fit into whatever their ideological worldviews were theorizing, which was the reason he gave his paper a \\"highly political\\" title. He questioned the validity of the overall methodology behind the \\"St. Louis equation\\" approach, after running it in various time periods that were deemed to have the same underlying structural form, and finding that some periods appeared to show fiscal policy as quite significant while others did not. In 1971, Edward Gramlich reviewedGramlich (1971) the ‚Äúradio debate\\" up to that point and compared the multiplier and elasticity estimates for monetary and fiscal policies among the several different models and the non-single equation models. As he stated, all the models, except the Ando/Modigliani ones, showed monetary policy to have a multiplier above 1, and in every case to be larger than the fiscal multiplier. His study, which included a model \\"improving\\" the St Louis equation, supported the view that monetary policy is strongly correlated with spending but also found that fiscal policy is correlated as well. In 1972, Stephen M. Goldfeld, Alan S. Blinder, John Kareken and William Poole, in their study, criticized the Andersen/Jordan approach as econometrically unsound. They argued that, without a reaction function, one cannot determine the nature of the ‚Äúexogenous‚Äù from the \\"endogenous‚Äù, and that, if the rules or automatic stabilizers are done to counter-cyclical perfection, then the correlations do not show up with the statistical significance we would expect. Their paper concludes that the single-equation approach used to empirically determine the comparative efficiency of monetary and fiscal policies is \\"without merit.\\"Goldfeld/Blinder/Kareken/Poole (1972) In 1973, William Poole and Elinda B. F. Kornblith foundPoole/Kornblith (1973) that all the models tended to \\"underpredict,\\" and attempted to provide hypotheses for that result. Their conclusion was that the ‚Äúdecision [about which models were correct or supported monetary or fiscal policies] must still be rated a draw.‚Äù In 1975, J. W. Elliot conducted an empirical analysis and pointed out the difficulty of comparing the regression coefficients as ‚Äúmultipliers‚Äù since their corresponding variables are money, which is a stock, and fiscal spending, which is a flow. He concluded that, irrespective of technique, his results supported the Andersen/Jordan results. =Ando and Modigliani return= In 1974, at a conference held at Brown University, Ando and Modigliani presented a paper where they recreated an analysis of a simulated economy using the Andersen/Jordan method, which, they concluded, was biased in favor of monetary policy. Their work was published in 1976.Ando/Modigliani (1976) =Keith Carlson vs. Benjamin Friedman= In 1977, Benjamin Friedman found that, using the Andersen/Jordan model but extending the data set out to the 2nd quarter of 1976, fiscal policy was now statistically significant in the determination of expenditures -although serious heteroscedasticity problems had appeared. He also found that, if he used data starting at the 1st quarter of 1960, the results were even more favorable to discretionary fiscal policy, reiterating the existence in the Andersen/Jordan model of an inherent coefficient bias. Ultimately, he concluded that the St Louis equation methodology was \\"not salvageable.\\"Friedman, B. (1977) In response, Keith Carlson, in 1978, made an empirical modification to the original Andersen/Jordan model, whereby instead of using a first-difference approach, he posited that a rate-of-change approach eliminated the heteroscedasticity problems discovered by B. Friedman. Carlson‚Äôs model is as follows: \\\\dot{Y}_t=\\\\alpha + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{4}m_i \\\\dot{M}_ + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{4}e_i\\\\ \\\\dot{E}_ (3) where the variables are the same as in the Andersen/Jordan model but the dots over the terms denote growth rates for the respective variables. Carlson determined that his model once again supported the original conclusion of significant monetary-policy effects and insignificant fiscal-policy effects. Outcome Numerous papers have appeared in the literature, dating from the 1963 original work until the 2010s. In 2011, Stefan Belliveau attempted to sum up the debate down to three ‚Äúinterpretations‚Äù:Belliveau (2011) Real business-cycle theory says that neither fiscal nor monetary policy is very effective, essentially rejecting state activism; Keynesian theory suggests that government expenditures can influence economic output while monetary policy is not as effective; and monetarist theory says that monetary policy is effective while fiscal policy is not. To settle the matter, Belliveau attempted to salvage the Andersen/Jordan equation by including Gross Value Added by Sector as his output-dependent variable, considering it necessary to look at these data if policymakers are attempting to stabilize economic fluctuations. Using annual data from 1956 to 2007, Belliveau found empirical support, as claimed, that both monetary and fiscal policy seem to help stabilize an economy, and considers the use of both policies in the United States as being \\"reasonable\\" during and after the Great Recession. Milton Friedman, in a 2000s interview, maintained that \\"the debate was over\\" and that \\"everyone agrees fundamentally\\" with the notion of monetary-policy supremacy.Taylor (2001) He stated that he still had \\"far more extreme views about the unimportance of fiscal policy for the aggregate economy than the [economist] profession does.\\" In 2000, a survey of 298 members of the American Economic Association found that while 84 percent generally agreed with the statement \\"Fiscal policy has a significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy\\", 71 percent also generally agreed with the statement \\"Management of the business cycle should be left to the Federal Reserve; activist fiscal policy should be avoided.\\" In 2011, a follow-up survey of 568 AEA members found that the previous consensus about the latter proposition had dissolved and was by then roughly evenly disputed. Some heterodox economists (most notably Post-Keynesians) reject in their entirety old and new arguments in favor of monetary policy.E.g. Mitchell (2016) As observed by Peter BiasDept of Business and Economics at Florida Southern College in a 2014 retrospective of the debate, it all \\"points to the importance of clearly defining precise, objective functions or theories, and using the appropriate variables and methodologies to empirically test those theories.\\" See also *Monetarism *Keynesianism *Post-Keynesian economics Footnotes References Bibliography *Andersen, Leonall C. & Jerry L Jordan (1968) ‚ÄúMonetary and fiscal actions: a test of their relative importance in economic stabilization‚Äù, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, 1968, vol.50, pp. 11‚Äì24 *Ando, Albert & Franco Modigliani (1965) \\"The relative stability of monetary velocity and the investment multiplier\\", The American Economic Review, 55.4, pp. 693‚Äì728 *Ando, Albert & Franco Modigliani (1976) \\"Impacts of fiscal actions on aggregate income and the monetarist controversy: theory and evidence\\", Monetarism, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1976, pp. 17‚Äì42 *Batten, Dallas S. & Daniel L.

B. 2013: Mortality and survival of cultured surface-ocean flagellates under simulated deep-sea conditions. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 445: 13-20. DOI: 10.1016/j.jembe.2013.03.017 Their ability to alternate between both marine and freshwater environments in many parts of the world give them a ‚Äúcosmopolitan‚Äù character.Due to their relatively microscopic size ranging between 4-12 microns, they are further distinguished as heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF).This small size ratio limits them as bacterivores that swim around feeding on bacteria attached to surfaces or in aggregates. Etymology The prefix ‚ÄòNeo-‚Äô comes from the ancient Greek word for ‚Äò‚Äô which signifies 'young'. Attaching the prefix to the original bodonid species, neobodo literally means a ‚Äúnew‚Äù bodonid species. History of Knowledge The order Neobodonida was proposed by a researcher, Keith Vickerman, based on significant characteristics that differed from the original bodonid species.Differing characteristics included: being phagotrophic, Polykinetoplastic/eukinetoplastic, biflagellate with usually both flagella lacking hairs, having a posterior flagellum attached to the body or free of it, and having an apical cytostome. Many Neobodo species derived from Bodo species, and by recognizing these differences, they were tentatively assigned to the new genus Neobodo by adding the ‚Äòneo‚Äô prefix. Through studies on the ultrastructure of Bodo designis, researchers discovered the possession of a ‚Äòmicrotubular prism‚Äô supporting the cytostome‚Äìcytopharynx, as well as a significantly different feeding apparatus from other bodonids, thus proposing the new species as Neobodo designis. Through this discovery, they were proposed as the type species of the new genus Neobodo. Neobodo have very close connections with Kinetoplastid protists. Kinetoplastid protists belong together with euglenids and diplonemids, to the phylum Euglenozoa, and are grouped in the class Kinetoplastea. The name of kinetoplastid is derived from the presence of a characteristic structure called the kinetoplast which is a mass of concentrated extranuclear DNA within a mitochondrion. In the past, kinetoplastids were classified into two major suborder groups via morphology- based taxonomic criteria: either as parasitic uniflagellate trypanosomatids, or biflagellate bodonids. Originally, Vickerman proposed two families, Bodonidae and Cryptobiidae, but later on re-unified all bodonids within the single family, Bodonidae. Based on comparisons of RNA sequences and molecular phylogenetic analyses, it was suggested that the trypanosomatids also emerged from within the bodonids. Moreover, recent research of deep-sea hydrothermal vent samples at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and analysis via PCR amplification reported several new kinetoplastid-like sequences. Researchers David Moreira, Purificacion Lopez-Garcƒ±a, and Keith Vickerman analyzed the phylogeny of these kinetoplastids and found a much more stable phylogeny that supported the monophyly of groups that typically emerged as polyphyletic in the trees rooted using the traditional, distant outgroup sequences. As a result, the classification of the class Kinetoplastea was divided as two new subclasses: *Prokinetoplastina -containing various bodonid species, and *Metakinetoplastina -including the Trypanosomatida and three additional new orders: Eubodonida Parabodonida Neobodonida Through this process, Neobodo was created as a new genus, along with the revision of the classification of species formerly included in the genus Bodo and the amendment of the genus Parabodo. Description The new genus Neobodo is characterized as solitary phagotrophic flagellates with a single discrete eukinetoplast. They are known for having an apical cytostome and cytopharynx supported by a prismatic rod of microtubules. Neobodo cells are usually elongate and elliptical in shape and somewhat inflexible. They range from 4 to 12 microns long, but are mostly 6 to 9 microns. They have a nucleus near the middle of the cell and two unequal, heterodynamic flagella emerging from a shallow, subapical pocket. The anterior flagellum appears inactive and just wraps around the anterior part of the cell. It is about the same length or slightly shorter than the cell. It is held forward with a single anterior curve that is held perpendicular to the substrate and curves back over the rostrum. The acronematic posterior flagellum is trailed and sometimes forms an undulating membrane. It is typically directed straight behind the cell and is about 2 to 4 times the length of the cell. The proximal part of the posterior flagellum is accompanied with a paraxial rod and sometimes non- tubular mastigonemes. The cells use their posterior flagellum and rotate around their longitudinal axes to swim and glide along in rapid darts of straight lines. Along with their two flagella, they have two nearly parallel basal bodies. They also house discoid shaped mitochondrial cristae and a compact kinetoplast (a DNA-containing granule located within a single mitochondrion) that is associated with the flagellar bases. The kinetoplasts are naked, but the cytoskeletal microtubules beneath the cell membrane are developed. They have a cytoplasm usually filled with symbiotic bacteria and small glycosomes that possess glycolytic enzymes. Although sexual reproduction is unknown and cysts have not been found to date, they are able to reproduce asexually by means of binary fission. Habitat and Ecology Bodonid flagellates (class Kinetoplastea) are abundant, free-living bacterivores that occur in a wide variety of environments including freshwater, soil and marine habitats ranging from the tropics to the Arctic. Neobodo is one of the most common flagellates in freshwater environments, but can also tolerate marine environments with low salinities of 3-4 ppt. Strains of Neobodo species isolated from different environments fall exclusively into marine and freshwater lineages. Studies show that Neobodo is a complex and ancient species with a major marine clade nested among older freshwater clades.Von Der Heyden, S., and Cavalier-Smith, T. 2005: Culturing and Environmental DNA Sequencing Uncover Hidden Kinetoplastid Biodiversity and a Major Marine Clade within Ancestrally Freshwater Neobodo Designis. International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, 55: 2605‚Äì2621. DOI: 10.1099/ijs.0.63606-0 This suggests that these lineages were constrained physiologically from moving between these environments for most of their long history. Their broad physiological tolerance enables them to easily interchange between marine and freshwater environments, which gives them a cosmopolitan characteristic and a wide ecological tolerance. Recent evidence for Neobodo designis suggested notable divergence between freshwater and marine strains and all strains exhibited extensive genetic diversity. Epifluorescent microscopy studies reported the abundance of several HNF (heterotrophic nanoflagellate) groups (including bodonids) in the euphotic zone of different marine areas. Areas include the Mediterranean Sea, Norwegian Sea, the Indian Ocean and around the Antarctic Peninsula. Throughout the numerous oceans, large fractions of small heterotrophic flagellates with few morphological features remain unidentified. Therefore there is a high possibility that there are many bodonids among the unidentified that have not yet been studied. Although Neobodo are surface organisms, typically found in surface waters, studies have shown their ability to tolerate deep water conditions. Due to advection or attachment to sinking particles, microbes from the surface of the ocean are continuously transported to deeper areas. The vast majority of the marine environment consists of dark, cold, high-pressure environments, which increases with depth. When cultures of Neobodo were isolated from surface waters and were put in different deep-sea temperatures and pressures, the abundance of protists declined in all treatments, with a significantly greater rate of mortality under combined cold temperature and high pressure conditions than in the cold temperature-only conditions. However, an average of 6.1% of N. designis cells survived in the high pressure treatments, indicating that some fraction of sinking protists can survive transport to the deep ocean. In addition, after a period of acclimation, positive growth rates were measured in some cases. This suggests that surface-adapted flagellates can not only survive under deep-sea conditions but are able to reproduce and potentially provide seed populations in cold, high-pressure environments. Although Neobodo are not abundant in the deep oceans, they are capable of surviving in the deep waters, tolerating high pressure and low temperature conditions. Feeding Neobodo are free-living and active microbial predators that swim around and feed on prey in aquatic ecosystems. As free-living flagellates, they are the most important bacterivorous forms in aquatic environments. Neobodo, like other bodonids, are heterotrophic flagellates (HF) which are a very diverse and heterogeneous group of protists with a size range between 1 and 450 microns. They play an essential role in aquatic and terrestrial food webs as major consumers of bacterial biomass. The predator to prey size ratio limits the maximal size difference between bacteria and their predator: Neobodo. The marine environment presents additional constraints, imposed by the typical small size and low abundance of bacteria. In these conditions, physical and hydrodynamic considerations theoretically restrict Neobodo‚Äôs feeding to graze on small bacteria, typically within the nanoplankton. Most bacterivorous protists in the marine pelagic zone are generally in the size range of 2-5 microns and are classified as a functional group called heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF). The predominance of HNF as marine bacterivores has been confirmed by manipulations with size-fractionated natural assemblages and by direct observation of protists with ingested fluorescent bacteria. More specifically, Neobodo are interception feeders, meaning they feed on bacteria attached to surfaces/biofilms or in aggregates. They press their mouth against food and are often aided by a pseudopod-like structure (pharynx) to detach bacteria. Within this feeding mechanism, further variability in terms of feeding behavior and selection strategies can be observed among different species. Practical importance Despite the ecological and evolutionary significance of these organisms, many of their biological and pathological features are currently unknown. Through metatranscriptomics using RNA-seq technology combined with field-emission microscopy the virulence factors of a recently described genus of Neobodonida that is considered to be responsible for Ascidian Soft Tunic Syndrome (AsSTS) was revealed.Jang, H.B., Kim, Y. K., Del Castillo, C. S., Nho, S. W., Cha, I. S., and Park, S. B. 2012: RNA-Seq- Based Metatranscriptomic and Microscopic Investigation Reveals Novel Metalloproteases of Neobodo sp. as Potential Virulence Factors for Soft Tunic Syndrome in Halocynthia roretzi. PLoS ONE, 7(12): e52379. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0052379 AsSTS is a disease of the edible ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, which has done enormous damage to the Korean and Japanese aquaculture. AsSTS is characterized by changes in the tunic (the outermost barrier against the environment), including elasticity loss and subsequent rupture leading to thinner bundled tunic fibers and coarser tunic matrices. However, the pathogenesis is unclear and is still an area of research. List of species (or of lower taxonomic units) Despite the considerable interest in free-living bodonids, their true biodiversity has most likely been grossly underestimated by simple light microscopy, as it does not differentiate most ‚Äòspecies‚Äô very well. rRNA gene primers were used to test Neobodo‚Äôs global distribution and genetic diversity. The non-overlap between environmental DNA sequences and those from cultures suggests that there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of different rRNA gene sequences of free-living Neobodo species globally. Some of the species identified to date are: -Neobodo designis -Neobodo cf. designis -Neobodo curvifilus -Neobodo saliens -Neobodo sp.

It is the largest correctional facility in the territory. Baffin Correctional Centre The facility was designed by Bruno Freschi in the 1980s and opened as the Baffin Correctional Centre with an initial capacity of 41 inmates. After upgrades in 1996, the capacity was increased to 66 beds with two segregation cells. Additional renovations totally $900,000 in the mid 2010s helped to remove pervasive mould, fix fire sprinklers, damaged walls, and decrepit bathrooms. =Prisoner care= Despite the increased capacity created in the 1990s, the number of inmates became routinely higher than capacity in the 2000s. Often with 75 prisoners, and with a peak during the winter of 115 inmates, with some sleeping in a repurposed gymnasium. These would include minimum-, medium- and maximum-security prisoners, as well as those unconvicted but awaiting trial. Between 2002 and 2012, reports of violence within the prison increased dramatically, with 2012 incidents in 2012. A report by federal auditor general Michael Ferguson noted that none of the 24 prisoners interviewed had considered a plan for rehabilitation, and just five per cent of inmates had release plan. Only a third of inmates with mental-health issues had relevant services. In 2014, Howard Sapers, a representative from the Office of the Correctional Investigator described the jail as \\"appalling\\" and called for its closure. Renovations in the 2010s improved conditions, and the construction of the Makigiarvik Correction Centre in 2015 next door decreased overcrowding. However, overcrowding remained a problem in Nunavut, and the government admitted to paying $4 million per year for inmates to be housed outside the territory. In 2017, prisoners angry with the poor conditions and lack of programming started a short-lived riot, damaging large sections of the living quarters. Approximately 85 per cent of the medium security bed space and 33 per cent of the maximum security bed space was destroyed, but no one was injured beyond the use of pepper spray. In June 2018, another riot broke out, causing \\"significant damage\\" to the \\"Charlie\\" unit of the prison, which houses between 20 and 30 inmates. The riot briefly involved a fire, which the inmates extinguished themselves. Rebuilding In 2016, the government announced plans to rebuild the Baffin Correctional Centre at a total cost of $76 million, and rename it the Qikiqtani Correctional Healing Centre. The plans are to create a new two- storey maximum-security unit, while renovating the existing structures into two medium-security facilities. The construction was set to begin in the summer of 2018, but the in May 2018, it was announced that the opening would be significantly delayed. The government announced that the request for proposals process was cancelled after only one company bid on the contract, and its bid was $7 million over the remaining budget for the project. Construction began in 2019 with an estimated completion date of 2022.

The vast influx of refugees is due to several factors in Uganda's neighboring countries, especially war and violence in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ), and associated economic crisis and political instability in the region. Uganda has relatively 'friendly' policies that provide rights to the refugees, such as rights to education, work, private property, healthcare and other basic social services.  Demographics  Most of the refugees in Uganda come from neighboring countries, especially South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. = Refugee Camps = Refugee Camps in South - Western Uganda Uganda currently has 11 settlement camps: # Achol-Pii Settlement # Bidi Bidi Settlement # Impevi Settlement # Kampala Settlement # Kiryandongo Settlement # Kyaka II Settlement # Kyangwali Settlement # Nakivale Settlement # Pagirinya Settlement # Rhino Settlement # Rwamwanaja Settlement Almost 50% of refugees in Uganda are located in the Bidi Bidi, Pagirinya, and Rhino refugee settlement camps, located in the northwest region of the country. Additionally, South Sudan accounts for 62% of refugees in Uganda, while the Democratic Republic of the Congo accounts for 29%.  Refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo  As of the end of 2019, there are over 900,000 Congolese refugees being hosted in various African countries, with over 40% currently in Uganda. The region of the DR Congo bordering Uganda is the place of origin for the vast majority of Congolese refugees. The massive influx of refugees is largely caused by the persistent violence and fighting that has dominated the DR Congo. Many refugees enter Uganda through Lake Albert in the Ituri province of the DR Congo, which borders the northwest region of Uganda. Of the 900,000 refugees, almost 3% are children traveling alone; almost 2% are women at risk; and 0.2% are fleeing sexual- or gender- based violence. The presence of refugees in Uganda has had a positive influence on the rates of consumption and access to private education in the communities that host them. This is due to increased channels of commerce in areas where more refugees are present, and the policies enforced by non- governmental organizations that allow for private education providers to be more common in areas with higher refugee populations. = Reasons for Fleeing =  The Kivu Conflict  The conflict in the Kivu region of the DR Congo has persisted since before the First Congo War, and currently takes form as a conflict between ethnic groups with political actors having a major influence. Armed groups from the Congolese Babembe, Bafuliru, and Banyindu communities are fighting with the Rwandan Banyamulenge, as Rwanda borders the Kivu region. Many suggest that the conflict concerns control over land and resources, as Kivu is plentiful in minerals. This conflict has resulted in the displacement of over 200,000 people and the destruction of many communities. Further, crucial facilities have been destroyed, including schools, hospitals, and clinics. As of August 2019, almost 2,000 civilians have been killed in this conflict.  Violence in Ituri  The conflict in the Ituri province of the DR Congo is a result of fighting between the Hema and Lendu ethnic groups. This violence has persisted for years, though it recently worsened as the availability of weapons in the area increased. Since September 2018, the Lendus have carried out an increasing amount of violent attacks against the Hemas, with crimes ranging from killings, rapings, and destruction of crucial facilities. During the summer of 2019, President Felix Tshisekedi of the DR Congo condemned the inter-ethnic group violence as attempted genocide. In January 2020, the United Nations released a report declaring the ethnic violence in the Ituri province to be crimes against humanity. Hundreds of Congolese seeking safety and stability cross into Uganda every day as a result of this conflict. More than 700 people have been killed in this conflict, and hundreds are victims of sexual violence. The majority of these victims are from the Hema communities.  The Ebola Outbreak  Since 1976, there have been 10 outbreaks of Ebola in the DR Congo, with the most recent one beginning in August 2018 and continuing into the present. The current outbreak mostly effects the Ituri and North Kivu provinces, and the number of cases has officially surpassed 3,000. In July 2019, this outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by a representative of the World Health Organization. The outbreak has slowed in 2020, with the last recorded case being confirmed on February 17. This is the largest Ebola outbreak in the DR Congo, and is the second greatest Ebola outbreak recorded worldwide. = Reasons for Coming to Uganda = Uganda currently hosts the greatest amount of refugees out of all the African countries, which may be due to their open-door refugee policy. In fact, the country's government has made welcoming and caring for refugees an important part of its national policy. Uganda's approach to refugees involves welcoming relatively anyone seeking refuge or asylum in the country, regardless of country of origin. They also allow refugees the freedom of movement and the right to pursue employment. Furthermore, refugee families are each given a piece of land so that they may benefit from agriculture. Uganda has supported the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the government intervened in the war torn country in 1998.  Problems faced by Refugees  South Sudanese refugees being served food. Many of the complaint of hunger due to the food rationing by World Food Program. Last year, Uganda took in more refugees than any other country in the world. One of the major problems faced by the refugees is that most of these stranded people are children. Some of the challenges faced by refugees include agricultural productivity, information dissemination and distribution of goods. = COVID-19 and Refugees = The novel strain of coronavirus, named COVID-19, first appeared in Wuhan, China, with the earliest case reported on November 17, 2019. By January 13, 2020, the virus had spread from China to Thailand, marking the first case of COVID-19 outside of China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially recognized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. By this time, the virus had spread to more than 114 countries and had taken the lives of over 4,000 people. As of April 17, 2020, there are almost 2.2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, 55 confirmed cases in Uganda, 4 confirmed cases in South Sudan, and 287 confirmed cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As healthcare professionals and researchers continue to learn more about the virus, various groups have come to public attention as high risk groups. One such group is refugees. Refugees and otherwise displaced populations are particularly vulnerable because of the conditions in which they live. For example, many refugees live in camps or settlements with incredibly high population density and limited access to basic services. Refugees in camps and settlements also encounter difficulties in accessing reliable and accurate information due to a variety of barriers. Further, refugees around the world heavily rely upon the aid of humanitarian groups, non-governmental organizations, and governments; due to the pandemic, these groups will be focusing their efforts and finances on the virus. In late March 2020, the Ugandan government announced that it would formally suspend the acceptance of refugees and asylum seekers into the country as the number of confirmed cases increased. Many fear the death toll from COVID-19 in Uganda will increase exponentially should the virus be introduced to the many refugee settlements. In addition, representatives of the United Nations Refugee Agency worry that the conditions of refugee settlements may enable the spread of the virus, as access to water is limited, and current food rations have been cut. Ugandan authorities have recently found it difficult to ensure that refugees are complying with the health and safety guidelines implemented by the government in order to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Musu Ecweru, Uganda's State Minister for Disaster Preparedness, explains that this lack of compliance may be due to the fact that many refugees come from countries where the governments are not trusted; as such, submitting to authority is unusual and difficult.  Problems caused by refugees  Uganda, for all its hospitality, has struggled to handle the large inflow of refugees. These refugees come to the country needing medical care as many are sick or injured from their journey. This has placed a lot of pressure on health officials in the country. In Uganda, there is approximately one doctor to every 24,000 citizens, and one nurse per every 11,000. This has presented challenges in caring for refugees. Initially, refugees used to be given some land to farm and take care of their families but because of the huge increase in the number of refugees, the country can not do it anymore making to difficult for refugees to feed themselves. The presence of these refugees has not only made it because to provide land but water and shelter as well. In part, the struggle for food by refugees has resulted from officials working these camps misusing the funds meant for the refugees to enrich themselves instead. This has led to the investigation of some of these officials.

He believed in consolidating the French presence in Algeria through support of the colons (French settlers), and the grant of French nationality to the Algerian-born children of Spanish and Italian settlers. Life =Family= Louis Tirman was born on 29 July 1837 in M√©zi√®res, Ardennes. He came from a prosperous bourgeois M√©zi√®res family. His family was Catholic, with liberal traditions. His father was Julien-Victor-Albert Tirman (1800‚Äì1862), a doctor and politician, member of the Higher Committee of Public Instruction and the Board of Administration of the Hospice de M√©zi√®res. His father was a municipal councilor in M√©zi√®res and general councilor for the M√©zi√®res from 1853 to 1862. His mother was Charlotte-Victorine Regnault (1812‚Äì1844), daughter of a businessman and industrialist from Charleville. Tirman's maternal uncle Antoine Regnault was a militant republican. His cousin Jules Rich√©(fr) was a Bonapartist deputy from 1852 to 1860, then a member of the Council of State until the end of the Second Empire. The painter Henriette Tirman (1875‚Äì1952) was the daughter of his brother, doctor Charles-Louis-Henry Tirman. On 22 September 1863 he married Marie-Eug√©nie Donckier de Donceel (1839‚Äì1917) in Philippeville, Belgium. She brought a large dowry. They had a daughter, Louise (1864‚Äì1955). Through inheritance and his salary Firman became a wealthy man in his own right. =Lawyer and administrator (1859‚Äì81)= After his secondary education in M√©zi√®res and Paris Tirman entered the Faculty of Law in Paris, where he was a friend of L√©on Gambetta. He obtained his license as a lawyer on 12 November 1859 and his doctorate in law in 1862. He became an advocate in Paris. On 16 August 1863 he was appointed counselor to the Prefecture of Ardennes. On 20 February 1869 Tirman was appointed counselor to the Prefecture of Seine-et-Marne. On 17 March 1870 Tirman was appointed secretary-general to the prefecture of Ardennes. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, after the fall of the Second French Empire Gambetta named him Prefect of Ardennes on 10 September 1870. Tirman was appointed to replace the prefect, Foy, and was responsible for organizing the defense and administration of the department. The Ardennes were soon fully occupied, but Tirman managed to deploy some troops who put up a courageous resistance. Firman took refuge in Givet. On 25 October 1870 he resumed his position as Secretary General of the Prefecture of Ardennes. Tirman as Prefect of Puy de D√¥me, c. 1876 After the Armistice, Adolphe Thiers appointed Tirman Prefect of Ardennes on 6 April 1871. This was a delicate position since the Prussians remained until 1873. He left office on 24 May 1873. On 21 March 1876 he was appointed Prefect of Puy de D√¥me, holding office until 16 May 1877. On 29 December 1877 he was appointed Prefect of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. In 1879 he was appointed to the Council of State. =Governor General of Algeria (1881‚Äì91)= Tirman was appointed Governor-General of Algeria on 26 November 1881. At this time Algeria was considered a detached part of France rather than a colony, and was administered by a civilian governor. Gambetta appointed Tirman to replace Albert Gr√©vy. On several occasions over the next ten years Tirman addressed the Senate or Chamber of Deputies during debates about Algeria. His achievements in Algeria included creation of many centers of French colonization, construction of roads and railways, houses and schools. The Cr√©mieux Decree of 1870 had granted French citizenship to the Algerian Jews. Tirman and the Minister of Justice Paul Dev√®s yielded to antisemitic factions in Algeria and France and resisted extending this decree to cover the protectorate of the M'zab to the south of the original departments of Algeria. In 1884 Tirman reasserted that despite the annexation of the M'zab in 1882, the agreement of 1853 that granted internal autonomy remained in force. At this time the population of foreigners such as Spanish and Italians in Algeria was growing, and would soon exceed that of French. Tirman observed that \\"Since we no longer have the hope of increasing the French population by means of official colonization, we must seek the remedy in the naturalization of foreigners.\\" On 30 September 1884 Tirman submitted a draft law to the government developed by the Algiers School of Law that proposed to confer French citizenship on any individual born in the colony to foreign parents unless they decided to retain their parent's nationality in the year after obtaining their majority. However, the government rejected a provision that would have guaranteed the jus soli. On 23 May 1885 Tirman made another attempt, proposing a special law for Algeria, but this was also rejected. It was not until 1889 that a law was adopted giving the right of citizenship to children of foreigners, causing an immediate increase in the number of French citizens in Algeria. By 1891 there was growing hostility to Tirman in the Senate for what was called by one senator an \\"anti-Arabic policy\\". Tirman was said to have become a tool of the colons (French settlers). While the colons paid no land taxes, he had dispossessed the indigenous people and harassed them with taxes, and had done nothing to assimilate them to France, including schooling their children. His proposal to let Algeria become financially autonomous led to his dismissal. In April 1891 Tirman was replaced by Jules Cambon and returned to France. He was named to the Ardennes General Council for the canton of Attigny after his return in 1891. Alexandre Isaac issued a report on 15 March 1898 in which he asked the Algerian committee to end the system of attachment that Albert Gr√©vy(fr) had started in 1881, and that had been expanded by Louis Tirman between then and 1891. =Senator (1892‚Äì99)= 1898 cartoon of Tirman from La vie ardennaise illustr√©e On 18 December 1892 Tirman was elected Senator of Ardennes in place of Louis Eug√®ne P√©ronne, who had died. He won in the first round with 478 votes out of 856. He was reelected on 7 January 1894, again in the first round, by 652 votes out of 851. He sat with the Republican Left group. Tirmin was a member of the Colonial group in the Senate. He remained interested in everything to do with Algeria. He was active in the discussion of the report presented by √âmile Combes on behalf of the commission to examine legal and administrative changes related to Muslim higher education, and in the debate over Algerian land ownership. Tirman was President of the Ardennes General Council from 1893 to 1898. In 1896 he was named Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e (PLM), a railway company. Louis Tirman died in office at the age of 62 on 2 August 1899 at the Ch√¢teau des Taboureaux near La Fert√©-Loupi√®re, Yonne. He had been made Officer of the Legion of Honour on 29 December 1881, Commander on 9 July 1883, Grand Officer on 20 July 1885 and Grand-Croix on 28 April 1891. Tirman was also awarded the Grand-croix of the Ordre du Nichan El-Anouar, Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star of Sweden and Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Stanislaus of Russia.

To achieve this, it usually follows these steps: reading frames, identifying salient points, corresponding points, accurate correspondence, and frame correction. = Identify salient points = The purpose of identifying the corresponding salient points that exist between two frames is to reduce distortion.Anu Suneja and Gaurav Kumar . ‚ÄúAn Experimental Study of Edge Detection Methods in Digital Image‚Äù, Global Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 10(2), 2010. Corner detection is used to identify salient points. To find corner values, Harris Corner Detector (one of the fastest algorithms for detecting corners) can be used. = Corresponding points = In this step, by extracting a matrix of 9 x 9 blocks for each point, cost to include them in the solution can be computed. The lowest cost reveals the object. = Accurate correspondence = Using the random sample consensus algorithm (RANSAC), incorrect point correspondences with strong estimation of changing in location in the image can be determined.Tordoff, B; Murray, DW. \\"Guided sampling and consensus for motion estimation.\\" 7th European Conference on Computer Vision, 2002.

In an accident, Shiv dies and Sharanya ends up in a coma. When she wakes up, she has no memory of the last few years and a man named Vyom Bedi claims to be her boyfriend. After strange incidents threaten Vyom's life (caused by Shiv's spirit), Sharanya takes advice from a sadhvi and reluctantly agrees to marry Vyom to save his life angering Shiv's spirit. As they get married, Vyom's father Rajan Bedi kills Sharanya's father. Shiv's spirit attacks and injures Vyom and Sharanya goes to Kapali Hills to find out how she can protect Vyom. There she discovers Shiv's dead body and recalls her past - how Vyom was obsessed with her and that Shiv was her actual boyfriend. Vyom had killed Shiv to marry Sharanya. Sharanya begins collecting evidence against Vyom with help from Shiv's spirit. Meanwhile, Vyom kills the sadhvi and Vidyut who had discovered his lies. When Sharanya tries to prove Vyom's crimes, his mother Madhvi takes the blame instead and is arrested. Vyom's father Rajan wants his wife released so Vyom and he fake his death and put the blame on him thus procuring Madhvi's release. Vyom blackmails Odhni to help him get rid of Shiv's spirit and, on her advice, manipulates Shiv's mother Suvarna to get Sharanya to perform Shiv's last rites and burn all his belongings. He then asks Detective Freddy to kill Odhni as well but Sharanya sees Rajan and Madhvi together and confronts Vyom. Vyom is forced to admit his crimes - the murders of Shiv's father (to protect his own parents), Shiv, the sadhvi and Sharanya's father (who found out Shiv was Sharanya's lover) and Sharanya's doctor. Sharanya tells him that she could never love him and prepares to leave but he holds Suvarna at knifepoint and threatens Sharanya to give him Shiv's ring so he can get rid of Shiv's spirit for good. But before she can remove it, Suvarna pushes her off a cliff to her death to help her escape from Vyom's hell and reunite with Shiv in spirit. About to kill Suvarna, a distraught Vyom instead kills himself. =25 years later= Rajan and Madhvi are raising a girl named Shivani who returns from London with her boyfriend Akash who is Vyom's lookalike and whose mannerisms also remind Rajan of Vyom. Shivani and Akash decide to get engaged and at their engagement party, Akash surprises her with her favourite superstar Krrish Khanna (KK) who is Shiv's lookalike. Then they meet Radhika at their film shooting who is Sharanya's lookalike. Suvarna reveals that Radhika is Sharanya's reincarnation and that Odhni and Suvarna swapped the babies because Rajan and Madhvi wanted to adopt the girl expected to be Sharanya's reincarnation. Rajan and Madhvi imprison Suvarna in the basement. Krish and Radhika see Suvarna and try to help her. Meanwhile, at Akash and Shivani's wedding, Akash is revealed to be Vyom. Suvarna had prevented him from killing himself declaring it his punishment to stay alive. Having discovered Akash's true identity as Vyom and his story, Shivani is then killed by Freddy and Vyom. Akash pretends that Shivani has gone missing and Radhika must take her place in the film. Krish convinces Radhika to join the film as they continue searching for Shivani. Radhika hears Shivani's phone ringing in the basement and goes there to find her but is confronted by Freddy and faints on seeing him. She awakens in her bed and is told by Akash that she was imagining things and that they are in Manali to look for Shivani. However, Radhika shows Krish Freddy's shirt button to prove to him that she did see him in the basement. Radhika and Krish go to the basement to find Shivani but are overpowered by Freddy and Vyom. Radhika pretends to recall her past life and says that she remembers being in love with Vyom. Krish is shocked but Vyom is overjoyed to finally get Sharanya till he realises she is lying to find Suvarna, Rajan and Madhvi. Vyom attacks Krish and tries to forcibly marry Radhika but Krish tricks him into killing Freddy. Krish and Radhika then marry before Vyom's eyes who commits suicide by jumping off a cliff. As Krish and Radhika spend time together, Vyom's spirit haunts them as they watch helplessly unable to see the spirit but certain that something is amiss.

Description  In 1892 Holy Trinity Cathedral was built in Neo-Roman style and consecrated by Bishop Anton Zerr. In contrast to the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in nearby Selz, which was built with bricks, Holy Trinity Cathedral was built of limestone, a common material of the Black Sea region at that time. The church had a beautiful marble altar, many sacred statues made by H. Ad. Vogl from Hall in Tirol near Innsbruck. The Stations of the Cross and Holy Tomb were by Ferdinand Stuflesser and other statues from St. Ulrich Gr√∂den adorned the inside of the church.  History  View of the church in 1934 In 1808 by order of Tsar Alexander I went forth ‚ÄúAbout providing assistance and headright to foreign sodbusters in Novorossiya. This order was the beginning of the second colonization wave by German settlers to Novorossiya at that time (modern region north of the Black Sea, Bessarabia and the Crimea). The colonists named their settlements according to the places left in their native land. On the territory of modern Odessa oblast there were two colonial districts: Libentalskyi and Kuchurhanskyi. All colonies were planned according to traditional German villages: with a Lutheran or Catholic church, volost administration, and school in its center. Kuchurhansklyi colonial district was founded in 1808 out of six colonies with administration center in Selz (Ger. Selz), today urban- type settlement Lymanske. The district included six Catholic colonies. An administration center, as well as German colony Kandel was founded the same year by colonists from Alsace who were mainly Catholic. At that time in Kandel (in Soviet times renamed into Rybalske) there were nearly 3,000 settlers, two schools. = Destruction of the cathedral = In the summer and autumn of 1919 German colonists from Odessa initiated the revolt against Prodrazvyorstka (food apportionment, the partition of the requested total amount as obligations from the suppliers) and mobilizing to the Soviet Red Army. After the troops of Denikin's volunteer army entered southern Ukraine, Germans formed a special colonial battalion, that weakened the strength of the Red army. After defeat of the revolt the cathedral as well as the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in nearby Selz were closed. But its current condition is much worse. During the Soviet period it was used as grain storage, later it suffered a fire that nearly destroyed it ‚Äì the ceiling fell down, and today only walls and columns are left. Today it is used by the local orphanage as coal storage.

It was first founded as the Scottish National Institution for the Education of Imbecile Children in 1862, with the building being officially opened on 23 May 1863.  History  = The early history of the building = The building initially used for the institution was in Gayfield Square, Edinburgh in 1855 and administered by 'The Society for the Education of the Imbecile Youth of Scotland'. Dr. and Mrs. Brodie educated the children during the time in Edinburgh, however; the building was too small for all the pupils and staff which meant the committee had to look for another site for the institution. It was necessary to find bigger premises for the institution, five acres near Larbert railway station were obtained to build a property and this was founded as the 'Home for Imbecile and Invalid Children' in 1863. The architect for the original building was Frederick Thomas Pilkington, his own house Egremont was started after the building at Larbert was completed, both were the High Victorian Gothic revival style that Pilkington favoured. Pilkington travelled to England to look at the designs of leading institutions there, he drew up plans and estimated the cost of erecting the building to be ¬£1800. The funds for the building were partly raised by a Ladies' Auxiliary Committee in Edinburgh, who managed to raise ¬£1350 through mainly small donations. The first part of the building opened in 1863, and there was an official opening ceremony on the 23 May with the building costing ¬£1969 in total. There was still an issue of space however and plans to extend the building were estimated at ¬£2,000; the committee held a Bazaar in the Music Hall, Edinburgh to help raise funds for the extension. Dr. Brodie was appointed as the medical superintendent of the institution. The importance of furnishing the institution to feel like a home for the children that would stay there, and also the focus on their education were the main priorities of the committee. The Constitution for the institution was confirmed by the committee in 1864, and the first election for the committee happened on 10 July 1863. Twenty-two children resided in the building by 1864, in January of that year, there had been a small fire in an outbuilding of the institution. By 1865 the institution was drawing up plans to double the sleeping quarters for the patients. Forty patients were staying at the institution by 1866, the extension plans had been drawn up and estimated at the cost of ¬£10,000 which would allow for 200 patients to stay at the institution. Dr. Brodie resigned from the institution in 1867, Dr. Adam Addison took on the role of medical superintendent after having six years experience in the Royal Lunatic Asylum, Montrose. The new buildings had started to be built in 1869, 59 pupils resided at the institution in this year. On 30 October 1869, Queen Victoria gave the institution a generous donation of ¬£100; she continued to donate throughout her reign. The new buildings were completed in 1870, and this gave more room for the teaching of lessons. As well as lessons the patients were employed to learn skills with the boys being taught by the gardener, joiner and shoe-maker and the girls being taught by the domestic servants. The patients that were girls had also been taught needlework, knitting and fancy work, during the year of 1869-1870 they had managed to knit and sew handkerchiefs, shirts, pinafores, sheets, stockings and towels. Cricket and croquet were played during the summer months and dances were held during the winter months. = Dr. Ireland = At the end of 1870, Dr. Addison resigned from his post and was replaced by Dr. W. W. Ireland. In 1872 there were 86 patients at the institute, a new cooker had to be fitted so that all the patients could be fed and a new drying green was installed for all the extra washing. The boy's studies in employable skills had been extended to include sack sewing, mat making and brush making and in the period of one year, the boys had managed to make 270 brushes, 30 doormats and 72 grain sacks. The need for a hospital building for the institute had become pressing after two epidemics had hit the institute over the last three years, the cost of construction was estimated at ¬£1,600 of which funding for a large part of it had been acquired by 1873. A kitchen-garden had been opened in 1874 to provide the institute with more vegetables for their meals. Over two hundred patients had stayed in the institution by 1874; however, there was a limit to how long a patient could stay which was five years. In 1875 the need for another extension had become apparent, the expansion would allow for a further 120 patients to live in the institution, the cost had been estimated at ¬£12,000. By 1877 most of the new building had been completed, and patients had begun to live in the portion of the building that had been completed. The gymnasium and the rest of the new building were completed by 1878; patients families had been requesting to have accommodation to stay with younger patients during their time at the institution which the committee was to meet and discuss. By 1881 the grounds had been fenced, and new sewage pipes had been fitted. = Mr. Skene = Dr. Ireland resigned in 1882 and was replaced in the role by Mr. Alexander Skene, for medical knowledge Dr. Hamilton became the medical officer to work alongside Mr. Skene in the running of the institution. Mr. Skene worked to show the positive points of having patients working on a task where they could see the difference they were making, boys worked hard in the garden and fields if they were fit enough to do so and girls enjoyed helping in the garden as well as their knitting and needlework. Mr. Skene had all the day-rooms and dormitories freshly decorated to promote a cheerful environment for all the patients that lived in the institution. Mr. Skene received a commendation from the Commissioners of Lunacy in 1883, Dr. Hamilton died in 1882 and was replaced by Dr. Leslie. In 1883 Mr. Skene continued to have the institution decorated so that the institution felt more home-like, this was achieved through mirrors, open fires in the fireplaces instead of the use of only heaters, statuettes, the number of toilets and bathrooms being increased and re-structuring the layout of the buildings to allow for another school room for the patients. By 1884 the number of patients at the institution was 178 and stayed around this number over the next few years. Mr. Skene required that part of the building be re-structured to allow for a shop to train the patients the importance of money and also practical skills. As well as dances that were held over the winter months, magic lantern shows were also provided for the patients by Colonel Nimmo. A new isolation building had to be provided to stop the spread of infectious diseases; this was finished in 1886. Mr. Skene pushed for a gate lodge to be built so that married male workers did not have to walk for miles to get to there place of work and also meant that if there was a fire or an emergency the men were close by to help, the gate lodge was completed in 1868. By 1890 the numbers of patients had risen to 194, by 1891 it had increased further to 204. Mr. Skene continued his improvements throughout the institution including a new conservatory for flowers throughout the rooms, new pipes for water and new pipelines for gas to improve the quantity to be received at the institution. The flow of water was significantly enhanced through the change to the Falkirk and Larbert Water Trust. A new laundry was fitted in 1892, with the old laundry being converted into classrooms and the previous classrooms being re- purposed as dormitories. In 1894 a licence was granted to the institution which allowed for 230 patients to be housed at the institution, in the same year 227 were living at the institution. The institution was connected to the sewage works in 1895; the superintendent was housed in a new building so that his apartment could be re-purposed to accommodate more patients. The number of patients had risen to 242, with one patient coming from Brazil and another from France, a telephone was connected to the institution, and the fruit and flower gardens were moved to make more room for a playground. In 1899 patient numbers had risen to 274, this had made necessary many parts of the buildings to be re-structured to make room for the addition of more children this included extending the dining room. The patients that were admitted in 1899 were mostly Scottish; however, one patient arrived from China and another from South Africa. The institution benefited from the opening of a covered playground in 1900; this allowed patients to exercise no matter the weather outside. In 1901 a mortuary was erected on the grounds of the institution. Mr. Skene continued to make changes to the institution and resigned as Superintendent after thirty years in the position in 1912, Dr. R. Clarkson took over the job. During Mr. Skene's time at the institution, the numbers of patients had gone from 124 to over 350; his focus had always been on the welfare of those residing in the institution. = The Royal Scottish National Institution = By 1913 the furniture in the school rooms was changed to suit the requirements of the class size, much consideration was given to the Mental Deficiency Bill and what would happen if it was passed. In 1914 the home was renamed the Scottish National Institution, Larbert, this was due to the original Mental Deficiency Act becoming law. A water tank was installed in 1914 in case of a fire; also the buildings that could be were roofed with lead and flat roofs were re-roofed in zinc. By 1915 the institution had over 400 patients residing inside it, this meant that many buildings were in need of extension, the most important of which was the sanatorium. World War I meant that the expansion of buildings was delayed due to the scarcity of materials and of men that could complete the work for the institution. In 1917 the institution was granted the honour of using the suffix of Royal in its title by King George the V, it was now known as The Royal Scottish National Institution. In 1918 the institution was granted a licence that would allow 500 patients to become residents, new beds had to be provided as the numbers of patients had already risen to 468. The new Nurses home was completed in 1919; it housed eighty members of the nursing staff and this gave more room in other buildings to allow for the rise in patients to the institution. By 1920 the institution had 500 patients throughout the year which meant there had to be a serious consideration of how the institution would house more patients. By 1922 the institution was the largest of its kind in Scotland and had a waiting list of over one hundred and twenty names. The buildings of the institution needed repairs and alterations and in 1922 William J. Gibson, O.B.E. submitted plans for the works that were to take place. The work began in August 1922 and continued until 1925, parts of the first building had to be reconstructed entirely as they were in such poor repair. The Duchess of Montrose visited the institution in 1925 and spoke positively of the work that was being achieved in Larbert. In 1926 the Board were able to acquire Larbert House and Estate, this was prompted by a need to expand how many occupants could be treated at the hospital. Included in the sale was two farms that were leased for the next five years but once the leases were finished, they would be used to allow older students to learn the skills of labouring on a farm. The Scottish Council of Women Citizens' Associations gave ¬£10,000 to go towards the colony being established on the grounds of Larbert Estate. The boy's football team began in 1931 with the girl's hockey team being formed the next again year. In 1932, the five villas at the colony were completed, each villa held fifty patients each with Larbert House having thirty-six places available inside of it. Househill farm was converted into a dairy farm and the boys of the institution that could help work the land. This meant that much of the produce was grown by the Institute for those that lived at the institute, including potatoes, oatmeal, roots and green vegetables. In 1934 a poultry farm was added which allowed for fresh eggs for the institution; also a psychologist joined the staff at the institute. Dr. Clarkson retired in 1935 after working at the institution since 1894; he was replaced by Dr. Thomas Spence. A wireless radio and speakers were wired up in the gymnasium in 1936, to allow for the children to listen to more music and dance if they wanted to. The numbers of patients at the institution had risen to over seven hundred by 1936. In 1936 a paddling pool was added beside the playground, six new swings and a see-saw were also added. In 1937 each child that was a patient at the institute was given a commemorative souvenir for the coronation of King George VI. In 1938, instead of the annual excursion of a seaside picnic, two hundred pupils went on a trip to the Empire Exhibition at Bellahouston. The Park which had previously been the superintendent's house was converted to house 30 private female patients; also a Girl Guides group (1st Torwood) was started in 1939. = The Institutions Ethos = The object of the institution was always to educate the patients in their care; education was not limited to the classroom but also included assisting the children to grow up with good behaviour and the skills to help themselves. By including training in employable skills the hope was that the children would gain enough experience to obtain employment when they left the institution, and where this may not be possible, then the aim was to teach the children to become useful at home, as much for themselves as well as for their family. Those in charge of the institution wanted the buildings to feel like a home, there was no uniform, and the children were formed into groups so that they could look out for one another. The ethos of the Colony was similar to that of the institutes, the committee and staff had realised that there was an issue of educating patients until they were twenty-one, or until they were released to their parents upon request before their eighteenth. The patients still needed to be cared for but no place catered for the care that the ex-patients of the institute needed, that is when the idea of an industrial colony began. = The Colony = The committee for the institution and a few of the superintendents of the institution had previously voiced their concerns that only being able to look after the children was a small portion of what could be achieved. The adults that they sent out into the world sometimes struggled to get jobs after their care and education; the institution knew that those brought up in their walls could achieve more than what the community outside the institution was able to do. The idea of an industrial colony was a dream, the land that the institution had was too small to allow for a farm and bigger workshops, however when the sale for Larbert House and Estate came up for sale in 1926, the committee bought the Estate. The industrial colony was estimated to cost around ¬£70,000; this would be raised through public donations. Larbert House was repurposed so that 36 adults with mental health problems could live on the Estate; the committee looked to extend this through building villas on the land so that more patients could be housed. At first two villas were to be erected but this increased to five villas, due to the demand for places in the Colony. The villas were completed in 1932 which allowed for two hundred and fifty more patients to be housed, Househill farm on the Larbert Estate was converted into a dairy farm for the institution. An appeal was made to the public to help fund the building of villas and ancillary premises, and due to the generous response, the Colony was able to open on 12 September 1935. The opening of the Colony expanded the institutes capacity to 750 patients. In 1936 privileges for the boys included passes which allowed them to leave the institution to go to football matches and the pictures, these were only available to those that were commended for their excellent behaviour. By 1937 the Colony was fully occupied, and two more villas were proposed to keep up with the demand for places, six more beds were added to Larbert House. By the autumn of 1937, the two new villas were completed which allowed for another one hundred patients to be housed at the institution. The Hostel for Colony attendants was finished in 1939, this housed twelve attendants and freed up beds in the villas for patients. The Colony accepted a further one hundred patients in 1940 due to another institution having to evacuate their patients; this meant that the hospital had to be made into an eighth villa and day rooms were lost to house everyone. The Colony boys replanted the woods, in 1941, that had been felled at the outbreak of war. = Second World War = The outbreak of World War II meant that the plans to build seven villas for the institute to house the patients were put on hold, the villas were to be similar to the ones that currently stood at the Colony. The male staff at both the institution and the Colony were significantly reduced because of enlistment. Every window was blacked out, and the gardens were ploughed to allow for more produce to be planted, the pigs and lambs that once fed the patients and staff were no longer allowed to be killed for food for the institute and Colony. By the end of 1940, over nine hundred patients were staying at the institute, the level of staff kept falling due to men being called up to enlist and nurses going to help in the war. The animals at the farm were raised to be killed, and the produce was taken away, none of the meat was given to the institute, by 1942 the oatmeal that was grown on the property was also taken to be used elsewhere. In the early 1940s the 4th Larbert, Boys Brigade was started. By the start of 1944, the Gogarburn Hospital evacuees had been returned which meant that the institute's numbers returned to under eight hundred, the staffing levels were elevated due to more staff being acquired. Dunipace House and Estate of around six hundred acres were purchased in 1946; this was to increase the size of farmland and also allow for more patients to be housed at the institute. In 1946, a proposed trunk road to run through both estates threatened how the Colony worked as adult patients could move animals and machinery between field unaided, if the trunk road were to go ahead it would cut off the best farmland from the Colony buildings. In 1948, the National Health Service Scotland Act meant that the institution was taken over by the State The institute had run for 87 years and was handed over to the NHS on the 5th of July 1948, 1,400 acres and 850 patients against the 5 acres and 28 patients they had at the start. =The NHS= The Western Regional Board took over the care of the buildings and patients at the institute; more land was purchased so that more patients could be housed at the site. The target for patient numbers was 1,300 patients through the expansion of current buildings; this was to cost ¬£1 million and be completed by 1959. The old villas once held only fifty patients, but this was to rise to between fifty-eight and sixty-two. The Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1960 meant that the Mental Welfare Commission replaced the Board of Control. A large number of patients meant that there were inadequate numbers of toilets and washing facilities for all the patients, there was also too few staff to look after all the patients and keeping staff was difficult. Inj the early 1970s the institute changed to become a hospital, the ward numbers that had previously been used were altered to become the names of lochs and rivers at the Colony and island names for the site for the children. The site was taken over by The Forth Valley Health Board in April 1974, and patient numbers remained around 1,300 into the 1980s. The general opinion had changed from taking care of those with mental health issues, instead of sending them away patients should be cared for in the community and by their own family. The original site of the institute was left without patients as they were settled elsewhere. A small part of the Colony site near to Larbert Cross was used for the Lochview development which was to take over from the Royal Scottish National Hospital. The last few patients left the original sites in 1991, with Lochview opening in September 1992, the five original villas and administrative block built in the Colony site were demolished a few months after Lochview was opened.

Wrestlers from New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), and Japanese women's promotion World Wonder Ring Stardom - with whom ROH has partnerships - also appeared on the card.  Storylines  Best in the World featured professional wrestling matches that involved wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that played out on ROH's primary television program, Ring of Honor Wrestling. Wrestlers portrayed heroes or villains as they followed a series of events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. At Final Battle, Dalton Castle defeated Cody to win the ROH World Championship. At Supercard of Honor XII Castle defeated Marty Scurll to retain the ROH World Title. At Masters of the Craft Scurll won a Defy or Deny Match (a fatal 4-way elimination match where if an opponent is eliminated by the champion that person cannot get a title shot until a new champion is crowned but if the champion is eliminated the person that eliminated him will get a future title shot) by last eliminating Castle earning him a future title shot. At Bound By Honor Scurll and Cody won an 8-man tag team elimination match with Cody last eliminating Dalton, however Cody had tagged himself in on Marty's behalf and Marty felt Cody had stolen his victory. During the ROH/NJPW War of the Worlds Tour there was obvious tension between Scurll and Cody. It was then announced via ROH's website that Castle would be defending the ROH World Title against both Cody and Marty. At Bound By Honor, Punishment Martinez attacked Adam Page. During the ROH/NJPW War of the World Tour Page cost Martinez the IWGP United States Championship and Martinez cost Page the ROH World Television Championship. Page and Martinez were also scheduled to a match during the tour but Page attacked Martinez and the match never became official. At State of the Art: Dallas, Martinez beat Silas Young to win the TV Title. ROH then announced that Martinez will defend the title against Page at Best in the World.

Born in Elgin, Moray in Scotland, Mackay left school at the age of nine and, in time, became a vehicle body builder. He joined the United Kingdom Society of Coachmakers, which sponsored him to attend Ruskin College in 1909. While he was in attendance, he participated in the students' strike and was subsequently a founder of the rival Central Labour College and a leading figure in the Plebs' League. He also joined the Independent Labour Party. In 1912, Mackay was elected as a Labour Party member of Kensington Borough Council. That year, he also became the full-time London District Secretary of the Coachmakers. In the run-up to World War I, he realised that many more aircraft workers would be needed, and he began recruiting them into the Coachmakers. This campaign was a success, and in 1915 he was appointed as the union's national organiser. Mackay continued his political activity, standing in Hampstead at the 1918 United Kingdom general election, managing only a distant second place with 19.3% of the vote. He also stood unsuccessfully in Hampstead at the 1919 London County Council election. He was elected to Hampstead Borough Council in 1922, but at the 1922 and 1923 United Kingdom general elections, he instead stood in Hitchin, and in the 1922 London County Council election he stood in Limehouse, without success. Mackay left the Coachmakers in 1922 and became secretary of the Industrial Orthopaedic Society. He also worked as a socialist journalist, mostly on behalf of the Co- operative Party and the Fabian Society. At the 1924 United Kingdom general election, he stood in Moray and Nairn, then in 1929 he stood in Mitcham. He then suffered an accident which forced him out of activity for some months and, though he recovered sufficiently to find work as the London correspondent of the Munich Illustrierte Presse, he caught pneumonia and died early in 1930. In his official Labour Party obituary, Mackay was described as \\"gifted with a lively humour, blended with a fervent belief in the Cause he made his own\\". It praised his enthusiasm and effectiveness as an organiser, but noted that his Parliamentary campaigns \\"courted certain defeat\\".

surgeon. She is widely accepted as being the first female plastic surgeon in the United States and was the first female member accepted into the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.  Early life  Alma Dea Morani was artistically gifted beginning at a young age. Growing up she was exposed to her father's work which was heavy in religious symbolism. Religious art containing icons and emblems was used to spread the religious messages and teachings at the time. Morani's father, Salvatore Morani, was a sculptor. He was most well known for sculpting surgeons' hands. Morani's love for art, inspired by her father's works, influenced her to pursue a career in plastic surgery. While in her mid-teens Morani was an active Girl Scout. Through Girl Scouts Morani learned skills that allowed her to assist and treat minor medical injuries. This experience furthered her interest in medicine.  Education  Morani completed her undergraduate education at New York University (NYU) in 1928. She then went on to attend the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (WMCP). Morani graduated with a medical degree from MWCP in 1931 and continued on to complete her residency there in 1935.  Career  Morani was the first female resident at WMCP until 1935. She did not start practicing plastic surgery until 1938, at this time she was known for being the first female plastic surgeon in the United States. To further improve her skillset as a surgeon, Morani went on to attend the American College of Surgeons in 1941. After completing her work at the American College of Surgeons, Morani did her fellowship under a well-respected surgeon, Colonel J. Brown. Morani eventually returned to WMCP where she became involved in higher education. She began by giving lectures and worked her way up the ranks to become a full professor over a span of 27 years. Having maintained a strong passion in both surgery and art throughout the course of her life, Morani was successful in incorporating both into her lectures. Morani was philanthropically and politically active. During World War II Morani raised funds to help keep clinic doors open in Philippines, Taiwan, Russia, and the Balkans. In addition, she provided pro-bono care to those serving the country, volunteering at Valley Forge Hospital performing reconstructive surgery on wounded soldiers. Politically, Morani was active in speaking out in favor of women's rights. Morani pushed for women to be able to enter the field of medicine as easily as men.  Achievement  Morani was the first female member accepted into the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. In 1948, Morani founded The Hand Clinic at Women's Medical College Hospital where students were able to get hands-on experience with patients. Morani also left a lasting impression on the art community. With her contribution of the Morani Gallery of Art, her work can be seen on display today. A majority of Morani‚Äôs art was inspired by her work in medicine. This is why her Gallery is located inside her alma mater, which was later renamed, The Medical College of Pennsylvania. The Medical College of Pennsylvania is the country's only medical school with an art gallery.  Alma Dea Morani award  The Alma Dea Morani M.D., Renaissance Women Award was created in her name in 2000 to honor women physicians or scientists who made compelling contributions apart from medicine, as well as, facilitating the practice and competency of medicine. The award is presented in the shape of a surgeons hand to represent both Morani and her father's passion for sculpting. * 2000: Alma Dea Morani M.D., FACS * 2001: Barbara Barlow M.D., FACS * 2002: Carola B.

It was made in 2018 by Gillian Wearing. Following a campaign and petition by the activist Caroline Criado Perez, the statue's creation was endorsed by both the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. The statue, Parliament Square's first monument to a woman and also its first sculpture by a woman, was funded through the government's Centenary Fund, which marks 100 years since some women won the right to vote. The memorial was unveiled on 24 April 2018. Description The bronze statue portrays Dame Millicent at the age of 50, when she became president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). The figure holds a banner reading COURAGE/ CALLS TO/ COURAGE/ EVERYWHERE, an extract from a speech Fawcett gave in 1920. She wears a walking suit, typical attire of that period featuring an overcoat and a long dress. The artist integrated the pattern and texture of the tweed fabric into the bronze of the suit. The Fawcett Society lent a piece of Fawcett's jewellery to Wearing, who scanned the brooch and incorporated it into the statue's design. The initial design was modified following feedback from members of Westminster City Council, as they felt that the sign Fawcett was holding made her look as if she were hanging laundry out to dry. Wearing modified her design to move Fawcett's hands to the corners of the sign, and lowered and flattened the sign itself. =List of engravings= The names and images of 55 women and four men who supported women's suffrage appear on the statue's plinth. They are as follows: The campaign for a woman on Parliament Square Millicent Fawcett The feminist campaigner and journalist Caroline Criado Perez began a campaign to install a statue of a woman in Parliament Square on 8 March (International Women's Day) 2016, after noticing while jogging that day that all the existing statues on the square were of men. Criado Perez had initiated the 2013 campaign to add a woman to British banknotes, after Elizabeth Fry was replaced by Winston Churchill on the ¬£5 note, and soon thereafter the Bank of England announced that Jane Austen would appear on the new ¬£10 note. The campaign called for a statue of a suffragette to be placed in Parliament Square in time for the centenary of the Representation of the People Act 1918. Following some research, Criado Perez discovered that only 2.7 percent of the statues in the United Kingdom were of individual women who were not members of the British royal family. On 10 May 2016, to launch the campaign, an open letter was written to the new Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, signed by 42 prominent women, requesting a statue of a suffragette in Parliament Square by February 2018. Khan quickly agreed to a new suffragette statue, but did not commit to Parliament Square and instead said that the authorities would \\"explore a suitable site for the statue\\". An online petition for the suffragette statue received 74,000 signatures. This was presented to Parliament on 7 June, in an event hosted by the Fawcett Society. At the same time, Criado Perez stated that she backed Millicent Fawcett as the subject of the statue, adding that \\"It's shocking that she doesn't already have a statue of her own ‚Äì and Parliament Square is the obvious place for her to be. Not round the corner, or up the road. Nothing less than Parliament Square will do.\\" On 2 April 2017, it was announced that a statue of Fawcett would be erected in Parliament Square. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, said following the announcement, \\"The example Millicent Fawcett set during the struggle for equality continues to inspire the battle against the burning injustices of today. It is right and proper that she is honoured in Parliament Square alongside former leaders who changed our country.\\" The Suffrage Statue Commission selected Gillian Wearing, a former Turner Prize winner, to create the statue with it funded from the Government's Centenary Fund. The statue was part of the 14-18 NOW series of artistic commissions that marked the centenary commemorations of World War I.https://www.1418now.org.uk/commissions/millicent-fawcett/ Millicent Fawcett ‚Äì 14‚Äì18 NOW =Rival campaigns= The Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst Memorial in Victoria Tower Gardens in 2015 In addition to the campaign for a statue of Fawcett, a rival campaign existed to install a statue of Emmeline Pankhurst in Parliament Square, which had begun in 2014. This campaign was backed by the former Prime Minister David Cameron, the former MP Neil Thorne, the Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom and the first female Speaker of the House of Commons Betty Boothroyd. An existing statue of Pankhurst, the Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst Memorial, has stood in Victoria Tower Gardens next to the Palace of Westminster since 1958. The Pankhurst campaign had initially sought to move this statue into Parliament Square, but discovered that it was too small to be placed there. The campaign commissioned sculptor Angela Conner to produce a tall statue of Pankhurst. Discussions were held about installing a pair of statues in the Square, portraying both Fawcett and Pankhurst. Campaigners from the two suffragette campaigns met, but after Thorne gained the initial agreement of Westminster City Council to place two statues, the Fawcett campaign turned this down following a second meeting between the parties. Criado Perez said that she was \\"not prepared to compromise on the central point of the campaign, which was to have a statue for a new woman and have one front and centre\\", and feared that a pair of statues would be featured less prominently in the Square than a single one. The decision was made by Westminster City Council in favour of the Fawcett statue; they stated that a future statue of Pankhurst in the Square had not been deferred but the existing statue in Victoria Tower Gardens would need to be moved elsewhere. Thorne said that, following the decision, the statue of Pankhurst created for Parliament Square would instead be placed for the time being in Brompton Cemetery, the place of her burial, while a decision on the Victoria Tower Gardens was made. In addition to the discussion of the suffragette statue, a further campaign was underway to have a statue of the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher erected in Parliament Square. The Council turned down the application as it did not meet the 10-year rule (that a minimum of 10 years have to pass following the subject's death) and that the Thatcher family opposed the design. Other statues of Thatcher exist in London: the one in the Guildhall was decapitated in 2002, and the following year another was commissioned for the interior of the Palace of Westminster. Others commented that the location was the appropriate one, but that the statue should be of someone more radical: Mary Wollstonecraft, Sylvia Pankhurst or Emily Davison. Unveiling Theresa May speaking at the unveiling of the statue On 24 April 2018, the statue was unveiled in an hour-long ceremony featuring the Prime Minister, the Mayor of London, schoolchildren and choirs. The unveiling itself was performed by three generations of women and girls: Jennifer Loehnis (a descendant of Fawcett), Criado Perez, Justine Simons (Deputy Mayor for Culture and Creative Industries) and two schoolgirls from Millbank Academy in Westminster, and Platanos College, Lambeth. At the event, May credited the work of Fawcett not only achieving votes for women but for allowing her and other female MPs to take their positions in Parliament. Criado Perez called the unveiling of the statue \\"one hell of a start\\" in increasing the representation of women across Britain in both cultural and political spheres. Similar views were supported by Khan, the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and the former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, who suggested that the square's male statues be temporarily moved elsewhere in London to allow there to be only female statues in this prominent location. Reaction and commentary The arts editor for BBC News, Will Gompertz, gave the statue five stars in his review. He said that prior to the unveiling, the only statues which stood out in the Square were those of Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George, but that has changed with the arrival of the Fawcett statue. He credited the campaign of Criado Perez, and said that the Wearing's execution of the brief was \\"exceptional\\". Gompertz praised the overall conception of the design and said that the banner was compelling. He suggested that the design was influenced by Wearing's early 1990s work Signs That Say What You Want Them To Say And Not Signs That Say What Someone Else Wants You To Say in which she took a series of photographs of strangers holding up their personal thoughts on pieces of white card. Overall, he felt that the statue had such impact that it changed the context of Parliament Square, saying that \\"The Fawcett statue makes most of the others look ridiculous, or pompous or both\\" (excepting its immediate neighbour, the statue of Gandhi) and that it gave the area a focal point lacking since the end of Brian Haw's peace protest. June Purvis, emeritus professor of women's and gender history at the University of Portsmouth, criticised some elements of the statue, saying that while the message on the banner was indeed written by Fawcett about Wilding Davison, it was not written at the time of her death but instead in the \\"relative safety\\" of 1920. At the time of Wilding Davison's death, Fawcett's NUWSS refused to take part in the funeral and did not send a wreath. Purvis also highlighted that the image of Wilding Davison is on the rear of the statue, and that the campaign was launched with the intention of commemorating a suffragette, not a suffragist, in Parliament Square.
