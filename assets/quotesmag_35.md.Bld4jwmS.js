Plot Russell Curran (Brendan Fletcher) is a successful businessman living in Portland, Oregon. His 32-year-old wife Lauren (Christina Ricci) suffers from bipolar disorder after a home invasion left her injured and her baby drowned in the bathtub. Craving for a safe home, Russell and Lauren decide to move into a luxurious high-tech smart apartment an hour away from Portland. On one of their first evenings, they attend a cocktail party and meet the other residents who are all very wealthy. One of them is Phillip Starks (Vicellous Reon Shannon), an heir of a successful marketing company focussing on consumer-psychology. Lauren soon notices strange noises coming from the apartment's sound system and occasionally sees the TV flashing up strange pictures and words. She tries to speak to Russell, but he blames her bipolar disorder and accuses her of paranoia. Later, Russell secretly installs CCTV cameras to observe Lauren's behavior. Through research on the internet, Lauren gets in touch with Vernon Sarsfield (John Cusack), a hacker and journalist. Vernon affirms Lauren that she is not paranoid and that she needs to help him to prove that the residents of her home are being used as involuntary experimental subjects to subliminal stimuli by the building's owners. Vernon believes Lauren is the only one to notice the subliminal messaging because of her bipolar disorder. One day, Lauren meets a resident that she has been perceiving as particularly awkward. He tells Lauren that he \\"is not one of them\\" and soon after commits suicide by jumping off the buildings roof. As the strange events intensify, Vernon advises Lauren to leave since he has been tracked and thus can not help her anymore. Lauren becomes increasingly suspicious of Russell who threatens to send her to a psychiatric hospital. As Lauren figures that all residents have continuously been scratching their necks, thus must have been exposed to some substance or implant, she tries to flee, but the buildings security manager and groundskeeper apprehend her in the garage and forcefully narcotize her by an injection to the neck. As Lauren wakes up, she is restrained and exposed to another subliminal stimuli on the TV, realizing that the goal of the stimuli is for her to murder a three year old child residing in another apartment. Vernon suddenly appears and frees Lauren. He gives her a gun and allows her to flee by holding up the pursuers, but gets killed as he does so. Lauren does as the stimuli suggested by kidnapping the child. Russell tries to win back her trust by saying he has proof of the subliminal stimuli through the CCTV he has installed, but Lauren rebuffs him. Using the images implanted into her head earlier, she drives the child to an abandoned shack. Later, she is then seen driving to an abandoned luxurious hotel with a blood-stained bag where she is greeted by Phillip Stark, and the building‚Äòs employees and some of its residents who were disguised employees of Stark. Stark interviews Lauren on how she feels about having killed the child. As Lauren replies that she feels well since she does as expected from her, Stark is satisfied and thanks Lauren for her contribution to the future of warfare. However, as Stark opens the bag, it is only filled with apples. A flashback reveals that Lauren and Russell had only faked the child‚Äòs death. Stark attacks Lauren, but Russell rushes to her aid and shoots him dead. The police arrive and surround the premises. In the closing scene, a pregnant Lauren and Russell have moved into a new home. As they hug, Lauren suspiciously eyes the parent unit Russell had been trying to install.

It is found in North America and Africa. Deodar weevils are considered a forest pest in the United States, with adults and larvae feeding on a variety of coniferous tree species, including trees such as Deodar cedar (Cedrus deodara), Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), Sand pine (Pinus clausa), Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), Slash pine (Pinus elliottii), and Spruce pine (Pinus glabra) Trees of all ages are susceptible to weevil infestations, with trees that are severely stressed by fire, drought, extreme cold, fusiform rust, wind damage, and other problems are prone to weevil infestation. In well managed pine stands, deodar weevil infestations are sporadic, attacking only the suppressed and unhealthy trees throughout the area. Because they do not typically effect healthy trees, they do not usually alter traditional management strategies. Unlike many other forest pests in the eastern United States, deodar weevils are most active in the winter months, and this is often when sign of infestations can be seen. The best way to avoid a deodar weevil infestation is to maintain good tree and stand health, healthy trees do not typically face mortality or extensive damage from these pests. If an infestation has occurred, pesticides can be used in the fall as the weevils become active, but is typically not recommended.  Description  = Adult = Deodar weevils adults are approximately 7mm long; can range from a rusty red to grayish brown in color on the head and the body. Like most other weevil species have a long snout (or proboscis) and a small head. They also have the weevil clubbed antennae that are 'elbowed' located near the tip of the snout. On the top of the thorax, there are two distinct white spots. An additional spot occurs on the thorax at the base of the wings (the scutellum). The abdomen can have various splotchy patterns along the wing casings (elytra) with two larger white spots or splotches on the rear or posterior portion. = Pupa = Similar in size and shape as the adult weevils, but are instead a creamy white color. The legs are crumpled beneath the already well formed proboscis. Their wing pads are wrapped around the thorax, and the head has low spines. As they approach time to molt, their shell darkens to shades more similar to the adult form. = Larvae = Newly hatched larvae are small (<2mm) growing to 12mm when mature. Much like other beetle larvae, deodar weevil larvae have a plump white ridged and legless abdomen, and an amber to brown helmet head.  Biology and Reproduction  Adult weevils become active in fall, feed and mate, and females lay eggs in the holes made while feeding in the bark. Newly hatched grubs bore under the bark where they feed, molt, and grow. The pupae occupy chambers (chip cocoons) made by the larvae.Adult weevils begin emerging in March but most of the new adult weevils emerge in May (small circular escape holes are sometimes noticed on infested stems). The new weevils apparently aestivate during the summer and become active as the weather cools down in the fall when they infest stressed trees, feed and mate. Deodar weevils usually don't infest trees younger than age 5 (hey need stems large enough to support larval galleries). Deodar weevils tend to infest the bottom 10 feet of the main stem. These weevil grubs feed beneath the bark and sometimes girdle the stem causing it to die from the damaged portion outward. The bark may swell over the feeding areas. Deodar weevils have killed trees up to 36 feet tall as the weevils attack the lower trunk. Infested shoots may die, causing excessive branching. In addition, deodar weevils can vector pitch canker (Fusarium moniliforme) The weevils are active all winter long and lay one to four or five eggs in the inner bark in holes chewed through the bark, but fall is the peak time for adult feeding and breeding. The weevils do some minor damage as they feed on the bark before laying their eggs. There is one generation per year.

She is a golden retriever, and was the first Sri Lankan dog to complete a high-altitude parachute jump on 21 November 2015, with Major Sujith Siranjeewa of the same regiment. Her record was made simultaneously with Siranjeewa's establishment of an Asian record for high- altitude parachuting, diving from an altitude of over the Uva-Kudaoya Commando Training Camp grounds. Military career Teesha performed her duties as a tracking dog for the 4th Commando Regiment during the country's civil war, helping track down enemy troops and explosives. She was, at a time, handled by Major Sujith Siranjeewa when he was Chief Instructor, Paratrooper Wing. Parachuting record Teesha's jump was first mooted by Major Siranjeewa, a veteran Sri Lankan parachutist and part of the Commando Regiment's paratrooper complement. The request was initially considered for denial by the Army and Defence establishment over concerns that the dog's life was being put in danger, with possible injuries resulting from such action. Permission was eventually granted, and Siranjeewa and Teesha performed a rehearsal jump sometime before 21 November 2015 with no problems. The actual jump was performed on 21 November at the Uva-Kudaoya Commando Training Camp grounds, as part of a tattoo in the passing out parade of 396 fresh Commando officers and troops. The pair were taken to on a Sri Lanka Air Force Mi-17 transport piloted by Flight Lieutenant Rajive Jayawickrama, and completed the jump successfully several minutes later, landing on the grounds of the training camp to applause from the audience. The jump also earned Siranjeewa an Asian parachuting record.

A small forward, tall and weighing , Spargo plays primarily as a forward, but also has the ability to play in the midfield. He has strong family connections in Australian football, whereby he is a fourth generation VFL/AFL player, with his great-grandfather, grandfather, great uncle and father all playing in the VFL/AFL. He was recognised as a talented footballer at a young age, being a part of the Academy from twelve years of age. He also played as a bottom-aged player in the TAC Cup and in the Albury seniors at sixteen years of age. Further achievements as a junior included the Alan McLean Medal as the best player in division two of the under 16 championships, two-time selection in the AFL Academy and two-time selection for the Allies in the under 18 championships. Heading into his draft year, he was touted as a first-round draft selection, however, a season-ending shoulder injury saw him fall to the second round of the 2017 AFL draft when he was recruited by Melbourne. He made his AFL debut in round six of the 2018 AFL season. Early life Spargo was born to Kate and Paul Spargo on 25 November 1999 in Albury, New South Wales. Recognised as a talented footballer from a young age, Spargo was a part of the Academy from twelve years of age. He attended Melbourne Grammar School from 2015 on a scholarship for grades ten to twelve. There, he nearly went down a pathway of soccer after scoring 7 goals in the annual School House vs Perry House match. At the end of 2015, Spargo earned selection in the AFL Academy due to his performances in the under-16 championships playing with the NSW/ACT Rams where he won the Alan McLean Medal as the best player in division two. While he was in year 11 in 2016, he played football with the Albury Football Club seniors team in the Ovens & Murray Football League at sixteen years of age and Murray Bushrangers in the TAC Cup as a bottom-aged player. In April, he played two games with the in the North East Australian Football League averaging seventeen disposals as part of the GWS Academy. Despite being a bottom-aged player, Spargo was selected in the NSW/ACT Rams team in division two of the 2016 AFL Under 18 Championships with NSW/ACT talent manager, Darren Denneman, stating \\"[Spargo's] a player who uses the ball well and probably has one of the best footy brains in terms of understanding the game and knowing how to play it\\". His performances with the NSW/ACT Rams saw him earn selection in the Allies team in division one of the championships, whereby division one matches started a month after division two. Playing with the Murray Bushrangers, the team made it to the grand final in which the Bushrangers lost by seventeen points; Spargo recorded twenty-four disposals and was named the Bushrangers' best player by AFL Media journalist, Callum Twomey. At the end of the season, he played in the under-17s all stars match and was named in Team Judd's best players by AFL Media after recording sixteen disposals and a goal. His performances throughout the year saw him earn selection in the AFL Academy for the second consecutive year. Heading into his final junior year, Spargo was touted as a first-round draft pick for the 2017 AFL draft. In March 2017, the AFL announced the Riverina would no longer be a part of the GWS Academy zone, meaning GWS would no longer have priority access to drafting Spargo in the 2017 draft. Despite the GWS Academy zone announcement, he played in an exhibition match for the GWS Academy against the Sydney Swans Academy a week after GWS lost access to Spargo, in the match he recorded a game-high twenty-five disposals along with six tackles, five inside 50s and a goal, and was named GWS' second best player by AFL Media's Giulio Di Giorgio. Playing school football for the first half of the year, he was selected to play for the Allies for the second consecutive year in the 2017 AFL Under 18 Championships. In his first match for the Allies, he dislocated his shoulder and was forced to miss the remainder of the season. He was listed with the Murray Bushrangers in the TAC Cup for the season but did not play a game due to GWS Academy commitments and injury. AFL career Spargo was drafted by Melbourne with their first selection and twenty-ninth overall in the 2017 national draft. He was eased into pre-season training with Melbourne due to his shoulder injury sustained in 2017. He played the start of the season in the Victorian Football League (VFL) with Melbourne's affiliate team, the ; in Casey's opening round match, he was reported and suspended for one match for striking 's Nick Mellington. He returned to the VFL in round three against and his performance in the match saw him named for his AFL debut in the round six match against at Etihad Stadium. In the thirty-six point win, he recorded eighteen disposals and two goals with Fox Sports Australia's Anna Harrington writing Spargo was pivotal in the win and The Age's Anthony Colangelo noted he \\"played with a composure that belied his level of experience\\".

Heading into the 2017 AFL draft, he was touted as a player who could play both in the forward line and midfield, with Fox Sports Australia's Riley Beveridge writing Spargo is clean at ground level but also has the ability to play as a pressuring forward with his chase and tackle. Callum Twomey echoed this description by noting Spargo is a consistent ball winner who tackles hard and also play in the forward line. Around the 2017 draft, his playing style was compared with Greater Western Sydney player's, Toby Greene's, by Fox Sports Australia's Ben Waterworth whereby both are \\"pocket rockets that [are] just as good in the air as [they are] on the ground\\" He also drew comparisons to VFL/AFL games-record holder, Brent Harvey, by the Herald Sun's Jon Ralph, with both Spargo and Harvey being the same height, in addition to similar playmaking skills and poise. After being drafted to Melbourne, Melbourne recruiter, Jason Taylor, stated Spargo would play the early part of his AFL career in the forward line due to his \\"ability to hit the scoreboard and his deceptive strength overhead\\", but would most likely move into the midfield throughout his career due to his ability to cover the ground. Family He is a fourth generation VFL/AFL footballer, whereby his father, Paul Spargo, played 81 games for and nine for the , his grandfather, Bob Spargo, played 80 matches for , his great uncle, Ricky Spargo, played 64 matches for Footscray, and his great-grandfather, Bob Spargo Sr., played 65 games for Footscray and two for Melbourne.

Life He was the elder son of Henry Willett of St Kitts, who married c. 1718, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Colonel John Stanley of Nevis. He matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, on 23 June 1736, aged 17, but did not take a degree.s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Willett, Ralph Willett was admitted as student at Lincoln's Inn on 4 January 1739. On his father's death in 1740 he inherited the family estates in the West Indies. A 1753 map indicates that he owned five plantations on St Kitts. In London, Willett had a town house in Dean Street, Soho, and in 1751 he bought the estate of Merley, a manor of Canford Magna, Dorset. There he began in 1752, and finished in 1760, Merley House. In 1772 he built on two wings, the one the south-east being a library (adorned with arabesques and frescoes). A printed account of this room and a view of the house are in John Hutchins's Dorset (2nd edit. iii. 12); views and plans are also in Woolfe and Gandon's continuation of Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus. Merley House today Willett was high sheriff of Dorset in 1760. He was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 5 December 1763, and Fellow of the Royal Society on 21 June 1764. He died at Merley House without issue on 13 January 1795. Collector Willett's library was rich in early-printed books and in specimens of block-printing. Many works were on vellum, and all were in the finest condition. He also collected prints and drawings. His pictures included several from the Orleans Collection and from Roman palaces. A description of the library was printed in octavo, in French and English, in 1776; it was reprinted by John Nichols, with illustrations of the designs, in 1785. A catalogue of the books in the library was distributed by Willett to friends in 1790. The pictures were sold by Peter Coxe & Co. on 31 May 1813 and two following days. Willett's library was sold by Leigh & Sotheby on 6 December 1813, over 17 days. He had been a patron of Georg Dionysius Ehret who spent the summers of many years at Merley House, its library containing \\"a copious collection of exotics\\" by him. The botanical drawings were sold by Leigh & Sotheby on 20 and 21 December. A list of the prices realised at this sale, 19 days in all, was published in 1814, the total being ¬£13,508. 4s. His books of prints passed under the hammer on 20 February 1814. Works Observations on the Origin of Printing by Willett were included in Arch√¶ologia (viii. 239‚Äì50), and reprinted at Newcastle in 1819. As the birthplace of printing, Willett decided on Mainz. A second paper, Memoir on the Origin of Printing was included in the same collection (xi. 267‚Äì316), and was reprinted at Newcastle in 1818, and again in 1820. A third paper, On British Naval Architecture,‚Äô also appeared in pp. 154‚Äì199 of the eleventh volume of Arch√¶ologia. Family Willett was twice married. His first wife, Annabella Robinson, died on 10 December 1779, aged 60; a tablet to her memory and that of her husband was placed on the south side of the chancel of Canford Magna church. His second wife, whom he married by special license at his house in Dean Street on 15 May 1786, was Charlotte, daughter of Mr. Locke of Clerkenwell, and widow of Samuel Strutt, assistant clerk of the House of Lords. She died at Dean Street on 11 May 1815, aged 69, and was buried in the south cloister of Westminster Abbey. Willett's estate and residual fortune passed by his will to his cousin, John Willett Adye, later John Willett Willett, Member of Parliament for from 1796 to 1806. Henry Ralph Willett, a descendant of John Willett Adye, who died in The Albany, London, in December 1857, collected coins and pictures, including twenty-six paintings and sketches by Hogarth.

This considerable military deployment, ostensibly to settle a power struggle in Imereti in favor of the sultan's candidate, portended a change in Ottoman policy in the fluid frontier region in the Caucasus and aimed at consolidating the imperial authority among the restive Georgian subjects. The costly war contributed to the fall of Sultan Mustafa II, having incited a mutiny of the disaffected troops at Constantinople. The new Ottoman government curtailed the campaign and effected withdrawal from much of western Georgia's interior. The Turks held the Black Sea coastline and several fortresses close to the littoral.  Background  A portion of the 1724 French map, focused on western Georgia At the outset of the 18th century, three states in western Georgia recognized Ottoman suzerainty: the principalities of Mingrelia (Dadian for the Ottomans) and Guria (Guriel)‚Äîruled by the Dadiani and Gurieli dynasties, respectively‚Äîand the kingdom of Imereti (A√ßƒ±k Ba≈ü), all once parts of the medieval kingdom of Georgia. They were regarded as tributary states and allowed internal self- rule. These were hereditary monarchies, but their rulers were expected to be confirmed by the Ottoman sultan on their accession and, in return, to pay an annual tribute. However, these provisions were not frequently respected and payment of tribute was at times irregular. The principal intermediary between the Ottoman court and western Georgian rulers were the Muslim Georgian dynasty of Jaqeli, then ruling as Ottoman frontier governors of √áƒ±ldƒ±r, based in Akhaltsikhe (Ahƒ±ska). The immediate cause of the Ottoman intervention in western Georgia in 1703 was a local power struggle in Imereti, one of many which continuously plagued that kingdom. In a series of events, the Imeretian king Simon, favored by the sultan's government, was deposed by the powerful nobleman Giorgi Abashidze, who then had him murdered with the help of Mamia III Gurieli, Prince of Guria, in 1701. After Mamia's brief spell as king of Imereti, Abashidze himself usurped the crown in 1702. As his power grew, Abashidze withheld tribute from the Ottomans as did the princes of Mingrelia and Guria. Northwest of Mingrelia, the Abkhaz pirates began attacking Turkish trade along the eastern Black Sea coastline.  Preparations  Reacting to the Imeretian upheaval, the Ottoman government promised the crown to Giorgi VII, the younger brother of the murdered king Simon, then residing at Akhaltsikhe. Ishak, governor of √áƒ±ldƒ±r, was ordered to conduct Giorgi to his kingdom and preparations for a major military expedition were set in train. While a civil war and break in dynastic succession in Imereti as well as unilateral acts on part of the western Georgian rulers were not uncommon, the massive military response was a change in the Ottomans' policy in Georgia, further dictated by the necessity of consolidating control over the fluid frontier zone against the background of recent losses in Europe and increased activity of the Russians on the Black Sea; Tsar Peter I had succeeded in conquering the Ottoman fortress of Azov and was looked upon by many in Georgia with hope. An unusually large expeditionary force was marshalled between March and July 1703. All provincial troops of eastern and northeastern Anatolia were required to participate along with substantial contingents of the standing army at the capital. The commander in chief of this expeditionary force, K√∂se Halil Pasha, governor of Erzurum, was instructed to conquer Guria, install Giorgi VII in place of Abashidze in Imereti, and leave Ottoman garrisons at Imereti's capital of Kutaisi (Kutais for the Ottomans) and one of its major provincial towns, Baghdati (Baƒüdadcƒ±k). The absence of Mamia Gurieli's replacement in the sultan's orders implied that the imperial government planned to eliminate Guria's self-rule altogether while reducing Imereti's autonomy.  Campaign  In June‚ÄìJuly 1703, Halil Pasha led a three-pronged attack against western Georgia. The troops under his direct command crossed the √áoruh River on pontoons and invaded Guria, while the contingent under his second-in-command joined by the troops of Ishak Pasha of √áildir fought their way through the Zekari Pass into Imereti. The third force was landed by the Ottoman navy in Mingrelia. Facing the invasion, Imereti's ruler Abashidze had secured the loyalty of Gurieli and Dadiani as well as most Imeretian nobles. They blocked roads and evacuated civilians, while the Ottomans took fortress after fortress. After Halil Pasha conquered Batomi (Batum) on Guria's Black Sea coast and began to erect a new fortress there, Gurieli felt compelled to submit to the Ottoman commander. Imeretian prince Giorgi Mikeladze, Abashidze's foe, defected to the Ottomans and opened the blocked roads. The Abkhaz princes also switched sides and, in their quest for booty, sent their boats to join the Turks in Guria. The Ottoman contingents then converged upon Imereti. The Imeretians failed to withstand the Ottoman artillery and lost Baghdati. The heavily fortified towers of Chalatqe in the canton of Argveti offered stiff resistance, but were eventually blown up by Ishak Pasha's soldiers. While Guria and Imereti were largely overran, Mingrelia mostly held out although the Ottoman troops destroyed the fortress of Rukhi, raided the surrounding countryside, and began fortifying Anaklia as their new outpost on the Black Sea coast. A second Ottoman army was ready at Constantinople, when four companies of Janissaries assigned to the Georgian expedition mutinied on 18 July 1703. On 22 August, Sultan Mustafa was forced to abdicate in a coup, which come to be known as the Edirne event. The new sultan, Ahmed III, refused to fund a Georgian war. The new vizier, Kavanoz Ahmed Pasha, offered Abashidze peace provided he demolished the fortress of Shorapani, gave hostages and tribute, and recognized Giorgi VII as king of Imereti under his tutelage. Abashidze agreed but then blocked a road back to Akhaltsikhe. The Georgians ambushed and destroyed the withdrawing Ottoman force. Very few made their way back to Akhlatsikhe; the governor of √áildir was wounded and that of G√∂le was killed. The Georgian campaign resonated in the empire's eastern European neighbors: in his letter of 3 August 1703 the Ukrainian Cossack hetman Ivan Mazepa informed the Russian government that the Turks had suffered a \\"considerable defeat in the land of Georgia\\" and a second army was ready to be deployed against the Georgians.  Aftermath  Western Georgia, albeit not fully conquered thanks to the coup at Constantinople, was left devastated. The maritime district around Batumi was irretrievably lost for Guria and the Turkish garrisons were permanently stationed in the Mingrelian fortresses of Poti, Anaklia, and Rukhi along the coastline and in Baghdadi in Imereti's heartland. Abashidze confined Giorgi VII, the sultan's Imeretian prot√©g√©, in the castle of Kutaisi, but his recovery of power was temporary. As Abashidze's power was draining, the unity imposed upon western Georgia crumbled. By 1707, Giorgi VII succeeded in dislodging Abashidze from Kutaisi, but found himself embroiled in fighting with Mamia Gurieli. Giorgi Dadiani's hold on power also shattered and finally eclipsed under his own son's pressure in 1715.

She has been the editor and executive director of Places journal since 2008. She was the Founding Director of the Phoenix Urban Research Lab at The Design School at Arizona State University, and a founding editor of Harvard Design Magazine at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.  Education  Levinson gained her BA from Yale University and her Master of Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania.  Career  Levinson began her career with a short period in architectural practice before moving into architectural journalism. She has published in a wide range of media, both professional and scholarly, including the Journal of Planning Literature, Yale Journal of Architecture, I.D., Metropolis, Landscape Architecture, The Christian Science Monitor, and Architectural Record, for which she was a contributing editor. She has also edited books for the Princeton Architectural Press and contributed chapters to Architecture and Film, edited by Mark Lamster, and Judging Architectural Value. Levinson also spent a period as ‚Äòeditor in the archives‚Äô at the Canadian Centre for Architecture. In 1997 Levinson co-founded Harvard Design Magazine, the biannual publication of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, with William Saunders, and continued co-editing the publication until 2001. Issues she directed and edited addressed a wide range of topics, including metropolitan form, monuments, spectacle culture, and post-communist Eastern Europe. From September 2004 until November 2006 Levinson wrote Pixel Points for the Arts Journal, an early manifestation of architectural blogging. Levinson became the founding director of the Phoenix Urban Research Lab and Professor of Practice at the Design School at Arizona State University in 2007. She was appointed editor of Places Journal in 2008, replacing long-time editor Donlyn Lyndon, and maintained both roles until she was appointed full- time at Places. Levinson also contributes to architectural culture as a design juror and public speaker.  Editorial practice  Levinson focuses on the opportunities presented by digital and online media for reaching new audiences and expanding the impact of scholarly work. Under Levinson‚Äôs editorship, Places moved from print to online and built a substantial and wide-ranging interdisciplinary readership. Levinson has expanded the mandate of the journal under the tagline ‚ÄúPublic scholarship on architecture, landscape, and urbanism‚Äù. Her editorial direction is described as ‚Äúharnessing the moral and investigative power of public scholarship to promote equitable cities and sustainable landscapes.‚Äù Levinson has led funding campaigns to support the research and publication on topics that might not otherwise be addressed. This has resulted in funding from the Graham Foundation for three initiatives ‚Äì History of the Present: Cities in Transition, Future Archive and the Writers‚Äô Fund. The Inequality Chronicles, a series investigating racial, social and economic inequality in American cities, was funded by The Kresge Foundation. Levinson has also used Places as a foundation on which to build a range of related enterprises that seek to expand participation, readership and the dissemination of scholarship on the built environment. Initiatives include Places Books, a collaboration between Places and Princeton Architectural Press. The first in the series is Where are the Women Architects? by Despina Stratigakos, which has been well received across academia and the architectural profession. The Places Reading List is a collaborative tool that allows readers to share knowledge and generate content.

It lies on the Taunus Railway, which connects Frankfurt and Wiesbaden.  History Florsheim station was opened on 13 April 1840 with the Taunus Railway, which was one of the first railways in Germany and ran between the Free City of Frankfurt and the capital of the Duchy of Nassau, Wiesbaden.according to other sources: 1839 Services on line S1 of the Rhine- Main S-Bahn have stopped in Fl√∂rsheim since the network started operating in May 1978.  Entrance building The core of the Neoclassical entrance building at Florsheim dates back to the construction of the station. It was built in 1839 to a design of the Mainz district architect Ignaz Opfermann, (thesis for Magister Artium; typewritten. Stadtarchiv Mainz: 1991/25 No. 11) but it was altered later. Thus its core forms one of the oldest preserved entrance buildings in Germany. The original building was a functional building with a symmetrical design and a gabled roof, which is typical of the old stations on the Taunus Railway. In 1875, the upper floor was added as the station master's apartment and a wooden goods shed with a typical cantilevered roof was also built. On the ground floor there was a ticket office, a supervisor's room and an office for handling goods. The pedestrian subway was built around 1910. The station precinct is part of the Route of Industrial Heritage of the Rhine-Main: Hessian Lower Main (Route der Industriekultur Rhein-Main Hessischer Unterer Main). After the renovation of the building, the Fl√∂rsheim municipal offices moved into the historic station building. It also contains a shop and an apartment. The former goods shed now houses a club for children and youth. The entrance building is listed as a cultural monument under the Hessian heritage law.  Infrastructure  Platforms of Fl√∂rsheim station Only trains of the S1 of Rhine-Main S-Bahn stop on the three platform tracks of Fl√∂rsheim station. It has a \\"house\\" and an island platform. Tracks 1 and 2 are used by S-Bahn services running via Hattersheim, Frankfurt-H√∂chst, Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof, the Frankfurt and Offenbach city tunnels, Obertshausen and Rodgau to Ober-Roden (track 1) and to Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof via Hochheim and Mainz-Kastel (track 2). Track 3 serves is only used for unscheduled over- taking movements or as a diversion route during track work. Fl√∂rsheim station is not barrier-free. The access to additional sidings (which were often used for trains running to/from a tank farm) and the loading ramp and the loading road were separated during the construction of an underpass between 2011 and 2013.  Operations Fares in Fl√∂rsheim are set by the Rhein-Main- Verkehrsverbund (RMV). = S-Bahn = S-Bahn services run on the S1 line every half hour from Monday to Friday on the Wiesbaden ‚Äì R√∂dermark-Ober-Roden route. During the peak, services run every quarter of an hour, with every second train beginning or ending in neighbouring Hochheim. = Bus services= There are two bus stops at Fl√∂rsheim station: * the Fl√∂rsheim Bahnhof S√ºdseite bus stop is on the south side in Willy-Brandt-Platz, which is served by R√ºsselsheim municipal bus route 1 (Fl√∂rsheim ‚Äì R√ºsselsheim) as well as regional bus routes 809 (Hofheim ‚Äì Fl√∂rsheim ‚Äì Hochheim) and AST route 818 (Fl√∂rsheim ‚Äì Wicker ‚Äì Weilbach). * the smaller Fl√∂rsheim Bahnhof Nordseite bus stop on the north side of the station at the commuter parking area, which is served by regional bus routes 809 (Hofheim ‚Äì Fl√∂rsheim ‚Äì Hochheim) and 819 (Fl√∂rsheim ‚Äì Wicker ‚Äì Weilbach) as well as AST routes 818 and 819 (both to/from Fl√∂rsheim ‚Äì Wicker ‚Äì Weilbach).

Younger sedimentary sequences outcrop on the edges of the Lake District area, with Silurian to the south, Carboniferous to the north, east and west and Permo-Triassic to the west and east. The entire area was covered by a Mesozoic sequence that was eroded off during Paleogene uplift related to the opening of the North Atlantic. During the Quaternary the area was affected by repeated glaciations, which sculpted the current mountainous landscape. Early Paleozoic In early Paleozoic times the area was on the northern margin of the microcontinent of Avalonia, which was moving northwards as the Iapetus Ocean began to close. Initial deepwater sedimentation recorded by the Skiddaw Group was followed by the development of a continental arc caused by the subduction of Iapetus oceanic crust beneath the Avalonian margin. This magmatism produced both the Borrowdale Volcanic Group sequence and the older granitic intrusions, which are the preserved magma chambers to the volcanics. Continental collision began near the end of the Ordovician as southward subduction ceased and northward subduction beneath the margin of Laurentia began, forming the Southern Uplands accretionary wedge. As the collision progressed the Lake District area became part of a foreland basin in which the Windermere Supergroup sediments were deposited, initially interfingering with the volcanics and then overlaying them. The collision reached its end during the Early Devonian, part of the Acadian Orogeny with the final closure of Iapetus and the intrusion of late orogenic granites. =Skiddaw Group= Slates of the Kirk Stile Formation of the Skiddaw Group, exposed just below Skiddaw summit ridge The Skiddaw Group are the oldest rocks known from the Lake District. They are mainly Ordovician in age, from possibly Cambrian up to Llanvirn (upper middle Ordovician). The sequence, which is up to about 5 km in thickness, consist mainly of mudstones and siltstones, with lesser amounts of sandstone. Following deformation and low-grade metamorphism during the Acadian Orogeny, they now have a well-developed slaty cleavage, giving rise to their common name, the Skiddaw Slates. The group is divided into two main areas, the northern and central fells, to either side of the WSW-ENE trending Causey Pike Fault, with distinct successions developed. =Eycott Volcanic Group= The Eycott Volcanic Group (EVG) forms the youngest part of the preserved Ordovician sequence in the northernmost part of the Lake District. This set of mainly andesitic lavas and tuffs, with related minor intrusions is of Caradocian (Sandbian to Early Katian) age. In terms of their chemistry the EVG are transitional between moderately potassic tholeiitic and calc-alkaline in type. =Borrowdale Volcanic Group= Dacitic lapilli tuff of the Helvellyn Tuff Formation (Helvellyn Basin succession), on High Crag (Nethermost Pike) The Borrowdale Volcanic Group (BVG) lies unconformably above the Skiddaw Group, and is of Caradocian age. It is similar to, but distinct from, the Eycott Volcanic Group. It consists of a thick sequence of basaltic, andesitic, dacitic and rhyolitic lavas and pyroclastic rocks with interbedded volcaniclastic sediments. It is subdivided informally into two parts known as the Lower Borrowdale Volcanic Group and Upper Borrowdale Volcanic groups. It is further subdivided into many formations, of which only a few have regional extent. In terms of chemistry, the BVG are moderate to highly potassic calk-alkaline in type. Lower Borrowdale Volcanic Group The lower part of the succession is dominantly andesitic. Locally in the western part, the lowest formation is the non-volcanic sandstones of the Latterbarrow Formation. In the Furness Inlier the Greenscoe Tuff Formation is the lowermost unit. In the southwest at Millom Park the Whinny Bank Tuff Formation is the lowermost unit, overlain by the Po House Tuff Formation. The Birker Fell Andesite Formation makes up most of the lower BVG, varying in thickness from 980 m to 2700 m. Upper Borrowdale Volcanic Group The upper part of the group consists of mainly intermediate to acidic pyroclastic rocks and interbedded volcaniclastic sediments. There are four main successions recognised at the base of the upper sequence: the Duddon Basin, the Scafell Caldera, the Haweswater Caldera and the Kentmere succession. These are all followed by volcaniclastic sandstone of the Seathwaite Fell Sandstone Formation, which is developed over almost the whole outcrop, varying in thickness from 30 m to >1100 m. This is followed by the equally extensive Lincombe Tarns Tuff Formation, which is an ignimbrite. The uppermost part is the Helvellyn Basin succession, consisting of volcaniclastic sandstones, dacitic lavas, andesitic lavas and tuffs, and dacitic ignimbrites. =Windermere Supergroup= The transition from the top of the Borrowdale Volcanics into the overlying Dent Group is marked by an unconformity. The Dent Group is of latest Ordovician age and forms the lowermost part of the Windermere Supergroup. It was deposited in shallow marine conditions, consisting mainly of calcareous mudstones, siltstones, limestones and shales. There is evidence of continued volcanism, with tuffs locally developed at various levels within the group. The Dent Group is overlain unconformably by the Stockdale Group, a sequence of mudstones and siltstones deposited during the latest Ordovician to earliest Silurian. The overlying Sheinwoodian to Gorstian Tranearth Group consists mainly of hemipelagite (clays and silts) with some turbiditic sandstones. This is succeeded by turbiditic sandstones, siltstones and hemipelagites of the Gorstian Coniston Group. The youngest unit is the Ludlow to Pridoli Kendal Group, which consists of couplets of graded siltstone and mudstone, locally with thick turbiditic sandstones. =Granitic intrusions= Fragments of Ennerdale Granophyre on the summit of Great Borne The Lake District was affected by two stages of granitic intrusion. The earlier Ordovician granites were intruded at the same time as the BVG, representing the solidified magma chambers related to the volcanics, which later uplift has now exposed at the surface. Intrusions of this age include the Ennerdale Granophyre and the Eskdale Granite. The later granites were intruded during the Early Devonian as part of group of intrusions found within a SW‚ÄìNE trending belt that straddles the Iapetus Suture. Granites of this age include the Shap Granite, the Skiddaw Granite and the unexposed granite responsible for the Crummock Water aureole. As a result of these two separate magmatic events, the Lake District is underpinned by a large batholith with an area of about 1500 km2. Most of the batholith is thought to be Late Ordovician in age but with some Early Devonian contributions. Late Paleozoic After the end of the Acadian collision, Northern England was affected by a phase of Early Carboniferous extension, possibly related to the subduction of Rheic Ocean crust beneath Gondwana. Preserved Lower Carbonifeous rocks are found to the west, north and east of the Lake District in the East Irish Sea, Solway and Vale of Eden basins. The sequence consists of limestones of the Carboniferous Limestone Supergroup, overlain by sandstones of the Millstone Grit Group and deltaic sandstones, shales and coals of the Coal Measures Group. The only Permian rocks known from the Lake District area are from the upper part of the sequence and form part of the early syn-rift associated with the mainly Triassic rifting event. This sequence consists of the Appleby Group, dominantly sandstones, and the Cumbrian Coast Group consisting mainly of siltstones and dolomites overlain by evaporites and red shales (locally with the development of halite). On the western edge of the Lake District and in the Vale of Eden the Appleby Group includes thick breccias, known as the Brockram. Mesozoic The Mesozoic saw the first stages of break-up of the supercontinent of Pangaea. Rifting began at the end of the Permian, with development of a series of rift basins over much of the British Isles. The rifts became more localised during the Jurassic and by the Cretaceous, most of the rifting has stopped, apart from the area south of the Variscan Front, where rifting continued into the Early Cretaceous. The Late Cretaceous saw the inundation of almost all parts of the British Isles by the \\"chalk sea\\". Triassic age rocks of the New Red Sandstone outcrop to the northeast and southwest of the Lake District massif. To the southwest they were deposited at the eastern edge of the East Irish Sea Basin. To the northeast, they were deposited in the Vale of Eden Basin. The Triassic sequences consist mainly of continental sandstones. At the end of the Triassic, shallow seas transgressed over all of the Triassic basins. There are no rocks of Jurassic or Cretaceous age preserved anywhere near the Lake District. However, based on the analysis of apatite fission tracks (AFTA) and estimates from neighbouring preserved sequences, it is thought that the Lake District was covered by between about 700 to 1750 m of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments by the Palaeocene that has since been removed by erosion. Cenozoic During the Paleogene, the Lake District, like most of the northern and western British Isles was affected by the break-up of the Atlantic at the end of the Paleocene, including the formation of the North Atlantic Igneous Province. The timing of the exhumation that removed the Mesozoic section from the top of the Lake District massif remains uncertain, although a significant part of the uplift is thought to have been caused by underplating at the end of the Paleocene. The amount of Neogene exhumation is particularly poorly constrained. Quaternary Glacial landforms, the ar√™te Striding Edge and a cirque filled by Red Tarn The Quaternary saw repeated glaciations of the Lake District area with the development of an ice cap, although the current landscape is the result of the Last glacial period, which occurred over the period 115,000 to 11,700 years ago. As the Lake District was an upland area it was unaffected by the main British-Irish ice sheet, which flowed around the margins of the massif. =Devensian glaciation= The main period of glaciation to shape the Lake District was the Devensian (the British name for the last glacial period). There were undoubtedly earlier glacial phases, but all signs of them were removed by erosion associated with the Devensian phase. The radial pattern of the main deeply glaciated valleys is thought to reflect the original radial pre-glacial drainage pattern of the massif. At various times, the peaks were either completely covered by ice or formed protruding nunataks. =Younger Dryas= Some of the best preserved glacial deposits were formed during the Younger Dryas stadial, which followed on from the relatively warm Late Glacial Interstadial about 12,900 years ago. A this time permanent ice reappeared in the Lake District. At its maximum the ice is thought to have been in the form of two areas of plateau glaciation in the central and eastern fells. Structure The Causey Pike Fault, with rocks of the Crummock Water Aureole, thrust over a sandstone olistolith of the Buttermere Formation, just below the top of Causey Pike Steeply south-dipping Dent Group calcareous mudstones overlying volcanics of the Lincombe Tarn Tuff Formation on the southern edge of the Coniston Fells, part of the Westmorland Monocline =Pre- Acadian= The earliest known structures that affected the rocks of the Lake District are folds in the Skiddaw Group that are thought to be a result of slumping. It has also been proposed that there were active extensional faults during deposition of the group, consistent with the presence of two distinct sequences. In this model, the Causey Pike Fault is one of the early faults, which was reactivated during the Acadian Orogeny as a thrust. The eruption of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group was accompanied by volcano-tectonic faulting. The faults of this age are extensional in type and thought to be a result of caldera formation. =Acadian= The main period of structuring was of Early Devonian age and part of the Acadian Orogeny. Most of the finer-grained sedimentary rocks in the Ordovician sequence took on a well-developed slaty cleavage. In the BVG, strong cleavage is mainly restricted to finer-grained volcaniclastic rocks interbedded with the volcanics. The rocks of the Windermere Supergroup have a variably developed cleavage. The cleavage has an overall WSW-ENE trend, although regionally it is somewhat arcuate, being more SW-NE trending in the west and more west-east trending in the east. The main Acadian structures in the Skiddaw Group are a set of thrust faults, of which the Causey Pike Fault has the greatest extent, being recognised across the whole of the main outcrop of the group. This and other thrusts within the Skiddaw Group are thought to be reactivated extensional faults that were active during sedimentation. The Borrowdale Volcanic Group sequence was folded during the Acadian and some of the volcano-tectonic faults were reactivated. Three large synclinal folds were formed, the Haweswater, Scafell and Ulpha synclines. In all cases, these synclines are thought to be modifications of older volcano-tectonic features. The southernmost part of the BVG sequence and the overlying Windermere Supergroup dip steeply to the south forming the Westmorland Monocline. Continuing to the south a series of upright folds are developed, reducing in amplitude towards the south. The first and largest of the folds is the Bannisdale Syncline. =Post-Acadian= During the Carboniferous period, the Lake District massif initially formed an emergent high. The north-dipping Maryport Fault formed on its northern margin as part of the regional Early Carboniferous extensional event, possibly reactivating an Acadian thrust structure. It was reactivated during the Variscan Orogeny as a reverse fault, leading to inversion of the Solway Basin to the north. The Lake District Boundary Fault on the western margin may also have been active at this time, possibly reactivating an Ordovician volcano-tectonic fault in part. In late Permian to Triassic times the Lake District Boundary Fault was an active extensional structure, forming part of the margin to the East Irish Sea Basin. Activity on this structure continued episodically through the Triassic up to the Early Cretaceous. Mineralisation Mineralisation has affected all of the Ordovician rocks in the Lake District, whether sedimentary, volcanic or intrusive. The distribution of this mineralisation suggests a close relationship to the batholith that underlies the area. The mineral veins indicate that there were several separate periods of mineralisation, with each period being associated with particular minerals. =Graphite= At Seathwaite there is major deposit of graphite. The graphite appears as pipes and veins associated with a diorite intrusion, presumed to be of Caradoc age. Organic-rich sediments in the Skiddaw Group mudstones are considered the likely source for the carbon. These high-temperature veins were probably deposited from aqueous fluids rich in carbon dioxide and methane driven by the effects of the dioritic intrusion. =Copper= Copper mineralisation is mainly hosted by the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, with particularly important veins found in the Coniston, Haweswater and Ulpha areas. The main copper mineral found is chalcopyrite, locally accompanied by bornite, chalcocite and tennantite. The veins also contain arsenic and iron sulphides, and locally magnetite. Other minerals in minor to trace amounts include native bismuth, other bismuth minerals and locally gold. The veins typically have chlorite, quartz and dolomite as gangue minerals. The veins were probably deposited from moderately saline brines, with the metallic elements derived from the volcanics and the sulphur from the underlying Skiddaw Group. This period of mineralisation probably dates to the late Caradoc as the veins clearly predate the Acadian-aged cleavage. =Tungsten= North-south trending veins containing the tungsten minerals scheelite and wolframite are associated with the Skiddaw granite around Carrock Fell in the northern lakes. Associated molybdenite gives Re-Os age of 405 Ma (Early Devonian), similar in age to the Skiddaw intrusion (399 Ma). The veins are thought to have been deposited from moderately saline brines rich in tungsten. =Lead-zinc= Lead-zinc mineralisation is found over most of the Ordovician outcrop, but particularly in the northern part. The greatest number of veins is found at Brandlehow, in the Caldbeck Fells, at Eagle Crag, Force Crag, Greenside, Hartsop, Helvellyn, around Threlkeld, Thornthwaite and the Newlands Valley. The main minerals are galena and sphalerite. The galena locally contains up to 838 ppm of silver. Common gangue minerals are baryte, calcite, dolomite and quartz, locally with siderite and fluorite. Estimated temperatures for these veins is in the range 110‚Äì130¬∞C. The lead and zinc are thought to have been derived by the leaching of Skiddaw Group rocks, the underlying batholith or Carboniferous sediments of the Solway Basin, by Carboniferous seawater. These veins are seen to cut copper-bearing veins and they are thought to be either Late Carboniferous to Early Permian in age, consistent with the age of similar veins in the northern Pennines, or Permo- Triassic in age, similar to the haematite mineralisation. =Iron= Botryoidal haematite (\\"kidney ore\\") from Egremont in the West Cumbria iron orefield Iron mineralisation, in the form of haematite veins, occurs across the northern and western Lake District, hosted particularly in the Skiddaw Group slates. It is typically of the form known as \\"kidney ore\\" with most of the veins being almost pure haematite. The most significant haematite mineralisation, however, is in the form of large orebodies replacing Carboniferous limestone in the West Cumbrian iron orefield on the western margin of the Lake District. The similarities between the orebodies hosted in the limestone and those in the Ordovician rocks suggests that they were formed together. The most likely source for the iron is the Permo-Triassic sequence that lies to the west of the Lake District in the East Irish Sea Basin. Orebodies are concentrated wherever Carboniferous limestone is in direct contact with permeable Permo-Triassic rocks. The same iron-rich fluids moving eastwards away from the basin within the sedimentary cover sequence would then have had access to open fractures in the Ordovician rocks, forming the vein deposits there. =Other minerals= The cobalt minerals alloclasite, cobaltite, glaucodot and skutterudite have been found in very small amounts associated with apatite-chlorite veins near Causey Pike. Tourmaline is found associated with some of the granites and in the Crummock Water aureole. Antimony, mainly in the form of stibnite, is found in a minor group of veins affecting the Skiddaw Group and the BVG. Baryte, a common gangue mineral in the lead-zinc veins, locally becomes the dominant mineral in veins in the Caldbeck Fells and Force Crag. Small amounts of gold have also been found. Economic geology Neolithic stone axe from Langdale The Lake District has a long history of mining and quarrying going back to at least Neolithic times, with the stone axe factory at Langdale. There are very few active mines or quarries in the Lake District at present, with the quarries working the Shap Granite being a notable exception. =Mining= The earliest records of mineral extraction in the Lake District is evidence of haematite mining in the Iron Age in Furness and during Roman times in West Cumbria. Many mines were active from the 16th-century, following the involvement of the Society of Mines Royal, who brought in German miners for their expertise. Caldbeck Fells There are more than a dozen individual mines in the area of the Caldbeck Fells, which were an important source of copper, lead, arsenic, baryte and tungsten from the 16th-century up to the 1980s. The larger copper mines included Mexico Mine, Red Gill Mine, Roughton Gill Mine and Silver Gill Mine. Carrock Fell Mine was the last in the area to remain active and the only one to produce wolfram and scheelite in England outside Devon and Cornwall. Goldscope mine Although there is evidence of small-scale near-surface mining in the Newlands Valley area from the 13th-century, mining on a large scale began in 1564. The german miners brought in to work it by the Mines Royal named it \\"Gottesgab\\" (God's gift) due to the richness of the copper deposit, which became corrupted over time to \\"Goldscope\\". During the 16th and 17th centuries it was worked for copper, but became disused during the 18th century. It was reopened for lead mining during the 19th century, before final closure in 1920. Force Crag Derelict remains of Force Crag Mine photographed in May 2009 This mine, at the head of the Coledale valley, was initially opened in the mid-19th century to produce lead and silver. From 1867 until its closure in 1991 it was worked mainly for baryte and zinc. The mine produced 60,000 tons of baryte during its working life. Seathwaite graphite mine Near Seathwaite in Borrowdale an unusually large deposit of high quality graphite, known locally as \\"wad\\", was found in the form of veins. Although the deposit was known from at least the early 15th century, significant production only began in the early 17th century and continued until 1891, when the mine finally closed. The very irregular geometry of the veins led to a complex set of workings. Individual pods of graphite could be quite large. For example, Dixon's Pipe, discovered in 1803, generated more than 30 tons of graphite, at more than ¬£1300 per ton. West Cumbrian iron orefield Winding gear at the Florence mine at Egremont Large deposits of hematite hosted in Carboniferous Limestone, were exploited by a series of mines on the northwestern margin of the Lake District. The Cleator Moor to Egremont area was particularly important, with Bigrigg, just north of Egremont, being the earliest for which there are written records, showing that this area was active as early as 1179. At the Langhorn Mine, a large high quality orebody was found, which had produced 12,500 tons of ore by 1709. In the 20th century, exploration between Egremont and Haile led to the development of three separate mines, Ullcoats, Florence and Beckermet, that were eventually linked together. This combined mine was the last to be active in West Cumbria, carrying on until 2008, if only on a small scale, when flooding brought operations to a final halt. Coniston The Mines Royal began working on the copper deposits near Coniston at the end of the 16th century until 1642, when mining was interrupted by the civil war. It did not begin again in earnest until 1758, when the Macclesfield Copper Company started to work the Bonsor Vein, continuing to a depth below the surface of by 1795, where work once again stopped. In 1824 the experienced mining engineer John Taylor oversaw a major expansion of the mine and by 1856, the mine had its most productive year, with an output of 3,659 tons of ore. From that peak, output dropped off rapidly and by the end of the century virtually all mining activity had stopped. =Building stone= An incline inside the Honister Slate Mine Various of the rock types in the Lake District have been quarried for building stone. Slate The Skiddaw Group slates have mainly been used in buildings around its area of outcrop as rubble stone as the slates are of too low quality for use in roofing. The strongly cleaved volcaniclastic units (tuffs) within the BVG have in contrast locally produced good quality slates that have been widely quarried and more recently extracted by mining. Several different bands of slate have been worked across the outcrop, for instance at Buttermere, along Borrowdale (Honister, Yewcrag, Rigg Head and Castle Crag) and from the Duddon Estuary up to Mosedale (including Broughton Moor, Kirskstone and Coniston). Light green, silver grey and blue-black varieties have all been worked. They have been used for roofing both in the Lake District and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The Honister Slate Mine is the only mine in the Lake District still producing slates of this type. Good quality slates are also found in parts of the Windermere Supergroup, particularly the blue-grey slates of the Tranearth Group, known as \\"Burlington Slates\\". These have been produced in large quantities since the 17th century. A large quarry working these slates is still in operation near Kirkby-in- Furness. Limestone Limestone has been quarried from the Carboniferous sequences on the margins of the Lake District. It has been mainly used as rubble stone or ashlar in buildings across the area, particularly in Kendal. Sandstone Sandstones of Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic age have all been used as building stone in the Lake District. Grey sandstones of the Yoredale Group were locally quarried and used in buildings. Red Penrith Sandstone and Brockram breccia of the Permian Appleby Group have been used as building stone in their area of their outcrop to the east and south of the Lake District. Red Triassic sandstones of the Sherwood Sandstone Group were widely quarried, with the largest quarries near St Bees, working since the 19th century, sending stone around the country and to the United States. Granitic rocks Shap Pink Quarry, pictured in 1989 Most of the Ordovician and Devonian granitic bodies in the Lake District have been quarried to some extent. Parts of the Eskdale granitic body has been worked for building stone, as seen in Muncaster Castle. The church of St James in Buttermere was partly constructed from rock taken from the Eskdale intrusion. The microgranite at Threlkeld was used in the Roman Catholic Our Lady of the Lakes and St Charles Church in Keswick. The Shap Granite has been quarried since the 19th century and still remains active, producing small amounts of ornamental stone. =Aggregate= Ghyll Scaur quarry, the only source of very high specification aggregate in England Aggregate comes from three main types of extraction: unconsolidated sand and gravel, crushed rock aggregate and secondary aggregate (by-products of other types of extraction or industrial processes). Sand and gravel There are working sand and gravel quarries in Cumbria, but all outside the National Park, such as Peel Place Quarry, which works fluvioglacial sand and gravel, near Holmrook and Cardewmires Quarry which works river deposits south west of Carlisle. Crushed rock aggregate Much of the crushed rock aggregate in the area comes from various layers in the Carboniferous limestone. Higher specification aggregates, such as those required for road surfacing, however, come mainly from sandstones and igneous rocks, both volcanic (BVG) and intrusive (various granitic bodies). Two quarries at Roan Edge (east of Kendal) and Holmscales are currently producing high specification roadstone from sandstone. The single quarry producing very high specification aggregate is at Ghyll Scaur, just north of Millom, which is the only currently available source for this quality of roadstone in England. It works a welded rhyolitic tuff from the Waberthwaite Tuff Formation of the BVG.
